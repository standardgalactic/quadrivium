IN DARWIN'S 
WAKE, WHERE AM I? 
DANIEL C. DENNETT, 
TUFTS UNIVERSITY 
Parfois 
je pense; et parfois, 
je suis. 
Paul Valeryl 
Valery's "Variation 
sur Descartes" excellently 
evokes the vanishing 
act that has haunted philosophy 
ever since Darwin overturned 
the 
Cartesian 
tradition. 
If my body is composed of nothing 
but a team of 
a few trillion 
robotic cells, mindlessly 
interacting 
to produce all the 
large-scale patterns that tradition would attribute to the non- 
mechanical workings 
of my mind, there seems to be nothing 
left 
over to be me. Lurking 
in Darwin's shadow there is a bugbear: the 
incredible Disappearing 
Self.2 One of Darwin's earliest critics saw 
what was coming and could scarcely contain his outrage: 
In the theory 
with which we have to deal, Absolute Ignorance 
is the artificer; 
so that we may enunciate as the fundamental 
principle 
of the whole system, that, IN ORDER TO MAKE A 
PERFECT AND BEAUTIFUL 
MACHINE, 
IT IS NOT REQUISITE 
TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT. This proposition 
will be found, 
on careful examination, 
to express, in condensed form, 
the 
essential purport 
of the Theory, 
and to express in a few words 
all Mr. Darwin's meaning; who, by a strange inversion of 
reasoning, 
seems to think 
Absolute Ignorance 
fully 
qualified 
to take the place of Absolute 
Wisdom in all the achievements 
of creative skill.3 
This "strange 
inversion 
of reasoning" 
promises-or 
threatens-to 
dissolve the Cartesian 
res cogitans as the wellspring 
of creativity, 
and 
then where will we be? Nowhere, it seems. It seems that if creativity 
gets "reduced" to "mere mechanism" we will be shown not to exist 
at all. Or, we will exist, but we won't be thinkers, 
we won't manifest 
genuine "Wisdom in all the achievements of creative skill." The 
individual 
as Author 
of works and deeds will be demoted: a person, 
it seems, is a barely salient nexus, a mere slub in the fabric of 
causation. 
Whenever we zoom in on the act of creation, 
it seems we lose 
sight of it. The genius we thought 
we could see from 
a distance gets 
replaced at the last instant 
by stupid machinery, 
an echo of Darwin's 
shocking substitution 
of Absolute Ignorance for Absolute Wisdom 
in the creation of the biosphere. Many people dislike Darwinism 
in 
their guts, and of all the ill-lit, murky reasons for antipathy to 
Darwinism, 
this one has always struck me as the deepest, but only 
in the sense of being the most entrenched, 
the least accessible to

rational criticism. There are thoughtful 
people who scoff at 
Creationism, 
dismiss dualism out of hand, pledge allegiance to 
academic humanism-and 
then get quite squirrelly 
when somebody 
proposes a Darwinian theory 
of creative intelligence. 
The very idea 
that all the works of human genius can be understood 
in the end to 
be mechanistically 
generated 
products 
of a cascade of generate-and- 
test algorithms 
arouses deep revulsion in many otherwise quite 
insightful, 
open-minded 
people. 
Absolute Ignorance? Fie on anybody who would thus put 
"A" and "I" together! 
Serendipity 
is the wellspring 
of evolution, 
so it is 
fitting 
that an evolutionist 
such as I should adapt MacKenzie's happy 
capitalization for a purpose he could hardly have imagined. His 
outraged scoffing 
at the powers of Absolute Ignorance has an 
uncannily similar echo more than a century later in the equally 
outraged 
scoffing 
at those who believe in what John Searle4 
has called 
"strong 
AI," the thesis that real intelligence 
can be made by artifice, 
that the difference 
between a mindless mechanism and a mindful 
one is a difference 
of design (or program-since 
whatever you can 
design in hardware 
you can implement 
in a virtual 
machine that has 
the same competence)5 
Darwin's "strange 
inversion 
of reasoning" 
turns an ancient idea 
upside-down. 
The "top-down" 
perspective 
on creative intelligence 
supposes that it always takes a big, fancy, 
smart thing to create a 
lesser thing. 
No horseshoe has ever made a blacksmith; 
no pot has 
fashioned 
a potter. 
Hence we-and all the other fancy things 
we see 
around us-must have been created by something still fancier, 
something 
like us only more so. To many-perhaps 
most-people, 
this 
idea isjust obvious. Consider 
this page from 
a creationist 
propaganda 
mailing: 
1. Do you know of any building that didn't have a builder? 
YES/NO 
2. Do you know of any painting that didn't have a painter? 
YES/NO 
3. Do you know of any car that didn't have a maker? YES/NO 
If you answered "YES" for any of the above give details: 
But however strongly 
the idea appeals to common sense, Darwin 
shows us how it can be, in a word, false. Darwin shows us that a 
bottom-up 
theory of creation is, indeed, not only imaginable but 
empirically 
demonstrable. 
Absolute Ignorance is fully 
qualified to 
take the place of Absolute 
Wisdom in all the achievements 
of creative 
skill-all of them. 
John Searle's Chinese Room thought 
experiment 
is a variation 
on the desperate joke of the creationists: 
Do you know of any machine that can understand Chinese? 
YES/NO 
If you answered "YES" give details!

While the creationists' 
rhetorical 
questions merely gesture towards 
the presumed embarrassments 
facing anybody who tries to "give 
details" of an instance 
of bottom-up 
creation, 
Searle's challenge offers 
a survey 
of possible avenues the believers in strong 
AI might 
take in 
their attempts 
to "give details" and purports 
to rebut them one and 
all. The believers in strong 
AI have been remarkably 
unmoved by 
Searle's attempts at refutation, 
and the comparison of Searle's 
position with creationism 
shows why. Biologists who cannot yet 
explain some particular 
puzzle about the non-miraculous 
path that 
led to one marvel of nature or another, 
who cannot yet "give details" 
to satisfy 
the particular 
critic, 
nevertheless 
have such a fine track 
record of success in giving 
the details, and such a stable and fecund 
background 
theory 
to use in generating 
and confirming 
new details, 
that they simply dismiss the rhetorical 
implication: "You'll never 
succeed!" They calmly acknowledge that they may need to develop 
a few new wrinkles 
before they can declare victory. Believers in 
strong 
AI are similarly 
content to concede that all AI models to date 
have been deficient in many respects, orders of magnitude too 
simple, many of them pursuing 
particular 
visions of AI that are simply 
mistaken. 
They go on to note that Searle isn't challenging 
particular 
details of the attempts 
to date; he purports 
to be offering 
an argument 
for the in principle 
impossibility 
of strong 
AI, a conclusion that he 
insists is meant to cover all imaginable complications of the 
underlying 
theoretical 
framework. 
They know that their underlying 
theoretical framework 
is nothing other than the straightforward 
extension, 
into the human brain and all its peripheral 
devices and 
interfaces, 
of the Darwinian 
program 
of mindless mechanism doing, 
in the end, all the work. If Darwinian mechanisms can explain the 
existence of a skylark, 
in all its glory, 
they can surely explain the 
existence of an ode to a nightingale, 
too.6 A poem is a wonderful 
thing, 
but not clearly more wonderful 
than a living, 
singing 
skylark. 
Unsupportable 
antipathies often survive thanks to protective 
coloration: 
they blend into the background 
of legitimate 
objections 
to overstatements 
of the view under attack. Since the reach of 
Darwinian enthusiasm has always exceeded its grasp, there are 
always good criticisms 
of Darwinian excesses to hide amongst. 
Likewise, of course, for the excesses of the ideologues of AI. And so 
the battle rages, generating 
as much suspicion as insight. 
Darwinians 
who are sure that a properly 
nuanced, sophisticated 
Darwinism is 
proof 
against all the objections 
and misgivings-I 
am one such-should 
nevertheless 
recall the fate of the Freudian nags of the 50s and 60s, 
who insisted on seeing everything 
through 
the perspective of their 
hero's categories, 
only to discover that by the time you've attenuated 
your Freudianism to accommodate everything, 
it is Pickwickian 
Freudianism 
most of the way. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, and 
sometimes an idea is just an idea-not a meme-and sometimes a bit 
of mental machinery 
is not usefully 
interpreted 
as an adaptation 
dating back to our ancestral hunter-gatherer 
days or long before,

even though it is, obviously, 
descended (with modifications) 
from 
some combination 
or other of such adaptations. 
We Darwinians 
will 
try to remind ourselves of this, hoping our doughty 
opponents will 
come to recognize that a Darwinian theory 
of creativity 
is not just a 
promising 
solution 
but the only solution in sight to a problem that is 
everybody's 
problem: 
how can an arrangement 
of a hundred 
billion 
mindless neurons compose a creative mind, an I? 
William Poundstone has put the inescapable challenge 
succinctly 
in terms of "the old fantasy 
of a monkey 
typing 
Hamlet by 
accident." He calculates that the chances of this happening 
are "1 in 
50 multiplied 
by itself 150,000 times." 
In view of this, it may seem remarkable that anything 
as 
complex as a text of Hamlet exists. The observation that 
Hamlet was written 
by Shakespeare and not some random 
agency only transfers the problem. Shakespeare, like 
everything 
else in the world, must have arisen (ultimately) 
from 
a homogeneous early universe. 
Any way you look at it 
Hamlet is a product of that primeval 
chaos.7 
Where does all that design come from? 
What processes could 
conceivably 
yield such improbable 
"achievements 
of creative skill"? 
What Darwin saw is that design is always both valuable and costly. 
It does not fall like manna from heaven, but must be accumulated 
the hard way, by time-consuming, 
energy-consuming 
processes of 
mindless search through 
"primeval 
chaos", automatically 
preserving 
happy accidents when they occur. This broadband process of 
Research and Development 
is breathtakingly 
inefficient, 
but-this 
is 
Darwin's great insight-if 
the costly fruits 
of R and D can be thriftily 
conserved, 
copied, and re-used, they can be accumulated over time 
to yield "the achievements of creative skill." "This principle of 
preservation," 
Darwin says, "I have called, for the sake of brevity, 
Natural 
Selection."8 
There is no requirement 
in Darwin's vision that these R and D 
processes run everywhere 
and always at the same tempo, with the 
same (in-)efficiency. 
Consider the unimaginably huge multi- 
dimensional 
space of all possible designed things-both 
natural and 
artificial. 
Every 
imaginable 
whale and unicorn, 
every automobile 
and 
spaceship and robot, every poem and mathematical proof and 
symphony 
finds 
its place somewhere in this Design Space. If we think 
of design work or R and D as a sort of lifting 
in Design Space9 then 
we can see that the gradualistic, 
frequently 
back-sliding, 
maximally 
inefficient 
basic search process can on important 
occasions yield 
new conditions 
that speed up the process, permitting 
faster, 
more 
effective 
local lifting.'° 
Call any such product of earlier R and D a 
crane, and distinguish 
it from 
what Darwinism 
says does not happen: 
skyhooks." Skyhooks, 
like manna from 
heaven, would be miracles, 
and if we posit a skyhook 
anywhere 
in our "explanation" 
of creativity, 
we have in fact conceded defeat-'Then 
a miracle occurs."'2

What, then, is a mind? The Darwinian 
answer is straightforward. 
A mind is a crane, made of cranes, made of cranes, a mechanism of 
not quite unimaginable 
complexity 
that can clamber through 
Design 
Space at a giddy-but 
not miraculously 
giddy-pace, thanks to all the 
earlier R and D, from all sources, that it exploits. What is the anti- 
Darwinian answer? It is perfectly 
expressed by one of the 20th 
century's great creative geniuses (though, like MacKenzie, he 
probably 
didn't mean by his words what I intend to mean by them). 
Je ne cherche 
pas; je trouve. 
-Pablo Picasso 
Picasso purports 
to be a genius indeed, someone who does not 
need to engage in the menial work of trial and error, 
generate-and- 
test, R and D; he claims to be able to leap to the summits of the 
peaks-the excellent designs-in the vast reaches of Design Space 
without 
having to guide his trajectory 
(he searches not) by sidelong 
testing 
at any waystations. 
As an inspired bit of bragging, 
this is non 
pareil, but I don't believe it for a minute. 
And anyone who has strolled 
through 
an exhibit 
of Picasso drawings 
(as I recently 
did in Valencia) 
looking 
at literally 
dozens of variations 
on a single theme, all signed- 
and sold-by the artist, 
will appreciate that whatever Picasso may 
have meant by his bon mot, he could not truly 
claim that he didn't 
engage in a time-consuming, 
energy-consuming 
exploration of 
neighborhoods 
in Design Space. At best he could claim that his own 
searches were so advanced, so efficient, 
that it didn't seem-to 
himself-to 
be design work at all. But then what did he have within 
him that made him such a great designer? A skyhook, 
or a superb 
collection of cranes?'3 
We can now characterize a mutual suspicion between 
Darwinians and anti-Darwinians that distorts the empirical 
investigation 
of creativity. 
Darwinians suspect their opponents of 
hankering 
after 
a skyhook, 
a miraculous 
gift 
of genius whose powers 
have no decomposition into mechanical operations, however 
complex and informed by earlier processes of R and D. Anti- 
Darwinians suspect their opponents of hankering 
after an account 
of creative processes that so diminishes 
the Finder, 
the Author, 
the 
Creator, 
that it disappears, 
at best a mere temporary 
locus of mindless 
differential 
replication. 
We can make a little progress, I think, 
by 
building 
on Poundstone's example of the creation of the creator of 
Hamlet. Consider, 
then, a little 
thought 
experiment. 
Suppose Dr. Frankenstein 
designs and constructs 
a monster, 
Spakesheare, that thereupon 
sits up and writes out a play, Spamlet. 
My question is not about the author of Waverley 
but about the author 
of Spamlet. 
Who is the author of Spamlet? 
First, 
let's take note of what I claim to be irrelevant 
in this thought 
experiment. I haven't said whether Spakesheare is a robot, 
constructed out of metal and silicon chips, or, like the original

Frankenstein's 
monster, 
constructed 
out of human tissues-or cells, 
or proteins, 
or amino acids, or carbon atoms. As long as the design 
work and the construction 
were carried out by Dr. Frankenstein, 
it 
makes no difference 
to the example what the materials 
are. It might 
well turn 
out that the only way to build a robot small enough and fast 
enough and energy-efficient 
enough to sit on a stool and type out a 
play is to construct 
it from 
artificial 
cells filled 
with beautifully 
crafted 
motor proteins and other carbon-based nanorobots. That is an 
interesting 
technical 
and scientific 
question, 
but not of concern here. 
For exactly the same reason, if Spakesheare is a metal-and-silicon 
robot, it may be allowed to be larger than a galaxy, if that's what it 
takes to get the requisite complication 
into its program-and 
we'll 
just have to repeal the speed limit 
for light 
for the sake of our thought 
experiment. 
These technical constraints 
are commonly 
declared to 
be off-limits 
in these thought experiments, so so be it. If Dr. 
Frankenstein 
chooses to make his AI robot out of proteins 
and the 
like, that's his business. If his robot is cross-fertile 
with normal human 
beings and hence capable of creating 
what is arguably 
a new species 
by giving birth to a child, that is fascinating, 
but what we will be 
concerned with is Spakesheare's purported 
brainchild, 
Spamlet. 
Back to our question: 
W5,ho 
is the author of Spamlet? 
In order to get a grip on this question, 
we have to look inside and 
see what happens in Spakesheare.'4 
At one extreme, 
we find inside 
a file (if Spakesheare is a robot with a computer memory) or a 
basically memorized 
version of Spamlet, all loaded and ready to run. 
In such an extreme case, Dr. Frankenstein 
is surely the author of 
Spamlet'5, using his intermediate 
creation, 
Spakesheare, as a mere 
storage-and-delivery 
device, a particularly 
fancy 
word processor. 
All 
the R and D work was done earlier, 
and copied to Spakesheare by 
one means or another. 
We can visualize this more clearly by imagining 
a sub-space of 
Design Space, which I call the Library 
of Babel, after Jorge Luis 
Borges' classic short 
story 
by that name.16 
Borges invites 
us to imagine 
a warehouse filled 
with books that appears to its inhabitants 
to be 
infinite; 
they eventually 
decide that it is not, but it might 
as well be, 
for it seems that on its shelves-in no order, 
alas-lie all the possible 
books. 
Suppose that each book is 500 pages long, and each page consists 
of 40 lines of 50 spaces, so there are two thousand character-spaces 
per page. Each space is either 
blank, or has a character 
printed 
on it, 
chosen from 
a set of 100 (the upper and lower case letters 
of English 
and other European languages, plus the blank and punctuation 
marks).'7 
Somewhere in the Library 
of Babel is a volume consisting 
entirely 
of blank pages, and another volume is all question marks, 
but the vast majority 
consist of typographical 
gibberish; 
no rules of 
spelling or grammar, 
to say nothing 
of sense, prohibit 
the inclusion 
of a volume. Five hundred 
pages times two thousand characters

page gives a million character-spaces per book, so there are 100',000,000 
books in the Library 
of Babel. Since it is estimated18 that there are 
only 10040 (give or take a few) particles (protons, neutrons and 
electrons) in the region of the universe 
we can observe, the Library 
of Babel is not remotely 
a physically 
possible object, but thanks to 
the strict 
rules with which Borges constructed 
it in his imagination, 
we can think 
about it clearly. 
We need some terms for the quantities 
involved. 
The Library 
of 
Babel is not infinite, 
so the chance of finding 
anything 
interesting 
in 
it is not literally 
infinitesimal.'9 
These words exaggerate in a familiar 
way, but we should avoid them. Unfortunately, 
all the standard 
metaphors-astronomically 
large, a needle in a haystack, 
a drop in 
the ocean-fall comically short. No actual astronomical quantity 
(such as the number of elementary 
particles in the universe, 
or the 
time since the Big Bang measured in nanoseconds) is even visible 
against the backdrop of these huge-but-finite 
numbers. 
If a readable 
volume in the Library 
were as easy to find as a particular 
drop in the 
ocean, we'd be in business! Dropped at random into the Library, 
your chance of ever encountering 
a volume with so much as a 
grammatical 
sentence in it is so vanishingly 
small that we might 
do 
well to capitalize the term-Vanishingly 
small-and give it a mate, 
Vastly, 
short for Very-much-more-than-astronomically.20 
It is amusing to reflect 
on just how large this finite 
set of possible 
books is, compared with any actual library. 
Most of the books are 
pure gibberish, 
as noted, so consider the Vanishing 
subset of books 
composed entirely 
of English 
words, without 
a single misspelling. 
It 
is itself 
a Vast set, of course, and contained within 
it, but Vanishingly 
hard to find, 
is the Vast subset whose English 
words are lined up in 
grammatical 
sentences. A Vast but Vanishing 
subset of this subset in 
turn is the subset of books composed of English sentences that 
actually make sense. A Vast but Vanishing 
subset of these are about 
somebody named John, 
and a Vast but Vanishing 
subset of these are 
about the death of John F. Kennedy. 
A Vast but Vanishing 
subset of 
these are true ... and a Vast but Vanishing 
subset of the possible true 
books about the death of JFK are written 
entirely 
in limericks. 
There 
are many orders of magnitude 
more possible true books in limerick 
form about the death of JFK than there are books in the Library 
of 
Congress. 
Now we are ready to return 
to that needle-in-a-haystack, 
Spamlet, 
and consider how the trajectory 
to this particular 
place in the Library 
of Babel was traversed 
in actual history. 
If we find that the whole 
journey 
was already completed by the time Spakesheare's memory 
was constructed and filled with information, 
we know that 
Spakesheare played no role at all in the search. Working 
backwards, 
if we find that Spakesheare's only role was running 
the stored text 
through 
a spell-checker 
before using it to guide its typing 
motions, 
we will be unimpressed 
by claims of Spakeshearian 
authorship. 
This 
is a measurable, but Vanishing, 
part of the total R and D. There is a

sizable galaxy of near-twin 
texts of Spamlet-roughly a hundred 
million 
different 
minor mutants 
have but a single uncorrected 
typo 
in them, and if we expand our horizon to include one typo per page, 
we have begun to enter the land of Vast numbers of variations 
on 
the theme. Working 
back a little 
further, 
once we graduate 
from 
typos 
to thinkos,2 those arguably mistaken, or sup-optimally 
chosen, 
words, we have begun to enter the land of serious authorship, 
as 
contrasted 
with mere copy-editing. 
The relative triviality 
of copy- 
editing, and yet its unignorable importance in shaping the final 
product gets well represented 
in terms of our metaphor of Design 
Space, where every little bit of lifting 
counts for something, 
and 
sometimes 
a little 
bit of lifting 
moves you onto a whole new trajectory. 
As usual, we may quote Ludwig Mies van der Rohe at this juncture: 
"God is in the details." 
Now let's turn the knobs on our thought 
experiment, 
as Douglas 
Hofstadter 
has recommended22 
and look at the other extreme, in 
which Dr. Frankenstein 
leaves most of the work to Spakesheare. The 
most realistic 
scenario would surely be that Spakesheare has been 
equipped by Dr. Frankenstein 
with a virtual 
past, a lifetime 
stock of 
pseudo-memories 
of experiences 
on which to draw while responding 
to its Frankenstein-installed 
obsessive desire to write a play. Among 
those pseudo-memories, 
we may suppose, are many evenings at 
the theater, 
or reading books, but also some unrequited 
loves, some 
shocking 
close calls, some shameful 
betrayals 
and the like. Now what 
happens? Perhaps some scrap of a "human interest" 
story on the 
network 
news will be the catalyst 
that spurs Spakesheare into a frenzy 
of generate-and-test, 
ransacking 
its memory for useful tidbits 
and 
themes, transforming-transposing, 
morphing-what 
it finds, 
jiggling 
the pieces into temporary, 
hopeful structures that compete for 
completion, 
most of them dismantled 
by the corrosive 
processes of 
criticism 
that nevertheless 
expose useful bits now and then, and so 
forth, 
and all of this multi-leveled 
search would be somewhat guided 
by multi-level, 
internally 
generated evaluations, 
including 
evaluation 
of the evaluation... of the evaluation functions 
as a response to 
evaluation of... the products of the ongoing searches.23 
Now if the amazing Dr. Frankenstein 
had actually 
anticipated 
all 
this activity 
down to its finest 
grain at the most turbulent 
and chaotic 
level, and had hand-designed 
Spakesheare's virtual 
past, and all its 
search machinery, 
to yield just this product, Spamlet, then Dr. 
Frankenstein 
would be, once again, the author of Spamlet, but also, 
in a word, God. Such Vast foreknowledge would be simply 
miraculous. 
Restoring 
a smidgen of realism to our fantasy, 
we can 
set the knobs at a rather 
less extreme position and assume that Dr. 
Frankenstein 
was unable to foresee all this in detail, but rather 
delegated to Spakesheare most of the hard work of completing 
the 
trajectory 
in Design Space to one literary 
work or another, something 
to be determined 
by later R and D occurring 
within Spakesheare 
itself.

neighborhood 
of reality 
itself, 
for we already have actual examples of 
impressive 
artificial 
Authors 
that Vastly 
outstrip 
the foresight 
of their 
own creators. 
Nobody has yet created an artificial 
playwright 
worth 
serious attention, 
but an artificial 
chess player-IBM's 
Deep Blue-and 
an artificial 
composer-David 
Cope's EMI-have both achieved results 
that are, in some respects, equal to the best that human creative genius 
can muster. 
Who beat Garry 
Kasparov, 
the reigning 
World Chess Champion? 
Not Murray Campbell or any of his IBM team. Deep Blue beat 
Kasparov. Deep Blue designs better chess games than any of them 
can design. None of them can author a winning game against 
Kasparov. Deep Blue can. Yes, but. Yes, but. I am sure many of you 
are tempted 
to insist 
at this point that when Deep Blue beats Kasparov 
at chess, its brute force search methods are entirely 
unlike the 
exploratory 
processes that Kasparov uses when he conjures up his 
chess moves. But that is simply 
not so-or at least it is not so in the 
only way that could make a difference 
to the context of this debate 
about the universality 
of the Darwinian perspective on creativity. 
Kasparov's brain is made of organic materials, and has an 
architecture 
importantly 
unlike that of Deep Blue, but it is still, 
so far 
as we know, a massively 
parallel search engine which has built up, 
over time, an outstanding 
array of heuristic 
pruning 
techniques that 
keep it from 
wasting time on unlikely 
branches. There is no doubt 
that the investment 
in R and D has a different 
profile 
in the two cases; 
Kasparov has methods of extracting 
good design principles 
from 
past 
games, so that he can recognize, 
and know enough to ignore, huge 
portions 
of the game space that Deep Blue must still patiently 
canvass 
seriatim. 
Kasparov's "insight" 
dramatically 
changes the shape of the 
search he engages in, but it does not constitute 
"an entirely 
different" 
means of creation. 
Whenever 
Deep Blue's exhaustive 
searches close 
off a type of avenue that it has some means of recognizing 
(a difficult, 
but not impossible task), it can re-use that R and D whenever it is 
appropriate, 
just as Kasparov does. Much of this analytical 
work has 
been done for Deep Blue by its designers, 
and given as an innate 
endowment, 
but Kasparov has likewise benefitted 
from hundreds 
of thousands 
of person-years 
of chess exploration 
transmitted 
to him 
by players, coaches and books. It is interesting 
in this regard to 
contemplate 
the suggestion 
recently 
made by Bobby Fischer, 
who 
proposes to restore 
the game of chess to its intended rational purity 
by requiring 
that the major pieces be randomly 
placed in the back 
row at the start of each game (random, but mirror 
image for black 
and white). This would instantly 
render the mountain 
of memorized 
openings almost entirely 
obsolete, for humans and machines alike, 
since only rarely 
would any of this lore come into play. One would 
be thrown 
back onto a reliance on fundamental 
principles; 
one would 
have to do more of the hard design work in real time-with 
the clock 
running. 
It is far from 
clear whether 
this change in rules would benefit 
human beings more than computers. 
It all depends on which type

of chess player is relying 
most heavily on what is, in effect, 
rote 
memory-reliance with minimal comprehension on the R and D of 
earlier explorers. 
The fact is that the search space for chess is too big for even Deep 
Blue to explore exhaustively 
in real time, so like Kasparov, 
it prunes its 
search trees by taking 
calculated risks, 
and like Kasparov, 
it often gets 
these risks pre-calculated. 
Both presumably 
do massive amounts of 
"brute 
force" computation 
on their 
very different 
architectures. 
After 
all, what do neurons know about chess? Any work they do must be 
brute force work of one sort or another. 
It may seem that I am begging the question in favor of a 
computational, AI approach by describing the work done by 
Kasparov's brain in this way, but the work has to be done somehow, 
and no other way of getting 
the work done has ever been articulated. 
It won't do to say that Kasparov uses "insight" 
or "intuition" 
since 
that just means that Kasparov himself 
has no privileged 
access, no 
insight, 
into how the good results come to him. So, since nobody 
knows how Kasparov's brain does it-least of all Kasparov-there 
is 
not yet any evidence at all to support 
the claim that Kasparov's means 
are "entirely 
unlike" the means exploited by Deep Blue. One should 
remember 
this when tempted to insist that "of course" Kasparov's 
methods are hugely 
different. 
What on earth could provoke one to go 
out on a limb like that? 
Wishful 
thinking? 
Fear? 
But that's just chess, you say, not art. Chess is trivial 
compared to 
art (now that the world champion chess player 
is a computer). 
This is 
where David Cope's EMI comes into play.24 
Cope set out to create a 
mere efficiency-enhancer, 
a composer's aid to help him over the 
blockades of composition any creator confronts, a high-tech 
extension 
of the traditional 
search vehicles (the piano, staff 
paper, the 
tape recorder, 
etc.). As EMI grew in competence, it promoted itself 
into a whole composer, 
incorporating 
more and more of the generate- 
and-test process. When EMI is fed music by Bach, it responds by 
generating 
musical compositions 
in the style of Bach. When given 
Mozart, 
or Schubert, 
or Puccini, or Scott Joplin, 
it readily analyzes 
their 
styles 
and composes new music in their 
styles, 
better 
pastiches 
than Cope himself-or 
almost any human composer-can compose. 
When fed music by two composers, it can promptly 
compose pieces 
that eerily 
unite their 
styles, 
and when fed, all at once (with no clearing 
of the palate, you might say) all these styles at once, it proceeds to 
write music based on the totality 
of its musical experience. The 
compositions 
that result can then also be fed back into it, over and 
over, along with whatever other music comes along in MIDI format, 
and the result is EMI's own "personal" musical style, a style that 
candidly reveals its debts to the masters, while being an 
unquestionably 
idiosyncratic 
integration 
of all this "experience." 
EMI 
can now compose not just two-part 
inventions 
and art songs but 
whole symphonies-and 
has composed over a thousand,

heard. They are good enough to fool experts (composers and 
professors 
of music) and I can personally 
attest to the fact that an 
EMI-Puccini 
aria brought 
a lump to my throat-but 
then, I'm on a hair 
trigger 
when it comes to Puccini, and this was a good enough 
imitation 
to fool me. David Cope can no more claim to be the 
composer of EMI's symphonies 
and motets and art songs than Murray 
Campbell can claim to have beaten Kasparov in chess. 
To a Darwinian, 
this new element in the cascade of cranes is 
simply 
the latest in a long history, 
and we should recognize that the 
boundary between authors and their artifacts 
should be just as 
penetrable 
as all the other boundaries in the cascade. When Richard 
Dawkins notes25 
that the beaver's dam is as much a part of the beaver 
phenotype-its 
extended phenotype-as its teeth and its fur, 
he sets 
the stage for the further 
observation 
that the boundaries of a human 
author are exactly 
as amenable to extension. 
In fact, 
of course, we've 
known this for centuries, 
and have carpentered 
various semi-stable 
conventions for dealing with the products of Rubens, of Rubens' 
studio, of Rubens' various students. 
Wherever 
there can be a helping 
hand, we can raise the question of just who is helping whom, what 
is creator and what is creation. How should we deal with such 
questions? To the extent that anti-Darwinians 
simply want us to 
preserve some tradition 
of authorship, 
to have some rules of thumb 
for determining 
who or what shall receive the honor (or blame) that 
attends authorship, 
their 
desires can be acknowledged and met, one 
way or another (which doesn't necessarily 
mean we should meet 
them). To the extent that this is not enough for the anti-Darwinians, 
to the extent that they want to hold out for authors as an objective, 
metaphysically 
grounded, "natural kind" (oh, the irony in those 
essentialist wolf-words 
in naturalist 
sheep's clothing!), they are 
looking for a skyhook. 
The renunciation 
of skyhooks is, I think, 
the deepest and most 
important 
legacy of Darwin in philosophy, 
and it has a huge domain 
of influence, 
extending 
far beyond the skirmishes 
of evolutionary 
epistemology 
and evolutionary 
ethics. If we commit ourselves to 
Darwin's "strange inversion 
of reasoning," 
we turn our backs on 
compelling 
ideas that have been central 
to the philosophical 
tradition 
for centuries, not just Aristotle's 
essentialism 
and irreducible 
telos, 
but also Descartes's res cogitans as a causer outside the mechanistic 
world, to name the three that had been most irresistible 
until Darwin 
came along. The siren songs of these compelling 
traditions 
still move 
many philosophers 
who have not yet seen fit 
to execute the inversion, 
sad to say. Clinging 
to their pre-Darwinian 
assumptions, 
they create 
problems for themselves that will no doubt occupy many 
philosophers 
for years to come.26 
The themes all converge when the 
topic is creativity 
and authorship, 
where the urge is to hunt for an 
"essence" of creativity, 
an "intrinsic" 
source of meaning and purpose, 
a locus of responsibility 
somehow insulated from the causal fabric 
in which it is embedded, so that within 
its boundaries 
it can generate,

from its own genius27, 
its irreducible genius, the meaningful words 
and deeds that distinguish 
us so sharply 
from mere mechanisms. 
Plato called for us to carve nature at its joints, a wonderful 
biological image, and Darwin showed us that the salient boundaries 
in the biosphere are not the crisp set-theoretic boundaries of 
essentialism, 
but the emergent 
effects 
of historical 
processes. As one 
species turns into two, the narrow isthmus of intermediates 
disappears as time passes, leaving islands, concentrations 
sharing 
family 
resemblances, 
surrounded 
by empty space. As Darwin noted 
(in somewhat different 
terms), there are feedback processes that 
enhance separation, 
actively 
depopulating 
this middle ground. We 
might 
expect the same sort of effects 
in the sphere of human mind 
and culture, 
cultural 
habits or practices that favor 
the isolation 
of the 
processes of artistic 
creation in a single mind. "Are you the author 
of this?" "Is this all your own work?" The mere fact that these are 
familiar questions shows that there are cultural pressures 
encouraging 
people to make the favored 
answers come true. A small 
child, crayon in hand, huddled over her drawing, slaps away the 
helping hand of parent or sibling, 
because she wants this to be her 
drawing. 
She already appreciates the norm of pride of authorship, 
a 
culturally 
imbued bias built on the palimpsest of territoriality 
and 
biological ownership. 
The very idea of being an artist shapes her 
consideration 
of opportunities 
on offer, 
shapes her evaluation of 
features she discovers in herself. And this in turn will strongly 
influence 
the way she conducts her own searches through 
Design 
Space, in her largely 
unconscious emulation of Picasso's ideal, or, if 
she is of a contrarian 
spirit, 
defying 
it, like Marcel Duchamp: 
Cabanne: What determined 
your choice of readymades? 
Duchamp: That depended on the object. In general, I had to 
beware of its "look." It's very difficult 
to choose an object, 
because, at the end of fifteen 
days, you begin to like it or to 
hate it. You have to approach something 
with an indifference, 
as if you had no aesthetic emotion. The choice of 
readymades is always based on visual indifference 
and, at 
the same time, on the total absence of good or bad taste...28 
There is a persistent 
problem of imagination 
management in 
the debates surrounding 
this issue: people on both sides have a 
tendency to underestimate 
the resources of Darwinism, 
imagining 
simplistic 
alternatives 
that do not exhaust the space of possibilities. 
Darwinians are notoriously 
quick to find (or invent) differences 
in 
genetic fitness 
to go with every difference 
they observe, for instance. 
Meanwhile, anti-Darwinians, 
noting the huge distance between a 
beehive and the St. Matthew Passion as created objects, are apt to 
suppose that anybody who proposes to explain both creative 
processes with a single set of principles must be guilty of one 
reductionist 
fantasy 
or another: "Bach had a gene for writing 
baroque 
counterpoint 
just like the bees' gene for forming 
wax hexagons" or

"Bach was just a mindless trial-and-error 
mutator and selector of the 
musical memes that already flourished in his cultural environment." 
Both of these alternatives are nonsense, of course, but pointing out 
their flaws does nothing to support the idea that ("therefore") there 
must be irreducibly 
non-Darwinian principles at work in any account 
of Bach's creativity. In place of this dimly imagined chasm with 
"Darwinian phenomena" on one side and "non-Darwinian 
phenomena" on the other side, we need to learn to see the space 
between bee and Bach as populated with all manner of mixed cases, 
differing 
from their nearest neighbors in barely perceptible ways, 
replacing the chasm with a traversable gradient of non-minds, 
protominds, hemi-demi-semi minds, magpie minds, copycat minds, 
aping minds, clever-pastiche minds, "path-finding" 
minds, "ground- 
breaking" minds, and eventually, genius minds. And the individual 
minds, of each caliber, will themselves be composed of different 
sorts 
of parts, including, surely, some special-purpose "modules" adapted 
to various new tricks and tasks, as well as a cascade of higher-order 
reflection devices, capable of generating ever more rarefied and 
delimited searches through pre-selected regions of the Vast space of 
possible designs. 
It is important 
to recognize that genius is itself a product of natural 
selection and involves generate-and-test procedures all the way 
down. Once you have such a product, it is often no longer particularly 
perspicuous to view it solely as a cascade of generate-and-test 
processes. It often makes good sense to leap ahead on a narrative 
course, thinking 
of the agent as a self, with a variety of projects, goals, 
presuppositions, 
hopes, ...In short, it often makes good sense to adopt 
the intentional stance towards the whole complex product of 
evolutionary 
processes. This effectively 
brackets the largely unknown 
and unknowable mechanical microprocesses as well as the history 
that set them up, and puts them out of focus while highlighting 
the 
patterns of rational activity that those mechanical microprocesses 
track so closely. This tactic makes especially good sense to the creator 
himself or herself, who must learn not to be oppressed by the 
revelation that on close inspection, even on close introspection, a 
genius dissolves into a pack rat, which dissolves in turn into a 
collection of trial-and-error processes over which nobody has 
ultimate control. 
Does this realization amount to a loss-an elimination-of 
selfhood, 
of genius, of creativity? 
Those who are closest to the issue-the artistic 
and scientific geniuses who have reflected on it-often confront this 
discovery with equanimity. Mozart is reputed to have said of his 
best musical ideas: "Whence and how do they come? I don't know 
and I have nothing to do with it."29 
The painter Philip Guston is equally 
unperturbed by this evaporation of visible self when the creative 
juices start flowing: 
When I first 
come into the studio to work, there is this noisy crowd 
which follows me there; it includes all of the important painters in

powers" from its "bottom-up causal powers" that "produce 
intentionality," 
some have thought Searle imagines intentionality 
to 
be a special sort of substance secreted by the brain. Since he denies 
this, he owes us some other way to distinguish 
these mysterious 
causal 
powers from the control powers that software can implement and 
an explanation of why they are not implementable in a virtual 
machine. 
6. This perspective helps to explain the visceral appeal to many 
onlookers of the various apparent alternatives to Darwinian 
mechanism that have flourished over the years. The most prominent 
recently have been the appeal to "self-organization" 
"on the edge of 
chaos" (Stuart Kauffman, Per Bak, and others), and "dynamical 
systems theory" in both evolution and cognition (Esther Thelen, Walter 
Freeman, Timothy van Gelder, and others), and, of course, Stephen 
Jay Gould's insistence that evolution is not, as I have claimed (building 
on the work of theorists 
from Darwin to Fisher and Haldane to Williams 
and Maynard Smith), fundamentally 
an algorithmic 
process. After 
the 
smoke of battle clears, these ideas can be readily seen to be, at best, 
interesting 
complications of the basic Darwinian mechanisms, just as 
connectionist architectures and embodied cognition models are 
interesting 
complications of the basic ideas of AI. These controveries 
are, at best, constructive 
disagreements over how to "give the details", 
not challenges to the basic Darwinian vision.

and peaks in adaptive landscapes, to name the most obvious and popular

does not guarantee its soundness, of course,

has proven to be particularly 
useful in expressing

ideas (e.g., Kauffman's

Press 1992, p. 10) calculates the volume of the universe 
as 1084 cubic centimeters. 
19. The Library 
of Babel is finite, 
but curiously 
enough, it contains all the 
grammatical sentences of English within its walls. But that's an infinite 
set, and the library 
is finite! 
Still, any sentence of English, of whatever 
length, can be broken down into 500-page chunks, each of which is 
somewhere in the library! 
How is this possible? Some books may get 
used more than once. The most profligate case is the easiest to 
understand: since there are volumes which each contain a single 
character and are otherwise blank, repeated use of these one hundred 
volumes will create any text of any length. As Quine (Quiddities: An 
Intermittently 
Philosophical Dictionary, 
Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ. 
Press. 1987) points out, in his informative 
and amusing essay, "Universal 
Library," 
if you avail yourself of this strategy 
of re-using volumes, and 
translate everything 
into the ASCII code your wordprocessor uses, you 
can store the whole Library 
of Babel in two extremely 
slender volumes, 
in one of which is printed a 0 and in the other of which appears a 1! 
(Quine also points out that Theodor Fechner, the psychologist, 
propounded the fantasy 
of the universal library 
long before Borges.)

20. Quine, loc.cit., coins the term "hyperastronomic" 
for the same 
purpose. The previous two paragraphs are drawn, with minor 
changes, from Darwin's Dangerous Idea, pp108-9. 
21. For more on this concept, see my "From Typo to Thinko: When 
Evolution Graduated to Semantic Norms," forthcoming 
in the Fyssen 
conference volume on cultural evolution. 
22. Douglas R. Hofstadter, 
1981, "Reflections," 
(on Searle) in Hofstadter 
and Dennett, eds., The Mind's I: Fantasies and Reflections 
on Self and 
Soul, 1981, New York: Basic Books and Hassocks, Sussex: Harvester 
23. Shakespeare himself 
was, of course, a tireless exploiter of the design 
work of others, 
and may well have been poking fun at his own reputation, 
quoting a critic, 
when he had Autolycus describe himself as "a snapper- 
up of unconsidered trifles" 
in A Winter's Tale (Act IV, scene iii). Thanks 
to Tony Marcel for drawing this passage to my attention. 
24. For the details, see David Cope, ed., Virtual 
Music (forthcoming 
from 
MIT Press), including my commentary, 
"Collision Detection, Muselot, 
and Scribble: Some Reflections 
on Creativity." 
25. Richard Dawkins, 1982, The Extended Phenotype, Oxford and San 
Francisco: Freeman. 
26. Three examples: Jerry Fodor's series of flawed theories of 
psychosemantics; John Searle's inability 
to account for how "intrinsic 
intentionality" could evolve when it has no "control power" 
consequences visible to selective pressure; John McDowell's quest 
for a non-Darwinian 
alternative to what he calls "bald naturalism," a 
struggle to secure a variety of normativity 
that is not the mere as-if 
normativity 
he finds discernible in evolution. See Dennett, Darwin's 
Dangerous Idea, 1995, and "Granny versus Mother Nature - No 
Contest," Mind & Language, 11 no.3, 1996, pp 263-269, and "Review of 
John Searle, The Rediscovery of the Mind" Journal of Philosophy, 60, 
(4), 193-205, Apr. 1993, for my analyses of Fodor's and Searle's 
difficulties. 
My discussion of McDowell must be deferred to another 
occasion. 
27. See "Do-It-Yourself 
Understanding," 
in Brainchildren, 
Cambridge 
MA: MIT Press, 1998, pp59-80, for my analysis of this theme in Fred 
Dretske's search for a privileged place where the understanding 
happens. 
28. Dialogues with Marcel Duchamp, Pierre Cabanne (transl Ron 
Padgett), New York, Viking Press, 1971, p.48. Thanks to Nicholas 
Humphrey and Victoria McGeer for ideas expressed in the previous 
paragraph. 
29. In an oft-quoted but possibly spurious passage-see Darwin's 
Dangerous Idea, p346-7. 
30. I have been unable to locate the source of Guston's quote, but I have 
found much the same remark attributed 
to the composer, John Cage, a 
close friend and contemporary 
of Guston's, who [is said to have]said 
this about painting:

When you are working, everybody is in your studio-the past, 
your friends, the art world, and above all, your own ideas-all 
are there. But as you continue painting, they start leaving, 
one by one, and you are left completely alone. Then, if you 
are lucky, even you leave. 
Like all other creators, Guston and I like to re-use what we find, adding 
a few touches from time to time.
