Dedicated to Dr. A J. Staverman, Professor emeritus,

in science and in attitude of mind, where the author spent 
26 unforgettable years. 

nable time. The comparative length of the second chapter of 
this book gives evidence of this intention. The character of 
this second chapter resembles in many respects that of a 
text book. In fact, it intentionally starts from the basic 
principles and leads, finally, to rather complicated matters. 
The reasons for the choice of certain subjects will be dis-
cussed below in due course. 
This monograph starts with a chapter which is intended 
to furnish a general survey of existing experimental tech-
niques and data. As far as the mechanical experiments are con-
sidered, completeness must certainly not be expected. The 
reader may even discover some personal preferences of the 
author. In fact, very often those types of apparatusses were 
described, which the author knew from personal experience or 
which were used in the laboratories of acquaintances or friends. 
This practice was considered a way to get through this multi-
farious matter without missing a point of importance in the 
composition. After all, this book is not intended as a review 
of mechanical methods. As a matter of fact, this restriction 
is not valid for the part of this first chapter, which is 
concerned with flow birefringence techniques. Special emphasis 
is laid on the investigation of the limits of validity of the 
linear stress-optical rule. 
The second chapter is devoted to theories, which aim at 
a prediction of non-linear rheological properties on the basis 
of the linear viscoelastic data of the polymer melt. These 
theories are quasi-molecular, as they all start with the 
kinetic theory of rubber elasticity. The common feature of 
these theories is that they are all based on the picture of 
the temporary network structure or at least on the strain 
energy function derived from the theory of rubber elasticity. 
In a book on flow birefringence this choice is obvious: The 
linear stress-optical rule is tied up with the idea that the 
state of stress is determined by the orientation of chain 
segments as in rubber elasticity. In fact, this orientation 
causes a decrease of entropy and a corresponding increase of 
the mentioned strain energy. In such a system the mechanism

Preface 
The present monograph is intended as an introduction into 
a field which certainly did not receive proper attention in the 
past. It is one of the aims of this book to verify this suppo-
sition. The author hopes to show that the technique of the 
measurement of flow birefringence can fulfil an important com-
plementary task in polymer melt rheology. From this point it 
is expected that the present monograph will attract the atten-
tion of polymer scientists in general, and of rheologists and 
process engineers in particular. Certainly, the fourth chapter 
will appeal to the latter group. 
As a teacher in polymer science and technology the author 
wants to address also the group of the graduate students. In 
fact, the standard knowledge acquired during usual university 
studies in chemistry, physics or engineering does not enable 
a quick start of research activities in the field of polymer 
melt rheology. Certainly, in this typically interdisciplinary 
field everyone can lay emphasis on matters which are familar 
to hirn because of his preceding education. Significant research 
activities, however, can only be generated on the basis of a 
more universal knowledge. In the absence of this knowledge 
beginners have to rely upon the guidance of their supervisors 
for an unduly long period. Otherwise they take the risk of 
losing too much of their costly time. This holds in particular 
for the experimentalists who cannot be dispensed from being 
familiar with the necessary theoretical background. In this 
respect the elder generation of experimentalists has been 
learning for decades, but not always with efficiency. This 
means that ever and again the attempt should be made to ab-
ridge this troublesome path to the research frontier in order 
to enable the younger generation to take over within a reaso-
VII 

of energy dissipation is that of entropy production: The 
entropy of a chain segment increases spontaneously at the 
moment when one of its temporary network junctions dies. 
As with the expansion of an ideal gas into an evacuated 
vessel, no heat is produced at this moment. Heat production 
occurs during previous extension of the chain segment (com-
pression of the gas). Otherwise, the stress tensor would 
contain a term due to direct internal friction which could 
never be depicted by the orientational birefringence. 
The development of theories of this quasi-molecular type 
has been impetuous during the last five years. The reason for 
this development is found in the fact that experiments have 
unequivocally shown how the non-linear rheological behaviour 
of a polymer melt is determined by its linear viscoelastic 
properties. In this connection the reader rs reminded of an 
early indication in the form of the famous rule by Cox and 
Merz, according to which the non-Newtonian shear viscosity 
(as a function of shear rate) should be equal to the absolute 
value of the complex dynamic viscosity (as a function of 
circular frequency). This development has culminated only 
very recently in the publication of a paper, in which an ex-
perimental verification is given for Leonov's theory which 
does not seem to contain any adjustable parameter. 
The dis advantage of the quasi-molecular theories is that 
they do not formulate quantitative relations between structu-
ral parameters (like chain stiffness and molecular mass distri-
bution) and (linear) viscoelastic properties. Theories, which 
try to formulate these interrelations, may be called true 
molecular theories. The third chapter of the present monograph 
is devoted to this type of theories. Also in this field 
considerable progress has been made very recently with the aid 
of the "reptation" model. Flow birefringence has proven to be 
a very useful additional resource in all recent verification 
procedures. In the fourth chapter its more direct application 
to industrial problems is sketched. 
A lot of theory is found in this book. But the reader 
IX 

may realize that most of it will be needed by the experi-
mentalist to carry out his job as a modern polymer rheolo-
gist adequately. This holds in particular also for the con-
tents of the appendices. This book is certainly not written 
with the intention to teach theorists new possibilities of 
exploration or to discuss problems of consistency etc .. 
This should become evident from the choice of a rather 
narrow band of theories out of the immense theoretical lite-
rature. Also within this band, the preference of the author 
is obviously determined by the practical usefulness of the 
theories. I f s.uch a theory "works", whereas i ts basic ideas 
are still not completely.clear, this fact should be an 
encouragement for theorists to find out why it works. One 
should also recognize that for certain practical problems 
even rather simple considerations are very useful. In this 
connection it should be said that a reasonable knowledge of 
the theory of linear viscoelasticity is often more useful 
for industrial problems than the ability to carry out com-
plicated calculations. 
The author is very grateful to Prof. J. Meissner for pro-
posing hirn to Springer-Verlag as a contributor to the series 
"Polymers/Properties and Applications", and for his constructive 
criticism. He also wants to express his thanks to Profs. R.B. 
Bird, M. Doi, H. Giesekus, Drs. A.I. Isayev, H.M. Laun, Profs. 
A.S. Lodge, F.R. Schwarzl, Drs. J.L.S. Wales and 
M.H. Wagner 
for kindly reading parts of the manuscript and making their 
useful comments. In particular, the great readiness of Springer-
Verlag to comply with the author's intentions should be stressed. 
The author is indebted to his coworkers Drs. A. Schausberger 
and R. Sobczak for their preparedness to understand his tempora-
ry engagement in problems other than those of daily life at a 
university and to Mr. H. Raberger for his aid in preparing the 
figures. The author is particularly grateful to his secretary, 
Mrs. G. Gura, for her excellent type writing of the manuscript. 
Her engagement was really a great help. Last not least the 
author wants to thank his wife and children for their patience 
during a three years' period of extensive homework.

1 Survey of Experimental Results 
1.1 Preparatory Considerations 
1.1.1 Introductory Remarks 
As may be clear from the title of this monograph, 
the flow birefringence of polymer melts will be treated in the 
general context of the rheology of these fluid systems. As a 
matter of fact, it does not seem desirable to treat the flow 
birefringence technique as an independent method by which 
polymeric fluids can be characterized. For such a purpose 
the flow birefringence method suffers too much from a number 
of shortcomings. First of all, only clear fluids can be investi-
gated. This means that systems containing filler particles must 
be excluded from the investigation. (Fortunately, pure 
crystalline polymers which are opaque at room temperature 
as a consequence of the microcrystalline structure, become 
clear above their melting points.) Another drawback of 
this method is that it is indirect. Rheologists are inter-
ested in the interrelations between stresses and strains: 
rheology is part of mechanics and not of optics. 
By the investigation of dilute solutions with the aid 
of flow birefringence one can obtain, with some luck, optical 
parameters of the macromolecule1 ). For bulk poly~ers, however, 
interest in birefringence is focussed on quite different 
subjects, e.g. on the origin of so-called "frozen-in" orien-
tations, which are found in injection moulded samples 2 ) and 
other products of plastics manufacturing3 ) 4). Obviously, 
the sometimes complicated birefringence patterns found in 
amorphous polymers can only be understood, if a basic know-
ledge of flow birefringence, as occurring during polymer flow 
(and cooling!), is provided. Except for some applications 

in optieal deviees (injeetion moulded lenses or disks for 
da ta storage), however, the interest in birefringenee 
patterns is still mainly for meehanieal reasons. The presen-
ee of a pronouneed birefringenee pattern indieates 
anisotropie meehanieal (and thermal) properties of the artiele 
and gives rise to the suspieion that the artiele may produee 
warping or other defeets under the influenee of "frozen-in" 
stresses. At this point it beeomes quite elear that we are in 
need of a unique relation between birefringenee and the state 
of stress. For the mentioned "frozen-in" stresses, however, 
sueh a relation is not available. This is beeause of the 
eontribution of at least t~o types of stresses as eaused by 
ehain orientation (mainly entropie) and by non-uniform 
eooling (beeoming apparent in the temperature region below 
the glass-transition). The diffieulty with these stresses 
is that their influenees on the optieal properties of the 
sampie are very different, sometimes even inverse, as in the 
ease of polystyreneS ) . 
Fortunately, polymerie melts show a mueh simpler behaviour. 
At temperatures weIl above the glass transition temperature 
polymers are eonsidered to be in thermodynamie equilibrium 
with external stresses. This means that no residual stresses 
are possible. Experienee shows that, in general, a linear 
stress-optieal rule holds6 ) 7). In other words, the deviatorie 
eomponents of the refraetive index tensor and the stress 
tensor are simply proportional. There is also no obser-
vable time lag 
between stress and birefringenee. Some authors 
eharaeterize this situation by stating that the "optieal ereep 
funetion" is simply a eonstant8). This eonstant is ealled the 
stress optieal eoeffieient. 
The value of flow birefringenee measurements for rheo-
logieal investigations on polymer melts is based on this 
linear stress-optieal rule. From this statement it should be 
elear that one of the subjeets of investigation - theoretieally 
and experimentally - must be to seareh for the limits of 
validity of this rule. As will beeome apparent in that whieh 
foliows, this rule holds good in a wide range of temperatures 
2 

and of other parameters interfering with the characteristic time 
scale of the material, as there are deformation rates and 
frequencies. As a consequence, for polymer melts the mentioned 
disadvantage of the flow birefringence method of being indirect 
appears to be less serious than expected in the beginning. 
In fact, it is abundantly compensated by the achievable high 
accuracy of the birefringence measurements and by the indepen-
dence of these measurements from mechanical boundary conditions9). 
(A famous example for such a condition is the requirement of a 
finite stiffness of the spring, recording the normal thrust in 
a cone-and-plate rheometer10).) 
The surprisingly wide range of valiqity of the ll.near 
stress-optical rule has been linked to similar experiences 
gathered with rUbbers 11 ). As a matter of fact, rubber ela~ti­
city has been ascribed to a mechanism which is characterized 
by the decrease of entropy associated with the orientation of 
network chains, which occurs when 
a stretch is applied 
to the sample. In this picture stresses and birefringence are 
caused by the same physical process, the chain orientation. 
So it does not come as a surprise that, as a first approximation, 
a simple proportionality is found between (entropie) stresses 
and (orientational) birefringence. Fortunately, since the mean 
square root of the end-to-end distance of a Gaussian coil is 
rather small compared with the length of the stretched mole-
eule, at rather large macroscopic deformations deviations 
from the linear stress-optical rule are stillimperceptible. 
With unbounded increase of the strain, however, orientation and 
birefringence approach saturation whereas the entropy con-
tinues to decrease without limits. In fact, the entropy change 
accompanying a complete alignment of chain segments must be 
minus infinity. (This is only a statement of principle. In real i-
ty, non-entropie stresses will be built up much earlier for rea-
sons of network topology and chain statistics.) Anyway, from this 
qualitative discussion one can guess that the ratio of the 
measured birefringence to the corresponding stress difference 
should finally deviate in a downward direction from the value 
of the stress-optical coefficient. This has actually been 
found for polymer melts subjected to very high tensile 
3 

stresses by Bogue und cooperators 12 ). In the overwhelming 
majority of experiments, however, which are relevant for 
practical situations in polymer processing, stresses appear 
to be too small for deviations from the linear stress-optical 
rule. In particular, this holds for all experiments in shear 
flow, as will be seen in the experimental part of this mono-
graph. 
The relationship between a rubber and a polymer melt 
is not only used in making the linear stress-optical rule 
plausible. It also serves as a starting point for the 
development of useful quasi-linear constitutive equations 
of the single integral type, viz. the temporary network 
or rubberlike liquid models. An advantage of these models 
is that the linear stress-optical rule follows directly 
from the basic conception. 
Many very useful flow birefringence results were 
obtained on polymer melts before, in the mid seventies, 
a rapid development of the mentioned models started. These 
early experimental results will be incorporated in the first 
chapter of this monograph. They may help to convey the feeling 
to the reader that the measurement of flow birefringence re-
presents a useful and very interesting method in polymer melt 
rheometry. Only this feeling will enable the reader to work 
through the survey of theories in the second chapter. 
1.1.2 So me Theoretical Basic Concepts 
Before a more detailed discussion can be continued, 
some basic concepts must be introduced13). Since polymers will 
be discussed in their liquid (molten) state, a 90nvenient 
start will be from the classic equation for a fluid, viz. 
from Newton's law. This law reads in tensor notation: 
g, = 2n II -
p 1.. 
(1.1.1) 
where g is the (symmetrie) stress tensor, n is the shear 
viscosity, p is the hydrostatic pressure being a negative 
4 

"traction" and 1J is the rate of strain tensor defined by: 
.•• (1.1.2) 
In this latter equation v is the fluid velocity and V is the 
Nabla operator, with 
dV.

] 
• .. (1.1.3) 
For convenience, the rate of strain tensor will 
be specified for the two most important flow fields, viz. 
that of rectilinear shear flow and that of elongational flow. 
In Cartesian coordinates these flow fields are 
given by the following equations: 
V1 
= 
YX 2 
v 1

EX 1 
v 2 
= 
0 
v 2

v 3 
= 
0 .. . (1.1.4) 
v 3 
= 
-(E:.!2)x 3 
... (1 .1 .5) 
where y is the shear rate and t is the rate of elongation, 
the vi being the components of the fluid velocity in the 
three coordinate directions. (In the shear situation the 
1-direction is the direction of shearing, the 2-direction is 
perpendicular to the shearing planes, the 3-direction is the 
neutral direction. In the case of elongation the 1-direction 
is the direction of extension. These directions coincide with 
the axes of the orthonormal "laboratory frame".) With the aid 
of eq. (1. 1 .2) one obtains from eqs. (1. 1 • 4) and. (1 . 1 • 5) the 
following matrices for the respective rate of strain tensors: 
••• (1.1.6) 
for shear flow and 
5 

o 
(D) 
= 
-( gf2) 
••• (1.1.7) 
o 
for elongational flow. As is well-known, shear strain y is 
defined as the tangent of the angle by which a material plane, 
originally perpendicular to the 1-direction, is rotated by this 
deformation. A little more should probably be said about the 
tensile strain E (i.e. the Hencky measure of strain), from 
which the rate of elongation E is derived. 
The tensile strain 
E is derived from a consideration usual in the description of 
the stretching of a solid rod. In fact, Hooke's law in elonga-
tion reads: 
= 
... (1.1.8) 
where 011 is the tensile stress, E is Young's modulus and 
ß E is defined as: 
••• (1.1.9) 
where R. o is the original length and ßR. is the increase of 
length due to the influence of 011' ßR. 
being small compared with 
R. o . In a direct generalization one obtains a differential equa-
tion for Hencky's strain measure. It reads: 
.•• (1.1.10) 
where R. is no longer the original length of the sample but its 
momentary length. An integration of eq. (1.1.10) leads to: 
••• (1.1.11) 
where 
A is the stretching ratio, which is equal to unity for 
the unstretched sample. 
6 

If eq. (1.1.11) is differentiated with respect to time, 
one obtains the above mentioned rate of elongation, viz.: 
E: = R./JI, = ~/A 
••• (1.1.12) 
The original length ~o has disappeared from this equation, as it 
should be for a suitable strain rate measure for a fluid. 
Finally inserting the matrices of eqs. (1.1.6) and 
(1.1.7) into eq. (1.1.1), one obtains two well-known laws for 
shear and elongation. For shear one finds: 
012 = n y 
(1.1.13) 
which is Newton's law in its original formulation. All the other 
deviatoric components of g are zero (cf.eq. (1.1.6». For elongation 
one has the only non-zero deviatoric component: 
(1.1.14) 
which is Trouton's law, 3n 
being the Trouton viscosity. The 
normal stress 022 perpendicular to the stretching direction 
has been introduced in deriving eq. (1.1.14) from the above 
mentioned equations. Since one has the boundary condition 
022 = 0 for a stretching experiment, eq. (1.1.14) describes the 
(true) tensile stress as a function of the rate of elongation E 
The adjective "true" means the tensile stress according to the 
definition of the stress as a force per unit cross-sectional 
area. As in elongational flow the cross-section A of the sampie 
continuously decreases according to the equation 
A ~ = A 
~ 
o 
0 
(1.1.15) 
which is the constant volume assumption useful for fluid flow, 
the tensile force must continuously be adjusted according to 
the relation: 
7 

= F o 
-e: 
e 
(1.1.16) 
if 011 should be kept constant. This is an important experimental 
condition for finite values of 
e: , if a steady state of elonga-
tional flow is to be achieved. 
This latter remark touches an important point. As a 
matter of fact, the realization of a steady flow situation is 
extremely difficult in a tensile experiment. This is in contrast 
to experiments in shear flow, where the realization of a steady 
state is rather easy. In connection with this contrast, very 
different shortcomings become apparent for eqs. (1.1.13) and 
(1.1.14) respectively. 
With steady shear flow of polymer melts one discovers 
very quickly that the shear viscosity is not a constant but 
is extremely shear rate dependent. (The viscosity is said to 
be "non-Newtonian".) With non-steady elongational flow one 
quickly finds that the Trouton viscosity must be replaced 
by 
functions of time. In this latter connection two standard 
experiments should be kept in mind, viz. the creep experiment 
in which at time zero a constant (true) tensile stress is 
"suddenly" applied, and the "stressing" experiment in which 
at time zero a constant rate of elongation is applied. In both 
experiments a steady state situation is reached, in principle, 
after some time. 
It goes without saying that similar standard experi-
ments can also be applied in shear. With shear flow, however, 
one can discover an additional, non-classic effect, viz. the 
formation of normal stresses, as Weissenberg has pointed out 
for the first time14 ). In a cone-and-plate rheometer, i.e. an 
apparatus consisting of a flat plate and a wide angle cone 
with an axis of rotation perpendicular to the plate and an 
apex touching the plate, the formation of normal stresses 
manifests itself in the build-up of anormal thrust. In other 
words, a constraining force, pushing the cone vertically on the 
plate, is needed when a shear flow of a polymer melt is created 
8 

in the gap between the plate and the mantle of the cone. 
A rather primitive but illustrative description of the action 
of normal stresses is given by the notion that streamlines 
act like stretched rubber filaments. As in a cone-and-plate 
rheometer these stream lines are curved and practically closed 
around the axis of symmetry, one observes inward components 
of forces causing a maximum of hydrostatic pressure at the 
place of the apex. This pressure distribution over the gap 
causes the mentioned normal thrust15 ). A striking analogy is 
found with the shear deformation of a piece of rubber: Inter-
estingly enough, it is impossible to create (static) finite 
simple shear deformations (in the torsion of a rod) of rubber 
without application of a constraining normal stress distribu-
tion16 ) • 
It will turn out that it is much easier to understand 
(at least qualitatively) the mentioned time dependent effects and 
the occurrence of normal stresses in shear, than to give a 
description of the non-Newtonian shear viscosity (and of the 
shear rate dependence of normal stresses) in terms of definable 
molecular processes. As a consequence, in this introductory 
context, only the more easy task will be sketched. The simple 
theoretical results obtained will then be placed aqainst the 
experimental facts. In this way, it will be demonstrated, where 
theory must be improved. 
In order to introduce the possibilityto describe 
time effects, the most simple generalization of eq. (1.1.1) 
is to transform this equation into a first order differential 
equation with respect to time17 ). In this way one obtains (omit-
ting the pressure term): 
(1.1.17) 
In this equation 
T is a relaxation time and g(1) is, accor-
ding to Oldroyd, the contravariant (or "upper convected") time 
derivative of g.18) In Cartesian coordinates of the laboratory 
frame this derivative reads: 
CJ 
= (l=CJ/"t 
=( 1) 
() 
(1.1.18) 
9 

The first term on the right side is the usual partial deriva-
tive of g with respect to time t, whereas the second term 
describes the consequences of the fact that the volume element, 
which is assumed to coincide with a small cube at the moment of 
observation, is continuously deforming, so that parts of the 
fluid contributing to the stresses on the surface elements 
of this cube have just been moving into the space of this 
fixed cube whereas others have just been leaving it. From a 
point of continuum mechanics this second term is indispensable. 
It does not vanish in the steady state, when the first term 
on the right is zero. It only vanishes if flow has stopped, 
as is the case in a stress relaxation experiment (see Appen-
dix A). It will become obvious that deviations from the 
predictions of this model must be ascribed to the fact that 
materials, and in particular those containing relatively 
thin and long macromolecules, cannot be described strictly 
in terms of volume elements which are deformed affinely with 
the macroscopic contours of the body. In fact, various types 
of "internal slip" are presently considered to be responsible 
for the non-Newtonian behaviour. It will be clear to the 
reader that difficulties arizing from this problem are of 
a higher order than those occurring with the introduction of 
the time derivative. 
One can consider eq. (1.1.17) as an adequately modified 
equation for the Maxwell element, as considered in Appendix A. 
As a matter of fact, in Appendix A it is pointed out that the 
primitive Maxwell element is describing forces. It does not 
show the way for a transition to the description of stresses 
in a three dimensional body. This is shown by eq. (1.1.17). 
On the other hand, the transition from a single Maxwell element 
to the generalized ~1axwell element, i.e. a large number of 
Maxwell elements with different characteristic constants 'i 
and 
n i 
(or 'i and gi with 'igi = ni) shunted in parallel, 
can immediately be applied to eq.(1.1.17). (In general one 
uses the sequence T1 >T 2>T 3>···T n . ) This procedure is 
necessary in order to approximate experimentally determined 
time dependences of stresses. In this way one obtains 
instead of eq. (1.1.17):

(1.1.21) 
where H(T) is the relaxation time spectrum, as defined in 
Appendix A, gi is the modulus of the i-th Maxwell element 
and 6 is the Dirac o-function. As will be shown in Sections 
2.3.4 and 2.4.2.3,the same model can be expressed as a single 
integral constitutive equation, which reads:

Eq •. ( 1.1.22) is the well-known rubberlike (or elastic) 
11 

liquid model proposed by LOdge. 15) For the first, 
Lodge and wu19) showed the connection between eqs. (1.1.19), 
(1.1.20) and (1.1.22). For details the reader is referred to 
Chapter 2. 
For the present purpose it is easier to use the 
differential form of eq. (1.1.20). The single dot products in 
eq. (1.1.18) must first be calculated. The non-zero components 
of these products read for shear flow: 
[y. ~

In elongation for the 33-component the same result is obtained 
as for the 22-component. 
With these expressions one finds the following 
differential equations for the stress components, where first 
those for shear flow and then those for elongational flow 
are given:

••• (1.1.28) 

It is directly seen that the first three differential 
equations (for shear flow) are coupled among each other 
whereas the differential equations for elongational flow are 
mutually independent. In order to discuss the equations for 
shear flow, one may start by assuming without loss of gene-
rality (since only deviatoric components will be calculated), 
that the initial conditions for the normal stresses in the 
2- and 3-directions are 022 = 033 = O. According to the 
third and forth equation these stresses remain zero at later 
times. As a consequence, the first equation (1.1.27) becomes 
uncoupled. After a solution of this equation is found, one can 
put this solution into the second equation, which is still 
coupled to the first one, in order to calculate 011. This is 
a very interesting situation. It shows how a finite normal 
stress 011 necessarily follows from this set of equations. 
A solution of the uncoupled first eq. (1.1.27) for the 
"stressing experiment" in shear (y = 0 for t 
< 0 and 
y = q = constant for t 
~ 0) is obviously: 
() 
[1 -

012/ Q

••• (1.1.29) 
where n is replaced by g T. This solution is put into the 
second equation (1.1.27). With the aid of the method of the 
variation of the integration constant of the homogeneous 
equation one easily arrives at: 
• •• (1. 1 • 30) 
As in previously described cases, the normal stress 022 = 0 
is incorporated for formal reasons. In fact, as will be seen 
in the experimental section, only the difference 011-022 
can be determined as the "first normal stress difference". 
This has to do with boundary conditions and the pertinent role 
of the hydrostatic pressure p. This pressure shows up in 
eq. (1.1.1) and in the integral form of this model, eq. (1.1.22). 
13 

When looking on eqs. (1.1.29) and (1.1.30) we actually have in 
mind sums over all relaxation times, as indicated in 
eq. (1.1.19). 
With stress relaxation after cessation of steady 
shear flow one obtains the equations: 
= 
g 
T 
e- t / T 
..• (1.1.31) 
and 
..• (1.1.32) 
Whereas the equations for the shear stress are pretty 
symmetric - if eq. (1.1.29) is subtracted from the steady state 
value g T, one obtains eq. (1.1.31) - this does not hold for 
the equations for the first normal stress difference. In 
fact, with stress relaxation, the second equation (1.1.27) 
becomes uncoupled, since the shear rate is zero. The be-
haviour of the shear stress is in accordance with Boltzmann's 
superposition principle (see Appendix A, Sect. A.2.) In other 
words, this fluid model behaves as a linear viscoelastic body, 
as long aS only the shear stresses are considered. On the 
other hand, a comparison of eq. (1.1.30) with eq. (A.84) shows 
that the first normal stress difference is equal to twice the 
stored free energy of the system. It can be calculated, like 
the shear stress, from the experimental values of the storage 
(and loss) moduli G' (and G"), respectively, as indicated 
in Section A.6 of Appendix A. In particular, one obtains for 
the steady state values: 
and 
14

w+O 
••• (1.1.33) 
.•• (1.1.34) 

where w is the circular frequency, at which G" and G' were 
obtained. These equations follow from a comparison of eqs. 
(1.1.29) and (1.1.30) for t 
= co with eqs. (A.61) and (A.60) 
respectively. 
As it turns out that the first normal stress 
difference is twice the stored free energy 2 F one can 
derive a useful interrelation between three quantities: 
The shear stress, the first normal stress difference, both 
in steady shear flow, and the equilibrium shear compliance, 
i.e. the recoverable shear after steady shear flow at shear 
stress one. According to eqs. (A.25) and (A.26) one obtains: 
J 
= 
e 
• •• (1. 1. 35) 
This equation is, like eq. (A.25), not the result 
of an inversion of the pertinent integral equation. In fact, 
it only gives the ultimate recovery which is found after a 
sufficiently long time elapsed from the moment that the 
shear stress is removed. Eg. (1.1.35) is, moreover, only 
valid for the special fluid model treated in this section, 
in contrast to eq. (A.25), which is generally valid for 
linear viscoelastic bodies. 
In contrast to the largely linear behaviour in shear, 
the fluid model of eqs. (1.1.19) and (1.1.20) behaves very 
non-linear in elongational flow. Independent integration of 
eqs. (1.1.28) yields for the stressing experiment with 
E = 0 for t

Since these equations are obtained with the formal assumption 
p = 0, only the pertinent deviatoric component 011 - 022 
is 
of significance. Only with very small values of TEo one ob-
tains a linear behaviour of the form: 
.•• (1.1.37) 
with n = 9 T. 
If 2 T 80 
~ 1, one obtains a sharp rise of the 
"stressing viscosity" (011 - °22)/8 0 
above the curve for the 
linear case. This occurs already at rather small va lues of the 
total strain 
g = Eot. 
This is due to the contribution of 
the first eq. (1.1.36). The tensile stress grows without 
limit in this case. In practice the filament will break at 
a certain critical elongation. An intermediate situation is 
predicted for 2T 80 
< 1. In this case one obtains a steady 
state of flow after some time. The pertinent elongational 
viscosity is larger than the Trouton viscosity 3n = 3 9 T. 
One finds: 
3 g T 
= 
... (1.1.38) 
(i-he ) (l+Te ) 
o 
0 
Here again, we have to imagine for the right side 
a sum of terms as indicated by eq. (1.1.19). As has clearly 
been stated by wagner20), in every known real case, where a 
steady tensile viscosity was obtainable, it was equal to 
the value or below the value calculated by eq. (1.1.38) with 
the aid of the independently determined relaxation time 
spectrum of the material under consideration. (For the deter-
mination of this spectrum see Sect. A.7 of Appendix A.) 
In other words, the above mentioned "internal slip" causes 
undoubtedly a decrease not only of the steady state shear 
viscosity below the (shear rate independent Newtonian) 
viscosity of our model, but also of the steady state ten-
sile viscosity below the (strain rate dependent) tensile 
16 

viscosity as predicted for the same model by eq. (1.1.38). 
This does not mean, however, that internal slip can always 
prevent the tensile stress from growing to values at which 
the filament breaks. It also does not mean that experimental 
steady state tensile viscosities cannot show a more or less 
pronounced increase at intermediate tensile strain rates. Only 
in the limit of very low strain rates or total strains the de-
scribed model predicts experimental results correctly, as will 
be shown later. This finding is in accordance with the concept 
of linear viscoelasticity, as described in Appendix A 
and expressed among others by eqs. (1.1.33) and (1.1.34). 
At the end of this section an empirical relation should 
be mentioned which connects results, as obtained in the linear 
range of material response (viz. storage and loss moduli as 
functions of circular frequency), with the non-Newtonian steady 
shear viscosity. One has: 
neq) 
In*ew)1 für w = q 
(1.1.39) 
where In*(w)1 = ~(n'(w)2 + (n"(w)2 is, according to eq.(A.5), 
the absolute value of the complex dynamic viscosity. This is 
the famous Cox-Merz rUle 21 ), for which no good explanation has 
been found until now. In the limit of q + 0 it becomes identical 
with eq. (1.1.33). Only recently, w. Gleissle114 ) proposed empi-
rical relations between (non-linear) steady state shear stresses 
and first normal stress differences on one side and the respec-
tive transient linear quantities (eqs. (1.1.29) and (1.1.30) on 
the other side, which are of a similar nature as eq. (1.1.39). 
1.1.3 Short Review of Mechanical Techniques of Measurements 
As this monograph is dedicated to the optical 
measurement of flow birefringence, only a short survey will 
be given of the basic concepts in rheometry. The knowledge 
of these techniques seems indispensable for the understanding 
of 
polymer rheology in general and the usefulness of the 
17 

flow birefringence measurements in particular. Several very 
useful textbooks are available to the reader, who wants to 
complete his knowledge13) 22) 23) 24). As a consequence, in the 
present context a merely illustrative description may suffice. 
1.1.3.1 
Apparatus for the Measurement of 
Dynamic Shear Moduli. 
As a first example the description will be given 
of an apparatus which has been serving as device for the 
measurement of the dynamic shear moduli (storage modulus 
G' and loss modulus G") as "functions.of the circular 
frequency25). This apparatus has specially been designed 
for the work on polymerie melts in a frequency range from 
10-3 to about 300 rad/sec 26). The latest version in aseries 
of designs of growing perfeetion has recently been de-
scribed by the author's former cooperator K. te Nijenhuis 27 ). 
A schematic drawing of this apparatus is shown in 
Fig. 1.1. This apparatus furnishes accurate data in the 
range of medium and very low frequencies, where the loss 
angle (see eq. (A.9» 
differs only little from ninety 
degrees. In this range the polymer melt is a typical 
elastico-viscous fluid. (If the loss angle is found to be 
nearly 
zero, the body should be called a visco-elastic solid.) 
The highly viscous polymer melt can, in general, be 
suspended between the concentric cylinders. It does not flow 
out of the gap, in general, in the time needed for the 
measurements. The filling of the gap between these cylin-
ders is accomplished at room temperature, where the polymer 
is asolid. For the purpose, a hollow cylinder of adequate 
dimensions is turned on a lathe from a rod of the polymer. 
This cylinder is put into the gap. When heated the polymer 
expands a little bit and produces a tight fit with the 
cylinder walls. The inner cylinder of the apparatus, as 
manufactured from stainless steel or aluminium, is suspended 
between two torsion wires. The upper one is connected to

the driving shaft. The lower one, which is relatively thin, 
is cOhnected to the bottom of the outer cylinder. It is 
mainly intended to keep the inner cylinder centred. The 
driving shaft performs an oscillatory rotation (exactly 
sinusoidal with respect to time) around the common axis 
of the parts of the system. If the angular amplitude of 
this oscillation is small enough, also the inner cylinder 
acquires, through the interaction with the polymer, a sinus-
oidal oscillation of the same frequence, but with a smaller 
amplitude and a phase shift 
~ . The obtained amplitude ratio 
and phase shift are consequences of the combined'influences 
of the rheological properties of the melt, the intertia of 
the inner cylinder and of the torsional stiffness of the 
upper torsion wire. (The lower one is chosen thin enough 
for producing a 
disregardable influence.) The sinusoidal 
response of the inner cylinder is assumed as a consequence 
of the linear behaviour of the polymer melt. One can check 
the validity of this assumption easily by varying the 
19 

amplitude of the drive. As long as the material behaves 
linearly, the obtained va lues of the moduli are independent 
of this amplitude. As is well-known, polymer melts behave 
linearly up to surprisingly high values of the shear 
amplitude. 
The shear moduli are obtained from the following 
equations:

upper wire, w is the applied eireular frequeney, I is the

In order to avoid shear waves in the fluid, one has 
to check whether the wave length of such a wave starting from 
an oscillating flat boundary surface into an infinite elastico-
viscous medium is large enough compared with the gap width of 
the apparatus. One can rather easily show that this wave length

time that the density of the fluid is mentioned in this mono-
graph. Probably, this is the most sensitive proof whether

polymer melts or not. As a matter of fact, with

order of only 2 mm. This result for high w is the most 
critical one. 
1.1.3.2 The Cone-and-Plate Rheometer (Rheogoniometer). 
This type of rheometer is extremely well-known. It 
has been described in textbooks and monographs. It has originally 
been designed by K. weissenberg14 ) in order to determine simulta-
neously the shear stress and the first normal stress difference 
in a sheared fluid. So far, J. Meissner10 ) has achieved the 
highest degree of accuracy and reliability in performing measure-
ments on polymer melts with the aid of this "rheogoniometer". 
For the reader, who is interested in more details, reference is 
made to the originalliterature and to monographs. Here we are 
interested only in the principle. 
As already mentioned, the apparatus consists of a flat 
plate and a cone, the axis of the cone being perpendicular to 
the plate and the apex of the cone resting on the plate. The 
21 

cone angle, between axis and mantle is chosen only a few degrees 
less than ninety degrees. Such a cone is sometimes called a 
flat cone. As a consequence, the complementary angle, from the 
plate to the mantle of the cone, which is called the gap angle, 
is a more characteristic quantity. 
If the fluid of interest 
is contained in the rather narrow gap between the plate and the 
mantle of the cone, and one of these parts is rotated around 
the axis of the cone, one obtains a rather simple field of flow. 
To a good approximation the rate of shear y is the same every-
where in the gap and given by: 
(1 .1 .44) 
where Wc is the angular velocity of the rotation and Wm is the 
(small) gap angle. This situation is sketched in Fig. 1.2. 
If the gap angle becomes too large, secondary flow becomes 
rather pronounced. The components of this flow are in the 
plane of the drawing. If inertia effects in the fluid are 
negligible, as in our case, one finds only a secondary flow 
which is due to the elastic properties of the fluid. It is

22 

effectively suppressed by interna I friction, if the gap angle 
is small. In this way stream lines become almost circles 
around the axis, as already mentioned. A detailed description 
of the stress-distribution in the gap is given in Lodge's book15 ). 
An important point is the assumption that the fluid boundary 
at the open rim has the shape of a sphere with the apex of the 
co ne as a centre and that the normal stress at this surface 
is zero. The created shear flow is only approximately 
rectilinear at a point P: The 1-direction is tangential to 
the stream line, the 2-direction is tangential to a circle 
which has the apex of the cone as a centre and lies in a 
meridional plane through tlie rotational axis, the 3-direction 
is radial. Thus, the boundary condition at the rim is 033 = o. 
Under these conditions one obtains: 
••. (1.1.45) 
••• (1.1.46) 
where R is the radius of the massiv cylinder which carries 
the cone on its top (see Fig. 
1.2), Ma 
~s the torque needed 
to produce the rotation and Fa is the normal thrust as caused 
by the sheared fluid, which must be counterbalanced by a 
very stiff leaf spring, on which the other end of one of the 
axles rests. 
Principal difficulties arise with this apparatus at high 
rates of shear and at short times after the start-up. At high 
rates of shear no steady state can be achieved, apparently becau-
se of the fact that the open rim of the polymer melt sta~ts to 
tear in. As by such an effect the effective radiuß starts to de-
crease with respect to R, the measurement of the torque is more 
strongly affected than that of the normal thrust (the torque de-
creases faster than the normal thrust), as can easily be deduced 
from the different powers of R occurring in eqs. (1.1.45) and 
(1.1.46). On the other hand, the situation is less favourable for 
the normal thrust measurements than for the torgue measurments in 
the case of the start-up. The bUild-up of the normal thrust is 
retarded by "squeeze damping". This expression was coined by 
23 

A.S. LOdge30). The effect itself has been investigated exten-
sively by J. Meissner 10). It is connected with the (necessarily) 
finite stiffness of the mentioned leaf spring. In fact, the 
normal thrust is measured with the aid of the deflection of 
the spring: No deflection, no measurement. However, if the 
part of the unit, which rests on the spring, undergoes an 
axial displacement, this displacement is accompanied by 
radial fluid flow in the gap. As the fluid is highly viscous, 
the mentioned damping occurs. Meissner successfully evaded this 
damping by chosing not too large radii Rand not too small gap 
angles. He used gap angles up to 10 degrees (8 degrees as stan-
dard). In fact, one cannot raise the stiffness of the spring 
unrestrictedly. With increasing stiffness of the spring 
one obtains smaller and smaller deflections. Soon one obtains 
an apparatus which is too sensitive to thermal expansion. 
1.1.3.3 Capillary and Slit Rheometers. 
Capillary and slit rheometers have extensively been 
used in the past for measurements at high rates of shear, 
where measurements with the cone-and-plate rheometer become 
difficult. Capillary and slit rheometers also form the basic 
devices for the measurement of flow birefringence in the 
2,3- and 1,3-planes, as will be shown later. The basic 
principles of these rheometers are very similar. In fact, the 
slit rheometer is also a type of capillary rheometer, the 
cross-section of the "capillary" being rectangular instead 
of circular31 ). Such a rectangular cross-section, of which one 
side (the "width" of the slit) is .at least ten times as long 
as the other side (the "depth" of the slit) , provides several 
advantages. One of them is the possibility to insert elec-
tronic pressure gauges with a flat top smoothly into the 
large sidewall in order to measure the pressure inside the 
slit capillary. As is well-known, the pressure drop over a 
certain distance along the capillary furnishes, when related 
to the volume flow rate, the classical measure for the 
viscosity of a fluid. With cylindrical capillaries of proper 
24 

diameters (of the order of one millimeter, like the depth of 
the slit) the curvature of the inn~r capillary surface is 
too high for the use of apressure gauge fitting into the wall. 
As a consequence, more complicated methods must be used in 
order to obtain the pressure gradient along the capillary. 
For flow birefringence measurements flat glass windows can 
smoothly be mounted into the large side walls of the slit 
rheometer. Also this possibility does not exist for a cylin-
drical capillary. With rectangular cross-sections, however, 
one must be careful in avoiding unknown consequences for the 
flow field if a non-Newtonian fluid of apriori unknown 
properties is investigated. However, as J.L.S. Wales and 
J.L. den Otter32 ) have shown experimentally, it is safe to take 
a slit width w of at least ten times the slit depth d -
as indi-
cated already in the beginning. In fact for a Newtonian fluid one 
can calculate that the contribution to the flow resistance caused 
by the small side walls becomes negligible compared with 
that caused by the large side walls, if w/d is larger than ten33 ) • 
This conclusion should hold to at least the same degree of accu-
racy for a non-Newtonian fluid, because with such a fluid the 
zones of high shear rates are more concentrated near the walls 
than with a Newtonian fluid (Flow is more "plug-like"). (See 
also 34).) In this way one reduces the problem to a two dimen-
sional one, viz. the flow between parallel plates of infinite 
width. A more detailed description of the evaluation of experi-
mental results will now be given. 
First, the procedure for cylindrical capillaries will 
be discussed. As with these capillaries no useful pressure 
measurements can be carried out in the capillary, the pressure 
must be measured in the reservoir in front of the entrahce to 
the capillary. A possible experimental arrangement is shown in 
Fig. 1.3. 
In this arrangement the volume flow rate Q is 
determined by the speed of 
a piston moving downward through 
the cylindrical reservoir. The pressure measurement occurs at E. 
For Q one has: 
Q

where Rr is the radius of the reservoir and Vr is the piston 
speed. As ne ar the entranee there is a serious pressure drop 
due to the elastie resistanee of the polymer melt, one has 
to try to eliminate this entranee effeet by the use of 
eapillaries of various lengths Le • When the pressure P reeorded 
in the reservoir is plotted versus the redueed eapillary length 
LeiRe (where Re is the eapillary radius), one obtains a 
straight line, if measurements at the same value of Q are 
eompared and all eapillaries have the same radius. One has 
aeeording to Bagley35): 
(1.1.48) 
26 

where 0w is the required shear stress at the wall and nB is 
a correction term slightly varying with Q and also with the 
ratio Rc/Rr • Apparently, the entrance pressure drop can 
formally be taken into ac count by replacing Lc by an effective 
length Leff = Lc + nBRc . In rewriting eq. (1.1.48) as 
° = P R /2L ff one easily recognizes that this equation 
w 
c 
e 
follows from a simple balance of the forces acting on the 
fluid cross-sections at the ends and on the side wall of the 
capillary. In doing so one traditionally assumes that 0w is 
the same everywhere along the sidewall. As will turn out later, 
this is a rather unrealistic assumption for an elastico-viscous 
fluid. In fact, because of the time dependence of properties 
the transition between the states of motion in the reservoir 
and in the capillary cannot be located sharply at the entrance. 
The second quantity which is needed for the calculation 
of the fluid viscosity is the reduced flow rate (or "apparent" 
shear rate) qa: 
4 Q/n: R 3 
c 
(1.1.49) 
For a Newtonian fluid qa is simply equal to the shear rate at 
the wall, the velocity profile in the capillary being para-
bolic. Thus, the ratio of ° over q 
directly furnishes the 
w 
a 
desired viscosity. For a non-Newtonian fluid, however, qa 
differs from the true shear rate qw at the wall. 
In a surprisingly early state of the development of 
rheology Weissenberg and Rabinowitsch36 ) (and, independently, 
Mooney37)) discovered a method by which this problem could be 
overcome. Assuming that the velocity of the fluid at the wall 
is zero (no slip condition) they derived the famous equation: 
d log qa 
d log a 
] 
(1 • 1 • 50) 
w 
Since in general a plot of log qa vs. log 0w is almost 
linear, the application of this equation is very easy. Because, 
27 

due to shear thinning, the slope of the mentioned double 
logarithmic plot is always (except for a Newtonian fluid) a 
little higher than unity, one has 
qw ~ qa' 
For the slit with infinite width one obtains a 
similar relation which reads 13 ):

where the z-direction is chosen in the direction of flow. 
For obvious reasons, data obtained with capillary 
type rheometers are always used as steady state data. Sur-
prisingly enough, no clear discrepancies with other steady 
state data have been observed until now, except for one case 
treated below. 
Rather recently, for measurements on polymer melts 
a special stressmeter was graf ted on the slit rheometer by 
A.S. Lodge and coworkers38). This stressmeter is based on the 
principle of the measurement of the "hole pressure". This effect 
was discovered with polymer solutions, when normal stress 
distributions in a cone-and-plate rheometer were measured with 
the aid of apressure gauge mounted in the wall of achamber, 
which was connected by a (narrow) hole to the place in the 
rheometer, where the local normal stress should be measured. 
In this and similar cases there was a second (practically) 
flat wall opposite to the wall in which the pressure hole was 
drilled. W.G. pritchard39 ), using a pressure-distribution 
28 

apparatus with a (flat) co ne rotating in a "sea" of the test 
liquid contained in a tray with flat bot tom serving as the 
plate40), observed that the level of the "traction" (negative 
pressure) on the plate was everywhere in the gap enhanced by 
the same amount, irrespective of the ratio h/d of the distance 
h between the walls and the diameter d of the hole. (This 
ratio was varied by a factor 27.) 
For the case that inertia effects can be neglected, 
theoretical studies by K. Higashitani and W.G. Pritchard41 ) 
and by D.G. Baird42 ) furnished the following relations between 
the normal stress differences and the value Pe* of the "elastic 
hole pressure" (dependent on the type of hole):

is the "hole pressure" with P1 being the pressure measured with 
a transducer mounted flush in the opposite wall (with its centre 
line exactly coinciding with that of the circular hole or lying 
in the central plane of the slot) and P2 being the pressure in 
the hole. As usual, N1 and N2 are abbreviations for the "first 
normal stress difference" 011 -
022' as described in Section 
1.1.2 and the "second normal stress difference" 022 -
033 
(which is zero for the primitive fluid model discussed in the 
mentioned section). 
This effect can easily be understood qualitatively, 
if the stream-lines are considered as stretched rubber fila-
ments: In front of the hole the stream-lines deviate slightly 
from straight lines. They show a convex curvature towards 
29 

the hole. At suffieiently low Reynolds numbers Re =P h 2y/4 n 
(with P being the density of the fluid and h the distanee 
between the walls) the pattern of stream-lines should be 
symmetrie with respeet to the eentre line (or plane) of the 
hole. As a consequence of the elastic tensile stress acting 
in the direction of the stream lines, a stress eomponent is 
created which tends to suek the fluid out of the hole. This is 
expressed by eq. (1.1.55). 
In Fig. 1.4 the recently published apparatus is shown. 
Melt input (from extruder), static mixer, bleed, gear pump 
and band heaters fulfil their obvious functions. By the symbols 
Gi the locations of thermocouples are indicated. Rather close 
to the exit of the slit die three pressure transducers T1 , T2 
and T3 are indieated. Transducers T3 and T1 are mounted flush

wall of a transverse slot (application of the seeond eq. (1.1.54».

The pressure difference P3 -
P1 , when divided by the distance 
between the centres of the transducers, furnishes an excellent 
measure for the shear stress 0w at the slit die wall (see 
eq. (1.1.53))- The pressure difference P1 -
P2 furnishes the 
corresponding hole pressure. The determination of the first 
normal stress N1 = 011 -
022 with the aid of this hole pressure, 
however, seems to be rather tricky. The main reason may lie, 
according to Lodge, in the fact that the level of the pressures 
measured is rather high, because of the high viscosity of poly-
mer melts extruded from the slit die, whereas particularly the 
difference P1 -
P2 is rather low, so that a small misalignment 
of the centre of T1 with respect to the location of the trans-
verse slot can cause a substantial error. A minor leakage 
through the slot or too large a diameter of the diaphragm of 
transducer T1 can spoil the measurements. (With a considerable 
pressure gradient along the slit die the diaphragm will be 
deformed in a complicated way.) However, the measurements by 
Lodge and de Vargas on two low density polyethylene melts do 
not indicate systematic deviations from N1-values obtained 
for the steady state with the aid of two different rheogonio-
meters. On the other hand, the scatter of the data is rather 
large, probably pointing to some instability in the apparatus. 
This interesting development will no longer be pursued in the 
context of the present monograph, however. The description of 
further details would certainly be beyond the scope of this 
monograph on flow birefringence. 
1.1.3.4 Tensile Rheometers. 
A well-known tensile rheometer in nature and in 
industry is the spinneret. Certainly, one has to think of 
rather different types in the mentioned two cases. However, 
there is no doubt that the spider makes use of the tensile 
properties of the fresh spider-thread instinctively. 
Moreover, this thread is formed by a macromolecular sub-
stance too. On the other hand, melt spinning of synthetic 
fibres is an important industrial activity nowaday43). However, 
31 

the principal interest in tensile flow is not restricted to 
applications in this industrial branch. As a matter of fact, 
rather low molecular mass materials are used in this branch. 
These materials behave practically like Newtonian fluids. So, 
one cannot learn too much from tensile rheometry for those 
materials. On the other hand, applications of high molecular 
mass materials are well-known in film blowing or in the 
manufacture of plastic bottles and large vessels. Last 
not least it should be stated that there also exists a funda-
mental interest in tensile rheometry: As already indicated 
in Section 1.1.2, shear experiments alone cannot furnish 
sufficient information about the type of constitutive equation 
applicable to the material under consideration. 
A big disadvantage of an experiment, in which a 
liquid thread is drawn down from a spinneret, is the non-
uniform flow field in the thread. In such an experiment one 
can easily observe that the filament has a cross-section 
varying in the direction of the extension. After an initial 
increase of the diameter, which happens just behind the exit 
from the spinneret hole and is due to some recovery from 
the shearing in that hole, this diameter decreases conti-
nuously until the point where the thread is wound up in 
some way. Theoretically the most simple case is the one in 
which the thread is drawn through a thin fluid of equal density. 
Since in this case, in which body forces are absent and sur-
face tension is negligible, the stretching force must be the 
same over the whole free length of the thread, the true tensile 
stress continuously increases toward the end. The same holds 
qualitatively for the rate of elongation e. In an extreme 
case the thread grows thinner and thinner near its end so that 
the constant linear speed of the winding-up mechanism becomes in-
sufficient to carry away as much material (in the unit of time) 
as is extruded from the spinneret. In such a case one gets a 
pulsating stretching force. The relatively thick thread exuding 
from the spinneret does not undergo a sufficiently high tensile 
stress. In fact, the appropriate stretching force can no longer 
be transmitted by the thin end. As a consequence, an almost un-
stretched filament moves down the line until it reaches the 
32 

winding-up mechanism. At that moment the stretching force suddenly 
44) 
increases. This pulsation has been called draw-down resonance 
• 
It has nothing to do, however, with an interaction between 
elastic and inertia forces. In melt spinning the thin end of the 
fibre is strengthened by the fact that it is cooled down. From 
this consideration it becomes obvious that a tensile rheometer 
for fundamental investigations must be of a lower complexity. 
An extremely successful apparatus has been developed 
by J. Meissner45 ). In Fig. 1.5 a sketch of this apparatus is 
given. A cylindrical rod of the polymer to be investigated 
is floating on the surface of a thermostated silicone oil 
bath. As the densities of the molten polymer and the silicone 
oil are not too different, the polymer rod is almost completely 
immersed. At a distance Lo from each other two pairs of 
rollers Z1 and Z2 (with ribbed circumference) 
serve as clamps 
which continuously renew their grip on the fluid material. 
Clamp Z1 is mounted on a leaf spring together with a small 
constant speed motor M1 which propels the rollers of Z1'

The deflection of the leaf spring, which is a measure for 
the tensile force, is recorded with the aid of transducer W. 
The second clamp Z2 is rigidly mount~d and connected through 
an extensive gear-box system to a variable speed motor. 
Whereas the motion of the rollers of Z1 only serves for the 
mentioned renewal of the grip, the motion of the rollers of 
Z2 predominantly determines the rate of elongation, which 
should have the same value everywhere in the liquid rod, 
provided that the thickness of the rod and the temperature 
are sufficiently uniform. During the course of the experi-
ment the cross-section of the rod between the clamps becomes 
continuously smaller. As a consequence, with constant roller 
speeds the measured force shows a considerable decline during 
the experiment. At a certain stage of the experiment a number 
of scissors, as arranged at equal distances LA along the rod 
(T1 , T2 •.• T11 in the figure), can be activated simulta-
neously. In this way the sample is cut into pieces of equal 
length. If these pieces are taken out of the bath after a 
sufficient time, another very important quantitiy can be 
measured, viz. the ultimate recovery as a function of the 
applied stretching time (or total elongation). At the same 
time, a comparison of the recoveries of these pie ces 
furnishes a very sensitive check for the uniformity of the 
stretch in the whole sample. The same apparatus can also 
be used for tensile creep experiments. (The previously 
described experiment is a "stressing" experiment.) For the 
creep experiment the speed of the rollers of Z2 is continu-
ously adjusted in order to keep the true tensile stress 
constant at the desired value, which means that the tensile 
force must be adjusted according to eq. (1.1.16), where E 
is 
measured by an integrator. 
An alternative apparatus was originally proposed 
by F.N. cogswel146 ) 47) and developed further by H. Münstedt48 ). 
A schematic drawing of this apparatus is given as Fig. 1.6. 
In this apparatus the condition of constant true tensile 
stress is achieved with the aid of a cam providing the 
adequate lever to every Hencky strain E 
so that a constant 
load can be used. In a later development a computer was

used instead of the cam. In this way a variety of experi-
ments can be realized, among which the stressing experiment 
and recoil (recovery) as a function of time. As no clamps 
can be built in, in which the grip on the sampIe is renewed, 
the most tricky point is the clamping of 
the sampIe. 
Münstedt succeeded in gluing sampIes to the endsurfaces 
of metal parts replacing the clamps. For the purpose he 
used a synthetic two components glue. The sampIe surfaces 
were etched with the aid of nitric acid before gluing. 
1.1.4 Some Illustrative Results of Mechanical Measurements 
The short review given in this section should not 
be considered as representative for the field of mechanical 
measurements on polymerie melt. The selection of topics is 
made certainly a little onesidedly in view of the optical 
measurements to be discussed in later sections. We shall start 
with the source of our basic knowledge for the application of 
35 

quasi-linear theories, viz. the oscillatory dynamic measure-
ments. 
1.1.4.1 Dynamic Shear Moduli as Functions 
of the Circular Frequency. 
In Fig. 1.7 storage and loss moduli G' and G", re-
spectively, are plotted for a low density polyethylene 
(LDPE) Melt I, as extensively used by Meissner and others 49 ) , 
against reduced circular frequency aw , where a is the well-
known shift factor of the time-temperature superposition prin-
ciple which is described in Appendix B. As indicated in the

ture 1500 C was chosen. In Fig. 1.8 the pertinent shift 
factor ais plotted as a full line against 1/T, where T is 
the absolute temperature50). This is the first example, as 
given in this monograph, for the usefulness of the time -
temperature superposition principle in widening the "experi-
mental window". The circles in this figure show that the same 
shift factor also holds for non-linear extensional results 
as will be showu later. The curves drawn through the 
experimental points of Fig. 1.7

obtained as the best fits with the aid of a line spectrum accor-
ding to eq. (A.98) of Appendix A. In Table 1.1 this spectrum is

At this point it should be emphasized that much 
more characteristic diagrams of log G' and log G" vs. 
log aw were obtained for polymers with a narrow molecular 
mass distribution. As is well-known, the molecular mass 
distributions of polyethylenes are always very broad. Only 
a few types of polymers can be prepared in larger quanti-
ties with an extremely narrow distribution of molecular 
masses, Mw/Mn being 1,01 or less, where Mw is the weight 
(or mass) average and M is the nurnber average relative mole-
n 
cular mass. These "monodisperse" polymers are polystyrene, 
polyisoprene and polybutadiene. In a well-known paper by 
G.V. Vinogradov et al. 51 ) one finds results for the latter 
two polymers. The most beautiful results, however, were ob-
tained by S. Onogi, T. Masuda and K. Kitagawa52 ) on aseries 
of "monodisperse" pOlystyrenes. With the aid of the time-tempe-

that with increasing molecular mass the plateau region in 
G' becomes broader and broader and has a level independent 
of the molecular mass. From this level one can calculate 
the average molecular mass Me of chains between entangle-
ments according to the well-known equation furnished by

stressing experiments in shear and in elongation are summa-
rized for low density polyethylene IUPAC material A which 
is very similar to Melt I discussed above. The temperature 
of the measurements was 1500 C. Besides actual results of 
the mentioned stressing experiments also stressing "visco-
sities" (o12 /q ), as calculated from dynamic mechanical 
measurements according to an equation similar to eq. (A.89) 
are shown. The equation in question is the one (derived) 
by F.R. Schwarzl. If allowance is made for the scatter of experi-
mental results, one may arrive, according to Meissner, at the 
conclusion that the curve for the stressing "viscosity", as

Meissner 10). Dashed lines connecting open circles

calculated from dynamic measurements, forms the (upper) envelope 
for the experimental curves obtained in shear, whereas the 
threefold of this calculated stressing viscosity forms the 
(lower) envelope for the experimental curves obtained in 
elongation (cL eqs. (1.1.12), (1.1.14) and (1.1.37)). These 
envelopes are valid for the strictly linear cases which 
are approximated also by the curves for q = 0,001 s-1 and 
-1 
'0 = 0,001 s 
. (For the experiments in shear one should 
not be bothered about the fact that the curves obtained at 
42 

the lowest rates of shear start below the envelope. This 
delay in response is due to the finite stiffness of the 
torsion bar in the rheogoniometer and has been discussed 
extensively by Meissner.) For shear experiments the curves 
obtained at increasing rates of shear start to depart 
(in a downward direction) at decreasing lapses of time. 
A similar behaviour with respect to the moments of departure 
is shown by the curves for the elongation experiment. (These 
curves depart from their envelope in an upward direction) . 
However, for total deformations (y = q.t and E = Eot) up to 
about one they follow the envelopes also at high rates of 
deformation (q and &0' respectively). A valuable supplement 
with regard to the behaviour of the first normal stress diffe-
rence will be shown below with the aid of flow birefringence. 
However, since normal stresses in shear do not belong to the 
realm of linear viscoelasticity, the fluid model of Section 
1.1.2, eqs. (1.1.22) and (1.1.27), must be used for a compari-
sone One finds that this rubberlike liquid model describes also 
the normal stress behaviour up to y = 1 fairly weIl. At higher 
shear deformations interna I slip apparently starts to play 
a role. The same conclusion is also supported by the experi-
ments in extension notwithstanding that the upward turns in 
the curves for 80 = 1, EO = 0,1 and EO = 0,01 (and several in-
termediate values of 
EO ) are qualitatively correctly described 
by this model. Apparently, interna I slip is less influential 
in elongation. Finally, also in elongation the experimental 
curves lie below the curves for this rubberlike liquid (which 
shows strain hardening in elongation: See the comments in 
Section 1.1.2). 
Another interesting fact ~s demonstrated in Fig. 1.11. 
Experimental points indicated by a cross and connected by a 
dashed line (abbreviation CVM) 
stand for the results obtained 
with a capillary viscometer. These measurements were obtained 
with the aid of the method outlined in Section 1.1.3.3. 
According to this method one finds an apparent steady state 
value of the shear viscosity for every shear rate at the wall 
(cf. eq. (1.1.50)). On the curves, as obtained for the different 
shear rates applied in the stressing experiments, one looks up 
43 

the points, where the "steady state" viscosities of the capilla-
ry experiment match the respective stressing viscosities. In 
this way one obtains apparent residence times for the fluid 
in the capillary. These times are of realistic magnitudes. 
The most striking 'result, however, is that these "steady state" 
viscosities are tao high, all tagether. Apparently, the 
steady state has not been reached in the capillary. 
In reality one measures same average value of the stressing 
viscosity which, after passing a maximum at extremely short 
times (presumably before the entrance to the capillary) 
steadily decreases during the passage of the fluid through 
the capillary. 
This conclusion is corroborated by measurements 
obtained in a slit-capillary at another low density poly-
ethylene. These results are shown in Fig. 1.12. In this

figure the pressure profile along the slit capillary , as 
obtained for several shear rates at one of the large side 
walls of the slit, is shown32 ). An inspection of these curves 
easily reveals that the pressure does not drop linearly with 
the distance from the entrance. If the tangents to the pressure 
profiles at the exit (z = 110 mm) are used as (dP/dz) in 
eq. (1.1.53), one obtains the best values of 0w (and of the 
respective viscosities). However, for low density polyethy-
lenes this improvement does not seem sufficient. This will 
be shown with the aid of flow birefringence measurements. 
On the other hand, flow birefringence measurements will also 
show that for several other ("normal") polymers capillary 
viscometry must yield useful steady state viscosity measure-
ments. Probably, linear polymers behave as "normal" polymers 
whereas highly branched polymers, like low density polyethy-
lenes, behave quite differently. 
After taking the necessary precautions, steady state 
shear viscosities and first normal stress differences can 
readily be obtained with the aid of the rheogoniometer for 
low density polyethylenes, as Fig. 1.13 shows 49 ). For high 
rates of shear a gap geometry, as modified according to 
w. GleissIe, was used53 ). Also some capillary measurements 
were used in completing the high shear viscosity data. Exten-
sive use was made of the time-temperature superposition prin-
ciple. (In this connection the reader is reminded that also the 
shear rate occurring in the denominator of the·definition of 
the shear viscosity must be reduced according to the rule that 
q, as obtained at T, must be replaced by (aq) at reference 
temperature To (like w ». In this figure the origin of dashed 
and full lines can be explained only much later. 
The question, whether a steady state of elongational 
flow can be reached with low density polyethylenes at high 
rates of elongation, is still not completely solved. According 
to most recent measurements by T.A. Raible, A. DemarmeIs and 
J. Meissner the stressing viscosities go through a maximum 
before reaching steady state values at rather high levels 55 ) •

On the contrary, such a steady state can rather 
easily be obtained for polystyrenes. A rather long time aga 
R. L. Ballmann obtained results which suggested that the be-
havior of polystyrene is Newtonian (or better "Troutonian") in 
elOngation56 ) . Recent more refined measurements 57 ) show that there 
is a slight maximum at intermediate values of elongational rate so. 
This is shown in Fig. 1.14 for the steady state elongational 
viscosity as a function of tensile stress*. These measurements 
*) Footnote: Also results of tensile creep experiments are shown 
in Fig. 1.14. This type of experiments will be treated in the 
next section. For the steady state situation, however, there 
is no difference with the stressing experiment.

indicate only a slight strain hardening for polystyrene melts. 
The pertinent measurements were carried out with the second 
apparatus described in Section 1.1.3.4. As will be shown in 
the part of this monograph, where flow birefringence results 
are discussed, this strain hardening effect is, no longer 
perceptible for onesided compression (i.e. at negative 
elongation rate EO ) in the case of polystyrene. 
The measurements described so far all belong to the 
class in which flow history is prescribed whereas' the stresses 
which are the consequences of the flow history, are measured. 
There is still another standard experiment belonging to 
this class, viz. the stress relaxation experiment, which 
starts at the moment that flow is stopped. In shear experi-
ments we also have a relaxation of the first normal stress 
difference. A special case is the stress relaxation after a 
sudden step in the strain. Several experiments have been 
47 

devoted to these subjects in the past 49 ). For our present 
introductory purpose, however, these experiments are skipped. 
For the fluid model of Section 1.1.2 pertinent calculations 
were sketched in the mentioned section: For the relaxation of 
shear stress after the cessation of slow steady shear flow (li-
near behaviour) one observes that this experiment is equivalent 
to the stressing experiment (cf. eqs. (1.1.29) and (1.1.31)). 
This does not hold for the first normal stress difference 
which is always non-linear, in principle (see flow birefrin-
gence experiments in later sections). If tensile experiments 
are considered, the observation is made that relaxation of 
the tensile stress after steady elongational flow is equiva-
lent to the pertinent stressing experiment, if linear beha-
viour is preserved which is the case only at extremely low 
elongational rates Eo . 
1.1.4.3 Prescribed stress. 
A completely different class of experiments has not 
yet got the proper attention so far in this monograph (except 
for some remarks in Appendix A). This is the class of experi-
ments for which the equations of Section 1.1.2 should be 
inverted in order to describe the strains as functions of 
the prescribed stress histories. The most important experi-
ments of this class are the creep experiments, in which a step 
in the stress is applied at zero time and this stress is kept 
constant for the duration of the experiment, and the recovery 
(or recoil) experiment, in which the stress is removed at the 
beginning of the experiment and is further kept zero. 
For a physically meaningful inversion one needs at 
least two equations of the type of eq. (1.1.20). In fact, if 
there is only one relaxation mechanism the pertinent re-
tardation times are zero and infinite. (One Maxwell element 
can be replaced by two Voigt elements in series, of which 
one has a zero dashpot resistance (T 1 = 0) and the other 
has a zero spring constant (T 2 = 00).) With two Maxwell 
elements in parallel retardation time T 1 becomes finite, 
48 

so that the creep and recovery curves get more realistic 
shapes. (No longer an instantaneous recovery is predicted.) 
As a consequence of the occurrence of the terms in the 
brackets of eq. (1.1.18) the inversion for the fluid 
model of Section 1.1.2 becomes more complicated for the 
(non-linear) extensional case. For the moment, experimental 
results in creep and recovery will be presented in order 
to draw the attention of the reader to the fact that only 
half the story has been told so far in Section 1.1.2. 
In analogy to Fig. 1.11 a figure of almost the same 
comprehensiveness was produced by H. Münstedt and H.M. Laun50) 
for creep experiments on LDPE IUPAC A. This figure is re-
produced here as Fig. 1.15. As is pointed out in Appendix A, 
eq. (A.36), the tensile compliance D(t) is one third of the 
shear compliance J(t). As a consequence, in this figure the 
results of extension lie below those for shear, in contrast 
to Fig. 1,11. The shear compliance J(t) for the linear 
viscoelastic behaviour (longest upper full line) was 
calculated directly from dynamic mechanical measurements 
of J' (w) and J"(w) according to Schwarzl's method (See 
Section A.6 and eqs. (A.11) .)*) One observes that for shear 
stresses of 50 and 2000 Pa (N/m2 ) linear behaviour is found. 
At 012 = 10 000 Pa,however, one finds a curve for y(t)/012 
which deviates with increasing time from the linear behaviour 
in an upward direction. By the mentioned authors this function 
y(t)/012 is called a non-linear compliance J(t). This name 
is not strictly correct but convenient**). In the lower part 
of the figure we notice that at a tensile stress of 500 Pa 
the material still behaves practically linearly. At higher 
tensile stresses, however, non-linear tensile compliances

linear modulus are comparable with non-Newtonian viscosity.

D(t) are found which are lower than the linear one. This 
is another evidence for the strain hardening of low density 
polyethylene in extension. These tensile creep measurements 
were not only carried out at 1500 C. In the original paper 
a typical set of measurements in the non-linear region, 
at a tensile stress of 3,1x104 Pa, was carried'out at ten 
temperatures from 120 to 180o C. From the application of the 
time-temperature superposition principle to these non-linear 
measurements shift factors were obtained which exactly fitted 
those obtained in linear shear experiments (See Fig. 1.8). 
In shear creep a typical mixed experiment is possible. 
Whereas the shear stress is prescribed and kept constant, 
50 

not only the shear y(t) is measured but also the build-up 
of the first normal stress difference. Measurements of this 
58) 
type have been published by M.H. Wagner and H.M. Laun 
. In 
the same paper also recovery was measured as a function of 
time elapsed from the moment that the shear stress was 
removed. (Simultaneously the relaxing first normal stress 
57) 
difference was determined.) Only very recently 
, also after 
tensile creep this time dependence of the recovery was 
measured for a polystyrene melt (with the aid of the appara-
tus, described in Section 1.1.3.4). In previous publications 
only the total recoverable shear Yr and the total recoverable 
extension Er were given. With these quantities the recoil 
after an infinite (or at least sufficiently long) time was 
meant. If these quantities are quoted as functions of time 
(Yr(t) or 
cr(t)), always the time of previous shearing or 
stretching is indicated, and not the time elapsing during 
recovery.

apparently almost complete recovery, as with a cross-
linked rubber, is obtained (See the line 
E = E.) In his 
r 
1971 paper Meissner published very similar results 45). In the 
paper by Laun and Münstedt total strains were achieved, however, 
which were higher by two units in the Hencky strain measure. 
If, according to Münstedt and Laun, the results of 
the previous figure are plotted as reduced recoveries 
Er/Co 
against the stretching time (instead of the total strain) , 
one obtains an interesting result, shown in Fig. 1.17. In 
this figure the reduced recoverable strains for all stretching 
rates, as indicated in the previous figure, fall nearly on 
the same line which is calculated for the linear öehaviour of 
the polymer sample*). Interestingly enough, samples apparently 
break just before a non-linear effect in the reduced recovery 
beeomes notieeable. A eomparison with Fig. 1.11, however, 
shows that the stressing viseosity has eonsiderably increased 
above the value predieted by the linear theory, before frae-
ture of the sample oeeurs. For polymers other than (branched) 
low density polyethylene, plots like those of Fig. 1.11 and 
Fig. 1.15 show smaller deviations from the respeetive linear 
eases.

xation time spectrum. If there existed a useful molecular 
theory for polymer melts permitting the calculation of 
the spectra from molecular parameters (such as average 
molecular mass or molecular mass distribution, chain 
stiffness parameters and the like) the importance of 
dynamic mechanical measurements would be lower.' At 
the moment, however, we are not in the position to 
predict the linear behaviour of polymer melts exactly. 
The situation is less favourable for the non-linear 
behaviour which is so important for industrial processes. 
Only recently we have got some hope that the situation 
will quickly improve in the near future. The pertinent 
progress will receive more attention in Chapter 2 and 
Chapter 3 of this monograph. It will not be easy, however, 
to solve all non-linear flow problems properly. We will 
be happy to get a plausible explanation for the deviations 
from linear behaviour for intermediate ranges of deformations 
53 

and deformation rates. Experimental results, as obtained 
under rather extreme circumstances have been published 
S9) 
by G.V. Vinogradov and cooperators some time aga 
. These 
results were obtained on polybutadienes and polyisoprenes 
of extremely narrow molecular mass distributions and show, 
in an extreme manner, the influence of this distribution 
on the non-linear flow properties. In Fig. 1.18 the beha-
viour of a polybutadiene of a sharp molecular mass of 
2,4x10S is demonstrated for capillary flow at a tempera-
ture of 2SoC. A plot is given of apparent shear rate q a 
(eq. (1.1.49)) versus shear stress 0w at the capillary wall.

For the undiluted polymer Newtonian behaviour is found up 
to a eritieal shear stress where the flow behaviour abruptly 
ehanges into plug flow, with slip at the wall. The authors eal-
led this phenomenon "spurt". If the polymer eontains inereasing 
amounts of a plastieizer (methyl naphthalene or diheptyl phtha-
late), one observes a eontinuous transition of the spurt into 
normal non-Newtonian flow. The authors stress that low 
moleeular mass material, as eontained in a polymer with 
a broad moleeular mass distribution, eauses a similar 
effeet as a plastieizer.

As to the linear behaviour, at this stage of the 
presentation only a few facts will be quoted. As is weIl 
known for more than twenty years, the zero shear viscosity 
(wh ich is also given by eq. (1.1.33» 
increases with the 
3,4-th power of the molecular mass M. As T.G. Fox and 
others60) have shown by very accurate measurements, there 
exists a critical molecular mass Mc ' which depends on 
the type of the polymer. Below this mass the zero shear 
viscosity is simply proportional to Mw• The M3,4-relation 
holds above Mc • These results are widely quoted. A useful 
impression is conveyed by Fig. 1.19, as taken from F.W. Bill-
meyer's book61 ). According to R.S. Porter and J.F.Johnson62 ) 
there is an approximately linear relation between Me of 
eq. (1.1.56) and M , M being about twice M • In Table 1.3,

the data of these polystyrene samples are collected. As all

from steady state shear stresses and first normal stress 
differences measured on aseries of monodisperse polysty-
renes. For th.e purpose, eq. (1.1.35) was used under the 
assumption that, in the limit of small shear stresses, the 
fluid model of Section 1.1.2 is valid for polymer melts 
(which has meanwhile been shown to be true9).) The results of 
this compilation·are shown in Fig. 1.21. From this figure 
one can see that a linear relation between Je and M seems 
to exist for low molecular masses (see the inserted line 
with unity slope). For high molecular masses, however, Je 
seems to be molecular mass independent. 
For tensile experiments there does not exist a 
possibility to measure the stored free energy of the sampIe 
separately in order to use an equation of the type of 
eq. (A.25). On the other hand, this does not matter, since 
Decan rather easily be measured directly with the aid of

In the hope that the reader is enabled to grasp the 
main features of polymer melt rheology as relevant for flow 
birefringence studies, the present author will try to give 
an introduction into the latter field in the following sections. 
1.2 Flow Birefringence Measurements 
1.2.1 Principles of Measurement 
If a filament of a polymerie melt is stretched, it 
becomes birefringent in general. For useful measurements, 
however, a circular cross-section of the filament is not 
very convenient. In fact, even if the polymer thread is 
embedded in a fluid like silicone oil, in which it is inso-
60 

luble, there always remains a certain difference of refrac-
tive indices between sampie and surroundings. As a consequence, 
the polymer thread acts as a cylindrical lens. An increasing 
loss of light is encountered if the thread grows thinner and, 
at the same time, uncertainty arises about the length of the 
light path through the sample. T. r~tsumoto and D.C. Bogue69 ) 
experienced great advantages with the use of sampies possessing 
the shape of a strip. They checked that, in spite of the lower 
symmetry of the cross section, no noticeable deviations from 
the simple cylindrical symmetry of the deformation, charac-
teristic for cylindrical sampies, was observed. In fact, 
width and thickness of the sampie decreased practically by 
the same factor, when the sampie was stretched. With a strip 
no difficulties were encountered with respect to any un-
pleasant lens effect. The only remaining complicationwas 
that the thickness of the sample and, with it, the optical 
path difference continuously decreased, when the sample was 
stretched, which occurred for example at a constant rate of elon-
gation ~o ("stressing experiment"). 
The simplest way to measure the changing optical path 
length is to count the number of extinctions and to note 
the times of their oc~urrence durinq, say, a stressinq experi-
ment. In fact, every time an extinction ("fringe") passes by, 
the optical path difference is increased or diminished by one 
wave length. White light can be used to distinguish between 
increasing and decreasing orders. This method,'however, is 
only applicable with a sampie showing a high optical sensiti-
vity. In many cases, however, investigators had their recourse 
to calibrating the light intensity, as observed through 
crossed polarizing sheets or prisms. For the purpose, bi,refrin-
gent standards were used. The accurate measurement of quickly 
changing optical path differences still forms achallenge 
worth while to be taken up by clever physicists. (cf.Appendix C.) 
One advantage of extensional experiments, however, 
clearly is that there is no doubt about the directions of 
the principal axes. If the true tensile stress 
~o = 01 - 0ll = 011 -
022 
is not too high (probably less than 
61 

106 Pa), one observes a linear stress-optical rule: 
L'.n = C L'. 
(J 
(1.2.1) 
where 
L'.n = n I -
nII = n 11 -
n 22 is the difference of prin-
cipal refractive indices between the directions of the stretch 
and perpendicular to it, and C is the stress-optical coeffi-
eient. An expression, relating C to the optical anisotropy 
of the chain moleeules is borrowed from the theory of ideal 
rUbbers 11 ). It reads: 
2rr 
C = 45kT 
(1.2.2) 
where n is the average refractive index of the material and 
u 1 -
u 2 is the difference of polarizabilities of the random 
link in Kuhn's model. For more details see Chapter 2. 
With experiments in shear the situation is a little 
more complicated. If also for this type of flow the linear 
stress optical rule is accepted -
no deviations have so far 
been observed - one has to realize that this rule, viz. propor-
tionality of the deviatoric components, certainly also means 
coaxiality. 
As shown in Section 1.1.2, the proposed simple fluid 
model exhibits a first normal stress difference 011 -
022 
in shear flow. If one assumes -
as for solid bodies - that 
the stress tensor is symmetrie (oik = 0ki)15), one obtains 
three principal axes. As is well known, on material planes 
perpendicular to these axes no shea~ stresses are observed. 
It immediately follows from this fact and from symmetry 
that the 3-direction (neutral direction) coincides with 
one of the principal axes, say the III-axis. As a consequence, 
the other two principal axes must lie in the plane spanned 
between the 1- and the 2-directions. Since on a plane 
perpendicular to the 2-direction the shear stress is applied, 
the 2-direction certainly does not coincide with one of the 
two remaining principal axes. As a consequence, the cross 
62 

of these two axes must necessarily be inclined with respect 
to the direction of flow (1-direction). The position of this 
cross is given by a single angle X , which can arbitrarily be 
chosen smaller than or equal to 45 degrees. Consistently, one 
chooses as the first principal axis (the I-axis) the one clo-
sest to the flow direction (1-direction). The situation is 
sketched in Fig. 1.23. 
If the tensor components in the laboratory coordinate 
system are expressed by those in the frame of the principal 
axes, one simply obtains: 
2°12 
= ß ° 
sin 2X 
°11 - °22 = ß ° 
cos 2X 
°33 
= 
°rII 
with 
ß ° = 
°I - °rr' 
(1.2.3) 
where 0 1 , all and 0 111 are the principal stresses and X is 
the mentioned orientation angle. Since the first two equations 
are already given in deviatoric component, it is quite easy

to introduce the linear stress optical rule eq. (1.2.1) into 
these equations. In this way one obtains: 
= (lm/C) sin 2X 
(1.2.4) 
crll -
cr 22 = (ßn/C) cos 2X 
(1.2.5) 
where the same angle X is called the extinction angle in 
flow birefringence measurements. The light beam for these 
measurements is directed along the neutral or 3-direction. 
Details of the arrangement of these measurements will be 
given together with the description of the various types of 
apparatusses. For the moment it should suffice to say that 
a truly rectilinear shear flow cannot be created in practice, 
as has already been mentioned in connection with the de-
scription of mechanical apparatusses in Sections 1.1.3. 
Additional problems with flow birefringence measurements in 
the 1,2-plane are those created by the windows needed in order 
to avoid meniscus formation. In fact, there is always a 
distortion of the ideal flow field in the vicinity of side 
walls in which the windows are placed. The problem is 
serious, as the light beam passes through these zones of 
rather high "parasitic" birefringence. How one can cope 
successfully with this problem will be shown in the next 
section. Quickly changing optical path differences are only 
found when transient situations are considered, as occur 
e.g. at the beginning of a stressing experiment in shear or 
during stress relaxation. 
Owing to the much lower symmetry in the shear experi-
ment, when compared with the symmetry of the uniaxial 
extension, one has two other 
interest"ing flo~ birefrin-
gence measurements. If the walls between which the fluid 
is sandwiched, are made of glass, the light beam can be 
directed along the 2-direction. If one of these glass walls 
is moved parallel to the other at a fixed distance, a 
birefringence 
. .• (1.2.6) 
64 

is created. As a matter of fact, this method has been used by 
F.D. Dexter, J.C. Miller and W. PhilippOff70) in the first 
well-defined flow birefringence experiment on polymer melts. 
Later this method was modified by J.L.S. Wales with the aid 
of a slit capillary71). 
A third method uses a light beam directed along the 
stream lines. In such an experiment a 
(1.2.7) 
is determined. According to W. Philippoff72 ) and to J.L.S. Wales73 ) 
one can profitably use a capillary viscometer for this purpose, 
directing the light beam in an axial direction through the 
capillary. Window effects as weIl as entrance and exit effects 
can be coped with by using varying capillary lengths. 
Since the fluid model sketched in Section 1.1.2 does 
not predict a difference between 022 and 033 (zero "second 
normal stress difference" 022 - 033)' for this model there 
should be no difference between 011 -
022 and 011 -
033' 
(as obtained from measurements according to eqs. (1.2.5) 
and (1.2.6)). At the same time, 
nn2 ,3 should be zero, as 
originally found by Philippoff for some polymer solutions. 
With polymer melts, however, Wales could clearly demonstrate 
that 
nn2 ,3 differs from zero. In fact, these, flow birefringence 
measurements are the only known measurements on melts, in 
which the anisotropy in the 2,3-plane is directly demonstrated 
in ~ single measurement. Since it is quite certain that 
'022 -
0331 
is always much smaller than 1 
°11 -
° 221, 
this is an important advantage. With mechanical measurements 
one usually needs two separate experiments in a cone-and-plate 
and in a parallel plate apparatus or an accurate radial 
13) 15) 
pressure profile in the cone-and-plate apparatus 
. Because 
of the difficulties with localized pressure measurements at 
elevated temperatures, the latter profile has not yet been 
determined for polymer melts. Accurate measurements only 
exist for sOlutions74 ). Recent progress in the molecular theory, 
65 

which will be discussed in Chapter 3, shows quite clearly 
that the occurrence of a finite second normal stress difference 
is related to the "internal slip" briefly mentioned in Section 
1.1.2. 
It should also be emphasized that eq. (1.2.4) forms 
the most important source for the determination of the 
stress-optical coefficient. If 
Än, X and 012 are determined 
at several shear rates q in the steady flow situation, one 
can make a plot of 
Än sin 2x versus 012. This plot turns 
out to be linear in all investigated cases, its slope being 
equal to 2C. Originally, this procedure was proposed by 
A.S. LOdge7). W. Philippoff tried it out successfully on 
polymer solutions6 ). A full proof of the linear stress-optical 
rule includes acheck of the coaxiality. For the purpose, 
one also needs mechanical measurements of the first normal 
stress difference. This comparison has been made for the 
first by J.L.S. Wales for polymer melts 64 ) 75) 
1.2.2 A Survey of Flow Birefringence Techniques Suitable 
for Polymer Melts 
By far the largest amount of work on flow birefrin-
gence of polymer melts has been done in shear experiments. 
However, in order to emphasize the importange of work in 
elongational flow, this survey will be started with the 
description of two apparatusses so far proposed 
for this type 
of work. The optical problems of the measurement of bire-
fringence effects are discussed in Appendix C. 
1.2.2.1 Arrangements for the Measurement of 
Flow Birefringence in Elongation. 
In a paper published in 1977 T. Matsumoto and D.C. 
Bogue69 ) give a schematic representation of their apparatus 
for simultaneous stress and birefringence measurements on 
66 

fluid polymer strips in a stressing experiment, under iso-
thermal as weil as under non-isothermal conditions. The 
latter conditions are of great interest in connection with 
practical processing conditions, e.g. melt spinning. They 
are also of interest in connection with the judgement upon 
the usefulness of constitutive equations. For the moment, 
however, we are mainly interested in the mechanical and 
the optical part of the apparatus and not in the temperature 
control. The pertinent features of the apparatus are given 
in Fig. 1.24. 
The parts of the arrangement are indicated in the 
caption to the figure. The mechanical system is apparently 
inspired by Meissner's apparatus. We find a pair of rollers

the sampIe is directly connected to a load cello (The tempe-
rature in the chamber is regulated by a stream of hot air 
or nitrogen. Temperature changes can be effectuated by additi-
onal radiant heaters.) The temperature in the vicinity of the 
sampIe is measured with the aid of a thermocouple P. The op-
tical alignment consists of a helium-neon laser (wavelength 
\ = 632,8 nm), as indicated by letter 0, apolarizer E, a slit F, 
an analyser Hand a photocell I. 
If an anisotropie medium producing an optical path 
difference r 
("retardation") is introduced between crossed 
polarizer and analyser with one of its principal directions 
under an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the direction 
of the polarizer, one observes (according to Appendix C.2) a 
light intensity I which is related to rand the wavelength \ 
of the light by: 
I = c sin 2 (nr/\) 
••• (1.2.8) 
where the factor c depends on the apparatus as weIl as on 
absorption or scattering by the sampIe. Fortunately, the 
latter two effects are negligible for sufficiently clear 
sampIes of the polymer. The factor c can be obtained by cali-
bration with the aid of solidified sampIes, their retardations 
being measured before with the aid of a conventional method 
(any type of a usual compensator). In Fig. 1.25 the result of 
such a calibration is shown, where I is given in arbitrary 
units with c = 50,5. As it is aprerequisite to the intended 
investigation, the results of this type of measurement must 
be independent of the (changing) thickness of the sampIes 
(absorption and scattering must be negligible!). The numbers 
near the measured points, which indicate the thicknesses of 
the sampIes used in the calibration, show that no influence of 
thickness is perceptible. Finally, in Fig. 1.26 
one finds 
acheck for the correctness of the assumption that the fluid 
strip shows practically the same deformation as a cylindrical 
filament. In fact, for polystyrene sampIes at various tempera-

Results, as obtained with this apparatus, will be discussed 
later. 
At this point, it should be mentioned that B.E. Read76 ) 
used periodi~ changes in elongation of prestretched samples (in 
order to prevent buckling) for his measurement of dynamic 
birefringence. He used a stroboscopic light source, its flashes 
being locked to the vibration of the sample. In this way he 
could measure the birefringence at any point of the cycle with 
the aid of an ordinary compensator. 
Recently, also results with a quite different type of 
apparatus have been obtained77 ). In this apparatus a nearly 
uniform negative rate of elongation (8 < 0) is produced. One 
may call this type of strain a one-sided compression. It has 
frequently been tried to produce such adeformation by 
squeezing the polymer sample between parallel plates. However, 
in order to avoid shearing near the surfaces of the plates, which 
move perpendicularly to the fluid flow, one needs an extremely 
effective lubrication. The demands on the .quality of lubrication 
seem to be considerably reduced in an apparatus which approxi-
mately produces a flow which is sketched in'Fig.1.27. In 
this type of "stagnation flow", which is symmetric around the 
Z-axis, two streams enter along the positive and the negative 
Z-axis and impinge on each other in the plane of symmetry, where 
the stagnation point lies in the origin of the chosen'coordinate 
system78). If fluid flow is enveloped in an id~ally lubricated 
solid surface 
IzIR2 = A (= const.) 
(1.2.9) 
one may hope to obtain at least approximately the desired flow 
field, which is given in cylindrical coordinates (z, r, ~) by:

to twice the rate of biaxial extension (in the plane of

pression. It is defined as:

where dz/dt

If the flow is ideal, 0zz has the same value at every point

In the described stagnation flow 0zz and EZ are both negative. 
In a practical case which has led to the construction 
of an apparatus fpr the simultaneous measurement of stress and 
birefringence several years ago, fluid flow is guided by a 
solid surface, as given by eq. (1.2.9). This surface envelopes 
the fluid over distances between 0,5 and 5,5 mm from the plane 
of symmetry. Over this span of distances the radius R changes 
from 10 to 3 mm, with A of the order of 50 mm3 • The pertinent 
compression ratio \ is (0,5/5,5) = (3/10)2 = 0,09. The corres-
ponding Hencky deformation is: 
€ = 
in \ = -
2,4 
... (1.2.15) 
This Hencky deformation, however, turnes out to be the 
minimum deformation in the fluid occupying the space within 
a distance Z2 ( = 0,5 mm) on both sides of the plane of symmetry. 
In fact, for a fluid layer at a distance z 
< Z2 one has: 
(1.2.16) 
where Z1 
( = 5,5 mm) is the z-value where the transition from 
the cylindrical "inlet-pipe" to the trumpet shaped guiding 
surface occurs. (The pipe is assumed to be suitably lubricated 
so that deformationless plug flow occurs in it.) From eq. 
(1.2.16) one can easily derive the average deformation of the 
material in the above mentioned space, characterized by 
z 
~ Z2. It turns out to be: 
(1.2.17) 
This finite value of the average is obtained notwithstanding 
72 

the fact that for z = 0 the Hencky measure of eq. (1.2.16) 
becomes equal to minus infinity. 
Independently, H.H. Winter, C.W. Macosko and K.E. 
Bennett78 )published a theoretical analysis of several types of 
stagnation flows and introduced this nomenclature for the 
present purpose. 
In the mentioned practical version of the apparatus 
two cylindrical parts are lined up along the positive and 
negative Z-axes, respectively. Both parts have a central 
cylindrical bore with a trumpet-shaped exit of suitable dimen-
sions facing the symmetry plane. The rims of these trumpets are 
placed on opposite sides of the plane of symmetry at a mutual 
distance of 1 mm, according to the dimensions given above. 
In each cylindrical bore a piston fits slidingly. These parts 
are made of nitrided steel. The whole arrangement is shown in 
Fig. 1.28. 
When the apparatus is filled (with a lubricated bobbin 
of the polymer of suitable shape), the pistons are in their outer-
most positions. After heating and melting the polymer, the 
operator activates the piston movement. If the speeds of both 
pistons are equal, the polymer approximately moves according 
to eq. (1.2.10), at least when approaching the plane of symmetry. 
The melt leaves the unit through the ring-shaped clearance 
between the trumpet rims. One of the cylindrical parts is 
rigidly connected to the optical bench on the ground plate. 
The other cylindrical part freely moves horizontallyon small 
ball-bearing tables along the mentiqned bench. The drive 
system of the pistons is constructed in such a way that the 
reaction forces (as caused by friction of the pistons in the 
tubes and by axial polymer flow in these tubes) are absorbed 
by the thrust bearings rigidly connected to the cylinders. 
(See the simplified representation in the figure where the 
screw gear at the re ar of one piston is shown.) The trans-
mission by cog wheels serves for an imperceptible contribution 
of the outer drive system to the axial force on the cylinders.

In this way, the axial force on the cylinders is 
exactly identical with the separation force experienced as a 
consequence of the impingement of streams in the plane of 
symmetry. This axial force is measured with the aid of a 
leaf spring mounted at the re ar of the freely moving cylinder. 
This spring is fitted with strain gauges. 
By the mentioned 
separation force the outer rim of the spring is pressed against 
a block rigidly connected to the bench mounted on the ground 
plate. 
The pertinent flow birefringence is measured with the 
aid of a light beam propagating in the plane of symmetry. This 
light beam goes through the stagnation point. Its width is 
determined by the clearance between the trumpet rims. The length 
of the light path through the fluid is determined by the dis-
74 

tance between the windows, which is only slightly larger than 
the diameter of the cylinders. The holder of the windows is 
also used as a vessel in which the fluid, emerging from the 
ring-shaped gap, is gathered. For the purpose, it is heated 
by aseparate heating band. 
As can be seen from the figure, the cylinder which is 
suspended on the ball-bearing tables, is divided into an inner 
and an outer cylinder. The inner one is rigidly connected to 
the thrust bearing of the drive. The outer one can optionally 
be connected to uhe thrust bearing or to the ground plate. 
In this way, one can measure the separation force over the 
whole cross-section, or only over the cross-section of the 
inner cylinder. If a zz is a constant, independent of r, as 
it should be for ideal flow, in both cases the calculated 
separation pressure -
a zz ' i.e. the ratio of separation force 
to the pertinent cross-section, must be the same. In the 
non-ideal real case the apparent separation pressure over the 
inner cylinder is larger than that over the whole cross-
section. This is apparently due to a radial pressure gradient 
needed for the support of radial flow through the ring-shaped 
gap. Assuming a parabolic pressure profile, one can easily 
calculate the approximate separation pressure at the rim, which 
should be the desired material response. Results of this type 
of measurements will be presented in the experimental section • 
. 
The advantage of the described method is that one can 
obtain a steady state situation (which is of importance for 
a simple measurement of flow birefringence and separation 
force). Moreover, in contrast to stretching flow, the flow 
situation in the double trumpet apparatus is stabfe so that 
one can ho pe to measure properties of those fluid materials 
which cannot be stretched. 
Very recently J. Hsu, P. Shirodkar, R.L. Laurence and 
H.H. winter79 ) gave an analysis of the flow of a Newtonian fluid 
in the geometry discussed above with no slip at the walls. 
With the aid of the Finite Element Method they found conside-
rable deviations from the assumed ideal "planar" stagnation 
75 

flow. The mentioned authors promised to publish results for 
the ideal slip boundary condition as weIl. Almost simultaneously 
C.W. Macosko, M.A. Ocansey and H.H. Winter80) published the con-
struction of an apparatus which is, in principle, very similar 
to the apparatus of Van Aken and Janeschitz-Kriegl. However, if 
the latter apparatus is compared with a capillary rheometer of 
cylindrical syrnrnetry, the apparatus by Macosko et al. must be 
compared, as far as its syrnrnetry is concerned, with a slit 
rheometer with a large aspect ratio of the slit cross-section. 
As a consequence, pistons cannot be used. 
The polymer melt 
is provided by a screw extruder. The entrance pressure is mea-
sured with the aid of an ordinary pressure gauge. Birefringence 
is measured in the X,Z-plane, where X is the direction of the 
entering fluid flow and Z is the neutral direction, in which 
the dimension of the apparatus is very large. The light beam 
for the flow birefringence measurements propagates along the 
Y-axis, which forms, together with the Z-axis, the plane of 
syrnrnetry.

of the cone-and-plate apparatus, 
as originally described by J.L.S. Wales and H. Janeschitz-
KriegI82 ), is shown in Fig.1.29. In this apparatus the axis 
of rotation is horizontal. All essential parts are made of 
nitrided steel. As in the previous designs, cone as weIl 
as plate are truncated (pos. 6 and pos. 5): In the centre 
of the unit there is a charnber containing areflexion prism 
which is located exactly at the place where the apex of the 
(full) cone would touch the (full) plate. The cone angle is 
exaggerated in the picture in order to make clear that the 
cone is on top of the rotor. The stationary part is forrned by 
the plate. In previous versions the assignrnent of cone and 
plate was just the other way round. The prevailing idea was to 
have one universal rotor as the plate and several interchan-
geable cones with varying cone angles as stators. According

to Gortemaker, however, there are serious optical reaso~s 
for the preference of the new version. These reasons, how-
ever, can be explained only after a discussion of the 
general working principle of the unit is given. 
In the mentioned charnber a closely fitting cylindrical 
part, not shown in the figure, is contained. It serves as a 
support for the inner window (pos. 3), for· the reflexion 
prism (pos. 2) and for a thrust bearing (with distance piece) 
77 

for the exact positioning of the cone with respect to the 
plate. Not shown is also the outer cylindrical case in which, 
among others, the outer window (pos. 4) is mounted. The 
light beam enters from the right and is reflected into a 
vertical direction by the reflexion prism. The necessary 
optics is placed on a horizontal bench which hinges around 
the axis B-B. Also the reflexion prism is connected to the 
bench and follows the swing of the bench. In this way one 
can achieve, by a once for all adjustment of the polarizer 
(which is mounted on the bench), that the plane of polarization 
always coincides with the plane of incidence of the reflexion 
prism. This is necessary'in order to avoid a change of the 
state of polarization by the reflexion. As a consequence of 
this construction, the position of the bench nicely gives the 
direction of pOlarization of the light beam entering the fluid. 
The analyser (pos. 11), which is arranged in the 
vertical part of the light beam behind the unit, is connected 
by a handle to a support mounted on the bench as welle In 
this way it follows the swing of the bench and remains always 
in a crossed position with the polarizer (i.e. the plane 
of incidence of the reflexion prism). So one simply finds 
the extinction positions of the birefringence, as created 
in the ring-shaped gap between rotor and stator, by swinging 
the bench until extinction is obtained. The position of the 
bench is then read from a vernier scale. This is done f.or 
both directions of rotation of the rotor in order to elimin-
na te uncertainties with respect to the exact tangential posi-
tion to the plate. 
There are two reasons for this complicated construction. 
As a first reason one has to quote the fact that it is not use-
ful to direct a straight light beam through both sides of the 
gap from the lower letter B to the upper letter B. In fact, the 
retardation created in the lower part of the gap would be 
compensated for a great deal in the upper part, as the 
circumferential speed of the rotor surface is reverse in 
the upper part of the gap. The second reason is that, if 
one decides for a polarized light beam virtually originating 
78 

in the centre of the unit, one has to make the best of it 
in avoiding the difficulties arising if the polarizer is 
placed in a heated zone. Only with the described construction, 
where the state of the polarization is not changed by the 
reflexion in the prism, the polarizer can be placed outside 
the hot unit. This arrangement was suggested by J.L.S. Wales 
after years of experience and worked out by F.H. Gortemaker 
t 
I 83) 84) 
e a. 
At this stage of the description an explanation can 
be given for the aavantag~ obtained with the flat stator. 
As a matter of fact, the fluid in the ring-shaped gap - as 
injected through the filling hole (pos. 9) - is completely 
enclosed between solid walls, as there are: the plate 
(stator), two concentric cylindrical walls (in which the 
windows are mounted) and the cone (rotor). Only the latter 
one is moving. It may be clear to the reader that the 
desired flow field is realized (approximately) only at 
sufficient distances from the edges which are confined by 
the two mentioned coaxial cylinders. With a gap angle of 
10 8' and the outer radius of the rotor of 2,5 cm the maximum 
distance between rotor and stator is 0,4 mm, whereas the 
depth of the gap is 10 mm. J.L.S. wales64 ) and, more extensively, 
F.H. Gortemaker, B. de Cindio and H. Janeschitz-KriegI84 ) 85) 
tried to calculate the complete flow field for simple fluid mo-
dels (Newtonian and Ostwald-de Waele power law). Also the influ-
ence of the frictional heat was estimated. Finally, however, the 
decisive insights were obtained experimentally. 
With respect to frictional heat it has been found that 
the light beam is diverted from the normal light path as soon 
as frictional heat produces considerable temperature gra-
dients in the melt. In this way measurements become automati-
cally impossible be fore serious deviations from isothermal 
flow occur. With respect to the edge effect the following can 
be stated. If the light beam passes the gap elose to the 
stator surface, it also passes through what may be called 
the "dead-water" regions near the windows. Experience 
shows that the deviations in the measurement of the extinc-
79 

tion angle are only slight in this case. This will be 
demonstrated below. On the other hand, if the light beam 
passes the gap close to the rotor surface, large deviations 
are observed in the measurement of the extinction angle. 
After all, this is quite obvious, since there are two 
circular singular lines, one at the outer edge, the other 
at the inner edge of the rotor, where the rate of shear 
becomes theoretically infinite. In fact, at these lines the 
rotor surface, which moves at a finite speed, is contiguous 
to the stationary cylindrical surfaces. 
As a next step in the consideration, one has to 
realize that the light beam can never be made to propagate 
closely to the conical surface, independent of the bench 
position. In fact, after being reflected from the prism 
located in the centre of the unit, the light beam automati-
cally propagates in a rigid vertical direction. So it can be 
tangential only to the plate. In fact, if the light beam 
would be made to propagate along the cone in one position 
of the bench, its deviation from the cone surface would be 
rather large in another position of the bench since, with a 
reflexion angle deviating from 900 , the light beam would 
describe itself a cone, when the bench swings around. These 
considerations should suffice to explain the final choice 
for a stationary plate. As is shown in Fig. 1.29, the 
clearances of the rotor are enlarged in order to reduce the 
velocity gradients near its edges as an extra measure. 
In Figs. 1.30 and 1.31 extinction angle curves, as 
obtained in steady flow with the original and with the final 
arrangement of cone and plate, are shown for a polystyrene 
melt at 1700 c. As one immediately notices, the judgement 
of the improvement is derived from evident deviations of 
the extinction angle curve from its expected smooth 
course starting at 45 0 
(2X = 900 ). The vertical dashed lines 
are located at shear rates q where the retardation caused 
by the main birefringence is just a multiple of a whole 
wave length. At these "fringes" the parasitic birefringence 
near the windows is predominant and causes the shown devia-

tions. With the original version extinction angles can be 
-1 
measured for this polymer only at shear rates below 0,1s 
. 
With the new version one can get a good representation of 
the extinction angle curve at shear rates up to about 18s-1 , 
where in capillary flow "melt fracture" occurs. Interestingly 
enough, in the cone-and-plate unit considerable production 
of frictional heat is indicated at 18s-1 by the deflection 
of the light beam. The conclusion may be drawn that flow is 
stable in this cone-and-plate unit (with closed rims) in 
about the same range of shear rates as in capillary flow. 
As Fig. 1.32 shows, the (main) birefringence belonging to 
the shown extinction angle curve increases smoothly. It 
appears that the measurement of the retardation is rather 
insensitive to the (small) parasitic birefringence appearing 
near the windows. The reason why with other polymers than 
polystyrene much less troubles have been experienced, will 
be given in the experimental part. 
Not only the surprizingly high stability of the flow 
in the ring-shaped gap should be stressed. Also should be 
mentioned the high thermal stability of polymers, which are

sensitive to oxygen, when investigated in this apparatus. 
Because of the complete inclusion in solid walls, oxygen has 
no access to the material. J.L.S. Wales64 ) reported measurements 
on a polyethylene at an exorbitantly high temperature of 
2400 C (normal range of processing temperatures 170 -
2000 C), 
where after 1 ho ur the extinction angle curve was unchanged 
and after 6 hours only slightly changed. The birefringence 
curve did not show noticeable changes even after 20 hours. 
Finally, in Fig. 1.33 a unit of the coaxial cylinder 
type is shown. This unit is useful only for extremely low 
rates of shear, where the problem of secondary flow does 
not exist. In this connection, however., the advantage of 
this unit is its high potential sensitivity, which is due to 
the use of a straight light beam. (With the reflexion prism 
of the cone-and-plate unit one experiences always a slight 
deviation from the exact adjustment of the angles, which 
reduces the accuracy of the extinction angle measurement, 
if the flow birefringence is very low.) 
The essential parts of this unit are the internal 
cylinder (pos. 8) which is the rotor, the external cylin-
der segment (pos. 9) and the windows (pos. 10 and 11). The 
filling hole (pos. 13) is also shown. Instead of the external 
cylinder only.a segment is used. This facilitates the filling 
procedure. With this apparatus never more than four shear units 
are applied. With a gap width of 0,97 mm thismeans less than 
4 mm displacement at the circumference of the rotor. The 
height of the cylinder is only 20 mm. With a longer light 
path through the polymer melt one gets great difficulties 
with the adjustment of the light beam. The reason for these 
difficulties lies in the fact that the unit becomes over-
sensitive to small temperature differences between the 
inner and the outer cylinder. Extra heating elements under 
the cover (pos. 14) and under the bottom (pos. 15) are 
indispensible for the compensation of heat losses through 
the shaft (pos. 4) and through the table on which the unit 
is mounted. Only with the aid of these elements the light 
be am can be made to propagate straight through the unit.

The inner cylinder and the segment of the outer 
cylinder are made of aluminium and covered by a black 
dielectric produced by anodizing. In this way, any 
reflected stray light loses its detrimental influence on 
the measurement of extinction angles at extremely small 
retardations, for which the unit is designed. In fact, by a 
84 

"skimming" reflexion from a dielectric surface no phase 
difference is created between the components parallel and 
perpendicular to the plane of incidence. The plane of 
polarization is only slightly rota ted (a few minutes) which 
is of no influence on the measurement 1). One of the purposes 
for which this unit is intended, is mentioned in connection 
with the determination of the tail of the relaxation time 
spectrum in Section A.7 of Appendix A. 
The way in which extremely low birefringence 
effects and the p~rtinent extinction angles can be 
measured is described in Appendix C. In the same appendix 
also the problems with the measurement of quickly changing 
birefringence effects are discussed. 
1.2.2.3 Apparatusses Derived from Slit 
and Capillary Rheometers. 
As mentioned before, the first measurements of the 
flow birefringence on a polymer melt were carried out by 
F.D. Dexter, J.C. Miller and W. Philippoff70) in the 1,3-plane 
of shear flow. Since the apparatus of these authors -
a sandwich 
construction of two glass plates (see Section 1.2.1) - is 
not very convenient for practical use, J.L.S. Wales pro-
posed the use of a slit capillary with rectangular cross-
section71 ). In fact, such an apparatus had been used in the 
early days of flow birefringence by colloid chemists86 ). These 
early investigators, however, did not recognize that such 
an apparatus could also be used for quantitative measure-
ments. In fact, with such an apparatus the light beam 
passes through windows, which are mounted flush with the large 
side walls of the slit rheometer. With such a direction of the 
light beam fluid layers of varying degrees of molecular orien-
tation are passed, so that only an average birefringence seems 
obtainable at first sight. However, Wales was able to show that 
a procedure, similar to the one applied by Weissenberg and 
Rabinowitsch in evaluating the shear rate at the capillary 
wall, can be used to find the birefringence at the large 
85 

side walls of the slit. (With the aid of eqs. (1.1.51) and 
(1.1.53) one can obtain the pertinent values of shear rate 
and shear stress at the large side walls.) Apparently, the 
approximation of the real slit by a slit with infinite 
width (w > 10 d) must also be made here in combination 
with the assumption that the shear stress at the (large) 
side walls is the same everywhere along the slit (linear 
pressure profile, dP/dz = const.). In this way the equation: 
d/2 
= (2/d) 
J 
~nl.3(x)dx. 
o 
• •• (1.2.1H) 
which expresses the mentioned averaging over the depth 
of the slit, can be rewritten as: 
••• (1.2.19) 
where ° = -
(x/2) (dP/dz) is the shear stress at a 
distance x from the central plane of the slit. If this 
equation is multiplied by 0w on both sides and differen-
tiated with respect to this quantity, one obtains: 
••. (1.2.20) 
This equation is in complete analogy to eq. (1.1.51). It 
permits the calculation of the true birefringence 
= 
•.. (1.2.21) 
at the wall, if the average birefringence (n1,3) is 
measured in a sufficient range of shear stresses 0w. 
The extinction directions are always parallel and perpen-
dicular to the flow direction in these measurements. No 
information can be gained from these directions. 
86 

In Fig. 1.34 the apparatus is shown. The same appara-
tus has also been used for studies of velocity profiles by 
J.L. den Otter, J.L.S. Wales and J. SChijf87 ). The central 
part of the unit is the conical mernber V which fits into 
the inner conical surface of part A. Part V actually con-
sists of two halves touching each other in a plane which 
contains the axis of the unit. In one of the touching 
surfaces a flat slot is milled. In this way one obtains 
the desired slit capillary by the cornbination of the two 
halves of mernber V. The width of the shown slit is 10 rnrn, 
its depth is 1 rnrn. The unit contains six glass windows. 
Two of them are shown in the figure. The centre line of 
these windows crosses the gap at a distance of 35 rnrn from 
the entrance. The other two pairs of windows have centre

lines parallel with the large side walls. They are situated 
at the entrance and at the level of the windows shown in 
the figure. The windows fit sufficiently well so that 
noticeable perturbations of the flow field are avoided. 
The temperature of the unit is controlled by three inde-
pendent heating bands H1 , H2 and H3 • The apparatus can 
either be used in combination with a screw extruder for high 
3 -1 
shear rates (up to 10 s 
) or with a ram extruder for the 
low shear rate range (0,5 to 15 s-1). (In fact, only the 
extruder can provide a sufficiently high continuous flow 
rate.) 
Wales also describes measurements in the 1,2-plane 
of the slit (for which he used the other windows). With 
these measurements, however, great difficulties are 
encountered because of the non-uniform birefringence 
distribution. OWing to the natural divergence of the light 
beam, which is aggravated by the consequences of frictional 
heat production (temperature maximum in the centre) , measure-
ments in the high shear rate range become practically im-
possible. In fact, with increasing throughput the number of 
isochromatics continuously increases. In the centre, one 
finds the black zero order fringe. Toward the walls the 
density of fringes increases. The mentioned divergence of 
the light causes these fringes to fuse. If the crossed 
polarizing sheets are turned around simultaneously, one 
expects to see a sharp black isocline moving from one side 
of the slit to the other. This isocline, however, appears 
only as a shadow. 
Interesting results which cast some light on the use-
fulness of rheological measurements in capillaries, will be 
reported in the experimental section. 
As mentioned already in Section 1.2.1, Wales also deve-
loped an apparatus for the measurment of ßn2 ,3 in polymer melts. 
For the purpose, the light beam is directed along the axis 
of the capillary. As a matter of fact, also this technique was 
invented first for the investigation of colloidal solutions88 ). 
88 

Philippoff was the first to use this technique for the 
~easurement on polymer solutions72 ). He did not find a measu-
rable birefringence ßn2 ,3 for these systems and concluded that, 
in accordance with dilute solution theory (which has the 
structure of eqs. 1.1.19 and 1.1.20), this birefringence must 
be zero in principle. Wales, however, found finite values for 
polymermelts73 ). His apparatus is shown in Fig. 1.35. 
This apparatus is derived from a ram viscometer. In 
such a viscometer the piston moves in a vertical barrel. 
The capillary, however, is in an unusual horizontal lateral 
position (pos. I) at the lower end of the barrel. In an 
opposite hole of the barrel window W1 is mounted. The part, 
in which the capillary hole is drilled, shows achamber behind 
the exit of the capillary. This chamber is connected to a

vertical discharge pipe. The second window W2 is located on 
the continued axis of the capillary. If the apparatus works 
properly, barrel, capillary, chamber and discharge pipe are 
filled with the polymer melt. (One can start by filling the 
barrel with granules or with a premoulded rod of the polymer.) 
The optical alignment is also sketched in the figure. 
The light beam passes one after the other through the pola-
rizer P, window W1 , the capillary, window W2 , compensator C, 
analyser A and telescope M. The telescope is focussed at a 
cross-section in the capillary. A rotating quartz compensator 
according to Ehringhaus has been used89 ). It is inserted under 
an angle of 450 with the direction of the polarizer. When the 
polymer melt flows through the capillary, a typical Maltese cross 
is observed in the telescope as long as the compensator is in 
zero position. During compensation the cross splits into two 
fringes which move toward the field's edge which is formed 
by the wall of the capillary. Compensation of the birefringence 
at the wall is achieved when the apices of both fringes just 
merge with the edge. Interestingly enough, the observed picture 
was always sufficiently symmetrie, notwithstanding the fact 
that the flow fields be fore the entrance and behind the exit 
of the capillary are not symmetrie with respect to the axis of 
the capillary. At very high birefringence, however, the 
extinction with the aid of the compensator becomes difficult. 
This is assumed to be the consequence of depolarization effects 
caused by the mixing of light rays due to entrance and exit 
effects, frictional heat production in the capillary and 
beam splitting64 ). The latter effect is perceptible in any 
birefringent medium of considerable thickness, if the direction 
of the light beam does not coincide with one of the optical 
axes. 
The measured birefringence 
= 
(1.2.22) 
at the capillary wall is related to the shear rate and shear 
stress at the wall, as obtained with the aid of eqs. (1.1.48) 
90 

and (1.1.50), respectively. The correction for entrance and 
exit effects is found by the use of capillaries of different 
length, as will be demonstrated in the experimental part. 
1.2.3 Results of Flow Birefringence Measurements 
The purpose of the present monograph is to show, how 
flow birefringence results fit into the mosaic of experi-
mental results obtained with the aid of mainly mechanical 
measurements, and how they can contribute to the solution 
of special problems, in particular with respect to the 
choice of useful constitutive equations. From this point as 
weIl as from a practical point the limits of validity of 
the linear stress-optical rule are of dominant interest. 
Because of this interest the survey of flow birefringence 
results is started with two sections on the linear stress-opti-
cal rule. In later sections, amongst others, questions about 
first and second normal stress differences, capillary rheometry 
and time dependent effects will be taken into consideration. 
1.2.3.1 
The Linear Stress-Optical Rule 
and Its Limits of Validity. 
As can be anticipated rather easily from the 
remarks, which have been made in Section 1.1.1 with respect 
to the link between linear stress-optical rule and rubber 
elasticity, there will be two limits of validity: The first 
one is given by an upper bound with respect to the stress, 
the second one has to do with the time of establishment of 
the internal thermodynamic equilibrium. Only after the esta-
blishment of this equilibrium a chain segment between two ent-
anglements exerts the well-known average (equilibrium) 
statistical force 90) 
on the (temporary) network junctions 
formed by these entanglements. For simplicity and apparently 
also for good physical reasons the assumption has always been 
91 

made that the time scales for the establishment of internal 
equilibrium and for an observable time effect of the bulk 
material are very different. As a consequence, the latter 
time scale must solely be due to the relatively low rates 
of change of the locations of the entanglements. In this 
way the basis laid in the theory of rubber elasticity for 
the validity of the linear stress-optical rule seems pre-
served for polymer melts in most cases. 
As a method for the determination of the upper bound 
in the stress, measurements in elongational flow are very 
useful. In fact, for reasons to be shown below, measurements 
in shear flow do not furnish this upper bound. For the in-
vestigation of the second type of limiting condition, 
dynamic oscillatory measurements seem to be essential.

However, as a consequence of apparent experimental difficul-
ties, there are only a few useful measurements in both areas. 
T. Matsumoto and D.C. Bogue69 ) have been the only in-
vestigators so far, who were able to create high enough tensile 
5 
stresses in a polystyrene melt (Shell TC-3-30, Mw = 2,83.10 , 
M IM 
= 4,6) in order to show a clear 
w 
n 
deviation from the 
linear stress-optical rule in extensional flow (stressing 
experiment with E: 0 = 0 ,075s -1). It should be mentioned, however, 
that the temperatures, at which these high stresses were ob-
tained, were rather low. The suspicion may arise that these 
temperatures are a little too close to the (dilatometric) 
glass-transition temperature of 1000 C (see Appendix B) for being 
representative for the state of a rubberlike liquid (see the 
second limitation). In Figs. 1.36 and 1.37 open symbols

gence and of the tensile stress versus time for the indicated

temperatures. Closed symbols indicate results obtained in two 
non-isothermal experiments with not too different cooling rates 
of the order of 1 Ks- 1 , where the points at the long time 
end are obviously obtained at temperatures in the vicinity of 
the lowest temperature of the isothermal tests. As far 
as the shapes of the curves obtained at constant temperatures 
are concerned, one can easily see that they are of the type 
obtained by J. Meissner (see Fig. 1.11). After the application 
of the time-temperature superposition to alE of the second 
graph, 
~ being replaced by a€ and t by tla) , one would obtain 
a graph very similar to that given by Meissner: at short times 
these reduced curves would superimpose according to the prin-
ciples of linear visco-elasticity, the curve obtained at 
1570 C deviating only slightly from the linear curve even at 
large times. 
The apparent similarity of the shapes of correspon-
ding curves of both graphs is documented when the magnitudes 
of the birefringences are plotted vs. the stresses as ob-
tained at equal times and temperatures. As shown in Fig. 1.38, 
a master curve is obtained in this way. In the given double 
logarithmic plot this m~ster curve possesses a slope of 
unity up to a tensile stress of almost 106 Pa, irrespective 
of temperature or temperature history. This means that a 
temperature ~ndependent and time independent stress-optical 
coefficient is found for polystyrene in this range of tensile 
stresses. If also the correct sign of the birefringence is 
taken into account, one obtains according to the mentioned 
authors:

The negative sign is due to the fact that the polarizability 
of the backbone of the polystyrene chain is lowest in the 
chain direction. The obtained absolute value of the coeffi-
cient seems a little high, when compared with values given 
below for other sampIes of polystyrene. One reason for this 
difference may lie in the fact that laser light of wavelength 
632,8 nm was used, whereas in the investigations of the other

authors a wave length of 548 nm was used. Another reason may 
be found in a systematic error in the thickness measurement. 
The independence of temperature of the stress-optical 
coefficient is a very special property of polystyrene, as 
will be shown below. Beginning at tensile stresses of the 
order of 106 Pa the curve of Fig. 1.38 shows a clear 
curvature. This means that the linear stress-optical rule 
can no lonqer be valid in this ranqe of tensile stresses. 
In later investigations by J. L. White an cooperators 91 ) 
slight but systematic deviations from linearity can also 
be recognized at sufficiently high stresses. 
In connection with the question whether these 
deviations are mainly a consequence of a beginning satu-
ration of the orientation (stress limitation) or partly 
also a consequence of a delay in the establishment of the 
internal thermodynamic equilibrium, some measurements by 
W. Retting will be given 92 ). Also these experiments were 
obtained during the extension of pOlystyre-ne samples

plotted against time for various temperatures. From this 
graph it can clearly be seen that the internal equilibrium 
is reached only after about 100 seconds for a temperature 
of 1100 C (10 degrees above the glass transition). At 1200 C 
still 15 seconds are needed until a constant ratio of 
1&11/0 is obtained. As a matter of fact, this latter time 
appears to be already short compared with the duration of 
the experiments by Matsumoto and Bogue. In Fig. 1.40 a 
nice compilation is given of the temperature dependence of 
the (equilibrium) stress-optical coefficient of the poly-
styrene investigated by Retting. This author finds a 
maximum for the absolute value of this coefficient in the 
range of temperatures between 120 and 130oC. The corres-
ponding stress-optical coefficient is:

As to the optical response of polymer melts to 
cyclic deformations, one has to say that only a few 
measurements have been published so far. With respect to 
the limitation of the stress-optical rule there is only 
the paper by B.E. Read93 ), which is of interest~ This author 
investigated the dynamic properties of poly (methyl acry-
late), which has a dilatometric glass-transition tempera-
ture of about 100 C, at 23 temperatures between 16,60 C and 
61,5 0 C. With the aid of the time-temperature superposition 
principle (see Appendix B) he constructed (amongst others) 
the impressive graph shown in Fig. 1.41. For the appreciation 
of this graph the following definitions are needed.

small amplitude to guarantee linear behaviour) is given by:

If the linear stress-optical rule holds, as defined in 
previous sections, one expects 5' = 5. However, if just 
this question has to be solved by experiment, one is not 
allowed to assume this equality apriori. A complex strain-
optical coefficient K* is now defined in complete analogy 
to the complex modulus E*. (In eqs. (A.3) and (A.4)

5' takes over the role of 5 as used for the definition of

pliance 0* one can also define a complex stress-optical

•.• (1.2.29) 
Here 
Än* takes over the role of the strain whereas it re-
places the stress in eq. (1.2.28). By properly combining eqs. 
(1.2.27) and, (1.2.26) one finds C' = ( Än%
o ) cos (5-5') and 
C" = ( Än%
o ) sin (5-5'). 
With these definitions one can understand Fig. 1.41. 
Measurements were carried out at frequencies between 20 and 
1 s-1. From this fact it follows that the points at high 
values of af (here the actual frequency f is plotted instead 
of the circular frequency w = 2n fJare one and all ob-
tained by the shifting procedure from the measurements 
at low temperatures (cf.eqs.(B.1) and (B.2) of Appendix B.) 
The figure shows us that the glass-transition can be passed 
at 61,So C as well, if the frequency is increased up into 
the megacycle range. At the reference temperature of 61,SoC 
the material behaves like a rubber in the low frequency range 
(f ~ 1 s-1) and as a glass in the high frequency range 
99 

(f > 106s-1). The phase difference (6'-6) between the bire-
fringence and the stress appears to be about zero at the 
high frequency end of the graph. With decreasing frequency 
it continuously increases and reaches the value of 1800 
at low frequencies. This angle of 1800 , however, is equivalent 
to the zero angle. Obviously, such a change from 180 to zero 
degrees is simply brought about by the inversion of the 
sign of the birefringence. 
In fact, as in the case of pOlystyrene, the polari-
zability of the chain molecule of poly(methyl acrylate) is 
lower in the direction of the back bone than in a direction 
perpendicular to this back bone. This is a pure question of 
the chemical structure of the molecule. A consequence of this 
structure is a negative birefringence with respect to the 
direction of orientation. Thus, according to Fig. 1.41 the 
birefringence at low frequencies, being due to chain orien-
tation, can be considered as being in phase with the stress-
which is just what one has to expect when the linear stress-
optical rule holds. Measurements like the ones represented 
in Fig. 1.41 furnish us a useful criterion for the limits of 
validity of this rule. One may expect that, with increasing 
temperature, the constant value of 6'-6= 1800 will be found 
over an increasing "range of frequencies on the left side of 
such a graph. In fact, G.V. Vinogradov and cooperators94 ) 
have recently carried out measurements on other polymers at 
temperatures far above their glass-transition temperatures. 
They found that 6' was identical with 6 in the whole range 
of frequencies used. 
Before reporting in more detail on these measurements, 
however, one should mention some additional fe"atures of 
the results obtained by Read. If one considers Fig. 1.40, 
as given by W. Retting, one notices that the absolute value 
of the stress-optical coefficient of polystyrene rather 
rapidly decreases when the temperature becomes lower than 
1200 C. The contrary happens to the absolute value of the 
stress-optical coefficient of poly(methyl acrylate), when the 
temperature is lowered. It increases under these circumstances: 
100 

In Fig. 1.42 reciprocal values are plotted which, of course, 
decrease with decreasing temperature. 
The birefringences, as used in this graph, were ob-
tained in the fullowing way: A strip of the polymer is clamped 
at its ends and stretched to a certain extent at 650 C. When 
the length of the stretched sampIe is kept constant, the bire-
fringence in the sampIe relaxes. In the beginning this occurs 
at a rather high rate. After about 15 minutes, however, further 
changes cannot be noticed within the time span of the subsequent 
experiment. In this experiment the sampIe is cooled between 
fixed clamps at a rate of 0,30 C/min. (Favourably, relaxation 
times increase with cooling!) Birefringence measurements are 
taken at about 150 C intervals. During this procedure the 
absolute value of the (negative) birefringence increases conti-
nuously. The ratio of the birefringence, as taken at To 
61,50 C, 
over the birefringence taken at T < To is plotted in Fig. 1.42. 
This is a static experiment, for which 
Wo = aw = 0 for all 
temperatures. For such an experiment one has (with 6' = 0):

The (static) strain-optical coefficient occurs because of 
the fact that the experiment is carried out at (nearly) 
constant strain (as the influence of the thermal contraction 
is disregarded). Since, as pointed out in Section B.1 of 
Appendix B, moduli are reduced according to the second and the 
third eq. (B.2), one also has:

Wo = aw , one has:

since this ratio is equal to tan 6' and does not contain

where the latter ratio of birefringences is obtained according 
to the static experiment described above. 
In this way, the experiments by B.E. Read not only 
furnish us insight into the time scale limit of the validity 
102 

of the linear stress-optical rule. At the same time they 
also show us, how to handle the time-temperature superposi-
tion principle in the case of optical measurements, and 
provide us, in the particular case of poly(methyl acrylate), 
with the temperature dependence of the stress-optical coeffi-
cient of this polymer in the vicinity of the (dilatometric) 
glass transition temperature. Finally, one may note that 
in Fig. 1.41 the courses of Je land IKI 
as functions of 
frequency reflect qualitatively the respective courses of 
ID I and I EI. 
The measurements of G.V. Vinogradov, A.I. Isayev, 
D.A. Mustafaev and Y.Y. pOdOlsky94) are of special interest for 
two reasons. One reason, i.e. the verification of the linear 
stress-optical rule, was already mentioned. The other reason is 
connected to the fact that these measurements were carried out 
not in cyclic extension but in cyclic shearing. We have already 
seen in Section 1.2.1 that experiments in shear provide a host 
of information due to the low symmetry of this deformation. In 
this connection the occurrence of a first normal stress 
difference has been mentioned. Also in cyclic shearing a first 
normal stress difference occurs. For our present purpose, 
however, this causes a lot of complications. In fact, as this 
first normal stress difference, in contrast to the shear 
stress, does not change sign during one cycle, it shows twice 
the frequency of the applied shear. (Also in steady shear flow 
the first normal stress difference is independent of the 
direction of flow.) For the moment it should suffice to state 
that the cyclic first normal stress difference contains a 
static component. In fact, because of never changing sign, it 
can be written formally as: 
with A ~ B, 
other hand, 
= 
(1.2.35) 
where Astands for the static component. On the 
since (011-022)* is certainly an effect in 
2 
Yo 
the 
(square of the shear amplitude Yo) the static part as weil as 
amplitude of the dynamic part of this quantity should be small 
compared with the amplitude of the shear stress, which is linear 
103 

in Yo' However, since polymer melts rernain "linear" in the shear 
stress up to rather large va lues of Yo (of the order of unity), 
the influence of the first normal stress difference should be 
noticeable under these "linear" conditions. 
Flow birefringence measurements seem particularly 
suitable if the cyclic normal stress itself is the goal 
of the investigation. In these measurements, however, one 
cannot separate the shear component n 12 from the component 
n 11-n22 . The best one can do is, to measure just ßn 
(= nI-nII ). Since the cross of the principal axes wiggles 
if the shear amplitude is not infinitely small, one can 
better avoid the influence of this wiggling on the measure-
ment of 
ßn by introducing a standard method to produce and 
analyse circularly polarized light, which passes through 
the sampie. (Behind the polarizer and in front of the analyser 
quarter wave plates are introduced at positions 45 degrees 
with the respective directions of polarization.) 
With such an arrangement, the mentioned authors investi-
gated various sampies of polybutadiene and polyisoprene of narrow 
molecular mass distributions (1,1< M IM 
< 1,6), but of varying 
-
w n-
(average) molecular masses. The temperature of the measurements 
was room temperature*) • The birefringence was determined by coun-
ting the fringes on the oscillograph. This method, which requi-
res relatively high shear amplitudes to produce sufficient 
optical path differences, is illustrated by Fig. 1.43. In 
this figure photorecordings are shown for a frequency of 
-1

0,1s 
at three shear amplitudes yo: 6,3.10 
(a), 
3,8.10- 1 (b) and 1,1 (c). The deformation is indicated by 
a sine wave over one period. The recorder tracings give 
a negative image of the light intensity: Everymaximum 
indicates a minimum of light intensity. The phase angle ~ßn 
between deformation and birefringence is easily recognized 
in graph (a). Except for the zero order fringe (0) there 
is only one other (first order) fringe (1) in this graph.

With increasing shear amplitude Yo (graph (b)) the zero

tion of the static birefringence). 
So one has to increase 
the amplitude carefully. Otherwise one can easily overlook 
fringes in this counting. On the other hand, one has to go 
to a sufficient number of fringes in order to be able to 
check the nearly sinusoidal response of the birefringence

and to find the approximate birefringence amplitude. This 
is shown in graph (c). In this graph one notices fringes 
from No. 2 up to No. 20, but the zero and first order fringes 
are no longer visible. In Fig. 1.44 the corresponding 
approximate half cycle sine wave is drawn. The static 
önc is 
clearly noticeable. At the same time, the higher harmonics which 
correspond to the cyclic part of the first normal stress 
difference, are too weak to be noticeable. 
A more detailed analysis will be presented in Section 
2.3.6. For the moment, two further figures of this investigation 
will be reproduced. On Fig. 1.45 one observes the identity of 
the phase angles of birefringence and shear stress. This identity 
is exactly given for a variety of frequencies and polymer samples. 
From Fig. 1.46 one can read the experimental relations between 
log 
öno and log 00 for the polybutadienes (line 1) and the poly-
isoprenes (line 2), where 
öno is the amplitude of the approximate 
sine wave of the birefringence and ° is the amplitude of the

shear stress. From these curves stress optical coefficients of

011-022 remains small compared with 012 (see 2nd eq. (1.2.3) 
or eq. (1.2.5». The obtained va lues for the stress-
optical coefficients are, according to the mentioned authors, 
in excellent agreement with those obtained in steady shear 
flow experiments. For the characteristics of these polymers 
see the original paper. 
Summarizing one may state that measurements at 
sufficiently low shear amplitude would be much easier in 
principle ( ßnc = 0, X exactly 450 ). However, the lack 
of suitable techniques for the measurement of small bi re-
fringence effects of rather low frequency becomes obvious in 
this connection. It should be mentioned that J.L. sChrag28 ) 96) 
has solved the problem of the measurement of the cyclic 
birefringences of dilute polymer solutions near room tem-
perature and at appropriate high frequencies up to 105s-1. 
Unfortunately, a similar apparatus suitable for measure-
ments on polymer melts has not yet been developed. 
1.2.3.2 Further Evidence for the Validity 
of the Linear Stress-Optical Rule. 
As mentioned already in the last paragraph of 
Section 1.2.1, eq. (1.2.4) has been serving as the most impor-
tant source for the evaluation of the stress-optical coeffi-
cient in the past. Authors as A.S. Lodge and W. Philippoff 
were quoted in this connection in the mentioned paragraph. As 
a matter of fact, however, J.L.S. wales64 ) was the first who 
carried out a large number of useful measurements on polymer 
melts, using this steady shear flow technique. For the purpose, 
he used the original version of the apparatus '(for the measure-
ment of flow birefringence of polymer melts in the 1,2-plane 
of shear flow) , as described in Section 1.2.2.2. Since the 
pertinent technique has been described already in previous 
sections, a presentation of results will be given here right 
away. (Pertinent viscosity measurements were carried out with 
the aid of rheogoniometers of the Kepes and Weissenberg type, 
as weIl as with slit and capillary rheometers. See ref. 13).)

It seems useful to start with the presentation of 
Table 1.5, in which the data of most polymers investigated 
in Delft (at TNO and at the University) are gathered. In

are plotted vs. shear rate q for the narrow molecular mass 
distribution polystyrenes of Table 1.5. First of all one 
observes (as is obvious also for the polybutadienes and 
polyisoprenes investigated by Vinogradov et al. -
see 
previous section) that the stress-optical coefficient C is 
independent of the molecular mass. This is in agreement with 
theoretical considerations derived from the theory of 
rubber elasticity, as follows from eq. (1.2.2); see also 
Chapter 2. The same result will be observed for all polymers 
investigated. A closer inspection of Fig. 1.47 reveals that 
the stress-optic~l coefficient could not be determined over 
the whole range of shear rates, at which the viscosity was 
measured. (Compare the locations of open and closed symbols 
of the same shape.) The reason for this fact is that birefrin-
gence measurements and, in particular, extinction angle measure-
ments could not be extended up to sufficiently high shear rates. 
With increasing shear rates these measurements became more and 
more difficult due to a growing depolarization effect. At pre-
sent we know that this effect is due to parasitic birefringen-
ces near the windows and can be largely avoided (see Section 
1.2.2.2). For these narrow molecular mass distribution polysty-
renes, however, this limitation meant that, at the time of the 
measurements, the constancy of the stress-optical coefficient 
remained unproved in the range of shear rates where the visco-
sity was clearly non-Newtonian. In fact, the viscosity of these 
polymers is Newtonian over a comparatively large range of shear 
rates. From this point of view more information can be gained 
from technical polymers showing, in general, a pronounced 
non-Newtonian viscosity over the whole range of available shear 
rates. A constant stress-optical coefficient C is always found. 
Interestingly enough, for technical polystyrenes values of C 
are found a little lower than for laboratory scale polystyrenes 
(see Table 1.6). This may be due to different additives adsor-
bed at the chain molecules of the technical polymers. Such a 
conclusion is drawn by analogy: Mention should be made of the 
influence of the solvent on the back-bone anisotropy, as investi-
gated by E.V. Frisman, A.K. Dadivanyan and G.A. Dyuzhev97 ) (see 
also ref. 1».

In Fig. 1.48 results, as obtained on high density 
polyethylenes of broad (HDBD) and narrow (HDND) moleeular 
mass distribution are shown. For the broad distribution 
sampie the validity of a constant stress-optieal coeffieient 
is elearly demonstrated in a shear rate range where the 
viscosity is highly non-Newtonian. For polyethylene the 
stress-optieal eoeffieient is positive (in contrast to poly-
styrene) and, again, independent of molecular mass (distri-
bution). The stress-optical coeffieient for low density 
polyethylene is, irrespective whether the molecular mass 
distribution is broad (LDBD) or narrow 
(LD~D), a little

lower than for the high density polyethylenes. Wales found 
a linear relation between the value of the stress-optical 
coefficient and the branching index in aseries of low 
density polyethylenes. The back-bone anisotropy seems to be 
reduced by the presence of branching points 64 ) • 
In Fig. 1.49 results are shown as obtained on two 
polypropylenes, one with a relatively narrow molecular mass 
distribution (PPND) and one with a very broad distribution 
(PPBD), both showing nearly the same values for the mass 
average molecular mass Mw and for the zero shear viscosity. 
From measurements of the dilute solution flow birefringence 
in trans-decalin at 1500 C it is known that also the tail 
of the distribution at high molecular masses must be much 
longer for PPBD than for PPND 98). From Fig. 1.49 one learns 
that the broad distribution polymer shows a more pronounced 
non-Newtonian behaviour of the viscosity. (Other differences 
will be shown below.) As polypropylene is a very oxidizable

polymer at the temperature of the measurements (210 
C), 
difficulties are encountered in the rheogoniometer because 
of the open rim. This fact is probably responsible for the 
scatter in the viscosity measurements in the low shear rate 
range where the above mentioned apparatus was used99 ). This 
scatter, however, was of influence on the accuracy of the 
stress-optical coefficient. Nevertheless, there seems to be 
no doubt about the constancy of this coefficient, as just 
in the high shear rate range, where one has to be suspicious 
of deviations, the accuracy was much better. 
From the work of Wales we also know three examples 
where the coaxiality of the stress and refraction index 
ellipsoids was directly tested in the low shear rate range. 
For the purpose the orientation angle of the stress ellipsoid 
was calculated from rheogoniometer measurements of shear stress 
and first normal stress difference (see Section 1.1.3.2) 
116 

with the aid of the equation: 
= cot 2X 
(1.2.36) 
which is obtained by dividing the second eq. (1.2.3) by the 
first eg. (1.2.3). In Fig. 1.50 these angles are indicated by 
open symbols whereas the direct optical extinction angle mea-
surements are given by closed symbols. In this figure, which 
shows the normal shape of "extinction angle curves", the 
results for both polypropylenes are given. One notices that 
there is, within the accuracy of the measurements, a reasonable 
agreement. The same can be stated for measurements on the low 
density polyethylene IUPAC A, which are omitted here in order 
to safe space. 
With respect to the polypropylenes one also 
notices that the orientation angles of the broad distribution 
sample deviate, with increasing rate of shear, much faster from 
the 45 degree position than those of the narrow distribution 
polymer. In contrast, however, to the dilute solution proper-

ties of these pOlymers 98), a quantitative description of these 
differences has not yet been possible on the basis of a 
molecular theory. As to the results on IUPAC A, Wales reported 
difficulties in obtaining steady states at intermediate rates 
of shear. These findings were corroborated by measurements of 
Gortemaker et al. more recently83) 84). Seemingly,. in this 
branched polymer, long time effects playa certain role (see 
also Dealy et al. 100». For a proof of the coaxiality of stress 
and refractive index ellipsoids in transient situations refe-
rence is made to Section 1.2.3.8. 
Returning to the question of the limit of validity 
of the linear stress-optical rule one should mention an 
observation by Wales. This author experienced that, in shear 
flow experiments, the constancy of the stress-optical 
coefficient could never be proved for shear stresses much 
larger than 104 Pa. This result can easily be checked with 
the aid of the results presented so far in this section, 
where in general still lower limiting stress values are found. 
It is also interesting to note that the limiting shear stress 
quoted by Wales is about two decades lower than the limiting 
tensile stress quoted by Matsumoto and Bogue (Section 1.2.3.1). 
In this connection it seems interesting to quote J.L. den 
Otter 101 ), who states that melt fracture (extrusion defects 
of various kinds) has been observed always in the same relative-
ly narrow range of wall shear stresses of 0,4 to 3,ox105 Pa, irre-
spective of the type of the polymer and of the shear rate, at 
which it occurred. One is tempted to deduce from these results 
that the high stresses, at which in tensile experiments 
deviations from the linear stress-optical rule become obser-
vable, will never be reached in stable steady state shear 
flow. In view of the decrease of the non-Newtonian viscosity 
one can anticipate that shear rates, at which the critical 
stress-region is reached, can be rather high. This tentative 
conclusion is supported by two very careful sets of experiments. 
In Fig. 1.51 the non-Newtonian shear viscosity and the 
constant stress-optical coefficient of a poly (dimethyl 
siloxane) (Siloprene RS) are shown over almost four decades

in the shear rate64 ). In this figure the onset of melt fracture 
in capillary flow is indicated by an arrow marked by "M.F.". 
The pertinent shear stress is 0,39.105 Pa. Theresults of 
this figure were obtained in a cooperative research, in which 
W. Philippoff did the low shear rate measurements in a 
coaxial cylinder apparatus and Wales did the high shear rate 
flow birefringence measurements in his cone-and-plate appa-
ratus and the viscosity measurements in a capillary rheometer. 
Similar results are obtained for a technical 
polystyrene (Hostyren N 4000 V) 102). Melt fracture occurs 
for this polymer 
at the temperature of 1700 C of the measure-
ments at 0,9.105 Pa. Flow birefringence measurements in the 
cone-and-plate apparatus had to be stopped at a little lower 
119 

shear stresses because of the influence of frictional heat pro-
duction on the quality of the lioht beam (see Section 1.2.2.2). 
These measurements on a polystyrene, from which it can be conclu-
ded that flow in the ringshaped gap of the cone-and-plate appara-
tus with closed rims is stable at least up to the point where melt 
fracture occurs in capillaries, became possible only after the 
latest improvements with respect to the positioning of the 
light beam in close vicinity to the stationary plate. Only 
with this improvement a useful extinction angle curve could 
be obtained in the range of higher shear rates. (Cf. Figs. 
1.30 and 1.31.) By this experience the question is solved, 
why in previous investigations the range of shear rates was 
more limited, in general. 
At the same time, however, one discovers a clear 
influence of the back-bone anisotropy (or of the magnitude 
of the stress-optical coefficient) on the size of the 
previously available range of shear rates. This size has 
been determined by the occurrence of fringes. If the back-
bone anisotropy is as low as with pOly(dimethyl siloxane), 
no damaging fringes occur in the range of interesting shear 
rates. For polyethylenes an intermediate situation is found. 
The polystyrenes belong to the most critical polymers because 
of their high back-bone anisotropy. With the newest improve-
ments, however, this problem seems to be eliminated. 
Before ending this second discussion on the limits of 
validity, one should probably remind the reader of the 
results of Vinogradov and cooperators 51 ) 59) with respect to the 
occurrence of "spurt" in the case of narrow molecular mass 
distribution polymers. This effect was found at shear stresses 
in the vicinity of 3.105 Pa. (See Section 1.1.4.4.) This is 
the upper limit of the range in which melt fracture was found 
by Den Otter. With the occurrence of spurt Vinogradov et al. 
proved the presence of slip at the wall, whereas Den Otter 
clearly showed that no slip was present during the melt 
fracture phenomena which he investigated. The main conclusion, 
however, should be for us that, for shear flow, there is 
only aminute probability that shear stresses can occur 
120 

at which noticeable deviations from the linear stress-
optical rule are to be expected. 
At the end of this section one finds a compilation 
of stress-optical coefficients, as obtained for various 
polymer melts and at various temperatures of the measurement. 
For the purpose Table 1.6 is introduced. From this table one 
may notice that, within the uncertainty of the measurements, 
the stress-optical coefficient of the polystyrenes is inde-
pendent of temperature. This will be shown a little more 
explicitly at the occasion of the measurements in the slit-
apparatus. The technical polystyrenes seem to show a little 
lower values of the stress-optical coefficient than poly-
styrenes prepared for research purposes (8 111, 3a, 6a, 7a). 
This may point to the presence of additives in the technical 
polymers, as pointed out before. Whereas high density 
polyethylenes seem to show a decrease of the value of C with 
increasing temperature, the poly(dimethyl siloxanes) definitely 
show a relatively large increase with temperature. As to the 
values for the polyisobutadienes and the polyisoprenes the 
originalliterature should be consulted in connection with 
the characteristics of the polymers. This polymers are 
copolymers of cis -
1,4, trans -
1,4, 1,2 and 3,4 addition 
steps, about 45:45:10:0 for the polyisobutadienes and 76:16:0:8 
for the polyisoprenes. The value for the very temperature sensi-
tive poly(vinyl chloride) has been found by Wales in a way, 
which will be described, when the measurementswith the 
slit-apparatus are discussed. 
1.2.3.3 Zero 8hear Properties and Molecular Mass: 
Evaluation of Cone-and-Plate Measurements'. 
In his monograph J.L.8. Wales 64 ) reported upon measure-
ments, as carried out on the melts of polystyrenes of narrow 
molecular mass distribution. At this occasion he expressed 
the hope that there will be a possibility to interpret these 
results with the aid of a future molecular theory. At the 
121 

time of the measurements, indeed, such a theory did not exist. 
However, as will become obvious in Chapter 3 of the present 
monograph, quite recently this expectation seems to have been 
fulfilled. For the moment we are dealing only with the experi-
mental results. The polymers used in this investigation are 
listed in Table 1.5. These polymers were furnish by 
Pressure-Chemical Corp. as the sampIes 1a, 3a, 4a, 5a, 6a, 
7a and 14a. They cover a range of relative molecular masses 
from 50 000 to 1,7 millions. Also incorporated is the poly-
styrene S 111, as distributed by Dow Chemical Corp. at the 
time. The temperature of the measurement was varied from sampIe 
to sampIe, as indicated in the caption to the next figure. 
The reason for this variation lies in the fact that, due to 
the wide range of molecular masses, the investigation of 
each polymer at the same temperature would require an appa-
ratus capable of producing accurate measurements in a range 
of five decades in the viscosity. The experimental results 
were converted to a reference temperature of 1900 C by the 
application of the time-temperature superposition principle 
with the aid of the shift factor a 
for polystyrene, which 
has proved to be a unique function of temperature independent 
of the special polystyrene investigated. (See Appendix B 
and also results as reported in Section 1.2.3.5, where the 
validity of the time-temperature superposition principle 
will be proved valid for linear as weIl as non-linear behaviour, 
including experiences with S 111.)

in this way areplotted in Fig. 1.53 . Before a discussion 
of these results will be given, one remark should be made 
with respect to the temperature shift. 
Because of the temperature insensitive stress-optical 
coefficient of the polystyrenes, the measured values of 
Ln 
were used for the shift in unmodified form. This procedure is 
reasonable even in the case that the measurements of W. Retting

do not have a significant influence on the results of

The first relation corresponds weIl with the well-known 
Fox-Flory relation60) 
for the molecular mass dependence of 
the zero shear viscosity, where the exponent has a value 
of 3,4. Using the results of eqs. (1.2.39) and (1.2.40) together 
with 
a stress-optical coefficient of 5.10-9pa- 1 , as 
obtained for non-technical polystyrenes, one obtains with

for the equilibrium shear compliance. This result, however, 
is not exactly what is shown in Fig. 1.21, even if the 
order of magnitude of Je is correct for the high 'molecular 
mass range. Probably, some inavoidable preaveraging occurred, 
when eqs. (1.2.39) and (1.2.40) were derived from the points in 
Fig. 1.53. This incited Wales to change the order of manipula-
tions. In fact, if one expects apriori that a certain composed 
quantity is rather insensitive to some variables, on which it 
depends in principle (here relative molecular mass and shear rate), 
one can better start by first calculating this quantity for each 
125 

set of variables (each pair of M and q). A further way of evalu-
ation will then almost automatically follow from the inspection 
of the obtained values of the said quantity. This has been done 
by Wales in the underlying case, as shown in Fig. 1.54. In this 
figure (1/2) (n11-n22)/n122, which furnishes the optical counterpart 
J eo of Je in the limit of shear rate zero, is plotted for all 
sampies against the rate of shear. Apparently, the shear rate 
dependences of the separate birefrinqences are neutralized by 
the formation of the indicated ratio even for those cases, where 
pronounced non-Newtonian viscosities are found. An extrapolation 
to zero shear rate becomes virtually unnecessary. As to the depen-
dence of J 
on the relative molecular mass one observes the 
eo 
following: A weak dependence of J eo on the relative molecular mass 
is found in the low molecular mass range. With the molecular mass

the value of Jeo seems to increase and to converge to a single 
value for all samples with a relative molecular mass equal 
or larger than 200 000. By simply multiplying this limiting 
value of Jeo by the stress-optical coefficient, one obtains:

This result is qualitatively in good agreement with Fig. 1.21. 
In conclusion one may summarize that, at least for the 
investigated pOlystyrenes, a rather reliable proof for the 
constancy of the equilibrium shear compliance could be given 
in this way. It holds for molecularmasses clearly larger 
than the critical molecular mass Me as defined by Flory and 
Fox in connection with the molecular mass dependence of the 
zero shear viscosi ty. (See Section 1.1.4.4 and Fig. 1.19.) 
1.2.3.4 Evaluation of Slit Rheometer Measurements. 
As pointed out in Section 1.2.2.3, in a slit rheo-
meter an average over the birefringences, as occurring in 
fluid layers at different distances from the central plane, 
is measured. As these birefringences occur in the 1,3-plane 
of shear, one measures: 
(1.2.43) 
The evaluation of these measurements, as given in eqs. (1.2.18) 
through (1.2.21), is based on the assumption of a two-dimensional 
flow field. In other words, it is assumed that the ratio of 
the large to the small side of the rectangular cross-section -
sometimes called the aspect ratio - is large enough so that 
the influence of the small side walls can be disregarded. In 
order to check the influence of this aspect ratio, wales64 ) 
carried out measurements in three slits with aspect ratios of 
10:1, 12,5:1 and 30:1. In these slits measurements could be 
carried out at the following reduced distances Lid from the 
127 

entrance (where d is the depth, i.e. smaller side of the 
rectangular cross-section): Lid 
15 and Lid = 35. (For the 
slit with the intermediate aspect ratio there was only a 
possibility at Lid 
15.) In Fig. 1.55 results, as obtained 
at T = 1900 C, for a low density polyethylene ALK WJG 11 
(not quoted in Table 1.5) are given. The quantity (n11 -n 33> 
is plotted against apparent shear rate, as given by eq. (1.1.52). 
Instead of qa the symbol Os is used, with subscript s for slit. 
From this figure one learns that there was no difference 
between the measurements obtained with the three quoted 
aspect ratios. This fact permits the conclusion that the 
smallest aspect ratio 10:1 appears sufficiently large for the 
described purpose. As a consequence, aspect ratio 10:1 was 
chosen as a standard. On the other hand, the influence of the 
reduced distance from the entrance seems rather pronounced.

From the two distances used in this pre1iminary investigation, 
however, no conc1usions can be drawn with respect to the 
question whether a steady f10w situation was reached in the 
fluid elements at the bigger distance. 
To solve this quest ion a very 10ng slit with a total 
LId of 100 was used by Wales. In the 1eft part of Fig. 1.56 
it is shown that (n11-n33> decreases with increasing LId 
indeed. A steady f10w situation, as characterized by a final 
horizontal part of the curve, however, is not even found for 
the 10west apparent shear rate Os' when ALK WJG 11 was in-
vestigated at T = 1900 C~ This resu1t throws serous doubts 
on the usefu1ness of capi11ary rheometry, where a constant 
shear stress has been assumed tacit1y over the who1e 1ength 
of the capi11ary. (Cf. Meissner's remark with respect to the 
va1ue of capi11ary data for 10w density polyethylenes, as 
quoted in Section 1.1.4.2 at the occasion of Fig. 1.11.) 
However, fortunate1y it turns out that 10w density poly-
ethylenes are very pecu1iar materials. In the right part of 
Fig. 1.56, for comparison the behaviour of a technica1 po1ysty-
rene (Styron 666, at 1900 C) is shown. For this material it ap-
pears that with an ordinary slit rheometer the changes behind 
the entrance cannotbe observed. In fact, at the sma11est redu-
ced distance of LId = 15, as shown in the 1eft part of Fig. 1.56, 
Wales observed exact1y the same va1ue of<n11 -n33> ' as was found 
at any 1arger reduced distance. In order to investigate the be-
haviour of this polymer behind the entrance, Wales constructed a 
special apparatus. As a basic instrument a piston viscometer was 
used with a pair of opposite windows in the 10wer part of the 
barrel. Short glass capi11aries mounted in a holder were put 
into the reservoir, so that they were visible through the 
said windows. As a consequence of this position also the 
outer surface of the capi11ary was surrounded by the polymer 
me1t. This reduced the danger that the capi11ary was cracked 
by the high pressure and, at the same time, almost comp1ete1y 
e1iminated the 1ens effect of the outer surface of the 
capi11ary. In this way, rather re1iab1e birefringence mea-
surements cou1d be carried out in the projection of the

130 

Finally, some words should be said about flow bire-
fringence measurements in the 1,2-plane of the slit. Refe-
rence was made to this possibility in Section 1.2.2.3. This 
type of measurement is carried out only if, for some reason, 
no measurements in the cone-and-plate apparatus can be done. 
As the most common reason thermal instability of the polymer 
should be mentioned. Whereas for measurements in the 
1,3-plane, as described above, one could quote the advantage 
of the possibility of measurements in the high shear rate 
range, this advantage does not exist for measurements in the 
1,2-plane, since measurements become incre~singly difficult 
with increasing shear rates owing to reasons explained in 
Section 1.2.2.3. Measurement of extinction angles is virtually 
impossible. The birefringence at the slit wall can be estima-
ted by counting the number of isochromatic fringes (star-
ting at the centre). This birefringence reads: 
t.n = 
••• (1.2.44) 
This equation is easily obtained by taking the squares of the 
optical equivalents of the first two eqs. (1.2.3) and adding 
them together. With the aid of the stress-optical rule and 
after expansion of the square root, one has for 
at the slit-wall: 
••• (1.2.45) 
where J eo 
(1/2)(n11-n22)/n1/ is used. With the aid ofa 
least squares procedure the best coefficients A =-2 C and 
B = C3J 
can be obtained. In Fig. 1.57 results are shown 
eo

for a technical PVC at 210 
C. The full line gives the best 
fit. The obtained value for C is quoted in Table 1.6. 
Wales checked the reliability of his method by investigating 
also a polystyrene. From the result of this investigation he 
concluded that C, as obtained in this way, may be a little 
low. Also semi-quantitative J 
-values were obtained.

1.2.3.5 Time-Temperature Superposition 
and Non-Linear (Equilibrium) Properties. 
In Fig. 1.58 measurements of 
<p 
= (n 11 -n 3f as a function 
of apparent shear rate Ds 
(= qa of eq. (1.1.52)) are shown, as 
carried out on the technical polystyrene Styron 666 at a rather 
large number of temperatures in the slit apparatus. 
To these 
measurements Wales tentatively applied the usual shifting proce-
dure, as known from linear viscoelasticity, in order to obtain 
a master curve at a reference temperature of 1900 C. Bince the 
stress-optical coefficient of polystyrene is practically independent 
of temperature, quantity 
<P can, in principle, be reduced like a 
stress. (This means the application of the factor 
p T /p T, 
o 0 
which is practically unity for the above temperature range (see 
eqs. (B.2) in Appendix B)). In this way a typical master curve 
is actually obtained. 
As the slit could directly be fed by a 
screw extruder, at 1900 C also some direct measurements could be 
obtained in the high shear rate range. Results agreed rather well

horizontal shift, as explained in Section 1.2.3.1 at the 
occasion of Read's work on poly(methyl acrylate) (see Fig. 1.42).

explicitly by Wales. 
On the master curves of Fig. 1.59 the procedure) as 
expressed by eqs. (1.2.18) through (1.2.21), can'be applied. 
In this way the values of (n11 -n33 )w' as valid at the large 
slit wall, are obtained. These values can be related to the 
true shear rates at the wall (eq. (1.1 .51». By the application 
of the linear stress-optical rule the pertinent normal stress 
differences at the wall, i.e. (o11-o33)w' can be obtained for 
the high shear rate range, particularly open to the slit mea-
surements. These normal stress differences are incorporated in

above mentioned polystyrenes ane for two high density polyethy-

esting graphs of these authors will be reproduced here as

are plotted as functions of (reduced) shear rate q together with 
2 G'/w2 , n' = G"/w and 
n* 
(n,2 + n,,2)1/2 as functions of 
(reduced) circular frequency w. The reason why these functions 
are compared, follows from eqs. (1.1.34), (1.1.33) and (1.1.39), 
the latter equation expressing the famous Cox-J'ilerz-rule. One 
notices that the Cox-Merz-rule is nicely obeyed for the two 
polymers. In the case of the data of high density polyethylene 
Marlex 6002, which are not reproduced here, this agreement is 
fair. On the other hand, for both high density polyethylenes 
2 G'/w2 appears to be a very good approximation for (011-022)/q2 
as well as for (011-033)/q2 in the whole range of q (or w ). 
(Apparently, these latter normal stress coefficients are almost 
indentical.) The mentioned approximation is less convincing 
for the polystyrenes. 
Nevertheless, one can conclude that, in general, the 
measurement of the dynamic moduli G' and G" as functions of 
circular frequency w enables us to obtain a rather realistic 
impression about the expected course of steady shear viscosity 
137 

and steady normal stress coefficients in the highly non-linear 
region of shear rates. This is rather unexpected, since eqs. 
(1.1.33) and (1.1.34) are derived only for the limiting cases 
of w +0. This is certainly a surprise: Highly non-linear 
properties are more or less quantitatively predicted from 
purely linear results like the dynamic moduli. W. Philippoff106 ) 
was the first who discovered the semi-quantitative predictability 
of first normal stress differences from storage moduli for polymer 
solutions. Certainly, these experiences must be used as criteria 
for the usefulness of (future) molecular theories. Finally,

a rare occasion where the validity of eq. (1.1.34) is clearly 
shown for q = o. On the other hand, the high shear rate range 
accessible to the slit apparatus is omitted here. 
1.2.3.6 Further Comments on the Influence of 
Molecular Mass (Distribution). 
In Fig. 1.64 the average birefringence (n11 -n33), 
as measured by Wales in a slit rheometer at L/d = 35, is 
plotted, by a way of variety, versus the shear stress at the 
slit wall för the monodisperse polystyrenes (7a, S 111, 5a and 
6a of Table 1.5). The shear stress at the wall was measured in 
the same slit rheometer (see Section 1.1.3.3) (together with the 
shear rate). As one may notice from the figure, curves for the 
individual polymers are strikingly accumulated (in contrast 
to what occurs if the shear rate is plotted on the abscissa). 
As a matter of fact, it seems that, with increasing molecular 
mass, an upper limiting position of the curves is reached. 
In fact, for polymers possessing relative molecular masses 
of 224 000, 498 000 and 860 000 experimental points are ob-
tained, which are really close together, if the big differences 
in molecular masses are considered. Only the points for the 
lowest relative molecular mass of 51 000 seem to lie significantly 
lower. This is in agreement with the experiences gathered with 
the equilibrium shear compliance J . In fact, if for the moment 
e 
one disregards a possible small difference between n 11 -n22 and 
n 11 -n33 
(see Sections 1.2.3.5 and 1.2.3.7), one can conclude 
that the ratio {n11-n33)/o122 is just proportional to Je' which 
appears to be molecular mass independent at sufficiently high 
molecular masses {see Section 1.2.3.3, eq. (1.2.42». Inspection 
of Fig. 1.64 also reveals that the lines drawn through the 
experimental points in the range of shear stresses smaller than 
105 Pa (N/m2 ) exactly reveal a slope two, emphasizing the

rather broad molecular mass distributions. For comparison, 
the results as obtained on S 111 are added (see the lowest 
curve). Since, however, according to the previous figure the 
position of the (lower part of the) curve for S 111 is already 
very close to that of an imaginary high molecular mass limit, 
one should expect that the technical polystyrenes having a 
high molecular mass tail in the distribution (see Table 1.5), 
would fall nearly on that curve. In contrast to this expectation, 
the curve for BASF 3 lies a factor 6 higher. This seemingly 
paradoxical result is akin to the one, reported by Münstedt with 
respect to the dependence of De on the breadth of the molecular 
mass distribution (see Section 1. 1.4.4, Fig. 1.22). A' future 
molecular theory has to cope with this difficulty. As will be 
141 

discussed in Chapter 3, the re cent theory by M. Doi and 
S.F. Edwards'07) seems to be capable of reconciling these con-
flicting evidences of a molecular mass independent Je (or De ), 
as found with monodisperse polymers, and the dependence on mole-
cular mass distribution of the same quantity. 
The observed quadratic dependence of the birefringence 
< 
n,,-n 33 > on the shear stress, which holds at shear stresses 
5 
lower than'O 
Pa for almost all polystyrenes, can be of great 
value for a qualitative or semi-quantitative interpretation 
of birefringences in injection moulded strips64). With polysty-
rene, due to the practical independence of the stress-optical 
coefficient of temperature, the situation seems particularly 
favourable. (See Chapter 4 on the practical applications.) 
In Fig. '.66 a beautiful example for the independence of this 
relation of temperature is given75 ).

1.2.3.7 Measurement of the Optical Eguivalent 
to the Second Normal Stress Difference64 ) 73) 
As already mentioned in Section 1.2.2.3, in these 
measurements the light-beam is directed through the ca-
pillary. As a conseguence, it passes also through entrance 
and exit zones. So one has to be careful in eliminating 
possible entrance-exit effects. This can be achieved by the 
use of capillaries of varying lengths. An example of the 
results of such a set of measurements is given in Fig. 1.67. 
In this figure optical path differences (retardations), as 
obtained by Wales on the low density polyethylene LDPE IUPAC A 
at 1900 C, are shown. Three capillaries with lengths of 7 mm, 
20 mm and 40 mm were used (2 r = 2,67 mm). One notices that

143 

(1.1.49)) can readily be connected by straight lines. This fact 
indicates that the retardations of interest are actually pro-
portional to the capillary length. The entrance-exit effects 
are relatively small and negative. Apparently, by these effects 
part of the desired optical path difference is compensated: 
The apparent lengths of the capillaries are smaller than the 
actual lengths. The birefringence n22-n33 at the wall is obtained 
by deviding the measured path difference by the apparent length 
of the capillary used. For polyethylenes one finds a negative 
n22-n33 , whereas the pertine:lt quantity n 11 -n22 is positive for 
this polymer. For silicone fluids the same signs are found. For 
polystyrenes, however, both signs are reversed. In the following 
n33-n22 will be used instead of n22-n33 for convenience. 
With this notation one finds that 
> 0 
••• (1.2.46) 
is the general rule, suggesting according to Wales that also the 
birefringence n33-n22 must be governed by chain orientation. 
This would mean that the linear stress-optical rule should 
hold also for this birefringence. 
Before reporting more quantitative details of these 
results, Wales paid some extra attention to the linearity 
of the curves in Fig. 1.67. Such a linearity was also found 
for the other types of polymers investigated. For the 
LDPE IUPAC A, however, it caused a certain surprise. In fact, 
this polymer did not reach an equilibrium state of flow even 
in the longest slit, when (n11 -n33)was taken as a criterion. 
(Cf. Fig. 1.56, as obtained for a similar polymer.) Presumably, 
however, this latter finding was at least partly a conse-
quence of remembering elongational flow in the entrance zone. 
This flow, however, is ineffective in the 2,3-plane of shear 
near the capillary wall. 
In principal, a linear increase of the path difference 
with the capillary length can also be due to an increase of 
144 

pressure in the reservoir, which is needed to maintain the same 
flow rate with increasing capillary length. This increasing 
pressure can cause increasing strain birefringence in the 
upstream window. This possibility, however, was excluded by 
Wales by pressurizing the unit at closed exit, so that no flow 
occurred. No birefringence which would disturb the measure-
ments, was created in this way in the windows. 
In the following two figures, as taken from the monograph 
by Wales, a comparison is given of the steady state values of 
several types of birefringences at corresponding rates of 
shear for a silicone fluid (Siloprene RS) at 22 0 C and for a low 
density polyethylene (IUPAC A) at 1900 C. In Fig. 1.68 the re-
sults, as obtained on Siloprene RS are shown. In this figure the 
uppermost curve gives 
ßn, as measured in the 1,2-plane in a 
coaxial cylinder apparatus (contributed by W. Philippoff, closed 
symbols) and in the cone-and-plate unit (open symbols).

(cf. 2nd eq. (1.2.3)), with X being determined in the cone-
and-plate unit. The lowest curve gives n 33-n22 , as measured 
in the just described way at the walls of three capillaries. 
It is seen that n 33-n 22 is qbout 10% of n 11 -n 22 over almost 
two decades in the shear rate. The impression that n 33-n22 
is more parallel to 
ßn than to n 11 -n22 is partly illusary 
and due to the steeper slope at low rates of shear. 
In Fig. 1.69 similar results are shown for LDPE IUPAC A. 
In addition to D.n, n 11 -n33 and n 33-n22 also measurements of 
n 11 -n33 , as obtained in the slit rheometer with the aid of 
the procedure given by eqs. (1.2.18) through (1.2.21), are in-
cluded. The measurements in the cone-and-plate unit were 
carried out at 1500 C and converted to 1900 C by temperature

shifting. In this way, for 1900 values of n 11 -n22 belonging 
to relatively high shear rates are obtained. Within the 
accuracy of the measurements these values agree with the 
n 11 -n33 values directly measured at 1900 C and comparable 
shear rates. If one realizes that, at corresponding values 
of the shear rate, n 33-n22 is ab out ten per cent of n 11 -n22 , 
one also knows that n 11 -n33 is only ten per cent lower than 
n 11 -n22 • This consideration, however, does not satisfy the 
observer of Fig. 1.69 completely. There is astrange discon-
tinuity in the n 11 -n22 values at q 
~ 1 s-1. With increasing 
shear rate the phenomenon of overshoot occurs for the first 
in a "stressing experiment" at this shear rate. True equili-
brium flow is not attainable within reasonable experimental 
times in a region of shear rates just a little higher than 
-1 
q = 1 s 
• At still higher shear rates equilibrium is 
obtained after a few minutes. Apart from this blemish n 33-n22 
is seen to be about ten per cent of n 11 -n22 as mentioned 
above. 
The results for Styron 678 at 1900 C are not shown here. 
These results are analogous to those for the silicone fluid 
(see Fig. 1.68) and have been published several times (see e.g. 
ref. 102)). 
Finally, in Fig. 1.70 a collection is given of all 
values of the quotient (n33-n22)/(n11-n22)' as obtained 
with diverse polymer melts and a concentrated solution 
(furnished by W. Philippoff). The values of this quotient 
lie between 0,05 and 0,14. This is the order found with the 
most reliable normal stress measurements. Also in suitably 
sliced injection moulded samples the frozen-in birefrin-
gence showed values of n 33-n22 of about 10% of the n 11 -n22 
values. 
In this way, Wales was able to give clear evidence of 
the fact that n 33-n22 is small compared with n 11 -n22 , but 
certainly finite for polymer melts. One of the tasks of 
the theoreticians will be to construct convincing fluid 
models which describe this effect where also inequality (1.2.46) 
147 

must be observed. As will be shown in Chapters 2 and 3, very 
recently also in this respect great progress has been made.

1.2.3.8 Transient Flow Birefringence Effects. 
This section is appropriately started with a further 
characterization of the polystyrene Hostyren N 4000 V used 
for this and subsequent investigations. Several averages 
of its relative molecular mass are given in Table 1.5. In 
Fig. 1.71 the dynamic moduli GI and G" are giv'en as functions 
of circular frequency at a reference temperature of 1700 C 
as published by Gortemaker et al. 84 ) 104). Original measurements 
were carried out at five temperatures between 1400 C and 
206 0 C. The pertinent shift-factor as a function of tempera-
ture exactly agrees with the one previously given by Wales 
(Fig.1.60), if allowance is made for the differing refe-
rence temperatures. Extensive use has been made of these

later used to calculate a line spectrum according eq. (A.98).

steady state extinction angle curve (cf. Fig. 1.50). Readings 
were done by hand with the aid of a stop-watch at pre-set 
angles. In this way the moments of the passage of the isocline 
were recorded. A more elaborate method had to be applied, when 
the time dependent birefringence was measured. In these measure-
ments retardations were pre-set on the compensator. Simultaneous-
ly the angular positions of the principal direction of the com-
pensator were approximately pre-set, according to the course

method has meanwhile been published by K. Osaki et al. 10B ) 
(see Appendix Cl. 
As also the transient shear stresses were measured 
for the shear rates of the optical experiments, the stress-
optical coefficient could be determined for the transient 
situation, when use was made of eq. (1.2.4). Obviously, the 
stress-optical coefficient is time independent within the 
accuracy of the measurements. The coaxiality of the 
stress and the refractive index tensors was also checked 
for a transient situation. In Fig. 1.75 the ratio 
cot 2 X/cot 2X~, where 
Xoo is the orientation (extinction) 
angle at infinite time (steady state), is plotted versus 
time for a stressing experiment at q = 0,07 s-1 and 
T = 1700 C. Open circles denote the optical measurements. 
These symbols are connected by asolid line. Mechanical 
measurements (cf. eq. (1.2.36)) were carried out with several 
combinations of cone angles and plate diameters. In agree-
ment with Meissner's original findings, delay of the nO~mal 
stress measurement by squeeze damping decreases with in-
creasing cone angle and decreasing plate diameter. With 
reference to this convergence one arrives at the conclusion 
that coaxiality of the respective tensors is also given in 
the transient situation. Another proof of this fact will be 
given below. 
Results of this preliminary research on transient 
properties are summarized in Fig. 1.76. In this figure 
the quotient (cot 2 x)/q, as calculated from the extinction 
angle measurements during stressing experiments, is plotted 
-1 
against time for several shear rates between q = 0,015 s 
and q = 0,07 s-1. One immediately observes that all curves 
have the same initial slope. Dependent on the magnitude of 
the shear rate, they level off at values decreasing with in-
creasing shear rate. A closer inspection shows that devi-
ations from the common course at low times occur always at 
about the same total shear y = q.t (of a little more than 
unity). A common envelope is formed by the solid line 
wrapped in the shaded area. This line is calculated according

identical with Lodge's rubberlike liquid model. For the pur-
pose, use is made of eq. (1.2.36) for cot 2 X.1nto this equa-
tion the expressions (A.89) and (A.90) are inserted for 
012 and for 011-022 = 2 F(t), respectively. After dividing 
this function by q, one obtains a function independent of q, 
which is represented by the mentioned envelope in Fig. 1.76, 
the shaded area indicating the maximum possible systematic 
error. 
154 

From this figure the following conclusions may be 
drawn: 
1) At low total shear, irrespective of the shear 
rate, the experimental curves agree with the prediction 
by Lodge's 
rubberlike liquid model. 
2) For sufficiently low shear rates one may expect 
that the investigated polystyrene melt behaves according to 
this model even at large total shear strains. 
:) The coaxiality of the stress and refractive index 
tensors is proved for low total strains, since the envelope is 
calculated from mechanical measurements (dynamic shear moduli) , 
whereas the experimental points are obtained from optical 
measurements (extinction angles). 
The results shown in Fig. 1.76 remind us of Meissner's 
graph shown in Fig. 1.11. In fact, also in this graph devi-
ations from the (dashed) lines, as calculated according to 
equations similar to eq. (A.89), occur at total strains a little 
more than unity. However, at strains smaller than unity, Meissner's 
results only show that the material behaves according to the 
ordinary theory of linear visco-elasticity. The present results 
permit a more far reaching conclusion: Because of the influence 
of the optical equivalent of the first normal stress difference, 
which is contained in the extinction angle measurement, the 
results of Fig. 1.76 teach us that, at total strains lower 
than unity, the more special fluid model of Lodge's rubberlike 
liquid is applicable. The fact that in Meissner's tensile experi-
ments the upswing of the tensile stressing viscosity (o/Eo )' 
as occurring at larger total Hencky strains, is nearly quan-
titatively described by Lodge's model (for the investigated 
low density polyethylene), does not diminish the importance 
of the above conclusion, which can only be drawn 'on the basis 
of shear experiments (because of the necessary involvement 
of the time dependence of the first normal stress difference). 
Flow birefringence measurements are particularly useful in this 
connection because of the absence of a delay due to squeeze 
damping. Further flow birefringence measurements will be shown 
later, when the usefulness of more special constitutive equa-
tions will be checked. 
155 

As a next subject transient properties of the same 
pOlystyrene, as very recently obtained with the double 
trumpet apparatus of Section 1.2.2.1, will be given. Since 
in this apparatus birefringence and separation force can 
be measured simultaneously, one can hope to obtain the stress-
optical coefficient at once. For this purpose a graph was 
prepared by J.A. van Aken109 ). In this graph reproduced here 
as Fig. 1.77, the birefringence is plotted against the 
separation pressure at the rim of the trumpets, as obtained 
during several cycles of stressing and subsequent relaxation. 
The values of the nominal (reduced) strain rates E are given 
z 
in the caption to the figure. All points representing steady 
performance conditions, lie on a straight line with a slope 
-9 
-1 
of -3,6.10 
Pa 
• One can see that during the build-up of 
birefringence and stress the separation pressure grows faster 
than the birefringence. This is shown by the curvatures of 
the lines connecting pertinent experimental points. One can 
only guess why this occurs. As will be shown below, the bire-
fringence grew as if it were created in an ideal flow field. 
This means that the reasons for the more than proportional 
growth of stresses must be found in fluid layers in the 
vicinity of the wall where the light be am does not pass by. 
A point of special interest is that at the moment, when flow 
is stopped, the separation pressure quickly decreases to a 
value about ten per cent lower, whereas subsequent stress 
relaxation happens at a much slower pace. This is corroborated 
by the birefringence which only shows the usual slow relaxa-
tion. In fact, all birefringences measured during this relaxa-
tion and plotted against the pertinent stresses, lie on a 
single straight line, which possesses a somewhat higher slope 
-9 
-1 
of -4,0.10 
Pa 
, which corresponds exactly with thestress-
optical coe·fficient as obtained in most accurat'e shear ex-
periments81 ). Apparently, as soon as flow has stopped (near 
the wall), the linear stress-optical rule is exactly obeyed. 
In Fig. 1.78 the behaviour of the birefringence during 
the stressing experiments is demonstr2ted. From this figure 
one learns that the investigated polystyrene behaves very 
much like a linear visco-elastic body at the temperatures of

coefficient C = 4,00.10- 9 pa- 1 , as obtained from the 
most accurate shear data81 ). The transient stresses obtained 
in this way were used for the calculation of the stressing 
viscosities OZZ/EZ as functions of time. For the purpose, 
temperature shifting was applied to ~z' as occurring in the 
denominator of the stressing viscosity 0 
/E , and to t.

Shift factors, as obtained by Gortemaker, were used for the 
purpose. At the reference temperature of 1700 C, all curves 
fall on the upper side of a single master curve, which is in-
dependently calculated with the aid of the dynamic moduli 
G' and G" according to eq. (A.89), where q is replaced 
by 3 EZ • This nearly linear behaviour is not too surprising 
158 

in view of Fig. 1.14, which holds for the positive extension 
of a pOlystyrene of a higher average molecular mass (compare 
the viscosities at zero strain rates!) and for a lower tempera-
ture. In this figure a practically "Troutonian" behaviour of 
the elongational viscosity was found up to tensile stresses 
corresponding to (positive) elongation rates of the order of 
-1 
0,1 s 
. (In shear both polymers are very non-Newtonian!) 
The reader may observe that some transient data in 
positive elongation experiments, as carried out by Matsumoto 
and Bogue, have already been reviewed in Section 1.2.3.1 at 
the occasion of the discussion of the limits of validity of 
the linear stress-optical rule. 
From Fig. 1.78 one may deduce that the average total 
strain of E = -3,4, as 
available in the present double 
trumpet apparatus (see eq. (1.2.17)), is just sufficient 
for the establishment of an equilibrium fluid flow (steady 
state in the "particles" of the fluid), at least for the 
polystyrene investigated. In fact, curve 9 for the extension 
rate of -3,10.10- 1 s-1, which possesses the highest absolute 
value, levels off at a reduced time of 10 seconds. This means 
a total strain of -3,1. Of course, at E = -3,4 the steady 
state operation of the apparatus will inevitably occur. 
Nevertheless, a look on Fig. 1.79, in which the "steady" state 
viscosities are plotted versus reduced extension rate, shows 
us that we cannot be far off from equilibrium flow. In fact, 
an increase above the zero strain rate value is not very 
probable. (The dashed line is calculated according to the 
theory of D. Acierno, F.P. La Mantia, G. Marrucci and coopera-
tors110) 111) 112), which has proven to describe transient 
shear properties of the investigated polystyrene very weI1113), 
with adjustable parameter a = 0,35, which is used also for 
the present calculations109 ). 
Finally, in Fig. 1.80 tensile stress relaxation after 
cessation of steady flow is shown for the investigated poly-
styrene at 1700 C. Every point in this graph represents an 
optical measurement and the corresponding mechanical stress-

relaxation measurement. In fact, within 1 second after the 
cessation of flow the rim pressure has dropped to a value which 
can also be calculated from the optical measurements with the 
aid of C = -4,0.10- 9 pa- 1 . Further relaxation always takes much 
more time (at the temperatures of the measurements!). Results 
are plotted in a way usual in linear viscoelasticity: Relaxing 
stresses (reduced to unity previous strain rate) are subtracted 
from their previous steady state values. (The term "rel axing 
viscosities" would be very unsuitable, indeed, like the term 
"s tressing viscosities" which has become common.) In this 
way a comparison can be made with the "s tressing visco-
sity" as calculated by interconversion from the (linear) 
dynamic moduli (dashed line, according eq. A.89). When in-
specting Fig. 1.80 one notices that the relaxation behaviour 
after steady one-sided compressional (i.e. two-dimensional ex-
tensional) flow is very much that of a linear elastico-viscous 
fluid for this polystyrene at the applied strain rates.

The conclusion that, during the build-up of stresses, 
birefringence measurements furnish more reliable data than 
direct mechanical measurements, is corroborated by a few results 
published by r.1a.::osko et al. 80). Stress-relaxation measurements, 
however, are as accurate as birefringence measurfuents in the 
double trumpet apparatus. 
At the end of Chapter 1 one has to conclude that a 
more thorough understanding of the presented experimental data 
can only be achieved with the aid of more elaborate fluid models. 
The discussion of those models will be tried in the following 
two chapters.

2 Quasi-Molecular Phenomenological Theories 
2.1 Rubber Elasticity 
2.1.1 Results of the Kinetic Theory 
As has been pointed out by A.S. Lodge1), the eonstitutive 
equation for the ideal rubber forms an advantageous starting 
point for the eonstruetion of suitable eonstitutive equations 
for polymerie fluids. On the other hand, it is well known 
that real rubbery materials do not obey the ideal equations 
derived from the statistieal theory. From these faets it 
appears worth while to start the ehapter on the theory of 
rubber-like liquids with a diseussion of the main problems 
arising in the deseription of rubber elastieity. 
The most eompaet formulation of the result of the 
statistieal theory is as follows 2): 
••• (2.1.1) 
where g is the stress tensor (its eomponents being "traetions"), 
p is the hydrostatie pressure, G is the shear modulus and ~ is 
the Finger strain tensor. This latter tensor is defined in 
terms of the (asymmetrie) deformation gradient ~ as: 
~ 
-1 
-1 
<r,-l)T 
= 
~ 
= r, 
••• (2.1.2) 
where 
dx' 
= r, 
dx 
••• (2.1.3) 
serves as the definition of the deformation gradient and 
••• (2.1.4) 
170 

is the Cauchy strain tensor. In eq. (2.1.3) the coordinate x 
describes the position of a material point in a convected 
coordinate system. As a consequence, x does not change with 
time. It is a label for the point considered. At the time t 
of observation this convected coordinate system is assumed to 
be Cartesian and coinciding with the space fixed coordinate 
system. The coordinate ~'(t') gives the position of the same 
material point at any time t' in the Cartesian space coordi-
nate system. (In the case of a solid rubber t and t' can simply 
be considered as two states of deformation.) 
The Cauchy strain tensor describes the change of the 
square of the distance between two material points in a 
homogeneous deformation, whereas the Finger strain tensor 
describes the change of the square of the area of a flat 
surface element cut in the body. Both tensors are symmetrie 
as follows from their definitions. The same holds, as is 
well-known, for the stress-tensor, to which ~ is related in 
a most simple way by eq. (2.1.1). It appears that the sta-
tistical theory, which is not reproduced here, just furnishes 
the simple relation given by eq. (2.1.1). 
In Cartesian space coordinates the components of the 
Finger strain tensor are given by: 
a x.

whereas those of the Cauchy tensor read: 
= 
I:

(2.1 .6) 
Conveniently, the components for these two tensors are given 
in matrix form for the two most important types of homo-
geneous deformation, vize for shear and for uniaxial extension. 
If the shear planes are per-pendicular to the 2-direction 
and move in the 1-direction, one obtains for a shear of 
171 

magnitude y the following components*):

Since 022 and 033 are zero in this experiment, one 
obtains p = G A- 1 and finally: 
= 
(2.1.12) 
which is a well-known result2). It is also well-known that an 
ideal rubber exerts normal stresses in shear (eq. (2.1.7) into 
eq. (2.1.1)):

Subtracting respective equations one obtains: 
o 
••• (2.1.14) 
As P is determined by the boundary conditions, only diffe-
rences of normal stresses are predicted by the constitutive 
equation. For the shear stress one obtains: 
G Y 
(2.1.15) 
According to eq. (2.1.15) an ideal rubber behaves as 
a "new-Hookean" 
body, which means that the linear relation 
between shear y and shear stress 012 persists up to high 
values of the shear. At the same time, however, one needs 
constraining forces to keep the lateral dimension (in the 
direction normal to the shear planes) constant, in order to 
preserve the simple shear deformation. 
As to shear some words should be said with respect to 
the orientation of the principal axes of the stress tensor 
(or of the stress ellipsoid). Since those axes are defined 
as the l10rmals to sectional planes on which no shear stresses 
act, one can easily see that the 3-axis (neutral axis) of our 
coordinate system is a principal axis. On the other hand, 
173 

the 2-axis (normal to the shearing planes) is certainly no 
principal axis, as the shear stress which causes the shear 
deformation acts on these planes. However, as the 3-axis is 
a principal axis, the other two axes must lie in the 1,2-plane. 
A single angle is sufficient to describe their positions. In 
general, one chooses an angle X, smaller than n/4, as formed 
by one of the principal axes (called I-axis) and the shear-
direction (1-axis). If the components of the stress tensor, 
which are 0I 
and all in the principal axes land II, are 
transformed to the laboratory coordinate system, one obtains 
with 0I - all

(2.1.16) 
ßO 
cos 2 X = 0 11 -
0 22 
(2.1.17) 
If now the second equation is divided by the first 
equation, one obtains: 
2 cot 2X 
= 
(2.1.18) 
Using eqs. (2.1.14) and (2.1.15) and (2.1.18) one obtains: 
2 cot 2X = Y 
(2.1.19) 
This equation will be compared with the one obtained for 
rubber-like liquids in connection with the recoil of 
those fluids. 
Since the tensor ellipsoids of the stress tensor and 
the Finger tensor must be coaxial, one can derive the orienta-
tion angle X also from the (kinematic) Finger tensor. For 
the purpose one has to solve the equation 
174 
TI. = 
-J. 
(2.1.20) 

in searching for the eigenvectors ~i' for which their pro-
ducts with the Finger tensor are coaxial with themselves. 
For each of the two vectors located in the 1,2-plane, one 
obtains instead of eq. (2.1.20) the following set of expli-
cit equations: 
+ 
= 
+ 
= 
(2.1.21) 
where n 1 and n 2 are the components of the vector with respect 
to the 1- and 2-axes, respectively. (lf A2 + 1, n 3 
must vanish 
identically: See the components of the Finger tensor according 
to eq. (2.1.7).) But also for n 1 and n 2 
a solution is only 
given, if the corresponding determinant vanishes, i.e.: 
= 0 
y 
..• (2.1.22) 
This yields: 
... (2.1.22a) 
2 
This equation can more easily be solved with respect to y • lf 
only the positive root is considered, one obtains: 
y 
= 
1 
A -
T 
... (2.1.23) 
where A = AI in accordance with the definition of the orien-
tat ion angle X given above. lf this result is used in, say, the 
second equation (2.1.21), one obtains for the eigenvector of 
the l-axis:

••• (2.1.24) 
Because of the condition of constant volume one simply 
has All = 1/ AI , since AIII = 1 (see the remark after eq. 
(2.1.21)). The components of the two mutually perpendicu-
lar eigenvectors in the 1,2-plane can be given in the form 
of the orthogonal transformation matrix

are given by the first column, those of ~II by the second column. 
Equation (2.1.24) is used for the calculation of the right 
side of eq. (2.1.25). The diagonal matrix of the squares 
of the extension ratios is given by 
..• (2.1.26) 
where Astands for AI and A-1 
for All' 
It is easy to verify that the following relation holds: 
~2 
••• (2.1.27) 
where eq. (2.1.23) is finally used to reproduce ~ in the form 
of eq. (2.1.7) 
(omitting the third row and the third column). 
In later sections these equations will be used to 
construct a rubber-like fluid. In connection with the de-
scription of the flow birefringence it is important to 
realize that the ideal rubber according to eq. (2.1.1) obeys 
the linear stress-optical rule, as will be discussed in the 
next main section more explicitly. 
176 

2.1.2 Behaviour of Real Rubbers 
The classical way to describe the behaviour of areal 
rubber is characterized by the use of the Mooney-Rivlin-
equation2 ). In tensor notation this equation reads: 
= 
(2.1.28) 
where C1 and C2 are adjustable parameters. In shear one 
obtains the following expression for the shear stress: 
= 
(2.1.29) 
In elongation one has the following "true" tension: 
all = 2 Cl 0. 2 - l) 
2 C2 (~ -
\ ) = 
\ 
\2 
0. 2 
l) (Cl 
C2 
(2. 1 • 30) 
= 2 
-
+ -X-) 
\ 
In this equation 022 is put equal to zero as in eq. (2.1.12). 
According to Mooney and to Rivlin and Saunders 3 ) one has to 
plot the quantity 011/(\2 -
1/\) against 1/\. In this way 
a straight line should be obtained. The two constants can 
then be derived in the usual way. However, as shown in 
Fig. 2.1, the two constants, and particularly C2 , were 
found to be different for elongation ((1/\) 
< 1) and for 
one-sided compression. This points to the fact that the range 
of \-values in which an (approximate) eq. (2.1.30) is valid, 
must be rather limited5). 
According to Rivlin the state of stress of an incom-
pressible elastic solid can be given in terms of the strain-
energy function W which, on its part, can be written as a Taylor 
expansion in terms of the first and the second invariants 
1 1 and 1 2 of the Finger tensor: 
177 

W 
= 
I: 
i=O 
I: 
j=O 
.•• (2.1.31) 
where the C~J' are constant coefficients (with C 
= 0). The 
..L 
4)00 
invariants are given by (See e.g. DPL., Vol.I 
• eq. A-15): 
r 1

AIIr 2 Ar 2 
= 
+ 
+ 
r 3 
Ar 2 AI! 2 AIIr 2 
= 
(2.1.32) 
... 
Apparently, W must be zero, if no deformation is applied. In 
that case all A'S are equal to one. Because of the constant 
volume condition invariant 1 3 becomes equal to one for all 
values of A and 1 2 can then be written as: 
••• (2.1.32a) 
where one of the Ai'S still depends on the two others. 
It may be observed that the first invariant of the Finger 
tensor is equal to the second invariant of the Cauchy tensor 
and vice versa, if 1 3 = 1. 
For elongation the tensile force fand the tension 011 
are calculated as follows: 
f 
= 
9W/ClR. 
= 
(aW/<lA) O/t ) 
o 
Since W is related to the unit of volume, one has V = 1 = a~ 
= ao 
~o ' where V is the unit vo lume , 
~ is its length and a its 
cross-sectional area. One has as a quite general result: 
all = f/a 
178 
= tf = (t/t ) (<lW/<lA) = 
o 
A(<lW/aA) 
••• (2.1.33) 

If W only contains the two linear terms of the expansion 
(2.1.31), Le.: 
(2.1.31a) 
one finds with AI

that C10 = C1 
and C01 = C2 of the Mooney equation. 
According to Tschoeg15 ) and others 2), from the 
failure of eq. (2.1.30), as demonstrated by Fig. 2.1, the 
conclusion must be drawn that the expansion given by eq. 
(2.1.31a), which is restricted to linear terms, is quite in-
sufficient for the description of the behaviour of areal 
rubber. Unfortunately, one has to take many higher order terms 
of the expansion in order to obtain a satisfactory description. 
This was demonstrated by S. Kawabata6 ). 
This fact induced ogden7 ) and, independently, Tschoegl 
and coop.5) to use expressions in which the exponent 
of ~ 
is determined by experiment. Such a semiempirical equation

g, + p1, = 2 G ~n/2 
n 
(2.1.35) 
where the exponent n is the only adjustable parameter. For 
n 
2 one obtains the behaviour of an ideal rubber. For 
n 
< 2 equations are obtained which describe the behaviour 
of real rubbers reasonably weIl. For the tensile stress 011 
the following relation is obtained: 
(2.1.36 ) 
If this 011 is used in the Mooney plot, one obtains a function 
(An _A-n / 2 ) / 
(A2_A- 1 ) against A- 1 . With x = A- 1 one has 
F(x) 
= 
n/2

x

x 
(2.1 .37) 
For n < 2 this function has a maximum at x = 1. Starting 
from x = 1 it decreases rather fast with decreasinq x, but 
decreases rather slowly with increasing x. With this function 
experimental data could be fitted by adjusting just the single 
parameter n. The obtained approximation holds for one-sided 
compression as weIl as for el9ngation. The tensor ~n/2 was 
called the "n-measure of strain" by Tschoegl and cooperators. 
It comprises for n = 1 the inverse of the right stretch tensor, 
for n = -1 the right stretch tensor and for n = -2 the Cauchy 
tensor <;;;. 
For shear experiments, the "n-measure of strain" is 
calculated from the equation: 
~n/2 = ß, 
(2.1.38) 
which has a structure analogous to that of eq. (2.1.27). 
In fact, all these strain tensors, and in particular the 
Finger and the Cauchy tensors, have the same eigen vectors, 
their tensor ellipsoids being coaxial. From

unfortunately, it is not easy to express this matrix in terms 
of shear y = A-
A- 1 (see eq. (2.1.23)) 
so that (Bikn / 2) 
cannot be given in a simple form analogous to that of eq. 
(2.1.7). Hqwever, it is interesting enough to discuss some 
special cases. For instance:

(2.1.40) 
This holds independently of the chosen value of n, in parti-
cular also for the Cauchy tensor and the other mentioned 
kinematic strain tensors. Of great interest is the behaviour 
of the "n - measure of strain" at small shear deformations. One 
obtains:

The first and the third equation show that, for small y, 
the n-measure gives identical results with those of the Finger 
tensor. Perhaps most interesting is the second equation. It 
shows that the difference of B22n / 2 -
B33n / 2 , which produces 
the "second normal stress difference" 022 -
033 according to 
181 

eq. (2.1.35), is dependent on n. For n = 2 one obtains the well-
known result, i.e. 022 -
033 = O. For values of n somewhat 
smaller than two, however, one obtains a finite and negative 
022 -
033 ' qualitatively in accordance with experimental 
findings. 
For n = 1,5 one f-inds for the ratio of the first to 
the second normal stress difference a value of -(1/8). 
For large values of y one has y~ A' At the same time 
powers of A with a negative exponent become negligible also in 
eq. (2.1.39). For 1< n <

For n < 1 an instable situation would be created. Interestingly 
enough, for n = 2 these equations give the correct tensor 
components for all values of y from zero to infinity. It should 
be mentioned that no experiments in shear are known to the 
author which allow a quantitative check of equations (2.1.42). 
At the end of this section it should be emphasized 
that there is also no molecular theory which supports the 
form of these equations for real rubbers. There are some indi-
cations, however, that the Mooney term C2 has something to 
do with the topology of the network8). This means that, by the 
introduction of the more general equations, the validity of 
the linear stress-optical relation, on which the selection 
of the rheological constitutive equations is based in this 
monograph, is not necessarily spoiled. In fact, it will be 
shown in the next section that the linear stress-optical rule 
can be deduced from the increments to the stress and the re-
fractive index tensors, as furnished separately 
by every 
segment of a chain between two constraints. The only condition 
is that such a segment contains enough random links to be 
treated in the usual statistical way.

2.2 The Linear Stress-Optical Relation 
2.2.1 Results of the Kinetic Theory of Flexible Chain Moleeules 
According to Treloar2 ) the deviatoric components of the 
refractive index tensor and of the stress tensor are simply 
proportional to each other for an ideal rubber. This state-
ment is expressed by the following equation: 
I:;n 
= C I:; 0, 
(2.2.1) 
where I:;n 
is the difference between two principal refractive 
indices, which can be measured as a birefringence in a 
suitable arrangement, C is the stress-optical coefficient 
and 1:;0 is the difference between the respective principal 
stresses. In tensor notation one has: 
(J1 -
n JJ 
= 
C (,51 + p ,1,) 
(2.2.2) 
where n is the average refractive index of the birefringent 
medium. The positive sign of the hydrostatic pressure p holds 
because of the stresses being introduced as tractions. In 
this sense, p is a negative traction. By the way, one can 
speak of a refractive index tensor only by virtue of the 
fact that n is large compared with I:;n. This will become clear 
below when the components of ~ are derived from those of the 
polarizability tensor. 
Treloar calculated the birefringence of a piece of 
rubber, independently stretched in three mutually'perpendi-
cular directions, by assuming that one third of all chains 
is directed in each of the mentioned directions, all chains 
having the same end-to-end distance in the undeformed material. 
In this way he obtained equations relating the principal pola-
rizabilities to the stretching ratios. He showed that these 
equations had the same form as those relating the principal 
stresses to the stretching ratios. By comparison of these 
183 

two sets of equations he arrived at the result formulated in 
*) 
eqs. (2.2.1) and (2.2.2) 
• 
In the context of this monograph, however, it should be 
mentioned that the present author has shown a rather long time 
ago that the complicated procedure followed by Treloar falls 
short of generality9) 10). In fact, one notices that an arbi-
trarily chosen single chain segment (as found between two 
cross-links), furnishes average contributions to the stress 
tensor and the polarizability tensor, which are already pro-
portional to each other, so that the proportionality of the 
total tensors finds its origin in the behaviour of single 
chains which are considered as little thermodynamic systems. 
This consideration has the advantage that the permanent cross-
links of a rubber can be replaced by temporary points of ent-
anglement. As a consequence, a more relaxed condition for the 
validityof the linear stress-optical rule is found, viz. that 
the average life time of an entanglement point must be much 
larger than the time for thermodynamic equilibration within 
the little thermodynamic system formed by the chain segment. 
Expiicitly, the average contributions or increments 
of a chain segment to the stress and refractive index tensors 
are:

= (3/5)

where aik are the components of the stress-tensor increment, 
aik the components of the polarizability tens~r increment, b2 
is the mean square end-to-end distance of the segment (with 
respect to its momentary length), r i are the components 
of the end-to-end vector of the segment and a 1 - a 2

is the difference between the polarizabilities of the 
Kuhn random link in its direction and perpendicular to this 
direction. Equation (2.2.3) was first given by J.J.Hermans 11 ), 
whereas the basis for eq. (2.2.4) was laid by W. Kuhn and 
F.GrÜn in a famous paper12 ) .*) 
In eq. (2.2.3) the statistical restoring force 
f 
••• (2.2.5) 
which pulls the end-points to each other, is contained. 
The stress component o'k is obtained, if the component f, 
~ 
~ 
of this force with respect to the i-axis is multiplied by 
the fraction r k of chain segments with an end-to-end vector 
E, which are intersected by the unit surface area of a plane 
normal to the k-axis. The optical anisotropy of the chain back-
bone is modelled in terms of a 1 -
a 2 
for the random link. As 
D.W. Saunders13 ) and the Leningrad schoo1 14 ) have shown, this 
is only a matter of convenience. 
Apparently, the proportionality factor between a ik 
and 0ik reads:

tropie system, one obtains for the difference of the molar

stress-optical coefficient one obtains by this procedure: 
c

(2.2.8) 
This is a well-known expression. It shows that the 
stress-optical coefficient is mainly dependent on the back-
bone anisotropy of the chain molecules. There is a slight 
dependence on temperature which is not only determined by 
the kT-factor in the denominator, but also by the tempera-
ture dependence of u 1 -
u 2 • There is absolutely no dependence 
on the molecular mass or on the distribution of molecular 
masses in the sample, as there is no dependence on segment 
lengths in a vulcanized rubber. All these facts are strictly 
corroborated by the experimental findings, as has been shown in 
the experimental part.

Footnote: According to the SI-system one should use a factor 
(1/380 ) instead of (4n/3) in front of the expressions on 
the right, the polarizabilities no longer being expressed in 
volume per random link but in m2F per link (8 .•• permissivity 
o 
of the vacuum). As this replacement would create a quite 
unusual appearance of eq. (2.2.8), the author refrained 
from this revision. The dimension of C as m2N- 1 = Pa-1 
remains untouched, if the volume of the link and kT are 
expressed in SI-units. 

2.2.2 Can the Linear Stress-Optical Rule be Understood also 
without the Assumption of a Temporary Network Structure? 
Just because of the very wide range of conditions of 
deformation and flow, under which the linear stress-optical 
relation holds experimentally, an attempt should be made, 
to find a more general explanation for its applicability 
and, eventually, the limits of its validity. In the search 
for systems not necessarily consisting of a network or, 
what appears to be equivalent in the sense of the derivation 
given in the previous section, of phantom chain molecules 
which interact with their surroundings only in their end-
points, the present author has made some observations 
put down in his review article on the flow birefringence of 
elastico-viscous polymer systems 10). 
As a basis for these considerations the early work by 
W.Kuhn and H.Kuhn has been used15 ). In aseries of papers these 
authors pointed out that the viscosity increment of a dilute 
suspension of anisotropic rigid particles contains a rotary 
"diffusion" part lind and a "hydrodynamic" part lInh. The 
second part is caused by extra energy dissipation in the fluid 
surrounding the particle. If the particle approaches the shape 
of a sphere, the diffusion part goes to zero, whereas the 
hydrodynamic part becomes equal to the well-known viscosity 
increment calculated by Einstein. In a tedious comparison of 
theoretical results, as given by W.Kuhn, H. Kuhn and P.Buchner16 ), 
the present author observed that, irrespective of the de-
tailed shape of the particles (rods, ellipsoids of revolution 
or dumbbells), the rotary diffusion part of the viscosity 
increment, when modelied as a shear stress increment 012 
(= shear rate times lind) and combined with its orCientational 
birefringence increment n 12 = (lln/2) sin 2x, furnished a 
stress-optical coefficient similar to the one given by 
eq. (2.2. 8) . 
Unfortunately, at the time these observations were 
made, the useful derivations by R.B. Bird and cooperators17 ) 
with respect to the hydrodynamics of rigid dumbbells had 
187 

not yet appeared. These authors give, based on a differen-
tial equation for the stress-tensor derived by Giesekus, 
the contribution of a rigid dumbbell to the stress tensor 
of a flowing dilute suspension of these dumbbells. The 
deviatoric components of this contribution read: 
.•• (2.2.9) 
where 
~ is the friction factor of the beads at the ends of 
the dumbbell, as connected by phantom rods of leng~h L, 
KR,m are the components of the traceless tensor given by 
the velocity gradient*) and r i are the components of 
the end-to-end vector of constant le~gth L. The angular 
brackets indicate here the averaging over the angular 
distribution of orientations, this distribution being deter-
mined by the interaction between solvent flow and rotary 
diffusion of the dumbbells. 
If the origin of the second term on the right side of 
eq. (2.2.9) is traced back, it appears that this term is 
exclusively caused by the rotary diffusion moments created 
in the system when the orientational distribution is not 
isotropie. At this point it should be emphasized that these 
moments do not explicitly depend on theshape of the particles 
or on possible obstructions as caused by neighbour dumbbells. 
These latter circumstances do influence the rate of (rotary) 
diffusion but not the driving forces (turning moments) for 
this diffusion. As is well-known, the source behind these 
forces is the thermal motion characterized by the equipar-
tition principle. Admittedly, by the rate of diffusion the 
orientational distribution is determined. But this distribution 
is not specified in the second term on the right side of 
eq. (2.2.9). 
*) Footnote: In Bird's notation ~ is the transpose of the 
velocity gradient. 
188 

So, one arrives at the conclusion that this term is of 
a guite general nature independent of details of the model 
system and of the conditions of macroscopic flow or defor-
mation. 
The observations sketched in the second paragraph can 
now be regained for a more general situation and in a tensor 
formulation. By crossing off the first term on the right 
side of eg. (2.2.9) the "hydrodynamic" part of the stress 
tensor is deleted, if the terminology of W. Kuhn and H.Kuhn 
is adopted. As before, we do not ask whether this procedure 
makes sense *). We just observe the conseguences. 
The average contribution of an oblong particle to the 
polarizability tensor can easily be calculated. If Y1 -
Y2 
is the difference of the polarizabilities of the particle 
in its direction and perpendicular to this direction and 
n 
= E/L is the unit vector characterizing its orientation, 
one obtains: 
••• (2.2.10) 
The proportionality factor between u ik and the truncated 
0ik is now by analogy with eg. (2.2.6). 
• .• (2.2.11) 
According to W.Kuhn and F. Grün the average difference 
of polarizabilities of a statistical chain molecule is given 
by: 
= 
••. (2.2.12) 
Footnote: In fact, in the case of the rigid dumbbell the 
hydrodynamic part ßnh 
of the viscosity increment amounts 
to (2/5)th and the diffusion part ßnd to (3/5)th of the 
total (See the mentioned review10) and Bird et al. 17)). 
189 

If this expression is used instead of Y1 -
Y2 in eq. (2.2.11), 
one regains eq. (2.2.6) of the previous section. 
Several interesting conclusions can be drawn from 
these considerations. 
1) A derivation of the stress-optical coefficient is 
sketched, which does not contain the assumption 
that forces act only on discrete end points of 
chains or chain segments. 
2) There is no general reason, however, to assume that 
eq. (2.2.9) can be truncated or, in other words, 
that the "hydrodynamic" part can be deleted. This 
means that the linear stress-optical rule cannot 
be considered as a general law. In fact, if the 
"hydrodynamic" part is retained, the ratio of a.ik 
and 0ik becomes dependent on the rate of deforma-
tion and does no longer form a constant stress-
optical coefficient. 
3) However, as a constant stress-optical coefficient 
is revealed under practically all flow situations 
investigated up to now for polymer melts (except 
for exorbitant tensile stresses), one should take 
this experience seriously and seek for an explana-
tion, why the "hydrodynamic" part of the stress tensor 
may be so small compared with its "diffusion" part. 
In this connection it must be emphasized that the tem-
porary network theory cannot furnish this explanation. By 
the assumption of phantom chains between cross-links or 
entanglements it automatically excludes any contribution 
which may be caused by internal friction. 
Only recently, as a consequence of the ingenious ideas, as 
proposed by P.G. de Gennes 18 )and by M. Doi and S.F. Edwards19), 
we learnt to understand at least qualitatively, why the 
"hydrodynamic" 
or direct dissipation term may be relatively 
so small in a concentrated macromolecular system. According 
to these authors an individual macromolecule in a deforming 
190 

concentrated system is extremely restricted in its movements. 
In particular, the lateral movement of chain segments, which 
is essential for the rotary diffusion of the molecule as a 
whole, is extremely hampered, whereas the longitudinal (one 
dimensional) movement of the molecule along its own curved 
wormlike trace is still relatively easy. 
As a matter of fact, a close inspection of the mech-
anism of the "hydrodynamic" energy dissipation, as taking 
place in the fluid surrounding a rigid dumbbell, reveals 
that the relative movement of the fluid with respect to 
the beads of the dumbbe~l is always in a radial direction 
(outward or inward, depending on the momentary orientation 
of the dumbbell). On the other hand, the angular component 
of the macroscopic flow field does not cause any direct 
energy dissipation, since this component is slavishly 
followed by the beads of the rigid dumbbell. Only the 
Brownian motion serves for occasional interruptions of this 
movement. This means that crossing off the first term on the 
right side of eq. (2.2.9) is equivalent to disregarding 
the consequences of fluid flow along the end-to-end vector 
of the dumbbell. By this operation a relatively large part 
of the pertinent viscosity increment is lost. It seems, 
however, that direct energy dissipation plays only a minor 
role in concentrated systems of macromolecular chains with 
respect to the energy los ses which are the consequence of 
the bUild-up of orientation and subsequent disorientation 
by Brownian motion *). In fact, as pointed out above, the 
longitudinal movement of the surroundings with respect to 
the considered chain is relativelyunhampered. 
,-
*) Footnote: If one compares an ideal macromolecular system 
with an ideal gas, one notices that with isothermal de-
formation (corresponding to the compression of the gas) 
the work done on the system is completely transformed 
into heat. With subsequent interna I disorientation 
(expansion into vacuum) no further heat production is 
observed. 
191 

In conclusion one may state that flow birefringence is 
at a key position with respect to the judgement of the 
correctness of several simplifications made in polymer 
rheology. 
2.3 The Most Simple Rubberlike Liquid Model 
2.3.1 Introduction 
Lodge's argument for the choice of eq. (2.1.1) 
as a starting equation has been that polymeric fluids have 
much in common with rubbery materials. In fact, both types 
of materials consist of long .chain molecules densely packed, 
and both exist only at temperatures well above the glass 
transition. This also means that many properties are comparable 
with those of low molecular fluids. As an example the bulk 
modulus may be mentioned, which is so large that stresses 
which are sufficient to cause large deformations in shear 
or elongation, are insufficient to change the volume con-
siderably. Another feature is the apparent internal equili-
brat ion which leads to the fact that stresses and birefrin-
gence have the orientation of chain segments as a common 
and almost exclusive reason. In a somewhat simplified 
picture, the only difference between the structures of 
polymeric fluids and rubbers is given by the fact that 
cross-links are permanent in rubbers, but temporary in 
polymeric fluids, where the temporary cross-links are 
assumed to possess life-times which are still large com-
pa red with the times needed for the internal equilibration 
mentioned above. Very often temporary cross-links are 
thought to be caused by the entanglement of the chain mole-
cules. 
For our present purpose this description is attrac-
tive as it furnishes automatically a justification for the 
assumption of the extended validity of the linear stress-
optical rule. In fact, the validity of the linear stress-
192 

optical rule can only be explained in terms of a molecular 
consideration. Phenomenological theories can never predict such 
a specific behavior. This means also that only those generaliza-
tions of Lodge"s elastic liquid model will deserve our interest, 
which clearly show a connection with the molecular model of 
Sect. 2.2. As a consequence, phenomenological theory will be 
used at the most for a 
classification~ This reasoning re-
.leases the author from the obligation to compete with several 
recently published excellent treatises or text books 4 ) 20) 
on rheology. With this statement, however, the author does 
not want to emphasize that the model of temporary networks 
is the only one favouring the linear stress-optical rule. 
2.3.2 Formulation of the Theory 
After all considerations of this section and of 
Sect. 2. 1, i t seems justif ied to generalize eq. (2.1. 1 ) , 
in the way A.S. LOdge1 ) did more than twenty years ago (see 
also eq. (1.1.22)): 
t 
(g + P l)t 
= J & (t-t') B (t.t') dt' 
••• (2.3.1) 
This equation expresses a kind of linear superposition principle, 
where a(t-t') is the memory function and ~(t,t') depends on 
the deformation (shear y or extension ratio A) taking place 
between the past time t' and present time t, where ~(t,t) = 1. 
In the case of a fluid the memory must fade, which means 
that a(t-t') must go to zero for an increasing time interval. 
The relationship between a(T) and the well-known relaxation 
modulus in shear 8(T), which occurs in the linear theory of 
visco-elasticity, is simply derived by the application of 
a step shear strain yo at t' = O. This means that, according 
to eq. (2.1.7) B12 is yo at all values of t' ~ 0, but becomes 
zero at t' = O. With the aid of eq. (2.3.1) one obtains: 
o 
u 12(t) = Yo 
J &(t-t') dt' 
(2.3.2) 
193 

From this equation one obtains: 
= 
or 
& (t-t') = 
d a (t-t') 
dt' 
Similarly, one obtains also: 
••• (2.3.2a) 
••• (2.3.3) 
••• (2.3.4) 
Combining eqs. (2.3.2a) and (2.3.4) with eq. (2.1.18) one has: 
(0'1l-?"22)t 
0'12(t) 
= 
••. (2.3.5) 
This means that after a step strain Yo the first normal stress 
difference (011 - 022)t fades away as a function of time in the 
same way as the shear stress, so that the extinction angle 
remains eonstant, being related to the magnitude of the step 
strain Yo 
as indieated by eq. (2.3.5). This may be called 
the Lodge-Meissner criterion21 ) which appears to hold 
not only for Lodge's elastic liquid (ef.eq. 2.1.40), but for 
a class of models to which the latter belongs. By the way, 
several other properties of Lodge's elastic liquid, as de-
seribed in these sections, will turn out to belong to those 
of a wider class of fluids. 
As is well-known, even for ru~ber a va~id expression 
for G, based on molecular parameters, is not yet weil 
established. For polymerie fluids we shall have to rely in 
many cases on an experimental determination of fi , as we 
shall see below. 
194 

2.3.2.1 Application to Several Types of Shear Flow. 
The character of eq. (2.3.1) as a constitutive equa-
tion for a fluid becomes evident, if steady shear flow is 
considered. In this case one has y(t,t') = (t-t')q with 
y = q = const. from t' = -~ up to t' = t. This yields: 
= q ~ d ß(t-t')

+ q f ß(-r) d-r

.•• (2.3.6) 
Since 8(~) = 0, one obtains with 012/q = ns 
the 
following expression for the steady state shear viscosity ns : 
... (2.3.7) 
This result is well-known from the linear theory of 
visco-elasticity. It shows that Lodge's model gives a con-
stant (Newtonian) viscosity. This result is related to the 
neo-Hookean 
behaviour of the ideal rubber, but is in clear 
disaccord with experience. If one recalls that B11 -
B22 = y2, 
one easily verifies that an analogous derivation leads to 
the first normal stress coefficient ~1 ,s 
2 
(°11 - °22)s/q 
which is ,in contrast to experience, also a constant: 
~ 1, S 
• . .(2.3.8) 
2 
The second normal stress coefficient ~2,s = (022 - 033)/q 
is zero for this model, whereas small negative values are found 
in reality (about one tenth of ~1 
). (Cf. Section 1.2.3.7). 
,s 
Non-steady situations can be treated similarly. If, for 
instance, (in a so-called "stressing" experiment) a shear 
flow of constant q is started at t 
= 0, one obtains the 
195 

following conditions for y: 
y(t,t' ) 
{
t 
q 
-
(t-t')q 
for t' < 0 
for t' > 0 
••• (2.3.9) 
For the cessation of steady shear flow at t' 
0 
one has: 
for t' < 0 
y(t,t' ) 
= 
for t' > 0 
..• (2.3.10) 
The pertinent integrations are easily carried out. 
As will be shown in a later section, quantitative agreement 
between theory and experiments on polymer melts can be ob-
tained at sufficiently low rates of shear q over the whole 
time scale. At total deformations y = tq smaller than unity, 
agreement is found with the predictions of this theory even 
if q is in the range where the steady state viscosity ns 
deviates considerably from its Newtonian ("zero-shear") value 
(see Fig. 1.76). Analogous results were also found in 
elongational flow. For the verification of these statements 
one needs 8(T) from another type of measurement*):

will follow in Section 2.3.6. See also Section 1.2.3.1. 
In a similar way one obtains for the build-up of

as it should be according to Boltzmann's superposition 
principle pf linear viscoelasticity. Subscript "s" stands 
for steady. However, no superposition of the first normal 
stress differences is possible: Whereas (011 - 022)rt 
falls off linearly at short times after cessation of flow, 
(011 - 022)bt 
increases quadratically with time in the very 
first beginning (cf. Section 1.1.2). Steady state expressions 
are easily obtained from eqs. (2.3.18) and (2.3.19) for t/Ti 
00. 
There are also interesting interrelations between 
the time-dependences of normal and shear stresses. In the 
relaxation experiment, created by a step shear strain, 
012(t) and (011 - 022)t relax both with 8(t). Other inter-
relations are found by differentiations. 
For the "stressing" experiment (y

Notwithstanding the fact that the model of eq. (2.3.1) 
is only valid in the limit of zero rate of shear, the above rela-
tions are of qualitative value in many respects. Except for the 
case of a single relaxation time, one can derive from eqs. (2.3.18) 
to (2.3.21) that the first normal stress difference has a slower 
build-up and relaxation than the shear stress, when a constant 
rate of shear q is intermittently applied. This is qualitatively 
valid also at higher rates of shear q. With the aid of the 
equation:

which is derived from eqs. (2.1.18), one can easily show that 
the extinction angle starts at 45 degrees with the flow direction, 
when flow is started at constant rate of shear q, and levels 
off at a steady state value smaller than 45 degrees. If flow 
is stopped, the extinction angle does not go back to 45 
degrees, but starts to fall again and shows a tendency to

In fact, it is easier in many cases to determine the 
limiting ~alues for shear and normal stresses with the aid of 
dynamic mechanical measurements. For this purpose, eqs. (2.3.31) 
and (2.3.32) are very useful. The reason for this fact is that, 
201 

in dynamic mechanical measurements on polymerie fluids, one can 
apply relatively high amplitudes of strain without disturbing 
the linear visco-elastic behaviour. This is in accord with the 
findings mentioned in the paragraph behind eqs. (2.3.9) and 
(2.3.10), where it is stated that, in the "stressing" experiment, 
Lodge's equations give realistic results up to total shears 
of about unity. For steady shear "flow the flow birefringence 
measurements can be helpful. The reason lies in the fact that 
the accuracy of birefringence measurements can be improved 
almost without limit. 
As a next step a few words should be said with respect 
to elongational flow. From the consideration of shear flow 
one gets the impression that Lodge's elastic liquid model is 
a basically linear model with some non-linear features in the 
description of normal stresses. As has been indicated in 
Section 1.1.2, however, this vision is not correct. 
2.3.2.2 Application to Elongational Flow. 
In fact, there is some "internal" linearity in the 
model, being based on the use of Gaussian statistics for 
the derivation of the theory of rubber elasticity. The 
same type of linearity manifests itself in the validity 
of the linear stress-optical rule. One peculiarity of the 
so-called Gaussian coils is their infinite extensibility, 
the statistical restoring force between the end-points being 
simply proportional to the end-to-end distance. Whereas in 
shear this infinite extensibility manifests itself in the neo-
Hookean behaviour, the consequences in elongation are quite 
different. As we have seen already in Section 1.1.2, no fi-
nite steady state elongational (or Trouton) viscosity is ob-
tained, when the rate of elongation exceeds the reciprocal 
value of twice the largest relaxation time. In such a case 
the build-up of extensional stress goes to infinity a short 
per iod after the moment, at which elongational flow is 
started. 
202 

An interesting feature of elongational deformation 
is: 
A(t,t') 
= A(t)/A(t'), 
(2.3.33) 
where A(t) is the stretching ratio with respect to the time 
t = 0, where the stretching experiment is started. (In shear 
one has y(t,t') = y(t) - y(t').) 
A look at eq. (2.1.12) teaches us that for a flow 
history: 
A(t,t') 
{
A (t) 
A(t,t') 
for 
t'< 0 
for 
t'> 0 
the tensile stress 011 must read (with 022 = 0):

The first term on the right side of this Cequation

to introduce the Hencky strain measure 
(eq. (1.1.10». 
With this strain measure one has:

For a further evaluation of eq. (2.3.34) we have to 
introduce a restriction: only the case of a constant rate

means that a similar condition holds for all Ti'S. 
204 

In this case one obtains:

A comparison with eq. (2.3.18) shows that, under this condition, 
the tension 011 is built up completely analogously to the shear 
stress except for the fact that the tension is three times 
the shear stress, if the values of q and 
Es are equally chosen.

Another well-known limiting case is, when one has arbi-

flow, respectively, but if one is interested only in the initial 
behaviour of the material at short times.

.•• (2.3.43) 
one can also conclude that the material behaves like an 
elastic solid in the very beginning of the deformation, 
G(O) being derivable, in principle, from the linear visco-
elastic behaviour. Any deviations from linear behaviour become 
obvious only after some time. 
As a rule of thumb one can say that deviations occur 
after a certain total deformation of the order of unity. 
This means that they occur after a rather short time (i.e. 
in the beginning of the development of the stress) for a 
high rate of deformation, but after a rather long time (i.e. 
towards the steady state) for a low rate of deformation. 
2.3.2.3 Problems with Inversion. 
In the foregoing, stresses are calculated for 
given strain histories. The question is, how problems 
should be treated, in which the stress history is given and 
the strain is desired as a function of time. The most impor-
tant experiments concern creep and recovery. For these 
cases eq. (2.3.1) must be inverted, which requires the solu-
tion of the pertinent integral equation. This can only be 
done by numerical methods. However, several statements can 
be made without solving the integral equation. 
206 

As a first point, an evaluation is given for creep 
in shear. In this connection it is interesting to state that 
Lodge's model formally predicts an instantaneous 
compliance 
(at the moment that the shear stress is applied): Shear strain 
y(t) is zero for t 
< 0, makes a jump at t 
= 0 (i.e.y(+O» 
and 
increases monotonously with further increasing time. (Shear 
stress 012 is zero for t 
~ 0 and constant for t 
> 0.) 
This flow 
history is described as folIows: 
t' < 0 
y(t,t') = { y(t) 
for 
y(t) -
y(t') for t' > 0 
•.• (2.3.44) 
For t 
> 0 it folIows: 
o 
t 
(112 (= const.) = J ~(t-t')y(t)dt' + J ~(t-t')[ y(t)-y(t') Jdt~' 
-00 
o 
••• (2.3.45) 
Since y(t) is a factor which can be put in front of the 
integrals, one obtains: 
t 
= y(t) f 
~(-r)dT -
J ~(t-t')y(t')dt' 
.•• (2.3.46) 
o 
o 
The instantaneous compliance is now easily obtained by putting 
t 
= +0. As the second integral vanishes and th: first integral 
becomes equal to 8(0) (see eq. (2.3.2a), one has: 
••• (2.3.47) 
If 8(t) decreases quickly in the beginning, which is 
the case with a relaxation time spectrum showing a very 
large number of short relaxation times, it will happen that 
~(O) is immeasurably small, since 8(0) is much larger than 
G(t) at measurable times. For finite times t the entire integral 
equation (2.3.46) has to be solved by a numerical method, as 
M.H. Wagner and H.M. Laun have shown for a modified mode125 ) • 
207 

However, in shear creep and shear recovery, Boltzmann's linear 
superposition principle is valid for Lodge's model. With the 
aid of this principle ultimate recovery can be calculated 
without inversion of the integral equation as shown in Appendix A. 
In particular one obtains for the equilibrium shear compliance: 
o 
J 
= 
e 
00 
••• (2.3.48) 
For the Lodge model, however, this integral has the 
special meaning expressed in eq. (2.3.8) which is nothing 
else than twice the free energy stored in steady shear flow 
at unity shear rate (Appendix A). With eq. (2.3.8) one obtains: 
o 
J e 
= 
1/I1,s 
2n s 2 
= 
(011- 0 22)s 
2(012)s2 
••• (2.3.49) 
If Yr(t) is the absolute value of the recovery as a function of 
the time which elapses from the moment when the shear stress is 
removed, one obtains with Yr = yr(w) = ~e(012)s and eq. (2.1.18): 
= y (00) = 
r 
••• (2.3.50) 
This is an important result. Onemay notice that Y (w), as 
r 
obtained after steady shear flow (subscript "s") is only one 
half of the recovery of a solid rubber, as expressed by 
eq. (2.1.19), if the orientation angle X of the stress tensor 
is used as a basis for comparison. (According to the linear 
stress-optical rule, Xs 
is the extinction angle of flow 
birefringence in the preceding steady shear flow.) 
At this stage the reader must be reminded, however, 
that a simple shear deformation and recovery can only be 
obtained for Lodge's model, if the lateral dimensions are 
kept constantby constraining forces. In this connection 
one speaks of constrained creep and recovery. This means 
208 

that the primary normal stress difference calculated under 
constrained shear creep and shear recovery conditions is 
of particular interest. For this purpose one first has to 
calculate y(t) and y (t) according to the procedures 
r 
outlined above. In this way, the necessary flow histories 
are obtained. The pertinent normal stresses can then be calcu-
lated according to the principles of Section 2.3.2.1, as has 
been shown by M.H. Wagner and H.M. Laun only for the mentioned 
modified mode125 ) (See Section 2.5.3.3). 
The question may arise about the reason for a delayed 
shear recovery, as there 'is no (internal) shear stress left 
to cause such a further deformation. According to Lodge's 
conception, the delayed recovery proceeds due to the continuous 
release of temporary network junctions. Every time when a 
junction is destroyed by Brownian motion, the system quickly 
shifts to a new equilibrium. It goes without saying that no 
change of junctions is assumed during the instantaneous 
recovery. 
2.3.3 Preliminary Discussion 
At this point the exploitation of the possibilities 
of Lodge's rubberlike liquid model should probably be 
finished. Notwithstanding the fact that we know that this 
model does not give results which are in agreement with 
experiment under all circumstances, we haveto appreciate 
the multiplicity of interesting tests which can be 
suggested on the basis of Lodge's work. 
At the same time, however, we have seen that even this 
simplest possible model for a rubber-like fluid can 
enmesh us in rather tricky mathematical problems so that, 
for practical reasons, we have to look for only a moderate 
modification of this model in order to improve the agreement 
with experiment, all the more as this agreement is found 
to be excellent as long as the total deformation is rather 
small. At larger deformations serious discrepancies between 
209 

the results of Lodge's theory and experiment are evident. They 
are characteristic for the steady state flow situation: 
Instead of being constant, the steady shear viscosity 
and the first normal stress coefficient ~1 
(cf.eqs. (2.3.7) 
,s 
and (2.3.8)) are tremendously shear rate dependent. It 
appears that ns 
sometimes drops two decades when q is 
increased within the usual range. For 
~1 
even more pro-
,s 
nounced decreases up to six decades were found. (See Fig. 1.13). 
In this respect it seems curious to expect that relatively 
slight modifications of the phenomenological theory can influ-
ence results so drastically that the desired agreement with 
experiment is accomplished. Nevertheless, as will be shown 
below, such a simple modification can lead to the desired 
success. There will be even a justification for this modifica-
tion on the basis of a molecular consideration. 
Less serious seems another shortcoming of Lodge's 
equation. According to eq. (2.1.14) the second normal stress 
difference N2 = °22 - °33 should identically be zero for this 
model. In reality, a negative N2 has been found, of the order of 
one tenth of the corresponding N1-value. (See Section 1.2.3.7) 
For manypräcticalpurposes this fact can be disregarded. On the 
other hand, it points to a fundamentally unsolved question. As 
Wales 26 ) has clearly stated, also N2 complies with the linear 
stress-optical rule. As a consequence, it is very probable that 
the occurrence of a finite N2 must be explainable in terms of an 
improved statistical theory. 
In this respect we have the hope that the relatively 
small and negative values of N2 as weIl as the shear rate 
dependencies of 
n 
and 
~1 
can be understood in molecular 
s 
,s. 
< 
18) 
terms with the aid of P.G. De Gennes' "reptati0n" model 
(Qualitatively, the shear rate dependences of nn and ~1,s 
can also be described with the aid of the "n-measure of strain".) 
In the hands of M. Doi and S.F. Edwards 19), and more recently, 
in those of Ch.F. Curtiss and R.B. Bird27 ), the reptation 
model has been developed to such an extent that a useful 
constitutive equation is obtained. Interestingly enough, the 
form of this constitutive equation furnishes the justification 
210 

for the mentioned moderate modification of the phenomenological 
theory. 
In this connection, a 
well-known generalization of 
Lodge's model should be discussed first. As astrain measure 
the Finger tensor ~(t,t') is retained. The generalization is 
tried by the assumption that the memory function is no longer 
a pure function of time (t-t') but also a function of the in-
variants of the Finger tensor (or of the Cauchy tensor, which 
does not make any difference). *) This means that ~(t-t') is 
replaced by ~(t-t'; 1 1 (t,t'); I 2 (t,t')). A dependence on 
1 3 
is not taken into consideration, since 1 3 
is equal 
to unity on account of the constant volume condition. 
A non-linear theory can be created in this way. This model 
is named after A. Kaye28 ) and after B. Bernstein, E.A. Kearsly 
29) 
and L.J. Zapas 
. Unfortunately, this formulation is too 
general for direct application. However, several of the 
equations mentioned lateron, fall within the framework of 
this model. As one can easily see, the Lodge-Meissner crite-
rion holds for the K-BKZ model. (See eqs. (2.3.2a) and 
(2.3.4) .) 
Other authors 30)have proposed to introduce the in-
variants of the rate of strain tensor into the memory function. 
However, whereas the introduction of the invariants of the 
strain measure is unambiguous, since the strain is accumulated 
over the whole time span from the previous time t' to the 
present time t, the question arises whether the invariants of 
the rate of strain tensor have to be introduced for the previous 
time t', for the present time t or whether averages of the said 
invariants over the whole time span between t' and t must be 
used. Two experiences on polymer melts are against the intro-

duction of the rate of strain into the memory function. In a 
"stressing experiment" these materials behave in accordance 
with Lodge's simple model up to total strains of the order of 
unity, irrespective of the applied rate of strain, at least in 
the range of strain rates applied. (See Fig. 1.76). The same 
materials show linear visco-elastic behaviour in dynamic 
oscillatory measurements in a rather wide range of strain 
amplitudes. (This would be quite unusual for non-polymeric 
visco-elastic materials). Also a step strain must influence the 
memory function drastically, i,f there is an influence of the 
rate of strain on this function. 
In fact , the rate of strain 
will temporarily be infinite in such an experiment. As becomes 
obvious in the experimental sectionsof this monograph, none of 
these influences can be discovered. The omission of the invari-
ants of the rate of strain tensor makes things much easier. 
A further drastic simplification in the use of the K-
BKZ-theory was proposed by several authors 31 ). These authors 
tried to obtain useful results after a factorization of the 
memory function, viz.: 
.•. (2.3.51) 
where ~(t-t') is the memory function of the linear visco-
elastic behaviour, as before, whereas h(I 1 , 1 2) is 
a function of the strain only. In the work by H.M. Laun32 ) 
this procedure was clearly underpinned with experimental 
evidence: In a step strain experiment (see eq. (2.3.2» 
the 
"damping function" h(I 1 , 1 2) can be put in front of the 
integral, if eq. (2.3.2) is used. As a matter of fact, it 
appeared that 012(t)/y decreased in magnitude with 
increasing 
step height, but showed the same time dependency, which was 
known from linear visco-elastic experiments. As this approach 
is so successful, it will be treated in separate sections. 
In this respect it seems important to mention that 
Phillips 31) has pointed to the fact that, in the ca se of the 
factorization given by eq. (2.3.51), the "damping function" 
212 

h(I 1 , 1 2 ) can mentally be reckoned to the strain tensor instead 
of to the memory function. This would mean that the strain 
tensor is replaced by a "more general strain measure", an idea 
which is also found in the work of N.W. TSchoeg15 )and 
cooperators on the n-measure of strain. 
This reasoning is supported by the result of the 
molecular theory by M. Doi and S.F. Edwards, from which not 
only a "universal strain tensor" evolves, but also astrain 
(and strain rate) independent memory function. In this way, 
the announced simple modification, which is expressed by 
eq. (2.3.51), is specified and the desired justification is 
given. The Doi-Edwards theory, however, will be described in 
later sections. 
2.3.4 Equivalent Formulations of the Discussed Theory 
As this subject will be treated in more detail in 
Section 2.4.2.3 with the aid of convected coordinates, 
only a summary will be given here. By a partial integration 
of eq. (2.3.1) one obtains an equation first proposed 
by walters 33 ) and by Fredrickson 34 ): 
t 
(g, + P l)t = 2 J 13(t-t') r,-l(t'). ]let'). [b-l(t')) T dt' 
(2.3.52) 
In this equation Q(t') is the matrix of the rate of strain 
tensor in Cartesian coordinates at the past time t'. The 
-1 
-1 T 
< 
inverse deformation gradients ~ 
and 
(~ 
) 
which do not 
explicitly depend on t 
(see sect. (2.4.2), serve as trans-
formation matrices which trans form the components of the rate 
of strain tensor, as given in Cartesian coordinates at t', into 
the components holding for the oblique-angled convected 
coordinate system, as it exists at t'. (Only at t' = t this 
system becomes Cartesian and coincides with the space fixed 
system.) From this interpretation it is seen that eq. (2.3.52) 
represents a quasi-linear theory: What the material experiences 
213 

in its deformed s~ate at time t', it still remembers at 
present time t to an extenuated degree. The measure of 
extenuation is 8{t-t'). For the correctness of the result 
of the mentioned partial integration it is essential that, 
with increasing argument 
~, G{T) goes to zero sufficiently 
fast. Otherwise the material would not be a fluid. As 
R.B. Bird4) has pointed out, this mechanism is more easily 
conceivable for a corotational model, for which the trans-
formation matrix is the orthogonal transformation matrix 
between a fixed and a "corotating" Cartesian coordinate frame. 
This model will be discussed in Section 2.4.1. Here we have a 
codeformational model, as will be 
explained in more detail in 
Section 2.4.2. 
For a continuation of the present discussion the 
relaxation modulus 8{t-t') is needed in its expanded form, 
given by eq. (2.3.11). After the substitution of this ex-
pression into eq. (2.3.52), the r.ight side of this equation 
becomes a sum of separate terms. In accordance with the 
applied principle of superposition, also the left side can 
be considered as a sum of contributions by the separate 
relaxation mechanisms. Since we are interested only in the 
deviatoric components 012' 011 - 022 etc., we can omit the 
term containing the hydrostatic pressure p. In this way 
one obtains for every relaxation time 
T. 
an equation of the 
1 
form: 
t 
= 2 gi f e 
-0> 
t-t' 
Ti 
If this equation is now differentiated with respect to 
the present time, the left side of the equation creates 
difficulties, since the components of the tensor on the 
(2.3.53) 
left side are expressed in the copvected coordinate system 
which is Cartesian only at the very moment t, but not before 
and after this moment. How to cope with this difficulty, 
will be shown in Section 2.4.2. From this section it will 
become obvious that the correct joice of the time derivative 
214 

depends on the joice of the tensors used in the integrals. 
In Lodge's model the Finger tensor ~ occurs in eq. (2.3.1) 
-
-1 
and the inverse deformation gradient ~ 
must occur after 
partial integration. In this case the ordinary differential 
quotient of gi with respect to time t must be replaced by 
the contravariant time derivative ~i(1)' as defined by 
eq. (2.4.44). If the inverse tensors, viz. the Cauchy 
tensor ~ and the corresponding deformation gradient E 
were chosen, the covariant time derivative ~i (1), as ;iven 
by eq. (2.4.39), would be the correct time derivative. This 
doubling of possibilities is due to the fact that there is 
a convected vector basis and a corresponding reciprocal vector 
basis. So far the cornrnents with respect to the correct 
differentiation of the left side of eq. (2.3.53). 
The differentiation of the right side is much easier. 
Two terms evolve: The one, which is formed by the integrand 
at t' = t, gives 2gi~(t), since the deformation gradients 
become unity matrices. The other one, which is the conse-
quence of differentiation of the integrand itself, simply 
becomes equal to -
~i/Ti. In this way for every relaxation 
time Ti a separate linear differential equation 
= 
(2.3.54) 
is obtained. Since gi Ti = ni' where ni 
is a viscosity, it 
is obvious that (2.3.54) is the differential equation for 
a Maxwell model with modulus giand viscosity ni 
(or relaxation 
time Ti ). This equivalence between the (single) integral 
eq. (2.3.1) and the set of differential eqs. (2.3.54) 
has first been shown by Lodge and wu 35 ). This fact is of 
great importance, since several molecular theories for 
dilute solutions result in a set of differential equations 
of this type. There are also modifications of Lodge's theory, 
which start from this set of differential equations. In 
Section 1.1.2 eq. (1.1.16), which is identical with eq. 
(2.3.54), has simply been postulated. 
215 

From a more practical point of view, the set of 
differential equations seems to furnish advantages in 
those cases where the temperature of the system changes 
during flow, as in most polymer processing situations. 
This type problem must often be solved numerically. 
It seems relatively easy to use values of the relaxation 
times Ti changing with temperature. 
2.3.5 Incorporation of Temperature Changes into the Integral Equation 
Finally it should be mentioned, how temperature 
changes which occur during the flow history can be in-
corporated into eq. (2.3.1). For this purpose we observe that 
for the partial integration of this equation the relation 
(2.3.3) is used, in which the differentiation is clearly 
carried out with respect to the integration variable t'. 
If the temperature T becomes time dependent, also 
the relaxation times become time dependent, according to 
the WLF-equation mentioned in Appendix B. In such a case, 
equation (2.3.11) must be modified as follows: 
ß( t-t') =

according to eq. (2.3.3), in order to obtain the memory 
function, Lodge's eq. (2.3.1) becomes:

This equation is due to M.Matsui and D.C. Bogue36 ). It has been 
216 

used, after a modification for non linear behaviour*) , for the 
interpretation of non-isothermal tensile tests and corres-
ponding flow birefringence measurements. For these measure-
ments the assumption is made (which is in accordance with 
the basic ideas underlying the WLF-equation) that the stress-
optical coefficient changes with temperature without time lag, 
so that the temperature dependence of the stress-optical 
coefficient can be determined with the aid of separate iso-
thermal experiments, as carried out at several temperatures. 
The assumption of zero time lag will be valid, if the range 
of temperature of interest is well above the glass transition 
temperature. (See section 1.2.3.1.) 
2.3.6 Optical Means to Prove the Validity of the Simple Rubberlike 
Liquid Theory 
As a matter of fact, Lodge and Meissner 38 ) were the first 
to show that Lodge's rubberlike liquid theory gave realistic 
results for the elongational stressing of a low density poly-
ethylene, as characterized in Section 1.1.4.1, up to Hencky 
strains of the order of three, i.e. well beyond the linear 
range. Later experiments by Bogue and cooperators39 ) were of a

modified relaxation times:

(2.3.57) 
In this equation D21/ 2 
is the average of the root of 
the second invariant of the rate of strain tensor ~ over 
the time intervals occurring in eq. (2.3.56) and b is 
an adjustable numerical factor of the order 0,5. Because of 
this averaging the model is more akin to those containing 
the invariants of the strain tensor. The shift factor a T 
(according to the WLF-equation) is considered here as a 
function of time like the relaxation times Ti' due to the 
time dependence of temperature. 
217 

similar nature. The reason for our special interest for the 
latter experiments lies in the fact that they also comprise 
birefringence measurements. An additional feature of interest 
is their extension to non-isothermal cases. In a first round, 
areport on these measurements was given in Section 1.2.3.1. 
In this section also the relevant figures are given, so that the 
present discussion can be rather short. The reported experiments 
were carried out on a technical polystyrene (Shell TC-3-30, 
5 
Mw = 2,83.10 , Mw/Mn = 4,6) for which an approximate line 
spectrum of relaxation times was determined in the usual way 
(see Appendix A). The temperature insensitive stress-optical 
coefficient of the polymer was determined in the way described 
in Section 1.2.3.1. The full lines through the open symbols 
of Figs. 1.36 and 1.37 are curves calculated according to the 
equations produced by Lodge's theory for the respective iso-
thermal cases. (The temperatures are indicated in the figures.) 
Nice agreement between experiments and theory is found for 
the measured birefringences as weIl as the measured tensile 
stresses. The same also holds for the non-isothermal runs. 
The pertinent calculations were carried out with the aid of 
eq. (2.3.56). (No modification of the relaxation times with 
respect to the second invariant of the rate of strain tensor, 
as indicated by eq. (2.3.57), was carried out.) The total strains 
applied, however, did not exceed E = 1 very much. As will be 
discussed later in this monograph, Lodge's model must be modi-
fied in order to describe the behaviour ofpolymer melts at 
higher total extensions. 
A second type of experiment, which is useful for a 
test of the validity of Lodge's model, has recently been in-
troduced by Vinogradov and coworkers 22 ). Also on these measu-
rements a partial report has been given in Sec'tion 1.2.3.1, 
where most of the relevant figures are reproduced. However, as 
the theoretical description of these cyclic measurements is 
rather complicated, more space must be reserved in the present 
section for an adequate discussion. In this connection attention 
must first be focussed on Fig. 1.44. When discussing this fi-
gure the authors speak of a sine wave of amplitude 
ßn 
super-
o 
imposed on a constant birefringence fin • 
c 
218 

Probably, the accuracy of this formulation can be 
improved a little. In fact, by adding the squares of the eqs. 
(2.1.16) and (2.1.17) one obtains for the principal stress 
difference in the 1,2-plane: 
/).(J = 
••• (2.3.58) 
(The maximum shear stress T 
in the notation of the mentioned 
max 
authors is equal to 
to/2.) With the aid of the linear stress-
optical rule one obtains: 
/).n = C 
••• (2.3.59) 
According to eqs. (2.3.14) and (2.3.16), the squares of the shear 
stress and of the first normal stress difference are periodic 
functions of time. The function 
••• (2.3.60) 
with tan 0 = GI! ( W ) /G ' ( w) is purely sinusoidal, always positive 
and becomes periodically zero at the values 0, n, 2n ••• of the 
argument 
wt + o. The function 011 - 022 possesses the same 
basic periodicity, corresponding to 2 wt, but contains a higher 
harmonic of circular frequency 4 wt. It is always positive but 
never becomes zero, due to the constant term G' (w ) in 
eqs. (2.3.16). At the moment that the shear stress passes 
through zero, one obtains from eq. (2.3.59): 
.•• (2.3.61) 
where the subscript X = 0 points to the fact that, at this 
moment, the extinction angle is zero. In fact, this angle is 
defined by eq. (2.1.18). Since the amplitude of 012 is in 
general, as can easily be proved with relations of Section 
2.3.2.1, much bigger than the sum formed by the constant contri-
219 

bution to 011 - 022 and by the amplitude of the oscillatory 
part of 011 - 022' most of the time the extinction angle X is 
close to 
+ n/4 or - n/4, dependent on whether 012 is in the 
positive or in the negative part of its cycle. Only during 
very short time spans in the neighbourhoods of the zero points 
0, n, 2n, ••• of 012 the extinction angle passes through zero on 
its way from + n/4 to - n/4 and otherwise round. 
As in the experimental technique applied by Vinogradov 
et al. only the absolute value of f> n is measured (by the use 
of circular polarized light), the periodic continuation of the 
curve 
given in Fig. 1.44 will resemble a curve given by an 
analytical expression containing the absolute value of the sine: 
f>n = f>n 
+ f>n 
Isin(wt +8)[

.•. (2.3.62) 
rather than the sine itself. 
Near the sharp minima of this curve, however, some rounding off 
should be expected. Since at the point, where 012 becomes zero, 
one has: 
wt 
= -
8 
(2.3.63) 
one can rather easily calculate 
ön x= O. In fact, for the 
corresponding value of the first normal stress difference 
one finds with eqs. (2.3.63) and (2.3.16): 
sin (8'+28)} 
.•• (2.3.64) 
with tan 6' according to eq. (2.3.17), or: 
+ 
( %G " ( 2 w ) - G " ( w )) 2 G ' ( w) G " ( w ) ] } 
.•• (2.3.65) 
Only if in the curly brackets of eqs. (2.3.64) and (2.3.65) the 
220 

second term is negligible compared with the first one, 
~nx = 0 
corresponds to the minimum value of 
~n in Fig. 1.44. However, 
since the second term in eq. (2.3.16) is oscillatory, the 
minimum of 
~n must, in principle, be lower than 
~n x= O. 
Also the moment, when this minimum accours, will not 
exactly coincide with that of the passage of 012 through zero. 
Nevertheless, Vinogradov and coworkers found that the 
optically measured 5(W ~n in their notation) nicely corresponded 
with the 5 belonging to the shear stress (Wo in their notation). 
This is shown in Fig. 1.45 and has been considered as a proof 
for the validity of the linear stress-optical rule. In fact, 
the systematic error made in the optical measurement of 5 must 
be extremely small, since the location on the time scale of 
the minimum in 
~n must be very close to the moment, when 012 
is zero. This is because of the large amplitude of 012 compared 
with the values of the first normal stress difference. 
An exact calculation of the minimum value of 
~n, however, 
seems a more difficult task, as the curvature of the line giving 
~n as a function of wt is very high in the vicinity of the 
minima. As a consequence, a development of this function into a 
power series, e.g. at wt = - 5, does not lead to a useful result. 
Numerical calculation seems the only remedy. If this reasoning 
is true, however, one can no ion ger expect that the minimum 
2 
value of 
~n is simply proportional to Yo . In fact, at a 
value of 
wt slightly deviating from -
5 also the first term 
under the root of eq. (2.3.58) is of influence. Whereas 
(011 ; 022)2 is proportional to Y04, 4 °12 2 is only proportional 
to Yo • So one can expect a 
dependence of the minimum value of 
~n on Yo which is not exactly quadratic, even in the range of 
Yo < 1, where Lodge's model seems to 'be valid. In ,fact, what 
the mentioned authors found experimentally, is shown in Fig. 2.3. 
Interestingly enough, at low values of Y02 G' 
the quadratic 
dependency is nearly obtained for the investigated polybutadienes 
and polyisoprenes. However, one should observe that the points 
for the lowest values of Y02 G' 
are obtained by mechanical 
measurements on solutions of pOlystyrene, so that 
(011 - 022)c = Y02 G' (w) is directly measured in a rheogonio-

meter. These latter points were taken from the literature 
(H. Endo and M. Nagasawa41 )). It should also be mentioned that the 
shear amplitudes Yo were extended up to the order of five, 
where Lodge's model is certainly not valid. 
Finally, results should be quoted in this section, 
as obtained by the cooperators of the present author42 ). The 
pertinent measurements were carried out in intermittent shear 
flow of a polystyrene melt, partly at extremely low shear 
rates. For the purpose, an optically very clear polystyrene 
(Laqrene 1531, M = 53 000, M = 220 000, Mz = 520000) was 
n 
w 
used in order to enable measurements of extremely low bire-
fringence effects. Part of the measurements, viz. those at 
extremely low shear rates, were carried out in the coaxial 
cylinder unit described in Section 1.2.2.2 (Fig. 1.33). The 
remainder of the measurements was carried out in the cone-
222 

and-plate type unit. For the measurements of birefringence 
and extinction angle a special modulation was applied to the 
birefringence, by which the accuracy of the measurements was 
tremendously increased. This method is described in Appendix C. 
Dynamic mechanical measurements were carried out on the polymer 
in order to obtain G' (w ) and G" ( w) in a wide range of circular 
frequencies. 
These data were used to calculate shear stress and 
first normal stress difference build-up (in stressing experi-
ments) and relaxation (after steady shear flow), according to 
Lodge's theory. For the purpose the following equations were 
used:

have been derived in terms of the dynamic moduli G'(w) and 
G"(w). These expressions are given by eqs. (A.89) and (A.90) of 
the mentioned appendix. In addition we need the equations:

From an inspection of these equations one learns that eqs. 
(A.89) and (A.90) suffice to calculate all wanted quanti-
ties. In order to translate the transient birefringences 
and extinction angles into the pertinent shear stresses and 
first normal stress differences, eqs. (1.2.4) and (1.2.5) were 
used. Also the inverse transformation was carried out on 
the calculated values of the stresses in order to predict the 
transient characteristics of the birefringence. A stress opti-
cal coefficient C = -
4,23.10-9m2 /N, as indicated in Table 1.6, 
was used in these calculations, as obtained by a comparison 
of steady state values of (lln sin 
2 X) /2q with non-Newtonian 
steady state viscosities derived from the rule of Cox and Merz 
(see eq. 1.1.39). All flow birefringence measurements were 
carried out at 1530 C. 
Interesting extinction angle curves are shown in 
Figs. 2.4 and 2.5. In the first of these figures one 
observes that at the two lowest shear rates of 1,34.10-3s- 1 and 
-3 -1 
2,53.10 
s 
the experimental curves pretty weIl coincide with 
the curves calculated on the basis of the dynamic moduli. For 
higher shear rates one finds that the coincidence is good for 
total shears smaller than unity. The experimental steady state 
values of the extinction angles, however, are reached earlier 
than predicted on the basis of Lodge's model and have higher 
values. This is in accordance with the findings reproduced in 
Fig. 1.76 for another polystyrene melt. When flow is stopped, 
extinction angles are predicted to start decreasing further, 
as shown in Fig. 2.2. This is also found in the present case. 
Unfortunately, predictions from eqs. (2.3.70) and (2.3.71), 
as obtained by combining these equations according to eq. 
(2.3.29) are rather inaccurate due to the inaccuracy of the

(2.3.29) (cot 2 Xr becominq rather 
hand, measurements of the optical 
quantities are very accurate during relaxation (no noise by the

that the values of (cot 2x)/q are independent of q as long as 
Lodge's model holds. This is just what is found also in the 
present Fig. 2.5 for the two lowest (preceding) shear rates. 
In fact, the extinction angles for the two lowest rates of 
shear were found to agree with those calculated from the 
dynamic moduli also in the preceding steady state (see previous

the higher shear rates this was no longer the case.

the mentioned quantities is found for shear rates up to

behaviour of the polymer melt in the indicated range of shear 
rates, but not necessarily the validity of Lodge's model, as 
will be shown in a moment. At higher shear rates drastic 
deviations from the linear behaviour are found, as indicated by

According to the view of the present author the just 
reported results form the most sensitive test for the validity 
of Lodge's rubberlike liquid model. They are obtained within 
the realm of strictly linear viscoelasticity as far as the 
shear stress is concerned, and show that the Finger tensor 
forms the correct choice of astrain tensor to begin with, 
be fore modifications are introduced in order to cope with 
various well-known deviations. 
2.4 More General Discussion of Quasi-Linear Models 
2.4.1 The Corotational Model 
Following the suggestion by Bird4 ), the quasi-linear coro-
tational model is discussed first. When Lodge's equation, as 
obtained after partial integration, was discussed briefly in 
Section 2.3.4, the didactic advantage of the corresponding 
corotational model was already mentioned. The model is described 
by the following matrix equation: 
t 
Cg, + P 1\ = 2 J aCt-t') a Ct,t').D(t')·aT(t,t')dt' 
(2.4.1) 
where a is an orthogonal transformation matrix between two 
Cartesian coordinate systems. By this matrix, the components 
of the ra~e of strain tensor ~(t'), as given in the space fixed 
Cartesian frame at t', are transformed into a tilted Cartesian 
frame, which rotates with the angular component of the fluid 
velocity. This latter Cartesian frame is chosen in such a way 
that it just coincides with the space fixed frame, when past 
time t' reaches the present time t. If an elongational flow is 
applied to the fluid, the "corotating" frame remains the same 
as the reference frame. On the other hand, with simple shear 
229 

flow the angular component of the velocity is pronounced. In 
this case the corotating frame is chosen in such a way that its 
unit vector ~3 coincides with the unit vector ~3 of the space 
fixed frame. These vectors form the axis of rotation of the 
corotating frame. In the space fixed frame, with ~1 
being the 
flow direction and ~2 being the normal to the shearing surfaces, 
the angular velocity vector 
w 
= 
~ [V x ~] 
... (2.4.2) 
becomes 
1 -
w 
= 
2" y ~3 
(2.4.3) 
since the velocity of the fluid is: 
v 
= 
(2.4.4) 
From eq. (2.4.3) it follows that the corotating frame rotates 
clock-wise with an angular velocity Y/2. The angle a(t,t'), 
by which the corotating frame is tilted at time t' counter 
clock-wise with respect to the fixed frame, is given by: 
a(t,t') 
1 t 
= 2 f 
y(t")dt" 
t ' 
For the steady shear flow one simply has (with y 
q 
a(t,t') = (q/2) (t-t') 
From these equations the transformation matrix jl,(t,t') 
easily derived. It reads: 
(co, a(t,t'), 
sin a(t,t'),

(2.4.8) 
With the aid of eqs. (2.4.1), (2.4.5) and (2.4.8) it is rather 
easy to calculate predictions of this model for several (shear) 
flow situations. As a matter of fact, this model gives answers 
quite different from those of Lodge's model. A realistic non-
Newtonian shear viscosity ns as well as acceptable shear rate 
dependent first and second normal stress differences are ob-
tained for steady shear flow. A molecular interpretation, how-
ever, cannot easily be given for this model. The difficulties 
arising from this aspect are also underlined by the spurious 
oscillations which are obtained, when stress build-up after 
a step in the rate of shear is calculated for ,sufficiently 
high rates of shear. In fact, eq. (2.4.1) can only be expected 
to give realistic results as long as, at constant shear rate, 
the time of one revolution of the volume element (i.e. 4n/q) 
is large compared with the largest relaxation time of the 
material. Otherwise, periodicities in the behaviQur can be 
expected during the adaptation, be fore the steady state is 
established. This condition of a sufficiently large time of 
revolution is necessary since, in reality, a volume element 
does not freely rotate. So the model must get the chance to 
"forget" this artefact. The codeformational models do not show 
up this difficulty. 
:) 
231 

For formal reasons, however, it is interesting to show 
that a proper differentiation with respect to time of eq. 
(2.4.1) also leads to a set of linear differential equations, 
equivalent to the integral equation. For the purpose, however, 
we have to find out the proper time derivative first. If we 
consider a time t o ' just a little earlier than the present time 
t, as an upper bound of the integral, the corotating frame is 
not yet coinciding with the space fixed frame. This means that, 
since the components of the stress tensor on the left side are 
given in this frame, these components must be expressed in 
terms of those in the space fixed frame ~(to)' One obtains in 
matrix notation the following transformation: 
(2.4.9) 
By differentiation one obtains:

The differential quotient of the transformation matrix with 
respect to time t o can easily be obtained. Since a is an 
orthogonal transformation matrix, its transpose is equal to 
its inverse. This means: 
= 
(2.4.11) 
For the differentiation with respect to time t 
a dot is used 
o 
he re for simplicity. If eq. (2.4.11) is differentiated in this 
232 

way, one obtains: 
... (2.4.12) 
From a comparison of the second and fourth part of this 
equation one learns that the newly defined matrix i is 
antisymmetric. This means that ~ has the general form: 
0 
w 3 
(;;;-i j ) = 
0 
0 
w2 
-w 1 
... (2.4.13) 
The components are inserted in such a way that they are indenti-
cal with the components of the angular velocity vector, as de-
fined by eq. (2.4.2). In fact, it can easily be verified that 
for an arbitrary position vector ~ one obtains: 
•.. (2.4.14) 
Multiplying eq. (2.4.12) at the left side by ~ one has: 
(2.4.15) 
Multiplying the same equation at the right side by _~T one 
obtains:

These are the differential equations needed in the expression 
for the time derivative of the stress tensor. In,addition one 
needs the "initial" condition: 
••• (2.4.17) 
233 

Inserting eqs. (2.4.15), (2.4.16) and (2.4.17) into 
eq. (2.4.10) one obtains for t o = t:

The differentiation procedure which must be applied to the 
matrix g of the tensor components in the space fixed coordinate 
system is called the Jaumann derivative and is symbolized by 
a round capital D. 
If now in eq. (2.4.1) the relaxation modulus 8 in shear 
is replaced by eq. (2.3.11), one can express the total shear 
stress as a sum of shear stresses gi belonging to the separate 
relaxation processes characterized by their relaxation times Ti'

Footnote: In n(t,t') the use of the symbol t is a little 
misleading. In this notation t is only an indication for the 
space fixed Cartesian coordinate system. The orthogonal ma-
trix ß,(t,t') performs a transformation of the components of 
the rate of strain tensor at time t', as given in the space 
fixed system, into the corotating system in its position 
at time t'. As a consequence, bl,(t,t') and aT (t,t') are not 
touched by the differentiation with respect to t o ' Only in 
the exponential and in the upper 
bound of the integral t has 
to be replaced temporarily by t o • 

Here the last term is just -gi/Ti. A simple rearrangement 
leads to the predicted result: 
••• (2.4.20) 
These are the analogous equations to eqs. (2.3.54). 
Since the equation for the corotational model cannot 
be given in the form equivalent to eq. (2.3.1) of Lodge's 
model, it is a little more difficult to calculate the equations 
for the relaxation experiment (see eq. (2.3.2)). This experiment, 
however, plays a central role in the selection of useful con-
stitutive equations. For the purpose, the following flow history 
is formulated: 
r 
0 
for 
_00 < t' < 0 
y( t' ) = 
q (=const.) for 
0 
< t' < 
I:J. 
0 
for 
I:J. 
< t' < t 
... (2.4.21) 
-
The time interval I:J. is assumed to go to zero, whereas the shear 
rate q 
goes to infinity, so that the product qI:J. = Yo remains 
finite, Yo being the step in shear at time t 
= O. With the 
aid of the eqs. (2.4.1), (2.4.5a), (2.4.8) and (2.4.21) one 
obtains for the (relaxing) shear stress and first normal stress 
difference (the second being minus one half of the first): 
I:J. 
0"12(t) = 
q J G(t-t' ) [ cos q(I:J.-t')]dt' 
0

I:J. 
(0"1l-0"22)t = 2q 
J G(t-t')[ sin q(I:J.-t')] dt' 
0 
(2.4.23) 
In the integrands G(t-t') is bounded as follows: 
G(t) < G(t-t') < G(t-I:J.) 
••• (2.4.24) 
Since I:J. is made infinitesimal, the relaxation modulus will 
not change noticeably within the time interval I:J. and can be 
235 

put in front of the integrals as a factor G(t). The remaining 
integrals are easily solved. One obtains: 
= 
G(t) sin Yo 
..• (2.4.25) 
..• (2.4.26) 
From eq. (2.4.25) it may be deduced that the model 
becomes unstable at Yo ~ n/2 = ',57. At very small values of Yo 
the results of eqs. (2.4.25) and (2.4.26) coincide with those 
obtained with the aid of Lodge's model.

. .• (2.4.27) 
Obviously, the Lodge-Meissner criterion does not hold 
for this model. In particular, it should be noted that the 
ratio of N, (t) and 0'2(t) is predicted to go to infinity for 
Yo + n which seems unacceptable from a physical point of view. 
2.4.2 Codeformational Models 
2.4.2.' 
Introduction. 
.--' 
The position of a material point is described by a 
vector ~. The components of this vector may be'given in two 
arbitrary, non-orthonormal bases. The following relations are 
given between the contravariant components of the said vector:

..• (2.4.28) 
From these equations the following expressions are derived for 
236 

the interrelations of their differentials: 
.-i 
c.x 
= 
dxj and dx i 
(2.4.29) 
In these expressions the usual summation on repeated indices is 
applied. The differential of an arbitrary vector can be described 
in both bases: 
dr = g. dx i = 
-L 
-~ 
~~ dx 
(2.4.30) 
where the ~i are the base vectors of the one, and ~i the 
respective base vectors of the other system (i = 1,2,3). 
From eq. (2.4.30) and a similar second equation one can derive 
the transformation rules for the base vectors: 
-~

The (covariant) components of the corresponding metric tensors 
are transformed according to the following relation: 
= 
••• (2.4.32) 
As is well-known, the contravariant components of the 
metric tensor g~J are defined by the reciprocal bases ~i and ~i, 
respectively (gij= ~i. ~j). Since we do not need the correspon-
ding covariant components x. 
and x. of the position vector in 
~ 
~ 
that which follows, we have to derive the transformation rules 
of the reciprocal base vectors also in terms of the contravari-
i 
-i 
ant components x 
and x • In fact, we intend to use the contra-
variant components xi as time independent labels for the 
material points in a convected base ~.(t'), which becomes 
~ 
237 

orthonormal at the "present" time t of observation. The compo-
nents ii(t') will be used as functions of past time t' in a 
space fixed orthonormal coordinate system 9: .. At the "present"

time both bases will coincide and i 1 (t') will be identical with 
xi at that moment. The covariant components x., however, cannot 
1 
be used as time independent labels. As can easily be shown, 
they are functions of past time t'. 
This means that eq. (2.4.30) cannot be used as a blue 
print for the derivation of the requested transformation rules 
of gij according to d ~ = ~i d xi etc. 
With the definition of the reciprocal base by

bases in terms of the contravariant components xi and xi:

Observing that 9

transformation rule of the contravariant components of the 
metric tensor:

indicated in this equation. At this stage, however, we still

deferred the replacement of 9 
by ö 
• This will be done 
at a more convenient moment. Finally, the transformation rule 
238 

of the contravariant components of a second order tensor, like 
the stress tensor, will be recalled in order to show that the 
contravariant components of the metric tensor are transformed 
in the same way. One has:

Covariant and Contravariant Time Derivatives.

of some simple expressions, which can better be calculated 
in advance: 
d

d

dXt 
(2.4.40) 
It is a little more difficult to calculate the derivative 
of the corresponding expression in which the time dependent 
differential is in the denominator. To start this calculation 
we use the identity: 
= 
d XS ( t ' ) 
(2.4.41) 
239 

By differentiation one obtains with the aid of eq. (2.4.40): 
If this relation is multiplied by öR, 
b

sides, it follows:

symbolic notation:

with 
(2.4.47) 
For the moment we can only observe from eq. (2.4.45) 
that the (substantial) time derivative auij(t')/ot ' of the ten-
sor components in the convected coordinate system consists of 
two contributions. One is derived from the change of the 
coordinate system, comprising the two terms containing the 
vector gradient of the velocity, whereas the third term is due to 
change of the tensor components in the fixed coordinatesystem. 
In the more general case of an inhomogeneous defo'rmation (wh ich 
is not treated here), this latter term must itself be a 
substantial derivative in the usual sense. This is the reason 
why in eq. (2.4.46) the round symbols are replaced by capital 
letters D. 
In connection with Lodge's equation the contravariant 
time derivative is of 
much greater importance. In fact, the 
241 

Finger tensor occurring in the kernel of this equation, as 
defined by eq. (2.1.5), 
is easily shown to be identical with 
the contravariant metric tensor (see eq. (2.4.36) with 
g ~m = 6~m). In order to derive the contravariant deri-
vative of a second order tensor, we start from:

As a next step the time derivatives cf the components 
of the metric tensor are introduceq. Since the metric tensor 
degenerates to the (time independent) unity tensor in the space 
fixed orthonormal basis, the covariant and contravariant time 
derivatives of the components of the metric tensor are simpler 
than those of an arbitrary tensor.

Finally, at the end of this section, it should be 
mentioned that some authors prefer to write eqs. (2.4.40) and 
(2.4.42) in symbolic tensor notation. With reference to eq.

To the present author, however, it seems that these

2.4.2.3 
Equations Equivalent to Lodge's Original Formulation. 
In contravariant tensor components, Lodge's eq. 
(2 • 3 • 1) reads: 
Introducing eq. (2.4.36) (with ö~m = g~m) one has:

The lower bound of the first term on the right side vanishes 
because of G(~) = 0 (liquid with fading memory). The upper

As at time t also the convected basis is orthonormal.

.•• (2.4.61) 
It is now obvious that eqs. (2.4.60) and (2.4.61) 
represent a quasi-linear model, in which the rate of strain 
tensor, as given in Cartesian coordinates at time t', is trans-
formed into its convected components at that time. As in the 
corotational model, these latter components represent the action 
of the flow on the material at that time. The memory of what 
happened at that time, and what is still not completely whiped 
o 
out at the present time t, is given by G(t-t'). The model is 
quasi-linear, as the relaxation modulus of the linear behaviour 
is used, whereas the results of the calculations are non-linear 
in several respects, already mentioned in Chapter 2.3. and ear-
lier. In order to transform the integral equation (2.4.60) into 
(a set of) differential equations, two further steps are re-
quired. The first one is of a practical nature. Instead of the 
general expression for the relaxation modulus its expansion 
in terms of exponentials, as introduced by eq. (2.3.11), is 
used. In avoiding a confusion with subscripts of tensor or 
vector components, a Greek letter a is used for the summation 
index. 
The second step is of a more fundamental nature. In 
order to carry out a differentiation with respect to the 
present time t on the left side of eq. (2.4.60), this equation 
must first be formulated for a time t + t, at which the con-
o 
. 
vected basis is not orthonormal. The right side of eq. (2.4.60) 
is not explicitely affected by this procedure. Remembering 
eqs. (2.4.36) and (2.4.39) one arrives at: 
••• (2.4.62) 
245 

In avoiding the necessity to formulate a differential equation 
for the hydrostatic pressure p(to )' only deviatoric components 
of the stress tensor (i.e. 0 12 or 011 -
0 22 ) will be considered. 
For this purpose we can omit the pressure term. Further we can 
split the deviatoric tensor components into separate contribu-
tions of the assumed relaxation mechanisms, i.e.: 
= 
(2.4.63) 
Finally, the subscript a is also omitted, since otherwise the 
obtained relations will be overcrowded with subscripts and 
superscripts. In this way we obtain instead of eq. (2.4.62) 
for a single relaxation mechanism with eq. (2.4.54) and with 
and

If the contravariant derivative cr~~) is replaced by anormal 
time derivative, eq. (2.4.67) is easily recognized as the 
differential equation of a single Maxwell element of relaxation 
time T. The conclusion is that Lodge's (single) integral con-
stitutive equation (2.3.1) is equivalent to a set of parallel 
Maxwell elements with relaxation times T 
and moduli g , if the 
u 
u 
contravariant time derivative is used for the tensor components 
of gu. It goes without saying that the application of the 
covariant time derivative or of the corotational Jaumann 
derivative would lead to quite different (permitted) models. 
The exercise of constructing permitted fluid models has been 
performed in extenso in several textbooks and monographs 4 ) . 
Covariant time derivatives applied to Maxwell elements, would 
lead (in an inverse procedure) to a single integral constitutive 
equation, in which the Finger tensor is replaced by the Cauchy 
tensor (see eq. 2.1.4). However, such a constitutive equation 
is unable to describe the flow properties of polymerie fluids. 
The derivations of this section form a supplement to Section 
2.3.4. At the same time they will be needed in the derivations 
of more advanced quasi-linear theories in later sections.

The integration has to be carried out over the whole

(fixed) coordinate system. The unit vectors ~(t') are 
assumed to be equally distributed over all directions in 
space at time t'. The numerator of the integrand is the 
dyade 
of the vector: 
••• (2.4.70) 
As one easily recognizes, the denominator of the integrand 
is the square of ~(t): The integrand as a whole forms the 
dyade ~(t) ~(t) of a unit vector ~(t) which is derived from 
the unit vector u(t') as a result of the rotation involved 
in the deformati~n ~-1 (t,t'). One can also characterize the 
unit vector ~(t) as the representative of an infinitely thin 
and slippery rod at present time t, which has an arbitrary 
direction at the previous time t'. This rod is thought to 
be embedded in a structurless matrix which follows the 
macroscopic deformation affinely. It appears that the tensor 
Q is, except for the numerical factor, nothing else than 
the average of the dyade ~(t) ~(t) over the orfentational 
distribution at present time t, as created by the sketched

2.4.3.2 Some Physical Considerations. 
At the present stage of the development one is rem in-
ded of an interesting result, as obtained by R.B. Bird and 
cooperators 17 ) 30). According to these authors the relaxing 
stresses in a dilute suspension of rigid dumbbells (i.e. after 
cessation of macroscopic flow or deformation) are described 
by the following equation: 
g + p ~ = 3 n k T 
<~~) (t) 
•.• (2.4.72) 
where n is the number of dumbbells per unit of volume. The 
(relaxing) distribution function, over which the indicated 
averaging has to be carried out, is determined by the type 
of the preceding deformation and by the details of the model, 
such as the length of the dumb-bells and the maqnitude 
of the friction factor of the beads at the ends of the 
dumbbells. In a more complete version eq. (2.4.72) has 
already been discussed in the section on the stress-optical 
relation, since the refractive index tensor obey& an ana-
logous equation in <~~) (t). This shape of the equation 
fits very well in our concept, according to which only models 
exhibiting the linear stress-optical relation are to be con-

sidered in the context of this monograph. In the ca se of the 
independent alignment model the di"stribution of orientations 
is the consequence of the special - frictionless - alignment 
sketched in the previous section. The assumed absence of 
internal friction should not bother ustoo much. Also in the 
temporary network model (as in the theory of rubber elasticity) 
internal friction is disregarded: Relaxation of stresses is 
entirely ascribed to the continuous loss of junctions. 
A comparison of eqs. (2.4.71) and (2.4.72) shows that 
one should actually write: 
Q 
= 
( 5 / 3) 3 <~~) (t) 
••• (2.4.71a) 
The factor nkT of eq. (2.4.72) is absorbed in the memory 
function, as in Lodge's equations. The correction factor 
(5/3) should probably not be taken too seriously. In fact, 
as will be discussed in the part on the molecular theory, 
eq. (2.4.69) is the consequence of a simplification in the 
averaging procedure. In other words, the independent align-
ment model is an approximation to a physically more plausible 
model. 
Notwithstanding the fact that a detailed description 
of the model considerations by Doi and Edwards cannot be 
given in this chapter because of their lengthiness, a verbal 
formulation of one principal difference between the (tem-
porary) network model and the above (approximate) indepen-
dent alignment model will be tried here. In both models the 
stress is due to the orientation of chain segments (say 
random links). The difference seems to be the distribu-
tion function for the orientation of these links. In the 
case of Kuhn's network model this distribution function is 
determind by the postulate that the end points of the 
chains (i.e. the network junctions) move affinely with the 
macroscopic deformation. This affine movement of 
junct"ions 
leads - at a certain deformation - to a higher degree of 
orientation of the links than the independent alignment of 
250 

these links. The mechanism of disorientation, which is 
certainly very different in these models, is reflected in 
both cases by the linear memory function U(t-t'). Since this 
memory function is not given in the theory of temporary networks, 
whereas additional uncertainties are introduced in the deri-
vation of the memory function of Doi and Edwards, one may ima-
gine for the present purpose that the memory function (of a 
certain polymer melt) is determined experimentally (by dynamic 
oscillatory measurements or by stress relaxation after a suffi-
ciently small step in shear). If now the same memory function 
is used in both models (eqs. (2.3.1) and (2.4.68», the temporary 
network theory predicts the upper, the independent alignment 
model apparently the lower limit of the expected stresses 43 ) . 
This conclusion may follow from a consideration of 
the conception which has led Doi and Edwards to the con-
viction that the independent alignment of links can be, 
under certain circumstances, a good approximation to the 
actual alignment of interconnected chain links. In fact, 
the quoted theory - based on ideas put forward by De C~nnes18)­
forms an ingenious single chain approximation for a concen-
trated system. The basic idea is that an individual chain 
molecule 
can move rat her easily along its own (curved) 
path through the concentrated system ("reptation", wriggling 
motion). In contrast to this high longitudinal mobility, the 
lateral mobility is, except for rather local movements, 
virtually zero. By the Brownian motion of the chain parts, 
a relatively fast equilibration process takes place in the 
longitudinal direction, by which the chain end-points are 
continuously retracted during macroscopic deformation. As 
a consequence, the average coil extension will (in reality) 
be much less than predicted by the network theory. The 
experienced large relaxation times of such a system are 
not ascribed to high life times of individual entanglements 
or junctions, but to the large times which the considered 
chain molecule needs to escape more or less completely 
from its affinely stretched and bent effective "tube". This 
tube is formed by the "underwood" of the neighbouring molecu-
les. The mentioned escape must be accomplished by longitudinal 
251 

diffusion of the whole chain over a considerable distance. 
This distance is given by the contour length of the 
"primitive chain", being the length of the middle line of 
the "tube" - after equilibration in longitudinal direction. 
(The tube dies where the chain moleeule has left it by 
retraction or longitudinal diffusion and is newly created 
where the chain arrives by diffusion.) In this process only 
the chain ends, diffusing out of the original tube, can 
choose new arbitrary directions. As a resultof the 
continuous longitudinal equilibration the contour length 
of the "primitive chain" is not affected by the macroscopic 
deformation (as long as its rate is not too high!). As a conse-
quence, also the path length for escape is not changed. 
This 
forms the basis for the quasi-linear character of the theory: 
the escape times are not influenced by the deformation. The 
memory function remains independent ofthe deformation. 
Without having the intention to go into too much 
detail, we have to understand why, on one side, the equili-
brat ion (retraction) can be so fast whereas, on the other 
side, the total escape ("disengagement") of the chain mole-
eule from its original tube is so time consuming. This is 
a typical situation for a macromolecular system. The "time 
of equilibration" turns out to be proportional to the square 
of the molecular mass, whereas the "time of disengagement" is 
found to be proportional to the cube of the molecular mass*) 
If the latter mass is high enough, the time of equilibration 
becomes small compared with the time of disengagement, being 
the leading time of the memory function. 
*) Footnote: According to Einstein one has: D~=kT/s~ =(L2)/2 Td 
where D~ is the longitudinal diffusion constant,s~ the 
corresponding friction factor, < 
L 2 ) the mean square dis-
placement and Td the disengagement time. Since L and 
s~ 
are proportional to the molecular mass, one obtains for 
T d a proportionality to the cube of the molecular mass44 ) . 
252 

As already announced above, the independent alignment 
approximation forms an additional step of simplification: 
If retraction is so effective that the individual coil molecule 
does not change its mean square end-to-end distance, it under-
goes a pure orientation. As the coil has a statistical con-
formation, the effect of this orientation must be very similar 
to that of the independent alignment of its randomly oriented 
links. In order to check the usefulness of the independent 
alignment approximation experimentally, one has to check 
the usefulness of the tensor Q. This is analogous to the 
check of the usefulness of the Finger tensor ~, which is 
actually carried out when Lodge's elastic liquid model is 
tested. 
2.4.3.3 Evaluation. 
As a first step, we have to calculate the compo-
nents of Q (in analogy to eq. (2.1.7) for the Finger tensor).

with respect to

From these equations one notices that a further integration 
with respect to 0 is no Ion ger possible in closed form. 
For small values of y the following Taylor expansions 
are readily obtained, however: 
F1 (y) = (y/S) [1 -
(S/21)y2 + ... ]

For large y the following asymptotic expansions

(l/y ) + ... 
••• (2.4.89) 
F2(y) = (l/y) + ... 
. .. (2.4.90) 
In the original paper also approximative equations for 
F1 (y) and F2 (Y) are given for the whole range of y. A 
graphical representation, as given in part 4 of the publi-
255 

cation by Doi and Edwards, is preferred for the present 
purpose. This graph is reproduced as Fig. 2.9. 
The most intriguing property of F1 (y) is its 
maximum near y = 2. This means that in a shear relaxation 
experiment, as described for Lodge's model by eq. (2.3.2), 
the initial shear stress (which occurs immediately after 
the step in the shear strain) will no longer increase when 
this step in shear strain surpasses the value two. [5 F1 (y) 
replaces B12 = Y in eq. (2.3.2), as becomes obvious for 
small y from eq. (2.4.87).] This observation means that the 
model becomes unstable at larger step strains. Cf. eq. 
(2.4.25) for the corotational model. In contrast, however, 
to the corotational model, the independent alignment model 
meets the Lodge-Meissner criterion! (Cf. eqs. (2.4.80) and 
(2.4.81).) As a matter of fact, Doi and Edwards derived a 
criterion for the onset of melt fracture from the mentioned

shape of F, (y). This forms another very spectacular aspect 
of the theory. The molecular interpretation of this formal 
result will be postponed to Chapter 3. 
other features of this constitutive equation are: 
After a step in the shear rate y from zero to a constant 
value (ramp function in y, "stressing experiment"), shear and 
normal stress differences are developed. In contrast to the 
results of Lodge's theory, also a second normal stress differen-
ce N2 is developed, which is of the right sign and order of 
magnitude, when compared with the first normal stress difference 
N, (i.e. N2 is negative and of the order of '0 to 30 per cent 
of N" 
as found by experiment.). With increasing shear rate 
the shear stress and the second normal stress difference show 
the phenomenon of overshoot, whereas the first normal stress 
difference does not show this phenomenon. (There is no constant 
ratio between N, and N2 according to this model!) In fact, all 
these properties are related to the shapes of the curves shown 
in Fig. 2.9. These properties are realistic and qualitatively 
born out by experiment. No spurious oscillations are shown by 
the transient behaviour, since the speed of rotation of the 
independently aligning chain link is not constant, but is 
going to zero when the direction of the link approaches the 
tangent to the flow lines. 
In principle, there is also arelationship with the 
Cox-Merz rule. (See Section '.'.2). As is well-known, according 
to this rule the non-Newtonian steady shear viscosity of a 
polymer melt, as obtained at a certain shear rate q, is extre-
mely weIl approximated by the absolute value of the complex 
dynamic viscosity, as measured at a circular frequency 
equal to q. In other words, the non-linear proper~y of the 
non-Newtonian viscosity can be predicted from measurements 
which are carried out in the linear regime. Notwithstanding the 
fact that the Cox-Merz rule cannot exactly be reproduced by the 
Doi-Edwards theory, the quasi-linear character of the indepen-
dent alignment model, which is not perturbed by any extra ad-
justable parameter for non-linearity, leads to basically the 
same conclusion: Also this model enables us to calculate the 
257 

non-Newtonian viscosity, and all other non-linear properties, 
from the sole knowledge of the linear memory function R(t-t'). 
2.4.3.5 Elongational Flow. 
Due to the high symmetry the integration of eq. 
(2.4.79) is rather easy, if the polar axis of the sperical 
coordinate system is put into the direction of the strain 
(1-axis). One obtains:

In contrast to the result of Lodge's constitutive 
equation, a steady state is always reached at elongational 
flow with constant E irrespective of the magnitude of E . At 
s 
s 
low rates of deformation the steady elongational viscosity is 
three times the steady shear viscosity, as it should be. At 
increasing rates of elongation E it goes through a slight 
s 
maximum*) and decreases like the shear viscosity, but it stays 
constant up to much higher values of Ethan the shear vis-
s

A conclusive comparison with experiments seems to be 
rather difficult. Low density polyethylenes behave more in 
accordance with Lodge's model, polystyrenes more in accor-
dance with the model of Doi and Edwards. Long chain branching, 
however, as occurring in low density polyethylene, may hamper 
the fast equilibration in the longitudinal direction of the

hypothesis. 
Although a Taylor expansion of the eqs. (2.4.91) at 
extension ratios ne ar A = 
does not directly seem necessary, 
as F3 (n is given in closed form, the result of such an 
expansion'is interesting nevertheless, if a comparison of the 
tensor Q with the Finger tensor ~ is tried. Provisionally, 
a factor 5 was introduced into the equation, which defines 
Q (see eq. (2.4.69)). The necessity of this factor appears, 
if the Taylor expansion eq. (2.4.87) is inspected: In fact, 
the corresponding component of the Finger tensor is just y. 
The same factor emerges, if y F1 (y) is compared with B11 -B 22 . 
It is not so directly obvious that this factor is also 
revealed by the eqs. (2.4.91). For the purpose, the first 
eq. (2.4.91) is expanded in terms of E according to the 
substitution: 
A 3_ 1 = 3 E (1 + % 
E + ... ) 
.•. (2.4.92) 
In this way one actually obtains to a first approximation 
in E: 
(2.4.93) 
A comparison with eq. (2.4.87) shows that 
= 3 
for E 
= y«

(2.4.94) 
as it should be. At the same time, the factor (1/5) is 
revealed also for the function F3 , justifying the extra 
factor 5, as introduced by the present author in eq. (2.4.69). 
2.4.3.6 Damping Functions. 
As a consequence of this consideration, the factors 
by which the components of the tensor Q deviate at arbitrary 
259 

values of y or A from the respective components of the 
Finger tensor, can be formulated as follows:

A glimpse at eq. (2.3.5') shows that these functions 
h,(y) and h 3 (A) can be considered as theoretical damping functions 
for shear and elongational flow, if the view of wagner45 ) 46) 
and Laun32 ) is accepted. The only defect of this consideration 
is that it has not yet been possible to show that h, and 
h 3 are in fact the same analytical function of the pair 
I, and 12 of invariants of the Finger tensor. For the moment, 
however this does not seem to be too serious an imperfection. 
In Figs. 2.'0 and 2." 
the functions h,(y) and h3 (A) 
are compared with analogous empirical functions, as obtained 
by wagner43 ) from experimental results by Laun'an9 by Osaki et 
al. 47 ), for which wagner45 ) 46) managed to show that they can be 
considered, if written in terms of I, and 12 , as analyti-
cally identical (see the next section on semi-empirical 
quasi-linear constitutive equations). The courses of the 
respective empirical and theoretical curves have a similar 
character. There is, however, no quantitative agreement.

to the network model and the independent alignment model), 
is clearly fulfilled. In fact, the network model is repre-
sented by the horizontal axis at h = 1. For further details 
see the caption to the figure. The way, in which the ex-
perimental damping functions are obtained, will be discussed 
in Section 2.5.3. For the purpose, the relaxation experiment 
eq. (2.3.2) is most suitable. 
2.4.3.7 Postscript. 
If one tries, in order to simplify the calculations, 
to replace the averages as prescribed by eqs. (2.4.75) to 
(2.4.79), by s.eparate averages of the ilUmerators and de-
nominators, one obtains (according to Marrucci 48 » 
really 
very simple results. Instead of eqs. (2.4.75) and (2.4.85) 
one has: 
= 
(1/3)y 
1+( 1/3)y2 
.•. (2.4.99) 
In fact, since the averaging has to occur over the iso-
tropie state of the vectors ~ (subscript zero), all 
squares of components furnish the average value 1/3 where-
as products of components with mixed indices give an average 
equal to zero. The equation which corresponds with eq. (2.4.76) 
gives a result very similar to that of eq. (2.4.99): Only 
the first power of y in the numerator of eq. (2.4.99) is 
replaced by the square of y. The equation corresponding 
with eq. (2.4.77), however, gives a value zero: The finite 
second normal stress difference, as predicted by eq. (2.4.77), 
is lost by the simplified averaging. Of interest is also the 
equation relevant for elongation tests, which corresponds 
wi th eq. (2.4. 79) : 
262 

= 
(1/3) (:>.. 2_:>.. -1) 
(1/3) 
(:>.. 2+2:>.. -1) 
• •• (2. 4.100) 
One may observe that eqs. (2.4.99) and (2.4.100) 
show in the numerator the respective components of the 
Finger tensor, vize (1/3) B 12 {Y) and (1/3) {B 11 (:>..)-B22 (A)), 
whereas the denominators become analytically identical, if 
expressed in terms of the first invariant I 1 of the Finger 
tensor, vize (1/3)I 1 • The factor (1/3) in the numerators 
should be compared with the corresponding factor (1/5) 
in the equations by Doi and Edwards. The correction factor 
(5/3) in eq. (2.4.71a) becomes now superfluous! The approxi-
mate damping functions h 1*{Y) and h 3*{:>"), which are equal to 
3/I 1 , are shown by dotted lines in Figs. 2.10 and 2.11 {cf. 
eq. (2.3.51)). On the logarithmic scale of the ordinate, no 
significant differences are found with respect to the more 
accurate functions given by eqs. (2.4.97) and (2.4.98). 
However, from a more principal point of view we 
cannot abandon the prediction of a second normal stress 
difference of correct sign and order of magnitude, even if 
this second normal stress is of no practical importance 
( IN21« 
IN1 I ). The fact that such a second normal stress 
difference 
can be predicted by a suitable molecular theory, 
has been stressed by J.L. wales26 ) some time ago. Wales con-
sidered the behaviour of an elastic dumbbell, in which the 
beads at its two ends were replaced by slender rotational 
ellipsoids, pointing towards the centre of the dumbbelh By 
this shape of the dumbbell Wales tried to express the 
fact that, in a concentrated system, the diffusion of the 
chain end-points in a radial direction is certainly easier 
than in a lateral direction. 
With a usual elastic dumbbell, with beads at its 
end-points, the distribution of end-points is only changed 
in the direction of shear flow (1-direction). The distribu-
263 

tions in the other two directions remain Gaussian. This 
situation changes clearly with the dumbbell of Wales. For 
this model only the mean square projection of the end-to-end 
distance in the 3-direction (neutral direction) remains un-
changed, when compared with its valuein a stationary solution. 
The mean square projection of the end-to-end distance in the 
2-direction (perpendicular to the shearing plane) is reduced 
by the action of the flow. From these facts it follows quite 
naturally that 033 must be larger than 022 or, in other words, 
that the second normal stress difference must be negative (and 
small compared with the first one). 
If the ellipsoids are assumed to be extremely thin 
(axial ratio p = ~), the radial diffusivity is no more than 
twice the lateral diffusivity. Under these circumstances 
one finds approximately for all rates of shear: 
= 
=

•.. (2.4.101) 
Since the linear stress-optical rule remains valid 
for such a system, eq. (2.4.101) also describes the ratio 
of the optical quantities n33-n22 and n11 -n22 • How these quan-
tities can be measured, has been described in the previous chap-
ter (n11 -n22 = ßn cos 2X). This measurement furnishes, together 
with eq. (2.4.101), a very realistic result:,If for some 
reason n11 -n22 is negative, which is the case for poly-
styrene (due to the large polarizability of the benzene rings 
in the side groups), also n 33-n22 is found to be negative.

2.5 Quasi-Linear Models Containing Adjustable Elements 
2.5.1 Introduction 
As has been pointed out, Lodge's elastic liquid 
model does not predict non-Newtonian behaviour in steady 
shear flow. In contrast such a behaviour is predicted by 
the corotational model as well as by the independent 
alignment model. However, as these models do not possess 
adjustable parameters their predictions of non-Newtonian 
shear flow are rather rigid. This justifies our search for 
more flexible models in the hope that adjustable parameters, 
functions or functionals can be explained by some physical 
argumentation. 
2.5.2 The n-Measure of Strain 
As already indicated in connection with the inde= 
pendent alignment model, a quasi-linear constitutive equation 
must not necessarily be based on the Finger tensor. An elegant 
generalization of Lodge's model was given by N.W. Tschoegl and 
coworkers 5) already be fore the publication of the independent 
alignment model. In an adapted notation Tschoegl's "L-model" 
(for liquid model in contrast to solid model) reads: 
... (2.5.1) 
where the kinematic tensor is defined in Sect. 2.1.2 and n is a 
dimensionless adjustable parameter. It is clearly seen that for 
n = 2 Lodge's model is obtained, whereas e.g. for n = -2 an ana-
logously constructed fluid model is formulated, which is based 
on the Cauchy tensor. 
It is not difficult to derive results for elongational 
flow from eq. (2.5.1). If the relaxation modulus 8(t-t') is 
265 

used in the form given by eq. (2.3.11), the result of a "stres-
sing experiment" with s(t,t')= Est for t' < 0 and s(t,t')= 
for t' > 0 
can be formulated quite analogously to that of 
model. If we remind ourselves that 
o 
A -n/2

Lodge's 
o 
(2.5.2) 
for elongational flow, we can see almost without calculation 
that the tensile stress 011 (with 022 = 033 = 0) must be:

(2.5.3) 
As a consequence, the discussion given in Sect. 2.3.2.2 
with respect to the attainability of a steady state situation 
remains completely valid. The only change is that instead of 
the factor two a factor n occurs in the critical inequality 
2E S T 1 <1. The 
effect of the n-measure is that a steady state flow 
situation becomes impossible at a somewhat higher elongational 
rate E , since n 
< 2. However, this seems only a modest modifi-
s 
-
cation of Lodge's result in view of the experimental accessibi-
lity of steady state tensile flow in a wide range of elongational 
rates. 
A quite different situation is encountered, if shear 
flow is considered. Whereas in the case of the use of the 
Finger tensor the viscosity of the fluid model remains in-
dependent of the rate of shear, one obtains clearly 
non-Newtonian behaviour with the use of the n-measure. Un-
fortunately, the obtained equations are too complicated for 
a general analytical formulation of the results. S.C. Sharda, 
266 

P.J. Blatz and N.W. Tschoeg149 ) have given a numerical evalu-
ation which will not be reproduced here. 
Interestingly enough, with a value of n = 1,5 a ratio of second 
to first normal stress difference of -(1/8) is obtained for a 
rubber obeying Tschoegl's modified theory of rubber elasticity 
(see Sect. 2.1.2, eqs. (2.1.41) and their discussion). As is 
well-known, sign and order of magnitude of this theoretical 
ratio of second to first normal stress difference are realistic 
for polymer melts in steady shear flow. A numerical evaluation 
of eq. (2.5.1) for several shear flow situations would be very 
interesting from the point of view that eq. (2.5.1) meets the 
requirements of the Lodge-Meissner test (see eq. 2.1.40). 
2.5.3 The Experimental Damping Function 
2.5.3.1 
Introduction. 
As already briefly discussed in Sect. 2.3.3, several 
authors have proposed to factorize the strain dependent memory 
function into a merely time dependent linear memory function 
~(t-t') and a factor h, which depends on the invariants of the 
Finger tensor (see eq. (2.3.51». This factor h was called the 
damping factor by M.H. wagner46 ). It appears that J.L. White 
und N. Tokita50) were the first who conjectured the possibility 
of such a factorization. On the other hand, M.C.Phillips31) 
pointed out that the damping function can also be considered as 
part of the strain measure formed in this case by the product 
of the Finger tensor and the said damping factor. The concept 
of this factorization is primarily based on experimental obser-
vation. The theory by M.Doi and S.F.Edwards furnished some 
justification, as already mentioned. From the point of view 
of the entanglement network M. HOffmann51 ) argued that 
during adeformation some entanglements should disappear 
from a purely topological point of view. 
Due to the comparative ease with which the damping 
function is determined and applied, it has become a powerful 
267 

tool for the description of a variety of experiments, as there 
are: bUild-up and relaxation of stresses in intermittent flows, 
creep and sometimes also recovery. Both relevant flow geometries, 
shear flow and elongational flow could be treated. However, in 
shear flow no finite second normal stress differences can be de-
scribed owing to the use of the Finger tensor. As second normal 
stress differences are relatively weak in polymer melts, this 
shortcoming was not considered as being too serious*). 
2.5.3.2 
Experimental Evidence in Shear. 
One of the first observations was that, with a 
"stressing" experiment in shear, the total shear Ym 
qtm 
at which the shear stress passes through a maximum (overshoot), 
is independent of the applied rate of shear. Within the accuracy 
of the measurements, it appears to occur always at the same 
value of Ym, characteristic for a certain polymer. H. M. wagner46 ) 
gave a mathematical proof for the necessary connection between 
the above mentioned factorisability and the constancy of Ym. 
In principle a similar result also holds for the overshoot in 
the first normal stress difference. 
The clearest evidence, however, is obtained with the 
aid of the relaxation of stresses after a step in the strain. 
In shear tests this has been shown by K. Osaki for solutions 
of polystyrenes of sharp molecular mass in Aroclor47 )and by 
H.M. Laun32 ) for the melt of a well characterized low density 
polyethylene (Melt I of J. Meissner52 ». In fact, according 
to eqs. (2.3.2) with ~(t-t') replaced by ~(t-t')h(Yo2), 
one obtains: 
o 
= Yo heY 0 2 ) f ~et-t')dt' = 
(2.5.4) 
and 
(2.5.5) 
*) Footnote: In ref. 46 ) the possibility for a description of 
the second normal stress difference is discussed (eq. (3.16». 
268 

In these 
since for shear 
equations that, 
equations h(I 1 , 1 2) is replaced by h(y2), 
2 
one has 1 1 = 1 2 = 3 + y . It follows from these 
in case the memory function shows the capability 
of factorization, the so-called non-linear relaxation modulus 
G(yo,t) = 012(t)/yo has the same time dependence as the 
relaxing first normal stress difference. Both quantitites 
show the time dependence of the linear relaxation modulus alt) . 
In Fig. 2.12 the results obtained by H.M. Laun on 
the melt of the mentioned low density polyethylene at 
1500 C, are shown. Open symbols refer to measurements of 
the shear stress, closed symbols to those of the first 
normal stress difference. A good agreement between the

respective measurements is observed. The full lines 
through the points are obtained by vertical shifting of 
the curve holding for alt). The latter curve was obtained 
with great accuracy with the aid of a standard procedure 
(see Appendix A of this monograph) from oscillatory dynamic 
measurements. In this way the identical time dependences 
are clearly demonstrated. It should be kept in mind that, 
with increasing steps in the shear strain y 
(up to ~ 30!!!) 
o 
the corresponding shear stresses da not decrease as much 
as the moduli, so that the accuracy of the measurements 
remains reasonable. In the table enclosed in the figure, 
also the finite time intervals ßt are given which are needed to 
apply Yo in reality. From the uncorrected relaxing stresses 
correction factars were calculated and applied in order to 
obtain the points given in the graph. 
In Fig. 2.10 the shift factor h( Y02) is plotted 
against the applied values of Yo. As Osaki has pointed out 
first, the obtained experimental shift factor can reasonably 
be described by a sum of two exponentials (full line in the 
graph). For many purposes also a single exponential sUffices.*) 
For the investigated polyethylene one has: 
h(Y~) = 0,57 exp. [- 0,310h o 1J + 0,43 exp.[-0,106ho l] 
(2.5.6) 
and 
••• (2.5.7) 
respectively. Before a discussion of the usefulness of 
these exponential damping functions will be given and the 
way will be described, in which eq. (2.5.7) is ,found as 
the result of an optimization, it must be emphasized that 
the presented results show the validity of the Lodge-Meissner-
test for the investigated polyethylene melt up to a step 
strain of as much as y = 30,8! (Even at a relatively small 
o 
*) Footnote: In the vicinity of y = 0 this description cannot 
be very accurate since h must be quadratic in y. 
270 

value Yo = 3,14 the corotational model would show extreme 
deviations from the expectations on which the Lodge-Meissner-
test is based. See eq. (2.4.27). 
Before use is made of the single exponential damping 
function, the memory function is written as aseries of expo-
nentials, as obtained from a cornbination of eqs. (2.3.11) and 
(2.3.3) : 
.•. (2.5.8) 
In this form the memory function can easily be combined 
with the ~aid damping function. One obtains: 
t 
.r exp [-(1!Ti+nq)(t-t')l ~(t,t')dt' 
• .• (2.5.9) 
For steady sh'ear flow one has y(t,t') = (t-t')q. As 
a consequence, closed integration gives for the non-New-
tonian steady shear viscosity and the corresponding first 
normal stress function the following simple relations:

It was with the aid of a least square fit of eq. (2.5.10) that 
the coefficient n was determined by Wagner from the non-Newto-
nian viscosity of the investigated polyethylene. Excellent 
agreement was then found between measured and calculated first 
normal stress functions. No spectacular differences were found 
between functions calculated with the more accurate damping 
function of eq. (2.5.6) and the simplified function of 
271 

eq. (2.5.7), as long as experiments in shear were con-
sidered. 
In this connection the reader is reminded of Fig. 1.13, 
where the full lines stand for the results obtained with the 
more accurate damping function, whereas the dashed lines are 
obtained with the simpler equation (2.5.7). Positive experi-
ences with the latter equation were obtained more recently 
also for polystyrene Hostyren N 4000 V (cf. Fig. 1.71 for the 
dynamic mOduli)53) 54). In this case the first normal stress 
coefficient W1 
was also calculated from flow birefringence 
,s 
measurements (cf. Figs. 1.31 and 1.32). Excellent agreement 
was obtained between mechanical and optical measurements and 
also with the theoretical prediction. For stretching flow, 
however, calculated functions appear to be more sensitive to 
the accurate form of the damping function, as will be seen 
below. By the way, also the more accurate function of eq. 
(2.5.6) does not pose a principal problem with respect to 
the closed integration of an equation analogous to eq.(2.5.9). 
Transient stresses in the "stressing experiment" 
are obtained almost as easily as the steady state stresses. 
For the mentioned polystyrene the extinction angles 
as functions of time, as shown in Fig. 1.73, can be calcula-
ted rather accurately. (Some upward deviations of the theore-
tical curves are found for the two lowest rates of shear.) 
Very accurately, the curves of Figs. 1.74 and 1.75 are repro-
duced. (None of these curves can be described with Lodge's 
model: Cf. Fig. 2.4.) In Fig. 1.75 agreement is found for the 
optically determined points, corroborating the conclusion that 
the optical measurements do not suffer from the squeeze damping 
of the rheogoniometer measurements 53 ). Relaxation after stres-
sing at various times can also be described with the damping 
function model. Pertinent extinction angle curves have been 
shown in Fig. 2.2 for the same polystyrene. Whereas the ex-
tinction angle curve during the birefringence build-up (cf. 
the curve for q = 0,05 s-1 in Fig. 1.73) is readily described, 
for cessation of flow after 40 sand 80 s of stressing and 
272 

after steady shear flow deviation of the theoretical curves 
are found after about 10 s of relaxation. In all these cases 
the theoretical curves lie above the experimental points53 ) • 
If eq. (2.5.10) is differentiated with respect to the 
shear rate q, one finds that: 
... (2.5.12) 
An analogous equation holds for the transient properties 
~1 (q,t) and n(q,t). If the steady shear stress is described 
by a power-law relation at sufficiently high rates of shear, 
one can conclude from eq. (2.5.12) that the same holds for 
the first normal stress difference, the exponents being 
equal for both stresses. If one has 012 
the non-Newtonian shear viscosity and the 
function:

(2.5.14) 
Since the exponent r must be smaller than unity, ns is de-
creasing with q, but 1/J 1 
is more rapidly decreasing, com-
,s 
pletely in accordance with experience. A rough estimate 
of the coefficient n in the damping function is obtained 
by comparing the "fluidities" $ and n, as obtained at 
sUfficiently high rates of shear: 
n = t (l-r) 
(2.5.15) 
273 

2.5.3.3 Non-Linear Shear Creep. 
According to eqs. (2.3.44) and (2.3.45) 
one obtains 
after inclusion of the damping function: 
t 
= y(t)h(t)8(t)+fJ?(t-t' )h(t,t' )y(t,t' )dt' 
o 
(2.5.16) 
where constant shear stress 012 is applied at t = 0, h(t) 
is e.g. given by e-ny(t) and y(t,t') = y(t)-y(t'). 
This equation is an integral equation of the Volterra 
type since the upper limit of the integral contains the 
independent variable. However, a closer inspection reveals 
that this equation is nonlinear in a rather complicated 
manner since the damping function contains the dependent 
variable in the exponent. On first sight it may seem that 
the combination y(t)h(t) can be considered as a new dependent 
variable of a linear integral equation. But this is not 
the ca se because of y(t,t')h(t,t') being equal to [y(t) - y(t'») 
exp [-ny(t») exp [+ny(t'»). With h(t,t') = 1 Lodge's model 
furnishes a linear equation, but the solution of this equation 
seems rather irrelevant for realistic experimental situations. 
An analytical solution of eq. (2.5.16» 
being im-
possible, M.H. wagner 25 ) solved this equation by a numerical 
methode For the purpose , eq. (2.5.16) is wri t·ten in the form:

with the n in the exponent of the damping function.

Further values of y(t1), y(t2 ) and so forth, are 
then obtained by the following non-linear recursion formula, 
as derived from eq. (2.5.17):

As the comparitively simple expressions for Ak (t1) and 
Ak (t2 ) show, already known values y(tj ) at previous time step 
are contained in Ak(t) 
together with the unknown y(t ). This 
n 
n 
latest y(tn ) is then determined by an iteration procedure, 
because of the notorious non-linearity of eq. (2.5.23). The 
magnitude of the time step ßt was varied over almost four 
decades in order to check the accuracy of the method. With 
decreasing magnitude of 
ßt the values of y(tn ) 
slightly increa-
sed and converged to the values independent of 
ßt. Only for the 
last time interval t n -
t n_1 during which the memory function 
can change considerably, a smoothing procedure was introduced. 
In this way the non-linear shear creep y(t) could 
be calculated. If instead of the single exponential the 
more accurate damping function, as given by eq. (2.5.6) 
was used, surprizingly similar results were obtained, 
as shown in Fig. 2.13 together with directly measured creep 
va lues for the above mentioned polyethylene at 1500 C. 
In the same figure the first normal stress difference is 
plotted which is measured simultaneously with the shear 
creep. The calculated curves (for both approximations to the 
damping function) are obtained with the aid of the equation: 
(2.5.24) 
where y(t), as obtained by the above mentioned procedure, 
is directly inserted into the quatrature formulae of the 
Ak(t). In fact, eq. (2.5.24) represents a straight forward 
integration, (o11-012)t being a time dependent stress

This is in contrast to the role of the given constant 
value of °12 , for which y(t) has to be found by the in-
version of the integral equation. 
In a way, similar to that by which the non~linear 
creep function y(t) was obtained, also the constrained 
recovery (see Sect. 2.3.2.3) after a "stressing e~periment" 
which had been extended over a finite time t 
(or total shear

flow history between t' = 0 and t' = t o must be incorpo-
rated in y(t'), as contained in h(t,t') and, also 
explicitly in A1 (t). The recovery is then obtained as

with y(t) < y(to ) due to the recovery. Results of this 
calculation seem rather realistic. Nevertheless, their dis-
cussion will be postponed to a later section. In fact, further 
investigations of M.H. Wagner and S.E. Stephenson55 ) 56) re-
vealed that the damping function approach was less suitable 
for "decreasing" deformations. This will become particularly 
obvious with the recovery after extension experiments. 
2.5.3.4 How to Find the Damping Function 
for an Extension Experiment. 
Unfortunately, no relaxation experiments after a 
step in strain have been carried out for the geometry of 
an extension experiment. This fact led M. H. wagner45 ) 46) to 
the construction of a method by which the damping function 
could be derived with reasonable accuracy from the stressing 
experiment. 
In analogy to eq. (2.3.34) the equation for the tension 
011(t) in the stressing experiment (at constant rate of 
elongation Es) is given by: 
t 
. 
0l1Ct) = f JCt-t')h(t.t,)[\2Ct.t,)_\-l Ct • t 'J] dt' + 
o 
..• (2.5.27) 
The normal stresses 022 and 033 are put equal to zero in 
this equation. Before the substitution T = t-t' is 
carried out, the special structure of \(t,t'), as given 
278 

by eqs. (2.3.33) and (2.3.35) is recalled. If for dt) 
the product €st is inserted, one obtains: 
(2.5.28) 
Since h(t,t ' ) must be a function of the invariants I 1 
and I 2 of the Finger tensor, which read A2+2~1 
and 
A- 2+2A' respectively, it becomes clear that h(t,t ' ) is 
also a function of T , i.e. hIT). As a consequence, for 
the stressing experiment in extension eq. (2.5.27) can be 
rewritten as follows: 
t 
0ll(t) = J J(T) h(T)[A 2 (T) - A -1(T) JdT + 
o 
••• (2.5.29) 
If this equation is differentiated with respect to time t, 
where fi(t) = - da(t)/dt, one finds: 
• •• (2.5.30) 
After dividing both sides of this equation by alt) and carrying 
out a partial integration one has: 
If, finally, E/E 
is substituted for t, one finds:

This eguation provides a basis for the evaluation 
of h(E) from experimental data on 8(t) and on 011 (E). 
For this evaluation data of H.M. Laun and H. Münstedt57 )were 
used, as obtained on the mentioned low density polyethylene. 
In the present section a graph is reproduced of the experimen-
tal damping function h(E), as constructed by the procedure just 
described. This Fig. 2.14 shows a plot of In h vs. Hencky strain E. 
Two dashed straight lines are drawn as initial tangent and as 
asymptotic tangent at high strains, respectively. As pointed out 
by Wagner, the slope of the latter straight line must 
necessarily be minus two if a steady state, as shown in 
the work by H.M. Laun and H. Münstedt, is to be reached 
at high values of E • In fact, at high E the tension 011

is governed by \2 
exp [2s]. This exponential dependency 
must be compensated by a factor exp[-2s] in the damping 
factor. Otherwise the tension goes to infinity with s . 
1t appears that the asymptotic line crosses the axis for 
ln hIs) = 0 at So = 3,0. For the slope of the initial 
tangent a value m = - 0,30 is found. These results are 
combined in the following equation: 
= 
a exp [2sJ + (l-a) exp [ms] 
(2.5.33) 
where a = exp [-2s o ] which is rather small compared with 
unity. The full line in the graph is drawn according to 
eq. (2.5.33). Excellent agreement is found between the 
experimental stressing results by H.M Laun and H. Münstedt, 
when 011(s) is recalculated with the aid of the above 
damping function. A reasonable agreement is found also 
with previous data by J. Meissner 52 ). (Cf. Fig. 2.11). 
According to the general concept, as pointed out 
in the Sections 2.3.2.3 
and 2.5.3.2, the damping function 
should be a unique function of the invariants 1 1 and 1 2 of the 
Finger tensor, irrespective of the type of flow. 1t is not easy 
to make plausible that this is the case also for the empirical 
damping functions, as found for shear, eq. (2.5.6), and for 
elongation, eq. (2.5.33). With the handling of the expression 
of the damping function for shear no difficulties are 
experienced, since 1 1-3 
1 2-3 = y2. On the other hand, if for 
example we try to express eq. (2.5.33) in terms of the first 
invariant 1 1 = exp [2s] + 2 exp [-E] (which is different from 
1 2 = exp [-2 E] 
+ 2 exp [E]), we immediately experience the 
difficulty that the expressions for 1 1 and 1 2 , as functions ofE, 
cannot be analytically inverted. Nevertheless, Wagner managed 
to plot the damping function of eq. (2.5.33) against 1 1-3 
and 1 2-3, as shown in Fig. 2.15 (Curves indicated by a = 1 
and a = 0, respectively). Since 1 1 and 12 are not the same, 
different curves are obtained. Then he tried the linear 
interpolation:

For u = 0,032 he obtained a curve which very nicely fitted 
the experimental points for h(y2) from Laun's experiments 
in shear, which are not influenced by u. The conclusion is that 
the damping function

+ f 2 exp 
[-n 2 laI 1 +(1-a)I 2 1

u = 0,032 nicely describes shear and stretching experiments 
of the mentioned low density polyethylene. This result is of 
principal importance. For practical calculatiohs, however, 
the original versions, eqs. (2.5.6) and (2.5.33) must be 
preferred. 
Interestingly enough also a maximum in the time depen-
dent stressing viscosity can quantitatively be described by 
the damping function given by eq. (2.5.35). (See the end of 
Section 2.5.5.4.)

2.5.3.5 Non-Linear Extensional Creep. 
As a starting point for these calculations eq. 
(2.5.27) was used by M.H. wagner45 ). With

These express ions are used in the same way as the analogous 
express ions for shear creep as given in eq. (2.5.18). 
For the stretch ratios \(tn ) an equation is derived from 
eq. (2.5.36), which is a non-linear algebraic equation 
with a similar purpose as eq. (2.5.23). 
It reads: 
... (2.5.38) 
Every \(tn ) is determined from this equation by iteration, 
previous \(t.)-values being already known from earlier 
J 
steps of this procedure. For the first step the instantaneous 
stretch ratio 
\(+0) is estimated from a(+O) in a similar 
way as y (+0) . 
283 

In this way, A(t) 
(or E (t»

tively derived for creep experiments by Laun and Münstedt,

by 8 0 , whereas the factors of A_ 2 (t) and A 1 (t) become A (t)

the basis of data for Melt I are shown. Dependent on the 
magnitude of 8 0 the threads are drawn out rather suddenly

increasing 8 . Lodge's elastic liquid model fails to show

this technically important effect.

Münstedt, however, the use of the damping function 
appeared rather inadequate. Because of the importance

2.5.4 The Irreversibility of the Disentanglement Process 
2.5.4.1 Introduction. 
In the past, several authors have introduced the 
idea of the irreversible loss of network stands during 
deformation. In this connection one should mention authors 
as M.Yamamot0 59 ), A.I. Leonov and G.V. vinogradov60), 
R.I. Tanner61 ) and H.C. Booij62). As a criterion for the de-
285 

tachment of astrand from the network a limiting permissible 
force on the network junctions or a maximum permissible 
extension of the coiled network strand was assumed. As a 
consequence, the relaxation spectrum was expected to be 
seriously detracted at its long time tail by the maltreat-
ment of the material. On the other hand, no measures were 
proposed which should have prevented mathematical formalisms 
from producing arte facts with recovery or, more general, with 
"decreasing" deformations. 
Surprisingly, the most simple assumptions, as intro-
duced by M.H. Wagner, gave the most realistic results. As 
already mentioned, this author did not make a difference 
between large and small relaxation times. He just assumed 
that the chance to become ineffective, will be the same for 
all types ofstrands, which culminated in the postulate of 
the factorizability of the memory function and in the intro-
duction of the damping function. At the same time, however, 
M.H. Wagner and S.E. stephenson55 ) 56) postulated explicitly 
that none of these detached junctions should have the chance 
to reappear as an artefact during the mentioned decreasing 
deformations. As a matter of fact, this would occur with 
the unmodified use of the damping function. The proper 
criterion for the correct use of the damping function is 
that, in a time interval between a certain previous time t' 
and the present time t, there must never lie a minimum of 
the damping function. Such a minimum, howev~r, will formally 
occur if, say, at time t" (with t' < t" < t) the trend of 
the deformation is reversed. In this case the lowest value 
reached at t" must be used at present time t. Otherwise, the 
damping function is larger at present time t than at 'inter-
mediate previous times. This would have the same effect as 
the ghost-like reappearance of effective network strands. 
As a consequence, M.H. Wagner reformulated his 
theory as foliows: 
t 
g,+pl = f&Ct-t') H(t,t') ~Ct,t')dt' 
286 
(2.5.39) 

where H(t,t') is a functional of the strain defined as: 
t"=t 
H(t,t') = min 
{h(t",t')}. 
t"=t' 
. •. (2.5.40) 
Probably, a few words should finally be said with re-
spect to the notion of the decreasing deformation. With decrea-
sing deformation a macroscopically recoiling deformation is 
meant. However, the reader must be aware of the fact that such 
a type of deformation will mean an increasing deformation 
for those network strands which are created after the 
turning-point, whereas it means a decreasing deformation 
for the surviving network strands created before the 
turning-point. 
In the following sections, a discussion of the 
practical application of the outlined concept will be 
given and the consequences of this modified theory will 
be evaluated. It may be clear that no new aspects will 
be found for macroscopically growing deformations, as in 
them h(t,t') always reaches its lowest value at present 
time t, irrespective of the time t' of the creation of 
the network strands. On the other hand, with the use of the 
unmodified damping function recovery after extension is 
highly overestimated by the action of ghost strands. 
2.5.4.2 The Triple Step-Strain 
Experiment in Shear. 
As a nice illustration, in which no compllcated 
integrations are involved, the triple step strain experiment 
in shear can be considered, as described by M.H. Wagner and 
S.E. Stephenson56 ). For the purpose the flow history depicted 
in Fig. 2.18 
is introduced. At time t' = -t1 a step strain Y1 
is suddenly applied. At time t' = -t2another step strain 
-Y2 of inverse sign and somewhat smaller or equal magnitude 
is superimposed. Finally, at t' = 0 a third step strain Y3 
287

rich Steinkopff Verlag Darmstadt.) 
of the same sign as Y1 but of clearly smaller magnitude 
than Y2 , is applied. This history is applied to the unmodified 
damping function model (theory A) and to the model containing 
the damping functional of eq. (2.5.40) (theory B). 
Since the total strain remains constant over the 
separate time intervals, the shear components of the Finger 
tensor as well as the pertinent damping function are con-
stants too. The time dependent integrand only contains the 
memory function ~(t-t'), yielding the following functions 
for the respective intervals (-00, -t1), (-t1 , -t2 ) and 
(-t2 , 0):

fluence of the previous impact. This "spike-strain" test 
has been proposed by Wagner and Stephenson in order to check 
the right of existence 
of theory B in a convincing manner. 
With the aid of the data already known for Melt I, clear 
effects were predicted by the mentioned authors. With 
the aid of the linear stress-optical rule, flow birefrin-
gen ce measurements may probably be of great use in this type 
of tests. 
2.5.4.3 Description of Recovery Experiments. 
Results, as obtained after extensional stressing 
tests, are reported here only as an illustration of the 
usefulness of the irreversibility concept for the dis-
entanglement of network strands. If the stressing 
experiment (at constant Es) is started at ~' = 0 and the 
tension is removed at t' = t o ' one finds for effective strands 
created at t' > t o that they are subject to abiaxial extension 
( € < 0) since the cross-sectional area increases during 
elastic recovery. Because there are no measurements qn biaxi-
al extension of Melt I, Wagner simply assumed .symmetry of h(€) 
with respect to € = 0 (using eg. (2.5.33)). This assump-
tion is certainly not true for larger va lues of € but serves 
as a useful first approximation. (Cf. Fig. 2.11.) In Fig. 2.19

the previous section. Line 4 follows from the given analysis

not discussed here. Interestingly enough, the mentioned re-
sult of theory B is rather similar to that obtained by the

elasticity, as H.M. Laun has pointed out (see Fig. 1.17).

2.5.5 A Differential Type Constitutive Equation Containing 
Time Dependent Structural Parameters 
2.5.5.1 
Introduction. 
In the following a non-linear constitutive equation 
of the differential type (cf. Section 2.4.2.3) is discussed 
for several reasons. First of all, it is very instructive 
to deal not only with integral type equations. Secondly, 
the authors who proposed this equation (G. Marrucci 63 ), 
D. Acierno, F.P. La Mantia, G. Marrucci, G. Rizzo, G.C. Sarti 
and G. Titomanlio64 ) 65) 66) 67», achieved a degree of evalua-
tion readily comparable with that reached by Wagner. In this 
connection it is important to say that both types of theory 
have been successful in the description of flow birefringence 
data of a polymer melt, as obtained by the former cooperators 
of the present author. Thirdly, discussion of the above mentio-
ned differential type theory may open new aspects also of 
Wagner's treatment and of the Doi-Edwards approach. 
2.5.5.2 
Formulation of the Theory. 
This theory is formulated in terms of an approximate 
line spectrum, as used also in Wagners evaluations. The 
contributions of the separate relaxation processes i.s 
simply summed up. The following five equations are assumed 
to be capable of describing the behaviour of a polymerie 
melt adequately:

.. , (2.5.47) 
1,4 
x. 
~ 
• •• (2.5.48a,b) 
••. (2.5.49) 

In fact, eq. (2.5.47) is of the type coined by 
eq. (2.4.67) except for gi being taken time dependent. 
The subscript at the second term on the left side means, 
as in eq. (2.4.67), the first contravariant convective 
derivative of the quantity between brackets with respect to 
time. This second term was modelled by the authors in analo-
gy to what would be correct for the classical (entropy-) 
elastic dumbbell model. The desired non-linearity is intro-
duced into the model by eqs. (2.5.48a, b), where the inter-
nal structural paramter xi is obtained from eq. (2.5.49), 
which has the shape of an equation of chemical reaction 
kinetics. Parameter x. can have values between one 
1 
(linear case) and zero. The first term on the right side 
of eq. (2.5.49) stands for the creation of junctions of 
type "i" due to Brownian motion, the second term gives 
the rate of destruction. In this second term 
E. 
1 
(1/2) tr 0. 
=1 
(2.5.50) 
is the (entropie) free energy due to the network strands 
of type "i" and a 
is an adjustable dimensionless para-
meter. The higher the Ei'S, the faster the destruction 
of the network. 
It is assumed that every relaxation mechanism is 
representative for a certain degree of complexity of the 
respective entanglements and keeps its identity also during 
the deformation. (This assumption avoids interaction terms 
and rescues the superposition formulated by eq. (2.5.46).) 
Part of the entanglements of type "i", however, is lost 
during the deformation. This is expressed by eq. (2.5.48a) 
which is derived from the classical theory of rubber 
elasticity (g. being proportional to x.). On the other hand, 
1 
1 
the relaxation time Ti of the specific mechanism is supposed 
to depend on xi as well. The corresponding eq. (2.5.48b) 
is derived from the empirical concentration dependence of 
the zero shear viscosity of a concentrated polymer solution, 
being of the 3,4th power in the concentration. To the present 
author, this argumentation seems a little unsatisfactory. 
293 

Nevertheless, this point will form part of an interesting 
discussion, since with T. being constant, no sufficient 
], 
differentiation between the shear rate dependences of the 
shear stress and of the first normal stress difference can 
be obtained. From a principal point of view the present 
author prefers a more general formulation of eq. (2.5.48b), 
viz. : 
r 
T. = 
T 
. 
X 
l. 
Ol. 
.,. (2.5.48c) 
where r is another adjustable parameter. He considers 
r = 1,4 a very lucky choice, but probably not more. To 
hirn it seems surprising enough if only two parameters a and 
r, both adjustable within a rather limited range, can 
serve for an adequate description of the non-linear me-
chanical properties of all types of polymer melts. 
From the point of view of flow birefringence it seems 
particularly satisfactory that the features of the theory 
of rubber elasticity, which are essential for the validity 
of the linear stress-optical rule, are preserved in this 
theory. The stress is caused in this system, as in ideal 
rubber, by the statistical restoring forces exercised by the 
network strands on the junctions. As already mentioned in 
Section 2.2.1, chain statistics are also responsible for the 
anisotropy of polarization of the respective network strands, 
so that the average contributions of a single strand to the 
stress tensor and to the refractive index tensor are 
proportional to each other. Network strands are assumed to 
remain in interna 1 thermodynamic equilibrium, as in the 
approach of Doi and Edwards. 
Finally it should be mentioned that R.J.J. Jongschaap68) 
was able to show that eqs. 2.5.47 and 2.5.49 can be derived from 
a balance law of the segment-distribution function in the tran-
sient network model. This makes the model certainly more accep-
table from a fundamental point of view.

2.5.5.3 Evaluation for Steady Homogeneous 
Shear Flow. 
Although rectangular Cartesian coordinates have been 
used throughout (except for Section 2.4.2), upper tensor 
indices are used in the following as in the original papers. 
This facilitates the use of subscript "i" for the indication 
of the "i"-th relaxation mechanism. Further, one should keep 
in mind that the convective derivatives with respect to time 
do not vanish in the steady state. In fact, one obtains in 
analogy with eqs. (1.1.25):

All other components of these products are zero. Observing

easily:

The second normal stress difference is identically zero 
as in Lodge's model. The only difference with the result.of 
Lodge's theory is that 9 . and T ., occurring in the latter 
Ol 
Ol 
theory, are replaced here by g. and 
T .• For the considered 
l 
l 
steady state also giand Ti are independent of time. They 
can be obtained with the aid of eqs. (2.5.48a,b) from the 
steady state solution of eq. (2.5.49). For the purpose we 
first observe that for steady shear flow one has: 
(1/2)Oi 11 
2 2 
gi Ti q 
(2.5.53) 
295 

Inserting this value of Ei into eq. (2.5.49) one 
obtains with dXi/dt = 0: 
:: 
a 'oi q 
(2.5.54 ) 
It is very easy to draw a curve describing xi as a func-
tion of q from this equation, since the inverse function is easily 
constructed: given an arbitrary xi between zero and one, the 
pertinent dimensionless a biq is quickly calculated. As expected, 
xi decreases monotonously with increasing a'oiq . 
The steady state shear viscosity ns and first normal 
stress function W1 
are now easily obtained:

~ 
oi 
(2.5.56 ) 
First of all, we have to check the role of the 
adjustable parameter a. If one imagines a plot of xi vs. 
log(a'oiq ), one notices that a is a common shift factor 
on the logarithmic q-axis for all functions of x .. Experi-
~ 
mentally, a has been found to be in the range between 0,25 
and 0,4, in agreement with a kinematic study of B.J. Meister69 ) 
who used an "interacting sphere" model for the interaction 
of coiled molecules in shear. 
The conclusion is that parameter a has no influence on 
the shapes of the curves describing n 
and w1 
as functions 
s 
,s 
of q on double logarithmic scales. Also the influence of para-
meter r, as occurring in eq. (2.5.48c), is restricted to the 
course of W1 
at large values of T .q. In fact, for large 
,s 
o~ 
2 4 
va lues of 'oiq eq. (2.5.54) reduces to xi' = 1/a Toiq . As 
a consequence, eq. (2.5.55) for the steady state shear visco-
sity becomes ns = (1/a q) 
1: goi' irrespective of the exponent 
296 

1+r of xi' On the other hand, the expression for w1,s becomes 
governed by the exponent (2+r)/(1+r) of (1/a q) in the range of 
high values of T .q. So, parameter r serves as a modulator for 
o~ 
the shape of the ~1,s-curve. (With decreasing va lues of Toiq 
parameters xi approach unity so that ns and w1,s become con-
stants, independent of r, and in accordance with the expecta-
tion of Lodge's theory.) From this point it is almost a miracle 
that a universal value r = 1,4 will be adequate for all types 
of polymers. So far, positive experience has been gathered 
with a low density polyethylene and a polystyrene, in the latter 
case with the aid of flow birefringence (see next section). 
In comparing the results of wagner's approach with 
those of the present theory one cannot detect convincing simi-
larities between the respective eqs. (2.5.10) and (2.5.11) on 
one side and (2.5.55) and (2.5.56) on the other side. (It goes 
without saying that symbols gi and Ti' as occurring in the first 
two equations, correspond with the symbols g . and T . 
o~ 
o~ 
in the latter two equations.) It is perhaps interesting 
to note that every term of eq. (2.5.10) decreases with 
(1/q2), when q'i becomes large enough, whereas every 
term of eq. (2.5.55) decreases only with (1/q), when 
(aToiq) becomes large enough. Certainly, the damping 
function is only approximate and determined on a system 
which has a relaxation time spectrum extending far into 
the range of short times. But, for the hypothetical case that 
the system has only one finite relaxation time, eq. (2.5.10) 
predicts an instability with increasing rate of shear q, 
since the shear stress niq finally decreases with increasing 
q. In the contrary, according to eq. (2.5.55) the shear 
stress niq becomes a constant under these circumstances. 
This seems a more acceptable result. It is independent of 
the choice of r in eq. (2.5.48c). 
In reality, however, these·ultimate properties of the 
incremental stresses are of almost no practical importance, 
due to the mentioned characteristics of the relaxation time 
spectrum. At large shear rates terms corresponding to the 
297 

available short relaxation times always prevail. For these 
terms the product q~i is not large but of the order of unity. 
2.5.5.4 Description of Other Deformations 
with Given Strain History. 
Following the description of steady shear flow, as 
given in the previous section, the logical next step will 
be the description of the stressing experiment in shear, 
with q = 0 for t 
~ 0 and q = constant for t 
> O.

led to a set of three dimensionless differential equations 
with the dimensionless independent variable t. and the 
1 
dimensionless parameter q .. (In these equations, factor '1' 
14
1 
is replaced by x. ' 
, because of eq. (2.5.48b).) The depen-
1 
dent dimensionless variables are Ti' Ni (and xi). For 
each of these latter functions, as obtained by a non-recurring 
numerical calculation, a three-dimensional plot, with t i 
and qi at the two abscissae, furnishes the whole information 
needed for the construction of the solution for a given un-
disturbed relaxation time spectrum and given values of time t 
and shear rate q. In fact, if t and q are properly chosen, 
one obtains for a given Toi the values of t i and qi and, 
from the mentioned three-dimensional plots, the respective 
values of Ti and N .. The value of x. is also needed in order 
1 
1 
12 
11 
to calculate gi = goixi and, subsequently, 0i 
and 0i 
The final results are obtained by taking the sums over i. 
It may be mentioned that T. and N. show the phenomenon 
1 
1 
of stress overshoot, if qi is of the order of unity or larger. 
The same feature is shown in the final results, but less pro-
nounced. If a suitable relaxation time spectrum is chosen, 
Meissner's results 52 ) on a low density polyethylene melt are 
nicely reproduced. 
At this point the evaluation of flow birefringence 
da ta is of special interest. B. de Cindio, D. Acierno, F.H. 
Gortemaker and H.Janeschitz-Krieg170) have obtained very 
satisfactory results for polystyrene Hostyrene N 4000 V 
with the aid of a parameter a = 0,35, as obtained from 
curve fitting on the steady state shear viscosity as a func-
tion of shear rate q. In particular, the results ~f Fig. 1.73 
could nicely be reproduced. (Some downward deviations of the 
theoretical curve are found for the highest rate of shear 
q = 0,07s- 1 applied.) Particularly nice results (full lines) 
-1 
0 
were obtained for shear rates q = 0,033 and 0,050s 
at 170 C. 
These results are reproduced in Fig. 2.20 together with the 
corresponding results of Lodge's model (dashed lines).

Stress relaxation after shear flow is treated in a 
similar way. As flow birefringence data show, excellent re-
sults are obtained. In this connection Fig. 2.21 is repro-
duced from the above mentioned paper. It contains the relaxa-
tion of the doubled extinction angles after total shears of 
1, 2 and 4, as shown in Fig. 2.2. The agreement between 
calculated (full) curves and experimental points is very 
satisfying. 
Further it should be mentioned that, in principle, 
the presented differential model satisfies the Lodge-
Meissner test. According to this model the structure of 
the material immediately after the strain impulse is still

the structural parameters x. a finite time is needed

according to eq. (2.5.49). It is not known, however, whether 
Laun's measurements of the relaxation of shear stress and 
first normal stress difference (Fig. 2.12) can be described 
sufficiently accurately just because of the finite time interval 
needed in practice for the application of the deformation.

used, this equation is identical with eq. (6.48) on p. 115 
in Lodge's book and with eq. (1.1.38). For Es = 0 one obtains 
the Trouton viscosity, which is three times the zero shear, 
or Newtonian, viscosity. 1f in Lodge's case ('oiEs) approaches 
the value one half, his viscosity increment goes to infinity.

This does not happen, however, for the present model. The reason 
is that T. and g. depend here on E in a proper way. (If T;

and g. are expressed as functions of x. through eqs. (2.5.48a,b), 
~ 
~ 
a combination of the three eqs. (2.5.60), (2.5.61) and 
(2.5.62), with d/dt = 0, yields an algebraic equation for xi 
as a function of E .) With these functions T. (E ) and g; (Es)

one obtains, dependent on the not grouped parameter a , from 
eq. (2.5.64) a steady state viscosity increment which shows -
on a double logarithmic plot -
a more or less pronounced maxi-
mum at ToiE s 
~ 5 (order of magnitude: three times the Trouton 
viscosity increment). 
As the place of this maximum on the abscissa for 
€ shifts with Toi ' the viscosity of the system (i.e. 
~~ 
~ 
n 
= ~nie ), is still less pronounced and spreads over 
many decades in Es' in agreement with measurements on 
several polymers (see Fig. 1.14). This description is also 
valid for ~s < 0 (one-sided.compression). For a = 0,35, as 
found in shear experiments for polystyrene Hostyren N 4000 V, 
also a very satisfactory prediction of the (optically de-
termined) steady state viscosity in one-sided compression 
could be obtained, as was shown in Fig. 1.79 by the dashed 
line. 
Very interesting is also the result of the stressing 
experiment in uniaxial extension (Es = 0 for t 
< 0 and 
E 
= constant for t 
> 0). As in shear flow, the increments

o~ 
factor hundred. This fact has interesting consequences. 
Whereas for shear flow the overshoot resulting from the 
sum of the increments becomes very flat and dependent on 
the shape of the relaxation time spectrum, this resulting 
overshoot is not too much smoothed and nearly independent

of the special relaxation time spectrum for uniaxial 
extension. In fact, very recently T. Raible, A. Demarmeis 
and J. Meissner 71 )have shown that a maximum tensile stress was 
reached for stressing experiments on a low density polyethylene 
as carried out at two rates of elongation t s ' at a fixed Hencky 
strain of s = 5,5. This result can almost quantitatively be 
predicted by the present model without detailed knowledge of 
the relaxation time spectrum. Only a reasonable upper limit for 
the relaxation times is needed. A less perspicuous, albeit 
probably more quantitative description of this phenomenon was 
given by Wagner et al. 72 ) in terms of the damping function. 
2.5.5.5 Creep and Recovery. 
If, as for creep and recovery, not the strain 
history but the stress history is given, the evaluation 
of the eqs. (2.5.47) through (2.5.49) becomes more com-
plicated. In fact, one is no longer able to evaluate the 
behaviour of the "i"-th type of strands separately. This 
becomes obvious for shear experiments as foliows. 
If the equation for the shear stress, which follows 
from eq. (2.5.47) -
take eq. (2.5.57), with q replaced by 
time dependent y - is solved for the time derivative of 
the shear stress, one obtains:

After a summation over all differential equations of this

where 61 2 (=1:6. 12 ) is the time derivative of the prescribed

function 0 
(t). 
The differential equations for the incremental 
shear stresses 0. 12 and first normal stresses 0. 11 
(take 
l 
l 
eq. (2.5.58) with q replaced by y) are integrated numeri-
cally. The normal stresses are needed, since in eq. (2.5.67) 
E. is equal to (1/2)0. 11 . At each instant of time, the 
l 
l 
value of y is given by the algebraic eq. (2.5.67). This 
forms the link which governs the simultaneous integration. 
In the creep experiment 612 
is zero except for an 
arbitrarily short initial interval. For this interval a 
shear stress ramp is assumed. If this interval is taken 
short enough, its influence is "forgotten" rapidly enough. 
The initial condition for the stresses is zero, that for 
x. is one. With recoil, the initial conditions are deter-
l 
mined by the previous flow. Adescending shear stress ramp 
is introduced during a short per iod instead of a sudden 
negative step to zero. Pertinent normal stresses are 
obtained from the output of the mentioned calculations. 
If the relaxation time spectrum extends sufficiently far 
into the short time range as is practically always the case 
with polymer systems, no problems arise from ~ny "instan-
taneous" deformation. A sudden jump in the stress is "absorbed" 
by the short time part of the spectrum. For practical cal-
culation reasons, however, the spectrum must always be trun-
cated at the short time side. If this is done adequately, the 
artificial instantaneous deformation as well as the artifi-
cial jump in the normal stress can be kept small enough to 
be disregardable. 
306 

An analogous procedure is developed by the mentioned 
authors for creep and recovery in uniaxial extension. The 
calculations are reported to be not as time consuming as 
one may guess. In fact, the smallest relaxation times are 
only important in the initial situation. The corresponding 
contributions very soon reach a quasi-steady state. As a 
consequence, the equations for the smallest relaxation times 
can be dropped progressively. Their steady state solutions 
are simply added to the overall stress. Apparently, the 
discussed differential constitutive equation does not need 
any additional assumptions with respect to the irreversibi-
lity of the disentanglement. As a matter of fact, Meissner's 
results on Melt I are described by the differential consti-
tutive equation almost as neatly as by Wagner's theory B. 
(Cf. Section 2.5.4.3 and the original paper by Acierno, 
La Mantia and Marrucci 67 ).) 
As a final remark it is mentioned that the diffe-
rential type equation may be particularly useful for the 
description of non-isothermal processes, as occur in practical 
polymer processing. In fact, time dependent relaxation times, 
due to structural changes are already used. Time dependence, 
due to time dependent temperature changes, can rather easily 
be introduced. 
2.5.5.6 Free Volume as a Structural Parameter. 
An interesting development has recently been initi-
ated by F.P. La Mantia und G. Titomanlio73 ). Instead of 
using a structural parameter x. which is only vaguely linked 
1 
to the number of entanglements, they introduced the free 
volume concept which is well-known from the derivation of 
the WLF-equation. The assumption is made that flow creates 
extra free volume like a temperature rise. On the other 
hand, since free volume should not influence the number of 
entanglements noticeably, the mentioned authors keep the 
shear moduli g. for the entanglements of complexity 
1 
"i" constant. This reduces the number of simultaneous 
307 

equations by one, if a comparison is made with eqs. (2.5.46-
49). In particular, the following equations are proposed:

where fois the fractional free volume in the fluid at rest, 
whereas f. is that for the complexity "i" during flow and b

is the only adjustable constant. The fractional free volume 
f o = vf/v, as valid at temperature T, is obtained from the 
fractional free volume f g at the glass temperature, which is 
a "universal" constant 
0,025, by the following equation: 
(2.5.72) 
where 
a 
Equations (2.5.68) and (2.5.69) are familar from 
Section 2.5.5.2. Equation (2.5.70) is modelled by analogy 
with the well-known Doolittle equation (see Appendix B). In 
eq. (2.5.71) the symbol Ei means the free energy of the par-
tial network "i" according to eq. (2.5.50). According to 
eq. (2.5.71) the free volume does not change immediately with 
a change in Ei' but follows with some delay. As a matter of 
fact, a similar behaviour is found for the (total) volume of 
a rubber-like material when exposed to a sudden pressure rise. 
Since the value of Ei depends linearlyon the value of gi 
(through (2.5.50)), and g. is proportional to the interval 
l 
{I,. ln T 
,arbitrarily chosen on the logarithmic time scale, 
l 
0 
one has to divide through the magnitude of this interval in 
308 

order to obtain a result independent of this choice. (As 
is well-known this choice must be made in transforming a 
continuous relaxation time spectrum into an (approximate) 
discrete line spectrum.) In the previous papers of the 
Italian group this effect was achieved by dividing Ei simply 
by gi. However, since one has: 
.•• (2.5.73) 
where H. 
is the value of the continuous relaxation time 
~ 
spectrum H(T) for T = Toi (Toi being at the centre of the 
interval), one introduces an undesired extra influence 
of H(T .) on the relation between d f./dt and E., if 
o~ 
~ 
~ 
the ratio E./g. is used for the above mentioned purpose. 
~ 
~ 
As becomes clear from eq. (2.5.73), the first term 
between brackets of eq. (2.5.71) can alternatively be 
written b(H.E./g.). This formulation, however, creates the 
~ ~ 
~ 
impression as if H. 
is introduced into the relation, where-
~ 
as this is not the case. 
Equations (2.5.68 -
71) have successfully been 
used to describe experimental data obtained under isothermal 
conditions as well as during continuous heating of the samp-
les. Interestingly enough, the mentioned isothermal data 
have been considered crucial for the verification of the 
damping function concept and the results of the Doi and 
Edwards theory. Apparently, very different concepts 
can lead to similar results. Unfortunately, flow bire-
fringence data have not yet been interpreted with the aid 
of this free volume model. 
2.5.6 The Non-Affine Displacement 01 Temporary Network Junctions 
In 1974 A.S. LOdge 74 ) clearly stated that the assumption 
usually made in the theory of rubber elasticity, viz that 
in the average network junctions move affinely with the 
309 

macroscopic deformation, is a "bad" assumption for temporary 
junctions. It seems as if various theoreticians were stirred 
up by this remark and encouraged to introduce explicit 
adaptations into their theories. Simultaneously, two groups 
of investigators generalized Lodge's elastic liquid model in 
the indicated sense by releasing the affine deformation on a 
micro-scale. These theories are due to M.W. Johnson and 
D. Segalman7S ) on the one hand, and to Nhan Phan Thien and R.I. 
Tanner76 ) on the other hand. Whereas the first mentioned two 
authors generalized the single integral constitutive equation 
of Lodge on purely continuum mechanical grounds, introducing 
a single adjustable parameter for the degree of interna 1 rota-
tion of the volume element, the second two authors generalized 
the differential form of the equations by starting from an 
explicit consideration of a temporary network in which junctions 
show a certain slip. In addition, the second authors added a 
brief consideration of the influences of network stretching 
on the mechanisms of creation and destruction of network junc-
tions. In this way a second adjustable parameter is intro-
duced which is of influence only with so-called "strong" flows 
when a high degree of chain orientation is achieved. Otherwise 
the results of both theories are identical. In particular, for 
shear flow (which is considered to be a "weak" flow) the 
adjustable parameter for the degree of corotation furnishes 
an instrument to produce the desired non-Newtonian steady 
shear viscosity and shear rate dependent normal stress coeffi-
cients, including one for the second normal'stress difference 
of right sign and order of magnitude. Spurious oscillations of 
stresses, as characteristic for the corotational model during 
transient situations (see Section 2.4.1), are much less frequent 
and pronounced for the present model since the rotation of the 
volume element plays only a secondary role. As'Nhan Phan Thien 
and Tanner point out, these oscillation can even be avoided com-
pletely by an adequate uncoupling of creation and destruction 
rates, which are coupled in this theory only for convenience. 
In this way a rather useful theory is created which 
predicts rheological properties mainly on the basis of the 
independently determined linear viscoelastic properties of 
310 

the material (relaxation time speetrum). One (or two) additi-
onal parameters are needed for the non-linear behaviour as in 
previously deseribed theories. In this eonneetion, however, 
another theory based on the idea of internal slip must be men-
tioned79 ). As this theory is built on a rather different eon-
tinuum meehanieal basis, it will be treated separately. 
2.5.6.1 Deseription of the Network Model. 
As pointed out by F.M. wiege180), the probability 
distribution funetion f(n, 
~, t) for the oeeurrenee of a 
network strand of n subunits (monomerie units) with an 
end-to-end veetor ~ at time t is governed by an "equation 
of motion". Nhan Phan Thien and Tanner simplified this 
problem by eonsidering network strands of equal length and 
allowing for variations in n by introdueing a multiplieity 
of relaxation times afterwards. The simpllfied equation of 
motion reads for the ease of homogeneous flow: 
= 
df 
r' 
31:+ 
g -
h f 
••• (2.5.74) 
where g(~) is the rate of spontaneous ereation and 
h(~)f(~, t) is the rate of destruetion of network strands 
(eontaining n subunits). The flux of end-points of strands 
into the "volume-element" d 3 r is governed by ':t f(~, t). With 
this meaning of i in mind one ean appreeiate the following 
expression for the time derivative of r: 
~ -
p 
~ 
- s Q.r 
• .• (2.5.75) 
where ~ = ö ~ is the veloeity gradient tensor, Q = (1/2) 
(g + gT) i; the (symmetrie) rate of strain tens~r (for the 
medium as a eontinuum) and p, s are positive numerieal eon-
stants, for which the ranges of permitted values are re-
strieted. The first term on the right side determines the 
flux of end-points for the ease of the affine displaeement 
311 

of junctions. This term was used by Wiegel in his equations. 
The other two terms are introduced by Nhan Phan Thien and 
Tanner in order to describe the deviations from the affine 
movement of junctions. For shear flow one can easily recog-
nize that also these terms can be interpreted kinematically: 
If, in the average, end-points of a certain type do not move 
exactly in the direction of shear flow, the pertinent devi-
ation can be described in terms of its radial and angular com-
ponents. These components become recognizable, if eq. (2.5.75) 
is rewritten as follows: 
... (2.5.76) 
where ~ = -
(1/2) 
(~-
~T) is the vorticity tensor of the 
macroscopic flow field (see Section 2.4.1). The constants 
~ and p are taken rather small compared with unity, so that 
the main contribution is still furnished by the first term. 
The second term expresses the expectation that the end-to-end 
distance of the strand is more slowly extended in the 
average than according to the affine displacement of its 
end-point. The third term indicates the supposition that 
there must be a small extra angular component of the end-
to-end vector in the only possible direction. These super-
imposed movements are directly imaginable for the end-points 
of actual macromolecules. For intact junctions, however, these 
extra movements are only feasible, if in the average, other 
junctions are broken in a systematic way in the surroundings. 
In fact, the destruction of the junctions considered in eq. 
(2.5.74) is governed by the function h(~) on the right side 
of this equation. This points to the fact that, inavoidably, 
some vagueness is inherent in models of this type. 
The differential eq. (2.5.74) is transformed into a 
differential equation for the components of the macroscopic 
stress tensor with the aid of a method which has been invented 
by J.J. Hermans11 ) as early as 1943. According to this author 
the stress tensor of a network containing N strands (of n 
subunits each) in the unit of volume, is given by: 
312 

~ 
( 3 kTN/nb 2 ) fJI 
f

r 
E 
= 
= 
( 3 kTN/nb 2 ) (E E) 
(2.5.77) 
... 
where b 2 is the average square length of the subunit. 
For the indicated purpose eq. (2.5.74) is multiplied 
(term by term) by the dyad ~ ~ and integrated over the whole 
configurational space in ~. As the partial derivative with 
respect to time concerns the distribution function f, the 
first term on the left side simply furnishes the ordinary 
time derivative of the stress tensor ~*. (The paper by 
Nhan Phan Thien and Tanner treats the more general case of 
inhomogeneous flow, for which the substantial time derivative 
occurs at this place.) The second term is integrated by parts, 
as nicely described in Dynamics of Polymerie Liquids, Vol. 2, 
p. 483 30). With an arbitrary component r i r k of the dyad ~ ~ 
replaced by B(~) one obtains:

This result follows from the fact that the first integral 
after the first sign of equality vanishes. In fact, this 
integral can be transformed with the aid of the divergence 
theorem of Gauss into a surface integral at r = 00. But this 
surface 
integral vanishes as a consequence of the properties 
characteristic for the distribution function. 
In this way one obtains instead of eq. 
(2~5.74) and 
(2.5.75): 
~t <E E) -

Assuming for g the function 
g 
= 
. .. (2.5.81) 
where f (r) is the equilibrium distribution for the fluid 
0-
at rest and g1 is, for simplicity, a function of <E2 ) 
':mly, one obtains g1 1 for the first integral of the right 
side of eq. (2.5.79). In a similar way one obtains with h 
as a pure function of the same average value <E2 ) 
an 
expression h <E E) for the second integral on the right side. 
Apparently, the term 5 P (E E) is of the same nature and can 
be incorporated in h<E E;>' With these intermediarly results 
and eq. (2.5.77) one obtains instead of eq. (2.5.79): 
'* 
'* 
'* 
g 
- g 
g 
= 
•. , (2.5.82) 
At this stage one observes that(r2) is the trace of the 
dyade <E E) . With the aid of eq. (2.5.77) one recognizes 
that < 
r 2 > 
is proportional to the trace of ~* itself. As is 
weIl known, this trace is representing the free energy of 
the network. Intuitively, the function, which is represen-
tative for the rate of junction destruction, is approximated 
by: 
H 
(2.5.83) 
where E is a numerical factor and Go is a (shear) modulus 
to be defined below. This modulus is introduced in oraer to 
compensate for the dimension of tr ~* . Less oövious is the 
physical reason for introducing a function with the same 
exponential for nKTg1 , i.e.: 
... (2.5.84) 
Admittedly, the authors made this choice in an effort to 
avoid too high a complexity of the final results.

As a next step, the following replacements are intro-
duced: 
... (2.5.85) 
T o 
... (2.5.86) 
(2.5.87) 
With respect to eq. (2.5.85) the remark is made that 
~ has the same deviatoric components as ~*.

... (2.5.89) 
one obtains instead of eq. (2.5.82):

... (2.5.90) 
where the time derivative d/dt is apparently a modified 
contravariant time derivative, as introduced in eq. 
(2.4.51) and used for example in eq. (1.1.17). In order to 
obtain a set of equations analogous to those representing 
Lodge's model in differential form (see eqs. 2.3.54 and 
2.4.67), one has simply to replace 
TO and Go by a set of 
values Ti and Gi. Before doing so, however, we have to 
show that '0 and Go represent a relaxation time and a shear 
modulus in the sense of linear viscoelasticity. But this 
can easily be seen from eq. (2.5.90). In fact, if IJ is a 
small quantity, the same holds for g. If one expands the 
exponential, one obtains 
1 +(E/GO ) tr g. When multiplied 
315 

by g the term containing the trace of Q is of second order. 
-
T 
The same holds for the terms g.g and g.g . In this way, a 
normal differential equation of the Maxwell type is obtained 
(see Section A.5), for which TO and Go are the above mentioned 
well-known quantities. In this way one arrives at the 
following set of equations: 
(2.5.91 ) 
+ 
(2.5.92) 
where d/dt is given by eqs. (2.5.88) and (2.5.80). 
The quantities Gi and Ti are determined in the usual way 
from linear viscoelastic data, preferentially from cyclic 
measurements, as pointed out in Section A.7. A comparison 
with experimental results, as compiled by Tanner, will be 
shown later. Before this will be done, however, the integral 
version of the theory for "weak" flow will be introduced 
for two reasons, viz for the opportunity to elucidate the 
structure of the theory and for the ease of interpretation 
of some general features. 
2.5.6.2 General Discussion.

A look at the definition of ~, as given in eq. (2.5.80), 
shows that this tensor eoineides with the veloeity gradient 
tensor ~ for 
; = 0 and with the negative vortieity tensor -~ 
for ; = 1. As pointed out in Seetions 2.4.1 and 2.4.2.2, the 
equations (2.5.93) and (2.5.94) ean be eonsidered as diffe-
rential equations for the "strain measures" ~ and ~-1 
with the "initial eonditions" suIltlnarized in eq. (2.5.95). 
For the more general ease of g these equations ean be 
fitted together as: 
a12/ at I 
= 
12 C t ,t') 
gC t ') 
(2.5.96) 
with 
g: (t, t) 
... (2.5.97) 
The pertinent integration for the generalized strain 
measure ~(t, t') was earried out by M.W. Johnson and D. Se-
galman in order to obtain the integral version of the theory 
for "weak" flow (c: = 0). For the purpose, g:(t, t') was in-
serted into the equation 
t

(2.5.98) 
whieh is a straightforward generalization of eqs. (2.4.1) and 
(2.4.61), whieh were postulated or derived for the indieated 
limiting eases*) . 
It seems illustrative to work out eq. (2.5.96) for 
shear flow in eomponents. In order to obtain a more symmetrie 
appearanee of the equations, the parameter a , as used by 
Johnson and Segalman, is introdueed: 
a 
=

E, 
... (2.5.99)

Johnson and Segalman used Q instead of ~ in 
their equation and lost a faetor 2. This presentation, 
however, seems more praetieal for our purpose.

where the substitution dy = y(t') dt' is introduced. These 
equations can easily be integJ;ated by transforming them by 
pairs into second order differential equations, containing 
::mly one component. During this operation one irnrnediately 
recognizes that E12 and E21 obey the same differential equa-
tion reading: 
1-a 2 
= - -4-
E12 
... (2.5.101) 
This does not mean, however, that E12 and E21 must be identical: 
Since eq. (2.5.101) as well as the other pertinent differential 
equations are homogeneous, solutions are obtained by their 
integration except fo~ constant factors, which are determined 
partly by the "initial" condition (2.5.97) and partly by 
the condition that for the limiting cases of a = 1 
(~ = 0) 
-1 
and a = 0 
(~ = 1) the inverse deformation gFadient ~ 
and 
the orthogonal matrix ~must be obtained. All these conditions 
are met by the following solutions:

. .• (2.5.106) 
In the limit of a = 1 (A = 0) 
the equations clearly 
reduce to Lodge's equations, as discussed in Section 2.3.2. 
Interestingly enough, the second normal stress difference is 
predicted to be finite and to show the same time dependence 
as the first normal stress difference. The negative sign in 
eq. (2.5.106) is realistic, as the reader may remember from 
Sections 1.2.3.7 and 2.4.3.31 From the ratio of these normal 
stress differences parameter a(or ~ = 1 -
a) can be deter-
mined. Another way to obtain this parameter is to look up 
the total shear Ym in a stressing experiment, where the 
first and principal maximum (overshoot) occurs in the shear 
stress. For the purpose, y = q can be put in front of the inte-
gral in eq. (2.5.104) whereas the lower limit of the in~egral 
is put equal to zero. Finally, the substitution t-t' = T is 
carried out. In this way one obtains: 
t 
3(T) 
°12(t) = q 
f 
ces ( 2A q T ) dT 
(2.5.107) 
0 
... 
and 
do 12/dt 
= 
q 8(t) ces (2Aqt) = o. 
319 

From this latter equation it follows that the argument of 
the eosine must be equal to n/2. This furnishes: 
a = 
(2. 5 . 1 08) 
where y 
= q t 
is the total shear at this maximum. 
(The 
m 
m 
maxima occurring at higher values of the total shear are not 
very pronounced if a is sufficiently close to unity, as one 
can expect from the well-known fact that (°33-°22)/(°11-°22) «1.) 
According to Johnson and Segalman a value of a = 0,94 is 
reasonable for polymer melts. With such a value for a also the 
non-Newtonian steady shear viscosity of these melts can readily 
be described. 
An interesting point is that this model is in favour 
of the well-known Cox-Merz relation mentioned in Section 1.1.2 
(eq. (1.1.39)). In order to show this, one has to revert to 
the expression for the dynamic oscillatory viscosity n', as 
given by the theory of linear viscoelasticity (see Appendix 
A, eq. (A.41)): 
n'(= G"/w) = .r SeT) COS WTdT 
o 
(2.5.109 ) 
If in eq. (2.5.107) the upper limit of the integral is put 
equal to infinity and 012/q is considered as the non-Newtonian 
viscosity n(q), a comparison of eqs. (2.5.107) and (2.5.109) 
shows that, on a (double) logarithmic plot, the curves n(q) 
and n' (w) must have the same shape. As in the limit of q = 0 
and w = 0 the two viscosities are identical, these curves can 
be made to coincide by a shift along the logarithmic (reci-
procal) time axis. The shift factor log 2 A is -
0,46 for 
a = 0,94. 
This is the right order of magnitude. The Cox-Merz 
rule with 
In*(w)1 =yn'2 + n,,2 = n(q) 
(2.5.110) 
for w 
q is met in reality by the fact that the earlier 
320 

decreasing n' 
is complemented by n". It is difficult to 
show this analytically, but Nhan Phan Thien78 )reports agreement. 
Finally, the behaviour of the model must be investi-
gated for the ca se that the Lodge-Meissner test is carried 
out. In a way completely analogous to the one described in 
Section 2.4.1 for the corotational model, the relaxing 
stresses after a step Yo in the shear strain are obtained. 
One finds: 
(J

sin (y ~)

(2.5.111) 
1 -
cos (y ~) 
= 2 ~(t) 
0 
1-a 2 
(2.5.112) 
The ratio of these quantities is: 
= 
... (2.5.113) 
From these equations one notices that this model has 
some difficulties in meeting the requirements of this test. 
On the other hand, the situation is less serious than with 
the corotational model, where the shear stress starts to 
decrease with increasing y 
at y 
= n/2. Here we find this 
o 
0 
phenomenon at Yo = (n/2) (1/ 1-a2 ) which is, with a = 0,94, 
about a factor three higher at Yo 
~ 4,7. The ratio given by 
eq. (2.5.113) goes to infinity at Yo 
~ 9,4. There is only one 
case, in which such a step shear strain was surpassed, viz. in 
the 
work by H.M. Laun on low density polyethylene(see Fig. 
2.12). Nevertheless, the present model fails in this respect. 
It goes without saying that equations (2.5.111), (2.5.112) 
and (2.5.113) show the correct limiting behaviour for a 
~ 0 
and a ~ 1. 
321 

An interesting survey of the consequences of eq. 
(2.5.111) has recently been given by Tanner 77 ). In Fig.2.23 
the mentioned author compared the prediction of the present 
theory for 
~ = 0,1 (a = 0,9) for t= 0 with experimental re-
sults of various authors. The theoretical prediction of a 
deviation of f = 012(0)/yo 8(0) from the value one, as valid 
for a linear material,lags behind the reality at yo-values 
smaller than about 6,5. At larger values of Yo' however, the 
theoretical result becomes too big and very unrealistic.

2.5.6.3 Some Comments with Respect to the 
Usefulness of the Theory. 
As Tanner pointed out, da ta on various polymer melts 
can be described with 
~ = 0,1 and E = 0,015. The latter para-
322 

meter is of influence only with elongational flow when a steady 
~ 
flow situation is approached. In this case the steady state 
elongational viscosity becomes proportional to 1/E. In contrast 
to the experimental results by Raible, DemarmeIs and Meissner71 ) 
and to the theoretical predictions by wagner72 ) and by 
Acierno et al. 65 ) no overshoot is predicted with the aid of 
the theory by Nhan Phan Thien and Tanner. As this overshoot 
is not very pronounced in the mentioned experiments and also 
in the cited theories, this may be a minor point of disagree-
ment especially in view of practical application, where the 
Nhan Phan Thien - Tanner theory seems particularly useful for 
the description of the spinning experiment77 ) 78). Such a 
description is beyond the 
scope of this monograph in parti-
cular because of the lack of birefringence data. In Fig.2.24, 
however, the usefulness of the theory is demonstrated for the 
tensile flow data of LDPE sampIe A, as published by Meissner81 ) 
and by Laun and Münstedt57 ). 
As the reader may remember, the 
same da ta can also be fitted with the aid of Wagner's and

Acierno's theories. In all cases the same linear viscoelastic 
data were used (cf. Section 1.1.4.1). The differences in the 
theoretical treatment are found in the way in which the non-
linear properties are approximated. A theoretical study should 
be undertaken, which aims at showing the common features of 
these theories. From a practical point of view the theory with 
the lowest degree of numerical effort will be the winner. The 
present author, however, is unable to decide on the latter 
question. How the theory by Tanner and Nhan Phan Thien78 ) fits 
transient shear data, is shown in Fig. 2.25 for the same poly-
rner81 ) at 1500 C and at a shear rate q = 1 s-1. Spurious oscilla-
tions of shear stress as weil as first normal stress difference 
cannot completely be ignored, however.

2.6 A Theary Derived fram a Different Basic Principle 
Many years ago H. Giesekus82 ) published an interesting 
theory which only recently turned out to be related to the 
already mentioned theory by A.I. Leonov79 ). Impressed by the 
usefulness of the latter theory Giesekus resumed his activities 
in this field and succeeded in giving a useful classification 
of previously proposed theories, including Lodge's rubberlike 
liquid mode1 1) and the model by Marrucci, Acierno and cowor-
kers64 )-67)*). For more details, the original papers should be 
consulted. For the present purpose only a quite straightforward 
derivation of Leonov's equations, as based on Giesekus' 
forma-
lism, will be reproduced. As a matter of fact, the purpose of 
this monograph is not so much an account of the development of 
theoretical ideas but rather a presentation of theoretical re-
sults which have proven to be useful for the quantitative de-
scription of experimental results. What seemed to be a diffe-
rent basic principle (see the title of this section) in Leonov's 
own derivation, does not appear to be so dractically at variance 
with principles, previously discussed in this monograph, if the 
ideas of Giesekus are followed. 
2.6.1 Model Considerations 
Giesekus starts his consideration with the assumption 
that the polymer melt contains substructures which retain their 
entity during deformation. Only after the success of the "repta-
tion model" (see Sections 2.4.3.2 and 3.2) Giesekus decided to 
identify these substructures with the polymer molecules them-
selves. If the centre of resistance of such a substructure moves 
with the local speed of the medium, relative movements of the

for his readiness to discuss matters in aseries of letters 
and for providing preprints of two still unpublished papers 
on the subject. (See ref. 42 ) of Chapter 3.) 
325 

elements (beads in a bead-spring ehain model) of this substruc-
ture with respect to the surrounding structural units of the 
fluid must be eneountered. The eorresponding friction forces 
constitute the local stress tensor (stress tensor increment) 
to which the substructure responds by an elastic deformation. 
In the course of this development ensemble averages are formed 
over the substructures. 
The relative motion between an individual bead i and 
its surroundings is given by

(2.6.1) 
where the first term on the right side gives the substantial 
time derivative of Ei' Ei being the loeal veetor of bead i with 
respeet to the centre of resistance, and the subtracted term 
gives the average motion of the medium (in the ca se of a solu-
tion this is the motion of the solvent) in the absence of bead i 
(with L = ~ y). (It ean be shown that Ei(1) is the upper convec-
ted or contravariant time derivative of vector r .• ) The eorres-

(For the role of Ei as oeeurring in the average of this 
dyade see the explanation given after eq. (2.2.5». Now the 
simplifying assumption is made that the tensorial drag 
coefficient does not depend on theactual configuration 
of the moleeules under consideration but depends 
only on the average situation in the surroundings. As a conse-
quence of this assumption the tensor drag coefficient can be

Admittedly, at this stage Giesekus introdueed elasses of beads 
assoeiated with the same eonfiguration tensor. In the eoneept 
of this review, however, it seems preferable to postpone a dis-
eussion of these elasses to a later moment. 
More detailed results are derived for a one-mode model 
(e.g. a simple elastie dumbbell). For such a model (cf.' the mo-
del of Wales in Seet. 2.4.3.7) the always symmetrie eonfiguration 
tensor g is eoaxial with the stress tensor inerement whieh, in 
this ease, must be symmetrie as weIl. In this way the tensors 
beeome eommutable, whieh leads to a further simplifieation 
of the first term of eq. (2.6.6). 
Further, it is eonjeetured that g deseribes the state 
of the system eompletely. As a eonsequenee, the assumption 
ean be made that the exeess stress tensor inerement g and the 
tensorial drag eoeffieient ~ (both without subseript beeause 
of the one mode model) are unique funetions of the eonfigura-
tion tensor g. This eauses the model to be a generalized Max-
well model, g eorresponding to the eonfiguration of the spring 
and ~ eharaeterizing the drag resistanee in the dashpot. As is 
well-known, the elements of the Maxwell model are arranged in 
328 

series. This is a realistie proposition beeause of the validity 
of the linear stress-optieal rule. (A dashpot in parallel with 
aspring, as in the Kelvin-Voigt model, would eause a eontribu-
tion to the stress whieh is not depieted by a ehanged eonfigura-
tion (birefringenee». If the drag eoeffieient is identified 
with a eonfiguration dependent sealar faetor multiplied by the 
·.mit tensor (isotropie drag eoeffieient) and g = G(g - 1) with 
G dependent on the invariants of g, one obtains a elass of mo-
dels, to whieh the model by Marrueei, Aeierno and eoworkers be-
longs. In fact, the mentioned unique funetions ean also be de-
termined by differential equations with respeet to time (cf. 
eq. (2.5.49». One ean easily show that all models with an 
isotropie drag eoeffieient are Weissenberg fluids with vani-
shing seeond normal stress differenee. 
However, if one wishes to eonstruet the most simple 
(one-mode) model with non-vanishing seeond normal stress diffe-
rence, one has to speeify the relations between exeess stress 
tensor and tensorial drag eoeffieient on one side, and the 
eonfiguration tensor on the other side as simple linear re-
lations. Giesekus assumes: 
g = a (g - 1) ,

whieh is the neo-Hookean law, and: 
~ = 1 + a (b - 1)

with 0 .:. a .:. 1. With respeet to the latter equation one should 
remind oneself that g reduees to the unity tensor, if the sub-
struetures assume their equilibrium average eonfigurations 
(eonformations) • 
If eqs. (2.6.7) and (2.6.8) are introdueed in eq. 
(2.6.6) in the ease of only one mode, one obtains:

•.. (2.6.11) 
where the relation 1(1) = -
2 ~ is used. This is the well-known 
upper eonveeted Maxwell fluid (ef. eqs. (1.1.20), (2.3.54) and 
(2.4.67)). For a = 1 a fluid is obtained, whieh shows in its 
results some similarity with the eorotational Maxwell fluid. 
One interesting result is that, as soon as a deviates from 
zero by only a small amount, a finite steady state extensional 
viseosity is obtained at all rates of tensile strain, whereas 
for a being exaetly zero, this viseosity goes to infinity at 
T t 
0,5 and 
T t = -
1 (ef. eq. (1.1.38)) and is finite only 
in the intermediate range. In the limiting eases of infinite 
strain rates the steady state tensile or Trouton viseosity, 
when normalized with respeet to the zero shear viseosity, is 
simply related to parameter a. One finds T(oo) = 2 T(-oo) = 2/a. 
One also has (dT/dTE)e=O = 3(1-a). 
Interestingly enough, for a = 1/2 eq. (2.6.9) furni-
shes the equation, as given by Leonov79 ) for shear flow of a 
one-mode fluid. This means that, aeeording to Leonov, an ani-
sotropie drag eoeffieient, whieh forms the average between the 
unit tensor and the eonfiguration tensor, is adequate for the 
deseription of the rheology of maeromoleeular systems in shear 
flow.*) In this eonneetion the reader may keep in mind for a 
later ehapter (Seet. 3.3.4) that a = 1/2 eorresponds to the 
ease of a "link tension eoeffieient" equal to z,ero in the 
Curtiss-Bird model as long as g does not deviate too mueh 
from the unit tensor. 
*)

Footnote: At zero shear rate one finds (N2/N 1)o = -
1/4, if 
a = 1/2. This is not very realistie, but also not too im-
portant for the praetieal applieations of Chapt. 4. 

An interesting feature of the theory, as put forward 
by Giesekus, is the "relative configurational volume". As is 
well-known, for the case of the constant volume condition the 
determinant of the macroscopic Finger tensor, which represents 
the relative volume of the system with respect to its equilibri-
um value, remains equal to one under all circumstances. Accor-
ding to Giesekus, however, this cannot be assumed apriori for 
the configuration tensor ~. Accidentally, however, for shear 
flow and a = 1/2 Giesekus finds that det ~ = 1 is valid indepen-
dent of the shear rate. In this way, Leonov's intuitive postulate 
is justified for shear flow. On the other hand, the claim that 
his theory does not contain any adjustable parameter, cannot be 
maintained. In fact, in particular for tensile flow a parameter 
a 4 1/2 may appear to be more suitable in many cases, as a deter-
mines the height of the steady state tensile viscosity which 
seems to depend on the type of polymer and not only on the 
relaxation time spectrum. Admittedly, more experiments and 
in particular for negative E-values (biaxial extension) will 
be needed in this respect (T(oo) 
> 3g 
> T(-oo) for a = 1/2). 
Before at the end of this section a short description 
of Leonov's own approach will be tried, one important generali-
zation will be discussed. This generalization is formed by the 
introduction of a multi-mode system, in which the excess stress 
tensor increments of the introduced modes are simply added. 
Without argument Leonov introduces the assumption that the 
relative mobility tensors ~i are uncoupled in such a multi-mode 
system. Giesekus initially hesitated to construct arguments in 
favour of such an uncoupling. However, presently he believes 
that a favourable argument is furnished by the tube model of 
Doi and Edwards 19 ). In fact, the me an field confining the 
movement of a single chain moleeule in this model; does not 
depend on conformations and molar masses of neighbouring mole-
cules, at least as long as all moleeules of the system have mo-
lar masses larger than a certain critical value (M 
or M , Sects. 
e 
c 
1.1.4.1 and 1.1.4.4). In this sense Giesekus seems to identify 
his classes of "statistical continua", each with a common 
(and independent) configuration tensor ~k' with fractions, 
331 

each with a different molar mass. As a matter of fact, it 
will turn out in Chapter 3 
that the melt of a polymer with a 
sharp molar mass very much behaves like a single Maxwell element, 
when linear viscoelastic properties in the fluid range - at suffi-
ciently low frequencies - are considered. This means that subclas-
ses, as formed by higher normal modes of motion of the same type 
of molecule are of minor importance (T2 = T1/9, 
G2 = G1/9 accor-
ding to Doi). *) 
In the eyes of the present author these considerations 
make the multi-mode system of Leonov acceptable. For a further 
evaluation of the shear flow propertiesof this model eq. (2.6.9) 
is rewritten in terms of its tensor components with a = 1/2. Of 
the terms [~~ • gl and [go (~~)Tl, which are contained in g(1)' 
only the following components are different from zero (cf. eq. 
(1.1.26), Section 1.1.2): 
[(~ ~) 
!?J ll = [g 
(_'V _v)T J 11 
(_'V_v)T] 21 
(2.6.12 ) 
With these expressions one obtains the following three differen-
tial equations for the components of gk (where the dots stand 
for the substantial time derivatives which are identical with 
ordinary time derivatives in homogeneous flow situations encoun-
tered here):

Footnote: Preliminary experiments of the group of the present 
author, which were obtained after completion of Chapter 3, 
clearly show the correctness of this view. 

With the proper initial conditions (e.g. bk,ij = 0ij) 
these equations furnish the time-dependent values of the matrix 
coefficients: 
(bk .. ) 
, ~J 
••• (2.6.14) 
for any given function y(t). 
In the derivation of the three equations (2.6.13) the 
constant volume condition was used implicitely. This condi-
tion is expressed by I 3k = det (bk,ij) = 1. For the matrix 
given by eq. (2.6.14) this condition reads: 
b~ 12 
= 1 
, 
•.• (2.6.15) 
The consistency of this extra equation with the equations 
(2.6.13) can easily be checked. For the purpose, eq. 
(2.6.15) is differentiated with respect to time. For the 
time derivatives of bk ,11' bk ,22 and bk ,12' that occur in 
this differentiated equation, the values from eqs. (2.6.13) 
are inserted. This leads directly to an identity in y. In 
this way the question about the consistency is positively 
answered, which means that one of the differential equations 
can be replaced by the algebraic eq. (2.6.15). Leonov chose 
to omit the third differential equation (2.6.13). In one 
paper85 ) 
he even substituted for bk ,22 in the second differen-
tial equation, using eq. (2.6.15). So, finally, only two 
simultaneous differential equations for bk ,11 and.bk ,12 have 
to be solved. 
Before closing this section one should mention that 
Leonov86 ) also used the Mooney-Rivlin strain energy function 
and even Tschoegl's n-measure of strain in eq. (2.6.7). How-
ever, very recently R.K. Upadhyay, A.I. Isayevand S.F. Shen87 ) 
have shown that the Leonov theory in its simplest form, as re-
333 

viewed in the present section, has led for shear flows to very 
satisfactory results. This will be discussed in the next section. 
As announced in this section at an earlier occasion, a 
short sketch of Leonov's own approach will be tried, before this 
section will be closed. Leonov starts from the continuum mechani-
cal result that the contravariant time derivative (see eq. 
(2.4.51)) of the Finger tensor is equal to zero for a medium of 
homogeneous connectivity*). He decomposes the velocity gradient 
~ into a reversible ("elastic") part ~(e) and an irreversible 
("plastic") part ~(p). (Formulation suggested by Giesekus in his 
latest paper.) With this decomposition one obtains for the volume 
element (substructure) in the case of only one mode: 
T 
+ g . ~ (p)) 
.•• (2.6.16) 
Since the first and second term on the right side of this equa-
tion form together the contravariant time derivative of the 
Finger tensor of the substructure (volume element in Leonov's 
notation), which is considered to posses the desired homogene-
ous connectivity, these two terms vanish together according to 
*) Footnote: The definition of the Finger tensor, as given by 
eq. (2.1.2) and used in this book so far, corresponds to the 
relation (ds,)2 = d ~ . ~ • d ~, where d s' and d s are sur-
face elements on a sectional plane at times t' and t, with 
t' characterizing the variable past time and t the fixed 
(present or reference) time. 20) The Finger tensor, however, 
as used by Leonov is defined as ~ = E.ET and corresponds 
334 
to (d s)2 = d~' • ~ • d ~'. USi~g e~.-(2.4.55) together 
with its transposed version one easily arrives at 
~(1) = 0 for this latter definition of ~. (Note that 
Cl(d s)2/ Clt , :: 0.) In fact, with Lodge the undeformed state 
of a rubber is at past time t'. With Leonov, however, the 
undeformed state is at the reference time t. (See foot-
note at eq. (2.1.7).)

eq. (2.6.16) beeomes:

•.• (2.6.17) 
In a lengthy proeedure, in whieh it is argued that ft(p) must be 
symmetrie and, therefore, identieal with the "plastie" defor-
mation gradient ~(p)' and that the eomponents of ~(p) are obtai-
nable from speeially symmetrized Onsager relations with the 
eomponents of ~ from eq. (2.6.7) as the only thermodynamie for-
ees, Leonov finally arrives (for shear flow) at eqs. (2.6.13). 
It should be mentioned that P.A. Dashner and W.E.Van Arsdale83 ) 
quite reeently gave an extensive diseussion of the eontinuum 
meehanieal eoneept used by Leonov. 
2.6.2 Discussion of Results 
2.6.2.1 Steady State and Relaxation. 
In its simplest form the Leonov theory 
just deseri-
bed furnishes the following expression for the maeroseopie 
stress tensor: 
N 
~ + P 1-
..• (2.6.18) 
where the tensors ~k are solutions of the eqs. (2.6.13). 
In eontrast to eq. (2.6.7) an extra Newtonian term eon-
taining the zero shear viseosity n 
is introdueed (ef. eq. 
o 
1.1.1 in Seetion 1.1.2). The parameter s ean vary. between zero 
and one. This extra term is introdueed for praetieal reasons, 
in order to keep the number N of effeetive modes, whieh have 
to be found from the linear viseoelastie behaviour, as small 
as possible. One ean also say that the first term on the 
right side of eq. (2.6.18) represents the influenee of all 
those modes whieh have suffieiently small relaxation times 
to aequire a steady state within the time seale of the ex-
335 

periment. The parameters no ' sand nk

A very attractive feature of this theory is that 
steady state values of the components of the tensors gk 
can be calculated in closed form. If in the eqs. (2.6.13) 
the time derivatives are put equal to zero, one obtains by 
rearrangement:

No closed-form solutions are available, however, for 
the build-up of stresses in the stressing experiment with 
337 

y = 0 for t 
~ 0 and y = q = const. for t 
> O. Only recently, 
however, results of numerical calculations became available 
(see ref. 87». These results are shown in Fig. 2.26. In the 
dimensionless plots the subscript k for bk ., and 'k is omitted, 
, ~J 
since these graphs are valid for all modes. For values of the 
parameter r = q , larger than unity the asymptotic values given 
in eqs. (2.6.22) are reached at some t/, < 2. Before these 
asymptotic values are reached (for parameter r 
> 1), various 
degrees of overshoot are observed. In all those cases the over-
shoot in b 12 occurs at an earlier time and is more pronounced 
than that in b 11 -b22 , if curves for the same parameter rare 
compared. This is in agreement with experience (cf. Section 
3.3.3). No spurious oscillations are observed.

If eqs. (2.6.13) are solved for the initial situ-
ation of the stressing experiment by insertion of apower

spectively, one can easily see that during stress relaxation 
the ratio of bk ,11 -
bk ,22 and bk ,12 remains constant and 
equal to Yo' But this is the requirement for the mentioned 
test. Only relaxation processes with relaxation times shorter 
than 6t will disturb this test. At times considerably longer 
than 6t, however, this disturbance will not be noticeable. 
This is the usual situation with this test. A glance at 
Fig.2.26 teaches us that deviations from the linear and 
quadratic courses of b 12 and b 11 -b22 , respectively, occur 
at increasing values of y 
= rt/T, when r = qT 
is enhanced. 
o 
For r = 1000 the critical value of Yo is of the order of ten 
with time necessary for attainment of this value being suffi-
-2 
ciently small (t/T 
~ 10 
s). The conclusion drawn by Upadhyay, 
339 

Isayev and Shen87 ) is that the Leonov model agrees with the 
Lodge-Meissner test. 
2.6.2.2 Recovery. 
When applying this model in the single relaxation mode 
formulation to the constrained shear recovery, Leonov et al. 85 ) 
found that the agreement with experiment was not satisfactory. 
Upadhyay, Isayev and Shen pointed out, however, that the shear 
recovery can be predicted correctly if a larger number of modes 
is incorporated, as will be shown in the following. 
According to eq. (2.6.18) the time dependent shear 
stress in unidirectional shear flow is given by: 
N 
s y(t) + 
L 
Gk b k 12(t) 
k=l 
' 
(2.6.27) 
If at t 
> 0 the shear stress 012(t) is put equal to 
zero, for the shear rate y(t) occurring during the subsequent 
recovery an expression in terms of the functions bk ,12(t) 
is obtained. Substituting y(t) in eqs. (2.6.13) by this 
expression one obtains the following set of equations for 
3N unknown functions: 
N

(2.6.28) 
If the shear flow has been steady for t 
~ 0, the 
proper initial conditions are given by eqs. (2.6.20). 
340 
= 0 

Otherwise initial values of the tensor components bk ., 
,1) 
have to be determined numerically for the preceding stress 
build-up. 
The recovery y(t) as a function the time t that has 
elapsed since the moment at which the shear stress is released, 
follows then from the equation: 
t 
y(t) = J y 
(~)d ~ 
o 
.•. (2.6.29) 
Equations (2.6.28) were integrated by Upadhyay, 
Isayev and Shen with the aid of a fourth-order Runge-Kutta 
procedure with variable time step, until the strain rate 
became essentially zero. The ultimate recovery follows from 
eq. (2.6.29) with t = ~ 
By examining eqs. (2.6.28) one learns that this method 
works by virtue of the fact that the relaxation mechanisms with 
the longest relaxation times govern the process of recovery as 
is well-known from experiments (cf. Sections 1.1.4.3 as well 
as Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2). In fact, if too many processes with 
lower relaxation times must be incorporated in the calculation, 
the free parameter s becomes so small that the second term of 
the first two eqs. (2.6.28) becomes the ratio of two very small 
quantities. This is consistent with the experience of the above 
mentioned authors who found that the time step for integration 
should not exceed the smallest time constant nos/Gk for numerical 
stability. 
2.6.2.3 Evaluation of Model Parameters. 
Finally some words should be said with respect to 
the method of evaluation of the model parameters. As has 
been customary hitherto, the parameters Gk and 'k can be evalu-
ated from dynamic mechanical measurements, as described in 
341 

Appendix A (Section A.7, eq. (A.98». The usual equation for 
G" (see eq. (A.61» 
has been modified by Leonov et al. 85) in 
order to find a value for s. One has:

An alternative possibility, which does not exist 
for the other theories described so far, is furnished by 
the Leonov-theory expressions for the non-Newtonian steady 
state shear viscosity and the first normal stress difference. 
From eqs. (2.6.18) and (2.6.20) one obtains:

For eqs. (2.6.30) and (2.6.31) least square schemes were 
developed by the mentioned authors 87 )in order to obtain the 
parameter values which give the best fit with 'the respective 
experimental curves (cf. the method by Laun and Münstedt). 
As will be shown in the next section, very good predictions 
of transient properties can be obtained with the aid of the 
second method of evaluation as based on eqs. (2.6.31). This is 
very advantageous, if dynamic mechanical measurements do not 
exist. However, it shows above all that Leonov's relationp for 
non-Newtonian flow must be very realistic. 
342 

2.6.3 Comparison with Experiment 
In the present context only a small selection can 
be given. Those readers, who are interested in more details, 
are referred to the original papar by Upadhyay, Isayev and 
Shen87 ). The principles, according to which the present selection 
has been carried out, are twofold. On one hand flow birefrin-
gence results are preferred in connection with the topic of 
this monograph. On the other hand, the extraordinary use-
fulness of the evaluation method based on eqs. (2.6.31) should 
be demonstrated. 
Both principles are satisfied by the data of K. Osaki, 
N. Bessho, T. Kojimoto and M. Kurata88 ) 
on an 8% solution 
of anionic polystyrene (M = 3,0 . 106 ) in Aroclor 1248. The va-
w 
lue used for the stress-optical coefficient was C = 5,9.10-9pa- 1 
(As is well-known, this value depends on the solvent used.) 
In Fig. 2.27 the adaptation of the theoretical curves, 
as given by the eqs. (2.6.31), to the experimental points 
for non-Newtonian shear viscosity and first normal stress is 
demonstrated. The curves indicated by number 1 belong to the 
above mentioned solution. In Fig. 2.28 bUild-up and relaxation 
of birefringence and extinction angle are shown for several 
shear rates indicated near the curves. The full lines are 
calculated according to Leonov's theory. For the purpose, use 
is made of the parameters evaluated according to the 
previous figure. The 
(at the beginning of 
value of s. (Cf. the 
presentation of eqs. 
small steps in the curves at t 
0 
the relaxation) are due to the finite 
remarks made at the occasion of th~ 
(2.6.18) and (2.6.19).) In Fig. 2.29 
the relaxation of the birefringence after step strain y , as 
o 
indicated in the graph, is shown. This figure shows that also 
for the Lodge-Meissner test the fit of the experimental curves 
by the calculated curves is very satisfying. 
In this context it should be reported that the flow 
birefringence experiments by Gortemaker et al. 23 ) (stressing

theory (see the original paper). In particular it should be 
mentioned that the fit of the curves in Fig. 1.73 is excellent.

curves coincide very well with the experimental points. In 
addition transient recoveries are successfully calculated for 
Meissner's results 90 ) on LPDE Melt I, but only on the basis of 
dynamic mechanical data.

any adjustable parameter. Interestingly enough, in order to ob-
tain reasonable predictions a smaller number of linear modes

Tk is needed than in other theories proposed so far. 
This makes the theory by Leonov particularly suitable for the 
treatment of industrial problems. This has recently been 
demonstrated by the calculation of birefringence patterns in 
injection moulded parts of amorphous polymers by A.I. Isayev 
and C.A. Hieber93 ) and by Isayev, Hieber and D. crouthame1 94 ).

3 Prospects for Predictions on a Molecular Basis 
3.1 Generallntroduction 
It goes almost without saying that there is a great inter-
est in any quantitative interrelation between molecular para-
meters like chain stiffness or molecular mass distribution on 
one hand and rheological properties under varying conditions 
on the other hand. This interest is certainly not particularly 
characteristic for fundamentalists, it is shared by a great 
number of industrialists. A modern trend goes in the direction 
of producing polymer grades, the so-called tailored resins, for 
very specific purposes. In this connection manufacturers want 
to know how a molecular mass distribution has to be fashioned 
in order to realize a certain specific rheological effect 
such as strain hardening during extension. Even with gene-
ral purpose grades questions can arise, which must be solved 
in terms of more or less pronounced adaptations in the chemi-
cal structure of the polymer. In particular, insufficiently 
defined long chain branching has been discussed as a source of 
variations in processing performance. 
So far, however, our knowledge in this field has been 
highly empirical and very fragmentary. Well-known examples 
are the famous dependence of the zero-shear viscosity an the 
3,4-th power of the molecular mass 1), the occurrence of a 
critical molecular mass M , below which the zero shear viscosi-
c 
1) 
ty depends only on the first power of the molecular mass 
(cf. Section 1.1.4.4), the independence on the molecular mass 
of the equilibrium shear compliance 2) (Section 1.2.3.3) and of 
the height of the rubber plateau (in the storage modulus, 
Section 1.1.4.1). 3) More vaguely, one knows that a polymer with 
a broad molecular mass distribution shows "easy flowing", in 
355 

connection with pronounced non-Newtonian behaviour, whereas 
a polymer with a narrow distribution shows a relatively in-
variable viscosity up to the point where extrusion defects 
occur. 4 ) A long tail in the molecular mass distribution at 
high molecular masses is judged to be responsible for the 
elastic properties of the melt. Reliable quantitative rela-
tions between the molecular mass distribution and the men-
tioned (and other) rheological properties have hardly been 
given. This is one of the main reasons why rheologists 
preferred to rely on cyclic dynamic measurements (of storage 
and loss moduli as functions of circular frequency) for the 
characterization of their sampies rather than on the results 
of gel permeation chromatography, in spite of the great ad-
vance made in this analytical technique during recent years. 
This apparent inability to make quantitative use of the data 
provided by the chemists has become agonizing. 
In several efforts to accomplish a break-through, two 
paths have been followed in the paste Tractable, but rather 
contradictory results were obtained by a generalization of 
the theory for dilute polymer solution. In order to obtain 
the mentioned dependence of the zero shear viscosity on the 
3,4-th power of the molecular mass, the molecular friction 
factor of the monomeric unit (or of the Rouse segment, see 
later) was arbitrarily modified. 5 ) The most apparent failure 
of this theory was its inability to explain a molecular mass 
independent equilibrium shear compliance. Much more realistic 
was the introduction of the concept of the entanglement 
network, the spacing of this network being related to the 
critical molecular mass M of the zero shear viscosity and 
c 
3) 
to the height of the mentioned rubber-plateau. 
For more com-
plicated flow situations, however, great diffic'ulties have 
been encountered because of the failure to predict a realistic 
relaxation time spectrum, on which constitutive equations 
are based in a fundamental way. A great number of very detailed 
considerations of entanglement situations became obsolete at 
the very moment that a simple and sound basic idea was born 
in the reptation model, as put forward by P.G. de Gennes6 ) in 
the early 1970's. This model has been mentioned before 
356 

in this monograph in connection with the mathematical structure 
of the independent alignment model and the role of the damping 
function. The repercussions of the reptation model on the 
progress of the molecular theory will be treated in the following 
sections, where also its relationship to the entanglement con-
cept will be discussed on several occasions. First, a unified 
treatment of the matter, as recently published by M. DOi,7) 
will be reproduced. 
3.2 Relaxation Processes in a Polymer Melt 
3.2.1 Description of the Model 
As mentioned already in previous sections (Sections 2.4.3.1 
and 2.4.3.2), a mean field theory has been proposed, by which 
the problems can be solved in terms of the behaviour of a 
single chain molecule as in dilute solution theory. This is 
a tremendous advantage by which complicated and sometimes 
questionable details of individual interactions of chain mole-
cules can be avoided. As De Gennes pointed out, the lateral 
movement of a chain molecule is seriously hampered by the 
presence of the other chain molecules. The fate of an indivi-
dual chain molecule in a polymer melt can be compared (in a 
two-dimensional picture) with that of a snake{a reptile -
"reptation") in an undergrowth of quickly growing and rotting bam-
boo shoots. As the bamboos possess some flexibility, the lateral 
movement of the body of the snake is not completely tied down. 
This does not mean, however, that the snake can turn its head 
back to the tail. A complete change of its momentary "confor-
mation" can only be achieved by a longitudinal movement during 
wh ich the head can choose its way through the undergrowth in an 
arbitrary manner. Only after a displacement over the whole 
length of the body the orientation and the location of this 
body reminds us nowhere of the previous situation. In this 
picture the interaction with the surroundings has the static 
character typical of the mean field approach which is also 
357 

justified in the chosen two-dimensional picture. This becomes 
obvious for a snake which is pinned down at one point: If one 
of the bamboo shoots has decayed, meanwhile another young shoot 
has grown nearby. Since bamboo shoots do not 
grow or decay 
simultaneously, the cage around the snake remains of unchanged 
effectiveness. From this picture we learn that the finite mo-
bility of neighbouring chain molecules (symbolized here by 
growth and decay of bamboo shoots has, on the average, no 
influence on the shape of the cage (or "tube") in which the 
individual chain molecule is confined. This shape is genera-
ted during the mentioned longitudinal movement (diffusion) 
of the moleeule, during which only the chain ends can choose 
arbitrary directions. The tube immediately "dies" where the 
moleeule has left it. One may directly extrapolate that mole-
cules showing long chain branches will behave in a more com-
plicated way, since side branches cannot be expected to remain 
in a more or less perpendicular position to the main chain, 
when this main chain diffuses along its "tube". One can also 
imagine that more lateral freedom of movement is achieved, if 
the melt contains shorter chain moleeules which can probably 
be symbolized by fastergrowing and earlier decaying bamboo 
shoots. If with those bamboos their average height decreases, 
the snake may also be able to press them down in a lateral 
escape. 
Notwithstanding the fact that this model gives an 
appealingly simple picture of the situation 'in polymer melts, 
further serious simplifications seem to be necessary in order 
to arrive at tractable mathematical formulations. A description 
of the model, as finally used by Doi and Edwards 8 ) , will be 
tried he re first. It has been called the "slip-link network 
model" by the authors. An individual chain moleeule is thought 
to pass through "slip-links" which are spaced at equal distances 
a from each other as shown in Fig. 3.1. 
If the places where 
the slip-links are assumed in equilibrium, are interconnected 
by straight lines, one obtains a random flight with a step 
length a. This random flight chain has been called the 
primitive chain by the authors when they cast their ideas 
in terms of the tube model (cf. Section 2.4.3.2). The real 
358 

Fig. 3.1: 
In the slip-link model a hypothetical tensile 
force Feq (see eq. (3.2.2)) is necessary to 
keep the polymer trapped by the slip-links (a). 
Otherwise the distance between monomers in the 
polymer chain can shrink temporar.ily. In this 
way disengagement, as sketched in part (b) of the 
figure, will occur. (The figure is taken from 
ref. 8)). (Courtesy of the Chemical Society.) 
chain molecule possesses a considerably larger contour lenght 
than the primitive chain. For the latter chain the contour 
length L is given by 
L 
a N 
.•. (3.2.1) 
where N + 1 is the number of slip-links on one chain molecule. 
As the name teIls us, the polymer chain is al~owed to slide 
without additional resistance through the loops formed by the 
slip-links.*) As a consequence of this assumption, however, the 
chain molecule would rather quickly disentangle from the slip-
links, as shown in the right part of the figure, where ~he tube 
potential is symbolized by two dashed lines. The ·authors have 
shown that the action of the tube potential can adequately be 
taken over by what they called "Maxwell demons". These Max-
well demons, placed on both ends of the chain molecule, serve 
*) Footnote: In other words, the friction factor of an arbitrary 
monomeric unit is assumed to be independent of the momentary 
location of this unit with respect to that of the slip-link. 
359 

to supply a fictitious tension along the links of the primitive 
chain, which prevents the molecule from a disengagement alien 
to the model. This tension is produced by the force Feq 
F eq 
3 kT/a 
(3.2.2) 
This force 
is derived from the elementary theory of the 
statistical mechanics of chain molecules. According to this 
theory the force, which is needed to keep the end-points of a 
chain molecule (containing n monomers of length b) at a 
distance 
~ from each other, is given by 
F 
(3.2.3) 
In the above described case one has n b 2 = 
2 
a , since the 
primitive chain has so far been considered in the equilibrium 
situation, and 
~ = a, so that eq. (3.2.2) immediately follows 
from eq. (3.2.3). 
If now the macroscopic body is deformed by external 
stresses, the slip-links are assumed to follow the macrosco-
pic deformation affinely. This differs from Kuhn's original 
model only in the nature of the cross-links. 
3.2.2 Various Phase of Relaxation 
After a sudden deformation of the body not only the 
distance vectors between the slip-links have become un-
equally oriented and 
of varying length: The system has 
clearly departed from equilibrium in all details. According 
to Doi the process of the return to equilibrium can be sub-
divided into three separate phases, if the chain molecules 
are sufficiently 10ng. 7 ) The first phase can be described con-
veniently if the assumption is made that 
every monomeric 
unit of the chain molecule is initially displaced affinely. 
This can only be assumed, if the well-known Rouse model is 
accepted, according to which the monomeric units are modelled 
360 

as very small beads connected by Gaussian springs instead of 
by rigid valence bonds of discrete directions. 9 ) For the present 
purpose this simplification is of no importance, as the first 
relaxation process is, anyhow, a very fast process which cannot 
easily be followed by rheological methods. Apparently it has 
been included by Doi only for completeness. One can safely 
assume that there will not be left any measurable time lag 
between stress and birefringence if the completion of this 
first process takes such a short time. As mentioned before 
this practically perfect synchronism is one of the prerequisi-
tes for the validity of the linear stress-optical rule. 
Explicitly, the three phases of the relaxation process 
canbe described as foliows. First the equilibrium is restored 
in the chain segments between successive slip-links. This is 
the first mentioned phase (phase A). As will be shown below, 
this process takes a time which is very small compared with 
the times needed for the second and third processes. As a 
consequence, the polymer molecule does not have the opportunity 
to slip through the slip-links during phase A. In fact, in 
such a slip the whole chain molecule has to cooperate. This 
cooperation is described in the second phase (phase B). At 
the end of this phase the contour length of the primitive 
chain has regained its equilibrium length L, as given by 
eq. (3.2.1). As will be seen, this second phase is of no 
importance for a description of linear viscoelasticity, since 
the contour length of the primitive chain is not sufficiently 
altered by a small deformation. Anyhow, at the end of this 
second process, which is of importance after large deforma-
tions, those slip-links, which survived the second process, 
are still in the configuration produced by the initial step of 
deformation. As slip-links only "die" if they are abandoned 
by the chain molecule, these old slip-links can disappear 
only during the total disengagement of the chain molecule by 
longitudinal diffusion '(i.e. "reptation"). 
This is the 
slowest third process (phase C) • 
For a closer description of these three phases relative-
ly simple approximate methods have been used by Doi.

3.2.2.1 The Ultra-Fast Phase A of Stress Relaxation. 
This first process is described in terms of the mathe-
matics known from the Rouse theory. The only difference is that 
in the original Rouse theory the chain ends are assumed to 
be free, whereas they are assumed to be fixed at the 
adjacent slip-links in the present case. The number Ne of 
monomeric units (or more honestly, of beads according to 
the Rouse model) contained in one chain segment between 
two slip-links, is equal to: 
... (3.2.4) 
where No is the degree of polymerization of the whole chain 
molecule and N is defined in connection with eq. (3.2.1).

In these equations the superscript zero (between

tion of the deformation. This deformation is characterized by 
the tensor E defined in eq. (2.1.3), whereas the normal coor-
dinates are given by the vectors x (t).

term on the right expresses in differential form that bead n 
has two neighbours (bead n-1 and bead n+1), which are 
connected to bead n by Gaussian springs of equal spring 
constants 3 kT /b2 . (Cf. eq. (3.2.3), where for the Rouse 
model nb2 has to be replaced by b 2 with b being the "bond 
length".) The second term on the right is a stochastic force 
for which one assumes that: (fn (t) 
= O. Inserting eq. 
(3.2.5) into eq. (3.2.8) one obtains, after observing the 
fact that the sine-functions are orthogonal:

mode with 
A p being the reciprocal relaxation time of this 
mode and f (t) is a suitable stochastic force. 
-p 
As is well-known, for every normal mode ther~. is a sepa-
rate contribution to the stress tensor, which relaxes with a 
relaxation time of half the magnitude of that of the perti-
nent mode. 10) As a consequence, the relaxation time spectrum 
of phase A reads: 
... (3.2.11) 
363 

and 
••• (3.2.12) 
As the stochastic force contributes only to the isotropie 
part of the stress, which is absorbed by the hydrostatic 
pressure, we have no reason to discuss it in this connection. 
Equations (3.2.11) and (3.2.12) are identical with those 
originally obtained by Rouse, if Ne is replaced by No. 
However, Ne is considered to be independent of the molecular 
mass of the investigated polymer sampie. 
3.2.2.2 Equations for the Stress Tensor. 
For a description of the second or "equilibration" 
phase (phase B) an appropriate expression for the stress 
tensor is needed first. At a time t larger than

following expression for the components of the stress tensor

(3.2.13) 
In this equation we find a number of new symbols. 
It is hard to explain some of them briefly. After their 
successful explanation, however, the origin of eq. (3.2.13) 
is easily traced back. To start with, c is the number of 
chain moleeules (of equal length) contained in the unit of 
volume. According to the single chain approximation chosen, 
the stress is proportional to this number. The meaning of 
<R.n(t)iS more complicated. The angular brackets indicate 
an average over all monomeric units contained in a certain 
chain segment, as located between two adjacent slip-links 
"k" and "k+1" (0 .::. k .::. N). In the relaxation after a step 
strain at t = 0 the positions of these slip-links, which 
remain further unchanged, can be characterized by ~ = En 
364 

with n = kN 
and by R.

with m = (k+1)N , where 
e 
~k+

En 
En(t=O) are the initial position vectors of the re-
spective monomeric units. The quantity 
l (t) is defined by: 
n 
.•• (3.2.14) 
It is the projection of the n-th monomeric unit on the 
direction of the primitive chain, which is a straight line 
between the mentioned slip-links. (Clearly, the primitive 
chain concept is only conceivable after completion of the 
first phase of relaxation.) In eq. (3.2.14) the variable sn 
gives the contour length of the primitive chain from the 
end-point of the chain molecule at n=O up to the n-th mono-
meric unit. (After completion of the second phase of relaxa-
tion, i.e. after "equilibration", one has 
sN 
= L.) 
o 
From this consideration it becomes clear why initially 
(Le. at t = T:~ the average (ln(t) 
is basically varying 
from chain segment to chain segment: The distances between 
slip-links become unequal by the initial deformation, as 
mentioned already at the onset of Section 3.2.2. Only after 
completion of the relaxation according to the second or 
equilibration phase B, all values of «ln(t) 
are equal to 
an equilibrium value I . However, since the distances 
between the slip links do not change during the relaxation 
experiment, number and identity of monomeric un~ts have to 
change during phase B for every trajectory between adjacent 
slip links. 
The next quantity to be explained in eq. (3.2.13) 
is the vector v (t). It is the unit tangential vector to 
-n 
the primitive chain at the position of the n-th monomeric 
unit. It is equal for all monomeric units contained in the 
same trajectory between adjacent slip-links. Vector v (t) 
-n 
can conveniently be defined by the equation: 
l(t)v(t) 
TI 
-TI 
(3.2.15) 
365 

where R(s ; t) describes the course of the primitive chain in 
-
n 
space. One has ~(sn; TA) = ~ with n = kNe at the very be-
ginning of phase B. 
At this stage eq. (3.2.13) can, at least for t 
~ TA' 
easily be recognized as a well-known equation from the 
theory of rubber elasticity. In fact, at t = TA the interval 
of integration can be split into N equal intervals in n, i.e. 
o 2. n 2. Ne' Ne 2. n 2. 2Ne , •.• (N-1)Ne 2. n 2. NNe(=No ). In 
every interval the integrand has a constant value which can 
be put in front of the integral. One obtains for instance

"equilibration" phase B whereas a considerable change of 
(vna(t) Vnß(t) 
is only observed during "disengagement" 
phase C. Useful "initial" values (viz at t

The relation 
N = N 
g:2/ b 2 , 
o 
(3.2.24) 
as used in eq. (3.2.23), is explained by the following 
consideration: 
The Langevin equation for the contour length sn 
is very similar to that of the position vectors En of the Rouse 
*) Footnote: In the undeformed state of the fluid a vector 
368 
~n (0) (with kNe 2 n 2 (k+1)Ne ) represents the average of 
the directions of all monomeric units contained in the 
respective chain segment. (This situation is comparable 
with the one in the deformed chain segment after completion 
of relaxation phase A.) This means that vector v (0) also 
-n 
represents the direction of the respective chain segment 
itself. This direction is given with respect to the reference 
coordinate system, in which the step strain at t = 0 is de-
scribed. As a consequence eq. (3.2.19), which has been intro-
duced as the independent alignment approximation for the mono-
meric units, is actually a thoroughly correct relation between 
the averages of the direction vectors of these units, when 
considered be fore and shortly after the application of the 
step strain (at t 
~ TA). 
This reasoning may help to make clear why the angular 
brackets of -
say - eq. (3.2.16), which indicate an averaging 
within the chain segment, have a meaning quite different from 
that of the angular brackets in eqs. (3.2.20) and (3.2.21). 
In fact, the latter brackets indicate an averaging over all 
available chain segments, the unit vector ~ being representati-
ve for the originally uniform distribution of their directions. 
In other words, eqs. (3.2.20) and (3.2.21) give the average 
expectations per chain segment. They seem to be the consequence 
of preaveraging. It is to be hoped that in another footnote at 
the end of Section 3.3.1 more light can be thrown on this 
question. 

chain, as given by eq. (3.2.8). According to the concept of the 
primitive chain 
and to the nature of the slip-links, which do 
not contribute to the friction factor S, it reduces to a scalar 
onedimensional equation given by: 
•.. (3.2.25) 
As a consequence of the mentioned Maxwell demons acting at 
the chain ends, one has the boundary condition: 
(3 kT/b 2 ) (as fan) = F

... (3.2.27) 
The second part of this equation follows from the reasoning 
that the equilibrium condition always holds at the free ends. 
In fact, if the whole chain is in equilibrium, one has 
a (sn> /at = O. With (fn(t) 
= 0 eq. (3.2.25) can easily be 
integrated. The first step of integration furnishes:

3.2.2.3 The Second or "EquilibratiOl"! .. ::_Phase (Phase B) 
of the Stress Relaxation. 
As mentioned above, the assumption is made that in 
this second phase <~n(t»2 relaxes, whereas (v a(t) vnß(t) 
departs from its initial (n-independent) value<V'nav'nß> 
(see eq. (3.2.21)) only during phase C. The correctness of 
this assumption is verified afterwards by the comparison 
of the obtained leading relaxation times. The Langevin 
equation for <~n(t» 
reads: 
'" 
(3.2.30) 
which can easily be verified by a combination of eqs. (3.2.14) 
and (3.2.25). The boundary condition at n = 0 and at n = No 
is in agreement with eq. (3.2.27), viz 
The initial value of <~n(t» 
is given by eq. (3.2.20).

(3.2.13) and (3.2.21) for the relaxing stresses:

concept of the modulus for non-linear conditions. (A similar 
step was taken in the past, when the concept of viscosity was 
extended to the non-Newtonian viscosity.) 
3.2.2.4 The Third or "Disengagement" Phase (Phase C)

not only beeomes a funetion of time during phase C, but 
also beeomes dependent on n, in eontrast to its initial 
value <V'na V'nß> , as given by eq. (3.2.21). With eqs. 
(3.2.23) and (3.2.24) one ean write eq. (3.2.37) also in

In order to earry out the integration in this equa-

The Kroneeker ö is ineorporated here in order to simplify 
the initial eondition, as will be shown below. This does 
not matter: we are interested only in the deviatorie eom-
ponents of the stress tensor. (In eq. (3.2.17) the isotropie 
part has been disregarded.) 
In order to derive a suitable differential equation 
for Saß one starts with a eonsideration akin to the one 
used by Einstein in his theory of the Brownian motion. If, 
aeeording to the reptation eoneept, during a time interval 
ßt the (equilibrated) primitive ehain moves over a eertain 
distanee 
ßS along its eontour, the (average) loeation of the 
n-th monomer unit moves to a loeation, where the (average) 
plaee of the (n + 
ßsjt)-th monomer unit has previously been. 
As a eonsequenee one obtains also for the dyadie of the 
orientation veetor:

simultaneous situation, the angular braekets in eq. (3.2.40) 
point to a great nurnber of events, where after a time 
interval 
~t the new situation is inspeeted. In this sense 
the right side of eq. (3.2.40) is expanded with respeet to 
~s in apower series. One obtains: 
Saß (n. t + lIt) = «(1+

The boundary eondition for the ehain ends (free 
ehoiee of direetion) is the equilibrium eondition: 
(3.2.43) 
The initial eondition (t ~ TB) is given by eq. (3.2.21). 
The solution of this problem is rather easily obtained and 
reads:

where by combination of eqs. (3.2.24) and (3.2.42) one

3.2.3 Experimental Evidence 
3.2.3.1 Relaxation after Application of 
a Step Shear Strain. 
At this point it is interesting to note that the 
theory by Doi, as described above, gives at least a 
qualitatively correct picture of what happens in reality, 
if a concentrated polymer solution or a polymer melt is 
rapidly deformed and the subsequent stress relaxation is 
investigated. In the orginal paper Doi mentions the work 
by Y. Einaga, K. Osaki and M. Kurata 12 ) on the stress relaxa-
tion of concentrated solutions of pOlystyrenes of narrow 
molecular mass distribution.

component of 5 Qaß is given. According to the methods presen-
ted in the mentioned section, one easily obtains for

If these expressions are used in eq. (3.2.48) and for the

to phase A is left out of consideration. One notices 
from the figure that the behaviour at low values of y are in 
agreement with our ideas about the linear viscoelastic be-
haviour: G(t,y) decreases monotonically with time. At hiqh 
values of y, however, a shoulder occurs where relaxation

according to phase B approaches completion. At times 
higher than that at which the shoulder occurs, curves can 
be superimposed by vertical shifting. This means that, in 
accordance with eq. (3.2.46), the time dependent factor is 
independent of the applied shear in this region of times. 
K. Osaki, et al.,13)have also found that, with increasing mole-
cular mass, both relaxation processes shift to longer times. 
Whereas TC was clearly proportional to the third or a little 
higher power of M, the molecular mass dependence of TB 
could not be determined unambiguously. 
In Fig. 3.3 one of the original sets of experimen-
tal results of the mentioned authors is reproduced for 
comparison. At this occasion the reader is reminded of the 
measurements of G(t,y) as published by H.M. Laun14 )for a 
melt of a low density polyethylene (see Fig.2.12 ). In these 
measurements, however, no influence of the process of 
equilibration is revealed. In fact, all curves can be 
superimposed by vertical shifting. There may be several 
reasons for this behaviour. In a polymer melt the ratio 
TC/TB = No/Ne may be still larger than in a concentrated 
solution. On the other hand, the average molecular mass of 
the polyethylene was much smaller and the distribution of 
molecular masses very broad. Furthermore, the low density 
polyethylene is a branched polymer, for which the above 
derived theory cannot be applied strictly. 
In the present monograph emphasis is on the beha-
viour of polymer melts and on the use of the birefringence 
technique. From this point of view the present author is 
pleased by the fact that K. Osaki and his group very recent-
ly started experiments in this field. One of the advantages 
of the birefringence technique is that the relaxation of the 
first and second normal stress differences can also be 
investigated rather easily with the aid of the linear 
stress-optical rule. (H.M. Laun and cooperators investigated 
the relaxation of the first normal stress difference with 
the aid of the rheogoniometer, but this is not an easy job.

A highly sophistieated apparatus is needed for the purpose.)

fact, this criterion is met by any single integral consti-
tutive equation in which the memory function can be fac-
tored into a (strain independent linear) time dependent 
factor and into astrain dependent damping factor which 
can be considered also as part of the general strain measure, 
as in the case of the Doi-Edwards theory. The fact that the 
slopes öf the curves for the three indicated relaxing quantities 
are identical, expresses the same internal connection.

is clearly manifested by results of purely mechanical measure-
ments, recently reported by Osaki, et al., for more concentra-
ted solutions17). 
3.2.3.2 Relaxation after Stretching. 
For the description of stress relaxation after 
the application of a sudden stretch (step strain) the 
Mooney-Rivlin approach18) 19)has been preferred. For this 
approach one has according to eq. (2.1.28): 
g + P 1 
•.. (3.2.51) 
where C1 and C2 are positive constants, ~ is the Finger tensor 
and ~ the Cauchy tensor. From this equation one easily derives 
the so-called neo-Hookean elasticity modulus Ea 
... (3.2.52) 
where A is the stretch ratio, 011 is the tensile stress 
and 022 is the lateral stress which is put equal to zero. 
J.W.M.Noordermeer and J.D. Ferry20)carried out stress 
and birefringence measurements on uncrosslinked strips of 
two industrial 1,2-polybutadienes. They plotted 011/(A 2-A-1) 
and the optical analogueßn/(A 2 _A-1) (with C1 and C2 of 
eq. (3.2.52) replaced by respective quantities B1 and B2) 
versus 1/A at several (reduced) ttmes after the 'step 
in the strain. In fact, measurements were carried out at 
several temperatures. A temperature of 00 C was chosen as 
the reference temperature. Allowance was made for the tem-
perature dependence of the stress-optical coefficient. 
This coefficient was negative for Sample A (Mw = 1,9.105 , 
Mn = 1,52.105 , 95,3% vinyl) and positive for sample B 
(Mw = 2,91.105 , Mn 
2,36.105 , 88,4% vinyl). The positive sign 
381 

for sample B was probably due to the increased percentage of 
1,4-configurations in the chain. 
Results, as obtained for Sample B, are reproduced 
here. Figure 3.7 shows the pertinent results of the stress 
measurements, whereas Fig. 3.8 gives the results of the 
birefringence measurements, which are a little less accurate 
because of the manual performance of the measurements. 
One immediately notices that the slopes of both sets of 
lines decrease with increasing time, which means that C2 
and B2 are decreasing functions of time. However, the 
intercepts with the ordinate axes (C 1 and B1) decrease 
even faster with increasing time. These time dependences 
can be studied more accurately in the following figure,

consisting of two parts (Fig. 3.9). It turns out that 
C1 and B1 decrease rather rapidly from the very beginning, 
whereas C2 and B2 remain nearly constant up to times of the 
order of 103s. At very large times, the latter quantities 
drop rather quickly as well. For a constant stress-optical 
coefficient the ratios C1/C2 and B1/B2 should be equal at 
every instant. The results shown, however, are consistent 
with a 5% decrease of the stress-optical coefficient from 
\ = 1 to \ = 2. Interestingly enough, the shapes of the 
respective curves, as obtained with Sample A, are more 
consistent with a constant stress-optical coefficient. 
These shapes are very nearly equal, so that the stress-optical 
coefficient of Sample A is certainly the same for both

relaxation mechanisms. According to the authors, the slight 
inconsistencies with Sample Bare probably due to inaccura-
cies in the measurements. 
In anticipation of the results of Doi's recent 
calculations, Noordermeer and Ferry interpreted their 
experimental results as follows: "The final relaxation of the 
C2 term would correspond to a complete renewal of conformations 
of the molecules by disentanglement", whereas the C1 term 
should be due to those entanglements which, according to 
A. Ziabicki21 ), have a lower effectiveness because of the 
way in which they are oriented with respect to the direction 
of deformation (see also M. Hoffmann) .22) In fact, only the 
interpretation of the C1 term needs a revision in view of 
Doi's recent results. 
384 

In order to show that his theory is capable of 
interpreting the mentioned results, Doi calculated Mooney 
plots according to Fig. 3.7 . These plots turned out to have 
features very similar to the experimental ones. In particu-
lar, the time dependences of C1 and C2 were strikingly 
similar to those shown in Fig. 3.9 . As a matter of fact, 
this procedure seems the only way to compare theory with 
experiment, since an analytical transformation of Doi's 
equations into straight Mooney-lines is not feasible, be-
cause the Mooney plot is an approximation valid only 
in a restricted range of 
A-values. 
3.3 General Flow Behaviour of Polymer Melts 
The relaxation processes described in the previous 
sections can be used as the basis for the construction of 
a generally valid constitutive equation for polymer melts. 
However, so far only phase C has been used. As a starting 
point, the pertinent constitutive equation will be given. 
A discussion of the linear visco-elastic properties, which 
can be derived from this equation, will be added. For the 
non-linear behaviour the importance of the very recent 
theory by C.F. Curtiss and R.B. Bird will be emphasized. 23 ) 
The final conclusion will be positive, in spite of still 
existing shortcomings: For the first time in the history of 
the physics of polymer melts, a reasonable and, in principle, 
rather simple description can be given for all main features 
of polymer melt rheology. 
3.3.1 The Constitutive Equation 
In the same manner in which the relaxation modulus 
G(t) is used for the construction of Lodge's rubberlike 
liquid model, the quantity mC(t), as given by eq. (3.2.46), 
can be used to construct the constitutive equation according 
385 

to Doi and Edwards. In Lodge's case the memory function ~(t) 
was given by eq. (2.3.3), viz 
~(t) = -
d G(t)jdt. 
In complete analogy, mC(t) has to be differentiated with 
respect to t in the present case, in order to furnish the 
pertinent memory function 
].I'(t) = 
L 
P odd 
with 
The constitutive equation with this memory function is:

J].I '(t-t') Qa.ß Ij:-l(t,t')] dt' 
-00 
... (3.3.3) 
with 
... (3.3.4) 
As the correctness of this generaliz~tion is not 
necessarily obvious, Doi and Edwards used a sophisticated 
mathematical derivation, which will not be reproduced here. 
Probably, one can short-circuit this derivation by empha-
sizing the fact that Q is a generalized measure for the 
strain which should reduce to the Finger tensor ~ in the 
case of small deformations. 24 ) 25)If this is true, eq. (3.3.3) 
should become identical with Lodge's equation for low strains 
or low strain rates. Since the memory function is, by the 
nature of the model, independent of the strain, eq. (3.3.3) 
should remain valid also in the non-linear range (quasi-
linear model). One distracting point, however, is that Q 
does not exactly become equal to ~ in the limit of zero 
386 

strain. As pointed out in Section 2.4.3, Q becomes egual to 
~/5. This was the reason for changing the definition of Q 
simply by introducing an extra factor five. 
At the present stage of the development, however, 
a continuation of this discussion seems worthwhile, in 
particular, as new insights into the assumptions made, 
can be gained from Section 3.2.2.2. Before these insights 
will be used, however, a simple observation will be made 
with respect to the relation between Lodge's memory 
function ~(t) and the one given by eg. (3.3.1). This re-
lation must read: 
~(t) 
(3.3.5) 
where Go = Eo /3 is the shear modulus of an ideal rubber 
containing cN effective chains per unit of volume, rather 
than Young's modulus Eo ' as defined by eg. (3.2.23). Un-
fortunately, Doi and Edwards used the symbol Go for Young's 
modulus. Apparently, by this choice these authors have 
overlooked that eg. (3.3.3) reduces in the limit of low 
strains or rate of strains to: 
t 
fll'(t-t')B (tt')dt' 
aß 
' 
(3.3.6) 
where Go is the mentioned shear modulus. 
From this eguation one may be tempted to conclude that 
eg. (3.3.3) is incomplete. Part of the strain tensor may 
have been lost during the derivation. If this conclusion 
is true, it is unsatisfactory to multiply eg. (3.3.3) 
simply by (5/3) for correction, since the strain dependence 
of the missing part of the tensor Q must not necessarily 
have the same analytical form. 
Certainly, it will be hard to improve the theory 
in this respect. Rather old experiences with the dumbbell 
model may serve as a guide in this matter. These experiences 
387 

go back to the work by W. and H. Kuhn. Unfortunately, also 
these authors introduced some inaccuracies. In their case, 
inaccuracies were due to inattentively mixing descriptions 
in two and three dimensional space. As a consequence, the 
present author feit the necessity to give an accurate 
account in his 1969 review. 10) 
If the intrinsic viscosity of a dilute suspension 
of elastic dumbbells is calculated straightforwardly, one 
automatically takes into account the Gaussian distribution 
of end-to-end distances. To a first approximation in the 
shear rate, the shape of this radial distribution remains 
unchanged for every direction in space. Oue to orienta-
tion, however, in the first and third quadrants of 
the azimuth (the polar axis coinciding with our 3-axis), 
excess restoring forces, which are directed towards the 
centre are exerted on the beads at the end-points. In the 
second and fourth quadrants oppositely directed excess diffu-
sion forces are observed. These forces are due to the fact 
that more extended configurations are more effectively 
oriented in the flow field. In the direction of preferred 
orientation (i.e. W = 450 ) the concentration of end-points 
at relatively large distances is more increased than that 
at relatively short distances. In this way the equilibrium 
between statistical restoring force and radial diffusion 
force is disturbed. The radial diffusion is modified so 
that the resulting statistical forces can take over the task 
of balancing the radial hydrodynamic forces. 
If, however, for some reason a preaveraging over the 
Gaussian distribution of end-points is carried out and a 
rigid dumbbell is used with an end-to-end distance equal to 
the mean square root of the end-to-end distances of the 
elastic dumbbell, one needs the rigidity of the connector 
between the beads of this dumbbell as an extra condition, 
in order to obtain an identical value for the intrinsic 
viscosity. As a matter of fact, for the rigid dumbbell 
(3/5) of this value appear to be due to angular diffusion 
forces, whereas (2/5) of this value are a consequence of 
388 

so-called "hydrodynamic" forces. By the latter expression 
it is meant that the hydrodynamic friction forces due to 
the radial components of the solvent flow are balanced by 
the rigidity of the connector. (A more elegant description 
of the behaviour of a rigid dumbbell is given by R.B. Bird, 
H.R. Warren and D.C. Evans 26 ). This description was not 
known, however, when the above mentioned review was written.) 
In the mentioned review, the consequences with regard 
to the associated flow birefringence effect were also discussed. 
It appears that the shear stress increment of the elastic 
dumbbell is proportional to its birefringence increment 
according to eq. (1.2.4), with a stress-optical coefficient 
C equal to the one known from the theory of rubber elasti-
city. (See e.g. eq. (1.2.2). On the other hand, for the 
rigid dumbbell eq. (1.2.4) is satisfied only in the limit 
of zero shear rate and with the artificial condition that 
the contribution of the "hydrodynamic forces" is arbitrarily 
omitted. (In this connection Section 2.2.2 should be considered.) 
This observation is in line with the fact that, with the 
elastic dumbbell, also the radial forces are due to statisti-
cal forces, whereas these radial forces are balanced by the 
rigidity of the connector in the case of the preaveraging. 
It goes without saying that this latter stress contribution 
is not reflected by (orientational) birefringence. 
Returning at this point to the discussion of the 
Doi-Edwards theory, one is tempted to ask whether the factor 
(3/5) in front of the integral of eq. (3.3.6) is accidental. 
The present author tends to answer this question in the nega-
tive. If it is true that this factor expresses the fact that 
only angular diffusion forces contribute to the deviatoric 
components of the stress tensor of this theory, questions 
about the influence of slip-links, which by definition 
cannot transfer forces directed along the chain, or about 
the action of Maxwell demons may in fact be immaterial. 
389 

Those forces are suspected to furnish no contribution to the 
deviatoric components of this stress tensor.*) 
Finally, however, one may argue that the influence 
of refinements in the above sense on the relaxation time 
spectrum may not be too important. In fact, the point of 
incertainty with respect to the solution of eq. (3.2.41) 
*) Footnote: An interesting observation is made, when eqs. 
(3.2.17) and (3.2.22) are compared for the case of a

small deformation (linear case). With a 
(F 
) = 1 (cf. 
Section 3.2.2.3) one has instead of eq. (3.2.22): 
(a) 
With Q12 
y/5 one obtains for the shear stress: 
(b) 
whereas eq. (3.2.17) yields: 
(c) 
as it should be. The latter equation is derived with 
X1 = X1 '+YX2 ', 
X2 = X2 ', 
X3 = X3 ',<X1 'X2 ')= 0 and 
~2,2»= Neb 2/3. Since eq. (3.2.20) is uncritical in a 
case where, to a first approximation, 
~ remains unchanged, 
the reason for the discrepancy must lie in eq. (3.2.21). 
By the "rigorous" treatment of Doi, avoiding the indepen-
dent alignment approximation, factor (3/5) is replaced by 
(4/5). This is still unsatisfactory, since eqs. (b) and 
390 
{cl describe virtually the same situation. In fact, the 
action of slip-links is irrelevant, as long aS~n'>~ ~. 
The Maxwell demons are irrelevant, as they influence 
only the boundary value problem of eq. (3.2.25). The 
conclusion is that an inadequate preaveraging procedure 
is responsible for the erroneous factors 3/5 and 4/5, 
respectively. 

will be the initial condition given by eq. (3.2.21). This 
initial condition, however, has no influence on the values 
of the relaxation times. The relaxation strengths, viz. the 
factors of the exponentials in eq. (3.2.47), may probably 
undergo some changes. 
3.3.2 The Linear Viscoelastic Properties of the Model 
3.3.2.1 Monodisperse Samples. 
As a first point, storage and loss moduli will be 
discussed. A comparison of eqs. (3.2.46), (3.2.47) and (A.59)

This is, according to eg. (1.1.33), the famous zero shear

Further we find from eg. (3.2.45) with No

A combination of these eguations clearly shows that the 
zero shear viscosity is predicted to increase with the 
third power of the molecular mass, which is rather close 
to the experimental power of 3,4.

(3.3.13 ) 
According to eg. (1.1.34), this is the first normal 
stress coefficient at zero shear rate. A comparison with 
eg. (3.3.12) shows that this guantitiy is predicted to be 
proportional to the sixth power of the molecular mass. From 
experiments (see Section 1.2.3.3) we know that l/!1,O increases 
with twice the power of the molecular mass of the zero shear 
viscosity. This fact also follows from a comparison of 
egs . ( 3 .3 . 10), ( 3 • 3 . 1 2) and ( 3 . 3 • 1 3). In particular, one f inds 
that the eguilibrium shear compliance J 
, as defined in the 
e 
limit of zero shear rate by eg. (1.1.35), should be independent 
of molecular mass, in agreement with experiment for 
M > Me. One has:

where the factor (5/3) has to be cancelled, if the factor 
(3/5) in front of eqs. (3.3.10) and (3.3.13) is omitted. 
As a next point the limiting cases for w going to 
infinity are investigated. As is obvious from eq. (3.3.9) 
the loss modulus G" goes to zero with w going to infinity. 
As we shall see, this is a consequence of the fact that in 
the underlying spectrum the short relaxation times (of the 
order of TA) are omitted. The limiting value of the storage 
modulus becomes: 
G' 
= lim 
G' = (3/5) 1,12 Go 
W700 
••• (3.3.15) 
One notices that this value of G' in the rubber plateau appro-
ximately agrees with Go' if the factor (3/5) is omitted, as it 
should be (cf. eq. (1.1.56)). 
As is well-known, both moduli of the Rouse model 
finally go to infinity with the square root of increasing 
frequency. The consequence of the addition of the short time 
spectrum (with TA as a leading relaxation time) is therefore 
that, in agreement with experimental results obtained by 
Vinogradov et al. 27 ) and by Onogi et al. 28 ) (see Figs. 1.9, 
1.10), the storage modulus starts to increase again (after the 
rubber plateau), as soon as the frequency becomes high enough. 
According to the measurements by Onogi et al.,. from the 
breadth of the rubber-plateau on the logarithmic time scale 
a ratio of TC/TA can be estimated which is the value predic-
ted by eq. (3.2.45), second formulation. The logarithmic 
distance on the frequency axis between the quadratic ascents 
for M1 = 581 000 (L 18) and M2(~Me) = 14 800 (L j2) covers 
5,3 decades, whereas log (TC/TA) = log [6(M1/Me ) ] = 5,3, 
with M 
18 100. (See the horizontal bars in Figs. 1.9 and 
e 
1.10.) As explained in Section 3.2.2.3, phase B does not play 
a role in linear viscoelasticity. 
Some comments should probably be made with respect to 
the predicted spectrum. According to eq. (A.98) the "line 
393 

spectrum" for phase C of the Doi-Edwards model reads8): 
H(,) 
(3.3.16) 
In order to obtain a feeling for the overall shape of 
this spectrum one conveniently replaces the sum approximately 
by an integral which can be evalutated. One has:

infinite at , = 0 and comes down with the reciprocal square 
root of ,until it abruptly falls to zero at , = 'A. At this

small value. Experimental spectra show a similar, if not so 
extreme shape. In particular, the abrupt discontinuance at 
a terminal relaxation time 
~ does not seem realistic.

3.3.2.2 Polydisperse Sampies. 
Finally, some comments with respect to the influence 
of polydispersity should be added. Since, according to the 
single chain approximation, every chain moleeule contributes 
independently to the stress tensor, one has with G 
being 
o 
independent of molecular mass (see eq. 3.3.11) only an influ-
ence on the memory function. According to Doi and Edwards 8 ) 
~'(t) has to be replaced by:

In particular, one obtains for the equilibrium shear compli-
ance: 
•.• (3.3.26) 
This result gives the desired explanation, why it can happen 
for industrial polymers that Je depends so strongly on the 
molecular mass distribution, whereas for laboratory polymers 
of narrow molecular mass distribution a more or less mole-
cular mass independent J 
is found. (Cf. the results of 
e 
Sections 1.1.4.4 and 1.2.3.3.) From this point it is not 
surprising, however, if the value of Je' as calculated for narrow 
distribution polystyrenes from eq. (3.3.14) with the aid of 
Onogi's experimental value of Go 
(= 2.105 pa)28), is still a 
little lower than the value of J 
as deduced by Wales directly 
e 
from optical measurements29 ). (If in eq. (3.3.17) factor (5/3) is

Also eq. (3.3.24) is of great interest. It probably 
shows that no should, in practice, depend on a little higher 
power of molecular mass than the third power. In fact, in 
general the relative breadth of the molecular mass distribu-
tion seems to increase a little bit, if the average molecular 
mass increases for polymers made according to the same poly-
merization technique. However, since the "natural" molecular 
mass distributions apparently do not show exorbitant features, 
as pointed out by D.W. van Krevelen, D.J. Goedhart and 
P.J. Hoftijzer quite recently30) «M) and <M2)/<M)2 
being the 
only significant parameters) one can expect, in agreement 
with the experience, that the 3,4-th power law of n 
vs. M 
o 
will be of quite general validity. Very recently, however, 
Doi attributed the apparent 3,4-th power law to the fluctu-
ation of the contour length31 ). In a double logarithmic plot 
a curve is predicted with its steepest slope at intermediate 
molecular masses. The mentioned author pointed out that the 
relative value of the fluctuation of the contour length is 
1/~. If N, the number of chain segments per molecule, is not 
much more than 10, this relative fluctuation is significant. 
3.3.3 The Non-Linear Properties of the Model 
Since properties of eq. (3.3.3) have already been 
discussed in Section 2.4.3, a further evaluation can be 
rather concise. The first point of the present 'discussion 
will be steady state shear flow. With the aid of F1 (Y), as 
given in eq. (2.4.85), one obtains for the non-Newtonian steady 
shear viscosity ns(q) 
012(q)/q: 
(3 Go/q) J 
~'(t) F1(qt) d t 
o 
Since for small values of Y = q tone has F1 (qt) 
(see eq. (2.4.87», one obtains in the limit of q 
..• (3.3.27) 
q t/5 
0: 
(3.3.28) 
397 

This is in agreement with eq. (3.3.10). 
For large va lues of shear rate q one can use an 
asymptotic form of memory function ~'(t), which is valid 
if a great number of p-values is necessary (i.e. at t 
+ 0) . 
One obtains: 
= 
~'(t) ~ (8/n 2Tc )(1/2) J exp (-tp 2/ TC ) d p = 
o 
..• (3.3.29) 
(The factor (1/2) in front of the integral reminds us of the 
fact that only odd values of p should be used.) 
Introducing this asymptotic form of ~'(t) intoeq. (3.3.27) 
together with the substitution t = x/q, one obtains for 
sufficiently large va lues of q: 
= 
(6 G / 3/2

-1/2 
()d 
-3/2 
o n 
TC

F1 x 
x ~q 
o 
(3.3.30) 
Interestingly enough, the shape of F1 (y) is of no significance 
in this equation since the integral furnishes only a con-
tribution to the proportionality factor. The strange beha-
viour of this assumptotic expression for n(q), vize that 
the corresponding shear stress 012(q) = q ns(q) finally de-
creases with increasing q, is a consequence of the shape of 
the memory function. Since flow cannot be stable under these 
circumstances, a further discussion is inavoidable. As Doi 
and Edwards point out, the influence of the equilibration 
phase B (Section 3.2.2.3) which is.disregarded here, will 
change the result drastically. If the gap between TC and TB 
is large enough, however, the behaviour according to eq. 
(3.3.30) may prevail in a restricted intermediate range of 
shear rates q, possibly causing the already mentioned melt 
fracture phenomenon. In fact, according to this theory a plot 
of 012(Q)/Go versus TCq is of a universal character. In 
particular this means that the height of the maximum through 
~8 

which the shear stress passes with increasing q, before it 
starts to decrease, is independent of molecular mass, since 
Go is independent of molecular mass. Moreover, because Go 
does not vary very much from polymer to polymer, this maximum 
shear stress will be rather insensitive to the type of poly-
mer investigated. If one assurnes that melt fracture occurs, 
when this maximum shear stress 012,m is reached, it makes 
sense to compare the predicted maximum with the experimental 
range of shear stresses, within which melt fracture has been 
observed. According Ooi and Edwards8) one has 
CJ 12 
/G 
0< 0,3 
,m 
0 
(3.3.31) 
With Onogi's value of Go (= 2.105 Pa) for narrow molecular 
mass distribution polystyrenes one finds: 
5 
CJ 12 ,m 
~ 0,6 . 10 
Pa 
According to J.L. den Otter32 ) the range of shear stresses at 
the capillary wall, where melt fracture was observed, was 
5 
0,4 to 3,0.10 Pa. So the calculated value of 012,m is just 
within this range. For monodisperse polybutadienes Vinogradov 
et a1. 27 ) observed "spurt" at 012 
0< 3,0.105 Pa. 
The experimental fact that, in flow birefringence 
measurements, the linear stress optical rule holds good up 
to the same values of shear stresses, is particularly satis-
factory in this connection: Clearly, the internal equilibra-
tion mechanism, which causes the usefulness of the equations 
by Ooi and Edwards, is convincingly revealed by the validity 
of the linear stress optical rule (see Section 1 ;'2.3.2) . 
As to the occurrence of normal stresses, the following 
should be stated. A first normal coefficient W1 
is predicted, 
,s 
which possesses the limiting value for zero shear rate as 
given by eq. (3.3.13). With increasing rate of shear it 
decreases much fas,ter than the non-Newtonian viscosity 
(W1 
oc q-2). At zero shear rate the ratio of second to first 
,s 
399 

normal stress coefficient is -(2/7). This sign is in agree-
ment with experimental experience, as weIl as the order of 
magnitude. The second normal stress coefficient is predicted 
to decrease with q-2,5 for q + 
00. 
For uniaxial steady extensional flow at sufficiently 
low strain rates a Trouton viscosity of three times the New-
tonian shear viscosity is predicted, as it should be. Whereas 
the predicted non-Newtonian shear viscosity quickly decreases 
with increasing q, the extensional viscosity remains constant 
up to a dimensionless extension rate of EOTC = 2*). In the 
original paper8 ) at higher values of ~OTC a decrease is 
predicted as weIl which is, according to a personal communi-
cation by Doi, the consequence of an inaccuracy of the calcu-
lation. In any case, no pronounced "strain hardening" effect 
is predicted, which may stabilize extensional flow in a stres-
sing experiment (t = 0 for t 
< 0 and E = E = const at t 
~ 0) 
o 
(see Fig. 1.14). In particular, no stress overshoot is predic-
ted for the latter experiment. 
A description of the results for the stressing ex-
periment in shear should be added here. Interestingly enough, 
for 
q TC 
> 1 overshoot is predicted for the transient shear 
stress and the transient second normal stress difference. 
The maxima are found at a total shear q t 
~ 2, irrespective of 
the value of the applied shear rate. Also this feature is, 
at least as far as the shear stress is conoerned, in quali-
tative agreement with experiment (q t 
~ 3). In contrast, for 
the first normal stress difference no overshoot is predicted, 
_which probably means that the stored free energy increases 
monotonically up to its steady state value. unfortunately, 
accurate measurements on linear polymers are 'scarce. Most 
experiments were carried out on low density polyethylenes 
characterized by long chain branching. These polymers show 
overshoot of the first normal stress difference. However,

and (3. 3 .45) . 
400 

recently some measurements were reported, as carried out by 
Laun on a technical polystyrene33 ), for which overshoot was 
found for the shear stress whereas a monotonical increase 
up tö the steady state value was indicated for the first nor-
mal stress difference, if a corresponding shear rate was 
applied. Numerical calculations, however, for such a polymer 
with a broad molecular mass distribution have not yet been 
carried out on the basis of the theory by Doi and Edwards. 
Finally, some words should be said about the problems 
arising with "decreasing" deformations. Quite recently, Doi 
reported on the problems arising with stress relaxation after 
application of a double-step strain, one step forward, one 
step backward34 ). Clearly these problems are akin to those 
35) 
reported by Wagner and Stephenson 
for their damping function 
model. In fact, as pointed out in Section 2.4.3.6, the Doi-
Edwards model can be considered as a special damping function 
model. The opinion of the present author that a preaveraging, 
leading to an oversimplified "initial" condition for Saß(n,t) 
(see eq. (3.2.39», as valid shortly after the first step 
(t = TB) and expressed by eq. (3.2.21), is responsible for 
certain shortcomings of the model, has been expressed in the 
foregoing. The difficulties arising if a system which is pre-
oriented in a first part of the strain history, is deformed 
in an opposite direction in a second part of the strain 
history, are certainly of a higher order than those avoided 
by the above mentioned preaveraging. So it does not convince 
the present author, if Doi introduces a very detailed con-
sideration in order to obtain the "initial" condition for 
Saß(n,t) after the second step in the strain. On the other 
hand, the soundness of the basic concept is certainly not 
affected by these purely mathematical difficulties. 
3.3.4 A More Elaborate Model 
Very recently C.F. Curtiss and R. B. Bird 23.) develo-
ped a kinetic theory for polymer melts on the basis of the 
Curtiss-Bird-Hassager phase-space formulation 36 ) 37). In avoi-
401 

ding notions like primitive chain, tube, slip-links and Maxwell 
demons these authors succeeded in developing equations of a 
nature quite similar to those given by Doi and Edwards. For 
the first, a molecular theory expression for the stress tensor 
was given, including a proof of the symmetry of this tensor on 
the basis of the reptation concept and of the "mild curvature" 
assumption. These concepts were also necessary for the deriva-
tion of a "diffusion equation" for a "single-link orientational 
distribution function" identical with the one given by Doi and 
Edwards. The term mild curvature means that the directions of 
successive links of the bead-rod model according to Kramers 
(viz. the directions of successive rods) are only slightly 
different. Reptation concept and mild curvature assumption, 
in combination with the introduction of a tensor drag coeffi-
cient ~ , bring about an effect similar to that of the tube 
in the Doi-Edwards model. The tensor drag coefficient reads: 
(3.3.32) 
where ~ is the usual friction factor of a bead, ~ is the 
unit vector of the k-th link and e: is a dimensionless "link 
tension coefficient" (not to be confused with Hencky's strain 
measure e:). This e: is an empirical coefficient varying between 
zero and one. The case e: 
= 0 seems to correspond to the 
case treated by Doi and Edwards. Another empiricism Nß , with 
N being the number of links per chain molecule and ß being 
the "chain constraint exponent", is put in front of the 
tensor drag coefficient as a factor, in order to account 
for the increased constraint experienced by an arbitrary 
bead, when built in into a chain of increasing lengtn. 
The exponent ß turns out to vary between 0 and about 0,5. 
A detailed discussion of the derivations given in the 
papers by Curtiss and Bird is certainly beyond the scope of 
the present treatment. The diffusion equation of the men-
tioned "single-link orientational distribution function" 
is obtained by a contraction of the one for the "single-
402 

chain configurational distribution function". In this way 
the following equation is obtained: 
-
~: u~u)f 
... (3.3.33) 
where f = f( ~, G, t) is the above mentioned single link 
orientational distribution function, which is the probability 
of finding the link at fractional distance G from the chain 
end at time t in a direction ~, irrespective of the direc-
tions of the other links of the chain molecule. Doi and 
Edwards arrived at the same equation along other lines. 
The tensor ~ is the velocity gradient ~~.*)The differential 
quotient in ~ is defined as: 
d 
d 
1 
3 
dU = v de + .:::. sin e ~ 
(3.3.34) 
where ~, ~, ~ is the usual orthogonal triad of the unit vectors 
tangential to the coordinate lines in spherical coordinates, 
the direction of unit vector u being determined by polar angle 
e and azimuth <P. 
The time constant A is given by: 
(3.3.35) 
where a is the length of the link in Kramers' bead-rod mo-
de138 ). Its length is assumed to be comparable with the 
spacing a in the slip link model. The time constant A is 
equivalent to n 2 TC in the theory of Doi and Edwards (cf. 
eq. ( 3 . 2 . 45) ) • 
*) Footnote: In the notation of Curtiss and Bird the transpose 
of 'l v is equal to ~. 
403 

The stress tensor in terms of the single-link 
orientational distribution function was found to be: 
g = Nn kT{-(1/3)i + ~ ~ ~~ da + EA~:~ a(l-a)~ ~ ~ ~> da} 
••• (3.3.36) 
In this equation the sign convention of Doi and Edwards is 
introduced (positive tractions). The symbol n here means the 
same as the symbol c in the equations of Doi and Edwards, viz. 
the number density of polymer chains. The averages, as indica-
ted by the angular brackets, have to be carried out over the 
distribution function f( ~, 0, t). For the case that E is 
equal to zero, eq.(3.3.36) gives the expression for g as obtai-
ned by Doi and Edwards, if Nn k T is replaced by 3 (No/Ne)C k T. 
If allowance is made for the differences in the coefficients, 
for the case of 
E = 0 the result of the theory by Curtiss 
and Bird is identical with that of the theory by Doi and 
Edwards. 
The latter assumption E = 0, however, should be correct 
at least approximately in view of the validity of the linear 
stress-optical rule. In fact, a pronounced contribution of the 
third term between the braces of eq. (3.3.36) would mean a 
large contribution to the stress-tensor proportional to the 
link tension, as expressed by E. Such a contribution is akin 
to the contribution of the rigidity of the connector rod of a 
rigid dumbbell to the stress tensor and can never be depicted 
by a birefringence effect, as caused merely by the orientation 
of chain links. This third term will also be zero at the very 
moment of cessation of flow, when ~ turns zero. In stress 
relaxation after flow such an observable sudden stress decrease, 
however, has never been found for polymer melts. Moreover, it 
will cause a step-wise increase of shear or tensile stress 
when flow is started. This would mean that the apparent stress-
optical coefficient should start from zero. This effect is not 
revealed by the experiments.*) 
*) For footnote see next page. 
404 

On the other side, another achievement of Curtiss 
and Bird is the application of the retarded motion expansion, 
as proposed by R.S. Rivlin and J.L. Ericksen. According to 
the formulation by Bird, Armstrong and Hassager 39 ) a deforma-
tion tensor ~[Ol, which is ~ -
~ in our previous notation 
(~ ... Cauchy strain tensor) can be expanded as follows: 
(t'-t)n 
(n) 
:'b 
(t) 
L 
n=1

(3.3.37) 
where the tensors ~(n) are the Rivlin-Erickson tensors, 
which can be calculated with the aid of the recursion 
relation: 
(n+1)

(n) 
(n) 
T 
(n) 
:'b 
= Dt:'b 
+:'b 
~ +)$~ 
:'b 
(3.3.38) 
In this equation the material derivative O/Ot with respect 
to time occurs. (For homogeneous flow it is replaced by 
the normal partial derivative.) The recursion is started 
with ~(1) = 2 ~ = ~ ~ + 
(~~)T, being twice the rate of 
deformation tensor previously used. Equation (3.3.37) is 
a Taylor expansion around the present time t. The time depen-
dence in the time interval between previous time t' and pre-
sent time t is determined by the derivatives at time t, as 
given by eq. (3.3.38). (In steady state homogeneous 
flow all O/Ot are zero.) 
For example, the "universal" strain tensor Q by 
Ooi and Edwards has been shown by Curtiss and Bird to be

it reflects the presence of a short time spectrum accor-
ding to phase B of Ooi, the consequences of this spectrum 
not being worked out in detail. In this ca se the arguments 
concerning the stress-optical rule are invalid, since 
deviations are expected only on the time scale of phase A.

In practice, however, the authors used the retarded 
motion expansion (3.3.37) in developing a perturbation solu-
tion of the single-link orientational distribution function. 
(This function is given as an integral over previous times t' 
and contains the same denominator as the integrand of eq. 
(3.3.39). It forms a solution of eq. (3.3.33).) The inte-
gration of this perturbation solution over t' is easily 
carried out and the retarded motion expansion for f( ~, G, t) 
is obtained. With the aid of this expansion the averages 
<~ ~> and 
<~ ~ ~ ~) , as occurring in eq. (3.3.36), 
are calculated. Finally, the following interesting equation

For 
E = 0 this is in agreement with Doi and 
Edwards. Qualitatively, eq. (3.3.44) describes the exten-
sional viscosity correctly, as can be seen by a comparison 
with Fig. 1.1440). Eq. (3.3.44) also predicts that, for one-
sided compression or biaxial extension, n should decrease 
407 

monotonically, if e = o. Also this is_qualitatively in agree-
ment with experiment (see Fig. 1.79)41). 
Since the bead density Nn is molecular mass independent 
(above a certain molecular mass at which the number of end-
groups becomes disregardable), no is proportional to A and 
W1 
is proportional to A2 • A look at eq. (3.3.35) informs us

well-known empirical relations are predicted (cf. Section 
1.2.3.3). However, the physical reason for these exponents 
being a 
little larger than three or six, respectively, is a 
very different one according to Curtiss and Bird, from the 
one recently suggested by DOi31 ) , which makes the fluctuation 
of the contour length of the primitive chain responsible 
for this increase (cf. the end of Section 3.3.2.2). 
3.3.5 Conclusions 
This Chapter 3 is introduced under the name 
"prospects for predictions on a molecular basis". As a 
consequence, conclusions seem inavoidable. It seems that 
progress of theory, as observed during very re cent years, 
would justify a rather optimistic view. 
In the near future certainly further contributions 
of experimentalists will be necessary. In particular, ex-
periments should be carried out on chemically very weIl cha-
racterized sampies. If the molecular mass distribution of a 
sampie (not necessarily a very narrow distribution) is accu-
rately determined, the linear visco-elastic behaviour should 
be calculated first on the basis of the theories discussed 
408 

above and eompared with experiment. As a next step, the 
non-linear behaviour should be eonsidered.*) 
Not very mueh is known, however, until now about the 
behaviour of polymers eontaining long ehain branehes. Some 
first theoretieal trials still seem insuffieient. In this 
connection the reasons for observed long time restoration 
of rheologieal properties after shearing should be dis-
eovered. 
Without doubt, the ultimate goal will be the under-
standing of the behaviour of polymer melts under proeessing 
eonditions, to which the next chapter is devoted on a 
provisional basis.

4 Industrial Applications 
For this chapter only two topics are selected, viz 
molecular orientation in stretched amorphous samples and 
the birefringence patterns in injection moulded strips of 
amorphous polymers. No reference is made to typical hydro-
dynamic problems like the interpretation of birefringence 
distributions in non-uniform flow fields as occurring in 
the entrance region of capillaries etc. The reason for 
this omission is that the present author does not feel 
competent in solving these problems with the aid of ad-
equate constitutive equations. Beautiful qualitative 
pictures are found in Chang D. Han's book1) and in the papers 
by Teikichi Arai and coworkers 2) . 
4.1 Molecular Orientation 
As is well known, molecular orientation is of 
great importance in synthetic fibres. Modulus and rupture 
stress increase with the degree of orientation. Molecular 
orientation, however, is not always of advantage. The 
tendency of crazing in a direction parallel to the align-
ment of the molecules is observed in oriented sheets and 
injection moulded parts of amorphous polymers. The oriented 
objects appear to be brittle, when bent perpendicular to 
the draw direction. The importance of molecular orientation 
has been underlined in the past by at least two cooperative 
research efforts organized by the IUPAC Working Party on "Struc-
ture and Properties of Commercial pOlymers,,3) 4). In these 
efforts a rather large number of industrial laboratories 
participated. In the after-math of these investigations 
413 

quite significant insight has been gained by H.M. LaunS ) 
into widely used methods for the characterization of mole-
cular orientation. The mentioned methods comprise the 
measurement of the birefringence, the so-called thermal 
shrinkage and the accompanying maximum shrinkage stress. 
They have been used in industrial laboratories for the 
characterization of product quality. By the work of Laun 
also some new equations of linear viscoelasticity have been 
produced. Some of these equations are included in Appendix A. 
4.1.1 The Linear Theory of Strain Recovery after Partial Relaxation 
In Appendix Apart of Laun's ideas is worked out 
in eqs. (A.27) through (A.33). In these equations, however, 
only the recovery after a continuous stressing experiment 
is treated. For the present purpose attention should be 
paid to a stressing experiment followed by the application of 
aperiod of fixed shape. This means, that recovery should be 
allowed only after an intermediate per iod of stress relaxa-
tion. The capacity of the sampIe to recover after this 
per iod is compared with the stress still present at the 
moment when the shape of the sampIe is released. (For shear 
recovery the usual lateral constraints have to be observed!) 
The mentioned stressing can be carried out during an ex-
tremely short time ~t at an extremely highstrain rate q 
or EO
' 
with ~tq = Yo or ~tEo = EO being finite, so that 
a step-function is approximated. The stressing experiment 
can also be conducted at a finite strain rate until the 
steady flow situation is reached, be fore the period Gf 
fixed shape is introduced. In this way two interesting 
limiting cases are created according to Laun. 
If the stressing in shear lasts for a time interval 
~t and the recoverable shear strain y (t) is observed after 
r 
the release of the outer shear stress at time t, one 
obtains (with the aid of the superposition principle) the 
following equation which is modelIed after eq. (A.31): 
414

= q~t -
~ J G(t')(t-t')dt' + ~ J 
G(t'-~t)(t-t')dt' 
nOn 
~t 
••• (4.1.1) 
In fact, Yr(t) is calculated for the superposition of two 
stressing experiments at equal shear rate q, which are both 
continued up to time t. One of these experiments, however, 
is started at t = 0 in the positive direction, whereas the 
other is started at t = ~t in the negative direction. In 
this way Y = q~t shows no 
further increase for t 
> ßt. 
For a corresponding tensile experiment q must be replaced 
by EO • To the terms containing G(t) a factor three has to 
be added. After some rearrangements one has: 
y (t)

This equation can easily be specialized for the 
mentioned limiting cases. It can easily be shown that for 
~t + 0 and q + ~ the sum of the first and the second 
integral is of the order of ~t and can be omitted. With 
q~t = Yo (step in shear at t 
= 0) one finally obtains:

where 0s(t) = q J G(t')dt' is the time dependent shear stress 
o 
of the stressing experiment started at t = O. The'complication 
arizing from the fact that q is assumed to be infinite is 
only delusion since also Os (~) = n q is proportional to q, so 
that q disappears in the ratio. As is well-known, the 
relaxing shear stress ° . (t) after a step in the shear

strain Yo is given by:

They can both be calculated 
with the aid of eqs. (A.82) and (A.89) from the dynamic 
shear moduli G' (w) and G" (w), if desired. Aprerequisite 
is that both moduli are measured in a sufficiently wide 
range of frequencies. For eq. (4.1.4) G' (w) should be 
measured at least up to a value of circular frequency w, 
where the rubber plateau is reached, which is not easy for 
commercial polymers with a wide molecular mass distribution. 
For a qualitative comparison it is very useful to 
express G(t) in terms of a line spectrum.(See eq. (A.46».

through the linear stress-optical rule -

faster than the capacity to recover*) •

occurs after steady state flow and subsequent partial rela-

for the tensile stress. In this ca se y must be replaced by 
E and a factor 3 must be added to eq. (4.1.5). If in eq. 
(4.1.6) the shear viscosity n is replaced by the Trouton 
viscosity n = 3n, one has to add also a factor 3 to this 
equation in compensating for this replacement. Otherwise

obtains the perspicuous equations:

In this connection eqs. (1.1.31), (1.1.32) and (1.1.34) should 
be compared. Since the storage modulus is difficult to be deter-
mined in the range of very low frequencies (because of being 
only a fraction of the loss modulus), this method forms an 
important complement to the dynamic oscillatory measurements 
which, on their part, are used as a convenient means to 
418 

characterize polymer melts. On account of the linear stress-
optical rule also flow birefringence measurements can be used 
for the same purpose. The ratio of eqs. (1.2.5) and (1.2.4) 
yields together with the generalized eqs. (1.1.33) and 
(1.1.34):

.•• (4.1.16) 
Since the equations, on which this relation is based, 
have been shown to be valid only in the limit of extremely 
low rates of shear q (see Section 2.3.6), the left side of 
eq. (4.1.16) must be considered to be twice the initial slope 
of the extinction angle curve, as obtained for the steady 
flow situations. How this slope could be determined, was shown 
by F.H. Gortemaker. A beautiful example is given by Fig.1.63. 
The mentioned author was lucky that the dynamic moduli, which 
he determined at extremely low frequencies for the polystyrene 
melt under consideration, were accurate enough for a calculation 
of the .initial part of the extinction angle curve on the basis 
of Lodge's theory (dotted line). For a broader molecular mass 
distribution, as usual for polyolefines, such a calculation 
would not be possible. However, in the latter case the ultimate 
ratio of G'/G"w 
should be determinable from the initial slope 
of the extinction angle curve. 
4.1.2 Experimental Observations Related to Product Quality 
This section is opened with the presentation of" 
Fig. 4.1, which shows the (approximate) courses of the funct 
ions, as given by eqs. (4.1.5), (4.1.6), (4.1.11) and (4.1.12), 
for a low density polyethylene melt. As all curves are con-
structed after normalization at t= 0, eqs. (4.1.6) and 
(4.1.11) furnish an identical curve~ The approximate line 
spectrum required for the pertinent calculations has been 
determined by Laun in the same paper on the basis of the 
dynamic moduli G' (w) and G" (w). The figure has necessarily

an approximate character, since the mentioned spectrum does 
not cover a sufficient range on the time scale. As one of the 
consequences of this fact Go 
Lgi could only roughly be 
estimated, which means that the pertinent curve I shows some 
uncertainty with respect to its vertical position by probably 
a factor two. The position of curve II which stands for 
eqs. (4.1.6) and (4.1.11), is pretty secure. The curve III, 
however, has been shaded on its upper side. This means that 
its correct course can only lie on the upper side of curve III, 
as constructed with the aid of too low a number of relaxation 
times in the long time tail of the spectrum. Notwithstanding 
the indicated reasons for a precautious interpretation of 
this figure one can safely conclude that, in the step strain 
experiment, the stress re laxes by a factor of the order of 
ten faster than the pertinent capacity to recover (compare 
curves I and II). After steady flow one finds a similar 
phenomenon. Also in this case there is about one decade 
time lag between the stress relaxation and the decay of 
the capacity of the sample to recover (compare curves II 
and III).

In Fig. 4.2 Laun's original figure is shown. It con-
tains only results for a step strain experiment with 
ßt = 130 ms and a step height of Hencky strain €o = 1. 
(Cf. curves I and II.) Since Laun was not able to give a 
good estimate for Go' he renounced the idea of drawing 
his lines from the same level at log t = -
00. Another reason 
for avoiding this presentation was that his experimental points 
(open circles for tensile stress relaxation, open triangles 
for recoverable Hencky strain) were obtained in a non-linear 
experiment, for which the linear theory gives an underesti-
mate of the tensile stress. (Cf. Fig.1.11, as taken from 
Meissner's pioneer work7 ) , wh~re for low density polyethylene 
the tensile stress is shown to grow much faster during the stres-
sing experiment than according to the linear theory.) This means 
that also in the beginning of the relaxation stress values

higher than those predicted on the basis of the linear theory 
must be expected. In the range of times, however, where the stress 
relaxation of Laun's experiment is compared with the predictions 
of the linear theory, no significant differences between these 
predictions and the experimental results are found. This means 
that the predictions of the previous, more intuitive Fig. 4.1 
are realistic for practical purposes. 
In practice, oriented sampies are characterized by 
the measurement of their birefringence and/or by the determi-
nation of their so-called heat shrinkage. The latter quantity 
is obtained as the recovery of the sampie which has been 
heated up to a temperature weIl above its glass transition 
(or melting) temperature. T.T. Jones 3) reported in his report 
"The Effect of Molecular Orientation on the Mechanical Pro-
perties of Polystyrene" on the result of an interesting 
IUPAC-cooperation. The participants heated their sampies, 
when held between clamps of tensile testing machines, and 
measured the developing latent tensile stress. They found that 
the maximum shrinkage stress thus obtained was proportional 
to the birefringence as measured under the same conditions, 
irrespective of the rate of heating or the degree of frozen-in 
orientation. In Fig.4.3 the results of this cooperation are 
summarized. The observed stress-optical coefficient was 
C = -
5,2.10- 9 pa-1 , in fair agreement with the results repor-
ted in Sections 1.2.3.1 and 1.2.3.2. In this way a clear evi-
dence is given of the correctness of the statement made half-way 
in Section 4.1.1, according to which relaxing birefringence and 
stress are equivalent. 
Finally, it should be mentioned that E:G. Kiel8) of 
Philips, Eindhoven (Netherlands), has recently carried out a 
great number of tests on a variety of amorphous polymers 
suitable for injection moulding. In all cases he found that, 
during annealing under strict shape constraint, the 
birefringence relaxed at least a factor ten faster than 
the capacity to recover. The sampies showed a longitudinal 
shrinkage after removal from the constraining mould. At

first sight this seems in agreement with the derivations 
given in Section 4.1.1. However, the birefringence in 
injection moulded samples is mainly due to shear flow and 
is of the type n 11 -
n 33 (see Sections 1.2.2.3 and 1.2.3.4 
for the slit geometry), if observed with the aid of a light 
beam directed perpendicular to the surface of the sample.

n 22 is very small compared with n 11

been steady be fore cessation. This equation, however, shows 
the same time dependence as eq. (4.1.12). No difference should 
be expected in this case between the courses of the relaxations 
of birefringence and recoverable strain, at least as long as 
the used linear or pseudo-linear relations can be applied. 
Fortunately, however, in injection moulding the steady flow 
situation is certainly not reached. In fact, after a step in 
the shear strain where steady state has not been reached, for 
423 

all constitutive equations which meet the LOdge-Meissner cri-
terion (cf. Section 2.3.2), the first normal stress difference 
relaxes according to the same law as the shear stress. But the 
latter law is given for the linear case by eq. (4.1.5). This 
means that, in contrast to the relaxation after steady shear 
flow, one has actually to expect that there will be a signifi-
cant difference in the speeds of relaxation of birefringence 
and recoverable shear like the difference suggested by the cour-
ses of curves I and 11 of Fig.4.1. This means that the quoted 
results by Kiel can be understood in terms of the given theory. 
A quantitative description, however, will not directly be fea-
sible due to the fact that the recoveries in different layers 
of the sampie are interacting. Also the lateral constraints, 
characteristic for pure shear recovery, are no longer given 
in these experiments. 
4.2 Injection Moulding 
4.2.1 Two Types of Birefringence 
The interesting birefringence patterns found in 
injection moulded objects of amorphous polymers have been the 
subject of speculations during the last two decades 1) 9). In 
semi-crystalline (crystallizable) polymers these patterns are 
disturbed by the process of the subsequent crystallization 
so that the morphology of the crystallites becomes the more 
important point of the diccussion10). In the present context 
problems of crystallization can only briefly oe mentioned, 
however. On the other hand, the birefringence in amorphous poly-
mers will be considered rather painstakingly, since a major 
sour ce of this birefringence is formed, as with flow birefrin-
gence, by the orientation of chain molecules. In fact, one can 
consider this type of birefringence as a frozen-in flow bire-
fringence created during the non-isothermal filling process 
of the mould. 
424 

Another contribution to the total effect is caused 
by the continued cooling of the sample after the completion 
of the filling process. During this cooling he at is withdrawn 
from the sample by he at conduction. As a consequence of low 
heat conductivity rather high temperature gradients are pre-
vailing in the sample initially, so that the outer layers 
already form a rigid hull when the core is still at a tempera-
ture well above the glass transition temperature. Finally, 
the interior is under the influence of considerable tensile 
stresses, whereas the outer layers are compressed11 ) 12). The 
accompanying birefringence differs in nature from the above 
mentioned orientational birefringence. Probably it can be 
removed by proper annealing, presumably under severe condi-
tions of constant shape and at a temperature very close to 
the glass-transition temperature. By subsequent extremely 
slow cooling larger transient temperature gradients should 
be avoided. Only after such a treatment pure orientational 
birefringence can be expected. As is well known, this bire-
fringence re laxes extremely slowly near the glass-transition 
temperature, where the disengagement process (see phase C of 
Doi and Edwards) takes place at a pace 1013 times slower than 
at the processing temperature (see Appendix B)*) . 
Another proposal has been to quench an absolutely 
isotropie reference sample from processing temperature to 
mould wall temperature and subtract the obtained birefrin-
gence pattern from that of the injection moulded sample. 
Unfortunately, no quantitative results have been reported 
so far by A.I. Isayev, C.A. Hieber and D. L. Crouthame1 14 ) 
with respect to this second method. These authors showed 
that the thermally induced stresses cannot be deduced from 
a simple stress-optical relation. With the aid or the 
layer-removal technique -
a basically mechanical method -
they arrived at the interesting insight that the quenching 
*) Footnote: B. Haworth, G.J. Sandilands and J.R. white13 ) did 
not arrive at conclusive results, when using the annealing 
procedure. 
425 

stresses in the injection moulded sampie must be much smaller 
than those in the reference sampie. So, a preliminary con-
clusion is that the composite birefringence pattern of the 
injection moulded sampie gives a reasonably realistic picture 
of the cavity filling process. However, in order to understand 
this process one needs a more detailed model of the he at trans-
fer occurring during this process. 
4.2.2 Heat Transfer During Mould Filling 
4.2.2.1 A Verbal Description. 
The description of the filling process, which will be 
tried in this section, does not aim at a thorough documentation 
of the contributions of previous investigators in the field. 
The present author does not claim to be a special ist in the 
technology of injection moulding. On the other hand he is 
convinced of the merits of a multidisciplinary approach. As 
will become obvious in that which foliows, the mould filling 
process and the origin of the observed birefringence pattern 
can only be understood if chunks of knowledge from diverse 
domains of transport phenomena and polymer science are brought 
together. Notions like boundary layer, glass-transition, WLF-
equation (see Appendix B), linear stress-optical rule for 
the liquid state (predicting no delay between stress and 
birefringence) and transient normal stress difference have 
to be combined even for a qualitative description of the 
phenomenon. As the present author cannot be an expert in all 
these fields, he has to rely on the appreciation of the reader 
if not all aspects are treated against an equa~ly proper histo-
rical background. 
During the last two decades a great number of experi-
mental investigations has served for a general survey of re-
lationships between process variables, molecular parameters 
and end-product properties15 ) 16) 17). In particular one should 
mention the application of a minimum level of the injection tem-
426 

perature and of restrictions in the molecular mass of the polymer 
as prerequisites for the stability of the end-product. 
(Influences of the shape of the cavity on the stability of 
the product will be disregarded here.) As an example for a 
relationship between two measurable end-product properties 
the connection between the degree of molecular orientation 
and the proneness to crazing in the direction of preferential 
orientation should be mentioned18 ). 
More detailed investigations revealed the fact that 
this molecular orientation is very often concentrated in a 
layer under the surface of the injection moulded object. 
Two symmetric peaks of the birefringence are found in the 
cross-section of the sampie on either side at a distance 
from the surface small compared with the thickness of the 
sample19 ). Interestingly enough, I.T. Barrie20) reported for 
injection moulded strips that the thickness of a "freeze off" 
layer was proportional to the cubic root of the injection 
time, which sounds familiar to those specialized in boundary 
layer concepts. In order to obtain this layer, Barrie used a 
blowing agent, by which foaming occurred in the core of the 
strip, when the clamps of the mould were released immediate-
ly after the instant the cavity was filled. Only in the layer 
solidified during mould filling the material remained compact. 
As will be discussed below the thickness of this "freeze-off" 
layer is related to the distance of the birefringence maximum 
from the surface. 
Interestingly enough only from the work by J.L.S.Wales 
and J. van Leeuwen and R. van der Vijgh19 ) , as published in 
1972, a more complete picture of the locations and the heights 
of the birefringence maxima as functions of the dtstance from 
the gate, can be drawn. According to this investigation the 
thickness of the "freeze-off" layer in a moulded strip is 
not uniform, in contrast to previous apprehensions according to 
which a sandwich structure of parallel layers is found. The 
"freeze-off" layer possesses a maximum thickness at a distance 
from the (line) gate of about 20% of the total length of the 
strip. At the same distance the pertinent birefringence peak

has a maximum height. These facts are illustrated with the 
aid of Fig.4.4, as taken from the mentioned paper. In its 
upper part this figure shows the birefringence distributions 
over cross sections located at places indicated by arrows in 
the lower part of the figure. These cross-sectional distribu-
tions were obtained by slicing the strip parallel to its small 
side wall and measuring the birefringence with the aid of a 
polarizing microscope. It goes without saying that slices from 
the centre were used in avoiding influences of the said 
side-walls on the flow. (The dimensions of the mould cavity 
were 300 x 75 x 2 mm. The polymer used was a technical poly-
styrene, injection temperature was 2500 C, cavity wall tempe-
rature was 500 C and injection time was 2,5 s.) In the lower 
part of the figure the birefringence average over the cross-
428 

section is shown as a function of the distance from the gate. 
This quantity is simply determined from the original strip 
with the aid of a light-beam directed perpendicular to the 
largest surface of the strip.*) 
The present author was able to give the desired inter-
pretation for the experienced distribution of the birefringence 
in rather simple terms in his 1977 paper21 ). It seems that be-
fore that date nobody has sized up the possibilities for a 
simple description including all relevant features. In fact, on 
these grounds it is not difficult to give a verbal description 
of the model: 
If in a mental experiment the strip mould cavity is 
considered as an open duct of rectangular cross section of large 
aspect ratio (its width being large compared with its height), 
one can imagine that, with the aid of a powerful extruder, a 
continuous stream of a hot polymer melt can be realized through 
this duct, even if the latter is kept at a temperature below 
glass transition. In such an experiment a steady situation 
is reached in which the duct walls are clad with a vitrified 
layer. According to well-known principles 22 ) the thickness of 
this layer is proportional to the cubic root of the distance 
from the gate. 
In a second mental experiment a sheet of the hot 
polymer is thought to be wrapped around a hot drum. The 
circumference of this drum is chosen equal to the length 
of the strip mould cavity. If this sheet is rolled down 
on a cold plate (of metal) like a dough on a chopping-board, 
with a speed equal to the injection speed, one obtains 
*) Footnote: In investigations of other authors 14 ) the (broad) 
maximum of the average birefringence was not revealed. 
According to Wales the lower birefringence near the gate is 
only obtained if a narrow line gate is used, marking an 
exact entrance to the cavity over its whole width. "Jetting" 
is not considered in the present context. 
429 

another vitrified layer which, at the end of the rolling-down 
experiment, has just reached a thickness which is proportional 
to the square root of the distance from the end of the mould 
cavity. This can easily be understood with the aid of the 
theory for heat penetration into a semi-infinite slab with 
the penetration depth being proportional to the square root 
of the contact time23 ). In fact, the time span, over which the 
polymer touches the cold plate until the end of the rolling-
down experiment, is given by 
t(z) = t. (1 - z/L), 
1 
(4.2.1) 
where t. is the injection (or rolling-down) time, z is the 
1 
distance from the gate and L is the total length of the 
cavity. This second model was used implicitely by W. Dietz et 
al. 24 ). However, in this model the axial convection of heat, 
which causes the layer thickness distribution of the first 
experiment, is disregarded. In fact, no flow occurs in the 
sheet. (By the way, without shearing the "freeze-off" layer 
cannot be marked by the birefringence. But this is no argu-
ment in a mental experiment.) 
In reality, the results of the first mental experiment 
will prevail near the gate, where the time of contact with 
the cold wall is nearly the total injection time. This time 
may suffice for the adjustment of an almost steady state 
situation. On the other hand, near the end'of the cavlty, 
the second mental experiment furnishes an upper bound for 
the thickness of the vitrified layer, since any axial heat 
convection can only lower the layer thickness. The conclusion 
must be that somewhere halfway between the ga~e and the end 
of the cavity the function of one process will be taken over 
by the other. In this area the layer thickness must show a 
maximum, in accordance with experiment. 
Finally, it should be explained why the distance of 
the peak of the birefringence from the surface of the strip 
can be considered as a measure for the thickness of the 
430 

"freeze-off" layer. If flow is synunetric with respect to a 
central plane (as located halfway between the large side 
walls of the duct) and inertia is disregarded, the shear stress 
is zero at the said central plane and increases linearly up 
to the wall. This fact follows from a simple balance of forces 
and does not depend on the questions whether flow is steady 
or not and whether flow properties of the fluid change with 
the distance from the centre or not. In the range of tem-
peratures, where the linear stress-optical rule holds, this 
fact is depicted by a linear increase of (Ön/2C) sin 2X 
(cf. eq. (1.2.4» 
from the cent re to the wall, irrespective 
of the question whether the temperature changes over the gap 
or not. At this point it is important to realize that, at 
unchanged flow rate, shear stresses increase as a consequence 
of the increase of the viscosity near the wall. Synchronously, 
the slope of the straight line depicting the shear stress 
as a function of the distance from the centre, increases. 
This process is sketched in Fig. 4.5. In this figure one

notices that the upper part of the steeper line is drawn as 
a dashed line (up to the point B). In this way it should 
be indicated that, as soon as the material passes down through 
the glass transition temperature near the wall, the further 
increase of the stress is no longer depicted by the orien-
tational birefringence. The (curved) line cr 
-
A indicates 
r 
the trace along which the shear stress grows in the layers 
which just pass through the glass transition temperature. 
In this way at point A a maximum is created. The distance 
of this maximum from the surface of the strip gives, accor-
ding to this vision, the thickness of the "freeze-off" layer, 
which is the distance over which the level of the glass 
transition temperature has penetrated into the sample during 
the filling procedure. As soon as flow stops, no further 
growth of shear stresses is expected. In the contrary, re-
maining shear stresses get a chance for partial relaxation 
be fore vitrification stops this process in the core of the 
sample. 
Only recently, this picture was modified in an 
interesting way by A.I. Isayev and C.A. Hieber25 ). These 
authors correctly pointed out that the birefringence, as 
given by the equation 
(4.2.2) 
(cf. eq. (1.2.44», is in a transient state due to the second 
term under the square root. Whereas the first term 
n 12 = (~n/2) sin 2X 
is firmly linked to the shear stress 
without time lag (as a consequence of the linear stress-
optical rule), the second term (as the optical counterpart 
of the first normal stress difference) is, like the latter 
one, lagging behind the growing shear stress. This delay 
becomes more pronounced the lower the temperature iso This 
phenomenon is akin to the one described by M.H. Wagner and 
H.M. Laun26 ) in shear creep on a melt of low density polyethy-
lene (see Fig. 2.13). In this experiment shear stress is 
432 

imposed at zero time. The shear deformation and the first 
normal stress are measured simultaneously as functions of 
time. A theoretical description of these functions was given 
by Wagner (see Section 2.5.3.3). It appears that the first 
normal stress difference grows slowly and reaches its maximum 
value as much as ten seconds after the imposition of the 
shear stress at the reference temperature of 1500 C. So it 
is no wonder, if at the rather short injection time normal 
stresses cannot be developed in the layers close to the 
wall because of an early quench and correspondingly high 
relaxation times. However, according to eq. (4.2.2), there 
will be a considerable contribution of the optical counter-
part of the first normal stress difference to the total

birefringence in the hotter inner layers of the sampie, where 
it will find enough time to be developed. In fact, with the 
Leonov model of a viscoelastic fluid (Section 2.6), suitably 
adjusted to a manifold of rheological data produced by 
wales 19 ) 27) for the polystyrene used, the mentioned authors 
have shown that indeed a maximum in the first normal stress 
difference must be created at a certain distance from the sur-
face by this mechanism. This is shown in Fig. 4.6 for eight 
different times equally spaced between zero and 2,5 s from the 
moment that the wall of a duct of rectangular cross-section of 
large aspect ratio (w = 7,5 and 2 b = 0,2 cm) is quenched from 
503 K to 323 K (average speed of the fluid U = 12 cm/s). If for 
the same model the time-derivatives (in eqs. 2.6.13) are omit-
ted so that the first normal stress difference belonging to the 
momentary shear stress is created immediately, the dashed lines 
are obtained for the respective times. This result is of parti-
cular interest since the maxima are predicted to occur at larger 
distances from the surface corresponding to temperatures 
weil above the glass-transition temperature. This fact will 
be used in the final discussion at the end of Section 
4.2.2.3. 
4.2.2.2 Boundary Layer Approach to Mould Filling. 21 ) 28) 
For the treatment of heat transfer a penetration depth 
6 is introduced. It is assumed that within the distance 6 
from the wall heat convection in the direction of the main 
flow (z-direction) is disregardable due to an extremely 
slow or stagnant movement of the fluid. Particularly for the 
treatment of heat transfer the further assumption is made 
that in the core of the mould a parabolic velocity distri-
bution is valid so that this fluid velocity becomes zero on 
both sides just at a distance 6 from the wall. At an arbi-
trary distance z from the gate the following differential 
equation for the growth of 6 is assumed.

influenee of a diminishing duet height (due to the layer growth) 
is disregarded. This forms an ineonsisteney, sinee the in-
ereasing shear stress whieh is also a eonsequenee of the dimi-
nishing duet height, is used to explain the birefringenee maxi-
ma. The eonsequenees of this ineonsistaney are not very far 
reaehing. This ean be shown as follows: 
435 

At constant filling rate the mean velocity v depends on 
the thickness of the stagnant layer. The corresponding heat 
transfer coefficient is, according to eg. (4.2.4), proportional 
to (H- ö)-1/3 ~ H-1 / 3 (1+ö/3H). At the same time, for a Newto-
nian fluid the increase of the shear stress is proportional to 
(H-ö)-2 ~ H-2 (1+2ö/H) (cf. eg. (1.1.52)). For a non-Newtonian 
fluid this increase is a little less. Anyhow, the change in 
the heat transfer coefficient is much less than the one in the 
shear stress at the stagnant layer surface. In fact, if ö/H = 0,1, 
the shear stress at the boundary of the layer is increased by 
about 20%, whereas the he at transfer coefficient is increased 
only by 3,3%. In addition, the increase of the birefringence 
is exaggerated by the influence of normal stresses (see eg. 
(4.2.2)). 
As a next stept the terms in eg. (4.2.3) should be dis-
cussed. The term on the left side of this eguation gives the 
heat flowing to the mould wall per units of time and 
area. (Temperature gradients in the z-direction are of no 
importance in the stagnant layer.) The first term on the 
right side describes the heat released by the polymer (per 
units of time and areal, if the stagnant layer grows with 
a speed d6/dt*). The second term on the right side of eg.

Substituting for 6+ this relation into eq. (4.2.5) one ob-
tains an equation similar to eg. (4.2.3), but without the 
last two terms of eq. (4.2.3). Apparently, the first term 
on the right side of eq. (4.2.3) also contains a heat trans-
fer coefficient h~ due to the displacement of the boundary 
in growth direction whieh is effective beeause of the steep 
temperature gradient in the layer between 6 and 6+.

distance from the gate further dimensionless groups are 
used. First of all one recognizes 
Br 
(4.2.9) 
which is the Brinkman number, characteristic for the influ-
ence of frictional heat production. From the experiments 
of Wales et al. one learns that pI and v are practically 
constant during injection (see Fig. 4.7). As a consequence, 
Br can be considerd as a characteristic (constant) number.

eq. (4.2.3) becomes:

In searching for the distribution of the ultimate 
layer thickness in the z-direction, one has to put eq. 
(4.2.1), viz.: 
t/t i 
= (1 -1;), 
(4.2.15) 
into eq. (4.2.7) and use this expression in eq. (4.2.14). 
In this way ~ becomes a function of 1; only. However, since 
the stress-optical rule is assumed to be valid down to the 
glass-transition temperature T , which is considerably 
g 
lower than T~, one has to calculate the layer thickness 
at which the glass-temperature is reached at the end of 
5 o 
the mould filling procedure. Since T 
lies between T 
and

4.2.2.3 Comparison with Experiment and Discussion. 
One can easily show that the function given by 
eq. (4.2.18) has a maximum at a value of 
~ larger than 
0,12. This rather nicely agrees with the findings by Wales, 
as shown in Fig. 4.4. For a more quantitative comparison, 
however, one needs the technical data from the paper by 
Wales et al •• These data are given in Table 4.1. If we 
choose as the stagnation temperature T~ = 1800 C, one finds 
with a Fourier number of 0,353 that the Brinkman number Br 
becomes 3,52.*) With these data eq. (4.2.18) gives the distribu-
tion 0o(z), as shown in Fig.4.8 by curve 11. Curve 111 is ob-
tained, if T~ is put equal Tg • It goes without saying that 
curve 111 represents an unrealistic lower limit for °0 , In fact, 
for the calculation of this curve it is assumed that the fluid 
possesses the relatively low viscosity ni 
(corresponding to 
the injection temperature T.) even at temperatures close 
J. 
to Tg , where its viscosity is assumed to change abruptly to 
infinity. By this extreme assumption the convection comes up 
as close as possible. At the same time the over-estimate of 
the retarding influence of frictional heat on the layer growth 
becomes particularly strong. On the other hand, curve I is cal-
culated, if in eq. (4.2.3) the terms hll(z) (Ti-T~) and P'Hv are 
omitted (pure penetration or "rolling-down" case). Doubtlessly, 
curve I forms the upper limit for °0 , since any influence 
of flow and convection is eliminated. Obviously, the choice 
of T~ is not very critical: If T~ is somewhere between Ti 
and Tg , also the calculated layer thickness, corresponding 
to this choice, is somewhere between the limiting cases.

treatment should be applied to the problem of mould filling.*) 
In ref. 28 )a discussion has been given of the 
, 
influence of various parameters on the layer thickness. 
Since Ti -T9, is considered as a thermo-rheological parameter 
of the polymer, it will remain constant, when Ti or Tm are 
varied. Parameter Gg is solely influenced by a change in Tm 
*) Footnote: Very recently H. van Wijngaarden, J.F. Dijksman 
and P. Wesseling have carried out a very accurate calcula-
tion, solving energy and momentum equation simultaneously 
for a suitable power law fluid with exponential temperature 
dependence 32 ). The results of these authors support the 
above expressed opinion, as far as the stagnant boundary 
layer is concerned. 
443 

If Tm is chosen only slightly lower than Tg , one expects 
a very low thickness of the freeze-off layer. With this 
choice, however, one encounters problems with releasing 
the moulded subject from the mould. On the other hand, a 
high value of Ti causes Gi to be rather small. (Tm cannot 
be increased above Tg ). A look on eq. (4.2.18) shows that in 
this case the exponential term becomes close to unity even 
at relatively low va lues of s, which means a rather large 
reduction of the steady state layer thickness given by the 
front factor. At the same time, a relatively low height of 
the birefringence maxima can be expected, since (shear) 
stresses are low at high injection temperatures. Another 
reduction of layer thickness can in principle be achieved 
by a reduction of the injection time. However, as the Fourier 
number occurs in the form of its cubic root, only extremely 
short injection times may be effective. An accompanying 
increase of frictional heat (increase of the Brinkman number) 
may be more effective. However, taking into ac count the limi-
tations imposed on injection pressure and injection time, one 
can guess that frictional heat will be of importance only with 
moulding of small articles. 
Another point of great interest is the following: 
The distances of the birefringence maxima from the outer sur-
face of the injection moulded sample, as derived from Fig. 4.4, 
are about twice those calculated as 00 with the aid of eq. 
(4.2.18) (see Fig. 4.8, curve 11). This means that the distan-
ces of the birefringence maxima from the sample surface are 
even larger than the layer thicknesses 00 calculated with 
the aid of the simple penetration theory (curve I in Fig.4.8), 
which are considered to form an upper bound since heat convec-
tion is disregarded. At this point we are reminded of the work 
by Isayev and Hieber25 ) mentioned above. These authors find for 
locations far enough-from the gate, where the penetration theory 
is approximately valid (see the basic presuppositions for 
their calculations), a very good agreement between experi-
mental and theoretical results with respect to the height 
of the birefringence maxima as well as their distance from 
the surface. Closer to the gate, however, the maxima found 
444 

by Wales were higher and at a smaller distance from the 
surface. This is completely in agreement with the ex-
pectations, since Isayev and Hieber were not able to take 
into account the influence of heat convection in the flow 
direction. As a .consequence of this latter influence the 
situation near the gate is more close to the steady state 
situation in which the time lag between first normal stress 
difference and shear stress must loose its influence. As 
an illustration for the success of the calculations by 
Isayev and Hieber a figure from the recent paper by Isayev, 
Hieber and Crouthamel 14 ) is reproduced as Fig. 4.9. In this 
figure for the conditions of an injection moulding experi-
ment of these authors, the experimental birefringence distri-

bution over the cross-section of the sampie (open circles) 
is compared with the calculated distributions for the "in-
elastic" case (time derivatives omitted in the constitutive 
equation of Leonov) (curve 1 ) , the full response of Leonov's 
model at the moment of cessation of flow (curve 2) and at 
infinite time after cessation of flow (curve 3) . The influence 
of stress relaxation is obvious particularly in the core of 
the sampie. From this very illustrative picture one learns that 
especially in the core some other reasons for birefringence 
must be present (Cf. the discussion in Section 4.2.1). 
Finally it should be mentioned that several authors 
have described a more detailed flow birefringence profile 
over the cross-section of the sampie, where accept for the 
above mentioned main peak a minimum is found much closer to 
the surface and another upsweep right into the surface. Such 
a profile is shown in Fig. 4.10, as taken from the work by 
33) 
M.R. Kamal and V. Tan 
. (In this work also the birefrin-
gence n 33-n22 in a plane perpendicular to the flow direction 
is investigated -
see open symbols.) For this effect an ex-
planation given by Z. Tadmor34 )may be proper. This author 
ascribes the maximum in the skin to compressional flow 
occurring just behind the advancing flow front. In fact, 
the speed of the flow front corresponds with the average 
speed of the fluid, 
being considerably lower than the 
maximum speed of fully developed flow in a rectangular 
duct. As a consequence, fluid particles arr'iving in the 
centre of the duct at the flow front, experience the 
above mentioned one-sided compression which causes a con-
siderable birefringence effect. According to Tadmor the fluid 
in the flow front reaches the wall in a kind of rollfng move-
ment. As this fluid layer is not immediately sheared after 
its arrival at the wall there will be a short period of 
rest, in which the cooling advances rel~tively fast, in the 
absence of a developed heat convection in the z-direction 
(cf. the remark at the occasion of the introduction of h ll 
according to eq. (4.2.4)). The length of the said period of 
rest may be equated to the time t 
= 2H/v needed by the 
p 
advancing front to move over a distance equal to the height

distance, a fully developed flow profile is expected to be 
established in a very viscous fluid (at negligible influence

where m is a factor smaller than unity. It appears that,thi$ 
distance is at least one order of magnitude "small"er than 
the 6-values calculated with the aid of eq. (4.2.18). This 
fact explains, why the main maximum is separated by a mini-
mum from the extremely narrow maximum in the skin. 
Summarizing one may conclude that crucial progress 
has been made in the recent past in the interpretation of 
birefringence patterns in injection moulded parts of amor-
447 

phous polymers. One may also expect a proper treatment of 
another important flow geometry, vize that of disk moulding, 
where ne ar the gate a much more extended zone with a stagnant 
layer according to the steady state approach can be expected. 
On the other hand, in these mouldings extensional flow in 
tangential direction is present as an extra complication. Oue 
to subsequent stress relaxation in the core, however, the 
pertinent contribution to the birefringence in the ejected 
sample may be relatively small.

Appendix A: Linear Visco-Elasticity 
A.1 Hooke's Law in Complex Notation 
If Hooke's law is written for a shear experiment, one 
has: 
o = G Y 
• •• (A.1) 
where 0 is the shear stress, G the shear modulus and y the 
shear (= tan u, u being the angle by which a material plane 
which is originally perpendicular to the direction of shear, 
is tilted by the deformation). 
Complex notation is useful, if the shear is sinusoidally 
varying with time, viz.: 
* 
iwt 
Y = Yo e 
••• (A.2) 
where w is the circular frequency. In the case of linear beha-
viour of the material under investigation also the shear stress 
which causes this deformation, is sinusoidally varying. There 
will be a positive phase difference between shear stress and 
shear, since the shear stress must precede the shear. So one 
finds: 
* 
(J 
= (J o 
(A.3) 
Now we can define the complex shear modulus: 
i sin ö) = 
= G' + i 
G" 
• •• (A. 4) 
451 

A comparison with eq. (A.2) shows that G' governs a stress 
in phase with y. It is called the storage modulus. An interpre-
tation of G", which is accompanied with a stress 900 out of 
phase, will be given after the definition of the complex vis-
cosity. Por this quantity one has: 
= (l/iw) G* = (G"/w) -
i(G'/w) = 
= n' -
i n" 
Using eq. (A.4) one obtains for the real part of the 
shear stress: 
cr = Yo (G' cos wt -
G" sin wt) 
(A.5) 
(A. 6) 
Prom the real part of eq. (A.2) one learns that this equation 
can also be written as: 
cr = G'y + (G"/w)y 
(A. 7) 
With eq. (A.5) one finally has: 
o 
G'y + n'y 
(A. 8) 
Prom this interpretation it becomes clear why G" 
is called 
the loss modulus. The phase angle 6 is called the loss angle, 
as it is given by 
(G"/G') 
tan 6 
(Cf. the last term but one of eq. (A.4).) 
The same experimental facts can also be expressed in 
terms of the dynamic shear compliance, viz.: 
J' -
i J" 
452 
(A. 9) 
(A. 10) 

with J' being the storage compliance and J" 
being the loss 
compliance. One can easily determine the components of the 
dynamic shear compliance from those of the dynamic shear 
modulus and vice versa:

A.2 Stress Relaxation and Creep 
Besides the dynamic oscillatory measurements there are 
two other standard experiments for the characterization of 
the linear viscoelastic behaviour, viz. stress relaxation and 
creep. In the first experiment at time zero a step is 
applied in the strain (yo or e:o). 
The strain is kept constant 
afterwards. In the second experiment at time zero' a step is 
applied in the stress (00) which is then kept constant for 
the remainder of the time. For the tensile experiment this 
means that, in principle, the force, which is applied to the 
sample, must continuously be adjusted to the decreasing cross-
section in order to keep the actual stress constant. This 
measure is important if the sample keeps flowing under the 
influence of the stress (or "tention"). If this is not the 
453 

case, experiments in the linear regime of response are con-
veniently carried out at constant load, since only small 
relative elongations are found, so that the consequence of the 
decrease of the cross-section is a second order effect. 
At this point, the nature of linear viscoelasticity 
should clearly be articulated: The time dependent relaxing 
stress must be proportional to theapplied step in strain 
at every moment. The time dependent strain must be pro-
portional to the applied step in stress at every moment. 
This also means that the respective time dependences are 
independent of the heights of the initiating steps. They 
can be expressed by the time dependent relaxation moduli 
G(t) or E(t) and by the time dependent creep compliances J(t) 
or D(t) respectively. It goes almost without saying that 
these simple laws are limiting laws for small strains or 
stresses, respectively. 
These linear laws are perspicuously incorporated 
into Boltzmann's superposition principle. According to 
this principle one finds for more general histories in strain 
or stress, if only the cases of shearing are taken as examples: 
t 
o(t) 
f G(t-t') y(t')dt' 
(A. 1 3 ) 
and 
t 
y (t) 
f J (t-t' ) ö(t')dt' 
(A. 14) 
In other words, at a previous time t' increments of strain 
or stress are envisaged, which cause, according to th€ 
standard relaxation or creep experiments, the ~ollowing 
differential contributions at present time t: 
do(t) 
G(t-t') dy(t') 
and 
dy(t) 
J(t-t') do(t'), 
454 
(A.13a) 
(A.14a) 

respectively. All these contributions are simply super im-
posed as expressed by the above integrals. 
With the help of these equations we can answer several 
quest ions of interest. These questions are treated in the 
subsequent section. 
A.3 Elastico-Viscous Flow and Recovery 
An experiment, in which the sample is loaded at 
time t = 0 and unloaded at time t 1 , is sketched in Fig. A.1 
for the ca se of shearing. In the upper part of the figure, 
the applied shear stress is given in a block diagram. After 
a transient situation, persisting for some time after the 
moment of loading, one obtains the situation of steady shear 
flow (if the sample is a rubberlike fluid). During steady 
shear flow the shear strain increases linearly with time. 
If at time t 1 , which was chosen long enough in order to 
allow for steady flow, the sample is unloaded, one observes

a partial recovery Ye ' With the aid of Boltzmann's super-
position principle one can easily show that this recovery 
Ye is equal to the intercept at the ordinate axis, which 
is found when the straight line for steady flow is extrapolated 
back to time zero. But not only this "equilibrium value" 
(subscript e) should be considered. All values of Y obtained 
during the above mentioned transition and the subsequent re-
covery are simply related. If the contribution to y(t), 
which is caused by the steady flow, is given by (oo/n)t, 
where 0 0 is the initial step in shear stress and n is the 
steady shear viscosity, one can express this fact as follows: 
Yr(t*) 
••• (A.15) 
where on the right side the subscript r indicates that the 
backward deformation (recovery) is counted positive and 
t* is the time elapsing from t 1 onwards, whereas on the left 
side the time scale t starts with the loading at t = O. 
The evidence for this relation is easily furnished by the 
superposition principle. For the purpose, one has only to 
assurne that the loading by a positive 0 0 persists also at 
times t 
> t 1 , but is compensated by an equal load of reverse 
sign, vize -00 , which has been added at t 
= t 1 • In other 
words, these loads are superimposed. The same holds, accor-
ding to the superposition principle, for the respective re-
sponses by the material. This fact is expressed by eq. (A.15). 
A next step would be to express the steady shear vis-
cosity in terms of the relaxation modulus G(t), where for 
a fluid G(t) must vanish for t 
+ =. A procedure with a 
similar goal, vize to relate y 
= J ° to G(t), must yet 
e 
e 0 
, 
be postponed. In the steady state of flow one has y = q = con-
stant. One can also imagine a ramp function in shear strain 
y(t) 
qt, which starts at t 
= O. For this type of experi-
ment H. Giesekus 1) has coined the name "stressing experiment". 
From eq. (A.13) one obtains for this experiment: 
456 
t 
a(t) = q J G(t-t') dt' 
o 

After replacing t-t I by a new variable Tone obtains: 
t 
o(t) = q J G(T) dT 
o 
(A. 1 6 ) 
A transient stress is defined by this relation. However, as 
soon as steady state is reached, o(t) becomes a constant 000' 
The viscosity n = 0oo/q is the same as in the creep experiment 
for the steady state of flow: 
n = (ooo!q) = J G(T) dT 
o 
••• (A.17) 
In order to calculate the recovery Ye or the equivalent 
equilibrium shear compliance J , one has first to find the 
e 
connection between eqs. (A.13) and (A.14). For the purpose the 
first of these equations must be integrated by parts. After that 
one obtains: 
t 
o(t) = G(O) y(t) + 
! [aG(t-t')/dt] y(t')dt' 
(A. 1 8) 
For the derivation of this equation fading memory is assumed. 
This means that G(oo) = O. The advantage of this equation is 
that it can be used also, if the time derivative of the de-
formation has not been smooth in the past. This situation 
is encountered in the case of the creep experiment, where at 
time zero suddenly a constant shear stress 00 is imposed. 
Before that time also the shear strain y is zero. At that 
time, however, it starts rising sharply. 
If at time zero a unit shear stress is applied, the 
lower limit of the integral in eq. (A.18) becomes zero. At the 
same time y(t) must be identified with the shear compliance 
J(t). In this way one obtains: 
t 
1 = G(O) J(t) + f 
[aG(t-t')!at] J(t')dt' 
o

It is easily reeognized that the eq. (A.19) ean also 
be written as:

By the substitution t -
T = T' one obtains asymmetrie 
version: 
t

These are the two forms of the eonvolution integral whieh 
replaees the simple relation: 
G

.•• (A.22a) 
whieh holds for elastie solids. (Cf. also relation (A.10) 
for the dynamie oseillatory behaviour.) One ean see that the 
relation between G(t) und J(t) is mueh more eomplieated in 
the ease of viseoelastieity. If e.g. G(t) is given, J(t) ean 
only be obtained, if the linear integral eqaation (A.22) (Vol-
terra equation of the first kind) is solved for J(t) • 
However, there is a limiting ease, whieh ean be treated 
here. For the purpose, J(t) is written as foliows: 
J(t) = J -J ~(t) + tin 
e 
e 
••• (A.23) 
with ~(O) = 1 and ~(~) = O. This funetion ~(t) deseribes 
the transition from the beginning of the ereep experiment 
to the steady state. The expression (A.23) is inserted 
into eq. (A.2 2) :

••• (A.24) 
The forth term on the left side of this equation is due 
to the fact that in the last term of (A.23) time t has 
to be replaced - as in the last term but one - by the 
difference (t-T). 
In eq. (A.24) there is only one difficult term, viz. 
the one containing the function ~(t). In order to calculate 
the equilibrium shear compliance Je' however, we do not 
need this term. As a matter of fact, we can choose t large 
enough to make this term practically vanish. - Finally, we 
shall take the limit.of t 
=~, so that this procedure is 
justified. - If t is large enough, one has the following 
situation: For small values of the integration variable 
the argument (t-T) of ~ is still very large, so that ~ 
vanishes practically. At these values of T the relaxation 
modulus G(T) is clearly finite. This situation of a prac-
tically vanishing ~ can prevail, until G(T) has, with 
increasing T, become so small that it also vanishes prac-
tically. Finally, if (t-T) becomes small enough for a 
finite 
~(t-T), the value of G(T) is all the more negligible. 
If the term containing ~ is removed, one obtains from 
eq. (A.24) after some rearrangement: 
t 
t 
= t-(t/n) f G(T)dT + (l/n) f T G(T)dT 
o 
o 
In the limit of t = ~ the first two terms on the right 
, 
side cancel out, because of eq. (A.17). One finally 
obtains: 
00 
J 
= (1/n 2 ) f T G(T) dT 
e 
0 
••• (A.25) 
459 

One can easily show that the integral in eq. (A.25) 
represents the free energy of the system per unit of 
volume and at unit shear rate, as stored in the steady 
state of shear flow. In fact, one has at constant rate of 
shear q with y = q.t: 
q2 f G(t) t dt = f G(y!q)y dy = F, 
o 
o 
where F is the free energy per unit volume. To understand 
this equation one has to imagine that flow starts with 
q = constant at y = O. The product G(y/q)y is equal to 
the relaxing shear stress a(y) of the fluid, the diffe-
rential of the free energy being dF = a(y)dy. From eqs. 
(A.17), (A.25) and (A.26) it follows that Je after steady 
shear flow is the ratio of the stored free energy over 
(A. 26) 
the square of the shear stress. With the aid of Lodge's 
rubberlike liquid theory an alternative interpretation will 
be possible. 
Only recently, several authors have shown the way for 
a practicable calculation of the total recoverable strain 
(e.g. shear strain Yr) after a general strain history. As a 
special case, which is very attractive from an experimental 
point, the "mixed" experiment of a stressing experiment and 
subsequent total recovery will be considered. According 
to H.M. Laun2 ) (and others) the total strain (after time t) 
can be subdivided into two parts, viz.: 
y (t) 
y (t) + y (t) 
r 
v 
where yv(t) is the irreversible part of the strain and 
Yr(t) is that part of the strain (at time t of the strain 
history) which is recoverable. The latter term means that 
Yr is that part of y(t) which will recover, if at t flow 
(A. 27) 
is stopped 
(and the stress, which is needed for this flow, 
460 

is removed*)). No indication, however, is given (or expected) 
about the time which is needed for this recovery itself. As 
a next step, eq. (A.27) is differentiated with respect to 
time. For the expression, which one obtains in this way, one 
needs the following relation: 
••• (A.28) 
where alt) is the momentary (shear) stress and n 
is the steady 
state viscosity, which is just a constant according eq. (A.17) for 
a linear fluid. In order to understand eq. (A.28), one has to look 
at Fig. A.1. In this figure the dashed straight lines just 
furnish yv(t) for the creep experiment. One notices that the 
contribution to yv(t) in a certain time interval is independent 
of the question whether a steady situation has been reached 
or not within this time interval. 
If the differentiated eq. (A.27) is rearranged so that 
Yr is on the left side, one obtains with the aid of eq. (A.28): 
• •• (A. 29) 
Integrating this equation with the assumption that the strain 
is zero at t = 0, one obtains: 
1 t 
= y(t) -
-
f a(t') dt' 
n 0 
One can rewrite this equation as: 
1 t 
= y(t) -
f G(t' )y(t-t') dt' 
n 0 
••• (A.30) 
••• (A.31) 
*) Footnote: With shear this means that only the shear stress 
is removed. The constraints caused by the solid walls between 
which the fluid is sandwiched, persist. 
461 

The identity of the integrals on the right sides of these 
equations is easily varyfied, if the equation 
t 
f a(t') dt' 
o 
t 
= f G(t')y(t-t') dt' 
o 
is differentiated with respect to t and the condition y(O) = 0 
is used. By this procedure one arrives at eq. (A.13). In the 
following the treatment is specialized on the stressing experi-
ment. For this experiment one obtains with y(t) = q • t: 
y (t) 
r 
Using eq. 
t 
t 
= q.t - q.t f G(t') dt' + ~ f G(t')t'dt' 
non 
0 
(A.16) and the equation: 
F(t) 
2 t 
= q 
f G(t') t' dt' 
o 
one arrives at: 
yr(t) = q.t -
t a(t)/n 
+ F(t)/nq 
(A. 32) 
(A.33) 
This equation shows, how the shear strain which is recoverable 
after a time t of stressing, is related to the stored free 
energy and the shear stress bUild-up. Aversion of (A.33), valid 
for the recovery after a stressing experiment in elongation, 
will be used later. 
In general, the behaviour in extension is'not easily 
correlated to that of shear. The reason can be demonstrated 
for an elastic solid (without time effects). For such a 
material the relation between Young's modulus E, shear mo-
dulus G and compression modulus K reads: 
E = 
9GK 
G + 3K 
(A. 34) 
462 

For a "soft elastic solid" like a rubber, however, 
one finds that K is about two decades larger than G. 
Forces which can bring about a rather large strain (shear 
or elongation) will in general not suffice for a noticeable 
volume change. For this group of materials eq. (A.34) re-
duces to 
E 
= 
3 G 
... (A.35) 
For the same materials the tensile compliance D is related 
to the shear compliance J by 
D 
= J/3. 
••• (A.36) 
Sometimes these materials are called "incompressible". 
However, it is rather the smallness of E and G than the 
large value of K, which causes the described behaviour. 
What is valid for a "soft elastic solid", is cer-
tainly also applicable to a rubberlike liquid. As a con-
sequence, eqs. (A.35) and (A.36) also hold for the 
corresponding time dependent quantities. This means that 
the correlation between the time dependent properties in 
shear and extension becomes very easy. In particular, one 
obtains instead of eq. (A.17): 
n = f E(T) dT = 3 fG(T) dT = 3n 
• •• (A. 37) 
o 
0 
where n is the Trouton viscosity for steady elongational 
flow and n is the Newtonian shear viscosity.

A.4 Some Comments with Respect to the Interconversion 
of Material Functions 
From the work by F.R. Schwarzl3 ) a diagram is taken which 
is reproduced he re as Fig. A.2. Actually, this figure shows 
the possibilities for numerical interconversion, to be dis-
cussed here a little later. For the moment, this diagram 
merely serves as a guide. In Section A.1 the interconversion 
between G' and G" on one hand and J' and J" on the other hand 
was discussed. This is actually a trivial matter. The intercon-
version between G(t) and J(t) has been discussed in Section A.3 
for a special case. The question-mark in the diagram of Fig. A.3 
points to the fact that a useful, error bound, numerical inter-
conversion for the general case has not yet been found. In 
fact, the existence of general relations like eqs. (A.21) and 
(A.22) does not mean that, if, say, G(t) is given within a 
certain time range by experiment, also J(t) can be calculated 
with known accuracy (which has been called "error bound" by 
Schwarzl) from the experimental values of G(t).

Examples for other exact interconversion formulae will 
be given here for the relations between G' and G" on one hand 
and G(t) on the other hand. 
If in eq. (A.13) for t-t' a new variable s is substituted, 
one obtains: 
a(t) = f G(s) y(t-s)ds 
o 
(A.38) 
If Y is assumed to vary sinusoidally with time according to 
eq. (A.2), one obtains for the real part of this equation: 
y = Yo cos wt , 
and by differentiation with respect to time: 
y = -
w Yo 
sin 
wt. 
If the argument (t-s) is substituted for t in the latter 
equation and the obtained expression is developed as follows: 
-w Yo sin w(t-s) = -uIYo[sin wt cos ws -
cos wt sin ws] 
and inserted into eq. (A.38), one obtains:

From these equations it appears that, in principle, also G' 
and G" etc. must be interrelated (Kramers-KrOnig4) relations). 
The usefulness of these equations, however, appears to 
be rather restricted. As a matter of fact, for the calculation of, 
say, G' (w) at one value of w one should know in principle the 
whole curve for G(t) from t = 0 to t = ~. In reality, G(t) 
will only be measured within a certain experimental window. This 
will turn out to be the reason, why numerical interconversion 
procedures must be based on another principle. 
At the end of this introduction the uninformed reader 
may ask, why these interconversions are necessary. One reason 
for the necessity of interconversion is that for every type of 
measurement a certain range in the time variable (w or t) is 
found, where these measurements can be carried out successfully. 
466 

For instance, it often turns out that the dynamic moduli or 
compliances can conveniently be measured at w-values which 
do not correspond to times t = 1/w , where the transient 
quantities G(t) and J(t) can be determined. By interconversion 
the experimental window is broadened in this way. Intercon-
version is also useful, if the qualities of several types of 
measurements should be checked against each other. 
A.5 Mechanical Spectra 
In textbooks or handbooks on visco-elasticity and rheolo-
gy5) 6) two models have become very popular for the description 
of elementary mechanisms, viz. the Maxwell model and the 
Kelvin-Voigt model. In Fig. A.3 these models are sketched. As 
can be seen from this figure, the Maxwell model consists of 
aspring and a dashpot in series, whereas the Kelvin-Voigt 
model consists of aspring and a dashpot in parallel. 
In characterizing the Maxwell model (sometimes also called 
Maxwell element), one finds that the Maxwell model contains 
an internal variable xi which is the extension of the spring. 
If the total extension of the model is calle'd y., the (irrever-
~ 
sible) displacement of the plunger in the dashpot becomes 
Yi-xi' The force 0i on the total model is equal to Gixi where 
Gi is the spring constant. This force is also equal to 
n.d(y.-xi)/dt, where n. is the friction constant of the dashpot. 
~ 
~ 
~ 
This holds since spring and dashpot are in series. From this 
consideration one obtains:

where Ti = ni/Gi is the relaxation time of the model. In fact,

for Yi = Yo = const., as in the relaxation experiment, one 
obtains from eq. (A.44): 
-t/T. 
Ci i = Yo Gi e 
l 
(A.45) 
From this equation the relaxation modulus G(t) becomes: 
G(t) 
(A.46) 
If a sinusoidally varying Yi 
Yo cos (wt-6i ) is assumed, one 
obtains from eq. (A.44) with 0i = 00 cos wt (cf. eqs. (A.2) 
and (A.3)):

it is easy to derive the expressions for G' and G" for the

Equations for J' and J" are obtained with the aid of eqs. 
(A.11), when Gi = 1/Ji 
is inserted. As a final remark it 
should be noted that the given derivations do not show that 
the obtained results are valid for stresses and (shear) moduli. 
As a matter of fact, these derivations are valid for the 
stretching forces (not tensile stresses) on the Maxwell element. 
It will even be more difficult to explain, why these derivations 
for stretching forces should hold also for shear stresses 
(or better: shear stress increments of a single Maxwell element). 
The evidence for this validity can only follow from a full-
fledged constitutive equation of tensorial character, as given 
e.g. by Lodge's rubberlike liquid model (with one relaxation 
time), as will be shown in the main text of this monograph. 
In particular, it will be shown that, in the differential eq. 
(A.44) the ordinary differential coefficient with respect to 
time will have to be replaced by an "objective" time deriva-
tive which, only in the limit of small displacements, reduces to 
the ordinary derivative. 
In a completely analogous way one can derive equations 
for the Kelvin-Voigt model. In this case we do not need an 
internal variable. The differential equation corresponding to 
eq. (A.44) reads: 
Its solution for the creep experiment with 0i 
and Yi(O) = 0 reads:

In Fig. A.4 the normalized courses of G' and G", as well as 
of J' and J" are depicted. The general trends agree with those 
found experimentallyon real materials. The experimental curves, 
however, show many details not contained in the curves of 
Fig. A.4. 
If e.g. the courses for G' and G" are interpreted 
as the properties of a rubberlike liquid, the damping maxi-
mum at WT i = 1 can be identified with the liquid-to-rubber 
transition. In fact G' levels off at this value of wand remains 
constant at higher frequency just as with a cross-linked rubber. 
Real materials, however, show a second increase of the moduli 
at further increasing frequency, indicating the rubber-to-glass 
transition. Another feature of experimental curves is ~hat 
the transitions cover a much broader range of frequencies. 
From liquid to glass one finds in general about twelve decades 
in frequency. 
To cope with these facts, composite models have been 
proposed. A number of n Maxwell elements in parallel (genera-
lized Maxwell-vHechert model) furnishes the following relaxa-
tion modulus (e.g. in shear):

With these equations one can describe practically 
(A.64) 
every linear viscoelastic behaviour, if the suitable "spectra" 
are chosen. For the generalized Maxwell model one arrives at 
a (line) spectrum of discrete relaxation times, for the gene-
ralized Voigt model at a (line) spectrum of discrete retardation 
times. For a viscoelastic fluid the friction constants of all 
dashpots of the generalized Maxwell model 
must be finite 
(i.e. all relaxation times must be finite). In the corresponding 
Voigt model one spring constant must be zero (corresponding to 
an infinite retardation time). For a viscoelastic solid 
one friction constant of the generalized Maxwell model must 
be infinite (infinite relaxation time). For the corresponding 
Voigt model all retardation times must be finite. From this 
consideration it may be deduced that the two types of spectra 
have, for the same material, quite different shapes, but must 
be interconvertible. So far, molecular theories are known 
which furnish discrete relaxation time spectra. 
For many practical purposes, however, it is convenient 
to introduce continuousspectra. In fact, the spacings between 
discrete relaxation times can be assumed to be really very 
small in an actual material. In order to describe the (mental) 
transition to a continuous spectrum, we introduce as an inter-
mediate step the following function: 
F(T) dT 
= 
G(T)d i 
(A. 65) 
where di is the number of (almost equal) discrete relaxation 
times in the interval T,T + dT. The function F(T) contains 
the density of relaxation mechanisms at the relaxation time T. 
Because in practice one usually prefers a logarithmic time 
scale, the next step is to introduce a function H(T) = TF(T) 
which has bluntly been called the "relaxation time spectrum". 
With this definition one has:

J g stands for an instantaneous compliance, corresponding to 
a retardation time zero. Instantaneous deformations do not 
oceur with polymerie fluids, as will become obvious in the 
text of this monograph at various occasions. 
Exaet interconversion formulae between the relaxation 
speetrum H(T) and the retardation spectrum L(T) have been 
given5). As we shall see later, however, it turns out to be 
very trieky to determine a spectrum from experimental data 
by inverting any of the just mentioned six equations. As a 
eonsequenee, under practieal circumstances hardly anyone will 
ask for the conversion of such a spectrum into its antipode. 
In the text of this monograph, only the relaxation time 
speetrum will play a role. In fact, only equations relating 
the stress tensor to the strain history, in the sense of 
eq. (A.13), have extensively been proposed so far in polymer 
melt rheology. 
It seems that there is a strong feeling among theorists 
that objeetive equations of the type of eq. (A.14) are not 
sueeessful in polymer melt rheology. In particular, 
great diffieulties would arise in the explanation of the 
linear stress-optical rule. This furnishes an explanation, 
why in the following the description of conversion methods 
will be restricted mainly to equations of the type of eqs. 
(A.67), (A.68) and (A.69) and their analogues for tensile 
experiments (containing E(t), E' and Eil instead of G(t), G' 
and G" and being related by eq. (A.35)). As a consequence, 
the retardation time spectrum L(T) will not be used very 
often in this monograph.

A.6 Interconversion Formulae 
Based on the Relaxation Time Spectrum 
As F.R. Schwarzl and L.C.E. Struik7 ) 
have pointed out, 
convenient algebraic interconversion formulae between a great 
number of material functions (see Fig. A.2) can be obtained on 
the basis of the assumption of a positive relaxation or retar-
dation time spectrum. In Fig. A.2 
for the functions on the 
right side a relaxation time spectrum must be assumed, for 
those on the left side a retardation time spectrum. The spectra 
must not be known explicitely. An additional advantage of the 
announced method is that the bound of the error can be given. 
As an example, equations will be discussed which replace 
the exact eqs. (A.42) and (A.43). For the purpose, we consider 
the "intensity functions", i.e. the factors of H(T), in eqs. 
(A.67), (A.68) and (A.69). We restrict ourselves to the case 
of a fluid, for which G vanishes. If one uses the variable 
e 
x = t/T = 1/WT, one can write the intensity functions for 
G(t), G' (w) and G" (w) as follows: 
G(t) 
-x 
(A. 73) 
e 
G' (w) 
1/(1+x2 ) 
(A. 74) 
G" (w) 
x/(1+x2 ) 
(A. 75) 
Notice the numerator of eq. (A.74). It is equal to one, since 
x = 1/WT. 
In Fig.A.5 these intensity functions are drawn on ~ouble 
logarithmic scales. Also the intensity function of G' (w)+G"(w), 
i.e. (1+x)/(1+x2 ) is inserted. The most primitive approximation 
for G(t) would now be: 
G(t) 
G' (w) with w 
1/t 
• •• (A. 76) 
The intensity function 
~(x,1) of the error 0 G(t)=G ' (1/t)-G(t) 
is given by:

Also this function is depicted in the figure. It is 
given by a dashed line. One observes that the function 
~(x,1) has lower values than the intensity function for 
G"(w), viz. x/(1+x2 ), at all values of x. This means that 
the integral

G(t) = 
f H(T)

• •• (A. 78) 
must be smaller than the one given by eg. (A.69). If it happens 
that, by the special shape of the relaxation time spectrum 
H (T), G" (w) is rather small compared with G' (w) at w = 1 /t, 
one learns that approximation (A.76·) is a rather good one, 
because the error 6 1G(t) must be even smaller than G"(1/t). 
This simple example illustrates the advantage of this 
approximation method. If it happens, however, that G"(w) 
476 

is not very small compared with G' (w) at w = 1ft, the 
approximation (A.76) is not useful. In this case, one needs 
a more complicated equation. A next step has been, to intro-
duce the approximation: 
G(at) 
~ G' (w) 
with w 
= 1ft 
••• (A.79) 
This equation contains an adjustable parameter a. The inten-
sity function for error 6G(at) = G' (1ft)-G(at) becomes: 
(A.80) 
If a is chosen smaller than one, all values of 
~(x,a) are 
smaller than those for 
~(x,1) over the whole log x axis. 
This change, however, is rather pronounced at small values 
of x, but disappears at sufficiently high values, where e-ax 
becomes disregardable. This is shown in Fig. A.6. (In the 
range of x-values, where 
~(x.a) becomes negative, a dashed

line is used.) In this way one can achieve that 
~(x,a) is 
smaller than the intensity function x/1+x2 of G"(1/t) byat 
least a factor a over the whole range of x. (In fact, 
4> (x,a)

x/(1+x2) 
'" x. With increasing x, the distance between 
x/(1+x2) and 4>(x,a) grows continously, irrespective of the 
chosen value of a, if a 
~ 1. 
In this way, Schwarzl and Struik arrived at the equation: 
G(0.48 t) '" GI(W) with w = 1ft 
••• (A.81) 
with the maximum absolute error of 
\15 G(0.48 t)\ < 0.48G"(w); 0.35 [GI(W)+G"(w)] 
• •• (A. 81 a) 
The semicolon between the two functions on the right means: 
Take the smaller one as the upper bound. (Cf. the position of 
the curve for (1+x)/(1+x2 ) in Fig. A.5.) Approximation (A.81) 
is clearly better than (A.76). 
Much better approximations are obtained, if the inten-
sity function e-ax of G(at) is approximated by a linear com-
bination of intensity functions of GI (w) and G"(ß.w), so that 
l. 
the difference between e-ax and the said linear combination 
becomes as small as possible. As an example, the following 
equation is reproduced: 
G(1.25 t) '" GI(W) -
0.5303 G"(0.5282w) 
0.021 G"(0.085w) + 0,042 G"(6.37w) 
••• (A.82) 
with w = 1/t and a maximum error of 0,016 G"(w). 
The conclusion can be drawn that a calculation of the rela-
xation modulus G(t) from measured values of GI (w) and G"(w) 
is always possible with a reasonable error, except for the 
case that G"(w) is much larger than G' (w). 
478 

As a matter of fact, calculations of J(t) from J' (w) 
and J"(w) appear to be easier than those of G(t) from 
G' (w) and G"(w) (see also Fig. A.2). 
Nevertheless, the latter 
calculations have been chosen here as examples, because a gene-
ralization of these calculations for other material functions, 
as based on a relaxation time spectrum, will be needed in this 
monograph. For those readers interested in more details of the 
general theory of linear viscoelasticity, the original litera-
ture has been cited. This type of calculations has been 
initiated by K. Ninomya and J.D. Ferry8). The highest per-
3) 
fection has been reached by F.R. Schwarzl 
. 
In that which follows, two other material functions will 
approximately be given as linear combination of values of 
G'(ßiw) and G"(ßiw). As a first step, these functions must 
be derived in terms of the relaxation time spectrum. First, 
we consider the shear stress bUild-up in the stressing 
experiment, vize in a flow history characterized by a ramp 
function in the shear strain starting at time zero. In other 
words, in a flow history in which at t = 0 a sudden jump is 
introduced in the shear rate, from zero to a certain constant 
value t = q. From eq. (A.16) one pbtains by introducing 
eq. (A.67) 
(after omission of Ge for our fluid systems): 
t 
+00 H(-r)e-,'/, 
0' (t ) = q f

0 -00

In a similar way one can find an expression ~or the 
free energy bUild-up F(t), if eq. (A.32) is used.

One can easily see that the "intensity functions" of 
these two functions read (F.H. Gortemaker9»:

For small values of x, the intensity function of a(t) becomes 
unity. At large va lues of x it behaves like 1/x. Similarly, 
the intensity function of 2F(t) has a constant value of unity 
in the limit of small x. At large values of x, however, 
it behaves like 1/x2. In Fig. A.7 
these intensity functions 
are plotted as curves <D and <t> near the intensi ty func-
tions of G' (w) and G" (w), given by curves @ and ®

respectively (see eqs. (A.74) and (A.75». Since only the 
intensity function of G' (w) behaves like those of a(t) and 
2F(t) at small va lues of x, one can conclude that, for 
short lapses of time, both functions are completely de-
scribed by G'(w). This remains true for 2F(t) also at large 
values of x, since only the intens,ity function of G' (w) 
behaves like1/x2 at these values of x. On the other hand, 
a(t) must be described by G"(w) at large times since only 
the intensity function of G"(w) behaves like 1/x at large 
values of x. 
Bearing in mind these facts one arrives at an approxi-
mation formula of the following type for the intensity 
function of a(t):

A very similar equation has originally been given by 
F.R. Schwarzl to J. Meissner10) in a personal communication. 
(Schwarzl hirnself prefers equations containing only positive 
signs!) F.H. Gortemaker calculated several slightly different 
equations too. They can be found in the original paper9). 
In an analogous way, using only terms of the type 
a/[1+(x/ß)2], Gortemaker also calculated express ions for 
2F(t), from which only one is given here as a representative: 
2 F(t) = q2 t 2 [0,939 G'(O,5w) -

as very satisfactory that 2F(t), as a stored free energy, 
can only be described in terms of the storage modulus G' (w). 
Insertion of eqs. (A.89) and (A.90) into eq. (A.33)

A.7 Calculation of the Relaxation Time Spectrum 
from Experimental Material Functions 
A spectrum is the result of the superposition of 
molecular relaxation (or retardation) processes. As a con-
sequence, it should be calculable in principle, from 
structural data of a material. In other words, one should 
be able to identify the mentioned processes and express them 
in terms of Maxwell (or VOigt) elements. Until the present 
time, however, this goal has been met only oeeasionally for 
processes in the glassy state of a pOlymer11 ). For polymerie 
melts, which form the main subject of this monograph, we 
are still rather far from this end. It also does not make 
mueh sense - in the contrary to the situation for the solid 
state - to calculate the relaxation speetrum from measured 
meehanieal properties in order to 
gain detailed information 
on the moleeular strueture (meehanieal speetroseopy11)). In 
fact, the speetra of polymerie melts seem to be rather unspeei-
fic. This makes their caleulation from measurable material fune-
tions less critical. One is not obliged to find eharaeteristie 
peaks: They do not exist. On the other hand, one may ask why 
spectra should be determined at all: As we have seen, their 
explieit knowledge is unneeessary for the intereonversion of 
linear material funetions. The answer to the question is that 
quasi-linear constitutive equations are going to play an 
ever increasing role in the description of the meehanieal 
behaviour of polymerie melts. This type of equation possesses 
a memory which is identical with that of the linear viseo-
elastieity of the underlying material. The modifieations, 
however, whieh have been applied to the eorresponding linear 
equations, in order to make the results of the theory fit 
the experimental data, spoil the intereonversion procedures 
discussed in the previous seetion in almost all eases. 
As a eonsequence it turns out that the relaxation time 
speetrum must be known explicitly for the exploitation of 
the quasi-linear eonstitutive equations. 
483 

F.R. Schwarzl and A.J. Staverman12 ) have shown in a 
rather early paper that a crude approximation to the 
relaxation time spectrum H(T) is given by the dynamic 
loss modulus G"(w) itself, for T = 1/w. In fact, if one 
looks at eq. (A.69), one recognizes that the intensity 
function wT/(1+w 2T2 ) has a single maximum at T = 1/w and 
falls off symmetrically on both sides of this maximum on 
a log T scale. If H(T) varies with T slowly enough so that 
the intensity function becomes negligible on both sides of 
its maximum before H(T) has changed noticeably, one can 
put H(T) at 
T = 1/w in front of the integral. The integral 
can then easily be solved and yields n/2. In this way, one 
obtains as a "zero order" approximation: 
Ho"(T) 
(2/1T) G"(W) with T = l/w 
(A. 92) 
The notation is quite obvious, the double dash reminding 
of the use of the loss modulus, the zero subscript ex-
pressing the fact of zero order, which must still be ex-
plained. Before proceeding along this line, some comments 
should be made. An analogous derivation can be given for the 
zero order approximation of the retardation time spectrum 
Lo"(T), if the loss compliance J"(w) is used, as a glance 
on eq. (A.72) shows. On the other hand, eqs. (A.68) and (A.71) 
for G' (w) and L' (w), respectively, cannot directly be used 
for the purpose, since their intensity functions have a quite 
different character: They do not show a maximum and level off 
at T = + 00 and T = -
00, respectively. In deriving eq. (A.92) 
one assigns to the normalized intensity function for G"(w), 
viz. 
(2/n) wT/(1+w 2T2), the task of the Dirac function 
6(~n WT). From this observation one.learns that a modified 
normalized intensity function possessing a maximum (at T = 1/w) 
with a smaller width will give a better approximation. In 
pursuing this idea Schwarzl and Staverman arrived at various 
"higher order" approximations, which were achieved by the 
differentiation of the dynamic moduli (or compliances). For 
the relaxation time spectrum H(T) they obtained with T = 1/w: 
484 

HI '(,) 
d G'(w)/d ~n w 
H2"(,) 
(2/rr) 
[G"(w)-d2G"(w)/d(~n W)2J 
H3 '(,) ~ d G'/d ~n w-(1/4)d3G'/d(~n w)3 
H4 "(,) 
(2/rr) [G"-(IO/9)d2G"/d(~n w)2 + 
+ (1/9)d4G"/d(~n W)4 ] 
(A. 93) 
The last equation has been given by H. FUjita13 ). As a matter 
of fact, one can rather easily verify - by consecutively diffe-
rentiating eqs. (A.68) and (A.69) and carrying out the linear 
combinations prescribed by eqs. (A.93) - that the intensity 
functions obtained for the approximations of increasing order 
are all normalized and show symmetrie maxima at ' = 1/w with 
decreasing widths. This means in principle that the approxima-
tion of the highest order should be the most accurate one. A 
similar series of approximations was also obtained on the basis 
of G(t) and J(t). A review of these and other methods, e.g. by 
14) 
5) 
N.W. Tschoegl 
, is given in Ferry's book 
. 
However, as pointed out by K. Ninomiya and J.D.Ferry8), 
it seems unfeasible to carry out the prescribed differen-
tiations on experimentally determined curves with sufficient 
accuracy. In replacing Schwarzl's second order approximation, 
Ninomiya and Ferry proposed the following linear combination 
of loss moduli with , = 1/ w: 
H( L) 
(2/rr) {G"(w) -
a 
rG"(aw)+G"(~)-2G"(w)J} 
(a_l)2 
~ 
a 
(A.94) 
If a goes to unity, one obtains the second eq. (A.93). 
For this case one can easily show that (a-1) becomes 
~n a, 
so that the second expression in the accolades can be iden-
tified as the second derivative with respect to ~n w. If a 
goes to infinity, one obtains eq. (A.92). The normalized 
intensity function of the expression given in eq. (A.94) 
reads: 
485 

2 
11 
Its only maximum is at T = 1/w. The function is symmetrie 
with respect to this place on a log T scale. For a + 
~ it 
approaches (2/n)wT/(1+W2 T2) which is the rather broad in-
tensity function for (2/n)G"(w). For a + 1 it approaches 
(2/n)8w3 T3/(1+W2 T2 )3. For practical application log a should 
be chosen of the order of 0,2 - 0,4 i.e. a = 1,6 -
2,5. For 
smaller values the difficulties in determining H(T) resemble 
too much those encountered with a graphical differentiation. 
With larger values of log a the intensity function becomes 
unnecessarily broad with, as a consequence, an approximation 
of too low a quality. 
An expression containing a linear combination of G"(w), 
G"(aw), G"(w/a), G"(a2 w), G"(w/a2 ) which gives, in the limit 
of a + 1, the forth eq. (A.93), has also been proposed by 
Ninomiya and Ferry, but has not been used very often in prac-
tice. Also express ions containing storage moduli at equal 
distances on the log w scale have been given by the mentioned 
authors. 
Recently, numerical methods have gained importance for 
the calculation of H(T). As a starting point, eq. (A.69) 
has been used. In this connection, a paper by R.I. Tanner15 ) 
should be mentioned. The problems with these 'numerical 
calculations are of a practical and of a principal nature. 
From a practical point of view the "noise" in the da ta 
should be avoided. Tanner pointed out that eq. (A.94) can-
not be used as an algorithm for an 
iterative calculation 
of H(T), because of being a finite-difference approximation 
of the logarithmic second derivative. "The more exact the 
inversion from the standpoint of the usual approximate 
methods, the worse the iterative result". As a consequence, 
Tanner proposed an algorithm obtained by trial and error, 
which gives a smooth H(T). His starting formula is: 
H1 (1/w) = (2/311) [G"(w/a) + G"(w) + G"(aw)] 
••• (A.95) 
486 

where a is chosen according to the advise of Ninomiya and 
Ferry (log a 
~ 0,2). At the end points of the investigated 
frequency range eq. (A.92) is used. With this Hj(T) a first 
approximation G"1(w) is calculated with the help of eq. 
(A.69). The difference between the experimental G"(w) and 
this first approximation is called t:.G"1 (w). It is put into 
eq. (A. 95) instead of the experimental G" ( w). In this way the 
spectral increment t:.H1 is calculated. From H2 = H1 + t:.H1 
one obtains a G"2(w). The iteration is repeated until the 
maximum relative error t:.G." /G." over the w-scale is less 
l 
l 
than a fixed value, say 0,05. For a polystyrene, as in-
vestigated in the former laboratory of the present author, 
B. de Cindi016 )reached this error with the aid of only five 
iterations. With a larger number of iterations the maximum 
relative error started to increase again. This is a curious 
result also observed by Tanner. De Cindio was happy to 
check the usefulness of his numerically obtained H(T) 
also by inserting it into eq. (A.68) (with Ge = 0) and 
comparing the calculated values of G' (w) with the experi-
mental values of this quantity. Fortunately, also for the 
storage moduli, a maximum relative error of no more than 
5% was found. 
This points to the principal question announced. As 
F.R. Schwarzl pointed out in his 1970 paper3 ) on p. 233, 
"no approximations for the spectra can be found which 
could be error bound". So it seems safe to check any 
relaxation time spectrum, as obtained e.g. from experimental 
values of G"(w), against all other linear material functions 
(seeeqs. (A.67), (A.68), (A.83), (A.84) etc.) whichare 
experimentally available. Only under these conditions one 
may safely assurne that a relaxation time spectrufu which 
furnishes correct results in a linear experiment, will give -
when used in a quasi-linear constitutive equation - dis-
cussible (or relevant) results in the same experiment under 
non-linear conditions. As an example one may envisage the 
transition from a linear stressing experiment (at sufficiently 
low rate of deformation) to a non-linear stressing experiment 
(at high rates of deformation). 
487 

The present author hopes that there will exist a 
certain equivalence, say between G"(w) and a(t) and between 
G'(w) and the stored energy F(t). The reason for this hope 
is based on the facts that there are limiting cases in 
which very simple relations exist between the mentioned 
quantities. These relations will more extensively be 
discussed in Chapter 2.3 on Lodge's elastic liquid model, 
where 2F(t) will be identified with the first normal stress 
difference. 
As flow birefringence is, for a rubberlike liquid, 
simply related to the stresses in the flowing medium, 
flow birefringence will turn out to be an extremely use-
ful aid to determine the tail of the relaxation time spectrum 
at high relaxation times. In fact, in the steady state one 
finds for

if G(t) is inserted into the integrals according to eq. 
(A.59). One notices that F(~) mainly depends on the square 
of the "highest" relaxation time. The above statement is 
relevant because of the possibility to measure extremely 
small birefringence values so that the rate of shear q can 
be chosen low enough anyway for the establishment of linear 
behaviour, where the measurement of normal stresses becomes 
almost impossible for certain polymers (with an extremely 
broad molecular mass distribution). 
A comparison with eqs. (A.60) and (A.61) shows, for 
the limits of w + 0, the mentioned relationships between 
G'(w) and F(t) and between G"(w) and a(t).

a more simple way to arrive at adequate approximate line

relaxation mechanisms Ti at equal spacings along the 
logarithmic time scale and calculated the pertinent 
Gi-values by producing the best fits of the experimental 
curves for G'(w) and for G"(w). It appears that the prin-
cipal remarks made above, are also applicable to these 
spectra.

Appendix B: The Time-Temperature 
Superposition Principle 
8.1 Introduction 
This principle (its name was coined by A.V. Tobolsky1) 
a rather long time ago) has proven to be of great value 
in all those cases where the "experimental window" is too 
narrow. (The experimental window is given as the time or 
frequency span within which measurements can be carried 
out at constant temperature with the aid of the available 
equipment.) Its apparent validity opens new insights into 
the molecular mecanisms of flow. The same holds for its 
limits of validity. 
As an example, shear creep compliances J(t,T) as 
very recently published by F.R. Schwarzl and F. zahradnik2), 
are reproduced in Fig. B.1. These compliances were measured 
for a polystyrene within an unusually large time span. If 
e.g. the temperature of 1050 C is taken as a reference 
temperature To (= 378 K), and the curves for the other 
temperatures are shifted along the horizontallogarithmic 
time scale until they coincide with the curve for To and 
with each other, one obtains (except for the lowest 
temperatures) a beautiful "master curve" which shows the 
glass-rubber transition at 1050 Cover an extreme number 
of decades in the creep time t. The criteria for"the 
applicability of this principle are: 
a) the overlap in the ordinate values (of J(t,T)) 
should be sufficientj 
b) the "shift factor" log a (T,To ) should be a 
smooth and reasonable function of temperature.

measurements (solid line through the experimental points) .

densities are involved, since by thermal expansion the unit 
of volume contains a decreasing amount of material. This 
becomes more clear if the shear modulus is considered instead 
of the shear compliance. The modulus has the dimension of 
force per unit surface or energy per unit volume. The 
absolute temperature T is incorporated since at least for the 
rubberlike state above the glass transition temperature T , 
g 
the free energy of the system is considered as'proportional 
to the absolute temperature (G = TS) . 
Similar reduction schemes are valid for other linear 
viscoelastic functions, e.g. 3):

8.2 The WLF-Equation 4) 
If the quantity (T-To)/log a(T,To ) is plotted against 
(T-T ), a straight line is obtained in general. This means 
o 
that one can write for log a: 
• •• (B.3) 
where c 10 and c20 are given by the slope and by the inter-
cept with the ordinate axis. This relation is inserted as 
solid line in Fig. B.2 of the previous section for To 
The constants c 1s and c 2s indicate the asymptodes for 
T s 
T + 
~ and log a + 
~, respectively. It is not shown in the fi-
gure, however, that in reality log a does not go to infinity at 
T 
T 00 
• •• (B. 4 ) 
An interpretation of this fact will be given below. 
For us this fact is of minor importance since we are 
interested only in the rubberlike state and not in the 
glass transition itself. 
At this stage it is interesting to note that, within 
the range of temperatures where eq. (B.3) nolds, reference 
temperatures can be chosen quite arbitrarily. In particular, 
it can be deduced from eq. (B.4) that 
= 
If this is used in the denominator of eq. (B.3) one arrives 
with 
at a transformation rule for the constants of eq. (B.3): 
= 
494 

and 
• •• (B. 5) 
In their original discussion, Ferry et al. 4) included 
also the glass transition temperature Tg in this scheme (for 
the determination of T 
see below) and claimed that the 
g 
constants c 1g and c 2g were universal for all polymers 
investigated (c 1g = 17,4; c 2g = 51,6K), so that Tg should 
be the only parameter characteristic for the polymer. Later 
the softening temperature T 
(dependent on the polymer 
s 
up to 45 K higher than Tg ) was preferred. However, in more 
recent publications it was shown that the product c 1 c 2 ' 
which should be independent of the special choice of the 
reference temperature, was not universal (and not equal to 
900 K) but of the order of only one halve of this "universal" 
value. This does not mean that the original concept becomes 
worthless, however, since accurate measurements are not 
available in all cases of interest. Especially for the pre-
sent purpose in which only the rubberlike behaviour is of 
interest, the original version of the WLF.-equation proves 
to be of great usefulness. It holds approximately up to 
T = Tg + 100 K. 
8.3 The Free Volume Concept 
By analogy with an old concept used in the theory of 
the viscosity of normal liquids (Doolittle equation5)), 'one 
obtains for the segmental mobility m of a polymer'molecule 
in bulk: 
R,n m 
A - B/f 
• •• (B. 6) 
where A and Bare constants and f(=vf/vo ) is the fractional 
free volume. The latter has been considered as a function of 
temperature, of pressure and, very recently, of the internal 
free energy change, as caused by deformation and flow6). For 
495 

the moment, we are interested only in its dependence on 
temperature, as we consider linear viscoelastic properties 
at normal pressure. In eq. (B.6) v f is the actual free volume, 
whereas Vo is the occupied volume. Since v f amounts only 
to about 1 per cent of the occupied volume, one has with 
practically equal accuracy f = vf/v, where v is the total 
volume. The occupied volume Vo contains the increase due to 
thermal expansion as far as this is due to the anharmonicity 
of the vibrational potentials. In contrast, free volume must 
be considered as the volume of the "holes" in the liquid. 
The formulation of eq. (B.6), in which f is related to the 
segmental mobility, points to the fact that the results of 
this theory will be independent of the molecular mass of 
the macromolecules, since the single segment is considered 
as the kinetic unit. In fact, the end points of chain mole-
cules will cause an extra contribution to the free volume. 
As long as this contribution is disregardable, which is the 
case with sufficiently long molecules, no dependence on the 
molecular mass will be expected. 
From eq. (B.6) one obtains for the shift factor: 
(B.7) 
From this equation the WLF-equation has been derived by 
M.L. Williams, R. F. Landel and J.D. Ferry by the intro-
duction of the following simple temperature dependence of f: 
f o 
(B.8) 
where u f is the thermal expansion coefficient of the fractional 
free volume. From the comparison of the two equations (B.8) 
one learns that f 
= Uf(T -T 
) which means that f is formally 
00
00 
zero at Too • 
In fact, if the second eq. (B.8) is introduced in 
eq. (B.7), one obtains: 
496 

(B.9) 
A comparison with eq. (B.3) shows that: 
0,43 B/f o 
(B.10) 
These are two equations for three unknown quantities 
B, f o and u f . With some intuition u f can be determined from 
dilatometric measurements, as Schwarzl and Zahradnik2) 
have shown recently. 
In Fig. B.3 a schematic drawing is given of the depen-
dence of the specific volume v on the temperature T. In 
this figure the glass transition temperature Tg is given 
as the temperature of the intersection of the dashed straight 
lines extrapolated from the respective courses of v vs. T 
at low and high temperatures. The experiment is started at

high temperatures where thermodynamic equilibrium is obtained 
at any rate of cooling. With increasing cooling rates in-
creasing glass transition temperatures are obtained, because 
of the increasing levels of the frozen in free volume. 
Standardized measurements have been proposed at a cooling 
rate of 3 K/h2). It is assumed that the frozen in free volume 
changes only at a time scale much bigger than that of the 
sketched experiments. With the assumption that the free 
volume will become zero at T = Too ' 
if the rate of cooling 
becomes infinitesimally small, one can construct the con-
tribut ions of the free volume and of the occupied volume to 
the total specific volume for the finite cooling rate of 
the experiment. For the purpose, the course of the equili-
brium curve, as found at high temperatures, is extrapolated 
down to Too ' as obtained from eq. (B.4). Through the inter-
section between the straight extrapolation line and the 
line T = Too a (straight) line is drawn parallel to the course 
of v vs. T, as found for the glassy state (vf being assumed 
to be constant in the glassy state, since any change will 
take a time of a higher order of magnitude than that of the 
cooling experiment). From this picture it is clear that 
where a~ is the slope of the equilibrium line (liquid or 
rubberlike state) and a 
is the slope of the line for the 
g 
glassy state. In this way for the constants of eq. (B.10) 
the following orders of magnitude were found for several 
pOlymers 2) :

For the present purpose, these facts are described, 
because a large number of decisive measurements in the field 
498 

covered in this monograph has been carried out at temperatures 
in the range between Tg and Tg + 100 K for practical reasons: 
At higher temperatures the interesting time effects, as ob-
served with intermittent flows, become so short living that 
they cannot be measured accurately enough with the existing 
simple instrumentation. (These finite times are connected with 
the entanglement structure and are not directly related to 
the adjustment of the equilibrium volume, which occurs 
immeasurably fast at temperatures above Tg .) 
At higher temperatures, the time-temperature superposition 
principle remains valid. The shift factor log a(T,To )' however, 
obeys different laws, as recently surveyed by D.W. van Krevelen 
and P.J. HOftijzer7 ) 8). Their unified description will be 
given in the next section. 
8.4 Unified Description of the Temperature Dependence 
of the Zero-Shear Viscosity 
According to Maxwell's relation one has: 
(B. 12) 
where n 
is the viscosity in the limit of zero rate of shear, 
o 
the sum is extended over a (line) spectrum of relaxation 
times T. and the symbols g. stand for the corresponding 
~ 
~ 
moduli. If the additional assumption is made that all moduli 
are identical and equal to kT (rubberlike liquid); the zero 
shear viscosity no depends only on the relaxation times. To 
relate these relaxation times to the segmental mobility 
mentioned in the previous section, one needs, strictly 
speaking, a molecular theory. For concentrated polymer systems 
like polymer melts, such a theory did not exist in the past. 
Only recently, however, such a theory was proposed (see 
Chapter 3). According to this theory for a rubberlike liquid 
499 

all relaxation times are proportional to the same segmental 
mobility. This has been anticipated by Ferry and coworkers, 
when they introduced eq. (B.6) into their reasonings. Such 
a system, in which all relaxation times possess the same 
temperature dependence, has been called a thermo-rheologically 
simple system by F.R. Schwarzl and A.J. Staverman9). 
For such a system the segmental mobility m is inversely 
proportional to the zero shear viscosity. As a consequence, an 
investigation into the temperature dependence of the zero 
shear viscosity is equivalent to an investigation of the 
temperature dependence of the shift factor of eq. (B.7). 
Experiences with molten semicrystalline polymers and 
with amorphous polymers, if considered at sufficiently high 
temperatures, show that there are considerable deviations 
from the predictions of the WLF-equation, the latter giving 
a fairly universal description only for temperatures between 
Tg and Tg + 100 K. In particular, the glass transition tempera-
ture can no longer be considered as the only relevant parameter. 
Instead, one finds Arrhenius type dependences with apparent 
activation energies characteristic for the special polymers 
under consideration. 
It was the merit of D.W. van Krevelen and P.J. Hoftijzer 
to find a plot in which a great number of experimental results 
could be compiled. In this plot which is reproduced as 
Fig.B.4, the logarithm of the ratio of the zero shear viscosity 
at an arbitrary temperature T over the zero shear viscosity 
of the same polymer at 1,2 T 
is plotted versus T /T.*) In

g 
accordance with the experiences gathered with the WLF.-equation, 
one finds a fairly universal behaviour for 1,2>T >T>T , i.e. 
g 
g 
O,833<Tg/T<1. Because of the logarithmic scale on the ordinate 
axis this ordinate is nothing else than the shift factor with 
respect to a reference temperature T 
= 1,2 T 
(cf. eq. (B.7)).

At higher temperatures every investigated polymer seems to 
show its individual behaviour. If the tangents to the indivi-
, 
dual lines are drawn at low va lues of Tg/T, one can easily 
draw them through the point P on the right ordinate axis. 
This point is located at 
no (T)/no (1,2 Tg ) = 1. This means 
that the general equation for these asymptotes is:

In the original article7 ) and in Van Krevelen's book8 ) 
valuable further interrelations and methods for the calcu-
lation of the apparent activation energies from additive 
contributions of molecular groups are given. 
Finally, some general statements should be made. First 
of all, it is clear why, according to this picture, the melts 
of semicrystalline polymers never obey the WLF.-equation. 
Dependent whether the chain moleeules of these polymers are 
linear or contain side groups, the melting point Tm are 
factors two or 1,5 higher than the glass transition tempera-
ture Tg 
(cf. Van Krevelen8)). This means that, anyway, 
melts exist only at T /T < T /T 
< 0,833. 
g 
g 
m 
A second observation is that there is no molecular mass 
dependence of the temperature (or pressure) dependence, since 
the latter is related to the mobility of a single segment. 
For the same reason, unchanged shift factors also hold for 
the non-linear behaviour of polymer melts, as will become 
obvious in the pertinent chapters of this book.

Appendix C: The Measurement of Birefringence 
Effects 
C.1 Matrix Representation of Optical Components 
As is weIl known, the calculation of the contributions 
of the components of an optical system to the state of pola-
rization (ellipticity) of an originally linearly polarized 
light beam is tedious and, consequently, subject to calcu-
lation errors. This holds particularly, if the system con-
sists of more than only the basic elements, viz apolarizer, 
a birefringent medium and an analyser (in crossed position 
with the polarizer). In general, the system also contains 
two further elements, viz a compensator and a device which 
takes over the role of the half shadow plate which has been 
usual in the classical arrangement for the measurement of 
extinction positions and retardations. For sensitive measure-
ments also parasitic birefringence effects of windows as 
weIl as effects caused by the non-ideality of polarization 
prisms have to be taken into account. In this way the number 
of optical components considerably increases. 
To cope with this difficulty, H. pOincare1 ) has invented 
a geometrical construction on the surface of a unit sphere. 
Though this construction is very useful for qualitative 
purposes, quantitative results are difficult to be obtained 
for more than three components. In fact, with 'calculations 
in terms of spherical trigonometry difficulties arise with 
the 
introduction of a suitable reference system. This is 
why a description of Poincare's method must be omitted here. 
The announced matrix calculus is based on ideas by 
P. Soleillet2)and H. Mueller3 ) and has been described in a 
very useful form by M.J. Walker4). For this calculus the state 
504 

of polarization of a light beam is characterized by the four 
"Stokes parameters,,5)

the ratio E jE

(C.2) 
This means that the first Stokes parameter I, which is equal 
to the intensity of the beam, is redundant. For an incom-
pletely polarized beam, however, one finds 1 2 > Q2 + U2 + V2 . 
If, nevertheless one decides to characterize the state of pola-
rization also for a completely polarized beam by the column 
matrix with the four .elements I, Q, U, V, one has to face the 
fact that every component of the optical system is represented 
by a square matrix operating on such a column matrix. In fact, 
by the proper matrix multiplication a new column matrix of four 
elements is produced, which describes the state of the beam 
emerging from the mentioned component. For that which follows 
one only needs two operations: 
a) For apolarizer making an angle a (in the mathematically 
positive sense) with a reference axis (x-axis) in the plane 
perpendicular to the light propagation:

The most simple configuration, which is of interst in 
flow birefringence measurements, is the one consisting of 
apolarizer, a birefringent medium with orientation angle ß 
and phase difference 5 and an analyser under ninety degrees 
with the polarizer. The direction of the polarizer is assumed 
to define the above mentioned x-axis in the plane perpendi-
cular to the light propagation. As a consequence, the column 
vector P 
has the components E 2, E 2,0,0 (cf. eq. (C.1».

According to the principles of the mentioned matrix calculus

This result is also in agreement with eq. (C.1), since 
the new Ex of P is zero for the assumed direction of the ana-
lyser. For that which follows we are interested only in the 
intensity of the issuing beam, which is given by the Stokes 
parameter I. After a slight rearrangement one obtains:

With 
ß = TI/4 and 0 = 2TIr/A,

where r is the optical path difference (or "retardation") and 
A is the wave length of the used light in vacuo, one obtains the 
familiar expression: 
I = I 
sin 2 (TIr/A) 
o 
... (C.9) 
Here I o stands for Ex 2 and gives the intensity of the beam 
issuing from the polarizer. In fact, if losses by reflection 
and absorption are disregarded, as in eq. (C.9), a phase 
difference 6 = n in combination with ß = n/4 furnishes an 
identical intensity of the issuing beam, as a simple con-
struction on a sheet of paper confirms. 
As is weIl known, the connection between the retarda-
tion rand the birefringence 
~n is given by 
~n = r/L, 
(C .10) 
where L is the length of the light path through the bire-
fringent medium (thickness of the sampie) • 
507 

Another interesting configuration is characteristic for 
the compensation method proposed by de Senarmont.*) In this 
configuration a quarter wave plate (with r' = A/4 or 6' = n/2) 
is inserted parallel to the polarizer between the birefringent 
medium at ß = n/4 and the analyser. 
With this arrangement one 
has to turn the analyser by an angle 
~ = 6/2 out of its crossed 
position, in order to obtain extinction. This is a convenient 
method for the determination of a rather small phase diffe-
rence 6. 
According to the matrix calculus one has for this situ-
ation: 
P = R(a) .

• •• (C. 11 ) 
In spite of the great number of prescribed matrix multi-
plications this calculation is rather easy because of the 
special choice of angles, which causes a great number of zero 
components in the matrices. One obtains for the intensity of 
the emerging beam: 
I = (I /2) sin 2 (~ -0/2) 
o 
(C.12) 
It is clearly seen that the intensity I becomes zero 
for 
~ 
6/2. Usually, a half-shadow plate is used as an 
extra component in order to improve the accuracy of the 
readings of the extinction positions of the analyser. In 
more re cent work on flow birefringence, however, a modulator 
has been used instead of a half-shadow plate. This modulator 
produces a phase difference ß which varies sinusoidally with 
time. Its extinction position is chosen parallel to that of 
*) 
508 
Footnote: Compensators in the most literal sense, which 
simply subtract an adjustable retardation from the one 
created by the mediums, will not be discussed. These com-
pensators (e.g. those according to Babinet, Berek or 
Ehringhaus) can be understood on the basis of eq. (C.9)). 

the birefringent medium. It is inserted behind this medium. 
A very useful type of modulator will be described below. 
In this way one obtains instead of eq. (C.12): 
••• (C.13) 
If the amplitude of the modulation is chosen small 
enough, one can expand eq. (C.13) in terms of ß(= ß 
sin wt). 
o 
If terms of higher than the second order are neglected, one 
obtains: 
I = (I /2) r sin 2 ($-0/2) -
(ß/2) sin (2$-0) + 
o 
~ 
+ (ß 2/4) cos (2$-0) J 
•.. (C.14) 
With this arrangement the intensity must be measured 
photoelectrically. As soon as the compensation position 
$ = 6/2 is reached, the term containing ß, which vibrates 
with the basic frequency w, vanishes. Since ß2/4 = (ß o 2/S) 
(1-cos 2 wt), a signal of twice the frequency 
of the modu-
lator superimposed on a DC signal, is retained. With an 
alternating voltage phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier the 
DC-signal can be suppressed whereas the signal of 2 w can 
be made to vanish by a suitable integration with respect to 
wt = TI. In this way the curve describing the intensity I($) 
is accurately differentiated with respect to $ near $ = 6/2. 
The point dI/d$ = 0 is found to be extremely sharp. (See 
Fig.C.1). 
This method is of great advantage not only because of 
the achieved accuracy. In rheological measurements one very 
often has to deal with only approximately straight flow 
lines. In those cases (as in the Cou~tte geometry) the elu-
minated field is slightly bent. With a half-shadow plate one 
covers only apart of the field. This part shows an average 
flow direction slightly different from that of the uncovered 
part of the field. When the half-shadow plate is turned

together with the analyser, varying parts of the field are 
covered. As a consequence, a systematic error is introduced 
into the measurement of the extinction position. This error 
depends on how dark the field is chosen, i.e. how close to 
extinction the half-shadow plate is used. Xlso from this point 
of view one has to be happy to be able to avoid the use of a 
half-shadow plate. 6 ) 
A third, and probably the most important point öf inter-
est with flow birefringence measurements in shear is the 
determination of the extinction angle. In the most simple 
configuration one makes use of eq. (C.7). This equation 
suggests that the birefringent medium is turned as a whole 
like a crystal plate under the polarizing microscope until ß 
becomes zero or ninety degrees. In reality, however, polarizer 
and analyser are turned together in a mutually crossed posi-
tion until extinction occurs. With this measurement a slight 
510 

bent of the field can be advantageous for visual inspection, 
if one cares that the divergence of the light beam is kept 
as small as possible in a tangential direction to the flow 
lines. With this precaution an isocline becomes perceptible 
which can be moved to the centre of the field by rotating the 
crossed polarizing prisms.*) 6) 
Also with respect to this case of visual inspection an 
increase of accuracy can be achieved by the use of the above 
mentioned modulator. For this purpose the modulator is inser-
ted at 45 degrees with the direction of the polarizer. 
One obtains instead of eq. (C.5): 
P = P(TI/2).R(TI/4,6).R(8,o).P

An expansion up to the second power in 6 yields: 
I = 1 0 
[ sin 2 28 sin 2(o/2) + (6/2) sin 28 sin 0 + 
• •• (C. 17) 
If the extinction positions ß = 0 or ß = n/2 are approached, 
only the term I o 62/4 is retained, in complete analogy of the 
compensation method 
(~ = 0/2 in eq. (C.14)). It can be made 
to vanish with the aid of the mentioned lock-in amplifier 
as described before. This means that in the present case the 
curve I(ß) is accurately differentiated with respect to ß 
near ß = 0 or n/2. 
*) Footnote: This advantage does not exist for the compensation 
method according to 
de Senarmont, since this compensation 
occurs at ß = n/4 and is insensitive to small deviations in ß. 
511 

One has to realize, however, that in the present case 
polarizer and analyser are simultaneously rota ted (in mutu-
ally crossed position) together with the modulator. 
C.3 How to Cope with Imperfeetions of Windows 
and Polarizing Prisms 
Problems with parasitic strain birefringences in glass 
windows and apparent strains in polarizing prisms occur, if 
the flow birefringence is very weak as in dilute solutions 
or at extremely low rates of shear in polymer melts. As the 
latter measurements are of great importance for the deter-
mination of the ratio of G' and G" at extremely low circular 
frequencies (see the end of Section 4.1.1), the pertinent 
experimental situation must be discussed here. Fortunately, 
difficulties are restricted to the extinction angle measure-
ments. As a matter of fact, deviations of the order of one 
degree in the extinction angle can be found as a consequence 
of a parasitic birefringence of the order of only one per cent 
of the flow birefringence if, per accident, the extinction 
positions of the parasitic effect differ by about fourty-five 
degrees from those of the flow birefringence. But a deviation 
of one degree can seriously spoil the determination of the 
initial slope of the steady flow extinction ,angle curve, on 
which the above mentioned determination of G'/G" relies. 
In fact, measurements have to be pursued in general down to 
rates of shear, at which the deviation of the extinction angle 
from fourty-five degrees is of the order of only one degree. 
(As is well-known, the starting point of this curve is at 
fourty-five degrees in the limit of zero shear rate.) 
Since our present interest is restricted to cases where 
all optical components cause only a small phase difference, 
calculations can be simplified. This is favourable since a 
rather large nurnber of components is involved, as there are in 
the order, in which they occur in the optical system (with

theses ):

The compensator plate is a weakly birefringent glass plate. 
Its phase difference must be a little larger than the sum 
of the parasitic phase differences 0p' °1 , °2 , 0a. It is 
conveniently mounted in a fitting affixed to the case of 
the polarizer. The angle Uc is adjustable and can be read 
from a drum, if necessary. 
An approximate expression for the intensity of the beam 
emerging from the analyser reads: 
I = (1 0 /4) [ 0p sin 2a.p + oe sin 2a. e + 01 sin 2(a. 1 -ß) + 
+ ° sin 2(X-ß) + 02 sin 2(a. 2 -ß) + ä + 0a sin 2a. a J2 
(C. 18) 
An analogous expression (omitting the parasitic contri-
butions as weIl as that of the compensator plate) can easily 
be derived from eq. (C.17), if 0« 1 is assumed and ß of 
this equation is replaced by X -
ß. Equation (C.18) is 
equivalent to the well-known fact that the contrfbutions to 
the ellipticity of the wave are simply additive, if all phase 
differences are extremely small. 
At the desired extinction position of the flow bire-
fringence effect one has ß = x. However, owing to the 
parasitic effects the intensity of the emerging beam is 
not zero at this position of the polarizer. If the phase 
513 

difference oe has a suitable value, as mentioned above, one 
can adjust the angle a c in such a way that oe sin 2 a c just 
compensates for the contributions of all the parasitic effects 
to the ellipticity. However, since the contributions of the 
windows, which do not rotate with the polarizing prisms, are 
dependent on the particular position of the polarizer, this 
adjustment has to occur at the approximate extinction posi-
tion, when the fluid in the apparatus is at rest so that 
the flow birefringence itself is zero. This adjustment is 
easily and accurately carried out with the aid of the modu-
lator, if its amplitude ßo is chosen small enough. After this 
adjustment, the extinction angle is determined with the same 
accuracy as in the absence of parasitic effects 7). 
Previously, with no suitable modulator at hand, an indi-
reet adjustment with the aid of a Newtonian fluid of known 
extinction angle X = n/4 had to be carried outS). For the pur-
pose, the windows were rotated until the deviation of the 
measured extinction angle from fourty-five degrees was as 
small as possible at a flow birefringence as low as feasible 
for a visual inspection. Then the windows were simultaneously 
rota ted by 450 to furnish the biggest deviation of the mea-
sured extinction angle. With the aid of the compensator plate, 
which was inserted at this stage, this deviation was reduced 
again to zero. In this way a compensation of the window in-
fluence was achieved at its maximum, with as a consequence 
that this compensation was also valid for extinction angles 
of non-Newtonian fluid as long as they did not deviate too 
much from 450 • Fortunately, by the introduction of the 
mentioned modulation technique such a complicated procedure 
has become superfluous. (It goes without saying that, for 
routine measurements, the angular positions of'the windows 
and of the compensator plate had to be preset reproducibly 
with the aid of separate vernier scales. As a consequence 
of aging effects in the prisms the adjustment procedure had 
to be repeated at least once a year6 ).) 
514 

C.4 Description of the Modulator 
The idea to improve the accuracy and the reliability 
of flow birefringence measurements with the aid of a modu-
lation goes back to B.R. Zimm9). Meanwhile, several other 
authors have proposed various types of modulators. Strictly 
spoken, most of the proposed modulators do not simply 
produce a birefringence effect sinusoidally varying with 
time, as assumed in previous sections of this appendix. 
Effectively, however, the action of all modulators proposed 
so far comes down to a 
differentiation of the intensity 
curve, as described above. 
One group of authors 10 ) has proposed the use of a Faraday 
cell, which introduces an oscillatory rotation of the plane 
of polarization. A rotating plate of slightly birefringent 
material (thin mica) has been proposed as wel1 11 ). The forced 
longitudinal vibration of a glass plate, which produces a 
sinusoidally varying birefringence by virtue of the photo-
elastic effect, was also tried12 ). Rowever, all these modulators 
show severe practical disadvantages, ranging from being too 
voluminous and expensive to being impracticable because of an 
unapt frequency range (too close to the frequency of the 
power supply) or because of too high a modulating birefrin-
gence without possibilities for adjustment. Free longitudinal 
vibrations of a glass plate do not furnish sußficient flexi-
bility either. Forced vibration, on the other hand, suffers 
from the additional inhogeneous strains which are due to 
clamping. 
An almost ideal solution has been found by the present 
author and his cooperators in the form of a strip of relati-
vely strainfree glass of 150 x 25 x 2,5 mm, on which in a 
longitudinal direction two narrow strips of the same material 
(150 x 5 x 2,5 mm) were glued, as shown schematically in 
Fig. C.2. Canada balsam was used as a 
cement. In this 
way a flat U-profile was created. When this glass beam is 
excited in his lowest mode of transversal vibration at a 
515

F.H. Gortemaker.) 
frequency of approximately 1000 Hz, one obtains astrain 
birefringence effect nicely varying sinusoidally with time, 
its amplitude being adjustable with the aid of the energy 
imput. In fact, by modifying the rectangular cross-section 
of an ordinary beam in the indicated way, one avoids that, 
during bending, the birefringence caused by extension on 
one side of the neutral plane is completely compensated by 
the birefringence of compression on the other side of this 
plane. The described glass-beam is suspended in the nodal 
points of the pertinent lowest eigen frequency. Small strips 
of soft iron are cemented to both ends of the glass-beam in 
order to enable an electro-magnetic feed-back between the 
exciting microphone and the detector. (Cf. the way in which 
damping measurements have been carried out on strips of 
polymers in their glassy state13 ).) Examples fo~ very accurate 
measurements of the flow birefringence of a polystyrene melt 
at extremely low rates of shear as carried with this modulator, 
have been given in Sections 2.3.6 and 4.1.2. Results on dilute 
solutions are found in the original literature. 
Finally, some comments seem adequate. Firstly, one should 
realize that a small permanent birefringence of the glass-beam 
516 

is irrelevant, as it is compensated like astrain in a pola-
rizing prism or in a window (see Section C.3). Secondly, the 
original paper by B. Koeman7 ) should be quoted, according to 
which the "modulation depth" of the described modulator is 
almost ideal. This quantity (see C.L. Riddiford14 )) is rele-
vant in connection with the fraction of unpolarized light, 
which can be kept as low as 5.10-7 with the use of adequate 
polarizing prisms. 
C.5 Problems with Quickly Changing Birefringence Effects 
More or less quick changes in birefringence and extinction 
angle occur when flow is started or stopped. As these transient 
situations are of particular interest for the characterization 
of a fluid, problems arizing with the measurement of transient 
birefringences and extinction angles should be discussed here. 
In many ca ses fluids have been chosen, which show a 
sufficiently slow reaction on changes in strain rate, so that 
basically the same methods can be used as in steady state. 
This approach gives better results for the transient extinction 
angles than for the corresponding retardations, at least if 
the maximum birefringences are not too large. The reason is 
that one can rather easily preset various positions of 
crossed polarizer and analyser and measure the time when the 
isocline passes the field. Only with a basically linear com-
pensator like the Babinet-compensator, for which readings 
are proportional to the retardation, one obtains also the 
time dependent retardation with comparable ease, even if 
the necessity is given to change the position of the compen-
sator during the measurements, in accordance with achanging 
extinction angle. Automation can bring a considerable alle-
vation so that also faster processes can be followed. If 
retardations of the order of many wave length are encountered, 
one can follow bUild-up or relaxation of the birefringence by 
simply monitoring the times when fringes pass by. On the 
517 

other hand, the determination of extinction angles becomes 
difficult under those circumstances, since fringes can be 
mistaken for isoclines and vice versa. 
An interesting method was proposed by K. Osaki, N. Bessho, 
T. Kojimoto and M. Kurata15 ) quite recently. These authors 
started from eq. (C.7) with E 2 = I • In Fig. C.3 the re-

eq. (C.7) is given by ß = X + 0 , where 0 is the angle under 
which the flow direction is seen from the polarizer. As a 
consequence one has:

In general the use of the expressions for the special

angles 0 , ~ 22,5

or to -

order to obtain a more accurate value for the extinction 
angle.

angles are reproduced in Fig. C.4 
. This investigation 
was carried out on an 8% solution of a polystyrene of mass 
average molecular mass 3,0.106 in chorinated biphenyl at 
3SoC. The sums of 1(00 ) and 1(450 ) and of 1(22,SoC) and 
1(-22,SoC) give the same curve indicated by the dashed line 
on top of the other lines. This is in accordance with eq. 
(C.21). Apparently, the maximum of this dashed line at 
about t 
= 6 s corresponds to a value of 6 = n. Its height 
has been used as the value for 1 0 , so that the reduced in-
tensities 1(8)/10 could finally beplotted in this figure. 
The value of 1(-22,50 ) is very small over a range near 
t = 13 s. This fact indicates that the extinction angle is 
22,5 0 somewhere in this range. If only Fig. C.4 is consid~red,

solution according to Osaki et al. 15 ). Dashed

the question remains unanswered, whether the retardation 
reaches a maximum at this time (overshcot) or increases further 
so that the maximum retardation is given by the subsequent 
minimum in the dashed line. This question was decided by the 
authors in two ways. First, they considered the birefringence 
relaxation after cessation of flow and found that the sum 
of reduced intensities, as indicated by eq. (C.20), again 
passed through a maximum of unity value. Assuming that no 
overshoot occurs with relaxation, one arrives at the con-
clusion that the minimum of the dashed line in Fig. C.4 
corresponds to the maximum of the birefringence, as occurring 
during the bUild-up. The authors had a second criterion at 
their disposal. 
Their coaxial cylinder apparatus was con-
structed in such a way that the length of the light path 
through the fluid could be varied. This construction enabled 
520 

the authors to eliminate edge effeets and to deeide between 
ambiguities inherent in the nature of trigonometrie 
funetions oeeurring in the relevant equations. The method 
of the mentioned authors gives beautiful results like those 
quoted in Seetion 3.2.3.1 in eonneetion with the Lodge-
Meissner eriterion.
