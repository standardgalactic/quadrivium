Preface 
Water is an important molecule. Seventy-one percent of the Earth’s 
surface is covered by liquid water. it is the most abundant niolecule, and it 
is a good solvent for polar and ionic substances. Samuel Taylor 
Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner knew this: 
The lack of pure water for drinking purposes and the lack of water 
sufficiently pure for irrigating the land are major challenges for the 
human race. 
This book offers no solutions to such severe problems. It consists of a 
review of the inorganic chemistry of the elements in all their oxidation 
states in an aqueous environment. Chapters 1 and 2 deal with the 
properties of liquid water and the hydration of ions. Acids and bases, 
hydrolysis and solubility are the main topics of Chapter 3. Chapters 4 and 
5 deal with aspects of ionic form and stability in aqueous conditions. 
Chapters 6 (s- and p-block), 7 (d-block) and 8 (f-block) represent a survey 
of the aqueous chemistry of the elements of the Periodic Table. The 
chapters from 4 to 8 could forin a separate course in the study of the 
periodicity of the chemistry of the elements in aqueous solution, chapters 
4 and 5 giving the necessary thermodynamic background. A inore 
extensive course, or possibly a second course, would include the very 
detailed treatment of enthalpies and entropies of hydration of ions, acids 
and bases, hydrolysis and solubility. 
There are many tables of data in the text and the author has spent 
much time in attempting to ensure maximum consistency with the various 
available sources. 
I thank Martyn Berry for reading the manuscript and for his many 
suggestions that led to improvements in the text.

Water and its Solvent

This introductory chapter is about liquid water and some of its important 
properties - those that enable it to act as a good solvent for ionic and 
polar substances.

recoverable by evaporating the solvent. In some cases the “solute” reacts 
with water and cannot be recovered by the removal of the solvent. In such 
cases the solution produced is of another solute, related to the initially 
dissolved substance. For example, sodium metal reacts with water to give 
a solution of sodium hydroxide. In general, polar molecules and ionic 
solids dissolve readily in polar solvents, and non-polar molecules dissolve 
readily in non-polar solvents. The ionic compound sodium chlorate (VII) 
(NaC104, sodiuni perchlorate) dissolves in water at 25 “C to give a 
- one with the maximum solubility - containing 
205 grams per 100 cm3 of water.

Liquid Water 
Water is the most abundant molecular substance on Earth. The Earth's 
grams of water in all its 
phases, contained mainly by the oceans [97'/0 as saline water covering 
contains an estimated 1.41 x

Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
70.8% of the Earth’s surface] with only 2% existing in the solid state as 
polar ice and glaciers. Ground water, aquifers, lakes, soil moisture and 
rivers account for the very small remainder. Like all liquids and solids, 
water exerts a vapour pressure and at any time there are about 1.3 x 1019 
grams in the atmosphere (0.0009% of the Earth’s total) and it is 
replenished every 12 days or s0.l This amount seems to be rather small, 
but if all the water vapour were to be precipitated evenly over the Earth’s 
surfzice instantaneously as rain there would be a layer 2.5 cm thick. The 
vapour is responsible for a substantial fraction of global warming, the 
retention of energy in the atmosphere, in the absence of which the Earth’s 
surface would be some 33 ‘C cooler on average. 
The triatomic water molecule has a bond angle of 104.5’ in its electronic 
ground state, and the O-H bond lengths are 96 pm. Its structure is shown 
in Figure 1.2(a). The electronegativity coefficients (Allred-Rochow)2 of 
hydrogen (2.1) and oxygen (3.5) are sufficiently different to make the 
molecule

of 1.84 D [l Debye (D) = 3.33564

of the molecule is shown in Figure 1.2(b), the 
oxygen end being negative with respect to the two hydrogen atoms. In 
addition to the normal van der Waals intermolecular forces that operate 
between molecules, the relatively “bare” protons of the water molecule 
and the electronegative - and so relatively electron-rich - oxygen 
atom allow the formation of hydrogen bonds between adjacent mole- 
cules in the liquid and solid states. Hydrogen bonds in water have bond 
enthalpies of about 20 kJ mol- I ,  which is weak compared with the 
strengths of single covalent bonds, which lie in the region 44 (Cs-Cs) to 
570 (H-F) kJ mol-’. However, H-bonds are responsible for the 
abnormally high values of the melting and boiling points of water, 
considering its low relative molar mass of 18.

of -0.66e on the oxygen atom and a partial charge of +0.33e on both 
hydrogen atoms. This is to be expected from the difference in 
electronegativity coefficients of the two atoms in each bond.

Over many years, rivers have carried the results of weathering of the rocks 
to the oceans, which have an enormous total ionic content as indicated by the 
data given in Table 1.2. Typically, when 1 dm3 of seawater is evaporated to 
dryness, 42.8 grams of solid are produced, which contains sodium chloride 
(58.9%), magnesium chloride hexahydrate [MgC12.6H20] (26.1 YO), sodium 
sulfate decahydrate [Na2S04. 1 0H20] (9.80/0), calcium sulfate (3.2%) and 
potassium sulfate (2%). Other compounds are present in minute amounts.

The major physical properties of water are given in Table 1.3. The 
abnornially high melting and boiling points already referred to are 
caused by hydrogen bonding in the solid and liquid phases, respectively. 
The structure of solid water (ice) formed at 0 "C and 100 kPa pressure, 
called ice-I,,, is shown in Figure 1.4.

Ice-Ih consists of sheets of oxygen atonis arranged in a chair-like 
manner, as shown in the margin, with hydrogen atonis asymmetrically 
placed between all the adjacent oxygen atoni pairs. The sheets are linked 
together with 0-H-0 
bonds. Each oxygen atom is surrounded by a 
nearly tetrahedral arrangement of oxygen atonis; there are three oxygen 
atoms at a distance of 276.5 pm (within the sheets) and a fourth oxygen 
atom at a distance of 275.2 pm (linking the sheets.) The arrangement of 
the hydrogen atoms is disordered because of their asymmetrical 
placement between the pairs of oxygen atoms at any one time. 
The somewhat open network structure of solid water determines that the 
density of ice at 0 "C is 916.7 kg m -3. That of liquid water at 0 "C is 
999.8 kg m - so solid ice floats on water, a fact noticed eventually by the 
captain of the Titanic! In liquid water at 0 "C there is still considerable

order because of the extensive hydrogen bonding. As the temperature rises, 
individual molecules have more translational, vibrational and rotational 
energy and need more space in which to move, thus causing most liquids 
(and solids) to expand and to have a lower density. This tendency is present 
in liquid water as the temperature increases, but additionally there is a 
progressive breakage of the hydrogen-bonded system that allows the open 
structure to collapse and to cause the density to increase. 
Between 0 "C and the temperature of maximum density (4 "C) the 
hydrogen bond collapse dominates over the normal thermal expansion. At 
temperatures above that of the maximum density, thermal expansion do- 
minates, and the density decreases progressively as the temperature rises. 
water is crucial to its solvent properties. In a vacuum, when two electric 
charges, 41 and q 2  are brought together from an infinite distance to a 
separation r, the potential energy, Ep, is given by the 
equation as:

When the same procedure takes place in a medium such as liquid water, 
the vacuum permittivity in equation (1.2) is replaced by the permittivity 
of the medium. Normally the permittivities for a variety of solvents are 
expressed as relative permittivities, E,, at given temperatures. Some typical 
values of relative permittivites are given in Table 1.4.

The great significance of the high value of relative permittivity of water 
is explored in Chapter 2. 
The electrical conductance of liquid water is very low compared with 
the values given by solutions of ionic compounds. Typically, the 
conductance of a 1 mol dm-3 solution of sodium chloride is about one

million times higher than that of water. This illustrates the effect of the 
dissociation of ionic substances when they are dissolved in water: 
Na'C1- (s) +. Na+ (aq) + C1- (aq) 
(1.3) 
The ionic product of water, K,, is related to the equilibrium: 
H20( 1) + H+(aq) + OH-(aq) 
(1.4) 
in which liquid water dissociates slightly to give equal concentrations of 
hydrated protons and hydrated hydroxide ions. The equilibrium constant 
for the reaction is: 
in which the a terms represent the ratios of the 
of the species 
shown as subscripts to those at the standard activity of 1 mol dm-3. The 
activity of liquid water in the solution is taken to be 1, because in dilute

fied temperature. If the temperature is not specified, it is assumed to be

In very dilute solutions, y may be taken to be 1 .O and the autoprotolysis 
constant may be formulated as: 
the square brackets indicating the molar concentration of the substance 
by the usual convention. The autoprotolysis constant of water is essential 
for the discussion of pH and the acid/base behaviour of solutes (dealt 
with in detail in Section 3.3). 
The standard enthalpy change for the ionization of water is +55.83 
kJ mol - , which means that the reverse reaction, which occurs when acids 
are neutralized by bases, is exothermic, i.e. A,H"= -55.83 kJ mol-'. 
The corresponding change in standard Gibbs energy is -79.9 kJ mol - ' . 
The reaction: 
H+(aq) + OH-(aq) ---$ H20( 1) 
(1.9) 
is thermodynainically spontaneous.

Equation (1.9) is also one of the most rapid chemical reactions. The 
second-order rate constant is one of the largest on record, 1.4 x 10" 
dm3 mol ' s ' at 25 * C. The reaction rate is diffusion controlled, i.e. the 
rate depends on the rate of diffusion of the reactants towards each other 
rather than their chemical characteristics, and there is a reaction every 
time the reactants meet. 
The very negative values of the thermodynamic properties of water 
given in Table 1.3 (the standard enthalpy of formation, AfH", and the 
standard Gibbs energy of formation, Afi") indicate the considerable 
thermodynamic stability of the substance compared with the constituent 
elements in their standard states. The contributions to the value of the 
standard enthalpy of formation of liquid water may be calculated from 
data for bond energy terms and the known enthalpy of vaporization 
(latent heat) of the liquid. The formation of gaseous water from 
dihydrogen and dioxygen in their standard states may be represented 
by the equations: 
H,(g) + 2H(g) 
2A,H"(H? g) = 2 x 218 kJ molF' 
(1.10) 
2H(g) + O(g) -+ H20(g) ArH " = -(2 x 463) = -926 kJ mol-' (1.12) 
The amount 463 kJ inol-' represents the enthalpy released when an 
0-H bond is formed; it is the 
for 0-H single bonds. 
The sum of the bond-breaking and bond-making stages gives the 
result: 
H2k) + '/202(g) + H20k) 
(1.13) 
for which AfH*(H20, g) = (2 x 21 8) + 248 - 926 = -242 kJ mol - '. The 
standard enthalpy of vaporization of water is + 44 kJ mol- I ,  so the 
liquid substance is 44 kJ mol- more stable than the gaseous form: 
H,O(g) 
+ H20(1) 
(1.14) 
and has A,-H*(H20, 1) = -242 -44 = -286 kJ mo1-I. The relatively 
high value for the enthalpy of vaporization arises from the extensive 
hydrogen bonding in the liquid phase. The thermodynamic stability of 
liquid water is thus shown to be mainly due to the greater bond strength 
of the 0-H bond compared with the strength of the H-H bond and half 
of the strength of the 0=0 bond, and is complemented by the high 
value of the enthalpy of vaporization of the liquid. The corresponding 
values 
for 
the 
Gibbs energy 
quantities 
are: AfC*(H20, 1) = 
-237 kJ mol-', with a contribution of -8 kJ mol-' froin the reverse 
of the Gibbs energy of vaporization, A"G"(H20,l) = + 8 kJ mol- '.

Liquid Water and 
the Hydration of Ions 
This chapter consists of a description of the structure of liquid water and 
the nature of ions in aqueous solution. The discussion is largely restricted 
to the interactions between monatomic ions with liquid water in which 
they become 
by acquiring a

including the important hydroxide ion. The

from the s- and p-block elements of the Periodic Table, and the derivation 
of values of their

, are described in 
considerable detail. 
2.i 
The Structure of Liquid Water 
The normal form of ice has an open structure, as described in Chapter 1. 
The oxygen atoms in the solid are surrounded by an approximately 
tetrahedral arrangement of four hydrogen atoms, two of which are 
covalently bonded to the oxygen atom; the other two are hydrogen

Figure 2.1 Two water mol- 
ecules participating in hydrogen 
bonding 
bonded, but covalently bonded to the oxygen atoms of adjacent water 
molecules. In liquid water there is some collapse of the crystalline 
structure, as shown by the increase in density compared to that of ice 
at 0 "C, but there is major retention of close-range order that persists to 
varying degrees up to the boiling point. This ensures that the boiling point 
is anomalously high compared with the other dihydrides of Group 16. 
There is constant interchange of hydrogen atoms between their oxygen 
atom partners, so that any particular environment for a water molecule is 
only transient. The interchange is rapid enough to allow only one proton 
NMR absorption line. The hydrogen bonding between two molecules of 
water is illustrated in Figure 2.1. 
The distance between the two oxygen atoms is 276 pm, which is only 
slightly smaller than twice the van der Waals radius of oxygen, 280 pm. 
The stability of the hydrogen bond is due to an enhanced dipole-dipole 
interaction, because of the attractive force between the partial negative 
charge (- 0.66e) on the oxygen atom and the partial positive charge on 
the hydrogen atom (+ 0.33e). The hydrogen nucleus is not efficiently 
shielded as are other nuclei with their closed shell electronic configura- 
tions ( e g .  the nucleus of Li+ is shielded by its Is2 configuration), and 
exerts a major electrostatic contribution to the hydrogen bond stability. 
2.2 
Ions and their Hydration 
When ionic compounds dissolve in water, their constituent positively and 
negatively charged ions become separated and hydrated in the solution 
(see equation 1.3). Many covalent compounds also dissolve in water to 
give solutions containing ions. For example, when hydrogen chloride 
dissolves in water, the covalent molecule dissociates 
(i.e. the 
chlorine atom retains both the bonding electrons to become an anion) to 
give a solution containing hydrated protons and hydrated chloride ions: 
(2.1) 
When sulfur(V1) oxide dissolves in water, a solution containing 
hydrated protons and hydrated hydrogen sulfate(V1) ions [HSOT (aq)] is 
produced, with some of the latter ions dissociating to give more hydrated 
protons and hydrated sulfate(V1) ions: 
(2.2) 
HCl(g) - H+(aq) + Cl-(aq) 
S03(g) + H20 - H+(aq) + HSOi(aq) 
In general, ionic compounds act as true solutes in that evaporation of 
the solvent yields the original compounds. Evaporation of a solution 
of HC1 will give gaseous HCl, but evaporation of the SO3 solution gives 
sulfuric( VI) acid, H2S04. 

Liquid Water and the Hydration of Ions 
15 
These examples are sufficient to form the basis of the discussion of the 
nature of cations and anions in aqueous solutions. In aqueous solution, 
ions are stabilized by their interaction with the solvent; they become 
symbolism. 
This is a broad generalization and is amplified by further discussions in 
the next sections and in the remainder of the book. 
and this state is indicated in equations by the 
2.2.1 The Nature of Ions in Aqueous Solutions 
Current ideas of ions in aqueous solutions consist of models that are 
consistent with electrostatic interactions between the ions and dipolar 
water molecules and with their effects on the localized structure of liquid 
water in the immediate vicinity of the ions. Ions in solid crystals have 
particular and individual sizes that are dependent upon the method 
used to assign the fractions of the minimum interionic distances to the 
participating cations and anions. The generally accepted values for ionic 
radii in crystals are based on the assumption that the ionic radius of the 
oxide ion is 140 pm. In an aqueous solution the individual ions have an 
interaction with the solvent that is associated with their ionic radius, but 
the resulting hydrated ion is difficult to quantify. Geometric considera- 
tions limit the number of water molecules that may be associated as 
immediate neighbours of the hydrated ion. The small number of 
immediate neighbours around a hydrated ion is known as the 
, a number that may have values from 4 to 9 for 
cations, depending on the ion size. Such values are determined by proton 
NMR spectroscopy. There are separate resonances arising from the 
bound water molecules and those in the bulk solution. 
A simple calculation reveals the limits of the numbers of water 
molecules that may be associated with an ion in a standard solution. 
A 1 mol dm-3 aqueous solution of sodium chloride has a density of 
1038 kg mW3 at 25 OC, so 1 dm’ of such a solution has a mass of 1038 g. 
One mole of the salt has a mass of 58.44 g, so the water in the litre of 
solution has a mass of 1038 - 58.44 = 979.56 g. This amount of water 
contains 979.56/18.015 = 54.4 moles of the liquid. The molar ratio of 
water molecules to ions in the 1 mol dmP3 aqueous solution of Na+(aq) 
and Cl-(aq) ions is therefore 54.4/2 = 27.2, assuming that the 
water molecules are shared equally between the cations and anions. 
This represents the theoretical upper limit of hydration of any one ion in 
a standard solution of 1 mol dm-’ concentration. The limit may be 
exceeded in more dilute solutions, but that depends upon the operation 
of forces over a relatively long range. Certainly, in more concentrated 
solutions, the limits of hydration of ions become more restricted as fewer 
water molecules are available to share out between the cation and anion 
assembly .

The water molecules forming the immediate neighbours of a cation 
may be regarded as forming 
to the cation, the higher 
energy non-bonding pair of electrons of the water molecule being used to 
form the coordinate bond. If this is the case, then the available vacant 
orbitals of the cation will determine the maximum coordination number. 
The actual coordination number achieved is the result of the optimization 
of the electronic and geometric factors. The maximum coordination 
numbers, dependent upon the valence orbitals available, are given in 
The water molecules that are nearest neighbours of cations form the 
. Some indication of the likely content of the 
primary hydration spheres of cations is given by the numbers of water 
molecules of crystallization in their solid compounds. For example, the 
compound BeS04.4H20 is better formulated as a 
[Be(H20)4]S04, which indicates that the four water molecules are 
coordinatively bonded to the Be2' ion. The Be2+ ion has an estimated 
radius of 3 1 pm and would be expected to form largely covalent bonds, or

give the more stable 
, [Be(H20)4]2+. The four water molecules

I 
are expected to be tetrahedrally arranged around the central Be2+ ion, 
both from a ligand-ligand repulsion viewpoint and also if the acceptor 
orbitals for the four coordinate bonds are the 2s and three 2p atomic 
orbitals of Be2 '. Solid compounds of lithium such as LiN03 - 3H20 and 
LiI 3H20 seem to imply that there are three water molecules associated 
with the lithium cations. This is not the case, as the coordination of the 
lithium cations consists of six water molecules hexagonally disposed

around each ion. There are chains of linked lithium cations in which three 
water molecules are shared as linking groups between two adjacent 
cations. The octahedral units share trigonal faces. In this case there are 
insufficient valence orbitals to enable the formation of coordinate bonds, 
and so the interactions must be regarded as purely electrostatic. 
The primary hydration spheres of the cations of the third period, Nat, 
Mgz+ and A13 + , probably consist of six water molecules, octahedrally 
arranged and possibly making use of the 3s, 3p and two of the 3d atomic 
orbitals of the cation. Those of the + 2  and + 3  ions of the transition 
elements are usually six-coordinate octahedrally arranged hexaaqua 
complexes, [M(H20)6]2+;3t, again making use of s, p and d combi- 
nations of the atomic orbitals of the central metal ion. Many of the +2 
and +3 oxidation states of the transition elements form crystalline 
compounds that have at least six water molecules of crystallization per 
transition metal ion, e.g. FeS04.7H20. This can be formulated as 
[Fe(H20)6]S04 - H20, with the seventh water molecule existing outside 
the coordination sphere of the Fe2+ ion and hydrogen bonded to the 
sulfate ions in the lattice. The primary hydration spheres of the +3 ions of 
the lanthanide f-block elements probably contain nine water molecules. 
Several of their +3 bromate(V) compounds crystallize with nine water 
molecules of crystallization, e.g. [Sm(H20)9]Br03, in which the nine water 
molecules are arranged in the form of a tri-capped trigonal prism around 
the central metal ion, as shown in Figure 2.2. 
There is a conceptual model of hydrated ions that includes the primary 
hydration shell as discussed above. 
consists 
of water molecules that are hydrogen bonded to those in the primary 
shell and experience some electrostatic attraction from the central ion. 
This secondary shell merges with the bulk liquid water. A diagram of the 
model is shown in Figure 2.3. X-ray diffraction measurements and NMR 
spectroscopy have revealed only two different environments for water 
molecules in solution of ions. These are associated with the primary 
hydration shell and water molecules in the bulk solution. Both methods 
are subject to deficiencies, because of the generally very rapid exchange 
of water molecules between various positions around ions and in the 
bulk liquid. Evidence from studies of the electrical conductivities of 
ions shows that when ions move under the influence of an electrical 
gradient they “tow” with them as many as 40 water molecules, in dilute 
solutions. 
The hydration of anions is regarded as being electrostatic with 
additional hydrogen bonding. The number of water molecules in the 
primary hydration sphere of an anion depends upon the size, charge and 
nature of the species. Monatomic anions such as the halide ions are 
expected to have primary hydration spheres similar to those of 
monatomic cations. Many aqueous anions consist of a central ion in a

bonded oxygen atoms, e.g. Cl'O-, C1"'02, CIvO< and Clv"O;. 
There 
can be hydrogen bonding between the ligand oxygen atoms and 
water molecules in the primary hydration sphere; this restricts the 
coordination numbers but contributes considerably to the stability of the 
hydrated ion. 
The models may be somewhat deficient, but estimates of the enthalpies 
and entropies of hydrated ions are accurate and are the subject of

2.2.2 The Hydrated Proton 
The hydrated proton, so far in this text, has been written as Hf (aq), but a 
bare proton might be expected to interact very strongly with a water 
molecule to give the ion, H30+, that would also be hydrated and written 
as H30'(aq). The interaction takes the form of an extra covalent bond 
between a hydrogen atom and the formally positively charged 0' ion, 
itself electronically identical with the nitrogen atom. The H30+ ion is 
isoelectronic with the NH3 molecule. The ion H30+ is called variously 
The ion H30 is identifiable in crystalline nitric(V) acid monohydrate, 
HN03-H20, which is better formulated as H30'N0<. 
The proton 
makes use of the higher energy non-bonding pair of electrons of the water 
molecule to form a covalent bond to the oxygen atom. The ion is 
trigonally pyramidal with HOH bond angles of 112", not much larger 
than those of a regular tetrahedron. The bond angle is found to depend 
upon the hydrogen bonding that occurs in the solid state and is, for 
instance, 126" in crystalline H30+ . HSOC. In solid HCl 2H20, better 
formulated as [HSO2]C1, there are dihydrated protons, H50; 
or 
(H20)2H+, in which the proton is midway between two water molecules, 
as shown in Figure 2.4. 
Other hydrated forms of the proton are found in the crystalline state, 
e.g. H70: 
or (H20)3H+ and H90: 
or (H20)4Ht, and the largest one is 
H130h+ or H(H20)h+. The protonated oxygen atom in these ions does not 
take part in hydrogen bonding; all hydrogen bonding to the primarily 
attached water molecules occurs between the three hydrogen atoms of 
the H30+ ion. This may be understood in terms of the partial positive 
charge on the oxygen atom, which reduces the atom's tendency to 
participate in hydrogen bonding. Further water molecules are hydrogen 
bonded to the three water molecules already attached to the H30+ ion. In 
aqueous solution the form H30'(aq) is the accepted way of representing 
the hydrated proton, but sometimes the shorter form H+(aq) is used to 
mean the same species. For example, the autoprotolysis of water is 
expressed as: 
7 
or 

Liquid Water and the Hydration of Ions 
I 9  
or: 
2H20(1) + H30+(aq) + OH-(aq) 
(2.5) 
Not so much attention is given to the form of the hydrated hydroxide 
anion, which is also subject to hydrogen bonded interactions and does 
exist in some crystals as H302 or (H20)OH- and has a symmetrical 
[HO-H-OH]- hydrogen bonded structure. Recent work5 has shown that 
the most probable form of the hydrated hydroxide ion is (H20)30H-, in 
which the hydroxide oxygen atom participates in hydrogen bonds with 
three water molecules. Exclusively, the hydrated hydroxide ion is 
formulated as OH-(aq) in chemical equations, 
2.3 Gibbs Energies and Enthalpies of Formation 
of Hydrated Ions 
This section is devoted to some basic thermodynamics, essential for the 
understanding of subsequent discussions. 
2.3. I Thermodynamic Conventions 
The conventional thermodynamic standard state values of the Gibbs 
energy of formation and standard enthalpy of formation of elements in 
their standard states are: AtC"= 0 and A&?*= 0. Conventional values of 
the standard molar Gibbs energy of formation and standard molar 
enthalpy of formation of the hydrated proton are: Afi*(H+, aq) = 0 
and AfH*(H+, aq) = 0. In addition, the standard molar entropy of the 
hydrated proton is taken as zero: S"(H', aq) = 0. This convention 
produces negative standard entropies for some ions. 
2.3.2 Standard Values for AfG * and AfH * for Some 
Aqueous Ions 
This section contains data for the standard values of the Gibbs energies of 
formation and enthalpies of formation of some aqueous ions. The 
manner of their derivation is described briefly.

The data are derived from thermodynamic information about standard 
reactions, such as the one for the formation of hydrated protons and 
hydrated chloride ions from dihydrogen and dichlorine: 
(2.6) 
for which A,H" is - 167.2 kJ mol- '. Because dihydrogen and dichlorine 
are elements in their standard states and the standard enthalpy of 
formation of the hydrated proton is taken to be zero, the overall enthalpy 
of the reaction is identical to the standard enthalpy of forination of the 
hydrated chloride anion. 
When strong bases neutralize strong acids in solutions that have molar 
concentrations of 1 mol dm-3, the enthalpy of the reaction is observed to 
be -55.83 kJ mol-I, irrespective of the 
(e.g. the chloride ion 
derivable from HCI and the sodium ion contained in NaOH) present. For 
example, when a standard solution (1 mol dm-3) of hydrochloric acid is 
neutralized by a standard solution (I mol dm-3) of sodium hydroxide, 
the change in enthalpy of the reaction is -55.83 kJ mol-'. Because the 
strong acid HCl and the strong base NaOH are 100% dissociated in 
aqueous solution, the 
H+(aq) + Cl-(aq) + Na+(aq) + OH-(aq) 
l/2H2(g) + 1/2C12(g) - H+(aq) + Cl-(aq) 
reaction may be written as: 
- Na+(aq) + Cl-(aq) + H20(1) 
(2.7) 
The counter ions, Na+(aq) and Cl-(aq), are effectively 
in 
that they do not affect the thermodynamics of the reaction and appear 
on both sides of equation (2.7). In many instances it is better to dispense 
with spectator ions in ionic equations, the neutralization reaction 
reducing to: 

Liquid Water and the Hydration of Ions 
21 
Hf(aq) + OH-(aq) - H20(1) 
(2.8) 
which expresses the chemistry occurring exactly. The value for A,H" 
for the neutralization reaction is -55.83 kJ mol-' and represents the 
difference in standard enthalpy of formation of liquid water (-285.83 
kJ mol-') and that of the hydrated hydroxide ion, AfH*(OH-, aq). 
The value of the latter quantity is calculated as: AfH*(OH-, aq) = 
-285.83+55.83 = - 230.0 kJ mol-'. 
Cations 
The results for the enthalpies of hydrated hydroxide and chloride anions 
may then be used to estimate the enthalpies of formation of the cations 
formed from soluble hydroxides or chlorides. For example, the reaction 
of sodium with liquid water: 
Na(s) + H20(1) - Na%q) + OH-(aq) + HZ(g) 
(2.9) 
has a standard enthalpy change of - 184.3 kJ mol-I, which is the sum of 
the standard enthalpies of formation of the two ions minus the standard 
enthalpy of formation of liquid water: 
-184.3 = AfH" (Na', aq) + AfH"(OH-, aq) - AfH*(H20, 1) 
which gives a value for AfH"(NaS, aq) = - 184.3 + 230 - 285.8 = 
-240.1 kJ mol-'.

The ionic compound caesium chloride, CsfC1-, dissolves readily in

The reaction for the formation of the hydrated ions is given as the sum of

by their respective additions of those for the two contributing reactions: 
(2.10)

ArH* = -443.0 + 17.6 = -425.4 kJ mol-' 
A,G*= -414.5 - 8.7 = -423.2 kJmol-' 
The enthalpy of formation of the aqueous chloride ion is known to 
be - 167.2 kJ mol-' (Table 2.2), so that of the aqueous caesium ion

may be calculated from the enthalpy of formation of the dissolved 
Cs'(aq) and Cl-(aq) ions as: ArH*(Csi, aq) = -425.4-( - 167.2) = 
-258.2 kJ mol-'. 
The enthalpies of formation of aqueous ions may be estimated in the 
manner described, but they are all dependent on the assumption of the 
reference zero: that the enthalpy of formation of the hydrated proton is 
zero. In order to study the effects of the interactions between water and 
ions, it is helpful to estimate values for the enthalpies of hydration of 
individual ions, and to compare the results with ionic radii and ionic 
charges. 
of an ion is defined as 
the enthalpy change occurring when one mole of the gaseous ion at 
100 kPa (1 bar) pressure is hydrated and forms a standard 1 mol dm-3 
aqueous solution, i.e. the enthalpy changes for the reactions: M"(g) - 
M'+(aq) for cations, X'-(g) - XI-(aq) for monatomic anions, and 
XO,-(g) - XO,-(aq) for oxoanions. M represents an atom of an 
electropositive element, 0.g. Cs or Ca, and X represents an atom of an 
electronegative element, e.g. C1 or S. 
To obtain an estimate of the cwmbined enthalpies of hydration of such 
cations and anions, the thermodynamic cycle shown in Figure 2.6 is 
helpful. In Figure 2.6 it is assumed that the element X is a halogen and 
forms a uni-negative ion. 
Figure 2.6 A thermochemical 
cycle for the formation of 
hydrated ions from their elements 
The cycle allows the overall enthalpy of formation of the aqueous 
solution of cations and anions to be sub-divided into stages whose 
enthalpy changes are known except for the two enthalpies of hydration, 
allowing their sum to be estimated. The equation to be solved is: 
Af H*(M'+, aq) + rArH*(X-, aq) 
= &H*(M, g) + _A,H*(X, g) + CJ1,S(M, S) + zE(X, g) 
+ AhydH*(Mr+, g) + zAI,~~H*(X-, 
g) 
(2.1 1) 
which may be rearranged to give the sum of the two enthalpies of 
hydration: 
A h y d m M - + ,  g> + 41ydH*(X-, g) 
= AfH*(MZ+, aq) + zAfH*(X-, aq) - A,H*(M, g) 
- zAaH*(X?, g) - XJI,z(M, g) - zE(X, g) 
(2.12) 

24 
Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
The I terms are the successive ionization energies of the element M, and 
the E term is the electron attachment energy of the element X. 
This treatment illustrates the inherent difficulty of the problem. Any 
cycle of this type will allow the calculation of szim of enthalpies of 
hydration of cations and anions, but it will not allow the estimation of the 
separate quantities. There are two ways of dealing with the matter. One is 
to use the conventional reference zero: that the enthalpy of hydration of 
the proton is zero, i.e. AhydH*(H+, g) = 0. The second approach is to 
estimate an absolute value for AhydH*(H +, g) that may be used to 
estimate the absolute values for enthalpies of hydration of any other ions. 
Both are exemplified in the text, but only the second is of general use in 
the study of the hydration of ions and the discussion of the factors that 
determine the values of enthalpies of hydration of individual ions. 
2.4.1 Conventional Enthalpies of Hydration of Ions 
of ions are those obtained by the first 
method, i.e. those using the convention that the enthalpy of hydration of 
the proton is zero. 
Cations 
Using the same symbolism as the previous sub-section, Figure 2.7 shows a 
thermodynamic cycle for the formation of the cation of element M by 
treating the element in its standard state with an acid solution containing 
hydrated protons and producing the hydrated cation and an equivalent 
amount of dihydrogen: 
(2.13) 
M(s) + zH+(aq) - M'+(aq) + :/:, H2(g) 
Figure 2.7 A thermochemica 
cycle for the formation of the 
hydrated Mz' ion 
The overall change of enthalpy represents the enthalpy of formation of 
the hydrated cation, M'+(aq), and has a value as given in Tables 2.2 and 
2.3 for particular cases. The value consists of contributions from the 
enthalpy of atomization of element M and the appropriate sum of its 
ionization enthalpies, and the enthalpy of hydration of the gaseous ion. 

Liquid Water and the Hydration of Ions 
25 
It also includes the enthalpy of ionization of the hydrogen atom (equal to, 
but opposite in sign to, the electron attachment enthalpy of the gaseous 
proton), the enthalpy of atomization of dihydrogen and the enthalpy of 
hydration of the proton. The enthalpy of formation of the cation is 
estimated by use of the equation: 
&H*(M'+, aq) = A,H*(M, g) - zAhydH*(H+, g) + Cl,,(M, 
g) 
4- 6.22 - z(~(H, 
g) 4- 6.2) + AhydH*(Mz+, g) 
- zA,H"(H, g) 
(2.14) 
The equation may be rearranged to give: 
AhydH*(Mz+, g) - ZAhydH*(H+, g) = A$f*((M'+, aq) 
(2.15) 
Since the second term on the left-hand side of equation (2.15) is 
conventionally set to zero, the equation may be used to estimate 
conventional values of enthalpies of hydration for a series of ions. The 
left-hand side of the equation represents the conventional value of the 
enthalpy of hydration of the M'+ ion: 
- Aaff*(M, g) - CI1+.Z(M, 
g) + zI(H, g) + zA,H*(H, g) 
AhydH*(M'+, 
= AhydH*(M'+, g) - ZAhydH*(H+, g) 
(2.16) 
The terms on the right-hand side of equation (2.15) are known with 
considerable accuracy. The conventional values for the enthalpies of 
hydration of the Group 1 cations are estimated from the data given in 
Table 2.4. 
Table 2.4

The estimated conventional values for the enthalpies of hydration of 
the Group 1 cations are very positive and give the wrong impression 
about the interaction of the gaseous ions with liquid water. This is 
because of the convention for the hydrated proton. The absolute values 
for the enthalpies of hydration for gaseous cations are given by the 
equation (rearranged equation 2.16): 
AhydH*(Mz+, g) = AhydH*(M'+, g)conv + =dhydH*(Hi, g)

Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
when an absolute value for the enthalpy of hydration of the proton is used 
instead of the conventional zero value. This is likely to be considerably 
negative, and when included in equation (2.17) would make the absolute 
values for the enthalpies of the Group 1 cations negative quantities. This 
is intuitively correct, as it would be expected that an interaction between a 
positive ion and dipolar water molecules would lead to the release of 
energy. The hydration process would be expected to be exothermic.

The overall change of enthalpy represents the enthalpy of formation of 
the hydrated anion, X-(aq), and has a value as given in Table 2.2 for 
particular cases. The value consists of contributions from enthalpy of 
atomization of element M and its electron attachment energy, and the 
enthalpy of hydration of the gaseous ion. It also includes the enthalpy of 
ionization of the hydrogen atom, the enthalpy of atomization of 
dihydrogen and the enthalpy of hydration of the proton. The enthalpy 
of formation of the anion is estimated by the equation: 
AfH*(X-, aq) = A,H"(H, g) + A,H*(X, g) + (I(H, g) + 6.2) 
(UX, g) - 6.2) 4- &dH*(H+, g)

(2.19) 
The equation may be rearranged (cancelling out the 6.2 terms) to give:

Since the second term on the left-hand side of equation (2.20) is conven- 
tionally set to zero, the equation may be used to estimate conventional 
values of enthalpies of hydration for a series of halide ions. The left-hand 
side of the equation (2.20) represents the conventional value of the en- 
thalpy of hydration of the X- ion: 
(2.21) 
The terms on the right-hand side of equation (2.20) are known with 
considerable accuracy. The conventional values for the enthalpies of 
hydration of the halide anions are estimated from the data given in 
Table 2.5.

The estimated conventional values for the enthalpies of hydration of 
the Group 17 halide anions are extremely negative and, as was the case 
with the Group 1 cations, the wrong impression about the interaction of 
the gaseous ions with liquid water is given. Intuitively, it might be 
expected that similarly charged ions, positive or negative, would interact 
electrostatically with water to roughly the same extent, and that 
their absolute values of enthalpies of hydration would be of the same 
order. The apparent discrepancies occur because of the convention 
regarding the hydrated proton. The absolute values for the enthalpies 
of hydration for gaseous anions are given by the equation (rearranged 
equation 2.21): 
(2.22) 
When an absolute value for the enthalpy of hydration of the proton is 
used in equation (2.22) it would have the effect of making the absolute 
enthalpies of hydration of the halide ions considerably less negative than 
the conventional values.

Plots of the conventional values for the enthalpies of hydration of 
the Group 1 cations and the Group 17 anions against the ionic radii 
of the ions are shown in Figure 2.9, using the values from 
Tables 2.4 and 2.5.

conventional enthalpies of

Trend lines are shown which emphasize that the values for 
and AhydH*(X-, g)'Onv vary with ionic radius. This 
is to be expected from simple electrostatic arguments. The smaller ions 
would be expected to have greater interactions with water than the larger 
ones. 
From the values for the conventional enthalpies of hydration of the 
Group 1 cations (Table 2.4) and those of the halide ions (Table 2.5), 
it is clear that they differ enormously. This leads to the quest for 
absolute values, which can be compared on a more equal basis. 
Equations (2.17) and (2.22) connect the conventional and absolute 
values of cations and anions respectively, and an approximate value 
for AI,ydH*(Hf, g) may be obtained by comparing the conventional 
values of the enthalpies of hydration of the Group I cations and the 
Group 17 halide anions by using equation (2.16) modified for singly 
charged cations: 
A 
H*(MI+, ,)COI~V 
hYd 
(2.23) 
and equation (2.2 1). The difference between AhydH*(M +, g)conv and 
AhydH*(X-, g)c"nv [i.e. the difference between equation (2.23) and 
equation (2.21)] is given by the equation: 

Liquid Water and the Hydration of Ions 
29 
This would allow the estimation of the value of AllyC,H*(H+, g) OM/)' if the 
terms representing the absolute values for the enthalpies of hydration of 
the two ions cancel out, so that: 
A hyd H*(M+,g)Co"v - AhydH*(X-,g)Col'V = -2AhydH*(H+,g) 
(2.25) 
This condition is impossible to realize with existing ions, but an empirical 
approach yields dividends. 
The mean value of the conventional enthalpies of hydration of the 
Group I cations is + 728.3 kJ mol- ' and that of the conventional enthal- 
pies of hydration of the Group 17 anions is -1480.8 kJ mol-I. If it is 
assumed that the taking of means allows for the variations of the enthalpy 
terms with ion size and arranges for AhydH*(Mr+, g) to be equal to 
AilydH*(X-, g), the difference between the two mean values may be equated 
to twice the value for the absolute enthalpy of hydration of the proton: 
728.3 - (-1480.8) = -2Ahyd/I*(H+, g) 
giving (rounded off to 4 figures) AhydH*(Hi , g) = - 1105 kJ niol-I. 
The mean ionic radii of the Group 1 cations and the Group 17 anions are 
127 pm and 183 pm, respectively, a difference of 56 pm. Figure 2.10 shows 
plots similar to those in Figure 2.9, but the values of AhvdH* (M' , g) are 
plotted at points where the radii of the Group 1 cations are 50 pm greater 
than their actual ionic radii. Also, the values of Ahy~H*(Mzf,

and the value of 1 1 10 kJ mol - for AhyCJI*(H + , g) were optimized by the 
author, using a spreadsheet to arrange that the trend lines for the cation 
and anion values were as coincident as possible.

Liquid Water and the Hydration of Ions

The results for the enthalpies of hydration of the Group 1 cations and 
the Group 17 anions show that their values become less negative as the 
ionic radii of the ions increase. 
The process of hydration of an ion refers to the conversion of one mole 
of the gaseous ions under standard conditions at a pressure of 1 bar to the 
hydrated ions at a molar concentration of 1 mol dm-3. The process may 
be divided into two parts. These are the compression of the one mole of 
gaseous ions into a volume of 1 dm' followed by the interaction of the 
ions with water to produce the hydrated ions. Assuming ideal gas 
behaviour, the compression of one mole of a gas at standard pressure and 
at 298.15 K into a volume of 1 dm3 requires the expenditure of enthalpy 
given by RT ln(24.79/1.0) = +7.96 kJ mol- *. The quoted values of ionic 
hydration enthalpies include a contribution from the compression of the 
gaseous ions and the enthalpy changes associated with the hydration 
process are given by the equation: 
AhydH*(hydration only) = AhydH*- 7.96 
(2.28) 
The discrepancy introduced by ignoring the compression term is only 
slight and represents no more than a 2% difference from the absolute 
values usually used. It is normally ignored in view of the uncertainties 
associated with the problem of dividing the conventional enthalpies of 
hydration of cation-anion pairs into individual values. 
2.6.1 The Born Equations for the Hydration of Ions 
Max Born introduced a theoretical approach to the estimation of 
absolute enthalpies of hydration of ions based on electrostatic theory. 
Equation (1.2) is fundamental to electrostatic theory. It may be altered to: 
E, = 414 
(2.29) 

32 
Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
where the potential energy of a charge ql in the presence of another 
charge y? may be expressed in terms of the Coulomb potential, 4: 
(2.30) 
The units of 4 are J C-' or V (volts). When a potential is multiplied by a 
charge, as in equation (2.29), the result has units of joules, 1 J = 1 V C. 
The Born model of an ion is a sphere of charge q and radius I - ,  in a medium 
of permittivity c. The potential at the surface of the sphere is: 
q 2  
4=47[1:01. 
(2.3 1) 
To charge up such a sphere from 0 to y is calculated as the work, 111, 
expressed by the integral of 6dq: 
0- 
cl 
4ni;rI 
(2.32) 
The work needed to charge the same sphere to the charge q = i e  in a 
vacuum (I: = co) is: 
(2.33) 
In a medium with a relative permittivity of E,. ( i :  = cot;,-), the work needed 
to charge the sphere to the same extent would be: 
(2.34) 
The work needed to transfer the ion from a vacuum to the medium is 
given by: 
(2.35) 
Multiplying the work of transfer by the Avogadro constant gives the 
molar change in Gibbs energy of hydration when c,. is that of liquid water 
(78.54 at 25 "C). Equation (2.35), incorporating the Avogadro constant, 
NA, and the value for the relative permittivity of water, may be 
rearranged to give: 
Putting the values of the constants into equation (2.36) gives:

The Born equations (2.37) and (2.43) are widely used, but suffer 
from lack of accurate information about the real sizes of ions in 
aqueous solutions. In the derivations used above, ionic radii have 
been used, but these give numerical answers that are exaggerated, 
in particular for those of cations. The values of the absolute enthalpies 
of hydration of the ions of Table 2.3 are given in Table 2.8, based 
on the conventional values with that of the proton taken to be 
- 1 I10 kJ inol-'. 
The values for the enthalpies of hydration of ions may be forced to 
conform to the expectations of the Born equation (2.43) by estimating a 
suitable value for each ionic radius or by estimating an apparent ionic 
charge.

Generally, the first method has been used, and Table 2.9 gives the ionic 
radii, the radii derived from equation (2.43) from the appropriate values 
of the enthalpies of hydration, and the differences between the two radii. 
If an amount between 54 and 79 pm (the mean additive amount is 67 & 8 
pm, i.e. 
one standard deviation) is added to the ionic radii, the Born 
equation (2.43) gives realistic values for the absolute enthalpies of 
hydration of the ions of Table 2.8. 
The alternative method is to bring the equation (2.43) values into 
agreement with the estimated values of enthalpies of hydration of 
the same ions by optimizing their ionic charges. This approach yields 
the apparent charges given in Table 2.10 for the ions under 
considera tion. 
The two methods of bringing the estimated values of the absolute 
enthalpies of hydration into agreement with the results from equation 
(2.43) deserve more comment. For example, the lithium cation has an 
ionic radius of 76 pm and this value gives -918 kJ mol-' when used in 
equation (2.43). This is a factor of 918/538 = 1.71 greater negative value 
than the estimated value. Only by adding 53.5 pm to the ionic radius 
of the lithium cation does equation (2.43) give a value in agreement with 
the estimated one. The procedure increases the size of the ion to reduce 
the effectiveness of its interaction with the solvent. The alternative 
approach keeps the radii equal to that in the solid state, but optimizes 
the ionic charge to ensure agreement between the estimated values of the 
hydration enthalpies and equation (2.43). Both ways indicate that the 
positive charges on the cations are delocalized, and therefore have 
electrostatic effects somewhat less than those expected for more 
localized charges. 

Liquid Water and the Hydration of Ions 
35 
The very negative value of the estimated enthalpy of hydration of the 
proton is consistent with a “Born” radius of 63 pm (from equation 2.43). 
Since that equation overestimates the ionic radius by -67 pm it follows 
that a “bare” proton (radius -0 pm) would be expected to have such a 
very negative enthalpy of hydration. Studies of the proton and water in 
the gas phase have shown that the stepwise additions of water molecules 
in the reaction: 
(2.44) 
have the standard enthalpy changes given in Table 2.11. 
The addition of the first water molecule to the proton causes a much 
greater release of enthalpy than the following stages and must be 
associated with the formation of a covalent bond as the ion H30’(g) is 
produced. The two O-H bonds in the gaseous water molecule have 
a combined strength of 463 X 2 = 926 kJ mol-’ and if the amount of 690 
kJ mol- is added the three bonds of the H30+ ion each have strengths of 
(926+690)/3 = 539 kJ mol-’. Comparing the bond strengths of O-H 
(463 kJ mol- ’) and F-H (570 kJ mol- ’), the value of 539 kJ mol- ’ for the 
bonds in H30f appears to be consistent with the raised electronegativity 
of the 0 atom. If the amount 690 kJ mol-’ is added to the value of the 
enthalpy of hydration of the proton, -1 1 10 + 690 = - 420 kJ mol- I ,  the 
residual value of -420 kJ mol-’ is equivalent to the enthalpy of 
hydration of the H30’ ion. When subjected to the Born equation (2.43) 
this value yields an effective radius of 166 pm. The equation overestimates 
the radii by 67 pm so the radius of the H30+ ion is 99 pm. This distance is 
not significantly different from the O-H distance of 96 pm and places the 
H30+ ion between Lit and Naf in terms of ionic radius. 
The subsequent additions of water molecules are associated with 
significantly smaller releases of enthalpy and are consistent with the 
formation of hydrogen bonds. The total enthalpy change for the 
production of the ion H+(H20)&) is -11 16 kJ mol-’, a value not 
significantly different from that adopted for the enthalpy of hydration 
of the proton. Further additions of water molecules to the H+(H20)&) 
ion are associated with enthalpy changes that are not significantly 
different from the enthalpy of evaporation of water (44 kJ mol- ’) and do 
not appear to add to the stability of the hydrated proton. 
Table 2.12 gives the absolute enthalpies of hydration for some anions. 
The values are derived from thermochemical cycle calculations using the 
enthalpies of solution in water of various salts containing the anions and 
the lattice enthalpies of the solid salts.

The data of Table 2.12 show that some of the absolute enthalpies of 
hydration of anions follow the general trend of increasing negative values 
as the ionic radius decreases and as the ionic charge increases, in line with 
expectations from equation (2.43). As with cations, equation (2.43) 
produces values for the enthalpies of hydration of the monatomic halide 
anions that are slightly different from the thermocheniically estimated 
ones, and which may be brought into agreement by slight alterations in 
the radii used or in the ionic charges. As is the case with cations, the 
indication is that anions do not exactly conform to the hard sphere 
model, but with anions the model is not greatly in error. 

Liquid Water and the Hydration of Ions 
37 
As the charge on anions increases there is the expected increase in the 
negative values of their enthalpies of hydration, e.g. compare the values for 
ClO,, SO:- and PO:-. The considerably negative value of the enthalpy of 
hydration of the OH- ion is consistent with its relatively small 
thermochemical radius of 152 pm and the capacity that both atoms have 
of participating in strong hydrogen bonding with water molecules. 
The cyanide ion is somewhat larger (1 87 pm) than the hydroxide ion 
and does not share its capacity to form strong hydrogen bonds. Its 
enthalpy of hydration is consequently considerably less negative than 
that of OH-. The enthalpies of hydration of NO, (200 pm) and ClO, 
(208 pm) are very similar, for the two oxoanions possessing a central 
atom in the + 5 state. The series of halate(V) ions, Clog, BrOg (214 pm) 
and 10; (2 18 pm), show the opposite trend from that expected from their 
radii. The explanation lies in the differences in electronegativities of the 
central halogen atoms. The very electronegative Clv drains negative 
charge away from the ligand oxygen atoms and reduces their capacity to 
enter into strong hydrogen bonding, whereas in the iodate(V) ion the 
iodine(V) central atom is not so electronegative and allows the ligand 
oxygen atoms to participate more fully in hydrogen bonding. The 
bromate(V) ion has intermediate properties.

Standard Molar Entropies of Hydration of Ions 
The calculation of the values for the standard molar entropies of 
hydration of ions requires some groundwork using the data presented in 
the following sub-section. 
2.7.1 Standard Molar Entropies, S", for Some Aqueous Ions 
In this section the standard molar entropies of a small selection of cations 
and anions are tabulated and the manner of their derivation discussed. 
The values themselves are required in the calculation of entropies of 
hydration of ions, discussed in Section 2.7.2. 
Cations 
The conventional standard entropies of some main group cations are given 
in Table 2.13, which also includes the standard entropies of the elements. 
The conventional standard entropy of an aqueous cation may be 
calculated from the change in standard entropy for its formation and the 
standard entropies of the element and that of dihydrogen, as shown in the 
following example for the aqueous sodium ion.

Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
The calculation of the standard entropy of the cation depends upon the 
conventional assumption that the standard entropy of the hydrated 
proton is zero. A general equation for the standard entropy of an ion 
M'+(aq), including the term for the standard entropy of the hydrated 
proton(s), may be written as: 
Se(MZ+, aq) = AfS*(Mr+, aq) -:I? S*(H2, g) + S*(M, s) 
+zS*(H+, aq) 
(2.49) 
The last term on the right-hand side is conventionally taken to be zero, so 
the conventional standard entropies of M'+ ions are given by the 
equation: 
(2.50) 
S+(M'+, aq)"onv - 
- A$*(M'+, aq) -=/? S"(H2, g) + S*(M, s) 
Equation (2.49) can then be written as: 
S*(M", aq) = S*(M'+, aq)'OnV + zS*(H+, aq) 
(2.5 1)

Anions 
The conventional standard molar entropies of some anions and some 
elements are given in Table 2.14. 
The conventional standard entropy of an monatomic aqueous anion is 
calculated from the change in standard entropy for its formation and the 
standard entropies of the element and that of dihydrogen, as shown in the 
following worked example for the aqueous chloride ion. 
A general equation for the calculation of the standard entropy of a 
monatomic anion is: 
S*(X-, aq) = AfS*(X-, aq) + 1/J*(X2, g, 1 or s) 
+ b2S*(H2, g) - S*(H+, aq)

Equation (2.55) can then be written as: 
S"(X-, aq) = S*(X-, aq)"OnV - S"(H+, aq) 
(2.57) 
Work done with electrochemical cells, with particular reference to the 
temperature dependence of their potentials, has demonstrated that an 
accurate value for S"(H + , aq) is - 20.9 J K - ' mol- I .  Table 2.15 gives the 
absolute molar entropies for the ions under consideration. The values of 
the absolute standard molar entropies of the ions in Table 2.15 are derived 
by using the data from Tables 2.13 and 2.14 in equations (2.51) and (2.57). 
2.7.2 Absolute Standard Molar Entropies of 
Hydration of Ions 
+1035 
For the hydration processes M'+(g) - M' '(aq) and X-(g) - X-(as), 
the entropy changes depend upon the values of the entropies of the 
gaseous ions as well as the absolute entropies of the aqueous ions: 
+127.4 
(B 
(2.58) 
AhydS"(X-, g) = S"(X-, aq) - S*(X-, g) 
(2.59) 
The standard (298.15 K and lo2 kPa pressure) entropies of monatomic 
ions in the gas phase may be estimated by using the Sackur-Tetrode 
equation: 
S" = 3/*R lnA, + 108.9 
(2.60) 
where A ,  is the relative atomic mass of the monatomic ion and the second 
term is the value of a collection of physical constants, the temperature 
(taken to be 298.15 K) and pressure (taken to be lo2 kPa = 1 bar.) 
The Sackur-Tetrode entropies for one mole of the gaseous ions at 
25 "C and lo2 kPa pressure, i.e. with a volume of 24.79 dm3, S"(M+, g), 
are given in Table 2.16 for the ions under consideration. The values of the 
absolute standard entropies of hydration of the ions are given in Table 
2.17. The entries are calculated from the data in Tables 2.15 and 2.16 by 
using equations (2.58) and (2.59). 
The values of the absolute standard entropies of hydration are 
consistent with expectation in that they become less negative as the ion 
size increases. The lithium cation, being the smallest of Group 1, has the 
greatest effect on the freedom of movement of the water molecules in its 
hydration sphere, and causes the greatest reduction in entropy when it 
becomes hydrated. The fluoride anion, being the smallest of Group 17, 
has the greatest effect on the freedom of movement of the water molecules 
in its hydration sphere and causes the greatest reduction in entropy when 
it becomes hydrated. 

Liquid Water and the Hydration of Ions 
41 
Inspection of the values for the entropies of hydration of the Group 2 
cations in Table 2.17 shows that, with the exception of that for Be2+, the 
values become less negative as the ionic radius increases. This effect is 
similar to that observed for the Group 1 cations. The exception of Be2+ 
to the general trend is possibly because of its tendency to have a 
tetrahedral coordination that causes it to affect fewer molecules of water 
in the hydration process. 
A comparison of the entropies of hydration of Na+, Mg2+ and A13+ 
shows that they become much more negative as the positive charge on the 
cation increases. The increasing charge would be expected to be more and 
more effective in restricting the movement of water molecules, and there 
would be more water molecules participating in the restricted volume of 
the hydration spheres of the ions. The decreasing ionic radius in the series 
amplifies the trend.

Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
The entropy of hydration of the proton has a value intermediate between 
those of Lit and Na+. This is consistent with the hydrated proton 
consisting of the hydrated hydroxonium ion, H30+ (as), rather than 
being the hydrated fundamental particle. The hydrated proton must have 
a radius intermediate between those of Lit and Na+, consistent with its 
entropy of hydration.

3.1 
Acids and Bases in Aqueous Solutions 
The subject of acids and bases is very extensive. The discussion in this 
book is restricted to the definitions of acids and bases in aqueous 
solutions and their applications to the nature of ions in aqueous solutions 
and their stabilities. The two main definitions are those accredited to

The equilibrium constant (the acid dissociation constant), K,, is given by: 
(i) Brransted and Lowry and (ii) G. N. Lewis. They are the ones that are 
currently in most use by chemists, but the first one is specifically relevant 
to aqueous solutions. The definitions are summarized in Table 3.1. 
3.2 Bransted and Lowry Acids and Bases 
A 
is defined as a

systems: those in which 
expressing proton transfer in aqueous solution is: 
as a

can occur. A general equation 
(3.1) 
where AH represents a general acid with a dissociable proton and B 
represents a general base which can accept a proton. In the reverse 
process, where the proton is donated by the BHf ion to the anion A-, 
BH + is called the 
of the base B and the anion A- is called 
the 
of the acid AH. 
The strength of a Brransted-Lowry acid is quantified in terms of the 
magnitude of the equilibrium constant for the ionization reaction in 
which the solvent acts as the base, e.g. for the aqueous system, the general 
reaction is: 
AH(aq) + B(aq) e A-(aq) + BHS(aq) 
where the a terms represent the activities of the sub-scripted species. The 
activity of a substance is given by: 
a = yIa" 
(3.5) 
the product of the activity coefficient, y, and the molar concentration, 
c', of the substance divided by the standard activity, a", equal to 1 
mol dm-3. 
In the case of the solvent (water, concentration = 55.5 mol dm-3), its 
standard activity is usually taken to be 1. For solvents, the definition of 
activity is the ratio of its vapour pressure when acting as a solvent, p ,  
divided by the vapour pressure of the pure solvent, p", taken as the 
standard state: 
For dilute solutions p = p" and asolvent 
= 1.

Thus the equilibrium constant for acid dissociation may be written as:

Activity coefficients are introduced into equations such as (3.7) to

be taken to be 1 .O. The equilibrium constant may, under those conditions, 
be represented by the equation:

Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
The negative pK1 values of the “strong” acids, HC1, HC104, H2S04 and 
HN03, indicate that in aqueous solution they are, for all practical 
purposes, completely dissociated. Sulfuric acid is 
or 
, i.e. it 
has two dissociable protons, and although the first dissociation is coniplete 
in aqueous solution, the second dissociation (pK2 = 1.99) indicates that the 
HS04- ion is not a particularly strong acid. Phosphoric acid is 
acids of 
pK, values that increase by about five units for successive dissociations. 
The data given in Table 3.2 may be interpreted for a general acid H-A, 
using thermochemical cycles, in terms of the enthalpy changes 
accompanying the reactions: 
, and exhibits a general pattern for 
Hf(g> + A-(g) - Hf(aq) + A-(aq) 
(3.15) 
where A is the residue of the HA molecule after dissociation of the 
hydrogen atom. 
Three observations are discussed in this text: (i) the weak acidity of HF 
compared with the other halogen halides; (ii) the weak acidity of HCN; 
and (iii) the increasing acid strength with the oxidation state of the central 
element in the oxoacid series H3B03, H?C03 and HN03 of the second 
period of the Periodic Table, and H3P04, H2S04 and HC104 of the third 
period. 
3.2.1 The Weak Acid Strength of HF 
Hydrogen fluoride in aqueous solution is a weak acid, characterized by its 
pK, value of 3.2. By comparison, the other hydrogen halides are extremely 
strong acids in aqueous solution; all three are fully dissociated in dilute 
solution, and their pK,, values may be estimated by thermochemical cycle 
calculations. The therniochemical cycle shown in Figure 3.1 represents the 
various processes as the aqueous hydrogen halide, HX, is converted to a 
solution containing hydrated protons and hydrated halide ions. The 
enthalpy of acid dissociation of the HX(aq) compound is given by:

The values of AdI,JT(HX. as) for both acids are considerably negative 
and would contribute those negative amounts to the Gibbs energy 
changes for the dissociation processes. Only if the changes in Gibbs 
energy for the dissociations are positive would the acids be weak. The 
conclusion may only be reached by considering the entropy changes that 
occur when the compounds dissociate. The TAdl,,Su terms for HF and 
HCI are -29 and - 13 kJ mol-', respectively, and these produce values of 
Ad,,,G*(HF, aq) = + 17 kJ mol-' and of Ad1,,G"(HCI, as) = -43 kJ 
rnol-'. Using the relationship -AG"= 
RTlnK',, the pKc, values for the two 
acids are 3.0 and -7.5, respectively. There are three enthalpy factors that 
decide the difference between the enthalpies of dissociation of H F  and 
HC1. HF in aqueous solution is stabilized by extensive hydrogen bonding 
and the H-F bond strength is high. These two factors are offset somewhat 
by the very negative value of the hydration enthalpy of the fluoride ion. 
HC1 is not significantly hydrogen bonded in solution, and it is more easily 
dissociated in the gas phase. These two factors are offset by a less negative 

50 
Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
value of the hydration enthalpy of the chloride ion. The deciding factor in 
making the Gibbs energy of dissociation for HF positive is the overall 
entropy change. The nuin differences in entropy changes between the two 
acids lies with the entropies of hydration of the two negative ions; 
AhydS*(F-, g) = -138.5 J K-' mol-' and AhytlS*(C1-, g) = -76.3 J K-' 
mol-I, the difference of -62.2 J IS-' mo1-l amounting to a difference of 
-18.5 kJ mol-' in the TAdi,,S* terms. 
A further complication with HF in aqueous solution is that infrared 
spectroscopic studies' have shown the presence of a high concentration of 
H30+ ions, although they are highly associated with fluoride ions by 
hydrogen bonding: H30+. - - F-. It is argued that this association has a 
drastic effect on the activity coefficient of the hydrogen ion, and that this 
results in the high value of pK, for HF. 
3.2.2 The Weak Acid Strength of HCN 
The cyanide ion is sometimes described as a pseudo-halide ion, i.e. it 
behaves much like a halide ion, It has a radius of 187 pm, not very 
different from the 181 pm radius of the chloride ion, yet HCI is a very 
strong acid and HCN is very weak, the difference between the two pK, 
values being about 16 units. The thermocheniical cycle shown in Figure 
3.1 is also applicable to the HCl/HCN comparison, and appropriate data 
are given in Table 3.4.

The difference in the two values for enthalpy of dissociation of 
56 + 42 = 98 kJ mol-' is equivalent to a difference in pK, of 17 units in 
favour of HC1 being the stronger acid. The factors that contribute to 
reducing the value for HCN are its high H-CN dissociation enthalpy, its 
relatively large negative electron attachment enthalpy, and its relatively 
less negative value for the enthalpy of hydration of the ion.

3.2.3 The Dependence of Acid Strengths of Oxoacids 
on the Oxidation State of the Central Element 
Two comparisons are discussed in this section: (a) the acid strengths 
of the oxoacids of the second period, H3B03, H2C03 and HN03, and 
(b) those of the oxoacids of the third period, H3P04, H2S04 and HC104. 
(a) Boric acid, H3B03, is better formulated as boron trihydroxide, 
B(OH)3, and is a very weak acid with a pK1 of 9.27. Even in a solution of 1 
mol dm-3 NaOH the acid is only dissociated as far as the removal of the 
first proton. Carbonic acid, H2C03, is another hydroxoacid and is better 
formulated as OC(OH)2. Although still a weak acid, it is considerably 
stronger than boric acid. In aqueous solution its chemistry is complicated 
by the presence of hydrated carbon dioxide, C02(aq), in addition to the 
undissociated acid. The first dissociation of carbonic acid is governed by 
the equation: 
(3.17) 
with K1 having a value of 4.16 x lov7 (pKI = 6.38) if the [H2C03] term 
represents all the neutral aqueous carbon dioxide. If the two fornis of the 
aqueous oxide are distinguished and the real value of the undissociated 
carbonic acid used in equation (3.20), the value of K1 becomes 2 x low4 
(pK1 = 3.7). This latter value is a better representation of the acid strength 
of carbonic acid, and shows it to be considerably stronger than boric acid. 
Nitric(V) acid may be formulated as a hydroxoacid, 02N(OH), and is a 
very strong acid. In the series B(OH)3, OC(OH)2, 02N(OH), the 
oxidation state of the central atom increases, i.e. B"', C", 
NV, and is 
the main cause of the increased acid strength, the more oxidized central 
atom having greater electronegativity and attraction for the electrons that 
are used to bind the oxygen atoms to it. The greater the share of these 
bonding electrons is, the weaker the 0-H bond becomes, and this 
facilitates the dissociation of a proton. This is a generally observed 
phenomenon. The pK1 values of the three acids are 9.3, 3.7 and -1.37, 
decreasing by 4.6 and 5.07 units for each successive increase in the 
oxidation number of the central atom. 
(b) In the third period oxoacids, H3P04, H2SO4 and HC104, there is 
also an increase of acid strength as the oxidation state of the central atom 
increases (+5 - 
+6 - 
+7). The relatively strong phosphoric acid, 
OP(OH)3, has a pKI value of 2.16, but in sulfuric acid, 02S(OH),, the 
Svl central atom has a greater effect on the 0-H bond strength, to the 
extent of making the pK1 value negative. This trend continues with 
chloric(V1I) acid having a very negative pK1 value. Estimates of negative 
pK values are not very reliable, and the best evidence for considering 

52 
Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
HC104 to be a stronger acid than sulfuric acid is that in a mixture of the 
two compounds the sulfuric acid molecule is protonated: 
HC104 + H2S04 - H3SOZ + ClO, 
(3.18) 
Pauling stated two rules for the magnitudes of the pK values of 
hydroxoacids: 
1. 
2. 
For a given hydroxoacid the successive pK values increase by 5 units. 
For a hydroxoacid O,,E(OH),, the acid strength depends on the 
values of m, as shown in Table 3.5.

For each increase in the value of ~n by one, the oxidation state of the 
central atom rises by two units, with the consequent increase in acid 
strength as the 0-H bond strength decreases. The increase in acid 
strength with the electronegativity of the central atom is dominated by the 
number of formal element-oxygen double bonds. These concentrate 
electronic charge in the regions far froin the hydroxo group that is 
participating in the dissociation process. In contrast, the many hydroxide 
compounds of electropositive elements, e.g. Na and Ca, are basic; they 
dissociate into cations of the electropositive elements and hydroxide ions. 
Those soluble in water are strong alkalis. 
3.3 
pH and the pH Scale 
The autoprotolysis of liquid water was introduced in Chapter 1. The 
process is one of proton transfer between two molecules, as indicated by 
the equilibrium: 
2H20(1) + H30+(aq) + OH-(aq) 
(3.19) 
The positive ion is a hydrated hydrogen ion and the negative ion is a water 
molecule minus one hydrogen ion. The water molecules act equally as 
acids and bases; this type of behaviour is termed amphiprotic. The extent 
of the autoionization is very slight. The autoprotolysis constant, 

Acids and Bases; Forms of Ions in Aqueous Solution; Ion Hydrolysis & Compound Solubility 
53 
K, (the equilibrium constant for the process described by equation 3.19), 
has a value of 1.0 x 
(298.15 K): 
Expressed in logarithmic form this becomes: 
pK, = pH + pOH = 14 
(3.20) 
(3.21) 
where pH = - 1 0 g ~ ~ a ~ , ~ +  
and pOH = -logloaoH-. 
Pure water containing no dissolved gases possesses equal concen- 
trations of hydronium and hydroxide ions, so that pH = pOH = 7.0 at 
298.15 K. This is defined as a 
. This allows a practical 
definition of acidic and basic behaviour. Any substance dissolved in water 
which produces a pH below 7 is termed an acid and any substance 
dissolved in water which produces a pH greater than 7 is called a base. 
Substances typical of acids and bases are, respectively, HCl and NaOH. 
Hydrogen chloride dissolves in water with practically complete dissociation 
into hydrated protons and hydrated chloride ions. Sodium hydroxide 
dissolves in water to give a solution containing hydrated sodium ions and 
hydrated hydroxide ions. Table 3.6 gives values of the mean ionic activity 
coefficients, y*, at different concentrations and indicates the pH values and 
those expected if the activity coefficients are assumed to be unity.

The deviations from ideality expressed by the right-hand pH column of 
Table 3.6, are not great, and are ignored unless stricter accuracy is required. 
The pH values produced by 1 mol dm-3 solutions of HC1 and NaOH, 
i.e. 0 and 14 respectively, define the practical range in which activity 
coefficients of H + (as) and OH-(aq) may be ignored for general purposes, 
and subsidiary definitions of pH and pOH may be used: pH = -loglo[Ht] 
and pOH = -log1o[OH-]. 
The square brackets indicate the molar 
concentration of the species enclosed as a ratio to the standard molar 
concentration of I mol dm-3. 
3.4 
Factors Influencing Acidic and Basic Behaviour 
in Aqueous Solutions 
Some binary hydrides (e.g. those of Groups 16 and 17) behave as acids in 
aqueous solution, but the majority of acids are oxoacids derived from 
acidic oxides. This discussion is restricted to the factors influencing the 
production of acids or bases when oxides dissolve in water. An oxide can 
be acidic, 
(i.e. acidic or basic depending upon conditions) or 
basic. 
A general understanding of oxide behaviour may be achieved by a 
consideration of the E-0-H 
grouping in the hydroxide produced by the 
reaction of an oxide with water (E representing any element): 
EO + HZO + E(OH)2 
(3.22) 
The compound behaves as an acid if the 0-H bond is broken in a 
heterolytic manner, i.e. the oxygen atom retains both of the bonding 
electrons: 
E-0-H - E-0-(aq) + H+(aq) 
(3.23) 
If the E-0 bond breaks in a siinilar heterolytic manner, the compound 
exhibits basic behaviour: 
E-0-H - Ef(aq) + OH-(aq) 
(3.24) 
Intermediate compounds adopt amphoteric behaviour. If E is a relatively 
large and electropositive, e.g. Na, the E-0-H 
arrangement is likely to be 
ionic, EtOH-, so that the hydrated hydroxide ion is produced when the 
compound dissolves in water. If E is relatively small, electronegative and 
in a high oxidation state, e.g. as the chlorine(VI1) atom in 03Cl-O-H, 
the E-0 bond is likely to be the stronger bond, thus favouring heterolysis 
to give the ions EO-(aq) and H+(aq). In Al(OH)3, which is an 
intermediate case with a central element in the + 3  oxidation state, 
both heterolytic processes can occur: 

Acids and Bases; Forms of Ions in Aqueous Solution; Ion Hydrolysis & Compound Solubility 
55 
30H-(aq) + Al’+(aq) e AI(OH),(s) + H30+(aq) + AlO;(aq) 
(3.25) 
Basic dissociation is encouraged by the presence of an acidic solution 
(i.e. pH < 7) and, conversely, acidic dissociation is encouraged by the 
presence of a basic solution (i.e. pH > 7). 
Sodium hydroxide dissolves in water to give OH-(aq) ions, the 
strongest base which can exist in an aqueous system. Chloric(VI1) acid 
(perchloric acid) dissociates practically completely in dilute solution to 
give H30+(aq) ions, which represent the strongest acid which can exist in 
an aqueous system. The amphoteric behaviour of aluminium is noticed in 
a series of hydrated salts containing the A13+ ion and in compounds such 
as NaA102, which contains the aluminate(II1) ion, A102-. 
3.5 Forms of Ions in Aqueous Solution; Hydrolysis 
The molecular form of any ion in aqueous solution depends largely upon 
the size and charge (oxidation state) of the central atom. These two 
properties influence the extent of any interaction with the solvent water 
molecules. A large singly charged ion is likely to be simply hydrated. In 
the case of a transition metal ion, M“+, there are commonly six water 
molecules of hydration actually bonded to the metal ion by coordinate 
(dative) bonds. This set of water molecules constitutes the primary 
hydration shell. Such ions are surrounded by more loosely hydrogen- 
bonded molecules of water that form the secondary hydration shell. The 
interaction of gaseous ions with water to give their hydrated versions 
causes the liberation of enthalpy as the enthalpy of hydration, AhydH*, 
which is negative, and represents a major contribution to their 
thermodynamic stability. 
Forms of ions other than the simply hydrated ones may be understood 
in terms of the increasing interaction between the central ion and its 
hydration sphere as its oxidation state increases and its size decreases. 
This interaction is a chemical change known as 
. The first stage 
of hydrolysis may be written as: 
E(H20)”+(aq) e EOH(“-”+(aq) + H+(aq) 
(3.26) 
implying that an element-oxygen bond is formed with the release of a 
proton into the solution. As the value of n (the oxidation state of E) 
increases, the next stage of hydrolysis would be expected to occur: 
E( H2O)OH‘”-”+ (aq) e E( 
aq) + H + (aq) 
(3.27) 
There is then the possibility that water could be eliminated from the two 
OH- groups: 
E(OH),’”-’’+(aq) + EO‘”-2’+ (aq) + H20(1) 
(3.28) 

56 
Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
Further hydrolyses involving more pairs of water molecules would yield 
the 0x0 ions EO("-4't, EO'"-6)+ and EO("-')+. 
Another possibility is that a water molecule could be eliminated 
between two hydrolysed ions to give a dimeric product: 
2EOH("-1)+(aq) 
EOE2('1-1)+ 
(aq) + H20(1) 
(3.29) 
Further hydrolysis of the dimeric product could yield ions such as 
O ~ E O E O , ~ ( ~ - ~ ) +  
. In some cases, further condensations could occur to 
give polymeric ions. 
Examples of these forms of ions are to be found in the chemistry of the 
transition elements and the main group elements that can exist in higher 
oxidation states. As may be inferred from equations (3.26) and (3.27), 
alkaline conditions encourage hydrolysis, so that the form an ion takes 
depends on the pH of the solution. Highly acid conditions tend to depress 
the tendency of an ion to undergo hydrolysis. Table 3.7 contains some 
examples of ions of different form, the form depending upon the 
oxidation state of the central element, vanadium.

In acidic solution the + 2 and + 3 oxidation states are simple hydrated 
ions, the + 4 and + 5 states being oxocations. In alkaline solution the + 2 
and + 3  states form neutral insoluble oxides (the lattice energies of the 
oxides giving even more stability than any soluble form in these cases), 
and the + 4 and + 5 states exist as oxyanions (dimeric in the + 4 case). 
Simple cations such as [Fe(H20)6]3t undergo a certain amount of 
primary hydrolysis, depending upon the pH of the solution. The ion is 
in the hexaaqua form only at pH values lower than 2.0. Above that value 
the hydroxopentaaquairon(II1) ion, [Fe(H20)50H]2 
+ , is predominant. 
Further increase in the pH of the solution causes more hydrolysis, until a 
complex solid material sometimes described erroneously as iron(II1) 
hydroxide is precipitated. The solid does not have the formula Fe(OH)3, 
but contains iron(II1) oxohydroxide (FeOOH) and iron(II1) oxide in 
various states of hydration, Fe203.xH20. 
With some ions the extent of polymer formation is high, even in acidic 
solution, e.g. vanadium(\/-) can exist as a polyvanadate ion, V100286-.

The above ideas are not limited to species with central metal ions. They 
apply to the higher oxidation states of non-metallic elements. Many simple 
anions do exist with primary hydration spheres in which the positive ends 
of dipoles are attracted to the central negative charge. Table 3.8 gives 
examples of ions that may be thought about in terms of the hydrolysis of 
“parent” hypothetical hydrated ions. 
The hydrolysis products from the hypothetical Si4+ ion are the many 
and varied polymeric silicate ions which exist as chains, double chains, 
and sheets, culminating in the insoluble neutral three-dimensional arrays 
with the formula SOz.

Solubilities of Ionic Compounds in Water 
The various ways in which solubility data are presented are discussed in 
Section 1.1. This section consists of a description of the factors governing 
the solubility of inorganic compounds in water. The discussion is restricted 
mainly to the Group 1 halides with some concluding generalizations.

The results given in the text and the worked problem indicate that the 
solubilities of the sodium halides vary froin the low value for the fluoride 
to the much higher values of tlie other halides. 
This variation is associated with the Gibbs energies of solution, A401G*, 
of the compounds. These, and the values of the enthalpies of solution, 
AsOIH*, and the entropy changes of solution, A,,,S*, when the compounds 
dissolve in water, are given in Table 3.9.

The values given in Table 3.9 refer to the production of aqueous 
solutions in which the inoli~r concentration of the ions is 1 inol drn-.', and 
do not bear a quantitative relationship to the solubilities of the salts. 
However, the thermodynamic paranieters give a good insight as to 
whether the salts should be very soluble or otherwise. The positive value 
of A&*for 
the solution of NaF indicates that the salt is unlikely to be 
very soluble. Sodium chloride is very soluble, consistent with the negative 
value of A,,,lC*, and Table 3.9 shows that it is the positive entropy change 
that makes the value negative. With NaBr and NaI, both enthalpic and 
entropic fiictors coinbine to make the A,,,,G'* values negative. and both 
salts are even inore soluble than NaCI.

59 
With the above reservations in mind, the solubilities of all the Group 1 
halides may be considered further. The overall Gibbs energy change when 
a salt dissolves in water may be divided into two stages: the initial 
destruction of the crystal lattice to produce gaseous ions, followed by the 
hydration of the ions to form the aqueous solution. This is shown by the 
thermochemical cycle in Figure 3.2. The values of A,,,H*(MX, s) and 
A,,,$*(MX, s) pertain to one mole of salt dissolving to give an aqueous 
solution that has molar concentrations of both hydrated ions of 
1 inol dm-3. The first stage is endothermic to the extent of the lattice 
enthalpy and is accompanied by a considerable increase in entropy as the 
ordered solid is transformed into the chaotic motion of the gas phase.

~~ 
The second stage is the hydration of the gaseous ions, and is 
exothermic because of the attractive forces operating between the ions 
and the polar water molecules. There is an accompanying reduction in 
entropy, as the gas phase ions have their motions constrained to a 
particular volume (1 dm3) and the ions, as they are hydrated, cause 
the restriction of motion of a number of water molecules, leading to a 
further entropy reduction. 
In this treatment the enthalpy changes are considered first, followed by 
the entropy changes, and finally the enthalpy and entropy data are 
combined to give the Gibbs energy changes. 
The negative values of the lattice enthalpies are plotted against the 
cation radii in Figure 3.3. The negative values represent the enthalpy 
changes accompanying the conversion of the solid compounds to their 
gaseous constituent ions (the opposite of lattice formation). 
Figure 3.3 Plots of -A att H"

Group 1 halides 
The trends in Figure 3.3 are best interpreted by using the using the 
theoretical Born-Lande equation for the enthalpy change for lattice 
formation from the constituent gaseous ions:

The Group 1 halides have the NaCl structure (6:6 coordination) except 
for the chloride, bromide and iodide of caesium, which have the CsCl 
structure (8:8 coordination). The plots shown in Figure 3.3 show a 
general decrease in the negative value of AlattH" as the cation radius 
increases, as would be expected from equation (3.31). Also, Figure 3.3 
shows that for any set of values of AlattH* at a particular value of the 
cation radius, the values of AlattH' become less negative as the anion 
radius increases. 

Acids and Bases; Forms of Ions in Aqueous Solution; Ion Hydrolysis & Compound Solubility 
61 
Plots of the enthalpies of hydration of the pairs of ions of the Group 1 
halides against the cation radii are shown in Figure 3.4. 
Figure 3.4 
Plots of Ahyd H" 
against cation radius for the pairs 
of ions of the Group 1 halides 
Figure 3.4 shows that the values of Ahy&* 
become less negative as the 
radius of the cation increases and as the anions increase in radius. Such a 
variation would be expected from the Born equation (2.43), suitably 
modified for cations by the addition of 65 pm (the mean value for the 
Group 1 cations, see Table 2.9) to the ionic radius: 
69800 
r+ + 65 
A p=-- 
hyd 
(3.32) 
The values of ionic radius are in picometres and the resulting enthalpy 
change is given in units of kJ mol-'. For anions the equation becomes: 
This is consistent with the values of Ahy&* 
becoming less negative as the 
anion radius increases, for any of the Group 1 halides. Note that for any 
particular Group 1 cation the sum of the enthalpies of hydration of the 
cation/fluoride combination is considerably more negative than the other 
three values. The cation and anion radii are separate as indicated by 
equations (3.32) and (3.33), and the relatively small fluoride ion has a 
more dominant influence than it does on lattice enthalpies, which are 
dependent on the sum of the cation and anion radii. 
The overall enthalpy changes for the solution of the compounds, 
AsolH* (MX, s), are derived from the equation: 
The results are plotted against the cation radii in Figure 3.5.

Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution

pies of solution, AsolH*, of the 
Group 1 halides against cation

The two sets of data, individually showing relatively smooth variations 
of AlattH* and AhydH* with cation radii, combine to give plots in which 
there are still reasonably regular variations. That for the fluoride 
compounds is distinctly different from the plots of the other three series. 
The reason for this distinction is connected with the small ionic radius of 
the fluoride ion, as indicated above. 
The enthalpy-only data shown in Figure 3.5 indicate that the com- 
pounds LiCl, LiBr and LiI, and the fluorides of K, Rb and Cs, might be 
expected to be very soluble, having very negative values of As01H*. That the 
values of AsolS*are also important is shown by a study of Figure 3.6. For 
ease of comparison of the entropy data with those for the enthalpies of 
solution, the former are presented as values of TA,,IS*. The entropy data, 
plotted against cation radii in Figure 3.6, are obtained from the equation: 
The entropies of solution are almost all positive, the positive values of the 
entropies of lattice vaporization predominating over the negative 
entropies of hydration of the pairs of ions.

63 
The mainly positive entropies of solution shown in Figure 3.6 indicate 
that solubility is favoured by the larger ions. LiF is least fkvoured and CsI 
is most favoured. 
The final stage in the presentation is carried out by using equation 
(3.36): 
The results are given in Table 3.12 for the Gibbs energies of solution of 
the solid Group 1 halides, and are plotted against the cation radii in 
Figure 3.7. 
The very negative values of A,,IG*(MX, s) in Table 3.12 are shown 
in colour. 
Comparison of Figures 3.5 and 3.7 indicates the effects of the AsolS* 
values. The effects of the favourable entropy changes show that only LiF 
is expected to have low solubility.

energies of solution against

halides 
Experimental values of the Gibbs energies of solution of the Group 1 
halides are given in Table 3.13. The entries in colour are those values that 

64 
Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
are more negative than -20 kJ mol-', and indicate that the particular 
compounds would be expected to show considerable solubility, 
Table 3.14 gives the solubilities of the Group 1 halides at 25 "C in 
terms of the molalities of their saturated solutions. Molalities of solutes of 
12.0 and greater are indicated in colour. 
Figure 3.8 is a plot of the solubilities of the Group 1 halides as 
molalities of the compounds in their saturated solutions at 25 "C against 
their cation radii. The general form of the plots is roughly the inverse of 
that of the plots in Figure 3.7, as would be expected from equation (3.30).

65 
The solubilities of the Group 1 halides are fairly consistent with the 
thermodynamic data of Table 3.13. The values of AsolG* that are more 
negative than -20 kJ mol-' are shown in colour, as are the solubilities of 
the very soluble halides. Lithium and sodium fluorides are not very 
soluble and CsI is the least soluble caesium salt and the least soluble 
Group 1 halide. The pattern of solubilities in Table 3.14 is roughly the 
inverse of that of the A,,IG*values of Table 3.13. The very soluble three 
larger halide salts are those with the small lithium cation, and the very 
soluble three larger Group 1 salts are those with the small fluoride anion. 
The solubilities of the Group 1 halides indicate that solubility is 
associated with those halides in which there are large differences in size 
between the cations and anions. When the differences are small, the solu- 
bilities are relatively low. As is shown in Chapter 2, the cations behave 
in general in solution as though they possessed radii that are larger by 
65 pm than their respective ionic radii. Table 3.15 gives the appropriate 
cation-anion radii differences to which 65 pm have been added. 
The values in Table 3.15 shown in colour, corresponding to large 
values of the adjusted cation-anion differences (those outside the range 
+40 pm), are for the compounds that are very soluble in water, and 
should be compared with the solubilities given in Table 3.14. An almost 
identical pattern is observed for the values of the differences between the 
enthalpies of hydration of the cations and anions, given in Table 3.16. 
The entries in colour are outside the range 
100 pm. 

66 
Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
Again the very soluble halides have their enthalpy differences in colour, 
and the pattern of coloured entries mirrors that of the solubilities in 
Table 3.14. A correlation between Aso1H* and the difference [AhydH* 
(X-, g) - AhydH*(M+, g)] was noted by Fajans3 in 1921. A similar 
correlation using Gibbs energy values is more logical and Figure 3.9 
shows a plot of AsolG* for the Group 1 halides against the difference 
[AhydG*(X-, g) - AllydG*(M+, g)]. The two points that are well above 
the trend line are for NaF on the left and LiF on the right of the plot, both 
compounds showing relatively poor solubility. 
Figure 3.9 A plot of Asol G" for 
the Group 1 halides against the 
difference [Ahyd G*(X-: g) 
-AhydG+(M+, g)1 
The trend line shows that there is indeed the correlation suggested 
by Fajans. Large values, positive or negative, of [AhydG*(X-, g) 
-AhydG*(Mi , g)] are associated with considerably negative values of 
AS,1G*(MX, s) and would therefore be expected to be the more soluble. 
It bears out the rule he suggested (for enthalpy changes) that with 
different salts with a common cation (or common anion) the solubility 
will be a minimum when AhydC*(X-, g) = AhydG*(M+, g). This suggests 
that the connection between [AhydG*(X-, g) - AhydG*(Mi, g)] for any of 
the compounds and the extent to which they separate when the crystal 
lattice comes into contact with water is related to the extent to which one 
ion (the smaller one) interacts more strongly with the molecules of water 
than the other (the larger one). Such an imbalance of ion-water 
interactions is energetically more advantageous than the case where 
two equally sized ions compete with the same attractive force for water 
molecules to complete their hydration spheres. In the case of a very 
soluble compound there are very few water molecules per ion and the 
larger ion might not fLilfil its expected quota.

3.6.1 Solubilities of Salts containing Doubly Charged Ions 
In this section the solubilities of NaCl, CaC12, Na2C03 and CaCO’ are 
compared to investigate the effects of having doubly charged ions in a 
compound. The solubilities of the compounds are given in Table 3.17 in 
terms of mass % and molar concentration. Sodium and calcium cations 
are chosen for this comparison because they have almost identical ionic 
radii: Na ‘ 102 pm, Ca2+ 100 pm.

The two chlorides have almost identical solubilities, except that 
the NaCl solution has a molar concentration of ions of 2 x 5.4 = 
10.8 mol dm-’ and that of the CaC12 solution is 3 x 5.0 = 15.0 mol dm-’. 
Sodium carbonate solution (molar ion concentration = 6.03 mol dm-3) is 
less concentrated than that of sodium chloride (molar ion concentration 
= 10.8 mol dm-’). When both cations and anions are doubly charged, as 
in CaC03, the relatively high lattice enthalpy predominates to make the 
compound insoluble. Calcium sulfate is only sparingly soluble, but 
sodium sulfate is soluble. The double charge on the calcium ion favours a 
larger lattice enthalpy compared to the enthalpy of hydration. 
Most minerals contain metals with oxidation states equal to or greater 
than two and coupled with doubly charged anions, e.g. oxide or sulfide, 
are insoluble in water and consequently persist in the Earth’s surface 
layer. Naturally occurring inorganic compounds consisting of metal ions 
in the + 1 or + 2  states and with counter ions such as halides are soluble 
in water, and are continually leached into the oceans (see Table 1.1). In 
arid parts of the world they occur as evaporite deposits, e.g. the salt flats 
near Salt Lake City. Evaporite salts are precipitated from concentrated 
brines (concentrated natural waters) in the reverse order of their 
solubilities under local conditions: CaC03 (limestone), CaS04.2H20

3.6.2 Properties that Favour Solubility of Ionic Compounds

properties of ions that favour solubility. The general “rules” are only 
guidelines, since there are exceptions and given with suitable examples.

Large differences in cation and anion radii, mirrored by large

For other than single charges on either ion, that of the counter ion 
should be single; if both ions have charges greater than one, the 
solubility tends to be low.

Electrode Potentials 
This chapter is devoted to the important relationship between 
(AG) for half-reactions and

the reaction or half-reaction, the potentials always apply to 
. The changes in standard Gibbs energy (AG*) for the same 
processes are given in kJ mol-’ and take into account the 
in 
oxidation states of the reactants, i.e. the actual number of electrons 
transferred in the reaction. 
In any discussion of the thermodynamic stability and 
properties of ions the fundamental equation used is: 
AG”= -RTlnK 
(4.1) 
which relates the value of AG”, the change in standard Gibbs energy, to 
that of the equilibrium constant, K, for any process. It is convenient to 
express the change in standard Gibbs energy, for any reaction, as the 
difference between the two standard reduction potentials for the two 
“half-reactions” which, when added together, produce the overall 
equation. For example, the overall equation: 
may be considered to be the sum of the two half-reactions: 
Cu’+(aq) + 2e- ;i 
Cu(s) (reduction) 
(4.3) 
Zn( s) e Zn2+ (as) + 2e- 
(oxidation) 
(4.4) 
Reaction (4.2) may be carried out by adding metallic zinc to a solution of 
copper sulfate or by using an 
in which the reactants 
are not in contact. One such cell (a modern form of a Daniell cell) is 
shown in Figure 4.1. 
It consists of two beakers in which the two half-reactions can occur, 
one containing copper(I1) sulfate solution and a copper rod as the 
positive electrode, the other containing zinc sulfate solution with a zinc 
rod as the negative electrode. The two solutions are brought into 
electrical contact with a salt bridge - a tube containing an agar gel and 
potassium chloride. 
When the two electrodes are connected via a high-resistance voltmeter 
(so that virtually no current is drawn from the cell), the measured voltage 
(the 
, E*) is + 1.1 V. When a metal wire is used to 
connect the two electrodes, electrons flow from the negative zinc electrode 
to the positive copper electrode. Zn2+ ions are produced in the solution 
and Cu2+ ions are reduced. The reaction would only take place within the 
cell if the reducing agent (Zn metal) were allowed to come into contact 
with the oxidizing agent (Cu2+ ions); the salt bridge prevents this 
occurrence, as the porous pot does in the original Daniell cell.

Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
The standard electrode potential of the reaction is considered to be 
equal to the dzjference between the values of the 
of the two half-reactions, (4.3) and (4.4): 
E* = E*(cu’+/cu> - E*(Zn’+/Zn) 
Zn’+(aq) + 2ep + zn(s) 
(4.6) 
where E*(Cu’+/Cu) is the reduction potential for the half-reaction (4.3) 
and E*(Zn2+/Zn) is the reduction potential for the half-reaction: 
(4.7) 
this being the reverse of equation (4.4). 
value of AG* for the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu is: 
Consider the meaning of equation (4.6) in terms of AGs values. The 
AG*(c~~+/cu) = -~FE*(cu’+/cu) 
(4.8) 
and the value for the reduction of Zn2+ to Zn (the reverse of equation 4.4) 
is: 
AG*(Zn’+/Zn) = -2FEs(Zn2f/Zn) 
(4.9) 
the values of n = 2 being included because both half-reactions are two- 
electron reductions. 
Equation (4.2) may be constructed froin its constituent half-reactions 
(4.3) and (4.7), the appropriate value for its A,G* being the sum of the 
AG” values for the half-reactions as shown: 
Cu2+(aq) + 2e- + CU(S) 
AG* = -2FE*(Cu’+/Cu) 
zn(s> + Zn2+ (as> + 2e- 
Cu’+(aq) + zn(s> e 
CU(S> + Zn’+(aq) 
A,.G* = -2 FE*(CU’+/CU) + ~FE*(z~’+/z~) 
AG* = + ~ F E * ( z ~ ~ + / z ~ )  
Because the E*(Zn2 ‘/Zn) used in the second equation is the reduction 
potential and the half-reaction as written is an oxidation, the sign of the

ArG* is reversed. A,G* for the reduction of Zn2+ to the metal is 
-2FE*(Zn2+/Zn), that for the oxidation of Zn to Zn2 + is opposite in sign: 
+ 2FE"(Zn2+/Zn). The standard potential for the overall reaction (4.2) is 
calculated by using equation (4.5): 
E"(Daniel1 cell) = -ArG*/2F = E"(Cu?'/Cu) - E"(Zn2+/Zn) (4.10) 
which is equal to the dflerencc. between the two standard reduction 
potentials. 
Since neither of the two half-reaction potentials is known absolutely, it 
is necessary to propose an 
, relative to which all half-reaction 
potentials may be quoted. The half-reaction chosen to represent the 
arbitrary zero is the hydrogen electrode' in which the half-reaction is the 
reduction of the aqueous hydrogen ion to gaseous dihydrogen: 
(4.11) 
where the state of the electron is not defined. The standard reduction 
potential for the reaction is taken to be zero: E"(H+/1/2H2) = 0. This 
applies strictly to standard conditions, where the activity of the hydrogen 
ion is unity and the pressure of the hydrogen gas is lo2 kPa at 298.15 K. 
It is conventional to quote reduction potentials for the general half- 
reaction: 
Oxidized form + ize- + Reduced form 
(4.12) 
i.e. the half-reaction written as a reduction process. 
The accepted values of the standard reduction potentials for the 
Cu'+/Cu and Zn'+/Zn couples are +0.34 V and -0.76 V, respectively. 
The standard potential for the Daniel1 cell reaction is thus: 
E"(Daniel1) = +0.34 - (-0.76) = + 1 .I V 
The overall standard potential for the reaction: 
may be calculated from the standard reduction potentials for the 
constituent half-reactions: 
Cu2+(aq) + 2e- + Cu(s) E" = +0.34 V 
(4.14) 
Cr"(aq) + e- s Cr"(aq) 
E" = -0.41 V 
(4.15) 
as: 
E"(4.13) = +0.34 - (-0.41) = +0.75 V 
The sign of the chromium half-reaction potential is reversed because the 
half-reaction itself is reversed to make up the overall equation. 

76 
Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
The overall change in the standard Gibbs energy for reaction (4.13) is 
given by: 
A,G" = -1iFE" = -2F x 0.75 V = -144.7 kJ mol-' 
The negative value indicates that the reaction is thermodynamically 
feasible, as does the positive value for the overall potential. 
It is often necessary to calculate the E"va1ue of a half-reaction from 
two or more values for other half-reactions. In such cases, the 
stoichiometry of the overall reaction is important, and care must be 
taken to include the number of electrons associated with each half- 
reaction. For example, the two half-reactions: 
Cr20:- (as) + 14Hf(aq) + 6e-+ 2Cr3+(aq) + 7H20(1) 
(4.16) 
E" = +1.33 V 
Cr3+(aq) + e- + Cr2+(aq) E" = -0.41 V 
(4.17) 
contribute to the third half-reaction: 
This is obtained by doubling reaction (4.17) before the addition, so that 
Cr'+(aq) is eliminated. The simple addition of the two half-reaction 
potentials gives 1.33-0.41 = +0.92 V, which is not correct for the 
potential of the half-reaction (4.18). Calculation of E" (4.18) via the value 
of ArG" illustrates why the correct answer is not the arithmetic sum of the 
two half-reaction potentials. 
For reaction (4.16): 
E"= +1.33 V and AG"= -6F x 1.33 = -7.98F 
For the reduction: 
2Cr'+(aq) + 2e- + 2Cr2+(aq), E" = -0.41 V 
but: 
AG"= -2F x -0.41 = 0.82F 
because of the doubling. So, for reaction (4.18): 
AG" = -7.98F+ 0.82F = -7.16F 
and: 
E" = -7.16F + (-8F) = +0.895 V 
The final E" value is the sum of the individual E" values appropriately 
weighted by their respective numbers of electrons, the sum then being 
divided by the total number of electrons transferred in the final equation. 
This is because the electrons do not cancel out in such cases.

On the hydrogen scale, the range of values for standard reduction 
potentials varies from about + 3.0 V to -3.0 V for solutions in which the 
activity of the hydrated hydrogen ion is 1. It is also conventional to quote 
values for standard reduction potentials in basic solutions with a unit 
activity of hydrated hydroxide ion, EB". Typical values of EB" range 
between about + 2.0 V to -3.0 V. 
Examples of half-reactions at each extreme of the E" and EB* ranges

The Hydrated Electron and Absolute Values 
of Reduction Potentials 
The hydrated electron, e-(aq), is a well-characterized chemical entity. If 
liquid water is subjected to irradiation by X- or y-ray quanta, electrons 
(photoelectrons) are released from water molecules, which thereby 
acquire a positive charge: 
H20 + hv -+ H20+ + e- 
(4.19) 
The photoelectron retains most of the energy of the incident photon and 
itself produces further ionizations. It produces many more H20' /e- 
pairs in losing its energy. The excess of energy possessed by the electrons 
so produced is used in such further ionizations until the electrons become 
thermalized, i.e. they have translational energies typical of the 
temperature of the bulk medium. Both types of ion become hydrated 
by interaction with the water solvent: 
H20+ + H20(1) ---f H@+(aq) + OH(aq) 
(4.20) 
e- -+ 
e- (aq) 
(4.21) 
That the hydrated electron is a separate chemical entity has been 
demonstrated by the technique of 
. This consists of 
subjecting a sample of pure water to a very short pulse of accelerated 
electrons. The energetic electrons have the same effect upon water as a 
beam of y-ray photons. Shortly after the pulse of electrons has interacted 
with the water, a short flash of radiation (ultraviolet and visible radiation 
from a discharge tube) is passed through the irradiated water sample at an 
angle of 90" to the direction of the pulse to detect the absorption spectra

of any transient species. The spectrum of the hydrated electron consists of 
a broad absorption band with a maximum absorption at a wavelength of 
71 5 nm, in the near-infrared region. The broad band shows considerable 
absorption in the red region of the visible spectrum, so a solution of 
hydrated electrons, if it lasted long enough to be viewed by eye, would be 
blue in colour. 
Measurements of the rate of reaction of the hydrated electron with 
water and the reverse process have given a value for the change in Gibbs 
energy for the equilibrium: 
e- (as) + H20(1) + H(aq) + OH- (aq) 
(4.22) 
of + 35.2 kJ mol-'. The change in Gibbs energy for the dehydration of the 
hydrated hydrogen atom is estimated to be - 19.2 kJ mol- I .  The change in 
Gibbs energy for the dimerization of hydrogen atoms to give dihydrogen 
gas is -203.3 kJ mol-' and that for the reaction of hydrated protons with 
hydrated hydroxide ions to give liquid water is -79.9 kJ mol-'. These 
reactions may be combined in a Hess's law calculation, to give the change 
in Gibbs energy for the reaction of the hydrated electron with the hydrated 
proton to produce gaseous dihydrogen:

The value of ArG* of -267.2 kJ mol-' for the hydrated electron/ 
hydrated proton reaction converts into a reduction potential of 267.2/ 
96.485= +2.77 V on the conventional scale and indicates that the 
hydrated electron is approximately equal to sodium in its reducing power:

The ralues of the changes in standard Gibbs energy, standard enthalpy

of the values depends upon the known values for the standard entropies 
of the participating species given in Table 4.3. 
The values in Table 4.3 for H(g), H+(g) and e-(g) are calculated by 
using the Sackur-Tetrode equation (2.60). Those of H(g) and e-(g) 
contain the term R In 2 (= 5.76 J K-' mol-') to take into account the two 
possible values of the electron spins. The values for the other species are 
taken from the chemical literature.293 
4.2.1 The Gibbs Energy Cycle 
The values for Gibbs energy changes shown in Figure 4.2 are either 
available from the literature or are calculated from the enthalpy and 
entropy changes. The change in standard Gibbs energy for the 
dehydration of the hydrated proton: 
(4.25) 
is calculated from the change in enthalpy (1 I 10 kJ mol- ') and the change 
in entropy: + 108.9 -(-20.9)

The change in standard Gibbs energy for the reaction:

ponding entropy change of $1 14.7 - 108.9 - 20.9 = - 15.1 J K-' mol-': 
AG"(H+(g) + e-(g) -+ H(g)) = -1318.2 + (298.15 x 15.1/1000)

The change in standard Gibbs energy for the reaction:

AG"(H(g) -+ 1/2H2(g)) = -218 + (298.15 x 49.3/1000) 
= -203.2 kJ mol-' 
From the calculated values of the Gibbs energy changes, that for the 
dehydration of the hydrated electron may be estimated as: 
AG*(e-(as) -+ e-(g)) = -267.2 - 1071.3 + 1313.7 + 203.2 
= +178.5 kJ mol-' 
4.2.2 The Enthalpy Cycle 
The change in standard Gibbs energy for the reaction: 
e- (as) + H+(aq) * 1/2H2(g) 
(4.28) 
is -267.2 kJ mol-I, and the change in standard entropy, calculated from 
the values given in Table 4.3, is +73.4 J K-' mol-'. This makes the 
standard enthalpy change for the reaction equal to -267.2 + (298.15 x 
73.4/100) = -245.3 kJ mol-.'. The enthalpy changes for the other stages 
in the cycle of Figure 4.3 are known, and may be combined with the 
enthalpy change for the reaction:

to give a value for the change of enthalpy for the dehydration of the

= +181 kJ mol-' 
4.2.3 The Enthalpy of Hydration of the Electron 
The enthalpy of hydration of the electron is - 18 1 kJ mol-' and corres- 
ponds to that of a relatively large ion. The value for the iodide ion (ionic 
radius = 220 pm) is -289 kJ mol-'. If the simple inverse relationship 
between radii and the enthalpies of hydration of ions [the Born equations 
(2.46)] is used, the radius of the hydrated electron is estimated to be: 220 x 
(- 2891 - 18 1) = 362 pm. This is a large value for an ion of single charge, 
and corresponds to the delocalization of the charge over a considerable 
volume consisting of several water molecules. This is to be expected, since 
the water molecule has no low-lying orbitals to accommodate an extra 
electron. The near-infrared spectrum of the hydrated electron has a 
maximum absorption at 715 nm. The quantum energy equivalent of such 
a wavelength is given by: 
E = [6.022 x 102'(mol-') x 6.626 x 10-34(J s) x 299792458(m sf')] 
f [715 x lO-'(m) x lo'] = 167.3 kJ mol-I. 
The quantum energy is very similar to the enthalpy of dehydration of the 
hydrated electron, and the absorption of the 715 nm radiation by 
the hydrated electron probably causes its dehydration, i.e. its reversion to 
the gaseous state, e-(g).

The Stabilities of Ions in 
Aqueous Solution 
This chapter is not concerned with the thermodynamic stability of ions 
with respect to their formation. Rather, it is concerned with whether or 
not a given ion is capable of existing in aqueous solution without reacting 
with the solvent. Hydrolysis reactions of ions are dealt with in Chapter 3. 
The only reactions discussed in this section are those in which either water 
is oxidized to dioxygen or reduced to dihydrogen. The Nernst equation is 
introduced and used to outline the criteria of ionic stability. The bases of 
construction and interpretation of Latimer and volt-equivalent (Frost) 
diagrams are described.

5.1 
The Limits of Stability of Ions in Aqueous 
Systems 
Although reduction potentials may be estimated for half-reactions, there 
are limits for their values that correspond to both members of a couple 
having stability in an aqueous system with respect to reaction with 
water. For example, the Na+/Na couple has a standard reduction 
potential of -2.71 V, but metallic sodium reduces water to dihydrogen. 
The reduced form of the couple (Na) is not stable in water. The standard 
reduction potential for the Co3+/Co2' couple is + 1.92 V, but a 
solution of Co3+ slowly oxidizes water to dioxygen. In this case the 
oxidized form of the couple is not stable in water. The standard 
reduction potential for the Fe3 +/Fe2' couple is + 0.771 V, and neither 
oxidized form or reduced form react chemically with water. They are 
subject to hydrolysis, but are otherwise both stable in the aqueous 
system. The limits for the stability of both oxidized and reduced forms 
of a couple are pH dependent. 
The limits of stability for water at different pH values may be defined 
by the 
for the values of reduction potentials for the 
hydrogen reference half-reaction: 
and for the reduction of dioxygen to water: 
O,(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e.- + 2H20(1) 
as the pH of the solution changes over the 0-14 pH range. 
The equation: 
AG = AG* + RTln Q 
(5.3) 
represents the change in Gibbs energy for non-standard conditions of a 
system. The quotient, Q, is the product of the activities of the products 
divided by the product of the reactant activities, taking into account the 
stoichiometry of the overall reaction. 
Equation (5.3) may be converted into the Nernst equation by using 
equation (4.5) so that: 
RT 
nF 
E=E*--1nQ 
(5.4) 
The Nernst equation may be applied to the hydrogen standard reference 
half-reaction and gives: 
E(H'/1/2H2) = - 
(5.5) 

The Stabilities of Ions in Aqueous Solution 
89 
considering the activity of dihydrogen to be unity and E" (H+/*/2Hz) = 0. 
In order to obtain an equation which relates E to pH, it is convenient 
to convert equation (5.5) to one in which logarithms to base 10 are 
used: 
At 298.15 K this simplifies to: 
o g 4 $ + )  
E(HS/l/2H2) = -0.0592 x 1 
(5.7) 
The theoretical definition of pH is: 
and substitution into equation (5.7) gives: 
E(H+/'/2H2) = -0.0592 pH 
(5.9) 
The half-reaction expressing the reduction of dioxygen to water in acid 
solution (equation 5.2) has an E" value of + 1.23 V when the activity of 
the hydrogen ion is 1 mol dm-'. The Nernst equation for the dioxygen/ 
water couple is: 
E ( 0 2 / 2 H 2 0 )  = 1.23 - 0.0592 pH 
(5.10) 
This assumes that the activities of dioxygen and water are both unity. 

90 
Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
Note how the “4”s for the numbers of hydrated protons and the 
stateless electrons cancel out. This is not always the case for some half- 
reactions, which therefore have a different 
. The Nernst slope 
is given by the factor -2.3026RT/Fmultiplied by the ratio of the number 
of protons to the number of electrons in the half-reaction. 
Equations (5.8) and (5.10) are plotted in Figure 5.1, with pH values 
varying from 0 to 14. Theoretically, the oxidized form of any couple 
whose E value lies above the oxygen line should be unstable, and should 
oxidize water to dioxygen. Likewise, the reduced form of any couple 
whose E value lies below the hydrogen line should be unstable, and 
should reduce water to dihydrogen.

In practice, it is found that wherever gases are evolved [in particular the 
necessity for initially generated (e.g. 0 or H) atoms to come together to 
form diatomic molecules] there is a kinetic barrier to the process, 
sometimes known as 
. This barrier causes the practical limits 
for the E values to be around 0.4 V lower than the hydrogen line or 0.4 V 
above the oxygen line for water to be reduced or oxidized, respectively. 
The practical limits are shown in Figure 5.1. 
The oxidized and reduced forms of couples with E values anywhere 
between the two practical limits are stable in aqueous systems with respect 
to either the reduction or the oxidation of the solvent. 
Couples with E values outside the practical limits of stability do not 
necessarily cause the destruction of the solvent. Some reactions, although 
they may be thermodynamically feasible, are kinetically very slow. The 
Co3-/Co2' couple has an E" value of + 1.92 V, and Co3 ' should not 
exist in aqueous solution. However, its oxidation of water to oxygen is 
very slow, and solutions containing [ C O ( H ~ O ) ~ ] ~  
+ evolve dioxygen 
slowly. The E" value for the Al"/Al 
couple is - 1.66 V, and indicates 
that aluminium should dissolve in acidic aqueous solutions. A stable 
protective oxide layer on the metal's surface normally retards the 
reaction, a circumstance gratefully acknowledged by aeroplane manu- 
facturers. 
5.2 
Latimer and Volt-equivalent (Frost) Diagrams 
There are two main methods of summarizing the thermodynamic 
stabilities of the oxidation states of elements in aqueous solution, 
known after their inventors. Latimer and Frost diagrams are usually 
restricted to the two extremes of standard hydrogen ion (pH = 0) or 
hydroxide ion (pH = 14) solutions. 
5.2.1 Latimer Diagrams 
Latimer diagrams were invented by W. M. Latimer and consist of lines of 
text of the various oxidation states of an element arranged in descending 
order from left to right, with the appropriate standard reduction 
potentials (in volts) placed between each pair of states. The diagram for 
chromium in acid solution is written as:

For conciseness in the remainder of the chapter, the Latimer diagrams 
are presented with the relevant reduction potentials between the two 
oxidation states of the couple, as shown below, or in tabular form.

The more exact forms of the aqueous cations, with their primary 
hydration shells, are normally omitted from the diagrams. As is the case 
with CrV', which in acid solution exists as the dichromate ion, Cr2072-, 
the forms of any 0x0 anions are indicated by their formulae in the 
diagrams. The diagram for chromium summarizes the following 
important properties: 
Cr2072- is a powerful oxidizing agent, indicated by the high 
positive value of the E"for its reduction to Cr"'. 
Chromium metal should dissolve in dilute [I mol dmP3 H+(aq)] 
acidic solutions to give the + 3 state. Written as oxidation reactions 
(i.e. with the signs of the reduction potentials reversed), the positive 
potentials for the two stages indicate that the reactions would be 
thermodynamically feasible:

Cr(s) + 2Hf(aq) + H2(g) + Cr2+(aq) 
Cr2+(aq) + H+(aq) e l/"H2(g) + Cr"(aq) 
The Cr2+ is unstable in aqueous solution in the presence of dissolved 
dioxygen. Dioxygen (02/2H20; E" = + 1.23 V) has the potential to 
oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+. The + 2 state is a good reducing agent. 
E" = f0.91 V 
E" = +0.41 V 
(iii) 
(iv) The + 3 state, placed between the positive and negative E" values, 
is the most thermodynamically stable state.

The information contained by the diagram is: 
(i) Chromium(V1) is the monomeric tetraoxochromate(V1) ion. In 
alkaline solution, it does not have any oxidant property and is the 
most stable state of the element under such conditions. 
There is no other solution chemistry, as the + 2 and + 3 states exist 
as solid hydroxides that are easily oxidized to the + 6  state. 
(ii) 
Latimer diagrams are available for all the elements except for the 
unreactive lighter members of Group 18, and form an excellent and 
used extensively in Chapters 6, 7 and 8. The diagrams used so far in the 
text consist of one line, but it is sometimes instructive to link oxidation 
potential appropriate to those states. One example is given in Figure 5.2 
for some of the states of iron at pH = 0.

5.2.2 Volt-equivalent Diagrams (Frost Diagrams) 
Equation (4.5) relates the standard reduction potential (volts) to the 
standard Gibbs energy (in J mol-I). This equation can be rearranged: 

The Stabilities of Ions in Aqueous Solution 
95 
AG*/F = -nE" 
(5.11) 
The value of the standard reduction potential is multiplied by n (the 
number of electrons participating in the reduction and the product 
represents, with its sign changed, the 
for the reduction process. Equation (5.11) may be 
expanded to include the Gibbs energies of the oxidized and reduced states 
for a general reduction process: 
of the 
AG"/F = [G" (reduced state) - G"(oxidized state)]/F 
= G"(reduced state)/F - G"(oxidized state)/F = -HE" (5.12) 
Figure 5.3 shows a plot of G"/Fagainst oxidation state for the reduction 
process, M3+/M 
+ , for a couple with a positive E" value ( + 1.1 V). 
The E" value is asserted to be positive, so the accompanying value of 
AG" is negative; the value of G" / F  for the oxidized state of the couple is 
higher by 2 x 1.1 V than that for the reduced state. A volt-equivalent 
consists of a plot of G"/Fvalues against the oxidation state for ions of the 
element under consideration. Ions of less stability are placed higher up the 
G" / F  axis in the volt-equivalent diagram; those with greater stability are 
placed lower down. 
The plot of the volt-equivalent (G" /fl against oxidation state for 
chromium in acid solution is shown in Figure 5.4, with the oxidation state 
decreasing from left to right. The individual steps from left to right are 
reduction processes. In this way, Frost diagrams can be associated easily 
with the corresponding Latimer diagram. The origin of such a graph is 
the volt-equivalent of zero for the zero oxidation state of the element, 
consistent with the Gibbs energy of formation of an element in its 
standard state having the conventional zero value. The point for Cr2+ is 
placed at oxidation state 2, 1.82 V lower down than the metal. This 
is because the volt-equivalent value of the reduction potential of - 0.9 1 V 
is given by -AG" / F =  (2 x -0.91 V) = - 1.82 V or AG" / F =  1.82 V, 
indicating that the neutral element is more stable than Cr2+. 
The point for Cr3+ is placed a further 0.41 V down from - 1.82 V at 
-2.23 V, indicating the extra stability of the Cr'" state. The point for 
Cr20+- is placed 1.33 x 3 = 3.99 V higher than that for the + 3  state, 
indicating the instability of the former state with respect to the latter. The 
factor of three is used because the + 6  to + 3  conversion is a three- 
electron change (n = 3). Caution is required with this placement because 
the form of the CrV' ion contains two chromium atoms, Cr20;'--. This is 
because reduction potentials refer to the Gibbs energy per electron, so it is 
important when potentials are converted to Gibbs energy changes that 
attention is given to the number of moles of the element participating in 
every half-reaction.

Volt-equivalent diagrams convey the same amount of information as 
do Latimer diagrams about the relative stabilities of the oxidation states 
of an element and their oxidation/reduction properties, but do it in a 
graphical manner. Such diagrams are given in subsequent chapters for 
selected elements to illustrate further the differences in potentials between 
successive oxidation states . 
The theory of reduction potentials and their understanding in terms of 
the stages of reduction processes, as described above, are used in the 
discussion of the periodicity of the ions formed by the elements and their 
redox interactions in the subsequent chapters.

The subject of this chapter is the periodicity of the aqueous chemistry of 
the elements of the s-block (Groups 1 and 2) and the p-block (Groups 
11-18) of the Periodic Table. Modified Latimer diagrams summarize the 
chemistry of all the elements, and some volt-equivalent diagrams are 
given to represent the inter-relations between various oxidation states 
of the elements. Explanations of some trends in redox chemistry are 
discussed in detail.

6.1 .l Valency and Oxidation State: Differences 
of Terminology 
The 
of an element is its 
, represented as the 
number of electron-pair bonds in which it can participate by sharing some 
or all of its valency electrons with an equal number from the atoms to 
which it is bonded. This number is equal to or sometimes less than the 
number of 
, i.e. those electrons that are capable of 
entering into covalent bonding. These are the electrons in the 
, i.e. those in the “outer” electronic configuration of the atom. For 
example, the sulfur atom has an outer electronic configuration 3s23p4, 
and could be expected to be six-dent if all the valence electrons took 
part in covalent bonding, as in SF6. In such a case the central atom is 
. Sulfur exerts valencies that are less than the 
maximum, as in the compounds SF4 (four-valent S), SC12 (two-valent S) 
and H2S (two-valent S). 
Ionic compounds have indications of the “valency” of the constituent 
elements in their stoichiometries, e.g. in NaCl both atoms are 
monovalent, but in MgF2 the magnesium is divalent in combining with 
the monovalent fluorine. In such compounds the term “valency” has to be 
used with caution. In NaCl, each ion has a coordination number of six, 
i.e. each ion has six nearest neighbours that might be regarded as being 
ionically bonded to the central ion. In the structure of MgF2 (which has 
the rutile structure of Ti02), each magnesium ion is surrounded by six 
fluoride ions, and each fluoride ion is surrounded by three magnesium 
ions arranged in a trigonal plane. The terms monovalent and divalent, for 
Na and Mg respectively, are used to describe the metals in the compounds 
mentioned, but the 
concept is more accurate and 
understandable. 
There are important differences between the two concepts that should 
be appreciated. Oxidation state is an imaginary charge on an atom that is 
in combination with one of the very electronegative atoms, i.e. F or 0, in 
which their oxidation states are deemed to be - 1 and -2 respectively. For 
example, in MgF2 and MgO the oxidation state of the magnesium is + 2 
(i.e. I1 in the Roman numerals conventionally used to indicate oxidation 
states, as Mg”) and equal to the charge on the Mg2+ ions in those 
compounds. In ionic compounds there are no discrete electron-pair bonds 
so the strict definition of valency, given above, does not apply. 
In essentially covalent compounds the oxidation state concept can be 
useful in their classification. The two main oxides of sulfur are SO2 and 
SO3 and, if the oxidation state of oxygen is taken to be -2 by convention, 

100 
Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
the oxidation states of the sulfur atoms in the oxides are + 4  and +6 
respectively, i.e. they contain S'" (sulfur-4) and Svl (sulfur-6). 
The sulfur atoms in the compounds SF4, SC12 and HZS have valencies of 
4,2 and 2, but, if the formal oxidation states of the fluorine, chlorine and 
hydrogen atoms are taken to be - 1, - 1 and + 1, respectively, the oxidation 
states of the sulfur atoms in those compounds are + 4, + 2 and -2. 
In H2S the hydrogen atom is assigned the oxidation state of + 1 
because hydrogen is less electronegative than sulfur. In a compound such 
as LiH (which is ionic, Li+H-) the hydrogen is in oxidation state -1, 
consistent with H being more electronegative than Li. In the chlorate(VI1) 
ion, C104-, the chlorine atom has an oxidation state of + 7  because 
the four oxygen atoms are considered to be in the -2 state, and a central 
chlorine(VT1) makes the overall charge minus one. The bonding in the ion 

Periodicity of Aqueous Chemistry I: s- and p-Block Chemistry 
101 
is essentially covalent, and the massive amount of energy which would 
have to be used to remove (i.e. ionize) the seven valency electrons of the 
chlorine atom is sufficient to prevent any ionic bonding between the 
chlorine atom and the four oxygen atoms. 
6.1.2 The s- and p-Block Elements other than 
Hydrogen 
Table 6.1 gives the variations of the positive oxidation states of the 
elements of the s- and p-blocks of the Periodic Table. The elements of the 
2nd period, Li-Ne, show the values expected from the strict application of 
the octet rule.

The elements of the subsequent periods follow the rule, but there are 
many exceptions. Some elements form compounds that involve 
(dealt with in Section 6.2.6) in which the valency of 
the central atom is higher than that expected from the octet rule, e.g. 
ClO, has chlorine in its + 7 state, which formally forms one single bond 
to 0- and participates in three double C1=0 bonds, making the formal 
valency equal to seven. Other compounds contain ions that have 
oxidation states two units lower than expected from the octet rule, e.g. 
Sn2', and which exhibit the 
(dealt with in Section 6.2.3). 
In Groups 15-1 7 there are examples of compounds and ions in which 
the oxidation states of the group elements are negative. These are given in 
Table 6.3.

Periodicity of Aqueous Chemistry I: s- and p-Block Chemistry 
103 
Across the elements of Groups I, 2 and 13 to 18 there are major 
changes in the types of ions that are stable in solution and in their redox 
behaviour. There is a change from the electropositive elements of the first 
two groups, which are powerful reducing agents easily oxidized to their 
+ 1 and + 2 states, respectively, to the elements of Group 17 which are 
oxidizing agents, ranging from the powerful oxidizers, F2, C12 and Br2, to 
I?, which is not as powerful. Down any group, the reducing powers of the 
electropositive elements increase in general and the oxidizing power of the 
electronegative elements decrease. The details of these generalizations are 
presented in tables that are modified Latimer-type diagrams and in some 
volt-equivalent diagrams. 
The forms of the aqueous ions of the s- and p-blocks of the Periodic 
Table vary from the positively charged + 1, + 2 and + 3 ions typical of 
the elements of Groups 1, 2 and 13, respectively, e.g. Na', Mg2+ and 
A13+, to the oxoanions typical of the positive oxidation states of the 
elements of Groups 14 to 18, e.g. CO; -, NO,, PO: - , SO: - and ClO,, 
some of which have central atoms that are hypervalent. The stability in 
aqueous solution of positive ions depends largely on the balance between 
the ionization energy expended to attain the positive charge and the 
compensating enthalpy of hydration of the ion. Providing the hydration 
enthalpy outweighs the ionization energy, the positive ion is probably 
stable in aqueous solution. If the two quantities are reversed in 
magnitude, the existence of positive ions is not possible and the 
production of hydrated oxoanions occurs. Such an argument ignores 
the effects of entropy changes, but these are relatively minor. 
The oxoanions may be thought of as resulting from the hydrolysis of 
the positively charged ions, with the formation of double covalent bonds 
to neutral oxygen atoms and single covalent bonds to oxygen atoms 
possessing a formal single negative charge. The production of single and 
double bonds to oxygen atoms coupled with the enthalpy of hydration of 
the oxoanion confer stability on the ion in aqueous solution. As the 
oxidation state of the central atom increases, the electronegativity of the 
atom increases and this makes covalency more likely. In acidic solutions, 
oxoanions in general become less stable as the oxidation state of the 
central ion increases and their oxidizing power increases. Hydrolysis is 
encouraged in alkaline solution, and this stabilizes the oxoanions with 
higher oxidation states of the central ion, which then tend to be less 
powerful oxidants or lose their oxidative capacity altogether.

The Detailed Aqueous Chemistry of the

ions and redox chemistry are described and discussed.

6.2.1 Hydrogen 
The first element, hydrogen, has an Allred-Rochow electronegativity 
coefficient of 2.1, and an electronic configuration Is'. The atom may lose 
the single electron to become a proton, which exists in aqueous solutions 
as the hydroxonium ion, H30'(aq), in which the proton is covalently 
bonded to the oxygen atom of a water molecule. The ion is hydrated, as is 
discussed extensively in Chapter 2. The reduction of the hydrated proton 
by an electron forms the reference standard half-reaction for the scale of 
reduction potentials: 
H +(as) + e- + '/2H2( g) 
(6.1 1 
The values of AG* and AH* for the half-reaction are taken to be zero by 
convention, but the value of AH* in absolute terms is - 426.2 kJ mol - 
as shown in Section 6.2.2, and that of AG* is - 445.7 kJ mol- 
as may 
be derived from the data given in Figure 4.2. 
The hydrated proton is the simplest (in that it is monatomic) and 
strongest acid in the aqueous system. Any compound that is a stronger 
acid decomposes in aqueous solution to give a solution containing 
hydrated protons and counter-anions, e.g. HCl dissociates to give 
hydrated protons and hydrated chloride ions. 
The Group 1 elements, and the Group 2 elements except for the lighter 
members, Be and Mg, form ionic compounds with hydrogen in which the 
hydrogen occurs as the hydride ion, H - . In these cases the hydrogen 
atom has an attached electron that gives the hydride ion, which has the 
helium electronic configuration, 1 s2. The compounds react with water 
because the hydride ion is unstable in its presence: 
Thus, sodium hydride, NaH, reacts with water to give a solution of 
sodium hydroxide. In terms of acid/base theory, the hydride ion is a 
stronger base than OH- and readily accepts a proton from water.

6.2.2 Groups I and 2 Metals 
Apart from hydrogen, which is treated separately, the elements of Groups 
1 and 2 are all metallic in character and form hydrated M+(aq) and 
M2+ (as) hydrated ions, respectively, in aqueous solution. The ions 
formed are those expected from the octet rule, the elements of both Groups 
losing their valency electrons to give the electronic configuration of the 
Group 18 element in the previous period. Table 6.4 gives the standard 
reduction potentials for the metallic elements of Groups 1 and 2 at pH = 0. 
Dilute aqueous solutions of strong acids (e.g. HCI or H2S04) contain 
sufficient concentrations of hydrated protons to oxidize many metals, to 
produce their most stable states in solution. The only thermodynamic 
condition for metal oxidation is that the reduction potential of the metal 
ion produced should be negative. In general, for the metal ion Mn+ 
undergoing reduction to the metal, if the standard reduction potential for 
the half-reaction: 
Mnf(aq) + ne- e 
M(s) 
(6-3) 
is negative, e.g. - x V, the potential for the reverse half-reaction: 
M(s) e M"+(aq) + ne- 
(6.4) 
is positive, +x V. The reference half-reaction has a potential of zero: 
The overall reaction, constructed by adding together the two half- 
reactions so that the electrons cancel out, is: 
This overall reaction has a positive potential, + x V, a negative change in 
Gibbs energy, and therefore is feasible. Whether such reactions occur 
depends upon the absence of an oxide layer that might prevent the 
oxidant reaching the metal surface. 
The very negative reduction potentials of the Groups 1 and 2 elements 
indicate that the reductions of their ions to the elements is very Gibbs- 
energy consuming, and that the reverse processes, where the elements 
provide electrons for reducing purposes, are extremely favoured 
thermodynamically.

Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
All the Groups 1 and 2 metals have reduction potentials with respect to 
their respective Mt(aq) and M2+ (as) ions that are extremely negative. 
They fall into the region below the lower practical boundary of Figure 
5.1, so they are expected to react with neutral liquid water. In its reactions 
with liquid water, lithium is relatively slow compared to the other Group 
1 metals, which react very rapidly (Cs almost explosively) with water. The 
Group 2 elements react at very different rates with water. Beryllium only 
reacts at red heat. Magnesium reacts slowly with cold water to give 
dihydrogen and the insoluble hydroxide, Mg(OH)2. The other members 
of the group react quite vigorously with water, but not as rapidly as the 
heavier Group 1 metals. 
The high reducing capacity of the Group 1 elements is detailed above. 
Those of the heavier Group 2 elements (Ca, Sr, Ba and Ra) are almost as 
high as the Group 1 elements. Although Be and Mg are still powerful 
reducing agents, their less negative potentials arise because of the greater 
energies required to cause their double ionization. This point is dealt with 
in detail later in this section. 
The €"Values of the Group 1 M'/M Reductions 
The accepted values for the standard reduction potentials for the Group 1 
unipositive cations being reduced to the solid metal are given in Table 6.4, 
and some therinocheinical data and the appropriate ionic radii are given 
in Table 6.5.

The E" values imply that all the elements are very powerful reducing 
agents (M+ being difficult to reduce to M) and that lithium and caesium 
are the most powerful, with sodium being relatively the least powerful. 
The reducing powers of the elements K and Rb are intermediate between 
those of Li and Cs and that of Na. The following calculations identify the 
reasons for the very negative values of E". 
The calculations that follow are carried out in terms of entlzalply 
changes, with entropy changes being ignored. This is justified because the 
entropy changes are (a) expected to be fairly similar for the reactions of 

Periodicity of Aqueous Chemistry I: s- and p-Block Chemistry 
107 
the elements of the same periodic group, (b) relatively small compared to 
the enthalpy changes, and (c) somewhat more difficult to estimate. 
The standard enthalpy change for the reduction of M+(aq) to M(s) 
may be estimated from the above data by carrying out a calculation using 
the thermochemical cycle shown in Figure 6.1 for the overall reaction: 
M+(aq) + '/2H2(g) + H + ( 4  + M(s) 
(6.7) 
Figure 6.1 A thermochemical 
cycle for the reduction of 
aqueous M+ ions to the metal M

The enthalpy change of reaction (6.7) is given by the equation: 
The reduction potentials of the Group 1 elements are calculated from 
equation (6.8) by dividing the enthalpy change by -F. The results are 
given in Table 6.6. 
The calculated values for the reduction potentials are very similar to 
those observed, the small differences being attributable to the ignored 
entropy terms. The calculation of reduction enthalpy shows that the value 
is the resultant (a relatively small quantity) of the interaction between two 
numerically large quantities: the ionization energy of the gaseous metal 
atom and the hydration energy of the cation, with the enthalpy of 
atomization making a relatively small contribution. The trends in the 
values of the three quantities are understandable qualitatively in terms of 
(i) the changes in size of the ions (the enthalpy of hydration decreases with 
increasing ionic radius, see the data in Table 6.5); (ii) the electronic 
configuration of the atoms (ionization energy decreases as 2 increases); 
and (iii) the strength of the metallic bonding, which becomes weaker as 
atomic size increases (the effective nuclear charge decreases). The values 
of the enthalpies of hydration of the cations, the ionization energies of the 
atoms, and the enthalpies of atomization of the Group 1 elements are 
plotted against the ionic radii of the elements in Figure 6.2.

It can be seen from Figure 6.2 that the widening gap between the 
ionization energy and negative values of the enthalpy of hydration, which 
would make the Group 1 elements have greater reducing power down the 
group, is offset by the trend in atomization energy. Thus, the latter trend 
in a relatively small quantity serves to maintain the reducing powers of 
the Group 1 elements at about the same level.

In acidic solution In and T1 have + 1 states, consistent with the 

110 
Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
Thallium and lead have higher values of their first ionization energies 
than expected from the trends down their respective groups, because their 
p-orbitals are more compact. The relativistic effect upon the Gp-orbitals 
of the elements from TI to Rn is to reinforce a stabilization of one orbital 
with respect to the other two. Instead of the expected trend, the first 
ionization energies of T1, Pb and Bi ( + 589, + 7 15 and + 703 kJ mol - ') 
do not show a general increase like those of In, Sn and Sb (+ 558, + 709 
and + 834 kJ mol - '); the value for Bi is lower than that of Pb. 
Another notable difference in properties down groups is the " 
", as demonstrated by the chemical behaviour of T1, Pb and Bi. The 
main oxidation states of these elements are + 1, + 2 and + 3, respectively, 
which are lower by two units than those expected from the behaviour of 
the lighter members of each group. There is a smaller, but similar, effect 
in the chemistry of In, Sn and Sb. These effects are partially explained by 
the relativistic effects on the appropriate ionization energies, which make 
the achievement of the higher oxidation states (the participation of the 
pair of s-electrons in chemical bonding) relatively more difficult. 
The + 3 state of T1 is much less stable than the + 1 state. The reduction 
potential for A13+ shows that the metal is a fairly good reducing agent, 
but it does not react with aqueous acids because the surface is normally 
covered with a protective oxide layer, which is impervious to ions in solu- 
tion. In the form of a fine powder the metal is a powerful reducing agent. 
It is used as the reducing agent in the booster rockets of the Space Shuttle, 
in which the oxidizing agent is ammonium chlorate(VI1). 
The heavier metals react with dilute acids to give Ga3 $- , In3 + and TI' , 
respectively. In alkaline solution the only simple ionic form of boron is 
the B(0H)L ion. Ions of the same form, but complicated by further 
hydration and polymerization, are produced when A1 and Ga react with 
sodium hydroxide solution. 
6.2.4 E" Values for the Reduction of Sodium, Magnesium 
and Aluminium Ions to the Metallic State 
Across the s- and p-blocks the reducing powers of the elements decrease. 
This is shown for the elements Na, Mg and Al, appropriate data being 
presented in Table 6.8.

The reduction enthalpies are calculated, as in the above cases, with 
suitable niodification for the varying number of electrons involved. The 
general equation for the calculation of the reduction enthalpies is: 
Reduction enthalpy = -AhydH*(M"+, g) - ZIl-,l(M) - (77 x 6.2) 
- A,H"(M, g) + (426.2 x 11) 
(6.10) 
where n = 1 for Na, 2 for Mg and 3 for Al. 
The calculations are consistent with the observed trends, and it should 
be noticed that a major factor responsible for the lessening reducing 
power of the elements is the increasing total ionization energy, which is 
not offset sufficiently by the relatively smaller increases in hydration 
enthalpy. The total ionization energies and the negative enthalpies of 
hydration needed for the calculation of the reduction potentials of Na, 
Mg and A1 are plotted in Figure 6.3.

It is clear from this example and those of Section 6.2.2 that quite simple 
calculations can identify the major factors that govern the values of E" 
for any couple, and that major trends may be rationalized. 
6.2.5 The Aqueous Chemistry of the Group 14 Elements 
The Group 14 elements show a relatively small amount of ionic chemistry 
because of the virtual impossibility of formation of ions with a charge of 
+4. Carbon dioxide dissolves in alkaline solution to give the hydrogen 
carbonate and carbonate ions, HC03- (as) and C032 - . In acid solutions 
these ions are protonated to give carbonic acid, H2C03, which 
decomposes with the release of carbon dioxide. The first three elements 
are non-metallic, and the metals Sn and Pb are subject to the inert-pair 
effect. The sparse data for the ions of the elements of the group are given 
in Table 6.9.

Only Sn and Pb have any ionic chemistry in acidic solution, and 
both elements show inert-pair behaviour, with Pb2+ as the more stable 
state for that element. Only Sn has properly characterized ionic 
chemistry in alkaline solution, but the + 2  oxides of both Sn and Pb 
are amphoteric, reacting with an excess of sodium hydroxide solution 
to give oxoanions.

A volt-equivalent diagram for the water-soluble nitrogen species in 
acidic solution is shown in Figure 6.4. It shows that the nitrate(V) ion is 
the least stable species, but also indicates the meta-stability of nitrous 
acid, which is unstable with respect to disproportionation into oxidation 
states + 5 and zero: 
Figure 6.4 A volt-equivalent 
diagram for the water-soluble 
states of nitrogen at pH = 0 
The overall standard potential for the equation is the diff2renc.e between 
the potential for the reduction half-reaction (+ 1.45 V) and that for the 
oxidation half-reaction (+ 0.94 V): E”= 1.45 - 0.94 = + 0.51 V, which, 
being positive, means that the reaction is feasible. 
The reduction potential for the nitrate(V)/nitrate(III) couple in acid 
solution of + 0.94 V indicates from the limited data in Table 6.12 that 
nitrate(V) ion in acidic solution is a reasonably good oxidizing agent. 
However, nitric acid as an oxidant usually functions in a different 
manner, with the production of “brown fumes” with a metal (e.g. 
copper) or a metal sulfide (e.g. FeS2). The brown fumes consist of 
N204 (brown gas) and its monomer NO? (colourless gas). Concen- 
trated nitric acid consists of about 70% of the acid in an aqueous 
solution. In such a solution there is some dissociation of the nitric acid 
molecules to give the nitronium ion, NO;, 
which represents the 
primary oxidizing species: 
2HN03 (conc) e NO: (aq) + NO, (aq) + H20(1) 
(6.12) 
Of the ions that have nitrogen in negative oxidation states, the 
ammonium ion is the most stable and the intermediate - 1 and -2 states 
(protonated hydroxylamine and protonated hydrazine, respectively) are 
oxidizing agents and are unstable with respect to disproportionation. 

Periodicity of Aqueous Chemistry I: s- and p-Block Chemistry 
115 
The most stable state of nitrogen in acidic solution is the ammonium 
ion, NHz(aq), which is isoelectronic with CH4 and H30+. It is a 
tetrahedral ion with strong N-H bonds. The mean N-H bond enthalpy 
in NHz(aq) is 506 kJ mol- 
(that of the 0-H bonds in H30+ is 
539 kJ mol- I ) .  The enthalpy of hydration of the ammonium ion 
is - 345 kJ mol- '. This value placed into the Born equation (3.32) 
gives an estimate of the radius of the ammonium ion of 135 pm, a 
value insignificantly different from its thermochemical radius of 136 
pm. The value is comparable to that estimated for the smaller H30+ 
ion (99 pm) from its more negative enthalpy of hydration (-420 kJ 
mol- ', see Section 2.6.1). The 
of the ammonia molecule 
is of interest in a comparison of its properties with those of the water 
molecule. The proton affinity is defined as the standard enthalpy 
change for the reaction: 
(6.13) 
and has a value of - 852 kJ mol ~ '. The corresponding value for the 
water molecule is - 690 kJ mol- 
(see Section 2.6.1) and is consistent 
with the greater basicity of the ammonia molecule. Nitrate(V) loses its 
powers of oxidation in alkaline solution. 
The two positive oxidation states of P ( + 5  and +3) are both more 
stable than their nitrogen equivalents, and phosphoric acid has no 
oxidant properties apart from those given by the hydrated protons 
produced from it in aqueous solution. A dilute solution of phosphoric 
acid will provide a sufficiently high concentration of hydrated protons to 
oxidize any metal to its most stable state, providing the reduction 
potentials for the metal ion/metal couple are negative. 
The corresponding As species in acid solution are less stable than those 
of P due to the effects of the 3d contraction. Further down the group, Sb 
and Bi show more metallic behaviour, with the two positive ions indicated 
in Table 6.11, and Sb shows amphoteric behaviour: the + 3 oxide reacts 
with sodium hydroxide solution. 
Hypervalence in the Phosphate Ion 
The phosphate ion, PO: - , together with many oxoanions in which the 
notional content of the valence shell of the central atom is in excess of 
eight, may be described as exhibiting hypervalence, i.e. the central 
atom is surrounded by more than an octet of electrons in its valence 
shell. Such octets normally occupy the four molecular orbitals (MOs) 
that have contributions from the M S  and np atomic orbitals of the 
central atom, where 12 is the highest value of the principal quantum

number relating to the valency electrons. The tetrahedral phosphate 
ion may be regarded as having localized bonding, as shown in Figure 
6.5, in which there are three single bonds to negatively charged oxygen 
atoms and a double bond to the fourth oxygen atom, although that is 
only one of many possible canonical forms that could contribute to the 
overall structure. 
To explain the existence of a conventional double bond in the 
phosphate ion requires five electrons to be supplied by the central 
phosphorus atom, which may enter into MO formation with suitable 
orbitals from the ligand oxygen atoms. To arrange this requires the use of 
one of the 3d orbitals of the phosphorus atom. This cannot occur in 
compounds of elements of the second period, where hypervalence is not 
observed. The availability of accessible d-orbitals has, in the past, been 
used as the justification of hypervalence in compounds of the subsequent 
periods. An alternative method of representing the structure of the 
PO:- 
ion is shown in Figure 6.6. 
In this canonical form the phosphorus atom has a positive charge 
and is isoelectronic with the silicon atom. It may then form four single 
covalent bonds to the four single-negatively charged oxygen atoms. In 
this form, the phosphorus atom is not showing hypervalency. 
A MO approach to the problem indicates that although d-orbital 
participation is not required to explain the bonding in a tetrahedral 
oxoanion, some participation ensures its extra stability. Figure 6.7 is a 
simplified MO diagram for a tetrahedral oxoanion making use of the 
3s and 3p orbitals of the central atom, X, and the group orbitals 
constructed from the 2p atomic orbitals of the four ligand oxygen 
atoms.

117 
The four pairs of 2s electrons on the oxygen atoms are omitted from 
the diagram for simplicity. Four 2p orbitals of the oxygen atoms may be 
directed towards the central X atom and form the group orbitals labelled 
as al + t2 (a), which are a-type orbitals. These may interact with the 
orbitals of the central atom that have the same symmetry, i.e. the 3s (al) 
and 3p (t2) atomic orbitals, to give the bonding lal and It2 MOs and the 
2al and 3t2 anti-bonding MOs. The oxoanions (X = Si, P, S or Cl) 
possess 24 electrons that need to occupy the MOs. Two electrons occupy 
the lal bonding orbital and six electrons occupy the 1 t2 bonding orbitals. 
The eight electrons give a bond order of one to each of the supposed X-0 
bonds. The other sixteen electrons are accommodated in the non-bonding 
sets of MOs labelled as e + Itl + 2t2. 
The 3d orbitals of atom X transform as e + t2 in tetrahedral 
symmetry, and although they are higher in energy than the 3p orbitals 
they can and do participate in the MO scheme. The two 3d orbitals that 
transform as the e representation of the tetrahedral group (z2 and 
x2 -y2) interact with the otherwise non-bonding le set of oxygen 
orbitals to make le bonding, and the anti-bonding combination is 
labelled 2e. The other three 3d orbitals of atom X transform as t2, and 
have the effect of stabilizing the It2 level. This increases its bonding 
effect. The 2t2 level is also slightly stabilized. The 3t2 anti-bonding orbital 
becomes more anti-bonding, and the highest energy level is that labelled 
4t2, which is also anti-bonding. If such 3d participation occurs the bond 
orders of the X-0 bonds are increased to a value greater than one and 
the ion as a whole is stabilized as a result. The extent of this stabilization 
depends upon the 3p-3d energy gap. 
Experimental evidence for the occurrence of hypervalence is given by 
studies of the vibrational spectra of ions. Tetrahedral 5-atom ions possess 
3 x 5 - 6 = 9 fundamental vibrational modes. They correspond to the 
four vibrations shown in Figure 6.8. 
The symmetric stretching vibration, labelled v1 (al), in which the four 
bonds expand and contract synchronously is a feature in the Raman 
spectra of the ions. The bending vibrations labelled v2 (e) are doubly 
degenerate and occur at a particular frequency in the Raman spectra of 
the ions. There are two modes of vibration, labelled v3 and v4, which 
belong to the representation t2. Both are triply degenerate and are 
represented in Figure 6.8 as mainly bond stretching (v3) or bending (v4) 
vibrations. Since they both have t2 symmetry, they can interact so that 
both have bond stretching and bending components. The two separate 
frequencies for any tetrahedral ion are found in the Raman and infrared 
spectra of their compounds. Table 6.12 gives the frequencies for the four 
vibration modes for some tetrahedral ions.

trend in the values of v2 are perhaps most indicative of the participation of 
n-bonding, since the bending mode would be most likely to weaken this 
kind of bonding.

is the mean of the two potentials given in Table 6.14, i.e. 1/,(0.695 + 1.763) 
= + 1.229 V. This oxygen reduction potential and its values in the pH 
range 0-14 are very important, as discussed in Chapter 5, as they 
determine which ions with oxidizing powers may exist in aqueous 
solutions and which should oxidize water to dioxygen.

From Group 15 to Group 16, non-metallic behaviour takes over 
completely with no positive ions being stable. The + 6  state of sulfur is 
seen to have very poor oxidizing properties, and it is only in its 
concentrated form, and when hot, that sulfuric(V1) acid is a good 
oxidant. Hot concentrated sulfuric acid oxidizes metallic copper and is 
reduced to sulfur dioxide. The relative stabilities of the Se species with 
positive oxidation states are considerably less than their S or Te 
counterparts, another example of the effect of the 3d contraction. 
The stabilities of the dihydrides of the Group 16 elements decrease 
considerably down the group, from the very stable water to H2Te, which 
is readily oxidized. 
In alkaline solution there is a general stabilization of the positive 
oxidation states of the elements of the group and a destabilization of the 
negative oxidation states.

6.2.8 The Aqueous Chemistry of the Group I 7  Elements 
The standard reduction potentials for the main species formed by the 
Group 17 elements in aqueous solution are given in Tables 6.16 and 6.17, 
for pH values 0 and 14, respectively. Irrespective of the pH of the 
solution, the halogen elements range from the extremely powerful F2 
(which has the potential to oxidize water to dioxygen), through the 
powerful oxidants C12 and Br2, to 12, which is a relatively weak oxidant.

All the positive oxidation states of the Group 17 elements are powerful 
oxidants. In alkaline conditions the positive oxidation states are still 
reasonably powerful oxidants, e.g. HOCl is the basis of some household 
bleach solutions which allegedly kill all known germs. Dilute chloric(VI1) 
acid has a high reduction potential, but reacts very slowly with most 
reducing agents. 
Bromine(VI1) shows even more thermodynamic instability than its Cl 
and I neighbours; this is another example of the alternation of properties 
down the p-block groups brought about by the 3d contraction.

Table 6.18 contains the small amount of data for the + 6 and + 7 states of 
Xe. All four species are extremely unstable and must be handled very 
carefully. It is probable that radon has a similar chemistry, and there is a 
possibility that some higher oxidation states of krypton exist.

6.3 Summary of the s- and p-Block Periodicity 
As is the case in the solid state fluorides and oxides, there is a transition 
from purely metallic behaviour in the Group 1 (apart from H) and Group 2 
elements, which exist in aqueous solutions as positive ions, through 
Groups 13, 14 and 15, where metallic character decreases across the 
periods and increases down each group, to the elements of Groups 16, 17 
and 18 which are almost entirely non-metallic. Possible exceptions are in 
the chemistry of Po and At, which are not well characterized and so are 
omitted from the discussions. The behaviour of the elements changes from 
the basic-oxide-forming elements of the first two groups to the acidic 
behaviour of the positive oxidation states of the later p-block elements. 
Intermediate groups show the transition from non-metallic acidic 
behaviour, through some amphoteric oxidation states, to the basic 
metallic properties of the lower oxidation states of the heavier members 
of those groups.

Periodicity of Aqueous 
Chemistry 11: d-Block 
C hemis try 
This chapter consists of a description of the ions formed in aqueous 
solutions by the transition elements - the d-block elements - and a 
discussion of the variations of their redox properties across the Periodic 
Table from Group 3 to Group 12. There is particular emphasis on the first 
transition series from scandium to zinc in the fourth period, with 
summaries of the solution chemistry of the second (Y to Cd) and third 
(Lu to Hg) series. The d-block ions in solution are those restricted solely 
to aqua complexes of cations, e.g. [Fe(H20)612+, and the various 
oxocations and oxoanions formed, e.g. V02 
+ and MnO,. Oxidation 
states that are not well characterized are omitted or referred to as such. 
7.1 
The Ions Formed by the Transition Elements 
The classical cases of distinction between valency and oxidation state occur 
in the 
of the transition elements. For example, in 
the 
[Cr(NH&3 '](cl p)3 the 
containing 
the chromium ion, [Cr(NH3)$ +, has a chromium atom at its centre which 
124 

Periodicity of Aqueous Chemistry 11: d-Block Chemistry 
125 
engages in six electron-pair bonds with the six ammonia 
molecules, 
the latter supplying two electrons each in the formation of six 
. To that extent the chromium atom is participating in six 
electron-pair bonds and could be called six-valent. Because the chromium 
atom is using none of its valency electrons, to think of it as exerting any 
valency is misleading. What is certain is that the complex ion exists as a 
separate entity, with three chloride ions as counter ions, and therefore has 
an overall charge of + 3. Since the ammonia ligands are neutral molecules, 
the chromium atom may be thought of as losing three of its valency 
electrons to give the + 3  oxidation state, written in the form Cr"'. The 
original electronic configuration of the chromium atom's valency shell is 
4s'3d5, which in its + 3 state would become 3d3. The complex ion is fully 
described as the hexaamminechromium(II1) ion. Table 7.1 summarizes 
the oxidation states of the transition elements that are stable in aqueous 
solution in the absence of any ligand other than the water molecule.

In aqueous solutions, in which the most probable ligand is the water 
molecule, most of the lower oxidation states (i.e. + 2, + 3 and some of the 
$4 states) of transition metal ions are best regarded as hexaaqua 
complex ions, e.g. [Fe"( H2O)6J2 
+ . In these ions the six coordinated water 
molecules are those that constitute the first hydration sphere, and it is 
normally accepted that such ions would have a secondary hydration 
sphere of water molecules that would be electrostatically attracted to the 
positive central ion. The following discussion includes only the aqua 
cations that do not, at ~ € 3 - 0 ,  undergo hydrolysis. For example, the 
iron(II1) ion is considered quite correctly as [Fe(H20)6]3+, but at pH 
values higher than 1.8 the ion participates in several hydrolysis reactions, 
which lead to the formation of polymers and the eventual precipitation of 
the iron(1II) as an insoluble compound as the pH value increases, e.g.: 
[Fe(H20)s]3i e [Fe(H20)50H]2' + H' 
[ FE: (H20) 5 OH] 2-t + [ Fe ( H20) (OH)

Examples of aqua cations containing transition elements are given in 
Table 7.2. The ions in Table 7.2 are those that are thermodynamically 
stable in acidic aqueous solutions except for Co3 + , which oxidizes water 
slowly. In alkaline solutions they are precipitated as hydroxides, oxides or 
hydrated oxides.

The higher oxidation states of the transition elements may be considered 
to be hydrolysis products of hypothetical more highly charged cations in 
which the central metal ion is sufficiently electronegative to be able to 
participate in covalent bonding. For example, the hypothetical Mn7 ' 
ion 
interacts with water to give a n  oxoanion, the manganate(VI1) ion:

Examples of oxidation states of the transition elements that exist in 
aqueous solutions as oxocations or oxoariions are given in Table 7.3. 
Oxoanions tend to predominate over oxocations as the oxidation state of 
the central metal ion increases.

Intermediate oxidation states of some transition metal oxides are 
insoluble in water because their lattice enthalpies are sufficiently large to 
cause the solution of the compounds in water to give ions to be 
endothermic. Examples are V203, Moo2, W02, Mn02 and Re02. 
The transition from positive ions with low oxidation states, via 
insoluble oxides with intermediate oxidation states. to oxoanions with 
high oxidation states, is caused by the competition between ionization 
energies, lattice enthalpies and enthalpies of hydration, similar to the 
discussion of the variations of ionic forms ofthe p-block elements given in 
Section 6.1. Further discussion occurs in Section 7.5.3.

Enthalpies of Hydration of Some Transition 
Element Cations 
The basis of the estimations of the absolute enthalpies of hydration of the 
main group ions is dealt with extensively in Chapter 2. In this section, the 
same principles are applied to the estimation of the enthalpies of 
hydration of the monatomic cations of the transition elements, i.e. those 
of the ions M"+. The standard enthalpies of formation of the aqueous 
ions are known from experimental measurements and their values, 
combined with the appropriate number of moles of dihydrogen 
oxidations to hydrated protons, gives the conventional values for the 
enthalpies of hydration of the ions concerned. Table 7.4 contains the 
Gibbs energies of formation and the enthalpies of formation of some ions 
formed by the first-row transition elements, and includes those formed by 
Ag, Cd, Hg and Ga.

Inclusion of the absolute value of the standard enthalpy of hydration 
of the proton, AhyaH*(H+, g) = - 11 10 kJ mol - (derived in Chapter 
2), gives the absolute values for the enthalpies of hydration of the 
transition metal ions. The estimated values are given in Table 7.5. 

Periodicity of Aqueous Chemistry II: d-Block Chemistry 
129 
The values of absolute enthalpies of hydration given in Table 7.5 for 
the + 2 ions from V to Zn are those estimated in the same manner as that 
for Fe2+ in Worked Problem 7.3. The accepted values for the ionic radii 
of the + 2 ions in Table 7.5 are given in Table 7.6, which also includes the 
value for the Ca2+ ion for purposes of comparison. 
By the same method as that used in Chapter 2, the Born equation (2.43) 
may be used to calculate the effective radii of the ions from Cr2+ to Zn'+ 
and the resulting radii are found to be, on average, 62 & 2 pm larger than the 
ionic radii of those ions, which is an apparent enlargement of about 82%. 
The same methods are used to estimate the enthalpies of hydration of 
the + 3 ions of Table 7.5. The appropriate ionic radii of the ions are given 
in Table 7.7. The radius of the Ca3 
+ ion (3d'') is included, as the ion comes 
at the end of the series in which the 3d orbitals are increasingly occupied.

enlargement of about 120%. The apparent enlargements of the + 2 and 
+ 3  ions could also be due to a reduction in their apparent charges, or 
both effects of size and charge could be operating, indicating some 
delocalization of the charge on the metal ion to include at least the 
primary hydration sphere. 
7.3 Variations in the Enthalpies of Hydration of the 
+ 2  and +3 Ions of the Transition Elements 
Across the sequence of elements, Sc to Zn, there is a general reduction in 
atomic and ionic sizes as the increasing nuclear charge becomes more 
effective. Applied to hydration enthalpies, this factor implies that they 
would be expected to become more negative as the ionic size decreases 
across the series. Superimposed on this trend are electronic effects that 
may be understood by a consideration of the effects of an octahedral 
arrangement of six water molecules around a charged metal centre. 
The variations in ionic radii of the transition elements of the 4th period 
serve to exemplify the arguments needed to rationalize similar variations 
in the other transition series. Figure 7.3 includes a plot of the radii of the 
2 +  ions of those transition elements of the 4th period that form them. 
The plot includes the radius of the Ca2+ ion, which represents the 
beginning of the series but has no 3d electrons, as also has the Zn2+ and 
Ga3+ ions (both 3d") at the end of the series. The radii are those 
of octahedrally coordinated ions as they are found in crystalline 
compounds, the counter-ions (i.e. the ions of opposite charge) being 
situated at the vertices of an octahedron, as shown in Figure 7.4. 
There is a general downward trend in the radii going across the period, 
but the dips at V'+, Ni2+, V3' 
and Co"', 
and the general shape of 
the plot, may be explained in terms of which d orbitals are occupied in 
each case. 
The molecular orbital theory of the coordinate bond makes use of the 
five nd, the single (n + 1)s and the three (rz +- 1)p orbitals of the central ion 
of a complex ion, where n is the value of the principal quantum number, 
equal to 3 for the first series of transition elements. Assuming that 
the coordinate bonding between the central ion and the six water ligands 
is a-type, only the 3dZ2 and 3d,2-,.2 set of d orbitals (e,) and the 4s (alg) 
and 4p (tlu) orbitals are of the correct symmetry to overlap with the 
ligand group orbitals, which transform as alg + eg $- tI,. The 3d,,, 3d,, 
and 3dY, set of d orbitals (t2J remain as non-bonding, since they do not 
have the correct symmetry to overlap effectively with any of the ligand 
group orbitals. These interactions are shown in the molecular orbital 
diagram of Figure 7.5.

occupy the non-bonding 3d,y, 3d,= and 3d,,= set (1 t2&, and possibly the 
anti-bonding orbitals that arise from the overlap of the 3d,2 and 3d,2-.,2 
set (e,) with the eg ligand group orbitals and labelled as 2eg. 
The energy gap between the 2e, orbitals and the Itzg orbitals is given 
the value Aoct for octahedral complexes. A diagram showing the value of 
Aoct is given in Figure 7.7.

The energies of any d configuration, dn, may be referred to the 
particular average energy of the available orbitals when they are all singly 
occupied. Thus, the configuration (1 t2g)3(2eg)2 has an energy given by:

So each electron could be considered to have the energy E( 1 t2,) + 2/5Aoct. 
The position of this average energy, equivalent to the orbitals being 
surrounded by a spherical field rather than an octahedral one, is shown in 
Figure 7.7. The extra stabilization or destabilization that is associated 
with any particular d-electron configuration may be calculated from the 
occupancies of the 1 t2g and 2e, orbitals. The stabilization energy is called

electrons are given in Table 7.8 and plotted in Figure 7.8.

Because the lt’, orbitals are the next lowest in energy after the filled 
bonding orbitals, they are occupied by the first three available electrons. 
The three unpaired electrons occupy the triply degenerate level with 
parallel spins, as expected from 
. There is a choice for the 
fourth electron. It may pair up with one of the electrons in the 1 tZg level, 
or remain unpaired and enter the higher energy 2e, set of orbitals. The 
factor that decides the frzte of the fourth electron is the magnitude of Aoct 
compared to the energy of repulsion that it would suffer if it were to pair 
up in the 1 t’g level. A large value of Aoct favours electron pairing in the 
it?, level; a small value allows the occupation of the upper 2e, level. The 
value of A,,, depends largely on the nature of the ligand and the oxidation 
state of the central metal ion. Water is an intermediate ligand in its effect 
on the molecular orbital energies, and in all the aqua complexes of the 
+ 2  transition metal ions of the first series the maximum number of 
unpaired electrons in the 1 t?, and 2e, levels occurs. For the + 3 oxidation 
states of the first series, the aqua complexes are of maximum spin up to 
and including Fe’ ’, 
but with Co’ ’ the value ofAcIct is sufficiently greater 
than the pairing energy of repulsion to force electron pairing in the 1 t2g 
level so that the six d electrons all pair up in the 1 t7, level. Cases where the 
magnitude of Aoct is too small to force electroils to pair up in the t2g level 
are called 
. Where the opposite is the case, the 
configurations are called 
The ligand field effects upon ionic radii can be understood in terms of 
the different shielding characteristics of the 2e, and lt2!: electrons. In the 
series of M” 
ions from Ca’ + to V2 ’ 
, electrons are progressively added 
to the 1 t7, orbitals, which lie along the bisectors of the coordinate axes. 
These electrons are not very effective at shielding the ligands from the 
effect of the increasing nuclear charge, and so the radii become 
progressively smaller. In the high-spin cases of Cr2 
+ and Mn2+, the 
additional electrons are added to the 2e, orbitals which, because they are 
mainly directed along the coordinate axes, are better at shielding the 
ligands from the nuclear charge than are electrons in the 1 tz,4 orbitals. The 
radius trend is reversed in the two ions, and then continues in the general 
downwards trend in the high-spin Fe2 ’ , lt2,”2e,’, case where the added 
electron occupies the lt2g level. The high-spin Co’ ’ and Ni’ 
+ ions show 
a decrease in radius as electrons are added to the lt2, orbitals. The 
remaining ions of the series (Cu’ ‘ 
arid Z n  +) show an increasing radius 
trend as the additional electrons are added to the poorer shielding 2e, 
orbitals. The ligand field effects on the radii of the MZ 
+ ions explains the 
trends observed in their hydration enthalpies.

Figure 7.10 shows plots of their enthalpies of hydration against their 3d 
electronic configurations. The two graphs show similar variations 
superimposed on a general decreasing trend. The Sc3+ ion is a do case 
and acts as the reference point for the discussion. A similar curve would 
be expected for the + 3  ions from Co3+ to Ga”, 
but for the 
inconvenient experimental fact that no intermediate ions exist. 
The bonding molecular orbitals are occupied by the six pairs of 
electrons from the six ligand water molecules, so the d electrons of the 
ions occupy the non-bonding lt2g and anti-bonding 2e, orbitals as 
appropriate. The magnitude of Aocc is sufficiently small compared to the 
electron-pair repulsion energy to make the configurations of the ions 
from Ti3+ to Fe3+ high spin. For Co3+, the six d electrons doubly 
occupy the three lt2g non-bonding orbitals, because the gap between 
them and the anti-bonding 2e, orbitals is large enough to enforce electron 
pairing. The electronic occupancies of the 1 t2g and 2e, orbitals are given 
in Table 7.1 1 for the ions under discussion.

Across the series, electrons are progressively added to the non-bonding 
t2g orbitals, and there is a consequent increase in the negative values of the 
enthalpies of hydration of the + 3 ions as far as Cr3+ as the nuclear 
charges become more effective. In Mn3 +, one electron enters the 2e, level, 
and the consequent weakening of the bonding offsets the increasing 
nuclear charge to make the enthalpy of hydration of the ion less negative 
than that of the Cr3 
+ ion. This trend is repeated with Fe3 
+ , with its (2e,)' 
configuration. In the Co3+ ion, all six d electrons occupy the non- 
bonding lt2g orbitals, leading to stronger metal-water bonding and a 
considerable increase in the negative value of the enthalpy of hydration 
of the ion.

across the First Series of Transition Elements 
In this section the redox properties of the 10 elements of the first

described and discussed separately.

The plots of the experimental and calculated values of E*(M2+/M) 
shown in Figure 7.1 1 indicate that they agree very well and that this 
means that the main factors influencing the values have been identified.

values of E"(M2+IM) for the first-

Plots of the 
The + 2/0 reduction potentials have enthalpic contributions from the 
terms in the equation: 
E*(M'+/M) = - [ - A ~ ~ ~ ~ H * ( M ~ + )  
- r2 -1, - A,H*(M) 
(7.13) 
where the + 420 kJ niol - ' term corresponds to the enthalpy of oxidation 
of half of one mole of dihydrogen to give one mole of hydrated protons, 
and the factor of two relates to the two-electron reduction process. 
This treatment indicates that the magnitude of the reduction potential 
is governed by the values of two relatively large terms, ( - AhrdH*(M2+) 
+ 840) and ( I I  + 12), and the smaller term A,H"(M). The interplay 
between the three terms decides the value for the E*(M'+/M) potential. 
Greater negative values of Ai,ydH*(MZ 
+ ), associated with smaller crystal 
radii of the + 2 ions, contribute to a more negative value of E*(M'+/M). 
Greater sums of the first and second ionization energies have an opposing 
effect and contribute to a less negative value of E*(M2+/M). The less 
important A,H*(M) term contributes in a manner similar to the 
ionization energy sum; the greater its value, the less negative the 
reduction potential becomes. The more negative the value of E*(M2+/ 
M), the more difficult it is to reduce the + 2  ion to the metal; the less 
negative the value, the easier it is to reduce the + 2  ion to the metal. 
Figure 7.12 shows plots of the atomization energies of the first-row 
transition metals and that of calcium, the sums of their first two 
ionization energies, and the negative values of their + 2  enthalpies of

The general increase in the ionization energy sum is dominant in 
deciding the trend towards less negative values of the +2/0 reduction 
potentials. Superimposed on the trend are the particularly low values of 
atomization enthalpy for Ca, Mn and Zn. The more positive values of the 
standard reduction potentials are favoured by: (i) a less negative value for 
the enthalpy of hydration of the + 2 ion, (ii) a high value for the sum of 
the first two ionization energies of the metal, and (iii) a high value of the 
enthalpy of atomization of the metal. 
Equation (7.13) may be rearranged to read as: 
E*(M'+/M) = -[-AhyaH*(M2+) + 8401 + [I2 + I1 + A,H"(M)] + 2F 
(7.14) 
The terms [ - AhydH*(M2+) + 8401 tend tomake thevalue ofE*(M2+/M) 
negative and the terms [II + I2 + AaH*(M)] have the opposite effect. 
The values of the two composite terms are plotted in Figure 7.13 for the 
elements from Ca-Zn.

Apart from the copper case, the two terms interact to make the value of 
E*(M2+/M) negative, the term [ - AhYJ€*(M2+) + 8401 having a value 
that is greater than that of the term [Il + I2 + A,H"(M)]. In the copper 
case the values of the two terms are reversed, making E*(Cu'+/Cu) 
positive. 

Periodicity of Aqueous Chemistry II: d-Block Chemistry 
141 
The unique behaviour of Cu in the first transition series, having a 
positive E"(M2+/M) value, accounts for its inability to liberate H2 from 
dilute acids (i.e. those with a molar concentration of 1 mol dm - '). Only 
oxidizing acids (concentrated nitric and hot concentrated sulfuric) react 
with Cu, the acids being reduced. The reason for this behaviour is the high 
energy needed to transform Cu(s) to Cu'+(g), which is not exceeded by 
the hydration enthalpy of the ion. 
The data in Table 7.13 show that there is a considerable variation in the 
values of the enthalpies of atomization of the elements. These are a 
measure of the metallic bond energy, which depends upon the number of 
valence electrons and their distribution in the valence bands of molecular 
orbitals (as discussed in TCT no. 9, Atomic Structure and Periodicity2). 
Low values contribute to a more negative value for the corresponding 
reduction potential. The values of the enthalpies of atomization are, 
numerically, the least important in the calculation of the reduction 
potential. There is a general trend towards less negative values for the 
reduction potentials along the series, with a dip at Mn. This corresponds 
to the particularly low value of the enthalpy of atomization of Mn and its 
low second ionization energy. The less negative enthalpy of hydration 
offsets these effects somewhat, but not sufficiently to avoid the observed 
and calculated dips in the reduction potential values of Mn. The stability, 
due to maximization of the exchange energies between electrons of 
like-spin, of the half-filled d sub-shell in Mn2+ and the completely filled 
d" configuration in Zn", 
are related to their E" values, whereas E" 
for Ni is related to the highest negative Ahy&*, 
corresponding to its 
smaller radius. 
7.4.3 Reactions of the First-row Transition Elements with 
Dilute Acid 
Across the sequence from V to Co there is a general trend in the values of 
the M3+/M reduction potentials, given in Table 7.13, from the negative 
value of - 0.84 V for V to the positive value of 0.45 V for Co. This has the 
implication that dissolving the metals in dilute acid will produce their $3 
states, except for Co, since the value of E*(Co3' /Co) is positive. 
Oxidation of Co by H+ would stop at the +2 state. The production of the 
+3 states, although thermodynamically viable for the metals from V to 
Fe, does not necessarily occur. The mechanism of solution of metals in 
acidic solutions has not been studied to any great extent, but it is probable 
that the reactions occur in one-electron stages. The interaction of the 
aqueous protons and the metal surface may be considered to be a transfer 
of electrons to the protons to produce hydrogen atoms, which would then 
dimerize to give dihydrogen. The oxidized metal atoms could be released 

142 
Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
into the bulk of the solution with charges consistent with the ion's 
stability in aqueous conditions, or possibly could be released in a singly 
ionized state to give a transient M +(as) species: 
M(s) + H+(aq) + M+(aq) + H(aq) 
(7.15) 
2H(aq) + H2(d 
(7.16) 
Of the transition elements, only silver has a water-stable singly charged 
cation, Ag+(aq). Copper does have a stable + 1 ion in solid compounds, 
but this disproportionates in aqueous solution: 
~ u + ( a q )  
+ CU(S> + Cu'+(aq) 
(7.17) 
to give the metal and the water-stable + 2  state. Mercury has a water- 
stable + 1 state, but this has the formula Hgz2+ and consists of two 
mercury(1) atoms bonded together covalently. 
The copper disproportionation reaction suggests that M +(as) ions of 
the transition elements might undergo the same fate: 
2M+(aq) -+ M(s) + M2+(aq) 
(7.18) 
The direct production of higher charged cations from a metal surface is a 
possibility, but it is more likely that the + 1 ions are first released and 
subsequently disproportionate to give the water-stable + 2 ions. Any 
further oxidation by aqueous protons would then occur, if thermo- 
dynamically feasible, in the bulk solution: 
(7.19) 
A Latimer diagram for the + 2  and +3 states of iron is shown in the 
margin. Although the slightly negative value for the +3/0 potential 
implies that metallic iron should be oxidized to the + 3 state by aqueous 
protons, such a reaction does not occur. Pure iron wire dissolves readily 
in dilute sulfuric acid in the absence of dioxygen to give a solution of 
Fe'+(aq). The reaction is slow at room temperature and, like most 
chemical reactions, goes faster with gentle heating. Only if dioxygen is 
present is there any further oxidation of the iron. This example shows the 
necessity of understanding mechanisms of reactions in addition to their 
thermodynamics in order to understand their chemistry. The initial 
product of the reaction between metallic iron and aqueous protons is 
probably Fe+, which then disproportionates to give Fe and Fe2+. The 
aqueous proton cannot bring about further oxidation to Fe3+, and a 
fairly strong oxidizing agent is necessary, one with a reduction potential 
greater than +0.77 V. 
The reactions of the Sc-Zn metals with dilute acid solutions, together 
with some comments about the preparation of the + 2 and + 3 states, are 
summarized in Table 7.15.

Transit ion Elements 
Not all the first-row transition elements have the same pairs of stable 
oxidation states. The elements from V to Co are chosen for this example 
because they all have + 2 and + 3 states for which reliable experimental 
data are available. The data and the calculated E" values are shown in 
Table 7.16. The reduction enthalpies are calculated by using the equation: 
Reduction enthalpy = -Ahydff*(M3+) - 13(M) + AhydH"(M2+) + 420 
(7.20) 
The calculated value for the reduction potential is obtained by dividing 
the reduction enthalpy by -F.

The trends in the terms AhydH*(M3+), 13(M) and Ahy&*(M2+) are 
shown in Figure 7.14. They may be understood from a consideration of 
the changes in electronic configurations.

AhydW(M3+), G(M) and 
AhydH*(M2+) for the elements V, 
Cr, Mn, Fe and Co 
Across the sequence of elements, V to Co, there is a general reduction 
in atomic and ionic sizes as the increasing nuclear charge becomes more 
effective. Applied to hydration enthalpies, this factor implies that they 
would be expected to become more negative as the ionic size decreases 
across the series. Superiniposed on this trend are electronic effects that 
may be understood by a consideration of Figure 7.5. The water ligands 
supply all the bonding electrons, and the electrons of the metal ions are 
then accommodated in first the 3d,-,., 3d,, and 3d,., (1 t2%) non-bonding 
orbitals, which are occupied singly in accordance with Hund's rules. Any 
extra electrons occupy the 3d,2 and 3dY2-,2 anti-bonding orbitals (2e,), 
because in aqua complexes of the + 2  ions the difference in energy 
between the anti-bonding orbitals and the non-bonding orbitals is small. 
The occupation of the anti-bonding 2e, orbitals affects some of the M2+ 
ions, i.e. Cr'+ (2e,)' and Mn2+, Fe2+ and Co2+ [all with (2e,)'] are 
destabilized to some extent, the anti-bonding electrons causing the metal- 
oxygen (of the water ligands) bonding to be weakened, with consequent 
increase in size. 
The same consideration applies to the M3+ ions Mn3+ (2e,)' and 
Fe3+ (2e,)', 
which have less negative hydration enthalpies as a 
consequence. The higher stability (more negative hydration enthalpy) 
of the Co3 ion arises because the six d6 electrons occupy the three non- 
bonding 1 t2g orbitals, because the gap between them and the anti-bonding 
2e, orbitals is large enough to enforce electron-pairing. There is, in 
consequence, stronger metal-water bonding in the aquated Co3 
+ ion. 
The trends in the third ionization energies are understandable as a general 
increase across the series, but with the values for iron and cobalt being 
lower than expected because the electron removal occurs from a doubly 
occupied orbital, whereas those from vanadium, chromium and man- 
ganese occurs from singly occupied orbitals. Plots of the experimental 
and calculated values of E*(M3 +/M2+) for the first-row transition 
elements are shown in Figure 7.15.

The trends in the calculated values are similar to those in the observed 
data. In the calculations, the omission of the entropy terms has caused 
some large differences between the observed and calculated values for the 
M"/M2+ 
potentials. 
It is clear from the examples in this section and those of Section 7.4.2 
that quite simple calculations can identify the major factors that govern 
the values of E" for any couple of monatomic states, and that major 
trends may be rationalized. 
7.5 
General Redox Chemistry of the d-Block 
Elements 
Using a variety of Latimer and volt-equivalent diagrams, this section 
consists of a general survey of the redox chemistry of the elements of the 
d-block of the Periodic Table. The diagrams in the margins for each 
group of elements give their Group number at the top, their atomic 
numbers as a left-hand superscript to the element symbol, their Allred- 
Rochow electronegativity coefficients as a right-hand subscript, and their 
outer electronic configurations as free atoms beneath the element symbol. 
Although there is no space to develop a detailed discussion of the 
solubilities of compounds of the transition elements, the general 
insolubility of their + 2 and + 3 hydroxides is important. The rationale 
underlying their insolubility can be summarized: (i) the hydroxide ion is 
relatively small (1 52 pm ionic radius) and the ions of the + 2 and + 3 
transition metals assume a similar size if their radii are increased by 60-80 
pm, and (ii) the enthalpy of hydration of the hydroxide ion (-519 kJ 
mol - ') is sufficiently negative to represent a reasonable degree of competi- 
tion with the metal ions for the available water molecules, thus preventing 
the metal ions from becoming fully hydrated. Such effects combine to 
allow the lattice enthalpies of the hydroxides to become dominant. 

146 
Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
By contrast, the chlorides of the metal ions are soluble because the 
chloride ion (1 8 1 pm ionic radius) is considerably larger than the hydro- 
xide ion, and its enthalpy of hydration ( - 359 kJ mol- ') is less negative 
than that of OH-. This allows the metal cations to exert more nearly 
their full effect on the solvent molecules, thus overcoming the lattice 
enthalpy terms, and this leads to their general solubility as chlorides. 
The insolubility of the hydroxides of the lower oxidation states of the 
transition elements is the reason for the general lack of aqueous chemistry 
in alkaline solutions. The higher oxidation states of the elements take part 
in covalency to produce oxoanions and persist even in alkaline 
conditions, and allow their solubility.

Group 3 of the Periodic Table consists of the elements scandium, yttrium 
and either lanthanum or lutetium, depending upon the preferred 
arrangement of the Table. Group 3 elements have the outer electronic 
configuration ns2np1, and invariably their solution chemistry is that of the 
+ 3  state. In this text, treatment of both La and Lu is carried out in 
Chapter 8, which deals with the f-block elements. Lanthanum and 
lutetium represent the first and last members of the lanthanide series. 
The elements of the Group, including La and Lu, are powerful 
reducing agents, and their + 3/0 standard reduction potentials in 1 mol 
dm-3 acid solution are summarized by the Latimer diagrams shown in 
the margin. 
The elements have no basic solution chemistry; their + 3 oxidation 
states have the form of hydroxides or oxides in alkaline conditions.

and + 5 states existing as oxocations, V 0 2 +  and V02+ respectively. The 
+ 5  state has a quite large reduction potential with respect to the most 
stable + 3 state, indicating its oxidizing power. If a solution of V 0 2 +  is 
mixed with one containing V2 $- , the + 5 state oxidizes the + 2 state to the 
most stable state in acid solution, + 3, and is itself reduced to that state: 
VO;(aq) + 2V2+(aq) + 4H+(aq) + 3V3+(aq) + 2H20(1) 
(7.21) 
This type of reaction, the opposite of disproportionation, is called 
. In such reactions, two oxidation states of the same 
element undergo reduction and oxidation to produce an intermediate 
state with greater thermodynamic stability than either of the reactants. 
The maximum stability for vanadium as the V3 + ion in acidic solution 
can be understood in terms of the maximization of the enthalpy of 
hydration for the + 3  ion, above which hydrolysis alters the form and 
stability of the higher states. The + 4 and + 5 states are considerably 
electronegative compared to the lower oxidation states, and are able to 
engage in covalent bonding to ligand oxide ions to form V=O bonds. 

148 
Inorganic Chemistry in Aqueous Solution 
There is some loss of overall stability, which gives the two higher states 
their oxidizing properties. 
In alkaline solution the + 5 state has the form V043-, which has greater 
oxidant properties than at pH = 0. It is easily reduced to the most stable 
V"' oxide, the driving force being the large lattice energy of the solid 
oxide. The high lattice energy of the solid oxide is a better contribution to 
the exothermicity of the reduction process in alkaline solution than is the 
enthalpy of hydration energy of the V3+ ion in acidic solution. The + 4 
state has the formula HV205-, a dimeric hydrolysis product of the acidic 
version, V02+. The pH = 14 volt-equivalent plot shown in Figure 7.16 
has the same form as the plot at pH = 0. The lower oxidation states are 
more stabilized by their lattice energies being greater than the hydration 
enthalpies of the ions that are soluble in acid solution. The higher states 
undergo hydrolysis and make use of covalency, but their stabilities 
decrease as the oxidation state increases. At all pH values the highest 
oxidation state is that corresponding to the participation of all five 
valency electrons of the metal.

A volt-equivalent diagram for the oxidation states of Cr is shown in 
Figure 5.4 for a pH value of 0. It shows the same general form as the 
diagram for vanadium in Figure 7.16, except that the highest oxidation 
state is +6. The more stable states are the cations with low oxidation 
states, and as the oxidation state increases the ionic forms become less 
and less stable as oxocations. The most stable state of chromium is the 
+ 3 state, Cr3 +, in acidic solution. The highest oxidation state, + 6, is a 
powerful oxidizing agent. The + 2 state has the potential to reduce water 
to dihydrogen, but the reaction is very slow and solutions of Cr2+ may be 
prepared by the reduction of the + 3 state with zinc amalgam, which are

reasonably stable in the absence of dioxygen. The + 4 and + 5 states 
are unstable and undergo disproportionation to the more stable + 3 and 
+ 6 states. 
A vertical Latimer diagram for pH = 14 is shown in the margin. 
In alkaline solution the + 6  state loses its oxidizing properties. 
Chromium(V1) in alkaline solution appears as the monomeric Cr02- 
ion, which is much smaller than the Cr2072- ion, but without a change in 
the overall charge. The enthalpy of hydration of the Cr(V1) species 
produced is more than doubled, and this is the main determining factor 
causing the loss of oxidizing capacity of the + 6  state in alkaline 
solution. The lattice energy of the insoluble Cr(II1) hydroxide is not so

The aqueous chemistry of molybdenum and tungsten is complicated by

The [(H20)4M~2(H20)4]4-t 
ion possesses a quadruple bond between 
the two +2 state atoms; its structure is shown in Figure 7.17. 
Molybdenum in its +2 state has a 4d4 electronic configuration, with 
the eight electrons of the atoms engaging in quadruple bond formation 
with a-type overlaps of the two d,? orbitals along the Mo-Mo axis, and 
the two sets of d,, and d,, orbitals overlapping in the xz and yz planes, 
respectively, in a n; manner. That arrangement leaves the two sets of d,,, 
and d,y?-J.2 orbitals that are perpendicular to the Mo-Mo axis, and which 
transform as 6 orbitals in the linear ion-molecule. One of the sets is used 
to make the fourth Mo-Mo bond and the other set, together with the 
vacant 5s, 5p, and 5p, orbitals of both atoms, are used to accept electron 
pairs from the two sets of four water molecules that contribute to the 
hydrated ion by coordinate bonding.

the oxygen atom bridges two Mo atoms. Three oxygen atoms bridge the 
three pairs of adjacent Mo atoms, and the fourth oxygen atom caps the 
Mo3 triangle on the side opposite to the three Mo-O-Mo bridges and is 
bonded to all three metal atoms. There are three water molecules attached 
to each of the Mo atoms to complete the structure. 
The +5 state ion [ M O ~ O ~ ( ~ - O ) ~ ( H ~ O ) ~ ' J ~ +

The redox chemistry of manganese is dealt with vol t-equivalent diagrams

follows. A volt-equivalent diagram for the oxidation states of Mn is

shown in Figure 7.21 for pH values of 0 and 14. The values of the 
potentials are given in a vertical Latimer diagram in the margin. 
The most stable state of manganese is Mn’+ in acidic solution, and the 
highest oxidation state, MnOL, is an oxidizing agent; it is easily reduced 
to the +2 state. Unlike the V and Cr cases, the most stable $2 state of 
Mn occurs because of the maximization of exchange energy in its d5 
configuration. 
Figure 7.21 Volt-equivalent 
diagrams for the oxidation states 
of manganese at pH = 0 and 14 
The + 3 ion is unstable in acid solution with respect to disproportiona- 
tion to give the $7 and +2 states. The reaction seems not to include the 
+4 state as an intermediate, since that state is not water soluble (MnO?). 
The $6 and $5 states are unstable in aqueous acid solutions, and 
disproportionate into the soluble $7 state and solid MnO?. 
In alkaline solution the only important state is the +7 oxoanion, 
Mn04, which has the same form as in acid solution and retains its 
powerful oxidizing properties. There are different reduction products at 
the two pH values. In acidic solution, Mn04 is a powerful oxidant and 
is reduced to Mn’+ without going through the intermediate stage of 
producing the insoluble Mn02. In alkaline solution the end product of the 
reduction of Mn04- is the insoluble MnO’. The + 5  ion Mn04” 
disproportionates, but the + 6  state MnO2- is more stable in alkaline 
than it is in acid solution. 
Technetium is a synthetic element, unknown in Nature. Its most useful 
isotope is produced by neutron bombardment of the ’8Mo stable isotope 
in the form of the Moo4’ ion to give the Tc0,- ion via a “neutron-in, 
beta minus particle-out” process [”Mo(r?,P )C)9*11T~]. 
The technetium isotope produced is the metastable 99mTc, which is in a 
nuclear excited state. The eventual fall to the ground state has a half-life 
of 6 hours, and is accompanied by the emission of a gamma-ray photon. 
The gamma-ray photons have energies sufficiently low not to harm

human tissue, but high enough to allow the isotope to be used medicinally 
for diagnostic purposes when injected into the body. The 99Tc ground 
state is a soft p - emitter so does not threaten the well being of the 
patients. 
The aqueous chemistry of Re is that of the + 7 state ion Re04-, which 
does not have the oxidizing power possessed by the MnVr' equivalent ion.

The chemistry of iron in aqueous solution is dominated by the + 2 and 
+ 3 states, which are well characterized. The + 3 state in acid solution is a 
good oxidizing agent; the + 2 state is the most stable. The [Fe(H20)$ 
+ 
complex ion is a violet colour in the solid chlorate(VI1) salt, but in 
solution it undergoes hydrolysis to give the familiar orange-red colour. 
The first stage of the hydrolysis may be written as: 
[Fe(H20)6]3+ + [Fe(H20)50H]2t + H+ 
(7.23) 
for which the pK value at 25 "C is 2.74. In the pH range 1-1.8, 
more hydrolysis occurs and products include the p-0x0 dimer, 
[(H20)5FeOFe(H20)5]4f, produced by the elimination of water between 
two [Fe(H20)s0H]2+ ions. At pH values above 1.8 the hydrated 
+ 3  oxide is precipitated. Transient species containing FeIV and FeV 
have been reported, but there is no aqueous chemistry of note. 
In alkaline conditions the + 2 and + 3 states are found in solids, the 
+ 3 existing as the hydrated oxide, Fe203.xH20. If x = 1, the formula 
simplifies to FeO(0H) and if x = 3 it becomes Fe(OH)3. The substance 
dissolves in concentrated NaOH solution to give the FeOzp ion. Fe"' in 
concentrated KOH solution may be oxidized to the + 6  state using 
OC1-. The blue salt K2Fe04 can be prepared in such a manner; it 
contains the Fe02- ion and in alkaline solution is a moderate oxidizing 
agent. 
A volt-equivalent diagram for the oxidation states of Ru is shown in

Thermodynamically, the elementary state is the most stable oxidation 
state of ruthenium; the higher oxidation states are all at higher Gibbs 
energy values. Previous examples of volt-equivalent diagrams for V, Cr 
and Mn, for example, have shown a common trend with the lower 
oxidation states being more stable than the elements. Only when the 
oxidation state increases beyond the + 2/+ 3 region does the stability of 
the higher oxidation states decrease. Ruthenium is sometimes classified 
together with osmium from Group 8, rhodium and iridium from Group 9, 
and palladium and platinum from Group 10 as the 
. They 
exist together naturally as metals or as sulfide minerals. All six metals are 
extremely resistant towards oxidation, and severe conditions must be 
used to cause their solution. Ruthenium can be obtained in aqueous 
solution after treatment with a fused mixture of sodium hydroxide and 
either sodium peroxide or potassium chlorate(V).

The reduction enthalpies are calculated by using the equation: 
Reduction enthalpy = -AhydH"(M+, g) - I I  (M) - A,H"(M, g) + 420 
(7.24) 
Dividing the reduction enthalpy by F and then changing the sign of the 
result gives the calculated reduction potential. 
The higher enthalpy of atomization and higher first ionization energy 
contribute to the high value of the reduction potential of the gold couple. 
The calculated values are not very different from the observed values, 
indicating that ignoring the entropy terms is not a large source of error. 
The 
of gold, i.e. its high resistance to acids, is represented by the 
large positive reduction potential of the + 1 state. The gold potential 
indicates that the + 1 oxidation state would oxidize water and therefore 
would not be stable in aqueous solution. It is also unstable with respect to 
disproportionation into the metal and the + 3 oxide.

The Zn"/Zn

stages of the reaction occurring in the Daniell cell are shown in Figure 
7.23. The two aqueous ions are shown at the same level, as would be 
expected if there were no junction potentials connected to the operation 
of the salt bridge. The overall enthalpy change of - 219 kJ mol- 
equates to a standard reduction potential of ( - 219/ - F) = + 1.13 V. 
The difference of 0.03 V between the calculated enthalpy-only value and 
the experimental E" value of 1.1 V is because of the small overall 
entropy change of - 20.9 J K ~

of - 6.2 kJ mol- I and to a contribution of - 0.03 V to the value of E" 
for the overall process.

Zinc and cadmium dissolve in dilute acid to give their + 2  ions, but 
mercury does not dissolve, as indicated by the two positive reduction 
potentials. Mercury forms the diatomic Hg22 ion, in which the Hg-Hg 
bond length is 251 pm, consistent with it being a single CJ bond formed 
from the overlap of the two 6s atomic orbitals. The reason for the 
relatively greater stability of the 6s electrons of Hg is relativistic 
stabilization which causes the first two ionization energies (1010 and 
18 I0 kJ mol - I )  to be considerably greater than those of Zn (908 and 1730 
kJ mol- ') and Cd (866 and 1630 kJ mol- I). 
In alkaline solution, only Zn forms an ion, Zn02* , with a reduction

produced by the removal of the 6s2 pair of electrons plus either the single

The very negative Ln3'/Ln 
potentials are consistent with the 
electropositive nature of the lanthanide elements; their Allred-Rochow 
electronegativity coefficients are all 1.1 except for europium, which has a 
value of 1.0. The lighter elements of Group 3, Sc and Y, both have 
electronegativity coefficients of 1.3. The nearest p-block element to the 
lanthanides in these properties is magnesium; E*(Mg'+/Mg) = -2.37 V, 
and its electronegativity coefficient is 1.2. 
Only cerium has a higher state that is stable in solution, Ce4+, 
corresponding to the removal of all four valence electrons. The + 4  state 
is a powerful oxidant, with a reduction potential to the + 3 state that is very 
dependent upon the acid in which it is dissolved (e.g. in sulfuric acid the 
reduction potential is + 1.44 V, in nitric(V) acid + 1.61 V, and in 
chloric(VI1) acid + 1.70 V, indicating some ion pair formation in the first 
two examples). Praseodymium and terbium have + 4 oxides, but these dis- 
solve in acidic solution to give the corresponding + 3 states and dioxygen. 
Of the three lanthanides that form characterized + 2 states, only Eu2+ 
is reasonably stable in acidic solution. The + 2 states of Sm and Yb have 
+3/+2 potentials, which imply that they should reduce water to 
dihydrogen.

Going along the lanthanide elements in order of their atomic numbers, 
the values of the +3/0 reduction potentials show a very weak trend 
towards lower negative values, with a slight discontinuity at Eu. As with 
other elements treated, it may be shown that the values of the reduction 
potentials are governed by the interactions of the enthalpies of 
atomization of the elements and their first three successive ionization 
energies compensated by the enthalpies of hydration of their + 3  ions. 
These interactions and the associated entropy changes produce the 
observed trend. The discontinuity at Eu is due to the advantage of 
attaining the 4f7 configuration in the element. The three-electron 
reduction of the next lanthanide ion, Gd3+, to its zero oxidation state 
is achieved by the reappearance of the 5d' configuration halfway along 
the series, and this does not carry the same exchange energy advantage as 
the change in the reduction of Er3+. 
The enthalpies of hydration of the lanthanides are given in Table 8.4 
and show a regular increasing negative value with decreasing ionic 
radius.

La3+ to Lu3+, the decrease being known as the 
The contraction occurs as the result of 4f electrons not offering efficient 
shielding of the increasing nuclear charge, and because of relativistic 
effects that cause some contraction with increasing nuclear charge.

The calculated and experimental values for the standard reduction 
potentials agree very well, and the data may be used to isolate the factors 
that produce the very negative values. These are that the sums of the first 
three ionization energies and the enthalpies of atomization are generally 
low and are outbalanced by the considerably negative values of the 
enthalpies of hydration of the Ln3+ ions.

As is the case for La and Lu, there is an argument for placing Lr as the 
first member of the fourth transition series, as it does possess a filled 5f14 
set of orbitals. 
The oxidation states of the actinide elements are given in Table 8.7. 
The + 2, + 3 and + 4 ions are aquated ions with those charges and 
undergo hydrolysis to some extent in other than very acidic solutions. The 
+ 5 states all have the same ionic form as oxocations, An02+. In a similar 
manner the + 6 states all have the ionic form as oxocations, An02+. 
Reduction potential data for the actinide elements, including law- 
rencium, are given in Table 8.8 for the well-characterized oxidation states.

Although some + 2 states of the actinide elements exist, they have little 
stability in aqueous solution and are omitted from Table 8.8. 
There are significant differences in the stable oxidation states in aqueous 
acidic solution compared with the corresponding elements of the 
lanthanide series. The underlying reason is that the 5f electrons of 
the actinide elements are more easily ionized than the 4f electrons of the 
corresponding lanthanides. In particular, there are differences in the first 
half of the series where the actinides form more stable oxidation states 
than do the lanthanides. At around the halfway stage, beyond curium, 
there is much more lanthanide-type behaviour of the later actinides. In 
general, the + 3  state predominates, but it is not the most stable state in 
some cases. The elements that have the + 3 state as their most stable state 
are Ac, Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, Md and Lr. Only four of the 
elements have other states as their most stable: Th, Pa, U and No. 
Thorium has a stable +4 state, consistent with the loss of all its valence 
electrons. Protactinium(V) is the most stable state for that element, again 
corresponding to the loss of all five valence electrons. UIV and No" are the 
most stable states of U and No. The + 5 and + 6 states of Pa, U, Np, Pu 
and Am exist in solution as the linear oxocations, An02+ and An02+.

~ 
The potentials of Pa, U, Np, Pu and Am are displayed as volt- 
equivalent diagrams in Figure 8.2. 
The most stable state of uranium can be seen to be the + 4 state from the 
diagram of Figure 8.2. In uranium and subsequent elements, the most 
stable species is determined by the balance between the required 
ionization energy and the form of the ion after hydrolysis has occurred. 
Hydrolysis includes the stabilizing effects of the formation of metal- 
oxygen bonds as the electronegativity of the metal increases, encouraging 
covalent bond formation. In Th and Pa, the ionization energies to produce 
the maximum oxidations states are opposed by the stabilizations that 
occur with hydrolysis. In U, the balance changes somewhat, so the + 4  
state is the most stable. In the cases of Pu and Am the higher oxidation 
states become less and less stable, and in the subsequent (trans-americium) 
elements there is a general reversion to the + 3 state as the most stable, as 
is the case with the lanthanide elements. With nobelium the most stable 
state is the + 2  ion, which corresponds to the removal of the 7s2 pair, 
leaving the No2' ion with the filled shell Sf'' configuration. Lawrencium 
behaves like lutetium, and is placed under that element in Group 3. 
The actinide elements are all radioactive. Their nuclei are unstable 
mainly because of their very high charges; the attractive forces operating 
between the neutrons and protons do not fully balance the interproton 
repulsion. The nuclei consequently emit alpha particles, 'He2+, to gain 
stability, i.e. to lose mass. Examples of radioactive decay are given in 
Table 8.9.

The lanthanide elements are very difficult to separate because of their 
highly similar chemistry, but the earlier actinide elements have sufficiently 
different redox chemistry to allow easy chemical separations. This is 
important in the nuclear power industry, where separations have to be 
made of the elements produced in fuel rods of nuclear power stations as 
fission products, and of the products Np and Pu, which arise from the 
neutron bombardment of the uranium fuel.
