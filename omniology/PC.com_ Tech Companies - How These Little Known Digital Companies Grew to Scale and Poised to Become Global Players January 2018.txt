ASUS debuts ZenFone Max lineup
SUS announces a whole 
new lineup of phones, the 
ZenFone Max Series, 
dedicated to a range specifically 
for 
high-battery-capacity 
smartphones. Prior to this, 
the ZenFone Max were a 
high battery capacity variant 
to its flagship ZenFone lines. 
ASUS is now spinning it out as 
a whole new lineup on its own, in 
response to the popularity and high 
demand of the Max phones.
According 
to 
ASUS, 
previous 
generations of individual ZenFone Max 
models have become the company’s 
best-selling smartphones, with ZenFone 
Max, ZenFone 3 Max, ZenFone 4 Max and 
ZenFone 4 Max Pro achieving a combined 
sales volume of around five million units. 
Kicking off the series is the 
introduction of the first model, the 
ZenFone Max Plus. It is the first ASUS 
smartphone featuring a 5.7-inch HD 
full-view slim-bezel display at no 
size penalty compared to standard 
5.2-inch smartphones. The display has 
an ultrawide 18:9 aspect ratio and 
ultrathin bezels that give ZenFone Max 
Plus an 80% screen-to-body ratio.
The Max series will continue its 
legacy of high-capacity battery, with 
the ZenFone Max Plus sporting a 4,130 
mAh battery that gives up to 26 days 
standby, with a 10% capacity giving 67 
hours of standby and three hours talk time 
on a 15-minute charge. The 4130mAh 
capacity also translates to 26 hours of 3G 
talk time, up to 21 hours of web browsing 
on Wi-Fi or up to 13 hours of video 
playback. Users can also use it as a handy 
power bank to charge other devices.
A
The 
battery 
system 
in 
ZenFone Max Plus features ASUS 
PowerMaster, a suite of intelligent 
power-management technologies that 
work to optimise battery life, ensure 
safety and long-term performance, 
provide 
reverse-charging 
capability 
and more. The device also comes with 
twelve safety checkpoints – including 
temperature monitoring and overvoltage 
protection – combined with automatic 
maintenance settings. This keeps the 
battery running optimally, providing a 
longer average lifespan compared to 
other smartphone batteries.
Although the batteries are its selling 
points, the camera is nothing to sneeze 
at either. Fitted with a 16-megapixel 
PixelMaster f/2.0 aperture lens and 
120° wide-view dual rear cameras with 
phase-detection autofocus (PDAF), the 
camera can focus on the subject in 
just 0.03 seconds even if the subject is 
moving. The secondary 120° wide-angle 
camera has a 200%-wider field of view 
than standard smartphone cameras, 
allowing users to fit more image on their 
screen. The front camera also comes in a 
16-megapixel f/2.0 configuration.
Apple isn’t the only phone with Face 
ID; ZenFone Max Plus is the first ZenFone 
to feature Face Unlock. Users have a 
quick, secure and convenient alternative 
to the rear fingerprint sensor for unlocking 
the phone when wearing gloves or less 
than stellar weather conditions. It is one 
of the few smartphones in its price range 
to have this capability. A fingerprint 
sensor is still available, for users who 
prefer that option.
The ZenFone Max Plus (M1) will 
come with a price tag of RM899.

Right on the get-Go
Android Go is up and running
nnounced 
during 
this 
year's Google I/O, the Android 
Go project is now available. 
Essentially a lightweight version of Android 
Oreo, Android Go is made for entry-level 
devices that carries less than 1GB of RAM. 
It will also be known as Android Oreo (Go 
Edition), which allows device manufacturers 
and developers to allow their devices to 
perform better on much lesser hardware.
With the ability to run on devices 
carrying 1GB of RAM or less, Android 
Go also promises to take up only half 
the internal storage space needed as 
compared to the predecessor, Android 
Nougat. Android Go will run apps 15% 
faster than its previous software as well 
as optimising its 'data saver' feature. 
This helps users on entry-level devices to 
consume less mobile data.
A
As the future will see plenty of 
entry-level devices to come optimised with 
Android Go, Google is also developing its 
apps to work around the lower memory 
capacity of said devices. A completely 
redesigned G Suite will take up less space 
than usual with better performance ratings. 
A few of these apps include YouTube Go, 
Google Maps Go and Gmail Go. Google 
Assistant is also said to be able to run on 
these entry-level devices. Of course, it will 
be known as Google Assistant Go.
Google Play Store will also be 
reimagined to suit the lightweight Android 
Go. It will still carry the full catalogue as 
the normal Google Play Store, but it will 
also recommend apps that are specially 
made for Android Go devices.

fter a highly eventful 2017, 
when an increasing number 
of 
cybersecurity 
incidents 
grabbed headlines in the 
mainstream media, we’re now looking 
ahead to the coming year, which will no 
doubt generate further vibrant discussions 
about the threat landscape.
One refrain is likely to be heard time 
and time again. Cyberthreats and attacks 
are here to stay. Indeed, they will continue to 
expand in scope and volume next year. They 
may evolve and diversify, but a common 
underlying thread will persist – an effective 
cybersecurity posture pivots on knowledge 
of the value of information, coupled with 
insight into and an understanding of the 
threatscape. In a way, when all is said and 
done, plus ça change.
Arming ourselves with facts and 
experience better enables us to control the 
criminal hive mind swarming online. To help 
the reader navigate through the maze of such 
threats, ESET’s thought leaders have zeroed 
in on several areas that top the priority list in 
our exercise in looking forward.
Criminals following the money
With data being the most valuable asset 
(so much so that many have called data ‘the 
new oil’), ransomware is poised to remain 
in great demand among cybercriminals. 
With an eye to slashing the risk that your data 
may end up mangled, we offer take-home 
lessons and observations gleaned from 
the recent evolution of ransomware.
Cautiously, we extrapolate from 
recent trends to the foreseeable future. We 
note the largely indiscriminate nature of 
ransomware campaigns and highlight the 
perils of paying up in exchange for (by no 
means guaranteed) restoration of access 
to data held ransom. Organisations seen 
as willing to pay up in lieu of hardening 
their defenses may run the risk of finding 
themselves a target of choice, yet with no 
certainty of getting their data back.
In a world of smartphones and 
other mobile devices, attackers are more 
focused on denying the use of devices 
themselves than on data stored therein.
The generally perilous state of 
affairs in the Internet of Things (IoT) arena 
presents a host of challenges of its own, 
as the dramatic increase in the number of 
smart devices shows no signs of stopping. 
By contrast, the addressing of security 
concerns is often an afterthought.
Where cyber meets physical
On a different note, we cannot help echoing 
our past – and prescient – sentiment that 
attacks aimed at critical infrastructure are 
set to continue to generate headlines. 
Worryingly, industrial equipment targeted 
by malware known as Industroyer – the 
biggest threat to industrial control systems 
(ICS) since Stuxnet – is in wide use, while 
much equipment in ICS was not designed 
with internet connectivity in mind.
Making 
things 
worse, 
prompt 
upgrades, though important in striving 
for a secure environment, are not always 
a panacea: the drive towards a cheap 
generic architecture for industrial devices 
may introduce additional weaknesses into 
the supply chain, ultimately endangering 
our physical safety.
Democracy in peril?
Electronic voting systems – another 
obvious area where security is playing 
catch-up with technological advancements 
– are grappling with vulnerabilities of 
their own. The preponderance of evidence 
that such systems can be manipulated 
highlights the risks of over-reliance on 
technology for something as significant 
for our societies as elections.
This brings us to the overarching 
question: can a cyberattack rig the 
results of a nation’s election and, thereby, 
subvert democracy? We note the use of 
social media for undermining election 
campaigns by spreading faux news reports 
or launching ad hominem attacks.
Admittedly, such attacks may not 
signal doomsday for democracy, yet 
technological interference poses critical 
challenges in opposition to the need to 
ensure the legitimacy of future elections. 
To this end, all aspects of an electoral

checks and enforces the security of the pre-boot environment that is compliant with 
the UEFI specification. It is designed to monitor the integrity of the firmware and in case 
modification is detected, it notifies the user.
ISF predicts increasing impact of data breaches next year
The number, magnitude and costs of data breaches are all set to continue on their upward 
trajectories in the coming year, according to a forecast by the Information Security Forum (ISF).
This prediction is included in their Global Security Threat Outlook for 2018 and comes 
with a warning that the stakes are now “higher than ever before”.
The increased pervasiveness of data breaches and the higher volume of impacted records are 
expected to result in far higher costs for organizations of all sizes, notes the ISF, an independent 
and not-for-profit association of leading organisations from around the world.
Kids’ smartwatches banned in Germany over spying concerns
German parents are being told to destroy smartwatches they have bought for their children 
after the country’s telecoms regulator put a blanket ban in place to prevent sale of the devices, 
amid growing privacy concerns.
Jochen Homann, president of the Federal Network Agency, told BBC News that 
the so-called smartwatches, typically aimed at children between the ages of five and 12 
years old, are classified as spying devices. The smartwatches, which contain a SIM card 
and contain some telephone functionality, are controlled via apps. According to the Federal 
Network Agency, these apps can be used to make the watches call a desired number unnoticed 
by its wearer – allowing conversations to be eavesdropped upon.
Such behaviour is prohibited in Germany. And the country isn’t the only one concerned 
about the capabilities of children’s wearable technology.
One-third of internet pounded by DoS attacks
“A third of the internet is under attack.”
This blunt and sobering statement comes from a team of researchers who recently explored 
the threat landscape populated by denial-of-service (DoS) attacks worldwide. What they report 
finding is nothing short of, to use their own words, “an eye-opening statistic”.
Looking beneath the surface, the researchers gave us a taste of the breadth and scale 
of the DoS problem, which clearly goes beyond the supremely crippling attacks that grab 
the headlines. The team also noted the increasing onslaughts spurred on by the rise of the 
DoS-as-a-Service phenomenon (aka “stressers” or “booters”), which enables any 
ill-intentioned netizen to orchestrate powerful attacks. The study clearly serves to 
highlight the need for staying ahead of the rising tide of threats emanating from DoS attacks.

Privacy and data bonanza 
The apparent appetite among some 
trusted 
security 
vendors 
for 
the 
monetisation of user data in exchange 
for free antimalware software is set to 
persist into the next year. This will add to 
risks associated with data privacy, which 
is already under fierce attack given the 
endless trail of digital exhaust left behind 
by a plethora of (notably IoT) devices.
Such digital breadcrumbs can be 
collected to tell a story about us and, 
coupled with machine learning and 
artificial intelligence, that story could 
be used as a basis for manipulating our 
thoughts and actions. The data detritus 
should raise concerns of users as to what 
‘free’ products or services actually entail 
and how the data being slurped are used.
While we hope for greater user 
awareness, we suspect that the stockpiles 
of data will expand dramatically next year 
with little awareness on the user’s part. 
We may not be able to put the toothpaste 
back in the tube, but we need to make 
informed decisions and choices lest our 
privacy be eroded further.
Safer for all
This year has seen ESET’s malware analysts 
continue to help law enforcement crack 
down on malicious campaigns and, by 
extension, the criminals spewing them. 
We are confident that 2018 will bring 
further successful investigations as we will 
continue to lend a hand to authorities so that, 
ultimately, the internet can become a safer 
place for everyone – except cybercriminals.
We also believe that the increasing 
general awareness of cyberthreats and 
our preparedness to cooperate in tackling 
any and all manner of felonious wares 
served up by attackers will accrue to our 
shared benefit, particularly as technology 
is now woven through the entire fabric 
of our societies and we face a host of 
internet-borne threats.

We take a look back at some of the billion ringgit tech 
companies of Malaysia, also known as ‘Unicorns”.

COVER STORY
rom its humble beginning as a 
physical distributor of products 
in 
1994, 
KAT 
Technologies 
has evolved into a distribution 
process specialist that offers distribution 
solutions and services, which are both 
efficient and cost-effective.
KAT Technologies prides itself as 
a supply chain, distribution and logistics 
specialist, as well as a pioneering 
company for the distribution of mobile 
prepaid when such services were first 
introduced in Malaysia in 1999.
In fact, it was able to merge 
the latest in applications technology 
and strategic planning with the drive 
of a highly technical professional 
team. The development has led to 
the production of various advanced 
products and solutions. 
One of them is the award-winning 
KATsys, a sophisticated software system 
that led the KAT Group to emerge as the 
best retail and supply chain management 
company in Asia Pacific.
Handling precious stocks early 
on for principles that include Celcom, 
Telekom, Altel, XOX and Philippine 
Telecoms, KAT Technologies then went 
on to win other prepaid players in the 
telecommunications industry. 
“We 
have 
thousands 
of 
stock-keeping units and that was the 
challenge – to ensure every piece of 
inventory is recorded and their sales 
perfectly reconciled at the close of each 
work day,” says Datuk Ir (Dr) Khairol 
Anuar Mohamad Tawi, the founder of 
KAT Technologies Sdn Bhd and executive 
chairman for the KAT Group of Companies.
One of the challenges for traders 
and distributors is the ability to predict 
what kind of stock one should have at any 
location, according to Khairol Anuar.
“If you have the wrong stock 
combination, you are keeping stock for 
nothing or even worse, you don’t have 
the right stock to sell,” he explains. “You 
will just end up with a stock-out or stock 
over situation, both of which are not ideal 
as they reflect that you are not managing 
your financials correctly or efficiently.”
On this note, KATsys is specifically 
designed to track and manage the 
requirements of every depot, an ideal 
option for all clients, distributors and 
traders alike. Having this figured out early 
on, KAT Technologies then went on to offer 
the solution to the fast-moving consumer 
goods (FMCG) space, a market sector with 
growth potential in need of efficient and 
effective distribution solutions.
Complementing its existing KATsys 
solutions is MobiPOS, which serves as a 
platform to revolutionise the management 
of inventories, accounts and receivables 
in the retail industry.
“We 
have 
KATsys 
sitting 
at 
the back-end to monitor how the 
sales are combing the market while 
understanding and tracking the kind of 
stock required,” enthuses Khairol Anuar. 
“Now, we also have a front-end system, 
which in many ways has turned into a 
salesforce automation system.”
Having solidified its position in 
telecommunications, namely the mobile 
prepaid industry, while pursuing other 
industries such as FMCG, KAT Technologies 
is eyeing an international expansion.
Lofty as it may seem, the company 
is already executing its growth plans. 
With the help of MDEC (Malaysia Digital 
Economy Corporation), the company 
is charting its path carefully under the 
Global Acceleration Innovation Network 
(GAIN) programme.
This initiative hopes to catalyse the 
expansion of potential local technology 
SMEs 
to 
become 
global 
players 
through market access; leadership and 
capability development; brand visibility; 
and scale-up capital.

What started out as a small sunset 
business, Merchantrade Asia Sdn Bhd 
is now a leading homegrown Money 
Services 
Business 
(MSB) 
player, 
providing a full spectrum of offerings 
including remittance, money exchange 
and wholesale currency services.
Its established branch network and 
online platforms provide consumers with 
easy access to a secure, reliable and fast 
channel for currency exchange, money 
transfers and payments across borders.
In partnership with international 
wire transfer operators, foreign banks 
and other established payment centres, 
Merchantrade’s 
remittance 
network 
comprises 
234,000 
pay-out 
points 
in 200 territories worldwide.
In 
2016, 
Merchantrade’s 
total 
turnover of outward remittance transaction 
value was slightly above RM5 billion.
Boasting a solid track record in the 
MSB segment with innovative product 
offerings, the company hopes that its 
digital offering, namely eRemit and eForex, 
can enhance its current customers’ MSB 
experience, while garnering interest from 
new customers as well.
Through 
its 
transformative 
business strategy, one that moves away 
from traditional MSB, the company is 
steadfastly contributing to the digital 
space to support the flourishing digital 
platforms across the region. 
Going digital may sound like an easy 
task but it can be a very tough process for 
someone new to the MSB segment.
“Many people come into business and 
think that within six months they can achieve 
what we have now,” shares Merchantrade’s 
managing director, Ramasamy K Veeran. “It 
has taken us years to develop Merchantrade 
to be what it is today.”
It was in 2010 that the idea of 
Merchantrade’s first digital platform 
came about with the company starting to 
develop its online remittance platform. It 
also boasts to be the first MSB company in 
Malaysia focusing on digital remittance.
The eRemit platform was officially 
launched two years later, followed by a 
mobile app in 2016. The app – available 
on both Android and iOS devices – allows 
for cashless and seamless money 
transfers to selected countries at any 
time and any day throughout the year.

This makes it convenient for 
customers, 
including 
expatriates, 
employers, 
parents 
with 
children 
studying overseas, domestic helpers 
and migrant workers, to remit money 
to their loved ones. 
The last five years has been a 
learning curve for Merchantrade as 
the company seeks to learn about its 
customers’ usage patterns, in addition to 
catering to their remittance needs. 
“We 
are 
currently 
exploring 
Artificial Intelligence in our products to 
bring it to a whole new level of customer 
experience,” adds Ramasamy.

Understanding the challenges of its clients 
in adopting technology for the benefit 
of their business, N2N Connect Bhd has 
proven its mettle as a capable technology 
partner in the highly regulated financial 
services industry (FSI) space.
In a nutshell, N2N Connect offers FSI 
companies the economy of scale since the 
company constantly invests in the latest 
technology to prevent obsolescence. With 
less staff turnover to contend with, FSIs 
can concentrate on scaling their business 
and compete on price efficiency using its 
services.
Initially, N2N Connect faced plenty 
of resistance, given its prospect with 
clients raising privacy and security 
concerns. One such concern pertains to 
allowing a third party to handle their data, 
according to the company’s founder and 
managing director, Andrew Tiang.
“Some think that it is better handled 
in-house,” Tiang points out. “In fact, most 
FSI fraud cases are found to be in collusion 
with insiders. It took them awhile to 
realise that engaging our services is more 
beneficial to them.”
Already knowing its game plan, 
N2N Connect went on to stay ahead of 
the competition curve by always coming 
up with new ideas such as mobile trading, 
SMS trading (in 2003), and winning 
numerous awards, including the Microsoft 
Mobile Award and also Asia Pacific ICT in 
2004 and again in 2006. It also went on 
to launch many industry firsts, such as the 
launch PDA trading in 2004.
“In 2010, we started a new initiative 
to completely replace the entire exchange 
trading terminal, and the success 
resulted in the exchange deciding to 
phase out its trading platform offered to 
brokers since 1992,” shares Tiang of the 
company’s continued success. 
It was also unwavering in its focus 
on R&D. “We constantly interact with 
the marketplace to gain their feedback. 
Talking to them, understanding the pain 
and coming out with new products to 
mitigate that, is what sets us apart. 
“When we talk to brokers, they ask 
if we worked in a broking house before, 
because we sound like we have over 20 
years of experience – but we don’t. The 
fact that we could nail down specific 
issues, make them feel like we understand 
them, puts us in a better position to help 
solve their problem,” says Tiang.
An enabler of both online and 
mobile banking and stock trading

service since 2003, N2N Connect is 
effectively the largest Asian-based 
platform and service provider to Asian 
FSI companies, covering Malaysia, 
Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, 
Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong and 
Macau while serving more than two 
million corporate and retail users.
“Our non-Malaysia revenue now 
account for more than 66% of our business 
and we expect that to grow to 80% in the 
coming years,” says Tiang, pointing to 
N2N Connect’s comprehensive one-stop 
service provider stature as what sets the 
company apart from its competitors.

The Art of Coffee
Coffeetography is a technique that captures artisanal coffee 
pictures in a cafe or coffee shop. This is where I hang out 
frequently, so the subject matter and inspiration as well as skills 
come to me naturally. Some shots focus on coffee in cups, but 
it’s the act of brewing and crafting that perfect cuppa that truly 
embodies the art of the barista.

The Right Camera
If you browse through my Instagram feed, you can find pictures 
of coffee taken from many different angles, and sometimes the 
coffee is not the main focus of the picture. My Canon EOS M5 
comes with EF-M22mm f/2 STM and EF50mm f/1.8 STM (use an 
adaptor to connect it to EOS M) and it allows me to take amazing 
photos. In addition to a reliable camera, you also need to know 
the right techniques to produce excellent coffee images.

Tips and Tricks of mastering Coffeetography:
1. Take a picture closer to the Point of Interest (POI): Avoid having too much empty 
space in frame, and zoom in on the object for sharper details and clearer focus. 
Fill your photo with your object.
2. Maintain balanced object composition: To do so, you need to learn how to capture 
your subjects and frame it in a way that shows optimal proportion and depth. One 
way is to visualise lines and identify patterns within your frame, as shown with the 
rule of thirds technique as well as centre lines to capture symmetry in your photos.
3. Use DoF to focus on an object: To take a portrait, I use f/1.8 Depth of Field (DoF) to 
create a blurred background and a more focused object. I use bigger DoF like f/11 
to have everything in focus.

4. Find sufficient light: Find a table next to a window or at the 
outside of a coffee shop because it has optimum lighting to 
produce great photos.
The next step after following the above-mentioned 
techniques is to edit the photos to have the tone you desire. I 
usually edit my photos with Lightroom or VSCO. Once you’re 
finished with the editing process, you can upload the photos on 
Instagram using the Planoly app for a more well-arranged feed.

Phab-ulous Shooter
Huawei Mate 10
The Right Fit
Owning a phablet takes 
some getting used to. 
However, the ergonomic 
curved glass design of 
the Mate 10 lessens the 
discomforts of using one. 
All Night Long 
The Mate 10 features a 
huge 4,000mAh battery 
capacity – something 
that many performance 
junkies can appreciate. 
To Stretch or 
Not to Stretch
We prefer the fingerprint 
scanner for the Mate 
10 when compared to 
the Mate 10 Pro. The 
former’s scanner lies 
beneath the screen at 
the front, whereas the 
latter is located at the 
back of the phone.
Almost Ulti(mate) Form 
In hand, much like its predecessors, the 
Huawei Mate 10 is a behemoth with its 
5.9-inch display – something that may 
not be everyone’s cup of tea. We do like 
that Huawei has upped the ante with the 
design of the device; it feels luxurious and 
sturdy. That said, calling the Mate 10 the 
“Perfect 10” smartphone is 2017 would be 
inaccurate, as we reserve that title for its 
more souped up sibling: the Huawei Mate 
10 Pro. However, if you’re in the market for 
a device that is below the RM2,700 mark, 
this ever-so-slightly less powerful variant 
of the two will still do right by you. 
AI See What You Did There
Huawei has really come a long way when 
it comes to its Mate series. While we loved 
the Mate 8 – the Mate 9 was just okay for us 
– the brand has really taken it a step further 
with its latest rendition of the series. It is 
touted as the world’s first AI processor: the 
Kirin 970. According to the brand, through 
its AI computing platform, combined with 
a dedicated Neural-Network Processing 
Unit, the processor is optimised for speed, 
responsiveness and efficiency. 
Delivering on the above, the word lag 
doesn’t exist in the Mate 10’s vocabulary. 
Thanks to the Kirin 970 processor, the Mate 
10 is a powerful phablet that could possibly 
rival your productivity and entertainment 
machines. The device ran smoothly even 
with multiple apps running con-currently 
– believe us when we say we take 
multi-tasking very seriously around here. 
More Than Meets the AI
Aside from being performance optimised, 
the Mate 10 takes further advantage of 
its brand-spanking new processing power. 
Like its ever-popular P-series, specifically 
the P9 and P10, the Mate 10 houses 
a Leica dual rear camera that further 
utilises its AI-capabilities. 
Marketed as a sharp shooter when 
it comes to photography, the camera is 
programmed to identify the different types 
of subjects in real-time through intelligent 
photographic algorithms. We have a love/
hate relationship with this feature; photos 
can come out as looking over-exposed 
or simply too processed. However, the 
Mate 10 certainly makes up for it with 
its astounding low-light photography 
capabilities that is unrivalled. Its ability to 
capture sharp images on moving objects 
is something noteworthy – trying to catch 
moments has never been easier.

Putting Itself on Display
Featuring a barely-there bezel and HDR10 
technology, the 5.9-inch display of the 
Mate 10 will spoil you for choice. The 
colour reproduction on the screen is vivid 
and bright. That said, we do feel that the 
overall colour temperature runs on the 
cool-side of the spectrum – just a smidgen 
though. Consuming multimedia on the 
Mate 10 had been a pleasure. 
Watching movies or videos on the 
device is quite the experience, despite its 
hefty size and weightiness. We suggest 
you be extra careful when doing so – it 
can get very tiring holding up the device for 
extended periods (and even more painful 
when it drops). 
EMUI-tional Experience
If there was one thing that we wish that 
Huawei could continue to improve on, it 
would be the EMUI ecosystem. While the 
EMUI 8.0 is a much better platform than 
its predecessor (the EMUI 5.1), it still lacks 
that user-friendliness and crisp design of 
launchers like Nova provides us. This could 
be chalked down to personal preference. 
On the flip side, EMUI 8.0 comes equipped 
with several nifty features. This includes its 
ability to easily project onto bigger screens 
just by using a USB-C to HDMI cable – no 
proprietary dock needed. Though not quite a 
selling point for the Mate 10, it is definitely 
something that desktop replacement 
seekers could possibility enjoy.

On a 4G Kick
Apple iPhone 8 Plus
What Makes the iPhone Tick?
Using a smart device and depending solely 
on the network carrier strength can be 
tricky. Modern phones like the iPhone 8 Plus 
operate effectively on higher bandwidth as 
the internals are built to optimise speeds of 
up to 500 megabits per second.
The iPhone supports GSM, HSPA and 
LTE, which means users who are still 
on older 2G technology can still use the 
phones albeit at a strikingly frustrating 
speed right up to blazing speed of 4G. Now 
we know just like a PC, the components 
that make the hardware can only operate 
to its full capability when paired by the 
right connectivity. In other words, what’s 
the point of having a Ferrari when you only 
have kampung roads to use them on!
This review panders on the iPhone 8 Plus 
we received from U Mobile for speed test 
on both the network and how the phone 
maximises the 4G potential, giving users 
an unparalleled experience.
Being the youngest telco on the block, 
U Mobile has been catching up with 
the bigger players in terms of network 
coverage and speed. Listed as having the 
fastest 4G network from OpenSignal, we 
take the iPhone 8 Plus on a road trip around 
Kuala Lumpur to test this claim.
Look Ma No Wifi
For this review, we switched off the 
Wi-Fi features and depended entirely 
on U Mobile’s coverage. The iPhone 8 
Plus is larger in the family and what I 
noticed, being accustomed to what is 
considered ‘normal’ for the past few years 
is that lugging the iPhone 8 Plus around 
can be quite uncomfortable.
Of course, what made up for it was 
its larger Retina HD display. This made 
watching HD YouTube videos phenomenal 
and if you’re commuting on the LRT, be 
wary on what you’re watching as a nosy 
neighbour could easy catch everything. 
Throughout my time with the iPhone 8 Plus, 
the journey was lag-free, an improvement 
from a year back when the 4G support 
from the telco was somewhat mediocre, 
with many pockets in the city not having 
high-speed connectivity.
Match…Found
The iPhone 8 Plus is a technological 
wonder, equipped with an intelligent 
A11 Bionic processor, which smoothly 
matches up with the latest iOS11 operating 
software. Every function on the phone runs 
faster and smoother, which benefits the 
dual 12-megapixel cameras.
The result: pictures produced were one 
of the best we’ve seen thus far and dare 
we say, even better than the Samsung 
Galaxy S8, thanks to Apple’s constant strive 
to improve image quality by adopting the 
use of wide-angles f/1.8 lens as well as 
telephoto f/2.8 lens.

Making That Call
Very few telco’s can offer seamless 
connectivity wherever the user goes, while 
we know many attests to having the widest 
or broadest of coverage. U Mobile’s 4G is 
decent in the city without us encountering 
any slowdown whatsoever.
If you’re worried whether your high-end 
smartphones, be it the iPhone 8 Plus or the 
iPhone X will not perform to its optimum 
levels, you can lay them to rest. The phones 
have been configured to run smoothly on 
the bands and spectrums here in Malaysia, 
and the network engineers have also made 
sure the devices don’t falter.
After all, with one of the highest mobile 
penetrations in the world, no telco will 
take the chance to fool Malaysian mobile 
users, who are known to take to social 
media and bring shame to those who fall 
short on their promises.

Bravo, Sony
Sony Bravia OLED A1
Wallet Busting 
Price Tag
While spec wise the TV is 
amongst the crème de la 
crème, the price tag can 
really set your heart to stop 
beating several moments. 
With the 55-inch priced at 
RM 16,999 and the 65-inch 
cashing in at RM29,999.
Keeping it Steady 
The panel unlocks with a small 
latch at the back, meaning 
no brute force is needed. The 
design of the TV is elegant and 
stunning, and not the least bit 
flimsy. This isn’t a TV that you 
can accidentally knock over.
Making a Bold Statement
Coming in at either 55- or 65-inches, this 
isn’t a TV that is hidden away in a corner. 
Quite the contrary, it is a bold statement 
piece in your living room. With its slim 
bezel, the TV maximises your viewing area 
while blending in to your living space. The 
TV can also be mounted on a wall or stand 
on its down, thanks to its slim panel with 
a heavy, sturdy back and a weighted back 
panel to keep it in place.
Elegantly Hidden
The design of the back panel means most of 
the ports are covered with a piece of fabric, 
hiding unsightly cables and preventing 
tangles. The back panel can be easily 
removed to reveal a host of ports at your 
disposal. While the panel can be folded in 
for a wall-mount configuration, in table top 
setting, the panel connects to a removable 
weight at the bottom of the TV. The weight 
itself gives the TV a lot of stability, while 
the folded panel give the TV a streamline 
finish that allows for a wall mount to look 
almost flushed to the wall.
True Colours without 
Sacrificing Your Eyes
Hailed to bring perfect blacks and vibrant 
colours that are true to real world visuals, 
the BRAVIA OLED A1 isn't just delivering 
the brightest colours. While some QLED 
TVs sacrifice colour in favour of vivid 
brightness, Sony remains true in colour 
reproduction, thanks to its Triluminos 
display and Precision Colour Mapping. 
The TV is smart enough to understand the 
context of a picture, shutting off pixels 
where blacks or darks should be reflected. 
This means reduced noise in a picture with 
clearer colour representation. There is also 
reduced concerns regarding burn in –  apart 
from setting colours to your desired levels, 
you can also do a panel refresh for the TV, 
ensuring the screen has a longer lifespan.

Surround Sound in a 
Single Panel
The speakers and a sub-woofer are 
mounted at the back of the TV, but sound 
isn't sacrificed, boosting through the screen 
itself. There is no reflection of sound from 
the back – in fact, if you get close enough to 
touch the screen, you can feel the TV screen 
vibrate with stronger bass.  This means you 
get the same sound effects wherever you 
are in the room. Audio is distributed evenly 
throughout the room, so it's not aimed 
particularly at a certain direction, giving 
you cinematic surround sound, without 
the need for multiple towers. The screen 
might vibrate, but its sturdy built means 
you won't see it with you naked eye – no 
worries about affecting your visuals.
Android Ready
As most Smart TVs go, this one runs 
Android TV as well. with easy navigation 
and voice remote, you can control your TV 
just by telling it what you want to watch. 
With a wide range of 4K content available, 
you'd be putting the OLED A1 to its full 
potential. Although, as per most Android 
TVs, the remote can be clunky to use if 
you're not used to navigating with a remote. 
Although, with plenty ports available, as 
well as Bluetooth and Chromecast, you can 
easily hook up key boards, mouse or other 
controllers to make your life a lot easier. 
Made for Gaming
As this TV does feature 
4K HDR, it is the perfect 
companion with a Sony 
PlayStation 4 Pro.

The Mark of a Predator
Acer Predator Triton 700
Almost a Carbon Copy
In terms of design, the Acer Predator Triton 
700 bears an eerie resemblance to the 
ASUS ROG Zephyrus. Sadly, this is where 
the Triton 700 loses out. While both feature 
its keyboard onto the lower end of the 
chassis, leaving the upper part isolated 
for its thermal and cooling, the Triton 700 
has botched its completely. Why I say this 
is because at the top half of the chassis 
lies a glass case that allows you to see 
the thermals while doubling as a touchpad. 
While innovative, it is highly inaccurate and 
just hard to navigate and to get used to.
Remove This!
While the touchpad is covered 
with Corning Gorilla Glass, it 
is by no means accurate at all, 
and its weird placement makes 
it even harder to navigate.
Is it Up to Standard?
Based on its specs sheet alone, the Triton 
700 is a gaming beast, on paper. When 
running it through our benchmarks, it did 
meet some similar scores compared to 
the ROG Zephyrus. However, the gaming 
portion of the review (which is one of the 
best parts), said otherwise.
Running Dota 2, Overwatch and PUBG 
yielded mixed results, at best. When the 
games are stable without any teamfights 
or heavy use of graphics needed, the frame 
rates are fine at over 100 frames per second 
(fps). However, when a fight breaks out in 
Dota 2 or Overwatch, it drops to around 
80 odd fps, which isn’t such a bad thing. 
Of course, this a gaming laptop is running 
on the Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor with 
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Max-Q design.
As an Everyday User
All this isn’t to say the Triton 700 isn’t a 
great performer. Once I had the proper tools 
(a sturdy gaming keyboard and mouse), it 
was a pretty solid machine. Throwing Grand 
Theft Auto V on it was superb; its 15.6-inch 
Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate 
and NVIDIA G-sync ready was a joy to 
work with. Colour reproduction was great 
and accurate without looking washed over 
and there was no stuttering whatsoever 
when driving through the streets of Los 
Santos. Even in PUBG, it was the first time 
my buildings rendered properly without 
any glitches or spikes.
Keeping up with the Keys
The keyboard moves to the lower portion 
of the body, which will take some getting 
used to. However, it is fairly clicky and 
soft at the same time, giving you great 
actuation and travel time.
Left-handed Audio Jack
One great design aspect of the 
Triton 700 is its audio ports, which 
sit on the left side of the laptop. 
Now your headphone cables won’t 
collide with your mouse movement.

Right Down to it…
The Acer Predator Triton 700 is a gaming 
beast in its own right. Sadly, it just falls 
short of the ASUS ROG Zephyrus due to 
its lack of performance when it comes to 
gaming for hours on end. While it may cost a 
little less than the ROG Zephyrus, the Triton 
700 does come with a more affordable 
variant, featuring GTX 1060 Max-Q design 
alongside 16GB DDR4 memory, which is 
only half of what the 1080 variant holds. 
Made for Movies, Maybe?
Movies were also a blast as I could 
re-watch Black Mirror without any 
hiccups. The Audio was clear, and the 
picture reproduction was amazing.

An A-Class Camera
Sony Aplha A7Riii
Made for Videos
The Sony A7Riii shoots 
videos in 4K, obtained 
from 5K data, giving high 
clarity video shots.
Keeping You Steady
With 5-axis stabilisation, 
this camera compensates 
for any shakes or additional 
movements as well. 
Boosted Battery Life
Sony has improved the battery 
life on par with the A9, which 
is a common complaint for 
previous A7 series models.
Resolution
You can’t talk about the A7Riii without 
talking about resolution – that’s what the 
R stands for. At 42.4-megapixels with a 
35mm full frame Exmor R CMOS sensor, 
this isn’t anything new. In fact, the previous 
iteration has the same resolution. In terms 
of resolution, the third generation comes 
with Pixel Shift Multi Shooting, which 
gives more details by combining data 
from multiple shots. This is extremely 
useful for shooting detailed architecture, 
or any other detailed still images. The 
new BIONZ X image processing engine 
also helps to reduce noise in a shot; even 
in low light, the camera picks up a lot of 
detail, with minimal noise.
Speed
The selling point of the third generation is 
its speed. Able to capture the same sharp, 
and detailed image even when the subject 
is moving at high speeds; this is the true test 
of the camera. With continuous shooting at 
10 frames per second, the tracking of this 
camera is fast and accurate. In fact, the 
shot is so clear, the movement shot will 
still be sharp when cropped and zoomed 
in. With improved Eye AF, the camera 
tracks human eye movements faster than 
before, even with your eyes closed, so the 
focus is always on the face. 
Performance
Beyond just sharp pictures at high 
speeds, the camera sports a faster image 
processing unit. Shooting action shots in 
burst is a breeze, with little to no waiting 
time for the camera to process and write 
data to card. The auto focus is also much 
faster compared to its predecessor, giving 
399 phase detection at twice the speed. 
Another feature of this camera is its silent 
shooting capability, including in burst 
mode. While I was incredibly impressed 
with the silent shooting capability in the 
A9, the addition of this in the A7Riii is 
much welcomed. The camera also supports 
touch screen shots, so you can focus 
and shoot with just a touch.

Colour
While I did enjoy the camera immensely, 
the colour could suffer a bit. In all previous 
A7 series, as well as the A9, the colour 
reproduction has been amazingly true to 
life, without the famed blue or orange tints 
found in other popular brands. However, 
with the A7Riii, there’s a noticeable boost 
in oranges and greens, which sometimes 
take away from the composition of the 
piece. While it is highly desirable for 
artistic shots, especially product shoots, or 
studio and still life images; in landscape, 
urban, or nature photography you might 
need to tweak a bit of the settings or adjust 
the colour post production.
Built
The camera body itself is lightweight, with 
a comfortable grip. Although, depending on 
your preference, I did enjoy the additional 
dials designed for A9, which is noticeably 
lacking in the A7Riii. There are a lot of 
useful settings for the camera, but the 
menu is not that easy to navigate, with a lot 
of the features hidden in pages of settings. 
In terms of easy accessibility, it might take 
a lot of getting used to. 
Double SD Card Slots
The camera does support USB-C, with 
two SD card slots, so you won’t run 
out of space from consistent burst 
mode, with fast file transfer.
From Light to Heavy
While the body is lightweight 
and easy to carry around, 
Sony’s 
E-mount 
lenses 
aren’t exactly light.

Naturally Great…For Selfies
OPPO F5
Triple Tray
Several dual SIM smartphones 
only feature two trays – either for 
two SIM cards or one SIM, one 
MicroSD. The OPPO F5 comes 
equipped with a three-slot tray so 
you won’t have to choose! 
Save Your Face
A gimmick that doesn’t 
always work perfectly, 
the OPPO F5 has a 
phone unlock feature 
using facial recognition. 
Mirror, Mirror, On the Wall…
You’re Not Needed 
Have you stumbled upon a great front 
camera that has replaced the need for 
mirrors? Well, this is how we feel about 
the OPPO F5. Staying true to its brand 
mantra of being a “selfie expert”, OPPO 
has hit the ball out of the park with 
its latest F-series device. 
Unlike many smartphone manufacturers, 
the brand has placed the better camera at 
the front. The device’s tagline of “capture the 
real you” is an accurate statement – selfies 
were natural-looking despite beautification 
and more importantly, believable. Don’t 
get us wrong, its rear camera performs 
great as well; this making the OPPO F5 an 
all-rounder when it comes to photography.
Slim and Light 
One thing to note is that the device doesn’t 
feature a metal unibody, unlike many other 
smartphones currently in the market. This 
makes its slim disposition a lightweight. 
While metal bodies tend to get barely 
noticeable scratches through use (and 
drops), the predominantly plastic body will 
however be more prone to chipping. 
For a smartphone that is priced below 
RM1,300, the OPPO F5 has a great thing 
going for it. Of course, you aren’t going to 
get the bells and whistles of a more upper 
mid-range device. That said, the OPPO F5 is 
great value for money especially when the 
camera is your priority.
In Full View
The OPPO F5 features a 6-inch 18:9 aspect 
screen display, resulting in a pretty sizeable 
real estate for multimedia. In hand, the 
smartphone doesn’t feel big – a feat that 
could only be achieved thanks to its weight 
and thickness. You will certainly see the 
impact in screen size when playing movies 
or playing games. While most content are 
scaled to 16:9 aspect ratio, the OPPO F5 
can adapt with very minimal issues. The 
display, however, utilises an LTPS IPS panel 
– something to keep in mind if you like your 
colours to be vivid with plenty of depth.

Not Quite the Performer
If you’re used to more nippy and nimble 
smartphone performances, the OPPO F5 
will feel like it’s missing a few beats. While 
your usual suite of social media apps and 
lightweight games won’t cause the device 
to stutter, putting on graphic-heavy games 
will change all that. 
Wait, We’re Still on 
Android…Right?
We had to do a double take, and recalibrate 
our reflexes when using the OPPO F5. It is 
running on Android 7.1 (Nougat) with the 
brand’s Color OS 3.2, the latter taking cues 
(re: “inspiration”) from Apple iOS. Instead 
of the usual top drag down drawer for all 
your Android shortcuts, you swipe from 
the bottom up for them – just like iOS. 
How to uninstall apps on the device is 
similar: a long press on the app icon and 
delete it then and there. We have mixed 
feeling about this. While the UX is much 
cleaner and easy to navigate, the uncanny 
resemblance really does throws us off.

Very Smart TV
Sharp LC-60UA6800X
Bigger than Five Feets 
With a screen measuring 60 inches, the 
UA6800X delivers punchy images in a 
large format for the living room. The 
wide screen also gives it a presence that 
is commanding when set up properly 
for media playback. Thanks to Sharp’s 
high luminance technology, everything is 
crystal clear and tack sharp. 
High Quality in 4K
With more content coming out in the 
market in 4K quality, the right TV is needed 
for easier playback with no degradation. At 
the same time, the X4 Master Engine Pro 
II processor that is built into the TV allows 
SD and HD videos to be up-converted to 
4K resolution with minimal noise while 
maintaining image quality. Plug in any 
of your lower resolution content and 
watch it in 4K goodness.

that it comes built-in with Android TV. 
Unlike other smart TVs out there, this is 
using the Google operating system so it is 
a tad more sophisticated. Browse through 
the Google Play Store to download apps, 
search the web using Google Search and 
then connect all of your media playback 
device to enhance your viewing experience. 
Full Port Selection
The UA6800X comes with four

Subtle and Discreet
Acer Predator Helios 300
Easily Accessible
When it comes to obscenely outrageous 
gaming laptops, Acer Predator is a definite 
contender when it introduced its pride 
and joy, the Predator 21x. Of course, the 
gargantuan gaming laptop also commands 
a hefty price tag of over RM39,999 
and it’s already sold out.
While not in the same realm as the 
Predator 21x, the Predator Helios 300 
holds its own in a more subtle and discreet 
way. Even at RM5,999, it doesn’t seem as 
bad, seeing as the Predator 21x already 
set the bar for sky-high pricing. Adopting 
a similar colour scheme to its entire 
line-up, the Predator Helios 300 carries 
a black and red colour scheme atop a 
brushed metallic chassis.
Stuck right on the back is the signature 
Predator logo for all to see; in this sense, 
discretion and subtlety is not its strong suit.
Stuck in a Conventional Space
The Predator Helios 300 falls within the 
conventional crowd but in no way is that a 
bad thing per se. Aside from its aluminium 
and plastic blend, the Predator Helios 300 is 
pretty much a sub-standard gaming laptop 
with no discernible way of standing out.
Its keyboard is rather springy, soft 
and not overly clicky, which is great for 
people who can’t stand it. However, the 
layout of the keyboard strays away from 
regular external keyboards. If you’re used 
to laptop keyboard layouts, then you 
should feel right at home.
The touchpad is smooth, accurate and 
responsive and will respond to Windows 
10 gestures, which is a big plus. Of 
course, nothing beats the prowess of an 
actual mouse but if you’d rather stick to 
the touchpad, you do you.
One thing I hate that plenty of gaming 
laptop brands do is place the headphone 
jack on its right side. Depending on which 
headphone you’re using, some wires are 
longer than others, which will inevitably 
cross paths with your mouse. This makes 
gaming a bit harder than normal, especially 
when there’s a loose wire in the way.
Aerodynamically Designed
Located at the rear of the laptop is Acer 
Predator’s 
proprietary 
AeroBlade 
3D 
cooling fans. It promises to keep the airflow 
within the hardware cool and clean and 
can be controlled through the pre-installed 
PredatorSense app.
When the CoolBoost feature is turned 
on through the app, it will increase the 
maximum fan speed during heavier usage. 
As the dual-fan cooling system is located 
beneath the CPU and GPU, you can control 
the fans through PredatorSense. Leaving it 
at auto will set the rhythm between 2,400 
to 2,600 RPM on Auto while Max fires on 
all cylinders, topping out at 5,660 RPM.
Through PredatorSense, you can also 
check on the temperatures of both the 
CPU and GPU as well as overclock the 
GPU. Normally, it runs on 1,721Mhz but 
Turbo takes it up a notch to 1,885Mhz. 
Temperature-wise, the CPU can go as high 
as 85° while the GPU reaches 65°. If you 
plan on keeping the fan speed at Max 
while overclocking the GPU, I’d suggest 
you invest in a good pair of headphones as 
it tends to get pretty loud.
Bright and 
Clear
While the 15.6-inch 
HD display isn't as 
bright as I would've 
liked, it still holds its 
own when gaming or 
streaming videos.
Part of the Parcel
The power button is located 
at the top right corner of 
the keyboard instead of 
being on the chassis.

Peaked Performance Ratings
Strictly a mid-range gaming laptop, the 
Predator Helios 300 runs on a 7th generation 
Intel Core i7 processor paired with a 
GeForce GTX 1060 GPU and a dedicated 
6GB VRAM. While it runs Dota 2 (90-100 
fps, depending on in-game situations) and 
Overwatch (100+ fps) just fine, it did stutter 
in PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG). 
With that said, it could be due to PUBG’s 
erratic performance, no matter what 
sort of system is running it.
For a few games, everything would be 
running smoothly without any lag or delay. 
In the next few games, it would suddenly 
take longer than usual in the loading 
screen, which will then result in either me 
dying or running around aimlessly as none 
of the buildings would render.
A Great Everyday Performer
When it comes right down to it, the 
Predator Helios 300 is a reliable mid-range 
gaming laptop. While you shouldn’t be 
expecting top-tier performance ratings 
due to its above-average specs, the 
Predator Helios 300 does make up for it 
when you’re not gaming.
Whether it be music or movies, it can 
certainly keep up with your lifestyle while 
still being a somewhat affordable-ish 
gaming laptop (I say this mostly because 
gaming laptop prices have skyrocketed 
over the past year or so). 
For your Fingers
The keyboard is soft 
and somewhat clicky, 
great for your fingers.

Maximising your Experience
ASUS ZenFone 4 Max Pro
It Gives You 
Everything
The ZenFone 4 Max Pro 
comes with two SIM 
slots with an additional 
microSD card slot, instead 
of the usual hybrid slot, 
which makes you choose 
one or the other.
Sharing the Juice
A nifty and unique feature 
of this phone is that it can 
double as a power bank; you 
can hook it up to other devices 
to charge them as well.
Monster Power
True to the Max in its name, the phone 
comes with a 5,000mAh battery. As a 
comparison, most phones are in the region 
of 3,000mAh; for example, the iPhone 
X sports 2,716mAh while the Samsung 
Galaxy Note 8 has a 3,300mAh battery. 
So yes, this phone’s battery is no joke. It 
runs all day and then some, even under 
heavy usage. Text all day, game all day 
and you’d still have some left over. With a 
battery this size it does take slightly longer 
to fully charge it from zero, but it’s not that 
much longer, considering the power output 
you get from this capacity.
Bulky Built
While it sports a monstrous-sized battery, 
the built of the phone unfortunately mimics 
the size too. It’s built on the bulkier side, so 
the phone feels much less refined compared 
to other counterparts in the market. The 
finish is a smooth matte aluminium back 
so that helps boost the aesthetics, giving 
it a classy look. The phone comes with 
a huge 5.5-inch display, so you don’t 
have to strain your eyes.
Fit More in Frame
The rear dual camera features a 
16-megapixel standard lens and a 
5-megapixel wide angle lens, so you can 
fit in more landscape, and more people 
in a group shot. The quality of shots is 
pretty decent, although it does take some 
fiddling for the camera to recognise the 
subject you’re trying to focus on. While 
the focus isn’t quite an issue, the colour 
can sometimes turn out too bright or too 
dark. That is the same for the front camera. 
Although its 16-megapixels gives very 
clear and sharp pictures, the colours can 
sometimes turn out to be a tad dark.

The interface is reactive and performs well 
for daily use. Although, try to multitask too

X Marks the Spot
Motorola Moto X4
Off the Beaten Path
Ever since the acquisition of Lenovo, 
Motorola’s smartphone line-up has gone 
through some rather eccentric design 
aesthetics, diching the curved back and 
dimple for something just as peculiar – we’ll 
get to that in a bit. And now, the Moto 
X, the OG of Motorola’s bang-for-buck 
flagship, is now in its fourth iteration; has 
the Lenovo brand treated it well?
Hello Jack
Moto hasn’t abandoned 
the 3.5mm audio jack 
yet, for those who prefer 
a wired connection with 
their audio peripherals.
Glass Cannon
Now, I’m going to come out and say it – the 
Moto X4 is a beautiful piece to behold, a 
wonderful melding of glass on its front 
and back with metal. However, glass 
being glass, makes the Moto X4 a fragile 
piece as well. Though it’s remarkably 
grippy, be very careful as to not let it 
vibrate its way off a table, or let it fall, lest 
you’d like a hairline crack.
Former Champion
Now that the Moto Z family is designated 
as the flagship, the Moto X4 now 
occupies the upper-mid range bracket 
of the smartphone ladder. It lacks 
compatibility with Moto Mods, but its 
curved sides make it an absolute joy and 
comfort to wield one-handed (having a 
smaller 5.2-inch display also helps!). All 
the buttons are on the right side (sorry 
left-handers), with a textured power 
button for easy identification.
Swipe Home
You can ditch the software 
buttons 
in 
favour 
of 
gesture-based navigation, 
giving you more display 
real estate to work with.
I’ve Got the Power
Motorola’s 
TurboPower 
charging technology gets 
the Moto X4 up and running 
in no time - up to six hours

Moto Cycle
Equipped with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 
630 mated with 4GB of RAM, the Moto 
X4 is nothing short of impressive. Running 
a relatively stock version of Android 
7.1.1 kept bloat to a minimum, with the 
much-loved Moto add-ons in tow. Daily 
activities proved to be no challenge, with 
enough battery life to last me more than a 
day. Gaming on it was a smooth experience, 
managing to run the Android port to Jade 
Empire without any hints of slowing down.
Lone Boomer
The earpiece does double duty as the lone 
loudspeaker for the Moto X4; you will not 
find a speaker grilled on this device. At 
all. For those sessions where everybody in 
the office needs to hear your questionable 
music choices, it packs quite a punch. Do 
not crank it up to maximum however, as 
you will sense some minor distortion.
My Lovely Camera Hump
Instead of a miniscule camera hump, 
Motorola apparently decided that bigger 
is better, and puts a prominent one in 
the posterior of the X4. Tucked within 
that trunk is a dual camera system - a 
12-megapixel dual autofocus pixel shooter, 
and another 8-megapixel ultra-wide angle 
shooter. Both get the job done, but there 
is a noticeable lag if you’ve enabled HDR 
mode - you’re out of luck if your subject is 
Barry Allen or Superman.

ROG FX503V utilises a brushed metal look 
on its body, giving it an air of opulence, 
if you will. It’s also quite light, given the 
fact that it is a gaming laptop. Although 
it’s nothing compared to the ASUS ROG 
Zephyrus, the FX503V weighs at just 2.5kg 
and only 2.4cm thin when closed. 
Mixed Emotions
At its core, the FX503V is strictly an 
entry-level to mid-range gaming laptop. 
What’s surprising is its use of the 7th 
Gen. Intel-Core i7-7700HQ processor 
paired with the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 
1050 graphic processing unit (GPU). As it 
is an i7 processor, the laptop is great on 
a day-to-day basis but it’s disappointing 
that the review unit we got held only 
8GB of DDR4 memory. It would’ve been 
nice to have at least 16GB.
Of course, that is just a slight blimp 
as the FX503V also comes with a 1TB 
7,200RPM SATA HDD with a 128GB SATA3 
M.2 SSD. This meant the laptop was quick 
and snappy, to a certain extent.
Strictly a Mid-Ranger
The FX503V is a great gaming laptop, 
that is only if you’re looking to play 
games that doesn’t have a heavy list of 
demands. With that said, games like Dota 
2, Overwatch, CS:GO and PlayerUnknown’s 
Battlegrounds (PUBG) are a few games 
that perform really well on the FX503V. I 
managed to hit between 90-100 fps on all 
four games with relative ease, although in 
Dota 2 and PUBG, the laptop did stutter for 
a bit during graphic-intensive scenes.
Even 
through 
benchmark 
scores, 
it clearly shows that the FX503V is a 
mid-range laptop, only topping out in the 
3DMark: Sky Diver test but falling short in 
Time Spy and Fire Strike.
Standardised 
Display
Its 15.6-inch full HD 
display is bright, clear 
and sharp on all fronts.
Discreet Lighting
The illumination of the 
keyboard is discreet. The 
red barely flushes over 
the keys but rather, gently 
surrounds itself.

Great for Movies
Aside from casual gaming, the FX503V 
is also a great companion when it comes 
to watching movies. Although nothing 
beats watching shows through a large TV 
screen, the FX503V does its job well with 
its 15.6-inch Full HD IPS display panel. 
Re-watching shows that have a lot of 
camera movement and colour like Inception 
and Grand Budapest Hotel, the laptop 
performs admirably. There’s great contrast 
and colour accuracy when watching or 
playing so you don’t have to worry about 
them being off-colour.
The FX503V also has a wide-viewing 
angle of 178° so you can watch your 
movies or game while getting other things 
done as well. Of course, why would you 
be doing anything else when gaming and 
movies sound so much better?
It Will Suffice
I have always preferred devices that 
provides an ample amount of ports. That’s 
mostly because I’m always connecting 
multiple devices to the laptop. The FX503V 
comes with two USB 3.0 ports and one USB 
2.0 port. That’s only enough for a keyboard 
and mouse combo with one left to spare. 
There’s also a HDMI port, a combo audio 
jack and an RJ45 LAN port.
I guess it should suffice, especially 
since there isn’t much you can do with the 
FX503V except gaming, binge-watching 
and working. What’s great is that the laptop 
is a good driver in all three aspects. I could 
game in peace but also binge-watch my 
series in crystal-clear quality while getting 
some work done. 
Clicking Clack
The keyboard is great

Spin Me Right Round
Acer Spin 5
Added Security
The Spin 5 features a 
fingerprint scanner located 
on the top of the trackpad 
with 
Windows 
Hello 
support. You can now log 
into the computer without 
the need of a password.
Much of the Same
As far as options go, the Spin 
5 comes in two variants, one 
of which is a 13.3-inch model 
and a 15.6-inch model.
Work and Play
These days, choosing a laptop often boils 
down to what you want to do with it. 
Typically, the choices include thin and 
light laptops that are good for a day’s 
worth of work, or gaming laptops with 
ultra-powerful specifications. Sadly, there 
is no discernible middle ground to speak of.
If you’re looking for a device that can 
work both ways, Acer has just the thing 
with its recently-launched Acer Spin 5. 
Designed to look unassuming, the Spin 5 
is functional enough to work as a mobile 
workstation while decked out with 
components that’s good enough to game.
Choices, Choices
The Spin 5 is powered by an Intel Core 
i7-7700HQ processor, supported with 8GB 
of DDR4 memory, a 256GB SSD as the OS 
drive and a 1TB HDD for the rest of your 
storage needs. The main difference here is 
the usage of GPUs in both laptops. While 
the 13.3-inch model comes with built-in 
Intel HD Graphics, the 15.6-inch model 
sports a discrete NVIDIA GeForce GTX 
1050 GPU. This makes it good enough to 
game in 720p and in 1080p in certain cases.
As far as I/O ports are concerned, the 
Spin 5 comes equipped with two USB 3.0 
ports and one USB 2.0 port. It also features 
a HDMI port that allows you to output to 
an external display. The display sports a 
15.6-inch IPS panel with 10-point touch 
support, making it useful considering 
the Spin 5’s capabilities.
Build Quality
What’s great about the Spin 5 – besides 
its specs – is the level of quality that goes 
into building it. As the entire chassis is built 
with aluminium, making it lightweight, yet 
sturdy enough to resist light bumps and 
scratches that may occur.
A standout feature on its own is that the 
Spin 5 is the first convertible laptop to sport 
a discrete GPU. Its display can be rotated 
360° to convert it into a tablet, a standalone 
display or a tent, depending on your needs.
Throughout our time with the Spin 5, 
the two modes most often used were the 
laptop and display stand. While tablet 
mode does sound nifty at first, holding up 
a 15.6-inch slate that weighs 2.2kg isn’t 
exactly an easy thing to do for long.

User Experience
Our experience with the Spin 5 is a bit of 
a mixed bag. Tt certainly functions well as 
a laptop built for work and gaming, and 
performance is rarely an issue as the Kaby 
Lake CPU and the GTX 1050 GPU combine 
well to give you an excellent computing 
experience on-the-go.
In fact, even when we were gaming 
on this machine, the laptop barely 
heated up, which is great considering 
how typical gaming laptops can get 
unbearably hot when gaming, especially 
for long periods of time.
Of course, there are only a few 
complaints. One is the position of its 
trackpad, which makes the left palm rest 
woefully small compared to the right. 
This makes typing on the keyboard an 
awkward experience, unless you disable 
the trackpad and use a mouse instead. This 
is a bit of a shame as the keyboard is very 
comfortable to use, even if you’re typing 
and gaming over long periods.
Another complaint we have has to do 
with its battery life. Acer has mentioned 
that the laptop is capable of lasting up to 
13 hours on a single charge, but throughout 
our time with the laptop, this estimation is 
consistently off by three to four hours on 
the 15.6-inch model. It may be a bit more 
accurate with the smaller model, but it’s 
still a point worth taking note of.
Closing
The Spin 5 is a convertible notebook that 
serves a great middle ground for work and 
performance. There are some growing 
pains that one needs to get used to, but 
otherwise, it is a sold machine that you can 
bring around for work and games.
Sporting two models for you to choose 
from, you can now pick a variant that 
perfectly suits your needs and usage. 
Awkward Trackpad Placement
One complaint is the position of its trackpad, 
which makes the left palm rest woefully small 
compared to the right. This makes typing on 
the keyboard an awkward experience.

Samsung Galaxy J7+
Mid-Range Juggernaut
Familiar Form
Samsung’s not setting any design trends 
with the Galaxy J7+, opting for the 
tried-and-true metal slab common amongst 
smartphones in this price range. It’s not 
exactly groundbreaking (think of a certain 
fruit, circa 2014), but it works. Just a note of 
caution: a full metal body looks appealing, 
but be wary that you do not drop this device, 
or bump it against any hard surfaces - dings 
and dents will be (painfully) apparent.

“Well this is a 
familiar shape. 
Oh, Bixby’s here. 
Wonder how this

Trial and Error
The Galaxy J7+ has a fingerprint sensor 
nestled beneath the home button, and 
unlocking your device only requires you to 
make contact with the sensor - you don’t 
need to press the home button to activate the 
sensor. When it works, it works beautifully; 
however, throughout my testing, I seem to 
be getting an equal amount of duds and 
unlocks, which could be attributed to skin 
oils. For best results, keep your paws and 
the sensor squeaky clean with regular 
wipes. Alternatively, you can opt for Face 
Unlock, or any other security methods.
Decked Out
The Galaxy J7+ comes equipped with 
most of the features found in Samsung’s 
flagship devices. For one, you get a Full HD 
AMOLED display with the option to enable 
Always On Display, a dual camera array, 
and 4GB of memory with 64GB of internal 
storage. Performance will definitely get you 
through the day, and then some - it can last 
a full working day with no issue, and with 
juice to spare.

Yes, there’s a standard 
3.5mm headphone jack.

zoom. It does falter in low-light conditions, 
taking a bit longer to focus on your subject, 
but for those social media postings, this 
will definitely get it done.
Bring the Noise
Instead of a bottom firing speaker or a pair 
of front-facing ones, Samsung opted to 
place its speaker on the side, next to where 
the power button is. It’s a departure, yes, 
but the positioning works, as my hands 
weren’t covering the speaker during daily 
use. And it is loud - very loud.
Bixby’s Here
Rather than a dedicated hardware button, 
swiping right from the home screen reveal 
Bixby Home, Samsung’s attempt at a digital 
personal companion. Bixby Home brings 
you contextual information, like reminders, 
your calendar, and local weather. Mine has 
Flipboard and Giphy cards, which ties into 
how I use my devices. Bixby doesn’t get in 
the way, and some of the info (like weather) 
is genuinely useful.

you are able to maintain two 
separate messenger accounts.

It’s a Dyson
If there ever was a brand that is both 
known for innovation and premium pricing, 
it would be Dyson. Made popular by its 
blade-less floor fans, the brand is equally 
known for its cord-less vacuums. We took 
the Dyson V8 Absolute Plus for a spin, while 
we were amid minor renovating and spring 
clean and see how it stacks up against our 
trusty ol’ vacuum cleaner. 
Everything You Can Think Of
When purchasing the Dyson V8 Absolute 
Plus, you can be absolutely (ha ha) sure 
that you are getting everything it has to 
offer. Have a difficult crevice that doesn’t 
see the light of day to clean? There is an 
attachment for that. Need something to 
deep clean a carpet with cat hair all over 
it? Just riffle through the box and you’ll find 
the perfect combo – a modular system… 
for your cleaning needs.   
Exercise While Cleaning
While 2.6kg doesn’t sound like it’s 
tremendously heavy, it is a workout to 
use. The trigger button must be held down 
constantly to run the vacuum – we would 
appreciate a trigger lock of some kind 
here to remedy this. The weight after a 
while does make your biceps burn a little. 
Thankfully, it’s for the short-term as a full 
charge can only clock in between 30 to 40 
minutes worth of operation.

PRICE: RM159
For Butterfingers
Over the past few years, the iPhone has 
arguably been one of the most powerful 
smartphones in the market, but also one 
of the most fragile – no thanks to Apple’s 
insistence on using an all-glass chassis. 
One of the first things most, if not all iPhone 
owners will do once they get their hands 
on it, is getting a case to protect their 
iPhones. Element Case, a renowned phone 
case maker has recently come up with a 
case that will help the most butterfingered 
owner: The Element Case REV.
Overkill Protection
A cursory glance at the Element Case 
REV makes us think that this case is 
purpose-built for those careless enough to 
drop their devices. Made from a mixture 
of polycarbonate and reinforced rubber, 
this case was designed with military 
specifications in mind.
Other safety features included in the 
REV case include the DropShock Corners, 
which help prevent damage caused by 
drops that happen on the corners of the 
phone, as well as the X-Frame chassis, that 
helps protect the rest of the device from 
accidental scrapes and scratches.
Function Over Form
While the REV Case will protect your phone 
from an apocalyptic nuclear holocaust, 
the unfortunate sacrifice is down to its 
design, which will not be to everyone’s 
liking. If you’re into the minimalistic and 
understated looks, the REV Case will be 
an anathema to you. With the features 
mentioned earlier, the REV Case sports 
numerous sharp edges that doesn’t 
necessarily fit well into your hands Due to 
its shock-resistant nature, this makes your 
phone bulkier than it already is.

Quick Charging
A neat inclusion is its Quick

up to 70 minutes of of battery life 
from just 10 minutes of charging.
Thank you, Spotify
Of course, music choice and taste are 
subjective, seeing as no two sets of ears 
are the same. Through my weeks of giving 
the WH-1000XM2 a run for its money, 
it has not let me down at all. It covered 
a wide range of genres, meaning that 
you could listen to just about anything. 
It had great, punchy bass that goes well 
with its clear mids and highs. In terms of 
clarity and sharpness, you can turn your 
volume all the way up without any signs 
of distortion or cracking.
Upgrading its Lifespan
While the battery lifespan on the 
MDR-1000X was acceptable, that wasn’t 
enough for Sony as it has since improved 
the battery on the WH-1000XM2. It now 
promises over 30 hours with wireless and 
noise-cancelling on and over 40 hours if 
you’re using it through a wired connection. 
Twice the Charm
As a direct successor to the MDR-1000X, the WH-1000XM2 has some huge shoes to fill. In terms of design, it mostly just stays the same 
with similar plush leather fabric on the earcups while the swivel headband is elastic, capable of fitting plenty of different head sizes. It 
also feels a lot sturdier compared to its predecessor, which was loose and flimsy after a few weeks. A neat touch to the outer earcups 
was the textured finish, giving it a sort of grainy, yet refined look and feel to it.
Riddled with Features
The main selling point of the WH-1000XM2 
is its noise-cancelling ability, which has 
been top-notch since the first iteration. 
Of course, it has since received some 
upgrades like the inclusion of atmospheric 
pressure optimising, ambient sound control 
and adaptive sound control. All these new 
features were added to personalise sound 
to your environment. The WH-1000XM2 
also comes with its own equaliser, virtual 
surround sound as well as sound control.

NAS Storage 
In the pursuit of data redundancy and 
backups, the argument for more space is 
always a compelling one. However, not 
everybody has space, both physical and 
digital to back-up everything. Western 
Digital has been offering its Red family of 
hard drives for home and small business 
NAS units and with its latest offering of a 
whopping 10TB in a single 3.5-inch drive. 
It’s easy to see the appeal of having a set 
of large capacity hard drives in a two, three 
or four bay NAS. Added to that are a series 
of NAS-specific features that make it a 
dependable as a backup solution for your 
home or small business network.
Stability in Storage
The combination of WD’s HelioSeal 
technology, the NASWare 3.0 firmware and 
3D Active Balance Plus control technology 
allows for much longer lasting drives as 
these technologies reduce the energy 
consumption, heat and vibration of the hard 
drive, all without sacrificing NAS specific 
features. An ever-present, constantly active 
NAS with lower risk of failure will help put 
your mind at ease. The drives come with 
a three year warranty as well to allay any 
fears users might have.
Easy RAID Setup
Due to the large capacity of a single 
WD Red hard drive, it’s incredibly easy 
to setup a RAID with data redundancy. 
This means still having plenty of space 
for your data despite running a mirrored 
RAID setup. Moreover, its exclusive 
NASware technology improves NAS 
storage performance by addressing issues 
such as compatibility, reliability, noise and 
vibration as well as error recovery controls. 
This allows for optimal performance 
without compromising attributes that 
NAS owners value.

Board-controlled Fans
Something unique is that the fans 
on the GPU can be connected via 
headers to the motherboard for 
fine-tune controls of the speed.
Not A Vega
This graphics card is still a contender for 
mid-high gaming, but it is certainly not an 
RX Vega card. However, it doesn’t mean it 
is gimped. The Polaris architecture in the 
GPU is nothing to scoff at, and it can go 
head to head with team green. The 2,304 
shader processors gives it enough juice to 
render any games at high, if not ultra-high.
Power When You Need It
When games ask for more rendering power, 
the ASUS Strix RX 580 will do the job with 
no problem. The 8GB of GDDR5 RAM 
means all your textures will be loaded, and 
everything can go high definition. Thanks to 
the ASUS three-fan setup, it will be cool; 
although, it can be annoyingly buzzing on 
full load. If you are in a quiet room, you 
will notice it. If you have headphones 
around you – nothing is lost.
Gaming Prowess
As it is a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), 
you would think rendering graphics on 
screen should be a piece of cake; and of 
course, it is. Running Rise of the Tomb 
Raider, the card peaked at a respectable 
82fps at 1080p resolution. Unfortunately, 
it did falter on 4K resolution, hitting 29fps. 
Then again, most mainstream cards apart 
from the top-tier cards rendered similar 
framerate numbers, so it is still a win.

machines to be paired, in an office setting 
when multiple people are working on a 
project, this is highly useful.

VERDICT: 
“A bit on the pricier side, but a solid mouse that handles your day to day work excellently. The additional 
features improve productivity greatly, a good mouse to bring for working in any situations.” - Satoko 
PRICE: RM339
DIMENSIONS (HXWXD): 61.6 mm x 100.3 
mm x 34.4 mm
WEIGHT: 106 g
SENSOR TECHNOLOGY: Darkfield high precision
DPI: 200 to 4000 dpi (can be set in 
increments of 50 dpi)
BUTTONS: 7
Compact & Portable
The size of this mouse also 
means it’s quite portable, while 
not sacrificing on comfort. This 
way, you can set up anywhere 
and bring this mouse along.
Straight Forward
No fussy setup, no crazy settings. plug in 
the dongle, and your mouse is good to go. 
The design of the mouse fits comfortably 
for small or medium sized hands, and 
doesn’t feel bulky at all. For a person with 
larger hands, this might feel a tad small. 
Although, the arrow buttons on the side 
would be much suited for a right-hand user 
rather than a left hand user.
Make It Your Own
The middle function button, scroll wheel 
and side buttons are all customisable. 
When the mouse connects to the computer, 
a popup will prompt you to download the 
Logitech Options software. With that, you 
can assign features to buttons, control 
point and scroll settings, change function 
keys etc.  The mouse also features arrow 
buttons on the side, making for even easier 
navigation.  The scroll wheel supports 
left right tilts, which enables certain 
function that can be adjusted on the 
Logitech Options software.
Go on For Months
A single charge for this little guy gives 
you usage for months, and we’re not even 
kidding. Since I’ve first gotten the mouse a 
couple months ago, I’ve been using it daily 
and I have not needed to recharge it at all. 
The mouse recharges with a standard USB 
cable and there is virtually no downtime 
when charging. The feedback on this 
mouse feels solid, with an adjustable 
scroll wheel that allows you to alternate 
between bumpy or free scrolling. The only 
thing I’ve encountered though, is if you very 
accidentally dropped the mouse, the button 
and the scroll wheel might seem a bit 
sticky, or some of the functions will glitch 
– might be due to a misaligned spring.

Lenovo and IDC Reveals 2018 Technology Trends
From left to right: Sharath Sreenivasan, 
Director, Lenovo CAP Commercial Council & 
Product Management, Khoo Hung Chuan, 
General Manager, Lenovo Malaysia and 
Singapore, and Kenneth Liew, Senior Research 
Manager, Client Devices, IDC Asia Pacific.
enovo reveals a vital shift that 
is predicted to drive technology 
trends in 2018 and beyond. 
During an IDC InfoBrief commissioned by 
Lenovo, ‘Enabling the Future Workspace 
– Agile, Intelligent and Engaging’, the 
changing workforce demographic is 
expected to experience a rapid adoption 
of new technologies that will lead to 
fundamental changes in the workspace 
and how people do work.
The IDC InfoBrief finds that Asia’s 
millennials, who makes up more than 
59% of the workforce by 2020, will drive 
the overall transformation across Asia 
Pacific, excluding Japan (APeJ). Their 
knack for new technologies combined 
with enterprises’ quest for competitive 
advantage will fuel the adoption of high 
potential innovation accelerators.
This 
includes 
augmented/virtual 
reality 
(AR/VR), 
cognitive/artificial 
intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), 3D 
printing and robotics. Subsequently, it will 
lead to the rise of new behaviours and 
practices, particularly around human-device 
interfaces, collaboration, talent practices, 
visualisation and data-driven insights.
According to the IDC InfoBrief, 
APeJ will represent the largest market for 
innovation accelerators and is forecasted 
to reach more than US$600 billion by 
2020. These changes will result in new 
norms across Asia Pacific.
Some of the key technology trends 
identified during the IDC InfoBrief includes:
• By 2019, 20% of Asia 1000 (A1000) 
companies will have a device as a service 
(DaaS) agreement in place, with 1% to 
have completely transitioned to DaaS.
• By 2019, two-thirds of Windows 10 
devices (PCs and tablets) will be managed 
via 
unified 
endpoint 
management 
(UEM) platforms and one in every 
three enterprise will have consolidated 
desktops and mobile management IT 
teams into a single operations unit.
• By 2020, 40% of digital transformation 
initiatives will be supported by cognitive/
artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
• By 2020, A1000 firms will use open 
innovation to allocate expertise to 15% 
of new projects, which will increase new 
product introduction rates by over 50%.
• By 2020, over 20% of information 
workers will use AR at the desktop or on 
mobile to manipulate digital information, 
interact with real-world objects and to 
collaborate with colleagues.
• By 2021, the worldwide market for AR/
VR is expected to reach US$215 billion.
• By 2020, 20% of all field service 
technicians will use AR.
• By 2019, 20% of all new enterprise 
IT 
mobile 
apps 
will 
include 
an AR feature set.
• By 2020, VR is expected to transform 
20% of corporate training, which 
will cut costs by half compared 
to traditional methods.
According to IDC, companies in the 
region have to stay competitive by taking 
a holistic approach to create a smart office 
across multi facets, be it for physical 
space, work culture and technologies.
Meanwhile, Lenovo believes that in 
order to provide a truly engaging digital 
experience in the workspace, taking a 
user-centric approach to transformation 
is crucial. Enterprises need to look past 
the idea of traditional PC to create 
a mobile, smart and personalised 
experience for its employees.
This can be done by offering a 
variety of form factors and design choices 
to meet modern workspace demands 
with next generation devices, ensuring 
device mobility while also maintaining 
enterprise-grade reliability.
As 
for 
physical 
workspaces, 
transformation can be accelerated with 
bimodal IT and agile practices, solutions 
and commercial models tailored for 
different segments and markets, as well 
L
as solutions that slows both devices and 
management capabilities.
Apart 
from 
that, 
Lenovo 
is 
focusing its efforts on innovation and is 
investing approximately US$1.4 billion 
in R&D globally, to help customers 
transform and lead this new world 
of intelligent transformation.
“This is truly an exciting time for 
fans of technological progress. In fact, we 
believe that we are at an inflection point, 
where a demographic shift and accessible 
technology will drive rapid changes in how 
we will work over the next few years,” 
says Khoo Hung Chuan, General Manager, 
Lenovo Malaysia and Singapore.
“However, business leaders should 
not take this change for granted. In 
order to survive and thrive in this new 
era, organisations must create the 
foundations for a smart workspace 
today. This means investing in intelligent 
transformation that enables personalised 
computing technologies and innovations 
such as PCaaS, artificial intelligence, 
multi-device synergy and AR. This is 
crucial to keep up with end users’ today 
and future needs.”

unveils a study highlighting 
OTT 
(over-the-top) 
video 
content 
consumption trends across six countries. 
The 
study, 
commissioned 
through 
research firm Kadence International, 
represents 
patterns 
of 
close 
to 
850mn internet users.
Titled ‘OTT Media Consumption’, 
the study polled participants across 
Australia, 
Indonesia, 
India, 
Japan, 
Philippines and Thailand showcasing 
audience preferences and habits. 
Some of the key trends that 
emerged from the survey includes an 
increased demand for local OTT players 
across markets (Hotstar in India, Hooq in 
Indonesia and Niconico in Japan, amongst 
others), as well as the opportunity for a 
hybrid model that is either ad-supported 
or subscription-based for OTT, which 
could enable operators to reach a range 
of customers, from those only willing to 
pay on a pay-per- view basis to those who 
want unlimited access to all content by 
purchasing a subscription.
Vincent Low, Chief Media Strategist 
&amp; Head of Media Product Marketing 
APJ at Akamai Technologies says: “It’s 
critical for OTT service providers across 
the region to understand user preferences 
as viewers increasingly shift to a culture 
of consuming content on any device, 
any time, and anywhere. What now 
becomes the differentiator are those 
micro-moments when they access their 
preferred content that could either be 
instances of delight for the user from good 
overall quality of experience or frustration, 
which can potentially lead to churn.”

vision for enterprise transformation in 
an increasingly app-driven and multi-cloud 
world. With more business and IT leaders 
recognising digital transformation’s positive 
impact, 
VMware 
demonstrated 
how 
enterprises can achieve business outcomes 
with a portfolio of solutions that help 
modernise data centres, integrate public 
clouds and empower digital workspaces.
Businesses 
in 
Southeast

on 
their 
digital 
transformation strategies, as IT plays an 
increasingly important role in creating 
differentiated customer experiences and 
driving business outcomes. 
In a recent Gartner survey of CIOs, 
companies in the region are spending 
slightly more than a quarter of their IT 
budgets on digitisation, and this is set to 
increase by more than 10% in 2018.
“There are clear and tangible 
results 
from 
digital 
transformation, 
and more organisations are pushing 
the boundaries on what is possible 
by leveraging technology. We remain 
committed to equipping organisations 
with the right digital tools to run, manage, 
connect and secure any application on 
any cloud to any device, enabling them 
to take full advantage of opportunities 
before them,” says Alex Loh, country

HERE IS PART TWO OF OUR EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH BOOST CEO, CHRISTOPHER TIFFIN.
THE RIGHT WAY TO 
BOOST
By Teh Wi-Liam

85
JAN 2018
C.com: What will be the 
drive for Boost right now? Is 
it getting more end users to 
adopt the service or are you 
looking to create an ecosystem with 
the merchants first?
Christopher: If you had to ask me 
where the priority would be, it would 
be on consumers. Because, there are 
products and services we can offer that 
are not directly linked to the merchant 
ecosystem. However, we have to grow 
the ecosystem quickly to bring more 
relevancy to the customers.
PC.com: Does Boost function much 
like how a bank does in terms of 
being able to deposit or withdraw 
money, as well as being able to do 
almost everything a bank offers?
Christopher: That depends on how you 
use a bank. If I look at 50% of the population 
that have been using the banks and its 
ATMs in a traditional manner, we want 
to replace that portion of the relationship. 
Are we looking to offer services like that 
in the future? Yes, definitely.
But, to reiterate, it will be on a 
micro/nano basis rather than a premium 
credit basis. But definitely, when you talk 
about digital financial services, it’s not 
going to be just about payments. We have 
to move into those other verticals. So, 
we are exploring in areas like insurance 
and the such, but in a more targeted and 
focused manner. More importantly, it has 
to be better, quicker and more efficient.
PC.com: I’ve noticed that you can 
also purchase vouchers through the 
gaming platform, Steam. How did 
that come about? Is it because of the 
target audience or did you realise 
that there’s a lot of gamers who use 
these kinds of services?
Christopher: Leading up until we got our 
wallet license, we did see an opportunity 
in offering digital vouchers. If you look at 
a lot of the voucher systems in the market, 
most of it aren’t digital. We weren’t quite 
sure if gaming was going to be as popular 
as it has proven to be, so we decided to 
test out a few key merchants in different 
areas. That consisted of gaming, food 
and beverage, online shopping and a 
couple of different segments.
In terms of gaming, it’s a very 
interesting side to see because the 
gaming side of things has been fantastic, 
and this creates a differentiation between 
us and other companies. We were 
one of the sponsor in a recent gaming 
tournament a few months back. Of course, 
we don’t want to be seen as just a gaming 
platform, we’d much rather prefer to be 
seen as an enablement to that.
PC.com: How has the response been 
for Boost when it comes to gaming, 
F&B, online shopping and such?
Christopher: 
So 
far, 
it’s 
been 
encouraging. I think the online shopping 
contingent is a little bit less as compared 
to the rest due to the option of going to 
the online store. However, what has been 
interesting is the gifting function that we 
have, where you can buy a voucher and 
just gift it to a friend. I know other guys 
have similar functions but I’m proud to say 
that we started that *laughs*
But I think without a doubt, gaming 
has been one of our most popular services 
with F&B a close second.
PC.com: As of right now, Boost is 
under Axiata with over 350 million 
users where you can deploy it 
instantly. What’s holding you back?
Christopher: From a regional perspective, 
we’ve made the decision that with 
Malaysia being the host country is where 
we’re going to incubate a lot of the Boost 
development requirement. We have also 
launched a gamification version of Boost 
in Bali, Indonesia, which is going to evolve 
in the next couple of months. It’s a phase 
progressive approach across the region 
but I think the end goal would be to create 
a regional brand. That way, we can start 
leveraging a lot more, which will create 
quite a lot of differentiation.
Malaysia is great home ground 
for that as there’s always a lot of 
visitors coming in. This is better than 
having standalone brands in each 
market, which can work together but it 
wouldn’t be as relevant to consumers 
who move around a lot.
PC.com: Lastly, two last questions 
before we let you go. What are 
your plans for 2018 and what 
can your users and consumers 
can expect from Boost?
Christopher: I think 2018 is going to 
be an interesting year and there will be 
a lot of activity in this space. 2018 is all 
about building and convincing the market 
as to why this is a fundamental way to 
move forward in the future. We’re excited 
to show what we’re building at the 
moment from both a merchant ecosystem 
and technology perspective.
It’s a year of growth for us and we are 
looking forward to hearing the feedback 
from both our merchants and consumers 
as to what else would help in accelerating 
the growth of the ecosystem.

achine learning will be a 
defining technology of 2018, 
doing more to change how 
we live and work than any 
technology since the internet.
To understand why, we first need 
to get past sensational headlines about 
robots ‘stealing our jobs’. Innovation and 
the use of tools to make life easier have 
been a marker of progress throughout 
history, through agricultural and industrial 
revolutions. We are now in a data 
revolution and as we progress, so some 
of the roles people do will change, but 
progress has consistently brought the 
creation of new jobs, new business 
models and whole new industries. Far 
from making us obsolete, machine 
learning will augment humanity and make 
us more effective. 
Machine learning is already all 
around us; written into the software 
on our phones, in our cars and homes 
and in the business software we use 
at work, helping us access information 
and make better, more informed 
decisions, more quickly. 
According to Gartner, AI technologies 
will be present in “almost every new 
software product” by 2020, making this an 
exciting and potentially decisive moment 
in time for software providers and a 
crucial crossroads for the businesses 
who buy from them.

Machine Learning
The most important technology since the Internet

certainly be key areas of development 
in the years to come, but machine 
learning is changing the world around 
us in significant ways right now. Its 
ability to dramatically reduce the 
time and improve the effectiveness of 
our decision-making may sound less 
sensational than driverless cars, but 
it is what will make machine learning 
an era defining technology.  
Organisations 
that 
harness 
the 
power 
of 
machine 
learning 
will quickly leap ahead, due to the 
speed and efficiency of the improved 
decision-making it powers. No business 
can afford to sit back and wait. If they do, 
they will be left behind. 
The adoption of machine learning 
is growing hand-in-hand with the growth 
of cloud computing, for good reason. The 
seamless integration of cloud applications, 
platforms and infrastructure are crucial to 
the growth and effectiveness of machine 
learning; they open up machine learning 
to ever greater pools of data, breaking 
down silos and drawing in data from 
across organisations and their networks.
Trying to unleash machine learning 
in pockets within an organisation is like 
trying to grow plants in the dark.  The 
algorithms that drive machine learning 
need data, as much, and from as many 
sources, as possible. The more it feeds on 
that data the smarter it becomes and the 
greater its decision-making potential.
The growing maturity and adoption 
of cloud technologies add to the reasons 
why 2018 represents such a sweet spot 
for machine learning.  Cloud is an integral 
part of almost every business’s IT strategy, 
driving their digital transformation and 
ability to exploit the value of their data. 
If big data promised us there were 
riches to be found in digital transformation 
and cloud provided the fundamental 
building blocks for digital transformation 
then machine learning is the first 
truly industrialised tool for unlocking 
those riches at scale. 
Strategy is crucial in all of this. The key 
to getting the most from machine learning 
is to look for applications that deliver long 
term strategic value, which fundamentally 
transform functions or critical processes 
within the business, rather than delivering 
a short term ‘wow factor’.
Reducing the time taken to create 
accurate, reliable forecasts can have a 
significant impact, not only on a business’s 
ability to plan, budget and resource 
effectively, but all those things combined 
will have a considerable financial upside 
for any company. 
The beauty of machine learning is that 
its uses are almost limitless. Where there 
is value in rapidly analysing and deriving 
understanding from data, it has a role to 
play. Where there is value in identifying 
trends or anomalies in vast data sets it can 
have a transformative effect, from clinical 
research to compliance and security. 
Right now, machine learning is 
driving a revolution in customer service. 
In almost any customer facing industry a 
vast number of enquiries fall into a limited 
number of categories and many are simple 
to predict and respond to using chatbots 
that are powered by machine learning 
that refines and hones their ability to 
accurately respond to customers. This 
reduces waiting times and frustration 
among customers and makes businesses 
more efficient. It also frees up customer 
service agents to handle the limited 
number of complaints that are more 
unique and require human intervention. 
This last example is perhaps the 
most tangible instance where machine 
learning is augmenting the ways in which 
people work. It isn’t going to replace 
people but it can certainly make people 
better at whatever they do. 
If there is a risk with machine 
learning, it is in ignoring it. 2018 should 
be the year businesses commit to explore 
and unlock the value of machine learning 
if they are not doing so already.

By David Rajoo,The author is the Director, Systems Engineering, Symantec Malaysia 
his past year, cyber criminals 
caused 
major 
service 
disruptions 
around 
the 
world, using their increasing 
technical proficiency to break through 
cyber defences. In 2018, we expect the 
trend to become more pronounced as 
these attackers will use machine learning 
and artificial intelligence to launch 
even more potent attacks. 
Gear up for a busy year ahead. 
Incidents like the WannaCry attack, which 
impacted more than 200,000 computers 
worldwide in May, are just the warm-up 
to a new year of more virulent malware 
and DDoS attacks. Meanwhile, cyber 
criminals are poised to step up their 
attacks on the millions of devices now 
connected to the Internet of Things both 
in offices and homes.
The cybersecurity landscape in 2018 
is sure to surprise us in ways that we never 
imagined. As 2017 draws to a close, here 
is what you can expect over the course of 
the upcoming year: 
1. Blockchain Will Find Uses 
Outside of Cryptocurrencies but 
Cyber criminals Will Focus on 
Coins and Exchanges 
Blockchain is finally finding applications 
outside 
of 
crypto-currencies, 
expanding its functions in inter-bank 
settlements with the help of IoT 
gaining traction. However, these 
use cases are still in their infancy 
stage and are not the focus for 
most cyber criminals today. Instead 
of attacking Blockchain technology 
itself, cyber criminals will focus on 
compromising coin-exchanges and 
users’ coin-wallets since these are 
the easiest targets, and provide 
high returns. Victims will also be 
tricked into installing coin-miners on 
their computers and mobile devices, 
handing their CPU and electricity over 
to cyber criminals.
2. Cyber criminals Will Use 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) & 
Machine Learning (ML) To 
Conduct Attacks
No cyber security conversation today 
is complete without a discussion 
about AI and ML. So far, these 
conversations have been focused 
on using these technologies as 
protection and detection mechanisms. 
However, this will change in the next 
year with AI and ML being used by 
cyber criminals to conduct attacks. It 
is the first year where we will see AI 
versus AI in a cybersecurity context. 
Cyber criminals will use AI to attack 
and explore victims’ networks, which 
is typically the most labour-intensive 
part of compromise after an incursion.
3. Supply Chain Attacks Will 
Become Mainstream
Supply chain attacks have been a 
mainstay of the classical espionage 
and signals-intelligence operators, 
compromising upstream contractors/
systems/companies and suppliers. 
They are proven to have a high-level of 
effectiveness, with nation-state actors 
using a mix of human intelligence to 
compromise the weakest link in the 
chain. These attacks are moving into 
the cybercriminal space, becoming 
mainstream. With publicly available 
information on suppliers, contractors, 
partnerships and key-people, cyber 
criminals can find victims in the 
supply chain and attack the weakest 
link. With a number of high profile 
successful attacks in 2016 and 2017, 
cyber criminals will focus on this 
method in 2018.
4. File-less and File-light Malware 
Will Explode
2016 and 2017 have seen consistent 
growth in the amount of file-less and 
file-light malware, with attackers 
capitalising organisations that lack 
in preparation against such threats. 
With fewer Indicators of Compromise 
(IoC), use of the victims’ own tools, 
and complex disjointed behaviours, 
these threats have been harder to 
stop, track and defend against in 
many scenarios. Like the early days 
of ransomware, where early success 
by a few cyber criminals triggered a 
gold-rush like mentality, more cyber 
criminals are now rushing to use these 
same techniques. Although file-less 
and file-light malware will still be 
outnumbered by orders-of-magnitude 
as traditional style malware, they will 
pose a significant threat and lead to 
an explosion in 2018.
5. Organisations Will Still Struggle 
with Security-as-a-Service 
(SaaS) Security
Adoption of SaaS continues to grow at 
an exponential rate as organisations 
embark on digital transformation 
projects to drive business agility. This 
rate of change and adoption presents 
many security challenges as access 
control, data control, user behaviour 
and data encryption vary significantly 
between SaaS apps. While this is not 
new and many of the security problems 
T
Top 10 trends for cybersecurity
2018 Cybersecurity 
Predictions

JAN 2018
are well understood, organisations 
will continue to struggle with all 
these in 2018.
Combined with new privacy 
and data protections laws adopted 
by regulators across the world, these 
will pose major implications in terms 
of penalties, and more importantly, 
reputational damage. 
6. Organisations Will Still Struggle 
with Infrastructure-as-a-Service 
(IaaS) Security – More Breaches 
Due to Error, Compromise & 
Design
IaaS has completely changed the way 
organisations run their operations, 
offering massive benefits in agility, 
scalability, innovation and security. It 
also introduces significant risks, with 
simple errors that can expose massive 
amount of data and take down 
the entire system. While security 
controls above the IaaS layer are 
customer’s responsibility, traditional 
controls do not map well – leading to 
confusion, errors and design issues 
with ineffective or inappropriate 
controls being applied, while new 
controls are ignored. This will lead to 
more breaches throughout 2018 as 
organisations struggle to shift their 
security programs to be IaaS effective.
7. Financial Trojans Will Still 
Account for More Losses Than 
Ransomware
Financial Trojans were some of the first 
pieces of malware to be monetised by 
cyber criminals. From simple beginnings 
as credential harvesting tools, they 
have since evolved to advanced 
attack frameworks that target multiple 
banks, and banking systems that send 
shadow transactions and hide their 
tracks. They have proven to be highly 
profitable for cyber criminals. Today 
the move to mobile application-based 
banking has curtailed some of the 
effectiveness, so cyber criminals are 
now moving their attacks to these 
platforms. Cyber criminals’ profits from 
Financial Trojans is expected to grow, 
giving them higher gains as compared 
to Ransomware attacks.
8. Expensive Home Devices Will Be 
Held to Ransom
Ransomware has become a major 
problem and is one of the scourges of 
the modern Internet, allowing cyber 
criminals to reap huge profits by locking 
up users’ files and systems. The gold-rush 
mentality has not only pushed more 
and more cyber criminals to distribute 
ransomware, but also contributed to the 
rise of Ransomware-As-A-Service and 
other specialisations in the cyber-criminal 
underworld. These specialists are now 
looking to expand their attack reach 
by exploiting the massive increase in 
expensive connected home devices. 
Smart TVs, smart toys and other smart 
appliances can run into thousands of 
dollars and users are generally not 
aware of the threats to these devices, 
making them an attractive target 
for cyber criminals.
9. IoT Devices Will Be Hijacked and 
Used in DDoS Attacks 
In 2017, we have seen massive DDoS 
attacks using hundreds of thousands 
of compromised IoT devices in people’s 
homes and workplaces to generate 
traffic. This is not expected to change 
with cyber criminals looking to 
exploit the poor security settings and 
management of home IoT devices. 
Furthermore, the inputs and sensors 
of these devices will also be hijacked, 
with attackers feeding audio, visual 
or other faked inputs to make these 
devices do what they want rather than 
what users expect them to do.
10. IoT Devices Will Provide 
Persistent Access to Home 
Networks
Beyond DDoS attacks and ransomware, 
home IoT devices will be compromised 
by cyber criminals to provide persistent 
access to a victim’s network. Home 
users generally do not consider the 
cyber security implications of their home 
IoT devices, leaving default settings and 
not vigilantly updating them like they do 
with their computers. Persistent access 
means that no matter how many times a 
victim cleans their machine or protects 
their computer, the attacker will always 
have a backdoor into victims’ network 
and the systems that they connect to.

Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus
BRINGING 
MAYHEM TO THE 
NEXT LEVEL
GAMETIME reviews

olfenstein: The New Order was a multifaceted game. It had a 
storyline that wouldn’t look out of place in mainstream Hollywood 
while taking no prisoners with its sold gameplay which made 
definitive titles like Halo and Call of Duty blush. The 2014 title 
was a showcase of how a good narrative and gameplay mechanics can still make 
first-person shooter titles fresh, despite how many get pumped out every year.
Will Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus give us more new things to salivate 
over? Or will MachineGames provide us with more twists and surprises in the 
new title? That’s what we’re here to talk about.

A Nazi-filled Narrative
Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus starts 
you off where its previous title left off, 
with William Blazkowicz (BJ) waking up 
from a five-month coma. BJ was saved 
after the events that occurred in the 
first game, which led to the destruction 
of the Deathshead’s fortress.
Short of spoiling a rather gruesome 
opening sequence, BJ finds himself in 
Nazi-led America where the game then 
begins in earnest. If you did not play the 
first game (which you totally should), The 
New Colossus gives you an option to 
recap the events that happened in The 
New Order, which explains how America 
and almost the rest of the world fell under 
the Third Reich’s rule.
Like The New Order, the protagonists 
and villains in The New Colossus are 
very well-written. BJ is now a part of a 
resistance to free America from the grip of 
the Nazis, whilst Frau Engel, a character 
from the first game, is now the main 
villain for the second title. 
One gripe I do have about the story 
is the unnecessary need to showcase 
BJ’s backstory again and again. His 
story arc has already been established 
in the first game. The overarching plot 
of Wolfenstein II isn’t too different from 
that of the first game, and while it had a 
few gasps from me, it’s ultimately slightly 
unsatisfying because of how the end of 
the game was set up to be a sequel-bait 
to a likely third title.
A Different Kind of Americana
The graphics in The New Colossus are 
amazing but before we delve into it, I must 
credit MachineGames on its visualisation 
of how America would look like under Nazi 
rule. Some locations included a decimated 
New York City, Washington DC acting as 
the Third Reich’s base, several locations in 
Texas and even the planet Venus!
Each location in The New Colossus 
has its own back story; in New York’s 
case, it was destroyed by an atomic bomb 
towards the end of World War II, which 
led to the Nazis taking over America 
and by extension, the rest of the world. 
Texas, or more specifically the city of 
Mesquite, is BJ’s hometown and there 
are incidents that happened here that 
shocked me a fair bit.
Beyond the locale, a lot of the 
set-pieces, such as the vehicles, submarines, 
warships and even the flying fortress 
Ausmerzer looks amazing, even if you’re not 
counting the cutscene sequences.
MachineGames also did an excellent 
job in designing its locations, making each 
and every one of them look different but 
still retaining some of its American charm. 
For the most part, The New Colossus 
still retains its dark and grim demeanour 
throughout the game, just to remind you 
on how gruesome it can truly get.
As a side note: if you’re playing this 
game on the PC like I have, using a powerful 
GPU adds to the gaming experience a 
lot. At some points, the game looks like 
a beautiful painting with great usage of 
lights and shadows. Combine that with 
high frame rates and that makes spending 
a tonne of money on your PC worth it.
Enemies Are Enemies
The New Colossus pits you against 
enemies new and old, something you’re 
probably not used to in The New Order. 
While the standard SS soldiers are still 
around, there are plenty of new varieties 
that have creeped up to constantly keep 
you on your feet. These range from 
your typical shirt soldiers to engineers, 
Shotgun Elites and Commanders, which 
you will need to get rid off first. Also, 
look out for the annoying Schwarzegarde 
Elites that tend to pin you down 
in the worst of positions.
Mechanical enemies will also make 
an appearance in the game, but with a 
catch. This time, they aren’t considered 
as boss fights. In fact, The New Colossus 
does not have any boss fights to speak of, 
except right at the end, which feels like 
a bit of a let-down. Of course, when you 
go up against giant panzerhunds (robotic 
dogs) every once in a while, it is still 
enough excitement for one person.
It’s like I’m Actually There
One of the best things about The New 
Colossus (aside from its story), is the 
gameplay. While maintaining the same 
style and feel as its predecessor, it is 
still polished in certain aspects, one of 
which is its audio. With a proper set of 
speakers or headphones, it really puts you 
in the shoes of BJ himself.
In keeping with the lore, plenty of 
the weapons in-game retain its German 
names, such as LaserKraftWerk (laser 
rifle), the Maschinenpistole (machine 
gun) and my personal favourite, the 
Ubergewehr, an energy weapon based 
off the BFG9000 from Doom. The level of 
realism in The New Colossus is unreal; 
you can almost feel the recoil when firing 
and reloading sounds realistic enough that 
you’d almost think it’s actually happening.
Sadly, while all these weapons are 
amazing, there isn’t much variety to choose 
from. As they say, quality over quantity. On 
the bright side, some of these weapons 
can be dual-wielded for extra firepower.
To improve the viability of these 
weapons, you can attempt side quests 
to unlock upgrades, also known as 
contraptions and perks, which will add 
on to your weapon loadout. While these 
are completely optional, it is in your best 
interests to upgrade your weapons as 
much as you can to go up against the much 
tougher enemies (specifically those that 
can wipe you out in a matter of seconds.)

Sounds effects in The New Colossus 
also play a big role. What MachineGames 
have implemented, and what I thought 
was a great addition, is the inclusion of 
non-weapon sound effects. For example, 
if there are enemies near you and even if 
you can’t see them at first, metal music 
will slowly start playing in the background 
and will steadily get louder as you begin to 
engage them. The music then stops once 
you’ve killed all the enemies in the area.
At its core, The New Colossus is 
a violent game, both in terms of story 
and gameplay. It’s engaging right down 
to the very last minute, thanks to the 
combination of its story and gameplay, 
which gives gamers a purpose of sorts to 
push through the game.
Conclusion
Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is easily 
one of my favourite games of 2017. From 
its characters to its story, its gameplay, 
the graphics and even its sound effects 
all meld into one amazing game. I’m fairly 
certain this is one game that is capable 
of standing against the test of time in the 
next five to ten years.

More Everything
outh 
Park: 
The 
Fractured 
but Whole builds upon the 
ground-breaking work laid down 
by developer Obsidian Entertainment in 
2014 for South Park: The Stick of Truth. 
This time around, Ubisoft has switched 
to its internal San Francisco studio for 
development. Sure, there are some 
differences in gameplay and world design, 
but with more of the same.
There’s more edgy humour, meta 
gags, fan service and of course, more 
insane premises. It’s not hard to mistake 
the game for a 15- to 20-hour episode 
of South Park when you’re out exploring 
the 2.5D representation of the town and 
solving simple puzzles.
Play Pretend Gone Wild
The game eases you into the story with 
the player controlling the mute New Kid in 
town as he witnesses the final moments 
of a fantasy-themed roleplay battle. This 
quickly devolves into a Marvel Cinematic 
Universe-style superhero quest to find 
a missing cat with a $100 reward, all so 
Cartman can use the cash to jumpstart his 
own franchise based of his Batman-like 
superhero, The Coon. 
You start out as a sidekick to The 
Coon and must slowly earn the right to 
establish your own brand of superhero 
and eventually, a Netflix series. The game 
gleefully blurs the lines between what’s 
real and what’s all in the kids’ collective 
imagination. 
Costumes 
are 
cobbled 
together from household items or any 
scrap the kids find in town but when using 
their powers, laser beams, teleportation 
and bright blasts of energy are the norm.
One interesting thing is that every 
now and then, battles between enemies 
are put on hold as the kids must clear the 
street in order to allow traffic to pass by. 
The best gags in the game take advantage 
of this ambiguous reality as red Lego bricks 
are declared as lava, stopping progress or 
an enemy unit decides an attack doesn’t 
count which negates the previous turn. 
S-Class Gameplay
The core of South Park: The Fractured but 
Whole is it’s turn-based combat, similar 
to strategy games like Fire Emblem or 
The Banner Saga series. As opposed to 
the previous game’s style of gameplay, 
where the player and his party stands in 
one place and attack in turns, you now 
fight enemies on a grid-based battlefield 
where positioning is vital. Every attack 
or power used during combat affects a 
certain number of squares from a specific 
range, with some knocking back enemies 
or changing the position of the character 
controlled at the end of turn.
To defeat your enemies, the player 
must think a few steps ahead, figuring 
out how to hit the most possible enemies 
per turn with your abilities. As the battle 
progresses, you build an ultimate bar, 
which inches forward every time your 
team deals or receives damage. This 
allows you to unleash a special ultimate 
attack, and each character has a unique 
ultimate attack. We’re talking about 
‘ultimates’ in the same vein as Final 
Fantasy 7’s Limit Breaks. These attacks 
cut away to full-blown cinematics, 
bombarding the enemy with a flurry of 
attacks and the player with some over the 
top gags. Over the course of my 20-hour 
or so playthrough, I never got sick of 
re-watching these ultimate attacks.
One issue to consider is the game’s 
difficulty. Sadly, the game is fairly easy,

even on higher difficulties. While there’s a 
good amount of depth in terms of strategy 
gameplay, I found myself yearning for more 
opportunities to strategise during tense 
battles, as opposed to just fighting another 
rapid pack of professor Chaos’ goons.
To be fair, there are times that the 
game decides to break the rules of its 
turn-based combat and pits you against 
bosses that have powerful timed attacks 
that happen in real-time. If these events 
spilled over to random encounters, it 
would definitely keep players on their toes 
throughout the course of the game. 
Outside of combat, you and your 
team’s super hero powers can be used to 
solve puzzles or to clear a path to unexplored 
areas. While the puzzles alone aren’t overly 
complicated, the act of solving them were 
rather enjoyable. This is due to the fact the 
New Kid’s primary superpower involves 
his bowels and inhuman flatulence. The 
New Kid’s farts are powerful enough that 
it bends the fabric of space-time. As you 
progress, you’ll gain the ability to rewind 
and pause time, and even summon a clone 
of yourself from the past.
Coon-clusion
If you were never a fan of South Park and 
its crude humour, this game is not for 
you. If you are a hardcore fan, you’ll have 
the time of your life playing the game 
and discovering all the references to 
the show. For those who are indifferent 
or on the fence about the show, South 
Park: The Fractured but Whole is a 
strong turn-based strategy RPG with a 
dysfunctional town, full of crude and 
edgy jokes. Overall, it’s an entertaining 
game, and never did I once regret the 
time spent playing it.

THE WAYS OF 
THE ALCHEMIST
By Satoko Omata
By Satoko Omata
The Alchemist Code
ased on the popular Japanese 
SRPG title, For Whom the 
Alchemist Exists (誰ガ為のア
ルケミスト), The Alchemist 
Code is a turn-based mobile strategy 
RPG-based game published by gumi.
The gameplay itself is a classic 
turn-based system where players can 
manoeuvre the characters with grid-based 
movements. With over 50 characters up 
for Summons – basically a gacha – and 
with more being added, the characters 
can be customised with different levels of 
jobs, elements, skills and equipment. For 
each battle, users can assemble a team 
of four, along with two additional support 
members. It comes with the option of 
hiring a mercenary from your friend’s list 
or from other players.
There are several modes to the 
game: Story Mode focuses on the main 
characters and their battles around the 
Seven Kingdoms of Babel (I’ll get to that 
in a moment); Events, where you can get 
additional bonuses and gifts; Arena Mode 
where you battle in a one-on-one format 
with fellow players; and Co-Op Mode, 
where players work together to take on 
higher level dungeons.
Influenced from Sins
The story follows two squires of the Blue 
Flame Guard, Logi and Dias, knights to the 
Kingdom of Envylia. In their quest to explore 
the Seven Kingdoms (where alchemy is 
outlawed), they find themselves gaining 
the forbidden power, thus exploring the 
characters’ different approach to protect 
their world. Agatha, a nun from an 
Envylian convent who cares deeply about 
her childhood companions, behaves like 
their older sister. The Kingdoms’ names 
are inspired by the seven deadly sins, with 
the chapter opening to the home base of 
Envylia, as well as battles with Wratharis.
The story is very much a stereotypical 
situation between two guys and one 
girl fighting for a better future, with a 
mediator that often appears as a witch. 
In this case, Ouroboros, known as the 
Observer of Destiny who appears as the 
Door of Truth. For anime fans, the whole 
premise of the story rings a bell. What is 
interesting is the effort in making the story 
engaging. gumi invited famous Japanese 
voice talents to voice the cutscenes 
and the dialogues. This comes with the 
addition of high quality animations in the 
cutscenes, providing a very well-done 
storyline for a mobile game, despite the 
story ringing some bells for alchemist 
fans of other franchises.
The game mechanics itself is simple 
enough to understand: move your character, 
pick and action and then wait your turn. 
While it may seem simple, the game itself 
does require a lot of planning and thought. 
Back attacks get extra points while certain 
characters abilities could be better for 
long- or short-ranged attacks. Healers can 
also deliver much-needed medicine before 
you get completely wiped out.
While the initial stages start 
off simple enough, it will soon turn 
difficult. Opponents at a higher level 
come with more tricks up their sleeves 
and players will have to reconsider their 
team, the skillsets available and the 
capabilities of their characters.
Getting your Grind On
While moving up the ranks, you get to 
collect boxes that comes with some 
extra bonuses for you to level up your 
character. Unlike many games that 
feature IAP (in-app purchases), The 
Alchemist Code doesn’t heavily focus 
on that, which is a plus. There are

plenty of opportunities to earn coins 
and gems needed when you want to 
upgrade your characters.
The gameplay itself is rather slow. 
Having to wait for the characters to 
react as well as for the animations to 
play can take up a lot of time. While 
there is a fast-forward feature and an 
auto-battle mode, it still runs a tad bit 
slow. Being a gacha game, there are 
opportunities to obtain new characters 
with varied skills, which will help build 
a stronger team. Along with the usual 
complaints, there is a sort of imbalance 
when it comes to certain character 
types. In my case, I got too many bards 
and not enough hunters and gunners.
For a mobile SRPG, The Alchemist 
Code his most of the sweet spots. It has 
engaging characters, gorgeous designs 
and animations as well as bonus 
dungeons. Although the game’s layout 
can be somewhat confusing with no 
explanations on what certain characters 
functions are for, it is generally easy to 
pick up after a few rounds. The speed 
may be a bit of a hindrance, but other 
than that, it is generally a solid game.

ith the ASUS ROG Masters 
2017 already at its end, it 
was an event-filled two-day 
event of Dota 2 and Counter Strike: Global 
Offensive (CS:GO). The LAN finals saw a 
total of 12 teams from both categories, 
which saw Team Empire and Gambit 
Esports coming out on top on the second 
day in Dota 2 and CS:GO, respectively.
First up was CS:GO with the boys 
from Europe (Gambit) going up against the 
Chinese powerhouse, Tyloo. While Gambit 
topped their group stage, Tyloo was 
having difficulty and started the playoffs 
in the lower bracket, having to play more 
matches compared to Gambit. Through 
it all, they overcame the odds with a 
2-1 victory of Splyce in the quaterfinals 
and another 2-1 win over Greyhound 
Gaming in the semifinals.
Gambit on the other hand, took down 
5Power Club in a convincing 2-0 win in the 
quarterfinals as well as knocking out Vega 
Squadron 2-1 in the semifinals. This set 
the stage for an exciting grand final and it 
did not disappoint.
The first map took place on Overpass 
with Tyloo on the Counter Terrorist (CT) 
side while Gambit were the Terrorists. 
Tyloo took the first few rounds of the map, 
making life tough on Gambit, especially 
economically. Over the course of the 
map, Gambit were able to claw their 
way back into the game, taking things 
to the final round. In the end, Gambit 
managed to keep the map from going into 
overtime with a 16-14 score.
Inferno was the second map of the 
series and it was also the shortest of the 
three maps, taking a little over half an 
hour for Gambit to take the win against 
Tyloo in a 16-4 score. Tyloo looked uneasy 
on Inferno, which explains why they only 
picked up four rounds in the map. Gambit 
however, looked the dominant side even 
after their close shave in the first map.
The last and final map of the series 
turned out to be the most exciting as it 
went into overtime. It was heartbreak for 
Tyloo as they were leading the series with 
a strong lead midway through Trains. But, 
mistakes eventually caught up with them 
and so did Gambit. Tyloo needed just one 
more round to take it to map point but it 
was not meant to be as Gambit won the 
final map 19-16 after overtime.
Gambit took home US$117,500 while 
Tyloo won US$58,800. This Major LAN 
tournament was Gambit’s first win, the last 
coming from the premier PGL Major Krakow.

After the break, it was time for a 
best-of-five Dota 2 series between Optic 
Gaming and Team Empire. The first game 
was already an indication to how great 
the series was going to become, going 
over the hour mark and Empire actually 
making an unbelievable comeback into 
the game. After managing to destroy 
all the barracks in Empire’s base, Optic 
were unable to claim the throne. This 
paved the way for Empire to slowly turn 
the game into their favour, even when 
their base is exposed.
What followed was a very back 
and forth game between both teams 
with Optic pulling out ahead, leading 2-1 
into the series. Sadly, they weren’t able 
to close out the fourth game, allowing 
Empire to climb back into the foray and 
taking things to the last and final game. 
In game two and game three, Optic 
were able to pull back-to-back wins over 
Empire with incredible coordination, 
team play and individual skill.
Game 
four 
was 
a 
complete 
turnaround for Empire as they manage to 
tie up the series while giving Optic a hard 
time. This led to the last game, which was 
the second longest game to be played in 
the series. The first game took one hour 
and five minutes while the last game took 
a little under that time.
In the end, Empire came out on 
top, besting Optic in its best-of-five. The 
Russians take home US$117,500 for first 
place while Optic receives US$58,800.

itans are known as a race of 
deities in Greek mythology as 
well as being the largest moon 
of Saturn. In the tech industry, it is now 
known as NVIDIA’s most powerful GPU. The 
NVIDIA TITAN V will be driven by the green 
machine’s latest architecture, NVIDIA Volta.
One of the main features of the TITAN 
V’s Volta architecture incorporates both 
NVIDIA CUDA and Tensor Cores to deliver 
unparalleled performance ratings. The TITAN 
V will also be the first “consumer-grade” GPU 
to be running the new Volta architecture. 
There is a total of 640 Tensor Cores to 
deliver over 100 Teraflops per second 
(TFLOPS) of deep learning AI performance 
with 21 billion transistors.
The TITAN V comprises of 12GB 
of HBM2 memory made with 3D 
packaging technology. There will also 
be a 16-phase DrMOS power supply 
with integrated real time current and 
thermal monitoring capability.
The design aspect of the TITAN V 
will also turn heads, foregoing its usual 
black/silver colourway in place for a gold/
black variant instead. The aluminium body 
also features a copper heatsink with better 
cooling efficiency and quieter fan acoustics.
As it stands, the price for the NVIDIA 
TITAN V comes at a whopping US$2,999 
(approx. RM12,221.82). Sadly, it can only be 
shipped around the United States, Canada, 
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. What’s 
more, NVIDIA has limited the number of GPUs 
sold to a maximum of two per customer.

Steam no longer supports the cryptocurrency
t appears Lord Gaben has spoken, 
Bitcoins will no longer be accepted 
as a a payment method on Valve’s 
platform, Steam. This is due to 
the volatile value of Bitcoin as well as 
its high transaction fees.
This is mostly due to the prices of 
Bitcoins skyrocketing recently, which has 
seen a significant increase in transaction 
fees on the Bitcoin network. As Valve has 
no direct control over the transaction fee, 
especially with Bitcoin’s ever-changing 
market price. This results into Steam users 
purchasing games at an extravagantly 
high cost with Bitcoin.
Over the past few months, the 
volatile nature of the value of Bitcoin has 
always been erratic, which fluctuates as 
much as 25% over the course of a few 
days. This in turn causes problems and 
issues for Steam users who are trying 
I
No Love for Bitcoins
to purchase games via Bitcoin. How this 
happens is when a user checkout an 
item on Steam, they will then transfer 
a specific amount of Bitcoins for the 
cost of the game, including a specific 
amount to cover the transaction fee 
charged by the Bitcoin network.
With the value of Bitcoin only 
guaranteed for a period of time, the value may 
change by the time the transaction process is 
over. This leads to users having to pay more to 
cover the latest transaction fees.
Under 
normal 
circumstances, 
Steam would either refund the original 
payment back to the user, or have them 
transfer additional funds to cover the 
remainder. Of course, this would mean 
that they would be hit with the transaction 
fee again in both cases.
After all that has happened, Steam 
has since deemed Bitcoin as a flawed 
payment option. However, Steam is 
looking into re-evaluating the use of 
Bitcoin but at a later date. 
Zowie’s white-on-white mice may just be your saviour
he Zowie FK and ZA are two 
of the more popular gaming 
mice in Zowie’s lineup. They 
know get the white-on-white 
treatment with a special edition available 
to both models. This comes after plenty of 
positive feedback from fans regarding the 
Zowie EC white series.
Both the FK and ZA features a glossy 
surface, providing an extra grip for your 
palm. Both devices are also ergonomic 
and ambidextrous by design; this means 
both left- and right-handed users can 
enjoy the feel of the mouse. Another great 
feature of both the FK and ZA is its ability 
to be used with needing to install drivers. 
You can literally plug them in and start 
gaming without having to wait.
Both mice also feature four pre-set 
DPI settings at 400/800/1,600/3,200 DPI. 
Of course, why would you need to have 
your DPI set above 800, right? There will 
also be adjustable USB polling rates at 
125/150/1,000 Hz.

t looks like Grand Theft Auto V 
(GTA V) is finally getting a new 
GTA V Online Update known as the 
Doomsday Heist. This will be only 
the second heist to ever come to the 
Online contingent of GTA V, with the first 
making its appearance on 10 March 2015.
The storyline behind the Doomsday 
Heist will pit you and three other friends as 
you try to save San Andreas from impending 
doom. To help you along the way, you will 
team up with an “unlikely alliance” between 
some of the characters seen in the game. 
From the cover image, it seems 
you will be getting tons of new vehicles 
and weapons to create chaos with as 
we can see jetpacks and underwater 
cars that can fire missiles. Leave it to 
Rockstar Games and GTA to make your 
wildest fantasies come true.
With Heists being one of the biggest 
crowd pullers in GTA V Online until 
today (present company included), it is 
refreshing to see Rockstar Games finally 
introducing a new segment into it as the 
current one has gotten stale. What makes 
the current heist even worse is the level of 
exploitation many players have discovered 
over the past two years, which grants 
them plenty of in-game cash through a 
couple of levels of grinding.
Of course, that isn’t necessarily 
the players’ fault as the pay-out for the 
current Heist is abysmal. Let’s hope 
Doomsday Heist will be a lot more 
enticing than its predecessor. 
Zelda snatches ‘Game of the Year’ Award
eatured in our top 10 games of 
2017, it looks like the Legend of 
Zelda: Breath of the Wild is better 
than expected. It beats out the likes 
of PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), 
Horizon Zero Dawn, Persona 5 and Super 
Mario Odyssey to take the ‘Game of the Year’ 
award at the 2017 Game Awards.
That isn’t the only award Zelda 
took home as it also won the award for 
‘Best Game Direction’ and ‘Best Action/
Adventure Game’. At the end of the night, 
Nintendo were the biggest winners as 
even Super Mario Odyssey attained many 
nominations as well as bagging the award 
for ‘Best Family Game’.
Cuphead also walked away with 
three awards for ‘Best Art Direction’, 
‘Best Debut Indie Game’ and also
