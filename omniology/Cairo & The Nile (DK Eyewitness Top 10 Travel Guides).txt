Cairo & the Nile‚Äôs Highlights
The Nile is synonymous with Egypt. Almost the entire population of the  
country is crammed onto the narrow fertile plain fringing the river. It was so 
during the ancient Egyptian era, when the temples and cities of the pharaohs 
rarely strayed far from the life-sustaining area of the Nile‚Äôs banks. Today, the 
best way to experience Egypt is to explore the Nile, from the awe-inspiring  
Pyramids on the outskirts of the capital of Cairo in the north, to the  
great temples in the far south of the country.

@ The Pyramids of Giza
The only survivor of the Seven 
Wonders of the Ancient World,  
the Great Pyramid and its two 
companions are no less wondrous 
now than they were when they  
were built four and a half  
millennia ago (see pp12‚Äì13).
$ Karnak
The mother of all ancient Egyptian temple 
complexes, Karnak was the powerbase of 
successive dynasties of pharaohs and the 
priesthood at the zenith of ancient Egypt‚Äôs 
military and artistic might (see pp16‚Äì19).
Luxor Temple
Once connected to 
Karnak by an avenue 
of sphinxes, Luxor is 
more modest in size 
than Karnak, but was 
built by two of the 
greatest pharaohs,  
Amenhotep III  
and Ramses II  
(see pp20‚Äì21).
% 
Mosque of Al-Azhar
In addition to the 
monuments of the pharaohs, 
Egypt has an unrivalled wealth of 
historic Islamic architecture 
stretching back to the 7th century. 
The Mosque of Al-Azhar in Cairo 
is one of the jewels of this 
heritage (see pp14‚Äì15).
¬£ 
Egyptian 
Museum
This is one of the 
world‚Äôs greatest  
museums, not least  
for the treasures in  
the Tutankhamun 
galleries, but for the 
exhibits from every 
period of ancient  
Egyptian history. It has 
been calculated that if a 
visitor were to spend just 
one minute at each item, it 
would take more than nine 
months to see everything 
(see pp8‚Äì11).

) Abu Simbel
This is perhaps  
the temple that best 
symbolizes the grandeur 
of ancient Egypt. The 
Sun Temple is carved 
out of a mountainside 
and fronted by four 
towering colossi 
of its builder, 
Ramses II  
(see pp30‚Äì31).
& Valley of the 
Kings
The treasures are long 
gone from the tombs of 
the pharaohs, but it is 
possible to descend the 
dimly-lit passageways to 
underground chambers 
decorated with vivid 
scenes from the afterlife 
(see pp24‚Äì5).
^ Temple of Hatshepsut
Among the many monuments at 
Luxor, the temple of Egypt‚Äôs only 
female pharaoh, Hatshepsut, stands 
out for its almost modernistic design of 
ascending terraces (see pp22‚Äì3).
Temple of Philae
A mix of Egyptian and 
Roman elements characterize 
this temple complex sited on a 
picturesque island in the middle 
of the Nile (see pp28‚Äì9).
( 
Cruising the Nile
When Cleopatra romanced 
Caesar she did so on a cruise 
down the Nile. It remains the 
most romantic and enjoyable way 
to view Egypt (see pp26‚Äì7).

Egyptian Museum
All of ancient Egyptian history is here, from the earliest Pharaonic artefact 
ever discovered to treasures from the era of Cleopatra, the last in a dynastic 
sequence of divine kings and queens stretching over three millennia. It is said 
that the museum displays more than 120,000 items, with at least that many 
again stored away out of sight in the basement. The real crowd pleasers are 
the treasures from Tutankhamun‚Äôs tomb, but there are many hundreds of 
other precious antiquities here of at least equal significance and beauty.

! The Museum 
Building
Egypt‚Äôs Ô¨Årst national 
museum of antiquities 
opened in 1863. It was 
rehoused in the current 
pink, purpose-built premises 
in 1902, which were 
designed in Neo-Classical 
style by French architect 
Marcel Dourgnon.
Central hall
The museum Ô¨Ålls up 
fast and it is best to 
arrive early to beat 
the worst of the 
crowds. There is an 
extra charge to take 
your camera inside.
There is a caf√© on  
the ground Ô¨Çoor 
overlooking the 
museum‚Äôs garden.

Galleries
Immediately to the left  
of the entrance hall, these 
galleries contain artefacts 
from the era of the  
Pyramid builders. Particularly 
beautiful are three slate 
triads each depicting 
Menkaure, builder of the 
smallest of the Giza 
pyramids, Ô¨Çanked by two 
goddesses (above).
@ Auguste Mariette
The Egyptologist 
Mariette, who discovered 
the Serapeum at Saqqara 
(see p40), was the founder 
of the Ô¨Årst national  
museum of antiquities  
in Egypt. His sarcophagus 
rests in the garden in  
front of the Egyptian 
Museum (below). 
¬£ Central Hall
The museum is on two 
Ô¨Çoors. On the lower Ô¨Çoor 
galleries are arranged in 
chronological order 
clockwise around a 
central hall dedicated 
to large statuary; this 
is also where you 
will Ô¨Ånd the 
Narmer Palette 
(see p10).

& Tutankhamun 
Galleries
Almost half of the upper 
Ô¨Çoor is devoted to some 
of the vast number of 
items excavated from 
the tomb of Egypt‚Äôs 
famed boy-king (left), 
which range from 
everyday items such 
as gaming sets and 
footstools to the giant 
gilded shrines and 
sarcophagi that Ô¨Åtted 
one inside the other 
like Russian dolls. 
) Ancient Egyptian 
Jewellery Rooms
These two rooms contain 
dazzling examples of 
royal jewellery from the 
New Kingdom period 
(left). Many of these 
items were discovered in 
1939 at Tanis, an ancient 
site in the Delta region.
% New Kingdom 
Galleries
This long gallery (see 
exhibit left) is devoted to 
the mightiest pharaohs, 
including Tuthmosis III, 
Amenhotep II and 
Ramses II, during whose 
rules Egypt expanded its 
borders south into what 
is now Sudan and north 
to the Euphrates.
^ Amarna Room
Room 3 contains 
pieces from Amarna, the 
short-lived capital of the 
‚Äúheretic king‚Äù Akhenaten 
(see pp35 & 107). His 
daughter, Princess Meri-
taten, is charac terized by 
an elongated face and full 
lips (below).
Goodbye Tut
A new Grand Egyptian 
Museum is currently 
under construction 
close to the Pyramids. 
When Ô¨Ånished in late 
2012 it will house 
many of the items 
currently displayed at 
the existing Egyptian 
Museum, including  
the treasures of 
Tutankhamun. The 
museum on Tahrir 
Square will remain 
open to the public as a 
collection of highlights, 
offering an introduction 
to the ancient Egyptian 
world of the pharaohs.
* The Royal 
Mummies
The desiccated bodies of 
some of Egypt‚Äôs mightiest 
rulers are displayed in two 
rooms on the upper Ô¨Çoor 
of the museum. Of the  
eleven royals present, the 
most famous are Seti I 
and his son Ramses II, 
whose colossi adorn a 
great many monuments  
in Upper Egypt.
( Animal Mummies
The ancient Egyptians 
mummiÔ¨Åed animals as 
well as people. This room 
on the upper Ô¨Çoor of the 
museum is full of animal 
mummies, from cats, 
mice and Ô¨Åsh to 
crocodiles, sacred to  
the god Sobek.

Narmer Palette
Dating from 3,000 BC, 
the Narmer Palette has 
been called the ‚ÄúÔ¨Årst historical 
document in the world‚Äù. It is a 
Ô¨Çat plate of greenish stone 
carved with designs that on one 
side show King Narmer (also 
$ 
Head of Nefertiti
The best-known bust 
of Nefertiti is held by  
the Berlin Museum but  
the unpainted quartzite 
sculpture displayed in  
the Amarna Room of the 
Egyptian Museum is  
also a masterpiece. 
Although unÔ¨Ånished,  
it is a magniÔ¨Åcent work and,  
in contrast to the almost gro-
tesque depictions of her husband, 
Akhenaten, the queen is shown 
as a wholly human beauty. 
# 
Statue of Ka-Aper
Egyptian art is not usually 
associated with realism, but  
so lifelike is this 5th-Dynasty 
wooden statue of the plump 
priest Ka-Aper that the workmen 
who discovered it at Saqqara in 
1860 nicknamed him Sheikh  
al-Balad (‚ÄúHead of the Village‚Äù) 
because of the resemblance to 
their own headman. The eyes  
are extraordinary and are 
outlined in copper with 
whites of opaque quartz 
and rock crystals as pupils.
! 
Prince Rahotep and His 
Wife Nofret
Dominating Room 32 in the  
Old Kingdom Galleries are the 
twin life-sized, limestone statues 
of two seated royals of the 4th 
Dynasty. The pair lived four and  
a half millennia ago, but the 
statues‚Äô small details, such 
as the princess‚Äôs real 
fringe poking out from 
under her wig and her 
elegant white dress, bring 
them back to life. The 
statues were discovered 
by the museum‚Äôs founder, 
Mariette, at Meidum  
in 1871.
Statues of Prince Rahotep and Nofret
Sculpture of the 
head of Nefertiti
known as Menes) wearing the 
White Crown of Upper Egypt  
and on the reverse, wearing  
the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. 
Historians interpret this to 
represent the uniÔ¨Åcation of the 
two main tribes of Egypt under 
one ruler, making Narmer the 
founder of the 1st Dynasty and 
Ô¨Årst king of all Egypt. This is 
when ancient Egypt started.

Some of these items may be transferred to the new Grand Egyptian 
Museum under construction at Giza, due to open in late 2012.

Middle Kingdom Models
Several rooms on the west 
wing of the upper Ô¨Çoor contain 
Ô¨Ånely detailed models from the 
11th Dynasty. These include 
& 
Tutankhamun‚Äôs Death 
Mask
In a museum full of magniÔ¨Åcence, 
the life-sized gold death mask of 
Tutankhamun remains the show 
stopper and the most famous 
example of ancient Egyptian craft-
manship. It originally covered the 
head of the mummy and is an 
idealized portrait of the pharaoh. 
The gold of the headdress is 
interspersed with lapis lazuli and 
topped by a cobra that spits at 
the pharaoh‚Äôs enemies.
) 
Fayoum Portraits
In Room 14 on the Ô¨Årst Ô¨Çoor 
are these life-like portraits dating 
from the period of Roman rule  
in Egypt (30 BC‚Äì395 AD). They 
represent some of the world‚Äôs 
earliest portraiture. Painted on 
wooden boards during the 
subject‚Äôs lifetime, they were at 
death laid over the face of the 
mummiÔ¨Åed corpse before it was 
placed into its sarcophagus.
% 
Statuette of Khufu 
(Cheops)
Ironically, the only portrait  
of the builder of the famed  
Great Pyramid at Giza, the  
4th-Dynasty king, Khufu, is a 
tiny ivory statuette just 7 cm 
(3 inches) high. It depicts the 
king sitting on his throne 
wearing a long robe and the 
crown of Lower Egypt and 
was found in a temple at 
Abydos in Middle Egypt.  
It now sits on its own in  
a cabinet in Room 37.
^ 
Tutankhamun‚Äôs Lion 
Throne
There are around 1,700  
items in the galleries 
devoted to the treasures of 
Tutankhamun. It is easy to 
be overwhelmed, but don‚Äôt miss 
the Lion Throne. Its wooden 
frame is wrapped in sheets  
of gold and silver inlaid with 
semiprecious stones, fa√Øence 
and coloured glass. On the back 
of the throne the young king sits 
under the rays of Aten (the sun) 
in a style derived from Amarna.

The Pyramids of Giza
Despite centuries of study, the Pyramids remain a mystery. There‚Äôs their age: 
we are closer in time to the era of Jesus Christ than he was to the Pyramids. 
There‚Äôs their size: for 4,000 years the Great Pyramid remained the tallest man- 
made structure ever built. There‚Äôs the how: the Pyramids are precisely placed, 
their sides aligning to true north with only 3/60th a degree of error, while 
certain internal air shafts line up perfectly with celestial constellations. And, of 
course, there‚Äôs the why: merely tombs for pharaohs or something much more?

# Pyramid of Khufu 
(Cheops)
Also known simply as the 
Great Pyramid, this is the 
tallest and oldest of the trio. 
It was built during the reign 
of Khufu (2589‚Äì2566 BC) 
and originally stood 140 m 
(460 ft) high and measured 
230 m (750 ft) along its base. 
These measurements are 
less now due to the removal 
of the outer casing of stone.
! Giza Plateau
Around 2600 BC the 
rocky Giza plateau (above) 
became the burial ground 
(necropolis) for Memphis, 
then the capital of Egypt. In 
less than a century during 
the Old Kingdom three 
successive generations built 
the three great Pyramids 
and associated structures.
The Sphinx
Its age is a point of 
contention, but the 
traditional view is that the 
Sphinx (right) was sculpted 
around 2500 BC by Khafre 
and that it is his face ‚Äì 
now minus a nose ‚Äì that 
fronts the leonine body. It 
also once had a beard, and 
parts of this are now in the 
Egyptian Museum and  
the British Museum.

% Pyramid of 
Menkaure 
(Mycerinus)
This pyramid‚Äôs base area 
is less than a quarter of 
that of the other two, but 
its temples are more 
elaborate. This is perhaps 
a sign of the waning 
power of the pharaoh as 
well as a shift in priorities 
in funerary architecture.
$ Pyramid of Khafre 
(Chephren)
Slightly smaller than 
Khufu‚Äôs pyramid, the 
Pyramid of Khafre often 
seems bigger by virtue of 
being sited on higher 
ground. Its summit retains 
the smooth limestone 
casing that originally 
covered the whole of  
the three pyramids. 
* Khafre‚Äôs Valley 
Temple
Each pyramid was part of 
a greater funerary complex 
beginning with a valley 
temple. The remains of 
that of Khafre (below) are 
near the Sphinx.
^ Solar Boat 
Museum
A pod-shaped structure by 
the Great Pyramid contains 
a full-size ancient Egyptian 
boat (above), recovered 
from a pit sunk around 
the pyramid. It may have 
been intended to allow 
the pharaoh to accompany 
the sun-god on his daily 
journey across the 
heavens, hence the name. 
Pyramid Evolution
The Ô¨Årst tombs were 
mastabas (low, Ô¨Çat-
topped buildings). The 
Ô¨Årst pyramid, Djoser‚Äôs 
Stepped Pyramid at 
Saqqara, was formed of 
six mastabas on top of 
each other. The Ô¨Årst 
smooth-sided pyramid 
(at Meidum on the edge 
of the Fayoum Oasis) 
was achieved by Ô¨Ålling 
in the steps of a 
stepped pyramid. The 
next stage was purpose- 
built smooth-sided 
pyramids, prototyped  
at Dahshur (see p91).
( Camel Rides
Local entrepreneurs 
offer camel rides near the 
Pyramids (above). The site 
is small enough that you 
don‚Äôt need a ride but it can 
be fun. Be prepared to 
haggle hard over the price.
) Sound and 
Light Show

Mosque of Al-Azhar
Al-Azhar was founded in AD 970 as the city‚Äôs main mosque and centre  
of learning and to this day its institutions remain central to religious and 
political life in Egypt. Al-Azhar University is still one of the most revered 
centres of learning in the Sunni Islamic world, although teaching has long 
since left the mosque and now takes place in several modern campuses 
around the country. The mosque is a favourite venue for political 
demonstrations, often of an anti-government nature, particularly following 
noon prayers on a Friday.

arched gate (below), dating 
from the 15th century, 
where students traditionally 
had their heads shaved, 
hence the name. 
¬£ Courtyard
Al-Azhar Mosque  
has undergone a series  
of enlargements and 
restorations throughout its 
history, and all styles and 
periods of history are 
represented in its archi-
tecture. The courtyard (sahn) 
is one of the oldest parts 
(main image). Its arcades 
are carried on salvaged  
pre-Islamic columns.
The Madrassas
Inside the main gate 
are two madrassas (places 
of religious study) dating 
from the early 14th century 
(right). The madrassa on 
the left is usually open and 
has a beautiful ornate mihrab 
(niche indicating the direction 
of prayer towards Mecca).

composed of hundreds 
of minarets. The most 
beautiful of these, 
largely dating from the 
Mamluk period (1250‚Äì
1517), have stonework 
adorned with intricate 
decorative carving.

Karnak
Even more so than the Pyramids of Giza, Karnak is Egypt‚Äôs most important 
Pharaonic site. Throughout the Middle and New Kingdom eras, when ancient 
Egypt was at its pinnacle, Karnak was the country‚Äôs powerbase. It was the 
home of the gods and the seat of the pharaoh and the priestly ruling caste. 
For over 1,300 years the complex was constantly expanded, and its scale is 
immense, incorporating countless courts, halls and temples. Almost every 
pharaoh of note has left their mark.

@ Precinct of Amun
The Karnak complex has 
three main compounds. The 
grandest precinct, dedicated 
to Amun, lies at the centre, 
dominated by the huge 
Temple of Amun. It contains 
a Sacred Lake and a  
series of pylons arranged 
perpendicular to the main 
temple. The pylons lead to 
the adjacent Precinct of Mut, 
which is closed to visitors.
! Avenue of Sphinxes
The site is approached 
via a short avenue of 
sphinxes (above) that 
originally connected the 
entrance pylon with a dock 
fed by a canal from the 
Nile. On the south side of 
Karnak is another partial 
sphinx avenue, which once 
connected with Luxor 
Temple (see pp20‚Äì21).
¬£ Temple of Amun
The heart of Karnak  
is the Temple of Amun 
(below), spanning thirteen 
centuries. The scale is vast, 
consisting of a succession 
of pylons, courts, colonnades 
and chambers arranged along 
a central axis (see pp18‚Äì19).

% Temple of Khonsu
This small temple in 
the Precinct of Amun, 
dedicated to the son of 
Amun, was mostly built 
by Ramses II and IV.  
Next to it is a smaller 
temple to Opet, the 
hippopotamus goddess.
^ Sacred Lake
Priests puriÔ¨Åed 
themselves in the holy 
water of the Sacred Lake 
(below) before performing 
rituals in the temple. 
Nearby is a giant stone 
scarab of Khepri, god of 
the dawning sun.
* Seventh and 
Eighth Pylons
A succession of courts 
and pylons runs south 
from the Cachette Court. 
The Ô¨Årst of these, the 
Seventh Pylon, is 
ascribed to Tuthmosis III, 
and two partial colossi of 
him sit in the courtyard 
beyond. The well-preserved 
Eighth Pylon was probably 
constructed during the 
reign of Hatshepsut.
The Theban Triad
The three dominant 
Egyptian gods in the 
area of Thebes (modern-
day Luxor) were Amun, 
the all-powerful god to 
whom Karnak is 
dedicated, his consort 
Mut and their son 
Khonsu. Together they 
form the Theban triad. 
Mut was said to swallow 
the sun in the evening 
(sunset) and to give 
birth to it again in the 
morning (sunrise).
& Cachette Court
The Cachette Court 
gets its name from the 
discovery of a hoard of 
some 900 stone statues 
here, the Ô¨Ånest of which 
are now in the Luxor and 
Cairo museums. 
( Precinct of Montu
The warrior god Montu 
was the god of Karnak. His 
precinct, north of that of 
Amun, contains temples 
to both Montu and Amun. 
Both temples are currently 
closed to the public.
Open-Air 
Museum
Situated within the 
Precinct of Amun, the 
museum contains a Ô¨Åne 
collection of statuary 
(right) and monuments 
discovered during an 
excavation of the Third 
Pylon of the Temple of 
Amun. A separate ticket is 
required for the museum.

each have niches at the rear that 
would once have contained 
statues of the deities.

1,700 years later the Byzantine

The Temple Priests
Ancient Egyptian priests, such as those of Karnak, 
were known as ‚Äúhem-netjer‚Äù, literally ‚Äúservants of the 
god or goddess‚Äù, responsible for performing the daily 
rituals that regulated the workings of the universe. 
The high priest was responsible for the honouring of 
the god within its shrine. Twice daily the ‚Äúcult‚Äù statue 
was bathed and clothed before receiving offerings of 
food and drink. Incense was burnt and holy water from 
the Sacred Lake scattered to show the purity of the 
offerings. Priests were not necessarily wholly religious ‚Äì 
some were teachers; others attended to the economic 
organization of the temple. Although the Temple of 
Amun was the residence of the god, it also included 
workshops, libraries and administrative areas.

Luxor Temple
Set close to the bank of the Nile and in the centre of the modern town, Luxor 
Temple is quite literally unmissable. It is an elegant, compact complex, as unlike 
Karnak, it is largely the work of a single pharaoh, Amenhotep III, with just a 
few additions made during the reign of Ramses II. The site was occupied by  
a Roman camp in the 3rd century AD but was subsequently abandoned and 
became engulfed in silt and sand on top of which a village was built. It 
remained thus until the late 19th century when excavations began.

was originally one of a pair 
but the other was removed 
in the early 19th century 
and re-erected in the Place 
de la Concorde, Paris, as a 
gift to France.
! Avenue of Sphinxes
Leading to the temple 
is a procession of sphinxes 
(above) that once ran from 
here to the Precinct of Mut 
at Karnak. Almost all of the 
route was deeply buried 
under the modern town but 
is slowly being uncovered.
¬£ First Pylon
The entrance is a 24-m 
(79-ft) high pylon (main 
image), added by Ramses II, 
which serves as a poster for 
his achievements. It is 
decorated with scenes of 
his military triumphs, such 
as the Battle of Qadesh.

The Opet Festival
Once a year during  
the Ô¨Çood season,  
the Festival of Opet 
celebrated the 
pharaoh‚Äôs rebirth as  
the son of Amun. 
Images of the Theban 
Triad (see p17) were 
carried from Karnak on 
boats (barques) to 
Luxor Temple. Luxor 
stages a recreation  
of the festival in 
November each year 
(check dates with the 
tourist ofÔ¨Åce on 095

The southern side of 
Amenhotep‚Äôs Ô¨Åne court 
merges into a hypostyle 
hall with 32 more papyrus 
columns. Between the 
last two columns to the 
left of the central aisle is 
a Roman altar dedicated 
to Emperor Constantine.
) Inner Sanctum
The heart of the temple is the Sanctuary of the 
Sacred Barque, where Amun‚Äôs barque ended its 
journey from Karnak during the annual Opet Festival. 
Beyond this is a small damaged sanctuary that once 
housed a golden statue of Amun.

Beyond the Hypostyle 
Hall are a series of small 
antechambers. In the Ô¨Årst

Temple of Hatshepsut
This is the most intriguing of the temples and tombs on Luxor‚Äôs West Bank, 
partly due to the breathtaking spectacle it presents ‚Äì a series of sweeping 
terraces set against a vertiginous mountain backdrop ‚Äì and partly because 
the temple was built for the only woman to reign over Egypt as pharaoh. 
When her husband Tuthmosis II died young, Hatshepsut became regent to 
her step-son Tuthmosis III, later usurping him altogether to take the crown  
for herself. She reigned from 1473 until 1458 BC.

Valley of the Kings
During the greatest period of ancient Egyptian history almost every pharaoh was 
buried here in tombs hewn into the rock and decorated with extraordinary art. To 
date, 63 tombs have been discovered and there may still be more to come, 
making this the richest archaeological site on earth. The numbers assigned to the 
tombs (given here in brackets) represent the order in which they were discovered, 
but a better way to approach the valley is to visit the tombs in the order in which 
they were constructed, as they are presented here. In this way it is possible to

@ Amenhotep II (No.35)
This is one of the 
deepest tombs in the 
valley, with 90 steps 
leading down to the various 
chambers. Amenhotep II 
ruled immediately after 
Tuthmosis III and this  
tomb has similarly basic 
wall paintings, as well as 
containing Amenhotep‚Äôs 
sarcophagus.
! Tuthmosis III (No.34)
Tuthmosis III was one  
of the Ô¨Årst pharaohs to be 
buried in the valley. His 
tomb is at the furthest end, 
burrowed high into the 
mountainside in an attempt 
to thwart thieves. The tomb 
decorations from this 
period are very crude, with  
Ô¨Ågures rendered as stick 
people (above).
¬£ Tutankhamun (No.62)
This is a very small tomb 
(main image), but it is one of 
the most visited thanks to 
the story of its discovery by 
Howard Carter (see opposite). 
All of the treasures have been 
removed and visitors must 
be content with seeing the 
king‚Äôs mummy, which lies 
inside a gilded cofÔ¨Ån.
$ Horemheb (No.57)
The introduction of bas-
relief in this tomb, in which 
Ô¨Ågures are carved out before 
painting, shows an advance 
in tomb art (above). Not all 
Ô¨Ågures are Ô¨Ånished and it is 
fascinating to see the work in 
various stages of completion.

^ Seti I (No.17)
If you visit only one 
tomb, it should be this  
one ‚Äì the longest, deepest 
and most lavishly decorated 
tomb in the valley. The 
vaulted burial chamber 
boasts a beautiful ceiling, 
showing the constellations 
surrounded by a line-up 
of deities (below).
( Ramses IV (No.2)
Ramses III was  
the last of the great 
pharaohs. The quality of 
the craftsmanship in the  
tomb of his successor is 
noticeably poorer than 
those that came before.
Wonderful Things
Archaeologist Howard 
Carter had been digging 
in the Valley of the Kings 
for Ô¨Åve seasons. His 
backer Lord Carnarvon 
was on the point of 
stopping the funding 
when on 4 November 
1922 Carter discovered 
some steps. Three weeks 
later the pair broke 
through a second sealed 
door that allowed Carter 
to peer through into an 
undisturbed tomb. 
Asked by Carnarvon if  
he could see anything, 
Carter replied, ‚ÄúYes, 
wonderful things‚Äù.
* Ramses III (No.11)
This is also known as 
the ‚ÄúTomb of the Harpists‚Äù 
after the bas-relief of two 
musicians. Unusually for 
a royal tomb, its colourful 
reliefs include scenes of 
everyday Egyptian life.
&  Merneptah (No.8)
One of the many 
sons of Ramses II, 
Merneptah‚Äôs tomb almost 
equals that of Seti I for 
grandeur. This is the Ô¨Årst 
tomb in which the axis is 
completely straight, 
terminating in a tomb 
chamber containing the 
pharaoh‚Äôs magniÔ¨Åcent 
granite sarcophagus.
Ramses VI (No.9)
This tomb has very 
dense decoration (right), 
representing sacred texts 
and imagery, central to 
which is the voyage of 
the sun god Ra through 
the underworld and his 
victorious reemergence 
in the morning.

% Ramses I (No.16)
Ramses I ruled only for a single year and his 
tomb is correspondingly modest in size. It has the 
shortest entrance corridor in the valley leading to a 
small burial chamber. However, the colours of the 
tomb paintings remain particularly vibrant (above).

Cruising the Nile
After disembarking their ocean liner at Alexandria, the 19th-century tourist 
would board a train for Cairo where they would hire a boat at the port of 
Bulaq. They would then make their way in a leisurely fashion down the Nile 
stopping off at each archaeological site along the way. The journey would 
take about 10 days, ending at Aswan, where a cataract rendered any further 
progress south impossible. That same journey cannot be made today, but a 
four- or seven-day cruise stopping at the major monuments of Upper  
(southern) Egypt remains by far the best way to experience the country.

The number and 
variety of boats is 
overwhelming and it 
is advisable to do 
some research before 
booking. Itineraries 
are generally the 
same and the differ-
ences between 
cruisers lie in the 
quality of service and 
facilities on board.
All meals are usually 
included in the cost 
of the package but 
alcoholic drinks are 
put on a tab that has 
to be settled at the 
end of the cruise.
# The Boats
There are over 300 cruise boats on the Nile (below), 
varying in size from those with just a handful of cabins to 
vessels capable of carrying several hundred people. Nearly 
all have air-conditioned cabins with en-suite bathrooms.
! The Route
Since the 1980s boats 
no longer sail through 
Middle Egypt. All departures 
are from Luxor, taking 
three days to reach Aswan 
and then turning around to 
make the return journey.
@ The Itinerary
As well as the sites at 
Luxor and Aswan, cruises all 
stop at Esna, Edfu and 
Kom Ombo, each of which 
has a Pharaonic temple. 
Full-day excursions are 
typically offered to Abu 
Simbel on Lake Nasser.

the Nile see p133

( Death on the Nile
Agatha Christie‚Äôs 
1937 murder mystery is 
recommended reading on 
a Nile cruise as it takes 
place on board a Nile 
steamer and at the 
Pharaonic sites of Upper 
Egypt. It was written in 
part during a stay at 
Aswan‚Äôs Old Cataract 
Hotel (see pp53 &131).
^ Dahabiyyas
The most exclusive 
option is a berth on a 
dahabiyya (below), a 
newly-built replica of the 
twin-sail boat that used 
to cruise the Nile in the 
19th century. Each carries 
between 5 and 20 people 
in Ô¨Åve-star comfort.
% Steamers
These were the boats 
that cruised the Nile  
in the early years of the 
20th century. Now 
meticulously restored, 
they provide a more 
characterful, though still 
affordable, option than 
the standard Nile cruiser.
& Life On Board
Most cruise packages 
include an Egyptologist, 
who delivers lectures on 
ancient Egyptian history 
and acts as a guide on 
visits to the monuments. 
Parties and folkloric 
events are organized as 
evening entertainment.
Thomas Cook  
& Son
The popularization of 
Nile cruising, and of 
mass tourism to Egypt, 
is largely due to John 
Mason Cook, son of 
Thomas Cook. In the 
1880s Cooks Ltd began 
tours to Egypt and 
invested heavily in the 
country‚Äôs infrastructure 
and marketing. They had 
a network of ‚Äútourist 
stations‚Äù along the Nile 
offering conveniences 
from hotels to post 
ofÔ¨Åces to doctors. 
$ Feluccas
The cheapest way 
of sailing the Nile is to 
charter one of the 
small single-sailed 
boats that scud about 
the river (left). These 
are hired in Aswan, 
usually for a three-day, 
two-night journey to 
Edfu. Sleeping 
arrangements are a 
blanket and you bring 
your own provisions.
) Cruising Lake 
Nasser
As an alternative to the 
Nile cruise, a number of 
boats cruise Lake Nasser, 
sailing from moorings at 
the High Dam, south of 
Aswan, to the great 
Temple of Abu Simbel, 
and stopping at several 
little-visited desert 
temples en route.
Life on the Nile
Part of the appeal 
of a cruise is the 
opportunity to observe 
rural life on the shores 
of the river (right) ‚Äì 
water buffalo bathing 
in the shallows, villagers 
at work in the cane 
Ô¨Åelds and an abundance 
of water birds.

Roman) era temple is devoted to Isis, whose cult was to survive into early 
Christian times. After the building of the Aswan Dam (1898‚Äì1902), the 
island‚Äôs temples were submerged for a part of each year. With the building  
of the High Dam (1969‚Äì71), the temples were relocated to nearby Agilika 
Island, which was landscaped to match the original site.

¬£ Temple of Isis
The centrepiece of Philae 
is this beautiful, small temple 
built over several hundred 
years by Ptolemaic and 
Roman rulers (main image 
and below). It is fronted by 
an ancient Egyptian pylon 
and two stone lions.
! Kiosk of Nectanebo
Boats drop visitors  
at a double stairway that 
leads up to the Kiosk of 
Nectanebo (above), a 
small structure erected 
during the 4th century BC 
that acts as a gateway  
to the site.
@ Colonnaded 
Courtyard
Beyond the kiosk is an 
elongated courtyard Ô¨Çanked 
by colonnades. The west 
colonnade (to the left) has 
columns on which every 
capital is different and a 
rear wall punctuated by 
windows overlooking the 
water. The east colonnade 
is interrupted by a series of 
ruined structures.
$ The Sanctuary
Beyond a second pylon, 
a hypostyle hall leads to 
vestibules that culminate in 
the innermost holy sanctuary, 
containing a stone pedestal 
that once supported the 
goddess Isis‚Äôs barque.

% The Birth House
The colonnaded Birth 
House (left) is where the 
pharaohs legitimized  
their rule as mortal 
descendants of Horus by 
taking part in rituals 
celebrating the god‚Äôs 
birth. At the bottom of 
the rear wall are scenes 
of Isis giving birth to 
Horus in the marshes.
* Temple of Hathor
East of the main 
building is a small, ruinous 
temple, which still has 
two columns topped with 
Hathor heads, as well as 
a Ô¨Åne relief depicting 
musicians with the dwarf 
god Bess playing a harp.
( Kiosk of Trajan
This imposing kiosk 
(below) was built around 
AD 100 by the Roman 
emperor Trajan and served 
as a royal landing for the 
temple. It combines 
Roman architecture with 
Pharaonic detailing.
^ The Osiris Rooms
If the caretaker can be 
persuaded to unlock the 
way (with a tip), some 
upper rooms with reliefs 
depicting the resurrection 
of Osiris after his 
dismemberment by Seth 
(see p37) can be visited.
The Cult of Isis
Isis was the goddess of 
magic, and no ancient 
Egyptian cult lasted 
longer or spread further 
than hers. She became 
identiÔ¨Åed with women, 
sex and purity, and  
Isis worship spread 
throughout the Roman 
empire, with her cult 
temples appearing as 
far as what is now 
Hungary. For the Ô¨Årst 
two centuries of 
Christianity‚Äôs history, 
Isis was Christianity‚Äôs 
main rival. It is possible 
that Christianity‚Äôs cult of 
the Virgin was nurtured 
as a way of winning 
over Isis worshippers.

Lake Nasser was 
formed with the completion 
of the High Dam in 1971. 
The water stretches south 
of the dam for nearly  
500 km (300 miles) into 
Sudan. With a surface area 
of 6,000 sq km (3,700 sq 
miles) the lake is the  
world‚Äôs largest reservoir.
¬£ The Colossi
Ramses II had his 
temple adorned with four 
gigantic colossi fashioned

% Hypostyle Hall Reliefs
The southern wall of the Hypostyle Hall depicts 
the Battle of Qadesh (c.1275 BC) (above), in which 
the pharaoh leads his army in a defeat of the Hittites 
on the River Orontes in what is now Syria.
& Inner Sanctuary
A second pillared hall 
leads to a sanctuary at 
the rear of the temple, 
where there are four 
statues representing 
Ptah, Ramses II, Amun-
Ra and Ra-Harakhty.
Rescue by 
UNESCO
In the 1960s, as the 
rising waters of Lake 
Nasser threatened to 
engulf the temples at 
Abu Simbel, UNESCO 
engineers cut them from 
the mountain in sections 
and reassembled the 
pieces to front an 
artiÔ¨Åcial mountain 210 m 
(700 ft) behind and 65 m 
(213 ft) above their 
original position.
* The Sun Ceremony
The Sun Temple  
is aligned so that on  
22 February and on  
22 October every year  
(traditionally considered 
Ramses‚Äô birthday

respectively), the Ô¨Årst 
rays of the rising sun 
illuminate the sanctuary 
cult statues of Amun-Ra, 
Ra-Harakhty and Ramses

shadow (see p62).
( Temple of Hathor
Beside the Sun Temple 
is a temple dedicated to 
the goddess Hathor, built 
by Ramses II to honour 
his wife Nefertari (below). 
The fa√ßade alternates 
colossi of the pharaoh  
and his queen. Inside is  
a hypostyle hall with 
Hathor-headed pillars.

Periods of Ancient Egyptian History
! 
Early Dynastic Period 
(3100‚Äì2890 BC)
There is evidence of human 
activity in the Western 
Desert as far back as  
8000 BC, but what we regard 
as ancient Egypt began in 
3100 BC with the uniÔ¨Åcation 
of Upper (southern) and 
Lower (northern) Egypt by 
King Narmer (also known  
as Menes), who created  
a capital at Memphis.
$ 
Middle Kingdom 
(2055‚Äì1650 BC)
The powerful warlord 
Montuhotep II conquered 
the north to reunite the 
country with Thebes 
(modern-day Luxor) as its 
new capital, which grew 
into a major metropolis. 
Across the river, the Ô¨Årst tombs  
and funerary temples were 
constructed at the foot of  
the Theban Hills on the  
west bank of the Nile.
@ 
Old Kingdom 
(2686‚Äì2181 BC)
Also known as the Age of 
the Pyramids, successive 
dynasties of kings raised a  
chain of pyramids, the greatest 
of which were the trio at Giza 
(see pp12‚Äì13). Subsequently, 
poor harvests depleted the royal 
coffers, which led to a decline  
in royal power, signiÔ¨Åed by a 
decrease in the size of pyramids. 
¬£ 
First Intermediate Period 
(2181‚Äì2055 BC)
During this unstable period of 
ancient Egyptian history there 
were numerous ephemeral 
% 
Second Intermediate 
Period (1650‚Äì1550 BC)
Migrants from lands north of 
Egypt, referred to as Hyksos, 
assumed control and allied with 
Nubia to dominate southern 
Egypt. The country became 
subject to intermittent civil war.
^ 
New Kingdom 
(1550‚Äì1069 BC)
With the reuniÔ¨Åcation of north 
and south and the expulsion of 
the Hyksos, Egypt entered a 
Golden Age, expanding its rule 
into Asia Minor and as far as the 
Euphrates. Captured treasures 
enriched the royal powerbase at 
Karnak, seat of the mightiest 
pharaohs including Ramses II.

& 
Third Intermediate Period 
(1069‚Äì715 BC)
The New Kingdom gave way to 
four centuries of disunity and 
foreign inÔ¨Åltration, with Egypt 
again divided into north (ruled 
from Tanis in the Delta) and 
south (ruled by the priests of 
Karnak) and subject to invasion 
by Libyans and Nubians.
* 
Late Period (747‚Äì332 BC)
The Late Period began with 
the Assyrian invasion of 
Egypt, followed by the 
Persians in 525 BC. 
The Persians ruled for  
200 years interrupted 
only by the short-lived 
30th Dynasty of 
Egyptian pharaohs 
(380‚Äì343 BC), the last 
native rulers until the 
Revolution of 1952.
( 
Graeco-Roman 
Period (332‚Äì30 BC)
In 332 BC the 
Macedonian king 
Alexander the Great 
‚Äúliberated‚Äù Egypt 
from the Persians 
and founded his new capital, 
Alexandria, on the Mediterranean. 
He was succeeded by his trusted 
general Ptolemy, who founded a 
dynasty that ruled for 275 years 
ending with the dramatic death 
of the last of the Ptolemies, 
Cleopatra VII, lover of Julius 
Caesar and Marc Antony.
) 
After the Pharaohs
With the defeat and suicide 
of Cleopatra in 30 BC, Egypt 
became part of the Roman 
empire. It remained under the 
rule of Rome, followed by that of 
Constantinople, capital of the 
Eastern Roman empire, until the 
arrival of conquering Arab  
armies in AD 640.

and death, order and chaos ‚Äì 
held in a state of equilibrium by 
the goddess Maat. To maintain 
this balance they built enormous 
temples dedicated to the gods.

Mummification
The earliest mummies 
were probably accidental. 
True mummiÔ¨Åcation began 
in the Fourth Dynasty. 
Special priests Ô¨Årst 
removed the internal 
organs, which were stored 
in canopic jars, except for 
the heart, which remained 
in place to be weighed in 
the afterlife. Then the corpse was 
dried out and wrapped in linen.

The Cult Temple
At the centre of every 
settlement was a cult 
temple. These temples 
served as a storehouse of 
divine power, maintained by the 
priests. The temple was also an 
economic and political centre 
employing large numbers of  
the local community and  
serving as a town hall, medical 
centre and college.
% 
Burial Traditions
The ancient Egyptians 
believed in an eternal after- 
life and they developed a 
complex funerary cult aimed  
at maintaining their life after 
death. This involved preserving 
the body through a process of 
mummiÔ¨Åcation. The tombs of  
the deceased were also stocked 
with everything that might be 
needed in the afterlife.

% Isis
Daughter of Geb, god of 
the Earth, and of Nut, Isis is 
the goddess of magic, whose 
cult centre was at Philae.
^ Nut
Goddess of the sky and a 
symbol of resurrection and 
rebirth, Nut was pictured as 
arched on her toes with her 
Ô¨Ångertips over the earth. 
& Osiris
God of the Underworld 
who granted all life, including 
the fertile Ô¨Çooding of the  
Nile River.
* Ra
Pre-eminent form of the 
sun god, portrayed as a 
falcon-headed Ô¨Ågure with the 
sun‚Äôs disc resting on his head.
( Seth
The god of the desert, 
storms and chaos is depicted 
with the head of an unknown 
creature with a curved snout 
and square ears.
) Thoth
Ibis-headed god of 
wisdom and patron of scribes.
) 
Osiris and Isis
Osiris was murdered by his 
jealous brother Seth, who cut up 
the body scattering it all over 
Egypt. Osiris‚Äôs wife Isis collected 
up the pieces and put him back 
together again as the Ô¨Årst 
mummy. Brought back to life, 
Osiris became lord and judge  
of the dead.
* 
Mythology
Ancient Egyptian religion 
was a complex belief system 
involving a great number of 
deities originally based on aspects 
of the natural world. Over time 
different localities developed 
many and varied myths relating 
to their own deities.
( 
The Creation Myth
In the beginning there was 
nothing but the sea of chaos, 
named Nun. Then Atum thought 
himself into being, sneezing to 
create Shu and Tefnut. Shu and 
Tefnut gave birth to two children: 
Geb, the earth, and Nut, the sky, 
who in turn gave birth to the stars.
Tomb painting of the gods Osiris and Atum
were used to decorate the tomb. 
These included scenes from the 
Book of the Dead, which 
contained instructions to help 
the deceased to pass safely 
through obstacles in the afterlife.

Temple of Horus, Edfu
Situated between Luxor and 
Aswan, the Temple of Horus at 
Edfu dates from 237 BC, when 
Egypt was ruled by the successors 
of Alexander the Great. These 
rulers copied earlier temples, 
preserving the architectural 
traditions of their Pharaonic 
predecessors, as can be seen in 
this vast structure, the most intact 
of all Egypt‚Äôs temples (see p107). 
# 
Medinat Habu
Second in size only to 
Karnak, Medinat Habu was built 
by Ramses III in Thebes. It is 
dominated by the vast mortuary 
temple of Ramses III, modelled 
on Ramses II‚Äôs Ramesseum. The 
complex also includes the remains 
of Ramses‚Äôs royal paIace. Often 
overlooked by tourists, this 
magniÔ¨Åcent and haunting structure 
is deÔ¨Ånitely worth a visit (see p100).
@ 
Temple of Seti I, Abydos
Built during Seti I‚Äôs reign 
(1294‚Äì1279 BC), this is one of 
the most intact temples in  
Egypt and has some of the  
Ô¨Ånest decoration and bas-reliefs, 
many of which have retained 
their original colour. It is  
situated in Abydos, which was 
once a huge walled town and  
the cult centre of Osiris (god of 
the dead) and was regarded as 
the holiest of Egyptian towns  
in Pharaonic times. Due to its 
distance from the main  
tourist centres, it is a less  
visited site (see p107).
! 
Ramesseum
Ramses II, ruler of Egypt in 
the 19th Dynasty, built his 
mortuary temple, the 
Ramesseum, on the west bank 
of the Nile at Thebes as a 
statement of his everlasting 
greatness and to impress his 
subjects. Although there is very 
little left standing of the huge 
complex, what remains is still 
striking. It once had an 18-m  
(60-ft) high colossus of Ramses, 
parts of which now lie scattered 
around the site (see p100).

Karnak
As well as being Egypt‚Äôs 
most magniÔ¨Åcent temple 
complex, Karnak is also one of 
Egypt‚Äôs oldest Pharaonic sites. It 
started with humble beginnings 
during the 11th Dynasty, and was 
added to and expanded by every 
pharaoh over the course of  
1,300 years until the 20th Dynasty. 
It contains many different courts, 
halls and temples. At the heart of 
the vast complex lies the Temple 
of Amun, dedicated to the king of 
gods (see pp16‚Äì19). 
* 
Temple of Hatshepsut
Hatshepsut was Egypt‚Äôs  
only female pharaoh and her 
mortuary temple at Deir al-Bahri 
in Thebes was designed by her 
architect Senenmut in the  
18th Dynasty. Partly hewn out of 
rock, it rises from the desert 
plain in a series of striking 
terraces. It is extraordinary in 
appearance and unlike any other 
surviving ancient Egyptian 
structure (see pp22‚Äì3).
( 
Philae
Centre of the cult of Isis, 
Philae is a comparatively late 
temple complex, dating from the 
Graeco-Roman period. It is a 
favourite with visitors thanks to a 
beautiful location on its own 
island in the Nile (see pp28‚Äì9). 
% 
Dendara
Due to its location a little  
off the normal tourist trail near 
Qena, Dendara receives far 
fewer visitors than it deserves. 
Like the temple at Edfu, the 
temple at Dendara dates from 
the Graeco-Roman era. Dedicated 
to the goddess Hathor, it is 
remarkably well preserved and 
imitates typical Pharaonic temple 
architecture (see p107).
) 
Abu Simbel
Ramses II (1279‚Äì1213 BC) 
built the spectacular Sun Temple 
at Abu Simbel. Due to the four 
colossi carved in his image that 
front the temple, he is the most 
famous of all pharaohs, with  
the exception perhaps of 
Tutankhamun (see pp30‚Äì31).

Luxor Temple
Begun by Amenhotep III in 
the 18th Dynasty and added to 
by Ramses II in the 19th

perfect example of ancient 
Egyptian temple architecture. 
Located in the centre of modern 
Luxor town, it is easily 
accessible (see pp20‚Äì21).

 The Mosque 
 Egypt‚Äôs oldest mosque, the 
Mosque of Amr (see p84), was 
built in AD 640. Architectural 
styles developed rapidly under 
successive early Islamic dynasties 
to peak under the Mamluks 
(1250‚Äì1516), when craftsmen 
from all over the Near East were 
brought to Egypt to build for 
vainglorious sultans, with often 
remarkable results that rival 
Europe‚Äôs great Gothic cathedrals.

 Domes and Minarets 
 One of the greatest 
achievements of Cairo‚Äôs medieval 
artisans was the decorative 
carving of stone surfaces, seen 
at its best on the city‚Äôs myriad 
minarets and, particularly, its 
domes. Developed under the 
Mamluks, the decoration of 
domes became an increasingly 
sophisticated art culminating in 
mesmerizing interwoven patterns 
of geometric and Ô¨Çoral designs.

 Madrassa 
 A madrassa is a Koranic 
school, where law and theology

mosques and madrassas

A mosque tends to 
incorporate teaching 
rooms or has iwans ‚Äì 
large arched spaces 
arranged around a 
central courtyard,  
in which lessons  
are given.

 Domestic Architecture 
 Private houses (beit) owed 
their design to climatic and social 
conditions. They were inward- 
looking for privacy, with rooms 
arranged around a central 
courtyard. Small windows, large 
airy rooms, shady arcades, 
fountains and rooftop ‚Äúwind 
catchers‚Äù that channelled cool 
breezes kept the houses cool.

 Mashrabiya
 These are wooden-lattice 
screens. Long before glass 
became common, mashrabiya 
was used to cover windows,

like niche that indicates the 
Muslims‚Äô direction of prayer.

 Wooden ceilings in the 
prayer halls of mosques were 
often carved with intricate

in rich colours. Doors were also 
often inlaid with pieces of ivory. 
Fine examples of this can be

Luxor Museum
Although this museum is far 
smaller than Cairo‚Äôs Egyptian 
Museum, the exhibits are better 
displayed and labelled. Many 
pieces were discovered locally 
and mostly date from the New 
Kingdom era, notably reÔ¨Åned 
statuary, treasures from 
Tutankhamun‚Äôs tomb and some 
fascinating items from the reign 
of Akhenaten (see p99). 
^ 
Alexandria National 
Museum
Inaugurated in 2003 and housed 
in a villa that formerly contained 
the US Consulate, this museum 
combines chronologically 
arranged collections from the 
Pharaonic, Coptic and Islamic 
periods. There are also some 
19th-century examples of 
glassware, weaponry and 
jewellery, as well as a few items 
of statuary recovered from the 
seabed in recent times. All 
exhibits are beautifully presented 
and well labelled (see p95).
% 
Graeco-Roman Museum, 
Alexandria
This revered museum exhibits a 
fascinating collection relating to 
the Ptolemaic era ‚Äì the three 
centuries spanning around  
300‚Äì30 BC, from the time of 
Alexander the Great to Cleopatra. 
It also has exhibits covering the 
Roman period up until the Arab 
conquest in AD 640. Highlights 
include some superb mosaics 
and a giant Apis bull in basalt 
from the time of Hadrian, found 
at the Serapeum, the site of 
classical Alexandria‚Äôs main 
temple (see p95).
) 
Nubia Museum, Aswan
The Nubians are a dark-
skinned people whose lands have 
historically straddled the Egyptian‚Äì 
Sudanese border. They have their 
own distinctive arts and crafts and 
architecture, as well as a millennia-
long history, all of which are 
celebrated in this purpose-built 
museum in Aswan (see p109).
( 
Mummification Museum, 
Luxor
This is a small museum devoted 
to the subject of death and the 
afterlife. Exhibits explain the 
processes of mummiÔ¨Åcation and 
include tools used for the 
mummiÔ¨Åcation process. Also 
displayed are the well-preserved 
mummy of a 21st-Dynasty high 
priest of Amun, and a host of 
mummiÔ¨Åed animals, as well as 
some painted cofÔ¨Åns (see p99).

Boris Karloff in the title role. It 
was released just a decade after 
the opening of the tomb of 
Tutankhamun unleashed the 
supposed ‚Äúcurse of the pharaoh‚Äù.

The English Patient
Much of the action in the 
1996 multi-Oscar-winning Ô¨Ålm is 
set in Cairo and Egypt‚Äôs Western 
Desert, which was shot in Venice 
and Tunisia, respectively. The 
central character of Count Laszlo 
de Alm√°sy is based on a real

explorer and spy for Germany 
during World War II.

As famous for the on-set 
romance between its two stars, 
Elizabeth Taylor and Richard 
Burton, as for the on-screen story,

The papyrus sold 
throughout Egypt is actually 
dried banana leaf, printed 
with designs copied from

Real hand-painted papyrus is 
sold only at specialist galleries

The souqs are full of stalls

Egyptian Cotton
Cotton as a crop was 
introduced into Egypt in the 
19th century and almost ever 
since Egypt has been renowned 
for the quality of its cotton 
goods, especially sheets and

is exported and what you Ô¨Ånd

certain shops at the malls and 
hotels sell top-quality goods.

Jewellery
Egyptians buy large 
quantities of gold and silver 
as traditionally many feel it‚Äôs 
safer than putting their money in 
the banks. Precious metals are 
sold by the gram in the souqs;

then added to the price for the 
workmanship. A favourite 
souvenir is a cartouche with

@ 
Taamiya
Another Egyptian streetfood 
staple, known elsewhere as 
falafel, taamiya is made with 
mashed fava beans and parsley 
(instead of chickpeas, which  
are used elsewhere around the 
Mediterranean). It is made in the 
shape of Ô¨Çat discs rather than 
round balls and is typically eaten 
as a sandwich with salad.
¬£ 
Koshari
A mix of rice, brown lentils 
and macaroni topped with fried 
onions and a spicy tomato sauce, 
koshari is normally eaten in 
dedicated koshari restaurants 
that serve the dish exclusively.

Kofta and Kebab
Flame-grilled chunks of lamb 
(kebab) and spiced minced meat 
made into a sausage and grilled 
on a skewer (kofta) are a 
favourite Egyptian meal. It is 
typically eaten with a simple 
chopped tomato and cucumber 
salad and a disc of Ô¨Çatbread.

Molokhiya
Hard to like on Ô¨Årst encounter, 
this is a soup made from mallow 
leaves. Green in colour, it has a 
thick, viscous texture. Egyptians 
eat it with meat such as rabbit or 
lamb. Fatimid Sultan Hakim found 
the dish so unappetizing that he 
had it banned in the 11th century.

% Fresh Fruit Juices
Juice stalls are common 
throughout Egypt, serving 
juices from pomegranate or 
orange to guava or mango.
^ Sugarcane Juice
Even more popular (it‚Äôs 
cheaper) than fruit juice is 
sugarcane juice (asab). The 
cane is ground up and served 
as a milky green liquid.
& Tea
Tea (shai) is served strong 
and extremely sweet. For 
Western-style tea ask for ‚Äúshai 
lipton‚Äù, made with a teabag.
* Coffee
Traditional qahwa (coffee) 
is a Turkish-style coffee, 
served sweet. For Western 
coffee ask for ‚Äúnescaf‚Äù.
( Stella
Local Egyptian beer, a low-
strength lager, is called Stella.
) Mineral Water 
Drinking bottled water  
is recommended. Available 
throughout the country, a 1.5 
litre bottle costs about ¬£E3.
& 
Pigeon
A traditional delicacy, 
pigeons (hamaam) are bred 
throughout Egypt in conical 
pigeon towers. They are stuffed 
with seasoned rice or, even 
better, bulgur wheat (freek) 
before being grilled or baked. 
* 
Desserts
Egyptian desserts are quite 
light. Mahalabiya is a delicate 
rosewater-Ô¨Çavoured ground rice 
dessert, topped with toasted 
nuts and cinnamon. Um Ali is 
similar to the English bread and 
butter pudding but is less soft 
and spongy as it is made with 
local dry breads. Roz bi laban is 
rice pudding, which is always 
served cold.
( 
Baklava
Egyptians are big fans of the 
sticky, syrup-drenched, nut-Ô¨Ålled 
Ô¨Ålo pastries known collectively 
as baklava. There are numerous 
different kinds such as konafa, 
which has a cream base and a 
crunchy vermicelli pastry crust 
and basbousa, made of semolina 
pastry soaked in honey and 
topped with hazelnuts. 
) 
Fiteer
Fiteer is a light, Ô¨Çaky multi-
layered bread made from dough 
stretched paper thin and folded 
several times. It is served stuffed 
with minced meat or cheese or 
just plain, brushed with samneh 
(ghee) or dusted with icing sugar.

Abu al-Sid, Cairo
It is often said that Egyptian 
cooking is a domestic cuisine, 
not especially suited to a high-
class restaurant. Abu al-Sid 
proves otherwise. This is a very 
fashionable restaurant, decorated 
in an Oriental style with hanging 
lamps and brass tables, which 
has single-handedly made dining 
out on traditional delicacies 
fashionable. Specialities include 
stuffed pigeon and molokhiya 
with rabbit (see p79).

Much of the best dining in Egypt

Four Seasons establishments, 
particularly Cairo‚Äôs Four Seasons 
at the Nile Plaza (see p125), 
which boasts four excellent 
dining options, including Aqua,  
a superb seafood restaurant with 
splendid views of the Nile and  
an excellent sushi bar. At the

Sumptuous, striking and  
hip, Buddha Bar sets the standard 
for cool in Cairo. The split-level 
restaurant is presided over by a 
giant smiling Buddha, while the 
impressive outdoor terrace offers 
stunning Nile views. Asian fusion 
food and the best sushi in town 
are on the menu, and a dazzling 
cock tail list aids the transition 
from dining to dancing. The 
Buddha‚Äôs signature ambient 
music gives way to live DJs  
later in the evening (see p79).

Felfela, Cairo
A long-standing favourite 
with tourists as well as locals, 
Felfela specializes in inexpensive 
Egyptian street fare served in 
fun surroundings consisting of 
tree-trunk tables, aquariums of 
tropical Ô¨Åsh and terrapins, and 
twittering birds in cages. This is 
the perfect restaurant to sample 
traditional staples such as fuul, 
taamiya and grilled pigeon. Try 
the hosniya, which is fuul with 
egg and cream baked in the  
oven (see p79).

exception is the house restaurant 
at the venerable Old Cataract 
hotel. Here the menu is comprised 
of excellent Continental European 
standard fare and local Ô¨Åsh 
specialities. Best of all is the

Ramadan
Ramadan is the Islamic month 
of fasting. During daylight hours 
observant Muslims must not eat, 
drink or smoke. The fast is broken 
at sunset with iftar (breakfast), a 
meal usually enjoyed with all the 
family. Although tempers can be 
frayed during the day (especially 
when Ramadan falls during 
summer heat), it is a festive time 
with many people out on the 
streets until the early hours of the 
morning. The celebrations peak 
with Eid al-Fitr, a three-day feast 
to mark Ramadan‚Äôs end. 
# 
Pharaoh‚Äôs Rally
Taking place every October, 
this is a gruelling week-long,  
3,100-km (1,900-mile) motor 
vehicle race (including cars and

desert, with the Pyramids as both 
starting and Ô¨Ånishing point.  
Major car manufacturers and

Cairo International 
Film Festival 
An often chaotic and 
disorganized celebration of local

in November or December every 
year in various cinemas across 
the capital. It is usually attended 
by a bevy of Arab world and 
international Ô¨Ålm stars. The 
festival is hugely popular with 
local Egyptians because the 
festival screenings‚Äô censorship 
laws are relaxed and international 
Ô¨Ålms are screened uncut.

This is a commemoration of 
Abraham‚Äôs willingness to sacriÔ¨Åce

among the poor. It is also a time 
for visiting family and friends,  
and for exchanging gifts.

The Prophet‚Äôs Birthday
Also known as the Moulid 
an-Nabi, this major holiday 
celebrates the birth of the 
Prophet Mohammed. The streets 
burst into colour and noise. Like 
all Islamic holy days, it follows 
the Islamic calendar, which is 
about 11 days shorter than the 
Western calendar. As a result, 
Islamic holidays move forward 
every year compared with the 
Western calendar.

International Egyptian 
Marathon
Every January or February, when

Moulid of Abu al-Haggag
This festival honours Luxor‚Äôs 
patron saint, whose mosque sits

Giant Ô¨Çoats travel through the 
densely packed streets, and there 
is drumming, ritualistic stick Ô¨Åghts 
and horse races. The moulid 
occurs the month before Ramadan 
and so the date changes each year.

U
NTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE 19TH CENTURY Cairo was a walled medieval 
city, with a street plan largely unaltered since the time of the Fatimids 
(see p42). This changed with the rule of Khedive Ismail (1863‚Äì79), who had 
been educated in France and wanted to reshape his capital into a modern 
and smart city similar to Paris. Rather than try to impose order on the  
existing city, he created an entirely new city with tree-lined boulevards, 
squares and fine European architecture on the flood plain between the  
medieval walls and the Nile. This remains the heart of central Cairo and is,  
for the most part, compact enough to explore on foot. Since then the city has 
crossed the Nile to the 
west bank and spread 
all the way to the foot  
of the Pyramids, as well  
as extending far to  
the north and the  
south in a series  
of modern suburbs.

Egyptian Museum
Right at the heart of the 
modern city, on Midan Tahrir  
(Cairo‚Äôs main, trafÔ¨Åc-choked 
square), is the country‚Äôs main 
museum. It‚Äôs one of the top 
museums in the world, 
thanks to an unequalled 
collection of artefacts 
from ancient Egypt, 
ranging from small pieces 
of delicate jewellery to 
towering colossi of the 
pharaohs and the 
Tutankhamun Galleries.  
It is advisable to arrive 
early to avoid the crowds 
and to allow as much 
time as possible to see 
the exhibits (see pp8‚Äì11).
¬£ 
Cairo Opera House 
Complex
Cairo‚Äôs original opera house  
was built in 1869 for the 
opening of the Suez Canal  
and was located Downtown 
on what is still known as 
Midan Opera. It burnt to 
the ground in 1971 and it 
was only in 1988 that the 
city Ô¨Ånally got its new 
opera house, a stunning, 
modernist update on 
Islamic architecture, 
designed and funded by 
the Japanese. It sits in 
beautifully landscaped 
grounds, which also 
house the impressive 
Museum of Modern Egyptian  
Art (see p75). d Map D‚ÄìE4

Downtown
This is the 19th-century city 
created by Ismail. It stretches 
east of the Egyptian Museum 
and is centred on two main 
intersecting streets: Sharia Talaat 
Harb and Sharia Qasr al-Nil. Both 
are busy shopping streets, lined 
with storefronts displaying gaudy 
clothing and shoes. Some of the 
architecture (see p73, Walk in 
‚ÄúParis on the Nile‚Äù) is beautiful, 
much of it in an Italianate style, 
but it is very dilapidated as in 
recent times all investment and 
growth has been concentrated  
in the suburbs.
$ 
Cairo Tower
For the best city views visit 
this 1962 tower on the island of 
Gezira, where a lift takes you 
185 m (610 ft) up to a viewing 
platform. The panorama stretches 
from the cliffs of the Muqattam 
Hills, which constrain the city‚Äôs 
spread to the east, all the way 
west to the Pyramids, which 
mark the point at which 
Cairo meets the desert. 
The best time to go up 
the tower is at sunset, 
when millions of lights 
twinkle into life and the 
evening call to prayer 
sounds out below from 
a thousand or more 
mosques. d Map E4

Garden City
South of Midan Tahrir, Garden City 
is one of the most tranquil parts 
of central Cairo. It was created in 
the early 20th century by the 
British as a garden suburb with 
curving, tree-lined streets meant 
to evoke the country lanes of 
England. It is home to several 
embassies, including the British, 
Canadian and American.
% 
Zamalek
The island in the middle of 
the Nile, just across from central 
Cairo, is known as Gezira (which 
is the Arabic word for ‚Äúisland‚Äù). 
Occupying its northern half is the 
smart neighbourhood of Zamalek. 
It has always been an enclave 
enjoyed by privileged European 
residents and wealthy Egyptian 
families. The main street, Sharia 
26th July, is the location of the  
city‚Äôs best pizza restaurant, Maison 
Thomas (see p78); the only real 
Continental-style caf√©, Simonds 
(see p78); the best bookshop, 
Diwan (see p75); and, in the back 
streets, countless small fashion 
boutiques and galleries.
& 
Bulaq
Once the port of the Mamluk 
sultans, these days Bulaq is best 
known for the pandemonium of 
its souqs, which sell second-
hand clothes and endless reams 
of cloth, as well as hardware, car 
parts and food. Not for the faint-
hearted, this is another face of 
Cairo, bustling and un-touristy, 
yet hidden among the narrow 
alleys is the serenely perfect 
Mosque of Sinan Pasha. d Map F2 
^ 
Manial Palace
The other island in the centre 
of the Nile, a little way south of 
Gezira, is Rhoda, worth visiting 
for the Manial Palace, which sits 
near the northern tip. Built by 
Prince Mohammed Ali, uncle of 
King Farouk, between 1899 and 
1929, it is a monument to excess 
and eccentric taste. Five pavilions 
are decorated in a variety of 
Islamic styles, including Moorish, 
Ottoman Turkish, Persian and 
Syrian. There is also a grotesque 
hunting museum that features 
hundreds of mounted ibex heads, 
as well as a hermaphrodite goat.

Mohammed Mahmoud Khalil 
(1876‚Äì1953) was a politician and

The Nile
The Nile is the heart of Cairo, 
bisecting the city. On the east 
bank, the riverside Corniche  
al-Nil is one of the city‚Äôs main 
north‚Äìsouth roads, making a 
walk beside the river anything 
but peaceful. However, over on 
Gezira, a pedestrian promenade 
runs along the water‚Äôs edge. The 
best way to experience the river 
is to take a ride in a felucca, one 
of the small triangular-sailed boats 
used on the Nile since antiquity. 
They can be hired by the hour at 
landing stages in front of the 
Semiramis and Four Seasons 
Nile Plaza hotels (see p125).
) 
The Pyramids
Half a century ago the 
Pyramids were a daytrip out  
of Cairo. Now the city stretches 
out to the paws of the Sphinx.  
In a taxi on empty roads, from 
central Cairo to the Pyramids on 
Giza Plateau, takes 15 minutes. 
The roads are rarely empty, 
however, and the journey more 
often takes about an hour. It is 
worth the extra time in the car 
as there is more to see than  
just the Pyramids, including 
subsidiary temples, the Solar 
Boat Museum and the Sphinx. 
Pedestrian promenade by the Nile
Beginning your walk at 
Midan Tahrir, walk north  
up Sharia Talaat Harb and 
stop at Felfela Takeaway 
(No. 15) (see p78) for a 
breakfast of fuul sandwiches. 
Ahead is Midan Talaat 
Harb, named for the 
nationalist banker whose 
statue stands in the 
middle of the square.  
Here on the left-hand  
side, golden Art Nouveau 
mosaics glitter around the 
entrance of Groppi, a 
patisserie and chocolatier 
in business on this site 
since 1925. Continue up 
Sharia Talaat Harb, passing 
on the right El Abd bakery 
(No. 25) (see p77), makers 
of the best baklava and 
other Egyptian pastries in 
town. Cross the busy 
junction with Sharia Abd 
Al-Khaliq Sarwat and on 
the left, No. 34 is the 
Yacoubian Building, 
immortalized in the book 
and Ô¨Ålm of the same name 
(see p49). The name is 
above the doorway in the 
entrance hall. Across the 
road is the Art Deco 
Cinema Metro, which 
opened in 1939 screening 
Gone With the Wind. Leave 
Sharia Talaat Harb and 
head east along Sharia 
Adly to pass the Babylonian- 
styled Shaar Hashamaim 
Synagogue, evidence of 
Egypt‚Äôs one-time large  
and inÔ¨Çuential Jewish 
community. Bearing right 
at the next junction leads 
down to pretty Midan 
Mustafa Kamel; turn right 
again into Sharia Qasr al-
Nil. Soon you reemerge at 
Midan Talaat Harb, at which 
point head south down 
Sharia Talaat Harb for lunch 
at Caf√© Riche (No. 17) 
(see p75), where the 1952 
Revolution was supposedly 
plotted, and which serves a 
good simple lunch.

A  
ROMAN FORTRESS ORIGINALLY STOOD ON THE SITE OF CAIRO. Known as 
Babylon-in-Egypt, it guarded a Nile crossing on the route to the ancient 
Egyptian capital of Memphis (see p91). This was surrendered to the invading 
armies of Islam in AD 640, who set up camp next door. The camp was made 
permanent and was expanded north by successive Arab dynasties, culminating 
in the walled city of Al-Qahira in 969, or Cairo. It is this area, from Babylon in 
the south, now known as Coptic Cairo or Old Cairo, to the northern gates of 
Al-Qahira, now known as Islamic Cairo, that make up the venerable core of 
today‚Äôs city, representing almost 1,400 years of continuously inhabited  
history ‚Äì a mere fraction of 
the age of the Pyramids, 
but certainly worth a 
few days of exploration.

Islamic Cairo
Stretching several miles along 
a north‚Äìsouth axis in the east of 
Cairo, this part of the city retains 
its medieval street pattern. The 
main streets are being restored, 
but most neighbourhoods remain 
ramshackle, housing a way of life 
largely unchanged in centuries. 
Streets are studded with several 
hundred monuments, from 
Ottoman-era fountains to splendid 
Mamluk palace complexes, most 
of which are accessible to 
visitors (see p87). At the heart of 
it all is Khan al-Khalili souq and 
Al-Azhar Mosque (see pp14‚Äì15). 
$ 
Al-Azhar Park
This beautiful park opened 
to great acclaim in 2004. It has a 
tall grassy hill at one end that 
slopes down to an artiÔ¨Åcial lake 
at the other end. It is landscaped 
in classical Islamic fashion with 
water features and Ô¨Çower beds, 
but also has an amphitheatre, 
children‚Äôs play area, a Ô¨Åne 
restaurant (see p89) and caf√©s.

This is Cairo‚Äôs chaotic and

date back to the 16th century. Its 
covered passageways, stone gates 
and labyrinthine alleys still have a 
wholly medieval feel. The trade 
in spices, brightly coloured cloth, 
perfumes, gold and silver bears 
little relation to the Western depart- 
ment store or supermarket. Of 
course, you have to haggle ‚Äì you 
will pay over the odds if you don‚Äôt

The Citadel
Overlooking the city from a 
rocky spur of the Muqattam 
Hills, the Citadel is a sizeable 
fortress, which from its founding 
in the 12th century, served as the 
royal residence and barracks until 
the late 19th century. Its earliest 
parts date back to the reign of 
the ruler Salah ad-Din (Saladin), 
but over the course of its history 
it was reorganized and enlarged 
on numerous occasions. There 
are three mosques to visit, as 
well as former palace buildings 
and museums (see p86).

The Copts
Before the arrival of Islam, Egypt 
was Christian and its people were 
known as Copts. When the Arab 
army occupied Egypt in AD 640, 
its leader Amr instructed his 
people to take good care of the 
Copts, for the Prophet himself 
had given orders for them to do 
so. Today Copts make up  
10 per cent of the nation.
^ 
Coptic Museum
Founded in 1908, the museum 
houses an absorbing collection 
representing a key period in world 
history, when the old gods were 
being replaced by Christianity. It 
is housed in a beautiful building, 
with exquisite painted ceilings and 
mashrabiya windows. The Old 
Wing gives access to a Roman 
tower known as the Water Gate.

Mosque of Amr
Egypt‚Äôs oldest mosque was 
founded by Amr Ibn al-As, the 
Arab general who conquered 
Egypt for Islam in AD 640. 
Although it has been altered 
many times since and doubled in 
size in 827, the Mosque of Amr 
today represents the beginnings 
of Islam in Egypt. It remains a 
very simple and humble structure. 
Behind the mosque, which is just 
a few minutes‚Äô walk north of 
Coptic Cairo, the surrounding 
hard-mud wasteland is the site 
of Fustat, the Ô¨Årst Arab city in 
Egypt. d Map M5 ‚Ä¢ Sharia Mar Girgis

Coptic Cairo
The heart of the district of 
Cairo‚Äôs Coptic Christian community 
centres on the Roman fortress of 
Babylon. The ancient gate towers 
of the former fortress provide 
access to a sunken compound 
(evidence that the street level  
has risen over the centuries), 
containing the Coptic Museum, 
numerous churches, a synagogue 
and several cemeteries (see p88).
d Map M6 ‚Ä¢ www.coptic-cairo.com

Mosque of Ibn Tulun
Successive Arab dynasties 
expanded the original city of 
Fustat north. One of these was 
the Tulunid dynasty (AD 868‚Äì905), 
founded by Ibn Tulun, who was 
sent to Egypt to govern on behalf 
of the Abbasids of Baghdad. His 
splendid mosque echoes those 
of his homeland of Iraq in its 
unique (for Egypt) minaret, which 
has a staircase spiralling around 
the outside of the tower. It is 
possible to climb the minaret to 
admire the view, not least of the 
mosque‚Äôs great courtyard with its 
elegant arcades and Ô¨Åne central 
ablutions fountain. Next to the 
mosque is the Gayer-Anderson

After Al-Azhar (see pp14‚Äì15), 
the other essential mosque to

Begun in 1356, its size rivals the

entered through a soaring portal 
with a stalactite hood, which 
leads to a simple but impressive 
courtyard with four massive 
arched recesses. The sultan lies 
at rest in his tomb chamber, to 
the right of the prayer niche. The

Hassan, was built over 500 years

Northern Cemetery
A lack of space caused 
Cairo‚Äôs medieval rulers to build 
their funerary monuments 
outside the city walls in the 
desert. Here they created some 
of Cairo‚Äôs Ô¨Ånest medieval 
monuments, from modest single- 
chambered tombs to palatial 
complexes with multiple courts, 
minarets and domes. Less 
exalted personages chose to be 
buried here also, beside their 
rulers. Over the centuries the 
homeless have moved into the 
tombs to the point today where 
the cemetery is a vibrant and 
living neighbourhood, usually 
referred to as the City of the 
Dead. d Map Q3‚Äì6

A Stroll up the  
Main Street of 
Medieval Cairo
Take a taxi to ‚ÄúAl-Hussein‚Äù. 
You will be let out beside 
Al-Azhar Mosque; walk to 
a footbridge over the road, 
cross and take the side 
street immediately in front, 
from where you emerge 
onto Sharia al-Muiz li-Din 
Allah, the main street of 
medieval Cairo. You can buy 
spices, silver, gold, brass 
or copper ware at the many 
stalls that line the street in 
Khan al-Khalili. Continue 
up the street, to Ô¨Ånd, one 
next to the other, the 
Madrassa‚ÄìMausoleum of 
Qalaoun, the Mosque of 
an-Nasir Mohammed and 
the Madrassa of Sultan 
Barquq. These are three 
splendid monuments from 
the Mamluk era, all of which 
can be visited (see p87).
A short distance ahead, 
the road divides at a small 
building with big grilled 
windows on the right-hand 
side: this is the Sabil-
Kuttab of Abdel Rahman 
Kathkuda (see p87). Bear 
left and continue, passing 
the small Mosque of Al-
Aqmar (see p87), then take 
Darb al-Asfur on the right 
to visit a Ô¨Åne old merchant‚Äôs 
house, Beit al-Sihaymi 
(see p87), where you can 
have tea in the courtyard.
Return to Sharia al-Muiz  
li-Din Allah. After a short 
time the road widens  
into a piazza beside the 
walls of the Mosque of 
Al-Hakim (see p87), built 
by a Fatimid sultan. The 
mosque abuts the 
Northern Walls of the 
original city of Al-Qahira; 
you can access the 
ramparts via the nearby 
gates (see p87). Return 
the way you came, treating 
yourself to lunch at the 
Naguib Mahfouz Caf√© in

main branches that create a fertile fan between them, known as the 
Delta, spreading north to the Mediterranean. This is an area in which life has 
Ô¨Çourished throughout history. The apex of the Delta was the site of the Ô¨Årst 
great imperial city of ancient Egypt, Memphis, which has now almost 
completely vanished. We get some intimation of its glory and vastness  
thanks to the city‚Äôs great necropolises of Saqqara and the various  
pyramid Ô¨Åelds that remain. The Delta itself was 
where later pharaohs created new capitals, 
Alexander founded his new city, Alexandria (at the 
point at which the Delta met the sea) and early 
Christianity Ô¨Çourished. All of these places can be 
visited as day trips from Cairo.

 Saqqara 
 One of the richest 
archaeological sites in Egypt, 
Saqqara was the royal burial ground 
for some of the earliest rulers and 
their courtiers. This is the site of 
Egypt‚Äôs prototype pyramid, a 
stepped structure built for King 
Djoser. The necropolis remained 
in use for some 3,000 years 
throughout the Pharaonic era, with 
additions being made as late as 
the Graeco-Roman period. It merits 
at least half a day‚Äôs visit (see  p94 ).

 Dahshur 
 The two pyramids at Dahshur 
were built by the 4th-Dynasty 
king Sneferu, father of Khufu, the 
builder of the Great Pyramid (see 
 pp12‚Äì13 ). The Bent Pyramid, thus 
known because its sides start 
steeply, then switch part way to 
a shallower slope, is considered 
to be Egypt‚Äôs Ô¨Å rst proper pyramid, 
as before this all pyramids were 
stepped. The other monument is 
known as the Red Pyramid due 
to its ancient red grafÔ¨Å ti. Both 
can be entered and explored.

 Memphis 
 Not much remains of the 
ancient city of Memphis, the 
capital of Egypt during the Old 
Kingdom. It is thought to have 
been founded about 3100 BC by 
King Menes, the ruler who united 
Upper And Lower Egypt. From 
historical accounts we know that 
it was a city of grand palaces 
and temples, which were all torn 
down by foreign invaders from 
the Romans onwards, and the 
ruins were buried. What remains 
today is gathered in a small 
open-air museum, the centrepiece 
of which is a colossal statue of 
Ramses II, which lies in its own 
special viewing pavilion.    d   Map J2

Egypt and the Camel
Although it has become part of 
the iconography of Egypt, the 
camel is not native to the country. 
In fact, it is a relative latecomer. 
Pharaonic tomb paintings show 
lions and hippos, as well as other 
creatures now extinct in Egypt, 
but not camels, which were then 
unknown. Historians believe that 
they were introduced by the 
invading Persians.

process, this remote valley just 
west of the Delta region was 
later equally valued by the early 
Christians as a hiding place from

A Day Beside  
the Suez Canal  
in Port Said 
Morning
Start your day near the 
green-domed Suez Canal 
Authority Building on the 
edge of the canal. From 
here, take a fun, free ride 
across the canal and back, 
courtesy of the car ferries 
that shuttle back and forth 
every 15 minutes between 
here and the far shore. 
Returning to where you 
started, head north along 
the canal on Sharia 
Filisteen, passing at  
No. 43 the Tourist OfÔ¨Åce 
(open 9am‚Äì2pm Sat‚ÄìThu), 
where you can pick up  
a good map. As you 
continue to walk 
northwards, look out for 
the faded fa√ßade of the 
Simon Artz depart ment 
store and the imposing 
monolith of the lighthouse. 
Continue to the end of the 
pedestrian promenade, 
where you will encounter 
an empty sandstone plinth 
on which a statue of 
Ferdinand De Lesseps, 
French builder of the canal, 
once stood before it was 
hauled down after the 
1952 Revolution. From 
here, hop in a taxi for a 
Ô¨Åve-minute drive to Al-Borg, 
the best seafood restaurant 
in Egypt (see p61).

Alexandria
After defeating the Persians 
in 332 BC, Alexander the Great 
founded his new capital city on 
the Mediterranean coast that 
same year. Under his successor 
Ptolemy and the dynasty he 
founded, it became the most 
important city of the ancient 
world ‚Äì an economic, political 
and cultural rival to Rome. After 
falling into decline in the 4th 
century, it was revived in the 
19th century, drawing thousands 
of Europeans. Although little of 
its ancient heritage remains, there 
is still plenty to see in modern 
Alexandria, Egypt‚Äôs second largest

are brought in their thousands 
from northwestern Sudan in a 
month-long trek to Aswan, from 
where they are then trucked up 
to Cairo. They are bought as 
mounts, but also for their meat.

ESPITE THE LARGE NUMBERS OF TOURISTS IT ATTRACTS, Luxor is little 
more than a small town on the banks of the Nile. Hundreds of 
thousands of international visitors flock here to marvel at what the modern 
town was built upon, which is the spectacular ruins of Thebes, vast capital of 
the pharaohs during the New Kingdom (1550‚Äì1069 BC). Only two temples 
remain ‚Äì Luxor Temple in the heart of the town and the Karnak temple 
complex just north of the town. 
Both were renowned throughout 
the ancient world and have 
attracted visitors ever since 
ancient Greek and Roman times. 
Even more extraordinary are the 
sites on the West Bank, which is 
where the pharaohs built their 
grand funerary temples and 
tombs. Cross by ferry or over the 
road bridge. Tickets for these 
monuments need to be bought in 
advance from a ticket office on 
the West Bank.

Temple of Hatshepsut
Against its stark mountainous 
backdrop, the partly rock-hewn 
Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut 
is an awe-inspiring sight and one 
of the most popular monuments 
on the West Bank. It was 
designed by Queen Hatshepsut‚Äôs 
architect Senenmut in the 18th 
Dynasty. The temple was 
damaged by Ramses II and his 
successors, and Christians later 
turned it into a monastery  
(hence its alternative name,  
Deir al-Bahri, which means 
‚ÄúNorthern Monastery‚Äù). Ongoing 
restorations of the site have done 
much to revive former glories and 
have revealed some exquisite 
decoration (see pp22‚Äì3).

Ramesseum
Ramses II was ruler of Egypt 
for 67 years and he built his 
mortuary temple as a statement 
of his eternal greatness. The 
huge complex dedicated to 
Amun, which took almost 20 years 
to build, now lies mostly in ruins 
with only some columns still 
standing (see p38). d Map V3

Medinat Habu
It is a great mystery why 
this magniÔ¨Åcent mortuary temple 
raised by Ramses III is not 
visited more. It is second in size 
only to Karnak, and is in a far 
more complete state than the 
nearby Ramesseum, on which 
Medinat Habu is modelled. 
Ramses III‚Äôs military campaigns 
are recorded in detail on the 
main entrance pylon and on the 
walls inside. In the second court, 
colourful reliefs are well preserved 
thanks to early Christians, who 
converted a part of the temple

offending images with plaster

Valley of the Kings
By digging their tombs deep 
into the Theban Hills the pharaohs 
hoped to stop robbers stealing 
the priceless possessions buried 
with them. It was an unsuccessful 
strategy. Every burial chamber 
discovered to date had been 
raided except for those of Yuya 
and Thuya and Tutankhamun  
(see p40‚Äì41). The vacant tombs 
are fascinating, with the corridor 
walls and burial chambers 
stunningly adorned with painted 
reliefs designed to help the 
pharaoh navigate the  
Underworld (see pp24‚Äì5).

A Stroll Along  
the Corniche
Morning
Start the day with breakfast 
at the Metropolitan Caf√©  
on the lower level of the 
Corniche by Luxor Temple. 
It has great views across 
the Nile. The morning is  
a good time to visit Luxor 
Temple (see pp20‚Äì21), 
before the heat gets too 
overwhelming. Afterwards, 
continue north up the 
Corniche, turning right 
onto Sharia al-Montazah; 
here you have a view of  
the Avenue of Sphinxes 
(see p20) that once 
connected Luxor Temple 
with Karnak, and can also 
clearly see how the 
modern town has been 
built on top of them.
Continue north up the 
Corniche, stopping for a 
visit to the MummiÔ¨Åcation 
Museum (see p99), then 
passing a couple of run-
down colonial-era buildings 
on your right, one of which 
was one of the earliest 
hotels in town and now 
houses the city council. 
Stop for lunch at Kebabgy 
in the Nile Shopping 
Centre on the Corniche 
(see p106). 
Just a short walk further 
north on the Corniche is 
the Luxor Museum (see 
p99) with its superb 
collection of artefacts from 
various tombs and temples. 
Afterwards, instead of 
walking all the way back, 
take a cal√®che, one of the 
horse-drawn carriages that 
patrol the town. The 
ofÔ¨Åcial rate is ¬£E30 per 
hour, but the drivers 
usually charge more. Ask 
the driver to take you back 
to the Old Winter Palace 
Hotel (see p129) for a late 
afternoon drink on the

Middle Eastern, in part due to the darker skin of many of its inhabitants, who 
are Nubians rather than Arabs. Life here moves at a languid pace and the

Souq
Filling one long street (Sharia 
al-Souq) that runs parallel to the 
riverside Corniche, Aswan‚Äôs 
colourful souq is the best in Egypt 
outside of Cairo. It is especially 
good for spices and dyes. Look 
out for dried hibiscus, boiled to 
make the drink karkade. You can 
also buy Nubian jewellery, 
scarves, skullcaps, embroidered 
galabiyyas and locally-made 
baskets. As in Cairo, it‚Äôs important 
that you haggle, or face paying 
way over the odds. d Map T4‚Äì5

Elephantine Island
The largest of the islands at 
Aswan, Elephantine Island is also 
the site of the town‚Äôs oldest 
settlement. In ancient times it 
was the cult centre of the ram-
headed god of the Nile Ô¨Çood, 
Khnum. Among the ruins at the 
southern end are those of the 
Temple of Khnum, built by 
Nectanebo in the 4th century BC. 
Regular ferries connect the island

Nubia is the area between

Kitchener‚Äôs Island
Behind Elephantine Island is 
the much smaller Kitchener‚Äôs 
Island, named for the British 
general Horatio Kitchener, who 
was presented with the island in 
the 1890s as a reward for leading 
the Egyptian army‚Äôs successful 
campaigns in Sudan. Kitchener, a 
keen botanist, planted the island 
with exotic plants and Ô¨Çowers 
from all over the world. To get to 
it you need to hire a felucca and 
ask the captain either to wait or to 
return for you at an agreed time.

Dam
Egypt‚Äôs fortunes have historically 
always been linked to the annual 
Ô¨Çooding of the Nile. In order to 
regulate this the British built the 
Aswan Dam between 1898 and 
1902. This soon proved too small 
to control the river‚Äôs unpredictable 
Ô¨Çoods and in the 1960s President 
Nasser began construction of the 
High Dam. The resultant 
increases in agricultural 
production and hydroelectricity 
have saved Egypt from famine.
& 
Unfinished Obelisk
One of the strangest sites 
in Egypt is a huge obelisk still 
attached to the bedrock in an 
ancient quarry in the hills south 
of Aswan that supplied the 
ancient Egyptians with red 
granite for their temples and 
statues. Three sides of the shaft 
were completed before a Ô¨Çaw 
was discovered in the stone and 
the obelisk was abandoned. Had 
it been completed, it would  
have weighed an astonishing  
1.8 million kg (1,197 tons) and 
stood 41 m (134 ft) high. d Map

Felucca Rides
Aswan is the Ô¨Ånest place to 
go sailing in a felucca. You can 
hire one by the hour or for the 
day and use it as your personal 
transport to visit Elephantine and 
Kitchener‚Äôs islands and the 
tombs on the west bank. The 
more adventurous might consider 
a two-night, three-day cruise to 
Edfu. The boats take up to six 
people and conditions are basic. 
The felucca captains congregate 
on the Corniche. Alternatively, 
you can have your hotel make 
the arrangements.
^ 
Tombs of the Nobles
The hills on the west bank of 
the Nile at Aswan have tombs 
hewn out of the rock dating from 
the Old and Middle Kingdoms, 
many of which are decorated. 
The best (No.31) is that of Prince 
Sarenput II, governor of southern 
Egypt during the 12th Dynasty. It  
is decorated with statues of the 
prince and painted scenes of 
hunting and Ô¨Åshing. To get to the 
tombs take a local ferry from the 
Corniche near the railway station.

Temple of Philae
A highlight of Aswan, and 
reason alone to pay a visit to  
the town, is this Graeco-Roman 
temple dedicated to the cult of 
Isis. It is situated on its own 
picturesque island in the middle 
of the Nile and the only way to 
visit it is by motor launch, which 
makes for a supremely dramatic 
approach. It lies between the 
Aswan and High Dams, a  
15-minute drive south of town, 
and is usually visited as part of 
an organized tour, although it is 
possible to get a taxi ‚Äì just ask 
for Shallal, which is where the 
motorboats dock (see pp28‚Äì9).

3,830 m (12,562 ft) across, 111 m 
(364 ft) high and 980 m (3,214 ft) 
wide at its base. At the eastern

Abu Simbel
Hewn out of a solid cliff in 
the 13th century BC, the great 
Sun Temple and the smaller 
Temple of Hathor at Abu Simbel 
are a breathtaking sight. 
Although dedicated to the gods, 
the Sun Temple is really a 
monument to the pharaoh 
Ramses II, as a statement of  
his power. His image dominates 
the fa√ßade in the form of four 
seated colossi. The temple is 
usually visited as a day trip from 
Aswan, a convoy of coaches 
departing early in the morning 
and returning late in the 
afternoon. Abu Simbel also has 
its own airport (see pp30‚Äì31). 
The Sun Temple at Abu Simbel
A Day in Aswan
Morning
Aswan is not a great 
sightseeing city like Cairo 
or Luxor. It is a mellow 
town, partly because the 
heat slows down the 
tempo. Start the day with 
breakfast on your boat 
before going ashore. Then 
head inland until you come 
to Sharia al-Souk, and walk 
south. In recent years the 
souq has been smartened 
up and part of it has been 
converted into a pedestrian- 
only promenade, but it 
remains authentic and is 
the most charming bazaar 
in Egypt. For a unique 
souvenir look out for local 
Nubian handicrafts and 
cassettes of Nubian music. 
Eventually the souq peters 
out and Sharia al-Souq 
swings right to connect 
with the Corniche. Just 
north of here are a string 
of moored boats that 
double as restaurants, 
with the Aswan Moon 
(Corniche al-Nil ‚Ä¢ 097 231 
61 08) being a great spot 
to stop off for lunch.
The best way to combat 
the afternoon heat is to 
take to the water in a 
felucca. Boat captains  
tout for business on the 
Corniche and charge by 
the hour. You can choose 
to drift languidly or be 
dropped off on Kitchener‚Äôs 
Island or on Elephantine 
Island for further exploring. 
Later on, hire a felucca or 
catch the local ferry from 
near the Aswan Museum 
(see p112) on Elephantine 
Island back to the 
mainland and head to  
the nearby Old Cataract 
Hotel (see p131) for 
sundowners on the 
terrace. At dusk the river 
takes on a pink hue, which 
is beautiful and calming.

) What to Take
You can buy most 
things in Egypt but you 
should bring your own 
sunscreen. You should 
also bring any prescription 
or non-prescription 
medicines. Egyptian 
pharmacies are very good, 
but drugs may go under 
unrecognizable names.

@ Climate
Avoid July and August, 
which are unbearably 
hot, with temperatures  
at a constant of around 
30‚Äì40ÀöC (85‚Äì105ÀöF). The 
best weather is December 
to February, when the 
temperatures in Upper 
Egypt are much less 
uncomfortable, and, in 
Cairo, it can even get 
chilly in the evenings, 
making a jacket necessary. 
& Tourist Offices 
in Egypt
There are tourist ofÔ¨Åces 
in all of the large towns 
and cities in Egypt, but 
they tend to be of little 
use with uninformed 
staff and little in the way 
of maps or other printed 
material. Hotel desks are 
usually a better source of 
up-to-date information, 
% Egyptian 
Consulates
If you wish to organize 
your Egyptian visa in 
advance or have any 
queries, a complete list 
of Egyptian embassies 
and consulates can be 
found on the following 
website: www.
embassyworld.com 
( Insurance
Travellers should take 
out both health and 
personal belongings 
insurance. Although it is 
possible to get good 
medical assistance in 
Egypt, it has to be paid 
for (state facilities should 
deÔ¨Ånitely be avoided) and 
the best hospitals and 
doctors are expensive. If 
you have anything stolen 
you need to obtain an 
ofÔ¨Åcial theft report, called 
a mahdar, from the police.
¬£ When to Go
As far as temperature 
goes, winter is the best 
time of year, although 
hotels and cruises get 
booked up over Christmas 
and New Year. November 
and late January/February 
are good for avoiding the 
worst of the crowds. You 
may also want to steer 
clear of the holy month of 
Ramadan (see p62), when 
opening hours are erratic.

! By Air From 
Europe
Flying to Egypt from the 
UK takes Ô¨Åve to six hours. 
There are international 
airports at Alexandria, 
Cairo and Luxor, although 
most major carriers Ô¨Çy 
into Cairo only. Major 
airlines Ô¨Çying direct from 
the UK to Egypt include 
British Airways, BMI and 
EgyptAir, although you 
may get cheaper fares 
with other carriers that 
involve a change of 
Ô¨Çights, such as Air France 
via Paris, for example.
@ By Intercontinental 
Air
From the USA, EgyptAir 
Ô¨Çies direct to Cairo daily. 
Delta Air Lines operates 
Ô¨Åve Ô¨Çights a week from 
New York. A num ber  
of European and Gulf 
airlines serve Cairo  
from a wider range of 
departure points, but New 
York still offers by far the 
biggest choice of airlines.

% Egypt‚Äôs Airports
Cairo airport is around 
20 km (12 miles) north-
east of the city centre. 
There is no adequate 
public transport and the 
only realistic option is to 
take a taxi, which costs 
around ¬£E80 to central 
Cairo. Luxor and Aswan 
airports are much easier 
to negotiate and are far 
closer to their respective 
city centres.
^ Train
The only real alter-
native to Ô¨Çying between 
Cairo and Luxor and 
Aswan is to take the train. 
There are three tourist 
trains, all of which travel 
overnight and have 
sleeper carriages. They 
depart Cairo around 9pm 
and arrive in Luxor about 
6am the next day. For 
current schedules, prices 
and reservations visit 
www.egyptrail.gov.eg or 
www.sleepingtrains.com 
& Long-Distance 
Buses
Buses are the best way 
to travel between Cairo 
and destinations such as 
Alexandria, Port Said and 
Ismailia. Services are 
more frequent and faster 
than trains. Various 
companies compete on 
the routes, with Superjet, 
where available, being 
the most reputable.
* Taxis
Within Egypt‚Äôs towns, 
by far the most convenient 
way to get around is by 
taxi. Taxis are plentiful 
and, by Western standards, 
cheap. Avoid black-and-
white unmetered taxis. 
White cabs have working 
meters and can be hailed 
on the street. Yellow cabs 
also have a meter but 
must be booked by 
phone. Blue cabs can  
be more expensive as 
they charge a Ô¨Çat fee 
according to distance.

( Car Hire
Driving in Egypt can 
be terrifying. Egyptians 
do not seem to obey any 
road rules, communicate 
by means of the horn 
and are adverse to using 
headlights at night. If you 
feel you need the freedom 
of a car to get around, it 
isn‚Äôt any more expensive 
to hire a car and driver or 
just negotiate a day rate 
with a local taxi.
) Boat
The Nile runs from the 
very south of Egypt all the 
way up the middle, exiting 
into the Mediterranean in 
the north. But the central 
stretch of the river, 
through what is known 
as Middle Egypt, is 
closed to passenger 
trafÔ¨Åc because of ongoing 
and long-standing security 
concerns. Boat travel 
(other than by small boat 
such as felucca) is only 
possible south of Luxor.

around 10am until 9pm or 
later, but may close for 
midday prayers on Friday. 
In Alexandria many shops

letters is at your hotel. 
Airmail letters take 
between around a week

an item of furniture or a 
carpet, then the seller 
should be able to 
organize the shipping for 
you. Private courier Ô¨Årms 
such as DHL (www.dhl.
com) and FedEx (www.
fedex.com/eg) do exist in 
Egypt, with ofÔ¨Åces in 
Cairo and Luxor, but they 
are expensive. 
¬£ Banks & ATMs
Money can be 
changed at banks and 
Forex bureaus, which are 
private moneychangers 
found in larger towns. 
Forex bureaus tend to 
offer better rates than 
banks but they don‚Äôt 
always take traveller‚Äôs 
cheques. Automatic Cash 
Dispensers (ATMs) have 
proliferated rapidly in 
recent years, although 
not all are compatible 
with international banking 
cards. The best place to 
look for ATMs is in the 
lobby of larger hotels.
^ Mobile Phones
Not all networks 
provide roaming services 
in Egypt. If you are 
planning to use your 
mobile a lot you can buy 
a SIM card from a local 
provider such as Mobinil 
or Vodafone, both of which 
have shops throughout 
Egypt. You can then buy 
top-up cards from kiosks 
and grocery stores.
) Public 
Conveniences
Public toilets in Egypt are 
often unsanitary. Take the 
opportunity to make use 
of the facilities in hotels, 
upmarket restaurants and 
Western-style fast-food 
franchises and caf√©s, 
which tend to be better 
maintained. Even then 
there‚Äôs often no toilet 
paper so get into the 
habit of carrying a packet 
of tissues in your bag.
& Internet Access
There are Internet 
caf√©s all over Egypt,  
while many hotels offer an 
online terminal for guests‚Äô 
use. Charges are usually 
¬£E5‚Äì10 per hour, 
although Ô¨Åve-star hotels  
charge considerably more.

! Islam
While nowhere near 
as conservative as Iran or 
Saudi Arabia, Egypt is an 
Islamic country. Intimate 
behaviour in public (such 
as kissing or even 
holding hands) will be 
seen as offensive, and 
there are considerations 
of dress to be observed 
(see below). For more 
dos and don‚Äôts see p120.
$ Female Travellers
Egypt can be a 
stressful place for solo 
female travellers to visit. 
Many women visitors 
* Tipping
A tip is called 
baksheesh and it is 
expected by everybody. 
Anybody that does you 
any kind of service from 
carrying bags to looking 
after your shoes when 
you visit a mosque will 
expect a small gratuity. 
Usually ¬£E1 is sufÔ¨Åcient. 
A temple attendant who 
opens up a ‚Äúrestricted 
area‚Äù for you will expect 
something more like ¬£E5.
Left Sign prohibiting photography Centre Typical caf√© Right Shoes left outside a mosque 
Etiquette
@ Hospitality 
Egyptians are 
genuinely hospitable 
people, although it‚Äôs 
often hard to know when 
this is the case or the 
friendly welcome is just 
an overture that leads  
to a perfume or papyrus 
shop. Don‚Äôt be na√Øve, but 
at the same time avoid 
rudeness or aggressive 
behaviour in response  
to insistent offers and 
demands from would-be 
guides or salesmen.
% Photographing 
People
If you are taking a 
photograph of somebody, 
be sure to ask their 
permission. In rural 
areas, in particular, 
Egyptians can be 
sensitive about having 
their picture taken and  
it can sometimes lead to 
uncomfortable situations 
if you aren‚Äôt careful.
( Begging
Egyptians give freely 
to beggars ‚Äì it is a 
requirement of Islam. 
Children sometimes stand 
outside supermarkets and 
ask for food rather than 
money. What you will 
encounter as a visitor is 
lots of children asking  
for money, which is 
something quite different, 
as they prey on tourists. 
Most Egyptians Ô¨Ånd 
them a nuisance too and 
will shoo them away. 
¬£ Dress 
Avoid too much 
exposed skin. Shorts, for 
both men and women, 
are not acceptable when 
walking around town (but 
are Ô¨Åne on the boat or 
beach). Women should 
also avoid skimpy tops 
that leave shoulders or 
midriffs bare, and short 
skirts. However, it is not 
necessary for women to 
cover their hair.
& Smoking
A large percentage of 
men in Egypt still smoke 
and as yet there are few 
bans on where people 
) Visiting Mosques
Shoes must be 
removed before entering 
a mosque and there are 
often a shoe rack and 
shoe guardian at the door 
for this purpose. It is also 
essential that proper 
clothing is worn ‚Äì people 
wearing shorts or 
sleeveless T-shirts may 
be refused admission  
or offered a shawl to 
cover up with. 
^ Other 
Photographic 
Considerations
Often Egyptians may 
stop you taking 
photographs of things 
they feel show the 
country in a ‚Äúbackward‚Äù 
light. Also, photographing 
bridges, train stations, 
policemen or police 
stations ‚Äì anything that 
might be considered 
‚Äústrategic‚Äù ‚Äì is 
absolutely forbidden and 
may result in your 
camera being conÔ¨Åscated 
until you can prove you 
have deleted the images.
have a problem with 
persistent sexual 
harassment, from wolf 
whistles and lewd 
comments to furtive 
gropes or bottom-
pinching. Having a male 
friend along greatly 
reduces, but unfortun-
ately does not eliminate, 
the hassle. 
can do so. Expect indoor 
restaurants and caf√©s to

Things to Avoid
! Dehydration
It is terriÔ¨Åcally hot in 
Egypt and there is little 
shade at most tourist 
sites. Dehydration is a 
very real threat so drink 
plenty of Ô¨Çuids (not 
alcohol or coffee, both  
of which exacerbate the 
problem) and put a little 
extra salt on your food. 
Bottled water is sold 
everywhere but it is 
always wise to carry  
a bottle with you.
$ Getting Drunk
Alcohol is served in 
some restaurants, and 
bars do exist in Egypt, 
particularly in hotels,  
* Trying to Do 
Too Much
There is an immense 
amount to see and do in 
Egypt, particularly in Cairo 
and Luxor. Be realistic  
in your goals. It takes 
months to see everything, 
not days. A good plan in 
Luxor is to sightsee in 
the mornings, give 
yourself the afternoon off, 
and then possibly visit a 
temple in the evening for 
the Sound and Light show. 
Left Some places have very little shade Centre Holding hands is to be avoided Right Mineral water
@ Tap Water
Tap water in Egypt is 
heavily chlorinated and 
relatively safe to drink 
but if you are not used to 
it, it could still upset your 
stomach. For this reason 
it is best to stick to 
sealed bottles of mineral 
water, which are cheap 
and readily available 
throughout the country. 
% Drugs
There are drugs 
around in Egypt. 
Marijuana is not 
uncommon in Sinai but 
there‚Äôs also a harder drug 
scene in the cities that  
is a current cause of 
consternation. It is all 
illegal and penalties for 
anyone found using 
drugs are harsh. At the 
very least you will be 
deported and not allowed 
to return to the country.
( Losing Your 
Temper
‚ÄúJust for looking, just for 
looking!‚Äù‚Äì vendors‚Äô cries 
are incessant (‚ÄúCheaper 
than Asda price!‚Äù). Every 
Egyptian you meet seems 
to want to sell you 
something (‚ÄúMy brother 
has very nice perfume 
shop!‚Äù). They are just 
trying to make a living 
and it‚Äôs not easy. So even 
at the umpteenth tug of 
your sleeve, keep your 
cool and just say a polite 
‚ÄúNo thanks‚Äù.
¬£ Fake Guides
At many historic sites, 
especially the Pyramids 
and Karnak, you may be 
approached by locals 
offering their services as 
guides: be wary. Many of 
these men have next to 
no knowledge whatsoever 
and the extent of their 
commentary runs little 
further than: ‚ÄúVery big, 
very old‚Äù. If you feel you 
need a guide, consider 
hiring one in advance 
through your hotel.
^ Overstretching 
the Plumbing
Egyptian plumbing is not 
very robust. Toilets get 
blocked very easily. For 
this reason there will 
often be a wastebasket 
in the toilet cubicle, 
which is for used toilet 
paper. It may not seem 
particularly hygienic but 
is preferable to the 
Ô¨Çooding that will 
otherwise be the result.
) Believing All You 
Are Told
General Montgomery  
did not ride your camel  
at the Pyramids. Your 
felucca captain is not 
called Michael/Chris/
Bruce, just the same as 
you. That yellow powder 
you are snapping up as  
a bargain is not saffron. 
That papyrus is not ‚Äúvery 
old‚Äù but was probably 
plucked from a banana 
plant last week‚Ä¶ Enjoy 
Egypt but beware of 
being too gullible.
& Public Displays 
of Affection
No kissing in public,  
no holding hands, no 
walking with arms  
around each others‚Äô 
waists. Egypt is very 
conservative and if you 
want to avoid giving 
offence this is something 
couples need to be 
aware of.
but most Egyptians  
do not drink as they 
consider it contrary to 
Islam. Getting drunk is a 
sure way of demeaning 
yourself in the eyes of 
the locals. 

Streetsmart
121
! Vaccinations & 
Other Precautions
There are no compulsory 
inoculations for Egypt, 
although you should 
always be up to date 
with polio and tetanus 
vaccinations. It‚Äôs also 
worth being vaccinated 
against typhoid. Egypt is 
not in a malarial zone.
$ Mosquitoes
Mosquitoes can be a 
nuisance. Five-star hotels 
are usually air-tight and 
* Crime
Crime is minimal in 
Egypt. However, pick-
pockets work in Cairo, 
particularly around Midan 
Tahrir and on the buses 
to the Pyramids. Casual 
theft is no more or less 
prevalent than in any 
other country. Take the 
same precautions you 
would anywhere ‚Äì don‚Äôt 
leave valuables lying 
around in plain sight.
Left Mind pickpockets in crowded streets Centre Tourist police Right Detail of pharmacy sign
Security and Health
@ Food Safety
Just as it is unwise to 
drink the local tap water 
(see p120), it is also not 
recommended to eat 
salads as the vegetables 
will have been rinsed 
under the tap. Avoid raw 
meats and anything that 
looks undercooked, and 
always thoroughly wash 
(in puriÔ¨Åed water) any 
fruits that are eaten 
unpeeled, such as grapes.
% Animal Dangers
There are snakes  
and scorpions in Egypt, 
particularly in the south 
of the country, but the 
danger is minimal as they 
are mostly nocturnal and 
avoid people. A greater 
threat comes from the 
wild dogs that are 
occasionally encountered 
roaming city streets in 
packs. Do not approach 
them as they are feral 
and a bite will neces-
sitate precautionary 
rabies shots.
( Tourist Police
If you have a problem 
or need to report a 
crime, go to the Tourist 
Police, who can be found 
at tourist sites, airports 
and stations. They are 
supposed to be trained 
to assist foreign visitors 
and should speak a 
second language, usually 
English. They dress like 
normal police but wear 
an armband reading 
‚ÄúTourist Police‚Äù.
¬£ Stomach Upsets
No matter what 
precautions are taken, 
many visitors to Egypt 
will come down with 
diarrhoea. If and when 
you do, keep your bodily 
Ô¨Çuids topped up with 
plenty of bottled water 
and eat only the blandest 
of foods such as plain 
boiled rice and vegetables. 
You may also want to 
take rehydration salts. 
Medicines like Imodium 
should only be used if 
you have to travel or if the 
symptoms don‚Äôt clear up 
after a couple of days.
& Doctors
Most hotels and 
better pharmacies should 
be able to recommend a 
good English-speaking 
doctor. They charge for 
consultations ‚Äì expect to 
pay around ¬£E100. 
) Terrorism and 
Security
The Egyptian economy is 
extremely dependent on 
tourism and the 
government has invested 
heavily in making sure 
nothing happens to its 
foreign visitors. Since the 
terror attacks of the late 
1990s the country‚Äôs 
tourist attractions have 
been Ô¨Çooded with armed 
security. No tourists 
were harmed during the 
2011 anti-government 
protests, but it is wise  
to check the current 
situation with the Foreign 
OfÔ¨Åce before travel. 
^ Pharmacies
Egypt‚Äôs pharmacies 
are excellent and are 
usually staffed with well-
trained individuals who 
mostly speak English and 
who can dispense a wide 
range of medicines. If 
you have any health 
problems in Egypt the 
pharmacy should be your 
Ô¨Årst port of call. If the 
pharmacist doesn‚Äôt know 
what‚Äôs wrong they will 
recommend a doctor.
safe, but in cheaper 
hotels the pests often 
come as standard. You 
can employ mosquito 
coils, rub-on repellent  
or a plug-in vaporizer,  
all of which are sold  
at pharmacies.

Shopping and Eating Tips
! Haggling
If you shop in the 
souqs, haggling is 
unavoidable. Prices are 
never written down; you 
have to ask and if you 
agree the Ô¨Årst price the 
shopkeeper names, you 
will be paying way over 
the odds. If you want 
something, look around 
and ask the price at 
several different stalls. 
Then decide how much 
you are prepared to  
pay and make an offer 
well below it.
$ Antiquities
Do not be fooled into 
buying any sort of 
antiquity, pharaonic or 
otherwise, as 99 per 
cent of these are fakes. 
And if it is real, you are 
not allowed to take it out 
of the country anyway ‚Äì 
export of anything dating 
before the 20th century 
is illegal.
* Taxes
Although restaurant 
prices are comparatively 
cheap compared to the 
West, bills are subject  
to a 12 per cent service 
charge and a 10 per cent 
sales tax ‚Äì in other 
words you pay almost  
25 per cent more than 
the prices listed on  
the menu.
Left Copper- and brassware Centre Glasses of tea Right A shop in a souq
@ The Offer of Tea
When haggling, just 
because you accept a 
cup of tea from the 
shopkeeper does not 
mean that you are under 
any obligation to buy. If 
you are not happy with 
the price you should walk 
away. Bear in mind that 
however little you pay, a 
shopkeeper will never 
sell anything at a loss.
% Where to Shop
The most fun places 
for shopping are the 
colourful souqs in Cairo 
(Khan al-Khalili is the 
best) and the souq in 
Aswan. For more  
unusual items, Cairo has 
some great boutiques, 
particularly in the 
upmarket neighbourhoods 
of Zamalek and Doqqi  
(see p76).
( Tipping
In addition to the 
service charge (see above) 
it is expected that you tip 
in restaurants. Egyptians 
always do, and as rich 
foreigners your waiter 
will be mortally offended 
if you don‚Äôt. The standard 
is around 10 per cent. 
¬£ What to Buy
Tourist souvenirs are 
plentiful (see pp54‚Äì5). 
Copper- and brassware 
(pots, trays and hanging 
lamps) are particularly 
worth buying as Egyptian 
craftsmanship in 
metalwork is generally 
excellent. The best 
jewellery and carpets are 
produced by the Bedouin 
and are found only in 
boutiques, rather than in 
the souqs where the 
quality can be poor. Spices 
are cheap and excellent 
quality, while the opposite 
is true of clothing.
^ Types of 
Restaurants
Egypt doesn‚Äôt have a 
strong tradition of dining 
out and even a city as big 
as Cairo has surprisingly 
few good restaurants 
outside of the Ô¨Åve-star 
hotels. What there is in 
abundance, however, is 
good street food, in the 
form of fuul, taamiya, 
kushari and Ô¨Åteer (see 
pp58‚Äì9). Kebabs,  
served simply with  
bread and salad, are 
always tasty, too.
) Opening Hours
Streetfood vendors 
tend to keep long hours, 
often opening around 7am 
or 8am for breakfast and 
staying open until after 
midnight. Restaurants 
will open for lunch, close 
in the afternoon and then 
reopen in the evening, 
usually from 7pm until 
11pm. Few restaurants 
outside Cairo stay open 
until very late. 
& Vegetarians
The concept of 
vegetarianism is 
incomprehensible to 
most Egyptians. However, 
given that meat is 
viewed as a luxury item, 
most basic menu items 
are meat-free, such as 
fuul, taamiya, kushari and 
some types of Ô¨Åteer. 
Also, many of the meze 
served in upmarket 
restaurants are based 
around beans, pulses, 
seeds and vegetables, 
such as hummus, tahini 
and tabbouleh.

! The Options
Nile cruises booked 
as a package holiday can 
be good value. Seven 
nights on a boat plus 
Ô¨Çights can be much 
cheaper than Ô¨Çights alone 
booked independently. 
The downside is that you 
will be on a big boat with 
hundreds of other tourists. 
If you have the budget  
it‚Äôs worth paying more  
for a smaller boat with  
an agency such as 
Abercrombie and Kent  
or Voyages Jules Verne. 
d www.akegypt.com
‚Ä¢ www.vjv.co.uk
$ What to Wear
In addition to light 
clothes for sightseeing 
it‚Äôs worth bringing 
something slightly more 
formal for dinner, although 
none of the boats require 
jacket and tie. It can get 
chilly at night on the river 
so bring something a bit 
warmer for a late-night 
drink on deck.
* Booking
For the best choice  
of Nile cruises go to a 
specialist such as Nile 
Cruises Direct or 
Discover Egypt. Prices 
are higher at peak times, 
which include Christmas, 
New Year and Easter. 
When booking, avoid

Cruise Tips
@ Itineraries
There are two basic 
itineraries. The most 
popular is seven nights 
from Luxor to Aswan and 
back again. The other 
option is to sail one way 
spending two to three 
nights on board depending 
on which direction you 
sail. There‚Äôs also a Lake 
Nasser cruise, which takes 
three, four or eight days, 
depending on whether 
you depart from Aswan or 
Abu Simbel (see below).
% Food
Three meals a day are 
included on all package 
cruises, with packed 
lunches for excursions. 
Meals are buffet, mixing 
Egyptian with international 
dishes ‚Äì something for 
everyone. The quality of 
the fare depends on the 
boat, but at the higher 
end it is very good indeed. 
( Dahabiyyas
These replicas of  
19th-century sailboats 
are the Rolls-Royces 
among Nile cruisers. 
Advantages are gorgeous 
period surrounds, high-
class cuisine and a small 
number of fellow 
travellers. Prices are,  
of course, high. Most 
boats are privately owned 
by small companies, 
including Nour el-Nil, 
Nubian Nile Cruises and 
Dahabiyya. d www.

¬£ What Will I See?
Sailing from Luxor, 
the boat stops at Edfu 
and Kom Ombo before 
spending two nights at 
Aswan, where you visit 
Philae and have the option 
of paying for an extra 
excursion to Abu Simbel. 
The return leg visits Esna 
and, on docking at Luxor, 
includes a full-day‚Äôs 
sightseeing at Karnak 
and the West Bank.
& Guides
All boats have their 
own tour guides to 
shepherd tourists around 
the ancient sites and 
answer questions. The 
more upmarket boats 
have trained Egyptologists 
who also deliver lectures 
about the sites that will 
be visited on the 
following day.
) Lake Nasser 
The lesser-known 
alternative to a Nile cruise 
visits Aswan, Abu Simbel 
and several temples in 
between (see p113). Luxor 
is not included but you 
can visit it independently. 
Highlights are the lake‚Äôs 
unspoilt desert scenery 
and relative solitude (only 
six boats operate on the 
lake). The best boats are 
run by Belle Epoque Travel.

^ Evening 
Entertainment
Most boats have a bar  
or lounge and will host a 
galabiyya party, where all 
are encouraged to dress

Some boats feature local 
musicians, while the 
bigger boats have a

Accommodation Tips
! Staying in Cairo
The most convenient 
places to stay are by the 
Nile in central Cairo, 
which is close to the 
Egyptian Museum, Khan 
al-Khalili and Islamic Cairo. 
A number of Ô¨Åve-star 
hotels are located in the 
neighbourhood of the 
Pyramids but this means 
all the other sites of 
Cairo are a long taxi- 
ride away.
$ Making 
Reservations
Most Egyptian hotels  
and even hostels have 
Internet booking, but you 
should always follow up 
with an email and print 
out the conÔ¨Årmation. 
Egyptian hoteliers are 
famously slipshod when 
it comes to bookings and 
it is not unheard of for 
guests to turn up and 
Ô¨Ånd their reservation has 
not been recorded. 
* Historic Hotels
You can book yourself 
into a piece of history at 
a number of historic 
hotels (see pp52‚Äì3) 
mostly built in the late 
19th century when  
Egypt was enjoying its 
Ô¨Årst tourist boom. Most 
of these properties are 
now managed by 
international hotel chains 
and offer all the facilities 
expected of a Ô¨Åve-star 
establishment, but with 
added period charm. 
Left Hotel doorman Centre Kempinksi Nile Hotel Right Inside the historic Cairo Marriott
@ Luxor and Aswan
Both Luxor and 
Aswan are small enough 
that, in terms of location, 
it doesn‚Äôt really matter 
where you stay. All of the 
best accommodation 
clusters around the Nile 
and you should make 
sure that your room has 
river views. An interesting 
alternative in Luxor is to 
stay on the relatively 
undeveloped West Bank, 
where facilities tend to 
be more basic but this is 
compensated for by the 
timeless rural setting.
% Finding Something 
on the Spot
Out of season (June‚Äì
August) this is possible 
but at other times it is 
not recommended. All 
the best places get 
booked up in advance 
and at peak times 
(Christmas, New Year, 
Easter and Islamic feasts) 
even the worst places 
will also be fully booked.
( Hotel Touts
Tourists arriving at 
the railway station in 
Luxor or Aswan are 
swamped by touts 
offering cheap rooms. 
Most are hustling for 
commissions. The hotel 
they recommend is 
simply the one that 
charges the highest 
commission ‚Äì and most 
often it‚Äôs the seediest 
hotels that need the help 
of the touts to Ô¨Åll their 
rooms. The tout‚Äôs 
commission will be 
added to your bill.
¬£ Price 
Considerations
Prices are highest around 
Christmas, New Year and 
Easter, and also during 
the Islamic feasts of Eid 
al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr, 
which fall at the end of 
Ramadan. Conversely, 
out of season (June‚Äì
August), it is often 
possible to get some 
excellent deals. Rates  
are usually quoted in  
US dollars, although if 
paying by cash you do  
so in Egyptian pounds.
^ Tipping
Service workers are 
badly paid in Egypt and 
tipping the staff is never 
amiss. The simplest way 
is to leave something in 
your room for the maids. 
Porters who carry your 
bags to your room should 
receive ¬£E5. 
) Hotel Rerouting
In Cairo some taxi 
drivers ferrying tourists 
from the airport top up 
their earnings by touting 
for hotels. They may tell 
you that the hotel for 
which you‚Äôre heading is 
now closed and they can 
recommend somewhere 
better. This is not true 
and the recommended 
hotel is paying drivers  
for any guests they  
can steer its way. 
& Hidden Extras
 Hotel rooms are 
subject to about an extra 
20 per cent in taxes. In 
two- or three-star hotels 
you may be charged extra 
for air conditioning, fridge 
and TV. Check when 
booking that the rate 
quoted is all-inclusive.

The Arabic given here is the Modern Standard 
Arabic. This varies from the language spoken 
on the street (Egyptian Colloquial Arabic), 
which is a dialect of the standard language. 
Nevertheless, if you speak clearly and slowly 
you should have no difÔ¨Åculty in being 
understood. Transliteration from Arabic script 
to the Roman alphabet is a difÔ¨Åcult task. You 
will repeatedly come across contradictory 
spellings in Egypt. Here we have given a 
simple phonetic transcription. The characters 
in bold indicate stressed syllables.
