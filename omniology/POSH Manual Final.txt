The Big Question 
One of the things we’ll be addressing is the big question’s like– 
 
Why do some people succeed while others fail?   
 
Why some people are happy while others are miserable?   
 
Why do some people prosper in the same circumstances while other people 
remain poor? 
 
Why do some people have confidence while other people are struck down by 
fear?   
 
Why are some people healthy all the time, while others are constantly falling 
ill?   
 
Why are some people totally popular, while others are ignored or worse still, 
avoided?   
 
The Big Answer 
The answer to all of these questions lies in the amazing power of your 
unconscious mind.  Inside each one of us we have a blueprint for life.  
Depending on what this blueprint says we’ll succeed or fail, be happy or sad, 
prosper or remain poverty stricken.   
 
It’s either because the blueprint itself wants this as an outcome, as part of 
what it expects out of life or because it’s a natural side effect, consequence 
of something else that blueprint contains.   
 
As a quick example, if you can’t read it’s very difficult to educate yourself, 
because you don’t have access to the information that allows you to grow 
and learn from other people’s thoughts before you.   
 
In the same way, if your blueprint is missing certain skills or abilities or 
certain things that you could have in order to prosper, in order to be happy 
or feel confident -- in those circumstances it becomes an unintended side 
effect that you don’t have the things you want in life.

Whether your blueprint actually wants you to be in the negative side of life 
or your blueprint is just missing certain things which, if you had them, would 
make you wildly successful, happy and have all the good things you want in 
your life.   
 
Either way, this program will show you a powerful self-hypnosis method, in 
which we’ll show you how to change that blueprint so you can have success, 
happiness, wealth, confidence, health and all the friends you could possibly 
want and that is my aim for you.   
 
Over the course of the next seven days together those are the things we’ll 
be focusing on.  We’ll also focus on how to move you from one side of the 
equation to the other side, the place where you want to be.   
 
Track 3 – Your Hidden Goldmine 
Time: 6m 59s 
 
Your Hidden Goldmine 
I want to introduce you to a hidden goldmine that lies buried deep inside our 
minds.  Think of a person that’s been dropped in the middle of a 
mountainside somewhere with nothing but a shovel and a backpack to keep 
him company.  That person might be miserable and curse his luck for being 
stuck out in the woods with no means of supporting himself.   
 
What if I were to tell you that just around the corner from where he is 
there’s a goldmine waiting to be discovered and all he has to do is take the 
shovel and dig, not even that hard, and all of a sudden he’ll find fist size 
lumps of solid, pure gold, which he can stick in his backpack, hike to the 
next local town and live the rest of his life in absolutely luxury? 
 
In many respects that’s how we're born into this world.  We have an 
amazing potential that’s just resting, waiting to be activated inside of us.  To 
the extent that we ignore it and curse our fate we're like that guy on the 
mountainside.   
 
The tools that we have don’t look like they're worth much, but when you 
have one more thing, a little piece of knowledge, knowing where and how to 
dig, suddenly you start pulling out valuable treasures from a place that no 
one would have expected to find them.

We are standing on this goldmine right now.  This goldmine lies hidden 
inside each one of us.  It’s inside our minds and it is immensely powerful.  
This goldmine is going to give us the keys to living a richer, fuller and 
happier life.  This is what the Power of Self-Hypnosis method is designed to 
teach you to do.   
 
A Life In Harmony Is Easy 
Life was meant to be easy.  When you get in sync with the rhythms of 
nature then you have a certain flow to things and things just come, they go 
your way all the time.  When you fight nature on the other hand, it becomes 
hard.  When you channel those natural forces, it becomes easy, because 
now you don‘t have to make all the effort, the effort is being made for you.   
 
All you do is direct the energy one way or another to get the results that you 
want.  At this point, amazing things happen in people’s lives.  This is what I 
call the seventh Law of the Mind.  It’s the principle of Flow.   
 
If you trust the nature of your own mind and know how to activate it, how to 
guide the streams that are already inside you at that point, you have 
virtually unlimited potential for success, happiness, wealth, confidence, 
health and friendship anything you want out of life is waiting for you to get, 
if you can direct that stream into the direction you want.   
 
The Inner Blueprint Of Life 
There’s another law of mind that I’d like you to be aware of and I call it the 
Third Law.  It’s based on the psychological principle that perception is 
projection.  People don’t see the world around them the way that it is they 
see the world around them in a way that they are.   
 
You project whatever you have inside yourself onto the world and it becomes 
so.  If you have a distrusting nature, if you have something inside you that’s 
unhealthy or unhappy about life, you're going to find plenty of evidence 
around you to justify that, to be miserable and to have no friends.   
 
On the other hand, if you have something inside of you that looks for 
solutions, that looks for friendships and looks for the good in life, you will 
find exactly the same things in exactly the same situations.

Ironically, as you change what happens inside the world around you changes 
as well; this is very important.  The world that you live in is a reflection of 
who you are inside.  In other words, change that blueprint of who you are 
inside and suddenly the world around you changes in amazing and wonderful 
ways.   
 
Here’s a simple example of what I mean straight from the psychological 
literature.   
 
How Long Will You Live? 
There is a quirky fact that a lot of people aren’t aware of which is, if you 
happen to have very young grandparents, let’s say that your parents 
married young and had you quite young, chances are you will live a lot 
longer and be much more active in old age than if you had so-called old 
grandparents.   
 
If your grandparents were still in their, say, 40s or maybe even 50s when 
you were born versus grandparents who were in their 60s or 70s there is a 
difference in terms of the blueprint that sits inside the mind.   
 
Grandparents, inside the unconscious, are a symbol for what old age is 
meant to be like.  If your grandparents were very old, the symbols are of 
weakness, ill health those sort of things and of not a very long life span; 
because chances are they died within a certain amount of time.   
 
If, on the other hand, your grandparents were quite young that means the 
symbol you have inside, the blueprint you have inside for old age is one full 
of vigor, much more life and more time left before the inevitable decline.   
 
The Key Secret: Change The Blueprint! 
So we're going to use the same blueprint, the same natural law, in order to 
achieve the things you want.  You're not stuck.  If you happen to have had 
old grandparents, it doesn't mean that you have to pass away earlier than 
someone who had young grandparents.   
 
All it means is, you have to work a little bit more to change the blueprint 
inside yourself and then you get to live just as long, just as healthy and just 
as happily as someone who happened to luck out when it comes to that sort 
of thing.

The same is true about anything you approach in life.   
 
Rich people find it easier to be rich; because that’s the attitude, mindset and 
experiences they’ve grown up around.  Those things are part of the blueprint 
now, so even if they lose their fortunes, finding their way back tends to be 
easier for them than someone who’s always been poor, because that is a 
different blueprint.   
However, we know you're not stuck.  How do we know this?  There are 
plenty of people who have made it from rags to riches.  Who grew up in the 
poorest of the poor neighborhoods, decided never again and totally re-
conditioned their minds, changing their blueprint so they end up having wild 
riches and successes.   
 
You can do that for yourself in any part of your life with the power of self-
hypnosis method that we’ll be discussing over the next seven days.  This 
method is going to be your key for unlocking the goldmine that’s waiting 
inside you.   
 
Your mind has hidden talents and abilities, amazing talents that if you only 
learn to activate them will not only make your life easy and more fun, it will 
get you everything you’ve always desired.  Within reason, it can make every 
dream come true.   
 
Track 4 – The Infinite Possibilities Of The Mind 
Time: 7m 35s 
 
I’d like for you to realize and begin to understand that anything is truly 
possible or shall we say almost anything.  If your aim in life is to grow wings 
and fly, well I’m not the person to help you with that, but if we come to 
something that human beings have achieved in the past, then you can do 
the same thing.   
 
Health 
Healing is a natural part of what your body does anyway.  There’s an old 
saying, ‘that the doctor dresses the wounds, but God heals it.’  Inside you, 
you have that power, that force that makes things heal and become re-
aligned.

Your genetic makeup knows how your body is meant to fit together and 
knows how to make it well again once something happens to make it all go 
awry.   
Wealth 
The same is true for wealth, abundance or success in your life.  Some of you 
may have heard what’s called the Law of Attraction of how to attract good 
things to yourself.  Have you noticed how some people seem to be 
magnetized?  Good things come to them no matter where they happen to 
be.   
 
A businessman finds business deals all over the place.  A salesman finds 
people wanting to buy their product without even having to look for them. 
What are these people doing?   
 
There’s a part of your mind called the reticular activating system.  It’s a 
connection of neurological centers which keeps you awake during the 
daytime, but more than that it keeps your mind alert and looking for certain 
things.   
 
If you’ve ever bought a car only to find that everyone in your town seems to 
be driving the same car suddenly or bought a dress only to find that every 
woman seems to be wearing it, you’ll know the kind of effect I’m talking 
about.   
 
Basically, making an important decision like that has stimulated their 
reticular activating system to look for certain things to look for certain 
information that was there all along, but your mind ignored, deleted or put it 
out of your way.   
 
Success 
So people who are lucky or are successful in life, all they’ve done is re-
programmed the reticular activating system to pay attention of certain kinds 
of information so that when they come, they pay attention to them, they 
spot them, take the opportunity and suddenly here’s another success waiting 
to happen.   
 
If you like the analogy, think of it as someone who’s running around with 
their eyes closed in the world.  All around them the air is filled with little 
golden tickets.  From time to time if they're lucky and hold their hands out,

one of these golden tickets will land in the palm of their hand and people will 
think “Wow! That’s amazing. I'm so lucky. Look at this bit of good fortune 
that’s happened to me.”   
 
Other people are walking through life with their eyes wide open.  They can 
see the tickets around them and they just have to walk over to where there 
are more of them, hold their hands out and pluck them out of thin air, 
because they're always there; opportunities constantly exist.   
 
Good Luck 
Whether they're opportunities for good or bad things, they constantly exist 
around us.  It’s a question of what we're paying attention to and what we're 
making the most of that decides what we get out of life. 
 
Again, here’s a great example to illustrate this point.  There was an 
interesting TV show on British television some years ago in which they 
decided to carry out an experiment on luck and success.  They brought in a 
bunch of volunteers.  Half of whom are self-professed lucky people that 
make good business deals, win lottery tickets and good things always 
happen to them.   
 
The other half were self-professed losers and bad things always happened, 
no matter where they go.  If they go on holiday they’ll break their leg, end 
up in the hospital and have a horror story to tell, that’s the kind of thing 
we're talking about.   
 
To test these people they put them through different kinds of experiments 
one of them was particularly interesting.  They asked these people to go and 
meet someone in a particular coffee shop.   
 
In order to get this coffee shop they had to walk down one particular road, 
which had been set up with hidden cameras.  On this road they placed a £50 
(pounds sterling) note, like a $100 bill.  Some were lying in the street and 
one of those scratch cards with another hundred dollars, already pre-
scratched with the winning numbers already exposed again, scrunched up 
and lying on the ground.  That’s the set up.   
 
Then they observed to find out what these people do when they walk past it.  
Without exception all of the lucky people, walking down the street, are 
walking along, you can kind of see them do a double take, look down, they

see something, they stop and investigate, pick it up and whoa presto, 
they're $100 richer.   
 
The interesting thing is, with the unlucky people the exact opposite thing 
happened.   
 
They were walking down the street and didn't even notice these things.  In 
fact, one person noticed the hundred dollar bill and you can literally see him 
mentally shaking his head as though saying to himself “No, that’s just too 
good to be true” and without bothering to investigate he walks off.   
 
This is the power that your mind has.  You can re-program your mind to find 
the opportunities, find successes, to find the luck in your life as simply and 
as easily and naturally as those lucky people do.   
 
Happiness 
The same is true for keys to happiness.   
 
I’ve traveled the globe.  I’ve been to Asia, South America and I’ve seen 
some of the poorest countries in the world.  Ironically, it’s the poorer 
countries, in which people tend to be happiest.  Now that doesn't make 
sense!   
 
They don’t have TVs and video recorders. Some of them have trouble 
figuring out how they're going to eat the next day and yet people just seem 
to be happy.  I’m not suggesting that poverty makes you happy, by no 
means.  The difference is that these people had an attitude.   
 
They chose to be happy.   
 
There is a culture of happiness and that just goes to prove again what 
people have said throughout the ages.  People are just as happy as they 
make their minds up to be.   
 
With the power of self-hypnosis at your fingertips, you can be as deliriously 
happy as you want to be in life.  Now we get to change everything from the 
inside so that you get to look outside for yourself and find the confirmation, 
find those happy moments just as those lucky people found the extra cash 
and found good relationships inside their lives.

Friendship 
The same is true of friends.  Finding more friends is just a question of your 
attitude.  Everyone loves hanging around people with good energy, a good 
vibe who are friendly and happy.  So when your happiness goes up your 
ability to find and make new friends goes up.   
 
You know the old expression, “misery loves company”?  Well it’s true.  The 
more miserable you become, the more you try and make people around you 
miserable, guess what?  You’ll be pushing away all those potential friends 
because people don’t want to be that way.   
 
Do you know the old expression, “laugh and the world laughs with you, cry 
and you cry alone”?  There’s a lot of truth in these sayings.  So whether your 
aim in life is to kick start your natural healing mechanism, to attract wealth, 
abundance and success, to have friends and be happier; whether you want 
more wisdom or to solve problems, the keys lie inside you already.   
 
Over the next seven days I’m going to teach you step by step how to use 
the Power of Self-Hypnosis Method to make all these things part of your life 
now; so as you have these master keys you get to use them for anything 
that you want, which puts you in charge.   
 
You are ultimately the person who decides how your life should be, what you 
should have more of in life and what you want to cut out of your life.   
 
Track 5 – Important Concepts In Self-Hypnosis 
Time: 24m 40s 
 
Before we dive into the program, I’d like to talk a little bit about some of the 
concepts and ideas we’ll be using throughout this program -- just so you 
understand what we're talking about.   
 
The Two Minds (Conscious & Unconscious) 
First of all, we’ll talk about the concept of different minds, the conscious and 
the unconscious mind.  When I use these concepts please bear in mind that 
I'm using them as a way of making distinctions about things so you can 
understand things more clearly.

In reality there’s just you.  You are you.  You have one mind and that’s it 
that’s who you are.  That mind has different functions, abilities and 
capacities.  They are different specialties if you like, which I'm going to use 
the terms conscious and unconscious minds for so that you can understand 
what part or what aspects of your mind I’m talking about.   
 
The Conscious Mind 
When people talk about the conscious mind we're talking about your 
everyday normal state of awareness.  The conscious mind is quite limited.  It 
can handle between five and nine bits of information and the magic number 
is seven plus or minus two.   
 
It’s very good at planning things.  It’s good at taking a mental trip to the 
future and breaking things down to steps in between to make sure that it 
can get there.  So without a conscious mind, you wouldn’t be able to plan 
effectively and, without planning, you’d be left in this halfway world where 
not too many things work out.   
 
The beauty of the conscious mind is it’s all about self-awareness.  If you had 
no conscious mind, you wouldn’t be able to appreciate a beautiful scene.  
You couldn’t fall in love and know you're doing it.  You couldn’t appreciate or 
stand back after having done a hard bit of work or look at it and be proud of 
what you’ve accomplished.   
 
So your conscious mind is very important.  It allows you to appreciate the 
good things in life and it allows you to decide, “What is it that I want more 
of?”  It’s also the place where you reason; so reason and logic rests in the 
conscious mind and it’s a very valuable skill to have.   
 
Western society is built around a lot of conscious mind skills, logical 
reasoning skills about planning things and following through, working things 
out and that kind of thing.   
 
 
There are certain kinds of problems that the conscious mind is great at 
resolving.  If you have that kind of problem in your life chances are you’ve 
already resolved it and have forgotten all about it.  That’s why you have a 
conscious mind.  It does it, solves it, done, dusted, on you go.

The Unconscious Mind 
On the other hand you also have an unconscious mind and that is a treasure 
house of wisdom, insight, memories, learning, experiences all kinds of 
wonderful things -- as well as unpleasant things as well.   
 
A nice analogy between the conscious and the unconscious mind is to 
imagine a captain, his boat and crew.  The captain is the conscious mind.  
The captain is there to set the direction and tell everyone else what to do.   
 
The captain’s role is not to do everything.  It would be ridiculous to go down 
into the boiler room and push more coal into the steamer.  It would be 
ridiculous for him to be running around on all the decks scrubbing the floors, 
trying to steer the boat at the same time, paint the ship and make the meals 
and all the other activities.  That’s what the crew is for.   
 
The crew, the pilot, the ship itself, that’s your unconscious mind.  Your 
unconscious is there to run your body.  It’s there to make sure you survive 
and thrive in your environment.   
 
Emotions 
Your unconscious mind is a place where emotions come from.  Emotions are 
the fuel to drive us.  With no emotions you have no drive, you have no 
ability to do or achieve anything.  In fact, with no emotions you’d probably 
end up getting depressed and dying.  That’s what depression is.   
 
Depression is a natural mechanism to basically cut out all emotions so that 
you don’t have to feel the negative ones.  That can be very useful in the 
short-term.  If bad things are happening around you, a little bit of 
depression calms everything right down and you don’t have to be affected 
by it too much.  In the long-term it’s not useful at all.   
 
At that point the captain, the conscious mind has to start making decisions 
about what you get to feel and what not.  Here’s the irony, the captain can’t 
make you feel anything.  He can’t choose to feel happy or sad, but he can 
give instructions.   
 
The unconscious mind is like a faithful, loving servant.  It’s eager to please.  
It’s like a puppy running around asking to be taught a new trick.

Repression 
The unconscious mind is the place where emotions are stored.  It’s also the 
place where negative experiences are hidden away, the mechanism is called 
repression.   
 
Again, a wonderful tool, because there are some things in your life that you 
need never look at again and you’ll be a happier person for it.  If that 
mechanism is going overboard or making your life miserable then the 
captain goes to the side and says: “Hang on a second!  This is no good. 
Whatever that area of life is that you're protecting, it’s time to blow off some 
steam.  Let’s some of that stuff out we can handle it now.” 
 
Another important principle is that your whole mind and body tends toward 
health and you know this to be true.   
 
Natural Healing 
If you cut yourself, what happens?  Your body naturally heals the wound.  
The blood starts coagulating, you create a little wound on the top and before 
you know it that falls off and you have clean, healthy skin underneath it 
again.  How do you do that?  You have no idea, but the body knows how to 
do it.   
 
It tends toward health and balance.  If the room gets too hot you start 
sweating to cool down.  Why?  Because if your internal organs get too hot 
they start cooking and you can’t live anymore, so your body is designed to 
keep a certain level of balance, to keep you healthy and if you get injured in 
some way, to repair the damage so you can get on with your life.   
 
The same is true of your emotional and intellectual life.  There are events in 
everyone’s history that are unpleasant.  These events can sometimes be 
frozen in time and you can forget about them.  If you can live your life 
happily without ever going back to them, great.   
 
To the extent that they start interfering in your present life, you get to direct 
your unconscious to go back inside that bubble and clean it up.  So that by 
the time you've finished with it you're a healthy, happy and vibrant human 
being.

Reclaim Your Vitality 
As a rule: whenever you are lacking energy, you have not enough life, 
enthusiasm or zest for things -- you want to look at some kind of bubble 
inside you that’s trapping the emotional energy trying to protect you from 
something, because that is where the pain is going to be.   
 
When you burst that bubble in a way that’s safe for you, you're going to be 
able to bring up all kinds of abilities, extra energy and enthusiasm, 
creativity, spontaneity, problem-solving skills that you didn't even know 
existed.  You have to be able to direct your mental energies to burst those 
bubbles to reclaim that power.   
 
Memories & Wisdom 
The unconscious mind is also the place of storing your memories.  It’s the 
place where all of your experience is stored, wisdom and your understanding 
about the world and the way it works.   
 
Think of it this way.  Think of your telephone number for a moment.  Where 
did that number come from?  If you're honest about it, you don’t know.  It’s 
just there when you need it that’s how the unconscious mind works.   
 
It stores information, when you need it and it brings it up to you.  Some 
information is easy to get to like a telephone number.  Some information is 
difficult to get to, but you’ll get to it with a little bit of working.  Other 
information is very difficult to get to unless you know certain tricks and 
techniques to get at it.   
 
We're not so much interested in memory as such.  We're interested in the 
experiences and the wisdom that those memories represent.  
 
Unconscious Learning 
There’s something called pre-conscious learning.  Most of your life, most of 
the things that are valuable in your life, you learned without ever knowing 
how you learned to do it.   
 
For example, nodding and shaking your head is a classic non-verbal signal 
and we don’t know how we picked it up.  There are societies in which

shaking and nodding your head doesn't mean the same things as they mean 
in the western world.   
 
The truth is that we pick these things up as children.  When we watch our 
parents and friends interacting we very quickly pick up the message that 
certain nuances, a raised eyebrow, a frown, a tension in the body, a shaking 
of the head, a loud noise these mean certain things, but no one told us what 
they should mean.  We just kind of picked it up from the environment.   
 
Here’s a great example from Childhood Psychology.  This is quite a 
scatological example, but I think it makes the point quite nicely.   
 
Infants don’t understand the world outside them too much so they have no 
real aversions except for things like sudden motion and loud noises.  For 
example, an infant will quite happily play with manure, it’s own or someone 
else’s, and not know any different.   
 
Somewhere along the line children learn that certain things aren’t to be 
played with and are to be avoided.  They way they learn that is again by 
adult’s reactions.  When a child makes some potty humor at the table, the 
adults scrunch up their nose, pull back and make a certain gesture, which 
over time the child learns is one of disgust.  It’s basically of aversion.  It 
creates a taboo.   
 
By the time a child is two or three years old you can get a little piece of 
chocolate formed in the shape of a dog turd, put it on a plate and the child 
will refuse to eat it even if it knows that it’s chocolate just because of the 
shape that its assumed.   
 
Why? Because it triggers all of those unconscious learning mechanisms, 
which are inside. This, by the way, shows us how we get stuck in life.   
 
We Didn’t Choose Our Blueprints! 
A lot of the patterns that we run in life we haven’t chosen!  We’ve adopted 
them and learned them from the people around us.  A classic example is a 
phobia.   
 
For example, a fear of spiders, a fear of cats or dogs -- a lot of these things 
are things that people haven’t developed themselves.  The classic way a 
phobia develops is a dog bites a young child and that stays in the memory.

It grows larger over the lifetime so by the time the adult is there even a 
small Chihuahua will trigger a panic attack.   
 
Some people don’t have any negative experiences in their life and still have 
a phobia.  How does that happen?  If that happens then look to the parents, 
chances are the mother, father or someone close in the family had a strong 
aversion to spiders, dogs, cats, whatever it is and that was passed on in the 
same way as the taboo around dog turds got passed on to little children.   
 
It happens unconsciously, which is called pre-conscious learning in the 
psychological literature and it abounds in everything that we do.  Many pre-
conscious learning things are great for us.  It frees us up and makes us able 
to live life and thrive.     
 
Pre-conscious learning has helped us learn things like table manners, how to 
treat other people, how to be respectful, how to tell certain emotions from 
people, how to read certain people, how to expect or predict certain 
experiences.  Without pre-conscious learning you wouldn’t know how to 
open a door, because every time you met a new door you’d have to figure 
out: what the hell is this thing and how to I use it? 
 
Your ability to have these patterns inside forms a tremendous resource.  It 
can also form a tremendous chain around your neck if it happens to be 
negative patterns.   
 
Rewrite The Blueprint To Suit You! 
With the power of self-hypnosis at your fingertips you get to root out those 
chains and link by link destroy them so that you are freer than you’ve ever 
felt before, you have more energy that you’ve had before and you have all 
of the good things you’ve always wanted to have inside your life.   
 
The Tortoise & The Hare 
There’s an important principle when it comes to unconscious process that 
you should be aware of and that is the speed at which the unconscious 
works.  The unconscious mind is very strange in that it works both at 
lightning fast rates and incredibly slowly at the same time.

You Are Half A Second Behind Reality 
For example, your unconscious mind will be aware of what’s going on in the 
world about a half a second before you are consciously aware of anything.  
This time lapse in conscious is just a natural part of the way human beings 
work.   
 
What you think is happening right now isn’t happening right now it happened 
about a half a second ago and is an illusion of consciousness that’s created 
inside the mind so you think it’s happening in real time.   
 
That’s why true sports stars and people, who are very good at things 
basically, are relying on their unconscious mind to do the work; because you 
don’t have that half a second to spare when you're in the middle of a 
competition.  You have to let your unconscious mind do the work and then 
just have this overseeing function to make sure that it’s all going in the 
direction you want it to go.   
 
That half a second delay is vital, because in that half second your 
unconscious mind decides what you’re going to be aware of, what it’s going 
to let you realize is happening.   
 
In that half a second all those unlucky people got to forget about the fact 
that a $100 bill or a £50 note in this case was stuck in a crack in the 
pavement.  In that half a second the lucky people got that little bit of 
information that said pay more attention to this corner of the street, because 
something good is happening here.  That half a second is everything.   
 
You Will Be The Last Person To Notice Changes 
By the same token, there is an old principle, which is you're the last person 
to notice change.  Have you ever noticed this?  When you're a child and your 
auntie would come to visit maybe come back after two months and tell you 
how much you’ve grown.  You go, “I don't know, have I really”?  Then you 
measure yourself again the door and, sure enough, you're two inches taller.   
 
The same is true about emotional changes and about change in character.  
In fact, it’s true of physical changes.  You go to the gym and workout for two 
months and you don’t really see the changes.  Yet people look at you 
differently, they start notice things differently especially if they haven’t seen 
you for a while, because they see the contrast.

The reason I mention these things is because of the principles I want you to 
pay attention to when you're using the Power of Self-Hypnosis program for 
yourself.   
 
Bet On The Tortoise Every Time 
If we want to use another analogy, remember the tortoise and the hare that 
had a race?  Who ends up winning the race?  The tortoise although everyone 
would think the smart money would be on the hare.  This is how our minds 
work.   
 
The conscious mind is like the hare, it’s constantly jumping and racing 
around the place, jumping to conclusions and making things happen. Now 
that’s a wonderful attribute to have and I’m not knocking it.   
 
The unconscious mind particularly when it comes to goals, on the other 
hand, is much more like the tortoise.  It takes time to wind up, get itself into 
gear and get his thing going.  Once it’s doing its thing, the irony is the 
unconscious mind will win the race every time more quickly than the 
conscious mind ever could.   
 
So the smart money is in the tortoise, on the unconscious.  The key thing 
you must allow the unconscious to have is time to do its work.  It took time 
for the blueprint that you have inside yourself to be set and it will take time 
to allow that blueprint to be changed.   
 
It’s true, a competent therapist, particularly a hypnotherapist will be able to 
change your blueprint quickly, sometimes in as little as a half an hour to an 
hour.  That’s absolutely true.  But there are certain problems that occur in 
self-hypnosis that you can’t bypass, unless you have another person guiding 
you through it.   
 
The way we make up for it is by allowing the tortoise to do its thing, to wind 
up the energizer bunny, get it going on its path and letting it do its thing.   
 
The Gatekeeper 
There’s one part of the mind we haven’t discussed yet and that’s called the 
gatekeeper.  The gatekeeper is attached to the conscious mind and, as the 

 
                                      The Power of Self-Hypnosis for Guaranteed

name implies, is a gatekeeper between what happens in the outside world 
and what you allow inside.   
 
The function of the gatekeeper is very simple.  It’s basically to keep things 
the same.  Its purpose in life is to make your life easier by rejecting 
information that doesn't match the blueprint you already have inside.  In 
this way, you don’t have to keep making new decisions.   
 
For example, every time you see a new door you know how to use it  
because your gatekeeper will trash anyone that says: “That’s not a door, it’s 
a flying saucer!” or “It’s an alien ready to eat up your hand”.   
 
Children Borrow Adult Gatekeepers 
If you tell that to a little child, and that child trusts you, chances are they’ll 
believe the door is out to bite their hand off, because that’s what children 
do.  They have no gatekeeper yet!  They borrow a trusted adult’s gatekeeper 
and will believe what that adult says.   
 
How The Gatekeeper Creates A Rut 
The gatekeeper is designed to keep information out -- which is tremendously 
useful when someone tries to persuade you of stupid things like “Jump off a 
building and you’ll fly!” or “Don’t touch that door, because it will eat you 
up.”.  But, it’s also very harmful when it keeps you stuck with a blueprint or 
an aspect of the blueprint that you don’t want anymore.   
 
The Gatekeepers Weapons 
The gatekeeper has some very powerful tools at its disposal, which include 
emotions like fear, doubt and anger.  These are psychological defense 
mechanisms to automatically reject information.  Sometimes laughter is part 
of our doubt as well; we just laugh at people saying “That’s ridiculous!”, “It’s 
absurd!” and “It’s not realistic!”   
 
These are all classic gatekeeper tools to keep information out.  You know 
this has happened because in the past you’ve given people advice.  Those 
people will reject it out of hand and say “No, that’s not possible, because of 
these reasons.” or “I’ve tried that and it doesn't work.”

You know for a fact that your advice is good because you’ve done it, seen 
other people do it and it works.  Why haven’t they taken it on board? 
Because the gatekeeper is not allowing them to take it on board.   
 
Silence The Gatekeeper! 
Therefore, your task as a self-hypnotist is to get that gatekeeper out of 
action, out of commission so that you can go straight to the unconscious 
mind, to where the blueprint is, and start changing that blueprint to make it 
a richer, healthier and happier blueprint. 
 
Willpower Does Not Exist! 
The final concept I want to talk about is the idea of willpower.  A lot of 
people think they need to have willpower to change.  I WILL go to the gym.  
I WILL force myself to do this.  I WILL stop smoking.  I WILL lose weight.  I 
WILL go to lectures.  I WILL do my homework and so on.   
 
The problem with willpower is -- believe it or not -- willpower does not exist!  
It’s a fiction of the imagination.  We’ve made it up.  What exists is attention 
at the conscious and unconscious level. 
 
Attention – Not Willpower 
With your conscious attention you can override the unconscious attention.  
In other words you can always override what the unconscious mind is doing 
and that’s what some people consider to be willpower.   
 
If you decide you're going to go to the gym, but you feel bad about it, you're 
conscious attention might say, “No, I’m still going to go. You go there, you 
make yourself do it and force yourself to do it.”   
 
Now, while your attention is active and engaged in what you're doing -- 
you're doing fine.  The problem with that kind of attention is that the 
conscious mind is limited, remember?  It can only think of five to nine bits of 
information at any one time.  So the moment you get distracted, guess what 
happens?  Your willpower disappears.

You Are NOT Weak Willed! 
If you're a smoker, the moment you're distracted, the cigarette ends up in 
your hand because you're unconscious attention is now allowed free to roam 
and do its natural thing, which is the blueprint says you smoke, so you 
smoke.   
 
The same is true if you're doing a diet.  When your willpower breaks, when 
your attention gets distracted, what happens?  You find yourself in the 
fridge, opening it up, that cheesecake in hand ready to much away. Why? 
Because that’s part of your blueprint.   
 
It’s not that you're weak willed or you can’t change; it’s purely you're using 
the wrong part of your mind to try and make a change.  You're putting your 
attention in the wrong place.   
 
The Secret To Powerful Changes 
Attention, believe it or not, is the key to making changes.  It’s just a 
question of where to put attention to rewrite the blueprint so that the 
unconscious attention ends up giving you everything you’ve wanted out of 
life.   
 
Essentially, what we're activating is the third law of the mind: perception is 
projection.  In other words, whatever is inside your blueprint is how you’ll 
make the world around you conform to it.   
 
Where Attention Goes Energy Flows 
There’s another principle, which we’ll use in the Power of Self-Hypnosis 
Method to make changes at the unconscious level.  Change the unconscious 
attention, the unconscious blueprint and thereby change your life.  It’s called 
the attention principle; it’s the second principle.   
 
When you change the flow of your attention energy goes to some other part 
of your mind and as energy goes to that part of the mind it blossoms and 
grows.  When it grows enough, the blueprint is different.   
 
Here are a couple of examples of what I mean.  Think of someone you like 
right now or a situation you like.  When you think about that person or 
situation what happens?  You feel good, right?

If you think about someone you dislike, a situation or person that gets your 
back up, what happens?  You feel bad.  This is not rocket science we all 
know this, but notice just by shifting your attention you’ve changed your 
mood.   
 
Contradictions Exist In Your Blueprint 
When you go to the gym something else happens.  A lot of people find it 
only difficult to get the decision to go to the gym.  Once they're actually at 
the gym and their body starts moving it activates a different set of resources 
or memories and the body starts feeling good again.   
 
The endorphins kick in and they start naturally feeling the happy vibe and 
they start to ask themselves: “Why did I have a problem coming here? This 
is fantastic!.”  That again, shows how the unconscious level you can have 
completely paradoxical blueprints and they get laid one over the other.   
 
While you are at home you have the top layer of the blueprint, which says 
avoid the gym, it’s too much effort.  Once you're at the gym that layer gets 
peeled away and there’s another program or blueprint that says when your 
body is moving in this way you love it; it feels great and therefore do more 
of it.   
 
Of course, that’s an unconscious conflict at that point.  When you have that 
conflict, that’s why you can feel terrible before you go to the gym and feel 
great once you're there.   
 
Wouldn’t it make more sense to simply change the top layer of the blueprint 
so you can feel as good about going to the gym as you feel afterwards for 
having been there?   
 
That’s what the power of self-hypnosis gives you the ability to do: it gives 
you the ability to change the unconscious blueprint, to change the 
unconscious attention because at that point, naturally, all the energy goes in 
the direction that you want it to go.  It’s streamlined.  Life becomes easy, 
natural and effortless.  No willpower, no forcing and no unpleasantness 
required.

Use The Right Mind For A Change 
This is, incidently, why so many people have failed in things in the past. It’s 
because they're using the wrong mind to solve their problem.  If the 
problem is lodged in the unconscious, then you’ll need to get to the 
unconscious to solve the problem.   
 
By changing the level where the problem exists that’s where you create true 
freedom.  That’s why the power of self-hypnosis can totally transform your 
life.  You don’t need it to solve those problems you can already solve, 
because you’ve already solved them.   
 
You’ll need it to solve those problems you haven’t been able to solve yet.   
We’ll show you where to go inside your mind to make that happen.  You're 
going to use the laws of the mind.  You're going to silence this gatekeeper 
and then we're going to give you the tools so you can rewrite the blueprint 
any way you want to.   
 
Track 6 – Misconceptions About Self-Hypnosis 
Time: 7m 11s 
 
I want to clear up some misconceptions, concerns or questions people tend 
to have about hypnosis so that you can dedicate yourself fully to the process 
that we have prepared for you.   
 
The Four Big Questions 
The four big concerns shall people have are… 
 
Will I get stuck in hypnosis?   
Is it safe?   
Will it make my mind weaker?   
Can anyone do it or do I have the capacity to do it?   
 
I’d like to address those questions one by one, all in one go.

Hypnosis Is Natural 
Hypnosis, self-hypnosis in particular, is one of the most natural states in the 
world.  In fact, you will spontaneously fall into self-hypnosis or little trances 
throughout the day without even realizing it that’s why you have the 
capacity to change your life.   
 
Things happen in life, you hit this little mini-hypnotic experience and that 
experience that allows you to internalize it, it changes the blueprint subtly, 
which means the next day you're not quite the same way.  You repeat these 
mini-trances over a period of time and from one year to the next you're a 
different person that’s how it works.   
 
The experiences build up waiting for a mini-trance to occur for you to have 
those experiences pop into the unconscious, re-write the blueprint and by 
the time the gatekeeper is awoken up again you’ve changed and you're a 
different person.   
 
So the first thing to realize is it’s totally natural, which means anyone can do 
it if you're an adult, in fact, if you're a teenager and have made it this far 
then you can do it.  You could not have survived without the ability to go 
into hypnosis or self-hypnosis and make those changes.   
 
You Cannot Get Stuck! 
Hopefully, understanding this natural phenomenon we’ll show you how it’s 
impossible to ever get stuck in it.  How can you get stuck?  Can you get 
stuck in sleep?  No.  There’s no Sleeping Beauty that sleeps forever. 
Eventually your body will find a natural cycle to come back out again.   
 
You’ve hit all of these mini-trances throughout your life anyway and you’ve 
always come back, because your body knows how to do it.  The worst thing 
that can happen to you in self-hypnosis, and it’s something to look out for, is 
that you can fall asleep.  You fall asleep, have a great rest then wake up 
refreshed and revitalized.   
 
The only problem about falling asleep is maybe you fell asleep before you 
had the chance to change the blueprint, in which case you are going to have 
to do it again.  Sometimes you fall asleep after you’ve influenced the 
blueprint, which is the perfect set of conditions.  We’ll talk more on that 
later.

For the moment just realize it’s totally natural, you can not get stuck and it’s 
totally safe.   
 
You Won’t Harm Yourself 
For those Freudians among you who think that the unconscious is this pit of 
evil full of seething desires that have to be repressed: well, there is an 
element of your mind that is that way.  The vast superior element of your 
mind is a healthy, happy, powerful place. It functions beautifully.   
 
The Unconscious Maintains Balance 
It keeps you alive in a way that is so complex that even scientists now don’t 
fully appreciate how it works.  It keeps your blood pumping, your heart 
beating, temperature at exactly the right level and it moves the blood flow 
from the core to the external based on what happens to be needed.   
 
Do the muscles need more blood flow?  Is it too hot or too cold?  It gets you 
to sweat when you need to sweat and heat up when you need to heat up.  It 
chills you to put on more layers, it starts shivering to keep warmth in.   
 
It changes your emotions to motivate you to do things that are good for you 
and changes them back to stop you from doing things that are bad for you. 
All dependent on that blueprint, which is inside.   
 
It keeps your blood sugar levels constant.  When food comes into your 
mouth it knows how to chew it, how to use the right kind of elements of 
saliva to start digesting it, how to digest it in your stomach, how to move it 
through your internal system, draw the nutrients out and expel the waste.   
 
 
If you take poison, it knows how to regurgitate it before it does any harm.  
If it enters your system it knows how to draw the poisons out of your system 
that’s what your liver is for and to a certain extent, what your kidneys are 
for also.   
 
Your body is a beautiful, sophisticated, complicated machine and it requires 
something to keep it going.  Your unconscious mind has done that.

The Unconscious Protects You From Harm 
Moreover, your unconscious mind has protected your conscious mind from 
all kinds of things that you're not ready to handle yet.   
 
It protects you from emotions.  If trauma happens, it packs it away in cotton 
wool until some later date until you are ready to deal with it, not now when 
you're in the middle of living your life.  It protects you mentally just the 
same way as it protects your physically.   
 
Think of it: Everyone has had an experience of a near accident, which has 
been narrowly avoided.  How does it happen?  You're driving along, before 
you know it, somehow you swerve the car or change lanes and you keep 
driving along.  
 
It takes a second or two for your mind to catch up and realize that the car in 
front of you just suddenly stopped.  You did exactly the right things without 
thinking about it, on automatic pilot, the exact right things to keep you safe, 
healthy and alive.  That is your unconscious mind at work and that is the 
power that’s been protecting you for your entire life.   
 
When you use self-hypnosis you open a window of opportunity to talk 
directly to that part of your mind without interference.  If it’s been protecting 
you your entire life why on Earth, would it stop now?  
 
It won’t!!  
 
Self-Hypnosis Is Safe 
Self-hypnosis is totally safe because those defense mechanisms are still 
there, ready to roll and ready to protect you from stuff.  If you're not ready 
to handle something yet then you have to work hard to get to the point 
where you can handle it and then the memory, the conditions and the ideas 
will allow themselves to surface.   
 
We're going to show you how to do that and how to do that safely on day 
five.  For the moment realize that no matter what you do, you will be totally 
safe, because your mind has protected you your whole life and it’s going to 
continue doing so for the rest of your life.

In self-hypnosis it does an even better job, because now you get to have 
interplay of consciousness.  Your conscious understandings get to influence 
your unconscious blueprint to create a healthier blueprint to get a better, 
stronger and more vibrant life for you.   
 
Self-Hypnosis Makes You Stronger 
As to the final question, will it weaken my mind or my willpower?  Hopefully 
by now you will see just how ridiculous that question is.  It just simply won’t 
happen.  Your unconscious mind is there to protect you.   
 
Why would it make your mind weaker?  If anything it gives you more power 
to control yourself, to control your destiny, your body, speed up healing, 
improve your memory, learning rate, friendships, happiness, health, 
success; all that is open to you when you master the power of self-hypnosis.   
 
Does that make you weaker?  No.  It makes you stronger.  If that is 
weakness, if living a healthy, vibrant and happy life where all of the good 
things come to you and you get to choose what you want out of life, if that’s 
a weakness then please make me weaker, because that’s something that I 
want.   
 
Track 7 – An Overview Of Your 7 Day Program 
Time: 12m 32s 
 
Before we finish today’s session, I’d like to talk a little about what you can 
expect from this program.  In the next seven days you're going to get a solid 
foundation on how to use the power of self-hypnosis in your life.   
 
Practical Techniques Not Theory 
We're going to leave no stone unturned.  We're going to focus purely on the 
practical aspects, the techniques you need to do so you can use self-
hypnosis in your life to achieve any outcome you want.  We're not going to 
go into too much theory, no more than you’ll need to, to understand what 
you're doing.

We’ll show you how to make it work for you and how to overcome the typical 
problems of why self-hypnosis has failed for other people, because I want 
you to succeed with this.   
 
The power of self-hypnosis is such an amazing force for good in your life and 
other people’s lives, because when your life gets transformed and you're a 
happy, strong, healthy individual that attitude exudes from you and affects 
other people as well.  It infects other people.   
 
Remember we talked about pre-conscious learning?  People will 
unconsciously learn from you how to be happier and healthier just by 
hanging around you.  Isn’t that something worth aiming for?   
 
Day 1 – The Amazing Power Of Self-Hypnosis 
Later on in this session we're going to take you through a little process to 
keep you motivated to go through the entire seven-day program.  Each day 
of the seven-day program puts a little piece of the self-hypnosis puzzle into 
action inside your mind and starts the mechanism working for you. 
 
By the time you finish on day seven you’ll be an expert at self-hypnosis.  
You’ll know how to change problems, change habits, change beliefs, change 
limitations and change your life.   
 
This is day one and we're going to finish day one in a moment with a kind of 
motivational piece to start activating your unconscious mind, getting its 
attention and getting it to want to help out with this whole program.  
Because, after all, you want to have the unconscious mind on board just as 
much as your conscious mind. 
 
Incidentally, if you're excited right now you're in the right place, because 
excitement comes from the unconscious.  If you feel excitement, enthusiasm 
and that sense of “I want this!”, then you're in the right place.  It means you 
have just stimulated the right part of your unconscious attention and that 
enthusiasm is going to steer you through this program.    
 
Day 2 – A Fool Proof Step By Step Method for Hypnotizing Yourself 
Tomorrow, on day two, titled A Fool Proof Step By Step Method for 
Hypnotizing Yourself, we're going to start looking at the magic state of

self-hypnosis and how to get to it.  In reality there’s no magic to self-
hypnosis.  It’s a totally natural and normal function. 
 
We're going to show you step-by-step how to get into self-hypnosis, how to 
do it safely, how to not get stuck or any of these other problems people 
might be afraid of and how to make it work for you.  Already, from the point 
of tomorrow you're going to start conditioning your mind to create a window 
of opportunity.   
 
 
The purpose of using self-hypnosis in terms of the actual hypnotic state is 
purely to open a door to your unconscious and say: “Hey unconscious, time 
to listen up!  Do these things.”  You'll find out exactly how to do that, how to 
condition your mind, how to overcome some of the more common problems 
in tomorrow’s session.   
 
Day 3 – How to Program Your Mind to Get What You Want – Automatically 
Then on day three entitled, How to Program Your Mind to Get What You 
Want Automatically.  We're going to look at the science and art of goals.   
 
We'll use goals in a very different way to most people.  While we look at 
similar formats like smart goals and how to set goals, what goals to set, 
what not to set and how not to set them and that sort of stuff, very valuable 
information.  We’ll use that and go well beyond that, because the thing I’m 
more interested in is: “Why do goals fail?”.   
 
Chances are if you picked up this program you’ve come across some form of 
goal setting mechanism before in the past.  If you’ve done that and have 
given up on it, chances are you don’t know why they failed.  You set those 
goals, you wrote them down, you had them in the positive, you made your 
affirmations yet they failed. Why was that?  That’s exactly the question we’ll 
answer on day three.   
 
More than just asking these questions, I want to show you how to solve 
those problems for yourself so when you set a goal, that goal is realistic and 
is something that is going to enhance your life so you can achieve it.  We're 
going to show you how to do that on day three.

Day 4 – Potent Suggestion Tactics to Quickly Unlock the Power of Your 
Mind 
Then we come on to day four, entitled Potent Suggestion Tactics to 
Quickly Unlock the Power of Your Mind.  Now that you know how to set 
the conditions of your mind, the hypnotic state, you know how to set 
targets, which is what the goal setting day was all about -- now it’s time to 
get some work done.   
 
In order to start changing the blueprint you’ll need some tools and that tool 
is suggestion.  There are many different ways of using suggestions and 
many different ways of using suggestions within the hypnotic state.   
 
We're going to cover the four classic methods of suggestion, show you how 
to use them, how to combine them and how to put them together into a 
simple and effective method to get what you want.   
 
Day 5 – Beyond Self-Hypnosis, How to Connect with Your Unconscious to 
Get What You Truly Desire 
Next we move on to day five, entitled Beyond Self-Hypnosis, How to 
Connect with Your Unconscious to Get What You Truly Desire.  We're 
going to resolve some of the biggest problems with self-hypnosis and goal 
setting in general.   
 
Just as we give you some simple tactics on day three on how to overcome 
typical problems with goals, day five is going to blow all the problems out of 
the water.  We're going to look at how to go directly to the unconscious 
mind, figure out what the problem is and what you can do about it. 
 
So that you're solving the right problems and not the wrong ones, you're 
setting the right goals or goals you think will get you where you want to go 
and you get the unconscious mind to be a partner in the activity rather than 
something that’s going to try and resist you on the way through.   
 
Day 6 – Your Advanced Suggestion Toolkit For The Mind 
Then we come on to day six, a very interesting day.  On day six you learn 
how to overcome some typical problems people have with self-hypnosis.  In 
particular, it’s the problem of holding on too much.

One of the biggest problems of self-hypnosis is that you activate the 
gatekeeper by the conscious mind interfering constantly.  I’ll show you why 
that’s a problem and how to overcome that problem.  We’ll go through four 
classic methods that you can use in your own life, if you find yourself in a 
position where you want to make a change and are at a point where you 
cannot.   
 
So between days four, five and six you’ll have all the tools to deal with all 
the different situations that you can face which might keep you stuck in life.   
 
Whether you deal with day three strategies or day five strategies, it doesn't 
matter you’ll know which tool to use to solve whatever problems are in front 
you, because each tool solves a different kind of problem so you’ll know by 
the end of day six what to use and when to use it.   
 
Day 7 – How to Completely Master the Power of Self-Hypnosis Method and 
Get Incredible Results 
That leaves a day open for day seven, an exciting day.  It’s the final day in 
this program and is entitled How to Completely Master the Power of 
Self-Hypnosis Method and Get Incredible Results.   
 
This is graduation day, the payoff, it’s why you spend all the rest of the 
week going through those exercises, doing the things we’ve been talking 
about and changing at the unconscious level in order to give you the power 
of self-hypnosis in your life.   
 
On day seven we’ll look at how you can take all the tools you’ve learned, all 
the techniques you’ve discovered and apply them to the actual problems 
that you might face in your life, from changing a habit to changing an 
attitude, from sleeping like a log at night to creating the life of your dreams. 
 
A very important part of your graduation of day seven is to give you a 
practice schedule.  One of the biggest reasons why people stop practicing 
self-hypnosis is because they don’t know when and where to do it.  They just 
think: “I’ll do it casually, here or there”, and as a result they fall out of habit.   
 
Self-hypnosis is a habit.  Self-hypnosis is a skill.  Like any other habit or skill 
the more you do it the more it will be there for you when you need it.

On day seven you’ll discover very simple, easy and fun programs, a simple 
schedule you can keep, which takes 10 minutes out of your life, it means the 
power of self-hypnosis will be in your life and be there for you when you 
need it for the rest of your life.   
 
How To Get The Most Out Of This Program 
That’s the seven-day program in a nutshell.   
 
1. Don’t Skip Ahead 
I’m going to encourage you to take your seven days in sequence and not 
skip ahead.  The days are designed to build off each other.  Each day has 
exercises for you to do, which is actually going to recondition your mind in 
certain ways to give you the power of self-hypnosis and make you 
successful.   
 
2. Easy Does It 
Remember, it’s the tortoise that we're going to bet on, not the hare.  Don’t 
rush ahead.  Don’t try to listen to it all ahead of time.  Take your time.  
Listen to each day on the day.  Make sure you do listen to the day, don’t 
skip through.  When you’ve listened to it do the exercises, because it’s not 
just about information you have, it’s about how you let that information 
change you so you have skills in your life.   
 
If you’re getting excited and want to do more, just listen to the same day 
again, because you’ll find on each re-listening nuances or subtleties that 
escaped you the very first time.   
 
3. Feel Free To Review The Program 
It’s part of the way your mind works, as it works and learns in layers, so by 
all means, once you’ve taken yourself all the way through the seven day 
program it can be of tremendous benefit to start again at the end of the 
week and do another week just listening to it an hour a day, wherever you 
happen to be.

4. Listen To “Awaken The Power Of Self-Hypnosis” Every Day 
The key thing is: on day two I’m going to present you with a very important 
procedure.  I’m going to guide you through a hypnotic process designed to 
awaken your power of self-hypnosis inside of you.   
 
The ability is already dormant inside of you.  On day two, I’ll guide you 
through a process that will activate that so you have access to it whenever 
and wherever you want it.   
 
5. Follow The 21 Day Rule 
There’s something we’ll talk about more during the course of this program 
called the 21-Day Rule.  As a rule, if you want to have a skill, if you want to 
have the force of suggestion work in your life, if you want to rewrite the 
blueprint in a way that keeps it rewritten, as a rule you're going to repeat 
the process for 21 days.   
 
So you’ll want to do self-hypnosis for 21 on one topic.  For the next 21 days 
I’m going to ask you to stick to the induction on day two and listen to that 
one whenever it’s time to do your self-hypnosis practice, morning and 
evening, etc.   
 
6. Do The Exercises 
As you listen to the program I’m going to ask you to do additional exercises 
to get you used to certain parts of self-hypnosis.  By all means do those 
additional exercises.  In fact, I want you to do those additional exercises. 
However, when it comes to using the power of self-hypnosis you probably 
have some ideas of what you want to resolve in your life already.   
 
I strongly recommend you spend 21 days listening to the set up instructions 
first, listening to that first induction to awaken the power of self-hypnosis 
inside of you and then turn toward your problems. 
 
You want the ability to be strong, firm and natural inside you before you 
start testing it on real life problems.  Does that mean that you can’t dive into 
real problems and make them work straight away?  No, that’s not the case 
at all.  In fact, many people have done so and had wild successes as well.

The only reason I’m giving you this caveat is in case you do that and the 
problem doesn't get resolved as quickly as you’d like or it doesn't work out 
for you, then don’t take any notes of it.  Just go right back to day two, start 
from scratch and this time listen to the induction on day two for 21 days to 
give the unconscious mind a chance to awaken the power of self-hypnosis in 
you. 
 
Make it a natural part of you and a natural thing you have access to and 
then when you come back and try to resolve your own problems, setting 
your own goals and making the self-hypnosis work for you, you’ll be ready 
for it.   
 
Track 8 – Your Big Dream! 
Time: 5m 37s 
 
We're coming to the end of today’s session.  Before we end it I’d like to take 
you through an exercise to make sure that you can complete this program 
and get the most value out of it.  Remember we talked about that we have 
blueprints and we have to access different levels of that blueprint to keep 
things going within us.   
 
For example, the gym, you go to the gym and once you're there you feel 
great.  It’s getting there that is the problem.   
 
Begin With Success 
I’d like to activate that part of your mind that is going to make you 
successful with self-hypnosis so by the time you get there tomorrow toward 
the actual process of using the power of hypnosis in your own life, your mind 
is already ready to roll and get the results that you want.   
 
You may have heard an old warning, be careful what you wish for, because 
you just might get it.  With the power of self-hypnosis you will get it,  so 
please make sure that whatever it is that you start putting inside there are 
things you really want.

Dream BIG! 
I’m going to encourage you to dream wantonly and I want you to go beyond 
what you think you want to the place where you get totally fulfilled for what 
it is that you do want.   
 
An Example Of Following The Wrong Dream 
Here’s why I say this.  Let me give you an example from my own life.  The 
first time I used the power of self-hypnosis effectively was to land a contract 
with the best law firm in the world.  I was hired as one of their lawyers, they 
paid for my law school and gave me my training and a great start in life.   
 
At the time I thought that was what I wanted.  I used the power of self-
hypnosis to totally focus all my attention to getting that job and I got it.  It 
was a tremendous period in my life, I enjoyed the work I did there and it 
was a great time.   
 
However as time went by, I realized that wasn’t what I wanted in life.  While 
it was giving me some things, it wasn’t giving me other things.  The ability 
to enjoy life, to travel, to learn new things, see different cultures these 
things were very important to me and I had hoped that I would get them as 
a lawyer. You know -- travel to Hong Kong, China, the States, other places 
and work with different people.   
 
The fact was that, while I did travel, it ended up being from one hotel to 
another.  I saw very little of the things that I thought I would, so I had to 
change my game plan.  Each time I changed my game plan I got a little bit 
closer to the fulfilled, happy life that I wanted.   
 
Form – v – True Purpose 
Sometimes you mistake the form of something, the job with a law firm, the 
independent company that you always wanted to start, the lazing on the 
beach somewhere.  You mistake the content of the experience with what you 
actually want, which is the experience, the way you feel, the things you do, 
the creativity and the free flow of energy and life.

Find The Vitality Of A True Purpose 
When you dream I want you to dream big, impossibly big.  When you dream 
impossibly big it connects you to the juice that makes these things work.   
 
It wasn’t that I wanted to be a lawyer.  It’s that I wanted to work with 
people who were smart, work and be challenged, creative, well paid and 
have the good things in life.  These are the things I truly wanted.  I thought 
the law firm would give it to me. 
 
So when you dream big I want you to get in touch with that feeling that you 
have.  What is it that power of self-hypnosis can do for you in your life?  
How will you be in 10 or 20 years time assuming there are no limits?  Dare 
to dream that for a moment.   
 
Feel that energy inside you, because the extent you pay attention to the 
energy and not the content, whether it means you're living in a ten million 
dollar mansion and being fed grapes by personal servants or you're a Nobel 
prize winning scientist, it doesn't matter.  What matters is the energy behind 
each one of those dreams.   
 
Whether you end up being a physicist or a Nobel Prize winning scientist or 
you end up having a ten million dollar mansion or not is totally irrelevant, 
because you’ll end up living like you have that.  The experience you will get 
for having done that is the experience your mind wants.  It’s where the 
juices are and what motivates your unconscious.   
 
In order for you to get the most out of this program I’m going to encourage 
you to dream big.  Find that passion, no matter how big it seems to be and 
allow the enthusiasm of that to totally well up inside you and feel it.  
Connect that passion.   
 
How Will You Feel? 
Ask yourself how will I feel when I have everything I wanted?  The million 
dollar mansion, the Nobel prize, people’s accolades, people recognizing me 
on the street, the collection of works of art, being a creative artists, 
expressing yourself, writing a prize winning novel, it doesn't matter what 
your dream is; dream it and feel it.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         65
Ask yourself a vital question: “How will I feel and who will I be assuming I 
can achieve all of these things?”  Dare to dream it and feel that!   
 
I’m going to ask you to revisit that feeling, that idea, that dream over the 
course of the next seven days over and over again, because in here the 
power of self-hypnosis is going to show you how to achieve something at 
least as good as that.  Let me rephrase that, the power of self-hypnosis is 
going to show you how to achieve something at least as good as that, if not 
better. 
 
With that idea in mind, spend the next 10 or 20 minutes dreaming big, 
feeling big and memorizing in your skin, your bones, your mind every 
nuance of what it feels to project your mind to that place, who you’d be and 
how you’d be.  Let that guide your experience over the next seven days.   
 
Track 9 – End Of Day 
Time: 1m 06s 
 
 
This is the end of day one of the Power of Self-Hypnosis For Guaranteed 
Results Home Study Program.  Make sure you take time to get enthused by 
your big dream and get motivated to practice on your self-hypnosis.   
 
Tomorrow we’ll show you how to easily and reliably go into trance whenever 
you want to.  To ensure your success I’ll even guide you through a powerful 
hypnotic induction to awaken the power of self-hypnosis inside you.   
 
I look forward to seeing you again tomorrow on day two of the Power of

I want you to get connected with an awesome intelligence that you have 
living inside of you.  It’s the power of your unconscious mind.  This power 
has the power to heal your body, heal you from physical harm as well as 
feeling your emotions from emotional or psychological shock.   
 
It has the capacity to make you succeed and be healthy, strong, wealthy and 
happy even wise.  The problem about this part of your mind, this truly 
amazing unconscious power and the reason why more people don’t live 
happier, healthy, successful lives all the time is that we have a gatekeeper.  
This gatekeeper has a simple job.  It is to prevent the use of all that power 
to be used too wildly.   
 
We have a blueprint inside us, as you know and that blueprint decides how 
our life is going to go.  That blueprint has to be protected by the gatekeeper 
it doesn't want to make those changes lightly.   
 
Why Its Important To Silence The Gatekeeper 
When the gatekeeper gets thrown offline that’s when changes get allowed to 
be made.  Sometimes they sneak in incrementally, sometimes they sneak in 
just because there are ways of switching the gatekeeper off, but most of the 
time it’s there it’s protecting you and it’s doing a good job.   
 
Think about it.  If someone told you to go to the top of a very top building 
and jump off.  If you really believe you’re Dumbo you’ll fly.  How many of us 
would believe that?  Hopefully, none of us.  Why? Because it’s dangerous, 
silly and won’t help us live very long.   
 
However, the very same mechanism that’s protecting us from leaping off a 
tall building and killing ourselves, the gatekeeper in other words, is the same 
mechanism that will reject other ideas automatically.   
 
For example, that you can build a machine that will let you fly.  Think about 
it: until the Wright Brothers came along and people in that period started 
playing around with man-powered flight, everyone thought it was ridiculous 
that man could fly on his own.  Even hot air balloons had to be invented at 
some point and someone had to be able to dream beyond what is possible.   
 
Submarines are the same thing.  When people first came up with the idea of 
submarines, I believe Leonardo Da Vinci came up with a design, people 
thought he was mad and that it would never work.  Yet, here we are living in

a society, in which people’s dreams those madnesses from before, have 
become our reality.   
 
We know it wasn’t madness.  It was a gatekeeper deciding this is how the 
world works and this is how it will stay.  That’s why there’s so much 
resistance to the idea moving from the world is flat back to the idea the 
world is round.  It’s not that these people were stupid. It’s that they had a 
gatekeeper and the gatekeeper was refusing to allow new information in.   
 
One of our roles is to activate the awesome power of your unconscious mind 
and find a way to silence the gatekeeper at a time when you have the 
absolutely intention to make a positive change in your life.   
 
Use The Gatekeeper As An Ally 
You don’t want to be silencing him willy-nilly; otherwise, you learn by 
watching the news, seeing some horror story and end up thinking that the 
world is a horrible place and you're all going to die.   
 
That’s a terrible thing to do, so the gatekeeper has a function to play and it’s 
a very valuable function.  It’s also valuable to know when to put him to rest, 
when to silence him and say at this point, “You shut up and I’m going to do 
my work, change my blueprint and have a better life.  Then you guard the 
new blueprint, because now it’s going to be something worth defending and 
protecting.”   
 
The Power Self-Hypnosis Method 
The way to do this is the Power of Self-Hypnosis Method that’s what the 
system is all about.  We're going to find a way to thoroughly impress upon 
the unconscious mind an idea so thoroughly that the idea changes the 
blueprint and from that point onwards, the unconscious uses all its vast 
operating power and all its unconscious attention to make that reality.   
 
 If that reality is a new, trim, healthy and happy you… great.   
 If that reality is you full of success flushed with life and abundance… 
great.   
 If that reality is you being healthier, wiser and more spiritually in 
tune… fantastic.

You get to choose what the reality is you get to make the choice and find a 
way of impressing that idea upon your unconscious mind and release the 
floodgates so that it makes it work naturally, effortlessly and effectively for 
you.   
 
Of course, you need to bypass the gatekeeper to do this and that’s what 
today’s session is all about.  We're going to focus exclusively on creating a 
window of opportunity, opening a window inside the mind, in which the 
silenced gatekeeper cannot interfere and you get to impress anything you 
want on your unconscious.   
 
In later sessions, as the week goes by we’ll show you how to use that 
window of opportunity.  For now let’s get that vital job done.   
 
Track 3 – How To Unleash Your Mind Power 
Time: 5m 48s 
 
The ReSeT Formula 
To unleash this amazing power we have inside ourselves we’ll need some 
conditions to be met.  I like to think of this as ReSeT.   
 
ReSeT is– 
 
 The R is the Receptive mind.   
 The S is for Silencing the gatekeeper.   
 The T is for having Tools to make that impression and change your 
blueprint.   
 
In time you will have everything you need.  I want to emphasize that I’ll be 
teaching you a sequence, a step-by-step process for the Power of Self-
Hypnosis Method.  The magic is not necessarily in the method, the magic is 
in you.   
 
The Real Power Lies In You 
Just like you only have one mind, it’s you, it’s always been you it’s just that 
it has conscious and unconscious aspects.  In the same way, this method is

going to activate a natural mechanism and this is called the power of 
intention.   
 
In the past, at moments of importance in your life you have just made a 
choice you decided “This no more”, “This the way it will be” or “This is what’s 
going to happen in my life” and magically that’s exactly what happened.  
Your intention had a force like a laser or bullet going right past the guardian, 
straight into the unconscious and it made stuff happen for you.   
 
That’s because you already had ReSeT happening spontaneously.  Your 
mind was receptive, the guardian was silenced and you had a tool, powered 
by that intention to get the change done.   
 
The Power Is Greater Than The Method 
We're going to look at an artificial mechanism to trigger that natural process 
so that you have control of it and you don’t have to wait for inspiration to 
strike you.  You get to do it when and wherever you want to.   
 
I’m going to show you how to use the Power of Self-Hypnosis Method in a 
very short moments time, but I want you to promise me that you won’t get 
so bogged down in the method, tools and technicality of it, to understand 
that this is you we're talking about.   
 
There will be point in time when you’ll have practiced this method enough 
that you will never need it anymore.  All you have to do is intend something 
and it will happen.   
 
At that point, you’ll have true will power, because your intention will be 
coupled with the window opening up inside your mind, which will allow that 
intention to go straight through to the unconscious, rewrite the blueprint and 
you get your heart’s desire.   
 
The Secret To Unlocking Your Potential 
ReSeT is the key for the receptive mind, silence the gatekeeper and use 
your tool, your intention to create the change that you want.  How are we 
going to do this?   
 
This is the big secret…  State.

What do we mean by state?   
 
Use The Access State Principle 
Something called the Access State Principle (ASP), in regular psychology this 
is called state dependent learning or state dependent behavior.  It basically 
means whatever state you're in, whatever mood you happen to be in, when 
you learn something new that information is encoded by that mood.   
 
Think of your mind like a house full of rooms.  Each room is a mood.  You 
have your happy room, sad room, angry room, frustrated room your so-so 
room and so on.   
 
How State Determines Your Strength – And Your Weakness! 
Whenever you're happy, whatever experiences you have all of your happy 
memories get put into that room.  So when you walk into your happy room 
you can remember all of those things easily, because you're there now.   
All the things in the sad room, which are all at the other end of the house, 
are very difficult for you to remember.  If you recall them they are kind of 
vague and distant like seeing through 15 windows or something.   
 
The reverse is also true.  We’ve all had times when we're a little bit down in 
the dumps which means we're inside the sad room.  While we're in the sad 
room we get to remember all the things that make us sad and we do a good 
job of it.  In fact, we get to remember all the things we messed up in our 
lives to prove to us just how sad we really should be.   
 
If anyone should have the gumption to try and get you to remember all of 
the good and happy memories, what happens?  You reject them out of hand.  
The gatekeeper protects you, keeps you in the sad room and only lets you 
remember those unpleasant memories.   
 
Another point that happens is if the happy memory is strong enough it will 
yank you out of the sad room, drive you right back into the happy room and 
you cheer up it’s the natural process.  Either the memories are strong 
enough to yank you out of one room into the other or it has no power over 
you.

The Key Secret Of The Power Self-Hypnosis Method: A Special State 
How are we going to use this in order to create ReSeT inside our own minds 
so you can reset the blueprint?  It’s very simple.  We're going to craft a 
state.  We're going to create a certain room inside the mind, in which the 
gatekeeper has no place.  We’re going to create a room inside the mind 
where the gatekeeper’s natural function is to be asleep, snoring away 
happily while you do the work you want to do.   
 
That way, when you find it’s time to reset some part of your unconscious 
blueprint, you just walk through your house, open the door to this special 
room, the guardian falls asleep, you do your work, you walk out, he wakes 
up and as far as he’s concerned, nothing has changed.  He’s now protecting 
the new blueprint with as much vigor as he used to protect the old one.   
 
The state is also key for creating that receptive mind.  It creates a receptive, 
which is the window of opportunity, it puts the guard to sleep to stop 
anything preventing you from doing anything that you want to do, and 
creates the perfect conditions for your intention, the toolkit we’ll show you 
later in the week to have it’s effect.   
 
Track 4 – Hypnotic Warning 
Time: 1m 9s 
 
In a moment I’ll guide you through a process that’s going to awaken the 
power of self-hypnosis inside you.  In other words, I’m going to guide you 
through a process that is going to show you how to build that room inside 
your mind.   
 
Technically speaking, I’m not going to show you how to build it. I’m going to 
show you how to find it, because it’s already there. Now, because this 
process is hypnotic I want to give you what’s called the hypnotic warning.  
So you're going to need all your attention to go inside.   
 
If you're driving a car or operating any kind of machinery, do not listen to 
the recording until you're ready to stop what you're doing.  Pull the car over, 
park the car, turn the engine off, then you can listen to it and have a great 
time.  If you're operating a machine, turn it off, put it away, sit down 
somewhere comfortably, relax yourself and then listen to the recording.

Why?  Because, whether you like it or not, a lot of the elements in the 
recording will draw your mind into the hypnotic awakening process -- 
awakening the power of self-hypnosis inside of you.   
 
I don’t want you to take the risk that you’ll have any kind of accident with 
machinery.  Stop the machinery and listen to the next track only when 
you're ready to dedicate your full attention to it now.   
 
Track 5 – Awaken The Power Of Self-Hypnosis Induction 
Time: 26m 44s 
 
Make yourself comfortable.  It’s preferable that you use a sitting position for 
the moment although as you get more experienced you may want to start 
lying down as well. It’s entirely up to you.   
 
Find a comfortable position to sit in, then I want you to realize that you're 
about to activate the power of self-hypnosis in your life.  You're about to 
activate an ability that’s going to make an immense difference for the rest of 
your life.   
 
You're about to awaken an ability that will make such a difference in your 
life, how you feel, in the way you do things and the good things that come to 
you, so focus your attention and allow these things to happen.   
 
The beauty of this is that as long as you sit there comfortably and listen -- 
your conscious mind doesn’t have to do a single thing.  Your unconscious 
mind will do it all.  You just have to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.  If 
from time to time you find your conscious attention tuning in and out, that’s 
fine.   
 
All I require is that you give me enough attention at the beginning part of 
the process to set the scene and then you can allow your unconscious mind 
to take over in any way that you wish to.   
 
To set the scene the simplest thing for you to do is take a deep breath in, 
breathe out, relax and allow your mind to just calm down, because when 
you begin to calm down the mind begins to open up.  Abilities exist within

calmness that allow you to activate an immense power, an immense force 
for good that lies sleeping dormant inside.   
 
Now, one way to help your mind calm and clear even more effectively is to 
find something to focus your attention on.  Allow your eyes to rest on some 
object out in front of you, the corner of a TV, the wall, a picture, some 
specific object.   
 
You’ll notice that when your mind can look at it peacefully your eyes simply 
stop moving.  Look at that object without any need to do anything with it.  
As soon as you find that peaceful, resting of your eyes, go ahead and just 
close your eyes now allow your attention to focus inside and already 
something is beginning to happen.   
 
In order to allow your unconscious to begin to accelerate the power of self-
hypnosis growing inside your life, I’d like you to simply focus your attention 
on your right arm, get in touch with your right arm.   
 
Notice what it feels like and become curious of what that arm would feel like 
if it was heavy, loose, limp and relaxed.  That right arm, heavy, loose, limp 
and relaxed.  What would it feel like to have that arm so relaxed it could rest 
there and feel totally comfortable?   
 
Pay attention to the right arm.  Allow the right arm to grow comfortable, 
loose, limp and relaxed.  Right arm relax.  It’s like having a heavy day at 
work, lifting things, moving things, your muscles get tired.  When you finally 
get to sit down and relax, what a relief to just let go.  Let go, and feel the 
relaxation.    
 
That relaxation can begin in the arm that comfort can drift across, up the 
arm into the shoulders and into the body and you can find your attention 
wandering, drifting with that sense of comfort.   
 
It’s important that you realize your conscious mind will be doing nothing of 
importance now it all is your unconscious now.  This whole experience 
belongs to you and your unconscious is creating it for you to learn and 
awaken the power of self-hypnosis in your life.   
 
You can enjoy the drifting calm on your body and that right arm becomes 
loose, limp and relaxed; loose, limp and relaxed.  You can enjoy the process

of drifting in deeper into that comfort and trust your unconscious will take 
you where you need to go. 
 
One thing is for sure; your conscious intellect doesn't know where that is 
yet.  Your conscious intellect doesn't know where to go yet, but it will.  It will 
learn as the unconscious mind educates you on how to find the room inside, 
in which the power of self-hypnosis awaits you, for you. 
 
Now, because your conscious mind won’t be doing anything of importance 
you might as well do something pleasant.  Allow a pleasant scene to come to 
mind for example, something to do with nature.  Every night you have 
dreams.  Those dreams can be vivid or hazy.  Sometimes you don’t even 
realize you're dreaming and yet you're always there, a gift from the 
unconscious.   
 
You can dream in the nighttime and you can dream in the daytime.  
Daydreams can be so pleasant.  You can be pleasantly absorbed in one, 
something to do with nature and what would you experience; bushes, rocks, 
trees, maybe some water, temperature or some kind of light?   
 
Since this is your dream you don’t know if the light comes from the 
nighttime or daytime; some calming scene, very pleasant for you to 
contemplate.  You can explore it and take great pleasure in knowing that 
you're unconscious mind is taking care of the rest of you, any experience 
you want.   
 
In hypnosis you can have any experience you want or choose.  Your 
unconscious mind can make it happen, make it real, powerful and it’s always 
safe in here.  Any experience you want and it’s totally safe to have it.  You 
can confront any challenging situation and do so safely.   
 
You can experiment with a conflict and find out just how to solve it properly.   
 
One famous scientist, Nikolai Tesla would build machines in this place and 
they were so accurate.  Invariably when the machine worked in his mind he 
could wake up, build the machine in his workshop and it would work 
perfectly straight away.   
 
Your mind has a marvelous capacity for building experiences, doing so safely 
and it’s easy and natural to use the power of self-hypnosis in your life.  You

can have any experience you want, make it totally safe and it’s easy and 
natural.   
 
Every good athlete knows that before attempting some difficult maneuver 
they should rehearse it inside their minds first, so they can get it right.  No 
need to make a costly mistake when you have the power of the mind waiting 
to be used and it’s natural as natural as sleeping at night, as natural as 
dreaming. 
 
Your unconscious mind is terribly wise.  It collects all of your experiences, 
understandings, learnings, everything you know your unconscious mind 
knows better, deeper, it understands consequences and your conscious 
intellect can’t grasp yet it’s an amazing power.  You can trust that.   
 
It’s protected you in the past and it will look after you in the future.  You're 
safe.  Trust it, the amazing power of your mind.   
 
A gentleman I know went to the dentist and had some major surgery.  He 
said “I don’t want any drugs.  I am going to use the power of self-hypnosis 
and I’ll feel no pain.  I’ll be comfortable and relaxed” and that is exactly 
what he did.   
 
He sat inside that chair and inside his mind he allowed a dream to come, a 
dream of a pleasant scene.  He enjoyed that scene somewhere out in nature.  
He could smell it, feel it, see it and hear it and he enjoyed that scene.   
 
A walk in the park can be just as pleasant inside the mind.  You can walk 
around the park and meet people, see the flowers and enjoy nature.  In 
time, the dentist called him back and he said “did you start yet?”  The 
dentist said, “what do you mean start?  We’ve already finished.”   
 
I want you to know there was almost no bleeding; very unusual in a 
procedure of this kind, but it’s not unusual when you have the power of self-
hypnosis on your side and trust your unconscious; because the power of 
self-hypnosis is on your side.   
 
You don’t need to do anything of importance, your unconscious mind gets it 
it’s always understood.  When the chips were down it was there to protect 
you, look after you and your unconscious mind can make any change you 
want, on anything you wish, anything that’s reasonable and do so easily.

A young man I know stepped into the examination room for his finals, a 
tough exam and yet he was brimming with confidence.  Everyone thought he 
was mad.  He had only started revising three days before the examination… 
all thought he would fail yet he was brimming with confidence.   
 
What he knew is he’d spent one month, 30 days preparing himself with the 
power of self-hypnosis.  It didn't take long.  Every single day his revision 
would be to activate the power of self-hypnosis and then we would learn 
inside his mind, he’d rehearse taking the exam and he’d succeed.  He found 
he knew all of the answers.   
 
By the time he entered the examination room he already practiced it 60 
times, twice a day.  If you take an exam 60 times, it would be easier for you 
too, would it not?  That’s the power of your unconscious.  You can learn 
anything you wish, make changes and grow as a person.   
 
There’s a blueprint inside and you can change it.  Shape yourself to become 
anyone you want to.   
 
In a dream, you can dream of any person dead or alive, real or fictional, you 
can meet that person in a dream.  If you can do it in a dream, you can do it 
in self-hypnosis.  Anyone you wish, learn from them and even become them 
for a while absorbing only the attitudes, attributes, skills and abilities that 
you wish and leave the rest behind.   
 
You can change and grow as a person and do so easily and naturally with 
the power of self-hypnosis on your side.  You can be happy and succeed at 
anything you wish.   
 
You can call on immense hidden abilities, talents that are hidden to most 
people except in being emergencies, you can know what to do, where you 
need to do it, you can feel what you need to feel and be who you need to be, 
because your unconscious mind stores all of your wisdom.   
 
You can do these things wisely and respond.  Your unconscious mind heals 
you physically, heals you mentally and brings balance into your life, true 
balance not the kind of balance that comes from avoiding those situations, 
from which you could grow, but a kind of balance that comes from mastering 
them.

You're now mastering your self-hypnosis.  The power of self-hypnosis is at 
your command.  All of those hidden abilities, things you only scraped the 
surface of in the past are coming to be under your influence and are there 
ready to support you when you need them and want them.   
 
The power of self-hypnosis is a tremendous force for good in your life.  You’ll 
find it easy to master it.  It’s already awakening inside of you preparing, 
growing, changing, things opening up.  You don’t know what they are, yet 
your conscious mind or will you be the last to know, but you’ll know it’s 
working, because you feel good. 
 
As the days turn into weeks, weeks into months, months into years, you 
start feeling better, stronger, happier, healthier, more vibrant, so full of life, 
because of the power that self-hypnosis has unleashed in life for you.  No 
one gets to enjoy these things as fully as you. 
 
I’d like for you to experience that now a tremendous, profound sense of 
peace, an inner knowing that things are happening, the power is coming, the 
power is here and you might not realize it yet, because it feels so good.   
 
To use the power of self-hypnosis I’m sure that you’ll start looking forward 
to your next opportunity to practice it, to feel the power of self-hypnosis in 
your own life.  You can look forward to it and enjoy it.   
 
Where did that pleasant dream go to?  How pleasantly can your mind drift?  
Forgetting things, like forgetting a dream, everyone has had the experience 
of how naturally it is to awake in the morning and forget what you’ve been 
dreaming about.  Sometimes it happens gradually, piece by piece and 
eventually it goes whereas other times it’s virtually instantaneous.   
 
You open your eyes and the dream is gone.  In a moment it will be time for 
you to open your eyes and awaken to a new life, in which the power of self-
hypnosis manifests itself as a force for good for you, to bring anything you 
wish into it, to make you feel great and success, because you deserve it.   
 
When you have the power of self-hypnosis in your life, improving your life, 
you also improve the lives of all of those around it, because their 
unconscious mind get to learn it form you, get to pick it up just by observing 
you, who you are and how you are; it’s a tremendous gift that you carry.

Isn’t it good to know that the better you can make your life the more you 
enhance the lives of those around you, because they’ll get to learn 
unconsciously?  They’ll absorb it just by osmosis just by hanging around you 
their lives can be just as good and just as positive. 
 
They’ll have learned the power of ReSeT without even knowing they’ve done 
it just like you learn how to shake your head no and nod your head yes, by 
observing others.   
 
I’d like to have you return now.  The simplest way for you to return is to 
count yourself up from one to five.  At the count of five you can open your 
eyes being refreshed, relaxed and alert, simply fantastic, ready to face a 
bright new future, ready to enjoy a vibrant new excitement and enthusiasm 
that wells up deeply from the inside.   
 
As you are ready to do that, remembering to bring back with you the power 
of self-hypnosis whether you know how to do that or not consciously, it’s 
totally irrelevant, because your conscious mind has done its task it’s all 
about the unconscious now.   
 
As I count from one to five, count along with me and bring yourself back out 
to the outside world.   
 
 One, coming out slowly.   
 Two, feeling yourself revitalized, refreshed, relaxed.   
 Three, getting more and more alert beginning to start moving your 
body.   
 Four, allowing your arms and legs to start moving a little bit, 
stretching out, and   
 Five, open your eyes, feeling refreshed, relaxed, alert, simply 
fantastic.   
 
Congratulations, for having completed this hypnotic adventure.  You have 
done a profound thing right now.  You have awakened the power of self-
hypnosis for you in your life.  The more you listen to this recording the 
easier it comes, the more natural it becomes to you and the more it’s going 
to be there for you when you need it.   
 
When you’ve come back and refreshed yourself fully continue on to the next

Track 6 – A Step By Step Guide To The Power Self-Hypnosis Method 
Time: 6m 57s 
 
Its Important To Do It Yourself! 
Welcome back again.  It’s all very well for me to guide you through that 
process and awaken the power of self-hypnosis.  The next step is for you to 
acquire the skill for yourself so that you can access that state and that place 
at will, whenever you want or need to.  So when you change, you change at 
will.   
 
It Takes Just 5 Minutes 
This doesn't take long.  I’m going to take you through the same process 
very quickly a few times to get you used to it.  It takes no more than five 
minutes.  If you want to stretch it out for a long time, 10 minutes, maybe 15 
maximum that’s all it requires.   
 
When To Practice 
I’d like you to practice at least twice a day, morning and evening.  First in 
the morning when you wake up, last thing in the evening before you go to 
sleep.  A nice way to do this is to listen to one of the inductions, perhaps the 
awakening induction that we just experienced in the mornings before you 
start your day.  It’s a great way to get your day rolling before you start 
thinking about things.   
 
Then, in the evening before you go to sleep, do this induction on your own 
and I’ll show you exactly how to do this.   
 
The Secret To The Power Self-Hypnosis Method: TACK & CAVE 
The secret to using the power of self-hypnosis for yourself when you want to 
is contained in the words TACK and CAVE.   
 
TACK is a little acronym to remind you of the four phases you have to work 
through:  
 
 Trance

 Attitude 
 the CAVE cycle and 
 Know it is all working out.   
 
T - How To Go Into A Hypnotic Trance 
Basically, trance is all about attentional focus -- fixing your attention on 
something.  In the previous example you fixed your attention on a point 
outside yourself and close your eyes.  Trance is also about creating a quiet, 
calm and receptive mind.   
 
There are many other ways of creating trance that will work just as 
effectively, but this one is the easiest, most consistent, reliable one and the 
one you can trigger any time you want to; it’s also pretty healthy for you.   
 
Finally, trance is about feeling good and relaxing.  Feeling good and relaxing 
is one of the gateways that allows you to silence the critical factor, to silence 
the gatekeeper.  At the same time it’s very healthy for you as well. 
 
 So the ‘T’ part of the TACK equation is all about creating an intentional 
focus, quieting your m I don't know, creating a receptive mind, feeling 
good and relaxing.  I’ll show you exactly how to do that in a moment.   
 
 Next is the attitude, the mindset you take into the thing.  The ‘A’ of 
TACK stands for attitude.   
 
A – The Attitude That Will Get The Results You Want 
Attitude is two-fold.  
 
1. Easy Does It 
Number one is: easy does it!  
 
Remember we're trusting the tortoise, not the hare.  The hare brain is going 
to run around the place, jump off walls and do all kinds of crazy stuff and in 
the end it’s not going to get you to the place you want to go as consistently, 
quickly and solidly as the tortoise will.  Which means, easy does it don’t be 
in a hurry.

In fact, the general adage, more haste, less speed is so true of self-
hypnosis.  Take your time.  Allow the suggestions to sink in, allow the 
process to take over and you will get the results you want, which means you 
get to trust your unconscious.   
 
2. Trust Your Unconscious 
The attitude is easy does, it and trust your unconscious.  It’s a tremendous 
force for good in your life.  It’s protected you in the past, it’s looked after 
you and it will go right on doing so.   
 
C – The CAVE Cycle For Powerful Self-Hypnosis 
Next we come to the ‘C’ part, which stands for the CAVE cycle.   
 
Cave is what you’ll be doing in self-hypnosis to get the results you want.  
We’ll look at that in more detail in a moment.   
 
K – The Perfect Way To End A Self-Hypnosis Session 
Finally we’ve got ‘K’, which is know.   
 
Know it’s all working out, that you have a bright future ahead of you, know 
that your unconscious mind is on the job and you don’t have to worry about 
it just get on with living your life and enjoying it.   
 
That’s TACK– those are the phases you want to keep inside your mind.  
Trance, which is to get your attention focused, quiet your mind and feel 
good and relaxed.  Your attitude is “easy does it”. Just trust your 
unconscious mind to take you where you need to go.   
 
The CAVE cycle, which we’ll look at in a moment and finally just know it’s all 
working out.  You come back brimming with confidence, bringing that back 
with you, knowing a bright, new future is ahead of you.   
 
A Step By Step Breakdown Of The CAVE Cycle 
What is this CAVE cycle?  CAVE is what you’ll be doing to create the changes 
inside.

It’s not enough to just create a self-hypnotic experience, that’s just a 
meditation.  You want to use it focusing your energy and attention to get a 
result.  
 
So CAVE stands for:  
 
 Convincer,  
 Affirm,  
 Visualize and  
 Drift [Editors Note: The ‘E’ will make more sense in a moment!]   
 
C – The Convincer 
The convincer is a process we use to show you that you're at the right level 
of mind.  A lot of people start wondering, “Am I doing this right? Am I in 
self-hypnosis yet?  Am I there?”. 
 
The convincer is your way of measuring “yes, the door I wide open now.”  If 
the convincer hasn’t been triggered yet, then you carry on until it has 
triggered.  When the door is open you get to carry on and do what you want 
to do.   
 
Does it mean you can’t do self-hypnosis without the convincer?  No!   
 
You can do self-hypnosis with or without a convincer, no problem at all.  
When the convincer is there for you to know that your mind is in a perfect 
state to get the actual results.   
 
AV – Affirm & Visualize 
The ‘A’ and ‘V’ of CAVE stands for affirm and visualize.   
 
You can do these two things at the same time.  An affirmation is a very 
simple statement, an instruction for the unconscious -- like  “fix this 
problem”.  A visualization is basically a mental picture you can make to 
create an experience.  We’ll talk more about those on day four.   
 
For the moment just think about CAVE being the convincer, affirm, visualize.

E – Drift (with an ‘E’!) 
Finally, the ‘E’ part of CAVE Cycle is drift?   
 
But that’s a D not an E!?!   
 
When I say drift, the ‘E’ of CAVE is basically  
 
 the Ebb flow  
 the Effortless,,  
 Easy and natural way you let yourself flow with the experience.   
 It’s allowing your mind to be Empty enough to allow any experience 
that arises to arise and to be okay with it.   
 
So the E of the CAVE Cycle is “go with the ebb and flow”, “be effortless”, let 
it be easy and natural, empty your mind, let your mind drift.   
 
Together, between TACK and CAVE, that’s the whole self-hypnotic process 
just ready and waiting for you.   
 
Experience The CAVE Cycle For Yourself 
On the next track I’m going to guide you through the whole self-hypnosis 
process.  It will take five or six minutes maximum and you’ll get a full 
experience of that.   
 
Then I’ll show you how to do it by guiding you through the highlights and 
finally you’ll get a chance to do it all by yourself.  Remember, this is all a 
hypnotic experience!  So before you listen to the next track, make sure that 
you stop driving a car and stop operating any machinery so you can put full 
attention on this hypnotic process.   
 
Hypnotic Warning 
Never listen to any hypnotic induction until you are totally comfortable, in a 
safe place where there’s no machinery and nothing that requires your 
outside attention.

take you through your very own self-hypnotic process to activate the power 
of self-hypnosis in your life.   
 
Track 7 – The CAVE Cycle For The Power Self-Hypnosis Method  
Time: 5m 58s 
 
Step 1 – Relax & Clear Your Mind 
Find a comfortable position. Step one is take a deep breath, breathe out, 
relax and clear your mind.  That was easy.   
 
Step 2 – Connect With Your Right Arm 
Look at your right arm.  Focus your attention on your right arm and connect 
with it.  When you get a sense that you connected to your right arm, in 
other words, you can feel it and sense it, just close your eyes.  So far, so 
good.  This is easy to do, is it not?   
 
Step 3 – Instruct Your Arm To Relax (‘C’) 
The next thing is to focus on what it feels like for your right arm to be 
relaxing.  Tell your right arm to relax.  Tell yourself: “My right arm is 
relaxing- relaxing- relaxing”. If it helps,  tell yourself that your right arm is 
“feeling loose, limp and so heavy”, then notice what happens in the right 
arm.   
 
You're not looking for an immediate response, just looking for any variation 
or change to begin to happen.  That right arm feeling heavy, loose, limp and 
relaxed, relaxing, relaxing, the right arm loose, limp that’s right.  It’s so 
good to relax that right arm.   
 
That right arm loose, limp and relaxed, feeling heavy, feeling comfortable, 
loose, limp and relaxed.  This is your convincer.   
 
As soon as you have your arm beginning to get loose, limp and relaxed, 
comfortably heavy, comfortably relaxed you know that it’s time to move on 
to the ‘A’ stage, affirmations and visualizations.

Step 4 – Make Affirmations (‘A’) & Visualize (‘V’) 
For the moment allow any pleasant scene to come to your mind any relaxing 
or calming scene and know you're mastering the power of self-hypnosis in 
your life.  Tell yourself I’m mastering the power of self-hypnosis in your life, 
but don’t let your thoughts disturb anything that you're doing.   
 
They drift as comfortably and quietly as the rest of you.  Allow those 
thoughts to exist I am mastering the power of self-hypnosis in my life.  
Allow it to resonate like a pebble in a pond.  Very good.  Now let it go.   
 
I’m mastering the power of self-hypnosis in my life.  Realize what it means.  
Just let it go.  I’m mastering the power of self-hypnosis in my life.  In fact, 
let yourself go and drift, drift and let your unconscious mind pleasantly guide 
your experience for a while.   
 
Additional Suggestions For Mastering The Power Of Self-Hypnosis 
As you trust your unconscious you develop the amazing powers that are 
lying dormant inside of you.  You have keys that will awaken the power 
inside of you any time you need to.   
 
Practicing self-hypnosis makes you feel good, which means you get to look 
forward to practicing it again and again, again and again, at least twice a 
day.  Practicing self-hypnosis is easy, natural and feels terrific it awakens 
the power of self-hypnosis for you.   
 
Find a time every day to use the power of self-hypnosis for yourself.  Just go 
into hypnosis and out, in and out, quickly and easily.  Each time that you 
use this method to go into self-hypnosis you’ll find it easier.  You’ll go deeper 
more quickly and more profoundly, because you're learning.   
 
The mind is creating the neurological connections to open you to the power 
of self-hypnosis.  The more you practice it, the easier it becomes.  It’s fun to 
practice.  It’s enjoyable.  You get to look forward to it.   
 
It’s easier and more fun than watching TV.  It’s like having a wonderful 
massage.  You don't have to do anything.  Let your unconscious do the 
work.

Step 5 – Drift (‘E’) 
Now, remind yourself that you're feeling calm, peaceful and happy.  That can 
be as simply as telling yourself now I feel calm, peaceful and happy.  You 
have a bright, new future to look forward to.  Look forward to a bright new 
future and know that good things are coming your way, because you have 
the power of self-hypnosis in your life now.   
 
Step 6 – Count Out 1-5 
Are you ready?  Count along with me from one to five.  At the count of five 
open your eyes feeling refreshed, relaxed and alert, simply fantastic knowing 
that something powerful has happened for you.   
 
 One, bring yourself back slowly.   
 Two, more and more alert.   
 Three, feeling yourself shifting back, orienting to the outside world.   
 Four, allowing your hand and legs begin stretching out.   
 Five, open your eyes feeling refreshed, relaxed and alert, simply 
fantastic.   
 
Go ahead, look around the room, look at your life with fresh, new and 
vibrant eyes.  Eyes empowered with the tremendous forces that you’ve just 
activated inside yourself.   
 
Track 8 – Prepare For The Next Exercise 
Time: 1m 01s 
 
Welcome back how are you feeling?  By now you should be feeling pretty 
fantastic.  You’ve had two wonderful hypnotic experiences the second, of 
which you’ve begun to take control of the process. 
 
In a moment, I’m going to guide you through this whole process one more 
time, only this time I’m only going to point out the highlight, the milestones 
that you want to reach and I’m going to let you do the rest, which means 
you're going to hear a lot of silences in what’s going on.   
 
Those silences are times for you to fulfill each step of the process.  If you 
need a bit more time simply stop the recording and follow through the seven

steps on your own.  Guide yourself through.  The more you can take 
responsibility for yourself the quicker and easier you’ll have the power of 
self-hypnosis in your life.   
 
As soon as you're ready to do that go straight ahead to the next track where 
I’ll guide you through the highlights of the whole process.  It will only take a 
few minutes so you can get the whole self-hypnosis method ingrained into 
your own mind so you can access it at will.   
 
 
Track 9 – A Light Guide Through The CAVE Cycle 
Time: 3m 10s 
 
Step 1 – Relax & Clear Your Mind 
Step one, find a comfortable position to rest in.  Take a deep breath in and 
as you breathe out just relax and clear your mind.    
 
Step 2 – Connect With Your Right Arm 
Step two, look down over there at the right arm and get a sense of 
connection with it.  When you're connected to it you sense the right arm, 
just close your eyes.   
 
Step 3 – Instruct Your Arm To Relax (‘C’) 
Step three, tell your right arm to relax.   
 
Tell yourself your right arm is relaxing.  The simplest way to do it is to say 
“My right arm is relaxing.  Relaxing- Relaxing- Relaxing.”  Use a cool, 
soothing, calm tone of voice.  Go ahead and do that now.   
 
Step four, just allow yourself to spread, that comfortable glow to the rest of 
your body.  
 
If it helps, allow a pleasant scene to come to your mind.  Feel your body 
comfortably relaxing.  Allow a pleasant scene to come to mind.  Very good.

Step 4 – Make Affirmations (‘A’) & Visualize (‘V’) 
Step five, use the CAVE process.   
 
Go ahead and tell yourself I’m mastering the power of self-hypnosis in my 
life.  Allow that to gently and smoothly ease into your mind.  I’m mastering 
the power of self-hypnosis in my life.  Get a sense of what that means.  Go 
ahead and do that now.   
 
Step 5 – Drift (‘E’) 
Let yourself drift.  Don’t think about anything or focus on anything.  Let your 
unconscious mind take you where it will.  Just drift and enjoy.  Very good.   
 
Tell yourself that you're feeling calm, peaceful and happy.  You have an 
amazing future awaiting you.  Calm, peaceful and happy and an amazing 
future is awaiting you.  This is just a nice way to finish this process.   
 
Step 6 – Count Out 1-5 
As soon as you're ready, just count from one to five.  Remind yourself at the 
count of three that your body can start stretching and feeling more in tune 
with the outside world.  At the count of five open your eyes feeling 
refreshed, relaxed, alert and simply fantastic.   
 
When you're done that just join me on the next tract.   
 
Track 10 – Repeat The Power Self-Hypnosis Method Alone 
Time: 3m 37s 
 
Congratulations!  You’ve just taken yourself through a self-hypnosis 
procedure all by yourself.  All I did was point out the guiding steps along the 
way.  As soon as we finish this track, I’d like for you to do the whole thing 
again on your own.  There is a very simple sequence to follow.   
 
1. Step one, make yourself comfortable, take a deep breath, breathe out 
and clear your mind that just sets the scene.

2. Step two is get in touch with your arm.  When you get a sense of 
where you arm is, how it feels like, etc., just close your eyes.   
 
3. Step three is tell your arm that it is relaxing.   
 
Tell yourself that your arm is relaxing.  Say to your arm- relax- relax, feel 
loose and comfortable.  Use a calm soothing tone of voice.   
 
4. Step four, when you can feel your arm changing, perhaps feels lighter 
or heavier, it feels a buzz or a glow, it feels a deep sense of comfort 
and rests just wonderfully comfortably there.   
 
Then allow that sense of comfort to spread into the rest of your body and 
contemplate some pleasant scene.  It doesn't matter what it is as long as it 
helps you to relax even more. 
 
5. The next step is to remind yourself that you're mastering the power of 
self-hypnosis.  
 
Later on in this program I’ll show you other things you can do with it, but for 
now, seeing as you're learning self-hypnosis, you may as well use it to help 
you learn it quicker and more easily.   
 
Once you’ve told yourself maybe five or six times that you're mastering the 
power of self-hypnosis, simply allow your mind to drift.  This is the pleasant 
part of the experience, the mind massage.  At this point the unconscious 
mind is acting out on the message that you’ve given it.   
 
Finally, give yourself one last set of suggestions; you're calm, feeling 
peaceful and happy.  This is a great way to live your life.  Then remind 
yourself that the future is always better than the present so no matter how 
good today is tomorrow is going to be even better.   
Then count from one to five.  With each count between one to five feel 
yourself become more alert, refreshed, more revitalized.   
 
 At the count of three begin to get a sense of your body start moving 
around a little bit.   
 
 At the count of four, kind of stretch it a bit.

 At the count of five open your eyes feeling refreshed, relaxed, alert; 
simply fantastic.   
 
Those are the steps.  They are simple and easy to follow.  Listen to this track 
again if you need to, to get it inside your mind or listen to the previous track 
to guide you through it until you're ready to do it all by yourself.  It’s simple, 
quick and effective. 
 
It will take you three to five minutes to do and just do it a few times to get 
used to it.  Practice it every day for the next 21 days. 
 
Every morning when you wake up, listen to the awakening of the power of 
self-hypnosis induction that we did earlier in this session, the long 20-30 
minute version.  Then immediately afterward, when you come back out of 
the whole hypnotic process and have this glow coming through, then do your 
self-hypnosis exercise.   
 
Do no more than three or four minutes.  It takes no time at all, but having 
done it yourself is the best way of getting the power for yourself.   
 
Listen to that induction at least once a day, but no more than twice.  You 
can do little mini hypnosis exercises for yourself as often as you wish, 
provided they're no longer than three to five minutes just to get the hang of 
it.  You’ll only be doing over the course of the next seven days to get used to 
the actual process. 
 
Once the seven days are over you get to choose whatever you want to 
change in your life and you’ll know how to do that.

Day 3 – How To Program your Mind To 
Get What You Want… Automatically 
 
Track 1 – Day 3 Introduction 
Time: 1m 33s 
 
This is day three of your exciting seven-day journey to thoroughly master 
the power of Self-Hypnosis. 
 
Today’s session is called How to Program Your Mind to Get What You 
Want Automatically. 
 
In today’s session, we're going to look at goals and how to make them work 
for you.  First, we’ll examine what goals are and how they work.  Then look 
at the important issue of why many goals, like New Year’s Resolutions 
simply fail.    
 
Today you will discover more than just the conventional wisdom in setting 
powerful goals.  You’ll be getting a little known inside track into the 
psychological principles to make goals work for you. 
 
Finally, we’ll finish today’s session by looking at the top five reasons why 
regular goals might fail and give you solutions to fix that once and for all.   
 
Now, why not take a chance to discover for yourself the amazing powers 
that you have inside, because once you’re ready to do that, just sit back, 
relax and enjoy the power of Self-Hypnosis. 
 
Track 2 – The Power Of Goals 
Time: 7m 34s 
 
Welcome to day three.  This day is all about the power of setting goals.  
Your mind is something called a cybernetic organism.  Cybernetics comes 
from the Greek word ‘kybernetikos’, which means a steersman or good pilot.

So a cybernetic organism is something that wants to steer towards an 
outcome, so it’s goal-oriented.  It needs a direction to go in.  I often say to 
people, “If you don’t know where you're going, don’t be surprised if you go 
nowhere fast!”.   
 
The Yale Goal Setting Myth Busted 
When it comes to setting goals, which is the direction and purpose that your 
whole life gets driven towards, there’s an interesting and unfortunately an 
urban myth about setting goals.  Some people know it as the Harvard Goal 
Setting Study, some know it as the Yale Goal Setting Study. 
 
Essentially this myth reveals some important truths about goal setting.  The 
idea was that they asked a bunch of Harvard and Yale undergraduates if 
they wrote down their goals.  Then 10 years later they are meant to have 
followed up and discovered that the seven percent of people that said they 
had goals actually outperformed the 93% that didn't have goals.   
 
In other words, those that had goals and wrote them down would 
systematically outperform in happiness, success, life, wealth all the different 
measures those people who didn't have goals and didn't write them down.   
 
Unfortunately, it’s an urban myth.  It didn't happen.  Yale has done 
extensive research into its archives to figure out if that kind of study ever 
occurred and it didn’t.  However, the importance of it is still in the principle 
that goals that allow you to reach better things. 
 
You Must Give The Unconscious Mind A Target To Aim For 
If you are goal-less, than you are hoping that life will give you some things, 
but you can’t make opportunities happen.  If you have no goal then your 
reticular activating system doesn't know what to look for.   
 
Remember, the power of Self-Hypnosis only starts arising when you start 
changing the unconscious blueprints.  Instead of having old grandparents

Your idea of old changes so you can have a youthful, vibrant old age, which 
lasts a long time rather than a short, fast decline.  The same is true of 
anything that you want.   
 
The point of setting goals is that primes the unconscious mind, the targeting 
system, to start getting the things you want in exactly the same way as 
accidentally buying a new car or a new dress accidentally primes the 
reticular activating system to look for those things as well.   
 
So you get to do it now, but for things that you want causing you to start 
noticing opportunities to get more of it and start following them.   
 
Take The Road Less Travelled 
Again remember, we're betting on the tortoise, not the hare.   
 
The difference is the hare wants to go for the straight line, go quickly and 
put energy and all of that stuff into it and that’s great so by all means, do all 
of that.  The point about the tortoise though is, the tortoise has a different 
way of doing it.   
 
It has what’s called a ‘picaresque’ adventure.  Instead of going in a straight 
line, it will turn left and go around to a little adventure there or go right to 
an adventure there.   
 
Somewhere along those lines we’ll make a connection or an opportunity 
arises, which is going to advance your goals in ways you could never 
conceive of before.   
 
Listen To Your Hunches 
Therefore, when you start setting goals in particularly start implanting those 
goals into the unconscious blueprint so that it starts finding paths to it, 
you're responsibility on a conscious level is to start paying attention to those 
little hunches, intuitions or instincts. 
 
So that unlike the unlucky person that actually saw a $100 bill stuck in the 
sidewalk, shook his head thinking it’s too good to be true and walked off 
without even investigating it, you don’t become that person, you become the 
person that sees something that just caught my attention and I don’t know 
what it is.

You look, get closer, examine it and say I’m glad I wasted the time to stop 
and look at that drain, because now I’m $100 bucks richer.  That’s what you 
need to start doing.  It comes down to trusting your unconscious.   
 
Give Yourself Time To Internalize The Method 
At first results come slowly and you're not quite sure where they're coming 
from, but that process speeds up.  The more you trust your unconscious, the 
more you get used to it, the quicker and easier it becomes.   
 
Think of it like learning to drive a car all over again.  If you're anything like 
me, the first time I drove a car, it took forever.  There are so many things 
and concepts I hold in my mind that just crawling along at two miles an hour 
seemed like I was whistling down a race track at 100 miles per hour.   
 
Why?  It’s because there are so many things to keep track of.  Over time 
I’ve gotten better at it so crawling at two miles an hour didn't do it for me 
anymore and now I can go 30, 50, 100 miles an hour and I’m fine.   
 
The same happened to me again not too long ago when I was invited to go 
on a racetrack at a racing event.  I was in the car and I know how to drive 
normally on normal roads and motorways.  Of course, race driving ups the 
ante a little, so at first seems like slow progress, but then something strange 
happened.   
 
I slept over night, woke up the next day, got in the car, drove and I drove a 
perfect lap the very first time.  It seemed that everything I had learned from 
the previous day had a chance to be absorbed by my unconscious overnight, 
the blueprint changed and now whizzing around at a top rate of speed and 
doing complex turns was relatively straightforward for me.   
 
It doesn't mean I’m a crazy race driver after two days of training, but it does 
mean there’s a significant shift and it takes trust in the tortoise mind for that 
shift to occur.  Initially, allow things to be slow and take their own pace and 
time.  Don’t be in a hurry and trust your unconscious.  
 
You’ll often be the last person to realize just how much you are changing.

Follow The 21 Day Rule 
The final thing to say about goals, particularly when using goals to change 
your blueprint at the unconscious level is the 21-day rule, which we 
mentioned briefly on the very first day.   
 
The 21-day rule is very simple.  Take any theme, new idea or new project 
you're working on and install that at the unconscious level over the course of 
21 days and that means you repeat it for 21 days.   
 
You do it at least once a day, maybe twice, no more than three times a day.  
Sit down and focus on that particular goal, go through the TACK and CAVE 
process that we talked about on day two.   
 
During the CAVE part of the process you’ll affirm and visualize the goal.  I’ll 
show you more about how to do that tomorrow and you’ll do that for 21 
days straight.  You can go longer 30, 40 days and some have gone as long 
as six months.  How do you know when to stop?  We’ll talk more about that.   
 
For the moment, the minimum you're looking at is 21 days.  Incidentally 
that’s why at the end of yesterday I recommended that you take the 
‘Awakening of The Power Of Self-Hypnosis’ induction that I created for you 
and you listen for that for 21 days.   
 
If you listen to that for 21 days and at the end of it you come back out of 
hypnosis you put yourself back in quickly yourself.  You’ll not only have 
conditioned yourself to respond to Self-Hypnosis powerfully, but you’ll know 
you can do it on your own any time you wish and that’s a very powerful 
place to be in.   
 
Track 3 – How To Find The Right Goal 
Time: 3m 56s 
 
Before we get into the actual goal setting method, which is very quick and 
simple to do, I’d like to talk about setting the right goal.  How do you know 
what goal to set?

Chances are we mostly have problems here or there that we must fix, we 
want to have more dates, find the person of our dreams and get married, 
find the ideal job, have more income those sort of things.   
 
The Conscious Goal Illusion 
The problem is, often the conscious mind has too little understanding of 
things so the goal it thinks is good for you may not be the best goal for you.  
In other words, you're on the right track, but you haven’t thought far 
enough ahead. 
 
I’ll give you a personal example.  For me, my goal was always to be a 
lawyer.  I’d seen these hotshot lawyers on TV and that was a blueprint I’d 
had inside my mind.  I thought if I work for the best law firm in the world or 
the country that I’ll have the same lifestyle.   
 
I’ll have excitement, travel, love and romance, stimulation, wealth 
everything will be there.  Of course, the reality is a lot more mundane.   
 
The reality of working in a law firm, while I enjoyed it and had a great time, 
it didn't hit my own life criteria of adventure, travel, learning new things or 
meeting new cultures all these things weren’t being met by my time as a 
lawyer.   
 
So, while I had been tremendously successful in terms of the goal, it actually 
failed in terms of what I truly wanted.  
 
The True Purpose Of A Goal 
Therefore, I want to introduce you to the concept of the true purpose of a 
goal.   
 
For example, some people think Self-Hypnosis can’t make everything 
happen, like you can’t have a short, small person be an all star basketball 
player.  Whether or not a physically small person might be a great basketball 
player is neither here nor there.   
 
What’s more important is why would you want to be an all star basketball 
player?

What is the true purpose of it?  Is it so that you feel like a champion?  How 
about working on feeling like a champion and let basketball take care of the 
rest?  Is it so you have more influence and authority?  Is it to pay your way 
through college?  What is it you hope this goal, dream or ambition will do for 
you?   
 
That’s your true purpose.   
 
You’ll know you’ve hit it, because you’ll get tremendously energized.  Again, 
right now although I have nothing to do with my life in law anymore, I don’t 
have any legal type things to do anymore, I feel like I did when I was 
watching those TV show and those TV lawyers from before.   
 
I am surrounded by amazing people with great talents, very smart people.  I 
have a business that challenges me to think every day, be creative, not just 
make stuff up, but make it work and be practical.  I’m surrounded by people 
that I can genuinely help and be a force for good with.   
 
I get to travel every three to six months and live in a new country and 
meeting new people.  I’m not saying this to brag, I’m just telling you this, 
because I’ve achieved the goal behind the goal.  I never wanted to be a 
lawyer.  What I wanted was what I thought being a lawyer would get me 
and that’s what to aim for.   
 
When you aim for that then your unconscious mind can give you what you 
want as well as what you need.   
 
Let Go Of The Content And Find The Essence 
Essentially what we're saying is: you want to let go of the content of a goal 
and get used to more the form of it.  In other words, you want something as 
good as this or better.  Something that will get me everything that I think 
this goal will give me and beyond that.   
 
Focus on the energy and the vitality in the system, the thing behind that and 
make that your true purpose.  Make that your true goal and you won’t go far 
wrong.

Track 4 – SMART Goals 
Time: 10m 56s 
 
I’d like to introduce you to a very simple goal setting formula.  A lot of you 
may be familiar with it.  It’s very simple and I don’t want to spend too much 
time on the actual process of setting goals partly because there’s so much 
wonderful information on it out there already and partly because you don’t 
need it.   
 
The formula is called SMART Goals.  SMART is an acronym that stands for… 
 
 Simple,  
 Measureable,  
 Affect, 
 Reasonable, and  
 Timed 
 
SMART Is Only A Rough Guide 
Each one of those things are criteria that you want to have the goal conform 
to, to make sure as a form of a goal that you can and want to achieve.  The 
SMART goals are a rough guide only.  You can work most plans, most 
dreams and desires through it and shape them up.   
 
Remember, when you're setting goals you're now working with the awesome 
power of the unconscious mind.  With all that latent ability you have inside, 
stuff you’ve never even tapped before in your life, which means you get to 
dream bigger.  You get to have more of what you want, more good things.    
 
Sure, it’ll take a little bit of effort and time, because we're betting on the 
tortoise, not the hare the tortoise will get us there, the 21 days cycles will be 
the minimum, but step-by-step you will get there.   
 
Ironically, as you resolve some part of your life, others automatically fall in 
line, because the whole blueprint starts naturally evolving and growing 
again.

Let’s take the five elements of SMART goals step-by-step.   
 
Step 1: ‘S’ – Simple  
First of all, we have something simple.   
 
You have to have a goal that you can grasp hold of.  You don’t have to have 
a goal that is so complex that says something like you’ll have this, this 
person will do that and then that person will do this and I will feel this way 
and the other person will do that.   
 
It’s like trying to plan a conversation ahead of time.  You just don’t know 
where life is going to take you.  Keep it simple, direct and something you 
can grasp inside your mind.   
 
Another problem, which violates simplicity, is that you try to do too much 
sometimes.   
 
For example, you might have a sense of maybe “my love life isn’t in great 
shape and I’ve also got some problems with clients.  I could have more 
friends as well”, so you decide to have this mega power goal, which will take 
care of all of these things at the same time.   
 
So you’ll say my friendships, love life and charisma is increasing, I have 
power and will do this with all the others.  At that point, if it starts getting 
convoluted, it’s not simple anymore either go beyond it to the true purpose, 
which goes back to simplicity.   
 
The true purpose is for you to feel powerful and charismatic, great there’s 
your true purpose and the other things become results of that true purpose 
or bring it down again.  Say: “I’m going to focus on friendships and I want to 
make good connections with people, emotional connections.  When I have 
that, I’ll build the next piece.”   
 
Both of those can work.  Sometimes you have to scale things up to get 
progress and sometimes you scale them down to get progress.  You’ll know 
with experience, which ones work.   
 
Why?  Because with experience you get to trust your unconscious, trusting 
your instincts and your unconscious through your gut instincts will tell you, 
which one of the goal setting methods work better.

Initially, don’t worry about it.  Go for one, try it out for a few weeks, notice 
what happens then start adapting and changing it to make it fit what you 
want to have.  What you need is experience and plenty of it.   
 
Step 2: ‘M’ – Measurable  
The next phase is measurable.   
 
Can you measure your goal?  Do you know when you’ve achieved it?  Part of 
measurable is something you can kind of violate a little bit when you have 
becoming goals.  I’m becoming happier, healthier and so on.   
 
How do you know when you're happier or healthy?  You have to have some 
mechanism of knowing, “Hey, I’m achieving it now!  This this working! I 
might still want more of it, but it’s still working for me.”   
 
A classic example of this is affluence.  If you want to be wealthy, what does 
wealthy mean?  Wealthy is two dollars extra $10, $100, $1,000, $100,000 
or a million; how much is wealthy?   
 
Make sure it’s measurable.  It’s more for your conscious mind to get a sense 
of “Wow, I’m making progress!” 
 
Also, for you as the captain of the ship to check if the crew is actually doing 
the job it’s meant to be doing, because if it’s not doing its job it’s either time 
to have a talk to them again and say “Hey guys, sort this out” or more likely 
you have to be good at trouble shooting.   
 
You may have to change the message a little so they understand it better 
and know what you're talking about or you may have to clean up some 
things.  We’ll talk about cleaning up goals that have failed in the past and 
how to do that in a little bit of time.   
 
Step 3: ‘A’ Affect 
‘A’ stands for affect, which means emotion; you have to feel strongly about 
something.   
 

 
                                      The Power of Self-Hypnosis for Guaranteed

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         103
If you want the goal you’ll get it.  Emotions are the fuel to drive us, it gets 
goals achieved.  No emotions, no fuel.  No fuel, the car doesn't go anywhere 
so you have to have an affect.  If your goal has no emotion in it, chances are 
it’s the wrong goal.   
 
A classic example is, when I study for this test I’m going to remember 
everything in this textbook.  If that thought leaves you totally deflated like “I 
don’t know”, that’s basically something you should do.   
 
It’s not going to get you where you want to go, rather it has no energy 
inside it so chances are your unconscious is going to respond to the energy, 
to the emotion and say it doesn't really want that I’ll do something else 
instead.   
 
How do you turn that around?  You put emotion back in by going back to the 
true purpose.  The true purpose is not to memorize the textbook.  The true 
purpose may not even be to pass the exam.  The true purpose might be how 
great you’ll feel once you‘ve past the exam and everyone thinks yourself 
smart.   
 
Your true purpose might be how amazing you feel when you land that dream 
job, because you were smart enough to pass that exam.  That’s your true 
purpose and that’s what will get you energized.   
 
That’s when you get in touch when you're studying that is what you inject 
into your revision practice so when you're studying it all gets tied up and 
carried away by this enthusiasm.   
 
Every item you learn in the textbook now is one step closer to being that 
person, to having that dream job and suddenly it becomes a breeze.   
 
I know a man who did this, a man who is from the Middle East, spoke not a 
word of Spanish at the time, back in the 1980s.   
 
The only place he could learn and study medicine in a western system was in 
the University of Madrid.  This man went through a Spanish course from 
scratch.  Spent a month in a Spanish course and by then his Spanish was 
good enough to enroll in medical school.   
 

 
                                      The Power of Self-Hypnosis for Guaranteed

He spent another month of the summer in that course and by that time his 
Spanish was so fluent even Spanish native speakers couldn’t tell the 
difference.   
 
Do you think that man was motivated?  You’d better believe it.  He wasn’t 
motivated to learn Spanish.  He was motivated by the dream of becoming a 
doctor and that gave him enough emotional energy that his unconscious 
moved mountains for him and let him perfect the language in two months, 
which for most people is an impossibility.   
 
Step 4: ‘R’ Reasonable 
Next is reasonable, an interesting word that means something that is within 
your control.   
 
The reason I say its interesting is, because strange things happen and 
sometimes the unreasonable can be put into your blueprint and still occurs.  
When I say reasonable I don’t mean things like, I want to grow wings and 
jump off buildings and fly.   
 
However it’s reasonable that you find people in your life that can help you 
with the next step.  Let’s say for example, you want to go to college, but you 
can’t afford it.  What might be reasonable is that you find a job that you 
earn the money to go there.   
 
It could also be reasonable that someone takes a liking to you and becomes 
your mentor someone who will sponsor you through university.  This actually 
happened to my cousin.  He found a mentor who was so impressed with him 
he said “young talent has to be fostered” and paid for an entire two year 
masters program, a huge expense out of his own pocket and never asked for 
the money back.   
 
Why?  It’s his philanthropic approach to do something good for the world 
and to invest in someone he believes in.  So those things are possible, but it 
means you change your attitude.  In order to make that possible he had to 
be likable enough to the other guy who would want to do that for him.   
 
When I say reasonable don’t dream small, because you don’t think it’s more 
realistic.  When I say reasonable I just want to make sure that you make it 
within the bounds of safety, naturalness and always remember the true 
purpose.  Go beyond the purpose to the true purpose.

Sometimes life can surprise you with an even better solution than anything 
your conscious mind could ever come up with.   
 
Step 5: ‘T’ Timed 
Finally, something which can be broken a little bit is the idea of timing.   
 
You want to give yourself a reasonable amount of time to achieve something 
by.  If you’ve never spoken a foreign language and you want to learn 
Spanish, you want to put yourself in a trance and say when I wake up 
tomorrow morning, I’ll speak Spanish perfectly.   
 
Do you think timing is going to be an issue there?  I think so!   
 
It’s not reasonable.  Your mind hasn’t got time to adapt and acquire those 
abilities.  Now, if you’ve spent the last year in a Spanish speaking country or 
you used to speak Spanish as a kid, but forgot all about it that might be 
more reasonable.  But remember we're betting on the tortoise, not the hare.   
 
Give yourself a timeframe so you have a sense of pressure to go with it, but 
at the same time allow yourself time to be able to grow into the function or 
role.  Dream big and allow the dream to come and find you.   
 
With those thoughts I’d like for you to sit down, choose a couple of things 
and turn them into SMART goals.  You want to work on those straight away, 
but I want you to get used to the process of setting a SMART goal and 
feeling fantastic as a result.   
 
You’ve got to dream these things up and enjoy the process of goal setting.  
Setting goals is an incredibly exciting thing to do, because you're getting 
back in touch with that creativity that powerful engine inside you that gets 
stagnated when you're too “reasonable”, when you conform too much to the 
world and get your expectations to match the world.   
 
Remember, a reasonable person will adapt himself to fit the world.  An 
unreasonable person will make the world fit him, adapt itself to him.  Which 
means the unreasonable person gets to make big dreams come true.  Be 
unreasonable and make those big dreams come true.  Go ahead do that now 
and I’ll see you on the next track.

Track 5 – The Top 5 Reasons Why Goals Fail! 
Timed: 5m 21s 
 
 
Welcome back.  I’d now like to run you through the top five reasons why 
goals fail so that in the track after this one we can start solving those 
problems with the power of Self-Hypnosis.  These are the five most common 
saboteurs and reasons why goals would fail.   
 
Reason 1: Getting Stuck On The Content 
Number one is getting obsessed by the content or the form of the goal 
rather than its essence.   
 
For me the example was that I became obsessed with becoming a lawyer.  I 
became a lawyer, but I didn't allow the true goal to take place.   
 
Had I stuck there, had I become obsessed about staying a lawyer and just 
becoming more of a lawyer to get even more out of it I would have been 
more miserable, de-energized, more unenthused and possibly getting fired 
at the end because my work wouldn’t be good enough so I’d lose everything.   
 
Why?  Because I got obsessed about how the goal should be rather than 
turning it over to my unconscious saying hey this is what’s important, this is 
the true purpose.  I want a life of excitement, adventure, cool people, 
intellectual challenge, creating something worthwhile and solving problems 
that’s what I want.   
 
I happen to think it might be as a lawyer, but if you can give me something 
better than that, go for it.   
 
Reason 2: Lack Of Energy 
The next reason is lack of energy.   
 
If your goals or if you have no motivation to do something, if you get slowed 
down by something, think about your goals and it’s like “Oh God, I have to 
do this.  I want to do it, but I don’t have enough energy for it.”  Then there’s

a problem with desire, it might be that you have the wrong goal so you have 
to go back to the true purpose, or it might be a question of effort.   
 
Just because things become easier and natural in flow, it doesn't mean you 
don’t have to put energy into them.  So you may need to be more focused 
and get your attention, desire sorted out or test the actual goal itself.   
 
Reason 3: Conscious Interference 
Number three on the list is interference.   
 
Interference is the law of reverse and effect.  It states that the more you 
want something the harder it’s going to be purely because, if your conscious 
mind starts interfering, starts trying to do things that your unconscious mind 
was meant to be doing it starts getting in the way, interfering and ruining 
the job.   
 
It’s like driving a car all over again.  When you try to do it consciously, 
mirror signal, maneuvers, clutch, forward, back, stop, see the other cars and 
all of that your conscious mind is overwhelmed.  It doesn't have enough 
ability to keep track so bits of information gets absorbed too quickly. 
 
Now you're doing it unconsciously.  In fact, you know you’ve driven home 
from work at times or from some place you know well and you lose half or 
most of the journey.  All you know is that you started and then along those 
lines you got home and you don’t know how you did in between.   
 
Yet, you stopped at traffic lights, obeyed traffic laws, drove safely and 
unconsciously your unconscious mind did it for you.  So if it’s interference 
you're going to have to find some mechanisms for getting past interference 
so that you don’t activate the law of reverse effect.   
 
Reason 4: Doubts 
Next we have doubts, which are very interesting.   
 
Doubting mans that you’ve activated the gatekeeper again.  Doubting is the 
gatekeeper coming out of his slumber saying here’s an objection or let’s 
quickly throw this out the door.  Doubts put in a contradictory message.

As soon as you’ve done the good work and a doubt comes in, what happens?  
You have a message that says “you can achieve this” and one that says “you 
can’t achieve this.”  They cancel each other out and you're left with 
whatever you had before.   
 
So you’ll have to figure out way to overcome doubts and we’ll talk about that 
in a moment.   
 
Reason 5: Internal Conflicts (Dirty Goals) 
Finally, we have internal blocks, which are conflicts between what you want 
consciously and what your unconscious mind wants.   
 
Remember the blueprint is a big blueprint and there are a lot of things that 
your unconscious mind wants and needs to protect and look after you.  Let’s 
say you want to be slim, trim and healthy.   
 
Let’s say for some reason something happened in your past and your 
unconscious mind has the idea that slim and healthy people get picked on in 
some way and life becomes harder for them, so it’s safer to be fat.   
 
Guess what?  If you try to change that blueprint and just be slim, trim and 
healthy, it’s like telling the unconscious mind I want to be unsafe and your 
unconscious mind is going to say, “No way! I’m going to look after you.  I'm 
going to keep you nice and fat so you can be nice and healthy.”   
 
Logically, it doesn't make sense, but the unconscious mind reasons through 
a different set of logic.  So what we need to do is to overcome that conflict 
so that the unconscious mind harmonizes with what you want, which is the 
true purpose so that both of you get what you want.  You're protected safe, 
good things are happening and keep you slim, trim and healthy.   
 
So these are the five saboteurs.  We're going to have a look at how to deal 
with them on the next track on how to deal with it.

Track 6 – How To Fix The 5 Reasons For Failure 
Time: 22m 09s 
 
 
Welcome back.  Now that we know what the five saboteurs are, how can we 
fix them?  Let’s take each one at a time and focus on that.   
 
The first one is this idea of getting obsessed with the form or content of your 
goal.  The simple answer to that is just let go.  That’s sometimes easier said 
than done, because if your conscious mind is married to the idea, how do 
you let go of it?   
 
Fixing Reason 1: Obsessing About The Content 
The first thing you do is start activating the true purpose.   
 
The true purpose takes you beyond what you think is the goal, the form of 
it, into what you truly want.  Do you want to be an all-star basketball player 
or do you want to have the attention, love, income, connections or influence 
that all that brings you?   
 
Even if you go beyond that, what does all that give you?  Peace of mind, 
happiness, an enthusiasm, a sense of a life worth living.  Surely those are 
the things worth aiming for rather than playing basketball.   
 
Let’s face it, you could be an all-star basketball player and hate your life.  
You have to get up at stupid-o’clock in the morning to train hard.  You get 
injured and pushed around the place.  You have to work hard when you 
want to be relaxing with your friends.  You can’t drink and go out and party 
as hard as you want to.   
 
Maybe the sacrifices aren’t worth it.  What if instead of being a miserable 
basketball player, you could play basketball and enjoy it and have this 
fantastic life all around it, which one do you want?   
 
 
Chances are if the true purpose is to have this fantastic life then you can let 
go of the all star-ness, enjoy basketball for what it is and have the great life.

Another way to do this is to learn how to drift at the unconscious level.  We’ll 
talk more about this on day six, when we’ll teach you specific methods on 
how to trust your unconscious, how to let the unconscious mind take over 
the goal setting and goal getting process so you don’t get too obsessed 
about it.   
 
For the moment, just enjoy the true purpose and drift within that.  When we 
come to day six we’ll have four specialized methods that will take you way 
beyond your ability to hold on too tightly.   
 
Fixing Reason 2: Lack Of Energy 
Second is the idea of energy.   
 
What if there is no energy or enthusiasm in your goal?  The first thing to do 
is check your own state when you're doing Self-Hypnosis.   
 
Remember, Self-Hypnosis starts with a CAVE process.  Everything you do up 
to CAVE is just getting you there.  The ‘C’ in CAVE is the convincer.  In this 
case it’s getting in touch with your right arm, making your right arm relax, 
because you want it to relax, getting it to feel heavy, because you want it to 
feel heavy.   
 
When your arm relaxes and feels heavy, because you’re repeating those 
words to yourself and getting the meaning behind those words, you’ve 
responded to your first suggestion.   
 
In order to respond to that suggestion it means the conditions must be right 
for you to respond to suggestions so, when you're in the right state at that 
point you can get the job done.   
 
Check Your State 
The first to check is whether or not your Self-Hypnosis process is being done 
in the right state.  Is your convincer fully active?  Sometimes just by 
thinking too much about what you want it kicks you out.   
 
It gets your conscious mind engaged again saying “Oh boy, I really want 
this!”, which means the gatekeeper comes back up again and can start 
zapping the energy out and say we're not doing this one.

Fatigue – v- Distraction 
The next one to check is your focus, your own attention.   
 
You might be too tired, in which case just rest, go to sleep that’s fine; 
resting is a good thing.   
 
You might be too distracted.  In, which case you may need to train your 
attention to remain on what you want.  Overcoming distraction is about 
focusing through something.  If your mind goes off track, come right back, 
come right back, come right back.   
 
Again, the convincer is a great one to train yourself away from distractions, 
because you're focusing on the arm that’s your focus of attention.  You are 
allowing something to arise; you're evoking an experience of heaviness and 
relaxation.  All distractions become a sideline at that point.   
 
Check Your Desire 
The next thing to check is your desire.   
 
Do you want this goal or is it one of those should goals?  Remember, if you 
don’t want it, if it’s a should goal like memorizing a textbook for an exam 
then go back to the true purpose linking to that, because the juice is always 
in the true purpose.   
 
When you link the true purpose to the goal even a dull job for example, 
memorizing a textbook suddenly becomes interesting and fascinating again, 
it has energy back inside it.  Why?  Because you’ve linked it to the true 
purpose.  You know it’s not about memorizing the textbook. it’s about living 
a life of happiness and freedom.   
 
Eliminate Competing Thoughts 
Finally, check for competing thoughts.   
 
Focusing is a key thing to being able to open that window inside your mind.  
If you have competing thoughts it gives your gatekeeper a chance to come 
in through the back entrance and say “No, we're going cancel this one out.”

Keep your thoughts entirely on the subject, check your desire, click back in 
with the true purpose and make sure your focus is on the goal.   
 
If your focus is distracted, at least at an initial point, then bring yourself 
back until you can focus again properly.   
 
Fixing Reason 3: Conscious Interference 
Next we come to interference.   
 
Interference is an overactive conscious mind, which brings me to the 
gatekeeper and trying too hard.  It’s like the captain getting out and trying 
to push the boat.  He’s so enthusiastic, but let’s face it -- the captain isn’t 
going to go very far if he’s trying to push the boat.  That’s not how boats 
were designed to work. 
 
Check Your State 
If you're interfering too much, the first thing to do is to check the state.  If 
you’re checking the state can you have a convincer?   
 
Can you tell your arm to relax and it relaxes?  Not because you make it 
relax, but just because you're telling it to?   
 
Can you go through that drifting phase, which is to let go and let your mind 
take you wherever it goes?  The drifting phase is important, because it lets 
your intellect get away from the idea which creates a space, in which your 
unconscious mind can do the job you want it to do.   
 
Let Go, Relax & Let It Happen 
The next thing to do is to relax and let it happen.   
 
You're not the one that’s doing it.  It’s your unconscious mind.  If you could 
do it consciously you’d have done it already.  You wouldn’t need self-
hypnosis to do it.  So if you're using self-hypnosis on something surely that 
means that your unconscious mind needs to do it.   
 
Let go of it!  Just tell the unconscious mind what you want, let it go and let it 
happen.

Sleep On It 
By the way, it’s a great practice to sleep on it.  So do some self-hypnosis 
and immediately afterwards just go straight to sleep.  Whilst you're sleeping 
the unconscious mind gets to integrate lessons, the learnings, bringing up 
activities and abilities so by the time you're awake in the morning significant 
changes and advances have been made.   
 
The key thing to going to sleep right away is that you can’t interfere with it 
until after you’ve finished.  You do your process, come back out and rather 
than thinking about it, obsessing, trying to dig at it and make it happen even 
more, you're going to go to sleep.   
 
Your conscious mind goes offline leaving more space and freedom for the 
unconscious to do what it does and you're the winner.   
 
On day six we're going to focus on four specific strategies to do exactly 
these kinds of things.  Don’t worry if you think you don’t know exactly how 
to deal with it right now.   
 
Here are the ideas and on day six we’ll have an experience of putting those 
things into action.   
 
Reconnect With The True Purpose 
Next is the true purpose.   
 
Come back to the true purpose; always rest in the true purpose.  If you find 
your conscious mind interfering, go back to how the true purpose feels.  
When you can feel it and can rest in that feeling let that feeling guide you 
then you don’t need to do anything else.   
 
Remember, the conscious mind tries to put a plan in steps.   
 
Step one I’ll do this  
Step two I’ll do this  
Step three, I’ll do this  
 
If that is not working for you, it means the conscious mind and the conscious 
steps are the wrong steps so just drift in that feeling and know that your 
unconscious mind will find those steps for you.

You won’t necessarily know where those steps are until after you’ve taken 
them and that’s the beauty of this.  If you trust your unconscious it means 
you can’t interfere anymore, so once you succeed at taking a step – I’ve 
done this myself – there are so many things I’ve done, which would have 
scared me to even think about beforehand.   
 
However, because I found myself in the middle of it and just kind of did it 
and muddled my way through it, I turn back, look at it and say “Where did 
that come from?  How did I do that?”   
 
 
Had I chosen to do that on purpose I would have scared myself silly doing it.  
There is no way my conscious mind has any idea of how to do that.   
 
Drift & Trust Your Unconscious 
Lastly, if you find it difficult to do all those other things, to drift and those 
sorts of things just focus on your convincer, on the arm being heavy and 
how it feels being heavy.  Basically, that’s something you’ve made happen 
and it’s working.  If it’s working for you, that’s enough to get your conscious 
mind out of the way.   
 
On day six we’ll look at more sophisticated ways of making that work for 
you.   
 
Fixing Reason 4: Doubts 
Now, let’s turn our attention to those tricky little doubts.  Doubts come in 
many different forms.  It’s usually a sign that the gatekeeper has been 
activated, which means you go back to the idea of the convincer.   
 
Silence The Gatekeeper 
Once you're responding by maybe making your left arm or leg heavy and so 
on, it means that the gatekeeper is back to sleep again and you can carry on 
with what you're doing.  Sometimes a doubt arises, because you have a 
conflicting thought.

Use Your Imagination 
The rule of thumb is this: where your will and your imagination conflict, your 
imagination always wins, because your imagination is something that 
stimulates the unconscious mind and that’s where the big juice is, where it 
all happens and where the action is.   
 
When your will and imagination are conflicting, the minute your attention 
shifts the unconscious mind wins out that’s why willpower will never help 
people stay on a diet.  The minute they think about something else they find 
themselves in the fridge, opening it up and reaching out for that chocolate 
cake.   
 
It’s happened to me and to you probably.  You're bored, you open the fridge 
and catch yourself, saying “I’m not going in there.”  Five minutes later you 
open the fridge again.  Five minutes later you did it again like there’s going 
to be something different in the fridge next time around.   
 
The fact is you're bored and for five minutes your attention span can distract 
you and get you to think of something else.   
 
However, when you find the chink in the armor the unconscious program 
takes over, the fridge opens up and if you're not careful you're going to start 
eating stuff you don’t want to eat. So use the imagination to help you rather 
than to fight it.   
 
I’ll show you how to do that tomorrow when we come to the suggestion 
tactics.   
 
Burn Off The Energy 
The next thing to do with doubts or any kind of interference is you can burn 
the energy off.   
 
For example, if you want to have a hot date and ask someone out, but 
you're afraid – fear, doubt, all these things are coming on at the same time. 
Instead of fighting the fear saying I’m not afraid, I’m not afraid, challenge it 
let it burn through.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         116
Say “I am a confident individual I deserve this date.”  At that point, the 
energy sparks up and says “No you're not! You're a loser! You’ll fail like you 
did all these other times before.”   
 
Remember that’s the gatekeeper speaking here, at which point you smile, 
observe and say is that the best you’ve got?  Come on, do more than that 
and at that point you re-affirm again, I deserve this hot date and I’m going 
to get it.   
 
Again, that feeling comes up and it might be stronger this time just go okay 
good shot, keep going come on, you can do better than that.  You keep 
doing that and eventually the whole state just vanishes.  The energy of it 
gets released; you're burning through the energy by challenging it.   
 
If you try and push it away “I don’t want to think about that, I don’t want to 
feel it” you're packing the energy away, closing the little bubble up and 
saying I’m not looking at that anymore.  That’s fine for day-to-day living, 
but when you want to make a change you want to release that bubble.   
 
It’s like having a blister where you prick the skin just enough to let the 
pressure out and then the skin can heal again.  You're going to let the 
emotions out and then the emotional well-being can heal again.   
 
An Example Of Burning Off Negative Emotions 
Here’s an example of what happened to me, I was at a party and shall we 
say something unexpected and not so pleasant happened.  I suddenly found 
myself in a very foul mood.  Everyone around me is having a great time and 
I’m in a foul mood.   
 
I don’t want to be in a foul mood so first I’m fighting and fighting to put a 
grin on my face and get back in the groove of things, but it’s not happening. 
 
Why, because my imagination and my will are conflicting.  I’d seen a person 
that sparked my imagination in all kinds of unpleasant ways and as a result I 
was not a happy chappy.  Here’s what it is that I did:  
 
I went outside and calmed my mind.  I created a receptive mind.  I said 
“Okay, if I’m going to be grumpy, go on.  Do your worst!”   
 
At that point, I got grumpy and pretty upset.  Then I said “More than that. “

So I got even more upset.  Notice, I’m not feeding the imagination! I’m 
paying attention only to the emotion.  This is an important thing.   
 
I’m not letting the imagination escalate out of all proportion.  I’m just going 
here is the same situation, come on do your worst.  It took me about half an 
hour; because I said “Do more than that, do more than that.”  After about 
10-12 minutes the emotion spiked and started receding.   
 
After 30 minutes, because this was a big thing, it was gone.  At that point I 
was saying “I guess it’s gone now.” then I went back inside and had the time 
of my life.   
 
This is a great way of draining the emotion of something just by letting it be, 
letting it do its thing, just knowing that it’s going to slowly drain out of your 
system and eventually it will go.   
 
Will you never feel upset again?  No.  There might be other stuff you may 
want to do, you may want to spend a whole month of sessions specifically 
clearing up that particular hot button you have inside, but it’s no longer 
interfering with you.   
 
Don’t Create A Dirty Goal! 
The problem is when you do something like a self-suggestion like I deserve 
this date, I deserve love in my life and you had this emotion coming up 
that’s conflicting with it, what its doing is creating a dirty goal.   
 
 
This means that the more you suggest to yourself or affirm one thing, the 
more the unconscious blueprint will be filled with anger, resentment, fear, 
frustration whatever it happens to be so that even should you achieve the 
goal, should you get the person of your dreams, you'll be grumpy around 
that person.   
 
That’s what the blueprint has, when you have personal dreams, the feeling 
to have is grumpy.  That’s the conditioning process you’ve created inside 
your mind.  You must break that, so when you achieve your dreams you feel 
the true purpose of them and you don’t get in your own way.

Reconnect With The True Purpose 
Of course, that last thing I said is very important.  Jump into the true 
purpose.   
 
If the things you are doing right now are causing doubts, go beyond the 
doubts.  Go to the true purpose.  Reconnect to that energy and allow that 
energy to wash through the doubts and they’ll wash them clean away.   
 
These are different strategies you can use to burn off doubt, go beyond 
them and wash them away.   
 
Fixing Reason 5: Internal Conflicts & Dirty Goals 
Finally, we have those internal blocks.   
 
Doubts are kind of a version of that internal blocking -- it’s what I call a dirty 
goal.   
 
What Is A Dirty Goal? 
A dirty goal is where the conscious and unconscious minds are in conflict.   
 
Essentially it’s the same situation we just discussed a moment ago.  I’m 
thinking of one thing -- this is the goal and dream that I want and I’m trying 
to make active -- but for whatever reason my unconscious mind is going 
“Okay, in the past when you’ve been thinking about these things you’ve had 
pain, frustration and anger so let’s have more of it.”   
 
Or, it’s saying actually in the past you’ve failed so I’m going to protect you 
from it by not allowing that to happen.  Or, it will say something along the 
lines of I’m not ready to do that yet, because in order to get this goal you're 
going to have let go of this and I kind of like this.   
 
Burn Off The Negative Emotions 
So depending on what it is, the first thing I always try to do is burn off the 
energy, see if it will go away.

If I feel a nervous connection like I’ll fail– for example, I have a new project.  
I’m going to teach a new seminar, and my unconscious is going,  “I don’t 
know about this, this may be biting off more than I can chew.”   
 
Remember ASP: Never Make An Important Decision Whilst Feeling Bad! 
The first thing I do is burn through it.  Notice what happens once the 
emotion is gone.  This is back to the secret of ASP that we talked about 
right at the beginning, the Access State Principle.  Never make an important 
life decision when you're feeling bad.   
 
The unhappy room is not a great place to be choosing resources or making 
decisions about your life.  Why?  Because you make bad decisions, you make 
decisions about being unhappy.   
 
When you're in the happy room that’s the time to make good decisions! 
When you're in the calm and focused room, any one of those other states is 
better than feeling unhappy, depressed, frustrated or angry and so on.   
 
The first thing you do is see if you can burn the energy off.   
 
Use The Power Pendulum 
If you can’t burn the energy off, there’s still some sort of conflict going on or 
for whatever reason you're still not getting any closer to your goal… on day 
five I’m going to show you a very special method called the power pendulum 
to connect right back into the unconscious and resolve the conflict there.   
 
You're essentially going to do the same thing that a hypnotherapist does 
with you when he does a regression, only you're going to do it in a totally 
safe way and in a way that you can guide yourself through it.  It takes a 
little bit of time, persistence and commitment to do it, but it’s worth every 
ounce of effort you put into it.   
 
Use The Big Drift 
Also the day six strategies come back into this – something called the big 
drift, which is one of those strategies we’ll talk about on day six – you can 
go through a process where you say to your unconscious, “if you're so smart 
you come up with a way of making this happen without me having to feel 
bad about it.”

At that point, your unconscious goes “Okay. The instructions are: change the 
blueprint so that he can have his cake and eat it too.  Here’s how we’ll do 
it.”   
 
Tap Into The Unconscious Creativity 
Now the very same creativity you have at the unconscious level when you're 
dreaming -- I mean who plans their dreams?  Those dreams are created 
fresh and new every night.  You have this immense capacity for creativity 
and now you're going to tap into it to get it to help you, rather than resist 
you.   
 
Again, all the things we said about the other times is still true.  The day six 
strategies still work.  Jumping to the true purpose is going to be a great way 
to go beyond the limitations of how you think you have to achieve it.   
 
Sometimes a conflict arises because consciously you think the only way to 
achieve it is to do this and you don’t know if that can work.  Your 
unconscious mind to protect you and says “Okay, if that’s the only way to do 
it and nothing can work, I guess we’ll just have to avoid doing it.”   
 
 
Whereas, if you go back to the true purpose then you can go beyond the 
limitations built into the goals that you’ve created in the first place.  If your 
true purpose is to be educated and you have some kind of problems with 
reading there are other ways to get around it.   
 
You can listen to audios, go to lectures, talk to people who’ve been there 
before and learn from them.  Those are things you might not have realized 
when you're thinking “I’ve got to read, got to read, got to read”, but when 
you let go of the idea of reading you become educated in other ways.  
 
Of course, reading is another thing you can focus on and if there is 
something negative attached to that, there are other ways to resolve it.   
 
For example, the power pendulum on day five, the day six strategies or just 
by focusing on that as a step before you go on with the actual whole 
education process.

Sleep On It 
Above all else, learn to sleep on it.  But sleep on the right thing- don’t sleep 
on the wrong thing.  Too often we go to bed frustrated, angry and upset and 
use sleep as a way of calming down again.   
 
The problem is, if you're angry and upset, the last thought through your 
mind primes your unconscious mind for what kind of experiences to have in 
sleep.  So, if you take stress to sleep with you -- guess what’s going to 
happen?  That’s right, more stress!   
 
As a rule of thumb, clear your mind, breathe, relax, think of the true 
purpose and get back in touch with the energy of what you really want then 
go to sleep.  As you sleep allow your unconscious mind to arrange things to 
suit you.   
 
Those are the fixes for the five saboteurs.   
 
Hypnotic Warning 
As soon as you're ready move on to the next track.  In the next track I’ll 
take you through, once again the general outlines for the practice Self-
Hypnosis session for you.  I’m just giving you the guidelines and you're 
going to fill in the content yourself.   
 
Once you’ve been all the way through you’ll do the whole process again on 
your own just so you have on example of it with me guiding you through a 
process, one example of you taking yourself through the process.  You're 
responsible for your own learning.   
 
I’ll give you a hypnotic warning: this session is hypnotic so before you listen 
to the next track, make sure you're not driving a car or operating any kind 
of machinery.  Find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment where you 
can sit back, relax and enjoy the ride of Self-Hypnosis.

Step 1 – Relax & Clear Your Mind 
Find a comfortable position to rest in.  As soon as you're resting comfortably 
take a deep breath, as you breathe out just relax and allow your mind to 
clear.  As soon as your mind starts feeling clearer, look at your right arm 
focus on your right arm.   
 
Step 2 – Connect With Your Right Arm 
Get a sense of connection to it, when you can sense your right arm, go 
ahead and close your eyes.   
 
Step 3 – Instruct Your Arm To Relax (‘C’) 
At this point begin to suggest to yourself that your right arm is relaxing.  
Use a calm, soothing and purposeful tone of voice.  Go ahead and do that 
now.  Very good.   
 
Remember, every time you suggest your arm is relaxing, feeling heavier, 
calmer and so on make a suggestion and then notice what happens to the 
arm.  It doesn't matter what happens, just notice the response.  The arm is 
relaxing.  Check in.  The arm is relaxing-relaxing-relaxing.  Check in, arm is 
relaxing, arm is relaxing.  Check in.   
 
Interim Step: Imagine A Calming Scene  
Next stage is to allow some pleasant scene or memory to come to mind, 
something that will help you to relax even more.  Let the feeling of 
relaxation from your arm spread like a glow into your body.  That’s it.  Let 
your mind think about some pleasant scene or memory, like a daydream.   
 
Step 4 – Make Affirmations (‘A’) & Visualize (‘V’) 
Now begin to slowly, meticulously and comfortably and with utter conviction 
tell yourself I’m mastering the power of Self-Hypnosis for my life.  Get a 
sense of what that means.  I’m mastering the power of Self-Hypnosis for my 
life.  Get a sense of what that means.  Continue to do this all by yourself; 
very good.

Step 5 – Drift (‘E’) 
We're coming to the end of this particular hypnotic process.  Just remind 
yourself that you're calm, peaceful and happy and you have this amazing 
future waiting for you calm, peaceful and happy with an amazing future 
waiting for you.   
 
Step 6 – Count Out 1-5 
Count from one to five.   
At a count of three bring yourself more and more aware of your body.   
At the count of four begin to stretch.   
At the count of five open your eyes, feeling refreshed, relaxed, alert simply 
fantastic. 
 
Congratulate yourself on having had another powerful hypnotic adventure.  
Every time you practice the power of Self-Hypnosis it becomes easier, 
quicker, you go deeper and the connection of trust with your unconscious 
depens as well, which means amazing things are waiting for you in your life.   
 
As soon as you’ve done this and you’ve brought yourself all the way back 
out again pause this recording and do the whole thing again all by yourself.  
It only takes three to five minutes to do, a bit longer if you want to spend 
some time inside there.   
 
Allow yourself to experience that having guided yourself all the way through 
from start to finish.  Then go on to the next track, which will introduce you 
to what you expect to happen. 
 
When you're ready, go on to the next track so as to introduce you to all the 
things we’ll cover tomorrow on the Power of Self-Hypnosis For Guaranteed

Day 4 – Potent Suggestion Tactics to

unconscious blueprint with suggestions.  We’ll start off with a quick look at 
the four classic styles and reveal important tips on how to make them work 
for you.   
 
Next, we’ll focus on each of those four classic suggestion styles and find out 
how to use them to get what you want every time.   Finally, we’ll finish 
today’s session with a fun, Self-Hypnosis exercise, in which you get to use 
the four suggestion styles for yourself.   
 
Now why not take the chance and discover for yourself the amazing powers 
that you have inside you, because once you’re ready to do that just sit back, 
relax and enjoy the power of Self-Hypnosis.   
 
 
Track 2 – How To Change The Unconscious Blueprint 
Time: 3m 18s 
 
Welcome to day four.  I hope you've been practicing your awakening 
induction from day two as well as doing a couple of inductions on yourself 
afterwards as well.  I can’t stress enough how important it is for your body 
to get experience of this now.

The more your body and mind get that interaction going of having these 
experiences, the more you’ll find it natural and easy to go into Self-
Hypnosis, use it for whatever you want to and that’s what we’ll be focusing 
on today.   
 
Change The Blueprint 
The purpose for the power of Self-Hypnosis method is to change the new 
blueprint.  We're going to install that at the unconscious level so that the 
unconscious mind ends up making it real for you whether that’s happiness, 
health, wealth or whatever it is you're looking for. 
 
You need to put that into your blueprint so that your unconscious mind 
realizes, “This is something that I need to do.”   
 
Key To Change 1: State 
One of the keys to that is state.  We discovered that on day two where we 
looked at how to unlock the hard drive, how to open that window of 
opportunity into the unconscious mind and it feels good at the same time.   
 
As we’ve been practicing that, by now you should be able to get to that point 
relatively easily.  Now it’s time for you do something with it, which is where 
the word suggestion comes in.   
 
Key To Change 2: Suggestions 
A suggestion is both the tool and the seeds that you plant inside the mind in 
order to get what you want.    
 
Just like regular seeds, if you imagine your unconscious to be like a vast 
garden, when you plant seeds, the first thing you’ve got to do is prepare the 
ground so when the seeds get scattered they don’t get choked by weeds and 
other things.   
 
Key To Change 3: A Receptive Mind 
That’s why when we do the CAVE cycle, we begin with a convincer.  The 
convincer clears that ground for you it opens things up and makes your mind 
perfectly receptive for the seeds that are about to come.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         127
 
The next thing you do when you plant seeds is you stick your seeds in the 
ground so they’re deep enough so they can start doing their thing.  That’s 
what suggestion is all about and what we’ll look at today. 
 
Key To Change 4: The 21 Day Cycle 
The next thing you do is water them regularly.   
 
Without water, the seeds won’t survive.  In the same way you're going to 
have to water your suggestions regularly by repeating them.  This is the 
essence of the 21-day cycle that we keep repeating.   
 
Key To Change 5: Get Out Of The Way! (Let Nature Take Its Course) 
Finally, you need to leave the seeds alone to grow.   
 
It’s no good to dig them up every day, checking and measuring them to see 
how well they're doing.  You just water them and trust nature to do the rest.   
 
 
In the same way, when you’ve planted your suggestions there is no point 
going back checking and re-checking to see if it’s okay and doing one more 
thing.  No.  Do it and let it go.  Trust your unconscious and miracles will end 
up happening.   
 
If you have difficulty letting things go and that sort of stuff we’ll have some 
troubleshooting ideas on day six, which will help you over to hose hurdles, 
but for the moment, let’s stick to the basics, the real classics and focus on 
getting results with those.   
 
For the remainder of today I’d like for you to think of a couple of goals or 
things you’d like to achieve in your life so you can use those as concrete 
examples of using the various suggestion styles to work for you.

Track 3 – The Different Suggestion Styles 
Time: 2m 35s 
 
 
Now we're going to go to the actual suggestion styles.  The first thing to 
realize is that there are many different ways of suggesting things to your 
mind.   
 
Remember, these are just tools, different ways of planting the seeds and 
what matters is the intention, the meaning behind the suggestions or the 
ideas behind the various tools or ways of formulating them, so you need to 
keep that clear inside your mind because the intention is most important of 
all.   
 
The Real Magic Behind Suggestions 
There are no magic words or magic formula.  The magic is the intention: 
“What is it you're trying to achieve” -- then translating that into a way that 
your unconscious mind can understand the intention.  You’ve got to use both 
sides of the equation otherwise you’ll risk something failing on the way.   
 
Words & Pictures As Suggestions 
When it comes to suggestion styles there are essentially two types of 
suggestion.  You can use words or pictures.  Both will have a very powerful 
effect on the unconscious.   
 
Some people respond more powerfully to words, some more powerfully to 
pictures.  Personally, I prefer to use a combination of the two.  Why?  Well 
you may as well cover all angles.   
 
So you should experiment with whatever style suits you the best and play 
with that.  You may want to try both at the same time and just see how that 
works.   
 
The 4 Classic Suggestion Styles 
There are four classic styles we’ll be covering today.  There are: 
 
1. Affirmation suggestions,

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         129
2. Inner pep talk,  
3. Rehearsal visualizations, and  
4. Goal visualizations   
 
We’ll cover each of those in turn to really look at how they work and how to 
make them work for you.   
 
Again, these aren’t the full range of suggestion styles.  There are many 
different ways of suggesting things.  These are the classics, the easiest to 
get used to, to learn and what will tend to have the most direct and powerful 
results when they're working for you.   
 
Beware Dirty Goals 
If these don’t work for you, chances are somewhere along the lines you’ve 
got a dirty goal.  In other words, you’ve created some kind of conscious/ 
unconscious conflict.  Your conscious mind is either trying too hard or in 
some respects activating something at the unconscious level that is resisting 
or inhibiting a response.   
 
The Solution To Dirty Goals 
If something like that tends to happen, there’s no problem at all skip on to 
day six and on day six we’ll teach you different ways of dealing with exactly 
that kind of response.   
 
As a rule of thumb always go with the simplest to the most sophisticated.  
The classic styles are simplest, the most efficient and effective way of using 
suggestions so you may as well use those at the beginning and then 
troubleshoot them with the day six kind of suggestions, as and when you 
need to.   
 
Track 4 – How To Use The Classics 
Time: 10m 24s 
 
 
Let’s turn out attention to how to use the classics.  Remember, the classics 
are affirmation suggestions, the inner pep talk, rehearsal visualizations and 
end goal visualizations.

Rule 1: Stick To The 21 Day Cycle 
The first thing to remember is the all important 21-day cycle.  You want to 
repeat the same process 21 days in a row at the very least.  You can extend 
it and sometimes it will appropriate for you to do it for two, three or four 
months.  You should see results after 21 days.   
 
How To Troubleshoot The 21 Day Cycle 
If you're not seeing some form of positive results after 21 days you’ll need 
to start troubleshooting something in some way.  In other words, you’ll turn 
to the power pendulum, which we’ll talk more about tomorrow or you may 
want to turn to the alternative styles of suggestions, which we’ll discover on 
day six.   
 
For the moment, let’s stick to the idea of a 21-day cycle, because then you’ll 
either see results and, even if they're not 100% of what you want, at least 
you know “I’m there, I’m going the right way. I now need to continue and 
keep getting those results.”   
 
How To Prevent Backsliding  
As a rule, if you’ve gone through a 21-day cycle and you’ve switched to 
some other project inside your mind and all the progress you’ve made in 
those 21 days suddenly starts backsliding, that means that the ink hasn’t 
dried on the blueprint, so to speak.   
 
Therefore, you can back slide again, because the world around you is pulling 
you back to the old way of being.  If that happens and it’s no problem just 
carry on with the same suggestions.  Once you start seeing results you just 
keep going down the same track. 
 
Can I Work On Several Problems At Once? 
With experience, you’ll be able to maintain a kind of default set of 
suggestions for a project that you're working on over a longer period of 
time, start a separate project, which won’t interfere with that one and 
suggest two different things at the same time.

Initially, for the first six months or so, just stick to one simple topic.  Get 
used to the process, understand your own mind, get your intuitions in gear 
and as you're doing this you’ll start discovering better ways that suit you.   
 
So the Power of Self-Hypnosis Method, part of the power in it is that it gives 
you different approaches so you get to discover how your mind likes to do 
things.  Then you get to do it your way.  The best way for things to work will 
be your way, not my way.  These are the foundations and basic tools, which 
you will adapt to suit yourself and that’s the 21-day cycle.   
 
Rule 2: How Often & How Long Should I Practice? 
The next thing to look at is how often and how long.   
  
The general rule is five to ten minutes per session.  If you want to have a 
long session and go for it, 15 minutes is the tops.  You want to do it two to 
three times per day and no more than that.  If you end up doing it for an 
hour a day, five times a day and you then spend most of your day in 
hypnosis then this is not a practical tool anymore.   
 
Remember To Live Your Life! 
Remember, the power of Self-Hypnosis is that you get to live your life and 
allow your unconscious mind to do all the other things.   
 
If you had to hide in a cave, become a monk and meditate for 10 years 
before you could come back and live life even vaguely happily, you’ve just 
wasted 10 years of your life where you could be doing all kinds of other 
wonderful things.   
 
The power of the Power of Self-Hypnosis Method is that it’s quick, fast easy 
and its fun.  So treat it as a quick blitz, get your mind sorted and then carry 
on your day with that afterglow.   
 
As a rule it’s five or ten minutes per session, two to three times per day.   
 
The Perfect Time To Practice The Power Self-Hypnosis Method 
The two times I strongly encourage you to use are the two times where Self-
Hypnosis has the most power in your entire day.

The first time is immediately upon waking up, when you're still in that sort of 
half, mystical state between sleep and waking and you haven’t completely 
woken up, but you're not falling asleep anymore.   
 
So that first half hour after wakening, your mind is still in that shall we say, 
sleep hangover, it still has elements of sleep time going on, which is the 
royal road to your unconscious.  Whilst you're still in that zone that’s a 
perfect time to do Self-Hypnosis, because you're going to ride on the coat 
tails of a totally natural process anyway.   
 
 
 
The next time, which is absolutely ideal for Self-Hypnosis is just before you 
go to sleep and that’s partly because it will help you go to sleep.  We’ll talk 
more about how to cure insomnia and sleep like a log any time you want on 
day seven.   
 
An Insider’s Secret To Timing 
The other reason is if you do your Self-Hypnosis session immediately before 
going to sleep then you go to bed and fall sleep.  At that point there’s no 
time left for your conscious mind to start worrying or thinking about stuff 
and digging it all up again.   
 
So it’s like watering your plants and then leaving the garden so that even if 
you're tempted to you're just not physical present enough to dig up the 
roots to check how the whole thing is going, holding it up to the sunlight and 
so on.  If you're not in the garden you can’t groom the garden and nature 
can take its course. 
 
In the same way, if you fall asleep right after you’ve done all of your self-
suggestions, your Self-Hypnosis program then your conscious mind is offline 
so it can’t interfere with the process, because you’ll be asleep.   
 
Also, sleep time is a perfect for integrating experiences that’s what dreams 
are there for.  You get to integrate all the things you’ve experienced during 
the day so your unconscious mind can make sense of it and adopt it into its 
new blueprint for the next day.   
 
What better time to start priming and preparing the unconscious mind with a 
certain kind of blueprint then immediately before the time, in which it’s 
going to reset the blueprint anyway?

Therefore, morning first thing within half an hour of waking up, evening last 
thing just before you go to bed, just a quick five minutes and you're away.   
 
Other Useful Times To Practice 
If you want to do it three times a day, another time you could do it is up to 
you.  You can do it at lunch time – when I was a lawyer, especially the first 
few months when I was struggling to keep awake all day long, because they 
were long days – I used to lock myself in the staff toilet for a 20 or 30 
minutes at lunch to do a little Self-Hypnosis.   
 
I wish I’d known then what I know now, because I could have done it much 
quicker.  Five or ten minutes and no one would have known any difference 
and I could have carried on with my day.   
 
 
Another useful time is when you come home so you can break up your work 
day and your home day.  Self-hypnosis is a great way to switch gears inside 
the mind.   
 
Use Your Biorhythm 
Other times, as a rule, the later in the day it gets the better of more 
susceptible you're going to be to Self-Hypnosis.  It’s to do with your daily 
rhythms and how your mind/body interaction works.   
 
Again, it depends on your so experiment; you might be one who enjoys their 
Self-Hypnosis in the morning and it works for you, in which case, ignore my 
suggestion and just go with a morning session. 
 
The key thing is to find your own times.   
 
The one thing I know for sure is the first half hour after waking up and 
within five minutes of going to sleep those are the two key times when the 
power of Self-Hypnosis will work for you.

Rule 3: Pay Attention 
The next general rule is the attention rule.   
 
You need to have attention.  Attention is like a gardening tool, your hoe.  It’s 
the thing that is going to create the space in the ground for the seed to go 
in.  If you don't have full attention on it, it means that you risk digging a 
hole that’s too shallow so the seed doesn't have a chance to grow, so 
attention is key.   
 
You must give your full attention to it.   
 
Insider’s Attention Secret 1: Silence The Gatekeeper 
Also, by the way, if your full attention isn’t on it that means you have some 
attention left over to think of other things, which means you leave the door 
open for the gatekeeper to come back online, to have doubts and conflicting 
messages so give it your full attention.   
 
Insider’s Attention Secret 2: Relax! 
Put any other ideas out of your mind and think only about only the 
suggestion, but do it with a relaxed focus.  The last thing you want is to 
create stress or tension.  The key to opening the window to your 
unconscious mind at this point is relaxation.   
 
Does that mean you can’t do Self-Hypnosis without relaxation?   
 
No.  You can do very successful Self-Hypnosis without even a hint of 
relaxation.  However, relaxation is one of the easiest routes in and it’s got all 
kinds of wonderful health benefits also.  You may as well combine those two 
effects and take advantage of them in your Self-Hypnosis practice.   
 
A Quick Summary Of The Rules So Far 
Give it your full attention; keep a relaxed focus as part of having a receptive 
mind, 21-day cycles, two to three times a day, five to ten minutes per 
session and you're in good shape for mastering the power of Self-Hypnosis 
inside your life.

Additional Keys For Suggestions Success  
A couple of extra keys to augmenting the power of what you're doing.  
 
Keep Yourself Busy – Immerse Yourself In Life 
Remember, you want to make sure that your conscious mind isn’t interfering 
in the process.  Once you’ve done your five to ten minutes and you come 
back out of hypnosis, stop thinking about it.  Just get on with your life.  Get 
busy, do work, play, do art, call your friends, have fun.  Keep yourself busy.   
 
The busier the conscious mind is the more freedom your unconscious mind 
has to plan and put things into action for you.  If you do end up thinking of 
the situation, whatever project you have in mind or goal you’ve been 
programming yourself with, just do it with an inner smile, a sense of “good 
things are happening here” and then get back with your regular, every day 
schedule.   
 
If You Need To Troubleshoot… 
If you can’t, if you find yourself obsessing with what you're doing and 
thinking about it more and more, wondering if it’s working, is the suggestion 
good enough and that sort of thing -- it’s time to troubleshoot.   
 
Again, day five and six will give you some great troubleshooting methods 
either the power pendulum or alternative styles for using the power of 
suggestion to get the results you want.   
 
If you need to go that far, go there, but always begin with the stuff we're 
doing today, because that’s the starting point.  There’s no need to 
troubleshoot something if there is no trouble in the first place.   
 
Track 5 – How To Simplify Your Power Self-Hypnosis Technique 
Time: 8m 31s 
 
 
Before we start with the actual four classic suggestion styles, I’d like to talk 
a little more about simplifying your power of Self-Hypnosis practice for 
moment.

For the first couple of days it was appropriate for you to go through the full 
method and all the different steps in between just to make sure you have all 
of the boxes checked.  Now we’re going to start rounding off the edges a bit 
to make your Self-Hypnosis practice easier, quicker and faster.   
 
Simplifying Down To The CAVE Cycle 
Therefore, we’re going to stick with the CAVE cycle.  The CAVE cycle is now 
going to have two C’s in the beginning.   
 
1. The first ‘C’ is for clear in your mind.   
 
2. The second ‘C’ is back to the convincer, which clears the slate, getting 
you ready for Self-Hypnosis. 
 
 ‘A’ in CAVE stands for affirmations,  
 ‘V’ for visualizations, and  
 ‘E’ is for drifting and the ebb and flow of letting your unconscious 
mind take it wherever it goes.   
 
So the CAVE cycle is the key to the Power Self-Hypnosis Method. 
 
How To Prepare For Power Self-Hypnosis 
Before you begin, the first part of the CAVE cycle, the clearing of your mind 
part you want to set the scene up.  The two things you want to do before 
going in, is to set yourself a time limit and some kind of safety or emergency 
condition.  Here’s what I mean by that. 
 
Preparation Step 1: Set A Time Limit 
First of all, time limits.  Your unconscious mind has a tremendous biological 
clock.  You’ll have noticed that, for example, you can wake up in the 
morning on holiday at exactly the same time that you’d normally go to work. 
 
Why?  Because your unconscious mind is used to waking up at that time.  
There are people who have a favorite TV show and they just know each day 
when that show starts without having to look at their watch. 
 

 
                                      The Power of Self-Hypnosis for Guaranteed 
                                                   Results Home Study Program 
  
 
© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         137
Again, the unconscious mind has been sensitized and goes “Okay, this is 
important. we’ll make sure that when the clock strikes 12, six or whatever 
time it is that this person is ready to do what he needs to do”. 
 
Some people even have the ability to go into a meeting and say, I have 10 
minutes for this meeting.  I want to make sure it that I say everything that I 
need to say in those 10 minutes and have plenty of time to spare.   
 
Somehow the interaction at that point gets set in a way that everything gets 
said that needs to be said and 10 minutes later everyone walks out happy, 
having done what they came there to do. 
 
The power of the unconscious to do these things is tremendous.  I’d like you 
to start using that for yourself.  Rather than sitting in Self-Hypnosis and 
wondering, “Has it been five or ten minutes?  I don’t know.  Let’s have a 
quick look at my watch.”  If you do that guess what’s going to happen? 
 
Your gatekeeper is coming back online and basically the window of 
opportunity starts shutting down.  So what you want is to set the conditions 
where your conscious mind has as little involvement as possible so you can 
turn over the responsibility, effort and work over to your unconscious mind. 
 
How To Set A Time Limit 
The first thing you do is set a time limit.   
 
The way you do this is very simple.  As you begin your Self-Hypnosis 
practice you’ll have a look at your watch.  Let’s say its 7:05 in the morning 
you’ve just gotten up and you say to yourself:  
 
“I’m under this Self-Hypnosis is now using the power of Self-Hypnosis 
method.  I want to spend five minutes in Self-Hypnosis.  At the end of five 
minutes, unconscious mind please bring me out of this spontaneously.”  
 
That’s it that’s all you do.  Then you go into a Self-Hypnosis, do your whole 
CAVE cycle and then as you are drifting through you’ll feel a sense of well 
it’s time I feel like opening my eyes now, just open your eyes.

How To Adjust Your Inner Clock 
Some of you will hit five minutes dead on target.  When I teach Self-
Hypnosis to people, typically half to maybe three quarters of the room will 
get it right on target every time.  For the rest of you there’s a simple 
solution you will either go a little bit under or a little bit over. 
 
It doesn’t matter if you go under or over it’s totally irrelevant.  The point is 
as soon as you come out of Self-Hypnosis have a look at your watch and 
note the time.  If it’s been seven minutes instead of five, just notice it.  If 
it’s 10 minutes instead of five, just notice that. 
 
There’s nothing you need to do in terms of correcting things.  Your 
unconscious mind will correct it automatically.  The only thing you have to 
do is feed it input.  
 
“I started at 7:05, I wanted to do five minutes, I should have finished at 
7:10 and I’ve finished at 7:12.  Okay that’s it– noted.” 
 
 
 
Next time you might finish at 7:09, which means you went a little under 
that’s fine, you’re correcting a little bit.  Over the period of a week or two 
you’ll find that the corrections become smaller and smaller until you start 
hitting bang on 5, 7, 10 minutes, whatever target you set for yourself.   
 
That’s a terrific time, because that will be another proof, another convincer 
that your unconscious is listening and giving you the results that you want.   
 
Preparation Step 2: Emergency Response Instructions 
The second thing you want to do before you begin is to set your safety or 
emergency response instructions.   
 
This is a safety statement to say that:  
 
“if at any point during the next five or 10 minutes that I do Self-Hypnosis 
and an emergency happens, someone needs my attention or calls or I need 
to be alert on the outside.  So I’ll instantly come outside being totally 
refreshed, revitalize and ready to deal with whatever is happening.”

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         139
That basically takes care of the situation where you’re in Self-Hypnosis and 
the cat starts a fire in the house.  You don’t want to spend the next 10 
minutes finishing your Self-Hypnosis practice before realizing the house is on 
fire. 
 
Luckily, the unconscious mind is constantly monitoring the outside 
environment for you, which means you don’t have to.  If something 
happens, some kind of emergency that needs your attention, simply by 
making this set up statement ahead of time, the unconscious will go, “Hang 
on a second!  Something is going on here, I better get your attention.”   
 
Then pop out of trance, look around go “It’s a little warm in here.  Let’s get 
out of the house.”  It’s a very simple thing and you’ll almost never use it, 
but it’s good to have it there in case you need it. 
 
Review Of Preparation Stage 
So you begin with the two simple setup instructions.   
 
Time limit: five minutes.   
 
Safety instructions: if in those five minutes anything happens on the outside 
that needs my attention I’ll come back fully alert and ready to deal with it 
and that takes 10 seconds, no time at all. 
 
The Improved CAVE Cycle 
The next you begin the CAVE cycle.   
 
Step 1: Clear Your Mind 
You begin the CAVE by clearing your mind.  Remember how you cleared 
your mind before?  You look to the spot on the wall, focus your attention, 
took a deep breath, relax, looked at your arm, connected to the arm and 
close your eyes that whole cycle is one step.   
 
It takes no time at all to clear your mind, relax, take a breath, close your 
eyes and get awareness of your arm that’s it.  Again, it will take you all of 
two seconds now, because you’ve been doing it all ready for the last couple 
of days.

If you find it difficult just clear your mind, take a breath, relax a little bit, 
close your eyes and get a sense of connection to your arm and just carry 
right on with the exercise we did on day two.  If that’s getting a little bit long 
winded by now – which hopefully it will be – then just go straight through 
the clearing thing.   
 
Step 2: Convincer – Arm Relaxed 
Go “Okay, clear mind, closed eyes, connection to the arm, now I start the 
Convincer stage of the CAVE cycle.”   
 
The Convincer stage is that you talk to your arm and say arm relaxing- 
relaxing- relaxing.  Each time you say relaxing, each time you talk to your 
arm and say to “the arm relaxing” or “the arm is heavy” – you pause for a 
moment and get a sense of what’s going on in the arm. 
 
Remember, the crucial thing is you’re not doing it.  It’s not up to your 
conscious mind to make anything happen.  The conscious mind sets the 
direction and then observes to check that the unconscious mind is doing it 
that’s it. 
 
If you try to make it happen consciously, then you start interfering with the 
process again.  That doesn’t mean you can’t start off doing it consciously, by 
all means do so, but the key is your conscious mind says “This is what I 
want.” and the unconscious mind says “Yes boss!” and does it. 
 
So that’s part of the training process that the convincing and the CAVE 
cycles do for you.   
 
Step 3: “AVE” – Affirm, Visualize & Drift 
A review of the general outline:  
 
1. We have the set-ups, time and safety.   
2. We have the clearing of the mind and  
3. We just go back to the regular CAVE cycle that you’re already familiar 
with. 
 
On the next track we’ll introduce to you the power of affirmations and how 
to make them work for you.

Track 6 – How To Use Affirmation Suggestions 
Time: 10m 09s 
 
 
Let’s talk about Affirmations now.   
 
A lot of you will be familiar with regular affirmations:  
 
Every day, in every way I feel better and better.   
I’m strong like a tiger.   
I’m healthy, strong and fit…  
 
those sorts of things.   
 
Why Regular Affirmations Can Fail – And How To Fix That! 
What most people don’t realize is that affirmations or at least the way most 
people use affirmations is incorrect they don’t even know where affirmations 
came from.   
 
The French Connection  
Affirmations were created by a French hypnotist called Emile Coué.  He was 
one of the very first self-improvement authors ever.  He cut the very first 
self-improvement recording on one of those vinyl disks back in 1901 or 
1902.   
 
The thing that was missed when people started doing affirmations was that 
Emile Coué actually was training his subjects (his patients) to respond 
before beginning the affirmation cycles.  So whilst people think it’s enough 
to just say these positive messages to yourself, it’s not.   
 
Remember The All Important Receptive Mind 
What you want to do is create the receptive mind so those positive 
messages have somewhere to go.  The way Emile Coué used to do it is he’d 
spend a couple of days training people with lots of different convincers – 
eyes locking down, arms heavy, impossible to move -- all the classic things 
you maybe have seen stage hypnotists do.

Why Training A Receptive Mind Is Crucial 
Once people had all of those convincers out of the way, their body and mind 
were conditioned and ready so when affirmations came their way, they act 
out and respond to them as part of their new reality.   
 
If you don’t have that training phase then affirmations are very much hit or 
miss.  All of the rules of affirmations, if you're familiar with them still count 
before affirmation suggestion starts.   
 
How CAVE Creates A Receptive Mind 
It’s just that with the CAVE cycle you're creating the most important thing of 
all: a window of opportunity for the affirmations to actually stick to 
something.   
 
The convincer cycle, making the arm heavy just by telling it to get heavy is 
the same thing that the old French hypnotist Emile Coué used to do over two 
or three days.   
 
We now know that it takes much less time and it’s much quicker for you to 
do.  All you're doing is creating a receptive mind, so now you can make 
affirmations work for you very quickly.   
 
The Rules For Formulating Affirmation Suggestions 
In case you're not familiar with affirmations, let me give you a bit of training 
in how to use them.   
 
Rule 1: Statements Of Fact 
First of all, an affirmation is a simple statement of intent or of fact that you 
want to be true in your life.   
 
There are a couple of things you want to include or a couple of ways that 
you want to make sure your affirmations are structured  
 
Rule 2: KISS Them! 
First, use the KISS principle, keep it simple.

Keep the affirmation simple; you don’t want to spend 15 pages of tightly 
type written text describing every possible nuance of what you want.  
 
Why?   
 
Because of that conscious mind thinking and if you're going to have to try 
and memorize all of that you'll activate the conscious mind again, which 
means the gatekeeper is going to be ready to start knocking balls right out 
of the court again and you're back to square one. 
 
You're going to keep it so simple that you can easily recall the affirmation 
without any effort at all.  The rule is keep is under 10 words, if you can, so 
it’s easy for you to recall.   
 
Some Examples 
Classic ones are: 
 
 
Every day and in every way I’m feeling better and better.   
 
I’m getting stronger and healthier as the days go by. 
 
I’m a happy, healthy, vibrant person.   
 
People like me and I like people.   
 
 
 
Notice how we're keeping very simple ideas and we're able to repeat them 
simply, easily and powerfully within the mind.   
 
Rule 3: Be Positive  
The next thing, which you may have noticed about those ideas, they're all 
phrased in the positive.   
 
Positives are two things.   
 
1. First of all, they're positive in terms of positive thinking.  I'm happy, 
I’m a winner.  They're about good things, things you want.   
 
2. The other side of being positive is you stay away from negative 
phrasing.   
 
 
I don’t want to smoke.

 
I don’t want to be lazy. 
 
I don’t want to be fat. 
 
I don’t want to be unhappy.   
 
Beware Red Cats! 
Notice what you're doing there.  The word picture you're creating is initially 
of a thing that you don’t want.   
 
You don’t want to have any contradictory suggestions inside your mind.   
 
Think of it this way, if I say to you: “Don’t think of a red cat sitting in a red 
tree, don’t think of that pesky little cat sitting in a red tree opening a little 
red can or red beer, drinking it, smiling that red Cheshire cat grin and going, 
Aaah!”   
 
What have I done?   
 
Basically, I’ve described a little scene for you.  By asking you to not think 
about it, you can’t, not think about it without thinking about it first.  If I tell 
you “Don’t think about a spoon. Whatever you do, just forget about a 
spoon.”  Chances are the only way you can forget about it is to think about 
something else.   
 
Here’s the kicker, most people when they try not to think about the spoon, 
do you know what they think about?   
 
A fork or a knife. In other words other cutlery. 
 
But why do they think of cutlery why not an orange, a tree, a beach or a 
whale?  Because it's already too late, the fact that they mentioned the spoon 
opens up the train of associations and the things we pick out is one that is 
close to it like a knife or a fork or something like that.   
 
As a result, the negative suggestion, the spoon has already impacted you on 
some level.  To avoid that in the first place, phrase your affirmation in the 
positive.   
 
I want this, NOT, I don’t want that.

Rule 4: To Be Or To Become 
The next thing to do is ‘becoming’ or ‘is’.   
 
In other words, here’s how an affirmation can be turned around into wishful 
thinking that might not do very good for you.   
 
“One day, I’ll be happy.  Some day I’ll be a millionaire.”   
 
The problem with those ideas is that you don’t specify anything.  Your 
unconscious mind works in the present tense it doesn't know about the past 
or the future, it just has a now.   
 
So if you start talking about the future, it goes “okay, some day maybe – 
well that’s not today!” so it doesn't even start doing anything with it.  
Sometimes it will, but again you're not hedging your bets or making your 
probabilities work for you.   
 
The way you want to phrase it is along the lines of: 
 
 I’m attracting millions or I’m a millionaire. 
 I have what it takes to be a millionaire. 
 I’m becoming a millionaire every single day. 
 I’m becoming wealthier and wealthier every single day. 
 My mind is finding the secrets to make me a millionaire. 
 I’m becoming a millionaire.   
 
Notice what I’m doing.  It’s either about becoming, I’m becoming a 
millionaire or it’s about being something, I’m a happy person, right now.   
 
‘Be’ Goals – v- ‘Becoming’ Goals 
Let’s face it there’s nothing keeping you from being happy this moment right 
now, there’s just nothing to prevent you from it except your own mind.   
 
Some goals will be becoming goals like maybe becoming a millionaire so it 
gives you time to achieve it.  Other goals you may as well straight away 
“This is it. I’m here, right now, having it.”   
 
Does it mean you stay there?

No.   
 
Sure, during the course of the day you might find yourself drifting away from 
that happiness or that glow that you had during your session that’s no 
problem.   
 
As the days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months and so on, you're 
unconscious mind gets the message.  You’ll be happier as the days go by, 
which means it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and that’s what you want. 
So keep it simple, keep it positive and keep it in the now.   
 
How & When To Use Affirmation Suggestions 
Affirmations are used during the ‘A’ part of the CAVE cycle.  Actually, believe 
it or not, you’re beginning with affirmations already when you’re saying “My 
right arm is relaxing” – guess what that is?  
 
It’s an affirmation of suggestion, simple, pure and direct! 
 
Then you're going to use the actual affirmation that you want – for example:  
 
I’m healthy and happy.   
 
Great.  Now you're going to repeat it.   
 
The Keys To Using Affirmations Effectively 
The key to using affirmations are following:  
 
Key 1: Enthusiasm 
Be enthusiastic.  Say it with absolute conviction and meaning.   
 
Here is what I mean. Don’t do this: 
 
[with a bored and sluggish tone] My arm is relaxing, relaxing, relaxing.  Yes, 
my arm is relaxing.  Yeah, relaxing, relaxing, relaxing, relaxing.   
 
How much of an impact has that got?  You can hear in the tone of my voice 
that I don’t even mean it.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         147
Here’s the other thing to your voice:  
 
[with a stressed and high pressure tone] My right arm relaxing, relaxing, 
come on, relax, relax, come on arm, relax, relaxing, relaxing, come on, 
come on, relaxing that’s it that’s it relaxing, relaxing, relaxing, come on, 
relaxing.   
 
Again, notice what’s happening with my tone of voice now.   
 
Key 2: Be Engaged 
In the first one I was disengaged.  In the second one I wanted too much, 
I’m over engaging, I’m getting stressed about the whole thing.  You want to 
make sure that your instructions, your affirmation suggestions come across 
meaningfully.   
 
[with a fluid, relaxed tone] My right arm is relaxing, it’s relaxing.   
 
Key 3: Take Time To Absorb The Impact/Meaning Of EACH Suggestion 
Take a few moments to absorb the meaning of it.  It’s relaxing.  Get a sense 
of what your arm relaxing means.  In the same way if you have a suggestion 
for example, for health.   
 
My body is healing…  My body is healing…  It’s healing itself, it’s healing…   
 
Notice each time that you make the affirmation mentally what you’re doing 
is getting a sense of what it means.  I’m not just reciting these things 
blankly and hoping for the best, I’m getting a sense of this is what it means.   
 
It’s a sense of my body being vibrant, healthy and alive, it’s healing itself.   
 
 
Incidentally I’m using these suggestions on myself right now, because I’ve 
been to the dentist and had an operation.  So whilst I’m teaching you this 
stuff, I’m actually doing it as well!   
 
Clarification Of Key 3: Pause & Reflect 
Take your time to pause and reflect.  “What do you really mean?” when you 
make each affirmation to get that impact inside you.  Having enthusiasm,

enjoy it, put emotion into it and feel it working just by understanding the 
meaning of it.   
 
How does your arm feel when it’s relaxing?  The arm is relaxing.  It’s 
amazing.  It’s relaxing.  Those are the key secrets to making affirmations 
work for you.   
 
Track 7 – How To Use The Inner Pep Talk 
Time: 7m 04s 
 
 
Let’s move on to the inner pep talk.   
 
It’s like the same idea as an affirmation only this time you're not going to go 
in with an advanced script or any ideas.  You're going to come with a sense 
of something you want to achieve.   
 
Inner Pep Talk: The Basic Outline 
The way you’ll use the pep talk is during the affirmation stage of the CAVE 
cycle you’ll give yourself a pep talk.  You're going to talk about your goal, 
outcome, what you want and how good it feels.   
 
A Quick Example 
A quick example of how I do it, in the case of the operation on my tooth and 
getting the gums to heal again.  I’m getting in there, convincer, arm is 
relaxing, relaxing, relaxing, very good, thank you very much.   
 
At this point I start talking to myself saying:  
 
“I have an amazing capacity to heal.  I don’t know how my body heals, but 
it’s healed so many times in the past.  I’ve had paper cuts, serious injuries 
and every single time my body has healed it to the point where most times I 
can’t even tell I’ve had it.   
 
“My unconscious mind is healing my gums right now.  It’s healing my gums, 
because that’s what it does best.  I can feel my gums healing and being 
restored to perfect health.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         149
“There’s a blueprint inside my mind that tells it how to have perfect health.  
My unconscious mind created my body in the first place.  It had to figure out 
how to do it.  I know it can do it.  It can heal my gums the same way it’s 
healed everything else.   
 
“It can heal my gums, quickly and easily and as a result I feel a sense of 
comfort that’s it.  I can feel that comfort now developing all across my jaw 
and in my body.  That sense of comfort just proves to me once again that 
that infinite power, the intelligence that lies deep within me is healing my 
gums.   
 
“So in next to no time that gum will be totally healed and I won’t even notice 
it; it will be as though it’s always been perfectly healthy that gum is 
perfectly.  It’s as good as being perfectly healthy right now, because I know 
that my unconscious mind is on the job and I trust my unconscious mind to 
make it healthy, to heal it quickly, easily, with no fuss at all.”   
 
Notice what I’ve been doing there.  I’m using affirmations, but rather than 
thinking about them ahead of time I’m not even thinking as I’m saying it.   
 
Speak Before You Think! 
You know the old adage, think before you speak?   
 
We're going to put it on its head.   
 
If you're doing the pep talk you're going to speak before you think!  
 
That way you keep your conscious mind to a minimum, but get you 
enthused about the things going on for you.   
 
Here’s the thing about the inner pep talk.  The key to using it is being in the 
state where you’ve been dragged along by the feeling of what you're doing.  
If you find yourself getting too intellectual, too divorced from what’s going 
on, at that point your intellect is kicking in and you don’t want that.   
 
Key Secret 1: Use Your State (Mood) 
You want to be surrounded by this pleasant glow of the power of Self-
Hypnosis, the positive glow of that trance experience you're having and be

infused by that.  Let that carry you away and create that inner pep talk for 
yourself.   
 
Key Secret 2: Use The Right Attitude 
What we don’t want to do is analytically think about all the things you're 
going to say and how you're going to say it.  Think of it this way, the way I 
do it inside my mind is I imagine I have a little kid sitting on my lap.  He’s 
got a problem and I’m going to give him a little pep talk.   
 
 
I’m not going to think about it.  I'm going to smile at him, think how terrific 
he is and tell him exactly what’s going to happen as though my words have 
magic.  I’ll say  
 
“Hey, your mouth is healing right now.  You don’t know it, but it is.   
 
“Already the bleeding has stopped and you're feeling more comfortable and 
look, there is a little smile on your face that’s it, a little smile on your face 
that tells you your gums are already healing.  Isn’t it great to know that you 
can make your mouth do that without knowing how you're doing it?”   
 
By imagining that little child that we’re talking to that child is my 
unconscious, it gets me into that mood that sense of being able to do it 
without thinking about it too much.   
 
Key Secret 3: Pour Your Heart Out 
You want to pour your heart out.  The whole point is not to give an 
intellectual and logically defined systematic lecture on something.  You want 
to pour your heart out with things that you really mean.  It doesn't matter if 
you repeat or stumble over your words from time to time.   
 
What matters is that you're driving it with intensity, an intention that comes 
from deep inside of you.   
 
Key Secret 4: Be Superstitious – Call On A Higher Authority! 
In terms of the technique and the technicalities I like to use, one thing that 
works powerfully for the inner pep talk is to appeal to some kind of 
advanced wisdom, inner power, God, the universe, healing spirit whatever 
concept you’d like to use.

If you happen to be religiously minded it is a big bonus, because realizing 
that God is in everything is a great way of activating the power of your 
unconscious mind because that’s just part of how God moves through you 
and does His thing.   
 
The thing is, even if you're not religiously minded, if you're a complete 
atheist and rationalist, you still want to appeal to some kind of, shall we say 
higher authority, in whatever form appeals to you intellectually.  Because 
your unconscious mind is quite superstitious.   
 
To the extent that you appeal to some kind of a higher authority, something 
beyond your “normal self”, it allows that magical power that is inside of us 
that we normally leave untapped, it gives us a reason to be able to tap it.   
 
 
It’s like fooling the conscious mind saying  
 
“Don’t worry about it I know I’m not doing it we’ll let the universe do it or 
the healing intelligence or the infinite wisdom.”   
 
So you can talk about the infinite wisdom of the unconscious, the amazing 
power of your unconscious, leave it up to God, the universe, the Great Spirit 
or Manitou.  Whatever you want to call it, I don’t mind what it is.   
 
I do know that when you get the sense of appealing to or calling on a 
greater authority it creates a tremendous motivation for the unconscious 
mind to do its thing.  It’s a wonderful feather to put into your cap, a 
wonderful addition to draw the most juice out of your inner pep talk.   
 
If you find that kind of idea something you don’t want to do, by all means 
ignore it.  I just know that people who have used and are shown how to use 
this find that it helps them go beyond themselves in such a way that they 
can tap abilities that they might otherwise doubt that they may or may not 
have.   
 
Key Secret 5: Describe The outcome You Want 
The next thing to do is describe your outcome.  Describe what it means to 
have the outcome, the implications of the outcome.  Describe it and let 
those words keep falling out of yourself.

Remember, speak before your think.  Don’t analyze what you're doing 
emote, enthuse, use emotions to drive it and pour your heart out.  Feel the 
emotional impact as you make each remark.  If you do these things, you’ll 
have captured the essence of the inner pep talk.   
 
 
Track 8 – How To Visualize When You Think You Can’t! 
Time: 4m 32s 
 
 
Let’s turn our attention to visualizations.   
 
The first thing I want to do before we look at the process of visualization is 
for you to realize that everyone can visualize.  It’s totally natural.  There are 
a significant amount of people who think they can’t visualize.   
 
The Veil Of Consciousness 
What’s going on there is there is a veil of conscious, a barrier that’s been 
drawn across the unconscious.  So whilst you're visualizing -- your 
unconscious mind is doing it, but it’s not letting your intellect or conscious 
mind become aware of the fact that you are doing it.   
 
 
 
The reasons for this can be many fold and complex.  Primarily it tends to be 
along the lines of, as a child you're told, don’t dream –  
 
“Don’t worry, it’s just a dream…”  
“You’ve got to tell the difference between your dreams, your imagination 
and reality, and that’s just that…”   
 
One way some people cope is to draw that veil of conscious across their 
mind saying, “Okay, I just won’t make any pictures.  That way what I see is 
real and what I don’t see isn’t real.”   
 
It doesn't mean that you don’t make pictures; it’s just that your conscious 
mind isn’t aware of them so that you can tell the difference between reality 
and non-reality and to be honest with you that’s a technical description and 
not relevant.

How To Visualize Despite The Veil Of Consciousness 
Anyone can visualize.  I can make them work for you beautifully.  Here’s an 
example:  
 
You live in a house.  For a moment I’d like you to think about your front 
door.  You know there’s a certain color and it’s made of a certain material.  
Some front doors are wood, some white, green, yellow, black or pink 
whatever.   
 
So think about the color of your front door and what is the material it’s 
made of?   
 
The next thing is to answer the question of what kind of door handle do you 
have?   
 
Some doors have a round knob, some have handles you pull down, 
sometimes you pull up.  Some have little buttons you press different doors 
open different ways.   
 
 What kind of handle is on your door?   
 
 What would it be like if you swapped that handle with a different type 
of handle?  If it’s a normal handle that you pull down, what if you 
changed it to a doorknob?   
 
 What if there was no handle there at all?   
 
 What if your door was painted pink with black polka dots?  Would you 
like that?   
 
 How about yellow and green stripes how would you enjoy that?   
 
What Visualizing REALLY Means  
Notice in order to answer those questions you have to make mental pictures.  
Whether or not you can see those pictures consciously is irrelevant. 
Whatever you're doing to answer my question -- that’s a visualization!

How To Improve Your Visualizations 
I can take you through a whole trip throughout your house and that would 
build the imagination process.  In fact, you may as well do that as an 
exercise if you think you can’t visualize.   
 
Open the front door go into the hallway and notice things that are there.  Is 
there a hat stand, a table or a mirror?  Are there stairs or not?  Is the floor 
made of carpet or wood?  What is that made of?  Which door leads to your 
living room or kitchen? 
 
Go ahead and enter your kitchen for a moment and notice the different 
colors there.   
 
 What things are inside your kitchen?   
 How many chairs do you have?  
 What material is the table made from?   
 What is the stove made from?   
 Is it gas or electric?   
 Is there an oven there?   
 Do you have pots and pans on the stove or are they all neatly tucked 
away in the cupboard?   
 
Notice, I’m asking you for visual information.  In order to answer that you 
have to make pictures.  Whatever you're doing to answer those questions 
even at the rate of pace I’m going at it right now, that’s visualization and 
that’s enough.   
 
Visualization Secret: Just Pretend! 
If you pretend that you're seeing things in the way that you might be 
pretending right now, over time your unconscious mind realizes its okay for 
him to start seeing inner pictures again.  It just unleashes or unhinges the 
veil so you can start seeing all the pictures you will be making anyway.   
 
This is totally safe, because you're making those pictures all along, so 
whether you're conscious of them or not is totally irrelevant as far as your 
unconscious mind is concerned.  It’s very useful for your conscious mind, 
because now you can check and enjoy your mental imagery as well.

Further Visualization Exercises 
More importantly, it helps you in terms of using the visualization parts of the 
hypnotic process.  I’d like you to spend a few minutes mentally puttering 
around your house, looking at the different colors, shapes, different objects, 
moving them mentally around the house and asking yourself if you like it 
that way.   
 
Painting the house in different colors and seeing if you’d like it that way, just 
as a way of warming up your visualization muscle so you get a sense that 
you don’t have to see those pictures for those pictures to be there.   
 
When you’ve done that for a little while, join me on the next track when I’ll 
show you how to use that to achieve your goals.   
 
Track 9 – How To Use Hypnotic Visualizations 
Time: 7m 34s 
 
Welcome back again.   
 
Let’s talk about how to use visualizations as part of the hypnotic process.   
 
Two Types Of Visualizations 
Remember, the ‘V’ part of the CAVE cycle is for visualizations.  So you’ll be 
visualizing either a rehearsal or something you want to achieve in terms of a 
specific skill, the way a meeting goes or an outcome at the end of it.   
 
Type 1: Rehearsal Visualizations 
The difference between those two is very simple.  You rehearse a skill, you 
rehearse something you want to do and you know the steps you want to go 
through to get it done.   
 
Type 2: Outcome Visualizations 
If you don’t know what specific steps to take, for example, if you take an 
exam, but you don’t know what questions are going to be in the exam, it’s 
going to be difficult to rehearse the exam mentally.  So instead of rehearsing

the exam itself, you can rehearse taking the exam generally and importantly 
you can rehearse the outcome.   
 
You can go to the end of the exam feeling like a million bucks having 
finished the exam.  You can get the examination envelope back at the end 
with full marks that sort of thing.   
 
How To Use Visualizations In Self-Hypnosis 
The visualization process is simple.  All you do using as many senses as 
possible, you create as rich, detailed experience of whatever it is that you 
want.   
 
Example 1: Hypnotically Rehearsing A Golf Swing 
Let’s say you're going to use your rehearsal process to improve your golf 
swing.  You're going to sit there and in your CAVE cycle when you get to the 
affirmation or visualization part, you're going to imagine yourself holding 
that club with that special grip that you have.   
 
You're going to feel those hands lifting up into the air until it’s holding the 
right angle.  You're going to make sure that your eyes are looking in the 
right direction.  If it’s the ball, then you look at the ball.  If it’s out into the 
green you look into the green whichever way you do it.   
 
Then you're going to start feeling the sense of the grip tightening as the 
swing begins to happen.  As that swing begins to hit its arc, your eyes see 
whatever they see when you have a perfect shot.  You feel that ball 
connecting as that club hits it.   
 
You hear that whacking sound and whishing as you have a follow through.  
You feel the body turning around, your shoulder’s alignment is changing, 
you look out at the far distance seeing that ball becoming a little dot rapidly 
and that’s a rehearsal process. 
 
You can rehearse any skill -- playing the piano, talking to people, having a 
speech or presentation -- anything that you can do and repeat, you can 
mentally rehearse.

Example 2: Hypnotically Installing A Million Dollar Goal 
The same is true for your goals.  In terms of your goals go to the end state, 
the outcome what is it that you want?   
 
Let’s say that your goal is to make millions.  You can present them 
symbolically.   
 
For example, you can picture the exciting day when you receive mail from 
your bank.  You open the statement, you pull out an envelope and you see 
$100,000 in one month, another $100,000 there, $50,000, $200,000, half a 
million.  The big balance at the end is $1,234,517.12.   
 
You look at that and you feel fantastic.  You put the statement away 
somewhere where you can go back to it later on.  You go hug your wife and 
children.  You call your friends and tell them what an amazing month you’ve 
had, that sort of stuff.   
 
The Key Differences in Visualizing Rehearsals – v – Goals  
Notice that we're implying the outcome by all the things you’ll do as a result 
of it.  The key to using outcomes or goal visualizations is to let your 
unconscious mind take you there.  You don’t have to set the steps.   
 
When you're doing the rehearsal you want to create the steps, because you 
know what it should be like.  You know what it’s like to hold a club, you 
know what a perfect swing feels like or looks like, you know the little 
technicalities that you should be getting right and do on.   
 
The difference between that and going straight for the goal for example, 
winning your first golf tournament, is that you don’t necessarily know all the 
steps you need to go through to get there.   
 
Remember: Trust The Tortoise (Unconscious) Not The Hare (Conscious)s 
You might know some of those steps, but why not leave it up to your 
unconscious mind that can find even better steps and better ways of doing 
it?   
 
Why not leave it up to your unconscious so rather than spending ten years 
perfecting the one tournament and maybe winning it, you can spend a year

having these wonderful experiences and at the end of it, you accidentally 
win the tournament, even though you didn't mean to, because you joined it 
for fun.   
 
Your unconscious mind was ready for you and decided to make it happen 
anyway.  Remember, this is why we're betting on the tortoise -- partly 
because you don’t have to think about it anymore.  You just set the goal and 
you get on with your life.   
 
 
You Still Have To Engage Life! 
Does this mean you sit back, become a couch potato and let life come to 
you?   
 
No!!   
 
Remember we talked about the golden tickets and the little opportunities 
that are surrounding us constantly?  What you're doing is preparing your 
mind to see the opportunities when they arise and take them.   
 
If you're stuck at home watching TV and eating potato chips, how many 
opportunities are floating around inside your house?  Not as many as outside 
in the real world with real people with lots of interactions and a lot of 
exciting things going on.     
 
You do still have a responsibility to live your life which is why, again, I say 
when you're using suggestions and the power of Self-Hypnosis for yourself, 
you don’t have to be spending two, three or four hours a day in it.   
 
You spend five, ten or twenty minutes tops so you can get out there and 
enjoy your life and make the most of it, while still knowing that your 
unconscious mind is on the case, on the program and doing your thing for 
you.   
 
Hypnotic Visualization Practice Session 
So in terms of visualizations, choose one of your goals now that we started 
off today’s session with and then do the following– in a moment I’ll take you 
through the highlights again– Start the whole CAVE cycle and when you get 
to the affirmation stage, come up with a very simple affirmation.   
 

 
                                      The Power of Self-Hypnosis for Guaranteed

An example for the golf thing might be something like:  
 
“I have a perfect, smooth golf swing.”   
 
That may be a classic affirmation suggestion for a perfect, smooth golf 
swing.   
 
Sticking with the idea of golf let’s say that you're going to go through a 
visual rehearsal technique. As part of the support thing so you repeat 
yourself:   
 
“I have a perfect, smooth golf swing.”   
 
You stop and think about what that means.   
 
“I have a perfect, smooth golf swing.”  
 
Then you stop!  
 
Get a real sense of what that means.   
 
Now you might have a scene come to mind.  Feel the club in your hands, 
either the leather or rubber grip whatever you have lifting the club up and 
the position is perfect.   
 
There is the ball, there is the club up there, your head turns in the right 
position, the club starts to move, you feel it moving, you hear the air 
swooshing, the green of the field.  Notice we're now putting into an 
experience the idea that you have a perfect, smooth golf swing.   
 
The “AV” Combo 
The same is true of whatever it is you choose to do.  Some people like to 
combine the ‘A’ and ‘V’ state at the same time, so now you're talking to 
yourself as you're seeing it.   
 
As you lift the golf club up, you tell yourself: “I have a perfect, smooth golf 
swing.”   
 
As you hear the whooshing noise of the club coming down, say “I have a 
perfect, smooth golf swing…”

As you hear the crack of the ball and see flying off in the distance, “I have a 
perfect, smooth golf swing.”   
 
As you follow through and finish up in your ending position, “I have a 
perfect, smooth golf swing.”   
 
You can put them side-by-side, interlace them together, one on top of the 
other and it doesn't matter in what combination you do it.  As long as you're 
in that ‘A’ and ‘V’ stage you do use some kind of combination, because 
you're covering all angles at this point and that’s the secret to visualizations.   
 
 
Track 10 – Preparation For The Hypnotic Visualization Exercise 
Time: 4m 40s 
 
 
In the next track I’m going to guide you through the CAVE cycle again, this 
time the new and improved version.  Then I’m going to leave you alone 
during the affirmation and visualization stage to activate some kind of goal.   
 
 
Master The Power Self-Hypnosis Method 
The goal that I recommend that you use is mastering the power of Self-
Hypnosis in your life.   
 
Why?   
 
Very simply, you want to augment whatever you're doing here to engrain it 
so it’s there for you whenever you call on it.   
 
You may as well use what you're learning to make what you're learning 
quicker, easier and more efficient.   
 
Example Affirmation Suggestions 
If you think in terms of what kind of affirmation suggestions can I use it 
might be something like,

“I have the power of Self-Hypnosis in my life”  
 
OR  
 
“I’m mastering the power of Self-Hypnosis method and it feels great.”   
 
Example Of The Inner Pep Talk 
If you want to give yourself an inner pep talk as well then you can do 
something along the following lines:   
 
“I’m using Self-Hypnosis every day.  I’m getting access to all those amazing 
abilities, the untapped potential that lies dormant in my unconscious mind 
and I can feel my unconscious mind responding.  
 
“I trust my unconscious mind, because it has this infinite wisdom.  It can 
make all the good things I want for my life come into my life so I trust my 
unconscious mind and I know it’s going to work.  
 
“I feel fantastic and so grateful for the power of the unconscious mind that’s 
being opened up to me. So I want to practice the Power of Self-Hypnosis 
Method every single day, five or ten minutes at a time, two or three times a 
day and engrain it, make it a natural part of what I do.   
 
“I enjoy using the power of Self-Hypnosis in my life.  I look forward to every 
opportunity I get to use the power of Self-Hypnosis in my life over and over 
again.  I know that my life is going to be transformed as a result of using the 
power of Self-Hypnosis in my life.   
 
“I’m enjoying using the Power of Self-Hypnosis Method, which means I’m 
mastering the power of Self-Hypnosis system and I get to use it for 
whatever I want whenever I want and that makes me feel simply fantastic.   
 
“I have a connection to that infinite intelligence, to the whole universe 
around me and the world opens up full of possibilities now that I have the 
power of Self-Hypnosis system ready to use and I’m mastering it now.  I can 
feel myself mastering it.  I can feel my body responding and I love it.  I 
think it’s fantastic.”   
 
Hopefully, I’ve given you a sense of where you can go with this.

Example Of A Hypnotic Goal Visualization 
Then in terms of the visualization, imagine yourself sitting somewhere 
comfortably, doing it.  It’s a classic rehearsal suggestion where you may 
want to jump forward six months or a year’s time. 
 
When you're using the power of Self-Hypnosis method every day notice your 
mental clarity, your zest for life, energy, excitement, enthusiasm, all those 
good things that have come to you as a result of using and mastering the 
Power of Self-Hypnosis Method in your own life.   
 
How To Put All The Steps Together 
Those are all the things that will happen during the ‘A’ and ‘V’ stage. 
 
 
 
This time I will set you up.  I will encourage you to go to town and practice 
all the four different styles of suggestion, moving from one to the other as 
you see fit.   
 
The Key Steps In The Power Self-Hypnosis Method 
I’m going to guide you through the big stages.   
 
1. The set up stage,  
2. The clearing your mind stage,  
3. The convincer…  
 
Where To Take Over For Yourself 
When it gets to the ‘A’ and ‘V’ part of CAVE I’m going to leave you on your 
own.  At that point, I’m going to end the recording so the recording will 
naturally stop.  However, you shouldn’t.   
 
How To End The Session For Yourself 
You carry on for as long as you need to so that when the time is up you 
count yourself out.  Tell yourself:

“At the count of five I’m going to come back refreshed, relaxed, alert simply 
fantastic.  I’m feeling peaceful, comfortable, happy and I have this amazing 
future waiting for me.   
 
1. One, coming up slowly.   
2. Two, more and more alert.   
3. Three, starting to shake your body a little bit.   
4. Four, stretch.   
5. Five open your eyes and so on.”   
 
 
Take Control Of Your Power Self-Hypnosis Method 
Basically, you're now taking more responsibility of the method.  I’m going to 
set you up and guide you into it and then let you go on your own.   
 
As soon as you’re done, do another one, maybe a three minute version, a 
quick one.   
 
Do the whole steps:  
 
1. The set up,  
2. The clearing of the mind 
3. The convincer,  
4. The ‘A’ and ‘V’ stages  
5. And then drifting at the end and  
6. Coming back out at the end all by yourself.   
 
Then when you're ready to do that, remember, a hypnotic warning:  This is 
a hypnotic process.  Don’t drive a car or operate any machinery.  If you are, 
then stop what you're doing and only move on to the next track when you're 
ready to give it your full attention.

Track 11 – Your Power Self-Hypnosis Guide 
Time: 2m 33s 
 
 
Set The Time 
Find a comfortable position to rest in and set your time limit.   
 
For the moment tell yourself that you're going to use the Power of Self-
Hypnosis Method for yourself.  You're going to take ten minutes.  At the end 
of ten minutes you’ll come back feeling refreshed, relaxed, alert simply 
fantastic. 
 
 
Emergency Response Instructions 
Tell yourself if at any point something outside needs your attention, the 
phone rings, people need you, there’s an emergency of some sort at that 
point, you will instantly open your eyes feeling refreshed, alert and ready to 
deal with whatever comes your way.   
 
 
Clear Your Mind 
As soon as you’ve done that take a deep breath.  Breathe out, relax, close 
your eyes and become aware of your right arm.  That’s it take your time.   
The Convincer (Right Arm Relaxed) 
As soon as you're aware of your right arm, with your eyes closed, simply tell 
your right arm to relax.  Right arm is relaxing and so on.   
 
Spend about a minute doing that.   
 
The “AV” Stage 
Very good.  Now it’s time for you to use your affirmations and visualizations 
to engrain the power of Self-Hypnosis into your life.  Go ahead and do that 
now.

Track 2 – How To Troubleshoot At The Unconscious Level 
Time: 2m 09s 
 
 
Welcome to day five.  If you’ve been listening to your awakening of the 
power of self-hypnosis induction every day and practicing your Power of 
Self-Hypnosis Method immediately afterwards as well, then by now your 
mind should be getting into pretty good shape.   
 
Today we’ll start looking at troubleshooting.  In other words, how do you 
overcome difficulties that can typically plague other self-hypnosis methods 
or systems and how do you overcome those?

Essentially, we’ll ask questions.  Things like, how do you know its working?  
What do you do if it doesn't work?   
 
Both answers are the same basically, you ask your unconscious and find out.   
 
How To Question The Unconscious 
Then the big question is – How?  How do you ask your unconscious?   
 
Let me introduce you to the idea of the ‘Ideodynamic Response’ and that’s 
just a big word to suggest that you can have a certain idea or thought, 
either consciously or unconsciously and it will have an affect.   
 
The Ideodynamic Response 
When you're thinking of pleasant things, you start feeling good and vice 
versa.  When your little dog is dreaming of running in a field you might see 
its legs twitching.  I don’t know if that’s the case or not, but do you see the 
point I’m trying to make?   
 
The more you think about something, the more something is on your mind 
either consciously or unconsciously, the more thoughts are leaking out in 
other ways.  We're going to start using this to create a dialogue, an 
interaction with the unconscious.   
 
Unconscious Signals 
You can train yourself to have a discussion with your unconscious in many 
different ways.   
 
Hypnotherapists like to use finger signals.  You can have an inner mentor 
figure; you can trust gut feelings and dreams are a great way of interacting 
with them – or hypnagogic imagery [Ed: the vivid images you see as you fall 
asleep at nghts]. 
 
You can use something called automatic writing and even something like the 
Ouija Board which, in its non-occult setting, is a way for the unconscious

mind to talk directly to you.  These are all methods that you could use, but 
to be honest with you they can be different stages of difficulty in using them.   
 
The Power Pendulum 
By far, the simplest, most effective method -- which you’ll learn it within 
minutes -- is what I call the power pendulum and that’s what we’ll focus on 
today. 
 
Track 3 – The Power Pendulum 
Time: 2m 41s 
 
 
Let me give you a brief history of the power pendulum so that you 
understand it in context.   
 
Some people think of the pendulum as being some kind of mystical, esoteric 
or even occult tool like dowsing for water and so on.  The pendulum did start 
this way, but it turns out that it’s nothing occult that makes it work its pure 
normal psychology.   
 
19th Century Explorers 
Back at the turn of the 19th century people on Europe got into the idea of 
dowsing in a big way.  In fact, they were dowsing for water, analyzing for 
chemicals, looking for different metals using variations on the dowsing rod, 
different rod for different things including of course, the pendulum.  This is 
where it gets interesting.   
 
Eugene Chevreul 
A French man called Michel Eugene Chevreul decided to experiment with the 
pendulum to find out what its nature is.  He looked up the main authority in 
the use of the pendulum at the time and studied with him.   
 
The First “Scientific” Double Blind Trial In History 
Chevreul is particularly interesting, because he was a true scientist.  He 
came up with the very first double blind trial.  It’s one of these trials where

no one knows what’s going on, not even the experimenter until all the data 
is in and that way people can’t cheat either consciously or unconsciously. 
 
He did a double blind trial on the pendulum to figure out whether this was 
some kind of magical tool that could tell when you had different metals in 
front of you and where water was located or whether something else was 
happening.   
 
The Power Pendulum Is Pure Psychology In Action 
Guess what?   
 
Something else was happening!   
 
It turns out that the unconscious mind was giving subtle movement of the 
hand to make the pendulum move one way or another as a signal.  When 
the person expected to find water that’s when it would move.  When the 
person knew that the metal was mercury or something else -- that’s when it 
would move. 
 
When the person didn't know or was fooled and thought that water was 
present but it wasn’t, then vice versa, then you’d get the opposite response.   
 
No Magical Properties 
This way, Eugene Chevreul proved the pendulum has no magical properties, 
no esoteric powers.  What it does is it gives an ideodynamic response. 
 
As your unconscious mind expects something to happen it gives little micro 
muscular twitches, things that are going on all the time anyway and those 
move the pendulum through the force of imagination and expectation.   
 
The Unconscious Lever 
It’s a very easy to use tool.  It is a lever that augments very small 
unconscious movements and signals.  It acts like a lever to make something 
very small turn out very big, at that point you can actually see unconscious 
responses very clearly and enter into a very simple dialogue with your 
unconscious mind.

Track 4 – How To Make Your Own Pendulum 
Time: 2m 33s 
 
 
I’d like to very quickly talk about how you can create your own pendulum.  
You're going to be using it throughout this session so you may as well know 
how to make one.   
 
Where To Buy A Pendulum 
You can go to any New Age store or go on the Internet, put in pendulum and 
you’ll find many people selling you pendulums.  You can find cheap ones for 
as little as $5 or get gold plated ones for $100 and anything in between.   
 
You don’t need to spend any money on a pendulum if you don’t want to, I’ll 
show you how to make one in a moment.  If you want to make it easy on 
yourself, just go on the Internet and buy something there.   
 
A Simple Pendant As A Power Pendulum 
The way I use a pendulum is this, I have a simple chain around my neck 
with a pendant on the end of it.  Its a little stone that’s been carved into a 
nice shape.   
 
The chain is a very fine chain, so the links are very thin.  So when I take the 
chain off and the pendant is hanging off it it’s got a perfect weighted 
pendulum for what I need.   
 
“Cheap Charlie’s” Power Pendulum 
If you want to make a very cheap version of this in fact, you want to just do 
one so you can have something right now to practice with all you need is a 
tool box and a piece of thread.   
 
Go to your sewing cupboard and pull out a length of thread.  Next go to your 
toolbox and pull out a bolt and a nut.  The nut should be roughly the size of 
a finger ring, maybe a little smaller and kind of chunky.   
 
If you don’t have a nut like that you might be able to use a finger ring, 
which is slightly weightier, a wedding ring is usually a bit too small or too

light, but something slightly weighty in terms of a ring, pendant anything 
like that will do. 
 
Essentially you want a weight, which you’ll put at the end of the thread.  
Once you have the weight attached to the thread it should be one and a half 
times to two times the size of your open palm. That’s a rough measurement.   
 
Go pull out some thread, get a nice little weight, tie it through the loop in 
the middle of bolt so you're left with one and a half to two times your palm 
length in length of thread and all you're going to do is hold it between your 
thumb and index finger so the weight is hanging down.   
 
Get Your Power Pendulum Ready – You’ll Need It! 
I’ll talk you through how to use a pendulum in a moment, but that’s basically 
all you need.  Pause this recording and before you go on to the next track, 
either get a pendulum if you have one or raid your sewing cupboard and get 
yourself a nice little weight, tie it to the end, come back and I’ll show you 
how to use it, train it to respond to you and have a dialogue with your 
unconscious mind.   
 
Track 5 – Power Pendulum Training Phase 1 
Time: 4m 59s 
 
 
This is the first training phase on using the power 
pendulum.  This training phase is getting the 
pendulum to move for you.   
 
Step 1: How To Hold The power Pendulum 
The first thing is to learn how to hold the 
pendulum.   
 
Hold It Lightly With Thumb & Index Finger  
Have a look at the illustration in your manual, 
which shows you someone holding a pendulum.   
 
You're going to hold it between your thumb and 

 
                                      The Power of Self-Hypnosis for Guaranteed 
                                                   Results Home Study Program 
  
 
© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         172
index finger and hold it as loosely as possible without the thread slipping 
through your fingers, or the pendulum falling down.   
 
Hold it as light as you can without actually losing control over it.   
 
Keep Your Elbow Floating Free 
Next, make sure that your elbow is free floating, it’s not resting on a table, 
not locked into your side, it’s floating out in space somewhere.   
 
The closer your elbow is to your body the more comfortable it can be.  The 
further out your elbow is away from your body or higher up your elbow is 
above yourself, the more pronounced the swing of the pendulum will be.   
 
So you'll find a comfortable halfway between getting a strong response and 
feeling comfort.  In time you’ll be able to do this with your elbow resting on 
the table as well, but initially we want the elbow to be free floating so you’ll 
augment the response.  This gives you a more powerful response and its 
part of the whole training phase.   
 
Hold the pendulum, have the elbow floating freely.   
 
Stay Relaxed & Loose 
Relax your shoulder and the elbow a few times, shake the wrist a little bit to 
make sure everything is nice and loose, hold it in a relaxed grip then we 
move on to phase two of the initial training phase. 
 
Step 2: Swing The Power Pendulum On Purpose 
Step two is swinging the pendulum back and forth.   
 
Swing It On Purpose 
Consciously make it swing back and forth.  Swing it one way and then the 
other way and get a good rhythm going.   
 
Make Large Swings 
Here’s a secret.  Do not make it swing a little bit -- make it swing a lot.  Big, 
huge fat swings, that’s what you want.

Remember The Feeling 
Swing it and feel how it feels in your wrist, arm and fingertips when it 
swings, the tugging of it, the motion, rhythm all of that, just feel it 
thoroughly.   
 
Step 3: Get A Genuine Unconscious Response 
Stage three is once you’ve done that, is still the pendulum.   
 
Clear Your Mind & Relax 
Clear your mind, breathe and relax.   
 
Focus On The Pendulum Moving 
I’d like for you to do two things.  Tell the pendulum to move forward and 
back.  “The pendulum is moving forward and back- forward and back.  That 
pendulum is moving forward and back.”   
 
Imagine The Pendulum Moving 
If you like, imagine the pendulum moving forward and backward.   
 
Feel your hand and imagine the pendulum moving forward and backward.  
Tell it: “Go forward and backward-forward and backward.  The pendulum is 
moving forward and backward- forward and backward.” Tell it, will it, desire 
it, feel it and know it.   
 
Keep Going! 
Keep focusing on that.  Affirm it.  Visualize it until you begin to get some 
motion.  When you get some motion tell your unconscious mind to augment 
it more, forward and backward, more intense, bigger and wider swing.   
 
Forward and backward, wider swing until you get a nice comfortable swing 
going.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         174
Get A Clear Response 
It may not be quite as extensive as when you practice it consciously and 
that’s okay.  What you're looking for a clear, unambiguous movement, a 
swinging forward and backward that’s clear and unambiguous to you.   
 
Step 4: Repeat the Process In All Directions 
When you have that you're ready to move on to the next phase.  Once you 
can make it move forward and backward, the next thing to do is to still the 
pendulum, hold it still and then do the same thing going sideways it’s the 
exact same drill.   
 
Move It On Purpose 
First you swing it side to side consciously and see how that feels.   
 
Affirm & Visualize 
Then still it again, bring it to a stop and start telling the pendulum, move 
side to side.  “The pendulum is moving side to side, left to right, side to side, 
left to right.”  See it, feel it, want it, left to right, side to side and so on.   
 
Repeat On Diagonals & Circles 
When you can make it move forward and backward at will and side to side at 
will, just because you're suggesting it and not because you're doing it 
anymore, then it’s time to move the diagonals and then to make it move in a 
circle in one direction, clockwise and then in the other direction counter 
clockwise.   
 
The Six Directions Of The Power Pendulum 
Those are the basic six directions: 
 
1. Forward and backward,  
2. Side to side,  
3. One diagonal,  
4. The other diagonal,  
5. Clockwise in a circle, and  
6. Counter clockwise in a circle.

When you can get those six swing consistently and easily just by thinking 
about them and saying now swing this way or this way then you're ready for 
phase two. 
 
It may take a little bit of time to practice it and that’s fine, but do put the 
time in and get your unconscious to respond to those things first.   
 
Then we can go on to the second training phase, which will be on the next 
Track.   
 
Track 6 – Power Pendulum Training Phase 2 
Time: 6m 04s 
 
 
Welcome to training phase two.   
 
Step 1: Getting To “Yes”!  
Once you can make the pendulum swing in all six directions without 
consciously doing it, but just by imagining it or telling the pendulum to do 
so, the next thing to do is to get a yes response.   
 
Expect A “Yes” Signal 
Very simply you’ll hold your pendulum in position and now you'll tell your 
unconscious mind, “I want you to give me a ‘yes’ signal.  Give me a signal 
for yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Give me a signal for yes.”   
 
Consciously you're focusing on the idea of yes with utter intensity while 
watching the pendulum.  
 
It could Be Any Of The Six Directions 
Focus on yes and will the pendulum to give you a movement.  You don’t 
necessary need to know, which it will be.  It will be forward and backward,

side to side, those tend to be the most common.  It could be one of the 
diagonals or a circle movement you don’t know ahead of time and that’s 
fine.   
 
Focus On The Purpose, Let Go Of The Form! 
All you want to do is focus on the idea of “yes-yes-yes, give me a signal for 
‘yes’.  Unconscious mind give me a signal for ‘yes’”, until it starts swinging in 
one direction and just augment that and thank your unconscious mind for 
having done that.   
 
Calmly Persist! 
It may take you a little while.   
 
Some people do it within 10 seconds, some 30 seconds and some as long as 
a couple of minutes to do it.  Put your time into it until you get the ‘yes’ 
response.   
 
Step 2: Get A “No” Response 
Now it’s time to move on to get another response.  Tell you're unconscious 
mind: “I want to have a different response for no.  Give me a no.  Give me a 
no.  Give me a no.”  No-no-no and you fill your mind with the idea of no.   
 
Do NOT Ask For A No, Demand One! 
Here is an important point.  Do not ask the unconscious mind can you give 
me a ‘no’ signal, because the answer will be, yes I can.  It might give you a 
yes signal in answer to the question but not the, no signal you're looking for, 
so be very precise.   
 
“I want you to give me a no signal.  Give me a no signal now.  No-no-no, 
give me the signal for ‘No’.” focus on no and get a different signal for that.   
 
Find A Different Response 
On a rare occasion the unconscious mind will give you the same signal for no 
as it did for yes.  If that happens, just have a chat with yourself just like 
you’d have a chat with a little child.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         177
Say: “No that’s not what I want I want you to give me a different signal so 
we have one signal for yes and one for no!”   
 
Let’s begin again.  Start with a ‘yes’ signal – get a ‘yes’ signal, chances are it 
will be the same one.  Then get a ‘no’ signal.  This time it will be a different 
one and make sure you do get a different one.   
 
Step 3: More Unconscious Responses 
The next stage is that you want to have different swings for the following 
kinds of answers.   
 
1. Rephrase the question please  
2. I don’t want to answer that and  
3. I don’t know,  
 
The Five Unconscious Answers 
So you’ll end up with five possible answers:  
 
1. Yes,  
2. No,  
3. Please rephrase the question,  
4. I don’t want to answer that and  
5. I don’t know.   
 
It could be forward and backward for ‘yes’, side to side for ‘no’, circling one 
way for ‘rephrase the question’, circling the other way for ‘I don’t want to 
answer’.  It might be one of the diagonals for ‘I don’t know’.   
 
Notice you still have one diagonal free and that’s just fine, but the key is 
you're taking it step-by-step getting a response for each of those five 
answers.   
 
Now you have a basic signaling system to get the unconscious mind to talk 
to you.   
 
Test Questions 
The next stage in this training phase is to test out simple questions to see 
that your unconscious mind is getting the hang of this.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         178
 
Ask Simple Questions You KNOW The Answer To 
You're going to ask your unconscious mind questions to, which you 
absolutely know the answers.   
 
For example:  
 
Is my name Greg? or Doris?   
 
Hopefully your name isn’t Greg and Doris at the same time, because that 
way you can get a yes signal and a no signal.   
 
Am I wearing a shirt?   
Am I standing here naked?   
 
Again, you want to get yes and no signals.   
 
Am I so many years old?   
Do I have this job?   
 
Types Of Questions To Ask 
Ask questions to, which you’ll get an absolutely yes or no just to get a sense 
that the unconscious mind is getting the hand of this.  Don’t use any kind of 
ambiguous questions where you wish one thing or another.   
 
Be sure to ask absolutely clear, no-brainer questions like  
 
• your name,  
• what you're wearing,  
• age,  
• profession,  
• where you live and that sort of thing.   
 
Set The Truth Compass 
Once you have warmed up the responses you want to do something very 
important and this is what I call setting the truth compass.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         179
You want the unconscious mind to recognize that this is not a game and that 
you want its answers to be true and honest.   
 
Truth Compass Question 1 
The first thing to do is get in touch with your unconscious mind and say 
something like  
 
Do I have an unconscious mind?   
 
If you get a no answer to that, that would be freaky, because your 
unconscious mind is giving you the no at that point.   
 
Just have a chat with yourself and say: “Hang on a second.  I know you're in 
there.  You made this move now.  So let’s not pretend about it.  Do I have 
an unconscious mind?”   
 
Yes, great.  
 
Truth Compass Question 2 
Will you give me the absolute truth to the answers whenever I ask them?   
 
You want to have a yes from that.   
 
Truth Compass Question 3 
Then you ask:  
 
Are you going to give me the absolute truth to the questions I ask now and 
in the future?   
 
You want to make sure the unconscious mind commits to giving you the 
truth, gives you the truth now and commits to giving you the truth in the 
future.   
 
Once Is Enough 
Once you’ve done this little set up, you don’t have to repeat it again.  Make 
sure the unconscious mind gets the hint.  You want to get truth from it, only 
truth and truth every time and it’s going to do the responding for you.

Why You Must Set The Truth Compass 
Why do you want to do that?   
 
You're setting the scene so that when you start using the power pendulum 
to question your unconscious mind and do some detective work as we’ll do 
later on in this session that you get genuine responses. 
 
You want to know that you can rely on your responses and this phase starts 
the initial training on getting truthful responses rather than wishful thinking.   
 
Thank Your Unconscious 
Once you’ve finished this training phase you want to thank your unconscious 
mind for all the effort it’s put into it and then finish the session.   
 
Once you’ve done that, get used to doing that and once you’ve done it, 
you’ve got your five answers, done your warm up questions, set your truth 
compass, you thanked your unconscious mind, ended the session and now 
you're ready for your final training phase, phase three -- which begins on 
the next Track.   
 
Track 7 – Power Pendulum Training Phase 3 
Time: 3m 37s 
 
 
Welcome back now we're on to phase three and this is the final training 
phase in the use of the power pendulum.   
 
Inoculate the Power Pendulum Against Lies 
You want to inoculate for actual truth.   
 
Wishful Thinking 
Make sure the unconscious mind tells you the truth and not what it thinks it 
wants you to know.  Sometimes we get prone to wishful thinking.  We want 
one answer.

I want it, but I don’t know if I should take it, because of all these negative 
things.  Sometimes the unconscious mind goes: “Well I guess he wants a 
yes, so I’ll give him a yes.”   
 
Make sure it gives you a genuine response.    
 
Avoid Solving The Wrong Problem! 
It’s more important when you start doing investigative work like,  
 
“Is this problem caused by Uncle Alfred telling me that I had a big nose 
when I was four years old?” 
 
If you want it to be Uncle Alfred’s fault, your unconscious mind will say 
“yes”.  At that point you will end up solving the wrong problem.   
 
You might suggest to yourself that you have a little nose, “My nose is 
beautiful and it’s great” 
 
But that’s not going to make any difference in terms of what you're trying to 
get as a result.  Your unconscious mind gave you the answer it thinks you 
wanted rather than the truth.   
 
How To Get The Real Truth Every Time! 
How do you get the real truth?  How do you prevent the unconscious mind 
from just lying to you to be nice?   
 
Set A Thought Trap For Your Unconscious Mind To Avoid 
Here’s how you do it.  The essence of it is what we did in phase two.  Do you 
know how you thought about yes, yes, yes and got a ‘yes’ response?   
 
Now you can reverse it.  You're going to ask a question to, which you know 
the answer.   
 
For example, “Is my name Alfred?“  
 
Assuming your name is Alfred, you know you're going to get a ‘yes’ 
response.

Now you think mentally “No-no-no my name is not Alfred; no-no-no”  
 
And you watch what the pendulum does.   
 
Teach The Unconscious How To Answer True 
If the pendulum says ‘no’, the unconscious mind is giving you what you are 
thinking about rather than a true answer to the question.   
 
At this point, you have a chat with your unconscious and say: 
 
“Hang on unconscious don’t give me what I’m thinking about, don’t give me 
what I want, give me the absolute truth.”   
 
Repeat Until Success Is Normal 
Do it again until you can think of a no, but get a ‘yes’ response.   
 
Reset The Power Pendulum Each Time You Start A New Session 
Incidentally, I should mention that whenever you start using the pendulum 
for any new session, you get the five answers:  
 
• Yes,  
• No,  
• Rephrase,  
• Don’t want to answer,  
• I don’t know,  
 
You want to reset those.   
 
Although they tend to be similar each time, it won’t always be the case.  
Sometimes the unconscious mind will choose different directions to answer 
questions in a different way.   
 
Start each session by setting those five patterns ahead of time.

Reset The Answers Before Testing For Truth 
Now that you're into training phase three, you start by setting those five 
answers.  Then ask a question to, which the answer is absolutely yes, like is 
my name Alfred and you think no-no-no-no.   
 
If it gives you a ‘yes’ response while you're thinking no, you're doing great.  
It if gives you a ‘no’ response, then you need to have a little chat with your 
unconscious and say “Don’t do this.  I want the real answer!”   
 
Go to the point where you can ask yourself a couple of questions, maybe 
three or four in a row to, which the answer is ‘yes’, but you can think no and 
vice versa.  Questions to, which you know the answer is ‘no’, but you think 
yes.  You're not just getting the same response each time you're getting the 
absolute truth.   
 
Then you mix them in.  You think no questions and get ‘yes’, think yes and 
get ‘no’, and make sure you get the correct response each time.  When you 
get this consistently, congratulations you're ready to use the power 
pendulum as an immensely powerful tool for personal change.   
 
Until then, practice.  Using the power pendulum is a vital phase in your 
training. 
 
Track 8 – Discover The Unconscious Review 
Time: 15m 58s 
 
 
Now that you have the power pendulum working and responding to you, I’d 
like to introduce you to the Unconscious Review.   
 
Get To The Root Of The Problem 
The Unconscious Review is a way of using the power pendulum that will tap 
your unconscious mind and navigate through the hallways of your memories 
to find the roots to problems and releases to things.   
 
Essentially, if you have a dirty goal  -- in other words conflict between the 
conscious or unconscious -- it allows you to find out the actual problem and 
how to resolve it.

There are a couple of things you should know about the review process in 
terms of your overall knowledge and strategies.  On the next track I’ll take 
you through a step-by-step questioning system you can follow to help you 
with this.  I want you to get used to the idea of the Unconscious Review 
first.   
 
Important Insight 1: Unconscious Reviews Are 100% Safe! 
First of all, the primary reason for doing an Unconscious Review is like a 
hypnotherapist doing a regression on you.   
 
This is a controlled regression.  It takes you backwards in time to previous 
events to find out where things start and how to fix them.  The thing to 
realize is, when you're using the power pendulum it’s totally safe, because 
your unconscious mind still has its regular defense mechanisms going for it.   
 
Allow The Unconscious To Set The Pace 
Sometimes your progress will be quite slow and that’s okay.  It’s your 
unconscious mind putting your defense mechanism up to partly put you off 
or partly slowing you down so by the time you get to the material you're 
looking for, you're ready to handle it.   
 
Important Insight 2: Unconscious Defense Mechanisms 
The strategies the unconscious mind uses to slow you down or put you off 
are things like making you feel as if you're uneasy while thinking about it.  
Making you feel hazy in your mind so you can’t think of good questions to 
ask.  Making you feel like I don’t want to do this, getting a sense of going 
nowhere and blocking questions and things like that.   
 
Important Insight 3: Persist! 
These are all natural mechanisms the mind uses.  Recognize them as natural 
defenses as proof that you're on the right track and persist.  When you're 
using the power pendulum you can’t go wrong, because you're going at your 
own pace.  There is no one pushing you or doing things to you.   
 
You're always in an interaction with your unconscious mind and your 
unconscious will only reveal material at the right breaking pace for you.

Important Insight 4: Insight – v – Catharsis  
This takes us to a very important idea.  What is it you're trying to achieve 
when you're finding this material?   
 
Two essential things:  
 
1. Insight   
2. Catharsis   
 
What Is An Insight? 
Insight basically means you get a sense of “Oh, I get it.  I know how it 
started and now I know how to fix it.”   
 
What Is Catharsis? 
Catharsis is when it just gets fixed, when you have a spontaneous release.  
You think of a situation and go, “Oh my! It’s because Uncle Alfred told me I 
had a big nose and as I think about it it’s not that big a deal anymore.”   
 
Therefore, you actually had the emotional release where as in the past when 
you thought about Uncle Alfred you might have still been upset about it with 
him.   
 
Important Insight 5: Catharsis Does NOT Automatically Follow Insight! 
Here’s something important for you to realize.  In the early days of 
psychology, people used to think, and this is Freud’s fault, that insight lead 
to catharsis.   
 
In other words, just by the fact that you recover material or have an insight 
into something, you automatically have catharsis and your life will be better.  
This is not the case. 
 
Catharsis can often follow insight and sometimes follow it hand in hand and 
that’s great.  Sometimes you have catharsis first and once the emotion is 
released the unconscious says, “Oh by the way, you may as well remember 
the memory now, because it’s safe now and that’s fine too."

Important Insight 6: Insight Is All You Need For Power Self-Hypnosis 
If you happen to have spontaneous catharsis, fantastic then you’ve resolved 
the problem without technically doing self-hypnosis.   
 
However, I’d like for you to realize that you don’t have to get catharsis 
straight away.  It’s enough to get insight, know what the problem is, 
because now you can use the CAVE cycle to overcome the problem.    
 
How To Use Insights With The Power Self-Hypnosis Method 
Let’s imagine that you have self-confidence issues and you have to do 
presentations, maybe go to lots of interviews to get a job and you're shy 
about it and don’t know what to do.  You might try saying things like  
 
I’m confident and I’ll do great in this interview.   
I’m confident and I’m a great interview candidate.   
 
What If Regular Suggestions Fail? 
You might try that for a while and realize something is not working, for some 
reason that suggestion isn’t working for you, so out comes the power 
pendulum.   
 
You do a series of questions.  It may take you a couple of hours, couple of 
days or minutes, you don’t know.    
 
Step 1: Find The Root 
What comes out is the that root of this was something you heard.  Uncle 
Alfred, when you were five years old, told you what a big, ugly nose you 
had.  You cried like a baby, because you were and ever since then you’ve 
had self-esteem issues.  Your unconscious still thinks your nose is ugly.   
 
Step 2: Fix The Root Of The Problem Not The Surface 
At that point you know how to solve it.  Before you go down to the 
interviews you spend 21 days cycling through the idea that you have a 
perfectly normal nose, your nose is just fine.   
 
My nose is just fine the way it is.

If you want to go for it you might even say:  
 
I love my nose.  I love the way it looks it’s just fine.   
 
Fix The Negative Blueprint At The Root 
This is counteracting that initial negative suggestion put into your mind by 
Uncle Alfred.  So when you have insight you have the key to resolving initial 
conditions.  You can even say:  
 
Uncle Alfred was wrong my nose is beautiful.  Uncle Alfred was wrong my 
nose is beautiful.   
 
You can go directly for it, indirectly for it, you can fix the harm any way you 
want.  Once you have insight you know what to fix.  Now you're fixing the 
correct problem, which in this case is the nose issue rather than the problem 
you think you have, which is the interview thing.   
 
Fixing The Root May Automatically Fix The Surface Too 
Once you fix the nose thing chances are you’ll have no problems with 
interviews anyway.   
 
If you do [still have problems with interviews], then the interview 
suggestions will start working, because now you’ve cleared out of the way 
the underlying contradiction, the conflict the thing that created the dirty goal 
was the unconscious mind going  
 
I can’t show my face in public, because I have a big ugly nose.   
 
At the same time your conscious mind is going,  
 
But I want this job.  I’ve got to go for the interview.   
 
Instead of having that conflict and the conscious mind saying “Okay we're 
going to be confident in this interview, cool, calm and collected” and the 
unconscious mind saying, “But they’ll see my nose!  How can I be this way?”   
 
If the suggestion isn’t working it’s, because the unconscious mind is going, 
“No this nose thing is still a problem!”

You resolve the nose thing and suddenly the conflict disappears.  A regular 
set of suggestions at that point will resolve the interview thing or you may 
not even need it, because it happens spontaneously.   
 
The Power Pendulum Takes You To The Root 
Use the power pendulum to get inside.  If it happens to be resolved with 
catharsis, thinking about your Uncle Alfred and realizing how ridiculous it 
was what he said and how your nose is beautiful now especially that you’ve 
had plastic surgery, say  
 
I haven’t got a problem with this.  My nose is great.   
 
Think about the interview and go  
 
They’ll see my nose and see how great it is.  I’m bound to get this job.   
 
If catharsis follows fantastic if it doesn't, use the power of self-hypnosis to 
lead to catharsis to fix the original problem, the real problem and then let 
nature take care of itself.   
 
Get The Unconscious Mind On YOUR Side! 
The next thing to realize about the unconscious review is that you want to 
get the unconscious mind on your side and work with you.   
 
Sometimes when we have what we consider to be a problem, and the 
unconscious mind has no idea it’s a problem.  It thinks it’s actually doing a 
pretty good job.  Let’s go back to the idea of the interview.   
 
If you said to your unconscious mind, “I want to fix this interview thing” -- 
the unconscious mind is says, “Wait, I don’t see a problem with this I’m 
pretty happy this way.  I get to sit at home, watch TV, eat potato chips, who 
needs a job?”   
 
At that point, you need to tell your unconscious mind  
 
“Hang on this is a problem. I want to grow as a human being and have 
these good things in my life and this thing is holding me back.  Do you 
realize that?”

The unconscious mind goes – No.  
 
Then you may need some suggestions at that point to say  
 
My unconscious mind is realizing this is very important to me and it’s time to 
change.     
 
So you're putting a new program in the blueprint that says:  
 
Unconscious mind you'll have to acknowledge that it’s important to me and 
it’s time to change.   
 
At that point the unconscious mind goes, “Okay. That’s important to him.  
It’s time to change.” 
 
Now, you can go back and say: 
 
Let’s change it.   
 
The unconscious mind goes, “All right then.”   
 
Why?  
 
Because now it has a reason to change it, because it understands that it’s 
important.  Sometimes it’s enough to ask if he realizes it, and if he goes 
“No” telling it “Well it’s important!”   
 
Then the unconscious mind goes,  
 
“Okay got it!  Okay boss, ready to roll!”  
 
And that might be enough.  If it isn’t, use the power of suggestion to make 
the unconscious mind realize it.   
 
You Always Have An Option To Troubleshoot A Problem 
If you're still stuck, go right back to the insight process to find out why 
you're stuck.  You might come up with an Uncle Alfred thing again.  This way 
you always have options on where to go.

Option 1: Check The Unconscious Acknowledges The Problem 
First it might be the unconscious mind doesn't realize there is a problem and 
it’s protecting you with the ugly nose by not letting you go outside.  You 
need to tell it “I’ve got a problem.”   
 
It goes, “I don’t believe you.  I’d rather stay indoors.”   
 
Now you use suggestion to correct it to say, “I do want to resolve this!”  
 
Option 2: Regular Suggestions To Get Unconscious Acknowledgement 
And it goes, “Okay, that nose thing is still a problem, but you don’t know 
about this yet.”   
 
Then you try the regular interview suggestion.  
 
Option 3: Unconscious Review – Find The Root 
Lets say that doesn't quite work out so you go back to the drawing board 
and say  
 
“Where did this whole thing start?”   
 
You find out about Uncle Alfred, fix that, at which point you have a beautiful 
dainty nose and the world becomes your oyster again.   
 
The Power Self-Hypnosis Method Is Very Strategic 
Notice how you’re now applying your power of self-hypnosis in a very 
strategic manner?   
 
I can’t emphasize enough how important this is.  If you just go to regular 
self-hypnosis programs, most people just teach you the bits where you go 
into trance to affirm something and come back out feeling great.  For 78% 
of the problems you’ll face that’s just fine, it’s more than enough.   
 
How To Guarantee Results 
What I’m interested in is creating a system that’s totally rigorous, 
professional and will work for you every time provided you work the system.

This is the beauty of the power pendulum.  The power pendulum allows you 
to strategically troubleshoot any problems that you have.   
 
You won’t necessarily begin with a power pendulum, but you will end with it 
if your regular ways of approaching things aren’t working out.  Now you 
have a terrific amount of choice.   
 
Insider Tips For Other Uses Of The Power Pendulum 
 
Insider Tip 1: Check The Unconscious Likes Your Suggestions 
Another couple of things you can do with a power pendulum, and this is 
something as I said, a routine, is you may want to check with the 
unconscious mind if it likes the suggestions you're going to give it so that 
you get the unconscious mind’s approval before you begin.   
 
For example, let’s say you're going to use the power of self-hypnosis to 
make yourself a master of self-hypnosis.  You check with the unconscious 
mind  
 
“Do you realize that I want to be a master of self-hypnosis?”   
 
The unconscious mind goes “Yes!”… Great!! 
 
“Now, unconscious mind I’m going to use a suggestion,  
 
“I am mastering the power of self-hypnosis in my life”  
 
OR 
 
“I’m mastering the power of self-hypnosis to be a force for good in my life 
whatever you choose.”   
 
Then you say to the unconscious mind,  
 
“I’m going to use this affirmation suggestion.  Is this an affirmation 
suggestion, which will get me what I want to have?”   
 
The unconscious mind goes “No.”

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         192
“Should I change it to:  
 
“I love the power of self-hypnosis?”   
 
It goes “Yes.”   
 
Insider Tip 2: Get An Unconscious Commitment 
“If I suggest I love the power of self-hypnosis, will you give me what I want?  
Will you make me a master of self-hypnosis?”   
 
“Sure.”   
 
Now you’ve played a little trick with the unconscious.  You’ve made it 
assume responsibility for the outcome.  It’s agreed to get the job done.  If 
it’s agreed, it will have to be consistent with it.  It doesn't guarantee results, 
but it stacks the odds in your favor again.   
 
You can test the suggestions before you spend 21 days trying them out, test 
them out ahead of time saying, 
 
“Hey unconscious do you like this?”   
 
I did this myself when I had a tele-seminar to teach and I was getting ill.  I 
could barely speak so I sat down with the power pendulum.  I wrote down a 
list of questions.  I’ll show you how to do that on the next track.   
 
Basically got the idea of “Why am I ill right now and how can I resolve it?”   
 
It turns out that I had this idea somewhere inside me.  A friend said to me 
years ago that in order to make massive personal changes you go through a 
phase of being ill.   
 
It’s not the case, but I had this idea inside my mind and because I’d been 
using self-hypnosis a lot to make a lot of changes in my life, my unconscious 
mind said, “Okay, I guess it’s time to be ill.”   
 
As soon as I realized this I said,  
 
“I don’t need to be this way anymore so I need to have this call tomorrow.

“It’s very important that I do and do you understand that?”   
 
“Yes.”   
 
“What suggestions should I say to make that happen?”   
 
And I can’t remember exactly what I said, but something like  
 
“I can make healthy personal changes and stay healthy all the time,” 
 
something along those lines.   
 
It didn't like the first or second formulation, but it liked the third one  
 
“Yes, I like that one I’ll go with that.”   
 
I asked how often I should do it and it said,  
 
“Well, seeing how it’s tomorrow, I want you to do three sessions of 21 
repetitions.”   
 
I did three sessions of 21 repetitions, done.  I went to sleep.   
 
The next morning in woke up and while I wasn’t perfectly healthy, my voice 
was more than good enough to do the seminar and no one knew the 
difference.  By the end of the day by the way, I was perfectly healthy again 
so it just took a little time for the whole thing to clear.   
 
So notice how the power pendulum has so many options, gives you so many 
choices.  It’s a very important tool and one of the reasons we spend so 
much time teaching you how to master the power pendulum to make it work 
for you rather than works sometimes and kind of doesn't work at other 
times.   
 
Keep A Record Of Your Questions 
The final thing I want to talk about in terms of the unconscious review is 
keep a list of questions.

Prepare Questions Ahead Of Time 
When you're about to use the pendulum it’s a good practice to sit down 
ahead of time and think of about 10-20 different questions you want to ask.   
 
Remember, you're playing detective here so it’s like playing 20 questions.  
You're going to get yes/no responses, so you have to get very good at 
teasing out the right kind of questions to get at the kind of answer that you 
want.   
 
Learn From Past Questions 
I’ll show you how to do that on the next session.  For the moment though, 
the important thing to realize is to keep a record of those questions and the 
answers you get.  It not only makes fascinating reading it teaches you about 
your own mind.   
 
 When you review those records over time you’ll notice, first of all, that 
you're succeeding at stuff, which is good.   
 
 Secondly, you’ll notice patterns in the way your unconscious thinks, 
which will help you ask better questions later on. 
 
Summary Of The Unconscious Review 
Let’s recap quickly on what we learned on the unconscious review stage.   
 
1. Get Insight Safely 
First of all, you can use the power pendulum to gain insight and sometime 
seven spontaneous catharsis from a problem.   
 
The insight is like a hypnotherapist regressing you only it’s safe, because 
you're going at the rate and speed that your unconscious mind knows you 
can handle.   
 
2. Get Acknowledgement And Permission 
Secondly, you're going to get recognition and permission from your 
unconscious mind to work on the problem.

If it says you're not ready to work on this problem just yet, get a time scale.   
 
Can I start in 10 minutes? 
 
An hour? 
 
Two hours?  
 
OR 
 
Tomorrow?   
 
Make sure the time scale is pretty soon so you get to do what you want.  
Give your unconscious mind a little time to set up the scene, recognize 
there’s a problem then if you need to you can go back to the insight thing 
and find out what’s going on.   
 
3. Check Your Suggestions & Get Unconscious Commitment 
Finally, test your suggestions out beforehand.  
 
Get your unconscious mind to respond and commit to responding to the 
various suggestions that you’ll be using ahead of time.  That way you have 
all the balls in your court and you're ready to rock and roll.   
 
As soon as you're ready to learn a very simple questioning strategy, move 
on to the next Track.   
 
 
Track 9 – Your Step By Step Questioning Strategy Revealed 
Time: 19m 21s 
 
 
Now we're going to go through a step-by-step questioning strategy that you 
can follow as part of your way of getting insight, getting to the root of the 
problem.   
 
Step 1: Calibrate The Power Pendulum 
The first thing to do is get your five answers:

1. Yes 
2. No  
3. Don’t know  
4. Don’t want to answer 
5. Rephrase the question.   
 
Get those five each time you start a new session, because sometimes they 
change and you want to know ahead of time what your unconscious mind 
wants to tell you. 
 
Step 2: Warm Up The Power Pendulum With Questions 
The next thing to do is to warm up or prime the pump.   
 
Get the unconscious mind ready to respond.  Ask some no-brainer 
questions; get some yes and no signals.  If you want to test yourself, get it 
to answer ‘yes’, to a yes question whilst you're thinking no and so on just to 
make sure the unconscious mind is giving you general responses.  This sets 
the scene and gets you warmed up for everything.   
 
Step 3: Get Acknowledgement 
The next stage is the first part of the troubleshooting process.   
 
You're going to ask the unconscious mind if it recognizes that this situation 
is a problem.  As we mentioned before, the unconscious mind doesn't always 
know that the thing you want to work on that you consider to be a problem 
is actually a problem.   
 
It might like it, because it keeps you safe, out of trouble, fulfills some other 
function the unconscious mind is trying to do for you.  The very first thing to 
do is make sure it recognizes that it is a problem.  If the unconscious mind 
does not recognize your problem then you have two options.   
 
Step 3(A): Talk To Your Unconscious 
The first is a very quick chat to yourself. 
 
Say

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         197
“Unconscious this is important to me you need to change this for these 
reasons so I want you to recognize that this is a problem for me now.” 
 
Ask it again,  
 
“Do you recognize it?”   
 
It might say “yes”, at, which point you're ready to rock and roll.   
 
Step 3(B): Use Suggestion To Get Unconscious Acknowledgement  
If it still says no, then now you use the power of self-hypnosis method to get 
the unconscious mind to recognize that you have a problem.   
 
So you stop the procedure there.   
 
Spend a couple of days getting the unconscious mind primed, telling it  
 
“Situation (X) is a problem for me and the unconscious mind is recognizing 
that now it’s time for a change.”   
 
Do that for a few days and check in again.  Do it for a few more days and 
check in again.  You don’t necessarily have to go for the full 21-day cycle, 
you may need to, but you want to check in every few days to see if the 
unconscious mind has the hint yet.   
 
All you want to do is get enough leeway to do the work you need to do and 
then carry on doing the real work.  Do that and test every few days until the 
unconscious mind realizes this is a problem and acknowledges that it’s time 
for a change.   
 
Important Principle 1: Behavior – v - Intention 
The next two stages are more strategies, ideas to keep in the back of your 
mind than actual questioning processes you go through.   
 
The first thing is what I call behavior versus intention this is a very 
important point.   
 

 
                                      The Power of Self-Hypnosis for Guaranteed

Every Behavior Is Motivated By A Positive Intention 
Every behavior that you have is motivated by some kind of positive force or 
intention even though you may not realize it at first.  Even messed up 
behaviors have a positive intention -- to maybe protect the person, keep 
them healthier, happier, whatever.   
 
Example Of The Positive Intention Behind A Negative Behavior 
For example, think of some grumpy old fogey who is miserable and shouts 
at everyone that tries to speak to him.  Everyone might think that is very 
bad behavior and it can’t possibly be a positive intention.  The intention has 
to be mean and nasty and mean and nasty to the rest of the world.   
 
Why would he want to be mean and nasty?   
 
People aren’t irrational.  Why would his unconscious mind cause him to be 
this way?  How about he had some bad experiences growing up?   
 
He learned to cope by attacking first, so rather than trusting the kids in his 
school then being teased for it, he learned to be grumpy and nasty to them 
to push them away before they had a chance to be mean and nasty to him 
or push him away.  So that grew into a bigger pattern as he went through 
life and now just knows how to be grumpy.   
 
It’s all he knows, but his unconscious mind is trying to protect him from the 
nasty kids even though he doesn't need that anymore.  This is a very 
important thing to realize, because when you understand what the intention 
of the behavior is you can start programming your unconscious mind, you 
rewrite the blueprint so that you get the intention in a better way.  
 
If you want to be safe, not having people call you nasty names and so on, 
what better way to do it than to be this very pleasant charismatic person?  
When someone does become nasty to you, you have this over abundance of 
happy emotions that is water off a duck’s back.   
 
Isn’t that a much better way to protect you from nasty comments and nasty 
people?

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         199
So you have your friends to rely on to pep you up and you have this deep 
inner sense of self-esteem and trust so you don’t need to be grumpy to 
people anymore.   
 
At that point, the intention is satisfied, the unconscious mind is happy and 
going, “Oh, I like that idea I’ll run with that and now!”… it no longer needs 
the behavior, in other words, being grumpy. 
 
The Key Ingredient To Change 
This is a key ingredient particular to changing habits, nail biting, going to the 
gym, overeating and so on.  You need to understand what the purpose of 
the behavior is.  Is eating because you like the taste of food – are you just a 
Bon Viveur. 
 
Are you eating a lot, because eating means love to you and when you're 
upset you eat more food so you can feel good about yourself?   
 
Are you eating, because your unconscious mind is trying to protect you from 
sexual advances from other people?   
 
What is the intention?   
 
Is it protection from advances, is it to make you feel good when you're down 
in the dumps, is it just because you enjoy eating good food what is the 
intention of it?   
 
Negotiate A Better Deal! 
Once you get the intention you can have a chat to your unconscious mind 
and negotiate a better plan.   
 
Example Negotiation 1 
For example, you love eating good food, because you enjoy good food.  How 
about, you enjoy a thoroughly good meal once a week and the rest of the 
week you behave well and eat the kind of stuff you should be eating?   
 
More importantly, because the unconscious mind can have any experience it 
can cause you to love eating salads and healthy foods as much as you used 
to enjoy eating all of the other kinds of foods.  Now you have balance.  You

get to have a big meal and have a lavish mean and enjoy that and the rest 
of the week or month you get to be just as enthusiastic about foods that are 
healthy for you.   
 
Now you have the power of self-hypnosis working for you and you're 
working hand in hand with your unconscious mind.  This helps you to 
troubleshoot all kinds of problems.   
 
Example Negotiation 2 
Let’s turn to another idea.  Let’s say you were overeating, because eating 
picks you up and makes you feel love when you feel down in the dumps.  
Let’s say you use the power pendulum and find out that when you were a 
kid your mom used to make you a meal, kiss you on the head and say eat it 
all up and mommy will love you.   
 
So eating everything up on the plate is a way of getting mother’s approval.  
If you eat a ton of ice cream it’s like every little spoonful is a spoonful of 
love.  As soon as you realize that you know what the solution is.  You can 
correct your thinking by saying  
 
“Hey, food isn’t love; love comes from the inside.   
 
“Every time I need love, I can just think of my friends, family and all of 
these happy memories that I have.  I can be inundated with as many of 
those as you want.”   
 
You'll be as obsessive and compulsive about thinking happy thoughts, 
recalling wonderful experiences, talking to your friends and having a great 
time as you used to be about pulling five gallon boxes of ice cream out of 
the fridge and stuffing yourself with them.   
 
Why?   
 
Because you're giving way to the intention again, the intention is to pick you 
up, to make you feel good when you're down in the dumps.   
 
Example Negotiation 3 
Let’s look at the final possibility, the idea of eating to be fat as a sense of 
protection.  It’s a good thing to be protected and there are many different 

 
                                      The Power of Self-Hypnosis for Guaranteed

ways you can be protected.  There’s nothing wrong with you being sexually 
attractive and still being protected. 
 
 
 
For example, you can learn to be affirmative and assertive so when people 
do make some advance to you, you can say thank you very much for the 
offer, but I’m not interested and then walk away.   
 
Perhaps at that point the solution is to work on self-esteem first, work on 
being more assertive next and when you have self-esteem or are more 
assertive, you don’t need the fat anymore as protection because you have 
much stronger protection, the protection that comes from deep inside you.   
 
 
In fact, you might even use that as your set of suggestions.   
 
“I don’t need to be fat when I have my unconscious mind to protect me.  I 
can feel good and assertive at any point in time.  I can be so strong, 
because now I have the unlimited power of the unconscious mind on my 
side.”   
 
The Problem IS The Solution 
Do you see how the power pendulum allows you to accurately pinpoint the 
real cause of the problem?  Immediately it suggests the real solution.   
 
Rather than you standing there and creating a superficial solution like I’m 
going to eat healthy and love eating healthy, which might work for most 
people, but if it doesn't work you’ll know how to troubleshoot it, find out 
what the real cause is, what’s slowed you down and stopping or preventing 
you and you get to fix that.   
 
Important Principle 2: Goal Behavior – v – Goal Conditions 
The next thing and this is something you want to check in terms of your 
questioning process, is to find out why you're doing certain things.   
 
The intention behind the behavior is one thing, but the other thing is also do 
you have a behavior or a condition?

Two Reasons For Overeating 
Let’s look at the behavior of overeating.  You might think overeating is a 
problem and in our example it could be one of two things.   
 
It could be a behavior problem, because the unconscious mind just got used 
to eating and likes it.  Maybe it likes the taste of food or something like that. 
Or it could be because it wants the condition that eating a lot does.  Eating 
becomes a way of supporting a condition of being fat.   
 
When you look at it in terms of behavior and condition, and look at it in 
terms of behavior and intention, it starts allowing you to figure out what’s 
going on so you can solve the actual problem.   
 
Interim Summary 
Let’s have a quick summary of where we are so far.   
 
Step 1: Calibrate The Power Pendulum 
You're going to start off by resetting the five answers to the questions 
 
1. Yes 
2. No  
3. Don’t know  
4. Don’t want to answer 
5. Rephrase the question.   
 
Step 2: Warm Up the Power Pendulum With Questions 
You’ll do a warm up process; ask a couple of yes/no questions so you get 
the unconscious mind used to answering you.   
 
Step 3: Get Acknowledgement 
Now we have the recognition that you're having some kind of problem and 
this situation you're facing is a problem in your life.

Important Principles: Intentions, Behaviors & Conditions 
Next, you’re strategic thing in the back of your mind is asking “What’s the 
intention behind these behaviors, behind this problem, and is the behavior 
the problem or is the condition this behavior creates the problem? What am 
I fixing here?” 
 
Step 4: Get Permission To Explore The Problem 
The next thing you want to do is get permission from the unconscious mind 
to do some exploration.  This is an important stage.  Remember, you're 
unconscious is there to protect you.  One of the ways it does that is by 
creating amnesia -- “I need to forget your memories, certain memories that 
aren’t pleasant to remember so you get protected from them.”   
 
Give The Unconscious Mind Time 
If you're about to start delving into it you need to tell your unconscious 
mind, “we're about to take a joy ride down this lane is that okay with you?”   
 
If you surprise your unconscious mind with your request it might go, “I’m 
not ready with this yet.  I haven’t got a plan of action on how to protect you 
whilst you're doing what you want to do so the answer is no.”   
 
At that point you say  
 
How much time do you need to be ready?   
 
Ten minutes?  No.   
 
One hour?  Okay, an hour.   
 
In that hour’s time your unconscious mind does whatever it needs to do in 
order to organize that memory in a way that you can deal with it safely.   
 
Come back And Check That You’re Good To Go 
When the hour is up you come back again, restart the whole power 
pendulum process by setting the five questions, doing a couple of yes no 
questions, getting to recognize the problem, these are all set up things,

getting permission, saying the hour is up.  Are you ready for it now?  Sure, 
great let’s dive in now.   
 
 
Again, you're making sure the unconscious mind is on your side, you're not 
fighting it or resisting a natural process, you're making it work for you.  As a 
rule you should get permission to do what you want to do within a few 
minutes and the latest in a couple of days.   
 
Troubleshooting Continuous Refusals 
If your unconscious mind is saying NO – after a couple of days then you 
might want to give it a good talking to.  Say, 
 
“Hang on a second this is very important to me and I need to deal with this.”   
 
Maybe ask it,  
 
“Is something else going on that I need to deal with first before I’m ready to 
deal with this?”   
 
Then you go through the whole question process then to find out what that 
other thing is first.   
 
Check For Other Issues 
In other words, you go through some support mechanism before you're 
ready to deal with the real issue that you're looking at.   
 
For example, let’s use something we’ve been talking about already.  Let’s 
assume someone is overweight and the unconscious mind wants the person 
to be fat as a way of protecting them from unpleasant events.   
 
Let’s say this person was sexually abused as a child in a mild sort of way and 
that’s caused the whole pattern to go on.  The unconscious mind wants to 
protect that and might say hang on this person is not strong enough to deal 
with the fact that this happened to them.   
 
“I’ve protected them and made them forget about it so they can get on with 
their life they’re not ready to handle this yet.”   
 
Before it will release that memory it’s going to say to you

“Well, you're going to have to be a different person before I’m ready to 
release that memory.”   
 
Then you go through the question process.  Say  
 
“Okay, what’s going on what do I need to do first?”   
 
Then somehow the idea comes up to you that I have to be more assertive so 
I can deal with more difficulty in life and a little bit more level headedly.   
 
Then you go through the process, go back to being strong as a child.  Make 
some suggestions about being assertive, strong and healthy and that sort of 
stuff.  Your 21 days are up.  You're feeling more assertive, healthier than 
before, stronger, you can take criticism, go through tough times and be okay 
with it. 
 
Now your unconscious mind goes  
 
“Okay, this person is ready now.  They are ready to handle what happened 
back then so they can clean that stuff up.”   
 
You Can Seek Professional Help With Larger Issues 
By the way, notice that we're going into some pretty heavy territory.  I 
happen to think that you can deal with most things with self-hypnosis and I 
also recognize that this is a very valuable place for having experts in fields in 
other words, therapists, hypnotherapists and so on, help you along the way.   
 
The role of a therapist is to help you create solutions more quickly and 
easily.  I, of course, as a hypnotherapist, am particularly partial to the idea 
of hypnotherapy I think it works very quickly; it’s very effective and efficient 
and gets great results for people.   
 
Just because you have thousand power of self-hypnosis at your fingertips, it 
doesn't necessarily mean that from time to time you may not want one to 
one go to a specialist for help.   
 
Sometimes you get stuck and say

“Hang on a second I’m not getting this whole assertiveness thing going for 
me.   
 
“Maybe I’ll go to some assertiveness training, get some valuable experiences 
from that, use that as my foundation, put some suggestions around that and 
that’s how I’ll grow and learn.”   
 
Listen To Your Hunches 
Remember, your unconscious mind finds solutions in many different ways 
and maybe as you're giving yourself the assertiveness suggestions, you 
might say, an assertiveness course might be the quickest way to getting 
where it wants to be.   
 
Whilst you're sitting there thinking all I’ve got to do is say these 
suggestions, your unconscious mind has other plans.   
 
If it spots the same article on assertiveness training over and over again 
over the course of a couple of days and you see assertiveness trainings all 
over the place, this could be a hint that the unconscious mind is giving you 
saying Take this route this will get you there more quickly.  
 
So go,  
 
Okay.  I guess my unconscious mind is giving me a hint here and do it.   
 
You go to the training and inside of days you have the kind of success and 
advancements that might have taken you months of even years of work on 
your own to get.   
 
Please bear in mind this tool is just that, a tool.  Keep it in context.  Your 
unconscious mind knows many different ways to resolve things so listen to 
it.  If you’ve got a hunch to do one thing, do it.  If you have a hunch to go 
somewhere else, do it.   
 
If you start looking in the yellow pages and constantly come back to the 
same hypnotherapist over and over again, if you're getting curious about it 
and that sort of thing that could be a hint from your unconscious mind to 
give it a go – so give it a go.

That might be exactly what you need to do for the next phase in your 
development.  So recognize that the power of self-hypnosis gives you 
solutions in many different ways.  It may not be in the ways that you expect 
but be open to it, because that’s part of the process.   
 
The Five Magic Questions 
Let’s assume now that you have permission to make the change.  Now 
you're ready to play detective.  You're going to do this by playing 20 
questions.   
 
The key questions to think about are:  
 
1. Who,  
2. When,  
3. Where,  
4. What and  
5. How  
 
The How Question 
How did it happen?   
 
In other words, do you have some imprint did someone say something to 
you?   
 
• Is it something you heard?   
• Is it a belief you’ve got, a feeling you have?   
• When did it happen?   
• Where did it happen?   
• Who was around you?   
• What was the context?   
• What actually occurred?   
 
The order of that I like to go through how is,  
 
Is it an imprint, something that happened to you that made you believe 
something or is it a feeling, which is pulling you back -- like shame, guilt or 
fear?

The 4 ‘W’ Questions 
Once you’ve got the how you can find out where did that how begin?  When 
was it?   
 
You can find a way of going back in time.  Ask, was it in the last 10, 50, 30 
years and so on?  When you find the time you can start guessing around the 
time.   
 
Okay, it was when I was give years old.   
 
Was it the birthday party?  No.   
 
Was it this event?  No.   
 
Did it have something to do with Uncle Alfred?  Yes.   
 
Was it when Uncle Alfred said you’ve got a big nose?  Yes.   
 
Check For Spontaneous Catharsis 
Bingo, you’ve just hit the event now you have the insight.  Now you can ask 
your unconscious mind,  
 
Okay, given that I know what it is now and I realize that my nose is the 
same as everyone else’s -- it’s perfectly fine -- is this a problem for me now 
that I’ve realized this or have we released that? 
 
The way to ask that is;  
 
Is this still a problem for me?  
 
And the answer goes NO.   
 
Have I released it?  Yes.   
 
Can I now move on with my life and know that my nose is perfectly fine?  
Yes.

Great you're done and nothing else needs to be done.  The uncovering 
process has created catharsis.  The memory has been released and you're 
ready to roll.   
 
If, on the other hand, you say, now that I’ve got this memory and there is 
insight,  
 
Am I done with this whole nose thing now?  No.   
 
So, I still think that my nose is ugly?  Yes.   
 
Okay, great now I’m going to do some suggestions around that.   
 
If I suggest now for my self-hypnosis cycles that my nose is perfectly 
formed, it’s no different than any other nose and I can feel confident about 
who I am and how I look, will you accept that?  Sure.   
 
Great, you now know how to do it.  You know what to do for the next 21 
days and that is your cycle.  When you're done you’ll have cleared up that 
memory and be free of that limitation.   
 
That’s basically, the questioning strategy process in a nutshell.  Play with 
this and get used to it.  There are little subtleties that happen here, but 
there is a lot of power.  This is one of the most crucial troubleshooting 
stages in self-hypnosis.   
 
Very few programs teach something like this and when they do it means that 
you get to solve the reasons why it will fail for other people.  You now know 
how to make self-hypnosis work for you and you’ve got some vital keys on 
how to overcome the difficulties that keep other people stuck even if they 
know how to use the power of self-hypnosis in their lives.   
 
 
Track 10 – A Few Special Points To Bear In Mind 
Time: 3m 46s 
 
 
Before we finish today’s work on troubleshooting using the power pendulum, 
there are a couple of special notes I’d like you to be aware of.   
 

 
                                      The Power of Self-Hypnosis for Guaranteed

Stick To Psychologically Sound Territory 
First of all, when you use the power pendulum, you'll be using it 
psychologically that’s what it’s been designed to do in context of the Power 
of Self-Hypnosis Method.   
 
That means if you're going to read other people’s minds, if you were to say 
for example, does so and so love me?. If you want to predict the future or 
the winning lottery numbers for next week.   
 
Avoid ESP Or Occult Questions 
If you were going to do something, which requires extra special knowledge, 
which doesn't exist in the normal five senses or normal realms, at that point 
you're going to taint the use of the pendulum to give you questions or 
answers to things that it’s not designed to do, at least not in the context of 
this method.   
 
I strongly recommend that you avoid doing that so the power pendulum 
works for you exactly as you intend it to.  If you're going to do any kind of 
things like divination or anything like that, it’s entirely up to you but use a 
different system like tarot cards, dice or something else.  Do not use the 
power pendulum to do that.   
 
You're going to keep those two sides of your life totally separate so that you 
have something, which is systematic, workable and presentable.   
 
Are You Really Tired? 
The next thing to do is to realize that from time to time you get tired and so 
does your unconscious mind.  If you get tired, if you start getting silly 
responses or you start feeling fatigued, etc., recognize it’s one of two things.   
 
It’s either a defense mechanism or you're just absolutely knackered and it’s 
time to go to bed.   
 
If you are tired, take a break and that’s fine.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         211
In time you’ll learn to recognize the difference between your unconscious 
mind using it as a defense mechanism, saying I’m tired.  Its saying “Don’t 
go there.  Let’s avoid doing this.”   
 
If it does that then feel free to keep pushing through it, because you’ll 
uncover the material at the right rate for you.  If, on the other hand you can 
just barely keep your lids open, because you're very fatigued -- go to sleep. 
Its okay!  Tomorrow is another day and you get to do work then.   
 
Only Ask Loaded Questions 
Finally, it’s very important when you're asking questions of the unconscious 
that you make sure they're loaded in your favor.  Always ask a question 
along the lines of if.  How can I do this?  Can I do that?  That sort of thing. 
Don’t ask “why?” questions and don’t ask questions “Can I?  Am I able to do 
this?”.   
 
For example, can I change the way I feel about myself in this situation?  No.   
 
Where do you go from there?   
 
You're stuck.  The fact is you can change anything about how you look, feel, 
think or act -- anything.  Why give the unconscious mind an out?   
 
Ask it:  
 
How can I change?   
 
I want change in this way.  Is it appropriate?  No.   
 
I want to change in that way.  Is that appropriate?  No.  
 
That’s fine, but not:  
 
Am I able to change?   
 
Do I have the capacity of change inside me?   
 
If the unconscious mind at that point says “No”, you're screwed.  And you 
screwed yourself!

Therefore, don’t give your unconscious mind an option to stonewall you by 
saying “No” conclusively to something.  It’s going to require you to do a little 
bit of thinking ahead of time so that your questions don’t lead down a blind 
alley that it’s going to be difficult to get yourself out of.   
 
Remember those special cases.  It’s okay to be tired so have a rest.  Stick 
with it, so if you're tired, but not very tired.  Then it’s a question of a 
defense mechanism just go through it.  Avoid, shall we say, more esoteric 
uses of the pendulum.  Don’t use it for dowels or predict the future, read 
people’s minds and that kind of stuff.   
 
Finally, make sure the questions you ask are good questions that get you to 
where you want to go and don’t offer the opportunity to the unconscious 
mind to stonewall you and say “No, we're not going any further than this.”   
 
If you do these things you're going to have a powerful tool on your 
fingertips, literally, that will help you troubleshoot most problems you’ll 
come across in self-hypnosis.   
 
Track 11 - Bonus CD 3: How To Use The “Cryptic Alphabet System” 
To Troubleshoot Conflicts With Your Unconscious Mind 
Time: 0m 39s 
 
 
Before we end this recording I’d like to let you know there is also a special 
bonus CD.  This is bonus CD three, which has even more uses of the power 
pendulum.   
 
In particular we're talking about a special cryptic alphabet system that will 
allow you to get the unconscious mind to spell out exactly what the problem 
is.  That takes a bit more training and more information, so I put all that 
information for your use on bonus CD three.   
 
As soon as you're ready, jump on to that and listen to it.  It gives you even 
more in-depth uses of the power pendulum that will take the stuff you 
learned here into greater depths still.

Track 2 – How To Defeat Conscious Interference 
Time: 10m 41s 
 
Welcome to day six.  I hope you’ve been practicing your awakening 
induction.  If you have done it today yet, then can I strongly recommend 
that you go and listen to that first before we carry on here.   
 
Remember, this is the pathway to conditioning your mind and body to 
respond to you in the way that you want to, so it’s one of the most crucial 
steps you'll take in the whole system. 
 
The Interference Problem 
What I want to focus on today is answering the question: 
 
 What if your conscious mind is over active?   
 
 What if you just can’t help yourself and you keep interfering, trying too 
hard, activating the law of reverse effect, the harder you try, the more 
you fail that kind of thing?   
 
 What if your conscious mind keeps getting in the way?   
 
Why Conscious Interference Is A Problem 
Let me tell you a story about why it’s important to deal with this.  Imagine if 
you will there’s a husband and a wife and both are keen gardeners.  For 
some reason, as couples sometimes do they get into an argument and 
decide to have a competition to determine once and for all who the best 
gardener is.   
 
They both select an adjacent piece of ground and decide we're going to plant 
our things and in a couple of months time we’ll so who has a nicer garden.   
 
One of them plants, sows the seeds properly, prepares the ground, waters 
it, goes back inside, has a cup of tea and just waits.   
 
The other one is so keen to win, so wants to win that this person comes out 
every night and waters the garden.  Then just to check how things are going 

 
                                      The Power of Self-Hypnosis for Guaranteed 
                                                   Results Home Study Program

on will open up the ground, picks up the seeds, looks at them, puts them 
back in and say this is going okay.   
 
They then put more water on goes back in, comes back a half-hour and does 
the whole thing over again and this continues for a couple of weeks. 
 
So by this stage, the one garden is blossoming, looking fantastic.  The other 
one is looking bedraggled, weak and half the things aren’t growing at all.   
 
Leave Things Alone If You Want Them To Grow 
You don’t have to be a master gardener to figure out what’s going on there.  
There comes a time when you just have to leave things alone.  In fact, a 
cousin of mine who’s a chef says, the biggest mistake people make when 
they're cooking is they keep interfering with their food; just put it in the pan 
and let it do its thing.   
 
The same is true for self-hypnosis.  If you want the power of self-hypnosis to 
work for you, just put it in the pan and let the unconscious mind do its thing.  
You're not doing the cooking.  All you're doing is saying this is what I want 
to have at the end of it.   
 
You're going to order from the menu and say this is the meal I want Mr. 
Chef, go ahead and do your magic.   
 
It would be ridiculous for me to go to a restaurant and try and tell the chef 
you should be cutting carrots this way, cooking the soup that way, are you 
sure you don’t want to turn that thing over now and I’m picking up a spoon 
and actually doing it for him that’s a recipe for disaster, because you’ll get 
kicked out the restaurant and never get your meal.   
 
The same is true of your unconscious mind.  So up to this point, you’ve been 
so eager to make this work for you that you’re getting in the way, trying 
everything to make it extra special and work.  At that point, it’s time to kick 
back and relax and let your unconscious mind do the work.   
 
How To Cut Out Interference 
How do we do this?

Key 1: Keep The Conscious Mind Busy 
The secret is to keep the conscious mind busy without letting it interfere 
with the process that’s going on.  In other words, you have to distract the 
conscious mind and get it to do something else.   
 
Key 2: Stay Engaged 
The key is not to disengage.  Sometimes people decide this isn’t working so 
I’ll do something completely different and that could work if the unconscious 
mind gets the idea that it has to keep engaged and keep working on the 
problem.   
 
If it doesn't and says “I guess he doesn't find this important anymore” at 
that point, you're disengaged and nothing happens anymore, so you want to 
keep yourself engaged without being too engaged, without being interfering.   
 
Key 3: Discover An Ancient Chinese Secret 
We're going to do this by borrowing a leaf from an ancient Chinese 
philosophy called Taoism.   
 
Taoism is very interesting, because the whole philosophy is based on this 
one principle: the idea of  
 
 Trusting your inner nature,  
 Letting your unconscious do the work so the conscious mind just gets 
to appreciate things,  
 Set the scene and then let the emotions, unconscious and events roll 
out as they will and trust that the best outcome will come about.   
 
There are a couple of examples of Taoism that I want to show you to 
describe this.   
 
Chinese Secret 1: Act Without Acting – Wei Wu Wei 
The first one is the idea of Wei Wu Wei, which means doing without doing.   
 
It sounds like a paradox, how can you do something without doing anything?

Until you start mastering the power of self-hypnosis, then it suddenly starts 
making sense. 
 
You do without doing by handing responsibility over to the unconscious mind 
and say you do it   
 
“I’m going to sit here, sip my cup of tea, enjoy the sunshine, read my paper 
and let you get on with the work at hand at that point magic can actually 
happen.” 
 
Chinese Secret 2: Know Without Knowing – Pu 
There is another little quote from the Tao, which is The Tao that can be 
named is not the true Tao.   
 
Basically, the way that can be named is not the true way and again, this 
describes the same idea:  If your intellect can grasp it, can pigeonhole it and 
put it into a little box you’ve probably already missed the point.   
 
The Four Taoist Sages 
Therefore, we’re going to take a leaf to of this Taoist philosophy and the four 
maneuvers or advanced suggestion strategies I’ll share with you, I’ve named 
them the Four Taoist Sages in honor of this ancient Chinese philosophy 
that worked stuff out four or five thousand years ago.   
 
Here are the four Taoists sages. 
 
1. The first one is a Pre-Hypnotic Suggestion and I’ll show you how to 
do that in a moment.   
 
2. The second is Hypnotic Questions, sometimes known as 
“Afformations.”   
 
3. Next we have Emotional Streaming or “Emo-streaming.”   
 
4. Finally, we have what I call The Big Drift.  This is a beautiful 
technique, which I borrowed straight from another competent 
hypnotist called Ernest Rossi.

Follow The Tortoise Into Wonderland 
We're looking to bet on the tortoise, not the hare.   
 
We're not trying to get instant results immediately.  We want to get results 
over a period of time so we're planting those seeds, getting out of the way 
and letting nature do what it does best, grow things, make things happen.   
 
The Power Of “Sleep On It” 
One of the ways to do this is to activate the power of ‘sleep on it’.  We’ve 
done this before.  You have a problem you can’t quite figure out, so 
someone says “just sleep on it and see how you feel in the morning.”   
 
The reason they say that is because that’s an intuitive grasping of 
something.  You're handing responsibility of working the problem out to your 
unconscious mind and letting it do its work.  So we're going to activate the 
power of ‘sleep on it’ by using it in combination with the four Taoists sages.   
 
You’re Already Doing It! 
Believe it or not, you’ve been doing this already.  If you’ve been following 
my recommendation and been doing at least one self-hypnosis practice the 
last thing at night just before you get into bed and sleep then you’ve already 
activated the power of ‘sleep on it’.   
 
So you’ve got your time in self-hypnosis, at which point you’ve planted the 
seed, watering it, packing the grown down and making sure it’s all nice and 
neat.   
 
Then by going to sleep it’s like going back inside the kitchen while a nice 
gentle rain shower comes down and starts feeding the whole ground; you're 
getting out of the way already.   
 
Now whilst you're sleeping the unconscious mind has totally free rein to 
integrate experiences.   
 
You Reap What You Sow (Before Sleep!) 
Typically it will integrate it most profoundly the very last experience you 
have inside your consciousness before you go to sleep.  So, if you do your

self-hypnosis practice immediately before you go to sleep that’s a perfect 
way to activate the four Taoist sages, even if you're using the classic 
suggestion methods. So use the power of ‘sleep on it’.   
 
How The Power Of “Sleep On It” Changed The World! 
It’s not just me making it up let’s face it, you’ve had those experiences in 
your own life.   
 
I’d like to share a couple of stories of great scientists who have actually used 
the power of ‘sleep on it’ to make their ground breaking inventions. 
 
A Completely New Chemistry 
One of these scientists is August Kekule.   
 
He’s the one who discovered the Benzene molecule and with it discovered a 
whole branch of chemistry called organic chemistry.  The structure of a 
benzene molecule was eluding him for ages until one day he decided just to 
sleep on it.   
 
The next day when he got up, he was just going on about his daily business.  
I believe he was getting on to a bus, going into the university when suddenly 
it just struck him like a flash of lightning.   
 
He had this vision of the Ouroboros, which is the snake that bites their own 
tail and with it, he had the insight that that must be the shape that a 
benzene molecule takes.  In other words, it forms a chain where the last link 
in the chain forms back on to itself.   
 
Faster Than Light! 
Albert Einstein is famous for coming up with the theory of relativity whilst 
having a dream, in which he was riding on a beam of light.  That means that 
he had the insight two or three years before he had the mathematical know 
how to be able to prove that his insight was correct.   
 
That means his unconscious mind was two years ahead of his intellect being 
able to keep up with him and that’s the power you're activating.  T

hat’s the power that the four Taoist sages are designed to get active in your 
life.  Remember, you don’t have to use the four Taoist sages.   
 
Start With The Classics 
I still recommend that you start off with the classic methods first.    
 
Let The Four Taoist Sages Fight Interference 
If you find yourself interfering, trying too hard, not knowing how to make 
something come about, not able to enter that restful, calm and receptive 
state of mind; because you're thinking too much, trying to take control of 
the process by saying this is how it should be and getting worried or excited 
in a way that gets your intellect engaged that’s the point, at which you use 
the four Taoist sages.   
 
A Taoist Change Of Pace 
From time to time you may want to do them just for fun anyway as a 
variation and a separate way of doing things, but it’s good for you to have 
the entire range of activities.   
 
You have the quick bursts, which come from the classic methods and you 
have the slightly longer more drawn out method from the Taoist sages, but 
they have also overcome some of the most severe limitations, especially 
when you have things like a dirty goal.   
 
With that thought in mind, let’s go into the first of the four Taoist sages, the 
pre-hypnotic suggestion.   
 
 
Track 3 – Sage 1: Pre-Hypnotic Suggestions 
Time: 8m 37s 
 
 
Its So Easy You Have Done It Already! 
The interesting thing about pre-hypnotic suggestions that if you’ve been 
following the advice on day four, which is the classic suggestion methods, 
you’ve been doing the pre-hypnotic suggestion without even realizing it.

Unconscious Priming Studies 
When you set your time limit and make your safety statement that’s a pre-
hypnotic suggestion.  The place this comes from is psychological studies on 
something called “Priming.”   
 
Basically, we all have a vocabulary where we will take ambiguous words and 
understand them in a particular way.   
 
For example, the word “bank” can mean many things.   
 
 it can be a bank where money is kept,  
 it can be the side of a river – a riverbank, but  
 it could also be a maneuver that an airplane makes.   
 
When you have an ambiguous word, the unconscious mind will resolve it 
with a probability towards one rather than the other.  In other words, 
whenever you hear the word bank it will first flash you that one and see if it 
fits the sentence you're in and if it doesn't, it will come up with the other 
meanings.   
 
A Word At The Right Time Changes Your Outlook 
Scientists did the following experiment.  They had people, at a subliminal 
level, listening to certain words.  For example, “water.”  Immediately 
afterwards they were given the word, which is ambiguous like the word 
“bank.”   
 
The interesting thing is, whilst without this kind of priming people would 
think of a bank in terms of money bank and write that down.   
 
When they were primed, in other words, when the unconscious mind had a 
subtle cue like water or something like that, at that point, they instantly 
flashed to a riverbank.   
 
So they pre-selected out of all the experiences the one that you want people 
to end up having.

Pre-Hypnotic Suggestions Use The Priming Effect 
Therefore, a pre-hypnotic suggestion activates a trace inside your mind.  
When you go into hypnosis the unconscious mind says  
 
“What do we do?   
 
“I’ve got this thing hanging about, I guess that’s what I’ll work on and that’s 
how you're going to use.”   
 
The P-TACK Formula For Success 
The method to use it is very straightforward.  We're going to take the simple 
TACK formula we learned on day two and add a ‘‘P’’ in front of it, ‘P’-TACK. 
 
The TACK formula is  
 
 Go into trance,  
 Have this attitude of receptivity and so on.   
 Then there’s the CAVE model, and  
 At the end of it you have this knowledge that things are going to work 
out.   
 
You're going to start it off with a ‘‘P’’ at the beginning for “Parameters” or 
“Priming Response.”   
 
How To Prime A Pre-Hypnotic Suggestion 
How do you do that?   
 
In exactly the same way you primed yourself to stay in hypnosis only a 
certain amount of time to emerge totally alert and ready to deal with 
whatever comes your way should an emergency arise.   
 
In other words, you just say it and intend it.  You fill your mind with the 
idea.  Here’s how you're going to use it.   
 
Step 1: Choose A Suggestion 
Step one, you’ll take a suggestion or idea or goal you want to achieve.

For the purpose today, we’ll focus on the idea of mastering self-hypnosis.  
That’s why you're here right so you may as well use it to get what you're 
trying to achieve.  We're going to take a simple idea of a suggestion.   
 
For example, “I’m mastering self-hypnosis now” simple, direct and 
straightforward.   
 
Step 2: Fully Consider The Idea 
The ‘P’ stage will be for you to consider two things.   
 
 First consider the statement; “I’m mastering the power of self-
hypnosis for myself.”   
 
Consider and think about what it means having that power working in 
your life.   
 
 Then come back to the idea.  “I am mastering the power of self-
hypnosis in my life.“  
 
And again, let your mind think about what this actually means.  Enjoy 
that.   
 
Fully Consider The Idea Behind The Suggestion 
Remember, as we talked about before you want the energy, the juice, the 
payoff of this, not just the activity of doing self-hypnosis, but the payoff you 
get as a result and that is to say this amazing life, this clear, calm mind, this 
healthy, strong body and all of the other things you want to have in your 
life;  
 
I am mastering the power of self-hypnosis.   
 
Step 3: Begin Your Power Self-Hypnosis Practice As Before 
Once you’ve done that for a few minutes, maybe three or four rounds of 
repeating that and thinking about it, when you are getting a sense that your 
mind is getting it, it’s clicked with this idea, then go straight into your TACK.   
 
As you did the hypnosis thing previously – in the classic method – where you 
have CAVE, which is

1. You have your Convincer,  
2. Followed by the Affirmation,  
3. Visualization  
4. And finally you're Drifting through the experience…  
 
We're going to modify this and make it simpler.   
 
A Simplified CAVE Cycle 
We're going to change CAVE to CSD.  So you have your convincer still so 
you know you're in self-hypnosis.  At this point, you should go to a place of 
sanctuary, a place of ideal comfort and relaxation and a place to chill out 
and relax.   
 
Step 4: A Relaxing Place 
Some people like to imagine themselves on the beach or swinging in a 
hammock between palm trees.  Others like to be in a calm, cool mountain 
retreat.  Someone else might enjoy the sporting activity of skiing down an 
amazing mountain run and someone else might enjoy a walk through 
nature.   
 
It doesn't matter what scene you choose, as long as there is a scene that 
you personally find deeply relaxing.   
 
You're going to engage yourself in that scene.  Look about, check out who’s 
there, what you can do, what it feels like being there and enjoying that 
scene for however long your period of self-hypnosis can last, five, ten, 
twenty minutes whatever it is.   
 
Allow Your Mind To Drift 
Then at some stage as you're going through this mental fantasy trip you're 
going to allow yourself to start drifting.  In other words, you’ve enjoyed this 
fantasy trip for a while so allow your mind to unwind.  If it wants to carry on 
in that place great.  If it starts thinking about random stuff; fantastic just let 
whatever comes up, come up.

Special Rule 1: Do NOT Steer! 
The only caveat I’ll say here is, if you starting thinking about the problem 
and trying to engage it so to steer it in some direction, then don’t go right 
back to your pleasant scene.   
 
Special Rule 2: Break Negative Cycles 
If you find yourself contemplating some negative things to a point where 
you're actually feeling a negative emotion again, break the cycle and go 
back to the pleasant scene.  The key is that your state, emotion or mood is 
one of positive calm relaxation. 
 
At the same time, once you’ve finished with the relaxing place you can drift 
to wherever you go provided your conscious mind doesn't try to interfere, 
make it steer, make something specific happen and you remain in that 
restive, emotional state.   
 
You don’t want to get yourself all worked up about something, something 
about something negative and going down a negative cycle at that point, 
pull yourself back.  The good news is those last two caveats or conditions, 
very rarely happen.   
 
Most of the time you’ll go in, have a pleasant scene, enjoy it, you might drift 
a little bit, you might sense that maybe it’s time to come back now and you 
come back in the safe knowledge that something wonderful has happened.  
You look forward to a bright future, count yourself out and open your eyes 
feeling refreshed, alert and fantastic.   
 
 
Step 5: Return From Trance 
Then you check your clock again to make sure that you’ve been keeping the 
time parameters that you’ve said to yourself and that’s it you’ve done the 
whole method now.   
 
 
Let’s repeat.   
 
 You're going to start off by priming.

 You’ll set your time and safety statement as before.   
 
 
 Then you’ll think something along the lines of, I’m mastering the 
power of self-hypnosis for myself.   
 
 You’ll contemplate what that means to fill your mind with the idea; do 
a few cycles of that.   
 
 Then you go to your convincer–  
 
Close your eyes; get in touch with your arm, arm relaxing, relaxing, 
relaxing, there you go.   
 
 When your arm starts relaxing, feeling comfortable, heavy, a healthy 
glow, whatever then start contemplating some wonderful calming 
scene; a beachside, a walk through the woods, walking your dog, 
going for a swim, something pleasant and relaxing.   
 
Sometimes I enjoy just having a raft on a river and that river draws 
me down a path of infinity.  Other times I’ll sit on a train and hear that 
regular, monotonous sound as the train passes through that infinite 
tunnel.   
 
I see those lights flashing by and I get to use ease backing those 
comfortable chairs, in my train they're comfortable and listen to the 
sounds and let things pass by as the scenery comes and goes.   
 
 It doesn't matter what it is let your imagination run wild and enjoy 
this.  As you're drifting through this experience you’ll find at some 
point your attention will wander to other things and that’s fine.  The 
point is, when you feel it’s time to come back, you bring yourself back.   
 
 Check out your watch to make sure that your time limits are still 
correct and you're done.  Practice that before we go on to doing 
hypnotic questions.

Track 4 – PSH Exercise: Pre-Hypnotic Suggestions 
Time: 5m 05s 
 
 
Let’s do a quick run of the pre-hypnotic suggestions so make yourself 
comfortable and find a comfortable position as you’ve been doing before.   
 
Step 1: Set The Parameters (Pre-Hypnotic Suggestion (PHS)) 
 
PHS 1: Time Limit 
I’m going to ask you to think about the time limits.  Let’s say “I’m going to 
take five minutes to do hypnosis.”   
 
PHS 2: Emergency Response 
You're going to use your normal safety statements so just remind yourself of 
that.  Very good.   
 
PHS 3: Main Affirmation 
As we're here to do self-hypnosis, just repeat to yourself the affirmation 
suggestion  
 
I am mastering the power of self-hypnosis.  
 
And get a sense of what that means.   
 
 How will you feel as a master of self-hypnosis?   
 How would you react and respond?   
 How would you be in the world?   
 
I am mastering the power of power of self-hypnosis.   
 
 What does that mean?   
 How is your life going to be different?   
 
I am mastering the power of self-hypnosis.  
 
Consider all the implications.

I am mastering the power of self-hypnosis.   
 
Allow your mind to go to the place where you are a master of the power of 
self-hypnosis and you're using it in your life in everything, to make your life 
easier, smoother and happier.   
 
Step 2: Clear Mind 
When you're ready, take a deep breath in, breathe out, relax, close your 
eyes and allow your mind to clear.   
 
Step 3: ‘C’ (CAVE) Convincer 
Get in touch with your right arm.  Get a sense of your right arm.  Tell your 
right arm to relax.  My right arm is relaxing, relaxing, relaxing.   
 
Every time you remind yourself that your right arm is relaxing just check in 
with it.  Notice what happens.  Keep doing that on your own.  Get a sense of 
what’s happening in that arm.  Don’t try and make anything happen.   
 
Very good.   
 
Step 4: ‘AVE’ (CAVE) Drift In A Pleasant Scene 
Now allow your pleasant scene to arise.  Get a sense of it.   
 
 What’s the temperature like?   
 Are you inside or outside?   
 Is it day or night?   
 Are you alone or with other people?   
 
Get a full sense and enjoy this scene.  Explore it.  Feel it.  Hear the sounds.  
See the sights, at least pretend to and at some point, just allow yourself to 
drift.  You can drift in the same scene or you can allow the scene to alter.  
The key is not to try and make anything happen just let whatever arises, 
arise and that’s just fine.

Step 5: Return From Trance 
Bring yourself back counting from one to five.  At the count of three make 
sure you get back into your body, feeling your arms and legs and everything 
coming back to normal. At the count of four start stretching. At the count of 
five open your eyes feeling refreshed, relaxed, alert and simply fantastic, 
looking forward to an amazing future with the power of self-hypnosis. 
 
 
Track 5 – Sage 2: Hypnotic Question 
Time: 5m 41s 
 
 
Welcome back.   
 
Afformations & Hypnotic Questions 
I’d like to introduce you now to the idea of hypnotic questions.   
 
Some people call this ‘Afformations’ with an ‘O’ in order to distinguish it from 
‘Affirmations’ where you merely make the statement.   
 
Insight 1: Ask Loaded Questions 
With an ‘Afformation’ – or a hypnotic question – you are asking yourself a 
loaded question so your unconscious mind has to answer it by responding to 
the inherent or implied idea within it.   
 
Insight 2: The Unconscious MUST Answer Every Question 
Hypnotic questions rely on a simple, but very profound principle and that is 
to say that the unconscious mind will try and answer a question a long time 
after the conscious mind has already given up or been satisfied with the 
answer it has gotten.   
 
So your unconscious mind is always looking for even better quality of 
responses, which means you have a certain responsibility.  If you ask a poor 
question, a question loaded in a negative way then you're hypnotizing 
yourself for a negative outcome.

Insight 3: The Wrong Questions Have Hurt You! 
Here’s the classic way people do it.   
 
 Why am I such a failure?   
 Why do I always mess up?   
 Why does no one like me?   
 Why do I always have such bad luck?   
 Why does this always have to happen to me?   
 
Notice these are classic questions that people ask themselves all the time!   
 
How To Switch Off Destructive Questions 
If you're going to do that, switch the question around so you're getting the 
question to direct you to where you want to go.   
 
 How can I succeed?   
 How can I solve this problem?   
 How many ways do I know that I have mastered self-hypnosis?   
 In how many ways is self-hypnosis becoming a part of my every day 
life?   
 In how many ways will the power of self-hypnosis help augment my 
life and give me everything I want?   
 How quickly am I mastering the power of self-hypnosis?   
 
Do you notice how those questions are loaded in your favor, because in 
order to answer those questions the one thing you're implying or 
presupposing, the thing you're assuming is that you are using this as self-
hypnosis and you're doing so successfully.   
 
The ‘Deep Thought’ Process For Activating The Power Of Hypnotic 
Questions 
The method we're going to use for hypnotic questions is something that I 
borrowed directly from the ‘iMethod’ called Deep Thought.   
 
It’s very simple.  We're going to go back to our CAVE cycle.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         232
Step 1: Set The Parameters 
So you have the parameters you're starting off with.  
 
Step 2: ‘C’ (CAVE) Convincer 
And then you do the convincer.   
 
Step 3: ‘AV’ (CAVE) Hypnotic Questions 
However, instead of doing the affirmation at the ‘AV’ part of the stage we're 
going to go straight into the Afformation – in other words; the hypnotic 
questions.   
 
So once your right arm is heavy and relaxed, the next step is for you to start 
asking yourself a hypnotic question.  Again, for the purposes of what we're 
doing here, given that you want to master self-hypnosis, the question should 
be related to self-hypnosis.   
 
The one I’ll use in the demonstration example is:  
 
How quickly am I mastering the power of self-hypnosis?   
 
This is how you use it.  You’ve got the convincer.  You ask the question,  
 
“How quickly am I mastering the power of self-hypnosis?”  
 
Step 4: Collect Impressions 
You allow your mind to grow quiet and drift.   
 
As you allow your unconscious mind to bring in feelings, pictures, ideas, 
thoughts, hunches, whatever it is, just collect them.   
 
Step 5: Cycle Back To Hypnotic Questions 
After a while, especially if you find yourself drifting off track a little bit, ask 
the question again.   
 
How quickly am I mastering the power of self-hypnosis?

Again, some images and ideas will come to mind, not all of them will make 
sense and that’s okay just let whatever comes, come.   
 
How quickly am I mastering the power of self-hypnosis? 
 
Do this for the entire cycle.   
 
Step 6: ‘E’ (CAVE) Drift 
At the end of the cycle, back to the visualization and drifting stage of the 
CAVE cycle you're going to let yourself drift again exactly the same way 
previously as you did in the pre-hypnotic suggestions.   
 
After you’ve done this for a few minutes allow your mind to grow open, 
expansive, relaxed and comfortable, so you're not trying to make anything 
happen, you're drifting.  As you're drifting, let it drift in any direction it 
wants to go, same rules apply.   
 
Remember Special Rule 1: Don’t Steer The Boat! 
If you find yourself trying to think about the actual problem or question you 
have in mind steering it to a certain outcome then either let it go or go right 
back to asking the hypnotic question and awaiting some kind of response of 
answer.   
 
In other words, you're trying to stop your intellect from doing precisely this.   
 
Remember Special Rule 2: Break Negative Cycles! 
The other thing is, if you should start drifting into some kind of negative 
state, which draws your mood down to a negative mood then go right back 
to the question and let that re-direct you back to the positive experience.   
 
Other than that, allow your experience to drift to wherever it wants to go.   
 
Step 7: Return From Trance 
At the end of the whole cycle, collect the impressions you had and then 
bring yourself back counting one to five.  So when you're back outside you 
can recall whatever recollections you have in terms of the impressions you 
had and then get on with your daily life.

Remember To ‘Sleep On It’! 
As before, this method is particularly powerful if you use it just before going 
to bed, because just like those scientists, they were thinking about certain 
ideas, racking their brains trying to solve some kind of problem and then 
they fell asleep.   
 
So that problem or question was upper most in their mind as they fell asleep 
and that’s exactly the question that the unconscious mind ended up 
answering.   
 
Notice again, by the way that the unconscious mind didn't give them the 
answer right away.   
 
It wasn’t the very first time they asked the question it happened after 
sometimes a couple of week’s worth of work.   
 
Remember the 21-day rule?  
 
It still applies here, so when you're ready to have a go at this go on to the 
next track where I’ll give you a five-minute demonstration of this particular 
hypnotic process in action. 
 
 
Track 6 – PSH Exercise: Hypnotic Questions 
Time: 5m 16s 
 
 
Make yourself comfortable.   
 
Step 1: Set The Parameters 
 
Time Limit 
As before begin by setting your time limit for this particular session, five 
minutes.

Emergency Response 
Make your safety statements.  
 
Step 2: Clear Your Mind 
And as soon as you’ve done all of that take a deep breath, close your eyes, 
breathe out and relax.  Clear your mind.   
 
Step 3: ‘C’ (CAVE) Convincer 
Now, get in touch with your right arm.  Tell your right arm to relax.  Tell 
your right arm to relax.   
 
My right arm is relaxing.  My right arm is relaxing.   
 
Just focus on that for a while.   
 
Step 4: ‘AV’ (CAVE) Hypnotic Questions 
Then, when you're ready, feel connected to the arm, you feel it starting to 
relax and feel heavier begin to ask yourself the question:  
 
How quickly am I mastering the power of self-hypnosis in my life?   
 
Be curious as to what sense, impressions, feelings, ideas, images come to 
mind.  How quickly am I mastering the power of self-hypnosis?   
 
Allow what comes to come.   
 
How quickly am I mastering the power of self-hypnosis in my life?   
 
Keep repeating that question.  I will be silent for a while, but keep repeating 
that question slowly and allowing yourself plenty of time between the 
questions for ideas, images, hunches, feelings, etc., to start flashing up and 
just notice them.   
 
Simply notice them.   
 
The next time I speak just allow yourself to drift.

Step 5: ‘E’ (CAVE) Drift 
Very good. 
 
Just allow you're mind to drift comfortably for the remainder of the session.   
 
Step 6: Return From Trance 
Okay, it’s time to come back now.  As soon as you're ready count yourself 
back, one to five.   
 
 At the count of three you're getting back into your body.  
 At the count of four getting a little stretch.   
 At the count of five open your eyes feeling refreshed, relaxed, alert 
and simply fantastic.   
 
Do this at your own rate and pace knowing that a bright, new future is 
coming to get you.   
 
 
Track 7 – Sage 3: Emo-Streaming 
Time: 7m 05s 
 
 
The Third Sage is called ‘Emo-Streaming or emotional streaming’.   
 
Surf Your Emotions 
Essentially this is the same kind of idea as hypnotic questions only rather 
than basing it on intuitions, hunches or intellectual things we’ll be surfing the 
emotions and moods instead.   
 
Get Out Of The Content 
The main purpose for Emo-Streaming is for those people who find it difficult 
to get out of the form or content of their goal allowing the general idea of 
the goal, the excitement and energy behind it to drive them.   
 
If you find yourself thinking about

 I have to have this one Ferrari.   
 I have to have this one person that has to marry me or I’ll never be 
happy.   
 I have to have this one job or I’ll never succeed.   
 I have to do it in this one way or I just can’t get my outcome.   
 
If you find yourself getting stuck in that kind of mode you're basically 
holding on to the form, to the content too much and this is a great way to 
get yourself out of that.   
 
Switch Between Emo-Streaming & Classic Suggestions 
At the very least create the ground in which your regular sense of 
suggestions can start working again.   
 
You can do this for a while and then go back to classic suggestions or you 
can do the whole process with just this.   
 
How To Do Emo-Streaming 
 
Like Hypnotic Questions 
To use this you're going to go through the deep thought process again.  This 
time when it comes to asking the hypnotic questions what you’ll be asking is 
something about the way you feel after the goal.   
 
Go Beyond Your Goal 
Think of a timeline.  You're here on date (X).  On date (Y) in two months, 
two years whatever it is you’ll have achieved your goal and on date (Z) 
you’ll have gone way beyond having achieved the goal, which is all in the 
past.    
 
Ask Questions About Your Emotions 
So you want to take yourself mentally to date (Z) and ask yourself these 
questions: 
 
 How would I be feeling as a person?   
 What would I be like as a person?

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         238
 How will I feel as a person at that point?   
 
Avoid ‘Thinking’ – Start ‘Feeling’ 
You're not looking to intellectually come up with an answer in terms of I’ll be 
doing these things and having these things and so on you're looking for an 
emotional response.   
 
How will I feel when I’ve achieved (X) and beyond?   
 
An Example 
So in the context of what I’m doing here, the main question would be 
something like: 
 
How will I feel when I’ve mastered the power of self-hypnosis and have gone 
well beyond that?   
 
Focus On The Emotions That Come  
As in the hypnotic questions, in other words, the deep thought process, 
you're allowing instincts, flashes of ideas, images etc., to flash up and what 
you're looking for the evocations or feelings, allowing an emotion to come 
up.   
 
You're going to maintain your focus on that idea until an emotion starts 
welling up and you can focus that emotion and watch it grow.  If you find 
yourself getting distracted go right back to the question again.   
 
Return To Your Theme 
How will I feel when I have mastered the power of self-hypnosis and I have 
gone well beyond?   
 
An emotion arises, maybe a sense of empowerment, maybe a sense of being 
on purpose, joy and happiness, success and achievement.  I don’t know 
what it will be for you, but if you ask the question then wait and watch for 
an emotion to arise and focus on that, you will find it.

YOU Don’t Make Anything Happen! 
A crucial bit here, as in all the Taoist sages, is it’s not your conscious mind’s 
responsibility to make this happen.  It’s not up to your conscious mind to 
direct the experience your only conscious involvement is to notice whatever 
emotions arise and as long as they're pleasant or empowering in some way, 
focus your attention on them and watch them grow.   
 
You're not going to make it happen, the only thing you're going to do is ask 
the question and notice what it evokes.  Think of it in terms of dropping a 
pebble into a pond.  When you throw a pebble in you’ll see ripples.   
 
You can’t make the water make ripples the pebble will do it spontaneously or 
automatically that’s what happens when pebbles go into water.   
 
It’s the same way when you ask yourself questions answers will start coming 
back.  You may not be aware of them in the beginning and that’s okay, your 
job is merely to ask the question, throw the pebble in and then start being 
sensitive for what kind of ripples come back.   
 
Therefore, the only thing you’re looking for is to trigger this state of having 
achieved things.  The trigger this emotion of having gone beyond having 
mastered the power of self-hypnosis that’s what you’re going to do, don’t try 
and make it happen that’s the key piece here.   
 
How Emo-Streaming & Hypnotic Questions Saved Me From Bankruptcy! 
I’d like to give you an example of how I used this myself at the beginning of 
my career as a hypnotherapist and coach.   
 
I had just left my law firm and was laboring under the very false impression 
that if I was good enough at my job, people would come knocking at my 
doors ready and willing to work with me.   
 
That’s true if you happen to be working for the best law firm in the world.  
It’s not so true if you're just setting up shop as a hypnotist or coach for the 
first time and no one even knows you exist so my business skills were, shall 
we say, a little bit poor at the time.

The one thing I did do, because I didn't have any idea on how to actually 
run, start, advertise, market a business or anything like that and my budget 
wasn’t the largest either.   
 
One thing I did every single day was make sure I went into hypnosis and I 
pretty much did exactly what I’m asking you to do here.  The questions I 
asked myself were– 
 
 How is this becoming a successful business?   
 How am I going to make my money?   
 
I just paused and let things come my way.   
 
I asked the question again, pause and let ideas come my way then I’d ask 
the question again.   
 
Sometimes I actually had genuine ideas of things to do, people to talk to, 
places to go and so on.  At other times, I had this tremendous feeling that 
it’s all going to work out.   
 
I would drift around in that for a while, come back refreshed, my panic for 
the day was over and I could get on with doing useful things.   
 
Here’s the interesting thing as a result of doing this, I was in this mindset of 
anything is possible, I knew it was going to work out and somehow this 
started rubbing off on people.   
 
I was out one day, I met some new people and one of them offered me a job 
as a coach at a training company.  
 
So I assisted there for a while.  Suddenly I landed my first international 
conglomerate coaching contract.  It was for a huge Fortune 500 company 
and I honestly still don’t know how it happened it was a pure stroke of luck.   
 
Here’s the thing, I was in a state where everything was possible; I was in 
that afterglow and that person decided to take a risk on me even though 
they only met me for that first time and only had the interaction of that 
particular evening with me.   
 
At that point, it opened a door.

The next thing I had to do is keep doing this to make sure that when I 
actually got my first coaching clients I did good work with them.  Notice how 
the very things you're doing here sets your mind up for success, especially 
when your conscious mind has no idea of what should happen or how to do 
it.

Step 4: ‘AV’ (CAVE) Emo-Streaming  
Now that you're through that, it’s time for you to focus on the evoking of the 
emotional response.   
 
Ask Hypnotic Questions 
Ask yourself a question,  
 
How will I feel when I’ve mastered the power of self-hypnosis in my life and 
I’ve gone well beyond?   
 
Allow yourself to drift and notice for any emotions that start to arise.   
 
How will I feel when I’ve mastered the power of self-hypnosis in my life and 
I’ve gone well beyond?   
 
When an emotion arises, maybe a sense of joy, excitement, purpose or 
achievement, just focus on it and allow it to sit within you and let it grow.   
 
After a while ask yourself again:  
 
How will I feel when I’ve mastered the power of self-hypnosis in my life and 
have gone well beyond?   
 
Notice the emotion come– pay attention.  Let it grow and then go beyond it.   
 
How will I feel when I’ve achieved mastery of the power of self-hypnosis 
and I’ve gone well beyond that?   
 
Keep repeating that question and noticing the emotions that come up.   
 
Step 5: ‘E’ (CAVE) Drift 
Okay.  Now allow yourself to drift.  Whatever emotions are there just allow 
those to guide you and make you drift through different experiences.   
 
No need to think or do anything.  No need to wonder or contemplate.  Just 
feel those emotions drawing you along like a raft drawing you across a river.  
You get to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.

Step 6: Return From Trance 
When you're ready, count one to five.   
 
 At the count of three you're getting back to your body.   
 At the count of four, stretching.   
 At the count of five open your eyes feeling refreshed, relaxed, alert 
and simply fantastic, looking forward to a bright, new, fresh, shiny 
future.   
 
 
Track 9 – Introducing The BIG Drift 
Time: 1m 07s 
 
 
Welcome back again.   
 
I call this next exercise ‘The BIG Drift’ it’s the final of the four Taoist sages.   
 
I call it the big drift, because you end up drifting a lot.  The key to doing the 
big drift is for your conscious mind to play the role of a witness, an observer 
just noticing the responses that are happening without making anything 
happen just allow things to occur. 
 
If you follow through with the exercises on the previous three Taoist sages, 
you’ll find this one very easy to do.  If you have any difficulty just go back 
and start playing with the other Taoist sages first.  Get used to those and 
then you’ll trust your inner process enough to be able to go with the big 
drift.   
 
The easiest way to do the big drift is for me to guide you through it first and 
then afterwards break down the seven stages so you can do it on your own 
any time you want or need to.   
 
Hypnotic Warning 
If you're driving a car or operating any kind of machinery stop what you're 
doing.  As soon as you're ready to dive in just move on to the next track and 
enjoy the process of going through the big drift.

Track 10 – PSH Exercise: The BIG Drift 
Time: 10m 34s 
 
 
Step 1: Prepare Yourself 
 
Relax 
As soon as you're ready to begin sit yourself in a chair somewhere, make 
yourself comfortable and relax.   
 
Hands Up 
To begin this process I’d like you to lift your hands up and face them palm to 
palm as if you're caught in the middle of a clapping motion.  Keep two – five 
inches in between those palms.   
 
The distance is not important.   
 
Stay Loose & Relaxed 
The key thing is to keep your shoulders and elbows loose and out in the 
open.  Shake your shoulders out a little bit; let your elbows become nice and 
loose.  Make sure it’s not resting on anything or inhibited in any way.   
 
Interim Step: Clear Your Mind 
As soon as you’ve done that, take a deep breath, breathe out, relax, clear 
your mind.   
 
Sense 
Look at those arms.  Look at hose hands as though they weren’t your hands.  
Get a sense of those hands out there as though they weren’t even your 
hands.  Notice the curiosity of seeing arms out in front of you that might not 
even be your own.   
 
As you get a sense of that distance between yourself, those arms and hands 
out there, you can also begin to tune into their sensations in those hand

over there.  Perhaps you can feel the radiation of heat from one hand in the 
other hand.   
 
 Which of those hands is feeling warmer right now?   
 Which of those hands is feeling more relaxed and more comfortable?   
 
Get a sense of those arms over there and the sensations that accompany 
them.  Notice any other sensations that accompany at the same time.  As 
you get a full sense of awareness of those hands over there, just allow your 
mind and thoughts to wander and drift.   
 
Step 2: Review Resources 
Think about, which of those hands feels like it wants to make its path down 
to your lap first.   
 
One of those arms will naturally begin the motion downwards towards the 
lap as the other one remains up there.   
 
Meanwhile, your thoughts can drift and recall experiences of great success, 
of achievement as that hand begins to drift down towards your lap recalling 
experiences, life lessons and learnings.   
 
At some point, you were a child and you learned important things like how 
to speak, how to move, how to interact with others.  A child has to learn 
kindness and all kinds of things.   
 
Then there are those teenage years and all the changes that occur then, 
fluctuating emotions and you made it through all that and learned many 
important lessons all the way into adulthood.  You passed exams, made 
achievements you can review all of those and at the same time get a sense 
of things happening in the back of your mind.   
 
All the while that hand is drifting all the way down to your lap, slowly and 
steadily as your recollections and mental review continues to take place.   
 
There’s nothing of importance for you to do right now other than notice 
whatever sensations arise, whatever thoughts and experiences, just noticing 
all the resources, the feelings, experiences, the insights and the life lessons 
you’ve had that have brought you to this point; the point at which you're

listening to this training and the power of self-hypnosis so you can make it 
work for you in your life.   
 
All these experiences have brought you to this place and that’s a good thing, 
because you can trust those experiences and all the things they mean or 
imply about your ability to succeed in the future.   
 
Allowing that hand to drift down at its own rate and pace, comfortably in its 
own way; you don’t have to know when it will reach that lap it will do so by 
itself. 
 
Now, feel free to continue doing this until that arm is resting on that lap.   
 
Step 3: Review Your Purpose Or Problem 
When that first arm reaches that lap, begin to think about your objective or 
a problem that you wish to resolve.  For the purpose of this particular 
experience, consider your objective of mastering the power of self-hypnosis.  
Get in touch with that.   
 
Get a sense of what it would be like to master the power of self-hypnosis.  A 
sense of the obstacles in the way and begin to review these in a fresh light 
already; because you get to review them in light of your past experiences 
and lessons, things you may not have considered before.   
 
Take time to allow that to happen.   
 
Step 4: Review Possibilities 
As you finish your review of your objective in mind the mastery of the power 
of self-hypnosis in your life, notice how that other arm wants to return down 
to your lap as well.   
 
As that arm begins the journey down to your lap you can review options, 
possibilities, new perceptions, insights, behaviors, all the things that can 
assist you in your journey towards mastering the power of self-hypnosis.   
 
As you review these things allow them to gently come to mind.  As that hand 
is descending to your lap really allow those possibilities, options all of those 
ideas to come to mind.  Review them as though you’ve never seen them 
before.  This is the first time you get to re-experience those.

Even if you’ve had those ideas before allow yourself to witness or notice 
them as though it was for the first time.  Perhaps there are some new ones 
you haven’t seen before, notice these things and be aware of what 
possibilities arise. 
 
What options you have available, what experiences you might try out, what 
things you could do and give yourself permission to have the full range of 
experiences without needing to evaluate, analyze, judge or anything else.  
Just notice what options and possibilities are available until that arm reaches 
your lap. 
 
Step 5: Choose A Behavior Or Action 
When that arm has reached your lap I’d like you to review what options and 
behaviors you have available to you.  Choose a simple behavior that you’d 
like to commit yourself to now.   
 
It might be a behavior, an insight or lesson that you wish to take with you 
back into your every day world, but choose something simple that you wish 
to now experiment with in the every day world a thought, idea, behavior or 
option and make it part of who you are.   
 
Step 6: Integrate Everything 
When you’ve chosen a simple behavior that you’d like to experiment with in 
the world outside, allow your eyes to drift closed, if they haven’t done so 
already.   
 
With your eyes closed, allow all that sense of experience to settle down 
inside your mind like a dream, beginning to find its own level, space, place 
to exist whilst your unconscious mind continues the process of finding 
solutions, options and possibilities to help you master the power of self-
hypnosis.   
 
You don’t need to know how it’s going to do it.  Get a sense of yourself filling 
up from the inside, a sense of everything working out, a sense that things 
are going on in the back of your mind and when you're ready, when you 
have a full sense of that, just allow your eyes to drift open, feeling 
refreshed, relaxed, alert and simply fantastic.

Bring yourself back to your normal every day sense of alertness with the 
sense of a simple activity, behavior task that you're going to engage in and 
experiment with in the outside world.  As soon as you’ve done that forget 
about this experience and enjoy the fact that you’ve done it.   
 
Step 7: Get On With Your Life! 
Let it go and get on with your life.  Don’t think about it too much.  Then join 
me over the next track where we dissect how to do the big drift.   
 
 
 
Track 11 – Sage 4: The BIG Drift 
Time: 11m 33s 
 
 
Welcome back again, that’s the big drift, you’ve gone through the seven 
stages of it and notice how you're combining elements that the other three 
stages have taught you how to do.   
 
Key Secret: Trust Your Unconscious 
The essence of the big drift is trusting your unconscious and creating a 
space, in which you can create more options and more possibilities so that 
your whole mind is primed towards finding better ways and options that get 
you to the place you want to go more quickly.   
 
Remember the reticular activating system that we mentioned on day one?   
 
This is going to prime and prepare it to find even more options so that when 
better ways of doing something comes up you just automatically decide that 
will be fun I’ll try that out.   
 
At that point you get the results you want more quickly than your conscious 
mind could ever plot or reason.  If you're going to do this for yourself feel 
free to use the recording to guide you through it.  Of course, the ultimate 
point will be where you just take yourself through this experience.

The 7 Stages Of The BIG Drift 
To do that is very simple.  There are seven stages.   
 
Step 1: Prepare Yourself 
The first step is to prepare yourself.   
 
Hands Up 
You prepare yourself by getting your hands into position,  
 
Relax 
loosening your elbows up so there is a freedom of movement there and 
beginning to get sensitivity in terms of how those hands are working.   
 
Sense 
Feel the temperature changes, lightness, warmth, coolness all that 
difference between one hand and the other and getting a sense of that 
sensitivity.   
 
Look At THOSE Hands 
It helps to look at those hands as if they are not your hands, which creates a 
mild sense of disassociation and gives the unconscious mind more freedom 
to take control of that arm.  
 
Each of those arms are going to guide you as the hypnotic pendulum does 
and let you know when your unconscious mind has finished doing a 
particular piece of work.   
 
So you want those elbows to be nice and loose and you want to get a sense 
of those hands wanting to return so that as it begins to happen, the rate and 
speed, at which your arms descends to your lap will be the rate and speed, 
at which your unconscious mind is doing the work, which is appropriate for 
that phase.

Step 2: Review Resources 
 
Allow An Arm To Lower Automatically 
Step two you then allow one of those hands to start descending.   
 
Review Life Lessons 
As that hand descends you want your unconscious mind to review all of your 
life lessons, all the things that have happened that brought you here, all the 
experiences and successes that you have.   
 
Basically, you're looking for resources, life lessons, abilities you have inside 
and strengths.   
 
Create A Problem Solving Context  
Here you’re creating the context, in which you're going to place the problem 
or outcome goal, so that you're contemplating now your objective in the 
success room rather than in the failure room and this sets the scene for 
success.   
 
Remember, as the hand drifts down these thoughts and ideas can arise 
spontaneously.  You don’t have to make any effort for this, just allow those 
thoughts to arise.  It’s all about the resources, the powerful moods, the 
pleasant emotions, achievements, life lessons and so on. 
 
Step 3: Review Your Purpose Or Problem 
Step three is quick; once that arm reaches the lap it activates your reason 
for being here.   
 
Just A Brief Review 
You're going to quickly review the objective or problem you want to solve.  
The key is not to stick in it for too long you're just setting it up enough for 
the possibility section in a moment to come.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         251
A Fresh Perspective 
The other thing to do is to start looking at the objective or problem in a 
fresh light.  Remember, you're now looking at that problem through new 
eyes, because you're going to have placed it inside the room where 
successes happen inside your mind.   
 
By doing so, you get to experience it in a slightly different way and that’s 
perfect, because it begins to set the parameters in, which the unconscious 
mind starts looking for solutions, successes rather than failures or problems.   
 
Once you’ve done that and it’s only a very brief moment of reviewing it and 
seeing that objective in a different light. 
 
Step 4: Review Possibilities 
Step four is to allow your second arm to descend, but only as slowly as you 
being to review possibilities or options available to you, new perceptions, 
new insights or instincts all as they relate towards that objective or problem 
that you wish to solve.   
 
The hand can make its own journey as your unconscious mind brings new 
ideas and thoughts to you.  Get absorbed in the activity of the arm and the 
ideas, options, insights, resources, possibilities and so on that come your 
way.   
 
Step 5: Choose A Behavior Or Action 
Step five is to give yourself a behavioral prescription. 
 
Choose A Simple Idea! 
Look at things that you can do, some simple activity, insight or lesson you 
can take with you into the every day world so you can start taking what’s on 
the inside and start acting on it.  You might find a little behavior or action 
that you’ll find easy to do. 
 
You might say to yourself  
 
I wonder what I want to experiment with.

Perhaps you’ll find yourself doing self-hypnosis on the train or tube on the 
way home.   
 
Perhaps you’ll find yourself curious about other ways, in which you can use 
the basic tools that we’ve outlined and create your own unique method.   
 
Perhaps you’ll find yourself deciding:  
 
I want to do this every morning and evening, sometimes sitting in bed or in 
a chair next to the bed, until I find the best place for me to do this and get 
the results that I want.   
 
I honestly don’t know what ideas come to your mind, but ideas will come.   
 
Choose a simple behavior or insight and take that with you.   
 
Step 6: Integrate Everything 
Next, if at this point you still haven’t closed your eyes just close your eyes 
and allow the integration to take place.   
 
Allow the thoughts, ideas and experiences to kind of settle down inside your 
mind until you get a feeling of being full.  That is the unconscious mind re-
arranging the pattern for you.  The important thing to realize is you want to 
take with you that simple activity. 
 
So during the integration stage allow things to settle down and make sure 
you focus on that simple activity or behavior you’ll take back with you at the 
end of it.  When you feel full, allow your eyelids to flutter open, come back 
feeling refreshed, relaxed, alert, simply fantastic and having a sense that 
you can experiment with your new behavior in many different ways.   
 
Step 7: Get On With Your Life! 
In step seven, when you're back outside just get on with your life.   
 
Don’t think too much about it.  Don’t try to make anything happen, just get 
on with your life and if an opportunity arises and you decide to go for it, just 
go for it and enjoy it.

Load The Odds 
Again, you’re trusting your unconscious mind to create opportunities then 
jump on them as you spot them.   
 
The key is to live your life, not to sit down watching TV and eating potato 
chips all the time, you want to get out there in life to give life an opportunity 
to offer you opportunities.   
 
As opportunities arise and you spot them, because your unconscious mind is 
now ready to find them and offer them up to your consciousness, take 
advantage of them.  Enjoy them, experiment with them.  See where they 
lead you and trust those gut instincts. 
 
Listen To Your Hunches & Intuitions! 
This method, the big drift above all others is one, in which you're going to 
start getting hunches, instincts, intuitions, seeing the same idea in many 
different places and you need to pay attention to that.   
 
If you find yourself leafing through magazines or reading newspaper reports 
and you keep coming back to the same company, same idea, same principle, 
same people doing similar sort of things that’s your unconscious mind saying 
pay attention this is something for you to pay attention to. 
 
 
Then bring that into the next equation and find out what can you do with it.  
Maybe it means you need to go on a holiday, try out a new thing, call up 
someone who knows about this stuff and ask questions about it.  Trust those 
hunches and instincts – it’s your unconscious mind in action. 
 
When your unconscious mind moves that’s a lot of power moving in your 
favor and that’s a very exciting place to be.  So that’s the big drift in a 
nutshell. Use it and enjoy it.   
 
Mix And Match 
Remember, as with the four sages and the four classic suggestion methods 
mix them up, use them together.

Sometimes you might start with one of the classic methods for example, a 
straight affirmation and maybe something comes up in the middle of it, at 
which point you might start going into the Emo-Streaming to burn through 
the negative associations.   
 
Start asking yourself: How will I be when I’ve achieved this goal?  How will I 
be?   
 
Then go through that emotion to the other end, when you get to the other 
end and you start feeling that sense of flow, trust and harmony you can go 
back to your affirmation saying that’s what it means to master the power of 
self-hypnosis.   
 
The Power Self-Hypnosis Method In Action 
This is exactly what I did, if you recall, when I was starting my own 
business.  I had no clue of what to do with it.  I was starting my affirmation 
suggestions.   
 
I have a healthy, successful business.   
 
Then I’d get all of these anxiety attacks or: “I don’t know what to do. I don’t 
know how to do it.  My time is running out.  My cash is running out.  I have 
no way of knowing how to advertise.  I’m wasting my money.  No one knows 
I exist.”   
 
As these classic gatekeeper patterns started arising I switched my focus to 
the Emo-Streaming and jumped straight to the end saying  
 
 How will I feel when I have this great business?   
 How will I be as a person?   
 
I kept focusing that question and suddenly the tension eased away and I 
went back to my affirmations.   
 
I have a healthy, successful business  
 
And at that point, the affirmations felt right and that's how I knew that I had 
beaten the dirty goal.  Of course, it was only a matter of time until a dirty 
goal came back again, but in a slightly weaker form so I did it again and 
again.

After a few weeks of this practice, I no longer needed any of the sages we 
were talking about.  I just needed to go straight for the affirmation, because 
my body knew what was happening.  I knew how it felt.  I knew what the 
outcome would be and I could keep a clean goal in mind without the 
assistance of all these extra techniques.   
 
At that point, I’d just sit down in my regular practice and get that outcome, 
the picture, the visualization, the affirmations and it all felt right.  The goals 
had been cleaned up.  There was no conflict at the unconscious level and I 
can honestly say I got everything that I wanted. 
 
The weird thing is I have no idea how I did it there was no conscious plan.  
In fact, all those around me kept saying you need to knuckle down and get 
yourself a plan, take a plan and stick to it.  I knew that’s not the way to do it 
for me I have to let my unconscious mind find the correct approach.   
 
I tried many different things.  I kept having a hunch about this and that, 
how to advertise, write copy and build a business.  I picked up business 
books; I read segments here then gave up on that book and picked up 
another.  Throughout that time I was building my knowledge, experience 
and experiments until I got to the point where everything I wanted came to 
pass.   
 
If it could work for me, especially considering the completely clueless stage I 
began with when going into business on my own then I know it will work for 
you.  Trust the four sages.  Trust the four classic suggestion patterns and 
use them in your whole life I’ll make such a big difference.

How can you sleep like a log any time, any place with distractions around 
you or not; irrelevant?   
 
No More Sleepless Nights! 
Since I learned this method and acquired this version of it, I’ve fallen asleep 
any time, any place anywhere.  On airplanes, airport lounges, hotel rooms, 
my home, even with loud noises, stress you name it and I’ve been able to 
sleep through it.   
 
In fact, my ability to sleep through things has since become legendary and I 
hope that yours will also.   
 
Sleepless Nights Are More Common Than You’d Think 
The first thing to realize is that sleep problems are surprisingly common and 
the solution to them is surprisingly simple.  Almost all types of insomnia are 
psychological, which means you don’t need to take drugs or go to the doctor 
to resolve those things.   
 
Why?   
 
Because you have the mechanism inside you already to be able to sleep like 
a log any time. 
 
Heed This Medical Warning! 
I will say this there are some forms of insomnia that are a telltale sign for 
some kind of medical condition.   
 
If you're using this method and still find trouble falling asleep, go see a 
medical doctor and have yourself checked out just in case you have one of 
these medical conditions – it’s the safe and rational thing to do. 
 
Say “Bye-Bye” To Sleeping Pills 
However, assuming you're in the vast majority of people who don’t have a 
medical condition then you can say goodbye to all forms of sleeping pills 
once you master the method I’m about to show you.

The Full Step By Step Method To Sleep Like A Log 
The method is very simple.  It has a couple of key components.   
 
Perfect Sleep Step 1: Prepare 
The first step is to lie in bed and prepare yourself to go to sleep.   
 
There’s something very important about what I just said.  Bed is for 
sleeping, nothing else, well maybe some other things, but we don’t want to 
talk about them on this program.   
 
Don’t Take Your Troubles To Sleep With You! 
The point about insomnia is that a lot of people take their troubles to bed.  
They go to bed and think about problems, future plans, anything, but falling 
asleep.   
 
Over time these things can turn into a pattern.  As soon as you lie down in 
bed, your mind starts racing, because it’s used to thinking about the future, 
even when you don’t even need to do it anymore.   
 
Bed Is For Sleeping 
So first realize that your bed is for sleeping.  When you want to plan things 
and think about the future, do it somewhere else.  Lie down or sit on a 
couch, get a yoga mat out and lie down on the floor. If you have to its okay 
to do that there, but your bed becomes a trigger for sleeping.   
 
This is very important.   
 
Why You Had To Sit Up For Self-Hypnosis 
This is also why I said to you before when practicing the self-hypnosis 
method, sit up, even if you stay in bed, sit up and change your position so 
your body knows that when you're lying down in bed it’s time to go to sleep; 
very important.

Perfect Sleep Step 2: Use Your Regular Power Self-Hypnosis Method 
The next stage is very simple and you already know how to do this it’s using 
the Power of Self-Hypnosis Method to put yourself into hypnosis, so you’ll be 
following the CAVE steps.   
 
PHS 1: Prepare 
At the beginning of it all, you're going to start with the parameters.   
 
Emergency Response 
You’ll say your safety statements –  
 
I’m about to use self-hypnosis to fall asleep. 
 
 
If any time during the night I find there’s an emergency that needs my 
attention, someone needs to have my attention or I need to do something 
like go to the toilet and take care of something like that then I’ll find myself 
instantly alert and ready to deal with whatever happens.   
 
When it’s time to go back to bed again afterwards, I’ll be able to drift back to 
sleep easily and naturally.   
 
Time Limit 
Secondly, you want to set a time limit or an intention.   
 
The intention is that you're going to go to sleep using the Power of Self-
Hypnosis Method.  You’ll sleep comfortably and easily through the night so 
that you awake in the morning refreshed, relaxed and totally alert and those 
are the set up parameters.   
 
PHS 2: Clear Your Mind 
Now you go ahead, close your eyes, take a deep breath, relax.  
 
PHS 3: ‘C’ (CAVE) Convincer 
get in touch with your arm and go through the whole convincer stage 
making your arm nice, warm and happy.

Perfect Sleep Step 3: Pay Attention To Relaxation & Comfort 
Here’s the key thing:   
 
Once your arm is deeply relaxed – it feels heavy maybe it’s got a warm 
glow, maybe there is a tingling – something like that, when you know that 
your arm is relaxed, I want you to pay attention to the rest of your body.   
 
Notice Bubbles Of Comfort Arising 
Notice if some part of the body has a kind of sympathetic response.  Notice 
if another bubble of comfort, relaxation, warm comfortable glow or comfort 
is arising inside of you.   
 
Focus On Anything Comfortable 
If it does, pay attention to that and watch that grow.  Once you have it 
there, wonder if there is another part of your body that has it also.   
 
Move From Comfort To Comfort  
Again, another sympathetic response so you keep jumping from one bubble 
of comfort or relaxation to the other.   
 
Perfect Sleep Step 4: Repeat The “Relaxation” Convincer 
If it happens that you don’t have a sympathetic response yet, not a big deal, 
just switch your attention to another part of your body and do the whole 
convincer cycle again.   
 
Switch Arms 
You might switch to your left arm and say  
 
My left arm is feeling relaxed.  My left arm is feeling relaxed, relaxing- 
relaxing- relaxing.   
 
Check For A Sympathetic Response 
Then, when you get the response in that arm, check out your body is there a 
sympathetic response?

What part of your body is feeling comfortable or relaxed and place your 
attention on that.   
 
Perfect Sleep Step 5: Allow The Drifting To Lull You To Sleep 
Essentially, you'll keep doing this until the point where you’ll naturally find 
your mind beginning to want to drift off.   
 
Notice The Comfort Drawing You In 
You might notice a warm, comfortable blanket or relaxation spreads all over 
you and that’s when the sleep period starts.  You're getting sucked into that 
warm whirlpool that will draw you into sleep.   
 
Allow It To Happen 
When that happens just allow it.  Drift all the way into sleep time and sleep 
comfortably throughout the night.   
 
How To Troubleshoot Any Problems With The Perfect Sleep Method 
Here are a couple of rules or ideas to keep in mind in case things don’t go 
quite the way you intended.   
 
Sleep Key 1: Focus On Relaxation 
The rule of thumb is for you to cycle through the body using the convincers 
to relax different parts of the body.  Notice if you have a sympathetic 
response in a different part of the body and keep bouncing from those 
bubbles of comfort and relaxation until the drifting occurs naturally. 
 
Sleep Key 2: Don’t Think Thoughts 
When it does, great, allow it to occur.  The key is that you want to make 
sure that you're not thinking thoughts, you're not thinking about plans, 
future activities and above all else you don’t want to be thinking about 
problems.

Sleep Key 3: Beat Distractions By Focusing On Relaxation 
If you find yourself going down that route as part of your drifting, go right 
back again to your body and use the convincer cycles again.   
 
Let’s say your arms are both relaxed and you’ve gone into this comfortable 
dream spin, but then suddenly you start thinking about a project tomorrow.   
 
At that point break your attention from the project and think about your 
right leg.  Now use the convincer cycle on the right leg.  After that you could 
use: 
 
 My right leg is relaxing-relaxing-relaxing.   
 Breathing is relaxing.   
 My left leg is relaxing.   
 Face, tongue, eyes are relaxing.   
 
There are so many parts of your body that you can run the convincer cycle 
on eventually you’ll just drift into a comfortable, easy, natural sleep.   
 
Sleep Key 4: Trust Your Unconscious! 
If you're one of the people that wants to control the process and make it 
happen that’s part of the reason why you're not falling asleep, because your 
conscious mind has no idea how to fall asleep.  It doesn't do it – that’s 
purely the domain of your unconscious mind; you’ve got to trust it to allow it 
to happen. 
 
Here’s a great way to make it happen.   
 
Inner Secret: Try & Fail 
When your body is in this warm comfortable glow of relaxation, comfort and 
inner peace, try hard to stay awake.   
 
When I say try hard to stay awake, I don’t mean sit up and pinch yourself, 
think thoughts, do math puzzles or that sort of thing.  No! 
 
The key thing is to maintain the same quality of comfort and relaxation and 
see if you can hold on to awareness even then.  At that point one of two 
things will happen.

 Number one is your unconscious mind takes over and says “you’re 
going to sleep whether you like it or not” and you just fall asleep.  You 
don’t even know it until you wake up refreshed the next day.   
 
 The other thing that might happen is it will seem like you're not falling 
asleep you're just lying there in bed in a very comfortable glow without 
thinking any particular thoughts, but it seems like you're still 
consciously active in some ways.   
 
The fact is you won’t be.  Your mind will naturally drag you into sleep 
spindles and dreams and so on.  It’s just that those periods will be cut off 
from your consciousness, which is one of the quirky things of how your mind 
works.   
 
Trust the fact that you can just lie there without any particular thoughts, as 
long as you feel that comfortable glow inside your body, that ease of 
relaxation or that inner peace, it doesn't matter whether or not your 
conscious mind thinks you're asleep.   
 
The fact is you will be drifting in and out of sleep enough to be totally 
refreshed and once you’ve done that your unconscious mind gets the hint 
and goes  
 
“Okay buddy, tomorrow we're just going to take you right into sleep, 
because that’s where you need to be.”   
 
Sleep Key 5: Go Back To The “Relaxation” Convincer 
Remember, if at any stage you get some kind of distracting thought for 
example, you start planning something, thinking of a problem or anything 
that makes you feel uncomfortable, go right back to your convincer cycle.   
 
 Left arm feeling heavy,  
 left leg feeling heavy,  
 lungs easing,  
 breathing coming easy and rhythmically,  
 heartbeat rhythmical…  
 
all of these things.

Step 4: Repeat The “Relaxation” Convincer – IF Necessary 
Find another part of comfort and let that grow.   
Step 5: Allow The Drifting To Lull You To Sleep 
Keep tracing them.  Jumping as though you are jumping from lily pad to lily 
pad until eventually your whole body is in a glow and you’ll end up drifting in 
a deep, comfortable sleep, sleeping through the whole night.   
 
We’ve talked about this.  On the next track we’ll go through a quick five-
minute procedure to install this pattern inside you at the unconscious level.  
As soon as you're ready to do that join me again on the next track.   
 
 
Track 4 – Exercise: The Perfect Sleep Method 
Time: 6m 46s 
 
 
Welcome back.   
 
We're only going to install the ability to sleep like a log right now using the 
Power of Self-Hypnosis Method we're not going to guide you into sleep yet.   
 
The Power Self-Hypnosis Process 
Find a comfortable sitting position and when you're ready take a deep 
breath.  Breathe out, relax, clear your mind and close your eyes.   
 
Then as you’ve done before, just focus on your right arm.  Tell your right 
arm to relax.   
 
The right arm is relaxing- relaxing- relaxing.   
 
Feel the right arm relaxing- relaxing- relaxing.   
 
Sense the right arm relaxing.  Loose, limp like a rag doll, relaxing, heavy 
and comfortable.   
 
Now, at your state of self-hypnosis, it’s time for you to realize that you can 
sleep like a log any time you wish to.  To sleep like a log is very simple.  The 
procedure is easy.

Step 1: Prepare 
At night, when it’s time for you to go to sleep you’ll take care of all the 
normal business, wash, get into your nightclothes, lie down in bed, turn off 
the lights and then lie comfortably in bed.   
 
Once you’re lying comfortably in bed, all you need to do is remind yourself 
why you're here.  You're going to use the Power of Self-Hypnosis Method to 
fall asleep.  You’ll sleep deeply and comfortably all night long, you’ll awaken 
refreshed and alert in the morning.   
 
If at any time during the night sleep something should require your attention 
outside.  For example, someone needs your attention, there is an emergency 
or there is a bodily function you need to take care of, then you will instantly 
become alert and refreshed.   
 
You will deal with whatever situation needs your attention effectively and 
efficiently.  When it’s time to go back to bed you’ll drift into sleep instantly 
and awake in the morning feeling refreshed.   
 
Step 2: Use Your Regular Power Self-Hypnosis Method 
Now it’s time for you to go through a CAVE cycle.  Get in touch with the right 
arm and relax the right arm in exactly the same way you’ve done now.   
 
Step 3: Pay Attention To Relaxation & Comfort 
Once that right arm is relaxed scan your body and you’ll find that parts of 
your body have sympathetically aroused comfort, relaxation, easy, inner 
peaceful feelings.   
 
Focus on that part of your body and those feelings will grow.   
 
Next, find another part of your body.  Scan from the top of your head to the 
tips of your toes and find another part of your body that feels comfortable, 
calm, relaxed, a sense of inner peace.   
 
As you find that part of your body, focus on that and watch that grow, enjoy 
it.

Keep moving from area of comfort to area of comfort until your mind 
naturally drifts off to sleep.   
 
Step 4: Repeat The “Relaxation” Convincer – IF Necessary 
If at any stage you have any distracting thought or cessation, simply go 
back to the convincer cycle.   
 
 Left arm is relaxing.   
 Left leg is relaxing.   
 Right leg is relaxing.   
 My breathing is calm and easy.   
 My eyes are relaxing,  
 Tongue is relaxing,  
 Throat is relaxing,  
 Left shoulder relaxing 
 Right shoulder relaxing.   
 
You can relax so many different parts of your body.   
 
Any time you have a distracting thought or idea simply go back to the 
convincer cycle then right back to finding sympathetic comfort and letting 
that guide your way like stepping stones towards a comfortable, natural 
night’s sleep. 
 
Step 5: Allow The Drifting To Lull You To Sleep 
Using the power of self-hypnosis you will easily drift off to sleep every night.  
No matter what the stresses and strains of the outside world, you’ll easily 
and comfortably fall asleep every night using the Power of Self-Hypnosis 
Method.   
 
You can trust that.  The more you use it when you don’t need to, the more 
powerfully the skill will be available to you when you do, so you may as well 
practice it every night.   
 
Your quality of sleep will go up.  You’ll be able to sleep deeper and more 
comfortably.  You’ll awaken more alert and more refreshed and you’ll 
deepen your connection of trust with your unconscious.

It simply makes sense to practice the Power of Self-Hypnosis Method to 
sleep like a log every single night and enjoy it.   
 
Go ahead and allow your mind to drift for a while as your unconscious mind 
takes these ideas on board and makes sleeping like a log, sleeping 
comfortably and deeply every night a natural part of your experience; very 
good. 
 
Now it’s time for you to return. Mentally count yourself up from one to five.   
 
 At the count of three remember getting back in touch with your body.   
 At the count of four you're beginning to stretch again.   
 At the count of five open your eyes feeling refreshed, relaxed and 
alert. 
 
Simply fantastic, knowing that tonight when you use this method for the 
very first time you're going to have the best night of sleep you’ve had in a 
very long time and you get to look forward to that.  When you're ready join 
me on the next track.   
 
 
Track 5 – The Inner Wake Up Call 
Time: 7m 08s 
 
 
Welcome back again.   
 
Now that you’ve installed the ability to sleep like a log any time, any place 
anywhere, I encourage you to use it a lot.  The more you use it, the easier it 
becomes and it will be there for you when you need it.   
 
For now, I’d like to show you another ability that you have, another hidden 
potential that lies dormant inside each one of us and very few people ever 
activate.   
 
Activate Your Inner Clock 
This is the inner clock; what I call the ‘inner wake up call’.

How would you like to have the ability to have an inner wake up call that 
wakes you up at exactly the time you need to awaken and not before or 
after, but exactly the time you need to awaken?   
 
Not only does it do this, it does it easily and comfortably so you awaken 
refreshed and alert.  No more drowsy, switching the radio on snooze.  You’ll 
awaken instantly, easily and totally naturally.   
 
This relies on the ability or the natural biological clock that each of us has.  
Technically speaking, you’ve actually been practicing and rehearsing that 
inner biological clock for the last few days already.   
 
After all, every time you set the parameters, in a moment I’m going to go 
into hypnosis for five, seven or ten minutes, you're training that inner clock 
over a short period of time.   
 
The Inner Wake Up Call 
Now we're going to use that same function.  We're going to sleep through 
the whole night and awaken every single time.  Since I started using the 
inner wake up call, I’ve stopped wearing a watch or using an alarm clock.   
 
In fact, I think I’ve only ever used an alarm clock five times in the last 10 or 
15 years and that was only because it was such an important meeting that I 
didn't want to risk not making it.   
 
Even then I found myself waking up about a minute before the alarm was 
set to go off and I woke up totally naturally and easily.  I switched the alarm 
off before it started to alarm me! 
 
So we're going to use this natural function so that you can do that for 
yourself.   
 
Seasonal Affective Disorder 
If you happen to be suffering from something called Seasonal Affective 
Disorder (SAD), this will take care of a lot of that just because your 
biological clock will begin adjusting itself to waking up naturally and in the 
right state of mind.

However, if you wish to ease this transition and make it even easier for you 
to wake up in the mornings, you may also want to investigate the use of 
special lights, which have a stronger light quotient, because part of how the 
mind wakes up in the morning is in response to light it’s just part of the way 
the brain responds in sleep and waking cycles.   
 
So if you have to wake up, it’s dark outside and you have trouble waking up, 
then do investigate special lamps and lights, which will help with that 
process.   
 
Know that in time, using self-hypnosis will also help you to transition into 
the waking state in the mornings even if it’s a very early wake up call and 
it’s still dark outside, so use everything at your disposal to make your life 
easier and more successful.

Now, let’s focus on the actual method.  You're going to use this method in 
combination with the sleeping like a log method.   
 
Why?   
 
Because you're going to be using this immediately before going to sleep so 
that idea primes you into the whole sleep state.   
 
Step 1: Start With The Perfect Sleep Method 
You're going to be lying in bed comfortably, putting all of your ideas outside 
of your mind, then as soon as you're ready to fall asleep close your eyes, 
take a deep breath, relax, clear your mind and tell yourself what you're 
going to do just like in the sleep method.   
 
Step 2: Imagine A Clock 
This time, once you get into the convincer cycle, before you get into the 
regular sleep pattern, when you jump from sympathetic moment of comfort 
to another one and let that moment grow; before you get to that stage, 
right after you’ve gone through your convincer cycle on your right arm, I’d 
like you to picture an alarm, bedside clock, wrist watch anything that tells 
time.

Step 3: Make Sure It Has The Current Time On It 
This time device will be telling the time as it currently is or was as you went 
to bed.  Let’s say you're going to bed at 10:00 pm.  You create that inner 
space, go through the convincer cycle and maybe a minute or so has past, 
so you look at that inner clock and you’ll see it being 10:01.   
 
Step 4: Set The Inner Clock To Your Wake Up Time 
Mentally, change the time on the clock to the time that you wish to wake up.  
Let’s say its 7:00 am the next day.  You just click the clock through until its 
7:00 am.  
 
Step 5: Affirm The Wake Up Call 
Then you start affirming to yourself  
 
This is the time I want to wake up.  This is the time I will wake up.  I’m 
going to wake up at 7:00 am tomorrow feeling refreshed and alert.   
 
Now you’ve set the time.   
 
Step 6: End With The Perfect Sleep Method 
You’ve seen the clock, affirmed it, gone through a couple of cycles of 
affirmation and now it’s time to hand it over to the unconscious mind, go 
through the regular sleep cycle to fall deeply and comfortably asleep.   
 
At that point you’ll awake in the morning.   
 
How To Adjust The Inner Clock 
In the same way as you trained your inner clock to be responsive to five and 
ten minute increments during the self-hypnosis practice that you’ve had, 
you're going to do the same thing in the morning.   
 
Notice The Real Time 
When you wake up check your alarm clock and see what time it is.  If it’s 
7:05 notice it.  If it’s 5:55 notice that.  Go back to sleep again of course and 
come back a second time.

If its 6:55 notice its 6:55 and feel free to get up at that point.   
 
Get Up When Its Time 
If you're within ten or 15 minutes of your target, simply get up, notice the 
time and know that the next time it will get closer and will be easier for you 
to get closer to the target time.   
 
Then get up, go about your business, your day and repeat the cycle again in 
the evening.   
 
Overview Of The Inner Wake Up Call 
Let’s say you go to bed at 10:00 pm, see that clock, 10:00 pm.  Move the 
clock forward to 7:00 am.  Say  
 
This time I’m going to wake up at 7:00 am.  This is the time I want to wake 
up.  This is when I will wake up and it’s going to happen.   
 
Then drift off to sleep using the natural sleep method that we discussed in 
the previous track and off you go it’s as simple as that.   
 
How To Install The Inner Wake Up Call 
On the next track we’ll go through another little hypnotic process to set your 
internal clock and install the inner wake up call so you can use it any time 
you want or need to.   
 
I recommend that you practice this on the weekends first just in case you 
overshoot your time a little bit.  As a rule you’ll want to not use an alarm 
clock so your unconscious mind knows you're up against it.  You haven’t got 
a fall back option for it to get lazy and say the alarm is going to go off 
anyway so I may as well let him do it.   
 
Make sure that you put yourself in a position where your unconscious mind 
goes  
 
Okay, this guy is serious I’m going to have to give him what he wants  
 
It’s just an easy way of doing it.

So as soon as you're ready, jump on to the next track where we’ll take you 
through a little process to install the inner wake up call; ready at your 
command.   
 
 
Track 6 – Exercise: The Inner Wake Up Call 
Time: 5m 36s 
 
 
Begin With The Power Self-Hypnosis Process 
Begin this process by sitting somewhere comfortably.  As soon as you're 
sitting comfortably take a deep breath.  Breathe out, relax, close your eyes 
and clear your mind. 
 
Now focus on your right arm and relax your right arm.  Feel your right arm 
relaxing.  Affirm my right arm is relaxing- relaxing- relaxing.  Feel your right 
arm relax.  Feel it grow loose, limp, heavy, comfortable like the arm of a rag 
doll or a wet dishcloth, loose, limp and relaxed; very good. 
 
Now, you have an internal clock and you’ve been using it throughout this 
program.  It’s time that you learned to use that internal clock to set your 
inner wake up call. From this day forward, you’ll be able to wake up 
anytime, any place anywhere easily and effectively by trusting the power of 
your unconscious mind to awaken you at the right time every time.   
 
Step 1: Start With The Perfect Sleep Method 
In order to use the inner wake up call, very simply put yourself to bed, clear 
your mind and focus on your right arm relaxing as you would do for any 
other hypnotic process.   
 
Step 2: Imagine A Clock 
Once you're comfortably relaxed, mentally picture some kind of clock or time 
device.   
Step 3: Make Sure It Has The Current Time On It 
The time on the device will be the time that you went to bed.  See that time.

Step 4: Set The Inner Clock To Your Wake Up Time 
And mentally change the time to the time that you wish to get up in the 
morning.   
 
Step 5: Affirm The Wake Up Call 
When you set the time you wish to get up, affirm to yourself,  
 
This is the time I want to get up.  This is the time I will get up.  My 
unconscious mind will awaken me comfortably, easily, feeling refreshed and 
alert at this time in the morning.   
 
Step 6: End With The Perfect Sleep Method 
Once you have done this process, simply allow yourself to find an area of 
comfort in the body and focus on that.  Now you can continue with your 
natural sleep cycles as you’ve learned before.   
 
You have an inner alarm clock, an inner wakeup call that can awaken you 
gently and easily every time, so you awaken refreshed, relaxed and alert.  
You don’t need to introduce stress into your life through an alarm clock.  You 
simply trust the inner wake up call and it will do the work for you.   
 
Then, once you’ve set the inner wake up call simply allow yourself to drift off 
to sleep using the natural sleep method you already know.  You’ll sleep 
deeply and comfortably.   
 
If, at any point in time, something outside requires your attention, someone 
is calling you, some emergency requires your attention or a bodily function 
needs to be taken care of, you will of course, awaken easily and naturally.  
Then when it’s time to go back to bed you’ll drift instantly back to sleep and 
you will still awaken at the time you set for yourself in the morning.   
 
In the morning when you awaken, simply check your normal clock, your 
outside real world clock and see what time it is.  If you over or under shot a 
little bit that’s fine that will correct itself as the days turn into weeks.  
Eventually, you’ll wake up exactly on the minute every time whenever you 
want or need to.

Now allow yourself to drift into comfort, allowing whatever scenes or 
experiences that come to mind, to come to mind.  Feel good as your inner 
mind, your unconscious internalizes your inner wake up call and makes it 
accessible to you whenever you want to use it.   
 
I’ll be silent as you do that now.  When you hear my voice next you’ll simply 
find yourself drifting back; very good.  Now it’s time for you to count 
yourself back out again, remembering to count from one to five.   
 
 At the count of three, reorient your body.   
 At the count of four, start stretching and moving around.   
 At the count of five, you're going to open your eyes feeling refreshed, 
relaxed, alert and simply fantastic, knowing that you just activated a 
very powerful inner device.   
 
Your inner wake up call will be there for you for the rest of your life 
whenever you need to use it so use it well.  Use it every day and the more 
you use it the more you’ll know that you can rely on it when you want it.   
 
 
Track 7 – How To Change A Habit With The Power Of Self-Hypnosis 
Time: 9m 29s 
 
 
Welcome back again.   
 
Now you have two interesting methods of activating unconscious abilities 
that a lot of people don’t realize they have.   
 
The Power Self-Hypnosis Method Is Perfect For Habits 
I want to talk a little bit about changing habits.  One of the primary reasons 
that you came to this program is, chances are, you want to change some 
habits you want to get rid of some bad habits and install some good habits.   
 
The Power of Self-Hypnosis Method is designed to do precisely that and this 
is what it excels in.

Overwrite Old Habits 
How are you going to change a habit?   
 
You're basically going to overlay the new and healthy habit over the old one.  
You're going to tell the unconscious mind once what you don’t want and then 
focus on what you do want and stick to that.   
 
Use The CAVE Cycle  
You're going to use the CAVE cycle and during the ‘AV’ stage, the 
actualization and visualization stage, you're going to affirm the new habit 
and visualize the new habit. It’s like the rehearsal method.  In fact, 
remember using the visualizations for rehearsals?   
 
That’s installing a new habit, the habit of moving correctly in a golf game, 
the habit of speaking correctly during a presentation or the habit of treating 
people in a certain way when you're interacting with them, so basically, 
you’ve been doing throughout the course of this program.   
 
Here are the steps. 
 
The Step By Step Guide For Changing A Habit  
 
Step 1: Clear Your Mind 
As before, simply clear your mind, take a deep breath and relax.   
 
Step 2: ‘C’ (CAVE) Convincer 
Then connect to your arm.  Go through the convincer cycle or the CAVE 
cycle until you’ve got that sense of the arm being comfortably heavy, 
relaxed, loose and limp, whatever it is.   
 
Step 3: ‘AV’ (CAVE) Change The Habit 
Once you have that, then you go into the ‘AV’ stage and here it’s time for 
you to change your habit.

The first step is to tell your unconscious mind, this is the habit I want to 
change or install.  If you have a negative habit, go with a change.  If there’s 
no habit in place and you want to put in a good habit then go straight to the 
good habit.   
 
Tell your unconscious mind this is the habit that I want or this is the habit I 
no longer want.  Then tell yourself this is the habit I want to have instead.  
Put yourself in the context where you want it.   
 
Examples Of What To Change 
If you to go to the gym there are two contexts   
 
 One is being at home deciding to go to the gym in other words, the 
habit of being excited about it.   
 
 Secondly, actually being in the gym, being glad you came, having had 
a good workout and so on.   
 
So there are several habits in place.   
 
If you know the behavior that you want, for example, going to the gym and 
working out, great then go through the behavior, rehearse that and install it 
that way.   
 
Make sure that your affirmation says you will be using this habit every day, 
it becomes a natural part of you, you’re doing it without thinking about it it’s 
just part of how you respond to life and that sort of thing. 
 
Troubleshooting: What If You Don’t Know What To Replace It With? 
What do you do if you don’t know what the behavior is?   
 
What if you know you want a good habit, but you don’t know what the habit 
is?   
 
Let’s say you do want to go to the gym, but you honestly have no idea how 
to go to the gym.   
 
Millions of people are like that, I’m like that.  I don’t know what to do in a 
gym.  I get lost with all that equipment.

You can either train yourself or hire a private coach to teach you some of the 
basics so you're doing it well, definitely worthwhile or you can leave it up to 
your unconscious mind to find the right solutions for you.   
 
An Example Of The Indirect Approach To Problem Solving 
It was particularly important in certain examples like I had when I was 
setting up my business.  I wanted to put in good business habits, but I didn't 
know the first things about how to run a business.  I didn't know how to 
advertise, talk to people, tell them about what I do – all of those things were 
new to me, because I never had to do it before.   
 
Therefore, I had to go to the outcome.   
 
Remember, you can either rehearse the habit or you can jump to the 
outcome.  At that point, I knew I didn't know enough about business to 
rehearse any particularly good habits.  In fact, I might end up installing bad 
habits as a result. So I just went to the outcome.   
 
The outcome was having a healthy, thriving business where my clients love 
me, where I’m earning well and I get to have all the things I want to have 
out of life.  I get to travel.  I get to work with smart people.  I get to work at 
the cutting edge of a particular discipline and so on.   
 
Step 4: Go To The Happy Ending 
Once you’ve rehearsed the habit, set the outcome and affirmed it all. 
 
Step 5: ‘E’ (CAVE) Drift 
Remember to allow a drifting stage to occur, just as you did in the last few 
exercises today.   
 
The drifting stage gives your unconscious mind time to integrate the 
learnings and lessons, making it part of who you are before you reach 
regular consciousness again.   
 
It’s like a barrier between your unconscious and conscious mind so that 
when you come back outside you can’t interfere with it too much, because

the pattern is already rolling.  The scene has already been set and your 
unconscious machinery is working on the case for you and that’s it. 
 
Resolve Dirty Goals 
Remember, all the things we’ve talked about so far are part of how to set a 
behavior.  If you end up having a dirty goal, remember a dirty goal is when 
there’s a conflict between what your unconscious mind wants or thinks and 
what your conscious mind wants or thinks.   
 
If there’s a conflict like that you need to do something to overcome the 
conflict.  How do you do that?   
 
That’s what we’ve talking about for the last few days.  You either use the 
power pendulum method and find the root cause of the conflict and resolve 
that or you use the four sages and use that to burn off any excess energy 
that the conflict might have.   
 
You burn through the objection the unconscious mind has by getting the 
unconscious mind to come up with better ways.  You ask loaded questions 
using hypnotic questions and you go through the experience of having the 
result rather than just visualizing it getting the energy element of it using 
the Emo-Streaming and you can use the big drift.   
 
The big drift is a winner all around. 
 
The Real Secret Behind The Tortoise Mind! 
The key thing is let your internals align to it and allow the tortoise mind time 
to do its work.  Why do I keep saying the smart money is on the tortoise?   
 
Let me reveal it to you now.   
 
Use The Power Of Your Parallel Processor 
One of the things that happens with self-hypnosis and one of the things 
you’ll notice happening is that as you work on one goal, because that 
objective is tied up to all kinds of other different things, you’ll end up 
invariably resolving a bunch of issues at the same time without even 
realizing it.

Sure, it can happen that you set a simple goal, you internalize it, you use 
your self-hypnosis, it gets achieved and that’s it, nothing else changes 
except for that thing.    
 
Resolve A Whole Web Of Related Issues 
More often what will happen, especially when you use these methods, 
particularly the four sages, when you allow that drifting stage to occur and 
other things like that at that point your unconscious mind starts finding 
other possibilities, other connected areas and it cleans those up at the same 
time. 
 
The Tortoise May Seem Slower – But Its Pulling A Lot More Weight! 
The tortoise might seem to be a lot slower, but it’s actually carrying a lot 
more weight.  So by the time it crosses the finishing line you get so much 
more than you bargained for, so many more good things come your way 
than you actually thought in the first place. 
 
The reason this is important is because now you have a whole support 
structure to support your new habit or behavior.   
 
The New Habits Will Fit Your Life! 
Let’s imagine the gym example again.  If it’s going to the gym, if it doesn't 
fit your lifestyle you're going to have a struggle each time.  You'll have to 
fight for it and go to the gym, find some time for it.   
 
You might be drained and exhausted, because your job is taking too much 
attention from you, you might not be eating right and don’t have enough 
energy for the gym, but you're going to the gym so you have your behavior 
there, but you're not getting the goal.   
 
Remember, the goal for going to the gym is to live a healthier lifestyle.   
 
If you go to the end energy for example, using emo-streaming, if you're 
using these techniques as part of the process, especially if you just use 
normal affirmations of the goal or behavior plus that drifting stage.   
 
During that drifting stage, your unconscious mind looks at the totality of 
your life and says, hang on.  If you want to go to the gym and be healthy,

vibrant, strong and all of that stuff then there are going to be some other 
changes you need as well.   
 
Let Your Unconscious Mind Work Out The Details 
The rest of his life has to be there too. So he’s going to have to eat better as 
well so he has energy to go to the gym.  He has to be able to manage his 
time better so he’s not stressed out at work and doesn't lose all of his 
energy just worrying and stressing out at work.   
 
It probably helps if he can work around his friends and social life in such a 
way that he’s got time to go to the gym.  Let’s deal with all of these things 
tweaking them at the same time, so by the time he ends up going to the 
gym naturally, everything else is in place all of his ducks are in a row.   
 
His friends are supportive of it.  He’s got time to socialize and go to the gym.  
He’s eating well so he’s got plenty of energy.  He’s more relaxed at work, so 
when he comes home he’s not totally drained so he has more energy to go 
to the gym again.   
 
All these things are in place at the same time.   
 
That is the true secret to trusting the tortoise mind and putting your money 
on that.   
 
Allow Solutions To Grow Like Guests At A Party 
It’s a beautiful thing when it happens because now, if I’m being obsessed 
about all this long list of goals that you want to deal with you end up dealing 
with one and you’ll know that a lot of these other things get pulled along in 
its wake.   
 
They’ll come along with it so by the time you end up doing one goal you 
might find yourself having succeeded in a half dozen, even a dozen other 
areas of your life that you hadn’t even considered yet or that you were going 
to wait for later to deal with, but now you don’t have to.   
 
This is the beautiful of trusting the tortoise mind; go with it.   
 
You have the tools for it and you can have that interaction between the 
classic methods, which will prime the pump and get things going and the

four sages, which get that open expansive, general change to fit the whole 
of your life so that the changes you make don’t come out of context.   
 
It’s an important piece and the reward is simply fantastic.   
 
 
Track 8 – How To Solve Problems With The Power Of Self-Hypnosis 
Time: 18m 38s 
 
 
Let’s move on to solving problems.   
 
The other reason why people come to self-hypnosis is, because they have a 
problem and don’t know how to resolve it.   
 
Learn From The Scientists 
How do you resolve problems?   
 
We're going to take a leaf out of the book of scientists, the Nobel Prize 
winners who solved amazing problems using the power of their unconscious.   
 
Problem Solving Principles 
There are a couple of key principles involved in the problem solving cycle.   
 
Principle 1: Fill Your Mind 
1. You are going to actually spend some time thinking about a problem 
so it’s in your mind, your intellect, you're creating connections and 
you're getting your unconscious mind to realize that this is something 
you want to deal with.  
 
2. You must understand the nature of the unconscious.   
 
Principle 2: Solve The Problem In Context 
In other words, allow the unconscious mind time to start picking the pieces, 
gathering tools and information so that the problem gets solved its

wholeness, its totality.  You never solve just one problem you solve the 
whole problem in context. 
 
When Einstein had the dream of riding a beam of light it basically suggested 
a stream of mathematics that he ended up spending the next two years 
trying to come up with to prove that his idea was correct.   
 
His unconscious mind had done the work ahead of time it made the intuitive 
leap, but it still had to have that build up time afterwards to prove it.  It’s an 
important stage before having the dream, he had to fill his mind and think 
about it so his unconscious mind starts building up some response potential. 
 
 
Principle 3: Use The Power Of ASP 
This is one of the most crucial and important things you need to ever know 
about problem solving.  If you don’t do this, then problems will remain 
problems.  If you do this, whether or not you use the power of self-hypnosis 
to help augment the problem solving cycle, you’ll still solve problems quickly 
and easily.   
 
This is the Access State Principle.   
 
Remember, when we talked about, I think all the way on day one, how the 
mind has certain room.  Each room is a certain room and a certain state and 
your experiences and memories are encoded within that room.   
 
You have a problem solving room, a room where you come up with options 
and possibilities and things you can do is not the room you're in when you're 
depressed, stressed and unhappy.   
 
I take that back.   
 
A mild amount of stress can be a useful room to be in. However, large 
amounts of stress shuts doors to potential, to options and that’s the last 
thing you want.   
 
 You’ve got to pay attention to what state you're in.   
 You’ve got to let your mind think about it so you're priming the pump 
so to speak, and

 You have to find a mechanism for handing over to the unconscious the 
responsibility for coming up with some ideas then for presenting those 
ideas back to you. 
 
How The Problem Solving Cycle Saved My Legal Career  
I’d like to tell you a story of how I used this problem solving cycle to save 
my career.   
 
Back in the days when I was still a lawyer there was a transaction I had to 
deal with, which was a straightforward thing.  There was a bank that was 
handing over all of its responsibilities to another company.  There were some 
hundred or so documents that had to be executed to document the whole 
handing over of power and responsibilities, incomes and all that sort of stuff.   
 
These documents each had between two and about eight or nine different 
people and institutions that had to sign to legalize to allow that whole 
handing over of power to occur.  Every one of those documents had a unique 
little problem or quirk that I had to solve and it took a lot of my attention. 
 
All except for two; two of these document were so plain vanilla, I had them 
done within 20 minutes ready to roll, printed up on my desk ready to do 
their thing.  The others took more of my time, because there was always 
some special nuance, law clause or something else going on, but you don’t 
need to know the technicalities.   
 
To cut a long story short, a month rolls by, it’s now time to sign and execute 
these documents to allow the whole handing over of power and 
responsibilities to occur.  We’re at the client’s company, there are some 
dozen people in the room, there are hundreds of documents, because for 
each document you need a copy for each person signing. 
 
So of the hundred or so documents, we’ve probably got about 800, because 
we have copies for every signature and so on it was a lot of copies.  I had to 
managed the whole process flawlessly.   
 
I’m like the orchestra conductor telling people “Okay, you all walk around 
this way, sign here, different color tabs are for different people signing 
things.”

I’m making sure everyone is signing the documents.  Meanwhile, we have 
people sending in faxed signatures from overseas. 
 
It’s all working beautifully.  Faxing is going for the documents to testify that 
it’s being signed and that’s going to be bound later on– beautiful.   
 
There was BIG Trouble! 
Until suddenly, I have a sinking feeling in my stomach.  I have a sudden 
realization that I’ve completely forgotten about those two documents that 
were a no-brainer at the start of the deal.   
 
The client could sign them, because the client was right in front of me, but 
the other person, someone called the trustee wasn’t there, had never been 
queued up, had never been asked about this whole process and hadn’t even 
given permission to the whole thing.   
 
I had a sinking feeling, because I just didn't have enough time to get him to 
sign it now.   
 
I got the signatures all ready.   
 
I rushed back to the office called the trustee and said,  
 
“Look there are these two documents this is what’s happened could you 
please spend the next half hour looking at them and sign it, because if we 
don’t execute this by the end of the day there is going to be big trouble.” 
 
Guess what?   
 
There was big trouble.   
 
They refused to sign them on a technicality.  They were correct to refuse to 
sign them by the way.  They had to get legal advice before they could sign 
them and it was the correct thing to do from their part, it just didn't help me 
very much. 
 
We Are About To Get Sued For Hundreds Of Millions Of Dollars! 
Now we have the entire deal falling on its ear, because one signature is 
missing from two documents and it’s my fault.

This thing starts going ballistic.  I go to my supervisor my supervisor ended 
up had to go to the head of the department, the head of the department 
ends up pulling out his liability insurance. 
 
Although it’s a small mistake there are hundreds of millions in the balance 
and I felt about two inches high.  I wished the ground would open up and 
swallow me, it was a huge mess. 
 
I Feel Like The Lowest Of The Low! 
We survive that day and work until 9:00 or 10:00 in the evening.  I make 
my way home and I’m feeling miserable.  I’m feeling guilty.  I feel like a 
failure and the whole thing is still up in the air there’s still an almighty mess. 
 
My Inner Hypnotists Kicks In 
As I’m sitting on the train on the way home trying to rack my brains for a 
solution, suddenly my training comes back to me.   
 
I remember that the last place you want to be when making a decision or 
trying to solve a problem is feeling guilty, stressful and hating yourself.   
 
I went through a little exercise to calm my own mind, something similar to 
the method we're using here.  The point is I’m changing my state to be 
calm, focused and clear.  It takes me the whole train journey home, roughly 
an hour, to clear my mind, because this is a very big deal for me.   
 
When I get home I clean myself up and go straight to bed.  I used my self-
hypnosis process to put myself asleep in the same way I’ve taught you to do 
it in today’s session.   
 
I slept like a baby.   
 
I dream and have a wonderful night’s sleep despite the fact that all of this 
stuff is happening on the outside.   
 
Ironically, I sleep so well that when I wake up the next day, for the first five 
or ten minutes I feel fantastic, top of the world as though nothing had 
happened.  In fact, I’ve completely forgotten about the events of the 
previous day.

Fear Grips Me Again 
Then somewhere along the lines when I’m showering or brushing my teeth, 
it hits me like a ton of bricks and I’m going into overload.  I’m getting 
frightened again, fearing for my job, because I’ve made a massive mess up 
and thinking, “Oh my God, this is terrible!”   
 
Again, I remember the Access State Principle.   
 
I cannot come up with a solution in that state. 
 
So I clear my mind and allow my emotions to burn through using the deep 
thought method that I’ve taught you along with the emo-streaming.  I burn 
through the negative emotions.  I keep myself focused on being calm and I 
know that absolutely a solution will come to me.   
 
ASP Saves Me 
That morning on the train on the way into to work I have a sudden flash of 
inspiration.  I know how to solve this.  I know exactly what to do.   
 
In case you're interested the solution is very simple.  In English law it’s 
illegal to back date documents they have to be signed the date that they are 
signed. 
 
Therefore, you can’t sign a document on the 10th, but make it the date of 
the 5th.  It’s totally illegal as far as English law is concerned and you can go 
to jail for that. 
 
The problem is the deal was done on the day, but the documents weren’t 
there to document it, so we can’t make it backwards active.  We can’t make 
the documents the date of the problem, because it’s illegal so we're stuck in 
this kind of paradox.   
 
The Inspiration 
I suddenly had this realization.   
 
My unconscious mind has come up with this – it's beautiful.

You can’t change the date on the document, but you can make agreements 
retroactive.  So although it’s signed on the 10th and dated the 10th you can 
say that it has effect as from the 5th. That’s totally legal, because now it 
crisp, clean and the law allows it.   
 
Now To Persuade The Partners! 
The first thing I did when I walked into work, I have a big grin on my face, I 
drag my supervisor out of his office, we walk into the senior partner’s office 
and I say to them here’s the solution.  At first they, because now they're still 
in fear remember and start telling me it’s illegal and not allowed.   
 
I say  
 
“No there’s a distinction; we're not changing the date we're changing the 
effective date.”   
 
Suddenly it hits them they know it’s a solution, so I start putting the whole 
thing into effect.  It takes us about a week to put the new documents into 
place, find new people to sign and agree to the whole thing.   
 
Seven days later, the new documents get signed, everything that used to be 
a hundred million dollar lawsuit has gone away.  The client is happy, we're 
happy, my career is safe and I breathe a sigh of relief.   
 
ASP Saves The Day 
All that down to a simple idea: the Access State Principle.   
 
How To Use The Power Self-Hypnosis Problem Solving Method 
I’m going to show you how to use that to solve problems here and now.  
Let’s assume that you're faced with some kind of problem and you don’t 
know how to resolve it.   
 
Problem Solving Step 1: Change Your State 
The first step is to change your state the same way that I did.  How do you 
change your state?

You’ve been changing your state the whole week.  The Power of Self-
Hypnosis Method you’ve been using is designed to change your state and 
clear your mind at the same time.   
 
Inner Secret 1: The CAVE Cycle Changes Your State! 
The CAVE cycle does this for you and that’s why you have the convincer 
stage of the CAVE cycle, it’s to clear your mind of all of these other 
thoughts.   
 
When you have habits you don’t want, when you have problems, when you 
have things you can’t solve, our minds tend towards feeling bad about it.   
 
What the ‘C’ part of the CAVE cycle, the convincer has done for you for the 
last six days has cleaned your mind out so you're in the room, in which 
problems get solved, habits get changed, inspiration can strike and that’s 
why it’s there, to change your mind, to filter out problem time from solution 
time.   
 
It’s a key part of the method and something that a lot of other systems don’t 
have.  Sometimes they don’t need them, because people will spontaneously 
go there, but you get to do it on purpose. 
 
Number one change your state.   
 
Problem Solving Step 2: Prime Your Mind 
Number two begin to prime your mind.   
 
Remember the deep thought process you did yesterday?   
 
Prime your mind with deep thought about the solution.   
 
 What’s the solution to this?   
 How can I resolve this?    
 
Problem Solving Step 3: Drift 
Then evoke, in other words, drift, let go.  Let your unconscious mind do its 
thing.

Inner Secret 2: Give Your Mind Time To Work Its Magic 
You may not get the solution the first time, but remember, I was sitting on 
that train and doing all that priming and I didn't get a solution.  I got home 
and before I went to bed again, I went through this whole cycle and I still 
didn't have a solution. 
 
I went to bed, went through my sleep cycle and built into it that while I’m 
sleeping and dreaming my unconscious mind will work on the problem.  I 
woke up the next day and still didn't have the solution.   
 
I sat on the train and that’s where it hit me.  It hit me with a delayed 
reaction, because my unconscious mind took a while to figure it out and 
allow the answer to filter the consciousness.   
 
Inner Secret 3: Deep Thought 
You need to pull out space for that whole cycle to occur.   
 
How can you do this?   
 
Let’s take it within the process of the CAVE cycle.  You’ve got the convincer, 
which is basically setting your state.  You now have the power of the Access 
State Principle working in your favor.   
 
Whilst you're there you can use the deep thought process to stimulate 
answers.   
 
How do I resolve this problem?   
 
If you can’t get it that way, you jump over to the emo-streaming.   
 
How will I be when I resolve this problem?   
 
This changes your state to a solution state to the state you’ll be in after 
solving the problem and attached to that might very well be the solution 
itself.  So far you’ve got a creativity strategy and it’ll take care of a lot of 
problems just doing that.

Problem Solving Step 4: Sleep On It 
The next phase is to sleep on it.   
 
Assuming like in my example, you haven’t solved the problem yet, then you 
simply resolve to sleep on it.  You go to bed, go through your sleeping 
method so you go into your sleep cycles to fall asleep and just before start 
the sleep cycles you set the intention.   
 
Inner Secret 4: Use Pre-Hypnotic Suggestions Before Sleep 
Remember your pre-hypnotic suggestions. See how they all start combining?   
 
Your pre-hypnotic suggestion is:  
 
I’m going to use the sleep method to fall asleep.  I’m going to dream 
comfortably and awaken refreshed in the morning.   
 
Whilst I’m sleeping my unconscious mind will work on resolving this problem 
so when I awaken tomorrow morning or sometime during the day the 
solution will just come to me.   
 
That’s a pre-hypnotic suggestion. Its stuff you’ve been doing all week 
anyway and now you're going to make it work for you to problem solve.   
 
Inner Secret 5: Trust Your Dreams And Intuitions 
Now, while you're sleeping and dreaming, take note of what dreams come to 
you, because very often you’ll have the solution in the dreamtime.  Let me 
give you an example.   
 
How Dreams Built A Sewing Machine 
You may have heard of or used yourself, a device called a ‘sewing machine’.   
 
A sewing machine is interesting, because you actually get to do something 
you do by hand and mechanically overcomes a particular problem, which is 
when you sew you have to get a needle in one way, the thread goes through 
and the needle comes back out with the thread on it.   
 

 
                                      The Power of Self-Hypnosis for Guaranteed 
                                                   Results Home Study Program 
  
 
© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         294
That is technically speaking impossible, because you can’t let go of the 
needle with the machine and pick it up again on the other side. It’s a difficult 
and technical problem.   
 
The inventor of the sewing machine was stumped for months with exactly 
this problem.  He couldn’t thread the needle all the way through the material 
and have it pull back out the other side with the thread following it.  It just 
doesn't work on a sewing machine because it has to have a fixed point which 
is, the machine making its work.   
 
It irritated him and he couldn’t get the resolution.   
 
One night he just decided to put it out of his mind.  He went to sleep.  That 
night he had the following dream.   
 
He dreamt that he was a jungle explorer and that he was being chased by a 
bunch of pigmies or man-eaters.  These people were tribal so they had all of 
these spears and they started hunting him and throwing the spears after 
him.  He noticed in his dream that these spears had a curious design.   
 
The spears had a hole at the top of the spear right around the point of the 
point.  At that point he had a flash of insight and woke up and the key thing 
is he wrote down that flash of insight.  He realized that to solve a technical 
problem you put the hole in the front of the head of the needle, the bit that 
pierces the material.   
 
That pulls the thread through and you have another item that keeps the 
thread there as the needle comes back out and suddenly you have the 
thread on the other side, which is where you want it.  So he resolved the 
problem in a dream and you might very well do the same.   
 
Inner Secret 6: Keep A Notepad By Your Bed 
If you're going to use the dream method then keep a pad of paper and pen 
next to your bedside and when you have a dream that seems important 
wake up, jot down the essential elements and go back to sleep again.  
Sometimes you’ll be hit with a flash of insight.   
 
Write it down.

On a rare occasion, those flashes on insight, when you look at them in the 
morning, are maybe not such a good idea, but they’ll still be the seed of 
something. So keep it anyway maybe use your deep thought to reflect on 
the concept and see how you can improve it to make it practical.   
 
 
Problem Solving Step 5: Visualize The Final Goal 
The next stage is to visualize the actual outcome.   
 
If you don’t know how to get to the solution, get to the solutions itself.  In 
other words, what is the result of it?   
 
Remember the Emo-Streaming is, “How do you feel when you get there?”   
 
You can also get there and visualize what the outcome will be like when you 
solve the problem.  For me that was a no-brainer, I would feel totally 
relieved.   
 
I’d go out and party-like a rock star with my friends for having saved my 
career.  I’d be patted on the back by all the people that were currently 
looking at me like I was dirt for having made that schoolboy error and I’d be 
very happy.   
 
Guess what?   
 
By the time I’d outlined the instructions, presented it to my senior partner 
and had the documents done and everything was executed I felt like I was 
on cloud nine.  I was totally popular in the department for having come up 
with an ingenious solution.   
 
I went out and had a great time.  In fact, the very outcome picture I had in 
my mind actually ended up being what I did.   
 
So go to the future to allow the unconscious mind to go, “Okay this is where 
we're heading we’ll find some way of getting there.”

Problem Solving Step 6: The BIG Drift 
Finally, a great method is the big drift, particularly when you're stuck.   
 
The big drift combines all the things we’ve been talking about and puts them 
into one neat package to get the result that you want.   
 
So take these strategies and use them to solve your problems, the things 
that are facing you; it’s a fantastic set of tools.  I can’t begin to tell you how 
many times that’s saved me, helped me out, helped me overcome the 
situations where I was totally stuck.  It un-sticks things and gets things 
moving. 
 
The big drift particularly is very useful when you feel stuck to un-stick things 
so you get a sense that something is actually happening even though you 
may not necessarily know what it is yet.   
 
 
Track 9 – Use This Practice Schedule For Success 
Time: 6m 35s 
 
 
Let’s focus on developing a practice schedule so you can have the power of 
self-hypnosis in your life for the rest of your life.  There are a couple of 
simple rules that I’m going to encourage you to think about while doing this.   
 
Practice Rule 1: Daily Practice  
Number one, daily practice is better than saving it all up and at the end of 
the month trying to do a six-hour marathon.   
 
Practice Rule 2: Wake Up And Bedtime 
Do five or ten minutes a day, morning and evening.  The two key periods of 
practice are in the morning immediately on waking up, usually within half an 
hour of awakening is the perfect time, because you still have that afterglow 
of the unconscious state.  
 
And in the evening before you go to sleep.

 I love to do self-hypnosis and present my goals, etc.  
 
Then I get into bed and do the self-hypnosis sleep method to fall asleep 
deeply and comfortably. That way I’m priming the pump and I know I’ve got 
everything gunning for me while I’m asleep.   
 
Additional Sessions 
You can if you wish to, put other sessions in between- lunchtime, in the 
evenings, these are good times.  Lunchtime to get you through the day or in 
the evening to separate your work life from evening life these are good 
distinctions to make.   
 
Practice Rule 3: The 21 Day Rule 
Remember, above all the 21-day rule.   
 
Stick to one topic for at least 21 days.  At the end of those 21 days evaluate 
your position again.  Are you getting the kind of results you want?   
 
You may want to continue.  Have you gotten the results you want?  You may 
want to stop and change to another topic.   
 
If you do stop, if your gains start receding again, once you stop doing what 
got them in the first place you want to get back on that pony and start riding 
it again.   
 
Sometimes you gain success, you stop, you start losing success, you get 
back on the pony, get successes again and you may have to do it a few 
months before its engrained enough that you can let go and its part of your 
regular blueprint.  Time will tell, as will experience.   
 
Troubleshooting Problems 
Finally, if you're not getting the results you want then you need to start 
doing some troubleshooting.   
 
How do you trouble shoot?   
 
Four sages is the classic point and of course, the power pendulum.   

 
                                      The Power of Self-Hypnosis for Guaranteed

The power pendulum may take some time, but it’s worth the effort.  The 
power pendulum is called the power pendulum for a reason; it’s powerful 
and it’s a pendulum.  It gets results, but you have to stay with it to get the 
results you want. 
 
Special Mini Booster Sessions 
When I say that you focus on one topic for the next 21 days I don’t mean 
you can’t do anything else.  There are little mini-trances you can do 
throughout the day if you need them.   
 
For example, you have important meetings coming up and important 
moments you have prepared for. So at that point, it’s appropriate to set 
your mind to get into the right shape.   
 
Important Meetings 
Let’s say you’ve got a big meeting coming up and you want to give it your 
all.  Then maybe five or ten minutes before the meeting you shut yourself in 
your office or if need be ‘the special office’ – in other words, the washroom – 
and you go into self-hypnosis very quickly. 
 
You rehearse how you want the meeting to go, set the outcome and when 
you're glowing and buzzing, come back out of self-hypnosis with a buzz still 
inside of you.  That’s going to color the tone of the interaction and help you 
get the result you want.   
 
So if there are little mini-projects in between like that, by all means do them 
as well, as they happen on the fly.   
 
Relaxing After Work 
If you come home, you’re a bit stressed and you could do with some 
relaxation again, do some self-hypnosis to relax, but knowing of course that 
it’s different than the main topic of a theme for that particular month.

Important: Stick To The 21 Day Rule 
Stick with the 21-day cycle.  Don’t chop and change just because you’ve 
started on something.  This is what I used to do and I used to do it very 
badly.   
 
When I wanted something to change and ironically the more I wanted it the 
more I would mess up my self-hypnosis, I’d start on my 21-day cycle and 
within day two I’d change it.  I’d change the suggestions and content.  Day 
three I’d change again.  Day four I’d change again.  Finally, at day five I’d 
work on something completely different.   
 
Remember how I said before that problems come in conglomerations, in 
units.  By solving one thing the tortoise will drag everything along with it.  
What you don’t want to do is get stuck by switching from one project to 
another, to another.   
 
Even though they may be related, focus on one project, let that be your 
head point and let the tortoise do the rest of the work.   
 
Stick to what you're doing for 21 days.   
 
Morning and evenings are the most important times and you’ll get results.   
 
Practice Rule 4: 5-15 Minutes Is All It Takes 
How long do you do it?   
 
I think five to ten minutes is plenty of time.  You can even go as far as 15 
minutes, but don’t spend much longer than that.   
 
Why?   
 
Self-hypnosis is there to empower your life; it shouldn’t be an escape from 
life.   
 
I do know people and I’ve been guilty of this myself, who think if five 
minutes a day gets this result, how much will five hours a day do so you sit 
there mediating like a monk and trying to get at this.   
 
What part of the mind are you trying to activate?

The trust and let go part or the needy, desperate must get it done part?   
 
Let’s face it the needy, desperate, must get it done part activates the law of 
reverse affect.   
 
If that’s where you are, chances are doing five hours a day will give you 
fewer results than doing less work, because you have to put your mind in 
the right place.   
 
Remember, ReSeT.   
 
You want a Receptive mind.  If you think you need five hours, you're not 
being very receptive you're being very pushy and that’s the killer when it 
comes to self-hypnosis.   
 
Exceptions To Rule 4 
So five, ten or 15 minutes and the only big exception is when you go to 
sleep then you're starting it off and you have no idea how long it takes, 
because you just go to sleep. 
 
The other one is the big drift.  Allow the big drift to take its own time.  
Sometimes that arm will come down in minutes and sometimes it will drift 
down over the course of 10 or 12 minutes so it can take longer and that’s 
okay.  Allow your unconscious mind to take the pace during the big drift.   
 
For all other activities set a time limit of between five and 15 minutes and 
stick to it.   
 
Finally, do take time to practice regularly, every single day.  You're better off 
doing five minutes a day and no more, but doing it every single day for the 
next few months than doing it for an hour on the weekend and making some 
time here, there and everywhere.   
 
You can find five minutes.  Anyone can find five minutes. It’s easy to do, 
because you only delay your sleep by five minutes and you do it before 
bedtime, which is when you want to do it anyway.

You can find those five minutes and when you do and practice regularly, the 
treasure house awaiting inside you is truly awesome and I look forward to 
the day when you discover it for yourself.   
 
 
Track 10 – How To Create The Perfect Life With The Power Self-
Hypnosis Method 
Time: 7m 03s 
 
 
The final thing I want to talk about at the end of this program now is how do 
you create the perfect life through the power of self-hypnosis?   
 
Aim For Long Term Results 
Of course, remember that we're looking for long-term results, we’re trusting 
the tortoise mind rather than the quick fixes of the hare brained mind.   
 
 
We're going to do steady, meticulous 21-day cycles and maybe even 
extending those cycles beyond that if we need to.  We know when we're 
solving one thing a whole bunch of other things are coming with it, 
especially when you build in those four sages and the various drifting cycles 
that we’ve put into the CAVE method. 
 
Quick Fixes Are Fine – But The Real Deal Is In Who You Become Over Time 
You’ll use little quick fixes as you need them for a meeting, a hot date, a 
special project, to solve a problem, as and when you need those, sure, by all 
means, use them.   
 
In the meantime, every evening, use the sleep cycles and the inner wake up 
call, using that and relying on that consistently and getting into practice with 
that.   
 
Mornings and evenings, do your five to ten minutes of self-hypnosis practice 
on whatever topic you have.

The Initial Set Up Phase  
For the next 15 days, remember you’ve been doing this for six days now, so 
for the next 15 days, I’d like you to stick with slightly longer practice, 
because you're going to listen to the 25 or 30 minute “Awakening Induction” 
[Awaken The Power Of Self-Hypnosis Day 2 Track 5] I created for you on 
day two, followed by a quick two, three or four minute self-practice to shore 
it up and make sure you're doing the effort.   
 
The whole thing will take you 30 minutes tops, 25 minutes to listen to the 
recording and three or four minutes to do the whole thing again on your own 
with a bit of affirmation and visualization on mastering the power of self-
hypnosis.   
 
You want to do this for the next 15 days to add to the six days you’ve 
already been doing it, because it sets the groundwork for where you're going 
to go with this.  It sets up the conditions, so by the time you're ready to deal 
with the problems and habits that you want to change, get up and running.   
 
You're already working from a point of success.  You're mind is ready and 
knows what its doing.  It’s primed for success so you just have to let it go 
and do its thing. 
 
How To Choose Your Next Goal 
How do you know what it is you want to work on?   
 
After all, sometimes you can’t just run out and say I think I’ve fixed 
everything in my life.   
 
Once you’ve dealt with immediate concerns or things that are bugging you 
right now, it would be good for you to figure out how to keep the progress 
going even when you don’t know what it is you should be working through.  
I’d like to give you a couple of ideas on what you can do at that point.   
 
The Wish List 
Number one is to draw up a wish list.   
 
Whenever you think of something that would be cool to be able to do, cool 
to have or a problem that you haven’t thought about for a while, but 

 
                                      The Power of Self-Hypnosis for Guaranteed

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         303
suddenly you get confronted with it again, because it’s something that 
happens every Christmas when you have to do ‘that’ thing.   
 
Add it to your Christmas list or your wish list.  Then go off taking things off 
the wish list one by one as they get resolved.  Sometimes you’ll start one 
thing on the wish list and realize you don’t need to do it anymore, because 
something else somehow took care of it, in which case, take it off.   
 
There will be plenty of other things to come and just add them to the wish 
list.  As you go by you’ll be able to delve into it as a grab bag and say  
 
This month I’m going to focus on this and it will be fantastic.   
 
The Life Bio 
The next one is a great little idea; write a life bio.   
 
Write the story of your life from your earliest memory to the present day.  
Let your stream of consciousness go through so keep writing and writing.  
This could be something you’ll spend a couple of weekends on working 
through to get the whole thing done.   
 
When you’ve written your entire life bio you’ll take it and use your power 
pendulum to point to each paragraph and say is there something in this 
paragraph that I could do with fixing?  How about this paragraph, this one 
and know the paragraphs that have something in it, some event that you 
want to clean up at some point.   
 
Go through each paragraph sentence by sentence, line by line and ask the 
unconscious mind,  
 
Is there something here that I should address?   
 
Is there something here that I need to clear up or something here and 
highlight those things?   
 
By the end of this lengthy process you’ll have a big bunch of papers with 
your entire life history, highlighted, maybe in different colors, with all the 
things where some clearing up could be done.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         304
Then if you’re ever stuck, are at a loose end, and don’t know where to begin 
or what thing to start cleaning up, go to your life bio and say  
 
 Should I start with this one?   
 Should I start with this one?   
 Should I start with this one?   
 How about this one?   
 
Great, I’ll go with this one and you have your month’s topic ready to roll.   
 
Hypnotic Questions & Deep Thought 
The next thing, which is something I personally like to do, is to just use the 
deep thought process.   
 
Remember the second of the four Taoist sages?   
 
Use the deep thought process only this time the suggestion, Afformation, the 
question you ask yourself is  
 
 What should I work through now?   
 What’s the next issue I should work through?   
 What’s the next issue I can clear up inside my mind?   
 
Focus on those questions and notice whatever comes up that will be the 
territory of your next month of work.   
 
The Perfect Life Visualization 
Finally, something, which is kind of charming, is to use an all-purpose life 
enhancer.   
 
Why not sit there and imagine the perfect life for yourself.  Go to the 
outcome.  Then add a little of your Emo-Streaming to get to what it feels like 
to have that perfect life and enjoy it.   
 
Throw in some affirmations saying,  
 
I’m in this great and perfect life for myself and every day I’m getting closer 
to it.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         305
Throw in some inner pep talk saying  
 
I feel amazing.  The inner power of my unconscious mind is moving me 
step-by-step every single day, closer to this absolute vision of happiness.   
 
I’m successful, rich, happy, I have love in my life, friendship, I’m doing good 
works, I’m a genuine force for good in the world and it’s all down to the 
power of self-hypnosis that I’ve been using for all this time it’s easy, natural 
and I feel fantastic knowing that this is coming for me.   
 
Get enthused with this.  If you want, you can even throw in things like the 
big drift so you don’t even know what it is you're doing. It’s just that you 
know your unconscious mind is working on building this absolutely 
sumptuous, rich, vital and vibrant future for you.   
 
With those four strategies you’ll never be stuck on things to work with and 
you’ll always have something to fill your self-hypnosis practice.   
 
Finish Your First 21 Day Cycle 
Please finish your 21-day cycle on the awakening process and that sets the 
pattern for you to use it with other things and other things, bit by bit, inch 
by inch, your whole life gets cleared up.   
 
No matter where you start from, eventually you’ll end up in a place where 
you are deeply satisfied with life – happy, rewarded, enriched so all the good 
things come to you.  That is my wish for you and that is the thought that I 
want to leave you with.   
 
Have fun, enjoy and discover the genuine power that lies hidden inside each 
one of us.

Bonus 1 – Expert Inductions You Can 
Use for Wonderful Deep Trances 
 
 
Track 1 – Bonus 1 Introduction 
Time: 1m 43s 
 
Welcome to the Power of Self-Hypnosis For Guaranteed Results Home Study 
Program.  This is bonus CD one to accompany your exciting seven day 
journey to thoroughly mastering the power of Self-Hypnosis. 
 
This bonus session is called Expert Inductions You Can Use For 
Wonderful Deep Trances.   
 
As you might expect in this bonus session we’re going to look at other ways 
you can take yourself into wonderful deep trances. 
 
We will examine and set up additional methods that you can use to access 
hypnosis so that you always have an alternative and can find a better 
approach to suit you or simply to offer you more options and varieties in life.   
 
We will of course look at the master keys that make any induction work so 
that you can find even more processes or create your own unique approach 
for yourself. 
 
Why not take a chance to discover for yourself the amazing powers that you 
have inside?  Once you’re ready to do that, just sit back, relax and enjoy the 
power of Self-Hypnosis. 
 
 
Track 2 – Variety Is The Spice Of Life 
Time: 2m 03s 
 
Welcome to this bonus track one.  In this track I want to introduce you to 
seven other methods of Self-Hypnosis that you can use in the same CAVE 
cycle as alternatives to the ones that I showed you on day two.

The Magic Is NOT In The Method – It’s In You! 
The reason for this– I want you to realize – there’s not really magic in the 
method you use to get to this special state of mind, the receptive state of 
mind, in which you get to use the power of suggestion and power of 
hypnosis in your favor. 
 
Choose One Approach To Master 
If you don’t like the particular approach we used in day two, choose any one 
of these seven methods and get good at that.  I recommend that you choose 
one approach and become good at that and let that be your natural second 
nature way of doing things.   
 
Then you can experiment with other ways of doing it just for variation or 
something different to do or other ways of looking at it and see how that 
treats you.   
 
Having one method that you stick to usually shows your neurology and kind 
of conditions your whole mind/body system to very quickly and easily get 
back to where you want to go easily, reliably and quickly anytime. 
 
Use A Different Method For A Change 
With that thought in mind, remember you can use any of these seven 
inductions either as an alternative to one you’re using just because you 
fancy a change or you can experiment with it if you haven’t quite taken to 
the method we used on day two, feel free to use one of these until you find 
the right approach that suits you. 
 
Feel Free To Use Your Own Approach 
The final thought I’ll leave with you is again, there’s no magic in these seven 
particular approaches, I’m just trying to expose you to different varieties and 
styles of Self-Hypnosis. 
 
If there’s a different method you’ve been exposed to before or you’ve come 
across a different method that you seem to click with on your own then by

all means use that method and make that a natural part of how you use 
Self-Hypnosis. 
 
The magic in the method is inside you.  It’s in that ReSeT formula.  It’s in 
the ability to use affirmations, visualizations and the various drifting 
processes in order for you to be able to get a message into your 
unconscious, change a blueprint and thereby change your life. 
 
 
Track 3 – PSH Method 1: The Power Pendulum 
Time: 2m 41s 
 
The first method of Self-Hypnosis that I want to give to you, the first of 
seven methods, is the Power Pendulum.   
 
You’ll be familiar with this already because on day five we will be using the 
power pendulum as a method of actually getting in touch with your 
unconscious and talking directly, in order to trouble shoot and problem solve 
things. 
 
If you haven’t gotten to day five yet, then by all means wait until you get to 
day five to do this method, but I’ll describe to you in any event how to use 
the power pendulum as a way of getting yourself into hypnosis and then 
carrying on with the CAVE cycle as usual. 
 
Step 1: Get Into Position 
The very first thing you do is you start off in exactly the same way as the 
use of the power pendulum.  In other words, find a comfortable position to 
rest in, your elbow nice and loose holding the pendulum and mentally will it 
to move. 
 
Step 2: Get The Power Pendulum Moving 
Imagine it moving backwards and forward, focus on it moving backward and 
forward and tell it to move backward and forward, until it does move 
backward and forward.

Insider’s Tip: Clear Your Mind! 
You’ll notice that you have to keep your mind clear.  There’s a kind of 
balance between willing it to move, wanting it to move, imagining it moving, 
telling it to move and getting out of your way enough to let the arm do it’s 
thing, to let the pendulum do it’s thing. 
 
When you get to that magical point where you’re putting enough effort in 
but not too much effort that it gets in the way, you’ve pretty much found the 
‘C’ stage of the CAVE cycle; remember the ‘C’ is al about the convincer 
stage.   
 
Once you’ve had that convincer, that moment that tells you right now you’ve 
entered a trance state and you have a response from the unconscious to 
show you that you’ve reached a place you want to go.   
 
Step 3: Close Your Eyes & Let Go 
At that place you can just let go, close your eyes, let go of the pendulum, let 
it slip out and as the pendulum hits the floor, the desk or any other place it 
ends up landing you can just simply slip into a comfortable trance and begin 
your affirmations, visualizations or drifting cycles, depending on what part of 
the process you want to focus on in that particular session. 
 
Step 4: Continue With ‘AVE’ Of The CAVE Cycle 
The rest is exactly the same as you learned on day two.  It is exactly the 
same method.  You’re still going to use the CAVE cycle, you’re still going to 
use the convincer which this time is now the pendulum. 
 
If you want to add a second convincer you can go right back to my right arm 
is relaxing- relaxing- relaxing there’s absolutely nothing that prevents you 
from doing that, you don’t need to do that.   
 
The fact that the pendulum is moving tells you that you’re right at the 
threshold, the gateway of trance; so as soon as you close your eyes relax 
and start talking to your own unconscious mind, at that point you’re pretty 
much set for success.

Track 4 – PSH Method 2: The Magnetic Hands 
Time: 4m 16s 
 
I’d like to move onto the next induction.  The second one is the Magnetic 
Hand Induction.   
 
The Hand Positions 
Again, this might be similar to something you did before, but it’s going to be 
a little different this time.  For the magnetic hand induction, feel free to look 
at the diagram in your manual, which accompanies this series, just to see 
the positioning.   
 
 
 
Step 1: Rub Your Hands 
The way you’re going to start off is just by rubbing your hands, palm to palm 
like your hands are cold and you just want to heat them up a bit. 
 
As you start rubbing your hands, you’ll feel that heat begin to develop.

Step 2: Hold Hands 1-4 Inches Apart 
As that heat develops then just allow your hands to rest apart – maybe one 
to four inches apart – kind of like you’re in the middle of clapping and your 
hands are just going to be frozen in space. 
 
Step 3: Notice The Sensations 
Your hands will still be warm from rubbing them.  Feel that warmth between 
them.  Feel the warmth radiating off them, so you can actually feel the 
warmth from one hand radiating into the other. 
 
Step 4: Feel The Force (Luke)! 
As the name implies, in magnetic hands the next thing to do is to move the 
hands in and out ever so slightly, almost to the point where you’re almost 
not sure whether you’re moving them at all. 
 
Get a sense of some kind of force or feel, like a magnet, pushing those 
hands apart or pulling those together.  Sometimes it feels like they’re being 
pulled together, sometimes it feels like they’re pushing apart; either way is 
fine.  The key though is to focus your attention on whatever sensations 
arise.   
 
Step 5: Go With The Flow 
As those sensations arise just focus on those and notice how they get 
stronger.  If those hands want to move in other words, if those hands feel a 
force pushing them apart; allow them to move apart naturally.  Don’t resist 
it and don’t make it happen simultaneously. 
 
If your hands feel like they’re drawing together, in other words some 
magnetic force is trying to pull them together then allow them to come 
together.   
 
Step 6: Close Your Eyes In Trance 
Either way, when your hands have moved a few inches, perhaps your hands 
have come all the way to touching each other, perhaps your hands are 
spread out so that your hands are now six, seven, 10 or 12 inches apart; at

that point you’ve pretty much got your ‘C’ stage of the CAVE cycle again 
that’s your convincer. 
 
You can feel free at that point to just close your eyes and drop into a nice 
deep comfortable trance.  
 
Step 7: Continue With ‘AVE’ Of The CAVE Cycle 
And then carry on with the affirmation, visualization and drifting cycles; or if 
you prefer you can carry on a little bit longer until you come to the point 
where you feel this is the right point for me to just close my eyes and start 
the next phase of the power of Self-Hypnosis cycles. 
 
Insider Secret: Look At The Space In Between 
A couple of things about this method; you can actually intensify the 
experience by looking at the space in between the hands using that as a 
focal point. 
 
What you do is you look at the space in between the hands and you’re trying 
to get a sense of where both of those hands are at the same time.  By 
looking at that space and seeing those hands at the same time, feeling the 
sensations, you’ll notice that your eye is going to peripheral vision, trying to 
keep track of both hands simultaneously. 
 
That actually, believe it or not, helps to open the doorway into hypnosis. So 
it’s a nice little trick you can use to add impact to what you’re doing.  It’s a 
lovely little technique you’ll see described in other different places and when 
you use it with the TACK principles and the CAVE as a cycle, so this is the 
convincer stage of the CAVE cycle, you’re there. 
 
Now you have two methods of doing alternatives to the ‘C’ stage of the 
CAVE cycle to induce a trance and know you’ve actually achieved one. 
 
One the next track I’d actually like to talk you through it a little bit, to give 
you a step-by-step process.  If you’re willing to actually have an experience 
of the magnetic hands induction; just move on to the next track.

Hypnotic Warning 
It is hypnotic, so don’t listen to it if you’re driving a car or operating any kind 
of machinery and I’ll actually talk you through step-by-step each part of the 
process as applied to the affirmation, the self-suggestion into becoming a 
master of Self-Hypnosis. 
 
If you are driving a car or operating any kind of machine, an iron or anything 
like that, skip the next track, go to the track after that, in which I will 
introduce you to the third Self-Hypnosis method and that one you can listen 
to again while driving or anything like that otherwise, I’ll see you on the next 
track. 
 
 
Track 5 – Exercise: PSH Method 2 – The Magnetic Hands 
Time: 6m 08s 
 
Step 1: Rub Your Hands 
Make sure you’re comfortable.  As soon as you’re sitting comfortably, bring 
your hands together in a kind of prayer position and start rubbing your 
hands along with me. 
 
Step 2: Hold Hands 1-4 Inches Apart 
As you’re rubbing those hands just notice the temperature building up inside 
those hands.  Feel the temperature building up.  As that heat gets to the 
point where it’s nice and hot, just relax your hands bringing them apart 
maybe one to two inches, palm to palm and facing the same position more 
or less. 
 
Step 3: Notice The Sensations 
Note a couple of things; first of all, you might realize there’s some heat 
there just notice that.  Perhaps you feel a buzzing or a tingling sensation as 
the blood flows to your fingers, as the energy is released inside you.

Step 4: Feel The Force (Luke)! 
Whether or not you feel that buzzing now or that tingling sensation, allow 
your hands to drift in and out ever so slightly and feel a magnetic force 
between them.  Maybe it feels as though you’re holding an invisible ball of 
energy and that ball of energy can expand pushing your hands apart or it 
can contract, drawing your hands together like a magnet. 
 
Feel that sense of something. 
Insiders Secret: Look At The Space In Between 
You may want to look at the space in between your hands.  Notice your 
hands drifting in and out naturally with your breathing, in and out; feel that 
ball.   
 
Step 5: Go With The Flow 
When you get a sense of that, will it to either expand and bring the hands 
apart or contract and bring them together.   
 
For the moment, let’s focus on the expanding.  Move those hands in and out 
and feel that expansion.  You won’t feel the expansion as fully when you’re 
moving the hands apart, you may have to push together ever so slightly to 
feel that tension again and then those hands drift apart again. 
 
Your hands are pushing ever so lightly, feel the tension and then they drift 
out again.  Push in like you’re squeezing the ball of energy and then let go 
and let them drift out again. 
 
Step 6: Close Your Eyes In Trance 
Now, as you get a sense of that, notice that at some stage your eyes will 
want to close comfortably.  You’ll feel more comfortable with your eyes 
closed than with your eyes open.   
 
Step 7: Continue With ‘AVE’ Of The CAVE Cycle 
At that stage just comfortably close your eyes and allow your hands to drift 
down to your lap only as slowly as you can affirm to yourself;

I am mastering Self-Hypnosis in my life.    
 
I am mastering the power of Self-Hypnosis in my life…  
 
And really get a sense of what that means.   
 
What does it mean to master the power of Self-Hypnosis in your life?   
 
Visualize a scene of being a master of the power of Self-Hypnosis.   
 
 How would you be as a person?   
 How would you feel?  Get a sense of that. 
 How do people respond to you?  Get a sense of that. 
 
Just let your mind go.  Drift comfortably and pleasantly through this scene 
or that.   
 
Perhaps you think of a pleasant scene like drifting down a river on a safe 
comfortable barge or a platform made of logs, hearing the sound of water, 
the sunshine’s warmth on your skin; the sound of nature, drifting pleasantly, 
drifting quite pleasantly; allowing the power of Self-Hypnosis to become a 
natural part of who you are and what you do in day to day life. 
 
That’s right, take all the time you want.   
 
Return From Trance 
When you’re ready just count yourself up from one to five.   
 
 On the count of one begin the journey back to full alert consciousness.   
 Two bring yourself out more and more completely. 
 Three, getting a sense of being back inside your body, knowing that 
those suggestions are now packing away safely in the back of your 
mind.   
 Four, allow the front of your mind to begin to stretch your body out, 
moving your hands, arms and legs. 
 Five, your eyes are open and you’re feeling refreshed, relaxed and 
alert, simply fantastic. 
 
Welcome back from another hypnotic adventure.  I hope you enjoyed the

Track 6 – PSH Method 3: The Arm Levitation 
Time: 7m 46s 
 
The next induction I want to share with you is a favorite of mine.  This is an 
induction that took me about two years before I could figure out how to 
actually make it work for me.  It took me a long time.  Now, I’ve actually 
found out a much quicker, much easier method to do this.   
 
I used to love doing this and this is how I actually got hold of the idea of the 
CAVE cycle, because it proved to me once and for all that I was in Self-
Hypnosis. 
 
How To Do The Arm Levitation Induction For Self-Hypnosis 
This is the infamous arm levitation induction.   
 
The idea here is that you trained your arm – your left arm or your right arm, 
it doesn’t matter which – to naturally start lifting up automatically, without 
you doing it.  It moves all by itself. 
 
As the arm moves up it causes you to go into hypnosis more and more 
deeply.  By the time the arm has reached a comfortable level you’re in deep 
hypnosis, you can start your affirmation cycles, visualizations and drifting, 
all the other regular parts of the CAVE cycle are there and ready for your 
disposal. 
 
My Favorite PSH Induction 
One of the reasons I really like this or I’m so affectionate towards it is 
probably because of the, ‘eureka moment’ I had when I actually first 
managed to actually make this work for me and figured out how to make it 
work easily. 
 
The second reason is because I used to use this all the time and you may 
recall that I used to use Self-Hypnosis as part of my own daily practice 
whenever something important came up in my life.

For example turning my business around into something that was financially 
viable from being on the verge of failure for the first six months.  
 
And also whenever I saw a client that I had no idea what to do with, I was a 
bit scared and nervous or if there was a big interview or a big meeting up 
ahead – I’d spend some time in Self-Hypnosis using this method. 
 
I wouldn’t begin the actual suggestion phase or the rehearsal of the meeting 
until my arm was comfortably floating up.  Sometimes I’d even let my arm 
drop down and do it all over again just to be totally sure I was there.  That’s 
me doing belts and braces and wanting to be perfect at this, but you don’t 
have to do that. 
 
A Convincing Response Gets You There 
The point is, once you get a convincing response from the unconscious, you 
know you’re there.  At that point, provided you have a receptive calm and 
peaceful mind, the rest is really easy to do and you know you have the 
perfect conditions to implant suggestions at the unconscious level. 
 
The Step By Step Arm Levitation Training 
Let’s talk through the method quickly first and then let’s actually go through 
an example of it where I guide you through the whole process so you can 
actually experience it for yourself. 
 
We’re going to essentially be using the same kind of principle that you used 
on day five in order to train yourself into using the power pendulum.  You’re 
going to basically teach the arm how to lift. 
 
That sounds a bit strange, because you already know how to lift the arm, 
right?   
 
Step 1: Lift The Arm 
If you take your right arm for example, put it on your lap, relax it nice and 
comfortably then pick it up and put it back down, you know how to do that.

Step 2: Focus – Stimulate The Neurological Connections 
The key thing is the more you do that and start paying attention to all the 
micro muscular movements, all the activity required to make that happen, at 
that point you begin to stimulate the neurological connections between your 
brain, the muscles in the arm and the actual motion itself. 
 
As that happens you’re creating a pathway that’s easier for your unconscious 
mind to plug into.  It begins to get a sense of oh I know what you want me 
to do.   
 
Step 3: Let Your Unconscious Mind Lift The Arm 
Once you’ve done it a few times – and I’ll guide you through the whole 
process in a moment – then you can rest your arm on your lap and tell your 
unconscious mind to do that. 
 
How do you do that?   
 
In the same way as you told your arm to relax and it started relaxing or in 
exactly the same way as you wanted the power pendulum to move and it 
started moving. 
 
The simple affirmation that I like to use is  
 
Unconscious mind, I want you to lift my right arm.  Lift that arm.  Go ahead 
and lift that arm.  Lift that arm lifting-lifting-lifting.  I feel my arm getting 
light, lifting-lifting-lifting.  
 
By the way, it’s already happening to me just by describing it to you – then 
the arm starts coming up all by itself.   
 
Insider’s Secret 1: Look For Unconscious Twitches 
You’ll tend to recognize the motion because it will tend to be a bit slow, it 
tends to be a jerky motion that stops and starts constantly.  It’ll go to a level 
and then it will stop.   
 
You might have twitches in the muscle from time to time, all of these are 
signs of unconscious motion and that’s great.

Step 4: Let The Hand Touch Your Face Or Chest 
As a rule I like to allow the arm to continue lifting until its come all the way 
up to touch my face.  
 
Step 5: Continue With ‘AVE’ Of The CAVE Cycle 
And then my eyes close and I know I’m in a perfect position to do the next 
part of my cycle, the CAVE cycle in other words, the affirming and 
visualization. 
 
Insider’s Secret 2: Use Repetition To Prime The Pump 
Here are a couple of tricks to make it easier.  The first thing of course is you 
lift the arm and put it down several times so you create a connection 
between the movement and the unconscious mind knowing what you want it 
to do. 
 
Insider’s Secret 3: Really Focus On The Muscles & The Movement 
The next thing and this is quite an important part of the phase, is for you to 
pay attention to all the different motions going on inside that arm.   
 
 After all, how do you lift your arm?   
 Do you know what muscles you need to move? 
 Does it begin in the wrist or the elbow?   
 Is it the shoulder blade?   
 
Remember, there are muscles in the back that actually have to move to 
support the whole arm structure and allow the arm to move up.  You may 
even find that you’re moving ever so slightly backwards to compensate in 
terms of your balance.   
 
As your arm comes up your body has to rebalance in different ways, so 
there are many different muscles that have to do a very subtle job.  The 
question is do you know what those are?   
 
When you lift and lower your arm you begin to find out – what’s going on in 
here.

 Where are my fingers?   
 Where is my wrist?   
 What muscles are working inside my wrist and in my forearm?  
 The connection between the forearm and the elbow?  
 What’s the connection between the elbow and the bicep and the 
triceps?   
 Which arm’s muscles are relaxing and which arm’s muscles are 
tensing?   
 
From the triceps up into your shoulder itself, the shoulder blade and then all 
the way down the back of your muscles as well.  All of those muscles you 
can pay attention to and really get a sense of how they’re working.   
 
Insider’s Secret 4: Lift The Hand As SLOWLY As Possible 
Once you’ve lifted your arm up and down a few times, you’ll probably do it 
10-20 times in the demonstration or the guided process later on. 
 
Once you’ve done that, the next stage is to let your arm rest in your lap 
then begin to lift it so slowly that you’re not sure that you’re lifting it 
yourself.  Lift it up so slowly that there might be a doubt in your mind if 
you’re doing it or if something else is doing it.   
 
Insider’s Secret 5: Do & Do Not – Blur That Boundary! 
At that point, as you’re moving it so slowly, just tell your unconscious mind  
 
I want you to lift that arm.  Lift that arm and keep lifting it.   
 
Then you may feel a kind of tension in the arm, a kind of lightness, 
looseness – different people experience it in different ways. 
 
In any sense, you’ll get a sense that the arm wants to lift by itself.  Allow 
that to happen.  Just notice it happening and enjoy that sensation it’s a 
wonderful sensation when it happens.  Then continue to focus on it as it 
continues on its own.   
 
You may be happy with it lifting up to about chest level or you may want the 
more complex maneuver where the elbow has to move up as well and the

arm has to move up a little bit further so you can come up and touch your 
face somewhere. 
 
Either way, once it’s lifted to a point where you’re happy with it, either it’s 
touched your face or it’s just lifted up to shoulder level or something like 
that, then automatically allow your eyes to close then carry your right arm 
with the affirmation, visualization and drifting cycles that you’re already 
familiar with by now. 
 
Hypnotic Warning 
Remember, the next exercise is hypnotic, so if you’re driving a car or 
operating any kind of machine, skip this until you’re ready to stop whatever 
you’re doing and pay full attention safely and follow along with the exercise. 
 
 
Track 7 – Exercise: PSH Method 3 – The Arm Levitation 
Time: 9m 03s 
 
The Set-Up 
Find a comfortable position, feet flat on the ground, sitting up straight, nice 
and comfortable.  Place both your arms and rest them on your lap, just like 
they’re resting there normally.  Make sure your hands aren’t touching each 
other simply and purely so they don’t interfere with each other when you lift 
one arm up and down. 
 
Step 1: Lift The Arm 
The first thing you want to do to begin this hypnotic process is for you to 
become curious as to how your arm could lift by itself.  You don’t even know 
how the arm lifts. 
 
In order to discover how that arm lifts, go ahead and lift it up by yourself.  
So the arm is up there, up in the sky, up in the floating around place, than 
bring it back down to rest in your lap. 
 
Now bring it back up into the air and put it back down into your lap.  Lift it 
back up into the air and bring it back down.

Step 2: Focus – Stimulate The Neurological Connections 
With each cycle up and back down again, I want you to pay particular 
attention to the muscles.  Keep lifting it up and back down again.  Pay 
attention to the muscles and how they feel.  
 
Can you sense which muscles you have to use to move that arm up and 
back down? 
 
Go up and back down.  Up and back down.  Up, move a bit slower now, to 
get a real sense of the wrist, the forearm and the elbow, the bicep, the 
shoulder – and back down.  In reverse; the shoulder, the bicep, the elbow – 
notice how the elbow has to move a little bit to make room for the arm to lift 
up. 
 
Insider’s Secret 3: Really Focus On The Muscles & The Movement 
Did your fingertip touch the lap first or is it the palm or the wrist?   
 
Up again – what part lifts up first?   
 
 Is it the palm?   
 Is it a fingertip?   
 Is it the thumb?   
 Is it the forearm that follows?   
 Which part lifts first…?   
 
…And back down. 
 
Returning it back, notice how the elbow has to move, the forearm has to 
move – is it the fingertips that touch your lap first or the palm, the wrist or 
the forearm?   
 
What touches your lap first?   
 
Back up, even slower now and back down.   
 
Keep lifting it up and down at that pace and up, nice and slowly, you’re still 
lifting it up consciously and back down, slowing the motion down ever so 
slightly on each cycle and really getting a good sense of what it takes to lift

that arm up - just get a sense of that – and slowly back down and get a 
sense of that. 
 
Rest it comfortably and lift it up, nice and slowly and back down nice and 
comfortably.   
 
Insider’s Secret 4: Lift The Hand As SLOWLY As Possible 
This time lift it up and continue the process of slowing down as its lifting…  
 
Insider’s Secret 5: Do & Do Not – Blur That Boundary! 
… To the point where you’re not even sure whether you’re lifting it or if it’s 
even moving. 
 
Continue to tell your unconscious mind  
 
lift that arm lifting- lifting- lifting…  
 
but so slowly you’re not even sure if you’re doing it lifting- lifting- lifting.   
 
The arm might feel light or heavy.  You might feel tension in the forearm.  
You might not even notice anything at all, just allow it to lift up and very 
slowly drift back down as though you’re not even doing it. 
 
Notice the sensation telling you to drop down, down comfortably, arm going 
down so slowly, you’re not even sure you’re doing it.  With that arm resting 
so lightly on your lap that you can barely sense it touching your lap, begin to 
focus on it lifting up, lifting up and lifting up.   
 
Step 3: Let Your Unconscious Mind Lift The Arm 
It may be slow lifting up and it can increase in speed, only this time don’t do 
anything consciously, let it just drift there lifting up and be curious, can you 
be in that state where you’re not sure – are you doing the lifting or is it 
lifting for you?

Step 4: Let The Hand Touch Your Face Or Chest 
Lifting up- up all the way, up all the way, up until it reaches the point where 
you want to close your eyes.  Whether that means that it touches your face 
or is up by chest level, it really doesn’t matter. 
 
Just lift it up, up and let it move in gradual jerky natural motions.  Enjoy the 
process, until your eyes are comfortably closed, eyes comfortably closed.   
 
Step 5: Continue With ‘AVE’ Of The CAVE Cycle 
Allow the arm to return only as slowly and smoothly as your firm suggestion 
to yourself. 
 
 I am mastering the power of Self-Hypnosis in my life.  
 I am mastering the power of Self-Hypnosis for my life.  
 I use Self-Hypnosis every day 
 I am mastering the power of Self-Hypnosis in my life.   
 I am mastering the power of Self-Hypnosis in my life. 
 I am mastering the power of Self-Hypnosis in my life. 
 
 
When the arm finally reaches your lap, just relax everything and drift- drift- 
drift there’s nothing of any importance for you to do right now except trust 
your unconscious mind and drift. 
 
As your unconscious mind internalizes the power of Self-Hypnosis and 
makes it naturally accessible to you anytime you want it or need it, drifting 
comfortably. 
 
Return From Trance 
Very good.  Now it’s time for you to return.  I’m going to count from one to 
five, count along with me.  We’re ready to do that now.   
 
 One- coming up slowly.  
 
 Two- allowing the suggestions to filter in and find fertile ground inside 
your mind in order for your blueprint to change and for you to have a 
happier, better more rewarding life.

 Three, get in touch with your body again.  Your body and arms may 
want to move a little bit.   
 
 Four, allow them to move and stretch out. 
 
 Five, open your eyes feeling refreshed, relaxed and alert; simply 
fantastic. 
 
Congratulations on having completed yet another hypnotic journey.   
 
As soon as you’ve done this I’m going to encourage you to stop this 
recording and do the whole process again, this time on your own for you to 
know that you can do it anytime you want or wish to. 
 
 
Track 8 – PSH Method 4: The Betty Erickson Method 
Time: 6m 11s 
 
The next technique is a lovely little technique that you may have come 
across before or then again, you may not have done.  It comes from the wife 
of Milton Erickson, Betty Erickson, who was a remarkably accomplished self 
hypnotist and she used the power of Self-Hypnosis throughout her life. 
 
Beat Distractions At Their Own Game! 
This is a wonderful technique particularly if you find yourself getting 
distracted or pulled outside by events outside yourself.  It’s a very good way 
of cycling through your attention to regain control of your attention and 
simultaneously go into trance. 
 
Betty Erickson’s 3-2-1 Technique 
The method is called ‘the 3-2-1 Technique’.  
 
Basically, because you’re going to cycle through things you see, hear and 
feel three times, two times, once then you’re going to close your eyes and 
do the same in reverse.  I’ll talk you through it in a second.

Step 1: Notice 3 Things You See 
Very simply, all you’re going to do is you’re going to let your attention drift 
wherever it is, just keep your eyes focused loosely on the outside world, 
notice three things that you see and call your attention to them. 
 
For example, you may be looking at the wall to say  
 
1. There’s the wall over there  
2. With a picture above it and  
3. There’s a glint where the sunlight is glinting off the corner of that 
picture.   
 
Those are three visually oriented statements about things that you can see.   
 
Step 2: Notice 3 Things You Hear 
The next step becomes three things that you can hear.   
 
You might say something like,  
 
1. I can hear the sound of my own breathing,  
2. Right now of course you can hear the sound of my voice talking to you 
and  
3. Perhaps you can hear the sound of nature outside. 
 
 
 Maybe there’s birds chirping  
 Or trees rustling,  
 You might be able to hear the sound of traffic  
 Or children playing outside,  
 The TV set next door…  
 
Whatever it is that you hear, just notice three things that you can pay 
attention to that you’re hearing and just recall those to yourself. 
 
You’ll say things like  
 
1. I can hear the chirping of the birds,  
2. I can hear the sound of my own breathing and  
3. I can hear the creaking of the floor boards.

These are things you say to yourself quietly, silently, mentally in a peaceful 
kind of tone of voice. 
 
Step 3: Notice 3 Things You Feel 
Then you can go through three things that you can feel.   
 
For example,  
 
1. I can feel the pressure of my backside against the chair,   
2. I can feel the sensation of my trousers touching my legs and  
3. I can feel the temperature of the room, the warmth of the room.   
 
Now I’ve cycled through three things I can see, three things I can hear and 
three things I can feel.  The next cycle is going to do exactly the same thing, 
only you only need two repetitions this time 
 
Step 4: Notice 2 Things You See, Hear, Feel 
So two things I can see. 
 
They may be the same things, they may be different things.  It doesn’t 
matter what it is just whatever captures your attention, just pay attention to 
that. 
 
1. I can see the corner of the wall where there’s a crack in between the 
doorframe.   
2. I can see that same picture again.   
 
Now we move onto two things you can hear.   
 
1. I can hear the TV set and  
2. I can hear the cracking of the floor or the creaking of the floor all over 
again. 
 
Now you go on to two things you can feel.   
 
1. I can feel my back resting against the chair and  
2. I can feel the pressure against the soles of my feet where they rest on 
the ground.

Step 5: Notice 1 Thing You See, Hear, Feel 
Now we go right back again and we go to one cycle of each.   
 
1. I can see the sunlight glinting off that picture.   
 
1. I can hear the sound of traffic outside.   
 
1. I can feel my arms touching my body. 
 
Step 6: Close Your Eyes And Repeat The Cycle Internally  
This third stage, so once you’ve gone through cycles three, two and one just 
close your eyes.  You’re going to do the same thing again building up cycles 
with your eyes closed. 
 
Step 7: Notice 3 Things You See, Hear, Feel 
This time we’re going to do three things you can see with your eyes closed.   
 
1. I can see darkness.   
2. Another thing you can see: I can see a pattern of light on my retina.   
3. A third thing you can see: that pattern of light has evolved into a 
bouncing ball. 
 
Let’s turn to three things you can hear.   
 
1. The first thing I can hear is the TV set still going.   
2. The second thing I can hear is the sound of people talking in the room 
next door.   
3. The third thing I can hear is the sound of something scrabbling 
outside. 
 
Three things you can feel;  
 
1. It might be the chair against your backside again,  
2. It might be the temperature and maybe  
3. It’s a gurgling sensation in your stomach.

Step 8: Notice 2 Things You See, Hear, Feel 
Now go to two cycles.   
 
Again, two things you can see.  For example: 
 
1. The darkness is still there and  
2. Now I see a pattern of lines going across each other.   
 
Two things you can hear:  
 
1. Well the sound of my breathing and  
2. The sound of the computer whirring.   
 
Two things you can feel and so on…  
 
Step 9: Notice 1 Thing You See, Hear, Feel 
Down to one, one and one. 
 
Congratulations: You’re In! 
At this stage you’ve done the whole method.  You’ve gone through 3-2-1 
cycles with your eyes open, you close your eyes and do 3-2-1 cycles with 
your eyes closed. 
 
The final cycle for the set of see hear feel, you’re in hypnosis.  You’re in Self-
Hypnosis so your mind is receptive.  Your critical factor has been overloaded 
with all these other things, so the guardian is offline, the gatekeeper isn’t 
paying attention anymore and you can go straight into your self-suggestion. 
 
Step 10: Continue With ‘AVE’ Of The CAVE Cycle 
If you have any doubts, feel free to do another convincer.  For example, the 
arm heavy suggestions and then go into your regular CAVE cycles to affirm 
the power of Self-Hypnosis then later of course, whatever goals you happen 
to be working on at that point in time. 
 
It’s a lovely little technique, it’s a lot of fun and instead of guiding you 
through it – because I don’t know what you’ll see, I don’t know what you’ll

hear or what you’ll be feeling – I’m just going to encourage you to do it for 
yourself. 
 
Give it a go before you move on to the next track, just to have an 
experience of it.  It’s a beautiful technique, it works great.  In particular, if 
you’re ever in a distracting environment, this is a great way of using the 
varied distractions that might otherwise keep you out of Self-Hypnosis as a 
way of getting into Self-Hypnosis. 
 
 
Track 9 – PSH Method 5: The iMethod 
Time: 4m 11s 
 
Introducing The iMethod 
The next method is straight from the iMethod.   
 
It’s the basic exercise using the eye method of accessing an altered state of 
consciousness to train your mind to basically be more powerful, to think feel 
and behave the way you want to think, feel and behave. 
 
The iMethod is similar to the Self-Hypnosis method you learned here, but it’s 
more involved.  There’s a lot more procedures you can go through to do a 
lot more things with your mind. 
 
I want you to use the iMethod or at least give you the iMethod for Self-
Hypnosis so you have an alternative way of accessing the Self-Hypnosis 
process as well.  On the next track I’ll briefly guide you through it as well. 
 
The Step By Step Guide To Using The iMethod For Self-Hypnosis 
Before that I want to talk about some very simple processes you’ll be using 
in it.   
 
Step 1: Focus Eyes Above The Horizontal 
The first part of the iMethod for getting into this altered state of 
consciousness is for you to focus your attention on a point slightly above eye 
level. 

 
                                      The Power of Self-Hypnosis for Guaranteed

This is for two reasons.   
 
 The first thing that happens, is when your eye is turned slightly above 
eye level- above the horizontal- you put a little bit of eye strain into 
your eye, which means your eyes will naturally want to close and 
that’s your first position for going into hypnosis. 
 
 The second happens with a little bit of eye strain or with your eyes 
looking above the horizontal that it begins to trigger the alpha rhythms 
in your brain, which is part again of what you want in this altered state 
of consciousness. 
 
 The third thing that will happen is that with your eyes focused on a 
fixed point, your mind begins to calm down. 
 
Step 2: Concentrate On A Detail – Create Eye Strain 
Now, with your eyes fixed on a fixed point you want to concentrate on that 
really intensely and that’s going to require a little bit of strain, which is just 
fine.   
 
Step 3: Relax The Muscles, Soften The Eyes 
As soon as you feel that strain, maybe in the muscles around the eyes, 
maybe in the tension inside your body, as soon as you feel that strain you’re 
just going to ease off.   
 
You’re going to allow your mind to relax, your body to relax and importantly 
your eyes to soften.  Your eyes will relax, so rather than looking at that 
point fixed over there, for example the corner of the picture. 
 
For example, you can allow your mind to just drift out so you can see the 
corners of the room, the ceiling and the floor going into peripheral vision.   
 
Insider Secret 1: Peripheral Vision Activates Your Neurology 
This is a very important stage in the process, because by triggering 
peripheral vision you’re actually triggering what’s called the 
parasympathetic nervous system, also known as the ‘relaxation

response’ and in doing so you’re basically silencing the gatekeeper.  It 
happens automatically.   
 
Step 4: Let Your Vision Expand Until Your Breathing Shifts 
You know you’re doing it because your breathing will tend to shift.   
 
At some point between letting go, focusing intensely on the corner of the 
picture whatever it is, letting your eyes soften and drift so you can see the 
corners of the room and so on.   
 
At the same time, as you drift into peripheral vision, you’ll notice your 
breathing naturally shifts into a different gear. 
 
Step 5: Close Eyes & Continue With The Full CAVE Cycle 
That is your sign that you’ve reached the ‘C’ stage of the CAVE cycle.  Next 
is to allow that breathing, that comfort, to continue. So that breathing 
deepens in whatever state you’re in. Then your ready to just close your eyes 
and go straight into the CAVE cycle. 
 
Overview Of The iMethod 
The way I like to do it is fix my attention, so get my eyes focused on a spot, 
focus intensely so you’ve got a little bit of tension, then relax so the eyes 
soften and the vision expands and notice the change in my breathing. 
 
As soon as my breathing changes I’ll close my eyes, focus on my breathing, 
which continues to deepen, so it feels like a glow of relaxation and comfort 
spreading through my body. 
 
Finally, allow that comfort to spread into my mind so that I can get a sense 
of calm open space open inside my mind. 
 
When I have that feeling of something inside my mind opening up like a 
calm open space that’s where I place my suggestions.  That’s when I start 
my affirmations, visualizations and eventually allow my mind to just drift for 
the CAVE cycle.

It’s a very simple technique and it’s very easy.  Don’t get too hung up on it.  
I’ll take you right through the whole process on the next track and if you 
don’t get it the first time, it’s not a big deal.   
 
You can come back to it another time and you have so many other different 
methods that you can choose from as well.   
 
Hypnotic Warning 
Remember, the next track is hypnotic.  If you’re driving a car or operating 
any kind of machine, you know what to do.  Stop the recording or stop the 
car. 
 
 
Track 10 – Exercise: PSH 5 – The iMethod 
Time: 5m 10s 
 
 
Step 1: Focus Eyes Above The Horizontal 
Okay, find a comfortable position to sit in then find a point out in front of 
you slightly above eye level for you to fix your attention on it.  It could be 
where the ceiling meets the wall, it could be a picture, the top corner of the 
picture, a cupboard, maybe the top corner of a TV set – just something out 
in front of you and focus all your attention on that. 
 
Step 2: Concentrate On A Detail – Create Eye Strain 
Try to make out the smallest, tiniest little pieces of detail.  When you see 
that tiny little bit of detail and you can see your eyes almost wanting to 
screw up to make it out clearly. 
 
Step 3: Relax The Muscles, Soften The Eyes 
Then just relax your eyes.  Soften your eyes.  Let go of the tension. 
 
It’s so much easier to not have to be tense.

Step 4: Let Your Vision Expand Until Your Breathing Shifts 
You’ll notice as you sit there with those eyes softening, your vision tends to 
expand.  You can still see of course that point you were looking at, but you 
can see more of the wall, more of the ceiling. 
 
Perhaps you can see the floor or the ceiling above you, the color of the table 
nearby.  You can get a sense of other objects in the room and notice how 
your breathing has a tendency to shift, deeper and more even, more 
comfortable. 
 
Step 5: Close Eyes & Continue With The Full CAVE Cycle 
As soon as that happens close your eyes, maintaining that soft gaze and that 
comfortable breathing.  Let it continue.  Fill your body with comfort.  
Eventually you’ll feel a space opening up inside your mind, a calm quiet 
peaceful space.   
 
When that happens you can affirm  
 
 I am mastering the power of Self-Hypnosis in my life. 
 I’m bringing the power of Self-Hypnosis into my life and I am 
mastering the power of Self-Hypnosis method.   
 I am mastering the power of Self-Hypnosis in my life.  
 
Really feel it.  Sense it.  Repeat it and understand and mean the affirmation.  
Let yourself drift comfortably and easily, drifting.  I’ll be quiet for awhile, to 
allow you to do that 
 
Return From Trance 
Very Good.   
 
Now, bring yourself back by counting from one to five.  On the count of 
three feel yourself getting back into your body, on the count of four wanting 
to stretch and on the count of five your eyes will open feeling refreshed, 
relaxed and alert; simply fantastic.  We’re ready to do that now.

 Two, allowing all those positive suggestions to filter into that quiet 
place inside your mind, changing the blueprint, so you can change 
your life; that way you can look forward to a bright new future. 
 Three, beginning to get sense your body, feeling your arms and legs 
all over again.   
 Four, your body wants to stretch; move your arms out. 
 Five, open your eyes feeling relaxed, refreshed and alert; simply 
fantastic.  
 
Give yourself a good stretch and congratulate yourself on having yet another 
hypnotic journey under your belt.  As soon as this recording finishes, feel 
free to do this thing by yourself so you know you can do this and then move 
on to the next track. 
 
 
Track 11 – PSH Method 6: The White Light 
Time: 2m 30s 
 
The next method is very simple and again something which is particularly 
liked in New Age circles.  This is a method that Tibetan Buddhists like to use.  
It’s used in many healing practices and in many kinds of alternative healing 
visualizations as well. 
 
Overview Of The White Light Induction 
It’s called the ‘White light Induction’.   
 
Step 1: Clear Your Mind 
Very simply all you have to do is find a comfortable position to sit in then 
you’re going to take a deep breath in, clear your mind and close your eyes 
as you’ve done before. 
 
Step 2: Imagine A Healing Light 
This time, the ‘C’ part of the CAVE cycle is just going to be imagining the 
healing, comfort bringing beautiful white light or if you prefer a different 
light color that emphasizes some kind of healing and healthy and 
comfortable sensation to you.

Step 3: Allow The Light To Progressively Fill Your Body 
Imagine that light coming in from the top of your head and moving slowly 
from the top of your head all the way down to the tips of your toes.  As you 
visualize that light moving through your body, feel your body relax, feel 
more comfortable, feel your mind becoming quiet and more receptive. 
 
As that healing white light progresses through your body, feel your cells 
becoming revitalized, feel your cells becoming refreshed like new healing 
energy is being pumped into them.  Get a sense of the comfort inside your 
body and relaxation every step of the way. 
 
Once you’ve scanned all the way through from the top of your head to the 
tips of your toes with the white light, you may want to go back the other 
way again and double up the levels of healing white light in your system. 
 
That’s great, you can do that. 
 
Step 4: Continue With ‘AVE’ Of The CAVE Cycle 
In any event, whether you go from the top down or the bottom up or one 
way down then all the way back up again, by the time you’ve finished that 
cycle you’ll be in a perfect place to start your affirmation, visualization and 
drifting cycles again. 
 
Remember, the ‘C’ part of the CAVE here, the convincing stage is that as you 
visualize that light coming through allow it to affect you.  Allow it to relax 
you, make you feel comfortable and get a sense of being revitalized, 
rejuvenated and refreshed, a sense of something healing entering into your 
body. 
 
It’s a great bit of symbolism and symbols are things that your unconscious 
mind responds too powerfully.  I’m not going to take you through the whole 
process, because it’s actually very simple to do. 
 
You may as well just take yourself through it and I encourage you to do that 
before you move onto the next method, just to get an experience of it in 
action.  Once you’ve done that, join me on the next track and I’ll take you 
through the seventh and final Self-Hypnosis method that I want to present 
to you here.

Track 12 – PSH Method 7: The Quick Relax 
Time: 3m 20s 
 
The final method is something I call ‘The Quick Relax’, it’s very simple.   
 
Step 1: Clear Your Mind 
You’re going to do the same cycle again.  Take a deep breath, clear your 
mind, breath out, relax and close your eyes.  That just sets the scene. 
 
Step 2: Progressively Focus On Relaxing Parts Of The Body 
Now, you’re going to systematically focus on different parts of your body and 
as you do so, you’re going to will them to relax.  The same way you wanted 
your arm to relax, you’re now going to move through your whole body. 
 
Insider Secret 1: Remember Profound Relaxation And You Will Evoke It 
The easy way to do this is to just remember what it feels like for your body 
to relax.  As you recall it, your body will relax.  As you recall that relaxation 
and begin to feel it, you pretty much have the whole convincer cycle there 
and ready to go. 
 
Insider Secret 2: If You Can’t Recall Relaxation – Practice! 
If you don’t know how to relax, then go ahead and listen to Bonus CD 2, on 
which I will take you through a whole relaxation process that you can then 
embed inside you so you know how to relax anytime, any place, anywhere. 
 
Insider Secret 3: Follow A Simple Progression 
As a rule, I like to go through four major body areas and recall the 
relaxation in those.   
 
Area 1: Legs 
The first body area is the legs.   
 

 
                                      The Power of Self-Hypnosis for Guaranteed

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         339
The legs include the knees, the ankles, the feet, the toes; and remembering 
what all that feels like to be relaxed. 
 
Area 2: Trunk 
The next body area I like to focus on is the trunk.   
 
The trunk is the chest, stomach, the upper back and the lower back and the 
spine that connects everything in between. 
 
Area 3: Arms & Shoulders 
The next body area is the arms and shoulders.   
 
So there’s the shoulder’s, the arms, the elbows, the forearms, the wrists, 
the palms, the fingertips and the fingers themselves. 
 
Area 4: Head 
Finally, we have the face and the head.   
 
Including the neck, the face area, the tongue, the eyes, the scalp, the back 
of the head and even the ears can feel more comfortable and relaxed. 
 
With those four areas, you can basically recall what it feels like to have all 
those parts relaxed.  As you remember that, as you think about that that 
relaxation comes back into your body.   
 
Step 3: Continue With ‘AVE’ Of The CAVE Cycle 
As soon as all four areas are deeply and comfortably relaxed that’s pretty 
much the ‘C’ stage of the CAVE cycle out of the way and you go straight into 
affirmation, visualization and drifting. 
 
I’m not going to take you through this because again, it’s more about you 
using your memory to do this. 
 
Relaxation Practice 
If you’re not quite sure how to do that then again, proceed to Bonus CD 2 
and at that point I’m going to take you through a more involved version of

the quick relax, it’s called ‘The Deep Relaxation Cycle’ and you’ll teach your 
body how to relax anytime, any place, anywhere. 
 
This is a wonderful quick method and when you get good at it you’ll literally 
be able to take a deep breath, close your eyes and feel a sinking feeling of 
comfort and relaxation just waving through your whole body.   
 
Within less than a minute you can be in this comfortable, deep, self hypnotic 
state, in which you can do anything you want whether it’s drifting, healing, 
affirmation, visualizations whatever it is you want to do, it’s there for you.   
 
It’s called ‘The Quick Relax’ for a reason, because you can do it all under a 
minute once you get used to it. 
 
Until then, you may want to take two to three minutes to focus a minute or 
so on each body area and allowing that to sink in and get a real solid feel for 
what it’s like to have all that body relaxed. 
 
 
Track 13 – The Master Keys To The Power Self-Hypnosis Method 
Time: 4m 12s 
 
We’re coming to the end of this bonus CD and I just wanted to take a couple 
of key features that emphasizes the whole program and what you’ve been 
doing here. 
 
The Magic Is Not In The Method – It’s In YOU! 
Recall of course that none of these methods have any particular magic in 
them over any of the others.  The point is there are different ways for you to 
experience the CAVE cycle. 
 
The Three Formulas 
We have three different formulas that will give you different levels of the 
understanding of how to use Self-Hypnosis.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         341
 
The ReSeT Formula 
We have the idea of ReSeT, which tells you basically the kind of principles 
you’re involved in, rather the objectives you’re trying to aim at in Self-
Hypnosis. 
 
ReSeT stands for: 
 
 ‘R’, you want to have a receptive mind,  
 ‘S’ you want to silence the gate keeper, and  
 ‘T’ you’re going to use the tools that you have in order to implant 
suggestions and change your blueprint. 
 
Those are the main key goals or objectives you’re trying to reach.   
 
The CAVE Cycle 
Of course the CAVE cycle is how you do that.   
 
1. The ‘C’ part, the convincing stage, is all about getting into that trance 
and knowing that you’re there.  You’ve noticed that every single one of 
these alternative methods has a way of you knowing when you get 
there. 
 
2. Then we have the Affirmation and Visualization cycle (‘AV’), which is 
when you actually do the work. 
 
3. Then the Drifting cycle (‘E’) when you allow your unconscious mind to 
integrate the work, absorb it into itself and make that part of your 
everyday experience. 
 
The Right TACK 
Of course, we also have a very high level big picture idea, which is TACK.   
 
Basically, it’s the attitude, the principles that you bring to the whole 
equation to the whole party. So remember in TACK we have:  
 
1. Inducing a Trance – where you’ve got at least seven methods here 
plus the things you learned on the actual Power Self-Hypnosis course. 

 
                                      The Power of Self-Hypnosis for Guaranteed

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         342
 
This then gives you about 10 different methods of going into hypnosis and 
between those you’ll find the perfect ideal way for you to do it.   
 
2. ‘A’ is all about the Attitude – and I can’t emphasize the attitude 
enough.  The attitude relies on the conscious mind rather than the 
hare brain.   
 
You don’t want to have speed, you want to be easy does it, just relax into it 
trust the process and let things happen.  Of course, this is reflected again in 
the idea of having a receptive mind. 
 
3. The ‘C’ stage is where you actually do the work. That’s like the CAVE 
cycle.  
 
4. And the ‘K’ is very important coming out.  Having a sense of Knowing 
that everything is turning out well, a sense of knowing that your 
suggestions are being absorbed and a sense of knowing that 
something has shifted inside you even though you don’t necessarily 
know what that is yet. 
 
Between TACK, ReSeT and CAVE, you have the keys to running the power of 
your mind.   
 
 CAVE gives you the actual processes.   
 ReSeT gives you the objectives you’re trying to reach and  
 TACK gives your mind a sense of well, these are the principles I’m 
trying to engage in and keep going through it. 
 
Don’t Be A Jack-Of-All-Trades, Be A Master Of One 
Do take it easy.  Enjoy the process, feel good with it and have fun.  Find one 
of these ten methods that works for you, if you didn’t like them go on the 
internet and find others. 
 
It doesn’t matter what method you use. What matters is that you’re using 
the CAVE cycle and you’re creating that ReSeT structure.  You’ve got a 
receptive mind.  You are silencing the critical factor – this gatekeeper that’s 
keeping you from accessing those riches at the unconscious level – and 
you’re going to use your tools to systematically get the results you want.

At that point your life is wide open to you.  You have amazing things waiting 
for you and I hope you get to enjoy them.  Life can be really exciting and a 
lot of fun. 
 
The final thought I’ll leave you with is that I recommend that you use one as 
your habitual home point and use it all the time.  Practice all the other 
methods from time to time, just to keep you fresh and keep you from going 
stale.  It’s just a fun way of keeping things fresh and alive.   
 
Also, it gives you different insights into the hypnotic process.  As you do 
these different methods you’ll be doing the same thing using different tools 
and that gives you a different insight, a different perspective on doing the 
same thing, which provides a richer experience.  
 
With those happy thoughts I’m going to leave you to experiment and enjoy 
these seven methods alongside the others that you’ve learned on the main 
program.

Bonus 2 – The Sure Fire Fix To Get Even 
The Most Stubborn Mind Into A Hypnotic

Track 1 – Bonus 2 Introduction  
Time: 1m 43s 
  
 
Welcome to the Power of Self-Hypnosis For Guaranteed Results Home Study 
Program.  This is bonus CD two to accompany your exciting seven-day 
journey to thoroughly master the power of self-hypnosis. 
 
This bonus session is called The Sure Fire Fix to Get Even the Most 
Stubborn Mind into a Hypnotic State.   
 
In this bonus session, we're going to examine how to fix the most common 
problems people face when trying to go into hypnosis. 
 
 First, we’ll look at how you can improve your attention so that 
distractions no longer prevent you from practicing the power of your 
mind.   
 
 Then, we’ll focus on how to fix problems such as the gatekeeper that 
refuses to leave you alone and that special state that will ensure that 
he has to anyway.   
 
 Finally, we’ll finish the day’s session with a special hypnotic exercise 
that will fix all these problems with just a little practice.   
 
Why not take a chance to discover for yourself the amazing powers that you 
have inside, because once you're ready to do that, sit back, relax and enjoy 
the power of self-hypnosis.

Track 2 – The 3 Gremlins Of Self-Hypnosis 
Time: 1m 50s 
 
 
Welcome to this Bonus CD 2.  In this bonus session we're going to do a bit 
of troubleshooting.   
 
What if you can’t get yourself into self-hypnosis?   
 
What are the typical things that can keep you out of, just the state, let alone 
all the other things?   
 
Of course, we’ve got all the other troubleshooting sections in different parts 
of the program, if your goals don’t work, your affirmations trigger off a dirty 
goal and that sort of thing.  I want to focus on fixing the most common 
reasons why people don’t get into self-hypnosis in the first place.   
 
What are those reasons?   
 
The 3 Gremlins 
 
Gremlin 1: Attention 
The inability to keep attention.  
 
In other words, distracting thoughts; distractions from the outside world 
keep coming in and preventing you from focusing in the way you need to, to 
create the reset conditions.   
 
Gremlin 2: State 
The shifting into the state, feeling a sense of comfort and relaxation that 
opens up the mind.   
 
Remember, you're going to move into that room, in which you can make 
personal changes happen.  Shifting into that room can sometimes be a 
challenging step for other people especially when you're using relaxation as 
the gateway.

Gremlin 3: The Gatekeeper 
The shutting down of the gatekeeper; how do you keep the gatekeeper from 
interfering?   
 
Luckily, the last two, the shifting state into the magical room where you can 
make positive changes and shutting down the gatekeeper, keeping him 
silent, can be done with the same thing.  Both of them are done through 
relaxation.   
 
For the moment we’ll focus on those three key problems people have:  
 
 Keeping your attention going,  
 What if you can’t shift your state properly and  
 What is that critical factor where that gatekeeper keeps trying to come 
back in again and criticize, analyze, think too much and that sort of 
thing how do you shut that down?   
 
We're going to focus on those three things.   
 
 
Track 3 – How To Grab The Attention Gremlin 
Time: 11m 49s 
 
 
Let’s look at the attention.  What can you do if the attention doesn't cycle 
properly?   
 
Attention Strategy 1: Use the Distraction 
The first thing you can do is use whatever distractions you have.   
 
For example, if you're on the outside, in an airplane, bus or car and there 
are lots of distracting noises, sights and sounds around you, you can use 
those sights to get you into hypnosis.   
 
How do you do that?   
 
Use the Betty Erickson Method that was shown to you on Bonus CD 1 and 
that’s something, which is always there for you.

Let’s assume that you just have an inability to concentrate or keep your 
attention for whatever reason.   
 
Attention Strategy 2: Attention Training 
Next is to learn to keep attention.   
 
Here are a couple of exercises or drills that you can do to help you improve 
your attention.   
 
Attention Trainer 1: Thumb Rolling 
The first one is basic thumb rolling.   
 
You know, when we start talking about twiddling your thumbs?   
 
You sit there, your hands are on the desk, you interlock the fingers and you 
just twiddle your thumbs?  Believe it or not that can be a great exercise for 
conditioning your attention to become better, your concentration to be 
better.   
 
How are we going to use this?  
 
 If you look at the manual in the bonus 
section for this bonus CD you’ll see a little 
diagram of the position I’m talking about.  
Hands interlocked and the thumbs 
basically free. 
 
If you rotate the thumbs like the little 
children’s game where you just rotate 
thumbs, the key thing here is you're going 
to move the thumbs at a reasonable pace 
and you’ve got to make sure that those 
thumbs don’t touch anything.   
 
So the thumbs don’t meet, bump into 
each other, don’t cross and simultaneously they don’t touch the other fingers 
or the rest of the hand.  You're going to move those thumbs so that they're 
not touching anything, but the motion is constant and smooth.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         348
 
This fixes your attention.  Your attention has to be on that, because if you 
start thinking about other things your thumbs will start getting lazy, they’ll 
bump into a finger or another thumb and start interfering with each other.   
 
The moment you feel some sensation with your thumb, as if you’ve touched 
something, it tells you that your attention has gone away so you go right 
back to the exercise it’s a beautiful and simple little exercise.   
 
Only do it two or three minutes at a time.  You can do it anywhere– on a 
bus, waiting for a bus, at work, in a meeting anywhere, but if your attention 
is on those thumbs and making sure they're not touching –that’s the key 
piece – that means your concentration is doing something, it’s being trained 
rather than just being distracted and the thumbs twiddling distractedly. 
 
Attention Trainer 2: Breathing 
The next strategy is to observe your breathing.   
 
This is something that’s been used by mediators throughout history for 
thousands and thousands of years.  Your breathing is linked to your state 
and it’s a wonderful biofeedback tool for creating more concentration and a 
more profound state.   
 
To focus on your breathing is simple.  In whatever way you notice that 
you're breathing, because right now you do know you're breathing, right just 
focus on that.   
 
 That could be the sensation of the breath coming in and out of your 
nostrils. 
 In the back of your throat as your breath comes in and out. 
 The feeling of your chest rising and falling.  
 
It honestly doesn't matter what you're focusing on.  In whatever way you 
want to do it, just focus on your breathing.   
 
If you don’t know how to do that just ask yourself this question:  
 
 Are you breathing?

It’s all right, whatever that is that’s what you focus on.  Again, just take two 
or three minutes to do that.   
 
The key thing is if your mind jumps to something else, just bring it right 
back again to your breathing.  It’s a great stabilizing point or factor for 
allowing your attention or awareness to be in the present moment and 
concentrate on being aware.   
 
Attention Trainer 3: Focus On Sensations 
The next thing to do is similar to the big drift and that’s become very aware 
of sensations.   
 
A nice thing to do, as in the big drift, is for you to bring your palms close 
together like in the magnetic hand induction and begin to sense or feel the 
temperature radiating off one hand in the other.  Notice any other 
sensations you can feel.   
 
Do you feel tingling, tiredness, tension anything else in those hands?   
 
As you're becoming more sensitive to the sensation in your hands?  
 
Especially when they face each other in the prayer position, but an inch or so 
apart, your attention gets concentrated on something specific.   
 
The Key To Concentration 
This is the key to concentration.  If you have something specific to focus on 
and something that you're curious about that gives you something to do.  If 
you're doing something your concentration is automatically there.  If you 
have nothing to do then it begins to fade away.   
 
Start with small units of time, two or three minutes at a time is plenty, 
because it only takes two or three minutes for you to go into self-hypnosis.  
At that point you’ll have plenty of other things to do to keep your attention 
going. 
 
So, initially try those different exercises.  There are other things you can 
also do.

The Deep Relaxation Cycle 
In a moment we're going to go into the deep relaxation routine, which is a 
great way to train your concentration.  You’ll find that initially, your 
concentration drifts all over the place and actually that’s a good thing.   
 
You Win Either Way! 
As long as you're shifting your state, the drifting means your unconscious 
mind is doing the work. You're doing a pre-hypnotic suggestion.   
 
If your attention is fully on the process, in other words, your concentration is 
on relaxing the different parts as we’ll describe later on then again, you're 
training your concentration.   
 
So either you're training your attention and concentration, which is an 
important and vital part in the power of self-hypnosis method or you're 
already in self-hypnosis, in which case you allow the drifting to occur 
comfortably, in which case it happens.   
 
Focus On Comfort 
The only thing that can be in your way is if you're drifting and aren’t feeling 
comfortable, kind of out of sorts in some way.  At that point, just refocus 
your attention on the deeper relaxation exercise and you have something 
positive to focus on again.   
 
Then the whole cycle goes on again until you're awareness spaces out, in 
which is fine, because as long as you're feeling comfortable you're in exactly 
the right place.   
 
We’ll look at the deep relaxation method more fully a little later on in this 
session.   
 
Attention Trainer 3: Classic Exercises 
Before we do that I want to give you more classic concentration exercises 
people play with or use as a way of building concentration.  Everything 
we’ve talked about here so far is probably enough and I’m going to give 
them to you anyway so you have more things to play with.

Attention Trainer 4: Stare! 
The first one is looking at an object.   
 
It’s the classic, get a candle, stare at the candle and see the candle.  If your 
attention wanders, come back to the candle it’s very simple.  We’ve all found 
ourselves doing this spontaneously when for example we have our attention 
arrested by something.   
 
People love to gaze into fires.  You have a little campfire, everyone is sitting 
around and there is a lull in conversation where everyone just stares off into 
the fire seeing their own things.   
 
Guess what?   
 
Their attention is focused, their concentration is there, distractions aren’t 
distracting them anymore and believe it or not they're beginning to go into a 
self-hypnotic state.  You don’t have to use a candle flame or log fire to do 
that you can use anything.   
 
 I’ve had the experience where we walk into an art shop or a gallery 
and a beautiful painting is there that just arrests your attention and 
you want to absorb it.   
 
 In Eastern mysticism and meditation practices they have Mandalas, 
which do the exact same thing.   
 
 They have pictures people look at to arrest their attention.  These 
pictures have significant religious meanings to some people as well, so 
of course, that has a spiritual layer too.  So if you're a spiritually 
oriented person, then use spiritual symbols to do that too.   
 
 When you're in church the sign of the cross, the figure Mary or other 
things you look at are great fixation points to concentrate your 
attention on, so not only do you go into a self-hypnotic state, but 
you're also having a spiritual exercise at the same time.   
 
It doesn't matter what religion you're from Hindu, Jewish, Buddhist or 
Muslim each religion has its own set of symbols, you can look at one of 
those, focus your attention on that and that trains your concentration and 
awareness too.

Again, you can use mundane symbols – just don’t use a TV set, because a 
TV set actually breaks your concentration.  It keeps your attention, but it 
doesn't necessarily allow your attention to be trained as well, because things 
keep changing within the TV set and that’s what keeps your attention 
hooked.   
 
That’s not necessarily useful, because you want to have your attention on 
something static rather than something mobile.   
 
Attention Trainer 5: Matching Picture Cards Memory Game 
The next thing is fun.  You play memory games.   
 
If you have ever played the memory game where you have a bunch of cards 
where two are the same, you turn all the cards over and you start turning 
over cards at random and try to match pairs.   
 
When you turn over the card that has a picture of an elephant, you have to 
try to remember where that is.  Later on, when someone picks up the 
elephant you go, “Now I know where both elephants are.” So you pick up 
elephant one and think, “Okay I remember this card was elephant two” – 
and you remember where that was.   
 
These memory games are great games to play, because they improve on 
sharpening your concentration.   
 
Attention Trainer 6: The Visual Memory Game 
Other memory games involve memorizing objects out of raw willpower is 
one way to do it.   
 
For example, you have a tray full of objects you look at them, cover the tray 
and try to memorize where they all were and what they were.  
 
Or you can use mnemonic devices if you're familiar them – like the Cicero 
method like visualizing associations and things like that.   
 
I’m not going to go into them so much just, because you have plenty of 
other things to get on with here.  It’s just to be aware that if you have got

memory games and are aware of mnemonic techniques those are great 
ways of improving your concentration. 
 
Attention Trainer 7: Play With Your Imagination! 
Finally, this is where this idea of memory games comes into is to play with 
the imagination.  Do stuff with the imagination.  The more you can make the 
imagination do stuff, strange, wild, bizarre stuff the more your concentration 
gets trained.   
 
For example, you can think of a fruit, an apple, or an orange.  If you think of 
an apple – the color of my apple is green right now – yours may be green, 
red or different shades.  Let’s see if you can change the color.   
 
 Can you make it a black, purple or yellow apple?   
 Can you make the apple larger?   
 Can you make it the size of a house or a watermelon?   
 Can you cut the apple in half and see the inside, the pits and the 
rind?   
 Can you squeeze the apple and hear the crunching sounds when 
you bite into the apple and get a sense of that crunching sound?   
 
Notice how you're using your imagination to go through different exercises.  
Break down anything.  Look at your TV set and imagine what it’s like to 
break it down.  Take the screen off and the wiring inside, taking those knobs 
off the side.   
 
It could be looking at your cupboard, mentally opening the doors and seeing 
what’s all inside there.  Seeing the way the suits are hung up, the shirts, the 
shoes, etc. and all of this inside your imagination.   
 
Perhaps you re-organize your closet mentally first as you go through the 
whole thing.  It’s a great exercise, because in time you get to do this, you're 
basically doing the whole rehearsal strategy so you can mentally re-organize 
your entire house before you do anything.   
 
Once you’ve done it mentally, doing it physically becomes a piece of cake.   
 
This is a lot of fun.

You can do a lot of different imagination games, go on wild adventures, take 
things part and put things together, recall your journey home, anything, as 
long as it’s in your imagination and of course, it requires your attention. 
 
If your attention drifts, then you're not doing anything internally any more 
so you go right back to where you left off.  These are some great exercises 
you can play with in order to get your attention sorted out.   
 
Track 4 – How To Slay The Gatekeeper Gremlin 
Time: 3m 34s 
 
 
Let’s turn our attention to that pesky gatekeeper and how you can silence 
him.  There are a lot of things you can do to silence the gatekeeper.   
 
Gatekeeper Killer 1: Timing 
The first thing is to get your timing right.   
 
The gatekeeper is least active during the time that you're asleep and it’s also 
least active in the times that surround those areas.  It prepares to wind 
down so as you’re about to go to bed and in the morning when you wake up 
that’s when your gatekeeper is least active.   
 
Use Your Biorhythms 
During the middle of the day it tends to be more active, which means you 
have to work a little harder to silence him and get him out of the way.   
 
This is also something known as biorhythms.   
 
In other words, your body clock, internal clock goes to different rhythms and 
cycles.  Partly to do with day and night cycles, partly to do with just waking 
and sleeping cycles.  It’s a natural rhythm that you're in all the time anyway.   
 
First Thing In The Morning & Last Thing At Night 
A great time to do your practice, if you find your gatekeeper getting in the 
way is first thing in the morning when you still have that glow, after effect of 
just waking up. Also as the last thing at night before you go to sleep, 
because then your body is winding down and getting ready for it.

Stay Up Late 
Also, if you wait past the point that you normally go to sleep, at that time 
your gatekeeper naturally begins to drift off, because it’s a creature of habit 
and it’s expecting to be turning in by then anyway.  Therefore, working late 
at night, 1:00 or 2:00 o’clock in the morning can be a great time for some 
people purely, because the gatekeeper that critical factor is offline.   
 
So you're not overanalyzing anymore and things just seem to flow more, it’s 
purely, because you're using that natural cycle, natural biorhythm to time it 
at a point where the gatekeeper is least active anyway.   
 
Use Your Attention Properly 
The next thing to realize is that your attention helps.   
 
Full Attention 
If all of your attention is on one thing, there is no energy left for your 
gatekeeper to work with. It’s kind of like draining the energy out of him.  If 
you think of the gatekeeper as a robot, fueled by petrol [US English: Gas] 
it’s like siphoning the petrol [US English: Gas] out of him as soon as you put 
all your attention on something else.   
 
Don’t Leave Any Food For The Gremlins! 
The moment you have some attention left over, at that point you have some 
energy left for the gatekeeper to come in at some point.  So the more 
attention you can put on something, the less active the gatekeeper can be.  
Of course, you see the value of the attention exercises from earlier on 
instantly at this point.   
 
Put The Gremlin To Sleep With Relaxation 
The next thing to realize is the relaxation response, the parasympathetic 
nervous system arousal.

You’ll notice that when you're feeling calm, comfortable, tranquil and 
peaceful maybe even a little drowsy and sleepy that the gatekeeper hasn’t 
got its usual function, doesn't quite get into gear properly.   
 
When you relax the body, the mind tends to follow.  The gatekeeper requires 
some kind of vigor and level of energy to keep going and do its thing.  A 
great way of silencing him is to relax the body and switch on what’s called 
the parasympathetic nervous system.   
 
This creates a simpler or more direct route to the emotional part of the 
brain, which is basically where the unconscious mind does a lot of its work 
and through that filter you get to do your self-hypnosis. 
 
In order to silence the gatekeeper you can increase your attention, change 
your timing and/or you can combine these together, you can learn to relax 
your body to such a degree that your mind relaxes with it and creates a 
direct connection to the levels of the brain that you want to be working with. 
 
In the next track, we’ll talk a little about the whole state thing and then we’ll 
show you how to create that moment of relaxation any time, any place, 
anywhere.   
 
 
Track 5 – How To Nail The State Gremlin 
Time: 8m 29s 
 
 
Finally, let’s look at the idea of state.   
 
What if you can’t get yourself into the right state of mind?   
 
What if you can’t get into this relaxed, comfortable drifting state?   
 
Relaxation Is NOT The Only PSH State 
First of all, realize there are many different states, in which you can do self-
hypnosis. Relaxation is just one of them.  In my opinion, it’s one of the 
easiest and best partly because it has so many wonderful other side effects.

Discover The Benefits Of A Focused Relaxation State 
Focused relaxation is one of the most natural defenses to stress and all the 
illness it can cause.   
 
Stress can cause neuroses, psychological problems and insomnia.  It can 
also cause physical problems: pain, ulcers, kidney stones and other things 
can be caused by stress.   
 
By using relaxation as the gateway to not only shut down the gatekeeper, 
but also open the opportunity to communicate directly with your own 
unconscious mind, you're doing a lot of things at the same time.   
 
The Deep Relaxation Cycle 
On the next track I’m going to guide you through a whole process, taking 
you systematically through relaxing your entire body, from the top of your 
head to the tips of your toes.  You will probably be more relaxed than you’ve 
been in your entire life.   
 
This is like spending a day at a spa rejuvenating from top to bottom.  It’s a 
fantastic exercise.  You can listen, follow along and this is a better version so 
listen to it a few times and do it yourself.   
 
The 15 Relaxation Points 
Essentially you're going to be going through 15 points of your body.  You’ll 
move your attention to 15 different points of your body and relaxing those.   
 
You can expand those points to up to 50.  You can contract them down to 
four or five.  The number is not relevant; we're going to use 15, because 
we’ll focus on the major muscle groups inside the body and learning to relax 
those.   
 
The way I’ll run you through the exercise will work for about 90% of the 
population – which is basically:  
 
1. Is your attention focused on it,  
2. Relax it and  
3. Move through that.

Just by the fact that you're focusing on the different parts of the body, I’ll 
show you how to trigger naturally the relaxation response.   
 
How To Beat Even Chronic Tension 
That doesn't take care of the 10% of the population that have what’s called 
“Chronic Tension”, in other words, they're totally tense all the time and they 
don’t know how to relax.   
 
Use The Power Of Tension-Release Cycles 
If you find yourself in this category, there is a very simple solution they're 
called Tension-Release Cycles.   
 
Basically, your body works by antagonism.  In other words to go one way 
you go the other way first. Tell your body, which way to go.  Like a 
pendulum, if you pick a pendulum up on the right hand side, lift it all the 
way up and then let go, it swings all the way to the other side, the left side. 
 
This is what we're going to do with your body.   
 
You're going to tense your body, just do this for a moment.  Take your fist 
and tense your fist.  Squeeze nice and hard.  Squeeze it harder than you’ve 
ever squeezed it for you in your entire life.  Do it now.  Squeeze it nice and 
hard.   
 
As soon as you're ready let it go and relax it completely.  Relax it 
completely.  As you release the tension your body will begin to relax already.   
 
Why?   
 
Because you can’t hold that fist clenched totally all the time – you’ll run out 
of steam.   
 
Surf The Wave Of Relaxation Deeper Inside 
As you begin to unclench the fist or relaxing the fist you're already doing the 
process of relaxation.  That means your body knows what to do now.  You're 
going to surf on that wave and take it deeper than you would normally go 
otherwise.

By tensing something and relaxing it your body realizes “Oh this is what you 
want.”  By focusing on that quality that happens after you begin to relax the 
tension that you put in artificially, you get to ride that to even deeper levels 
of relaxation.   
 
You Can Use Tension-Release Cycles During The Deep Relaxation Cycle 
On the next track for example – on your head, eyes, tongue, mouth 
whatever I’m asking you to focus on – when I ask you to focus on a 
particular part of your body:  
 
1. If you're in the 90%, just focus your attention there and when I tell 
you to relax it, it will relax naturally, easily and comfortably.    
 
2. If you find yourself not able to do that, go back to the beginning of the 
recording and when I say focus on your arms, take that as your cue to 
tense your arms, tense it up as if you're lifting a heavy weight and 
when I say “focus on your arms, sense the relaxation, feel it relax,” 
then just relax it and genuinely feel it relax.   
 
Feel that relaxation and deepen that relaxation.   
 
Use this same recording to guide you through those steps.  Most people 
won’t need the tension release cycle.  If you want to do it, by all means do 
so. It’s not going to harm you in any way, but you don’t need it.   
 
If you do need it then just use the word “focus” as your trigger point – when 
I say it, you get to tense…  
 
And when I tell you to “focus on the relaxation” that’s when you release it 
and allow the relaxation to drift through that part of the body and even 
deeper than it was before.   
 
Focused Relaxation Eliminates All The Gremlins! 
At that point, you have all the constituents you need.  You’re in the right 
state, because you're triggering physical relaxation and that creates the 
mental relaxation you need to create the context for trance.   
 
You're triggering the position or the part of the neurology, in which your 
gatekeeper is not accustomed to working so it’s a little harder for him to

interfere, because you’ve been relaxing him into silence.  Of course, because 
you're switching attention from place to place your attention gets a cycle 
and your concentration gets improved as well.   
 
Insider Self-Hypnosis Secret: It’s Good To Drift 
Here’s something you should know:  If, during the course of this exercise, 
your attention wanders that’s fine.  Remember, the final stage of the whole 
self-hypnosis process is to drift so you’ve just reached that stage already.   
 
If you’ve put a pre-hypnotic suggestion in for example, mastering the power 
of self-hypnosis, then drifting is no problem at all.   
 
Avoid Negative States 
It’s only a problem if you go somewhere negative, more attention, 
distracting thoughts that sort of thing.   
 
If that happens, listen to whatever other area we're focusing on and go right 
back to your relaxation cycles focusing on different parts of your body.   
 
The 15 Points Of The Deep Relaxation Cycle 
The 15 parts of the body we’ll be focusing on starting with: 
 
1. The hands, first your left hand and then right hand. 
2. Then your arms, left & right.   
3. Shoulders.  
4. Neck, and then we’ll move up to…  
5. Your mouth.  Your mouth has a lot of muscles and has a lot of 
neurons in there, which sense the environment, so you can relax your 
mouth…  
6. And tongue.   
7. Then your eyes, which are a great place to relax, so you can start 
with your eyes closed.  If you start with your eyes open, at the very 
point when you start relaxing the eyes, close the eyes.  Although I 
would recommend that you close your eyes right from the beginning 
and relax the eyes even more when we get to that point. 
8. We’ll focus on the chest, which means breathing deeply and evenly.

With that happy thought, let’s move on to the next track where I’ll guide you 
through an extended, deep relaxation process, which will train your

need to.   
 
 
Track 6 – Exercise: The Deep Relaxation Cycle 
Time: 36m 24s 
 
 
Find a comfortable position.  You can lie down for this if you want or sit 
somewhere comfortably.  As soon as you're comfortable take a deep breath.  
Close your eyes, breathe out, relax, clear your mind. 
 
Now we're going to cycle your awareness.  Your awareness is going to teach 
your body how to relax.  As your body relaxes your mind will relax deeply 
and comfortably, which means you’ll be in the perfect state for self-
hypnosis.   
 
Throughout the course of this recording, as you continue to learn how to 
relax and trigger the natural relaxation response, I want you to realize that 
your unconscious mind can simultaneously ensure that you get to master 
the power of self-hypnosis for your life.   
 
So the deeper you relax the more you're mastering the power of self-
hypnosis.  The more you enjoy the process, the more your mind opens up 
into an infinite field of possibilities where you get to make anything happen 
in your life.

Track 7 – Now Become A Master Of Relaxation 
Time: 1m 15s 
 
 
Welcome back again.   
 
How To Practice The Full 15 Point Cycle 
Now you’ve been through the complete 15-stage cycle, feel free to take 
yourself through that.  I recommend that you do it maybe once or twice in 
the next couple of weeks.   
 
After that, do the whole deep relaxation cycle, once a month for a while to 
engrain the experience.   
 
After a while the moment of closing your eyes with the intent of doing a 
deep relaxation cycle your whole body will sink into this wonderful state of 
comfort and relaxation so that within minutes you‘ll be in the same place 
that took you hours before to reach.   
 
Now Master The Quick Relax Induction 
If you want to do this in the quick cycle, remember that in bonus one, we 
have a particular four-stage cycle that takes these 15 stages into four very 
quick body areas.  You get to focus on:  
 
1. Your legs,  
2. The trunk of your body,  
3. Your arms and shoulders and  
4. Finally, face and head.   
 
As you focus on each of those areas the whole sense, the memory of how 
comfortable you relaxed in this experience or the one you just had will flood 
into your whole system again and you can recall it and have it all over again.   
 
If you want to get good at this practice it.  The more you practice it the 
easier it becomes and the more success you’ll draw out of it.

Track 2 – The Cryptic Alphabet System 
Time: 12m 23s 
 
 
Welcome to the third bonus CD.   
 
On this CD we're going to look at how to make the most of your power 
pendulum by adding a couple of bells and whistles.  In particular, I want to 
introduce you to the idea of the cryptic alphabet system.   
 
If you’ve been using the power pendulum to this point, you’ll notice that it 
has a limit it can only talk about yes and no questions, making it a long 
tedious process to get to the answer.   
 
Whilst it‘s useful to start this way and I will always recommend that you go 
straight to yes/no questioning first as part of the warm-up process, I’d like 
to introduce you to another system.   
 
How To Go Beyond Yes/No Questions 
A new way of using the pendulum, which will allow you to get the 
unconscious mind to literally spell out the solution or cause over deliver the 
problem, so you can go straight to the root of what’s going on.   
 
The method we’ll use is something that I’ve adapted from the work of 
hypnotist Charles Henderson.  It’s an ingenious idea of using a Cryptic 
Alphabet System from Cryptology as a way of getting the pendulum to spell 
out words, sentences and clues, etc.   
 
It’s a beautiful bit of work.  It’s been adapted so it’s not quite the same way 
as Henderson’s version is, but hopefully you’ll find it very useful and quick to 
grasp.

Cryptology – The Science Of Keeping Secrets 
The essence of getting the unconscious mind to spell something out for you 
using the pendulum is going to rely on a field called cryptology.  Back in the 
ancient days whenever people had Court Intrigues – or in particular during 
wars – messages would be of vital importance for tactical reasons.   
 
Of course, no one wanted those messages to be intercepted because they 
could get in trouble for that or if the enemy knew what you were up to then 
you can imagine what the consequences would be.  So they started coming 
up with devices, ways of hiding the message in a way no one could read 
them if it fell into the wrong hands.   
 
The Substitution Cipher For Secret Messages 
We're talking basically about codes and ciphers.   
 
The simplest code is called a Substitution Cipher where you take letters of 
the alphabet and you put a symbol in place of the letter.  You might have 
pictures, numbers and instead of the letter ‘A’ you’d have the number one.  
Instead of the letter ‘B’ you’d have the number 2 and so on.   
 
Then you write out your message and substitute for every letter, the 
number, so if the wrong person gets the message they’ll see  
 
122579  
 
whatever and don’t actually know what the message is, because they don’t 
know how to translate the cipher.   
 
Of course, codes can be broken, but that’s another story entirely.   
 
The Polybius Square As A Cryptic Alphabet System 
We’re going to take a very simple cipher, from a man called Polybius, called 
the Polybius Square.  It’s one of the simplest ciphers to get a hold of and it 
very quickly translates the Roman alphabet that we're used to into two digit 
numbers.

When you look at the cryptic alphabet system you’ll notice there’s a square 
there, the Polybius Square, with the numbers one through five on the top 
row and one through five on the column going down.   
 
How To Read The Cryptic Alphabet Cipher 
Inside the square you have all the letters from ‘A’ to ‘Z’.  If you want to 
change one of the letters in the alphabet into a natural number you just look 
at the letter, check across for example:  
 
‘A’ is 11, one and one.   
If you go for ‘H’, it’s 23, two and three and so on.

The way we’ll use this is we’ll get the pendulum to swing twice in a particular 
direction.  As a result it will give us two numbers, when we have those two 
numbers we go to our table and look it up.   
 
Let’s say the pendulum swings in the direction for the number three for 
example.  We did it again and the next time the pendulum moves in the 
direction of the four which gives us a number of 34.   
 
Looking at our Polybius Square, move across from the number three and up 
to number four so we stop at the ‘O’.  
 
So 34 gives us the ‘O’:

Dealing With The I/J Problem 
Let’s pause for a moment on that ‘I’ or ‘J’, because that’s important.   
 
Notice how we use them interchangeably.  Most words, if you have an ‘I’ in 
it, if you put a ‘J’ in it you can pretty much instantly distinguish, which one 
of the two it will be, so this is a device taken from the classical period where 
the letter ‘J’ didn't exist there was always just an ‘I’.

We’re going to borrow this device for its simplicity sake.  If you have any 
trouble to distinguish between whether it’s an ‘I’ or a ‘J’, for example, is it 
the name Ian or Jan, at that point you can ask a yes/no question.   
 
Do you mean an ‘I’?  Yes.   
 
Do you mean a ‘J’?  No.   
 
That clears it up, but typically it will be evident when you come across to the 
answer right away.   
 
How To Use The Cryptic Alphabet System To Speak To Your Unconscious 
Now the question is: How do we use this Polybius Square as a cryptic 
alphabet system to get the unconscious mind to spell things out?   
 
First comes the training phase and after the training phase comes a using 
phase.

Step 1: Get A Number For Every Swing 
The first thing to do is establish a set of swings for numbers.  Again, look at 
the bonus section again to see a very simple diagram with five direction 
swings.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You have… 
 
1. forward and backward,  
2. side to side,  
3. one diagonal,  
4. a second diagonal and  
5. a clockwise rotation  
 
Each one of those represents a number.   
 
1. Forward and backward is a number one.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         381
2. Diagonally on the one angle is a number two.   
3. Side to side is number three.   
4. Diagonally on the downward angle is number four.   
5. Rotating in the clockwise direction is number five.   
 
If it rotates in the counter clockwise direction (number six) then that would 
be beyond what we need to do here.  It tells the unconscious mind what’s 
going on here, there’s something else going on its distracting or blocking in 
some way.   
 
Step 2: Ask For The Numbers 
The first thing to do is to train the unconscious mind to give you a one, two, 
three, four or five.  So focus on number one and say  
 
 Give me a one- one, one, one; great.   
 Give me a two-two, two, two, great.   
 Give me a three- three, three, three…  
 
And so on.   
 
Once you can get the numbers one through five reliably presented by the 
unconscious mind you simply start practicing how to spell out words.   
 
Step 3: Spell Out Words 
Let’s take the word cat.  Spell the word cat using the pendulum on your 
own.  To do that you’ll need the ‘C’, the ‘A’ and the ‘T’.  The ‘C’ is number 
13, the ‘A’ is number 11 and the ‘T’ is number 44.  Those are your numbers, 
one three, one one and four four.

That is the cryptic alphabet system translation of the word ‘CAT’ in a way 
that the pendulum could swing that way.   
 
Step 4: Practice With Conscious Swings 
Go ahead, swing it yourself purposefully and consciously to show the 
unconscious mind what to do.   
 
You’ll go forward and backward and you now have number one.   
Then you’ll go side to side for number three.

Then we’ll go back to forward and backward to number one and  
Then forward and backward again, to number one   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Four is the downwards diagonal so you go one diagonal and then again, 
another downwards diagonal  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
And now you have one three, one-one, four-four, so you spelled out the 
word cat.

Practice 
Notice this is quite a longwinded process to get the letters and that’s just the 
way it has to be.   
 
It’s a lot quicker of course or particularly if you’ve been using the yes/no 
questions and you haven’t made any headway after a while, this is a very 
quick way to get a simple response from your unconscious mind.   
 
Before you go down that road it’s definitely worthwhile getting the yes/no 
questions to first to warm up the unconscious mind and show that you're 
serious.   
 
Step 5: Get The Unconscious Mind To Find Letters 
Once you spelled out a few words like cat, tree, bark or whatever you decide 
on consciously so you get used to the system on your own, the next stage is 
to get the unconscious mind to spell words that you know already exist. 
 
Now you get the unconscious mind to spell the word ‘CAT’.   
 
You say we're going to spell the word cat.  Start with the first letter.  Start 
with the ‘C’.   
 
 
Give me a ‘C’.  Give me a ‘C’.  Give me a ‘C’.   
It will start with the number one and then it will give you another, number 
three; great.   
 
Now give me an ‘A’, give me an ‘A’, give me an ‘A’,  
 
So you're slowly but surely training the unconscious mind to give you a CAT 
and so on.   
 
Step 6: Get The Unconscious Mind To Spell Words & Clues 
Once you can do individual letters you can move on to actual words.   
 
Once you can do a whole word you can start turning the Polybius Square 
into a whole system for questioning the unconscious mind to give you clues 
about whatever problem you're investigating.

Beware The Unconscious Trickster 
Here’s how the unconscious mind responds.  It won’t necessarily always 
spell things correctly.  It won’t necessarily always give you the answer you 
want right away, so you’ll have to do a bit of work.  Start off with yes/no 
questions purely, because the unconscious mind often wants you to do some 
work.   
 
It’s kind of its way of making sure you're ready to handle the information 
that it’s going to present to you.  If, say, after a few frustrating hours, days 
or weeks of working on the same thing you haven’t got a resolution yet. 
 
Then say okay.  Let’s go for the alphabet system.  Unconscious mind, I want 
you to give me a word or a short phrase that will give me a clue or 
summarize what this is all about.   
 
Simple Clues  
At this point you can get all kinds of answers.  You might get a one word 
answer like the word “Bob”, which refers to your best friend Bob at school, 
which in turn triggers the memory of how you guys had a fight and never 
saw each other again.   
 
Anagrams 
It might on the other hand, give you an anagram so it might be a jumble of 
letters.   
 
It might give you “B B O” and you have to work out what that means.  Is it 
an anagram, acronym, hint of some sort or is it something you have to 
rearrange and get the words, which would trigger that memory? 
 
A Code Within A Code  
It can work many different ways.  Sometimes you’ll get a bunch of nonsense 
letters in which case you have to find out what these letters mean.  So 
sometimes the unconscious mind gives you a code within a code.  It has all 
kinds of ways of hiding the information so that your unconscious mind can’t 
quite grasp it right away.

The reason for that is to protect your conscious mind.  Sometimes your 
conscious mind isn’t ready for the information right away.  This is like 
peeling layers off of the onion away, peeling layers of protection away until 
the time when your mind is ready to deal with whatever information it has, 
at which point the message will be revealed.   
 
Train Yourself In The Use Of The Cryptic Alphabet System 
We’ll talk a little more about persistence and how to deal with unconscious 
resistance later in this bonus session, but for now get used to first of all, 
getting the numbers.  For now get used to getting the numbers turned into 
letters so you can start spelling words out and get the unconscious mind to 
start spelling things out for you.   
 
Then, you can use this as a stop-gap measure if everything else you're doing 
isn’t working to get the unconscious mind to give you a clue in the form of a 
name, phrase, anagram, acronym or some kind of a coded clue that will take 
you towards where you need to go.   
 
Bear in mind that there will be times when you need to have clues about the 
clues the unconscious mind is giving you so you’ll have to play with it a little 
bit and have patience, work through methodically and steadily.   
 
Don’t turn to this as a quick cure-all instantly.  Go through the whole yes/no 
questioning system first.  Sometimes it works out quicker – I don’t know 
why– sometimes the unconscious mind isn’t ready to spell anything out to 
you until you’ve shown the effort of the other system before you go in that 
direction. 
 
Once you’ve mastered this, move on to the next track where we’ll talk about 
questioning strategies you can use to improve the outcomes you can get.  In 
other words, how do you take the basic question strategies we introduced to 
you in day five and evolve that into a slightly more sophisticated system so 
you know what things you're looking for along the way?

Track 3 – Discover Deeper Insights Into The Questioning Strategy 
Time: 6m 57s 
 
 
Welcome back.   
 
The Five Magic Questions 
The first thing we’ll look at in terms of the questioning strategy is those five 
magic questions that we introduced to you before.   
 
 How?   
 When?   
 Who?   
 Where?   
 What?   
 
I want to look at these in a bit more detail now.  Each of those questions is 
designed to come up with a specific kind of information that will give you 
clues as to what you're trying to achieve or where you need to go to get the 
answer you're looking for.   
 
Those questions are in that sequence for a reason.  Let me talk you through 
the sequence and explain why.   
 
Magic Question 1: How – Find The Imprint 
The how question looks for an imprint.   
 
Let’s take this in conceptual terms, what we’re looking to change the 
blueprint.   
 
What is the blueprint?   
 
Discover The Imprints That Control Your Life 
It’s a bunch of imprints, things that have been written down in a mental 
document that say, here’s how life is going to be and that information had to 
get there somehow, that’s called an imprint.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         388
It’s when you have an experience as a child, someone says something to 
you, you see something, experience something, decide something and at 
that point you think that’s how the world is or that’s how I am in the world.   
 
As a result that gets locked into your blueprint and if you don’t go back and 
correct that area that’s where it stays.  Sometimes your blueprint gets 
amended as you go through life it happens automatically that’s how nature 
works.   
 
Sometimes it doesn't.  If it doesn't that’s what the power of self-hypnosis is 
there for, to be able to change it as you need to given the situation you're 
facing.   
 
The ‘How’ question is about:  
 
 How did this happen?   
 Was this an imprint?   
 Was it something about myself or my environment?   
 What kind of event occurred that caused this imprint to exist?   
 
We're going to look at the different kinds of imprints in a moment.   
 
Magic Question 2: When – Orient In Time (A Dissociated Regression) 
The next question is ‘When’.   
 
This orients you at a point in time.   
 
 When did this happen?   
 Did it happen when I was two, five, ten, 50 years old?   
 
This orients a point in time.  ‘When’ questions are very easy to answer, 
because you can use the pendulum and the numbering system – a nd we’ll 
talk about that method later in this session.   
 
You can navigate backwards in time until you find the time period that the 
problem occurred on.  
 
Magic Question 3: Who – Who Caused The Imprint? 
The ‘Who’ question is all about what people are there.

Typically, it’s other people that put ideas inside our heads when we're unable 
to defend ourselves, either, because we're too young or too mentally 
distracted in another state, so those ideas tend to stick.   
 
It could be  
 
 Something you heard on TV,  
 Something somebody said to you,  
 An experience you had,  
 Sometimes it’s something you do to yourself in terms of self-talk.   
 
It’s very important to find out who is there, because then you get to find out 
it’s something they said to you or something you did to yourself that caused 
this imprint.   
 
1. We’ve got the how, which is what type of imprint is it.   
2. We’ve got the when or age when it all happened.   
3. We’ve got the who, the players.   
 
The Guessing Game – Trust Your Instincts 
Incidentally, for the ‘Who’, you'll have to trust a bit of instinct and start 
doing a guessing game.  The guessing game for the ‘Who’ is straightforward, 
in the sense that there is a list of usually suspects you want to trot out in the 
beginning.   
 
The Usual Suspects List 1: Parents 
On the top of the list are our parents: mother and father or legal guardians, 
whoever looked after you when you were growing up.  These are responsible 
for a huge amount of imprints in our lives.   
 
The Usual Suspects List 2: Immediate Family & Friends 
The next layer will be immediate family brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts and 
cousins or people you had a lot of contact with especially when you were 
very young.   
 
You can start cycling through them and naming them.

 Is it my mother?   
 Is it my father?   
 Is it my brother Bob?   
 Is it my brother Alfred?   
 Is it my sister Charlie?   
 Is it my cousin Alfred?   
 
It doesn't matter.  Start cycling through those to figure out who was 
present.   
 
The Usual Suspects List 3: Social Circles 
The next layer of usual suspects is friends and neighbors.  When you know 
the period you’ll know what kind of people you were in contact with at that 
time.   
 
The Usual Suspects List 4: Colleagues & Peers 
The next list will be colleagues and peers.  If it’s work time, who did you go 
to work with?  If it’s school time, who were you at school with?  Who do you 
socialize with even if they weren’t necessarily close friends that sort of 
thing?   
 
The Usual Suspects List 5: Other Influencers 
Finally we have other influences.  We're talking about people on TV, films 
you saw, books you’ve read, radio announcements, random strangers on the 
street shouting something, which somehow affected you that kind of stuff.   
 
That is the list of usual suspects and who’s.   
 
Magic Question 4: Where – Further Orient In Time & Space 
Now we're going to look at where.   
 
Where is the physical location?  You want to orient into a location, because it 
gives you clues again as to the all important ‘What’.  
 
You're interested in what happened so you can fix that, but all these other 
things are part of the memory trace, little bits that give you clues.

So by the time you figure out how, when, who and where all this occurred it 
will trigger off a memory of what happened.  Then you can fix the ‘What’ and 
change whatever happened. So you can get on and live your life freely and 
happily.   
 
You want to find a location.  Once you know who was present and when it 
was it will give you a good idea of where it occurred.  If it’s your cousin 
Alfred and you only see your cousin Alfred once a year at Christmas then 
you're sure it’s going to be at Christmas. 
 
If you know it’s a Christmas when you were 15 years old then you can guess 
it was at your home or Alfred’s home, because you went there that year.   
 
Again, see how each layer of questions gives you clues as to what the next 
layer of questions should be?  It restricts the experiences to a certain range 
and makes it easier for you to guess accurately as to what is happening. 
 
Magic Question 5: What – The Root Of The Problem 
Finally, the fifth layer of questioning is the ‘What’.   
 
This is where you find the content.  This is the payoff and what you're 
looking for.   
 
 What actually happened?   
 What was said?   
 How did I react to it?   
 How did I feel?   
 What was the blueprint as a result of this thing?   
 
If Cousin Alfred told you that you had a big, ugly nose at Christmas when 
you were eight years old and you ran up and cried up in your room, great.  
Now you know what happened.  You know the imprint, the belief that 
happened around it and how to change it.   
 
Use self-hypnosis to say  
 
I don’t have a big nose.  My face has grown a lot bigger since then and now 
my nose matches it perfectly, thank you very much.   
 
This gives you a strategy of getting to that point.

On the next track we’ll look at each of those stages and how to get a bit 
more nuances out of that.   
 
For the moment, think of those five magic questions and the sequence that’s 
been created, because the sequence will give you clues to the next step and 
what to go for in that step. 
 
 
Track 4 – How To Investigate The Imprint 
Time: 33m 41s 
 
 
Let’s focus a little on the how, particularly the imprint stage.  What is the 
kind of thing that happens inside our mind so we can start filtering the kind 
of experiences we're looking for?   
 
The 2 Big Players 
Essentially we're looking for two big players and four particular emotions.  
The four big players are – first of all, beliefs and emotions are the two big 
players.  
 
The 2 Beliefs 
Beliefs can be split in two.  
 
 Beliefs about yourself  
 Beliefs about the world   
 
For example, an imprint can be that you don’t think that the world is a safe 
place so you become more claustrophobic as a result.   
 
A belief about the external world could be things like “Having money is the 
root of all evil.” So the unconscious mind doesn't like you having money, 
which might be the root of where all of your wealth problems come from.   
 
A belief might be about you as well.

© 2008 Street Hypnosis              www.StreetHypnosis.com                         393
For example, you don’t deserve the money or having love.  It might be a 
mixture of the two.  It could be that you don’t deserve this and if you try 
bad things will happen to you.  Notice how beliefs can be external, the world 
at large or internal and about you and your capabilities.   
 
The 4 Emotions 
There are four emotions to look out for.  These are the big and usual 
suspects in terms of what happened in the imprint or how the imprint got 
set.   
 
1. Fear,  
2. Anger,  
3. Shame and  
4. Guilt   
 
Each of those four emotions is designed to do something beneficial for you in 
a different way.  By the way, each is also very beneficial when it arises in 
the context it’s designed for and then leaves again, importantly, when it’s 
achieved its purpose. 
 
Let’s look at the purpose of those four emotions so that you can go beyond 
the intention of it and start releasing emotions whenever you find them.   
 
How To Deal With Fear 
 
Fear Has A Purpose 
Fear is ultimately a protective emotion and is designed to prevent you from 
having some harm come to you in the future.  You can never be afraid of 
something in the past, you can only be afraid of something that can happen 
in the future.   
 
How Fear Works 
The way people frighten themselves about the past is to project a past event 
into the future and expect it to happen again.  That’s where the past starts 
haunting us and we create fear towards the future, so fear is all about 
protecting you from harm.

If you find an imprint event that’s filled with fear there are a couple of 
solutions.   
 
Solution 1: No Harm Will Come 
Present suggestions to yourself along the lines that no harm will come of it.  
In other words, you will have positive events coming instead.   
 
Solution 2: Integrate Life Lessons That Make Fear Redundant 
If it’s something, which was very specific to a certain situation or a time in 
your life, let’s say you were in an awkward situation and you were fearful as 
a result, you can have suggestions along the lines of “That was appropriate 
for then, but not appropriate for now.”   
 
Let’s say that you’ve become big and strong and more able to take care of 
yourself, you don’t need that fear anymore.   
 
For example, if someone is afraid of crossing the road.  Maybe as a child 
they may have tried crossing the road and almost got run over by a car or 
maybe did get bumped by a car and now they have a morbid fear of all 
vehicles.   
 
As an adult that person no longer needs that fear.  Why?  They're bigger, 
smarter; they know how to cross the road by looking left and right and not 
get hit by a car it’s a natural thing we do.   
 
You can even drive a car and learn to drive it safely.  Millions upon millions, 
probably billions of people on this planet are doing it every single day quite 
happily and safely.  As an adult you can have a different relationship to the 
same situation you did as a child; hence, you can let go of fear and move on 
with life.   
 
It’s very important to know the logic of it. The point of understanding the 
cause of fear is so you can use a suggestion to target the logic and say to 
the unconscious mind, “I don’t need that fear anymore, because of these 
reasons so you can let go of it now.“  
 
How To Deal With Anger 
The same is true with anger.

The Purpose Of Anger 
Anger is also kind of a protective emotion.  Anger protects you from some 
kind of infringement of your boundary.  Anger is designed to give you a kick 
up the backside to do something about something that is off in terms of your 
life, something that is unfair.   
 
You’ve been treated unfairly, you’ve been look down on in some way, 
someone is encroaching on your time or emotion too much, you’re being 
taken advantage of and these are all personal encroachments on you.  
Someone is taking your personal boundary and violating it.   
 
Anger is designed to push the violator over to the other side again.   
 
Why Fear Can Lead To Anger 
This is one of the reasons, for example why fear can often turn to anger.  If 
fear is a protective emotion, let’s say someone is harming you, you're afraid 
of that person. At some point you might become angry at that person – and 
anger is designed to push that person away from you, off the boundary, so 
they stop hurting you.   
 
How To Use Anger As An Ally 
Anger can be a useful emotion at the right point.  The point about anger is 
that its meant to be a flash in the pan.  It can get you kick started and 
motivated to do something and once you start doing it you won’t need the 
anger anymore now you have determination to see you through.   
 
How To Deal With An Anger Imprint 
So, if anger is the imprint and emotion that’s latent in that point in time then 
you can say 
 
“Great, it was useful to have the anger then I don’t need it now.  I don’t 
need it anymore to be happy and healthy in my life.  That situation is no 
longer happening in my life” 
 
Or when people start doing things there are other ways for me to cope.  As 
an adult for example, being assertive overcomes many infringements of your

personal boundaries.  Many people who try and take advantage of you, you 
can politely say to them, no and suddenly you don’t need the anger any 
more.   
 
At that point you can cut out the anger by simple suggestions saying “That’s 
how it used to be and this is how it is now.  I don’t need the anger, because 
I can protect myself and look after my boundary in different ways.”   
 
If you're unconscious mind knows that you're taking that seriously and 
actually doing it, it no longer needs to remind you on the anger needlessly; 
hence, everyone is happy.   
 
How To Deal With Guilt 
Let’s look at shame and guilt for a moment, which are twin sisters they're 
related emotions.   
 
The Unconscious Temple Of Your Moral Code 
To understand shame and guilt we need to understand one of the functions 
of the unconscious mind, which is store your wisdom, morality and ethics.  
So your unconscious mind is a moral being.   
 
Conflicts With Your Internal Code Cause Shame & Guilt 
If in some way you have an imprint about how things should be, a standard 
of ethics and you don’t live up to it for yourself, your unconscious mind will 
punish you in some way usually by shame and guilt to prevent you from 
doing that again.   
 
Let’s say you have a belief about the world that you should treat people 
nicely that’s a good belief to have.  Again, say you were short with someone 
and snapped or shouted at them.   
 
If this is a very strong belief that you can only be nice to people (not 
necessarily a healthy belief to have – that you can only be nice to people), 
but let’s say you have the imprint that you can only be nice to people so it’s 
a belief about the world and yourself, kind of a mix of the two and you’ve 
not been nice to someone in particular.

Maybe you were angry with them, because they took advantage of you, now 
you have a conflict.  Two different levels of your blueprint, one the anger bit, 
which is a natural, instinctual blueprint of self preservation and the other 
one, the imprint about being nice to people.   
 
There’s a conflict there and as a result you feel guilty, because you're falling 
below the standards set inside your blueprint, which is to always be nice to 
everyone.   
 
The Problem With Guilt 
So if you start feeling guilty now, the problem with guilt is if you're stuck in 
guilt, it doesn't help you very much.  You don’t have a much better quality of 
experience and the other person is not going to necessarily either.  The point 
of guilt is that you don’t repeat the mistake again; you learn from it and get 
to move on. 
 
How To Release Guilt 
If you find guilt at the root of something the key to guilt is forgiveness; 
recognizing that you can learn the lesson, you won’t repeat the mistake and 
you’ll move on or to recognize that the thing you're feeling guilty about has 
no reason, there is no reason for you to be guilty about that.  
 
Again, a nice classic example of that is a lot of sexual relations particularly in 
the western world where sex is still a big taboo for us.  So for a lot of people 
some kind of sexual relationship can be guilt ridden, not, because you’ve 
done anything wrong, but because you think you’ve done something wrong 
at the unconscious level.   
 
At some point you think, I had sex with a person, I shouldn’t have and I feel 
bad about it.  Then you have two options and I would normally take both at 
the same time.   
 
1. One is to overcome the guilt through the idea of forgiveness and 
realize that you're going to learn your lesson and move on.   
 
2. Number two, by adjusting the blueprint that caused the guilt in the 
first place.

In other words, deciding that sex with a particular kind of person – let’s say 
the classic blueprint of no sex before marriage– if you decide it’s okay to 
have sex before marriage and you know this intellectually, but the blueprint 
hasn’t changed yet then you can go inside and change your blueprint to 
reflect your more adult and mature understanding of it.   
 
It doesn't mean you have to do that by the way.  If you decide that 
intellectually it’s the wrong thing to have sex before marriage, by all means 
live your life that way – there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that – but 
then you get to choose it.  The difference is choosing it and it being imposed 
on you.   
 
Update An Old Blueprint That Is Holding You Back 
If you have a particular belief imposed on you when you were young then 
you grow up and you constantly change your mind, but that belief is still at 
some level inside one of the blueprints, then you start having conflicts 
between one layer of the blueprint and the other that of course is where a 
lot of problems are arising from.   
 
Again, notice how looking for this telltale emotion of guilt starts giving you 
some clues as to what to investigate and what to clean up.   
 
How To Deal With Shame 
Shame is very similar as guilt.   
 
The Difference Between Shame & Guilt 
It functions in the same way as guilt; the only difference is that shame has 
to do with external standards whereas guilt has to do with internal 
standards.   
 
 
Guilt is the standard that you set yourself, for yourself and you have 
somehow fallen below.  In shame, there’s some kind of a social standard, 
something that other people expect you to live up to and other people have 
realized that you haven’t lived up to it.   
 
You cannot be ashamed if no one notices you fall below that standard, 
because unless there is an internal standard in which case you have guilt 
and not shame, then there’s no reason for it.  However, if someone catches

or sees you, particularly if someone you admire sees you then of course 
shame occurs.   
 
You can be ashamed in many different ways.  It can be someone who you 
admire, someone you want to like you, a girlfriend, boyfriend, mentor or 
teacher that sort of thing, see you do something, which you think is quite 
okay.   
 
They turn around and say  
 
“That’s not okay!” 
 
So at that point you‘ve been shamed and chances a new imprint will be 
created that that particular standard is no longer allowed.   
 
How Shame Turns To Guilt 
A lot of people then may internalize the standard, so in the future they have 
guilt preventing them from doing that thing and some people just don’t care, 
in which case they carry on with their life anyway.   
 
Some Standards Need To Be Changed 
The key thing I’m trying to drive in is whether you feel shame or guilt either 
way you have to examine the standard that’s being imposed on you.  If you 
agree with the standard then it’s okay to live up to it.  You can then put in 
suggestions about living up to it easily and hence, letting go of the shame 
and guilt.   
 
If, on the other hand, you're not happy with the standard and feel that the 
standard is unfair, then you can change the standard and say “This is not 
appropriate for me and then use self-hypnosis to change that.”   
 
How The ‘How’ Stage Can Lead To Freedom 
Therefore, the ‘How’ stage begins to uncover the basic ballpark areas you’ll 
be investigating.  You’ll be investigating imprints about the world and about 
yourself, what you believe about yourself and the world that might be 
causing these things.

You’ll be investigating the four major emotions.  Is this about fear, anger, 
guilt or shame?  As soon as you find out, which one it is it gives you more 
clues as to what to investigate further.   
 
How do you begin?   
 
You can find out if it’s about belief or an emotion based on that belief.   
 
 Is it about a belief?  Yes.   
 Is it a belief about the world or about myself?   
 Is it a belief about the world?  Yes.   
 Is it a belief about myself?  No. 
 
Now we have a sense of a belief about the world, so we can look at how, 
when and where that belief got set.  We can even look at the consequences.   
 
What are the consequences of that belief?   
Is there one of these major emotions, fear, anger, shame or guilt?   
 
A very quick way of finding out is you can get a scribe and number to each 
one of those four emotions and use the numbering system we talked about 
already to get the pendulum to swing.   
 
1. If it’s about fear say number one.   
2. If it’s about anger number two.   
3. If it’s about shame, number three  
4. and so on.   
 
You can then very quickly diagnose the ‘How’ stage.   
 
 What kind of imprint has been activated and what kind of things are 
going on?   
 Is it a belief about the world or yourself?   
 Is it one of these major emotions? 
 
The minute you know this, finding it out when it happened will be a lot 
easier to figure out who and where the situation happened and finally the 
what, because as soon as you realize, which of those constituents it fits into, 
which part of the box it fits into those memories will be slightly more

Track 5 – How To Navigate Through Time 
Time: 2m 54s 
 
 
Let’s look at the age, the ‘When’ part now.   
 
When we start looking at when we're going to back in time to figure out 
when did this happen.  We're looking at an age;  
 
was I 15, 12, 28 or 93?   
 
It doesn't matter what the age is, but you’re looking for when it happened 
that this particular imprint that’s causing you a problem actually occurred.   
 
Remember, the imprints could be about the world, about you or one of those 
four emotions tied to a belief that’s something is happening.  To find out 
when it happened it’s very simple.   
 
Step 1: Navigate Blocks Of Time (0-10, 11-20, 21-30…) 
You're going to go through your life history in stages.  You can either move 
backwards from the present day or move forward from the beginning of your 
time on this planet and move through that way.   
 
 You can say did it happen in the first ten years of my life?  Yes or no.   
 If it’s no, say okay did it happen somewhere between the age of 10-
20?  No.   
 Did it happen between 20 and 30?  Yes.  
 
Okay now you have an age range somewhere between 20 and 30. 
 
Alternatively, you can go the other way you could say  
 
 Did it happen in the last ten years?  No.   
 In the years 20 to 30?  No.   
 In the years 10 to 20?  No  
 Or in the years 0 to 10?  Yes.   
 
Now you have that age range to work with.

Step 2: Narrow Down Your Funnel 
It doesn't matter, which direction you go at it from.  The point is you're 
going to end up with a ten year age range.  Once you have a ten year age 
range then you start honing it down.   
 
 Was it in the first half or the second half of those ten years?   
 Was it in the first half?  No.   
 Second half?  Yes.   
 
Okay, so now we know it was somewhere between the ages between six and 
ten.   
 
If you notice between the ages of six and ten, you can keep going on and 
actually take each number.   
 
 Was it age six,  
 seven,  
 eight,  
 nine  
 or ten?   
 
You would get a yes or a no for each one of those.   
 
If you are lazy you can use a numbering system.  Say age six is one, age 
seven is two and so on it’s easier if it’s in ages naught to five.  If it was age 
one the one swings, if it’s age two the two swings and so on, whichever way 
you do it, you very quickly get to pinpoint the exact time and age you were.   
 
Further Refinements 
If you want to go a bit more closely in time, once you know the age you can 
start pinpointing the season or the highlights.  Big times to look for are 
things like birthdays, celebrations, Christmas’ and other holidays.  These are 
the big situations to look out for because these the times when bigger things 
tend to happen.   
 
Of course it can happen anywhere, so you can look at the beginning of the 
year, the middle and the end of the year.  Was it summer, winter, spring 
whatever it was then go through the months was it January, February, 
March, etc.

Sometimes it doesn't matter and sometimes it does.  Sometimes it’s enough 
to know the age and you may come back to the month if you get a little 
stuck on the who, where or what phases to get a little more information.  
Sometimes you won’t need to so just carry anyway it’s enough that you 
know your age.   
 
 
 
Track 6 – How To Do Your Detective Work 
Time: 10m 20s 
 
 
The rest is detective work.   
 
The Who – Usual Suspects 
We’ve talked about the who already, the usual suspects being parents first.  
Then close relations, uncles, aunts and siblings.  Then the extended family 
and friends, neighbors and acquaintances, external influences like TV and 
authority figures and so on.  These are the usual suspects to look for the 
who. 
 
The Where – Instincts & Logic 
The where, you have to pay attention to your instincts at that point.  You 
can make guesses.  If you know the age and know where you were for most 
of that year, you can check it out.   
 
 Was it my house or my friend’s house?   
 Was it during holidays or while you were at camp?   
 
Listen to your intuition.  Your gut instinct might flash up an idea or thought 
and that is usually your unconscious mind hinting to you to go this way and 
look at this.  Check it out.  If you get a hint that when you I was 14 and you 
went to band camp, was it there?  Then you can turn around and say was it 
band camp?  Yes; great.

I thought I knew it was band camp and that gives you much more comfort 
you're on the right track.  If it says no then you can try other places it 
doesn't matter.   
 
Persist! 
The key is to persist and keep going with the question strategies.   
 
Unconscious Blocking Manoeuvres 
Somewhere along the way you're likely to come against some kind of form 
unconscious resistance, some effort of the unconscious mind to block you.  
I’d like to detail some of the methods the unconscious mind will typically 
bring up to block you so you recognize them and realize how to deal with 
them.   
 
Blocks Are No Big Deal 
It’s not a big deal if you're being blocked, it’s just a natural defense 
mechanism and you can go through it.  It’s totally safe using these question 
strategies, because you're using an ideodynamic response, which means you 
will never get any more of a response than you're ready to handle at that 
point in your life.   
 
The “Uneasy” Block 
What kind of resistances do you get?  First of all, you might get a sense of 
an uneasy feeling the closer you get to what you're doing.  The more you do 
it you may get a restless or antsy feeling and that’s fine just persist through 
that it will disappear.   
 
That’s your unconscious mind releasing part of the emotion and saying to 
you  
 
Are you sure you want to go to this place?  I’ve been protecting you from 
this for some time now.   
 
If you get an uneasy feeling you know you're on the right track.  Persist 
through it.

The “I Don’t Feel Like It” Block 
Of course, a lot of people give up at that point and say I don't know I don’t 
feel like it today and that’s another defense mechanism.   
 
When you put off the ideas like I don't know, I don’t know what to do, I 
don’t want to do it today that’s your unconscious mind going  
 
Don’t go there.  I’ve protected you from it.  This is something I’m protecting 
you from.  Be careful.  Don’t go there.  I’m redirecting you.  Walk away from 
this.   
 
You get to choose as the conscious mind, as the part that decides what your 
life is all about, as a human being, you get to have choice whether or not 
you go there.  The way you have choice is to say I’m feeling a bit uneasy 
about this, but I’m going to go there anyway.   
 
I’m feeling a little bit like I don’t want to do this, recognize it for what it is 
and say I’m doing it.  At that point, your unconscious mind will realize that 
you're serious I’d better stop pulling the stops out and start doing some 
healing, because this is the bit we need to clear up now.   
 
The “Tiredness” Block 
Another defense is tiredness, which we’ve talked about a little before.  
Tiredness is of two forms.   
 
If You Are Genuinely Tired – Rest 
There’s the genuine physical fatigue, in which case, it’s go to sleep and 
that’s fine.   
 
But Check If Its An Excuse! 
Sometimes and this is quite often the case, tiredness can be a defense 
mechanism like I’m too tired, I don't have any energy.   
 
That’s the unconscious mind giving you an excuse not to do it.  Tiredness at 
that level is in the same place as uneasy feeling, the sense of I don’t want to 
do it now, etc.  It’s just another chain in the defense where the unconscious 
mind is testing you.

Is this guy serious?  Does he really want to do this?  Do you know what 
you're doing?   
 
If you do you’ll persist.  If you don’t, you’ll give up nicely here and I’ll carry 
on protecting you from whatever that was.   
 
Push Yourself – Don’t Let Others Push you! 
I want you to emphasize that.  I do say protecting you, because that’s what 
the unconscious mind considers its task to be.  However, if you persist you 
will only gain insight and information at a rate that is safe for you to handle, 
because you're doing it by yourself.   
 
If someone else was asking the questions, pushing you through the process 
that’s a different story. So don’t let a friend push you through it or ask the 
questions of you as you get the answers on the pendulum, because that can 
work at a different pace.   
 
If you do that, go find a qualified hypnotherapist and let that person ask the 
questions and push you through it, because that person knows where you 
can end up and how to deal with those things at the same time.   
 
Here are a couple of other blocks that your unconscious mind likes to throw 
in your way.  
 
The “Question” Block 
One is called the question block.   
 
The question block is a pure piece of unconscious genius.  Essentially it 
blocks your mind from thinking of any good questions to ask.  Remember, 
you’ve got to ask a question, because you only have yes and no.  It blocks 
your ability to think of good questions so you go around and around in 
circles going, what do I ask now?   
 
The key to that is to recognize as an unconscious blocking mechanism and 
to persist.  Even if you can’t find a good question to ask, ask a dumb 
question, ask any question just keep digging into it.  Ask yourself  
 
 What kind of question can I ask now?

 What can I ask now?   
 What’s the next question I should ask here?   
 
Persist and the question block will evaporate and with it you’ll get much 
closer to the insight.   
 
The “Confusion” Block 
The other side of this coin is confusion or lack of clarity.   
 
You might get an answer or a sense of this is my birthday party when I was 
five years old and I know who’s there and what’s going on, etc.  Suddenly 
you get this tremendous sense of confusion saying  
 
How could this be?   
What is going on here?   
 
I don’t understand or, even if you're using the cryptic alphabet system you 
might get the word spelled out Auntie Mary.  You may say Auntie Mary, I 
don’t understand.   
 
I don't have an Auntie Mary.  Do I have an Auntie Mary?  What’s she trying 
to say to me?   
 
Sometimes it will be much more direct like iguana and you're getting 
confused saying what does this mean; what is this all about?  That confusion 
and again, is a layer in which the unconscious mind is going, don’t go here.  
It’s trying to misdirect you away from the soft spot, which you have to get to 
in order to clean things up.   
 
How do you do that?   
 
You persist - persist – persist you get determined.  When you get confused 
recognize your unconscious mind is on the cusp of presenting you with the 
very information you need so you keep pushing, persisting, demanding, 
asking, cajoling until eventually you come up with the answer that you want 
and understand.   
 
So you get to the answer you need to have, you get to understand the 
answer, it all evaporates and becomes crystal clear in time.

So the question and confusion block are two great strategies the 
unconscious mind has to try and take you off the path.  If you come across 
those that’s a signal that you're on exactly the right track, so whatever 
you're doing keep doing more of that.   
 
The “Instinctive Rejection” Block 
There’s a final red flag to watch out for.  This is an instinctive rejection, a 
gut rejection.   
 
You come up with something and say it can’t be that.  Let’s say you come up 
with the time, you're 15 years old or you had a birthday party or on a date 
with your first girlfriend or boyfriend, you come with the date story and say 
it can’t be that.  
 
I loved that person, it was a great day.   
 
If you're rejecting something that’s come through too quickly, be cautious of 
it.  You may be correct to reject it; it may be the right thing, but I’m saying 
it’s a warning sign that you might be skirting the issue.  Maybe there’s 
something there that you don’t want to look at; because that’s the whole 
reason you were looking at it in the first place.   
 
If you reject information that comes to you out of hand too quickly, be 
suspect of that rapid rejection.  If you think about and consider it, go 
“Maybe or maybe not, whatever it is let’s see if there is something else going 
on that’s okay.”   
 
If it’s a gut rejection like, “This can’t be it!” – that’s too much emotion 
involved.  There’s too much of a response involved and that’s something 
where I’d recommend where you go back and reflect on it a bit more.  You 
might find that with a bit of time and reflection that ends up then to be the 
very thing you should be thinking about and something good has come of it.   
 
Those are the major resistance mechanisms.   
 
Summary Of The Blocking Mechanisms 
To summarize them again,

An uneasy feeling you have, maybe a feeling that you don’t want to do this 
today or “I’ll put it off to another time.“  
 
It could be a sense of being blocked in terms of question confusion or 
confusions toward what the answer means.   
 
Finally, you might end up rejecting information that comes out of hand too 
quickly.   
 
These are all great mechanisms that your unconscious mind has to prevent 
you from getting to the point you're trying to get to.  It thinks it’s doing it to 
protect you and to a certain extent that’s true; however, if you’ve chosen to 
sort out this area of your life and these things are coming up, then go 
through them.   
 
Persist, continue on and know that the resistance will reduce and recede at 
the exact same rate that the unconscious mind can prepare you internally to 
deal with whatever you need to deal with at that point.   
 
Then you carry on through and eventually you get to the point of insight.  
Sometimes that insight is coupled with catharsis, in other words, the 
emotions or the negative belief or negative imprint gets dissolved just by the 
fact that you’ve come to the information itself.   
 
Sometimes the insight gives you the information you need to know what 
kind of suggestions to present to yourself to overcome the problem.  Either 
way you win, but it does require your persistence.  With diligent practice 
though, you will get the results that you want.
