Math has a lot in common with music, dance, and sports. There are skills to be 
learned and a sequence of activities you need to go through if you want to be good 
at it. You don’t just read math, or just listen to math, or even just understand math. 
You do math, and to learn to do it well, you have to practice. That’s why homework 
exists, but most people need more practice than homework provides. That’s where 
Practice Makes Perfect: Trigonometry comes in.
The study of trigonometry starts with material you’ve learned in geometry 
and expands upon it, giving you both more powerful tools for very practical ap-
plications and more analytical approaches to the concepts. It merges all this with 
the skills you acquired in algebra, asking you to think about solving equations 
and graphing functions. The exercises in this book are designed to help you ac-
quire the skills you need, practice each one individually until you have confidence 
in it, and then combine various skills to solve more complicated problems.
You can use Practice Makes Perfect: Trigonometry as a companion to your 
classroom study, for that extra experience that helps you solidify your skills. You 
can use it as a review of concepts you’ve learned previously, whether you’re pre-
paring for an exam or you’re taking an advanced course and feel you need a 
refresher.
With patience and practice, you’ll find that you’ve assembled an impressive 
set of tools and that you’re confident about your ability to use them properly. The 
skills you acquire in trigonometry will serve you well in other math courses, like 
calculus, and in other disciplines, like physics. Be persistent. You must keep work-
ing at it, bit by bit. Be patient. You will make mistakes, but mistakes are one of the 
ways we learn, so welcome your mistakes. They’ll decrease as you practice, be-
cause practice makes perfect.

Trigonometry, or “triangle measurement,” developed as a means to calculate the 
lengths of the sides of right triangles and was based on similar triangle relation-
ships. The fundamental ideas of trigonometry will be extended well beyond right 
triangles, but for now, we’ll look at right triangles and measure the angles in them 
in degrees.
Angle measurement: degrees
The traditional system for measuring angles in geometry is degree measure. The 
measurement of an angle involves the amount of rotation between the two sides 
of the angle. A full rotation, or full circle, is 360°. A half rotation is 180°, the mea-
sure of a straight angle. Because the three angles of any triangle total 180°, each 
angle in the triangle must be less than 180°. Angles that measure less than 90° are 
acute angles, angles of exactly 90° are right angles, and angles greater than 90° 
and less than 180° are obtuse angles.
Two acute angles are complementary if the sum of their measures is 90°. 
Each angle in the pair is the complement of the other. Two angles are supplemen-
tary if their measures total 180°. Each angle is the supplement of the other.

Degrees, minutes, seconds
In geometry, it’s unusual to talk about fractions of a degree, and when you do, it’s usually by a 
simple fraction or a decimal. In trigonometry, you’ll sometimes need a level of precision that can 
only be accomplished by measuring fractions of a degree. While this is sometimes done by frac-
tions or decimals, it’s also common to break a degree into 60 parts called minutes (1° = 60′), and 
a minute into 60 parts called seconds (1′ = 60″ so 1° = 3,600″).

Bearings
Because trigonometry is frequently used in navigation, information about an angle is often given 
in terms of bearings. A bearing first specifies a starting direction, usually north or south, then 
gives a number of degrees (and possibly minutes and seconds) to rotate, followed by the direction 
of rotation. A bearing of N 30° W tells you to start facing north and turn 30° toward the west.

Angle of elevation and angle of depression
In many trigonometry problems, you’ll hear about the angle of elevation or the angle of depres-
sion. If you imagine standing looking straight ahead and then raising your eyes to look up at an 
object, the angle between your original horizontal gaze and your line of sight to the object above 
is the angle of elevation. On the other hand, if you’re in an elevated position, looking straight 
ahead, and shift your gaze down to an object below, the angle between your original horizontal 
gaze and your line of sight to the object below is the angle of depression. Since the horizontal lines 
are parallel, a little basic geometry shows that the angle of elevation is equal to the angle of 
depression.

EXERCISE
Find the specified angle(s).
1.	 From a point 200 yards from the foot of a building, the angle of elevation to the top of the 
building is 37°. Find the measures of the angles of the triangle formed by the building, the 
ground, and the line of sight to the top of the building.
2.	 The angle of depression from the top of a lighthouse to a ship at sea is 12°48′. Find the 
measures of the angles of the triangle formed by the lighthouse, the sea, and the line of 
sight to the ship.
3.	 The angle of depression from the top of a tower to an observer on the ground is 37°. Find 
the angle of elevation from the observer to the top of the tower.
4.	 The ground, a 90 foot tower, and the line of sight to the top of the tower from a point 25 
yards away from the base of the tower form a right triangle. If the acute angles of the 
triangle are 50° and 40°, what is the angle of depression from the top of the tower to an 
observer on the ground?
5.	 From point F, 500 meters from the foot of a cliff, B, the angle of elevation to the top of the 
cliff, T, is 54°27′. From the top of the cliff, T, the angle of depression to a point N, 200 meters 
from the foot of the cliff, is 74°3′. Find the measure of ∠ FTN.
6.	 From a plane P at an altitude of 2,500 feet, a pilot can see a tower 5 miles ahead. The angle 
of depression to the top of the tower, T, is 4°58′ and the angle of depression to the bottom 
of the tower, B, is 5°24′. Find the measure of ∠ PBT.

7.	 From the Top of the Rock, the observation deck at Rockefeller Center (call it T), 850 feet 
above street level, a visitor can look north and see Central Park. If the visitor looks down at 
the northern edge of the park, N, the angle of depression is 2°58′. If the visitor looks to the 
southern edge of the park, S, the angle of depression is 12°57′. Find ∠ NST.
8.	 When ready for launch, the space shuttle, with its fuel tanks, stands 184 feet high. From a 
point level with the launch pad, 1 mile away, the angle of elevation to the highest point of 
the shuttle assembly is 2°. From another point, on the beach south of the launch site, the 
angle of elevation to the highest point of the shuttle assembly is about 0°10′. Find the 
measure of the angle formed by connecting the beach viewing site to the highest point on 
the shuttle to the 1 mile viewing site.
9.	 In ideal weather, from the top of the Eiffel Tower, which stands 324 meters high, it is 
possible to see a point on the horizon 67.5 kilometers away. A tourist at the top of the Eiffel 
Tower on such a perfect day looks out at that distant horizon and the angle of depression is 
0°16′30″. The tourist then shifts his gaze 3°50′30″ to look down at the Jardin du 
Luxembourg, 4.5 kilometers away. What is the angle of depression from the top of the Eiffel 
Tower to the Jardin du Luxembourg?
10.	 The London Eye reaches a height of 135 meters, and from the top, it is possible for a rider to 
see Buckingham Palace, 1.9 kilometers away, at an angle of depression of 4°3′. If a rider at 
the top shifts her gaze up 2°54′, she will be able to see Windsor Castle, 6.6 kilometers away. 
What is the angle of depression from the top of the London Eye to Windsor Castle?
Similar triangles
In geometry, you studied similar triangles. Triangles with corresponding angles congruent and 
corresponding sides in proportion have the same shape but different sizes. They appear as en-
largements or reductions of one another.
Similar right triangles
When you begin to consider similarity in right triangles, you immediately know that the right 
angles are congruent. If you also know that an acute angle of one right triangle is congruent to an 
acute angle of the other, you can be certain that the third angles are congruent as well, and the 
triangles are similar. If the triangles are similar, the corresponding sides are in proportion.
If you look at two right triangles, each with an acute angle of 25°, you can quickly prove that 
the two triangles are similar. In fact, all right triangles containing an angle of 25° are similar, and 
you might think of them as a family. Throughout the family of 25° right triangles, the corre-
sponding sides are in proportion. If you call the legs a and b and the hypotenuse c,
a

If you focus on any two of those ratios, so that you have a proportion, and apply a property 
of proportions that you learned in algebra, you can say

In any right triangle in this family, the ratio of the side opposite the 25° angle to the hypot-
enuse will always be the same; likewise, the ratios of other pairs of sides will remain constant 
throughout the family. Trigonometry takes advantage of that fact and assigns a name to each of 
the possible ratios.
Trigonometric ratios
If the three sides of the right triangle are labeled as the hypotenuse, the side opposite a particular 
acute angle, A, and the side adjacent to the acute angle A, six different ratios are possible. The six 
ratios are called the sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent, and are defined as

Notice that three of the ratios are reciprocals of the other three. The cosecant is the recipro-
cal of the sine, the secant and the cosine are reciprocals, and the cotangent is the reciprocal of the 
tangent. It’s also true that the tangent is equal to the sine divided by the cosine:

cos

A =

A similar argument shows that the cotangent is equal to the cosine divided by the sine.
If ∠ A and ∠ B are the acute angles of right ∆ABC, the side opposite ∠ A is adjacent to ∠ B 
and the side opposite ∠ B is adjacent to ∠ A, but the hypotenuse is always the hypotenuse. This 
means that sin∠ A = BC
AB  = cos∠ B, cos∠ A = AC
AB  = sin∠ B, and tan∠ A = BC
AC  = cot∠ B.
In more general terms, because the two acute angles of a right triangle are complemen-
tary, the sine of an angle is the cosine of its complement, and the tangent of an angle is the 
cotangent of its complement. In fact, the “co” in cosine (and cotangent and cosecant) comes 
from the “co” in complementary. The cosine is the complementary sine, or the sine of the 
complement. The cosecant is the secant of the complement, and the cotangent is the tangent 
of the complement.

Special right triangles
Isosceles right triangles and 30°-60°-90° right triangles pop up in enough different circumstances 
that you probably learned the relationships of the sides by memory. The isosceles, or 45°-45°-90°, 
right triangle has legs of equal length and a hypotenuse equal to that length times the square root 
of 2. If the legs of the isosceles right triangle measure 8 centimeters, the hypotenuse will be 8 2  
centimeters. If the hypotenuse is 14 inches, the legs will be 14

In the 30°-60°-90° right triangle, the shorter leg, opposite the 30° angle, is half as long as the 
hypotenuse, and the longer leg, opposite the 60° angle, is half the hypotenuse times the square 
root of 3. If the hypotenuse is 10 centimeters, the shorter leg is 5 centimeters and the longer leg is 
5 3  centimeters. If you know the shorter side, tack on a 3  to get the longer side but double the 
short leg to get the hypotenuse. If the short leg is 3 centimeters, the longer leg is 3 3  centimeters 
and the hypotenuse is 6 centimeters. To find the other sides when you’re given the longer leg,  
divide by 
3  to get the shorter leg and then double the shorter leg to get the hypotenuse. In a 
30°-60°-90° right triangle with a longer leg of 18 centimeters, the shorter leg is 18

Finding sides
With these six ratios, it is possible to solve for any unknown side of the right triangle, if another 
side and an acute angle are known, or to find the angle if two sides are known. You just need to 
choose a ratio that incorporates the side you know and the side that you want to find, and substi-
tute the values you know. Then you’ll have to look up the sine, cosine, or tangent of the angle. 
Once upon a time, students had to rely on tables to look up the values of the ratios for each family 
of right triangles, but now the sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle can be found with a few key-
strokes on your calculator.

In right ∆ ABC, hypotenuse AC is 6 centimeters long and ∠ A measures 32°. To find the 
length of the shorter leg, first make a sketch to help you visualize the triangle. The shorter leg will 
be opposite the smaller angle. If one of the acute angles is 32°, the other is 58°, so you need to find 
the side opposite the 32° angle, or side BC. If you use the 32° angle, you need a ratio that includes 
the opposite side and the hypotenuse. You can choose between sine (sin) and cosecant (csc), but 
since your calculator has a key for sin but not for csc, sine is more convenient:

Finding angles
In addition to finding the other sides of a right triangle when you know one side and the angle 
measures, trigonometric ratios can be used to find the measures of the acute angles of the right 
triangle if you know the lengths of the sides. Knowing two sides is adequate, because you know 
that the Pythagorean theorem applies to the sides, so you could find the third side if necessary. 
You also know that one of the angles is 90°, so you only need to find one of the acute angles and 
subtract from 90° to find the other.
If you know the lengths of two sides of the right triangle, you can calculate one of the ratios. 
Which ratio will be determined by which sides you know. Once you know the ratio, you’ll work 
backward to the angle. If you’re working with tables of trigonometric ratios, that means poring 
through the tables, looking for the value of the sin, cos, or tan closest to the value you have to see 
what angle it belongs to. If you’re using a calculator, it’s a little easier.
Arcsin, arccos, arctan
Working backward means you know the sine (or cosine or tangent) of the angle and want to find 
the angle that has that sine. The common way to say “the angle whose sine is N” is arcsin N. The 
“arc” in arcsin comes from the fact that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of 
its intercepted arc. The name is saying “the arc (and therefore the angle) that has this sine.” In the 
next chapter, when talking about trigonometric functions, you’ll use the inverse function  
notation sin−1 N to denote the number whose sine is N. You’ll see these two notations used inter-
changeably, although there actually is a subtle difference in their meaning.

	
10	
practice makes perfect  Trigonometry
Each of the trigonometric ratios has an inverse. Just as the angle whose sine is N can be de-
noted as arcsin N, the angle whose cosine is N can be indicated by arcos N and the angle whose 
tangent is N by arctan N. You’ll find a way to enter each of the inverses on your calculator, usually 
as a second function or inverse function on the keys for sin, cos, and tan. The calculator keys may 
be marked with the inverse function symbols sin−1, cos−1, and tan−1.
If the legs of a right triangle measure 18 centimeters and 25 centimeters, you can find the 
measures of the acute angles by using the two known sides to find the tangent of one of the angles. 
The tangent of the smaller angle will be 18
25, or the tangent of the larger angle will be 25
18, but you 
can work with either one. To find the measure of the angle, use the tan−1 key on your calculator:

Finding areas

bh

. The 
problem you sometimes encountered in trying to use those formulas was that while you might 
know the lengths of the sides, you didn’t always know the altitude, or height, and didn’t have a 
convenient way to find it.
Thanks to right triangle trigonometry, that problem can sometimes be solved. If you know 
two sides of a triangle and the angle included between them, or two adjacent sides of a parallelo-
gram and the angle included between them, it’s possible to use trig ratios to find the height.

Look first at the triangle. You know the lengths of two sides, a and b, and the measurement 
of the angle between them, ∠C. Drop a perpendicular from vertex B to side b. If you can find the 
length of that altitude to side b, you can calculate the area. Because the perpendicular creates a 
right triangle, in which side a is the hypotenuse and the altitude, call it x, is the side opposite ∠C, 
you can find the height by using the trigonometric ratio sinC

With a similar logic, you can modify the formula for the area of a parallelogram. Drop an 
altitude from one vertex to the opposite side. If you know the lengths of two adjacent sides, you 
can find the altitude because one of your sides forms the hypotenuse of the right triangle created 
by the altitude. If you call the side that forms the hypotenuse a and call the included angle ∠C,

·2·
Trigonometry, or triangle measurement, begins in the right triangle, but it doesn’t 
have to be restricted to right triangles or to triangles at all. By introducing what 
are called the trigonometric functions, you can carry the ideas of triangle trigo-
nometry into a broader world. By moving the right triangle onto the coordinate 
plane and observing the interaction between the triangle and a circle centered at 
the origin, you can define six trigonometric functions, based on the six trig ratios, 
but not tied to the right triangle. With those functions, it becomes possible to talk 
about the sine, cosine, and tangent (or other functions) of an angle of any size.
Radian measure
When you define a function, the domain of the function is the largest subset of the 
real numbers for which the rule has meaning. Up to this point, all the angles 
whose sine, cosine, or tangent you’ve calculated have been measured in degrees. 
To begin to talk about trigonometry in function terms, it is helpful to move to a 
different system of measurement called radian measure that allows you to talk 
about the domain of the trig functions as subsets of the real numbers.
A radian is the measure of a central angle whose intercepted arc is equal in 
length to the radius of the circle. Imagine that you cut a piece of string exactly the 
length of the radius of a circle and then place that string on the circumference of 
the circle. Draw two radii, one from the center to one end of the string and one 
from the center to the other end of the string. The central angle that results has a 
measurement of 1 radian.

If you cut several strings that size and started to place them end to end around the circle, 
you’d find you can fit 6 of them, with a little bit of space left over. That’s because the circumference 
of a circle is 2π times the radius. Your string is the same length as the radius, so 2π, or a little more 
than 6, of them fit around the circumference. There are 2π radians in a full rotation, π radians in 
a half rotation.
If you need to convert from degrees to radians or radians to degrees, you can use the propor-
tion degrees
360
radians

=
2π
. Simply fill in the degree measure or radian measure that you know and 
a variable for the one you don’t know and solve the proportion.
To find the radian equivalent of 135°, set up the proportion and put 135 in the degrees posi-
tion. Then cross multiply and solve:

Common angles in radians
Just as you learned the relationships of sides in common right triangles, you’ll find it helpful to 
know the radian equivalent of common angles:

° = π

° = π

° = π  radians
Don’t become dependent on conversion, however. You want to work, and think, in radians. Learn 
to count around the circle, starting from the positive x-axis, by multiples of π
2, by multiples of π
3, by 
multiples of π
4
, and by multiples of π
6. Develop a mental image of where each of the multiples falls.

	
Trigonometric functions	 17
Learn to estimate where values like 3.2 radians or 2.5 radians will fall. Remember, half the 
circle is π, and π is a little more than 3, or approximately 3.14. So 3.2 is just beyond half a rotation. 
An angle of 2.5 radians is smaller, but how much smaller? If half a rotation is π, a quarter circle is 
half of π, so a little more than 1.5 radians. An angle of 2.5 radians will fall past the quarter circle 
but before the half circle, and closer to the half. Obviously, these are just approximations, but 
learning to make those estimates will help you work more comfortably with radians.
Comparing angles
One of the advantages of radian measure, from the point of view of defining functions, is that you’re 
using real numbers. You may encounter measurements like 8.63 radians or −2.5 radians, but often 
radian measures will be multiples or fractions of π, because there are 2π radians in a full rotation.
To compare angle measurements like 2
3
π and 3
4
π, simply compare the fractions: 2
3 < 3
4 so 
2
3
π < 3
4
π. To compare a measurement like 2
3
π with something like 1.5 radians, remember that π 
is slightly more than 3, so 2
3
π is a little more than 2 radians, while 1.5 radians is closer to π
2.

Angles in standard position
An angle is in standard position if its vertex is at the origin and one of its sides, called the 
­initial side, lies on the positive x-axis. The other side of the angle is called the terminal side. 
Think about the sides of the angle like the hands of a clock, one of which—the initial side—is 
stuck pointing to 3, and the other—the terminal side—is able to rotate. If the direction of ro-
tation is counterclockwise, the measure of the angle between the two sides is considered to be 
positive. If the direction of rotation is clockwise, the measure of the angle is negative. Angles 
may be acute, right, obtuse, straight, or reflex (more than a straight angle). An angle may  
even be more than a full rotation, so it’s quite possible to have an angle of 18.5 radians or  
−17
3
π  radians.
Angle of more
than one rotation
Because the terminal side can rotate in different directions and can complete any number of 
rotations before reaching its final position, two angles in standard position may have different 
measurements yet share the same terminal side. One may be a positive angle while the other is 
negative, or one may include one or more full rotations while the other is less than a full rotation. 
Angles that share the same terminal side are called coterminal angles.

positive direction and one in the negative direction, but both terminal sides wind up in the same 
place. Because we allow angles of more than a full rotation, that same side is also the terminal side

The unit circle
Imagine a circle on the coordinate plane, with its center at the origin and with a radius of 1. Such 
a circle is called a unit circle. You’re going to look at central angles of the unit circle, specifically, 
angles in standard form. The unit circle has a particular property that will let you extend what 
you know about trigonometric ratios to larger angles.
Choose a point on the circle somewhere in the first quadrant. Connect the origin to the 
point and, from that point, drop a perpendicular to the x-axis. This creates a right triangle with 
a hypotenuse of 1.
1
y
x
Call the angle at the origin between the positive x-axis and the hypotenuse θ. This angle is 
in standard position. Its initial side is the positive x-axis, along which one leg of the right triangle 
sits, and its terminal side contains the hypotenuse of the right triangle, a hypotenuse that mea-
sures 1 because it is the radius of the unit circle. The lengths of the legs of that right triangle are 
the x- and y-coordinates of the point you chose.
Apply what you know about right triangle trigonometry to this triangle, and something in-
teresting emerges. If the point you chose is (x, y), then

If you know the coordinates of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the 
unit circle, you know cos θ and sin θ, because they are the coordinates of that point. You can find 
tan θ by dividing the coordinates, and if you’re interested in sec θ, csc θ, or cot θ, they’re just the 
reciprocals.
If you’re appropriately skeptical, you’re probably wondering if this is just a coincidence of the 
point you chose, but more investigation will show you that it’s not. You can repeat the experiment 
for any point along the unit circle in the first quadrant and get the same result.
What’s important about this result is that it gives you a way to define the sine, cosine, and 
tangent of an angle θ, in standard position, whether it’s acute, right, obtuse, or larger, and even if 
it’s negative.
If θ is an angle in standard position and the terminal side of θ intersects the unit circle at the 
point (x, y), then you can define

Trigonometric functions
You’ve extended the idea of trigonometric ratios for the acute angles of a right triangle to a wider 
world in which it’s possible to find the sine, cosine, and tangent and their reciprocals for any angle 
in standard position, if you know the point at which the terminal side of the angle intersects the 
unit circle. This in turn broadens your understanding of ideas like the sine from a ratio of two 
sides of a triangle to a function that assigns to every real number θ a value that we call sin θ and 
that we define by the y-coordinate of that point on the unit circle. Now you can talk about trig 
functions rather than trig ratios.
Domains and ranges
Whenever you consider a new function, you want to think about the domain and range of the 
function. The domain is the set of all inputs, or values of the independent variable, for which the 
function is defined. The sine function and cosine function are defined for all real numbers, but 
the other trig functions, because of the denominators in their definitions, have restricted 
domains.
The sine and cosine functions are defined for all real numbers, so their domain is −∞∞
(
)
,
, 
and because each of them is equal to one of the coordinates of a point on the unit circle, each of 
them returns values between −1 and 1, so their range is [−1, 1].
The functions that have x in the denominator of their definition, tangent and secant, are  
undefined where x is 0, or, put another way, where the cosine is 0. The cosine will equal 0 when θ  
is π
2  or 3
2
π  or 5
2
π  or any positive or negative odd multiple of π
2 , or at π
2  and every π units 
clockwise or counterclockwise from there. The functions that have y in the denominator of their 
definition, cosecant and cotangent, are undefined where y is 0, or where the sine is 0. The sine will 
equal 0 at 0 and any multiple of π.
The range of the tangent and cotangent includes all real numbers. The secant and cosecant, 
because they are the reciprocals of the cosine and sine functions, respectively, have ranges made 
up of two intervals. The values of the sine and cosine range from −1 to 1. The reciprocals of those 
numbers range from 1 to ∞ on the positive side and from −1 to −∞ on the negative side.

Beyond the unit circle
While the trigonometric functions are defined in terms of the point where the terminal side in-
tersects the unit circle, it is possible to find the values of the trig functions if any point on the 
terminal side is known. If you know the point on the terminal side where it intersects the unit 
circle, you can go right to the definitions of the trig functions, but if the point you know is not on 
the unit circle, proportional thinking will still let you find the values of the functions. If you drop 
a perpendicular from your point to the x-axis, you create a right triangle that is similar to the one 
on which the definition relies.

All-star trig class
The symmetries of the unit circle mean that many of the values of the trigonometric functions are 
repeated as you move around the circle, with a change of sign as you move from quadrant to 
quadrant. If you know the values of the six functions for the angles in the first quadrant and you 
understand how the signs change, you can find the trig functions of any angle in the 
π

 or 
 family.
When the terminal side of an angle falls in the first quadrant, the point where the terminal 
side intersects the unit circle has positive coordinates, and so all six trig functions of the angle 
have positive values. When the terminal side moves to the second quadrant, the x-coordinate is 
negative and the y-coordinate is positive. As a result, the sine and cosecant are positive, but all 
four other functions are negative. In the third quadrant, both coordinates are negative, so only 
the tangent and cotangent are positive. In quadrant IV, the x-coordinate is positive and the  
y-coordinate is negative, so the cosine and secant are positive, but the other functions are 
negative.
There is a variety of mnemonic devices to help you remember those signs. All of them refer 
to the quadrant labels in the figure below. They differ in how they suggest you remember the 
placement of the letters. You can remember ACTS, starting in quadrant I and moving clockwise, 
or CAST, if you prefer to move counterclockwise, but you’ll have to start in quadrant IV. It’s prob-
ably easier to take the quadrants in the traditional order, but since ASTC is hard to pronounce, 
take it as an acronym. Some people learn “all seniors take calculus,” but since that’s not always 
true, you might prefer “all-star trig class.”

Trigonometric functions	 25
The A in the first quadrant tells you that, in that quadrant, all six trig functions are positive. 
The second quadrant gets an S because the sine and its reciprocal, the cosecant, are positive, but 
all the other functions are negative. The T in the third quadrant signals that the tangent and its 
reciprocal, the cotangent, are positive there, and the C in quadrant IV says that the cosine and its 
reciprocal, the secant, are the only positive functions in that quadrant.
If you combine your experience finding the six trig functions when you’re given a point 
on the terminal side with your knowledge of the signs of the functions in different quadrants, 
you can take just a little bit of information and find all six trig functions for a particular value 
of θ.
Suppose you know that tanθ = 3
4. You don’t know the value of θ, and you don’t know the 
point where the terminal side intersects the unit circle, but you do know that the ratio of the  
y-coordinate to the x-coordinate is 3
4 . The right triangle formed when you drop a perpendicular 
from the point on the unit circle to the x-axis will be similar to a 3-4-5 right triangle. You can 
almost find the other trig functions.
The only problem is that you don’t know whether tanθ = 3
4 because the terminal side of θ 
falls in quadrant I or because it falls in quadrant III. If θ is a first-quadrant angle, all six functions 
are positive. If θ falls in quadrant III, only the tangent and cotangent are positive, and the rest are 
negative. You need more information.
If you have the additional piece of information that cscθ < 0, you know that sinθ < 0, so the 
angle must fall in the third quadrant. Once you have that, you can say

In this example, you knew that the triangle would be a 3-4-5 right triangle, but even if the sides 
of the triangle weren’t a Pythagorean triple, you could use the two known sides in the Pythago-
rean theorem to find the third side.
If sinθ = 7
8 and tanθ < 0, you know that the terminal side of θ will fall in the second quad­
rant. You know the six trig functions will have values the same as a right triangle with a leg of 7 
and a hypotenuse of 8. Find the third side with the Pythagorean theorem:

Draw the terminal side of θ in quadrant II and drop a perpendicular to make the right  
triangle. The hypotenuse is 8, the vertical side is 7, and the side along the x-axis will be −15, 
negative because x-coordinates are negative in the second quadrant. You can find all six

·3·
The six trigonometric functions—sine, cosine, tangent, and their reciprocals—are 
periodic functions. Each of them repeats a certain pattern, over and over again, in 
a specified interval called the period. The repetition of values occurs because the 
functions are defined by values around the circle. Each time you go around the 
circle, you repeat the pattern.
Studying the graphs of trigonometric functions can help you understand the 
periodic nature of the functions and help you see how the trig functions model 
phenomena from the world around you. It can allow you to see the repetition and, 
as a result, help you solve trigonometric equations. The better you are able to visu-
alize the repetitions of the periodic function, the faster you’ll locate the multiple 
solutions possible for a trig equation.
In Chapter 4, you’ll look at applications of the trig functions in different kinds 
of problems. You’ll use periodic functions to model different kinds of behaviors, 
and you’ll solve equations involving trig functions. Being able to sketch a graph can 
often be a great help in solving problems that are modeled by trig functions.
The more you explore the graphs of the trigonometric functions, the better 
you’ll understand how the functions behave. You’ll be able to sketch a graph 
quickly and anticipate the repetitions of the function. Once you’re acquainted 
with the parent functions, the simplest case of each of the trig functions, you can 
sketch graphs of more complex functions by applying principles of translation, 
reflection, stretching, and compressing. Each of those changes shows up in a par-
ticular spot in the equation, and knowing where to look for them and how to  
interpret them will make your work easier.
Graphs of sine and cosine functions
You have to start with the parent graphs. The graphs of the trig functions are often 
referred to as waves because of their repetitive nature. The various trig functions 
have graphs of different shapes, but each is repetitive, periodic, and undulating, 
behaving somewhat like a wave. The graphs of y = sinθ  and y = cosθ in particu-
lar rise and fall like waves on the ocean.
Sine
The most fundamental sine wave, y
x
= sin , has the following graph. The horizon-
tal axis represents θ, the rotation, and the vertical axis is sin θ, which was defined 
as the y-coordinate of the point where the terminal side crosses the unit circle. The 
sine function is defined for all real numbers, so the domain of y
x
= sin  is −∞∞
(
)
,
. 
The y-coordinates of points on the unit circle vary between −1 and 1, so the range 
of y
x
= sin  is [−1, 1].
Graphs of  
trigonometric functions

	
30	
practice makes perfect  Trigonometry
As you move around the unit circle in the positive direction, the y-coordinate increases 
from 0 to 1 as you move through the first quadrant, then decreases to 0 and then to −1 as you 
travel through quadrants II and III. As you rotate through the fourth quadrant, the y-coordinate 
increases from −1 to 0. The graph of y
x
= sin  fluctuates from 0 to a high of 1, down through 0 to 
−1, and back to 0, in a space of 2π, one full rotation. The period of the sine wave, the time it takes 
to complete one full wave, is 2π, a full rotation.
As you investigate each of the parent graphs, you’ll want to learn the general shape of the 
graph, but also locate a few key points on the parent graph. Once you know those key points, you 
can work transformations on those points, and the image points will help you define the new 
graph. You’ll want to remember key points on this parent graph for the family of sine functions. 
Think of (0, 0) as the start of a wave, and π
2 1,



 as the peak of the upward bump. The upward 
bump is complete at (π, 0), and then the graph drops down to 3
2 1
π ,



 and then rises up to finish 
the full cycle at (2π, 0).
Transformations
There are six possible alterations to the parent graph, but these show up as four numbers in the 
equation y
a
b
h
k
=
−
(
)
(
)+
sin
θ
. The h and k represent translations, or rigid shifts. The number h 
is the horizontal shift, sometimes called the phase shift, and the k is the vertical shift. The vertical 
shift defines the midline of the graph. For the parent graph, the midline is the x-axis, and the 
graph rises above the midline and falls below it by equal distances.
Change y = sinθ to y =
−
(
)
sin θ
3  and the graph will move 3 units to the right because the 
value of h is 3. Change y = sinθ to y =
+
(
)
sin θ
2  and it will move 2 units left because h is −2. Mov-
ing left or right will change the x-coordinate of the key points.
Tacking on a constant at the end shifts the graph up or down y =
+
sinθ
4 moves the parent 
graph up 4 units, and y =
−
sinθ
1 shifts the parent graph down 1 unit. Translating the graph up 
or down will change the y-coordinate of your key points. Of course, a single equation may have 
more than one transformation and certainly may have both a horizontal and a vertical shift.
The numbers in the a and b positions do double duty. The absolute value of the number 
­communicates one idea, while its sign tells you something else. If a is negative, the graph will be 
–3 
–2.5 
–2 
–1.5 
–1

reflected across the x-axis. That will change the sign of the x-coordinates of the key points. If b is 
a negative number, the graph is reflected across the y-axis, and the sign of the y-coordinates of the 
key points changes.
You may find that it’s sometimes hard to tell whether there’s been a reflection across the  
x-axis or across the y-axis. The graph of the parent function y = sinθ, reflected across the x-axis, 
looks exactly the same as the graph of y = sinθ reflected across the y-axis. For other graphs, that 
won’t be the case, but there may be other curiosities. The parent graph y = cosθ, reflected across 
the y-axis, for example, will appear not to have changed at all because y = cosθ is symmetric 
about the y-axis.
The absolute value of a, called the amplitude, tells you about vertical stretch or compression 
and defines the height of each bump on the sine wave. When a >1, the graph is stretched, and 
the peaks get higher and the troughs lower. If a <1, the graph is compressed, with peaks and 
troughs that are closer to the midline than those of the parent graph. The amplitude is a multi-
plier, affecting the y-coordinates of the key points.
The absolute value of b refers to horizontal stretch and compression. If b >1, the graph is 
compressed because more than one full cycle must fit into the space of 2π. When b <1, you com-
plete less than one cycle in 2π, so the graph is stretched horizontally. Adjust your key points by 
dividing each of the x-coordinates by b.
Because stretching or compressing the wave horizontally will change the number of waves 
that fit in a space of 2π, the number in the b position is called the frequency. The product of the 
frequency and the period will always be 2π.
Cosine
The graph of y = cosθ resembles the graph of y = sinθ but is shifted, or translated, π
2 units  
to the left. The reason for that shift is that the cosine is the sine of the complement. The cosine  
of θ is the sine of π

The key points to remember for the cosine wave are (0, 1), π

π ,


The cosine wave “starts high,” which means that the first key point you remember is actually the 
high point of the wave. Then the graph drops down through 0 to −1 and back up through 0, back 
to the high of 1 again. The parent graph makes that cycle in a space of 2π.
The values of a, b, h, and k change the shape and location of the wave as they did for the sine. 
The values of a and b concern reflection over the axes and stretching and compression. The values 
of h and k tell you how to translate the graph.

The graph of y

 is determined by four numbers, a, b, h, and k, in the equa-
tion. The numbers h and k tell how the wave is translated from the position of the parent, 
with h indicating the horizontal translation and k the vertical shift. The value in the h posi-
tion will be added to the x-coordinate of the key points, and the number in the k position 
will be added to the y-coordinate of the key points. The vertical shift, k, will raise or lower 
the midline of the wave.
The amplitude, a, tells the height of each peak and the depth of each trough from the mid-
line. This represents a vertical stretch. An amplitude greater than 1 stretches the graph vertically, 
making each of the peaks taller than the parent. An amplitude less than 1 compresses the graph, 
making it shorter.
The frequency, b, tells the number of full wave patterns that are completed in a space of 2π. 
The period of the function, which is the length of a full cycle, is 2π
b . The frequency and period 
are inversely related. As one increases, the other decreases, and their product is always 2π. Because 
increasing the frequency, b, decreases the period, it compresses the wave, and decreasing the  
frequency increases the period and stretches the wave.
Here are some examples of these adjustments, one change at a time.

Graphs of other trigonometric functions
The sine and cosine graphs are continuous and periodic. They are smooth, connected curves that 
repeat the wavelike pattern over and over. In different equations, the length, or period, of the 
wave may change, its height, or amplitude, may change, and it may shift in different directions, 
but the basic wave form remains the same for all sine and cosine graphs.
All the other trigonometric functions have graphs that are discontinuous, but, like the sine and 
cosine, each repeats a pattern. They are discontinuous because each is defined as a quotient, and for 
each one there are values that make the denominator 0, and therefore make the function undefined.
The patterns that they repeat differ from the sine and cosine wave form. The tangent and 
cotangent, which are reciprocals of one another, have patterns that mirror one another, while the 
secant and cosecant, which are reciprocals of the cosine and sine, respectively, share a shape. 
You’ll see that one graph appears to be a shifted form of the other, just as the cosine is a shifted 
version of the sine wave.
Tangent
The tangent function has a discontinuous graph, because the tangent is defined as the quotient y
x  
of the coordinates of the point x y
,
(
) at which the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit 
circle, or as the quotient of the sine and the cosine. Whenever the x-coordinate is 0, the cosine is 0, 

	
Graphs of trigonometric functions	 35
and the tangent will be undefined, so the graph will have a vertical asymptote at each of those 
points. Those discontinuities occur at multiples of π
2.
The tangent is periodic, however, repeating in a period of π units. In the space of π units be-
tween vertical asymptotes that fall at multiples of π
2, the same pattern is repeated. The parent 
graph has its y-intercept at the origin and x-intercepts at all multiples of π. Each wave goes to −∞ 
on the left and ∞ on the right.

tion is 0, since the cotangent is the reciprocal of the tangent. The discontinuities of the cotangent

cofunctions, or complementary functions. The x-intercepts of the parent graph fall at odd multiples

Secant and cosecant
The secant and cosecant functions are the reciprocals of the cosine and sine functions, respec-
tively, and, like the sine and cosine, differ by a shift of π
2 . Each is made up of cup-shaped sections, 
alternating opening up and down, with each section tangent to the graph of its reciprocal.
The graphs have vertical asymptotes between the cup-shaped sections, at multiples of π for 
the cosecant function and at odd multiples of π
2  for the secant function. The vertical asymptotes 
of the cosecant function occur at the 0s of the sine function, and the vertical asymptotes of the 
secant function occur at the 0s of the cosine.
The sections of the secant function seem to balance on the peaks and troughs of the cosine 
graph. In the figure below, the cosine graph is shown in gray, with the secant graph in black. The 
discontinuities of the secant occur when the cosine is 0, at odd multiples of π
2, and the graph has 
vertical asymptotes at those values.
The graph of the secant function just touches the graph of the cosine at those points where 
both equal 1 or both equal −1, because the reciprocal of 1 is 1 and the reciprocal of −1 is −1. Where 
the cosine is positive but less than 1, the secant will be greater than 1, becoming larger and larger 
as the cosine gets close to 0. When the cosine is negative, between 0 and −1, the secant is negative, 
less than −1, and decreasing without bound as the cosine approaches 0.
The figure below shows the sine graph in gray and the cosecant graph in black, with the sec-
tions of the cosecant graph seeming to balance on the graph of the sine. The graph of the cosecant 
function has vertical asymptotes at multiples of π, where the sine function is 0.

Inverse trigonometric functions
The inverse of a function reverses whatever work the function has accomplished. If the function 
added, the inverse subtracts. If the function divided, the inverse multiplies. The inverse of the 
squaring function is the square root function. Each inverse sends every element of the range back 
to the element of the domain from which it came. The range of the function is the domain of the 
inverse, and the domain of the function is the range of the inverse.

In order for a function to have an inverse function, the function must be one to one. This 
means that not only does every x-value have only one y-value, but every y-value comes from only 
one x-value. You may have learned about a vertical line test to tell if a graph represents a function. 
If any vertical line were to intersect the graph more than once, that would signal that the graph is 
not a function. To determine if a graph represents a one-to-one function, use a horizontal line 
test. If any horizontal line intersects the graph more than once, the function is not one to one.
The graphs of the three principal trigonometric functions, sin θ, cos θ, and tan θ, do not pass 
the horizontal line test; that is, they are not one-to-one functions. The periodic nature of the trig 
functions means that the same y-value is produced by many different x-values, and that in turn 
means that they would not have an inverse that is a function.
The hope of inverse trig functions is not lost, however. Each function can be restricted so 
that it is one to one. For each of the parent functions, choose first-quadrant values, where the 
function is positive, and the nearest continuous quadrant in which the function is negative. In the 
figure below, you see the graphs of y = sinθ, y = cosθ, and y = tanθ. On each graph, the re-
stricted domain is shown by the heavier curve.
The sine function will be one to one if it is restricted to the interval −

Sinusoidal functions, or functions based on the sine or cosine functions, occur in 
many natural phenomena. Sinusoidal functions are periodic; that is, they repeat a 
pattern over a fixed interval called the period of the function. Many situations 
involve repetitive motion that may fit this model. The motion of waves, both water 
waves and sound waves, fit a sinusoidal model, as do the vibrations that cause 
sound and the motion of pendulums. Even biological functions like heartbeats 
and environmental factors like average daily temperature repeat periodically.

Sinusoidal functions fit the model f t

d
( ) =

(

sin
. The variable is often  
t because the function generally describes motion over time. Each of the param-
eters a, b, c, and d affects the shape of the graph and corresponds to a characteris-
tic of the motion described.
The parameter a is called the amplitude of the function, b is the frequency, c 
is the phase shift or horizontal shift, and d is the vertical shift, which describes the 
baseline of the motion. That baseline is the level at which the motion begins. To-
gether with the phase shift, this baseline defines a starting point. The phase shift 
moves the start of the cycle left or right of the origin. The baseline and phase shift 
translate the basic wave to a new location.
From there, the object moves up (or in whatever is deemed the positive direc-
tion) a distance equal to the amplitude, back to the baseline, down a distance 
equal to the amplitude, and back to the baseline. This is one full cycle, and it is 
completed in a time interval called the period. The period is not directly visible in 
the equation, but the product of the frequency and the period is 2π, so the period 
is equal to 2π
b
. The frequency tells you how many full cycles are accomplished in 
a space of 2π, so dividing 2π by the frequency will tell you how long it takes to 
complete one full cycle.
In the basic function f t
t
( ) = sin , the amplitude is 1, the frequency is also 1, 
and the phase shift and vertical shift are both 0. The graph completes one full cycle 
in a space of 2π, and you can see a wave begin at the origin, rise to a high point  
of 1 at π
2, back to 0 at π, down to −1 at 3
2
π, and complete the cycle at 2π.
In the function f t
t
( ) = 2sin , because the amplitude is 2, the wave rises to +2 
and drops to −2. The baseline, starting point, and ending point all remain the 
same. There are no shifts, and the frequency of 1 and period of 2π have not 
changed.

The final element to consider is the sign of the amplitude and the sign of the frequency. 
While both the amplitude and the frequency are taken as absolute values, the presence of a 
negative sign on either one indicates a reflection. A negative value of a indicates that the 
graph is reflected over the x-axis, and a negative value of b means a reflection over the 
y-axis.

A note on variations
Because of the periodic nature of the sinusoidal functions, it’s often possible to have different 
equations that produce the same graph. Shift a sine wave π
2
 units to the right and you have the 
same graph you’d produce by shifting it 3
2
π  to the left. Generally, you’ll want to use the smaller 
shift.

Circular motion
When an object moves around a circle, both its horizontal and its vertical position relative to the 
center of the circle vary in a periodic fashion. If the radius of the circle is r, the horizontal position 
of the object varies between r units left of the center and r units right of the center. The vertical 
position varies between r units below the center and r units above.
Imagine a point moving around a circle of radius 2, centered at the origin, and suppose the 
point begins its movement from (2, 0). As it moves around the circle in a counterclockwise di-
rection, the y-coordinate of its location gradually increases from 0 to 2, falls back to 0 and down 
to −2 and climbs back to 0. The vertical motion of the point can be described by a sinusoidal 
function, if you can identify the amplitude, frequency and period, phase shift, and midline.
The point moves between a low of −2 and a high of +2, so the amplitude is 2 and the midline 
is y = 0. To identify the frequency and period, you’ll need to know something about how fast the 
point is moving, so suppose it makes a full trip around the circle in 6 minutes. The period is 6 
minutes, and the frequency is 2

Springs and pendulums
If you place a mass on the end of a hanging spring and pull down to stretch the spring, the spring 
will snap back up as soon as you release it. In fact, the spring will compress so that the weight 
moves up above its starting point. The distance it contracts above the starting point is equal to the 
distance you pulled it down from its starting point. The mass on the end of the spring will con-
tinue to bounce up and down, and if you chart its position, you’ll find that it fits a sinusoidal 
model.
The motion of a pendulum also fits this model, called simple harmonic motion. The pendu-
lum begins hanging vertically and is displaced to one side. Then it swings back to the middle and 
then to the other side a distance equal to the first displacement. Again the motion can be  
described with a sinusoidal function.
In each of these situations, the amplitude of the function is equal to the original displace-
ment. If you stretch the spring 2 inches, it will compress until the mass is 2 inches above the 
resting point. The amplitude will be 2. A full cycle is considered to be the movement from the 
resting position to the extreme position on one side, back through the rest position to the other 
extreme and back to rest. The time it takes to complete a full cycle is the period. The frequency 
is 2π divided by the period. Vertical shifts might be caused by the positioning of the spring (or 
the method of recording the position) and horizontal or phase shifts by adjustments to the 
timing.
A spring with a mass on the end is hung so that the mass is 4 feet above the floor. The mass 
is drawn downward 6 inches and held there. On a signal, the mass is released and timing is  
begun. The mass completes a full cycle in 0.75 second. Find a sinusoidal function that describes 
the position of the mass.
The resting position is 4 feet above the floor, and the displacement is 6 inches, or 0.5 foot, so 
the amplitude is 1
2
. The mass oscillates between 3.5 feet and 4.5 feet above the floor, so the midline 
is y = 4. The function has a vertical shift of 4 and an amplitude of 1

Rhythms in nature
Many of the rising and falling movements in nature can be modeled by sinusoidal functions. The 
ebb and flow of tides fit the model, as do the changing hours of daylight over the course of a year 
and the rise and fall of the average temperature as the seasons change. While the model is unlikely 
to be a perfect fit to the observed phenomena, it represents the changing values well enough to 
allow you to estimate some answers to questions.
If the high tide and low tide are recorded 12 hours apart, a full cycle, from low tide to high 
tide and back to low tide, will take a period of 24 hours. The frequency is 2

If t = 0  corresponds to some other point in the cycle, you’ll need more information to deter-

Your body temperature rises and falls over the course of a day, and the parameters of the 
cycle differ with age and other factors. The hormones that affect your desire to sleep fluctuate over 
the course of a year, changing with the number of hours of daylight. Respiration, heart rate, and 
even the pain of arthritis follow roughly sinusoidal rhythms.
Body temperature will fluctuate almost 1°F over the course of a day. If you have a “normal” 
body temperature of 98.6°F, you will actually vary between a low of about 98.1°F toward the end 
of your cycle to a high of approximately 99.1°F in the late afternoon or early evening. If your low-
est body temperature is recorded at 4 a.m. and your highest at 4 p.m., your body temperature can 
be described by a sinusoidal function with an amplitude of half a degree Fahrenheit, a midline of 
y = 98.6°F, and a period of 24 hours. The frequency is therefore 2

If n = 0, t = 10, which means that your body temperature is 98.6°F at 10 a.m., as your body 
temperature rises from the early morning low. Your temperature is also 98.6°F 12 hours later, 
when n = 1 and t = 22, but at 10 p.m. your temperature is slowly going down.
When medications are administered, dosages are calculated and timed to maintain a level 
in the blood stream that is high enough to have a positive effect, called the therapeutic level, but 
low enough to minimize negative effects, below the toxic level. When a dose of the drug is given, 
the level in the blood stream rises to a level between the therapeutic level and the toxic level. As 
the body metabolizes the drug, levels in the blood stream fall, until a new dose is given, and the 
level begins to rise again. The amount and timing of each dose must be calculated to keep the 
amount in the blood stream between the therapeutic level and the toxic level.
Aspirin is sometimes used to reduce the fever that accompanies the common cold or other 
illness. A patient with a temperature of 39.0°C was given a 1 gram dose of aspirin. The reduction 
in temperature began in half an hour. After 3 hours, the temperature was 37.3°C, and after 6 
hours, 38.0°C. The fluctuation in temperature can be described by the sinusoidal function

In trigonometry, a great deal of time is spent learning and working with identities. 
Remember that an identity is an equation that is true for all values of the variable 
involved. In ordinary algebraic equations, demonstrating that a particular equa-
tion is an identity is generally just a matter of simplifying each side. Removing 
parentheses and combining like terms usually will quickly reduce both sides of 
the equation to the same expression. In trigonometry, because the different trig 
functions are interrelated, it will often take some substitutions as well as some 
algebra before you can demonstrate that an equation is an identity.
Because an identity is a statement that is always true, the two sides of the 
equation are interchangeable and one can be substituted for the other whenever 
convenient. You’ll memorize some key identities and use them to make substitu-
tions into other equations, either to demonstrate that those equations are also 
identities or to simplify an equation so that it can be solved. Equations that might 
be difficult or impossible to solve otherwise can be transformed, by substitutions 
of identities, into equivalent equations that can easily be solved.
Fundamental identities
There are many trigonometric identities, but a few are particularly important for 
simplifying trigonometric equations. These essential equivalences derive easily 
from the basic definitions of the trig functions. These identities are key to making 
the substitutions that allow you to simplify and solve trigonometric equations.
There are four groups of fundamental identities: reciprocal, quotient,  
cofunction, and Pythagorean identities.
Reciprocal identities
The first group is a collection of identities commonly referred to as the reciprocal 
identities. Working from the basic definitions of the trig functions, it is simple to 
show that each of the trigonometric functions is a reciprocal of another:

The product of any nonzero number and its reciprocal is always 1. Because these identities 
are reciprocal relationships, it’s also true that the reciprocal functions have a product of 1:
sin csc

θ =1   
cos sec
θ
θ =1

Multiplying through an equation by the reciprocal of a function in the equation can often 
simplify the equation. Solving sec

 might seem difficult at first, but multiplying both 
sides by cos θ turns the equation into something simpler:

Because you know the unit circle, you know that cos θ is equal to 1 or −1 when θ is equal to a 
multiple of π.
Quotient identities
The next group of identities is called the quotient identities. Like the reciprocal identities, these 
can be shown to be true by working from the definitions of the trig functions. It’s possible to show 
that each function is the quotient of two other functions. For example, sin
cos
tan
θ
θ
θ

x

Cofunction identities
The cofunction, or complementary function, identities get their names because they refer to a 
function of one angle being equal to a different function of the complement of the angle. Sine and 
cosine, tangent and cotangent, and secant and cosecant are complementary functions:

Verifying identities
To verify an identity, you need to demonstrate that the two sides of the equation are identical. To 
do this, first decide which side of the equation seems simpler. Leave this side untouched, as your 
goal. If you start making changes on both sides, you can easily lose track of what you’re trying to 
accomplish and find yourself going in circles.
On the side you’ve decided to change, use known identities to substitute for pieces of the ex-
pression. You might use a reciprocal identity or one of the Pythagorean identities to replace a part 

	
Identities and equations	 59
of the given equation. Then use algebraic techniques to simplify until the more complicated side 
matches the goal. You may multiply and cancel, combine like terms, or even factor the 
expression.
When the identity you’re trying to prove contains more than one trig function, it’s usually 
helpful to make substitutions that will reduce the number of functions involved. For that reason, 
it’s often a wise idea to put as much of the equation as possible in terms of the sine and cosine.
Verify: sin
cot cos
csc

The right side, cscθ, seems simpler, so keep that as the goal. To reduce the number of func-
tions involved, replace cotθ by the quotient identity cos

Solving trigonometric equations
When you start to solve an equation involving trigonometric functions, you may face a number 
of different complications. The periodic nature of the trig functions means that you’ll be looking 
for multiple solutions, even if you’re only solving over a limited domain. You’ll need to isolate the 
trigonometric function in the equation first, and that may be complicated if the equation con-
tains more than one function. The equation may be quadratic in form, requiring factoring or, 
occasionally, even the use of the quadratic formula.

Identities and equations	 61
Solving a trigonometric equation can often be made simpler by following these steps:
◆	 If the equation involves more than one trig function, use identities to substitute and sim-
plify, getting down to one function if you can. Whenever possible, try to put the equation 
in terms of the sine or cosine, since these are the functions you likely know best.
◆	 Let a single variable represent the remaining trig function. For example, replace all  
occurrences of cosx with t.
◆	 Solve the equation for this new placeholder variable.
◆	 Reinsert the trig function and determine the value of the argument that will produce the 
desired value. If, for example, you find that t = 1 and t was taking the place of cos θ, you 
need to determine what values of θ will make cos θ = 1.
◆	 Remember that trigonometric functions are periodic. Equations commonly have multiple 
solutions. Be sure to give all the values of the variable that satisfy the equation. To specify all 
solutions, use the period of the function to summarize the repetition. For example, tanθ =1 
for θ

The equation contains both sinθ  and cosθ, so the first step is to rewrite the equation in 
terms of a single function. If you don’t have access to a graphing utility, getting the equation in 
terms of one function may simplify it enough that you can sketch the graph by hand. In any 
case, it will make the equation easier to solve. Use the Pythagorean identity to replace cos2 x

Notice that the difference between the sum and difference identity for each formula is only the 
change of signs. For the sine identities, the sign in the formula matches the sign in the argument. 
The sign of a sum is a sum, and the sign of a difference is a difference. The sine identities have 
matching signs, but the cosine identities do not. For the tangent identities, remember that 
tan
sin
cos
θ
θ
θ
=
. The identities for the tangent of a sum or difference come from the quotient of the
 
identities for the sine and cosine of a sum or of a difference, so the sign in the numerator will 
match the argument, but the sign in the denominator will not.
The sum and difference identities can be used in simplifying identities or simplifying equa-
tions before solving, but they’re also useful for finding the exact value of trig functions of angles 
that can be expressed as the sum or difference of angles whose values you’ve memorized. The key 
is finding the combination of angles that add or subtract to the angle you need. For example, 
π

Identities and equations	 65
Double-angle and half-angle identities
If the sum identities are applied to two angles of equal measure, the results are called the double-
angle identities. Like the sum and difference identities, the double-angle identities can be used 
both to verify identities and to simplify equations so they can be solved. They can, in theory, be 
used to find exact values of the trig functions of angles that are double known values, but since 
most of those are known values, that application is not common.
From the identity for the cosine of a double angle, however, you can derive the half-angle 
identities, and those can be useful both in identities and equations and in finding the exact values 
of the trig functions of angles that are half of the common angles.
Double-angle identities
If you begin with the sum identities and substitute α for β, you can derive identities for the sine, 
cosine, and tangent of 2α:

Half-angle identities
To derive the half-angle identities, you need to begin with the identity for the cosine of a double 
angle. You’ll do a little bit of renaming of angles and a little bit of algebra to arrive at the half-
angle formula.
If you begin with the sine-only version of the cosine of a double-angle formula, 
cos
sin

 and then take the square root of both sides:

Whether you use the positive or the negative version will be determined by the quadrant in which 
θ
2  falls. If θ
2  falls in the first or second quadrant, the sine will be positive. If it falls in quadrant 
III or IV, the sine will be negative.
If you use the half-angle formula to find sin 5

π
 
by taking



that

has a terminal side in quadrant II, so the sine will be positive. Because you know that the 
sine will be positive, you’ll calculate the value as

Product-sum and power-reducing identities
Combinations and variations on the sum, difference, double-angle, and half-angle identities allow 
you to simplify many trigonometric expressions. Some combinations occur frequently enough 
that they warrant their own names.

The trigonometric ratios that began your study of trigonometry allow you to find 
unknown sides in right triangles if you have the length of one side and the mea-
sure of one acute angle. You can use right triangle trigonometry to find the acute 
angles of a right triangle if you know two of the sides. Up to this point, you were 
only able to find that missing information in right triangles, but the usefulness of 
the trig functions can be extended to other triangles, non-right triangles, with the 
help of two rules called the law of sines and the law of cosines.
The law of sines
In geometry, you learned that the longest side of a triangle was opposite the largest 
angle, and the shortest side opposite the smallest angle, but you may also have 
learned that the lengths of the sides were not proportional to the size of the angles. 
The law of sines fills in the missing piece by telling you that the lengths of the sides 
are proportional to the sines of the angles.
If ∆ABC is a triangle (not necessarily a right triangle) with side a opposite 
∠ A, side b opposite ∠ B, and side c opposite ∠ C, as shown in the figure below, 
then

Finding sides with the law of sines
If you know the measures of two angles of a triangle and the length of one side, 
you can use a proportion from the law of sines to solve for a missing side. You will 
need the measurement of the angle opposite the known side and the measure of 
the angle opposite the side you’re trying to find, but if you know any two angles of 
the triangle, you can find the third by subtracting from 180°.

Suppose that, in ∆ABC, ∠ A measures 29° and ∠ B measures 85°. You know that AB = 3 
centimeters, and you want to find AC. Because you know two of the angles, you can find the 
third. ∠ C measures 180° − (29° + 85°) = 66°. The side labeled as a is the side opposite ∠ A, or BC, 
and b is side AC and c is side AB. The law of sines becomes

Finding angles with the law of sines
To find a missing angle, you must know two sides and one angle. One of the sides must be oppo-
site the angle you know and the other must be opposite the angle you’re trying to find. When you 
know two angles, you can calculate the third angle, but knowing two sides doesn’t let you find the 
third side, so you must be given the specific information you need, or you won’t be able to use the 
law of sines.
In ∆ABC, AB = 12 centimeters and AC = 18 centimeters. If ∠ B measures 77°, find the mea-

found a second angle in the triangle, you can subtract the total of the two known angles from 180° 
to find the third angle.

The ambiguous case of the law of sines
The one difficulty of the law of sines is that you may encounter situations in which there are two 
triangles that fit your given information. This is called the ambiguous case. (There is also the pos-
sibility that no triangle will satisfy your requirements, but that case is easier to spot.)
Recognizing the ambiguous case
In geometry, you learned how to prove that a pair of triangles is congruent. You learned SSS, SAS, 
ASA, and AAS as the abbreviations for valid ways to prove that triangles are congruent, and you 
learned that SSA was not valid. That information can help you to recognize the ambiguous case 
when you’re working with the law of sines.
SSS, SAS, ASA, and AAS work as ways to prove triangles congruent because once you set the 
lengths of the three sides, or of two sides and the angle that lies between them, or two angles and 
a side, there is only one triangle that can be drawn that has those pieces. If you know that those 
pieces of one triangle match those pieces of another, the triangles will be copies of one another, 
so they’ll be congruent.
Translating that information over to trigonometry, if your given information is ASA, two 
angles and the side included between them, or AAS, two angles and a side, you can use the law of 
sines without any concern. (If your given information is SSS, three sides, or SAS, two sides and the 
angle included between them, you’ll need the law of cosines, which we’ll look at a little later.)
When you’re using the law of sines to find an angle, your given information is SSA—two 
sides and an angle, but not the angle included between the sides—and you’re not guaranteed a 
unique triangle. You’re in the ambiguous case. If you call the known angle ∠ A, then you will 
have two solutions when ∠ A is acute and side a is shorter than side b. You’ll have no solution if 
∠ A is acute and side a is less than b

to ∠ R, called RS, that measures 18 centimeters and a side opposite ∠ R, called ST, that measures 
25 centimeters, how many possible triangles ∆RST can be formed?
Start by looking at the angle. ∠ R is acute, so you need to look at the sides. The product of RS, 
the side adjacent to ∠ R, and sinR is 18

Determine the number of possible triangles that contain the sides and angle given.

  3.  a = 8, c = 4, ∠ C = 14°	
13.  a = 11, b = 6, ∠ B = 110°
  4.  b = 91, c = 62, ∠ B = 101°	
14.  a = 37, c = 45, ∠ A = 30°
  5.  a = 63, b = 50, ∠ A = 47°	
15.  b = 82, c = 52, ∠ B = 65°
  6.  b = 8, c = 9, ∠ B = 53°	
16.  a = 50, b = 94, ∠ A = 84°
  7.  a = 18, c = 7, ∠ C = 22°	
17.  a = 48, b = 51, ∠ B = 92°
  8.  b = 4, c = 7, ∠ B = 94°	
18.  b = 22, c = 18, ∠ B = 115°

19.  b = 19, c = 25, ∠ C = 130°
10.  b = 22, c = 6, ∠ C = 35°	
20.  a = 11, b = 28, ∠ A = 80°
Coping with the ambiguous case
The no-solution situation of the ambiguous case takes care of itself. If you check before solving 
the problem and find that ∠ A is acute and side a is less than b
A
sin
, you’ll know there’s no solu-
tion. If you don’t check and start trying to solve, you’ll get a value for sinB that is greater than 1 
or less than −1—impossible!
You need to be alert for the case that may have two solutions, however. You’ll set up and start 
solving the same way as any other case, but when you get to finding the size of the angle, you’ll have 
to look for the other possible triangle. One triangle will have the given ∠ A, the acute ∠ B you’ll get 
from using the sin−1  key on your calculator, and an ∠ C that is equal to 180° − (m∠ A + m∠ B). But 
the sinB you found in your calculation also belongs to an obtuse ∠ B, specifically to 180°—the angle

your calculator returns. The second possible triangle contains ∠ A, the obtuse version of ∠ B, and 
an ∠ C that completes the 180°.

The law of cosines
The law of cosines may remind you a bit of the Pythagorean theorem, and there’s a reason for that. 
It’s derived by dividing the triangle into two right triangles by drawing an altitude.

Finding sides with the law of cosines
To find a side with the law of cosines, you’ll need to know the angle opposite the unknown side. 
(While it’s theoretically possible to find a side other than the one opposite the known angle, it 
would require a lot of nasty algebra.) Substitute the two known sides for a and b and the known 
angle for ∠ C. Evaluate the expression to find the value of c2 and take the square root of both 
sides.
In ∆ABC, ∠ C measures 34°. If side a is 14 centimeters and side b is 19 centimeters, find the 
length of side c.

Finding angles with the law of cosines
To find an angle using the law of cosines, you’ll need to know all three sides of the triangle. You’ll also 
need to be on the alert to avoid a common error. Replace c with the side opposite the angle you’re 
trying to find. Substitute the other two known sides for a and b. Evaluate the squares, combine a2  
and b2, but don’t try to subtract 2ab from a
b
2
2
+
. The 2ab is the coefficient of cosC, and that multi-
plication takes precedence over any addition or subtraction. Instead, subtract a
b

 from c2 and 
divide by −2ab to find cosC. Then use the cos−1 key on your calculator to find the measure of ∠ C.

Solving triangles
The instruction to “solve the triangle” means to find the measurements of all angles and the 
lengths of all sides not already known. Accomplishing that will require that you use the law of 
sines or the law of cosines, possibly both, and perhaps right triangle trigonometry. Which law you 
use will be determined by what information you are given or have already found.
Solve each problem by the most efficient method. Round to the nearest hundredth. Use the 
law of sines or the law of cosines, as appropriate. If more than one solution is possible, give 
both solutions.
  1.  In ∆ABC, ∠ A measures 74°, ∠ B measures 49°, and side BC is 14 centimeters long. Solve the 
triangle.

Polar coordinate system
In the Cartesian, or rectangular, coordinate system, points in the plane are located 
by an ordered pair of coordinates. The first coordinate indicates movement left or 
right of the origin, and the second, motion up or down. The polar coordinate system 
also uses an ordered pair of coordinates to locate a point in the plane, but the move-
ment from the origin, or pole, is indicated by an angle of rotation and a distance.
Polar coordinates
The polar grid is a set of concentric circles, centered about the pole, with radii that 
increase by a fixed unit, to allow you to count distances from the pole. The con-
centric circles are crisscrossed by spokes that are spaced at fixed degree or radian 
intervals, to allow you to measure angles. Movement begins from the pole, similar 
to the origin in rectangular coordinates. Rotation begins from polar axis, which 
corresponds to the positive x-axis of rectangular coordinates or the traditional 
initial side for an angle in standard position.

In the polar coordinate system, a point is located by a radius, or distance 
from the pole, and an angle, representing a rotation, which you can think of as an 
angle in standard form. The ordered pair that denotes a point is given in the form 
(r, θ), where r is the radius, or distance from the pole, and θ is the angle.
To plot the point 3 4

Multiple representations
One of the key features of polar coordinates is that a single point may be represented by more 
than one set of coordinates. In fact, each point in the plane has infinitely many sets of coordi-
nates. Because rotation can be counterclockwise or clockwise, a point like 4 3

Converting coordinates
To convert from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, given a point in rectangular coor-
dinates (x, y), first note in which quadrant the point lies. Use the Pythagorean theorem to calcu-
later
x
y
=
+
2
2 . Then find tan−1 y
x , which will give you a value between −π
2  and π
2 . If the point 
lies in quadrant I or IV, the value tan−1 y
x  returns is the value of θ. If the point falls in quadrant 
II or III, however, you’ll need to add π to the value produced by tan−1 y
x  to find the proper value 
of θ.
To convert the rectangular point 4
4

(
) to polar coordinates, first notice that it is a fourth-quad-
rant point. Then find r =

(

Because the point is in quadrant IV, you can use the value of tan−1 y
x  as θ, so the point can be 
named as 4 2

π . Of course, if you want to use a positive θ, you can express this as 4 2 7

and other representations are possible as well.
To convert the rectangular point −(

Find r =

For points that fall on the y-axis, a little extra work is required. If the point lies on the y-axis, 
tan−1 y
x will be undefined, and you’ll have to supply the value of θ yourself. If the point is on the 
positive y-axis, useθ
π
= 2 , and if the point is on the negative y-axis, useθ
π
= −2 . Note that those 
are the values for θ when using a positive value for r. The rectangular point 0 5,

To convert from polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates, use right triangle trigonom-

r

r

Polar equations
Equations in polar form generally express r in terms of θ and often define distinctive curves that 
would be difficult to represent in rectangular coordinates. In addition to the shape of the curve, 
you should pay attention to the direction in which it is traced out.
To sketch a graph, build a table of values and plot points, using values of θ in order and  
connecting as you go along. Because values of r may be negative, the graph may trace in unex-
pected ways. It can even trace over itself, because the periodic nature of the trig functions can

give multiple representations of the same point. Remember that most polar graphs are curves, so 
avoid straight-line connections.
Lines, circles, and spirals
A line passing through the pole can be represented simply by θ = c, where c is a constant. The 
line θ
π
= 2
3  passes through the pole. Other equations that produce lines include the vertical
line r
a
= cosθ and the horizontal liner
a
= sinθ. The general form of the equation of a line is

Limaçons and cardioids
Classic polar graphs include the limaçons, named for snails, and the heart-shaped cardioids. 
Limaçons have equations of the form r
a
b
=
± cosθ or r
a
b
=
± sinθ. If a
b
< , the limaçon will 
have an inner loop, but if a
b
> , there will be no inner loop. If a and b are equal, the special case 
of the limaçon is the cardioid, with equations of the form r
a
a
=
± cosθ orr
a
a
=
± sinθ. Equa-
tions based on the cosine will have graphs symmetric about the horizontal axis, while those 
involving the sine will be symmetric about the vertical axis.
Roses
Polar roses, which actually look more like daisies, have equations of the form r
a
b
=
(
)
cos
θ  or
r
a
b
=
(
)
sin
θ . The value of a gives the length of the petal, while b controls the number of petals. 
If b is an odd number, there will be b petals, but if b is even, there will be 2b petals. In fact, there 
are always 2b petals, but when b is odd, petals trace on top of one another, so only half the petals 
are seen, while for even values of b, all the petals are visible.
Conics
Conic sections with focus at the pole have equations of the form r
ep
e
= ±

cosθ  orr
ep
e
= ±
1
sinθ, 
where p is the distance from the pole to the directrix and e is the eccentricity of the conic. The 
eccentricity of an ellipse is 0 < e < 1, the eccentricity of a hyperbola is e > 1, and the parabola has 
e = 1. The equation

Complex numbers
In the set of real numbers, the equation x2

+ =
 has no solution, an unsatisfying 
fact. No one likes to face a problem and have to say that it can’t be solved. Some-
times there’s no other choice, but in the case of quadratic equations, mathemati-
cians were able to define a new set of numbers that literally solved the problem.
Defining an imaginary unit i =
−1  not only provides a solution for that 
equation but also generates a system of imaginary numbers of the form ai  for all 
real numbers a. These pure imaginary numbers include numbers like 2i, which 
squares to −4, and −9i, which squares to −81.
When you begin to combine these imaginary numbers with the real num-
bers, you form a new set of numbers, called the complex numbers, which includes 
the reals and the imaginaries and all the combinations. The complex numbers are 
all numbers of the forma
bi
+
, where a is a real number and bi is an imaginary 
number. The real numbers have the forma
i
+ 0 , and the imaginaries have the form
0 + bi. Examples of complex numbers include 3
7
−i and 1
2

+
i.
Graphing complex numbers
When you graph in the Cartesian coordinate plane, each point in the plane cor-
responds to an ordered pair of real numbers. There is no place in that system for 
complex numbers. If you keep the rectangular coordinate system, but redefine the 
axes so that the horizontal axis represents the real numbers and the vertical axis 
represents the imaginary numbers, then each point in the plane (a, b) corresponds 
to a complex number.

The complex number 4
5
−i  corresponds to the point 4
5
,−
(
), and the point −
(
)
3 1,
 represents 
the complex number −+
3
i. All numbers of the form a
i
+ 0  lie on the horizontal axis, and all num-
bers of the form 0 + bi  lie on the vertical axis.
For any complex number a
bi
+
, there is a point in the plane a b,
(
). The reflection of that point 
across the x-axis is the point a
b
,−
(
), which corresponds to the number a
bi
−
. The point a b,
(
) 
and its reflection a
b
,−
(
)  represent the numbers a
bi
+
 and a
bi
−
, which are called complex con-
jugates. The conjugate of 3
7
+ i  is 3
7
−i, and the points that correspond to these numbers, 3 7,
(
)
and 3
7
,−
(
), are reflections of one another in the x-axis.
The pure imaginaries lie on the vertical axis, are represented by points of the form 0,b
(
), and have 
the form 0 + bi  or simply bi. The conjugate of a pure imaginary number bi  is −bi. The reflection of 
0,b
(
) is 0,−
(
)
b . The imaginary number 5i  has a conjugate of −5i. Notice that the reals lie on the x-axis 
and correspond to points of the form a,0
(
). Since they lie on the axis, they are unchanged by reflection, 
so a real number—depending on your point of view—has no conjugate or is its own conjugate.
When a complex number has been plotted as a point in the plane, it is possible to calculate the 
distance of that point from the origin. That distance is called the modulus of the complex number. 
The point that represents the complex number a
bi
+
 has coordinates a b,

the origin and the point a b,

Arithmetic of complex numbers
The arithmetic operations on complex numbers are similar to other operations from algebra. In 
basic algebra, you learned to add and subtract by combining like terms. When adding and sub-
tracting complex numbers, you’ll combine the real parts with real parts and imaginary parts with 
imaginary parts.
If you remember that the imaginary unit i is defined as the square root of −1, you’ll see that 
the rules for multiplication and division are similar to those you learned for working with radi-
cals. To multiply5 2 4 2
⋅
, you multiply5 4
2
2
20 4

⋅⋅
⋅
=
=
⋅=
, multiplying the num-
bers outside the radicals together and the numbers under the radical together. Because you knew 
the square root of 4, you could replace it with its value and eliminate the radical. When you mul-
tiply imaginary numbers, you’ll multiply the coefficients together and multiply the is, replacing i2 
with −1. Just as you don’t actually divide by a radical, but rather rationalize the denominator, 
you’ll use similar techniques with complex numbers.
Addition and subtraction
Adding or subtracting complex numbers is similar to combining like terms when adding or sub-
tracting binomials. The real parts are added and the imaginary parts are added. Attention should 
be paid to signs when subtracting. Remember that the minus sign affects the entire number that 
follows it:

Multiplication and powers

there are a variety of cases to consider when talking about multiplication. You already know how

Complex numbers	 101
There is no true division by imaginary or complex numbers, but becausei =
−1 , the tech-
niques of rationalizing denominators are used to simplify quotients. Remember the imaginary 
unit is effectively a radical expression.
Dividing by a pure imaginary number requires rationalizing the denominator by multiply-
ing the numerator and denominator by i and replacing i2 with −1:

To rationalize a denominator that is a complex number rather than a pure imaginary, you’ll 
need to multiply by the conjugate of the denominator. The numbers a

bi

 are com-
plex conjugates. If you multiply a complex number and its conjugate, for example, 2

Multiplication and division
One of the advantages of representing complex numbers in trigonometric form is that it provides 
a simple method of multiplying and dividing complex numbers. To multiply complex numbers in 
rectangular form, you must foil and simplify. To divide complex numbers in rectangular form, 
you need to rationalize the denominator. Both can be done, but can be tedious.

you did the obvious steps every time:

Remember the two shortcuts for multiplication and division of complex numbers in trigo­
nometric form:
To multiply two numbers in trigonometric form, multiply the
◆◆
 rs and add the θs.
To divide, divide the 
◆◆
rs and subtract the θs.
Express each product in simplest form.

Powers and roots
Because powers are repeated multiplication, the technique for multiplying complex numbers in 
trigonometric form can be extended to find powers of complex numbers. With a little help from 
multiple representations, the rule can also be used to find roots of complex numbers in trigono-
metric form.

for powers and the ability to represent roots as fractional exponents. You know that

The problem is that, over the complex numbers, every number should have n nth roots—two 
square roots, three cube roots, five fifth roots, and so on—but this rule only seems to produce one 
root. Where will you find the others? The answer comes from the fact that each complex number 
has infinitely many representations in trigonometric coordinates.
To find all n nth roots of a complex number, start with n representations of the number, 
formed by adding 2π to the value of θ. For example, to find the three cube roots of

A vector is a directed distance, a movement from an initial point to a terminal 
point. The following figure shows a vector with its initial point at (2, 3) and its 
terminal point at (5, 7). The vector from point P to point Q can be represented as 
PQ

by boldface lowercase letters, such as u and v.

P (2, 3) 
A vector may be used to represent a force acting on an object. The length of the 
vector represents the magnitude of the force, while the orientation of the vector 
shows the direction of the force. A vector that represents the force of gravity acting 
on an object would show a downward movement, perpendicular to the earth’s sur-
face, with a magnitude equal to the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 meters per sec-
ond squared or 32 feet per second squared) times the mass of the object.
Representing vectors
A vector can be specified by identifying its initial and terminal points, by specify-
ing its magnitude and direction, or by resolving the movement into its horizontal 
and vertical components. Each of these representations has advantages in differ-
ent situations, and you’ll want to be able to convert from one representation to 
another.
A polar coordinate style of notation v =[
]
r,θ  can be used to give the magni-
tude or length of the vector and its direction. The notation u = 

the vector is 5 units long and makes an angle of π

tor may be oblique, that movement can be accomplished by moving first left or right and then up or 
down. If you think about counting out the slope of a line, you’ll see how this oblique movement can 
resolve into horizontal and vertical components. This component representation is in keeping with a 
rectangular coordinate system, but each number in the vector representation is the difference of  
coordinates, not the coordinates themselves. The vector v that has initial point x y

If you are familiar with matrix arithmetic, you can think of a vector in component form as 
a small matrix. Generally, vectors are represented either as row matrices or as column matrices. 
Understanding vectors in this way may help you with some of the arithmetic of vectors.
If you know the initial and terminal points of the vector, you can find the magnitude by

Changing forms
To represent a directed distance, you need to specify both the distance and the direction. Those 
pieces of information can easily be communicated in trigonometric form, with r giving the dis-
tance and θ the direction. If you’re working from the initial and terminal points of the vector, 
finding the magnitude and direction can be complicated calculations. If you’re given a vector 
in trigonometric form, it can be hard to measure out the distance and direction. On the other 
hand, if you know the initial and terminal points of the vector, the component form is easy to 
find, and easy to draw, but doesn’t directly communicate the distance and direction. So each 
form has its advantages and disadvantages, and you’ll sometimes want to change form.
To resolve a vector that is given in trigonometric notation into its horizontal and vertical com-
ponents, use the same strategy you used to convert coordinates from trigonometric to rectangular 
form. The horizontal component is x
r
= cosθ, and the vertical component is y
r
= sinθ. A vector 
expressed in trigonometric form as r,θ
[

Addition of vectors
When two vectors with the same direction are applied to the same object, the second movement 
follows the first, in the same direction, and the result is a vector whose magnitude is the addition 
of the magnitudes of the individual vectors and whose direction is the same as that of the indi-
vidual vectors. If u = 

If two vectors act on the same object but the directions are opposite, they have a canceling 
effect on one another, with the larger magnitude winning out. The result is a vector with a mag-
nitude equal to the difference of the magnitudes and a direction that matches that of the vector 
with the larger magnitude. If u = 

If the directions of the vectors are neither identical nor opposite, however, trigonometry 
is necessary to find the sum, or resultant vector. Graphically, addition of two vectors, u and v, 
can be represented by placing the initial point of v at the terminal point of u, then drawing a 
vector from the initial point of u to the terminal point of v. This resultant vector represents the 
sum u + v.

gin down into the third quadrant. If you place the initial point of v at the terminal point of u and 
draw the resultant, you can see it moves left and just slightly down from the horizontal. Calculate 
r with the law of cosines. Don’t be tempted by the 3 and 4 to believe that r is 5. This is not a right

often simpler, as a result, to resolve the vector into its component form, add, and then find the 
magnitude and direction of the resultant. This may seem roundabout, but because the individual 
calculations are generally simpler, it’s often the preferred method. To add u = 

Scalar multiplication
A scalar is a single number that can affect a vector. It gets the name “scalar” because it changes 
the scale, or magnitude, of the vector. Multiplying by a scalar, c, has the effect of placing c copies 
of the vector end to end, or adding c copies of the vector.
If a vector represented in trigonometric form, r,θ
[
], is multiplied by a scalar, c, the result is 
cr,θ
[
]. Multiplying 3 5
6
, π



 by 7 gives you 21 5
6
, π



. If the scalar is positive, the direction of the 
vector is unchanged. If the scalar is negative, however, the multiplication will change the sign of 
r, which reverses the vector.
A vector in component form, a b,
, multiplied by a scalar, c, gives the vector ca cb
,
. If you 
multiply the vector 4
7
,−
 by 5, you get the vector 20
35
,−
.
Scalar multiplication corresponds exactly to multiplication of a matrix by a scalar. In matrix 
arithmetic, each element of the matrix is multiplied by the scalar. If the vector in component 
form is viewed as a matrix, each component is multiplied by the scalar.
Subtraction of vectors
Subtracting can be viewed as a combination of multiplying one vector by the scalar −1 and add-
ing. For vectors in component form, if u = a b,

Multiplication of vectors
There are two ways to multiply vectors: one that produces a scalar and one that produces a vector. 
The multiplication that produces a scalar is called the dot product, while the multiplication that pro-
duces a vector is called the cross product. Because the cross product results in a vector that is not in 
the same plane as the two original vectors, it doesn’t fall within the scope of this chapter. The dot 
product, however, is a scalar and gives information about the two vectors in the plane.
Dot products
The dot product gives information about the angle between the vectors. If the angle is acute, the 
dot product will be positive. If the angle is obtuse, the dot product will be negative. Vectors at 
right angles have a dot product of 0.
If u and v are vectors in component form with u = a b,
 and v = c d
,
, then the dot product 
u v⋅ is a scalar given by u v⋅
=

, because the magnitudes of the vectors will be 
nonzero. The cosine of the angle between the vectors is equal to 0 when the angle is π
2 . The angle 
between orthogonal vectors therefore is π
2 , so the vectors are perpendicular.
To determine if two vectors in component form are orthogonal, calculate the dot product.

Determining whether vectors given in trigonometric form are orthogonal is a simpler mat-
ter, because you know the direction angle of each vector. You can calculate the angle between the 
vectors directly. If either angle is greater than 2π, find the coterminal angle between 0 and 2π.
Subtract the angles. If the result is π
2 ( or −π
2 ), the vectors are orthogonal.
