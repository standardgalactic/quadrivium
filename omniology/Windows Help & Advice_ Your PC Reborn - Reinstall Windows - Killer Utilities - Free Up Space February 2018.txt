The Knowledge…
You have to applaud Microsoft’s hardware 
tactics: it’s dominating in the Windows tablet 
market by producing a best-in-class device, 
and the Surface Book 2 marks its attempt to 
do the same in the laptop world. While it’s 
visually identical to the first generation 
Surface Book – not a bad thing, by any 
means – there’s a host of improvements 
inside. The price might be a bit steep though; 
the 13-inch model starts at £1,500. You can 
read our review of the 15-incher on page 78.
Connect your home  
with a digital assistant
Talk to your tech
Smart speakers, and the digital assistants 
they contain, are taking off. Amazon has 
just released the latest generation of its 
Alexa-toting Echo kit, with the supremely 
affordable £49 Echo Dot joined by the 
new Echo (£89) and the even-smarter 
Echo Plus (£129). Google’s pushing forward 
with its own range of Google Assistant 
devices, featuring the also-affordable 
Google Home Mini (£49) and the less-
affordable, but still great Google Home 
(£129). Even Apple’s 
digging in – early 
2018 will see the 
release of its higher 
priced Siri-powered 
HomePod – and 
Microsoft’s Cortana 
has now made its 
way into the Harman Kardon Invoke.
Now that’s smart
So what’s the big deal? A digital assistant is 
a great way to stay organised, taking the 
drudgery out of setting reminders and 
calendar entries. Using the likes of Alexa 
and Siri you can simply speak your request 
and get it done straight away. You can find 
out facts and get news headlines, or play 
music or podcasts with a couple of words.
If you want to take things further, 
installing smart plugs and bulbs in your 
home makes managing your appliances 
and lights a breeze, and services such as 
IFTTT (If This Then That), or Amazon’s own 
Alexa app, can help you automate actions. 
You could just say ‘good night’ to your 
smart assistant and have everything 
power down 
automatically, with 
the lights slowly 
dimming to create a 
calming atmosphere. 
Try it. Android 
phones generally 
respond to the 
command ‘OK Google’, Apple phones 
with ‘Hey Siri’ – fire them up and have a 
chat, see what you can do. Switch on 
Cortana integration in Windows 10, then 
click the microphone button to talk to 
Microsoft’s assistant. If extending their 
capabilities to controlling your home 
seems attractive, you know what to do.
amazon, google, apple – the big names in the tech world 
are all contributing to the smart home revolution
Windows Sets
Sets? Don’t you mean tabs?
Well, yes. We do. Far be it for us to be a  
bit facetious, but that’s precisely what  
sets are: a way of using intelligent tabs 
that group together all the open windows 
of your apps into a single manageable 
whole. Want to switch between open 
documents? Just click the appropriate tab.
Can’t I just do that with the Taskbar?
Not like this. Sets won’t force you to group 
together the open windows of a single 
app – you’ll be able to combine multiple 
apps into a single entity. You might have a 
set, for example, with an open Word 
document, a browser in which you’re 
doing research, an Excel spreadsheet to 
pull numbers from. Minimise or resize the 
set, and every app is affected.
Does it work with everything?
We don’t expect for Sets to work with 
every app from the outset, since it’s 
probably going to be something that 
requires a little extra coding, but Microsoft 
is aiming to get all of its Universal 
Windows Apps working with the Sets 
system when it’s eventually released.
Does it do anything else?
The fact that Sets will be applied to 
Universal apps means you should, all 
being well, be able to create a set on your 
desktop and move it onto a mobile device 
or to another machine seamlessly, picking 
up exactly where you left off. This is only 
likely to happen if the Sets concept really 
takes off though: it’s not going to be an 
easy one to implement.
When can I start using it?
Absolutely no idea. Microsoft has only just 
started rolling out the feature to its earliest 
testers. There’s a long way to go, and a lot 
of feedback to work through, before it’s 
going to be ready to roll out to standard 
desktop users. Our money wouldn’t be on 
it landing in the next major update – you 
might be waiting until the end of 2018.

HP has recently come under fire for its use 
of an app called Touchpoint Analytics. 
Silently installed into Windows 10 on its 
new laptops, the app stands accused of 
sending vast amounts of data back to HP’s 
labs. HP’s defence is that Touchpoint 
Analytics is an app that’s been around for 
some years under a different name, and 
the company claims it merely collects 
anonymised information about hardware 
performance, perfect for support. 
Innocent or not, the app negatively 
affects PC 
performance 
while it does its 
thing, which has 
many users up in 
arms, though it’s 
easily scrubbed 
away through 
Windows 10’s 
standard uninstall 
procedure.
Not all pre-installed software is quite so 
benign. Lenovo’s 2015 decision to ship 
laptops with a package named 
VisualDiscovery – which inserted ads into 
Google searches and could potentially 
access sensitive personal information – 
has now cost it $3.5 million in fines from 
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the 
United States, and Lenovo is required to 
adhere to a number of sanctions relating 
to its use of pre-installed software. Even 
after this very public and costly mistake, 
though, pre-installed software is not 
going anywhere. If anything we’ve seen 
the volume of so-called ‘bloatware’ 
growing in the PCs that have passed 
through our labs recently.
Here’s the good news: It’s very rare that 
anything that comes pre-installed on a PC 
is actively required for that machine to 
run properly. The vast majority of 
bloatware can – and probably should – 
be safely removed via the usual channels 
the instant you 
boot your new 
PC for the first 
time, provided 
the software 
doesn’t have its 
hooks in too 
deep. If you’re 
really struggling 
to remove 
something, a 
third-party tool might do the trick. The PC 
Decrapifier (pcdecrapifier.com) will 
automatically sift through your machine 
looking for pointless performance-
lowering apps and get rid of them 
automatically. If you stumble upon a 
particularly stubborn app that even the 
Decrapifier can’t get rid of, search for it 
online – it’s likely you’ll find a special 
removal tool, or (less likely) a reason to 
leave it installed.
Can you really trust the apps that are shipped with your 
new PC – and how do you set about getting rid of them?

If you have more than a couple of online

someone who refuses to use your chat 
app of choice. That one person who 
insists on using WhatsApp instead of 
Google Hangouts, forcing you to talk on

pinging you via Facebook Messenger. 
That one Slack group that you absolutely 
need to keep on top of. Keeping tabs on

Franz solves that problem: Completely 
free to use – unless you fancy chipping in  
a little to support its development – it 
combines a huge list of chat services  
into a one-stop-shop of online 
communication. Sign up with all your chat 
apps once and you can then install Franz 
on a different machine, sign in with your

Yes, you read that right. Nvidia wants £2,700 for a PC graphics card. But this is no 
ordinary graphics card. It’s the most powerful graphics card you’ve ever seen.
Designed to meet the exacting demands of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 
machine learning technologies, the Titan V is capable of delivering 110 teraflops 
of computational grunt. That’s nine times the power of its predecessor, the Titan 
Xp; and 110 times the power of the most powerful desktop PC processor you 
can buy today – Intel’s one teraflop Core i9 Extreme Edition.
Powered by Nvidia’s Volta technology, the Titan V packs 21.1 billion transistors 
on to an 815mm chip, and has 12GB of HBM2 memory. So powerful is the Titan 
V that there’s only other one card that bears comparison – the datacentre-
focused, 112-teraflop Nvidia Tesla V100, and that costs a cool £10,500.

rustrated by your 
PC’s lethargic 
performance? 
Worried by 
persistent 
niggles, from minor glitches to 
major crashes? Unless your PC’s 
problem is hardware-related, the 
obvious solution is to blow things 
up and start from scratch with a 
brand new reinstall.
But reinstalling Windows in 
this way isn’t always the logical 
solution. Sure, it wipes things 
clean and gives you a completely 
fresh slate, but there’s a lot of 
effort involved, and – despite our 
tips and techniques – it isn’t 
always possible to recreate things 
exactly the way you want.
Rather than reach for the 
nuclear button every time you 
sense something is wrong, why 
not see if you can regenerate 
your existing Windows 
installation instead? We’re going 
to help you do exactly that.
We’ll kick things off by giving 
your machine a health check, 
guiding you towards the tools 
you need to make sure that 
everything is working as it 
should. Then it’s time to clear  
out the junk – whether it’s simply 
superfluous or something more 
sinister, like a potentially 
unwanted program.
We’ll also look at how you can 
free up storage through judicious 
archiving of content as well as 
consolidating all your files and 
backups so you’re not wasting 
space with extraneous copies of 
files. Then we’ll reveal ways in 
which you can streamline your 
PC’s performance further, giving 
you a Windows installation that 
has a factory-fresh feel about it.
If after all that you still want to 
reinstall Windows, we’ll show you 
how to do that too.

Breathe new life into your Windows PC with our 
essential guide to fixing, cleaning and tweaking your 
system for optimum performance

12  |  
  |  January 2018
I
f your PC is constantly 
falling over, or you’re 
suffering performance-
related issues with no 
obvious cause, the best 
thing to do is give your 
PC a checkup. Start by performing a 
physical examination of the underlying 
hardware. First, perform a power reset: 
this involves powering down your PC, 
then unplugging it from the mains and 
pressing the power button a few times 
to ensure all lingering power has been 
discharged (in the case of a laptop, 
you’ll need to disconnect the battery 
too before pressing the power button).
While your PC is switched off, check 
that its vents aren’t clogged with dust 
– overheating not only shortens the life 
of your PC’s components, it also affects 
performance and can be responsible for 
seemingly random shutdowns. Use a 
tool like Speccy (www.piriform.com) to 
monitor your PC’s temperature sensors. 
A well-ventilated desktop CPU should 
run at no more than 50 degrees Celsius 
in normal use, and no more than 60-65 
degrees when it’s working hard. Laptop 
processors run hotter, of course, while 
hard drives should run cooler.
A visual inspection
If your desktop PC’s vents seem clean, 
consider opening it up to check the fans 
inside too. Make sure it’s switched off at 
the power socket and that you earth 
yourself before touching the insides. 
The first place to check are the fans, 
specifically the one attached to your 
processor, plus the one in your power 
supply and any other case fans there 
might be. If they’re all clean, consider 
disconnecting the hard drives 
temporarily and powering up the PC 
with the case open. Inspect the fans 
while the PC boots to the BIOS to see if 
there’s any indications of wear and tear 
– strange noises, for example.
If the fans check out, power down again 
and remove the processor fan and 
heatsink to check the connection with 
the processor itself. A thin coating of 
thermal paste should be present – if it 
has worn away, you’ll either have to 
carefully apply a new coat or consider 
replacing the heatsink and fan. 
Larger fans – if your PC case can 
accommodate them – run cooler and 
quieter, but be sure to source the 
correct fan for your processor make and 
model – see www.quietpc.com/
cpu-fan-coolers for more details.
Dodgy power supply fans will require 
the power supply itself to be replaced. 
Be sure to pick the same size – the 
standard ATX measures 86x150x140mm 
– and at least the same power rating, 
although look to source a 400W power 
supply as a bare minimum, or higher if 
you are able to afford it. 
rAM and hard drive
Faulty memory and failing hard drives 
often manifest themselves as random 
problems rather than consistent ones. 
Perform a quick check of your RAM by 
typing ‘memory’ into the Search box 
and opening the Windows Memory 
Diagnostic tool. The check is performed 
outside Windows, so opt whether to run  
 
it now or when you next reboot. Any 
failures point to faulty RAM – if you have 
more than one stick installed, open up 
your PC and remove each one in turn to 
test them separately. Replace like with 
like using the Crucial Advisor tool (www.
crucial.com/uk) to identify the correct 
module for your machine.
You can also check your hard drives’ 
physical health using the Speccy app via 
its Storage section. Check each drive’s 
SMART status – anything that’s not rated 
good indicates the drive is on its way 
out. Replace it as soon as you can, and 
be sure to back up its contents so your 
files are safe if the drive goes south.
Your Windows installation may also 
require a bit of TLC. You can get an 
at-a-glance view of the health of your PC 
by typing ‘reliability’ into the Search box 
and clicking View Reliability History. You 
can see a list of critical errors as well as 
handy informational events, such as 
driver or Windows updates. The lower 
the score, the more help your PC needs. 
Follow the step-by-step guide on the 
facing page to get the Windows Repair 
tool to run some system diagnostics 
tools, then check its collection of repairs 
– 47 and counting. If any match specific 
symptoms that you’ve been having, they 
may be the cure to your ills.

run System File Check
The final pre-repair step is to run System File Check – this 
can fix all manner of problems if errors are found, but make sure 
you’ve resolved any missing Windows packages first as otherwise 
it may fail. Once done, click ‘>’ and create both a Registry Backup 
and a System Restore point using the buttons provided.

Scan for errors
The pre-scan scans three specific parts of your system for 
potential issues – click Start Scan. Reparse or environment errors 
can be fixed using the repair tools provided; visit www.catalog.

Clean up the junk
Take a virtual vacuum to your PC, sucking up unnecessary  
and unwanted trash to free up system resources
hy take a feather duster 
to clean out your PC 
when our supercharged 
vacuum cleaning toolkit 
can do a much better 
job? Let’s start by 
making sure your PC is malware-free. 
Open your existing security tool and 
make sure it’s updated, then run a full 
system scan. If malware is found, let the 
tool clean it, then reboot and scan 
again. If the malware’s proving tricky to 
budge, try rebooting your PC in Safe 
mode and then running your anti-
malware tool from there.
Never rely on a single security tool 
– we recommend that you install 
Malwarebytes (www.malwarebytes.com) 
alongside your existing security 
package. It’ll often find threats ignored 
by traditional tools. For an in-depth 
guide to checking and removing 
malware from your PC, check out our 
November 2017 issue.
remove junk
The November 2017 issue also covers 
ways in which you can remove 
potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) 
from your PC. Malwarebytes can remove 
some, but also try the aptly-named PC 
Decrapifier tool (www.pcdecrapifier.
com), which will help identify programs 
you should consider removing.
While PC Decrapifier can remove 
these unwanted tools for you, relying on 
a program’s own uninstall tool to clean 
up after itself is – charitably speaking – 
hit and miss. A more thorough way to 
get rid of programs is by downloading 
and installing IOBit Uninstaller Free 
(www.iobit.com – look under Utilities). 
Once installed, launch the program. 
By default, it’ll display a list of installed 
desktop programs. You can click the bin 
icon next to any one to remove it, or go 
through the list ticking all those 
applications you no longer want before 
clicking Uninstall to remove them in 
sequence. You’ll be asked if you want to 
automatically remove residual files (and 
Registry entries) – untick this if you’d like 
to review what’s removed first. Setting  
a System Restore point is not usually 
necessary, unless you are removing  
lots of programs at once.
Avoid Registry cleaning
You’ll notice we recommend 
de-selecting PrivaZer’s Registry 
cleaning component – and for 
good reason. Cleaning Registry 
entries has zero effect on your 
computer’s performance, but 
one false misstep and you can 
cause major problems that 
could ultimately bring your 
PC’s installation crashing down. 
Don’t believe us? Support 
Squad is littered with emails 
from people who’ve relied on 
Registry cleaning tools only to 
find that their systems have 
been crippled as a result.
The only exception to this 
rule is when you use IOBit 
Uninstaller to remove 
programs from your PC. It’s 
specifically looking for entries 
related to the program you’re 
uninstalling, which means you 
can make a measured 
judgement about whether 
they’re safe to remove or not.
If you’re not convinced, then 
at least take a System Restore 
point before you clean out the 
Registry. Also make sure ‘Save 
registry’ is ticked on PrivaZer’s 
scanning window before 
clicking Clean. If you run into 
problems, click the Restore 
button on the main screen and 
select Registry. Restore the 
latest backup to see if that fixes 
the problem; if not, try using 
earlier backups until the critical 
entry is hopefully restored. 
Don’t trust your anti-virus tool to detect all malware? 
Install Malwarebytes for a second opinion.
IObit Uninstaller does a better job of cleaning 
up behind apps than their own uninstallers.
If you’re adamant that Registry cleaners are safe to use, please make  
sure you take backups for the day when you discover they’re not.

Choose your
Click ‘Advanced options’ under 
PrivaZer’s main menu, tick ‘Save registry 
changes made by next cleanups’, then 
click OK. By default, your entire computer 
is selected for scanning. You can choose a 
different option under ‘Which device’ to 
restrict it, if you wish. Leave ‘Scan 
in-depth’ selected and click OK.
2
Scan for items
By default, all the scans you have 
previously chosen are selected, along with 
your C drive – you will need to repeat for 
any other drives that you wish to check. 
Roll your cursor over one of PrivaZer’s 
options to learn more about it, then untick 
any that you want to exclude before 
clicking the Scan button.
3
review and clean
Once PrivaZer has completed its 
scan, click on an item to select it, then click 
the results to see what’s been found. 
Untick any categories that you don’t want 
to remove, such as jump lists and Registry 
entries, before clicking Clean to remove all 
the detritus that you’re happy for the 
utility to delete. Good luck!
Each program is removed in the same 
way: first its own uninstaller removes 
the program, then leftovers are either 
cleaned automatically or you can review 
what’s being deleted before choosing 
what – if any – of it to remove. Once 
done, move on to the Windows Apps 
section to clear out Microsoft Store 
apps, including those pre-installed with 
Windows itself (these can always be 
reinstalled later through the Store). 
Finally, use the Toolbars & Plug-ins  
tab to review and remove unwanted 
browser toolbars from all your browsers.
Dig deeper
Want to clean out other parts of your 
PC? Put off by the recent malware scare 
surrounding CCleaner? One alternative is 
PrivaZer – go to www.privazer.com to 
download and run the portable version. 
Start by setting the program’s scope: 
tweak Adapt PrivaZer to your needs, 
then click Next. Choose ‘Advanced’ to 
work through all 14 possible options. 
Each one is self-explanatory and 
basically tells PrivaZer how far you want 
to go with your cleaning – everything 
from cleaning out various software 
configuration files (such as Office or 
photo apps). In most cases, the 
recommended options are best left 
alone – the only question mark lies with 
disabling hibernation on Windows 10 
PCs, which may cause problems if you 
suffer a power cut during shutdown.
Once your preferences have been 
selected, choose the new file option and 
click OK. You’ll then be taken to the 
main menu – the step-by-step guide 
(below) reveals where to go from here. If 
in doubt, don’t delete anything. PrivaZer 
will securely overwrite any data it 
removes, so recovery will be impossible.
Niche cleaning
Want to go even further? If you’re 
regularly cursing at the number of fonts 
offered by your office software, why not 
take steps to remove those unused 
typefaces? You’ll not only benefit from a 
more manageable fonts menu, you’ll 
free up some additional system 
resources too. The best way to manage 
your font collection is using AMP Font 
Viewer (www.ampsoft.net/utilities/
FontViewer.php). Download and extract 
the portable version (ZIP file), then 
right-click FontViewer.exe and choose 
‘Run as administrator’. 
Go through the list identifying fonts 
you don’t use – right-click these and 
choose ‘Uninstall font’, which removes  
it completely. Fonts are moved to your 
Documents folder as a backup – choose 
Options > Options to choose a more 
convenient location. Should you ever 
want to restore a font, switch to the  
‘Not installed fonts’ tab, navigate to 
your backup folder and choose either 
‘Install selected font’ to put it back 
permanently, or ‘Install font temporarily’, 
which enables you to use the font until 
you restart Windows.
Clean your storage drive
“Setting a System Restore point is  
not usually necessary, unless you are 
removing lots of programs at once”
AMP Font Viewer lets you remove unwanted fonts.

O
ver time, your machine’s 
drive becomes cluttered 
up with data files of all 
shapes, sizes and types. 
Compounding things  
are the way in which 
duplicates can quickly swallow up more 
storage space thanks to disorganised 
backups or the fact you have five 
near-identical copies for every snap you 
take on your phone or digital camera. 
The longer this process goes on, the 
harder it can be to face up to the 
problem, but today’s the day you finally 
take steps to not only consolidate your 
files properly, but free up space too.
First steps
For this process to work, you need to 
work out where you are going to store 
everything. You also need to remember 
that moving files to a secondary drive 
isn’t the same as backing them up if 
they remain the only copy in existence, 
so be sure to keep two copies of key 
files on separate drives. 
Start by taking an inventory of all the 
available drives: your PC’s internal drive 
or drives, plus any external (USB or 
network) drives that you possess. First, 
determine how you’d like to organise 
them going forward. Use a spreadsheet 
or note-taking tool to help you visualise 
what you’d like to do.
If you want to take an inventory of 
each drive’s contents for manually 
comparing it, then save yourself a huge 
task by installing the trial version of 
WinCatalog 2017 (www.wincatalog.com/
free.html). The trial supports up to 10 
disks per catalogue, which should be 
ample for cataloguing your drives – a 
personal licence costs £25 if you need it.
Once installed, launch the program 
and create a catalogue file when 
prompted. Then click the Disk button to 
select your first drive. Click ‘Options’ to 
choose exactly what to add to the 
catalogue – you may wish to restrict it to 
covering specific content, or even just 
provide a list of folders, which will speed 
up the scanning process considerably, 
although you’ll be limited in what you 
can do with the program.
Once your drives have been indexed 
– which can take a while – you can then 
start to see how data is currently spread 
across your drives, making it easy to 
visualise where you’d like your files to 
go. If you index everything on your 
drives, you can even use WinCatalog’s 
Search tool to try and track down files 
you’ve mislaid – perhaps they weren’t 
accidentally deleted after all, merely 
buried deep inside your file system.
Get rid of duplicates
One of the most important actions 
when consolidating your files is to weed 
out duplicates. Not only will you free up 
stacks of space, you’ll avoid wondering 
what happened to your recent edits 
because you’ve opened the wrong copy 
of a file. WinCatalog’s search tool can 
locate duplicates by filename, size and 
date modified – expand the Property 
pane to locate it, then click  the ellipsis 
(…) to select other criteria to match, 
such as the CRC32 checksum.
The search tool is lightning fast – 
results are returned instantly, but 
remember you are only working within 
its catalogue, not the physical files 
themselves. If you want to remove 
duplicates, you’ll have to right-click each 
duplicate in turn and choose ‘Open in 
Explorer’ to manually delete it yourself.
Too much hassle? This is where 
Duplicate Cleaner Free comes in, and 
the step-by-step guide on the opposite 
page reveals how to use it to weed out 
and remove exact duplicates. If your 
storage drive is stuffed full of similar 
files – such as multiple photos that are 
almost identical from your phone or 
camera – then upgrade to the Pro 
version for £20, or try AntiDupl (https://
sourceforge.net/projects/antidupl) 
instead, which can be configured to 
match similar as well as identical files.
Once you have removed unnecessary 
files, you can then look to consolidate all 
the ones that remain in a way that will 
enable you to easily find them going 
forward. If possible, store these on a 
separate partition or drive to your 
Windows installation, so the next time 
you reinstall you don’t have to worry 
about backing up and restoring your 
data first – although you should still 
make sure you regularly back up these 
files to yet another drive for safe-
keeping – just in case you have a 
problem with your PC down the road.
“One of the most important actions 
when consolidating your files is to 
weed out unecessary duplicates”

Take your cleaning one step further by reorganising and 
consolidating your data files to free up storage space

Use the ‘Image preview’ button to compare two photos 
side-by-side if you need more clarification. You can also use the 
View buttons to choose a different way of comparing files – 
handy for checking photo thumbnails quickly. Once you’re happy, 
click ‘File removal…’. Review the warning and click ‘Delete files’.

Set unwanted folder
Click the right-hand button next to the ‘Folder name:’ box 
to select your path. Now click the bottom-most Mark button to

Select scan folders
Switch to the Scan Location tab to select one or more 
drives or folders to search. Select one in the left-hand pane, then 
click ‘>’ to move it to the right. Decide if you’re searching for 
sub-folders or not – click Protected if you want to make it 
impossible to delete files from a specific folder.

Click ‘Start Scan’ and wait while the folders are 
searched. A list of matching files – conveniently colour-coded 
to help you determine duplicate pairs – will be displayed. To 
clear everything from a specific location, select one of the files 
from that location and choose ‘Mark by Location…’

Choose your criteria
Download Duplicate Cleaner Free (www.digitalvolcano.
co.uk/duplicatecleaner.html), then install and launch the program. 
By default, the most accurate type of search – a file’s content – is 
selected, but you can choose to search by different criteria – file 
name, size and so on – if you prefer.
2
Choose a file filter
Click ‘Select’ to quickly set a search filter for specific files 
by type. These limits aren’t comprehensive, so add your own file 
types to the end of the Included list (*.docx and *.rtf for text files,  
for example), separating each with a semi-colon. You can set file 
size and date limits too if you wish.

B
eneath the surface of 
Windows lies a seething  
mass of programs, 
services and other 
system files all 
competing for a share of 
finite resources. It doesn’t matter how 
many cores your processor has, how 
much RAM you stuff into your PC or 
whether you switch to an uber-fast 
solid-state drive (SSD), your PC finds a 
way of gobbling up everything you 
throw at it. In this section, we’re going 
to show you how to rein it in.
Tame startup
The problems begin the moment 
Windows appears to have finished 
loading. If your computer had a stomach 
it would be doubled over with 
indigestion the way start-up programs 
and services start demanding attention 
even before you have managed to log 
into your user account.
In the October 2017 issue we took a 
detailed look at BootRacer (www.greatis.
com/bootracer), a tool for monitoring 
and improving the boot times of your 
PC. It also includes Startup Control, a 
handy tool which delays start-up items 
until Windows has finished loading 
itself, then lets you see exactly how long 
each item takes to load. Not only can 
you disable and delete start-up items, 
you can swap their running order 
around too – click Set Order on the main 
Startup Control window and use the 
arrow keys to either side of a boot entry 
to move it up and down the list.
If you want even more control over 
startup, including viewing hidden parts 
of the start-up process, download 
Autoruns from https://docs.microsoft.
com/en-us/sysinternals/ – look under 
Process Utilities. Unzip its contents and 
run Autoruns.exe (32-bit) or Autoruns64.
exe (64-bit) by right-clicking it and 
choosing ‘Run as administrator’.
You’ll see a bewildering number of 
tabs appear – the Logon tab closely 
resembles what’s shown by BootRacer, 
but it also includes additional entries. 
Some tabs are – thankfully – empty but 
focus your eye on Scheduled Tasks as 
well as Explorer. Look for items marked 
in red or yellow – try disabling these 
Improve hardware performance
Looking for ways to tweak your 
PC hardware? Start by making 
sure you have the latest drivers 
for key components, such as 
your graphics card. If you’ve 
been relying on Windows 
Update to deliver these, try 
visiting the manufacturer’s site 
directly to see if a newer driver 
is available. Alternatively, try a 
driver-sourcing tool such as 
IObit’s Driver Booster (www.
iobit.com – look under 
Performance), which can do  
all the grunt work for you.
One of the biggest 
bottlenecks in your PC is its 
hard drive. Type ‘defrag’ into 
the Search box and open the 
‘Defragment and Optimise 
Drives’ tool. This will enable 
you to see if your SSD drives 
are optimised and your 
non-SSD drives defragged. 
Ultimately, if you have an SSD 
drive, there’s little you can do 
to improve performance, and 
most optimisations have  
a negligible effect.
Non-SSD users might want 
to try Defraggler (www.
piriform.com/defraggler) 
instead of the default Windows 
utility. Advantages include 
being able to defrag individual 
files and folders on demand, 
plus the tool can defrag system 
files and move larger files to 
the end of the drive to help 
boost performance further.
Streamline your PC
Find out how to get Windows back into something like the  
shape it was in when you performed your last reinstall
Click ‘Customize’ to flag non-Windows processes 
and services you’d like JetBoost to close.
Defraggler provides you with more options for defragging your non-SSD 
drives, potentially helping push performance that little bit further.
Autoruns gives you the most comprehensive 
overview of what’s starting up with Windows.

“Not only can you delete and disable 
start-up items, you can swap their 
running order around too”
first by unticking them; later you can 
right-click them to delete them, and 
perform other tasks such as choosing 
Check VirusTotal to upload the file in 
question for a malware scan online.
Bring services into line
You’ll notice a Services tab in Autoruns, 
which mirrors what’s shown when you 
press [Win] + [R] and type ‘services.msc’ 
into the Run box. These system 
programs run in the background and 
while most are linked to Windows, not 
all are. Not all are necessary and if you 
want a quick and dirty speed boost, 
installing Easy Service Optimizer (www.
sordum.org/?p=8637) will enable you to 
choose one of four presets depending 
on what services you’re willing to 
sacrifice in the name of performance. If 
you want to temporarily suspend 
non-essential services when performing 
resource-heavy tasks, such as playing 
games or ripping high definition (HD) 
video, then try JetBoost (www.
bluesprig.com/jetboost.html) instead.
Services compete for resources like 
everything else, but did you know it’s 
possible to allocate different priorities to 
services and programs to give favoured 
apps more access to those precious 
resources? You can do this via Task 
Manager (right-click the Taskbar to open 
it) – switch to More Details view. Locate 
your target app under Processes, 
right-click it and choose ‘Go to Details’. 
Right-click the highlighted process and 
choose Set Priority to see your options.
Whatever you do, avoid ‘Realtime’ – 
this will quickly bring Windows grinding 
to a halt. Instead nudge processes up or 
down a single notch to ‘AboveNormal’ 
or ‘BelowNormal’ respectively. Setting 
certain background processes to 
BelowNormal can hand resources to 
other programs without unduly 
affecting their own performance.
Manage processes
The major problem with Task Manager is 
that your custom priority setting lasts 
only as long as the process is running. 
The next time it’s launched, priorities 
are reset to Normal. If you’d like to 
permanently raise or lower a process, 
you’ll need a program called Prio (www.
prnwatch.com/prio/). Download the 
32-bit or 64-bit version as required, and 
once it’s running, you’ll find a new Save 
Priority option has been added to the 
Set Priority sub-menu. Make sure it’s 
ticked and any changes you make to a 
process’s priority will be stored and 
reapplied the next time it’s run.
If you’re running a low-powered PC 
that often appears to hang for periods 
of time, then take a look at Process 
Lasso (https://bitsum.com) – the free 
version can ‘balance’ the demands made 
by processes, automatically lowering the 
priority of any which threaten to 
overwhelm your PC’s limited resources. 
Once installed, you can leave the 
program to its devices. n
Banish sluggish programs
 
Most of your computing life is 
spent using applications 
rather than Windows itself. If 
your PC is struggling under 
the weight of all the programs 
you use on it, consider trying 
to source more lightweight 
alternatives. First, see if you 
can source a portable version 
of your favourite program 
using www.portableapps.com 
as a starting point as well as 
the app’s own website. 
Portable versions are self-
contained, so only consume 
resources when they run and 
don’t clog up the Registry or 
other system folders. An 
added benefit is they can be 
stored on another drive to 
Windows, ensuring that they 
– and your precious settings 
– survive your next reinstall or 
major system crash.
Second, see if a faster, less 
bloated alternative is available 
for those programs you can 
easily swap out – programs 
worth swapping include your 
office application, PDF reader, 
image editor and even your 
security software. Visit https://
alternativeto.net to see what 
alternatives are out there for a 
specific program – look for 
the ‘lightweight’ filter to 
narrow down your search to 
less demanding alternatives.
Prio enables you to permanently  
set a process’s priority.
The AlternativeTo website can help you track down resource-light  
alternatives to programs that are holding your PC back.

R
A full, destructive reinstall
If you’re looking to wipe the slate clean, or need to recover from major 
issues, the nuclear option is always the best one
einstalling Windows 
from scratch – namely, 
wiping your system drive 
completely clean to 
install a brand, spanking 
new (and fresh) version 
of Windows on to it – is the ultimate 
choice for anyone looking to revive a 
slow-running PC or resolve a major, 
non-hardware issue, such as those 
caused by malware or a clogged up 
computer, In this final section we’ll step 
you through the entire process.
Ideally you should have a recent and 
full backup of your PC, created using 
either File History or the Windows 
Backup and Restore tool before you 
begin, that way you’ll lose the minimum 
of content. A full reinstall really is 
destructive – nothing left on your C 
drive will exist once you’ve finished. You 
should ensure you have the latest 
installation media for your target 
version of Windows - see the ‘Reinstall 
Windows’ feature from issue 143 for 
details on how to do this. This will 
ensure a cleaner, more up-to-date 
installation from the off, thus saving you 
time bringing it fully up to date once the 
installation has completed. 
It’s also worth sourcing networking 
and graphics drivers now rather than 
relying on Windows to provide them for 
you – in most cases, they should be built 
in, but not always. Consult your PC or 
motherboard manufacturer’s website for 
these, or visit your Wi-Fi adaptor or 
graphics card manufacturer’s site – 
download them to your backup drive.
Other things to consider: uninstall any 
products that require activation now – 
this should deactivate the licences and 
enable you to use them with your new 
install without any issues. Also, be sure 
to have product keys and program 
installers to hand.
STArTiNG ThE  
rEiNSTAll ProCESS
A full destructive reinstall should always 
be started by booting from your 
installation media, be it a DVD or USB 
flash drive. The actual reinstall process 
doesn’t differ much across Windows 7, 
8.1 or 10. You’ll be asked to verify your 
language, location and keyboard are set 
Restore programs, settings and data
Once Windows is reinstalled, 
open Windows Update to 
bring Windows fully up to date 
– don’t be surprised if there are 
hundreds of updates still to 
apply in the case of Windows 7 
and 8.1. Once it’s fully up to 
date, consider reinstalling 
Macrium Reflect Free (www.
macrium.com/reflectfree) and 
taking your first drive image 
– a vanilla backup you can 
restore in future instead of 
reinstalling Windows itself.
If you followed the advice in 
our ‘Reinstall Windows’ feature 
from issue 143, you should now 
be able to reinstall your core 
apps using CloneApp (www.
mirinsoft.com) from your data 
drive. If you click the Restore 
button, every single program 
setting you backed up will be 
restored – if there are any 
backup settings you don’t want 
to restore, select Options to 
locate the backup folder, then 
open it and move any program 
folders you want to ignore out 
of the folder temporarily 
before clicking the Restore 
button. Now take your second 
Macrium Reflect Free backup.
Finally, open File History or 
the Windows Backup and 
Restore tool and take steps to 
restore any data you backed 
up, then make sure the tool is 
configured to carry on backing 
up going forward.
Windows 10 users can launch a repair install directly from the Media Creation Tool.
Windows 7 and 8.1 
users will find a 
large number of 
updates waiting 
to be installed 
after reinstalling.

reboot for media
If you’re running Windows 7, or 
have Fast Boot disabled, insert your boot 
media and start your PC. Look for a ‘Press 
any key to boot from CD or DVD’ option  
– even if you have booted from a USB 
flash drive. Press any key on your 
keyboard and you should find that the 
Windows install process starts.
2
Tweak boot options
If you boot back into Windows, 
restart your PC again, but this time press a 
key, such as [F11], when prompted to 
open a boot menu. Once you have done 
so, select your boot media – choosing 
UEFI if that option appears – to boot; 
otherwise, enter setup so that you can 
change the boot device order.
3
Windows 8.1/10
If Fast Boot is enabled on your 
computer, open Settings in Windows and 
then navigate to ‘Update & recovery’ > 
Recovery, then click ‘Restart now’ under 
‘Advanced start-up’. When the boot 
options appear, choose ‘Use a device’ to 
select the USB flash drive or DVD you  
created from the list that appears.
correctly, then it’s a case of clicking 
Install Now. If prompted, enter your 
product key or click Skip if you’re 
running Windows 10 on a PC you 
upgraded during the free period. When 
asked what type of installation you wish 
to perform, choose the Custom option.
Next comes potentially the trickiest 
part of the process. A list of drives and 
partitions will appear – you need to 
select the one Windows is currently 
installed on. By default, it should be 
detected and selected, but verify it’s 
correct before clicking Format (click the 
advanced Drive Options button if it’s 
not visible). Click ‘OK’, then once 
formatted, verify the drive is still 
selected and click Next.
That’s the technical stuff pretty much 
done. You’ll see a checklist of tasks to be 
performed – just sit back and wait. One 
thing to note: when Windows reboots, 
you may see the ‘press any key’ prompt 
again to boot from CD or DVD. Don’t 
press anything if that happens, just let 
the installer continue.
SET uP PoST-iNSTAll
The post-setup prompt begins with 
Windows 7 users being prompted for 
their product key, then it’s a case of 
setting up a user account and you’re off 
and running. Windows 8.1 users will get 
an Express Settings prompt – be sure to 
click the option to customise these and 
go through them carefully.
Post-Creators Update, Windows 10 no 
longer gives you an Express Settings 
option. For now, confirm your location 
and keyboard, set up your network if 
required and choose ‘personal use’ 
when prompted. You can either sign in 
with your Microsoft account or click 
‘Offline account’ > ‘Maybe later’ if you 
plan to stick with the old-style Windows 
7 local user account. 
If you opt for the Microsoft account 
option now is a good time to set up a 
PIN to speed up future logins (note: the 
PIN is tied, specifically, to this PC, and 
you can always bypass it using your 
regular account password should you 
forget it at any point).
You’ll then be asked to set up Cortana 
– this is where Windows 10’s notorious 
privacy settings come into play, so 
review all of the options carefully, 
flicking the slider to Off for any you 
don’t need or use.
That’s the end of the setup process 
– Windows will now configure itself 
based on each of your choices and you’ll 
see a series of messages appear 
on-screen. Eventually, when all is ready, 
you’ll find yourself back at the familiar 
Windows desktop screen. n
Start the install process
“Next comes potentially the trickiest part of the process.  
A list of drives and partitions will appear – you need to 
select the one Windows is currently installed on”
Make sure you’ve got network and graphics drivers sourced.

Be safe online 
with a VPN
“Encrypt your Internet connection 
and conceal your real location 
with the OpenVPN client”
irtual Private Networks 
(VPNs) are a great way to 
protect your privacy online. 
Although they were originally 
designed to enable corporate 
employees to dial into their offices, 
VPNs are also a great way to guard 
against snoopers and hackers, 
especially in countries like the UK 
where ISPs are obliged to record 
details of every website you visit.
The OpenVPN protocol is one of 
the best for this as it encrypts the 
connection between your machine 
and a VPN provider using ultra-secure 
OpenSSL. If configured properly, 
anyone snooping on your Internet 
data will only see that you’ve 
connected to the VPN provider, not 
which sites you visit. You can also 
make it appear as though you’re in a 
different country by using a VPN 
server based there. 
This guide will show you how to 
get OpenVPN up and running.
1 Choose your VPN provider
Use your search engine to find a VPN provider. Most offer 
discounts for longer subscriptions. Make sure they specifically 
offer OpenVPN over other protocols. If you want to appear to be 
in a particular country, make sure they also have servers in that 
location. Here, we’ve chosen VPNBook (www.vpnbook.com/), 
which is free. You can do this too, but its service isn’t very fast.
2 Choose your payment method
Most VPN providers accept payment by credit card and 
PayPal. This makes it easy to connect a particular account to your 
name. If you feel paranoid consider using a VPN provider which 
accepts anonymous payment methods, such as Bitcoin. You can 
buy Bitcoins easily using online exchanges, such as BitStamp. See 
http://bit.ly/2AfDehB for more information.

3 Download the OpenVPN configuration file
Once you’ve registered with a VPN provider you’ll be invited 
to download the OpenVPN configuration file. This is a small file 
with the extension .ovpn, which contains the settings you’ll need 
to connect to the service. If your provider requires a username 
and password, note this down. VPNBook lets you download the 
files you need and view the password without having to register. 
4 Download OpenVPN Client
Point your web browser at https://openvpn.net/index.php/
open-source/downloads.html to download the OpenVPN client. 
Scroll down and choose ‘Installer, Windows Vista and later’. Run 
the program and click Yes to allow changes to be made to your 
PC, if necessary. Minimise your web browser for now and the 
OpenVPN installer setup will appear. Click ‘Next’ to continue.

9 Check for DNS leaks
Depending on your VPN provider, you may find your DNS 
(Domain Name Server) requests are still being leaked. This means 
it may be possible for your ISP to track which websites you visit 
even if you’re using a VPN. To check this visit www.dnsleaktest.
com/ while connected via OpenVPN and click Extended Test. If 
your true location appears, your browsing history may be visible.
7 Launch the OpenVPN client
Double-click the OpenVPN shortcut on your desktop. The 
client icon will appear in the Taskbar. The first time you run the 
client, you’ll be asked for the username and password for your 
chosen OpenVPN service. Make sure Save Password is ticked  
and click OK. Windows 10 displays a notification once you’re 
connected. The OpenVPN icon in the Taskbar also turns green.
5 Install the OpenVPN Client
Read through the OpenVPN Client License Agreement and 
click ‘I Agree’ once you’ve understood the terms and conditions. 
On the Choose Components screen, leave the default options 
ticked. Click ‘Next’, then confirm the install location. You’ll see a 
confirmation regarding the TAP-Windows provider. Click ‘Install’ to 
continue. Once setup is complete click Next, then Finish.
10 Fix DNS leaks
If you discover that your DNS requests are being leaked, 
then right-click the OpenVPN icon at the bottom of your screen 
and disconnect. Navigate to your configuration file and double-
click to open it in Notepad. Add the line ‘block-outside-dns’ to the 
attributes listed there above ‘<ca>’. Save and exit. From now on 
you’ll be using your VPN provider’s DNS servers. ■
8  
Check your IP address 
You can double-check your connection by viewing your 
public IP address as far as the web is concerned. Open your web 
browser and navigate to www.whatismyip.com. This will not only 
display your IP address, but your apparent location. If you 
expected to appear in a different country, you may have 
downloaded the wrong .ovpn configuration file.
6 Add Configuration file(s)
You’ll now see a shortcut to the OpenVPN client on your 
desktop. Leave this for now and open File Explorer. Navigate to 
the new ‘config’ folder OpenVPN has created in your account (C:\
Users\<username>\OpenVPN\Config). Next, copy and paste the 
configuration (.ovpn) file or files you downloaded earlier from 
your provider. Close File Explorer when you’re done.

The latest version of Adobe’s image editing program has everything 
an aspiring photo pro needs – and you can find out why right here
very year, or so it seems, graphics 
software giant Adobe releases 
another version of its Elements 
suite – consumer versions of its 
professional image and video editing 
applications Photoshop and Premiere.
They’re quite good. Good enough that 
you might never use all of their 
capabilities, and will keep discovering new 
tricks and features for a long time. The 
only problem with them is the price – £99 
each, or £150 for a bundle, is a lot to pay if 
you’re not sure whether or not you’ll get a 
lot of use out of a program. Happily, there’s 
a 30-day free trial available to help you 
make up your mind.
The latest editions are the first to have a 
year – 2018 – in their name rather than a 
version number, and there are a number of 
interesting new features to explore that 
can help overcome common photography 
problems and open up exciting image 
editing possibilities. And that’s exactly 
what we’re going to look at in this tutorial.
Learn how to…
Master Photoshop Elements
E
Step-by-step Explore Elements’ new features
1 Get organised
Photoshop Elements is an app of two halves. There’s the 
Editor, where the actual photo editing takes place, and there’s the 
Organizer, which takes the pain out of dealing with large photo 
libraries. It’s been able to use face recognition and GPS tags to 
sort your images for a while, but new this year is auto-curation, 
which aims to choose the best photos from a large batch.
2 Use Auto Curate
Enabled with a simple tick box at the top right, Auto Curate 
selects your best photos based on whether they contain faces, 
what they’re of, whether they’ve been tagged, and their ‘quality’. 
Yes, Elements is now judging your photography skills. You can 
limit how many photos it chooses – from ten to 20,000 – 
otherwise there are no further Auto Curate options.
3 Choose your selections
Making selections is key to successful photo edits – they 
enable you to make changes to a part of the image while leaving 
the rest untouched, but are difficult and time consuming to create 
accurately, even with the help of tools such as Magic Wand and 
Quick Selection. This is especially true if the background of the 
photo is the same colour as the subject, or particularly detailed.
4 Introducing Auto Selection
New in Elements 2018 is Auto Selection, which enables you 
to drag a rectangle around the image element you want to select, 
before some AI magic places the familiar ‘marching ants’ selection 
outline around it. We tried it with a confusing background and it 
worked almost perfectly. You can clean up the selection using 
Refine Edge from the Select menu if doesn’t get it right first time.

5  
Replace the background
Once the subject has been selected, one of the things you 
can do is replace the background with something more, or less, 
interesting to make a stronger composition or maybe a fantasy 
piece. You can do it in Expert mode with a bit of know-how, but 
there’s a new Guided Edit in Elements 2018 that teaches you 
exactly how it’s done, so you’ll know for next time.
6 Guided Edits explained
There are several new Guided Edits in Elements 2018. 
They’re interesting because, rather than doing the work for you, 
they teach you how the app works. Choosing the right image is 
crucial, but get it right and Guided Edits are some of the most fun 
you can have with the app. You can create a double exposure or a 
watercolour effect, along with many other special effects.
7 Open closed eyes
It’s not uncommon when taking a group photo for someone 
in that group to blink at the exact moment you release the 
shutter. Adobe has your back in Elements 2018 with Open Closed 
Eyes, a command on the Enhance menu, which opens in its own 
window. It does exactly what you’d expect and pretty seamlessly 
too, but only if you feed it a source picture of open eyes first.
8  
Eyes to the right
Select the menu option and the Open Closed Eyes window 
appears. The app detects the closed eyes and gives you options  
to replace them. You can open an image from a folder or the 
Organizer, or use a sample set of eyes. The samples give mixed 
results. A photo of the same person will seem reasonably natural, 
but a photo of someone else can lead to odd-looking portraits.
Editing toolS
These tools differ 
depending on which 
mode you’re in. If 
you want to select, 
draw or move, then 
head here. 
oPtionS
Show all currently 
open images, find 
options for your 
currently selected 
tool and open the 
Organizer from here.

9 Dynamic slideshows
Slideshows have been part of Photoshop Elements for some 
time, but 2018 ups the ante by labelling them as ‘dynamic’. The 
creation process starts with a single-click from the Organizer – 
look in the Create menu – along with other things such as 
Facebook cover photos, greetings cards and photo books. Use 
Auto Curate first so only your best photos are on show.
10 Slide away
After a small amount of processing time, your dynamic 
slideshow will appear. On the left you’ll find options for adding 
music (including your own) and changing the theme of your 
slideshow, along with fine-tuning the images involved. On the 
right are tools to save your work to continue with later, or export 
to Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo or as a video file on your PC. ■

Keep children safe 
when they’re online
“If you have little eyes around, it’s important to control 
what they see online. Safeguard their Internet use with 
K9 Web Protection – you won’t regret it”
iving an Internet-connected 
PC to a youngster is, unless 
you’re the forgiving type, 
absolutely asking for trouble. Where 
are they heading online? What are 
they up to? What site did they visit 
when they typed that innocent 
phrase into the address bar? Finding 
out what they’ve witnessed after the 
fact is shutting the door after the 
horse has bolted – you need to set 
proper boundaries from the start. 
While a trusting relationship is one 
way to go about it, rock-solid web 
browser protection is the other. If 
you’re logged in with a Microsoft 
account, Windows 10 includes its 
own tools for adding family members 
and placing restrictions on them, but 
K9 Web Protection’s more granular 
controls are great. What’s more, it’s 
perfect if you’ve passed on an old 
machine, since Microsoft’s family 
safety tools for Windows 7 have now 
stopped working.
1 Sign up
Log in to your child’s user account, open a web browser and 
go to www1.k9webprotection.com. Click the Free Download link, 
and input the information it asks for – this is a way to set up your 
administration account, so make sure you’re not using a shared 
email address that your kids might be able to access. When you’re 
done, click ‘Request license’, and head to your email inbox.
2 Download it
You should have a new email from K9. Inside is a link to 
download the software and below it is your personal free license 
code. Run the installer and, when asked, input your license code 
in the appropriate box, before setting an administrator password 
– pick something your kids aren’t likely to know or be able to 
guess, lest they break through K9’s security and take full control.

7 Search yourself
While Google or Bing’s search results generally won’t 
include anything explicit, K9, by default, redirects your online 
enquiries to its own protected search engine. If you don’t want 
this – bear in mind that it’ll block the sites themselves if a dodgy 
term is dredged up – head to the Safe Search section and switch 
off ‘Redirect to K9 Safe Search’ while leaving ‘Force Safe Search’ on.
8 After dark
If you’re leaving a laptop with your progeny, you may wish 
to make sure they get some proper sleep rather than spending all 
night on the Internet. The Time Restrictions settings enables you 
to put a blanket block on evening web access using what K9 calls 
NightGuard, or set custom access hours to make sure homework 
gets done before the important business of online fun begins. ■
5 Customise it
Too broad for you? Selecting the Custom option, right at the 
bottom, enables you to block only the categories you deem to be 
a problem. You can click each category to see a description of the 
kind of content that will be blocked, then check it if you want to 
cut it off. Just remember, when you’re done, to click the Save 
button at the very bottom of the page to lock in your selections.
3 First run
Click ‘Install’ and restart your PC when prompted to allow K9 
to get its hooks in. Once you’re logged back in, K9 will be running 
secretly in the background. There’ll be a new link in your Start 
menu to its admin page, although this doesn’t always work. If it 
doesn’t, open a web browser and head to 127.0.0.1:2372, which is 
a local address that directs you to the same spot the link does.
6 All except...
Even if you’ve put a broad ban on certain categories of site, 
you may find a particular problem site still works its way through 
or a favourite, completely innocent site gets blocked. Clicking 
‘Web site exceptions’ on the left enables you to explicitly block or 
allow certain addresses. You can also check the ‘Blacklist without 
password’ box to allow your kids to block sites they don’t like.
4 Set it up
Click the Setup button, and input the admin password you 
set during installation. You’ll be taken to K9’s core protection 
feature: web blocking by category. Here you can determine the 
kind level of blocking you want to apply to your web connection, 
from a minimal barrier against pornographic sites all the way to 
high security, which blocks everything including social networks.

Get better battery life 
from your laptop
“A few things have changed with the release of 
Windows 10’s Fall Creators Update – including the 
best way to keep your battery running for longer”
hen you’re on the move, 
your laptop’s battery will 
inevitably give up the ghost 
just when you really need it. We can’t 
change that fundamental law of 
computing, but we can at least make 
sure that critical moment happens a 
little later. Windows 10’s battery 
management features have changed 
a little, and the Fall Creators Update 
does one of two things, according to 
our office straw poll: it either does 
great things for your laptop’s battery, 
or it cuts its life in half. 
Whatever your experience, there 
are likely savings to be made. Before 
you wade in and start making 
changes, though, make sure you’re 
running the Fall Creators Update by 
heading to the Settings > Updates 
screen. If you haven’t upgraded to 
the latest version of Windows 10 yet, 
a number of these settings might be 
in slightly different places, but you 
should still be able to follow along.
1 Classic mode
Windows’ old battery options are still around, so make sure 
they’re set correctly. Right-click the battery icon next to the clock 
on your Taskbar, and select Power Options. On this screen, you’ll 
be able to select from a number of different plans, at least if 
they’re displayed; if you can only see one – as is the case here – 
expand your options by clicking ‘Create a power plan’ on the left.
2 Pick the type
You’ll be able to intricately alter the minutiae of your power 
plan a little later, but for now pick the broad category of ‘Power 
saver’ and give it a clever name. Click ‘Next’, and set time limits for 
the computer and its screen to switch off as well as the default 
screen brightness. This can make a big difference, and we’d opt to 
turn this as low as you can go while still seeing your screen clearly.

7 Slide it
There will be times when your mobile priorities change and 
you need a temporary performance boost. The Fall Creators 
Update includes a super-handy feature – just left-click the battery 
icon (while you’re running on battery, and not in power saving 
mode) to see a slider. Drag it to the left and you’ll save battery, or 
move it to the right to gain a little more performance.
8 More options
If you want to toggle more battery-sucking features on or 
off quickly – your laptop’s keyboard backlight, for example – then 
a trip to the Mobility Centre is a must. Right-click the battery icon 
on your Taskbar, then select the appropriate option. This is also a 
quick way to switch between power plans, so if you’ve configured 
a few for different uses you can jump from one to another here. ■
5 Saving mode
Windows will help you out when it sees your battery getting 
low as long as you have it set to activate Battery Saver mode. This, 
among other things, reduces background activity and stops 
checking for notifications. Activate it by heading to Settings > 
System > Battery and checking the appropriate box – you can also 
set the level at which it will activate for a little more convenience.
3 Select your profile
Once you’ve finished creating your base profile – you can 
generally leave all the ‘plugged in’ values pretty high – click 
Create. Your new profile should kick in straight away, but there are 
a few more things you can change about it: click ‘Change plan 
settings’ then ‘Change advanced power settings’ to find the 
appropriate settings window, which lets you get much deeper.
6 What’s draining?
At the top of the Settings screen’s Battery page is a link that 
takes you to a breakdown of which apps are hammering your 
battery the hardest. If something essential is at the top it might 
not be an awful lot of help, but shutting, disabling or even entirely 
removing power-sapping apps, particularly when you’re away 
from a power source, is a great way to cut down on wasteful drain.
4 Advanced settings
Most of the settings in here are a little intimidating, but 
there’s only a couple that are essential to check. If your laptop has 
a spinning hard drive rather than an SSD, use the Hard Disk option 
to set it to switch off after five minutes. Then head down to the 
Battery section, and change the critical battery level to three 
percent in order to squeeze out an extra few minutes of power.

Mozilla’s web browser has taken a ‘Quantum’ leap forward, making it 
leaner, meaner and faster than before. Here’s how to use it on your PC
irefox 57 (AKA Firefox Quantum) 
is a radical overhaul of Mozilla’s 
web browser – and not before 
time. Despite regular updates, it was 
starting to feel its age, seeming sluggish in 
the face of much faster competition.
All that changes now. Mozilla’s team has 
heavily rewritten over three quarters of the 
browser’s source code, while new tools 
such as Quantum CSS – which speeds up 
website formatting – makes it run twice as 
fast as before, and makes it a shade faster 
than recent versions of Google Chrome. 
Firefox’s new interface, named ‘Photon’,  
also has much snappier tabs as well as a 
small action menu in the address bar.
In this guide, you’ll learn how to 
download and install Firefox 57, and take a 
tour of these and other dazzling features, 
including Firefox Sync, which keeps your 
data consistent across devices, private 
browsing and an easy-to-use screenshot 
tool. You’ll also learn how to use web 
extensions to add even more new features.
Learn how to…
Get started with Firefox 57
F
Step-by-step Set up Firefox 57 (Quantum)
1 Download Firefox
Open your current web browser and navigate to https://
mozilla.com. Click the green Download Now button. If you’re 
using Microsoft Edge, click Run to launch the installer. Otherwise 
go to your Downloads folder. Choose ‘Yes’ to allow the installer to 
make changes. Firefox installer will now launch. The program will 
copy files automatically, then launch Firefox itself. 
2 Use Firefox Sync 
If you aren’t an existing Firefox Sync user click ‘Create an 
account’. Fill in the email and password fields. You also need to 
enter your age in the field marked ‘how old are you’. Finally click 
Create Account. Next, choose which data to sync – bookmarks, 
preferences, add-ons and so on. Click ‘Save settings’. Check your 
email and click the verification link to complete sign up. 
3 Import existing browser data
If you’ve already been using another web browser, such as 
Microsoft Edge, you can import any existing browsing data – search 
history, bookmarks, web passwords and so on – that you have 
there. Once the ‘Import Settings and Data’ window opens, choose 
your current browser, then click Next. On ‘Items to import’ check 
any you wish to copy across, such as saved passwords, and click 
Next, then Finish. Your data will now be copied across.
4 Start the tour
Firefox 57 will now show the browsing window. If you’ve 
never used Firefox before click ‘New to Firefox? Let’s get started’. 
This launches an interactive tour of Firefox’s main features. Click the 
options on the left to explore each of these. Begin by clicking 
Performance. This will give you a quick rundown of Firefox’s newest 
features, such as smoother scrolling and faster tabs.

5 Surf in private
Click the option entitled Private Browsing on the left. Click 
‘Show Private Browsing in Menu’ at the bottom right to try this 
feature. Firefox will automatically highlight the New Private 
Window menu option. Click this to launch a private window, 
which doesn’t record your search history. Note: this doesn’t make 
you fully anonymous. See https://mzl.la/1CzyHMx for details. 
6 Take a screenshot
Click ‘Screenshots’ on the left, then Open Screenshots 
Website to access the site itself. The options menu in the address 
bar will open. Click ‘Take a Screenshot’ to launch a small preview of 
the tool. Choose either ‘Save a full page’ or ‘Save visible (area)’. 
Firefox will show an image preview. Click the ‘X’ to cancel, the 
arrow to download, or Save to add to the Screenshots website.
7 Add-ons
Return to the Tour tab and choose ‘Add-ons’. Click ‘Show 
Add-ons in menu’, then click the highlighted ‘Add-ons’ option. 
Hover your mouse over themes to preview how they look and 
click the rocker switch to install them. Extensions are installed the 
same way. We recommend installing uBlock Origin since it blocks 
the most annoying ads. Click ‘Add’ (top left) to confirm installation. 
8  
Customise the toolbar
From the tour tab, click Customize on the left, then the 
‘Show Customize in menu’ button. From here you can drag your 
favourite items either into the toolbar where they can be accessed 
right away, or to the overflow menu on the right so you can keep 
them within reach. Click ‘Done’ when complete. Alternatively, use 
the Themes menu to change to a preconfigured layout.
InterFace
The new ‘Photon’ 
design includes 
much more sharply 
defined tabs. 
Switching tabs and 
scrolling’s also faster.
BookmarkS
Keep favourite sites 
at your fingertips  
by enabling the 
Bookmarks Toolbar 
and adding your 
chosen sites. 
Nate’s best tip!
If you prefer a more classic 
Firefox interface, right-click 
anywhere in the top pane 
and choose Menu bar.

Turn your photos into 
a video slideshow
“Create and share a slideshow quickly and easily 
with Windows 10’s updated Photos app”
tory Remix appeared in 
Windows 10 version 1709, 
also known as the Fall 
Creators update, so if Windows 
Update still hasn’t delivered it to you, 
it’s worth a trip to the Settings app to 
see if it’s ready. Oddly, one of our 
systems didn’t report it as available 
until we manually pushed the ‘Check 
for updates’ button.
You’ll know when you’ve got it, as 
it makes a change to Windows 10’s 
Photos app. If you open Photos by 
double-clicking an image or right-
clicking and choosing the app from 
the Open With... menu, you’ll get the 
usual Photos interface with editing 
and sharing options. But if you start 
the app without an initial file, perhaps 
using a shortcut or from the Start 
menu, you’ll get the Remix option 
under the Create menu.
With it, you’ll be able to turn your 
photos into a video – and in this 
tutorial we’ll show you how.
1 Find the remixer
Getting started is easy. Open the Photos app from a 
shortcut or the Start menu, and you’ll be in the right place. From 
the Create menu, choose Video Remix and you’ll be taken to a 
screen which asks you to choose two or more photos or video 
files to use in your project. Once you’ve chosen them, you’re 
whisked to the next screen, where you preview your video.
2 Remix
These videos are little more than slideshows, joining 
together pictures and video clips with some nice transitions and 
some background music. A big blue Remix button now appears 
on the screen, tapping this automatically change the theme of 
those transitions, the choice of photos, and the music. You don’t 
get any input into the process, however, it’s purely automated.

7 Add themes and music
You can also add a theme to your slideshow. The Theme 
button is at the top, and there’s a decent selection available. 
Themes change the text styles and all the filters used in your 
creation to give it a consistent visual style. You can also add tracks 
from your own music collection or choose from those built into 
the app using the Music button.
8 Export your slideshow
The options for exporting your slideshow are slim, but 
there’s enough there for most people. Click the ‘Export or share’ 
button (top right) and you’ll be presented with three file size 
options. Choose the one you want, and the file will be generated 
before popping up options to view it or share it on social media. 
You can open it in other applications too, if you want to. ■
5 Add some images
Your image bin is at the top left, while the timeline of the 
actual slideshow is along the bottom. Drag images from the bin 
into the timeline in the order in which you want them to appear. 
You can choose the length of time they appear by selecting an 
image, then clicking the Duration button. If you want an image to 
appear more than once, just drag another copy in from the bin.
3 Get hands-on
If you’re happy with the video, you can export it and stop 
there. But if you’d rather get stuck in and create something 
bespoke, you can do that by clicking the blue Edit Video button 
below the Remix one. From the edit window, you’re given lots of 
control over how the finished product will look, and can fiddle 
with most aspects of it until you’re completely happy.
6 Use filters, text and motion
To add more interest to your slideshow, you can overlay text 
onto it, run Instagram-style filters that change the look, and alter 
the way the camera pans across the images. To do this, use the 
buttons above the slideshow timeline. The text can be animated, 
and comes in various fonts, while Motion provides a generous 
selection of zooms, pans and tilts.
4 Add more pictures
You chose which pictures and videos would be added to 
the slideshow at the beginning, but you can now add more from 
this window without having to start again. At the top left there’s a 
big ‘+’ with ‘Add photos and videos’ next to it. Click this, and you 
can scroll through your image library to pick out new material to 
add to your video. Click ‘Add’ when you’re finished.

Nate’s Best Tip!
to block all connections, go to 
the Windows security Centre, 
choose public or private then 
click ‘Block all incoming’. 
Learn how to…
Master Windows’ 
built-in firewall
he firewall in Windows 10 is 
very powerful and designed 
to work in the background. 
When you install new programs – 
from the Microsoft Store for example 
– the firewall will intelligently allow 
them to connect to the Internet and/
or other computers if they exist on a 
pre-approved whitelist. If a program 
isn’t listed Windows will ask if you 
want to permit it. 
In this guide, you’ll discover how to 
check that your firewall is active and 
amend your notification settings. 
You’ll also find out how to view which 
programs are allowed through your 
firewall as well as manually add those 
which aren’t listed.
If you want even finer control of 
your machine, you can also take 
advantage of Windows’ advanced 
settings to restrict a program to using 
specific ports or users. You can even 
block ports commonly used by 
certain apps altogether.
1 Open Firewall & network protection
Go to Start > Settings, then from the Windows Settings 
menu choose Network & Internet. Scroll down and click Windows 
Firewall. Windows Defender Security Centre will now launch. If the 
firewall is not activated under Private Network or Public Network, 
click these and then on the rocker switch under Windows 
Defender Firewall to activate it.
2 Manage default settings 
Windows Defender Firewall’s default settings will adjust to 
accommodate new programs you add. Incoming connections are 
blocked unless they are on a special list of pre-approved apps or 
you add a program yourself. If Windows Defender Firewall blocks 
an app it will tell you. You can select ‘Restore firewalls to default’ 
to restore this configuration at any time.

7 Limit connections to users
Administrators can configure programs only to connect if 
they are run by specific users. Open ‘Properties’ and click the Local 
Principals tab. Tick ‘Only allow connections from these users’ then 
click Add. Under ‘Select Principal type’ leave Local User selected 
and click OK. In the box marked ‘Enter the object names to select’ 
enter the username you want to permit access, then click OK. 
8 Block traffic on specific ports
If you want to block certain network traffic such as torrents, 
click on New Rule under Actions. In the New Inbound Rule Wizard 
choose Port, then Next. Choose TCP or UDP then click ‘Specific 
local ports’ to enter a port or range of ports to block. Click ‘Next’ 
then ‘Block the connection’. Click ‘Next’ twice more and enter a 
name and description for your new rule. Click ‘Finish’. ■
5 View inbound connections
You may prefer to fine-tune some of the firewall rules. For 
instance, filesharing app Vuze allows incoming connections on all 
ports by default. To view detailed information on each program 
return to the Windows Defender Security Centre window and click 
Advanced Settings. The Advanced Security window will open. 
Click ‘Inbound rules’ on the left and find your chosen program. 
3 View allowed apps
To see which applications and services are currently allowed 
through the firewall click ‘Allow an app through the firewall’. Click 
‘Change settings’ at the top right, then scroll through the box 
marked ‘Allowed apps and features’. Once again, you’ll see that 
there are options for both Private and Public networks. Click the 
checkbox next to these to allow/disallow access for one or both. 
6 Configure program ports
If while browsing through programs you feel a particular 
connection is too vulnerable, you can restrict the ports it uses. 
Highlight the program in the ‘Inbound rules’ list and then choose 
Properties on the right. In the new window, choose the ‘Protocols 
and Ports’ tab. Under the Local Port drop-down menu choose 
Specific Ports, then enter your port of choice. Click ‘Apply’.
4 Add an unlisted app
If you want to allow an app, which doesn’t seem to be listed 
under ‘Allowed apps and features’, click the button marked ‘Allow 
another app’. In the new window, first click ‘Network types’ to 
choose which networks to allow (Public and/or Private). Click ‘OK’ 
to confirm. Next click the Browse button and find the path to the 
program, for instance in C:\Program Files. Finally click Add.

Data Crow makes it easy to catalogue your books, media, software or, 
in fact, anything you like – and best of all, it’s completely free!
ave you ever wanted to keep a 
catalogue of the important items 
you own? Perhaps your CD, DVD 
or Blu-ray collection needs organising 
before you start lending it out to friends or 
family, or you want to keep tabs on your 
books. Maybe you’d like to make a 
definitive list of your music to avoid going 
out and accidentally buying another copy 
of an album you already own? Or perhaps 
you’d like to record your collection of 
software packages.
Whatever your cataloguing needs are, 
Data Crow is the tool for you. This 
underrated freebie makes it easy to start 
building and managing collections of all 
sizes, and thanks to some nifty time-saving 
tools, you don’t need to meticulously 
record everything yourself; instead, simply 
use one of Data Crow’s built-in search tools 
to populate the information that need 
from the Internet.
This tutorial is going to show you how to 
do exactly that – read on to find out more.

Step-by-step Catalogue your stuff
1 Install Java
Data Crow requires Java. If it’s not installed, download  
it from java.com – click the Free Java Download link. Ignore  
any warnings about Edge; instead, click ‘Agree and Start Free 
Download’. Launch the installer stub and click Install. When Java 
Setup appears, select ‘Do not update browser settings’ to avoid 
unwanted changes to your browser, then click Next to install.
2 Tighten security
Once installed, type ‘java’ into the Search box, then click 
Configure Java. Switch to the Security tab – if you only plan to use 
Java with Data Crow untick ‘Enable Java content in the browser’; 
otherwise choose Very High for the security level and click OK. 
Now go to www.datacrow.net, select Downloads from the 
left-hand pane and click Data Crow Windows Installer.
3 Install Data Crow
Click the Windows Installer link to save Data Crow to your 
Downloads folder. Locate the ZIP file, right-click it and choose 
Extract All. Once complete, double-click setup32bit.exe even if 
you have Windows 64-bit installed (this is because Java 32-bit is 
installed by default). Then it’s a case of following the prompts 
– the default choices are fine for most. Click ‘Done’ to finish.
4 Create catalogue
Open Data Crow from the Start menu or via the Search  
box. Choose where to store the program’s data. Click ‘OK’, select 
your language, then click OK again. When the program opens, 
click Close to open the Tool Select Wizard. Choose the type of 
information that you would like to catalogue – pick Container  
if it’s not listed – and click Next.

Add first item
You’ll see a description of the key controls you can use to 
add, manage and delete items in your chosen catalogue – click 
Item Wizard to get started by adding an item from an online 
database. First, choose your server – Amazon is a good starting 
point – and select United Kingdom (English). Now enter the name 
of your item, such as a book’s author or title and click Find.
6 Match and add item
A list of matching results will now appear. Switch to the 
Table View tab for an easier way to review them. If there are 
multiple matches – such as different editions of a book – select 
one and click Open to check whether it’s the correct match using 
the tabs – Picture Front often helps in this regard. Once you’ve 
found the right match, click Next.
7 Review and add
The information will be downloaded, enabling you to 
review and make changes or additions. To keep your items 
organised, look for suitable fields on the Summary and 
Information tabs, such as Category or Genre. Click the ‘+’ button 
for additional entries if they don’t cover your collection. Once 
done, click Finish & New to add another.
8  
Edit items
Keep adding items to your collection. If you want to edit an 
item, right-click it and choose ‘Edit…’. If you want to make the 
same edits to multiple items – such as genre or TV series – select 
them all in the middle pane using [Ctrl]-click, then right-click and 
choose ‘Update all’. Make your changes, then click Save or Apply 
to apply them to the selected entry or entries in your database.

Use these to select 
your collection type: 
books, contacts, 
containers, images, 
general media, 
movies, music  
and software.

As your collection grows, you’ll want to organise it to make 
it easier to browse. To do this, click the ‘Group by’ button in the 
left-hand window and choose Select Fields, then pick how you

To create a multi-level hierarchy, select multiple fields as you wish 
them to appear – for example, genre followed by TV series.
10 Your collection, catalogued
You’ve got the basics mastered, so keep building your 
collection – Data Crow saves your changes as they’re made. The 
program is incredibly versatile, so explore the various menus to 
find ways to fine-tune your catalogue and change the way the 
program works. Also click the pie-chart button to generate charts 
to help you analyse your collection as it grows. ■

Use an ad-blocker in 
the Edge web browser
“Microsoft’s browser now supports extensions – 
make sure Adblock Plus is the first one you install”
ack in August 2016, Microsoft 
released the Windows 10 
Anniversary Update, a free 
download that brought new features 
and security benefits to the 
company’s flagship operating system. 
That update brought several hefty 
improvements to Microsoft Edge, 
including better power saving and 
support for modern web standards 
such as HTML5. But perhaps the most 
visible new feature was the 
introduction of Edge Extensions.
Extensions are plug-in tools that 
enable you add features to your 
browser and personalise your web 
experience. Here we’re going to show 
you how to install and configure the 
free Adblock Plus extension, which is 
considered by many users to be an 
essential plug-in. Adblock does what 
it says – it blocks annoying adverts on 
the web pages you visit and makes 
browsing a less cluttered, more 
pleasant experience.
1 Check the update
The first thing to do is check whether Windows 10 is up to 
date, since Adblock Plus needs the Anniversary Update or higher 
to work. Head to Start > Settings > System, then the About panel 
from the sidebar. Look at the Version number on this panel. If it’s 
1607 or higher, your OS is already updated – skip ahead to Step 4. 
If not, update Windows 10 manually by following Step 2.
2 Get the update
Open up Edge browser and type the following link into the 
address bar: http://bit.ly/1Db3y9g. You should see the official 
Microsoft web page shown above – click the ‘Get the Update now’ 
button. This downloads the Update Assistant, which you should 
run when prompted. A window will appear asking you to update 
to the latest version of Windows. Click ‘Update Now’.

7 Filter lists
You can add more filter lists from this tab by pressing ‘Add 
filter subscription’. Choose an optional list from the drop-down

cLassics
ou place a treasured 
CD-ROM into the disc tray, 
wistful about the good old 
days, and excited to see 
the familiar pixels of an 
old favourite game. Your 
PC reacts like a dog watching a magic 
trick. Autorun doesn’t work. Setup.exe 
doesn’t work. InstallShield is looking for 
a long-forgotten Windows 98 library file 
in perpetuity. In a very real and 
upsetting way, your childhood is no 
longer compatible with the modern 
world, and you know that the only way 
to rekindle it involves hours of 
compatibility box-checking, Googling, 
and fiddling. A traumatic moment.
But it doesn’t have to be. Getting 
software that was designed for much 
older operating systems and hardware 
to run on modern machines offers its 
own intrinsic satisfaction. It’s like 
breaking the rules, somehow, raising 
dead software that was never intended 
to interface with silicon this powerful, 
and bending an operating system to 
your will. There are many different 
avenues to pursue when you’re 
attempting to do so, and that in itself 
has its own pros and cons. That variety 
of approaches means it’s unlikely you’ll 
truly reach a dead end, to stretch that 
avenue metaphor to breaking point. But 
it does also mean the plethora of 
conflicting information found on 
message boards suggesting this method 
or that can make this a tricky task to go 
about in a methodical manner. So, let’s 
do exactly that: Let’s turn what would 
ordinarily be an evening of directionless 
trial and error into a scientific process. 
The definitive and exhaustive guide to 
running old games on a new PC.
A willingness to install a few programs 
on your PC and a sound awareness of 
abandonware law are mandatory in this 
test environment. With those humble 
tools, you should be able to run any old 
game on a Windows 10 PC, however 
categorical the error messages seem 
upon the first attempt. Lab coats on…

“Hardware tends to play only an 
indirect role in incompatibility”
efore we get stuck into 
the many-branched 
methodology of old 
game necromancy, let’s 
examine why this 
problem exists. After all, if 
your PC can run The Witcher 3 at 60fps, 
why does it struggle to render 1999’s 
Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear at anything 
above single figures? And why is it so 
hard to get certain games installed?
Essentially, it all comes down to 
operating systems. Whenever a piece of 
software or PC game is developed, its 
creators make a series of assumptions 
about the environment it’ll be used in. 
The developers of 1999, for example, 
might reasonably have expected that 
most users would be installing their 
game on to a Windows 98 or Windows 
95 PC, both based around the 16-bit Disk 
Operating System (DOS). That, in turn, 
means an assumption about the file 
libraries and drivers contained within 
those operating systems, and the kind of 
hardware that might be running it. 
Those developers couldn’t anticipate 
that later versions of Windows, from 
Windows 2000 onward, would only 
emulate DOS, rather than running it 
natively, and that the code that installs 
and runs the game on DOS-based 
operating systems would eventually 
become gibberish to Windows 10. They 
also couldn’t have known what a 
monumental pain User Access Control 
(UAC) would prove in later, more 
security-conscious Windows iterations. 
Generally, then, programs don’t work 
on modern machines because those 
modern machines are running a recent 
OS. Hardware tends to play only an 
indirect role in incompatibility. For 
example, because 32-bit systems 
recognise only a 4GB maximum of 
memory, most of us run 64-bit operating 
systems to accommodate more RAM. 
But unlike 32-bit versions, 64-bit 
Windows doesn’t include 16-bit 
emulation. That means it can’t fool a 
Windows 95 application that’s searching 
for recognisable libraries in order to 
install itself correctly. The same goes for 
today’s graphics cards and processors: It 
isn’t they’re inherently too powerful for 
old software, but that the old software 
can’t interpret and harness their power 
correctly, because they don’t understand 
the drivers installed. 
The stumbling block for one particular 
vintage game might be DOS, driver 
support, missing libraries, security 
issues, or incompatibility beyond 16-bit 
systems, but the root cause is fairly 
universal: It’s the software environment. 
The obvious solution is to modify that 
software environment so the old game 
has enough information and security 
privileges to function. And that’s 
something you can go big or small with. 
Since we’re doing this methodically, it 
makes sense to begin with the small 
measures – such as patches and DOSBox 
– and work up to more drastic solutions, 
such as running Windows XP within a 
virtual machine environment. 
scour for updates
If a game installs on your PC but won’t 
run, first check online for official 
developer patches, and unofficial 
patches created by users who have 
experienced similar issues. Perhaps 
you’ll strike lucky with a game like 
Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption. 
First released in 2004, it’s long since 
been regarded as a cult classic, but 
shipped with more bugs than a mail 
order ant farm. Developer Troika was still 
releasing patches for it five years later, 
and the community took it even further 
with an unofficial patch, which still 
receives updates in 2017. Try the original 
disc, and you’ll have problems, but with 
those two downloads, Redemption runs 
perfectly on Windows 10. 
Elsewhere, community modders have 
addressed issues pertaining to entire 
game engines, fixing a whole suite of 
titles in the process. Black Isle’s Infinity 
Engine hosted many of role-playing’s 
all-time greats, such as Baldur’s Gate I 
and II, Icewind Dale, and Planescape 
Torment, but relies on Microsoft’s 
defunct DirectDraw API, and thus has all 
manner of issues on modern machines. 
Aqrit’s DDrawFix resolves those issues in 
nine games with one 5MB download. 
There are other solutions, but this is 
certainly more elegant than running an 
entire OS in a virtual machine just to 
access DirectDraw. 
compatibility  
mode options
Windows doesn’t have a great 
reputation for the efficacy of its 
compatibility mode, but in certain 
circumstances, a checked box here and a 
drag-down menu option there might be 
all it takes to solve your problem, 
whether it be installing or running the 
old game in question. When you 
right-click on a program or installer, and 
1996’s Tomb Raider was among the first 
games to need a discrete graphics card, 
so it’s hard to run in a virtual environment.
Unfinished business on the last level? 
DOSBox makes games from the 
Commander Keen era easy to run.

Windows 10

navigate to the compatibility tab, you’ll 
see several options to emulate different 
Windows versions and alter display 
settings. When you run an application in 
compatibility mode, you’re telling your 
current version of Windows to lie to that 
application, and it does so by placing a 
layer of alternate code, known as a shim, 
between the application loader and 
Windows. File paths are translated from 
new to old, so C:\Users\<username>\
Documents becomes C:\Documents and 
Settings\<username>\My Documents. It 
modifies the functions of certain .dlls so 
the application returns the expected 
information. The GetVersionEx function, 
for example, used to determine which 
version of Windows an application’s 
working with would return data from 
the shim, rather than the true kernel32.
dll’s information. In other words, when 
the application asks ‘Which version of 
Windows is this?’ compatibility mode 
steps in and says ‘Windows XP, honest!’ 
before the actual OS your PC is running 
has chance to blurt out ‘Windows 10’, 
and give the game away. 
In reality, setting the right 
compatibility mode options can often 
be part of the solution, but it’s rarely 
your one-stop shop. As a rule of thumb, 
it’s best to start by selecting the 
predominant OS at the time the game 
was released (Windows 98 for Half-Life, 
say), and running as an Administrator. 
This helps the application do what it 
needs to without Windows stepping in 
and halting it at an unexpected juncture. 
From there, you can experiment with 
256 colours and 640x480 resolution 
limiting, but it’s often best to move on 
Doing it the hard way
Depending on your 
motivation for coaxing an 
old game back into 
operation, simply getting 
it up and running on your 
current machine might 
not satisfy. A 4K HDR 
display might do wonders 
for your Steam library, but 
it only serves to highlight 
the shortcomings of a 
game designed to run at 
640x480. And there’s 
something a bit strange 
about playing Quake with 
an RGB mechanical 
keyboard and a wireless 
mouse, when all’s said 
and done. When you feel 
that the modern 
technology ensconcing 
your old software is 
detracting from the 
experience, there’s only 
one thing for it: a retro 
gaming PC build.
A word of warning: This 
can be costly if you’re not 
smart about it. Perhaps 
it’s not a big surprise that 
giant beige boxes with 
Pentium IIs and Voodoo 
2s are a thriving cottage 
industry on eBay – 
everyone has one in their 
attic or garage, and for 
some people, the only 
way to enjoy old games is 
in situ. But their appetite 
for tobacco-yellowed Dell 
keyboards has driven 
prices well beyond what 
one might reasonably 
expect, so avoid 
searching specifically for 
‘retro gaming PC’ items. If 
you instead search for 
‘Windows 98 PC’, for 
example, you’ll find 
listings for near-identical 
machines that don’t carry 
a premium for their 
trendy vintage appeal. 
It’s worth buying entire 
PCs in one package, 
though, rather than trying 
to source everything 
component by 
component. Unless 
you’ve been reading up 
on motherboard/CPU/
RAM/GPU compatibility 
of yesteryear in your 
spare time, it can be a 
nightmare to find parts 
that play nice with each 
other, or even function at 
all. Lastly, if you’re buying 
a CRT screen, look for 
photos of it in operation 
to check that it hasn’t 
demagnetised over time.
You pay more for 
‘retro PCs’ than for 
old beige boxes 
people don’t know 
what to do with.
Rogue Spear is in an awkward 
time bracket: too old for Windows 
10, too new for DOSBox. There are 
ways to coax it alive again.

and look for other solutions, rather than 
troubleshooting exclusively in the 
compatibility tab.
Dos and don’ts
Paradoxically, the further back you go 
with PC games, the easier it becomes to 
run them on modern machinery. That’s 
in large part thanks to DOSBox, which 
emulates an Intel x86-based system, 
complete with graphics and sound 
cards, mouse support, and a modem. 
DOSBox should be your first port of call 
when running any pre-Windows XP 
game, which means it opens up about 
20 years of gaming, from the 
Commander Keen days to late-nineties 
gems designed for DOS-based Windows. 
Since it’s effectively a virtual machine, 
and you probably don’t have a floppy 
disk drive in your machine, you need 
disk image files of the games you want 
to play. DOS games are generally 
considered abandonware now, so 
although it isn’t legal to download them, 
it isn’t likely to get you into trouble – see 
you need to seek out a 3DFX/Glide 
emulator designed for use in DOSBox. 
Some custom builds of the program, 
such as DOSBox SVM Daum, come with 
Direct3D, Glide, and other advanced 
features baked in, so are the best bet for 
running later DOS games that made use 
of graphics cards. Ah, the Voodoo days 
– brings a tear to the eye. And just to 
hammer the point home, don’t rule out 
DOSBox if you’re trying to run a game 
that was released for Windows 95 or 
Windows 98 – they were both DOS-
based operating systems, after all. 
Virtual insanity
If you want to take this vintage gaming 
thing to a greater extreme, it’s time to 
consider running a virtual machine with 
an older OS installed. Broadly, this isn’t 
too different an approach from running 
DOSBox, but if you find yourself playing 
a lot of games from that awkward 
post-DOS, pre-Windows 7 era, it might 
end up being more convenient. Plus, 
there’s the heady nostalgia hit of seeing 
the old OS’s desktop, and enjoying all 
the sound effects – remember when 
performing almost any action on a 
Windows machine came with its own 
bespoke sound effect?
VirtualBox is the go-to application for 
this. It’s relatively easy to install even 
dusty old Windows 3.1 on a virtual 
machine, complete with the required 
virtual hardware, although you’ll either 
need an install disc and product key for 
the OS, or a disk image. Once again, 
we’re in the murky waters of 
the ‘Abandonware, all ye who enter’ box 
at the bottom of this page.
DOSBox works by mounting a virtual  
C drive created by the user, then 
navigating around using command 
prompts. For example, C:\DOSGAMES 
becomes your DOSBox’s virtual root 
drive with the command line ‘mount c 
c:\dosgame’. For convenience’s sake, it’s 
worth keeping all your DOS game image 
files within this directory, each in 
individual folders. The ‘cd’ command 
changes directory, which means you can 
type ‘cd [game name folder]’ to navigate 
to your chosen game, then type the 
executable name to run it. Of all the 
methods available, DOSBox is one of the 
easiest and most reliable, and only 
requires a few command lines to get 
things up and running. Its limitations 
make themselves apparent when 
running 3D games that were considered 
demanding at the time, such as Tomb 
Raider, Quake, or Carmageddon. DOSBox 
runs these using its own software 
renderer, so for more advanced graphics, 
Abandonware, all ye who enter
Before even beginning to 
wrestle it into working, the 
act of acquiring an old 
Windows PC game can be 
tricky in itself. Physical 
media drives are an 
increasingly rare sight on 
modern machines, and 
there’s every chance you 
threw all your old games 
out years ago. It might be 
tempting to hunt for a 
disc ISO file of some 
forgotten treasure on an 
abandonware site, but 
before you do, it’s worth 
knowing the legality of 
those actions, and what 
the term ‘abandonware’ 
actually means.
Essentially, the term 
defines a legal no-man’s-
land in which a product’s 
copyright might not have 
expired, but since its 
owner no longer supplies 
it for legal purchase or 
supports it, it ‘abandons’ 
copyright enforcement. 
It’s safe to assume 
Activision doesn’t have a 
legal team pursuing all 
those who download ISOs 
of its 1998 shooter SiN, for 
example, but that doesn’t 
mean it’s legal to do so. 
Here’s a real example: 
Since Microsoft officially 
stopped supporting 
Windows XP in 2014, 
numerous sites have 
offered it for free, and not 
a single one has faced any 
legal action.
So, if you own a physical 
copy of a certain 
abandonware game, but 
no longer have a CD-ROM 
drive with which to install 
it, you’re still not 
technically within your 
rights to download a 
cracked version online. 
But since it can’t be 
purchased new elsewhere 
anymore, the copyright 
holder is unlikely to 
penalise you. If the 
company that holds the 
copyright no longer exists, 
you’re on even safer 
ground, and if the original 
software was distributed 
under a shareware license  
– like the first third of 
Doom – well, the 
copyright police probably 
aren’t tailing you day and 
night and preparing to 
haul you off to prison. 
Shareware is fine. The 
important thing is to 
check whether something 
really is abandonware 
before downloading it.
Sid Meier probably isn’t going to 
turn up irate at your door when 
you download Civilization I.
This is a copyright infringement 
notice. Get clued in on abandonware 
rules to avoid seeing one in the flesh.
They really were the salad days, weren’t they?

“Remember when performing almost 
any action in Windows came with its 
own bespoke sound effect?”
abandonware here, but you can find 
Windows XP and older versions for free 
online, and Microsoft hasn’t pursued any 
legal action against their distribution. 
It’s certainly preferable to be greeted 
by a familiar old interface when booting 
up games than it is to deal with 
DOSBox’s black-and-white prompt 
windows, but VirtualBox does have 
something of an Achilles’ heel: 3D 
graphics support. Its native support is 
‘experimental’ (read: doesn’t really work 
with games), and its developers have 
long maintained that if the community 
wants 3DFX/Glide virtualisation, it’s up 
to them to open-source it. Some 
members of that community have done 
exactly that – VirtualBox refers to this as 
Guest Addition content – but it’s not a 
simple task to install it, particularly when 
working in older operating systems. 
Having installed your OS via disc or 
image, restart your PC in Safe Mode with 
Networking and navigate to the Guest 
Additions file on VirtualBox’s site, then 
unzip and install it. Sounds simple, but if 
you’re on Windows 95, there are many 
compatibility hurdles to overcome  
when using an unzipper program or 
downloading the file. Even when 
successfully installed, 3D acceleration is 
prone to crashing in VirtualBox, and has 
major performance issues that will 
impact your enjoyment of the game. If 
you have your heart set on experiencing 
old games through a trusty old 
operating system, though, there is 
another – and better – way.
Partition like it’s 1999
Yep – partitioning your storage drive 
and installing an older operating system 
on to it might do the trick. This is overkill 
for the vast majority of troublesome 
retro games, because it’s a complicated 
task that risks data loss if performed 
incorrectly. But if you really want those 
old Windows 98 themes and your 
favourite games, create a partition on 
your chosen disk, and mark it as active 
by navigating to the Boot tab in 
Windows System Configuration, 
highlighting the desired partition, and 
selecting ‘Set as default’. Then reboot 
and use an old OS disk to install it to the 
partition; http://thpc.info has a clear 
step-by-step guide on how to do this. 
Beware, though: Windows 98 and older 
won’t have a clue about what to make of 
your modern hardware. You will have 
countless driver issues and ACPI 
conflicts. You will have to spend hours 
getting it to recognise your graphics 
card. But for some, the satisfaction of 
achieving a resolution beyond 640x480 
pixels when those issues are resolved is 
reward in itself. 
Summoning the gaming greats of 
yore can be a knotty problem, then, and 
there are many ways to untangle those 
knots. If the game in question falls under 
the DOS era, DOSBox should be your 
first port of call; if it doesn’t, try 
searching for patches and fan fixes. Next, 
try compatibility mode. And if all else 
fails, well, your parents might still have 
that hearing-aid-beige Packard Bell 
tower in the attic. ■
Console yourself (or not)
Creating an artificial software 
environment in which a 
program’s tricked into running 
successfully is one way to 
describe the resurrection of 
old PC games. It’s also one 
way to describe console 
emulation on PC, which has a 
history as long as it is illegal.
Its origins date back to 
1990, when programs such as 
Family Computer Emulator 
v0.35 allowed a handful of 
NES games to run on PC. 
Since then, almost every 
console has been emulated on 
PC, and even Nintendo’s DS, 
with its unique control 
options, joined the ranks. As 
technical accomplishments, 
they’re impressive, and there’s 
a subversive thrill in seeing 
another platform holder’s 
ident appearing on a PC 
monitor. The key difference 
between using old PC games 
on a new PC and using old 
console games on a new PC is 
that you’re breaking two sets 
of copyright laws when you 
do the latter. Consoles are 
closed platforms, and their 
games are licensed strictly for 
use on that very specific 
hardware. What constitutes a 
PC is open to interpretation, 
when you factor in the 
Raspberry Pi, Steam OS 
machines, office workstations, 
and quad-SLI gaming rigs. 
What constitutes a 
PlayStation 4 is not. 
There haven’t been many 
legal cases, but when Sony 
tried to sue two PS1 emulators 
in the 1990s, an uneasy accord 
was established: Since an 
emulator doesn’t re-use code, 
it’s not illegal. The games are. 
The legality gets trickier 
when considering 
discontinued platforms. 
Arguably, since the Sega 
Saturn was discontinued long 
ago, it can be considered 
abandonware (along with its 
software library). But what if 
the platform comes back to 
life, as with Nintendo’s SNES 
Mini? Steer clear, and 
concentrate on PC gaming’s 
voluminous library instead.
Classics like Doom don’t need much to get 
running, thanks to Steam and community 
patches. Mouse support – what a treat!
Tekken 2: Best on the console it was intended 
for, however possible it may be to run on PC.

25 best apps

Play any video
Want to be able to play just about 
any video file without having to find 
a suitable player? Install VLC for 
Windows (free, Microsoft Store) and 
you can add your music and video 
libraries and play pretty much any 
format you come across. Need to 
play DVD videos too? Install the 
desktop version from www.videolan.
org/vlc instead.
Keep apps  
up to date
Free software updates don’t just fix 
bugs and plug security holes, they 
often add new features too. Make 
sure you’re not missing out by 
installing Personal Software Inspector 
(free, http://bit.ly/softinspector). It 
can silently keep apps updated in the 
background, or you can configure it 
to alert you when updates become 
available so you stay in full control  
of the process.
Remove 
programs 
thoroughly
Once you’ve installed a few of these 
great apps you may discover one or 
two you don’t really use. Make sure 
they’re completely removed – along 
with other unwanted apps – with the 
help of IObit Uninstaller (free, www.
iobit.com/en/advanceduninstaller.
php). Its powerful scan removes 
leftover files and Registry entries 
– just make sure you untick the 
option to install the full Advanced 
SystemCare suite during installation.

Record and  
edit audio
Want to record narration or edit an 
existing audio file? The best tool for 
the job is Audacity (free, www.
audacityteam.org). You can record 
through a mic, capture streaming 
audio or – with the right cables – 
capture sound from an external 
source such as a cassette player or 
turntable. Then use Audacity’s 
powerful tools to trim, edit and fix 
noise-related issues like hiss.
Manage your 
passwords 
securely
If you use LastPass Premium (US$24/
year, www.lastpass.com) to keep your 
online passwords safe and easy to 
access, but don’t want to have to 
open your browser to get at them, 
install the LastPass app (free, 
Microsoft Store). This enables you  
to view your passwords, secure notes 
and form fillers – copy and paste 
them into another app window,  
plus edit them too.
Office for all  
the family
Free office suites are all well and 
good, but Microsoft Office 365 
Home (£7.99/mo, www.office.com) is 
exceptional value considering it 
covers five PCs and Macs in your 
home, plus gives you 1TB storage on 
OneDrive. You get the latest versions 
of Office, plus you can install 
powerful mobile versions on up to 
five tablets and five phones too.

Manage  
your email
Looking for a versatile email client 
that works with just about any email 
account? Thunderbird (free, www.
getthunderbird.com) offers all the 
core functionality you need, plus 
some handy extras like linking large 
email attachments (via third-party 
plug-ins) to your cloud storage, 
making them easy to share with 
others without clogging up inboxes.
Detailed  
battery stats
The Battery taskbar notification area 
icon provides basic detail about your 
laptop’s battery. Install Save Battery 
(free, Microsoft Store) and you can 
access lots more useful detail, such  
as when it was last plugged in, its 
discharge rate and overall health. You 
can set battery alerts too, but the 
history feature requires upgrading to 
the Pro version (£1.19).
Rip and  
convert video
Sometimes you need video files in a 
specific format so they’ll work with 
your phone or another device. MP4 is 
the most common format around, 
and Handbrake (free, www.
handbrake.fr) can convert video from 
most formats into MP4 – it can even 
be used to quickly optimise video for 
playback on specific devices too.

Open any 
compressed file
Windows 10 ships with built-in 
support for ZIP files, but what 
happens if you come across a 
different kind of compressed file – 
such as .rar or .7z? Don’t worry, 7-Zip 
(free, www.7-zip.org) will enable you 
to not only access these file archives, 
it can also peek inside virtual drives 
and create archives in common 
formats too.
Take a failsafe 
backup
What happens if you’re forced to 
reinstall Windows? Even if your data 
is backed up or stored on a different 
drive, the time taken reinstalling all 
your programs and settings after the 
event can take hours. Take a full 
system image using Macrium Reflect 
Free (free, www.macrium.com/
reflectfree.asp) and you need never 
worry about losing programs, 
settings or data again.
Clean out  
your PC
We often need reminding to keep 
storage drives free from clutter, so it 
keeps your PC running as efficiently 
as possible. Trimming startup 
programs and cleaning out various 
parts of your computer will help 
achieve maximum speed. CCleaner 
(free, www.piriform.com) will help 
you stay on top of system 
maintenance and prevent slowdown.

Embrace portable 
applications
We love portable apps – these are special 
versions of programs that contain 
themselves to a single folder on your PC, 
with no Registry entries or files cluttering 
up other directories, enabling them to be 
run on other PCs from a USB drive. Use 
the PortableApps Platform (free, www.
portableapps.com) to find and manage 
these via a Start menu-like interface.
Edit text  
with style
Notepad is fine for basic text-editing, 
but if you’re looking to step up, then 
EditPad Lite (free for personal use, 
www.editpadlite.com) is an essential 
upgrade. Open multiple files in tabs 
and switch between them, enjoy 
unlimited undo and automatic 
backups as you type, plus store 
multiple text snippets for easy  
access via the Clip Collection.
64  |  
  |  January 2018

View and  
create PDFs
PDFs ensure that documents you 
share look the same on whichever 
computer or platform they’re viewed 
on. These days, all good free PDF 
reader tools can create PDFs from 
other sources too, and our current 
favourite is Foxit Reader (free, www.
foxitsoftware.com), which also has 
the benefit of being light on system 
resources and it’s extremely fast too.
Super-powered 
note-taking
Simplenote is great for quick notes, 
but if you want a fully featured 
digital notebook with support for 
annotations, photos, lists and even 
freehand sketches, then Microsoft 
OneNote (free, Microsoft Store) is 
a better bet. You can even transfer 
content from other apps, services 
and websites via a variety of 
third-party tools (including 
Microsoft Edge).
Run virtual 
machines
Virtual PCs enable you to run older 
and alternative operating systems 
like Windows 7 or even XP – they’re a 
great way to continue using older 
software (and some USB hardware) 
that’s no longer compatible with 
Windows 10. All you need to supply 
is a legal copy of Windows, then run 
VirtualBox (free, www.virtualbox.org) 
along with the Extensions Pack.

FOLDER WINDOWS 
APPEAR ON STARTUP 
Q Some weeks ago – and  
with no apparent reason – 
Windows started opening folder 
windows on startup. It doesn’t 
happen every single time Windows 
loads, but I consulted some online 
experts who copied and pasted 
some code to make changes to the 
Registry. I’m a little wary of this as 
the instructions were rather vague. 
Can you assist please?
Ian McAndrew
Mayank’s solution
We instructed Ian to first 
verify the problem 
wasn’t linked to any 
start-up programs. To this end he 
installed BootRacer (www.greatis.
com/bootracer/) and enabled 
Startup Control. This not only lists 
start-up programs as they’re being 
loaded, it implements a 10-second 
delay before starting them to give 
Windows time to finish setting itself 
up. The windows all appeared 
during this initial delay, which 
indicated that the problem was 
with Windows itself.
There are a few Registry entries 
that – if altered incorrectly or 
missing – can cause File Explorer 
windows to appear. But even after 
correcting these, Ian was still 
plagued with three pop-up 
windows, all pointing to different 
external hard drives. Ian checked 
Start > Settings > Devices > 
AutoPlay and set the default 
AutoPlay behaviour for removable 
drives to ‘Take no action’. On 
rebooting Windows, the three 
remaining pop-up windows 
completely vanished.

Jargon buster!

it’s malicious or not?
Ona Orozco
Rob’s solution
This is linked to your 
attempts to access a 
specific website, or more 
precisely a specific component on 
that page – typically an advert. 
Both AOL and Yahoo! sites have 
been cited as possible sources for 
this certificate error, but it will be 
the advert rather than the site. 
Installing an ad-blocker (or using a 
browser with built-in ad-blocker 
support such as Opera) should 
hopefully resolve the problem.

c Tropman

There is a Dashlane 
extension for Edge, 
which you can install 
from the Microsoft Store (http://bit.

you’ve done this and it isn’t 
working properly. There’s an Edge 
FAQ at https://support.dashlane.
com, but it’s not particularly 
illuminating. You could try the 
email contact if you have more 
details to share about the  
problem in question.
The problem with your email 
redirecting to Edge is linked to your 
use of Internet Explorer 11. The

VIRTUAL TEcHNIcIAN 
WON’T RUN 
Q My Windows 10 upgrade has 
come unstuck after running 
like ‘oiled silk’. After safely installing 
McAfee Anti-Virus, I tried and failed 
to install the complementary 
Virtual Technician package. 
McAfee’s technicians point the 
blame firmly at Windows 10, with 
numerous errors in the Event logs 
pointing to ‘Microsoft Jscript 
runtime error 800a01a08’. Can  
you suggest anything I can do to 
resolve this problem?
John Ellinghouse
Nick P’s solution
McAfee’s technicians are 
being a bit disingenuous 
blaming Windows 10 – a 
search online revealed the error 
had been reported as far back as 
2010, with the finger firmly pointed 
at the Virtual Technician program 
itself. We had no problems 
downloading and running the tool 
this end, and after a virtual chat 
with Microsoft, John returned to 
McAfee. This time, the problem was 
transferred up the ladder and after 
enabling the hidden administrator 
user account, Virtual Technician 
was installed successfully (and 
works correctly across all user 
accounts). John revealed that his 
user account is now seven years 
old, and originated back in 
Windows 7 – with this in mind, it’s 
not surprising that occasional 
glitches like this occur.

WI-FI WORRIES 
Q I’ve seen a few emails  
and texts about a Wi-Fi 
vulnerability doing the rounds. 
What is it, and should I be 
concerned by it?
Debbie Steadman
Rob’s  solution
There’s a reasonable 
summary of the threat 
– dubbed KRACK (Key 
Reinstallation AttaCK) – at the 
TP-Link website (http://uk.tp-link.
com/faq-1970.html) Long story 
short, while the vulnerability is 
concerning, you need to remember 
that a potential hacker would have 
to be physically within your 
network’s Wi-Fi range to even 
begin to exploit it. 
There are several ways you can 
protect yourself, though: first, 
download the latest security patch 
or update for each of your wireless 
devices – not just your computer or 
phone, but other wireless devices 
like smart tech too. Windows 
patched this vulnerability back in 
October, for example. Routers in AP 
(Access Point) mode aren’t affected, 
but wireless repeaters almost 
certainly are, so make sure that 
these are updated too.
Second, add additional layers  
of encryption to your Internet 
connection: implement a VPN, for 
example, and all Internet traffic is 
subject to further encryption 
beyond the reach of a KRACK 
attack. These will protect you both 
at home and when out and about. 
One area where you should 
exercise additional caution is when 
using wireless technologies away 
from home – even paying for your 
coffee through a wireless Point-of-
Sale machine could render you 
vulnerable, for example. Ask the 
shop whether their network 
connection is wired before  
handing over your credit card.

APPS MISSINg AFTER 
FALL UPDATE 
Q After installing the latest major 
update to Windows 10, I’ve 
discovered a number of apps are 
missing. They’ve disappeared from 
the Start menu and search, but 
attempting to reinstall them from 
the Microsoft Store fails because it 
believes they’re already present. 
Valerie Unwin
cat’s solution
Try going to Settings > 
Apps. Scroll down and 
locate one of the 
missing apps, which should still be 
listed here. Click it, then click 
Advanced Options if it’s present 
before trying first Repair and then 
Reset. If this fails, you might want to 
consider removing them – not all 
apps can be deleted this way, so for 
built-in Microsoft apps try IObit 
Uninstaller Free (www.iobit.com), 
which has the added benefit of 
scrubbing all leftovers too. Once 
removed, the apps – including 
those pre-installed by Windows – 
should be available for download 
once again through the Store. ■

72 How to master the 
Windows 10 desktop 
74 Change the way 
the Start menu works
 

You’ll spend a lot of time there, so here are 
some great ways to make it work for you…
Master the desktop
hen not actually using 
applications, the Windows 
desktop is where you’ll 
spend much of your time, 
moving files about, hunting for that 
obscure application you installed six 
months ago and suddenly need, or 
lining up your windows so that they 
fill the space perfectly (a time-wasting 
pastime that’s all but dead now 
thanks to window snapping).
In Windows 10, the desktop and the 
Taskbar get a few new tricks that 
make working with files and folders 
even easier, and the new search bar 
means pulling up an application you 
don’t use often is a breeze. Follow 
these tips to a happy start…
W
1 Show desktop/peek
The Show Desktop button isn’t marked, and some people 
don’t even know it exists. Press this anonymous section at the 
extreme right of the Taskbar, and all your open windows will 
minimise. Hover the mouse pointer over it, and you’ll get a 
preview ‘peek’ at the desktop that reverts when you move your 
mouse pointer away. It’s very useful when you’ve got a chaotic 
number of windows open on your desktop.
2 Virtual desktops
If you find your desktop frequently getting overcrowded as 
you work, why not offload some of the mess onto another one? 
Click the Task View button to the right of Cortana’s search box on 
the Taskbar, and you’ll be taken to a screen that shows your open 
apps, and also your desktops. Add a new one, or even more, and 
you’ll be able to flick between them with different apps open on 
each. It’s a great way to stay organised on your PC.
4 Window snapping
A real godsend for those who used to tease their window 
edges out until they exactly matched the edge of the screen, 
snapping in Windows 10 enables you to have two or more 
windows open that completely fill their areas of the screen. Pick 
up a window and move it to the extreme left or right edge of the 
desktop to try it (you’ll see it ‘snap’ to the new half screen format). 
You can adjust how much of the screen they take up too.
3 Scroll inactive windows
An annoyance for anyone who’s come to Windows from 
using the Mac, the ability to scroll the window your pointer is 
currently over – instead of the one that’s currently active – is new 
in Windows 10. So, if you have a browser and a word processor 
open, and are reading one while typing in the other, you can now 
scroll down in the browser without having to take your focus 
away from your text document.
72  |  
  |  January 2018

5 Desktop icons
The Windows 10 desktop icons have a pixellated look, and 
if this offends you it’s easy to change them. Luckily, there are icon 
packs available online – including the shinier Windows 8 icons. 
Download the icon pack you want to use, then go to Start > 
Settings > Personalisation > Themes. Click the ‘Desktop icon 
Settings’ and select the icons you want to place on the desktop, 
then use the Change Icon option to change their look.
6 Shake to minimise
This may sound like something left over from a tablet build 
of Windows that needs a built-in accelerometer, but picking up a 
window with your mouse pointer and shaking it back and forth 
will minimise every other window, leaving you with a clear and 
uninterrupted view of the one you want to work with. It’s much 
faster than clicking several minimise buttons, and it’s a fun little 
quirk that’s a good one to remember.
8 Window management
In addition to window snapping, you can arrange your 
windows in some other ways too. Right-click on the Taskbar to 
reveal three window arrangement schemes: ‘Cascade windows’; 
‘Show windows stacked’; and ‘Show windows side by side’. These 
are similar to the Windows menu’s functions that have been 
available all the way back to Windows 3.1, and can make it quick 
and easy to find what you’re looking for.
7 Notifications
The notifications panel – or Action Centre – slides in from 
the right of the screen, with a button in the system tray, and will 
house any messages that apps or Windows components want to 
send you. It’s where you’ll find links to details of Windows updates 
that have been installed on your machine, and any social media 
messages or upcoming calendar events. You can customise it so 
it’s as intrusive as you can deal with.

Welcome to Windows 10 
Master the desktop

The Start menu in Windows 10 is more powerful than 
ever – here are some easy tips to make it work for you
Customise the Start menu
he Start menu’s return was big news 
when Windows 10 launched, and it 
has evolved as the operating system 
has been updated. It’s become a fast, 
and efficient way to access apps and settings – 
Windows 8’s full-screen monstrosity is now a 
distant memory, thankfully!
However, if you don’t like how the Start menu 
looks when you first pop it up on your fresh 
install of Windows 10, it doesn’t have to stay that 
way. It’s fully customisable in ways that were 
never possible in earlier versions of the 
operating system, and can be made to work in 
just about any way you want, standing out from 
its background for ease of reading, or 
automatically blending in with the colour 
scheme of whatever theme you have currently 
set on your desktop.
T
1  
Colour
Your Start menu’s background can be any colour you like 
– all you have to do is untick a box. Open up Settings, then 
Personalisation and finally Colours. Untick the ‘Automatically pick 
an accent colour from my background’ option and you’ll be able 
to pick a colour from the palette. So your Start menu can be a 
contrasting red or yellow rather than a dull blue or grey. Play 
around to find a combination that works for you.
2  
Size
To make space for all the customising you can do to the 
Start menu, you can easily resize it to your liking. Just move your 
mouse pointer to the top-border or right-border of the Start 
Menu, the pointer will change into arrows, and you’ll be able to 
increase or decrease height and width, dragging it out to 
completely fill the screen if you want to. This is particularly useful 
if you have a PC filled with programs that you access regularly.
4 Hide program lists
By default, the Start menu will show you lists of both your 
most used programs and the most recently opened ones. This can 
end up repeating itself, so if you want to get rid of one or the 
other of the lists, or both, open up Settings > Personalisation > 
Start, from where you’ll be able to toggle the lists on or off. You 
can also prevent apps from appearing on the lists so you only get 
a view of the things you really need from day to day.
3  
Folders and tiles
Your Start menu is made up of lists and tiles, and some of 
these can be shortcuts to folders such as Documents. Settings > 
Personalisation > Start enables you to tinker with this, so if you 
never shoot videos you can stop the empty Videos folder from 
taking up space on the menu. You can turn the links to the 
Settings window – and the one that opens an empty File Explorer 
window – on and off too.

8  
Bring back the Start screen!
It may have been almost universally mocked and reviled in 
Windows 8, but the full-screen Start menu is still there in Windows 
10, ready to block out all your work at a single press of the [Win] 
key! But, if you liked it, go to Settings > Personalisation > Start and 
tick the box marked ‘Use full-screen Start when in the desktop’. 
Note that wording: the Start menu now won’t actually cover up 
your apps like it used to do in Windows 8.
7  
Pin tiles and shortcuts
If there’s something you need to be able to find quickly, but 
which gets lost in the lists of the Start menu, you can pin and 
reposition it so it’s always prominently placed. To do that right-
click an item and choose ‘Pin to Start’. It will now appear in tiles. 
Now click and drag the tile to where to want to move it to. To 
resize the tile, right-click, choose Resize then the tile size you 
want. You can pin shortcuts to the Taskbar for easy access too.
5  
Use it to search with
Hitting the [Win] key on your keyboard to pop up the Start 
menu’s Search box is one of the fastest ways to look for anything 
in Windows 10. Just type a few characters and you will get 
suggestions for applications and documents stored on your 
computer that match your initial query. You can also use the 
arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate the Start menu, if you’d 
rather not use the mouse.
6  
Live tiles
Live tiles are tiles that are constantly updated with data, 
usually gleaned over the Internet to make them up-to-date. 
There’s one for the Mail app that shows your most recent 
messages, one for the Weather app that uses your PC’s location to 
tell you what’s going on outside the window, and so on. If you 
find them distracting, you can turn them off by right-clicking 
them and choosing the appropriate option.

This issue’s highlights

T
wo years have passed since 
Microsoft launched the 
original Surface Book – a 
2-in-1 laptop with an innovative 
design and class-leading features. 
It’s now been replaced by two new 
models: an updated version of the 
original 13.5-inch Surface Book. 
Plus a new 15-inch model, which 
we are looking at here.
Price and availability
The 15-inch Surface Book 2 (already 
on sale in the US and coming to the 
UK in 2018) is an expensive laptop, 
with the top-end model, on test 
here, costing around £2,503 
($3,299), although even the 
entry-level version comes in at a 
still steep £1,847 ($2,499), the only 
difference being a much smaller 
256GB solid-state drive inside.
The 13.5-inch version starts at 
£1,499 ($1,499) for a 7th-generation 
Intel Kaby Lake Core i5 processor 
with integrated graphics and 
256GB of storage – getting the 
Nvidia GTX 1050 graphics and 
8th-generation Intel Core i7 CPU 
will cost you £1,999 ($1,999), with 
each storage option from there 
costing another £500/$500. None of 
these prices include the optional – 
but essential – £99 ($99) Surface 
Pen. It’s high time Microsoft 
included this as standard.
The similarly premium Dell XPS 
15, by contrast, starts at £1,429 
($999) with 7th-generation Intel 
Core processors and Nvidia GTX 
1050 graphics at the higher-end.
Design
When it comes to the look-and-feel 
of the 15-inch Surface Book, it’s true 
to say that Microsoft has simply 
super-sized its 13.5-inch sibling. 
That’s not necessarily a bad thing 
– Microsoft has clearly taken what 
it’s learned from the Surface Book 
i7 and gone to town on it, crafting a 
light, but power-packed 15-inch 
laptop. Better yet, when detached 
from its base, this is the lightest-
feeling 15-inch tablet we’ve ever 
tested – to the point that it’ll feel 
deceptively small in your hands.
That said, the Surface Book 2’s 
fulcrum hinge makes it a little more 
unwieldy to cram into a backpack 
than other laptops, and Microsoft 
hasn’t done much design-wise with 
the 15-incher’s larger size: the glass 
trackpad isn’t quite as wide or deep 
as, say, the 15-inch MacBook Pro’s 
when it could have been, given the 
space. Also, the lack of up-firing 
stereo speakers in the base is a 
glaring omission, with ample space 
on all three remaining sides of the 
keyboard for extra audio chambers.
Instead, you’re stuck with the 
rather tinny, front-firing speakers on 
the tablet portion of the device. 
The bigger keyboard base should 
give you bigger everything, frankly, 
not just bigger graphics. The audio 
jack is also still in the same odd, 
upper-right position, causing 
headphone cables to dange over 
your hands when typing.

difference on games or even an 
external GPU box plus a graphics 
card. Few laptops will keep as cool 
as this one under pressure, though, 
partly thanks a design which keeps 
the CPU and GPU apart.
The 15-inch Surface Book 2 is 
equally adept at everyday tasks, its 
quad-core CPU and 16GB of RAM 
barely breaking a sweat.
Battery life
The Surface Book 2 also has very 
impressive battery life, besting just 
about every 2-in-1 laptop we’ve 
tested to date. In our battery 
benchmark test it clocked up seven 
hours 39 minutes – its precedessor 
lasted less than half that. This figure 
is testament to the size of the 
battery in the 15-inch model. 
Summary
The 15-inch Surface Book 2 is the 
most powerful and versatile 2-in-1 
laptop we’ve ever tested, but it’s 
not perfect – in simply creating a 
15-inch version of the 13.5-inch 
original, Microsoft has missed 
opportunites to do more with that 
extra space design-wise. It is clear, 
however, that a lot of hard work 
and engineering expertise have 
gone into crafting this device. The 
proof is in its nigh-on unparalleled 
performance and longevity, not to 
mention its stylish, tactile design. ■
The best 2-in-1 laptop we’ve seen 
so far – expensive it may be, but it 
really is worth every penny.
Speaking of which, typing on the 
Surface Book 2 is a pleasure, thanks 
to a brightly backlit keyboard that 
demonstrates deep-enough travel 
and punchy feedback. However, 
the feedback could stand to be a 
touch more forceful.
That said, we like the 15-inch 
Surface Book 2’s design. But, 
Microsoft has missed opportunities 
to refine the product and make the 
experience that much bigger when 
it comes to how this particular 
model feels, looks and sounds.
Display and Surface Pen
Of course, we’re just as in love with 
the Surface Book 2 (15-inch) display 
as we were with the previous two 
models. Text looks crisp on the 
screen as do photos and video, 
even if the 3:2 aspect ratio makes 
for some awfully thick black bars 
when watching the latter.
The display’s resolution is 
unmatched short of 4K laptops. 
We’re told that Microsoft has also 
devoted a lot of its efforts into 
improving the touch response of 
the Surface Book 2’s PixelSense 
display, and it shows – there’s no 
perceptible lag between what you 
draw with the Surface Pen and your 
doodles appearing onscreen.
In fact, if you scribble on a sticky 
note and run the Surface Pen off of 
the note window – you’ll see traces 
of ink appear on whatever is there, 
although it will almost immediately 
disappear. That’s thanks to a special 
processor rendering the ink before 
even Windows 10 does.
Attaching and detaching the 
display from the keyboard base is 
also speedy. Whether you’re 
switching from laptop to tablet 
mode or back again, it takes less 
than a second before you’re 
successfully tapping or typing away  
on the Surface Book 2.
Performance
To say that the Surface Book 2 is 
powerful would be selling it short. 
This is the strongest 2-in-1 laptop 
we’ve ever tested, ready to go 
toe-to-toe with not only every 
hybrid laptop on the market but a 
wide range of gaming laptops, too.
The Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics 
inside the laptop’s base are more 
than enough to handle the very 
latest games at 1080p resolution – 
and at playable frame rates at 
native resolutions too. That’s 
something that can’t normally be 
said of Surface devices, much less 
any 2-in-1 laptops. 
Not that gaming should be the 
reason you buy a Surface Book 2. 
Frankly, you could get the same 
experience for less and spend the

hose who carry sensitive 
information around with 
them on a daily basis are 
doubtless concerned by the 
possibility of losing the device 
carrying that precious data (or 
worse still, having it stolen). Equally, 
if the mobile storage you use is 
secure, what happens if you fail to 
return to the office unexpectedly?
Those concerns are addressed by 
the new iStorage diskAshur Pro2 
external hard drive, a compact 
storage device designed to work 
with secure data without the need 
to install software on all the 
systems it will meet.
Design
The Pro2 joins the diskAshur Pro, a 
product iStorage makes alongside 
other robust and secure storage 
devices. It comes in 500GB, 1TB, 
2TB, 3TB, 4TB and 5TB capacities 
(it’s the latter we’re testing here).
At £489 ($670), the Pro2 is pricey 
as 5TB external drives go, being 
four times the price of Seagate’s 
Backup Plus 5TB drive, and more 
than twice the price of LaCie’s 
rugged Thunderbolt 5TB models.
After removing the Pro2 from its 
packaging, you soon realise why – 
it is, without doubt, one of the best 
pieces of product engineering that 
we’ve ever seen: The upper and 
lower surfaces are cool-to-the-
touch metal, and the waistband is 
soft textured rubber. The Pro2 also 
comes with a foam-lined carry case, 
giving it a snug home to live in 
when you’re not using it.
The Pro2 is just 84mm wide, 
124mm long and 20mm deep, 
dictating that this uses 2.5-inch 
drives internally. As if to underline 
how much of the cost goes into the 
engineering, the 2TB model costs 
£329 (around $435), only £160 
(around $210) cheaper.
From a design perspective, two 
features make this drive special. 
First is the built-in USB cable. It’s 
only 12cm long when unclipped, 
but that’s enough to attach it to a 
PC. The fact that the cable can’t be 
detached – and therefore lost – is 
the best aspect of this design. 
Although it would be unfortunate if 
the USB blade ever got damaged.
The other standout feature is the 
built-in numeric pad, which is used 
to enter a numeric password that’s 
needed for access. The buttons are 
most likely on a membrane, but 
they’re positive to use and make a 
nice click to confirm that you’ve 
pressed them. In addition to the 
numbers, there are a few special 
keys for operating the unit when 
it’s attached to a PC.
Above the number pad are three 
coloured LEDs that confirm the 
locked condition, and also to show 
drive activity and offer feedback on 
important procedures.

secure storage devices that can be

Performance
However iStorage has wired the 
internal drives to the encryption 
engine, it doesn’t impact negatively 
on the drive’s performance. With 
148MB/s reads and 140MB/s writes, 
the Pro2 has some intent about it.
While an SSD would be quicker 
(iStorage sells those too), those 
performance levels are about as 
rapid as hard disk-based storage is 
likely to be. The Pro2 is also IP56 
certified, making it water and 
dust-resistant. An extra touch in 
terms of the physical protection is 
that the keys on the pad are coated 
in epoxy. The coating has the dual 
benefit of not only extending the 
life of the keys, but it also makes it 
harder to work out which keys are 
being used on a regular basis.
As a final sweetener to any 
purchaser, iStorage is doing a deal 
where it gives you free software 
licenses from Nero and ESET, 
should you use either of those.
Summary
If it wasn’t for the eye-watering 
cost, we’d be recommending the 
iStorage diskAshur Pro2 more 
forcefully. The combination of a 
well-considered security model 
with a superbly engineered device 
is an alluring one. How secure it is 
in practice, though, rather depends 
on you, and how seriously you take 
securing your data – while the Pro2 
might have relatively few technical 
flaws, the data on it could still be 
exposed by sloppy practices.
As with most security systems, 
it’s the human operator who is 
most often the weakest point. ■
A genuinely secure storage device 
that’s built to handle physical 
abuse and nefarious decryption.
thinking. So what has iStorage 
done to avoid the most common 
security pitfalls? At the heart of this 
design is a secure microprocessor 
(Common Criteria EAL4+ ready), 
that handles its encryption. That,  
in theory, means that if the bare 
drive is extracted from its case, an 
attacker is no closer to getting to 
the data stored upon it.
What any data thief needs is the 
seven-to-15 digit numeric password 
created when the Pro2 was last 
configured. Guessing isn’t a good 
option because failure to enter the 
correct code enough times will 
result in the drive deleting the 
encryption key, rendering the 
contents beyond reach, forever – 
true, there may be people in the 
security services who know how to 
crack AES-XTS 256-bit, but for 
everyone else, the data is lost.
In addition to software defences, 
the Pro2 has numerous hardware 
safeguards in place to protect it 
against external tampering, bypass 
attacks and fault injections. Should 
it detect any attempt to get into 
the case or tinker with USB, it will 
enter a deadlock frozen state, 
making further assault pointless.
Devices with numeric pads such 
as this usually come with a PC app 
you need to install to make it work, 
but the Pro2 is fully self-contained.
That enables it to work as well 
with a Windows, Mac or Linux 
computer. You can format it to 
whatever file system you use – even 
one you have created yourself.
The Pro2 comes with a default 
Admin PIN number defined, and 
you can change that directly using 
the pad. But, armed with an Admin 
password, you can also create an 
individual user PIN (up to four), 
which is handy if you share use of 
the drive with someone else.
Both Admin and User modes can 
also be made read-only, thus 
avoiding the danger of deleting 
things inadvertently. But the most 
Bond-esque PIN code you can 
define is the one which initiates a 
‘self-destruct’ sequence. This 
initiates an internal crypto-wipe 
where all the PINs and data are 
erased, and the drive reformatted 
before it can be used.
Our only reservations about this 
and other features are that setting 
some of them is complicated and 
you’ll need to have the Pro2’s 
manual handy (supplied as a PDF 
on the drive) to avoid mucking up 
the procedure. We’re sure after 
regular use it will become second 
nature to change a user PIN or the 
length of time before the drive 
automatically locks. But initially, it’s 
a little daunting.

T
he X-E3 is the latest X Series 
mirrorless camera from 
Fujifilm to get its 24.3MP 
X-Trans CMOS III APS-C sensor, 
which delivers a decent boost in 
resolution over the 16.3MP sensor 
founds in its X-E2S predecessor. It 
also gets a moderate increase in 
ISO range over the X-E2S, with a 
native sensitivity range of ISO200-
12,800, and an expanded range of 
ISO100-51,200. And unlike the 
X-E2S, the X-E3 supports raw too.
Features
The X-E3 is a classic rangefinder-
style camera with a compact, 
streamlined design. It features a 
high-resolution 2.36 million dot 
OLED electronic viewfinder (EVF) 
with a 0.62x magnification, while 
the rear of the camera houses a 
7.62mm, 1,040K dot touchscreen. 
You can tap the display to 
acquire focus and trigger the 
shutter, as well as being able to 
swipe through and pinch-to-zoom 
when reviewing images. There’s no 
direct control for navigating the 
menus, but the X-E3 lets you use 
flicking motions to activate 
pre-assigned functions. You can 
also use the Quick menu. 
The X-E3 includes Wi-Fi, NFC and 
Bluetooth connectivity, which 
enables you to transfer images 
from the camera to a paired 
smartphone or tablet using the free 
Fujifilm Camera Remote app.
The X-E3 offers 4K video capture 
at 30p, as well as Full HD at 60p. 
There’s also a 2.5mm microphone 
input, but no audio monitoring.
 
Build and handling
The X-E3 is the smallest X Series 
camera with a viewfinder currently 
available. Partner it with a couple of 
Fujifilm’s f/2 prime lenses, and you 
have a great little camera system. 
There’s a decent-sized handgrip, 
while the raised thumb rest on the 
camera’s rear makes it incredibly 
comfortable to hold one-handed. 
With the X-E3’s body shrinking 
compared to the X-E2s, the built-in 
flash has been sacrificed in favour 
of a pocket-sized hotshoe-mounted 
flash. Otherwise, the top plate of 
the X-E3 remains the same as on 
the X-E2, with shutter speed and 
exposure compensation dials 
complementing the shutter button 
and small function button. 
The shutter speed dial offers 
settings from 1 to 1/4000 sec plus 
Bulb, Time and Automatic, with the 
exposure compensation dial 
running from -3 to +3EV. There’s 
also a ‘C’ setting, which enables you 
to set compensation up to ±5EV 
using the command dial. 
A subtle change is the arrival of a 
small rocker switch around the 
shutter speed dial, with the option 
to set the camera to full Auto.
The biggest changes are at the 
rear of the X-E3, which has a more 
streamlined layout than the X-E2. 
The display butts up to the left 
edge of the camera, while the

short of DSLRs such as the Nikon 
D5600, which has an 820-shot 
battery life. A dedicated charger is 
bundled in the box, while you can 
charge via USB as well.
Image quality
The X-E3 is capable of taking some 
highly accomplished images for an 
APS-C-based camera. Detail is 
excellent, and the X-E3 comes with 
a range of film simulation modes, 
with 15 effects to choose from. 
Another area where the X-E3 
excels is dynamic range. There’s 
plenty of flexibility for recovering 
detail and highlights in images – 
especially raw files, with about four 
stops to play with at low ISOs.
The X-E3 also handles image 
noise very well. At the lower end of 
the sensitivity range files look very 
clean, with no signs of luminance 
(grain-like) noise in our shots – it’s 
only at ISO3200 that it becomes 
noticeable, and its organic 
appearance means it’s not a big 
issue, while even up to ISO12,800 
results won’t be unusable.
Summary
The Fujifilm X-E3 is a great little 
camera with a premium finish, 
tactile controls and an interface 
that make it a joy to shoot with. 
There are no complaints when it 
comes to image quality either – 
photos are rich and detailed. 
Connectivity options are good too.
Fujifilm may have shrunk the 
camera, but it hasn’t sacrificed 
performance, and the X-E3 is 
everything you’d want in a 
compact-sized mirrorless camera. ■
A perfect combination of size and 
performance makes the Fujifilm 
X-E3 a compact camera to savour.
four-way controller from its the 
X-E2 has disappeared. Instead, you 
use the touchscreen control to flick 
left, right, up or down to access 
four different functions or settings, 
which can be customised. The X-E3 
also has a focus lever, enabling you 
to toggle to the desired AF point; 
and you can use it to navigate the 
camera’s menu system, if you wish.
Autofocus
The Fujifilm X-E3 uses a 325-point 
AF system. This is broken down into 
169 phase-detect points set out in a 
grid of 13x13 in the middle of the 
frame, with an additional two grids 
of 6x13 contrast-detect points on 
either side to make up the 325 
focusing points. That’s if you’re 
using the X-E3’s single-point AF 
mode. When you opt for Zone or 
Wide/Tracking, coverage drops to a 
91-point AF arrangement. In this 
instance, there’s a central 7x7 grid 
of phase-detect points.
For static subjects, focusing is 
swift – the X-E3 locks onto a variety 
of subjects under a range of 
lighting conditions, while switching 
to continuous AF sees a welcome 
improvement in focusing accuracy 
over the X-E2. With five presets to 
choose from, AF tracking is much 
improved. Focusing speed could be 
quicker, but it’s a solid performer. 
Performance
The X-E3 takes 0.4 seconds to 
power up, while shutter lag is 
just 0.05 seconds. 
While the X-E3 isn’t marketed as 
an action camera, it is capable of 
shooting at a very fast 14fps using 
the electronic shutter, or 8fps if you 
use the camera’s mechanical 
shutter – if you do, expect to be 
able to shoot 23 raw files or 62 
JPEGs before the buffer slows up.
The X-E3 uses a 256-zone TTL 
metering system, which normally 
performs well. It can sometimes 
underexpose a shot, but this is easy 
to correct thanks to the exposure 
compensation button – or you can 
simply lift the shadows in post-
processing if you wish.
The electronic viewfinder image 
is lovely and bright, and, thanks to 
the 2.36 million dot resolution, rich 
in detail. While there’s no tilt or 
vari-angle positioning on the rear 
display, the 7.62mm touchscreen is 
very good. It would be nice to see 
the menu system integrated into 
the touchscreen interface, but 
toggling through the X-E3’s 
settings is pretty painless when 
combined with the rear joystick.
One area where there’s room for 
improvement is battery life. At 350 
shots per charge, it’s not bad for a 
mirrorless camera, but falls well

G
armin has been working for a 
long time to perfect the GPS 
sports watch and with the 
Fenix range it took a big step 
towards doing exactly that.
Now the Fenix 5X is here to bring 
that range to its pinnacle with 
onboard mapping, multi-sport 
tracking, smartphone notifications 
and much more. Has Garmin 
created that perfect watch it’s been 
working towards all these years?
Price and availability
Garmin has separated the Fenix 5 
range into three different models: 
the 5S is small, light and ideal for 
daily activity tracking at £499.99 
($599.99); the Fenix 5 takes the 
middle-ground is slightly bigger 
and has a slightly longer battery life 
and also costs £499.99 ($599.99); 
and there’s the Fenix 5X, which is 
the premium model, and is ideal for 
adventurers who want to be ready 
for anything. It costs a cool £629.99 
($699.99). It’s the 5X we’re looking 
at here – bear in mind if you see us 
moaning about its size or price,  
those other two options are there 
to solve the issue – just at the cost 
of sacrificing the onboard maps.
The Garmin Fenix 5X is a very 
attractive wrist adornment, that’s 
for sure. The exposed face screws, 
metal bezel and solid metallic 
buttons look gorgeous. The watch 
also feels premium-level weighty 
on the wrist – especially if you opt 
for the pricier metal strap.
That 51mm metallic strap is an 
issue though since it requires you 
to own the right tool or to go to a 
watch shop to have it adjusted to fit 
you. A hassle but something you 
only need do once, unless the 
watch is too successful in helping 
you lose weight.  Otherwise go for 
the silicone strap, since that allows 
for size variance easily and can 
always be swapped with a quick 
release mechanism.
Whichever model you opt for, the 
Fenix 5X comes with a slate grey 
finish and a sapphire-glass screen, 
the latter of which should mean a 
well-protected watch that won’t 
get easily scratched or damaged.
Specs and performance
Garmin often updates its software 
and since it also runs its own app 
store, there’s a constant stream of 
new software offerings available to 
help you do more with the watch.
Onboard sensors include – deep 
breath – GPS, GLONASS, optical 
heart rate (HR), barometric 
altimeter, compass, gyroscope, 
accelerometer and thermometer. 
All that adds up to a lot of data to 
power all sorts of apps.
You get your basics – such as 
running, cycling and swim tracking 
– but also golfing, stand-up paddle 
boarding, yoga and more. In real 
world use, though, we found the 
stand-up paddle boarding accurate 
for distance but the stroke count 
was way off, just to highlight a 
slight flaw in the mix.

A beast of an outdoor activity tracker
84  |  
  |  January 2018

Battery life on the Fenix 5X is one 
of the best of any wearable out 
there, especially one with this much 
data being collected. The official 
numbers say you get up to 20 
hours of use in full GPS mode and 
up to 35 hours in UltraTrac mode, 
which pings the GPS less regularly. 
This seems accurate – although we 
found that the battery lasted even 
longer in real-world use, suggesting 
that Garmin is being cautious with 
its battery life estimates.
As for general daily use, Garmin 
says the Fenix 5X will last for 12 
days between recharges and that 
again seems pretty accurate. Using 
the smartphone connection for 
notifications, daily activity tracking 
and training a few times a week for 
at least an hour, we found that the 
Fenix 5X still didn’t need charging 
after almost two weeks, which is 
pretty impressive when rival 
devices, such as the Apple Watch, 
only manage around a day’s usage.
Summary
This is one of the best GPS sports 
watches available right now. It’s 
rugged, well connected, covers lots 
of sports, includes colour maps and 
has brilliant battery life. Plus you 
can use this as a daily activity 
tracker without worry of damage 
thanks to that sapphire-glass 
screen and a water resistance rating 
of 100 metres. You’ll look good too, 
thanks to its chunky build. ■
There’s a lot to love about the 
Garmin Fenix 5X. It’s expensive, 
but ideal for outdoor adventures.
This is a symptom that affects 
many Garmin watches in the pool 
as well, with stroke counts and 
lengths often not accurately 
recorded, although overall 
workouts are well measured.
Where the Garmin Fenix 5X does 
perform well is with more outdoor 
pursuits, such as hill-climbing and 
hiking. Here the full-colour maps, 
auto climb data, storm alerts and 
points of interest (POI), plus back- 
to-start navigation all work well, 
although it’s not so great as it  
is with running.
This watch is like wearing a 
weight on your arm when out on a 
run, especially if you opt for the 
196g steel strap version. If you’re 
light, you could almost imagine 
running around in circles, thanks to 
having that weight on one arm. 
We’re being overly-dramatic, of 
course, but this weight does make 
the Fenix 5X fell less suited for 
running use, despite the fact that 
it’s a very capable run tracker, with  
details such as vertical oscillation, 
ground contact time, cadence and 
even lactate threshold all being 
measured out.
Day-to-day step tracking is 
accurate, and it also has a stab at 
calories, but the Fenix 5X can get 
annoying if you have sleeves and 
want to tuck it away. 
This main way to think about the 
Fenix 5X is: this is definitely 
designed as a fashion statement 
where being big is key, so if you like 
that then you’ll love this device.
Connectivity and battery
The Garmin Connect app lets you 
check out all your exercise data 
immediately on a connected phone 
or in more detail on a computer. 
The app, which is available on 
both Android and iOS, is easy to 
use and navigate, and offers 
in-depth charts that you can edit so 
you can see what you need – like 
your heart rate overlaid on hill 
height for example.
But since the Garmin Connect 
app covers all of the company’s 
wearables, you may find its 
interface cluttered. It’s possible to 
personalise the layout, but it takes 
time and effort. If that all proves too 
much for you then you can always 
export the GPX file for use in other 
platforms, such as MapMyRun or 
MyFitnessPal, if you’re already 
committed to using those.
For cyclists, Strava compatibility 
is built in with features such as 
beacon and live segments right 
there on the watch as you train. You 
can then set the watch so that it 
automatically uploads the data 
when you’re next on Wi-Fi.

MID-RANGE mobiles
While flagship phones grab the headlines, low- to mid-range 
handsets are more capable than ever. let’s see what’s on offer
3 Vodafone Smart N8
£80, www.vodafone.com
is an £80 phone really worth buying? 
You might be surprised. The Vodafone 
N8 includes a raft of features that belie 
its price – a capable rear-mounted 
fingerprint sensor, textured finish, 
13-megapixel rear and five-megapixel 
front cameras, 16Gb of storage and the 
same processor as the moto e4 Plus. The 
five-inch 720p screen makes the phone 
perfectly pocketable and it’s very light, 
by virtue of the plastic build and 
2,400mAh battery.
.
1 Honor 6A
£140, www.hihonor.com
The Honor 6A packs in features you 
previously only saw on much more 
expensive products. A metal body, large 
battery, capable camera and a 
Qualcomm 430 processor enable 
impressive performance, and 16Gb of 
onboard storage means you shouldn’t 
run short of space. A fingerprint reader 
and oleophobic screen coating are 
surprising omissions. The five-inch 
display makes the phone ideal for  
those who prefer a smaller device.
2 Moto E4 Plus
£140, www.motorola.co.uk
The moto e4 Plus stands out among the 
crowd for one main reason – its huge 
battery. The 5,000mAh cell enables the 
phone to run for days without charging. 
A front-mounted fingerprint sensor, 
metal back, 5.5-inch HD screen and 
Android 7.1 make it feel bang up to  
date, and the 3Gb RAm is particularly 
generous. The e4 Plus uses a mediatek 
processor, which is a compromise, but  
this smartphone’s overall performance  
is still more than acceptable.

£270, www.samsung.com
The samsung A3 2017 is the latest from 
the company’s low-range devices. 
Highlights include samsung’s own 
exynos 7870 processor and a 4.7-inch 
720p super AmoleD screen, offering 
contrasty blacks. elsewhere, it’s clear 
you’re paying for brand rather than specs 
– while the f/1.9 cameras are good, the 
2Gb of RAm and 16Gb of storage are 
distinctly average. 5GHz Wi-Fi is a nice 
inclusion and ANT+ is onboard for 
connecting to fitness gadgets. 
4 Alcatel Idol 5
£160, www.alcatel-mobile.com
The Alcatel idol 5 doesn’t feel like a 
budget phone. The metal body and 2.5D 
Dragontrail glass front are premium, with 
the front black slab uninterrupted thanks 
to the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. 
There is a 5.2-inch Full HD screen, 
powered by an octa-core processor with 
3Gb RAm. The rear f/2.0 camera has 
phase-detection autofocus and a 
dual-tone leD flash for low-light shots. 
The idol 5 also includes a gyroscope, vital 
for VR headset use.
5 Wileyfox Swift 2 X
£220, ww.wileyfox.com
The swift 2 X is a little more expensive 
yet it’s still from a largely unknown brand 
(although it’s frequently discounted at 
retail). What does your extra spend get 
you? Quite a lot. A very capable 
Qualcomm processor, 32Gb of storage 
(double what most offer at the low end), 
3Gb RAm, a Full HD 5.2-inch display, a 
3,010mAh battery with Quick Charge 3, 
and NFC with Android Pay. The swift 2 
X’s fit and finish are impeccable and 
software updates are frequent.

so long ago that buying a cheaper 
phone meant almost unbearable 
compromise – slow processors, poor 
screens, limited memory and shoddy 
cameras – but this no longer has to 
be the case. You see this not only in 
great-value phones from traditional 
device manufacturers, but also in 
new entrants who are doing a top 
job of challenging the bigger boys.

Chrome is an extendable and 
efficient app that deserves its 
place at the top of the web 
browser rankings. According to 
w3schools’ browser trend analysis 
its user base is only rising, even as 
Microsoft Edge’s install numbers 
1 Google Chrome
http://google.com/chrome
RATING
grow. Why? It’s cross-platform, 
incredibly stable, takes up the 
minimum of screen space, and is 
the nicest browser there is to use.
Its wide range of easily obtained 
and installed extensions mean you 
can really make it your own, and 
there’s support for parental 
controls and a huge range of 
tweaks and settings to ensure 
maximum efficiency.
But there are downsides, and 
potentially big ones. It’s among 
the heaviest browsers in terms of 
resource use, so it’s not brilliant on 
machines with limited RAM, and 
its performance doesn’t quite 
match up to some of its rivals in 
benchmarking terms. And with 
Google’s tentacles running all the 
way through it, you might be 
uncomfortable with the some of 
the ways in which your web 
browsing data may be used.
RATING
It’s sad that Opera makes up 
only around one percent of the 
browser market, since it really is a 
quality browser. It launches fast, 
the interface is brilliantly clean, 
and it does everything its rivals 
can do with a couple of extras 
thrown in for good measure.
The key reason we’d at least 
recommend having Opera 
installed alongside your main 
browser is its Opera Turbo feature. 
This compresses your web traffic, 
routing it through Opera’s servers, 
which makes a huge difference to 
browsing speed if you’re stuck on 
rural dial-up or your broadband 
connection is having a moment.
It reduces the amount of data 
transferred too, and re-routing 
dodges any content restrictions 
your ISP might place on your 
browsing. Opera automatically 
ducks out of the way if you’re 
using secure sites, so your traffic  
is free of privacy violations.
There’s also an ad-blocker, and  
a battery-saving mode for 
longer-lasting mobile browsing.
Chrome is a superb 
browser if you 
don’t mind Google 
handling all your 
online activity.

We all spend far too much time 
sitting in front of web browsers, 
and Vivaldi wants to make that as 
pleasant and as personal an 
experience as possible.
3 VIvaldi
https://vivaldi.com/
The whole style and structure of 
its interface is entirely up to you. 
There’s a built-in note-taking 
system, you can dock websites as 
side panels while using the main 
window to do your main 
browsing, and we love its 
innovative tab stacking tech, 
which enables you to group tabs 
and move them around to avoid 
the crowding that so often 
plagues other browsers.
Vivaldi is built on Chromium, 
which means you can expand it 
even further with extensions from 
the Chrome Web Store. Some 
extensions may behave slightly 
differently in Vivaldi, but most 
work perfectly well.
Vivaldi is a refreshing and 
creative take on web browsing, 
and is definitely one to watch in 
the next couple of years.
The Tor Browser is unjustly 
associated with the seedy 
underworld of the dark web. 
While it’s true that you can use 
this web browser to access

RATING
otherwise unlisted sites, Tor’s 
privacy aspects – where your 
traffic is routed through random 
nodes the world over, making it 
hard to track – are its real asset.
Tor Browser is really a package 
of tools; Tor itself – a modified 
version of the Firefox Extended 
Support release – and a number 
of other privacy packages that 
combine to make it the most 
secure browsing experience you’re 
likely to find. Nothing is tracked or, 
stored, and you can forget about 
bookmarks and cookies.
You’ll need to alter your 
browsing habits to ensure that 
you don’t perform actions online 
that reveal your identity – Tor 
Browser is just a tool, after all – 
but for those private browsing 
moments it’s a great choice.
RATING
Vivaldi is a 
relatively new 
browser that’s 
bound to see more 
development soon.
Based on Firefox, 
the Tor Browser
