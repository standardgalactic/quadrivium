Dedication
We would like to dedicate this book to Sandro and Viviana de Rosa, and
to Paola and Valerio Scoyni. Without their support, kindness, and wealth
of good ideas, it never would have been possible. We would also like to
thank our editor, Margot Weiss, who supported our work until the very
day she gave birth to her son, and to Leslie Shen, who took over and did
much to improve this book. A thank you also should go to Guy Ruggiero,
the cartographer, who did an excellent job with the maps.

Introduction
Year after year, Italy tops tourist destination lists. Year after year, we
keep having the times of our lives in spite of the crowds. Really. And
what’s not to like? The food is perfect, the people are welcoming and
friendly, the climate is pleasant, and there is art everywhere!
Modern tourism started back in the 18th century, when the literati 
and aristocrats bent on learning began traveling through Europe to
explore the ruins of ancient Greek and Roman sites as well as to admire
the rich artistic production of the Renaissance. In the 19th century,
Americans made taking the Grand Tour — the classic, months-long
European tour enjoyed by the rich and satirized by Mark Twain in The
Innocents Abroad — a rite of passage for the well-heeled. Anyone who
has seen a Merchant Ivory film (A Room with a View, for one) knows that
Italy was among the most popular stops on the Grand Tour. Today, the
country is still a huge destination for both cultural and religious pilgrim-
ages. Italy retains an almost mythical status in the minds of many for its
fantastic range of natural and cultural attractions. The “problem” with
visiting Italy is also this country’s major appeal: It’s totally saturated
with things to see and do (and eat and drink, too). The cultural renais-
sance initiated in the late 1990s has not yet given signs of abating. Old
attractions are being made more tourist-friendly and new ones are open-
ing up; brand-new hotels and restaurants are popping up throughout the
country; and English-speaking staff and signs are becoming more
common. Yes, things keep improving for tourists here, and we’re sure
you’ll have the time of your life traveling through Italy with us!
About This Book
With a history stretching from the dawn of time and artwork to match,
Italy definitely offers too much to see in one trip, unless you’re planning
a six-month-long visit. Fortunately, we’ve combed the country to find 
the best deals and things to see and do. Whether you’re a first-timer or
making a repeat visit to see sights you missed the first go-round, you’ll
find something for you in Italy For Dummies, 4th Edition.
Unlike some travel guides that read more like a phonebook-style direc-
tory listing everything and anything, this book cuts to the chase. It’s
designed so that you can quickly look up and immediately find the infor-
mation you need. This means that you don’t have to read the whole
thing from page one, but can open it at any point and delve into the 
subject at hand.

Conventions Used in This Book
The structure of this book is nonlinear: In other words, you can look up
just the things you’re interested in without having to read whole chap-
ters. To help you find information quickly and easily, we use a number of
visual signs (icons) positioned at the margin (see “Icons Used in This
Book,” later in this chapter).
We have included lists of hotels, restaurants, and attractions, and 
for each we provide our frank evaluation. Hotels are divided into two
categories — our personal favorites and those that don’t quite make our
preferred list but still get a hearty seal of approval. Don’t be shy about
considering these “runner-up” hotels if you’re unable to get a room at
one of our favorites, or if your preferences differ from ours — they are
still excellent choices with above-average amenities and services.
We use this series of abbreviations for credit cards in our hotel and
restaurant reviews:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
Note that Discover is not listed. The Discover Card is unknown in Italy,
so it’s a good idea to carry one or more of the big three — American
Express, Visa, or MasterCard.
We also include some general pricing information to help you decide
where to unpack your bags or grab a bite. We use a dollar-sign system 
to show the price range for one night in a hotel (in a double-occupancy
room) or a full meal at a restaurant (including pasta or appetizer, main
dish, side dish, and dessert, but no beverages). (Note that within the
restaurant listing info, we give you the price range of just the main
course, referred to as secondi.) See Chapter 8 for a detailed chart telling

Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you
plan or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-
try walking tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags included in this book
to help make your trip planning easier!

categories:

Up to 140€ ($168)
Up to 40€ ($48)

Prices are given in euro, followed by the U.S. dollar conversion; the
exchange rate used is 1€ = $1.20. Note, however, that establishments
can change prices without notice and exchange rates may vary.
Another thing you will find attached to each listing is contact informa-
tion. Web sites are listed whenever possible. As for telephone numbers,
don’t be surprised if you see % 0743-220320 right near % 055-290832.
The number of digits in Italian phone numbers is not standardized as it
is in the United States. Area codes can have 2, 3, or 4 digits; the rest of
the number can have as few as 4 or as many as 8 digits.
For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are plotted on a map,
a page reference is provided in the listing information. If a hotel, restau-
rant, or attraction is outside the city limits or in an out-of-the-way area,
it may not be mapped.
Foolish Assumptions
We’ve made some assumptions about you and what your needs may be
as a traveler. Here’s what we assume:
 You may be wondering whether to take a trip to Italy and how to
plan for it. You may be a first-time visitor to Italy.
 You may be an experienced traveler who doesn’t have a ton of time
to plan your trip or to spend in Italy after you get there. You want
expert advice on how to maximize your time and enjoy a hassle-
free trip.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides every bit of information
available about Italy. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses
on the places that will give you the best or most unique experience
in Italy.
If you fit any of these criteria, then Italy For Dummies, 4th Edition, pro-
vides the information you’re looking for!
Introduction 3

How This Book Is Organized
The book has eight parts, plus two appendixes. Each can be read inde-
pendently if you want to zero in on a particular area or issue.
Part I: Introducing Italy
The first part is where you’ll find in-depth information on Italy, from our
rundown of the best it has to offer (Chapter 1) to details on its history,
culture, people, architecture, and cuisine (Chapter 2). You’ll also find cli-
mate information and a calendar of special events (Chapter 3), plus our
suggested itineraries (Chapter 4).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy
Here we give you our best tips on trip planning: from budgeting — with
advice on where to save money and where not to (Chapter 5) — to figur-
ing out the best ways to get here from abroad (Chapter 6) and to travel
from one destination to another within Italy (Chapter 7). We also describe
hotel standards and practices (Chapter 8) and address the special con-
cerns of families, seniors, students, and gays and lesbians (Chapter 9). We
address all other necessary details — from getting your passport to think-
ing about your health — in Chapter 10.
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome
This eternally lively city, Italy’s capital, is as contemporary as it is ancient,
a living ruin still under construction. This section includes our best tips
on hotels and restaurants (Chapter 11), as well as a tour of this wonderful
maze of ancient and modern treasures (Chapter 12).
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria
Tuscany and Umbria are dotted with historic and picturesque towns.
Florence’s still brilliant Renaissance heritage (Chapter 13) often over-
shadows neighboring towns, such as Pisa and Lucca (Chapter 14), which
are also repositories of art and culture. You’ll find more of our Tuscan
and Umbrian picks in Chapter 15.
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana
You will fall for Venice’s mysterious and lovely villa-crowded islands that
seem to float upon the water. But to avoid the city’s pitfalls and stay
within your budget, follow our tips in Chapter 16. We explore the best of
the nearby Pianura Padana (including Verona and Milan) in Chapter 17.
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast
This corner of Italy is packed with diversity and contrast — as well as an
immense art endowment. Naples is a fascinating hive of activity as well as
a treasure-trove of history and art (Chapter 18). It is surrounded by some
Italy For Dummies, 4th Edition

of the world’s greatest archaeological areas: Pompeii, Herculaneum, and
the Campi Flegrei (Chapter 19). A short distance to the south is the splen-
did Sorrento Peninsula, with the mythical isle of Capri and the Amalfi
Coast (Chapter 20).
Part VII: Sicily
A stone’s throw from Africa and hundreds of miles from the Alps, the
island of Sicily seems at once most intensely “Italian” and strangely dif-
ferent. Nowhere is the mix of cultures more dazzling than in the region’s
capital, Palermo (Chapter 21). And in no place is the presence of the
past as ghostly as at the Greek temples of Agrigento, Selinunte, and
Segesta, or fascinating as in Taormina, Piazza Armerina, Catania, and
Syracuse (Chapter 22).
Part VIII: The Part of Tens
Here we’ve squeezed in some extra info we think you’ll find useful:
Italian expressions worth knowing (Chapter 23) and our favorite Italian
artists (Chapter 24).
Appendix A and B
Go to Appendix A to find Quick Concierge, an A-to-Z directory that gives
you the facts you need to know, such as how the telephone system works
and what to expect at Customs. We also provide a list of toll-free phone
numbers and Web sites for airlines, hotels, and car-rental agencies serving
Italy, plus sources for additional tourist information. In Appendix B, you’ll
find a glossary of useful architecture and menu terms.
Icons Used in This Book
As you have already seen, we use icons throughout this book as sign-
posts and flags for facts and information of a particular nature or inter-
est. Following are the five types of icons:
This icon highlights money-saving tips and/or great deals.
This icon highlights the best the destination has to offer in all 
categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, 
and nightlife.
This icon gives you a heads up on annoying or potentially dangerous sit-
uations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, rip-offs, and other
things to beware of.
This icon highlights places that are particularly hospitable to children or
people traveling with kids. In restaurant listings, it means highchairs and
mezza porzione (half portions) are on offer; in hotels, it indicates cribs,
Introduction 5

extra beds, or triples and quads are available. We also mention if other
amenities suitable for children — a play area, garden, pool, baby sitting —
are provided.
This icon points out useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule
your time.
Where to Go from Here
Now you can dig in wherever you want. The next chapter highlights the
best of Italy, from museums to hotels to intangibles (experiences you
may not want to miss). If you already have an itinerary in mind, you can
jump ahead to the ins and outs of finding a flight and making a budget;
or you can browse through city destinations you may want to visit. And
if you’ve already traveled to Italy once or a score of times, you are still
sure to find something here you haven’t seen.

Introducing Italy

In this part . . . 
T
his is where we get you excited about your trip before
you go and satisfy your curiosity about this Italian world
you have decided to discover. We will help you decide when
and exactly where to go. We’ll tell you what sort of weather 
to expect, where you are likely to have to deal with tourist
hordes, and where, instead, you can relax in relative solitude
off the beaten path. In this part, we sort through your options,
showing the advantages and drawbacks of each choice and
mentioning special considerations.
In Chapter 1, we highlight what we consider the best of Italy,
from churches to restaurants to travel experiences. In
Chapter 2, we give more information on Italy’s history and
culture, including the regional cuisine and local wines. In
Chapter 3, we describe the best seasons in which to travel
and also provide a calendar of the most important festivals
and events. Finally, in case you don’t want to plan your own
trip or are looking for some ideas, we list four great itineraries
in Chapter 4.

taly’s variety attracts all sorts of visitors. Art lovers flock to its great
museums and wonderfully decorated churches and palaces, the faith-
ful make pilgrimages to the Vatican, and gourmands devour its glorious
cuisines. In Italy For Dummies, 4th Edition, we give you our vision of the
best Italy has to offer. Here’s a taste of what’s ahead:
The Best Museums
Art in Italy is everywhere, but the museums, of course, enjoy the advan-
tage of high concentrations of artwork in one place. If your itinerary
takes you to any of the following cities, don’t miss the selections later —
even if you are not a serious museum-goer.
 You’ll need several days if you want to see the whole art collection
of the Vatican Museums in Rome. Not only does this include dozens
of rooms dedicated to painting and sculpture, but it’s also home to
the Sistine Chapel, decorated with Michelangelo’s frescoes — the
most famous artwork in all of Italy, and, after the Mona Lisa, proba-
bly the most famous single artwork in the world. Don’t forget your
binoculars. See Chapter 12.
 Also in Rome, the Galleria Borghese is smaller, but houses one of
the best art collections in the world. It’s known especially for its
Caravaggio paintings and breathtaking Bernini sculptures. See
Chapter 12.
 The National Roman Museum in Rome’s Palazzo Massimo alle
Terme holds an astounding collection of ancient Roman artifacts,
including unique mosaics and frescoes of rare beauty (entire rooms
of Roman villas are reconstructed!). See Chapter 12.

 Florence’s Galleria degli Uffizi is a required stop on any Italian itin-
erary for its superb pageant of Renaissance art. Only between the
covers of a book could you find so many Italian masterpieces in
one place. See Chapter 13.
 The Gallerie dell’Accademia in Venice houses the greatest collec-
tion of Venetian painting in the world, from the incandescent works
of Bellini to monumental pieces by Tintoretto and Veronese. See
Chapter 16.
 Often overlooked by tourists who go to Milan principally for the
excellent shopping, the Brera is a beautiful 17th-century palace
that contains the principal painting gallery in northern Italy. The
collection of the Pinacoteca stretches from the 15th to the 20th
century, including unique masterpieces. See Chapter 17.
 The Museo di Capodimonte houses its huge painting collection —
the best in southern Italy — in an enormous palace high above
Naples and surrounded by a beautiful park. See Chapter 18.
 The Archaeological Museum, also in Naples, is Italy’s foremost
museum of the art of antiquity. The splendid collection includes
treasures of Pompeii that were removed from the buried city for
safekeeping. See Chapter 18.
The Best Churches
Over the ages, churches in Italy have been decorated with the best
works of art and built according to the designs of the greatest architects.
Here are our absolute favorites from among the thousands of options.
 St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome is justly the most famous church in a
country filled with magnificent churches. Its majestic colonnade and
soaring dome create a symbol of Rome as well as of the Catholic
Church; inside are unique art treasures that include Michelangelo’s
Pietà. See Chapter 12.
 Among Italian churches, Florence’s Duomo, with Brunelleschi’s 
red-tiled dome soaring over it, is second in size only to St. Peter’s
Basilica. This architectural masterpiece is also known for its art-
works, bell tower, and the famous doors of the nearby baptistery.
See Chapter 13.
 Venice’s Basilica di San Marco is as dreamlike and magical as the
rest of the city. Decorated inside with 3,717 sq. m (40,000 sq. ft.) 
of gilded mosaics, it contains a host of marvels and has been the
focus of the piazza that bears its name since the 11th century. See
Chapter 16.
 The Duomo of Milan is a fabulous example of Italian Gothic archi-
tecture that took half a millennium to build. With its 135 towers, it
may look like a whimsical construction — and to some, it resem-
bles a sand castle. See Chapter 17.
Part I: Introducing Italy 
10

 The churches of Naples are many and splendid, but if you have time
for just one, make it the Duomo. It’s actually three churches in one,
from the paleo-Christian Santa Restituta (with the oldest western
baptistery in the world) to the late baroque Cappella di San Gennaro.
Don’t miss the splendid array of artwork here. See Chapter 18.
 The Duomo di Monreale, located on a hill dominating Palermo, is 
a 12th-century Romanesque church whose austere exterior makes
the 5,111 sq. m (55,000 sq. ft.) of Byzantine mosaics inside even
more awe-inspiring. See Chapter 21.
The Best Ruins and Archaeological Areas
Say “Italy,” and most people think of the ancient Romans. The country,
and especially its southern half, is chock-full of archaeological remains —
mostly Roman, but also Greek, including a number of the world’s best.
Here are our favorites.
 Rome’s symbol and most famous ruin, the Colosseum, is still majes-
tic even after centuries of decay. See for yourself where the Romans
watched “sports” (read: fights to the death). Nearby are the archaeo-
logical areas of the Roman Forum and the Palatine Hill, and of the
Imperial Forums; together they were the administrative and business
center of ancient Rome. See Chapter 12.
 In the small town of Verona lies a great Roman Amphitheater,
second only to the Colosseum in its state of preservation. Used as 
a performance hall for decades, it is still a living ruin, with a full
season of concerts and opera. See Chapter 17.
 Who hasn’t heard of Pompeii? The city — buried whole by Mount
Vesuvius’s A.D. 79 eruption — was an extremely wealthy resort
during Roman times, famous for the beauty of its abodes; its fres-
coes are among the best in the world. See Chapter 19.
 Less famous than Pompeii is Herculaneum, a smaller town also
buried by Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. It was a VIP resort in Roman
times and remains a superb archaeological site today; many houses
still have their second story preserved. See Chapter 19.
 The glorious Greek temples of Paestum lie out of the way — not far
from Salerno, south of the Amalfi Coast — and are therefore often
overlooked by tourists in a hurry. Try not to miss them if you’re in
the area. See Chapter 20.
 The Valley of the Temples at Agrigento in Sicily is the most dra-
matic archaeological site in Italy. A series of majestic Greek temples
dominated this city, which was founded in the sixth century B.C.
The ruins stand on their own in a dramatic, unspoiled landscape,
and include one of the largest temples of antiquity, the Temple of
Jupiter, which was over 30m (110 ft.) tall. See Chapter 22.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Italy 11

The Best Luxury Hotels
Okay, so maybe you can’t afford to stay in luxury hotels every night . . .
but if you want to splurge, then pick one of our favorite dream places for
a special night — it will be a cherished memory for the rest of your life.
 In Rome, the Hotel de Russie holds its own against all the competi-
tion, thanks to its incomparably romantic setting and unique style.
See Chapter 11.
 With its stylish yet welcoming interior and special children’s pro-
grams, the Hotel Savoy tops our list in Florence. See Chapter 13.
 The Brufani in Perugia is a rare gem, boasting old-fashioned charm
and courtesy coupled with modern amenities. See Chapter 15.
 Staying at the Cipriani and Palazzi on the Giudecca island in Venice
will let you experience the city’s grandeur in a manner that hasn’t
been topped since the 18th century. See Chapter 16.
 Housed in a former 15th-century convent, the Four Seasons hotel
in Milan will overwhelm you with its charm and its perfect location.
See Chapter 17.
 In Naples, the Grand Hotel Parker’s and the Grand Hotel Vesuvio
have very distinct personalities and so many fine qualities that
both have won us over. See Chapter 18.
 Capri is a dream island — and the Capri Palace in Anacapri is the
hotel to match, beginning with its ideal perch at the top of the
island. See Chapter 20.
 The Hotel San Pietro in Positano and the Palazzo Sasso in Ravello
are two jewels along the most beautiful stretch of coast in Italy,
each approaching perfection in its own way. See Chapter 20.
 Sicily has captured our hearts, and the San Domenico Palace and
the Grand Hotel Timeo in Taormina will take yours. A stay at either
hotel is a feast for the senses. See Chapter 22.
The Best Gourmet Restaurants
Italians take food very seriously. Dining in one of the country’s best
restaurants is like a near-mystical experience: Not only is the food
superlative, but nothing that surrounds you will be less than perfect,
from your chair down to your napkin. Foodie or not, you won’t eat in
one of the following restaurants every day — few people could afford to
do so — but do choose one of these places for a very special meal.
 For fantastic views over the Eternal City, with wonderful food to
match, try La Pergola. This elegant restaurant will be one of your
most romantic experiences in Rome. See Chapter 11.
Part I: Introducing Italy 
12

 Don’t miss Cibreo if you’re visiting Florence. The restaurant’s cre-
ative chef puts a unique spin on the best of Tuscan cuisine. You’ll
also get to taste a huge variety of the region’s best wines. See
Chapter 13.
 Hidden away from the main tourist haunts, yet within walking dis-
tance from San Polo, Osteria da Fiore in Venice is an address for
connoisseurs. Do not miss it if you want to discover the best of
Venetian cuisine. See Chapter 16.
 Whether you’re a fan of risotto or not, visit CraccoPeck in Milan.
Gourmands flock to this elegant restaurant just a few steps from
the Duomo, as it’s simply the best in the city. See Chapter 17.
 Il Desco in Verona is not only a great chef’s restaurant, but also a
very pleasant place where you’ll feel welcome and taken care of in
a wonderfully friendly way. Many foodies will tell you this is the
best restaurant in Italy. See Chapter 17.
 The San Pietro in Positano — inside the hotel of the same name —
is one of the best and most beautiful places to dine on this equally
beautiful stretch of coast. See Chapter 20.
The Best Travel Experiences
If you love Italy, it will reward you with your own unforgettable and
unpredictable experiences. Below is a small selection of our own
favorites.
 The Pantheon is the most perfectly preserved building of ancient
Rome. Built in 27 B.C., it was spared the looting that befell other
Roman structures because it had been turned into a Christian
church. It doesn’t feel like a church, however. From its soaring
dome (with a round opening through which you see the Roman
sky) to its marble pavement, it is a stunning, airy space where you
can literally walk through antiquity. See Chapter 12.
 Siena’s Palio delle Contrade is more than a horse race: It’s a
grudge match between the city’s neighborhoods that’s been going
on for hundreds of years. It’s still carried out with all the pomp, cer-
emony, and costumes of Renaissance Siena. The race (quite danger-
ous) is held in the main square of the town — which is filled with
dirt for the occasion. Imagine the Kentucky Derby being held in
Times Square. See Chapter 15.
 Taking a gondola ride through Venice may be expensive and
“touristy,” but — especially at dusk — it is an enchanting experi-
ence. You must see for yourself the water shimmering with reflec-
tions, the imposing yet whimsical Venetian architecture, and the
stillness and sheer unbelievability of it all. See Chapter 16.
 Crossing the Gulf of Naples coming from Capri or Sorrento, and
entering Naples at sunset, with Mount Vesuvio in the background

and the city’s lights starting to come up in front of you, is truly
magic: You’ll now understand the old adage, “See Naples and die.”
See Chapter 18.
 Walking the streets of Pompeii is an awe-inspiring experience.
Buried beneath volcanic ash by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in
A.D. 79, Pompeii was a flourishing Roman town caught in amber.
Even corpses were turned into human statues. See Chapter 19.
 The Teatro Greco-Romano (Greco-Roman Theater) at Taormina in
Sicily would be special enough as the best-preserved antique the-
ater in Italy, where plays were staged starting in the third century
B.C. But to see a play performed here today is truly amazing. See
Chapter 22.
The Best Traditional Italian Souvenirs
Although you wouldn’t expect to find “ethnic” gifts in Italy, there is a
small selection of high-quality handcrafted goods that have been tradi-
tionally produced in Italy for centuries. They make splendid gifts.
 The beautiful, extensive selection of marbled paper goods at Giulio
Giannini & Figlio in Florence are worth checking out; they make
perfect gifts and come in many price levels. See Chapter 13. You
can also find a large selection of marbleized paper at Piazzesi in
Venice. See Chapter 16.
 Invest in some Murano glass artwork or find smaller blown-glass
gift items. If it’s authentic Murano, then even the most inexpensive
item will appreciate in value. See Chapter 16.
 In Naples, select a set of hand-modeled figurines for the presepio
(crèche) for someone who will appreciate them, or start your own
collection. See Chapter 18.
 Make a gift of a beautiful cameo jewel, the finely carved coral or
shells that have been the pride of Torre del Greco (near Naples)
since antiquity. See Chapter 18.
 Check out the colorful hand-painted porcelain — dinnerware,
pitchers, tiles, vases — traditionally produced according to local
historical patterns in Deruta, near Perugia (see Chapter 15); in
Vietri, on the Costiera Amalfitana (see Chapter 20); and in the
Sicilian towns of Caltagirone, Santo Stefano, and Sciacca (see
Chapter 22).
 And, of course, take your pick of fashion accessories — scarves,
leather gloves, handbags, wallets, watches, sunglasses — from the
many local designers in Rome, Florence, Milan, Naples, Capri, and
Positano. See Chapters 12, 13, 17, 18, and 20.

taly became the tourist destination of choice in the 19th century, and
the first travel books on Italian culture made their appearance then.
Multifarious Italian culture has puzzled visitors for centuries; here we
have put together some highlights which we hope will help you enjoy a
richer traveling experience. 
History 101: The Main Events
If Mesopotamia is the cradle of civilization, then Italy is the cradle of
Western culture. In the ancient world, Italy was the center of an empire
that covered all of western Europe and much of northern Africa and the
Middle East. The Romans left behind towns, roads, and aqueducts which
are in large part still alive and used today. The principles of Roman (and
Greek) civilization are the bedrock of modern Western values and insti-
tutions. Summarizing Italy’s history in anything less than a book-length
study is bound to leave huge gaps, but here goes.
Around 1000 B.C., several peoples inhabited Italy, among them the
Villanova Italic tribe, which settled in the region of Rome, and the
Etruscans, a people probably originally from Asia Minor who were
famed for their seafaring, gold and metal work, and trading. The
Etruscans had already developed a sophisticated culture in Tuscany 
and Umbria when Rome was still a collection of shepherd’s huts and the
first Greek colonies were just putting in an appearance in the south of
the peninsula. As the Etruscans expanded southward, their culture 
had a huge impact on Rome — they gave the city its name, drained the
swamps, built sewers, and introduced writing. Near the beginning of the

Italian history at a glance
c. 1000 B.C.
Etruscans rule central Italy; they develop large towns and commercial
centers.
c. 800 B.C.
First Greek colonies established; southern Italy and Sicily become the
“Magna Grecia,” surpassing the mother country in wealth and success.
c. 509 B.C.
Last of the Etruscan kings overthrown in Rome: the Republic is born. It
will end with Julius Caesar’s tyranny (49–44 B.C.).
27 B.C.
Octavian Augustus crowned first Roman emperor. His reign will last 40
years and signal the beginning of the famous Pax Romana (“Roman
peace”), a 200-year period of stability ending with the death of Marcus
Aurelius in A.D.180. There is plenty of war during the “pax,” but Rome
brings the whole Mediterranean world under its administrative control.
A.D. 192
Assassination of Commodus and beginning of the decline of the empire.
A.D. 330
Emperor Constantine converts to Christianity and builds Constantinople.
A.D. 395
Roman Empire splits into eastern and western factions. Barbarians
threaten the borders and in A.D. 410 the Goths sack Rome. Other bar-
barian invasions follow.
A.D. 476
Western emperor Julius Nepos executed and the German warrior
Odoacer proclaimed king, effectively ending the Roman Empire. Starts
the Ostrogoth reign with capital in Ravenna.
A.D. 552
Narsete — the general of Justinian, emperor in Constantinople —
defeats Goths after a long war; he moves the capital back to Rome.
Starts the slow rise of the temporal power of the church.
6TH–8TH
Italy is divided between Longobards (ruling northern Italy, Tuscany, 
centuries A.D. and part of southern Italy) and Byzantines (ruling Sicily, Rome, and
some coastal towns such as Venice and Bari).
A.D. 756
“Donation of Pepin”: Pepin III (predecessor of Charlemagne) recog-
nizes the pope’s right to his own state and territory, in exchange for
being crowned king by the pope. The Vatican State formally begins.
A.D. 800
Charlemagne crowned emperor in St. Peter’s Basilica by Pope Leo III.
He establishes a kingdom of Italy as part of his new empire, but his
power on the peninsula is weak. The Byzantine resist.

Saracens (Muslim Turks) attack from their strongholds in southern Italy. 
centuries
Muslim Arabs colonize Sicily. Maritime republics — Amalfi, Pisa,
Genoa, and Venice — start gaining power.
1030
Normans take over southern Italy from Byzantines and Arabs; will rule
first Sicily and then the whole south of the peninsula up to Naples. Their
reign will pass to the Swebian dynasty in 1194, the Angevins in 1266,
and the Aragonese dynasty in 1442.

11th–13th 
Comuni — city-states — take over control in what had been the 
centuries
Longobard reign; the four maritime republics rule over the sea.
Commerce flourishes.
14th century Italian Renaissance begins: The culture of antiquity is rediscovered;
great achievements in the arts and ideas will then spread to the rest of
Europe. The city-states are well established. The papacy moves to
Avignon, France, in 1309; it will not be back until 1377.
1542
The Inquisition begins; Naples will be the only town in the Catholic
world to refuse it and resist.
1707
Austrian Hapsburgs take over the southern kingdom; they will have to
give it up to the Bourbons in 1734. They will keep northern Italy, how-
ever.
1798
Napoleon invades Italy, creating two republics; they will fall with him
in 1815. Papacy is restored in central Italy; Hapsburgs and Bourbons
share the rest of the peninsula.
1860
Garibaldi conquers southern Italy and pushes through the Marches
(belonging to the Holy See); the new Kingdom of Italy is proclaimed. The
Austrians are chased from Venice, their last stronghold in Italy, in 1866.
Rome is taken in 1870; it will be proclaimed capital of the kingdom in
1871.
1915–1918
Italy participates in World War I beside France and the United Kingdom;
650,000 Italians die.
1922
After the “march on Rome,” Benito Mussolini obtains from the king the
right to form a new government. He will rapidly transform it into a dic-
tatorship. The fascist era begins.
1929
The Vatican signs the Lateran Pacts, agreeing to relinquish all of Rome
except its churches and the territory of the Vatican. 
1940
Italy enters World War II on the side of Germany. 
1943
Allied troops land in Sicily, welcomed by the locals. The Italian king
signs the armistice and has Mussolini arrested. The Germans occupy
the country, countered by the population which, with the help of the
Allies, will free southern Italy up to Naples. Rome, occupied by the
Germans in spite of the resistance of Italian troops, is later heavily bom-
barded by the Allies. The Italian Resistance begins.
1944
Rome is liberated by the Allies on June 4. Milan will have to wait until
April 1945. The Italian Republic is officially established in 1946, after a
referendum decided against the monarchy. The new constitution is
signed in 1948.
1957
Italy is a cofounder of the European Community.

fifth century B.C., however, the local populations began striving for inde-
pendence. Weakened by their struggles with the Greeks who were colo-
nizing southern Italy, the Etruscans lost their power over Rome — and
the Roman Republic was subsequently founded in 509 B.C., when the last
of Rome’s kings was overthrown.
The Roman Republic was headed by two consuls and the senate, all
controlled by the upper or patrician (aristocratic) class. The plebeians
(working class) later obtained their own council and were represented
by tribunes. Rome’s power grew, and the city started gaining control
first over the Italian peninsula and then gradually over all western
Europe and the Mediterranean. Rome showed its might in decades of
bloody war against the city of Carthage, whose empire spread across
North Africa and into Spain. Known as the Punic Wars, these conflicts
began in 264 B.C. It took the Carthaginian general Hannibal six months to
make the famous march with his elephants over the Alps to attack the
Romans in 218 B.C., which marked the start of the Second Punic War. His
army inflicted crushing defeats on the Roman armies, but eventually the
Punic Wars ended with the Romans literally erasing Carthage from the
map in 146 B.C. The door was then open for Rome to spread its influence
across the Mediterranean. Although the Romans have been called the
“Prussians of the ancient world” for their militarism, they also strove to
bring civil peace and economic development. Rome ruled its provinces
through governors and allowed subject countries to retain their local
governments and customs — though betrayal of Rome was brutally
avenged. The republic became fantastically rich, and Hellenic and
Eastern art, wealth, and cultural influences flowed into Rome and Italy.
The end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire
arrived largely through the antagonism of two great generals, Pompey
and Julius Caesar, who became a tyrant after his defeat of Pompey.
Following Caesar’s murder on the Ides of March in 44 B.C., civil war
ensued and was won by Caesar’s grandnephew and adopted son,
Octavian, who became Rome’s first emperor, Caesar Augustus. His
regime began a period of peace and development and turned Rome into
a glowing marble city the likes of which the world had never seen. Rome
became the cultural beacon for an empire that extended from the
Caspian Sea to Scotland. Augustus was followed by a string of mostly
debauched and even insane rulers: Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius (a par-
tial exception, even though his third wife, Nero’s mother, was also his
niece), and Nero. However, in the second century, a string of “good”
emperors brought order, stable succession, and civility to the state.
They were Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and the philoso-
pher-emperor Marcus Aurelius. With the assassination of Commodus,
Marcus Aurelius’s son, in the year 192, the empire plunged once more
into chaos. A period beleaguered by war, plague, barbarian invasions,
and inflation spelled the beginning of the bitter end. 
When Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity and founded
Constantinople (today’s Istanbul) in A.D. 330, Rome’s wealth shifted east.
The western empire crumbled under barbarian pressure: The Goths
Part I: Introducing Italy 
18

sacked Rome in A.D. 410; the Huns came next under Attila, and were 
followed by the Vandals of North Africa. In A.D. 476, the German chief
Odoacer deposed the western Roman emperor, in effect signaling the
end of the once invincible Roman Empire.
Italy was fought over by the Goths, Byzantines, and Longobards. In 552,
the Byzantines chased the Goths from Rome and northern Italy, but their
power was weak and they could not resist the pressure of the Longobards,
who took over much of the peninsula except for Rome, Sicily, and some
coastal towns. 
As Rome became the seat of the Catholic church, Rome and Italy
became a pilgrimage site for believers from the whole Western world.
The French king Charlemagne tried to revive the western empire and, 
in A.D. 800, was crowned by the pope as the head of the Holy Roman
Empire. His power over the kingdom of Italy lasted only during his life-
time (city-states started developing right after his death), but the system
he established profoundly affected Italy’s history during the Middle Ages
and Renaissance. The German emperor was elected by the German
princes, but only the pope could crown him Holy Roman Emperor. For
the next 1,000 years, Italian politics were defined by the struggle among
the Holy Roman Emperor (who was German), the pope, Spain, and
France (aspiring to the imperial crown). 
In the 13th century, Italy was the crossroads of the Mediterranean. 
A banking and commercial culture was based on the great seafaring
empires of Venice and Genoa, as well as Amalfi, Pisa, and land-based
but powerful Florence; Milan and other smaller city-states dominated
the rest of Italy. This economic well-being and the circulation of ideas
generated by trade led to the beginning of the Renaissance in the 14th
century. This movement, which was to later inform all of Europe, was
above all the rediscovery of classical learning and culture, which in turn
led to an explosion of creativity, art, and exploration. The new philoso-
phy of humanism promoted the dignity and goodness of the human indi-
vidual and developing secularism, in contrast with the Middle Ages’
emphasis on human sinfulness and doctrinal orthodoxy. 
Only in the south and in Sicily, where the Normans (Viking descendants)
founded a kingdom in the 11th century, did medieval feudalism take
root. Later, the Spanish rulers used feudalism for their own political
aims and induced it to hang on — one of the causes of north–south cul-
tural and economic disparities that still persist. 
Especially starting in the 15th century, artists and scholars from all over
the Western world were drawn to Italy’s burgeoning centers of art and
learning, which disseminated a new way of thinking — humanism — to
the rest of Europe. Unfortunately, first the Inquisition, and then the
power struggle between Spain, France, and Germany, put an end to the
Renaissance. City-states like Florence and Siena sought the help of those
powerful larger states in their local wars, thus inviting foreign interven-
tion in Italy. The treaty of 1559 that acknowledged Spanish claims in Italy
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Italy 19

was the start of a 250-year decline. The mercantile empires and the city-
states waned, and between them the Spanish and the popes imposed a
reactionary and stultifying rule that was only relieved with the arrival of
Napoleon and revolutionary ideas. 
The end of the Napoleonic era brought back reactionary regimes, with
Austria dominating in northern Italy, and Spain in southern Italy, but the
Risorgimento (“resurgence”) began to gain momentum. Led by powerful
political figures such as Mazzini and Garibaldi, the movement worked for
the unification of Italy. Secret societies like the Carbonari were born.
The radical Giuseppe Mazzini favored an Italian republic, but unification
eventually came about by the creation of a liberal state formed around
the house of Savoy, rulers of Piedmont and Sardinia. The revolutionary
Giuseppe Garibaldi threw his weight and military genius behind the lib-
eral plan. After Garibaldi conquered the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies,
Umbria and Marche were annexed to Sardinia, and the Kingdom of 
Italy was proclaimed in 1861. Veneto was obtained in 1866 and Rome
finally wrested from Papal-French control in 1870, thus completing the
unification.
Between 1870 and World War I, Italy saw massive emigration to the United
States and Argentina. The country was tempted by territorial promises 
to join the Allies in 1915 (mainly in order to get Venice back from the
Austrians), and 650,000 Italians lost their lives. After World War I, discon-
tent and economic depression helped Mussolini rise to power. Mussolini’s
imperialist adventures abroad were matched by repression at home, and
his alliance with the Nazis was disastrous. Italians turned against him in
1943 and then continued in World War II on the Allied side while suffering
under German occupation.
Italy rebuilt itself after the war and became a modern democratic state.
It joined in the creation of the European Community in 1957 and has
been a promoter of European unification ever since. Today, unemploy-
ment is a persistent problem, and many Italians — even those engaged
in such professions as law, academics, and architecture — work for free
for years just to get a foot on the employment ladder. Corruption has
also been a nagging problem, but in the 1990s, a series of scandals and
dramatic trials of key Mafia leaders led to a major housecleaning and 
the proclamation of the “new Italy.” The country has received massive
influxes of immigrants and refugees in recent years, and the long-term
effects of these demographic changes are a great unknown.
Architecture: From Ruins to Rococo
Italy offers a compendium of architectural styles — Roman and Greek,
Romanesque, medieval, Gothic, Renaissance, baroque, rococo, futurist,
and contemporary. With its foot as far south as Africa and its head in the
Alps, the peninsula has been a corridor for influences passing back and
forth. This is perhaps most obvious in Sicily, with its mixture of Arab and
Part I: Introducing Italy 
20

Norman architecture, but almost any church or palace (especially those
like Milan’s Duomo, which took 500 years to build) will show traces of
more than one style.
Sicily’s temples at Segesta and Agrigento (the famous “valley of tem-
ples”) are examples of the architecture brought to Italy from Greece 
by colonists. These temples date from the fifth and sixth centuries B.C.
and display the Doric style (most easily spotted in the simple rectilinear 
capitals at the tops of columns). Roman architecture absorbed this early
style as well as later Greek developments, such as the Ionic capital (like
a scroll) and the Corinthian (the most ornate capital, decorated with a
profusion of leaves). The Colosseum in Rome demonstrates all three
styles or “orders.”
Byzantine style dominates the few examples of paleo-Christian architec-
ture left — mostly churches. Of the country’s Christian-era churches, the
earliest to be found are in the Romanesque style, which, as its name
suggests, drew inspiration from Roman architecture — particularly the
use of the arch. Some people find the Romanesque stolid and gloomy,
while to us it has an appealing simplicity (especially in comparison with
some later gaudy developments in church architecture) that makes it
our favorite architectural style. Spoleto has several Romanesque
churches, including its beautiful Duomo.
Influence from northern Europe brought to Italy the Gothic style, known
for its soaring towers and the flying buttresses that support the building.
Not surprisingly, Italy’s foremost example of Gothic architecture is in
Milan — its famous Duomo — while the style is little represented farther
south, and when used it is intermingled with other artistic influences,
such as in Rome’s only Gothic church, Santa Maria Sopra Minerva.
The architecture of Tuscany and Umbria is famous for its alternating
striations of colored marble — black, white, pink, or green. This charac-
teristic element can be found in churches considered Gothic, as in the
Duomo of Siena, but also in Renaissance masterpieces like the Duomo
of Florence. The Renaissance style stressed proportion and balance,
and avoided some of the higgledy-piggledy accretions that occurred in
Gothic churches built over hundreds of years. The classical orders were
also employed, with the Doric in the first story of the building, the Ionic
in the middle, and the Corinthian at the top. Michelangelo’s Palazzo
Farnese in Rome is a classic example of the Renaissance style, as is his
dome of St. Peter’s Basilica.
The Renaissance style evolved into baroque, a fuller and more ornate
style. The sweeping colonnade in front of St. Peter’s, designed by Bernini,
is a perfect example of this style. If baroque was an elaboration of the
Renaissance style, then rococo was overkill — the addition of all sorts of
baubles and flourishes to the underlying structure. Perhaps the best word
to describe rococo is “busy.” With its twisting columns and encrusting of
gold, Bernini’s baldacchino (a baldaquin or canopy) inside St. Peter’s
shows the baroque beginning to get out of hand.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Italy 21

As a bridge between east and west, Italy’s architecture shows at times a
deep Eastern influence, particularly on its eastern coast. Venice has a
style all its own, labeled Venetian Gothic, of which St. Mark’s Basilica
(Basilica di San Marco) is a gem. The onion domes and the ornate deco-
ration reflect a Byzantine influence; the exotic materials, including por-
phyry, gold, and jewels, came from across the Venetian empire. Sicily,
too, has its own style, which reflects Norman influence as well as
Eastern art and crafts imported during the period when the island was
ruled by Arabs (from their conquest in 831 until their defeat by the
Normans Robert Guiscard and Robert I in 1072). The Cappella Palatina
(Palatine Chapel) within the Palazzo Normanni is an astounding syn-
thesis of Byzantine mosaics, Islamic art, and an intricate ceiling that is a
masterpiece of Arab woodcarving. Later, the island developed its own
version of baroque, the Sicilian Barocco, a captivating and ornate style
that is found in many cities in Sicily and contrasts with the stark beauty
of Norman architecture in Palermo.
A Taste of Italy: Eating (and Drinking)
Locally
You are most certainly familiar with Italian cuisine, but you may not be
an expert in the structure of an Italian meal. Although ever-expanding
working hours have made it more difficult for Italians to enjoy their tra-
ditional pranzo (midday meal) every day, they indulge in it whenever
possible: during the week for business lunches, and on the weekend
with family and friends. A complete meal includes several courses and is
always accompanied by wine and water (usually bottles of mineral
sparkling and still). 
Part I: Introducing Italy 
22
Dress code
Italians tend to dress in attire that may look rather formal to American eyes (no shorts
and rarely jeans, even in the summer). This is true during the day, and even more so
in the evening. As a man, you may unpleasantly stick out if you’re wearing shorts and
a tank top, and you may not be able to have lunch except in the most informal eater-
ies. Shorts and tank tops (except for really stylish and elegant ones) are not a good
choice for women, either, although they may pass more easily. 
In Vatican territory — and that includes all of the churches and religious buildings in
Italy — both men and women will be refused access at the entrance unless they
cover up those shoulders and thighs. If you’re visiting in the summer, bring a silk
scarf or sweater for your shoulders, and wear a longer skirt or pants.

The meal starts with antipasti (appetizers), including a variety of cured
meats, vegetable tidbits, and seafood preparations, depending on the
region (see later in this section). Sometimes they are served buffet-style
and you can get up and choose what you want; otherwise, you can order
your own individual dish — not much fun — or go the Italian way and
ask your waiter to bring a selection for the number of people in your
party, definitely the most festive choice. 
The meal continues with the primo (first course), which can be a soup
(mostly served in fall and winter) or a rice or pasta dish. The pasta dish
is but another appetizer, and the real meal has yet to come. The secondo
(main course) is a meat or fish dish, which you may accompany with a
contorno (side dish) — but you’ll have to order that separately in tradi-
tional restaurants. Only in gourmet restaurants will the chef limit your
freedom and impose a specific association of flavors of his choice, serv-
ing a meat or fish preparation with a particular side dish. In most other
places, you’ll be able to choose from among a variety of potatoes (usually
oven-roasted or french fries) and vegetables (usually cooked leafy
greens, green beans, or salad).
It is nowadays quite acceptable to stop at your first course and skip the
secondo, or to skip the primo and go straight for the main course. A lot
of Italians will do the same, particularly during an ordinary lunch at a
local trattoria. However, if you are in a formal restaurant and not every-
body in your party chooses to do the same, you’ll have to specify to the
waiter that you want all the dishes brought to the table together, other-
wise he will wait for everybody who has ordered a first course to finish
before bringing in the secondi.
To finish, you can have cheese and/or dessert. This includes dolce —
cake, pastry, or pudding — or fresh fruit (when in season, strawberries
with whipped cream are very popular with locals). You can then top it
all with caffè (coffee) and amaro (bitter digestif liqueur).
The cena (evening meal) was traditionally a less elaborate meal, cen-
tered on soup, cured meats, cheese, and vegetable dishes. For many
working people, this has become the only meal at which the whole
family is together, and therefore it has taken up many of the elements of
the pranzo. However, most people will have a full meal only when they
go out for a special dinner; otherwise, they’ll choose to have a simpler
meal at an informal restaurant.
What Italians call a ristorante is a formal kind of restaurant, with proper
tablecloths and elegant settings, and always serving a full menu of
regional and Italian specialties. You’ll also find a full menu in a more
casual trattoria or osteria, but these are usually smaller, family-run
establishments that serve hearty and less elaborate local dishes.
Whether you’re at a ristorante, trattoria, or osteria, you’ll still be able to
have the traditional pranzo, at either lunch or dinner. 
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Italy 23

You can have a faster and cheaper meal in a pizzeria, a sit-down eatery
specializing in pizza; these usually serve individual round pizzas and a
limited choice of antipasti. Sometimes you’ll find a restaurant that dou-
bles as a pizzeria, in which case it will have both a regular menu and a
pizza menu. Pizza is still usually considered evening fare, but thanks to
an increasing demand, more and more restaurants are offering pizza for
lunch as well. The typical pizzeria antipasti differ somewhat from the
choices offered in other types of restaurants: You’ll find a variety of
deep-fried items, such as filetto di baccalà (a piece of deep-fried cod),
bruschetta (a slice of hearty bread topped with chopped tomatoes and
olive oil), potato croquettes, and suppli or arancini (balls of seasoned rice
filled with cheese or meat and deep-fried). The pizzas themselves come
with a variety of pre-established toppings; most of these combinations
are rooted in long-standing tradition, such as the margherita (tomato,
mozzarella, and basil); napoletana or romana (tomato, mozzarella, and
anchovies); capricciosa (tomato, mozzarella, mushrooms, artichoke
hearts, olives, ham, and half a boiled egg); funghi (mushrooms, tomato,
and mozzarella); rugola, bresaola, e parmigiano (fresh arugula and thin
slices of cured beef and Parmesan cheese, with a simple tomato sauce);
quattro formaggi (four kinds of cheese); broccoletti e salsicce (broccoli
rabe and Italian sausages); and so on.
Not even considered a proper restaurant by locals, a rosticceria or
tavola calda is a sort of cafeteria with pre-prepared hot dishes behind 
a glass counter and, often, roasting chickens in the window. These are
excellent places for a quick meal on the go. If you’re even more pressed
for time, we recommend snacking at one of the ubiquitous pizza coun-
ters that offer pizzas by the weight; these also sell soda, water, and
sometimes beer, but usually don’t have a seating area. 
An Italian bar shares some of the features of a cafe: At lunchtime, bars
prepare a large variety of sandwiches (filled with egg, tomatoes, cheese,
and cured meats) and tramezzino (slices of crustless American-style
bread filled with a variety of mayo-based salads). Some bars have a full
kitchen and will prepare basic dishes. You can enjoy your lunch standing
at the counter, Italian-style. If you prefer to eat at a table, you’ll have to
first sit and then order, as the menu is often different and more extensive
(and a surcharge applies for table dining). Bars offer a full range of
refreshments, from cappuccino to wine, soda to ice cream. You can easily
recognize a good bar by taking a look at its glass counter: The best
places prepare their own food with top-quality ingredients, and buy their
bread and pastries from a reputable forno (bakery) in the vicinity.
Dining hours in Italy are later than in the United States. Italians sit down
to dinner between 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.; lunch is between 1 and 3 p.m.
Most restaurants open around noon for lunch and 7:30 p.m. for dinner. 
In our restaurant reviews throughout this book, we provide opening and
closing times that refer to the kitchen’s hours — basically, the times
you’re allowed to place your order. Few restaurants will keep the kitchen
open past 11:30 p.m. in the city and 10 p.m. in the countryside, and only
a minority will open any earlier than 7:30 p.m. 
Part I: Introducing Italy 
24

While a 10 to 15 percent charge for servizio (service) is usually included
in the price of each dish (this will be specified on the menu; if it’s not,
that means the service will be added to your bill), an extra 5 to 10 per-
cent is expected for good service. Also, some restaurants still charge a
pane e coperto (bread and table) fee, calculated per person. This
charge tends to vary depending on the elegance of the restaurant and its
location (moderate and rarely assessed in Rome, it is steep and ubiqui-
tous in Venice); it ranges between 1€ and 6€ ($1.20–$7.20) throughout
the country. 
Italian cuisine is really quite different from region to region, as you’ll see
later in our quick overview. Be adventurous, try the local specialties
when you can, and no matter where you are, don’t miss the local wines
unless you’re a teetotaler.
Relishing Roman cuisine
Traditional Roman cuisine is based on simple food, “poor people” fare. 
It may be unsophisticated, but we just love it. Among the primi, our
favorite Roman specialty is pasta all’amatriciana (a tomato-and-bacon
sauce with pecorino cheese) and its tomatoless relative, gricia. We also
like pasta all’arrabbiata (tomato sauce with lots of hot red pepper); gnoc-
chi (potato dumplings in a tomato-based sauce), traditionally served on
Thursdays only; and cannelloni (pasta tubes filled with meat or fish and
baked). Ricotta and spinach ravioli are often excellent as well. Our
favorite secondi are abbacchio (young lamb) roasted with herbs or scotta-
dito (small grilled cutlets), as well as saltimbocca alla romana (veal or
beef stuffed with ham and sage and sautéed in a Marsala sauce). For 
the more adventurous, there is trippa alla romana (tripe Roman style).
Desserts are few, mostly gelato (rich, creamy ice cream), creamy
zabaglione (made with sugar, egg yolks, and Marsala wine), or tiramisù
(layers of mascarpone cheese and espresso-soaked ladyfingers).

The etiquette of drinking
Don’t expect to order a martini before dinner. In many restaurants, and more particu-
larly in trattorie, osterie, and pizzerie, you probably won’t find a full bar, as Italians
simply don’t drink liquor right before dinner. The widespread aperitivo is always taken
at a bar before going to a restaurant, and is always accompanied by small tidbits of
tasty food. If you make a bar your first stop, you can soak up the festive aperitivo ambi-
ence and also try the bittersweet aperitivo cocktail or non-alcoholic beverage Italians
favor. They tend to drink wine during dinner and reserve liquor for the end of the meal,
when they’re likely to have a grappa (a clear brandy) or an amaro (a 60- to 80-proof
bitter drink, made with herbs).

The best-known wines of Rome come from the nearby Castelli Romani, the
hill towns to the east of the city. Our favorites are the white Frascati —
very dry and treacherously refreshing — and the red Velletri.
Tasting Tuscany
Much as they hate to admit it, many Italians from other regions have to
agree that the best Italian cuisine is to be found in Tuscany. (We don’t
have to tell you what Tuscans themselves say.) Many of the traditional
dishes are farm-country recipes based on plenty of fresh vegetables and
game, though others were refined creations for the Florentine sover-
eigns. We love to start our meal with crostini (toasted bread with savory
toppings, including a sort of delicious pâté). Among the cold cuts are
finocchiona, a fennel-flavored salami famous all over Italy. In winter, we
never miss the thick traditional soup ribollita, made of black cabbage,
bread, and vegetables. When in Siena, we always have some pici (hand-
rolled spaghetti usually prepared with bread crumbs and tomato sauce).
Another of our favorites is pappardelle al sugo di lepre (large fettuccine
with hare sauce) or al cinghiale (wild-boar sauce). The best secondo
of all — but it has to be the real thing from the Chianina cow (a breed
raised only in the Tuscan countryside and blessed with especially delec-
table meat) — is the Fiorentina, a thick steak that will shame any
American Westerner. One contorno not to miss is fagioli all’uccelletto
(white Tuscan beans in a light tomato sauce). To end the meal, we like
the simple cantucci col vin santo (hazelnut biscotti served with a glass 
of local sweet wine) and the delicious Panforte — a typical Christmas
dessert that can be bought year-round in Siena, where it was invented. 
Nearby Umbria has a cuisine similar to that of Tuscany, with one major
difference: truffles. These come in white and black varieties; the former,
which has a milder flavor, is the most coveted. 
Farther afield, the cuisine of the Cinque Terre is highlighted by lots of
fresh fish. Pesto sauce, now famous around the world, originated in the
Cinque Terre. Another local specialty is zuppa di pesce, a savory, brothy
fish stew.

Smoking
Italy recently instituted one of Europe’s toughest laws against smoking in public places.
All restaurants and bars are affected by this ruling, except those with ventilated smok-
ing rooms. Only about 10 percent of Italian restaurants currently have these separate
smoking areas. It is just as difficult to find a bar where you can smoke; only the larger
places will have separate smoking areas. If smoking is important to you, call the
restaurant or bar ahead of time to make sure it has a smoking area. In good weather,
you will always be able to smoke on the outdoor terraces of restaurants and bars,
where the law does not apply.

Chianti is perhaps the best-known Tuscan red, and is often served as
table wine — even on tap, from huge casks — in Tuscan restaurants. The
red Vino Nobile di Montepulciano and Brunello di Montalcino are among
Italy’s greatest wines. For a white, try Vernaccia di San Gimignano; for a
dessert wine, opt for the famous vin santo.
Visiting Venetian and Milanese eateries
In Venice, fish and shellfish served on rice, pasta, or polenta (cooked
cornmeal) are the staples of the local cuisine. Our favorite antipasti are
sarde in saor (sardines in a sauce of vinegar, onions, and pine nuts) and
baccalà mantegato (creamed codfish served cold). Among the primi, risi
e bisi (rice and peas) and bigoli in salsa (whole-wheat spaghetti with
anchovy-and-onion sauce) get our approval, while for secondo, we enjoy
the famous fegato alla veneziana (liver sautéed with onions and wine).
Pastry shops have a variety of local cakes as well as the famous Bussolai
and S e’ Buranei — O- and S-shaped cookies, respectively, originally from
the small island of Burano.
In Milan, you’ll find all kinds of restaurants, but we enjoy a couple of well-
rounded traditional dishes: Risotto (creamy Italian rice cooked with fish or
vegetables) was invented here, and the risotto alla Milanese (with saffron
and beef marrow) is delectable when well prepared. For secondo, try the
cotoletta alla Milanese, a tender deep-fried cutlet reminiscent of Wiener
schnitzel and probably a remnant of the Hapsburg domination in the area. 
Some of the best wines in Italy come from the Venetian countryside; we
love Amarone and Valpolicella — earthy reds that can take the chill out
of the damp weather in winter. If you prefer whites, there’s Cartizze . . .
but we love prosecco, a fizzy wine that we even prefer to champagne.
Gnawing Neapolitan delicacies
Naples is justly famous for pizza — Neapolitans claim it as their inven-
tion and indeed are masters at preparing it. But the local cuisine has a
lot more to offer than just pizza, and although we really appreciate a
good Tuscan meal, we are quite partial to Neapolitan cuisine. The fact
that we love seafood probably has a lot to do with it, so if you don’t, you
may not share our excitement. Our favorite appetizer is impepata di
cozze (mussels steamed in light broth with lots of pepper) or a caprese
salad made with the famous mozzarella di bufala (buffalo mozzarella).
Our absolute favorite primo is scialatielli ai frutti di mare (local home-
made pasta with mussels and other seafood). For secondo, go for fresh
fish all’acquapazza (poached in a light herbed broth) or the famous
polpi al coccio (stewed octopus in a tomato sauce). Naples is also a great
place for those with a sweet tooth; the babá is the typical pastry, a soft
brioche soaked in rum and sugary syrup, served with a dollop of pastry
cream. For breakfast, you absolutely have to try the local specialty:
sfogliatella, a fragrant, crisp, crusty triangular pocket filled with sweet
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Italy 27

ricotta. It’s the perfect accompaniment to a Neapolitan coffee — another
area of acknowledged superiority. 
Naples is famous for the Lachrymae Christi (Tears of Christ), a wine
made from grapes grown on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, hence pro-
duced only in small quantities.
Savoring Sicily
When it comes to cooking (as in so many other things), Sicily is in a
class by itself. The Sicilians perfected multiculturalism centuries ago.
Here you’ll find the most unique combinations — such as Italian-looking
pasta served with pistachio nuts and North African spices. And because
Sicily is an island, its cuisine is highlighted by tastes from the sea.
Typical dishes are pasta con le sarde (pasta with shredded fresh sar-
dines), caponata (cubed eggplant with other vegetables, spiced and
sautéed), tonno con aglio e menta (fresh tuna with garlic and mint), and
fish dishes with finocchietto (small fresh fennel). If you want only a sand-
wich, go for the typical Palermo focacce. It can be filled with anything,
from the excellent caciocavallo (typical cheese) to fried spleen — yes,
spleen, plus a little lung to round things out. Less adventurous “fast
food” includes arancini (deep-fried flavored rice balls) and panelle
(chickpea fritters). Keep in mind that Sicilians really excel at desserts
and pastries. Cassata is a fabulous creation: ricotta mixed with sugar and
candied fruit, then covered with a layer of cake and finally almond paste.
Local gelato is heavenly — we quickly adopted the local custom of
having it for breakfast, as the filling of a soft brioche, and accompanied
by a small cup of excellent espresso. Some people even say that gelato
was invented in Palermo; we nod and keep eating it. Another local spe-
cialty is granita (frozen coffee or lemon ice — or, best of all, almond ice).

Word to the wise
Italian is the general language spoken in Italy; however, if you know a bit of it, or if
your ear is particularly good, you’ll notice that people speak differently in different
parts of Italy. Local dialects, now mostly used in the countryside, add local color but
can also make things difficult for a beginner. If necessary, resort to the universal
backup language: sign language. In Italy, hands talk — both to emphasize words and
to convey further meaning. If you don’t speak any Italian at all, most Italians will still
go out of their way to try to understand you and help you out, and signs can be of great
help. Also check out our glossary of Italian words (see Appendix B) and our list of what
we deem the ten most useful expressions (see Chapter 23). If you’re more adventur-
ous, devote some time to Italian For Dummies and you’ll soon become a pro.

Sicilian wines tend to be red and strong. There is a large variety; you
may be familiar with the Corvo di Salaparuta, which is quite good. Our
favorite is Nero d’Avola.
Background Check: Recommended 
Books and Movies
The number of books and films about Italy is staggering. Whether you
want to bone up on history or be entertained by sights of the Eternal
City, here are a few surefire favorites.
True stories
 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was the first great modern literary
visitor to Italy, and his wonderful Italian Journey (1816; reprinted
by Penguin Books, 1992) recounts his travels there.
 American novelist Henry James lived most of his life in Europe.
Some of his essays on art and culture are collected in Italian
Hours (1907; reprinted by Penguin Books, 1995) — the pieces on
Venice are particularly good.
 D. H. Lawrence wrote several books about Italy, including The Sea
and Sardinia (1921) and Etruscan Places (1927); a selected edi-
tion, D. H. Lawrence and Italy, has been published by Penguin
(1997).
 If you read 25 pages a day, it’ll take you only about four months to
get through Edward Gibbon’s History of the Decline and Fall of
the Roman Empire (begun in 1776), a monument of English prose.
(You can find a less monumental Penguin abridged version [1983]
in paperback.)
 Robert Graves wrote two novels — I, Claudius (1934; reprinted 
by Vintage Books, 1989) and its sequel, Claudius the God (1934;
reprinted by Penguin Books, 1989) — about the best of Augustus’s
Claudian successors.
 Italian Giorgio Vasari was a painter, architect, and (literally)
Renaissance man. His Lives of the Most Eminent Painters and
Sculptors (1550; expanded 1568) has been criticized for inaccu-
racy, but is still full of interesting information about the great
painters of the Renaissance. The Oxford edition (1998) is one of 
the many abridgements in translation of this huge work.
 Benvenuto Cellini’s famous Autobiography (published 1728;
translation reprinted by Penguin, 1999) presents a vivid picture 
of Cellini’s time in Renaissance Florence.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Italy 29

Works of fiction
 Ignazio Silone was an important socialist writer who had to go into
exile during Mussolini’s reign. Bread and Wine (Pane e vino, 1937;
translated by New American Library, 1988) is a vivid novel set
during the fascist period — a modern classic.
 Giuseppe Lampedusa (actually Giuseppe Tomasi, prince of
Lampedusa) wrote a single masterpiece, The Leopard (Il Gattopardo,
1958; translasted by Pantheon, 1991), about the effect on a noble
Sicilian family of Garibaldi’s invasion and the war of unification.
 Alberto Moravia, one of the great Italian writers of the 20th cen-
tury, wrote many novels and short stories, but none as famous as
The Conformist (Il Conformista, 1951; translated by Steerforth
Press, 1999), a study of the fascist personality.
 Sicilian novelist Leonardo Sciascia wrote books that subtly peel
apart the Mafia culture, layer by layer. Among the best of his works
is The Day of the Owl (Il Giorno della Civetta, 1961; translated by
New York Review of Books, 2003).
 Alessandro Manzoni wrote I Promessi Sposi (The Betrothed,
1825–27; translated by Penguin, 1984), considered one of the great-
est works of fiction in any language. It’s a sweeping romantic novel
set in 17th-century Italy.
The moving image
The neorealist film director Luchino Visconti made an epic movie of
Lampedusa’s The Leopard. Also by Visconti is The Earth Trembles
(Terra Trema, 1948), a version of Verga’s I Malavoglia. Bernardo
Bertolucci made a haunting and chilling classic out of Moravia’s The
Conformist in 1970.
Over the last dozen years or so, Italy has been the subject or the setting
of several hit films. It all began with A Room with a View (1985), based
on E. M. Forster’s novel and containing beautiful scenes of Florence.
Enchanted April (1992) is a sometimes schmaltzy but irresistible movie
about a group of Londoners leaving the drizzle and fog of home for a
sunny Italian villa. The Postman (Il Postino, 1994), an instant cult classic,
concerns the encounter of the ordinary man of the title with the extraor-
dinary personality of the poet Pablo Neruda, living in exile in Italy. The
Oscar-winning Life Is Beautiful (1997), by Italy’s current leading comic
actor, Roberto Benigni, is set during World War II and moves from
Tuscany to a German concentration camp. The comedy Mediterraneo
(1991), also set during World War II, deals with what happens when a
group of Italian soldiers are sent to garrison a lovely Greek island.
Somewhat stereotypically, their Italian love of life wins out over their mis-
sion. At the opposite end of the spectrum is Nanni Moretti’s The Son’s
Room (2001), about the death of a child — a film so powerful that it is
perhaps the only movie ever to be given an R rating for being so sad.
Part I: Introducing Italy 
30

We have to mention one of the great oldies, Roman Holiday (1953), the
Gregory Peck/Audrey Hepburn romance that is said to have caused a
surge in tourism to Rome. Another hugely popular film of the same era is
Spartacus (1960), the Oscar-winning Kirk Douglas movie about a slave
revolt in ancient Rome (we can’t vouch for its historical accuracy). It
was a precursor to Russell Crowe’s Gladiator (2000), which also gives a
visceral feel for the brutality of the empire at its worst.

eneath the modernization and globalization Italy has undergone
since the 1990s, the same proud traditions live on. In a country
where you can’t even count the number of political parties on both
hands and feet, diversity is not in danger. Centuries-old traditions of
independent thinking are what give Italy its unique flavors, voices, and
places. Selecting your destinations from among these riches is an inspir-
ing challenge. In this chapter, you’ll find our best tips and suggestions 
to help guide you through Italy’s maze of attractions and distractions,
cuisines and subcultures.
Going Everywhere You Want to Be
Every region of Italy offers eye-popping sights as well as places to spend
quiet moments. The following overview of Italy’s best attractions by
region will help you narrow down the destinations on your itinerary,
whether this is your first trip or your fifth.
Roaming Rome
Rome is still the capital of Italy, as it was in ancient times. As the site of
the Holy See, it was central to European culture for many centuries after
the end of the Roman Empire — hence its unparalleled saturation of
world-famous sights: the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, St. Peter’s
Basilica and the Vatican Museums, and the Galleria Borghese, to name
a few. There are even sights underground, like the Catacombs, while new
archaeological sites are continually being opened, such as the Domus
Aurea, the “golden house” of Nero. As a major modern city, Rome also
offers a varied and exciting nightlife, a huge selection of restaurants,
plentiful and comfortable hotels, and world-famous shops. It has so

much to see and do, visitors could spend months here and still find new
things to savor and explore every day.
Because of its size and energy, Rome can be quite overwhelming. You
will not be able to enjoy it very much unless you’re able to devote a few
days here. See Part III for coverage of Rome.
Exploring Florence and the best 
of Tuscany and Umbria
Tuscany has been the number-one tourist destination in Italy for decades
now, thanks to its lush countryside (where most people would love to
own a villa) and numerous art attractions. Florence, with its beautiful
Duomo (Cathedral) and museums overflowing with art treasures — the
Galleria degli Uffizi foremost among them — is one of the finest cultural
cities in the world. Florence’s fame tends to overshadow its many neigh-
boring towns, which are art gems in themselves and well worth a trip. We
love Pistoia and Prato, for example — much lesser known, yet each only
half an hour from Florence by public transportation; Lucca is another
medieval and Renaissance jewel nearby. All these towns make excellent
day trips from Florence.
Many are the other towns we love in both Tuscany and nearby Umbria,
starting with Pisa, with its world-famous Leaning Tower (the whole
complex, with the Duomo and the Camposanto, is so strikingly beautiful
on a sunny day that you will not regret your visit). Two other personal
favorites are medieval Siena, with its rusty-brick color and the exciting
Palio delle Contrade (the horse race that occurs twice a year in the
summer), as well as Perugia, the medieval capital of Umbria. Once you
are in Umbria, you should not miss Assisi — with its famous frescoes by
Giotto celebrating the life of St. Francis (dazzling in spite of the earth-
quake damage) — and Spoleto, with its charming medieval architecture
and imposing fortress, not to mention its lively music-and-arts festival of
international renown. If you have time, you certainly should visit the
perfectly preserved medieval San Gimignano, with its soaring towers;
and the Chianti, with its unique landscape of sweet hills dotted with
vineyards, where you can taste delicious food and wine.
A little farther afield (actually located in the neighboring region of
Liguria) is the park of the Cinque Terre, a preserved nature paradise
where time seems to have stopped. It is named after the five tiny fish-
ing/farming villages nestled along a stretch of coast that rivals the more
famous Amalfi Coast in steepness and natural beauty. See Part IV for
more on Tuscany and Umbria.
Viewing Venice and the Pianura Padana
Many artists and writers have been utterly smitten by La Serenissima
(the Serene Republic), as this city called itself when it was an independ-
ent state — and we haven’t been immune to its charms, either. If you
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 33

have only one day in Italy, we recommend you spend it in Venice, which
promotes dreaming like no other place. In a country lush with one-of-a-
kind sights, Venice is truly in a class by itself. In addition to its glorious
cultural attractions — the Doge’s Palace, St. Mark’s Basilica, Piazza San
Marco, the Gallerie dell’Accademia — the whole town is magical, with
its narrow streets and romantic canals.
The surrounding region, the Pianura Padana, is dotted with smaller
towns, which, although they cannot compete with Venice, make very
good rivals to other tourist destinations in Italy. Verona tops our list for
both its romantic culture — Romeo and Juliet lived out their tragic affair
here (supposedly) — and its architecture. Padua is a close second,
thanks to its charming Renaissance architecture and Giotto’s most cele-
brated frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel. Milan may not be our favorite
city in the world, but its attractions are first-rate: We absolutely love the
Duomo and the Brera. See Part V for coverage of Venice and the Pianura
Padana.
Visiting Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast
Naples, and its surrounding region, has been one of our favorite destina-
tions in Italy for a long time, so we’re very happy that it is now receiving
growing international attention. The city’s huge collection of art treas-
ures (the Archaeological Museum, the Museo di Capodimonte, the
Duomo, the Palazzo Reale, the Castel Nuovo, Santa Chiara, and
Sant’Anna dei Lombardi, to mention a few) and the breathtaking natu-
ral beauty of its nearby coast are enough to delight anybody for days on
end. Back in the 18th century, foreign visitors spent far more time in
Naples and its surroundings than in Florence and Tuscany, but decades
of neglect, corruption, and crime had obscured its attractions. Luckily, a
steady program of renovations and updates began in the 1990s, and
Naples is now coming back.
A short distance from Naples are two of the world’s most famous archae-
ological sites, the Roman cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii, wiped out
by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Basically in the suburbs of
Naples is the Campi Flegrei, a protected area rich in ancient Roman and
Greek sites. Farther south are the mythical Sorrento peninsula and the
Amalfi Coast, much more beautiful that any postcard could ever reveal.
The Amalfi Coast’s famous resorts include Positano and Amalfi, both
nestled along plunging cliffs. And Capri, the VIPs’ and Hollywood stars’
island getaway, is a green hill that rises steeply from the sea. See Part VI
for more on Naples and environs.
Seeing Sicily
The farther south you go, the more intense Italy becomes. The rugged
beauty, bountiful waters, and rich soils of Sicily have been fought over
for millennia — and we understood why soon after visiting for the first
time. You won’t find such an exciting and pleasing mix of sights, cultures,
Part I: Introducing Italy 
34

flavors, and landscapes anywhere else in Italy. We love Palermo, a pleas-
ant harbor town with spectacular artistic and architectural treasures —
some a bit crumbling — ranging from the Byzantine Duomo di Monreale
to the Arabic La Zisa, the Gothic Cattedrale to the Norman Palazzo 
dei Normanni, the baroque Casa Professa to the Liberty-style Teatro
Massimo. We cannot get enough of the magnificent Greek temples in 
the appropriately named Valley of the Temples in Agrigento, as well as
in Segesta — both easy day trips from Palermo. A bit farther, but chock-
full of spectacular Roman mosaics, is the Villa del Casale of Piazza
Armerina. Although we agree that the fashionable city of Taormina is
nestled in one of Italy’s most picturesque spots — overlooking the blue
sea from a high cliff and dominated by the snow-capped Mount Etna
volcano — it didn’t inspire us as much as the splendid volcanic Eolian
Islands, or Catania with its baroque and 19th-century palaces built of
gray-lava stone, or the fascinating Syracuse, with its Greek and Roman
Archaeological Zone and its baroque island of Ortigia. See Part VII for
coverage of Sicily.
Scheduling Your Time
A quick glance at the map will reveal that the enticing attractions dis-
cussed in the previous section are spread out over a peninsula that’s
more than 700 miles long. A closer look will show you that Italy is
crossed lengthwise by a mountain chain — the Appenines — that will
make any east–west travel more complicated: logistically because there
are fewer roads and railroad lines, and practically because bad weather,
especially in winter, may considerably slow you down. Both these geo-
graphical characteristics can be easily sidestepped, however, by flying
between your destinations. Taking the plane has become quite afford-
able now that many routes within Italy have opened up to small private
carriers (see Chapter 7). The drawback is that flying requires advance
scheduling. If you prefer a more spontaneous itinerary, one that allows
you to change your destination at the last minute, then you should stick
with the freedom afforded by railroad transportation (or rental car, but
for countryside exploration only).
On the other hand, these geographical characteristics make itinerary
planning relatively straightforward: Your travels will be along a general
north–south line. Your route can be as long as your time will allow —
just remember to schedule fewer destinations if you’re traveling by land
rather than by air.
It used to be that all international flights arrived only in Milan or Rome.
These days, you can usually schedule your flight to arrive in one Italian
town and leave from another at no extra expense, which allows for much
more creative itinerary planning (see Chapter 6 for more on how to get
to Italy).
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 35

If your itinerary includes only the major cities, don’t bother renting a 
car — instead, fly or take the train: You’ll see far more beautiful land-
scapes and enjoy your vacation much more. Trains in Italy are getting
better and faster by the day, yet remain very affordable (see Chapter 7).
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
Italy has a mild climate with well-defined seasons, drier and warmer in
the south and colder in the north. The weather doesn’t really influence
tourism in general, as Italy is a year-round destination, but it may affect
your own itinerary planning.

In all major cities and towns, the off season is very short, running from
mid-January to mid-March and from mid-October to mid-December. The
actual dates depend on individual hotels, as well as occupancy: As a rule
of thumb, high season starts earlier for smaller and cheaper hotels,
which tend to fill faster, and lasts longer. The reverse is true for more
expensive hotels. On the seashore and in the mountains, resorts will
often be closed from November through March. Following are what we
consider to be the pros and cons for traveling in each season.
Part I: Introducing Italy 
36

April through June
This is when Italy is at its most beautiful, for the following reasons:
 The weather is mild, so you won’t have to worry about either
excess heat and sunstroke or the chills.
 Limited rainfall allows you to get out and really enjoy the outdoor
activities.
But keep in mind a couple of drawbacks:
 Everybody knows this is a great season — including hotels and 
airlines, which jack up their prices. The highly desirable hotels fill
up fast.
 Around Easter, vast numbers of Catholic pilgrims and large groups
of very noisy schoolchildren from around the world descend on
Italy (particularly its major destinations), making it all but impossi-
ble to enjoy many attractions.
July and August
Summertime is when many Italians take their vacations, and there are
many upsides:
 The weather is beautiful throughout most of Italy.
 You can get discount rates in most towns and cities, as well as in
Sicily.
 There are great art and music festivals, concerts, and outdoor
events everywhere — cultural life is at its peak.
On the other hand:
 Airfares are high.
 The heat can make things quite uncomfortable — remember, Italy
is still mostly a non–air-conditioned country, and Sicily is sunstroke
territory.
 Mountain and seaside resorts, which can provide a respite from the
heat, are taken over by Italian tourists.
 Many city shops and restaurants close during the month of August.
September and October
Next to spring, fall is our favorite time to travel to Italy. Here’s why:
 The weather is usually fairly mild and pleasant.
 Many potential tourists are busy with back-to-school preparations,
making crowds relatively sparse.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 37

On the other hand:
 Airfares and hotel prices are still high.
 You have to watch for the rain, which typically starts falling in
October.
November through March
More and more vacationers are reaping the benefits of traveling to Italy
in the winter. Its reputation as the “off season” is fast disappearing.
Here’s why:
 Crowds are at their lowest at the prime attractions.
 You’ll often receive better and more attentive service in hotels
during this season.
 Except for the Christmas–New Year’s period, airfares and hotel
rates are at their lowest.
But keep in mind:
 You may have fewer lodging choices in some areas because of sea-
sonal closures — most hotels and restaurants in Italy take a winter
break of at least two to three weeks.
 Although average temperatures are mild, you’ll have to put up with
rain and occasionally lots of snow. It can get cold and quite foggy in
the northern regions. Depending on how sensitive you are to colder
temperatures, you may not be able to enjoy some of the outdoor
attractions.
Perusing a Calendar of Events
Italy has many festivals and events worth planning a holiday around.
Alternatively, you can use the following calendar to avoid big events and
their attendant crowds. You’ll find more information on each event in
the destination chapters later in this book.
January
Celebrations of the new year are held throughout Italy. In Rome, a great
show for children is staged in Piazza del Popolo (% 06-36004399), while
Florence celebrates with its annual boat race, the Regata sull’Arno 
(% 055-23320). January 1.
Throughout the country, the religious holiday Epifania is very important
for children, as they receive special gifts on this day (more than on 
Dec 25). On the days preceding Epiphany, open-air fairs selling children’s
toys and gifts are held in most towns; the best is in Rome’s Piazza Navona.
January 6.

February
Everywhere in Italy, Carnevale swallows up the week before Ash
Wednesday, culminating on Fat Tuesday or Martedi Grasso. One of the
most spectacular celebrations is in Venice, where people dress up in
splendid costumes and the city organizes concerts and fireworks 
(% 041-5298711); the famous parade of floats in Viareggio in Tuscany
culminates celebrations that last a whole month (% 0584-47503). One
week prior to Ash Wednesday.
March/April
On Good Friday, the Catholic rite of the procession of the Stations of the
Cross (Via Crucis) is presented in most Italian churches, often as a reen-
actment with costumes. In Rome, the procession takes place at night, led
by the pope, between the Colosseum and Palatine Hill. Other spectacu-
lar processions are the ones in Assisi and in several towns in Sicily.
Friday before Easter Sunday.
For Easter, in Rome, the pope gives his traditional Easter Benediction 
in Piazza San Pietro, while in Florence, mass ends with the Scoppio del
Carro (% 055-290832), the explosion of a cart laden with fireworks and
flowers outside the Duomo. Easter Sunday, between the end of March
and mid-April.
During the Exhibition of Azaleas in Rome, more than 3,000 azalea plants
decorate the Spanish Steps. Concerts are held in Trinità dei Monti at the
head of the steps. Call % 06-4889991 for more information. One week in
mid-April, weather dependent.

and major competition in Venice. Second half of May.
Rome’s glamorous Concorso Ippico Internazionale (% 06-6383818;
www.piazzadisiena.com) attracts the best riders and mounts from all
over to beautiful Piazza di Siena in Villa Borghese. You can buy tickets at
the gate. End of May.
The end of May brings the Settimana della Cultura, a statewide event
during which admission to all the major museums is free — hence, no
reservations are taken and everything becomes a zoo, with thousands of
school groups roaming around. When planning your trip to major towns
in Italy, take this into account. If possible, schedule your visit at a differ-
ent time — we promise, it’s worth it to pay admission. Last week of May.
June
Now in its fourth decade, the Spoleto Festival (% 0743-220320; www.
spoletofestival.it) includes concerts, opera, dance, and theater.

Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 41

The pope gives a special Christmas Blessing to Rome and the world
from St. Peter’s Square at noon. December 25.
Partying reaches its climax at midnight on New Year’s Eve, when Italy
explodes — literally — with fireworks. In spite of the government’s call
for caution, everybody gets in on the act, shooting fireworks from every
window and roof in the country. By tradition, fireworks are accompanied
by the symbolic throwing away of something old to mark the end of the
old year. Some people get carried away, so watch out for falling UFOs if
you take a stroll in major cities shortly after midnight! December 31.

Chapter 4
Following an Itinerary: 
Four Great Options
In This Chapter
 Touring Italy in one or two weeks
 Visiting Italy with your kids
 Rediscovering the ancients
I
taly offers an endless array of things to see, do, and taste — but, alas,
few of us have the time to do it all. And even if you want to cram as
much into your trip as possible, you still have some tough choices to
make. This chapter gives some sample itineraries that won’t break your
budget or your back, including one for families and one for antiquity
buffs. We recommend you book your transatlantic flight with arrival into
one Italian city and departure from another — an option that’s often
affordable when you book directly with the carrier (see Chapter 6).
Seeing Italy’s Highlights in One Week
You won’t have much time to linger anywhere, but if all you have is one
week — grab it! Think of this as a crash course in Italian life and culture.
Day 1
Fly into Milan and check into your hotel. Start with a visit to the Duomo.
Afterward, proceed for a stroll in Milan’s best shopping district, Via
Montenapoleone, where you can purchase, or at least see, the latest in
Italian fashion. Spend the afternoon at the Brera, taking in your first
great collection of Italian art. Celebrate your arrival in one of Italy’s best
restaurants, CraccoPeck, where you can enjoy a view of the nearby
Duomo by night (see Chapter 17).
Day 2 and 3
Take an early train to Venice (the trip takes under two and a half hours)
and check into your hotel. Squeeze in our “Venice in two days” itinerary
(see Chapter 16).

Day 4
Take as early a train as you can to Florence, which you’ll reach in
slightly under three hours. Check into your hotel, and immediately start
with our “Florence in one day” itinerary in Chapter 13.
Day 5 and 6
Yes, you guessed right: Take an early train, this time to Rome, where you
will arrive in under two hours. Get settled in your hotel, which will need
to be fairly central (see Chapter 11) given the amount of ground you’ll
want to cover. Follow our “Rome in two days” itinerary (see Chapter 12).
Day 7
Again, take an early high-speed train to Naples — you’ll be there in
under 90 minutes. What more appropriate destination for your last day
in Italy! Get settled in your hotel and follow our “Naples in one day” itin-
erary (see Chapter 18). Fly back home the next morning from the Naples
airport.
Touring the Best of Italy in Two Weeks
Two weeks is a good amount of time — you will be able to see enough to
enjoy yourself without feeling rushed all the time.
Day 1, 2, and 3
Fly into Milan and follow our Day 1, 2, and 3 suggestions in the itinerary
earlier.
Day 4 and 5
Take as early a train as you can to Florence, which you’ll reach in
slightly under three hours. Check into your hotel; then start with our
“Florence in two days” itinerary (see Chapter 13).
Day 6, 7, and 8
Take an early train to Rome, a trip of less than two hours. Get settled in
your hotel and then start following our “Rome in three days” itinerary
(see Chapter 12).
Day 9 and 10
Take the 90-minute high-speed train to Naples in the morning and 
check into your hotel. Follow our “Naples in two days” itinerary (see
Chapter 18).
Part I: Introducing Italy 
44

Day 11
Choose one of the day trips suggested in Chapter 19, visiting either
Herculaneum or Pompeii, or perhaps taking the archeobus to the Campi
Flegrei. Or you can book a car service to take you on a daylong private
tour of Sorrento and the Amalfi Drive (see Chapter 20). If you opt for the
latter, take your luggage along so that you can have your limo deliver you
to the Molo Angioino in time to catch the Tirrenia overnight ferry for
Palermo (see Chapter 21). Check into your cabin and enjoy the cruise (if
you wake up at the right time in the night, you may catch a glimpse of
Stromboli, an active volcano of the Eolian Islands, spewing fireworks into
the evening sky). Alternatively, fly into Palermo the next morning.
Day 12
Once in Palermo, spend the day following our “Palermo in one day” itin-
erary (see Chapter 21).
Day 13
If you don’t mind a lot of driving, rent a car for the next two days and
drive yourself to Agrigento and the Valle dei Templi for a visit to its
splendid Greek temples. Then drive on to Syracuse and spend the night
there (see Chapter 22). For a less tiring day, take an organized bus tour
to the Valley of the Temples from Palermo (see Chapter 21), and then
come back to spend the night in your hotel.
Day 14
Visit Ortigia early in the morning and then proceed to Taormina —
you’ll enjoy spending your last day in Italy in this idyllic town. Fly home
from Catania airport the next morning (see Chapter 22). Alternatively,
take an organized bus tour from Palermo to Taormina (see Chapter 21)
and fly home from Palermo.
Discovering Italy with Kids
When traveling with kids, the big question is how much cultural sight-
seeing (particularly museums) they can handle. Luckily, Italy offers
plenty of attractions and sights that children will enjoy. The following
itinerary is what we would do if we had only a week with our children 
in Italy.
If your child is under 18 months, you can probably follow one of the
other itineraries geared toward adults. Most museums have benches
where you can rest or nurse, and Italians are pretty tolerant — if you get
any funny looks, it’ll probably be from other tourists. But if you have a
rambunctious toddler or older child, you’ll definitely want to switch to
this kid-size itinerary.
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 45

Day 1 and 2
Fly into Venice, get settled in your hotel, and follow our “Venice in one
day” itinerary for your first day (see Chapter 16). If there are two adults
in your party, take turns visiting the Gallerie dell’Accademia while the
other grown-up leads the kids on unending boat rides on the vaporetto
transportation system (we recommend you get a day pass) or exploring
the labyrinth of narrow streets and pretty bridges in the area. On your
second day, visit the Lagoon, particularly the islands of Lido — where
you can rent bikes and explore the beaches — and Murano, where your
kids will be fascinated by a visit to the glass-making factories. If you
have teenagers, follow the recommendations of the Rolling Venice pro-
gram, designed particularly for them (see Chapter 16).
Day 3
Take an early train to Florence, where you will arrive in just under three
hours. Check into your hotel and start with a stroll through town, taking
in the Duomo, Giotto’s Bell Tower, and the Baptistery, and going on to
Piazza della Signoria and Palazzo Vecchio and the famous Ponte
Vecchio. You can take turns visiting the Uffizi (make the appropriate
reservations) while the other parent entertains the children in the
Boboli Gardens or the outdoor markets of San Lorenzo and della Paglia
(see Chapter 13).
Day 4 and 5
Take an early train to Rome — you’ll be there in less than two hours. Get
settled in your hotel and follow our “Rome in two days” itinerary (see
Chapter 12), but replace the Galleria Borghese with a boat ride along
the Tiber (or take turns at the Galleria while your children row boats
and visit the kids’ attractions in Villa Borghese). On your second day in
Rome, replace the Vatican Museums with a bike tour of the Appian Way
and a visit to the Catacombs there, which children usually love (alterna-
tively, take turns at the Vatican while your children visit the wonderful
Egyptian section of the Musei Vaticani or go on that boat ride on the
Tiber).
Day 6 and 7
Take the 90-minute high-speed train to Naples. If you have teenagers,
proceed with our “Naples in one day” itinerary (see Chapter 18), replac-
ing the Capodimonte Museum with the Catacombs of St. Gennaro
on your first day. Spend your second day here exploring Pompeii,
Herculaneum, or the Campi Flegrei. Alternatively, take a taxi to the
harbor and hop on the ferry (or hydrofoil) for a day trip to Capri (see
Chapters 19 and 20) — you’ll appreciate the chance to relax, especially if
you’re with younger children. If two days of hiking the island, visiting
ruins, and basking in the sun seem like too much, you can always catch
Part I: Introducing Italy 
46

a ferry on your second day to Positano, Amalfi, or Sorrento (see
Chapter 20). Catch your flight back home from the Naples airport the
next morning.
Unearthing Italy’s Ancient History
If archaeology and ancient history and culture are your thing, the focus
of your visit should be central and southern Italy — Rome, Naples, and
Sicily — where the main intersection of Etruscan, Greek, Carthaginian,
Roman, Norman, and Arab influences took place.
Day 1 and 2
Fly into Rome, get settled in your hotel, and buy a combo ticket for the
110 Open Stop & Go bus tour plus the Archeobus. Refer to Day 1 of our
“Rome in two days” itinerary (see Chapter 12), but replace the Galleria
Borghese with Palazzo Massimo alle Terme. On Day 2, catch an early
Archeobus from Termini and head for the Park of the Appian Way and
its many attractions. Upon your return in the late afternoon, squeeze in
a visit to the Pantheon and a stroll through Piazza Navona and Castel
Sant’Angelo.
Day 3
Take an early high-speed train to Naples, which you’ll reach in under 90
minutes. Get settled in your hotel and then start with a visit to the
Museo Archeologico. Afterward, take a local train to Pompeii (see
Chapter 19).
Day 4
If you start early in the day, you should have time for the Campi Flegrei
in the morning and Herculaneum in the afternoon; otherwise, limit your-
self to one of them. Alternatively, take a day trip to visit the Roman ruins
of Capri — they aren’t as spectacular as the ones on the mainland, but
they do have a strong historical and mystical appeal (see Chapter 20).
Take the night ferry to Palermo or fly there the next morning.
Day 5
If you don’t mind a lot of driving, rent a car for the next three days and
drive yourself to Agrigento and the Valle dei Templi, where you’ll spend
the night. Stop on the way to see the Doric temple in Segesta, as well as
the ruins of Selinunte (see Chapter 22). Alternatively, for a less tiring
vacation, settle yourself in Palermo and take day trips using the excel-
lent bus tours (see Chapter 21).
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 47

Day 6
Early in the morning, drive to Piazza Armerina to see the Villa del
Casale. In the afternoon, proceed to Syracuse and check into a hotel.
Visit the archaeological area before sunset (see Chapter 22).
Day 7
Visit the Ortigia early in the morning and then head to Taormina, 
where you can admire the splendid Greek theater (see Chapter 22). Fly
home from Catania (or Palermo, if you chose to take day trips) the next
morning.

Trip to Italy

In this part . . . 
I
n this part, we get down to the nuts and bolts of organiz-
ing your trip, including smart choices that will help you
reduce costs and enjoy your vacation even more. Plus, we
give tips for travelers with special interests and needs. 
Chapter 5 discusses money; we deal with budget-related
questions, list some tips for pinching a euro here and there
without sacriﬁcing, and suggest the best ways to handle your
money. Chapter 6 concerns the various ways of getting to
Italy, while Chapter 7 gives you information about getting
around Italy after you arrive. Chapter 8 covers hotel options
and booking your room. In Chapter 9, we offer advice for a
variety of special situations, including traveling with children.
Chapter 10 takes care of details that many travelers leave to
the last minute, such as getting a passport, thinking about
medical and travel insurance, and making reservations for
special events.

Chapter 5
Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Devising a realistic budget for your trip
 Finding ways to save some money
 Carrying cash and making sense of the euro
W
hen it comes to planning a vacation budget, you usually deal with
two different numbers: what you’d like to spend and what you
can spend. But if you trim here and there on the incidentals and splurge
just on the things that really matter to you, you can still design a terrific
vacation without breaking the bank. In this chapter, we give you some
pointers on being realistic and keeping track of all the costs that you’ll
have to bear in mind, as well as all the necessary info on handling and
carrying foreign currency.
Planning Your Budget
Italy is more tourist-friendly than ever as the level of services has
increased to match the highest international standards. Globalization,
though, has not come without a price: The cost of living has almost dou-
bled since the introduction in 2002 of the euro, the unit of currency that
replaced the old lire. You get more in hotels and restaurants now, but
you pay more as well. On the other hand, many public institutions,
including state museums and attractions, have maintained — or even
reduced — their prices while offering a lot more than before.
We figure there are six major elements that eat up your vacation budget:
transportation, lodging, dining, sightseeing, shopping, and nightlife.
Knowledge is key, and we want to share with you our hard-earned expe-
rience in each of these areas.
The tables below give a sample of costs that you may encounter on your
trip, both in cities and in the countryside. And if you’re wondering about
taxes, we cover that in “Taking Taxes into Account,” later in this chapter.

Transportation
Airfare to Italy will be one of the biggest items in your budget. Keeping it
low gives you a sort of cushion for the rest of your expenses. The actual
cost depends on the time of year that you travel, but booking in advance
helps, too: In high season, you’re lucky to find a round-trip ticket for less
than about $900; at other times, though, you may find tickets for half
that much or even less. But if you procrastinate and wait until mid-June
to reserve a flight for July, you’ll be lucky to pay $1,200 — if you can find
a seat at all. Be sure to check out our money-saving tips before you buy
an airline ticket (see Chapter 6).

What you’ll spend on transportation once you’re in Italy depends a lot
on your itinerary. Most towns and villages — even small ones — can be
reached by public transportation, which is very affordable and has ever-
improving service. Many train routes offer high-speed options as well.
Traveling by train from Rome to Naples, for example, will cost you about
20€ ($24) for a full fare — or 33€ ($40) on the high-speed — while the
trip from Florence to nearby Siena costs 6€ ($7.20). Buses are usually
cheaper: Count on about 5€ ($6) for a ride between Florence and Siena,
or 17€ ($20) between Siena and Rome.
Flying domestically has become a lot more common as the private carri-
ers have multiplied — with the consequence that prices have dropped
and you can now find a lot of great deals: Venice–Rome may cost you as
little as 75€ ($90); Rome–Catania, 73€ ($88).
In contrast, traveling by car continues to be a nightmare of potential
accidents and high costs — fuel hovers around 1.35€ per liter ($7.36 per
gallon), renting a car is likely to be more expensive than what you’re
used to back home, tolls on highways are high, and parking ain’t cheap,
either. Long-distance trips between major destinations are best done 
by public transportation, which is both cheaper and a lot safer. Unless
you want to meander in the countryside at leisure, skip the car rental
altogether!
See Chapter 7 for more on traveling within Italy and on driving in a for-
eign country.
Lodging
Lodging is another big-ticket item, but one you cannot forego: After all,
you do need to sleep somewhere! This expense fluctuates depending 
on the time of year; in high season, prices in certain destinations can
double, and you’ll have to book well in advance to secure the best
hotels. The costs also depend on your itinerary: Cities and major towns
are the most expensive, while you’ll spend a bit less in the countryside;
also, southern Italy tends to be less expensive than the north. For exam-
ple, you can consider yourself lucky to find a nice room in high season in
Rome or Venice for 200€ ($240), and it will more likely cost you 250€
($300). You’ll do better in smaller towns and in southern Italy: You
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 53

should find that same nice room in Assisi for 160€ ($192), and in Naples
for 180€ ($216); in the countryside, you should be able to pay about
160€ ($192) in the north and 130€ ($156) in the south.
In the hotel reviews in this book, we supply the rack rates, which in Italy
are the highest prices the hotel can charge you (at the peak of high
season and when the hotel is completely full). You should be able to do
better in most cases. See the Introduction for a table indicating what the
$ symbols ($–$$$$) mean.
Dining
Your expenses in this category will vary with your style: What you spend
will depend on what and how you eat. Possibilities in Italy are endless
and, on the whole, very satisfactory — you’ll find cheap eateries and
gourmet haunts and everything in between, all serving excellent food.
You also have the option of buying your own food (for snacks and pic-
nics, for example) from a wide range of choices, including small vendors,
open-air markets, and supermarkets. Prices depend on the elegance of
the place you choose and on the food you order, although you can count
on spending more in cities and major towns and less in smaller destina-
tions and the countryside. The north — again — is more expensive than
the south. Drinks excluded, expect to spend about 35€ ($42) per person
for dinner in Rome in a nice restaurant and 20€ ($24) in a less formal
one, such as a pizzeria or osteria; for the same meals in Venice, you’ll
spend 40€ ($48) and 25€ ($30) respectively; and in Naples, 30€ ($36)
and 15€ ($18). In the countryside, you should spend a bit less. For a
truly special meal in one of the top restaurants, expect to spend an aver-
age of 60€ ($72) per person for a meat dinner and as much as 80€ ($96)
for fish, in both cases a full meal including several courses. For a meal
on the go, you can grab a bite for as little as 5€ to 8€ ($6–$9.60) in a ros-
ticceria or pizza a taglio place (see Chapter 2 for the different types of
restaurant options in Italy). Prices are not significantly different at lunch
or dinner, but some restaurants serve more elaborate dishes — priced
accordingly — only at dinner.
Just as with the hotel reviews, we use a dollar-sign system to indicate
the average prices of restaurants; these refer to a complete meal. See the
Introduction for a table indicating what the $ symbols ($–$$$$) mean.
Within the listing information in each review, we give the price range of
secondi; these are meat or fish dishes (the most expensive dishes on the
menu). Keep in mind that in order to have the equivalent of a main
course, you’ll have to order a side dish separately — or you may be con-
tent with just a primo (a less expensive pasta dish). See Chapter 2 for
more on the structure of a meal in Italy.
Tipping isn’t a big extra in Italy because service is usually included in the
prices; it’s okay to leave just a small token of appreciation. Check for the
words servizio incluso (service included) on the menu; if they aren’t 
there, expect to pay a full gratuity of 15 percent.

Sightseeing
This is what you’ve come to Italy for: visiting attractions, attending
events, and enjoying the local culture. Luckily, this expense is the most
manageable: The most you’ll pay for museum admission is 12€ ($14) for
the whole string of museums on Piazza San Marco in Venice, and 10€
($12) for the archaeological area of Pompeii or Herculaneum. Admission
to the important museums hovers around 6€ ($7.20), and many attrac-
tions charge only between 2€ and 5€ ($2.40–$6). What’s more, many
attractions are free: most churches, for instance, since they are places 
of worship and not museums (remember to avoid visiting during mass
unless you’re attending the service).
If you make advance reservations for attractions, you’ll be able to esti-
mate this part of your budget before you even arrive in Italy. Most muse-
ums and attractions allow you to do so — and they sometimes grant you
a discount to boot (see Chapter 10 for more on advance reservations).
Shopping
Shopping is the one expenditure that can be considered an extra: You
can spend hundreds on a full-length leather coat for yourself or for a
friend, or you can skip the shopping completely. Yet Italy is a shopper’s
paradise: The country is famous for its artwork, design, and crafts — 
art glass, pottery, leather, gold, and lace, among many other fine wares.
Italian fashion isn’t half-bad either — Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, and
Armani are a few of the world-famous Italian firms. Depending on
exchange rates, you may actually save by buying Italian goods in Italy.
More important, though, shopping here gives you a chance to buy 
things that simply aren’t available, or not in such variety, back home.
Throughout this book, we give our recommendations for the best shops
and items that each city has to offer. If your budget allows it, use your
trip as a chance to pick up that special something you have an irre-
sistible craving for — maybe a Murano chandelier, a pair of leather
boots, or a Gucci handbag (you may even find a nice used Ferrari).
Nightlife
Visiting the opera, going out for a drink, listening to music in a jazz club,
and dancing the night away are all extra pleasures that will make your
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 55
A pocketful of change
In many of Italy’s churches, fragile paintings are kept in semi-obscurity, but you will
often find a light box nearby. When you insert a coin or two, a light pops on to illumi-
nate a painting, fresco, or sculpture for a limited amount of time. Therefore, carrying
a pocketful of coins is always a good idea.

time in Italy that much more memorable. Expect to pay between 30€
and 120€ ($36–$144) for a seat at the opera, and between 15€ and 30€
($18–$36) for a concert, depending on the performer. Cover charges for
nightclubs hover around 10€ ($12), while a drink in a trendy bar will
cost between 6€ and 10€ ($7.20–$12). Once again, expect higher prices
in cities and large towns, lower ones in small towns and the countryside.
You’ll also find many serendipitous little things to enjoy that are free 
or nearly so, such as people-watching on a beautiful floodlit piazza,
eating an ice-cream cone while strolling on the main street of a historic
center, and ordering a coffee or drink in a classic caffè and soaking in the
atmosphere.
Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
Don’t feel like taking out a second mortgage on your house so you can
afford a vacation to Italy? Well, start thinking like an Italian. Italians have
relatively less disposable income than Americans and have found many
ways to enjoy themselves without going broke. Mirror the way they live
and travel, and the cheaper your trip will be — and the more closely
you’ll get to know the Italians themselves. One thing we recommend,
however: Don’t skip attractions in order to save the admission price, as
sightseeing isn’t an area where you can save a lot of money, and you’ll
probably be sorry if you try. If you could enjoy the same experience
from the outside, then the attraction probably wouldn’t charge you for
entering . . . and we would certainly say so in our write-up!
Throughout this book, you’ll see Bargain Alert icons that highlight
money-saving tips and/or great deals. Here are some additional cost-
cutting strategies:
 Surf the Web. Airlines often have special Internet-only rates that
are appreciably cheaper than rates quoted over the phone. You can
also find good hotel packages online.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
56
Follow the bouncing euro
Only a few years ago, the euro was worth about 90¢; it then bounced back strongly to
over $1.30, and now it costs $1.20 to buy a euro. Such swings can make a huge differ-
ence: The 100€-per-night hotel that seemed like a bargain at $90 a couple years ago
now would cost $120 (if you can still find it). Another example: Admission to Palazzo
Altemps has gone down from 5.16€ to 5€, but in dollars the price has increased from
$4.60 to $6. By the time you read this, the two currencies may be closer to parity, but
then again, maybe not. Obviously it will help to keep an eye on the euro while you’re
planning your trip.

 Make your reservations ahead of time. Flights have only so many
seats at low rates, and the best moderately priced hotels fill up fast.
 Try a package tour. For popular destinations like Italy, you can
book airfare, hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightsee-
ing by making just one call to a travel agent or packager, and you
may pay a lot less than if you tried to put the trip together yourself.
But always work out the prices that you’d pay if you arranged the
pieces of your trip yourself, just to double-check. See the section
on package tours in Chapter 6 for specific suggestions.
 Go off season. If you can travel at nonpeak times (usually winter,
with the exception of the Christmas and New Year’s holidays), you
can find airfares and hotel prices as much as 20 percent lower than
during peak months.
 Travel during off-peak days of the week. Airfares vary depending
not only on the time of the year, but also on the day of the week. In
Italy, weekend rates are often cheaper than weekday rates. When
you inquire about airfares, ask if you can obtain a cheaper rate by
flying on a different day.
 Pack light. Packing light enables you to carry your own bags and
not worry about finding a porter (don’t forget to tip yourself).
Likewise, you can more easily take a bus or a train rather than a
cab from the airport, saving you a few more euro.
 Book a hotel in the center of town. If you’re near all the attrac-
tions, you’ll save money on cab fares and public transportation, 
as well as time — your most valuable asset during a vacation.
 Make do with a smaller hotel room and bathroom. It will be differ-
ent from back home, but oh so atmospheric! (See Chapter 8 for
more on what to expect from your hotels in Italy.)
 Ask if your kids can stay in the room with you. Many hotels won’t
charge you the additional-person rate if your extra person is pint-
size and related to you. You can save much more if you don’t take
two rooms, even if you have to pay some extra euro for a rollaway
bed.
 Skip the breakfast at your hotel (unless it’s included in your room
rate). It won’t be an American breakfast, anyway (except in the
most expensive hotels), and grabbing a hot drink and pastry at a
bar will give you further insight into the local culture. You can also
reserve a room with a refrigerator and keep a few breakfast sup-
plies on hand.
 Have lunch on the go. Try pizza or a bowl of pasta (see Chapter 2
for more on this). Or, armed with a corkscrew and a plastic fork,
you can cheaply assemble a fine picnic lunch from the supermar-
ket, using ingredients you pay dearly for at your local gourmet
shop — fresh bread, locally cured prosciutto, regional cheeses, raw
or cooked vegetables, and local wine or mineral water. A picnic
lunch is also a great way to visit some of the outdoor sights.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 57

 Skip the bread and sodas at restaurants. Most restaurants impose
a basic table-and-bread charge (called pane e coperto) of 1.50€ to
5€ ($1.80–$6), which you can avoid in some restaurants — most
restaurants in Rome, for instance — by saying no to the bread
basket. Also, soft drinks are relatively expensive in Italy, whereas
you can order a large bottle of mineral water or a pitcher of house
wine (vino della casa) quite cheaply.
 Take advantage of combination tickets and discount cards. We’ve
flagged these special offers for you in the specific destination chap-
ters that follow. (In Venice, for instance, people under 30 can receive
a discount for shopping, accommodations, and sightseeing with the
Rolling Venice pass.)
 Don’t sit to sip. If what you’re after is a coffee or a drink and not an
experience, save yourself the hefty table-service surcharge at cafes
and bars and have your drink at the counter. A simple coffee at an
outside table in Piazza San Marco in Venice, for example, may cost
the same as lunch anywhere else.
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and memories could be the
best mementos of your trip. If you’re concerned about money, you
can do without the T-shirts, key chains, salt and pepper shakers,
and other trinkets.
Handling Money
If you ignore the fact that you’ll probably incur more expenses while
you’re on vacation than you would while at home (unless you happen to
eat out at every meal) and that you’ll be dealing with a foreign currency,
you should find things pretty familiar: The only form of payment that
won’t be quite as available to you away from home is your personal
checkbook.
Making sense of the euro
Italy’s currency, the euro (the plural is also euro, and it’s abbreviated as
€ in this guide), was introduced in January 2002 in Italy and in 11 other
European countries. You can use the same currency in Austria, Belgium,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. The transformation to the euro has
made prices much more user-friendly: 1€ is a lot easier to understand
than 1,932 liras!
The exchange rate used in this book is 1€ = $1.20; we round off all dollar
values above $10. Exchange rates fluctuate all the time, though, so check
www.ex-rates.com for up-to-date (and historical) comparisons between
the euro and your currency, whether it’s the U.S. or Canadian dollar, the
British pound, or something else. Another excellent Web site is www.
xe.com/ucc. At press time, the British pound was at 1£ = 1.51€. These
were the rates of exchange used to calculate the values in Table 5-3.

Note that when saying the word euro, Italians pronounce all three
vowels, so it’s ay-ur-oh, not yurr-oh.
You can exchange money at all points of entry in Italy: You’ll find auto-
mated teller machines (ATMs) as well as exchange bureaus at airports
and train stations and, of course, in town. Exchange bureaus usually dis-
play multilingual signs (CHANGE/CAMBIO/WECHSEL). Rates may vary to some
degree. For example, some bureaus advertise “no fee” exchanges, but
then give you a lower rate so you come out the same anyway. Arriving in
Italy with a small supply of euro, at least enough to pay for a cab to your
hotel, is a good idea in case the ATM at the airport doesn’t work or the
lines are unbearably long.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM.
Look at the back of your bank card to see which network you’re on; 
then call or check online for ATM locations at your destination. Cirrus
(% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com) is the most common interna-
tional network in Italy. PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) exists,
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 59

but is less common. The Banca Nationale del Lavoro (BNL) is one bank
that does offer PLUS in its ATMs; another sure bet are the ATMs of the
Italian post offices.
Before leaving for Italy, make sure that you check the daily withdrawal
limit for your ATM card, and ask whether you need a new personal iden-
tification number (PIN). (You need a four-digit PIN in Europe, so if you
currently have a six-digit PIN, you must get a new one before you go.)
Also, if your PIN is a word, make sure you know how it translates into
numbers — some ATM keypads in Italy display only numbers.
Many banks impose a fee every time your card is used at a different bank’s
ATM, and that fee can be higher for international transactions (up to $5 or
more) than for domestic ones (where they’re rarely more than $1.50). On
top of this, the bank from which you withdraw cash may charge its own
fee. For details on international withdrawal fees, ask your bank.
In cities and towns, ATMs are never far away, so you can walk around
with little cash in your wallet, especially if don’t mind paying for pur-
chases with a credit card. Before going off on a driving tour of the coun-
tryside, however, make sure that you have a good stock of cash in your
wallet; banks and ATMs are rarer there, and lots of small businesses
don’t accept credit cards.
If you have linked checking and savings accounts and you’re in the habit
of moving relatively small amounts of money from savings to checking as
you need it, beware: Italian ATMs won’t show you the transfer-between-
accounts option, and they won’t allow you to withdraw money directly
from your savings account. If your checking account runs dry, you must
call or write your bank to move money from savings to checking. (We did
so, and our bank charged us $30. Ouch!)

The euro look
Paper bills come in 5€, 10€, 20€, 50€, 100€, 200€, and 500€ denominations. All bills
are brightly colored and have a different shade for each denomination. In addition, the
higher the value, the larger the physical size of the bill. Coins come in 1€ and 2€ (both
thin and brass-colored); 10-cent, 20-cent, and 50-cent (all brass colored); and 1-cent,
2-cent, and 5-cent (all copper-colored) denominations. For more information and pic-
tures of the currency, check the official Web site of the European Union (http://
europa.eu.int/euro) or the European Central Bank (www.euro.ecb.int).
Don’t be surprised to see different country names on euro bills and coins: One face is
the European side, common to all of the participating countries, and the reverse face
is the national side, where each country has printed its own design. All are valid and
accepted in each of the countries.

Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money. They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances on your credit
cards at banks or ATMs as long as you know your PIN, but the interest
rate is high. Keep in mind that when you use your credit card abroad,
most banks assess a 2 percent fee above the 1 percent fee charged by
Visa or MasterCard or American Express for currency conversion on
credit charges. But credit cards still may be the smart way to go when
you factor in things like exorbitant ATM fees and higher traveler’s-check
exchange rates (and service fees).
Some credit-card companies recommend that you notify them of any
upcoming trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when the
card is used in a foreign destination and end up blocking your charges.
Even if you don’t call your credit-card company in advance, you can
always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is refused —
a good reason to carry the phone number with you. But perhaps the
most important lesson here is to carry more than one card with you on
your trip; a card may not work for any number of reasons, so having a
backup is the smart way to go.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because 24-hour ATMs
allow you to withdraw small amounts of cash as needed. Traveler’s
checks are still widely accepted in Italy, especially at large stores and
hotels, and they’ll save you the ATM withdrawal fee, but they can get
stolen and you’ll need to show identification every time you want to
cash one.
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You’ll pay a service charge ranging from 1 to 4 percent. You can
also get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by calling
% 800-221-7282; AmEx gold and platinum cardholders who use this
number are exempt from the 1 percent fee. Visa offers traveler’s checks
at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as at several other banks. The
service charge ranges between 1.5 and 2 percent. Call % 800-732-1322
for information. AAA members can obtain Visa checks without a fee at
most AAA offices or by calling % 800-339-3378. Traveler’s checks are
also available through MasterCard; call % 800-223-9920 for a location
near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in case they’re stolen or lost.
You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 61

Taking Taxes into Account
You may not notice taxes in Italy because they’re included in the prices
that you’re quoted, but do know that the value-added tax (known as the
IVA) is a steep 19 percent. The good news is that you can get a refund for
purchases costing more than 155€ ($178). Stores displaying a TAX FREE
sign will give you an invoice that you can cash at the airport’s Customs
office as you leave Italy. You can also have the invoice from the store
stamped at the airport by Customs, and then mail it back to the store,
which will then send you a check or credit your charge account.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Being on vacation is a blissful time of distraction and discovery.
Unfortunately, this makes visitors a ripe target for pickpockets. If you
discover that your wallet has been lost or stolen, contact all of your
credit-card companies right away. You’ll also want to file a report at the
nearest police precinct (your credit-card company or insurer may
require a police-report number or record of the loss). Most credit-card
companies have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost
or stolen; they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or
deliver an emergency credit card in a day or two. In Italy, contact these
offices:
 American Express (% 06-7220348 or 06-72282 or 06-72461;
www.americanexpress.it)
 Diners Club (% 800-864064866 toll-free within Italy; www.diners
club.com)
 MasterCard (% 800-870866 toll-free within Italy; www.mastercard.
com)
 Visa (% 800-819014 toll-free within Italy; www.visaeu.com)
If you need emergency cash over the weekend, when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license or passport along with your
cash and credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immedi-
ately; placing a fraud alert on your record may protect you against liabil-
ity for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies
are Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-
397-3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289;
www.transunion.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
62

your airline and explain the situation; it may allow you to board the
plane if you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a 
copy of the police report you’ve filed.
Watch your purse, wallet, briefcase, or backpack in any public place.
When walking on the street, keep your purse on the side away from traf-
fic, so a thief on a motor scooter can’t speed by and grab it from you.
Better yet, carry your money, credit cards, and passport in an interior
pocket, where pickpockets won’t be able to snatch them.

I
f you live near a major city, getting to Italy may be even easier than
reaching another destination in your own country, but it won’t be
cheaper. Italy is farther from the U.S. than England or France, for exam-
ple, and airfares are significantly higher. The recent increase in fuel
prices has only made matters worse: A round-trip ticket during peak
times can run between $800 and $2,000, depending on how far in
advance you book your trip. Of course, with the cutthroat competition
among airlines, you may be able to lock in a much better deal, especially
if you book well in advance and have a flexible itinerary. This chapter
outlines all the ways and means you have to make getting to Italy a snap.
Flying to Italy
Because Italy is long and skinny in shape, flying into one airport at one
end and leaving from another at the other end makes sense, especially 
if your time is limited and you want to see sights in both northern and
southern Italy. If, for example, you land in Milan, you can then fly out of
Rome, or fly into Venice and leave from Catania. For the right price, this
plan may save you hundreds of miles of driving or sitting on the train
just to retrace your steps to the airport where you entered the country.
Finding out which airlines fly there
Rome and Milan are Italy’s gateways, to which you can fly nonstop from
North America and other continents. For other airports in Italy —
Florence, Pisa, Venice, Naples, Palermo, Catania — you will have to take
a connecting flight.
Alitalia (% 800-223-5730 in the U.S.; 800-361-8336 in Canada; 020-
8814-7700 in the U.K.; 8-8306-8411 in Australia; or 06-2222 in Italy; www.
alitalia.it), the Italian national airline, offers direct flights to Rome

and Milan from most major destinations in the world. It also offers con-
necting flights to every destination in Italy by way of Rome or Milan.
Daily direct flights are scheduled from a number of North American
cities, including New York, Boston, Toronto, and Montreal.
From the United States, you can also try American Airlines (% 800-433-
7300; www.aa.com), Continental (% 800-525-0280; www.continental.
com), Delta (% 800-241-4141; www.delta.com), Northwest/KLM Airlines
(% 800-447-4747; www.nwa.com), United (% 800-538-2929; www.united.
com), and US Airways (% 800-428-4322; www.usairways.com), which all
offer direct nonstop flights to Rome or Milan, at least during peak season.
From Canada, Air Canada (% 888-247-2262; www.aircanada.com)
offers direct flights between Toronto and Rome.
From Australia, Qantas (% 13-13-13; www.qantas.com) offers direct
flights from Melbourne to Rome on a daily basis, plus flights from Sydney
several days a week.
From Britain, you’ll find direct flights to a number of Italian cities via
Alitalia (% 020-8814-7700; www.alitalia.it) and British Airways
(% 0845-773-3377 in the U.K.; www.britishairways.com). The new 
discount, no-frills options include Ryanair (% 0871-246-0000; www.
ryanair.com) and EasyJet (www.easyjet.com).
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Business travelers who need the flexibility of buying their tickets at the
last minute and changing their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and
who want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their com-
panies pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But you can often
qualify for the least expensive price, which will be several hundreds —
or even thousands — of dollars lower than the full fare.
Keep in mind that the lowest-priced fares are often nonrefundable,
require advance purchase and a certain length of stay, have date-of-
travel restrictions, and carry penalties for changing dates of travel.
For Italy, the high season is long and getting longer, and snagging low
fares is increasingly difficult; at certain times, you may be lucky just to
get on any plane heading for Italy. But fear not: You don’t have to pay
top dollar for your airline seat. Here are some tips on scoring the best
airfare:
 Book in advance and be flexible. Fares can vary thousands of dol-
lars, just depending on the season and on how far in advance you
book. Changing the day of the week you travel can save a couple of
hundred dollars. Passengers who can book their ticket far in advance
(21 days at least), who can stay over Saturday night, and who are
willing to travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday will pay a
Chapter 6: Getting to Italy 65

fraction of the full fare. If your schedule is flexible, say so — ask if
you can secure a cheaper fare by staying an extra day, by flying mid-
week, or by traveling during off-peak hours.
 Shop around for specials. Airlines periodically hold sales, which
tend to take place in seasons of low travel volume — for Italy, that
means the dead of winter. As you plan your vacation, keep your eyes
open for sales advertised in newspapers and online. Remember that
if you already hold a ticket when a sale breaks, exchanging your
ticket, which usually incurs a $100 to $150 fee, may pay off.
 Consider non-direct flights. On any day of the week, you can get a
connecting flight through a major European city with a European
national carrier, such as British Airways (% 800-247-297; www.
britishairways.com), Air France (% 800-237-2747; www.air
france.com), KLM (% 800-374-7747; www.klm.nl), or Lufthansa
(% 800-645-3880; www.lufthansa-usa.com). In order to encour-
age travelers to choose a non-direct alternative, round-trip rates
are often handsomely discounted, and connections often involve a
layover of no more than an hour or two. By connecting in major
European hubs, you’ll also be able to fly into Italy’s secondary air-
ports, such as Venice, Florence, Naples, or Catania.
 Join frequent-flier clubs. Accruing miles with one program is best,
as it lets you rack up free flights and achieve elite status faster. But
opening as many accounts as possible makes sense, too, no matter
how seldom you fly a particular airline. It’s free, and you get the
best choice of seats, faster response to phone inquiries, and
prompter service if your luggage is stolen, if your flight is canceled
or delayed, or if you want to change your seat.
Cutting costs by using consolidators
You can also check consolidators, also known as bucket shops. Start by
looking in the Sunday newspaper’s travel section; U.S. travelers should
focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and Miami Herald.
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Web.
STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader
in student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages. ELTExpress
(% 800-TRAV-800; www.flights.com) started in Europe and has excel-
lent fares worldwide. Flights.com also has “local” Web sites in 12 coun-
tries. FlyCheap, an industry leader, has become Lowestfare.com (www.
lowestfare.com) and is now owned by Priceline (see later in this chap-
ter). Air Tickets Direct (% 800-778-3447; www.airticketsdirect.
com) is based in Montreal and leverages the currently weak Canadian
dollar for low fares.
Bucket-shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 to 75 percent of the ticket price.
Some consolidators will also put you on charter airlines with question-
able safety records.

Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies — Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com) —
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will also
send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available to
your favorite destination. Of the smaller sites, SideStep (www.sidestep.
com) receives good reviews from users. It’s a browser add-on that pur-
ports to “search 140 sites at once,” but in reality only beats competitors’
fares as often as other sites do.
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are valid
only for travel that weekend, but some can be booked weeks or months
in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at airline Web sites or check
mega-sites that compile comprehensive lists of last-minute specials,
such as Smarter Living (smarterliving.com). For last-minute trips,
www.lastminute.com (www.site59.com in the U.S.) often has better
deals than the major-label sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for
travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a
mysterious change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major,
well-known carriers — and the possibility of being sent hither and yon
before you arrive in Italy is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m.
or 11 p.m. flight are pretty high. For example, Hotwire has a “no red-eye”
option, but be aware that it thinks a 6 a.m. flight for which you have to
be at the airport two hours in advance (it’s hardly worth putting on your
jammies, is it?) is not a red-eye. Hotwire tells you flight prices before you
buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you have to
play its “name our price” game — and with each try, you have to change
something besides your bid, which is to prevent people from making
endless iterations starting at 20 bucks. If you have fixed travel dates,
better make a realistic bid to start or you’ll have to change them or look
elsewhere. In order to cover all the bases, Priceline has created/pur-
chased Lowestfare.com (www.lowestfare.com), in which you don’t
have to bid for seats.
Arriving by Other Means
You may be adding Italy to a more extensive European vacation, or per-
haps you live in Britain or Ireland. Although usually it’s cheaper and
faster to fly, you may be looking for other ways to get to Italy. We don’t
Chapter 6: Getting to Italy 67

recommend driving, however, even if it may appear tempting: The drive
is not only expensive (with gasoline at over $7 a gallon in Europe, plus
high tolls on highways), but also long and exhausting (we once drove
from Brittany to Rome and are not keen on repeating the experience).
Here are your other options:
 Train: Railroads in Europe offer cheap, reliable, fast, and frequent
service. Paris is connected to Italy by high-speed TGV trains to
Torino–Novara–Milan. From Paris, you can also take the famous
Palatino, the convenient overnight train to Rome. You can also
catch overnight trains from Germany (Hanover, Düsseldorf, Köln,
Bonn, and Frankfurt). Trenitalia, the Italian national train service
(% 892021; www.trenitalia.it), offers excellent deals on rail
passes for both Europe and Italy. Eurailpass grants unlimited first-
class rail travel within most of continental Europe and comes in
several versions for both adults and younger travelers; for exam-
ple, an adult pass costs $588 for 15 days, $1,654 for three months.
The pass also gives you discounts on certain buses and ferries,
such as the ferry from Naples to Palermo. You can buy Eurailpasses
in advance from travel agents or rail agents in major cities such as
New York, Montreal, and Los Angeles; they are also available
through Rail Europe (% 877-272-RAIL in the U.S.; www.rail
europe.com). For more on taking the train in Italy, see Chapter 7.
 Ferry: Several ferry companies service the Mediterranean; you can
get a ferry to one of Italy’s major harbors from a number of coun-
tries in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Naples-based
Grimaldi Ferries (% 081-496444; www.grimaldi-ferries.com)
offers service between Salerno and Palermo (Sicily), Malta, and
Valencia (Spain).
 Bus: The leading operator of scheduled coach services across
Europe is Eurolines (% 0990-143-219; www.eurolines.com),
which runs buses to Italy from London’s Victoria Coach Station. Its
comprehensive network serves Turin, Milan, Bologna, Florence,
and Rome — plus summer routes to Verona, Vicenza, Padua, and
Venice.
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours: The tour
company takes care of all the details — from the itinerary to the meals,
hotels, and attractions tickets and reservations — and your group leader
smooths down all the occasional bumps along the way. You’ll know what
to expect at each leg of your journey; you’ll know what your vacation
costs upfront; and you won’t face many surprises. Fans of escorted tours
know that they can take you to the maximum number of sights in the
minimum amount of time with the least amount of hassle. In this section,
we give some tips on how to choose the escorted tour that best fits your
vacation needs.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
68

If you decide to take an escorted tour, we strongly recommend buying
travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks to you pay upfront.
It’s wise to buy travel insurance through an independent agency. (See
Chapter 10 for more about the ins and outs of travel insurance.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can the tour operator cancel the
trip if they don’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if you
are unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If they cancel?
 How jampacked is the schedule? Does the tour organizer try to fit
25 hours into a 24-hour day, or is there ample time for relaxing
and/or shopping? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not returning
to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. at night sounds like a grind, certain
escorted tours may not be for you.
 How big is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you’ll
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this, as they may not know the exact size of
the group until everybody has made reservations, but they should
be able to give you a rough estimate.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some operators have a minimum
group size, and may cancel the tour if they don’t book enough
people. If a quota exists, find out what it is and how close they are
to reaching it.
 What is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have to pay to
get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be included
in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. How much flexibility do
you have? Can you opt out of certain activities, or does the bus
leave once a day, with no exceptions? Are all your meals planned in
advance? Can you choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody
get the same chicken cutlet?
Local travel agencies can be an excellent source for regional tours. For
example, Compagnia Siciliana Turismo (CST), Via E. Amari 124, 90139
Palermo (% 091-582294; www.compagniasicilianaturismo.it), is
one of the best choices for a tour of Sicily, offering anything from short
two- or three-day tours to longer two-week ones. A large number of inter-
national companies specialize in escorted Italian tours. Here is a brief
list of the most reliable operators:
 Italiatour (% 800-845-3365 or 212-675-2183; www.italiatour.com),
part of the Alitalia Group, offers a variety of tours: You can choose a
regional tour or one that covers the whole country. This is the only
tour operator with a desk right at the airport (at Fiumicino, in Rome)
and native expertise — plus the tours are very competitively priced.
Chapter 6: Getting to Italy 69

 Perillo Tours, 577 Chestnut Ridge Rd., Woodcliff Lake, NJ 07675-9888
(% 800-431-1515 or 201-307-1234; www.perillotours.com), has
been in business for more than half a century. Its itineraries range
from 8 to 15 days and are very diverse. Optional excursions are
offered (at an extra charge) to allow you to customize your tour
somewhat. Perillo tries to cover all the bases, and even has a pack-
age to help you get married in Italy.
 Globus+Cosmos Tours (% 800-338-7092; www.globusandcosmos.
com) offers first-class escorted coach tours of various regions, last-
ing from 8 to 16 days.
 Insight Vacations (% 800-582-8380; www.insightvacations.
com), a competitor to Globus+Cosmos, books superior first-class,
fully escorted motor-coach tours.
 Central Holidays (% 800-935-5000; www.centralholidays.com)
offers fully escorted tours in addition to its packages. Several levels
of tours — and levels of “escort” — are offered.
 For luxurious tours, you can also try Abercrombie & Kent, 1520
Kensington Rd., Oak Brook, IL 60523 (% 800-554-7016; www.
abercrombiekent.com; London address: Sloan Square House,
Holbein Place, London SW1W 8NS; % 020-7730-9600).
You can also choose from an increasing number of tours that address
special interests, ranging from archaeology to cuisine to biking or
spelunking. Tour Italy Now (% 800-955-4418; www.touritalynow.com)
leads biking and hiking tours; La Dolce Vita Wine Tours (% 888-746-
0022; www.dolcetours.com) focuses — obviously — on wine; and
Amelia Tours International (% 800-742-4591 or 516-433-0696) concen-
trates on archaeology with an eye on food and wine.
Good online resources for specialty tours and travel include the
Specialty Travel Index (www.specialtytravel.com), which offers a
comprehensive selection of Italian tours, from ballooning to mushroom
hunting to river cruises; Shaw Guides (www.shawguides.com), with
links to a substantial number of Italy options, from archaeological pro-
grams to falconry excursions to tours for opera fans; and InfoHub
Specialty Travel Guide (www.infohub.com).
Choosing a Package Tour
Package tours — airfare-plus-hotel bundles to which excursions or activ-
ities may be added — can be a smart way to go. In many cases, a pack-
age including airfare, hotel, and transportation to and from the airport
costs less than the hotel alone on a trip you book yourself. That’s
because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators, who resell them to
the public. Package tours can vary widely. Some offer a better class of
hotels than others; others provide the same hotels for lower prices.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
70

Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell charter flights. With
some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel days may be
limited.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of travel magazines such as Travel +
Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler. Liberty
Travel (% 888-271-1584; www.libertytravel.com) is one of the
biggest packagers in the Northeast of the U.S., and usually has a full-
page ad in the Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines, including American Airlines Vacations (% 800-321-2121;
www.aavacations.com), Continental Airlines Vacations (% 800-301-
3800; www.coolvacations.com), Delta Vacations (% 800-221-6666;
www.deltavacations.com), United Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.
unitedvacations.com), and US Airways Vacations (% 800-455-0123 or
800-422-3861; www.usairwaysvacations.com), offer air/land packages.
Several big online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Site59,
and Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re
unsure about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the Better
Business Bureau in the city where the company is based, or go online to
www.bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based, take your
business elsewhere.
Remember that the escorted-tour operators discussed earlier also offer
packages. For example, Italiatour (% 800-845-3365; www.italiatour.
com) specializes in packages for independent travelers who ride from
one destination to another by train or rental car. Another recommended
packager is Kemwell (% 800-678-0678; www.kemwell.com).

A
fter you arrive in Italy, chances are you’ll want to explore the coun-
try a bit. Here is all the information you’ll need to travel through-
out Italy, plus a few tips for choosing the type of transportation that best
suits your plans. We also provide a comparison of travel times between
major destinations using different modes of transportation.
In Italy, you can get virtually anywhere via public transportation — and
quite easily: Where the air and train system stops, the bus system takes
over, and gets you into even the smallest hamlets in the countryside,
with at least a few runs per day. The largest towns and cities are con-
nected so seamlessly — with buses, planes, and trains leaving every few
minutes — that not using public transportation is foolish unless you
have special reasons to need a car.
By Plane
Air travel is no longer — or not necessarily — the most expensive way of
getting from one destination to another within Italy. It also has the added
advantage of being fast, especially if you want to travel from one tip of
the peninsula to the other. Alitalia (% 800-223-5730 in the U.S., 800-361-
8336 in Canada, 020-7602-7111 in London, 0990-448-259 in the rest of the
U.K., 1300-653-747 or 1300-653-757 in Australia, and toll-free 1478-65643
or 06-65643 in Italy; www.alitalia.it or www.alitaliausa.com), the
national Italian carrier, offers flights to every destination in the country.
Other great resources are Air Sicilia (% 06-650171046), which flies to
Sicily from a number of Italian towns; Air One (% 199-207080 within
Italy, or 06-4888069; www.flyairone.it); and Meridiana (% 0789-
52682; www.meridiana.it).
When traveling on domestic flights in Italy, you can get a 30 percent dis-
count if you take a flight that departs at night.

ferent modes of transportation.

By Train
Train travel in Italy is affordable and fast, and trains serve practically
every destination. Trains are the best choice for medium-distance trips,
and have the added advantage of extreme flexibility and convenience —
you depart and arrive right from the center of town, not from a distant air-
port. To research how well your chosen destinations are served by rail,
see the “Train Routes through Italy” map on the inside front cover of this
book. You can check with Trenitalia (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it),
the national train service, for all destinations and prices.
If you are planning a lot of train travel, you may be interested in purchas-
ing the Carta Rail Plus — sold online at www.trenitalia.it and at all
train stations in Europe — which grants a 25 percent discount on train
tickets to almost anywhere within Europe; the card is valid for one year
and costs 45€ ($54) for adults and 20€ ($24) for youths and seniors.
Obviously, the more and farther you travel, the better the deal. You’ll still
need to make reservations, and surcharges may apply for the express
Eurostar trains. You can also buy rail passes before you leave the United
States through a travel agent or Rail Europe (% 877-257-2887 in the U.S.,
800-361-RAIL in Canada; www.raileurope.com). The official U.S. represen-
tative of the Italian national rail company is CIT Tours, 15 W. 44th St., Suite
104, New York, NY 10036 (% 800-845-3365; http://cit-tours.com).
Chapter 7: Getting Around Italy 73

By Bus
The bus (coach) network is very extensive in Italy, and buses connect
even the most remote hamlets in the country. They are a good way to
reach destinations that are not on a direct train line. We list bus compa-
nies throughout this book for those destinations where taking a bus
makes sense. You won’t see too many tourists on buses, which is good if
you want to meet local people and get a feeling for what life is really like
in Italy. It’s not like the U.S. or England, where you could sit there in a
clown suit and everyone would be too “polite” to speak to you. Italians
will ask you who you are, where you’re from, and where you’re going.
And if you invest just a few hours in familiarizing yourself with Italian
(through Italian For Dummies, for example), you may be able to give
some interesting answers.
Be sure to check schedules in advance — they change frequently.
Tickets must be bought at the bus station; drivers don’t have the cash 
to make change. Do not plan on using the bus to hit several small towns
in a day — the bus schedules usually won’t allow for it. The system is
meant not for tourists, but for people who need to commute between
the small towns where they live and the larger towns of the area. To see
five little countryside villages in a day requires a car.
By Ferry
With over 4,600 miles of Italian coastline, ferries are an excellent
resource, particularly to explore many destinations in the Neapolitan
area — Capri, Sorrento, and the Amalfi Coast (see Chapter 20) — and
Sicily (see Chapters 21 and 22).
If you want to bring your car on a ferry, you must make a reservation
well in advance — especially during high season. Taking your car on a
ferry also means you’ll have to pay more. In some cases, you may save
money by renting your car on arrival rather than taking it on a ferry.
By Car
While we definitely do not recommend driving between major towns in
Italy (you’ll do much better via public transportation), and driving in
major towns and cities is pure madness, driving through the Italian
countryside may be appealing. Here are a few things to keep in mind:
 In order to drive in Italy, you’ll need to get an International Driver’s
License before leaving home. In the United States and Canada, you
can do so at any branch of AAA (% 800-222-1134 in the U.S., 613-
247-0117 in Canada; www.aaa.com) by filling out a form and provid-
ing a 2-×-2-inch photograph of yourself, a photocopy of your U.S.
driver’s license, and $10. Don’t forget to bring your U.S. license with
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
74

you in Italy, however, because the international license is valid only
in combination with your regular license. An alternative to the
International Driver’s License is to take an Italian translation of
your U.S. license (prepared by AAA or another organization) to an
office of the Automobile Club d’Italia (% 06-4477 for 24-hour
information and assistance) in Italy to receive a special driving
permit.
 Renting a car will be more expensive than what you’re used to back
home (see later in this section for a few tips), plus you’ll have to
consider fuel (at over $7 a gallon), hefty highway tolls, parking, car
theft, and an aggressive driving style.
 Driving rules are different here (see the sidebar later in this chap-
ter). We recommend that you: 1) drive defensively, and 2) always
be ready to get out of the way. It’s a myth that Italians drive badly.
Italians love to drive; however, there’s a reason why the Ferrari, the
Maserati, and the Lamborghini are Italian cars — Italians love to
drive fast. You could be going a respectable 60 mph when someone
zooms up from behind, going 100 mph and flashing his lights (a per-
fect time to apply Rule #2, above). Italians do, however, follow the
rules of the road and are usually skilled drivers (they need to be or
they’d get killed).
 Road signs are also different. For example, you may see first a
green and then a blue sign for the same destination: The first indi-
cates the autostrada (high-speed, limited-access toll road), the
second the local road. Once on the autostrada, keep your eyes
peeled for exits (each marked Uscita): They’re often indicated on
the highway far in advance, and then right on top of the ramp —
not a few hundred yards in advance, where it’s helpful. On local
roads and in town, the puzzling sign with a white arrow on a blue
circle points you to the lane that you should enter or the correct
way around an obstacle, a traffic island, and so forth. When you
want to park, look for the blue-and-red circle with a diagonal stripe:
The stripe points to the side of the street where you can’t park. If
the sign shows two stripes (an X), you can’t park on either side of
the street. The oblong blue-and-white Senso Unico sign indicates a
one-way street.
 Even Italians dread driving in and near big cities and towns —
Naples, Rome, and Milan are particularly notorious — not only
because of the intricate network of roads, but also due to the con-
stant traffic, the aggressive driving style, and the impossibility of
finding parking. If you’re planning to rent a car, we recommend that
you do so from the airport, before or after your visit to a major city;
you won’t need a car during your stay in town.
 Local gas stations close for lunch and shut down all day on Sunday
(except along the autostrada), so don’t let your gas gauge get too
low, especially if you’re cruising the rural countryside.
Chapter 7: Getting Around Italy 75

 If you do rent a car, remember that Italian cars are small (even the
big ones are never larger than an American midsize, and the trunk
has half the capacity) and are standard shift. (You can get an auto-
matic, but you will pay a surcharge and must reserve in advance, as
they are not very common.)
 Car thefts and break-ins are widespread. Never leave your car unat-
tended, always lock up, take out all your valuable items, and never
leave luggage in a car unless it’s parked in a small, manned garage.
 Finally, make sure you have a good road map: The best are pub-
lished by the Automobile Club d’Italia and the Italian Touring Club
and are widely available in bookstores and at newsstands in Italy. A
lot of highway construction is going on in Italy, so maps change
often.
Go online to comparison-shop for car rentals. You can check rates at
most of the major car-rental agencies’ Web sites (see Appendix A for a list
of agencies operating in Italy). All the major travel sites — Travelocity
(www.travelocity.com), Expedia (www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.
orbitz.com), and Smarter Living (www.smarterliving.com), for 
example — have search engines that can dig up discounted car-rental
rates. If you are planning to travel by a combination of train and car,
check with Trenitalia (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it), the national
train service, for special car-rental and train package offers.
In addition to the basic car-rental charges, the Collision Damage Waiver
(CDW) requires you to pay for damage to the car in a collision. Rental-
car companies also offer extra liability insurance (if you harm others in
an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm yourself or your
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
76
The rules of the road
The following rules are rigidly obeyed everywhere in Italy:
Rule 1: Pass only on the left.
Rule 2: Never stay in the passing lane: Pull out, pass, and get back in the slow lane
right away.
Rule 3: When you’re entering a highway or any major road from a minor road and you
have a sign to yield, you do have to yield. Often this means stopping and waiting for the
merging lane to become available. Do not assume people will move over — they won’t
(often they can’t, as there’s always someone coming from behind at over 100 mph in
the fast lane). The same is true when you come out of a gas station or rest area.
Rule 4: At regular intersections, the person on the right always has the right of way,
unless otherwise indicated; in traffic circles, the cars already in the circle have prior-
ity over those trying to enter.

passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your luggage is stolen
from your car). Your insurance policy on your car at home probably
covers most of these unlikely occurrences, and unless you are carrying
the Hope diamond, you probably don’t need luggage coverage. However,
if your own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have
auto insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your
car-rental agent for more information). Also, check with your credit-card
company, as it may cover some of the above.
In Italy, most rental companies will require that you pay for theft protec-
tion insurance, as car theft is unfortunately common here. Although
many credit cards cover you for damage to a rental car, check with your
company to see if your card’s benefit extends outside the United States.

T
raveling to a foreign country can be romantic and exciting, but when
we’re ready for a well-deserved slumber, we like the comforts we’ve
grown accustomed to. Although the hotel industry in Italy has made
enormous progress toward standardization and upgrading of lodgings, in
line with the expectations of international travelers, there are still cul-
tural differences that are hard to iron out — and why not, since the fun
of traveling also means experiencing a different culture. That’s not to say
you shouldn’t be comfortable, though. Here we give you the lowdown 
on what to expect in your Italian bedroom, along with plenty of tips on
choosing from among a wide, and in some cases unfamiliar, variety of
choices.
Getting to Know Your Options
Italy offers a huge choice of accommodations, from very basic to
supremely elegant. You’ll find everything from romantic 15th-century
hostels to international chains, from perfectly restored medieval towers
and castles to 17th-century frescoed palazzi, from simple 19th-century
farmhouses to ultra-modern luxury hotels, and from mom-and-pop
places to the haunts of jet-setters. Travelers have journeyed to Italy for
the past 3,000 years (at least), so more than a few inns can claim several
centuries of service and make tradition their selling point. In contrast, a
lot of newer options focus instead on sleek modern touches or immacu-
late refurbishing of historic buildings. With such a variety, you’ll cer-
tainly find what you need, but keep in mind a few differences:

 Because medieval and Renaissance buildings were not designed for
elevators, these are rare — and altogether absent in the cheaper
hotels — and often start from a landing above street level. Steps
are ubiquitous, so if they’re a problem for you, make sure to call
and ask.
 Amenities that are commonplace in the United States — big ice
machines, for instance — are virtually unknown in Italy (you will
find, though, a small refrigerator in all hotel rooms in the superior
category); others, such as air-conditioning and satellite TV — 
necessary to view English-language programs — are now more the
rule than the exception, although you may have to pay extra for
them in smaller and cheaper hotels (we spell this out in our write-
ups). By the way, regular TVs are standard in all hotel rooms, but
they don’t offer English-language programs. Then again, you didn’t
go to Italy to watch TV, did you? And you can always step out of
your hotel and sit at the terrace of a nearby cafe for that iced drink.
 Soundproof rooms are commonplace — and even in the cheaper
hotels, the thickness of the old walls helps protect you from noisy
neighbors and the roar of traffic outside. Street noise, by the way, is
a problem that soundproof windows cannot eliminate if you like to
sleep with your window open. If that is the case, ask for an inner
room.
 Smoking has recently been banned from public places in Italy, so 
all hotel lobbies and breakfast rooms are smoke-free. Guest rooms,
however, are considered private; hence, you are allowed to smoke
there. Make sure to specify whether you want a smoke-free room
when you make your reservation.
 In general, rooms — especially bathrooms — tend to be smaller
than what you’re used at home. Space is at a premium, especially in
the palaces within historic districts — which is where you usually
want to be — and only the most expensive hotels can offer sizable
bedrooms and bathrooms. To meet the increasing demand for
ensuite facilities, many cheaper hotels (two stars and below; see
later for more on this) have shoehorned bathrooms into the guest
rooms, and the result is far from satisfactory: It’s not at all unusual
for the shower to be a wall fixture with a curtain around it (not a
door) and a drain directly below it in the tiny bathroom’s tiled
floor. The hotels we list all have decent-size bathrooms and real
showers.
 The majority of hotels in Italy have only one kind of bed — a large
twin. In a double room, you usually find two separate twin beds. 
If you ask for a double bed, they will put together the two twins,
making the bed up tight with sheets. You may find this practice
unusual at first, but you’ll discover that it’s not uncomfortable. 
On the plus side, most hotels in Italy, and certainly all the ones in
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 79

our listings, are proud of the quality of their bedding and provide
good mattresses with a medium degree of firmness. 
 The breakfast generally included in your room rate is a continental
breakfast. Although an increasing number of hotels offer a buffet
with a variety of choices to meet the demands of foreign visitors,
eggs and hot dishes are served only at the most expensive hotels.
The usual continental buffet includes a choice of breads, jams, and
fruit; sometimes cakes; and usually cereals, yogurt, cheese, and
cold cuts. Sometimes you can order — and pay extra for — eggs
and bacon if they aren’t on the spread.
 One more thing: When you make a hotel reservation back home,
you probably don’t think to ask about the flooring. In Italy, you’ll
often find tile or marble floors, sometimes wood, and only rarely
carpeting. So bring slippers in the cooler months if you don’t want
to get cold feet!
All hotels in Italy are government-rated according to a strict set of rules
and specifications. The system is quite reliable, as hotels are regularly
inspected. The rating goes from one star for the most modest hotel — a
basic room with a comfortable bed, a TV, and a shared small bathroom —
to five stars for the most elegant, with an L added for extra luxury (such
as palatial accommodations with state-of-the-art bathrooms). A pensione
is below a hotel: a small, family-run hostel offering rooms with a bed and
little else. A bed-and-breakfast is a room in a private house and can range
from palatial to spartan. In the countryside, you can opt for agriturismo: a
room in a working farmhouse, where you’ll be served meals prepared
almost exclusively with ingredients produced on the farm. In this cate-
gory, too, accommodations range from palatial (for example, on famous
wine-producing estates) to simple (but usually always very nice). They
often feature swimming pools and outdoor activities.
Throughout this book, we list our favorite hotels, using cleanliness, com-
fort, and the most amenities at the best prices as essential criteria. We
use a system of dollar signs to indicate the price categories. Table 8-1,
below, explains the price scale used in this book and what you can
expect to get for your money in each category.

to lavish bathrooms, gyms, spas, ter-

Usually an American-style breakfast is
included. You’re staying not only in luxury,
but also style.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
One striking characteristic in Italy is that most hotels are private busi-
nesses, don’t belong to a chain, and are often still family-run, including
in the super-luxury category. Some may belong to a hotel association —
which fixes standards, gives a common approach, or simply allows some
economies of scale — while others may belong to a group of investors.
This means that room hunting follows different rules. Following are
some tips on reserving your room and cutting your costs.
Finding the best rate
The “rack rate” is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. The
rack rate is the price you’d get if you walked in off the street at the peak
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 81

of high season, when the hotel is nearly full, and asked for a room for 
the night. You see this rate printed on the fire/emergency-exit diagrams
posted on the back of room doors. We quote the rack rate for each of
our hotel listings throughout this book, but it doesn’t mean that’s the
rate you’ll have to pay.
Sometimes getting a better rate is surprisingly simple: Ask for a cheaper
or discounted rate. You may be pleasantly surprised. 
Rates are also lower — by up to 50 percent — during low and shoulder
seasons, when the hotel occupancy goes down (see Chapter 3).
If your hotel belongs to a chain, you’ll usually get the lowest rate
through a travel agent, online reservations service (see later), or pack-
age deal with your airline (see Chapter 6). (This is because the hotel
often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her busi-
ness toward that hotel.) Reserving a room through the chain’s toll-free
number may also result in a lower rate than calling the hotel directly.
Privately owned hotels, by contrast, do only moderate business with
travel agencies and reservations Web sites. You’ll often get a better dis-
count by contacting the hotel directly or through its Web site (and be
treated much better upon arrival). 
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or by going through an independent
booking agency (or a fare-service agency like Priceline). 
In Italy, booking through the hotel’s own Web site is definitely the way 
to go: Many private hotels have started to offer special Internet rates,
which are often even cheaper than what an agency can offer (because
the hotel saves the agency fee). Some also offer significant discounts for
advance booking, provided that you pay in advance. If you don’t want to
search the hotels yourself, use one of the Internet agencies below and
then go straight to the Web site of the hotel you’ve selected: You’ll often
find that you can do better. (For hotels belonging to a chain, however,
this is not always the case.)
Online hotel agencies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late,
competing for the business of millions of consumers surfing for accom-
modations around the world. This competitiveness can be a boon to
consumers who have the patience and time to shop and compare the
Internet agencies for good deals — but shop they must, for prices can
vary considerably from site to site. And keep in mind that hotels at the
top of a site’s listing may be there for no other reason than that they
paid money to get the placement. Among the numerous Web sites, the
best is Venere Net (www.venere.com), which is very comprehensive
and user-friendly. You may also want to check out Giroscopio.com
(www.giroscopio.com), Hoteldiscount!com (www.180096hotel.com),
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
82

Italyhotels (www.italyhotelink.com), Welcome to Italy (www.wel.it),
Europa Hotels (www.europa-hotels.com), and Italy Hotels (www.
hotels-in-italy.com). For last-minute reservations LateRooms.com
(www.it.laterooms.com) works well. Other interesting sites are InItaly
(www.initaly.com) and Italy Guide (www.italyguide.com).
Most international sites tend to feature only a few hotels in Italy. Still,
some may offer good deals, so it’s worth checking just in case. Expedia
offers special deals and “virtual tours” or photos of available rooms —
allowing you to see what you’re paying for (a feature that helps counter
the claims that the best rooms are often held back from bargain Web
sites). Travelocity posts frank customer reviews and ranks its proper-
ties according to the AAA rating system. Hotels.com is also reliable and
easy to use. InnSite.com, which includes listings of B&Bs in Rome,
shows descriptions written by the innkeepers (it’s free to get listed), 
pictures of the rooms, and prices and availability.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline and Hotwire are even better
for hotels than for airfares; with both, you’re allowed to pick the neigh-
borhood and quality level of your hotel — but that’s all — before offer-
ing up your money. Priceline’s hotel product is much better at getting
five-star lodging for three-star prices than at finding anything at the
bottom of the scale. On the downside, many hotels stick Priceline guests
in their least desirable rooms. Before bidding on Priceline, make sure to
go to BiddingForTravel.com, which features a fairly up-to-date list of
hotels that Priceline uses in major cities, including Italian ones. For both
Priceline and Hotwire, you pay upfront, and the fee is nonrefundable.
Note: Some hotels do not provide loyalty program credits or points or
other frequent-stay amenities when you book a room through opaque
online services.
If you use one of these online booking services, remember to always get
a confirmation number and make a printout of any transaction. In fact,
after you’ve reserved your room, it doesn’t hurt to contact your hotel
and request a faxed confirmation (make sure you bring this with you to
Italy) to eliminate the chance of your checking into a hotel that suddenly
says it has no record of your reservation.
Reserving the best room
First and foremost, make your reservations well ahead of time (months
in advance for the most sought-after destinations), especially if you
decide to stay in a small hotel: The best rooms are the first to go. And
ask for a large and quiet room, specifying all the characteristics that are
important to you.
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room in the
house. Requesting a corner room (usually larger, quieter, and brighter
than standard rooms in modern, square buildings) doesn’t necessarily
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 83

pay off in Italy, where so many hotels are housed in historic buildings,
and where corner rooms might actually be smaller and darker.
The prevalence of old buildings raises another issue: renovations.
Always ask if the hotel is renovating; if it is, request a room away from
the renovation work. Inquire, too, about the location of elevators, restau-
rants, and bars in the hotel — all sources of annoying noise. If the hotel
is on a busy street, request a room away from the street.
And finally, remember that if you aren’t happy with your room when you
arrive, you can talk to the front desk about moving to another one. If
another room is available, they should be happy to accommodate you,
within reason.
Renting Apartments and Villas
If you plan to stay in one place for a week or more, or if you are traveling
with children, renting a house or apartment makes a lot of sense. The
easiest way to do so is to contact an agency. 
Most of the Internet agencies listed earlier in this chapter also maintain
apartment and B&B listings. Other agencies to try include Hideaways
International, 767 Islington St., Portsmouth, NH 03801 (% 800-843-4433;
www.hideaways.com); At Home Abroad, 405 E. 56th St., Suite 6H, New
York, NY 10022 (% 212-421-9165; Fax: 212-533-0095); and Rentals in Italy,
700 E. Main St., Ventura, CA 93001 (% 800-726-6702 or 805-641-1650; www.
rentvillas.com).
Vacation Rentals by Owner (www.vrbo.com) has hundreds of listings
(in English) of homes for rent. Each listing contains pictures, prices, 
and descriptions of the area where the house or apartment is located.
Usually you deal directly with the owner, thus you may save consider-
ably over the rates that would be charged for the same property by a
broker.
To rent something really ritzy, like a palazzo or castle, your best bet is
Abitare la Storia, Località L’Amorosa, 53048 Sinalunga (% 0577-679-
683; www.abitarelastoria.it), an association based near Siena.
Another option — a favorite with Italians — is agriturismo (staying on a
working farm or former farm somewhere in the countryside). Rates usu-
ally include breakfast and at least one other meal (your choice of dinner
or lunch), prepared with ingredients produced on the farm or by nearby
local small farms. Among the multiplying online agencies, the best is
Agriturismo.it (www.agriturismo.it).

E
very traveler is a special traveler, but bringing kids along on your
trip to Italy, or traveling alone as a single woman, or trying to find or
arrange for wheelchair accessibility, all require extra care and thought.
Seniors may be interested in special programs and activities; gays and
lesbians may wonder how friendly and welcoming Italy will be. All these
issues are considered in this chapter.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
We love traveling throughout Italy with children — both our own and
those of friends and family. Italy has a very family-oriented culture,
which makes it much easier to travel here with your kids. In fact, Italians
love children, and most people will smile at you and your children or
even talk to them in public spaces. You’ll find that people — including
staff in hotels and restaurants — are usually ready to help you out in
most situations and accommodate your special needs. They do frown
upon tantrums, whining, and other outbursts, however. (Italian children
are used to going everywhere with their parents, and behave appropri-
ately most of the time.)
We also find that Italy is an easy destination for children because there
are so many attractions to choose from — you’re sure to find something
that will please even the most difficult child (we make reservations
about teenagers, though, since sometimes just nothing pleases them).
Our strategy is to alternate: one thing that interests us and one that
interests our child (in our case, playgrounds, children’s museums, or
outdoor activities) per day. It helps if you talk to your kids beforehand

about your destinations and the special things in store for them. Italian
history is so rich that you’ll find many ways to keep your child inter-
ested while preparing for your trip. Involve your children in the planning
and go over the list of sights and activities in the areas on your itinerary,
particularly noting those labeled with the Kid Friendly icon in this book.
Let your kids make their own list of things they want to do. Older chil-
dren can research Italy on the Internet (see Appendix A for a list of Web
sites worth checking out).
The one hump you’ll face is if you don’t want to have your child with
you at all times. Italy doesn’t have a major infrastructure of day-care 
and child-care services (see “Quick Concierge” in Appendix A for more
about baby sitting); in fact, finding a hotel with day-care service can be
difficult. If this is one of your needs, be sure to make arrangements
through your hotel ahead of time. Usually the concierge will be able to
help you find a baby-sitting service, even if the hotel doesn’t formally
offer child care.
The only thing you’ll really need for your children is a passport (see
Chapter 10), but you may want to check out some further resources:
 Familyhostel (% 800-733-9753) takes the whole family, including
kids 8 to 15, on moderately priced domestic and international
learning vacations. Lectures, field trips, and sightseeing are guided
by a team of academics.
 You can find good family-oriented vacation advice at Family 
Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com) and Traveling

offers an online magazine and a directory of off-the-beaten-path
tours and tour operators for families.
 How to Take Great Trips with Your Kids (The Harvard Common
Press) is full of good general advice that can apply to travel 
anywhere.
 Another good resource, Family Travel Times (% 888-822-4FTT
or 212-477-5524; www.familytraveltimes.com), is published six
times a year and includes a weekly call-in service for subscribers.
Subscriptions are $39 per year for quarterly editions.
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
In general, Italy accords older people a great deal of respect, probably
because of the continued existence of the extended family as well as the
nature of the Italian language (polite forms of address are to be used
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
86

when speaking with someone older than yourself). Therefore, you’re
unlikely to encounter ageism.
Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277
or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels, airfares, and
car rentals. AARP offers a wide range of benefits, including AARP: The
Magazine and a monthly newsletter. Anyone over 50 can join.
Being a senior entitles you to some terrific travel bargains. Many reliable
agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market. Elderhostel 
(% 877-426-8056; www.elderhostel.org) arranges study programs for
those 55 and over (and a spouse or companion of any age) in more than
80 countries around the world. Most courses last five to seven days in
the United States (two to four weeks abroad), and many include airfare,
accommodations in university dormitories or modest inns, meals, and
tuition. ElderTreks (% 800-741-7956; www.eldertreks.com) offers
small-group tours to off-the-beaten-path or adventure-travel locations,
restricted to travelers 50 and older.
Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts for
seniors include the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.travel
50andbeyond.com); Travel Unlimited: Uncommon Adventures for the
Mature Traveler (Avalon); 101 Tips for Mature Travelers, available
from Grand Circle Travel (% 800-221-2610 or 617-350-7500; www.gct.
com); The 50+ Traveler’s Guidebook (St. Martin’s Press); and
Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures That You
Absolutely Can’t Get Unless You’re Over 50 (McGraw-Hill).
Senior discounts on admission at theaters, museums, and public trans-
portation are subject to reciprocity between countries. Because the
United States hasn’t signed the bilateral agreement (you discount us and
we’ll discount you), Americans aren’t eligible for senior discounts in
Italy. (The same rule applies to the under-17 discount.) All discounts 
do apply if you’re a citizen of a European Union country.
Accessing Italy: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Italy is rapidly catching up on accessibility issues, even though it is
faced with unique logistical difficulties: It is sometimes impossible to
retrofit medieval or older buildings with elevators and ramps. Often the
problem has been solved with separate entrances, but you usually need
to be met there by an attendant — thus we recommend you always call
ahead to make an appointment. Public transportation reserves spaces
for the disabled, but not all buses on all lines have been upgraded, and a
few subway stations are simply not accessible to wheelchairs. For the
Chapter 9: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 87

blind, special grooves in the sidewalk have been provided in major
towns, and a number of street lights have been equipped with sound 
signals.
You can avoid some of the accessibility problems by joining a tour that
caters specifically to your needs. Many travel agencies offer customized
tours and itineraries for travelers with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel
(% 507-451-5005; www.flyingwheelstravel.com) offers escorted
tours and cruises that emphasize sports, as well as private tours in 
minivans with lifts. Access-Able Travel Source (% 303-232-2979; www.
access-able.com) offers extensive access information and advice 
for traveling around the world with disabilities. Accessible Journeys
(% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339; www.disabilitytravel.com) caters
to wheelchair travelers and their families and friends.
Avis Rent a Car’s “Avis Access” program offers such services as a dedi-
cated 24-hour toll-free number (% 888-879-4273) for customers with
special travel needs; special car features such as swivel seats, spinner
knobs, and hand controls; and accessible bus service.
Organizations that offer assistance to disabled travelers include the
Moss Rehab Hospital (www.mossresourcenet.org), which provides a
library of accessible-travel resources online, and SATH, the Society for
Accessible Travel & Hospitality (% 212-447-7284; www.sath.org;
annual membership fees: $45 adults, $30 seniors and students), which
offers a wealth of travel resources for all types of disabilities and
informed recommendations on destinations, access guides, travel
agents, tour operators, vehicle rentals, and companion services. The
American Foundation for the Blind (% 800-232-5463; www.afb.org)
provides information on traveling with Seeing Eye dogs.

Twin Peaks Press (% 360-694-2462) offers travel-related books for travel-
ers with special needs.
Following the Rainbow: Resources 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Italy is a tolerant country, and violent displays of intolerance such as
gay bashing are extremely unusual. As in the United States, there is an
active gay and lesbian movement that is trying to raise public conscious-
ness about prejudice and discrimination.
All major towns and cities have an active gay culture — especially
Florence, Rome, and Milan, which considers itself the gay capital of Italy
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
88

and is the headquarters of ARCI–Gay/ARCI– Lesbica (www.arcigay.it),
the country’s leading gay organization with branches throughout Italy. Its
Web site has an English version. The Tuscany branch can be found at
www.gaytoscana.it; for Rome, visit www.arcigay.it/roma. ARCI–Gay
also has offices in Siena (% 0577-288-977; www.gaysiena.it) and Pisa
(% 050-555-618).
Capri is the gay resort of Italy, rivaled only by the gay beaches of Venice
and Taormina. The first-ever World Pride event was held in Rome in July
2000, to coincide with the Jubilee celebrations.
The International Gay & Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA) (% 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org), the trade association for the
gay and lesbian travel industry, offers an online directory of gay- and 
lesbian-friendly travel businesses; go to its Web site and click on
“Consumer Site.”
Making the Grade: Advice 
for Student Travelers
If you’re a student planning a trip to Italy, get an International Student
Identity Card (ISIC), which offers substantial savings on rail passes,
plane tickets, and entrance fees. It also provides you with basic health
and life insurance and a 24-hour help line. The card is available for $22
from STA Travel (% 800-781-4040, or check online for a local number in
your country; www.statravel.com), the biggest student travel agency
in the world. If you’re no longer a student but are still under 26, you can
get an International Youth Travel Card (IYTC) for the same price from
the same people, which entitles you to some discounts (but not on
museum admissions). (Note: In 2002, STA Travel bought competitors
Council Travel and USIT Campus after they went bankrupt. Some offices
still operate under the Council name, but are owned by STA.)
Travel CUTS (% 800-667-2887 or 416-614-2887; www.travelcuts.com)
offers similar services for residents of both Canada and the U.S. Irish
students should turn to USIT (% 01-602-1600; www.usitnow.ie).

f you think that having a destination, an itinerary, and a ticket in hand
is enough to travel, think again: There are still a lot of details to take
care of. In this chapter, we help you tie up all the loose ends.
Getting a Passport
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around
the world. You can’t cross an international border without it. Getting a
passport is easy, though: Just follow the steps below.
Keep in mind that losing your passport may be worse than losing your
money. Why? Because a passport shows (and proves to authorities) that
you are you. Safeguard your passport in an inconspicuous, inaccessible
place like a money belt. Always carry a photocopy of your passport with
you and keep it in a separate pocket or purse. If you lose your passport,
visit the nearest consulate of your native country as soon as possible for
a replacement.
Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a first-time passport in the U.S., follow these steps:
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport office;
a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office (you can
download the form online; see below).

2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship. (Bringing
along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or social security
card is also a good idea.)
3. Submit two identical passport-size photos, measuring 2-×-2-inches
in size. You can often find businesses that take these photos near a
passport office. Note: You can’t use a strip from a photo-vending
machine.
4. Pay a fee. For people 16 and over, a passport is valid for ten years
and costs $85. For those 15 and under, a passport is valid for five
years and costs $70.
Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; processing
normally takes three weeks, but can take longer during busy periods
(especially spring).
If you already have a passport in your current name that was issued
within the past 15 years (and you were over 16 when it was issued), you
can renew the passport by mail for $55.
Whether you’re applying in person or by mail, you can download pass-
port applications from the U.S. State Department Web site at http://
travel.state.gov, where you can also get general information and
find your regional passport office; alternatively, call the National
Passport Information Center (% 877-487-2778 or 202-647-0518) for
automated information.
Applying for other passports
Australians can visit a local post office or passport office, call the
Australia Passport Information Service (% 131-232 toll-free in Australia),
or log on to www.passports.gov.au for details on how and where to
apply.
Canadians can pick up applications at passport offices throughout
Canada, at post offices, or from the central Passport Office, Department
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G3 (% 800-
567-6868; www.ppt.gc.ca). Applications must be accompanied by two
identical passport-sized photographs and proof of Canadian citizenship.
Processing takes five to ten days if you apply in person, or about three
weeks by mail.
New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New Zealand
Passports Office or download it online. Call the Passports Office
(% 0800-225-050 in New Zealand, or 04-474-8100) or log on to www.
passports.govt.nz for more information.
United Kingdom residents can pick up applications for a standard ten-
year passport (five-year passport for children under 16) at passport
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 91

offices, major post offices, or travel agencies. For information, contact
the United Kingdom Passport Service (% 0870-521-0410; www.ukpa.
gov.uk).
When you get your passport photos taken, get six to eight photos total if
you’re planning to also apply for an International Driver’s License and an
international student or teacher ID, which may entitle you to discounts
at museums. Take the extra photos with you: You may need one for
random reasons on the road, and if — heaven forbid — you ever lose
your passport, you can use them for a replacement request.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, but expect to pay between 5 and 8 percent of the
vacation itself. Here is our advice on all three:
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip or go home early, or if your travel sup-
plier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can range
from sickness to natural disasters to the State Department declar-
ing your destination unsafe for travel, but not vague fears caused
by airplane crashes and the like. Protect yourself further by paying
for the insurance with a credit card — by law, consumers can get
their money back on goods and services not received if they report
the loss within 60 days after the charge is listed on their credit-card
statement.
 Medical insurance may be necessary for some travelers, since
most health plans (including Medicare and Medicaid) do not pro-
vide coverage for travel overseas, and the ones that do often
require you to pay for services upfront and reimburse you only
after you return home. Even if your plan does cover overseas treat-
ment, most out-of-country hospitals make you pay your bills
upfront, and send you a refund only after you’ve returned home
and filed the necessary paperwork with your insurance company.
As a safety net, you may want to buy travel medical insurance; try
MEDEX Assistance (% 410-453-6300; www.medexassist.com) or
Travel Assistance International (% 800-821-2828; www.travel
assistance.com; for general information on services, call the com-
pany’s Worldwide Assistance Services, Inc., at % 800-777-8710).
 Lost-luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On
international flights (including U.S. portions of international trips),
baggage coverage is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound, up
to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you plan to check items
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
92

more valuable than the standard liability, see if your valuables are
covered by your homeowner’s policy, get baggage insurance as
part of your comprehensive travel-insurance package, or buy
Travel Guard’s “BagTrak” product. Don’t buy insurance at the air-
port, as it’s usually overpriced. Be sure to take any valuables or
irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on luggage, as many
valuables (including books, money, and electronics) aren’t covered
by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing your bag’s contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.
For more information on insurance, contact one of the following recom-
mended companies: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.access
america.com), Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919; www.
travelguard.com), Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174;
www.travelinsured.com), and Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-
457-4602; www.travelex-insurance.com).
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart prob-
lems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour hot
line. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance to
Travelers (IAMAT; % 716-754-4883 in the U.S., 416-652-0137 in Canada;
www.iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries
you’re visiting, along with lists of local, English-speaking doctors. The
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-311-3435;
www.cdc.gov) provides up-to-date information on health hazards by
region or country and offers tips on food safety as well.
If you do get sick in Italy, ask the concierge at your hotel to recommend
a local doctor — even his or her own doctor, if necessary. If you can’t
locate a doctor, try contacting your embassy or consulate — they main-
tain lists of English-speaking doctors. In an emergency, dial % 113 for
the police: They can call an ambulance or help you in many ways. If your
situation is life-threatening, call % 118 for an ambulance, or rush to the
pronto soccorso (emergency department) at the local hospital.
Under the Italian national healthcare system, you’re eligible only for free
emergency care. If you’re admitted to a hospital as an in-patient, even
from an emergency department and as a result of an accident, you’re
required to pay (unless you are a resident of the European Economic
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 93

Area and are eligible for health insurance coverage). You’re also required
to pay for follow-up care. For the names, addresses, and phone numbers
of hospitals offering 24-hour emergency care, see the “Fast Facts” section
at the end of each destination chapter.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
Using a cellphone in Italy
If you’re from England, you’re lucky: Your phone already works in Italy. If
you’re from another continent, things are a little complicated: The three
letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities are GSM
(Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that makes for
easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and dozens of other
countries worldwide. In the U.S., T-Mobile, AT&T Wireless, and Cingular
use this quasi-universal system; in Canada, Microcell and some Rogers
customers are GSM; and all Europeans and most Australians use GSM.
If your cellphone is on a GSM system, and you have a world-capable
multiband phone such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung
models, you can make and receive calls across much of the globe. Just
call your wireless operator and ask for “international roaming” to be
activated on your account. Unfortunately, per-minute charges can be
high — usually $1 to $1.50 in Western Europe.
That’s why it’s important to buy an “unlocked” world phone from the
get-go. Many cellphone operators sell “locked” phones that restrict you
from using any other removable computer memory phone chip card
(called a SIM card) other than the ones they supply. Having an unlocked
phone allows you to install a cheap, prepaid SIM card (found at a local
retailer) in your destination country. (Show your phone to the salesper-
son; not all phones work on all networks.) You’ll get a local phone
number — and much, much lower calling rates. Getting an already
locked phone unlocked can be a complicated process, but it can be
done; just call your cellular operator and say you’ll be going abroad for
several months and want to use the phone with a local provider.

Avoiding “economy-class syndrome”
Deep vein thrombosis, or “economy-class syndrome” (as it’s known in the world of
flying), is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein. It’s a potentially deadly condition
that can be caused by sitting in cramped conditions — such as an airplane cabin —
for too long. During a flight (especially a long-haul one), get up, walk around, and
stretch your legs every 60 to 90 minutes to keep your blood flowing. Other preventa-
tive measures include frequent flexing of the legs while sitting, drinking lots of water,
and avoiding alcohol and sleeping pills.

For many, renting a phone is a good idea. While you can rent a phone
from any number of overseas sites, including kiosks at airports and at
car-rental agencies, renting the phone before you leave home may be a
good idea. That way you can give loved ones and business associates
your new number, make sure the phone works, and take the phone wher-
ever you go — especially helpful for overseas trips through several
countries. Phone rentals aren’t cheap: You’ll usually pay $40 to $50 per
week, plus airtime fees of at least a dollar a minute. On the other hand,
local rental companies in Europe often offer free incoming calls within
their home country, which can save you big bucks. Two good wireless
rental companies are InTouch USA (% 800-872-7626; www.intouch
global.com) and RoadPost (% 888-290-1606 or 905-272-5665; www.
roadpost.com). Give them your itinerary, and they’ll tell you what wire-
less products you’ll need. InTouch will also, for free, advise you on
whether your existing phone will work overseas; simply call % 703-222-
7161 between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. eastern standard time, or go to http://
intouchglobal.com/travel.htm.
In Italy, you don’t have to look for a place to rent a phone; you can make
the phone come to you. Rentacell (% 877-736-8355 in the U.S., or
39-02-8633-7799 in Italy; www.rentacell.com) will deliver a phone to
you anywhere for free. You can also pick it up in the U.S. before you
leave. Incoming calls are free. Easyline (% 800-010-600 in Italy) also
delivers phones for free.
Accessing the Internet away from home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Using your wireless-enabled PDA (personal digital
assistant) or laptop will give you the most flexibility, but Internet access
is so widespread nowadays that you really don’t need to carry the extra
weight of electronic equipment, unless you need it for work reasons.
Most hotels in Italy — in the mid-range and up — offer Internet access
from at least one computer, if not a Wi-Fi hot spot or even Internet
access through the TVs in each guest room. Sometimes this service is
free; sometimes you have to pay a small fee. Check with your hotel to
find out. Hotel business centers should be avoided, however, unless
you’re willing to pay exorbitant rates.
You’ll also find Internet cafes in almost every village, except the most
backward ones; just ask the concierge at your hotel (you can also check
www.cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com, but their listings are
not comprehensive). One of the leading global Internet-cafe chains is
easyInternetcafé (www.easyeverything.com), which currently has
franchises in Milan, Florence, and Rome; the company is rapidly expand-
ing, so by the time you read this there may well be more — check the
Web site for other locations. Even more prevalent is the Internet Train
(www.internettrain.it), which not only has multiple sites in the big
cities like Rome, Florence, and Milan, but also serves second-tier cities
like Verona, and even smaller towns like Greve in Chianti and Agrigento.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 95

Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gates. These kiosks, which you’ll also see in shopping malls, hotel
lobbies, and tourist information offices around the world, give you basic
Web access for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe
prices. The kiosks’ clunkiness and high prices mean they should be
avoided whenever possible.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet Service Provider (ISP) if it 
has a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If your
ISP doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free service from
mail2web (www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail.
For more flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based e-mail
account through a site like Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com).
Your home ISP may be able to forward your e-mail to the Web-based
account automatically.
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). It provides a Web-based inter-
face for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from anywhere —
even an Internet cafe — provided your “target” PC is on and has an
always-on connection to the Internet (such as with a cable modem). The
service offers top-quality security, but if you’re worried about hackers,
use your own laptop rather than a cybercafe computer to access the
GoToMyPC system.
If you’re bringing your own computer, the buzzword to familiarize your-
self with is Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) — more and more hotels, cafes, and
retailers are signing on as wireless “hot spots.” You can get Wi-Fi connec-
tion one of several ways. Many laptops sold in the last couple years have
built-in Wi-Fi capability (an 802.11b wireless Ethernet connection). Mac
owners have their own networking technology, Apple AirPort. For those
with older computers, an 802.11b/Wi-Fi card (around $50) can be
plugged into your laptop. You can sign up for wireless access service
much as you do cellphone service, through a plan offered by one of sev-
eral commercial companies that have made wireless service available in
airports, hotel lobbies, and coffee shops, primarily in the U.S. (followed by
the U.K. and Japan). T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/hotspot)
serves up wireless connections at more than 1,000 Starbucks coffee shops
in the U.S. Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com)
have set up networks in airports and high-class hotel lobbies. Best of all,
you don’t need to be staying at the Four Seasons to use the hotel’s net-
work; just set yourself up on a nice couch in the lobby. The companies’
pricing policies can be byzantine, with a variety of monthly, per-connec-
tion, and per-minute plans, but in general you pay around $30 a month —
and as more and more companies jump on the wireless bandwagon,
prices are likely to get even more competitive.
There are also places that provide free wireless networks in cities
around the world. To locate these free hot spots, go to www.personal
telco.net/index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Italy 
96

If Wi-Fi is not available at your destination, most business-class hotels
throughout the world offer dataports for laptop modems, and a few
thousand hotels in the U.S. and Europe now offer free high-speed
Internet access using an Ethernet network cable. You can bring your
own cables, but most hotels rent them for around $10. Call your hotel in
advance to see what your options are.
In addition, major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have local access
numbers around the world, allowing you to go online by simply placing
a local call. Check your ISP’s Web site or call its toll-free number and ask
how you can use your current account away from home — and how
much it will cost. If you’re traveling outside the reach of your ISP, the
iPass network has dial-up numbers in most of the world’s countries.
You’ll have to sign up with an iPass provider, which will then tell you
how to set up your computer for your destination(s). For a list of iPass
providers, go to www.ipass.com and click on “Individuals Buy Now.”
One solid provider is i2roam (www.i2roam.com; % 866-811-6209 or
920-235-0475).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
Keeping Up with Airline Security
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an air-
line employee and she may whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries, including Italy.)
In 2003, the TSA phased out gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And 
E-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. Passengers with 
E-tickets can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic
kiosks or even online check-in from a home computer. Online check-in
involves logging on to your airline’s Web site, accessing your reserva-
tion, and printing out your boarding pass. If you’re using a kiosk at the
airport, bring the credit card you used to book the ticket or your fre-
quent-flier card. Print out your boarding pass from the kiosk and simply
proceed to the security checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. If
you’re checking bags or looking to snag an exit-row seat, you will be able
to do so using most airline kiosks. Curbside check-in is also a good way
to avoid lines, although a few airlines still ban this practice; call before
you go.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 97

Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter than they were during 2001
and 2002, but some doozies remain. If you have trouble standing for long
periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline will provide a wheel-
chair. Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt
buckles. If you’ve got metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can
prevent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only
ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting
disabled passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t.
The general rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are okay, and
food and beverages must be passed through the X-ray machine — but
that security screeners can’t make you drink from your coffee cup. Bring
food in your carryon rather than checking it, as explosive-detection
machines used on checked luggage have been known to mistake food
(especially chocolate, for some reason) for bombs. Travelers in the U.S.
are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “personal item” such as a purse,
briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders can stuff all sorts of things
into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still considered a per-
sonal item. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued
a list of restricted items; check its Web site (www.tsa.gov) for details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. Travel Sentry certified locks (available at luggage and
travel shops, at Brookstone stores, or online at www.brookstone.com)
are approved by the TSA and can be opened by inspectors with a special
code or key. If you use something other than TSA-approved locks, your
lock will be cut off your suitcase if a hand-search is required.
Saving Time with Advance Reservations
Because of long lines during peak tourist periods, many museums in
Italy now offer advance ticketing. You can make reservations before 
you leave home (thus bypassing waits of up to three hours at the local
ticket booth). The list of museums for which you can make reservations
includes Rome’s Galleria Borghese (see Chapter 12); Florence’s Galleria
degli Uffizi and Galleria dell’Accademia (see Chapter 13); Venice’s
Palazzo Ducale and Gallerie dell’Accademia (see Chapter 16); and
Naples’s Museo di Capodimonte (see Chapter 18).

Part III
The Eternal City:
Rome

In this part . . . 
T
he seven hills of Rome have been continuously inhabited
for the past 3,000 years, so it’s not surprising that nowhere
else will you ﬁnd such cultural density and layering of periods
and styles. The treasures of Rome stretch from pre-Republic
ruins to Bernini’s baroque marvels to the stylish, convulsive
city depicted by Fellini in his famous movies. 
Chapter 11 provides everything you need to know to get to
Rome, orient yourself in the city, ﬁnd a comfortable place to
stay, and order a delicious meal. Included are rundowns of
the best hotels and the best restaurants. In Chapter 12, we
describe the major sites and activities — not only how to see
the Colosseum and the Vatican Museums, but also where to
shop and where to go for fun after dark.

A
rriving in a foreign city is always a challenge, and although Rome
isn’t one of the biggest cities in the world, it is large enough to 
be confusing, with its intricate street layout, thousands of hotels and
restaurants, and complex transportation system. The narrow and wind-
ing streets of the historic center are a maze even for Romans! Sit back
and relax — in this chapter, we provide all you need to negotiate the
Eternal City like a native.
Getting There
Getting to Rome is fairly straightforward: The city has two airports, is a
major train hub, and is served by highways from all directions. As the
old adage goes, “All roads lead to Rome.”
By air
Rome’s main airport, Leonardo da Vinci, is located in Fiumicino — this
is where you’re likely to land if you come by plane. Charter flights and
some European airlines also arrive in the smaller airport of Ciampino.
Navigating your way through passport control and Customs
If you’ve already landed in a country that is part of the Schengen
European Community (which includes Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden), then your passport has been
checked and only spot checks will be performed at the Italian border. If,
however, Rome is your first port of call in Europe, then you’ll have to line
up at passport control. Often you’ll find two lines: one for European
Union citizens and one for everyone else. After having your passport

checked and collecting your luggage, you must pass through Customs.
Items for personal use enter duty-free up to 175€ ($210) for each adult
and 90€ ($108) for each child under 15. In addition, adults can import a
maximum of 200 cigarettes (50 cigars), 1 liter (slightly more that 1 quart)
of liquor or 2 liters of wine, 50 grams of perfume, 500 grams (1 pound) of
coffee, and 100 grams (3 ounces) of tea; children are allowed only per-
fume. You cannot bring currency in excess of 10,329€ ($12,395 at press
time, though the dollar amount will depend on the conversion rate on the
day you travel). See “Quick Concierge” in Appendix A for Customs regula-
tions on what you can bring home. You can also find detailed information
at the Italian Customs Web site (www.agenziadogane.it).
As a foreigner, you’re required to have your passport with you at all
times, to prove both your identity and your legal status. We recommend
you either carry it in a safe place on your person (such as a document
pouch worn under your clothes), or leave the original in the safe at your
hotel and carry a photocopy.
Getting oriented at Fiumicino/Leonardo da Vinci
Though officially named after Leonardo, everybody refers to this airport
as Fiumicino (% 06-65951; www.adr.it), after the name of the nearby
town. The airport is compact and very well organized (but ever expand-
ing), with three terminals connected by a long corridor. Terminal A han-
dles domestic travel; Terminal B handles domestic and internal flights to
the Schengen European Community; and Terminal C manages all other
international flights. If you’re flying directly from a U.S. airport, Terminal
C is your likely point of entry; it is connected to a newer set of gates by a
cool monorail.
Don’t be concerned if you see police officers with submachine guns
walking around — due to recent world tensions, it’s now routine proce-
dure. Be aware, though, that the security forces at Fiumicino have terror-
ists in mind, not common thieves — that means you still have to watch
your belongings like a hawk, and don’t leave anything precious in your
checked luggage.
After exiting passport control and Customs, you enter the main con-
course, a long hall that connects all three terminals. Here’s where you’ll
find ATMs (one per terminal), 24-hour currency exchange machines, and
a cambio (exchange) office, open from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and located
just outside Customs in the international arrivals area.
If you’re using traveler’s checks, you may want to change them at the
cambio office — its rates are usually the best in town.
On your way out to ground transportation, you’ll find a very good
tourist information desk (% 06-65956074) that provides information
on Rome at one end and on the rest of Italy at the other. Nearby is a help
desk for last-minute hotel reservations — the service, however, doesn’t
cover all hotels in Rome. Public transportation — including taxis and
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
102

car-rental shuttle buses — is just outside along the sidewalk; the train
station is on the second floor of a building attached to the international
terminal.
Getting from the Fiumicino airport to your hotel
Fiumicino lies about 30km (18 miles) from Rome and is well connected
by highway, train, shuttle train, and bus.
The easiest way to get to your hotel is by taking a taxi: The line forms on
the curb just outside the terminals and is marked by a sign. Expect to
pay about 45€ ($54) for the 50-minute ride (well over an hour at rush
hour) for three adult passengers (only some taxis will accept four).
Beware of Gypsy cabdrivers who approach you as you exit the arrivals
gate: They will easily charge you double the regulated cab rates.
Regulation taxis are white with a checkered line on the sides, have a
meter, and wait at the regular stand.
Taking the shuttle train into Rome is equally simple — and a lot faster
during rush hour. If you have a lot of luggage, you can hire help at the
baggage-claim area for 2€ ($2.40) per item; they’ll take your bags to the
train. The railroad terminal is connected to the air terminal through 
a corridor on the second floor, just outside arrivals (follow the sign
marked TRENI). The best train is the Leonardo Express, a 35-minute shut-
tle ride to Termini (Rome’s central rail station); it runs daily every 30
minutes from 6:37 a.m. to 11:37 p.m. and costs 9.50€ ($11). Trains pull in
at a separate rail terminal inside Termini rail station, way at the back of
the regular gates. It is quite a hike to the main concourse, but you don’t
really need to get there: A taxi stand is downstairs (there’s an elevator)
and to the left of your arrival gate. Otherwise, take the moving sidewalk
located on the lower level, which connects the arrivals terminal with the
main concourse of Termini rail station.
There also is a cheaper local commuter train (look for trains with the
final destination Orte or Fara Sabina), which makes various stops along
Chapter 11: Settling into Rome 103
Taxi fares in Rome
The meter starts at 2.33€ ($2.80). It adds 1.29€ ($1.55) for every kilometer (2⁄3 mile) if
you’re moving at up to 20kmph (12 mph), and for every 85.3m (280 feet) if you’re going
faster. This rate decreases within the urban limits (G.R.A. highway) to 0.78€ (95¢) for
every kilometer (2⁄3 mile) if you’re moving at up to 20kmph (12 mph), for every 141m (462
feet) if you’re going faster, and for every 19.2 seconds if you’re stuck in traffic. You’ll
pay a surcharge of 2.58€ ($3.10) at night (10 p.m.–7 a.m.), and of 1.03€ ($1.20) on
Sundays and holidays. The luggage supplement is 1.04€ ($1.20) for each bag larger
than 35×25×50 centimeters (14×9.8×20 inches).

the way and within Rome but doesn’t stop at Termini. It takes about 40
minutes, depending on your stop, and runs every 15 minutes Monday
through Saturday and every 30 minutes on Sunday for about 5€ ($6). 
Get off at Roma Ostiense if your hotel is in the area of the Aventino or
the Colosseum; Roma Trastevere if it is in the area of Trastevere, San
Pietro, or Prati; and Roma Tiburtina if it is in the Porta Pia or Villa
Borghese areas.
Tickets for both trains are sold at the ticket booth in the terminal.
Remember to stamp your ticket at one of the small yellow validation
boxes before you board the train.
If you’re planning to use the commuter train from the airport and later
use public transportation in Rome, buy a day pass or a tourist three-day
ticket (see “Getting Around Rome,” later in this chapter) at the tobac-
conist in the railroad terminal — the commuter-train ride (though not on
the Leonardo Express) is included in both of those passes.
Whichever train you take, you’ll find a taxi stand immediately outside
each of the train stations upon your arrival. You’ll also find ranks of
public buses, with signs indicating their numbers and routes, in the area
in front of train stations, while the subway is underneath.
Finally, you can take a shuttle bus into Rome. Terravision (% 06-
79494572; www.terravision.it) runs a shuttle to Termini station 
and to Tiburtina station, with stops at a few major hotels. The fare is 
9€ ($11) for adults and 5€ ($6) for children 2 to 12.
Arriving at Ciampino airport
A number of international charter flights, as well as some airlines that
mainly serve Europe, arrive at Ciampino (% 06-794941 or 06-79340297),
16km (10 miles) from the center of Rome. This airport has few structures
or services; it’s almost like an American civil-aviation airport.
Taxis are by far the easiest way to get to town from Ciampino. Expect 
to pay about 35€ ($42) for the 45-minute trip (see earlier for details on
rates). You can also take a shuttle bus — Terravision runs a shuttle
service in concert with Ryanair flights, while Schiaffini runs a shuttle
coinciding with EasyJet flights. Both take you to Termini station for 8€
($9.60); tickets are sold at the Hotel Royal Santina or at the Hotel
Stromboli on Via Marsala, just across from the Termini train station.
By train
Rome is a major railroad hub, offering service to every domestic 
and international destination. The national train service, Trenitalia
(% 892021; www.trenitalia.it), is cheap, reliable, and frequent. No
fewer than six railway stations are located in the center of Rome, but the
most central and largest is Termini (% 800-431784; www.romatermini.
it), while the second-busiest is Tiburtina. Trains usually stop at one or
the other.
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
104

At Termini station, public toilets and luggage storage are at either end of
the platform area. Exits located near platforms 1 and 22 lead to the main
concourse, a long commercial gallery with a bar to the north and a phar-
macy to the south; in between are many newsstands, a tobacconist, a
travel agency, ATMs, and a cambio office, as well as information booths.
One floor below, you’ll find a mall complete with a large bookstore, super-
market, cosmetics store, shoe-repair shop, and ATMs; here is also the
entrance to the subway (both lines cross here; see “Getting Around
Rome,” later in this chapter). If you stay on the main concourse level and
continue in a straight line across the gallery, you’ll reach the main hall,
where train tickets are sold at the windows and at automatic machines.
You can exit to the street at either end of the gallery (where you’ll find
small taxi stands) or from the main hall, which opens onto Piazza dei
Cinquecento, the largest bus terminal in Rome. The main taxi stand is
just outside the main hall near the metro sign on the right. For some mys-
terious reason, the line forms at the end farthest from the exit of the train
station, so depending on how many people are waiting, you may have to
walk a bit (see earlier for rates and a warning on Gypsy cabs).
Orienting Yourself in Rome
Rome started outgrowing its ancient Roman and medieval walls (some 
of which are still standing in places) only in the 20th century, but it has
seen immense urban sprawl over the past two decades. From the older
central body of the city, arms of newer urban development have formed
along the main roads heading out of town, and lately, the space in
between has been filled in with modern developments. As a result, Rome
is quite large — in fact, it is Italy’s largest city. It is divided by the river
Tevere (Tiber), which meanders southward, leaving about a third of the
city on its western bank and the rest on its eastern bank.
On the eastern bank of the Tevere is the political, cultural, commercial,
and tourist heart of the city. About three millennia of consecutive layers
of urban development have created a confused layout of streets, with
tiny medieval roads crossed by larger and newer avenues. At the east
end on Piazza dei Cinquecento is Termini, Rome’s main train station
and major public transportation hub. Leading out of Piazza dei
Cinquecento is Via Cavour, heading toward the Colosseum. Branching
out of Piazza della Repubblica are Via Barberini, which leads into 
Via Veneto and Via del Tritone; and Via Nazionale, which descends 
to Piazza Venezia and continues — as Via del Plebiscito, then Corso
Vittorio Emanuele II — all the way to the River Tiber, and as Via della
Conciliazione across it to St. Peter’s and the Vatican. The major cross
streets at Piazza Venezia are Via del Corso and Via dei Fori Imperiali,
joining Piazza del Popolo at one end and the Colosseum at the other.
Beyond the Colosseum begins Via Appia, the first highway created 
by the ancient Romans. A section of it has been transformed into an
archaeological and natural park (see Chapter 12).
Chapter 11: Settling into Rome 105

On the western bank of the Tevere, you’ll find the Gianicolo hill over-
looking the neighborhood of Trastevere, as well as the Vatican — the
tiny city-state that is the base of the Catholic religion, with the pope as
both a religious and administrative leader. The Vatican’s major feature is
the basilica of San Pietro. North of the Vatican is the largish area called
Prati, crossed by the busy Via Cola di Rienzo and Via Ottaviano.
Introducing the neighborhoods
We have divided the historic center of Rome into several smaller neigh-
borhoods; all are desirable places to stay, with lively nightlife, restau-
rants, and cafes nearby. The neighborhoods are identified on the “Rome
Orientation” map in this chapter.
Aventino
This elegant residential neighborhood is one of the original seven hills of
Rome, where a number of monasteries were built in the Middle Ages. It
has known very little urban development since, and it’s now a unique
island of quiet, where small restaurants and a few hotels are surrounded
by greenery and peaceful streets. It is well connected via public trans-
portation to all other destinations in Rome.
Campo de’ Fiori
Along the left bank of the Tiber, this authentic neighborhood is mostly
residential but is made very lively by the market square and the con-
nected commercial strip of Via dei Giubbonari. You’ll find plenty of
restaurants and an active nightlife here. Among the attractions is the
beautiful Palazzo Farnese.
Colosseo
The Colosseum was at the heart of ancient Rome, and the area around 
it is a romantic mix of residential buildings and ruins. The Colosseo is
home to the most illustrious monuments of ancient Rome, including 
the Palatino, the Roman Forum, the Campidoglio, and, of course, the
Colosseum itself. To the north, in an area sloping up along Via Cavour, is
a very authentic and residential neighborhood. Although not elegant, it
is experiencing new life with the opening of trendy restaurants, small
hotels, and bars. To the east is another small, residential, and very
Roman neighborhood, with a few hotels and some nice neighborhood
restaurants.
Navona/Pantheon
On the southwestern side of the Corso, this lively neighborhood is a mix
of elegant Renaissance and medieval buildings, including the beautiful
palaces that house the government and the two chambers of the Italian
Parliament (the Parlamento and Senato). Many hotels are in this area,
and several nice restaurants and bars can be found along Via del
Governo Vecchio. Some of Rome’s best antiques shops line the Via 
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
106

dei Coronari. Graced by two of Rome’s greatest attractions — Piazza
Navona and the Pantheon — at its heart, this is one of the most desir-
able areas to stay; its popularity means that you have to put up with
crowds, especially in summer.
Piazza del Popolo
Squeezed between the old city walls and the river, around one of the
most beautiful squares of Rome, this lively neighborhood has a lot of
trendy new restaurants and bars in the area extending west of the Corso.
Piazza di Spagna
On the east side of the Corso, this former residential neighborhood has
been almost completely taken over by the fashion and tourist industries.
It is the best shopping neighborhood in Rome, home to all the great
names of Italian couture, plus a lot of other tony boutiques. It has many
hotels, including some of the city’s best. The shopping streets get a bit
deserted at night, and if you’re seeking some nightlife, you have to edge
toward Fontana di Trevi or cross over the Corso.
Prati
This residential neighborhood on the western bank of the Tiber takes its
name from the fields (prati) that still existed here at the end of the 19th
century. It stretches north of the Vatican along the river. Reflecting its
late-19th-century origins, streets are wide, straight, and lined with trees.
The area is pleasant and only a bridge away from Piazza del Popolo; it
has a relatively active, if subdued, nightlife, with restaurants, jazz clubs,
and an important shopping area along Via Cola di Rienzo.
Repubblica
Piazza della Repubblica is a gorgeous square created over what was the
main hall of Diocletian’s thermal baths, a few steps west of Piazza dei
Cinquecento and the Termini train station. The areas along Via Cernaia
on one side of the square and Via Nazionale on the other are lively
during the day because of the numerous shops and offices, but not par-
ticularly happening at night, when this turns into a quiet residential
neighborhood with a few hotels and restaurants. Very convenient to
most of Rome’s attractions and very well connected by public trans-
portation, this is a good alternative to the more glamorous and pricey
areas nearby.
San Pietro
On the western bank of the Tiber, this area is mainly occupied by the
walled city of the Vatican (seat of the Holy See and site of the Vatican
Museums and the Sistine Chapel). It is dominated, of course, by the
grandiose St. Peter’s Basilica and Castel Sant’Angelo. Flanking the basil-
ica are two ancient and picturesque residential neighborhoods that are
home to a few hotels and restaurants.

Chapter 11: Settling into Rome 109

Teatro Marcello
This area covers what is still commonly referred to as the Ghetto, the
old Jewish neighborhood at the edge of ancient Rome. It is among the
most authentic of the historic neighborhoods and remains very residen-
tial. Some nice restaurants are tucked away in its small streets, along
with pubs, local shops, and a few archaeological treasures.
Trastevere
Located on the western bank of the Tiber at the foot of the Gianicolo
hill, this neighborhood is just across the river from the Aventino.
Literally meaning “on the other side of the Tiber,” during ancient Roman
times, this was the traditional (and rather seedy) residence of poorer
artisans and workers. Its character was preserved during the Middle
Ages and the Renaissance, and to some extent up to the last century. In
recent times, though, it has been largely transformed into an artsy, cul-
tured neighborhood, famous for its restaurants, street life, and nightlife,
and appealing to younger and not-so-young Romans and visitors.
Trevi
On the east side of the Corso, this neighborhood slopes up the Quirinale
hill with the magnificent Renaissance presidential (formerly papal) resi-
dence as its centerpiece. Aside from the tourist hubbub around its
famous fountain — always surrounded by a sea of humanity — it’s a rela-
tively unspoiled neighborhood with many small restaurants and shops.
Via Veneto
Made famous by Fellini as the heart of La Dolce Vita, this elegant street
is lined by famous hotels and a few upscale stores. The environs are
very quiet at night. There are a number of nice hotels on the side
streets, but relatively few restaurants and nightspots. Well connected by
public transportation, the areas behind the glitzy strip of Via Veneto are
a good alternative to the glamorous and expensive areas nearby, espe-
cially if you go toward Via XX Settembre (at the southeastern edge of
this neighborhood).
Finding information after you arrive
The visitor center is at Via Parigi 5, off Piazza della Repubblica (% 06-
488991; www.romaturismo.it; Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m.). You’ll also find
information desks at international arrivals in Terminal B of Fiumicino
Airport (% 06-65956074; daily 8 a.m.–7 p.m.) and at several points
around the city near major attractions (daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.), including
the following locations:
 Castel Sant’Angelo, Piazza Pia, to the west of the Castel Sant’Angelo
(% 06-68809707; Metro: Ottaviano–San Pietro)
 Fontana di Trevi, Via Minghetti, off Via del Corso (% 06-6782988;
Minibus: 117 or 119)
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
110

 Fori Imperiali, Piazza Tempio della Pace on Via dei Fori Imperiali
(% 06-69924307; Metro: Colosseo)
 Largo Goldoni, on Via del Corso at Via Condotti (% 06-68136061;
Metro: Piazza di Spagna)
 Palazzo delle Esposizioni, Via Nazionale (% 06-47824525; Bus: 64)
 Piazza delle Cinque Lune, off Piazza Navona to the north (% 06-
68809240; Minibus: 116)
 San Giovanni, Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano (% 06-77203535;
Metro: San Giovanni)
 Santa Maria Maggiore, Via dell’Olmata, on the southeastern side of
the church (% 06-4740955; Metro: Termini)
 Stazione Termini, Piazza dei Cinquecento, in front of the railroad
station (% 06-47825194; Metro: Termini)
 Stazione Termini, inside the gallery (% 06-48906300; Metro:
Termini)
 Trastevere, Piazza Sonnino (% 06-58333457; Tram: 8)
Usually, the staff at the information points in or near Termini station are
the most overwhelmed; elsewhere, you’ll find people more available to
assist you.
The Holy See maintains its own tourist office. It is located in Piazza 
San Pietro (% 06-69884466; Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m.–6 p.m.), just left of the
entrance to the Basilica di San Pietro. The office has information on the
Vatican and on its tourist attractions and religious events. You may also
make reservations for a visit to the Vatican gardens or fill out the form to
participate in a papal audience — but we recommend making reservations
to do so before you leave home (see Chapter 12 for more information).
Getting Around Rome
Rome’s historic hills are no myth: They are real — and sometimes even
steep. The one myth is that there are only seven of them. Rome may
look flat on a map, but it’s very hilly — you’ll soon understand why
locals use mopeds (or cars, unfortunately) and public transportation,
and why you see so few bicycles around. Remember also that the city is
thousands of years old, meaning that much of it isn’t designed for any
mode of conveyance other than the human foot. There are times, how-
ever, when you’ll welcome public transportation. Taxis, for example, are
a great convenience at night when crossing large sections of the city.
By subway (metropolitana)
Although the metropolitana, or metro for short, has only two lines (work
has just started on the third line), it is the best way to get around
Chapter 11: Settling into Rome 111

because the underground routes don’t suffer from the terrible city 
traffic. In addition, the routes naturally stay the same — unlike the 
city bus system, which is under constant reorganization. Line A
Battistini–Anagnina and Line B Laurentina–Rebibbia cross at the
Termini station; a big red M marks all metro entrances. The metro runs
Sunday through Friday from 5:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. and Saturday from
5:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.
The Colosseum, Circus Maximus, and Cavour stops on Line B don’t offer
full elevator/lift service and aren’t accessible to the disabled. (For tips
for travelers with disabilities, see Chapter 9.)
By bus and tram
Rome’s bus system is large and under continuous improvement, yet the
city’s ancient layout resists any real modernization, so things don’t
always go smoothly: Buses are very crowded at rush hour, and traffic
jams are endemic. Still, buses remain an excellent resource because they
go absolutely everywhere in Rome. Especially useful are the diminutive
electric buses that are the only vehicles allowed in the tiny, narrow
streets of the historic heart of the city (116 and 116T from the Gianicolo
hill to Villa Borghese; 117 from Piazza del Popolo to San Giovanni in
Laterano; 118 from Piazzale Ostiense to Appia Antica; and 119 from
Piazza del Popolo to Largo Argentina). Among the other bus lines, those
that you are most likely to use are the 23 (Prati to Aventino), 62 (Castel
Sant’Angelo to Repubblica), 64 (Termini to Vatican), 87 (Prati to
Colosseum), 492 (Tiburtina railroad station to Vatican Museums), and
910 (Termini to Villa Borghese). Rome also has a few tram lines; they
aren’t as spectacular as the cable cars in San Francisco, but they’re fun
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
112
Getting a ticket to ride
ATAC (% 800-431784 or 06-46952027; www.atac.roma.it), Rome’s transport
authority, runs all public transportation in the city, and the same ticket is valid for all.
You need to buy tickets before boarding (although a few bus lines now have onboard
vending machines, do not count on finding one — they are still quite rare), and you
must stamp them upon boarding, or else they aren’t valid (on subway and trains, the
stamping machines — little yellow boxes — are at the entrance gates; on buses and
trams, they’re onboard). A regular biglietto (ticket) for the bus/metro is valid for 75 min-
utes and costs 1€ ($1.20). Within the 75 minutes of validity, you can take as many buses
and trams as you want, but only one subway ride. You can also get a day pass called
BIG that costs 4€ ($4.80), a three-day ticket called BTI for 11€ ($13), or a weekly pass
called CIS for 16€ ($19). All passes give you unlimited rides on the bus, metro, and
urban trains. You can buy tickets and passes at the metro ticket booths, the ATAC bus
information booth in front of Stazione Termini (near Platform C), from vending machines
at some major bus stops, and at many bars, tobacconist shops (signed TABACCHI or with
a white T on a black background), and newsstands.

to ride. A line we like a lot is the 3, which passes by the Basilica di San
Giovanni and the Colosseum. Another line that you’re likely to use is the
8, from Largo Argentina to Trastevere. Most buses run daily from 5:30 a.m.
to 12:30 a.m., but some stop at 8.30 p.m. A few night lines are marked with
an N for notturno (night); they usually run every hour, leaving the ends of
the line on the hour.
On foot
Walking is by far the best way to experience Rome — you’ll get to see
the most as you wander the curving streets that merge into others,
narrow to almost shoulder width, change names, and meander among
beautiful old buildings. Wear very comfortable shoes, and be ready to
switch to another form of transportation — usually handy — when you
get tired.
To enjoy Rome’s delightful labyrinth, you’ll need a good map. The free
tourist-office map is quite good, but it doesn’t have a stradario (street
directory), which is essential for locating addresses. You can buy a
detailed city map with a stradario at any newsstand and many bookstores.
By taxi
Taxi rates are reasonable in Rome (see earlier for details on fares), but
taking a cab can be expensive during those busy times of day when
you’re stuck in traffic. Still, they’re a great resource for getting to your
hotel from the train station and for traveling around at night after the
buses and metro stop running.
Taxis don’t cruise the streets, as in most U.S. cities; they return to taxi
stands and wait for a call. Hence, you usually cannot hail a taxi on the
street unless you happen to find one that’s returning to a stand. You’ll
find many taxi stands around, especially near major landmarks, includ-
ing Piazza Barberini (at the foot of Via Veneto), Piazza San Silvestro,
and Piazza SS. Apostoli (the latter two not far from the Trevi Fountain).
You can identify taxi stands by a smallish telephone on a pole marked
TAXI. But if you’re starting from a place with a phone — like a hotel or
restaurant — then asking the staff to call a taxi for you is easiest. For a
24-hour radio taxi, call % 06-88177, 06-6645, or 06-4994.
Staying in Style
Finding a hotel in Rome has become easier than ever: Many properties
have been recently refurbished, several new ones have opened, and hun-
dreds of B&Bs are on the scene. On the flip side, prices have risen
sharply in recent years. A weak dollar and poor exchange rate haven’t
helped. Rome is a capital city, and capital cities the world over are
expensive. The off season has shrunk to a few weeks in January,
February, August, and November (see Chapter 3 for more on seasons). 
In peak tourist season, you will find it difficult to find a decent room
Chapter 11: Settling into Rome 113

without paying through the nose. If you come to town without a reserva-
tion at all, you should be prepared to find a room only in the most
expensive hotels, or in those outside the city center. The best way to get
a deal is to plan in advance. See Chapter 8 for money-saving tips and
advice on what to expect from your hotel: Globalization may be here,
but cultural differences remain alive and well.
Below are our picks for our preferred hotels in Rome, followed by some
acceptable alternatives if you have trouble booking a room in our top
choices. Unless otherwise specified, all rooms in the hotels we recom-
mend come with private bathrooms. Note that many of the hotels in his-
toric areas are housed in ancient buildings and have relatively few
rooms, so reserve well in advance.
If you arrive without a room reservation (something we do not recom-
mend), remember that there’s a hotel reservations desk at the airport as
well as one at Termini station.
The top hotels
Albergo Cesàri Hotel
$$
Navona/Pantheon
You can’t beat the location of this hotel: It lies between the Pantheon and
the Corso, and the Trevi Fountain is not far away. The Cesàri has been a
hotel since 1787 (it still has its original license from Pope Pius VI), and has
been run by the same family since 1899. Guest rooms vary in size and
décor — some are more modern, while others have beautiful hardwood
reproduction beds and armoires. All have double-paneled windows, most
have wooden floors with nice carpets, and many bathrooms have a tub
and are good-sized. For families or small groups, inquire about the triple
and quad rooms.

($372) quad. AE, DC, MC, V.
Albergo del Senato
$$$$
Pantheon
This elegant hotel has an ideal location across from the Pantheon. Guest
rooms are spacious — the suites are palatial — and beautifully furnished,
with antiques and quality reproductions, marble-topped tables, and hard-
wood floors. The marble bathrooms are huge (for Rome) and nicely
appointed. The terrace has a spectacular view and is perfect for enjoying
Rome’s sunsets. The hotel has been recently wired for Wi-Fi Internet access.

Albergo Santa Chiara
$$$
Navona/Pantheon
Operated since 1838 by the Corteggiani family, this is our favorite moder-
ately priced hotel in Rome. Inside is a chapel built in the room where St.
Clare (St. Francis’s spiritual sister) lived her last years. Located behind the
Pantheon and a few steps from Piazza della Minerva, it’s both functional and
comfortable. From the entry hall, with its statuary and porphyry columns,
to the skylit breakfast room, the Santa Chiara offers a feeling of elegance and
simplicity. Guest rooms vary in shape and furnishings: Some are in a modern
style, some have carpeting (while others have wood floors), and some fea-
ture beamed ceilings. All have good-sized bathrooms. There are also some
triples and quads, plus three garret suites with private terraces.
See map p. 116. Via Santa Chiara 21. % 06-6872979. Fax: 06-6873144. www.albergo

($552) suite. Rates include breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Bernini Bristol
$$$$
Via Veneto
We particularly appreciate this hotel for its great location — just at the
foot of Via Veneto — and its impeccable service, provided at (relatively)
moderate rates, particularly if you get one of the great Internet specials.
Opened in 1874, it served as the background location for many scenes of
Dan Brown’s novel Angels and Demons. Most of its guest rooms are classi-
cally furnished, but a few have been redone in elegant modern style. All
are outfitted with luxury fabrics and carpeting, fine linens, and elegant
marble bathrooms. The best rooms open onto great views over Rome.
From the splendid rooftop restaurant, the Olympus, you can enjoy a 360-
degree vista; the hotel also has a spa and gym for its guests.

Casa Valdese
$
Prati
Located on the Vatican side of the river, near Castel Sant’Angelo and the
shopping district of Cola di Rienzo, this small hotel offers great value. The
name “Valdese” refers to the Protestant group of Swiss origin, and the hotel
reflects this in its simple but spotlessly clean and pleasant rooms. The
very moderate prices and the excellent location — basically across the
river from Piazza del Popolo — are other pluses. A half-board plan (includ-
ing breakfast and dinner) is available.

Chapter 11: Settling into Rome 117

Grand Hotel de la Minerve
$$$$
Navona/Pantheon
This very elegant hotel is located in one of our preferred small squares in
the center of Rome and offers magnificent accommodations and service
to boot. Housed in a 17th-century palace, the spacious guest rooms are
appointed with stylish contemporary furnishings that whisper of comfort
and excellent taste; some of the rooms have beautifully decorated ceilings
with fine moldings. The marble bathrooms are spacious and contain all
manner of amenities. In the warm season, the hotel’s restaurant moves to
the roof garden, where you can enjoy a gorgeous view of the dome-
studded skyline. There’s live music in the bar every evening. A very nice
gym is right on the premises.

hoteldelaminerve.it. Bus: 116 to Pantheon; 64 or 70 to Largo Argentina. Rack
rates: 460€–600€ ($552–$720) double. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel Arenula
$
Campo de’ Fiori/Teatro Marcello
This hotel offers large and well-appointed guest rooms at moderate prices.
Above all, you can’t beat its location. Situated on the second floor of a nice
palazzo, with a beautiful marble spiral staircase leading to it (no elevator),
it lies within walking distance of many of the center’s main attractions and
to buses and trams that will take you to the others. Nearby Campo de’ Fiori
is busy with a market during the day, and dining and nightlife after dark.
Guest rooms are spacious and bright, simply furnished but welcoming,
with decent-size bathrooms and good amenities.

Hotel Art
$$$$
Piazza di Spagna
This new hotel, located in one of the most desirable areas of Rome, edges
beyond modern into the realm of postmodern. If you don’t get a room here,
stop by just to see the hall and the court, with its crystal staircase and
designer contemporary furnishings, and the bar — created in the
columned and frescoed chapel of a palace. These striking features illus-
trate the artistic “eclecticism” on which the hotel prides itself. Each floor
is color-coordinated with the details of the rooms (even down to the sta-
tionery and pens), and much of the furniture is made of fine hardwoods.
Hotel Art has the feel of boutique hotels found in all the great cities of the
world. The accent here is on comfort, service, and, of course, style. Check
its Web site for Internet specials.

Hotel Capo d’Africa
$$$
Colosseo
This elegant new hotel is set on an atmospheric street between the
Colosseum and San Giovanni, close to most of the sights of ancient Rome.
Run by the same owners as the Hotel Dei Mellini (see review later in this
chapter) and known for its excellent service, the Capo d’Africa offers com-
fortable rooms furnished in a warm, modern-ethnic style. The marble bath-
rooms are a good size and nicely fitted out. The hotel also offers some
suites and wheelchair-accessible rooms. Don’t miss the roof terrace and its
splendid views.

Rates include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel Celio
$$$
Colosseo
This small hotel is a real jewel, housed in an 1870 building just steps from
some of the city’s most famous monuments. Rooms are individually deco-
rated in Renaissance and ancient Roman style, with mosaic floors and fres-
coed walls. The beautiful bathrooms are done in marble and mosaics. The
decoration and the furnishings — fine modern reproductions and some
antiques — are the essence of what people mean by “old-world charm.”
The roof terrace, where breakfast is served in fine weather, enjoys gor-
geous views over ancient Rome — as do the three private terraces of the
Pompeian suite.

Hotel Dei Mellini
$$$
Prati
Within walking distance of Piazza del Popolo and Castel Sant’Angelo, this
new hotel has a sophisticated atmosphere, with a relaxing inner garden
and a contemporary-art collection in the public areas. Guest rooms are
pleasantly furnished in modern-classic style with marble bathrooms; some
rooms have private terraces. Children up to 12 stay free in a parent’s room.

Chapter 11: Settling into Rome 119

Hotel de Russie
$$$$
Piazza di Spagna
Making the lists of the world’s top hotels ever since it opened in 2000, the
Russie is the most elegant place to stay in Rome, offering superb location,
service, and accommodations. If you stay here, you’ll follow in the steps
of the rich and famous — Bill and Chelsea Clinton, among others. Housed
in a beautiful palazzo enclosing a delightful terrace garden, the hotel is
furnished in extremely tasteful and classy contemporary Italian style.
Guest rooms are huge and have all kinds of amenities. You’ll also find a spa
with sauna; a health club; and, amazingly enough, a swimming pool (all for
an extra fee). The restaurant on the premises, Le Jardin du Russie, gets
excellent reviews.

Hotel Farnese
$$$
Prati
Tucked behind Castel Sant’Angelo in a quiet neighborhood and across the
Tiber from Piazza del Popolo, this hospitable choice occupies a 1906 patri-
cian palazzo, which has been completely renovated. Quiet and off the
beaten path, it is elegantly decorated and features spacious guest rooms —
the largest ones geared for families. The bathrooms are particularly nice,
clad in marble and tile and with new modern fixtures. The Farnese is steps
from one of Rome’s best shopping streets — Via Cola di Rienzo — and within
walking distance of the Vatican and the historic center. The hotel also has a
roof garden.

Hotel Forte
$$
Piazza di Spagna
This hotel is a good find — often booked solid — offering accommodations
at a moderate price in the most glamorous area of the historic center.
Guest rooms vary in size, but all are pleasant, with quality wooden furni-
ture in streamlined classic style. Most have carpeted floors. Bathrooms
are not huge, but are functional and come with all the usual comforts.
Amenities include Wi-Fi Internet access.

your left from Via del Corso. Rack rates: 232€ ($278) double. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel Lilium
$$
Via Veneto/Termini
Hotel Lilium defines itself as both refined and cheap. It’s a great addition
for budget travelers, offering a convenient if not glamorous location, along
with bright, clean, and welcoming accommodations. The smallish guest
rooms are individually decorated with wooden furniture and charming
hand-painted floral motifs. The best rooms have spacious bathrooms and
small, delightful private balconies. Triples are also available. The hotel
offers 24-hour free Internet access.

Hotel Parlamento
$$
Pantheon
Located right in the heart of Rome, this hotel is housed in a 15th-century
building and offers great accommodations at excellent prices (off-season
prices can be half the rack rate). Rooms are bright and spacious, with tiled
floors, large beds, and comfortable bathrooms (some with tubs). Weather
permitting, breakfast is served on the pleasant roof terrace. Internet
access is free, but air-conditioning costs an extra 12€ ($14) per day.

Hotel Santa Maria
$$
Trastevere
This small hotel occupies a block of low buildings surrounding a romantic
garden-courtyard lined by a portico. Most of the guest rooms are on the
Chapter 11: Settling into Rome 121

first floor and open directly onto the courtyard (except one garret suite
on the second floor). Rooms are cozy and welcoming, decorated with
terra-cotta–tiled floors, whitewashed walls, and dark-wood furniture; how-
ever, they can be a bit dark on rainy days, as all light naturally comes from
the portico. The courtyard, though, is a pleasant place to take breakfast on
a sunny morning; in the afternoon and early evening, guests can have a
glass of wine at the wine bar. The suites are on two levels and are designed
for families with children (up to six beds).

Hotel Teatropace 33
$$
Navona/Pantheon
Opened in 2004, this hotel is a good find and a great addition to Rome’s
accommodations. With its romantic location — hidden on a narrow street
behind Piazza Navona — it offers both atmospheric lodgings and excel-
lent amenities. It is housed in a 17th-century palazzo, with a grand baroque
marble staircase still the only way up (the hotel personnel will assist you
with your luggage). Guest rooms are furnished with personality, featuring
wooden floors and ceiling beams, quality furniture, and nicely done, good-
sized bathrooms.

clubby, British feeling. Guest rooms are furnished with antiques and origi-
nal work by contemporary artists, creating refined yet warm and relaxing
surroundings. You need to book well in advance to snag one of the 15 well-
appointed rooms.

Via Veneto
In the exclusive area around Via Veneto, you’ll find this new hotel housed
in a Liberty (Italian Art Nouveau) building from the beginning of the 20th
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
122

century. The eponymous inner rose garden is perfect for a private stroll.
Charm isn’t the only thing you’ll find here, however — the amenities are
top-notch as well. The marble bathrooms have both showers and bath-
tubs; the rooms themselves are large; and the entire hotel is furnished with
very sleek yet inviting modern décor. A new health club and even a swim-
ming pool are on-site. Check the Web site for special Internet rates.

Villa San Pio
$$$
Aventino
This is the best of a group of three beautifully located and family-run hotels
on the Aventino. It is a peaceful spot, surrounded by a private garden, yet
only steps from attractions and transportation. Guest rooms are large and
elegantly decorated, with period furniture and delicate frescoes and mold-
ings on the walls. Good-sized marble bathrooms add to the value. If this
hotel is full, an employee will suggest that you reserve at one of the nearby
sister hotels, which we also recommend. Hotel Sant’Anselmo is at Piazza
Sant’Anselmo 2, while Hotel Aventino is at Via San Domenico 10; each has
its own personality.

Hotel Aleph

Via Veneto
We love this hotel in Rome, for it is almost perfect:
very stylish furnishings, elegant but not overwhelming or stuffy atmos-
phere, and ideal location. However, it is quite expensive — and some of
the even more luxurious hotels sometimes offer better deals — hence its
position in this section. See map p. 116. Via di San Basilio 15, off Piazza del Tritone.

place to be in Rome, with its fantastic location up the Spanish Steps. The

rants. See map p. 116. Piazza Trinita dei Monti 6. % 06-699340. Fax: 06-6789991.

marble bathrooms; a number of rooms have coffered ceilings. The vaulted
breakfast room has bright fresco decorations. See map p. 116. Via Borgo Pio

Dining Out
It used to be said that Rome lacked a really good restaurant — but things
have changed, and the capital now boasts some of the best restaurants in
the country. Also, as hotel dining becomes more fashionable in Rome,
more and more accommodations are making the special effort to hire
great chefs and transform their previously nondescript restaurants into
real winners. In addition to many elegant and trendy new restaurants,
Rome offers a great number of simple, down-to-earth trattorie and osterie
preparing excellent traditional Roman fare. Restaurants crowd the his-

ROMAN/SEAFOOD
This restaurant will satisfy both gourmands looking for creative dishes and
those seeking traditional Roman cuisine. The chef claims to have invented
the crudo (“raw” — as in raw fish) Italian style, and he keeps researching
new flavors: The ever-changing menu may list a napoleon with local fish
mousse in white-wine sauce or his version of the classic zuppa di fagioli e
frutti di mare (bean and seafood stew). The tasting menus range from
Roman traditional (50€/$59) to the chef’s grand cuisine (84€/$101).

Colosseo
ROMAN/SEAFOOD/PIZZA
A local favorite, this is another stronghold of Roman cuisine that may
appear like a tourist trap due to its perfect location across from the Roman
Forum — but it’s actually an authentic traditional restaurant. We definitely
recommend the bucatini all’amatriciana (tomato-and-bacon sauce with
pecorino cheese), the saltimbocca alla romana (sautéed veal with ham and
sage), and — when on the menu — the pollo alla Romana (chicken stewed
with red and yellow peppers). It also serves nice fish dishes that vary with
market offerings (check the display by the entrance). The terrace is a great
plus in nice weather, but service may get slow.

experiments are subtle and delicious — though the more traditional offer-
ings on the menu keep your options open. The Cucina Romana tasting menu
is a great choice and may include maccheroni all’amatriciana (tomato-and-
bacon sauce with pecorino cheese) or saltimbocca; less typical menu offer-
ings may include spaghetti with garlic, olive oil, and local crayfish, or
perhaps pasta with fresh tuna, marinated pumpkin, and lemon zest.

Giolitti, Via Uffici del Vicario 40 (% 06-6991243; Minibus: 116), is the oldest gelato

“When in Rome, do as Romans do,” goes the adage, and indeed, you’ll find that 
Rome’s cosmopolitan population has mostly embraced the local culinary culture: Non-
Italian restaurants are rare and often more expensive. At the ubiquitous Chinese
restaurant — about one per neighborhood and none to write home about — you will
spend the same as in the local trattoria or pizzeria. The others are pricier, fancier
places where Romans go for something special or exotic. We love Japanese cuisine,
which is available at Hasekura (Via dei Serpenti 27; % 06-483648; open daily) and

Pizzeria Ivo
$
Trastevere
PIZZA
One of Rome’s most established pizzerie, Ivo is as popular with locals as
it is with visitors. Luckily, the place is big! Here you can enjoy an entire
range of pizzeria appetizers, pizzas, crostini, and calzones. All the pizzas
are good, but we love the capricciosa (prosciutto, carciofini, and olives)
and the seasonal one with fiori di zucca (zucchini flowers).
See map p. 116. Via di San Francesco a Ripa 158. % 06-581-7082. Reservations 
not necessary. Tram: 8 to Via di San Francesco a Ripa (on the right off Viale
Trastevere). Secondi: 8€–12€ ($10–$14). DC, MC, V. Open: Wed–Mon 12:30–3:30 p.m.
and 7:30–11 p.m.
Sant’Andrea

Piazza di Spagna
ROMAN
We’re always surprised to find that this restaurant, only a few steps 
from Piazza di Spagna, has not become a tourist trap. Instead, this small
eatery — with a few tables outside in good weather — continues to be 
frequented by locals who come for the traditional Roman cuisine. We rec-
ommend the specialty, coratella d’abbacchio con cipolla (sautéed onions
and lamb liver and organ meat), but you can also choose from the well-
rounded menu.
See map p. 116. Via S. Andrea delle Fratte 9/13. % 06-6793167. Reservations rec-
ommended. Metro: Piazza di Spagna. Secondi: 12€–21€ ($14–$25). AE, DC, MC, V.
Open: Sun–Fri noon to 3 p.m. and 6–11 p.m. Closed Aug and Dec 25.
Sora Lella
$$
Trastevere
ROMAN
This family-run restaurant — created by the sister of the famous Roman
actor Aldo Fabrizi and run today by his son and grandsons — was already
a Roman institution, but with the recent renovations both in the dining
room and on the menu, it has won new admirers. The gnocchi are superb,
as are the many new dishes, such as the delicious polpettine al vino (small
meatballs in a wine sauce). Tasting menus and a vegetarian menu are avail-
able, and the traditional contorni, such as dandelion greens and artichokes,
are exceptional.
See map p. 116. Via di Ponte Quattro Capi 16, on Isola Tiberina, in the river between
the center and Trastevere. % 06 6861601. Reservations recommended. Bus: 23, 63,
or 115 to Isola Tiberina. Secondi: 14€–20€ ($17–$24). AE, DC, V. Open: Mon–Sat noon
to 2 p.m. and 7–11 p.m. Closed Aug.

Maps
If you want something more detailed than
the free tourist map, we recommend you
buy a map with a stradario (street direc-
tory), available at newsstands.
Newspapers and Magazines
All the newspaper kiosks in the historic
center sell the European issues of Time,
The Economist, and the Financial Times.
The kiosk on Via Veneto, off Piazza
Barberini across from the U.S. Embassy,
has a particularly large selection.
Pharmacies
Pharmacies are usually open Monday
through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and
again from 4 to 7:30 p.m. A few pharmacies
are open all night: Piazza dei Cinquecento
49, at Termini Station (% 06-4880019); Via
Cola di Rienzo 213 (% 06-3244476); Piazza
Risorgimento 44 (% 06-39738166); Via
Arenula 73 (% 06-68803278); Corso
Rinascimento 50 (% 06-68803985); Piazza
Barberini 49 (% 06-4871195); and Viale
Trastevere 229 (% 06-5882273).
Police
There are two police forces in Italy; call
either one. For the Polizia, dial % 113; for
the Carabinieri, dial % 112.
Post Office
The main post office in the historic center is
located at Piazza San Silvestro 19, not far
from Piazza di Spagna. You’ll also find post
offices at Via di Porta Angelica 23, near San
Pietro, and Viale Mazzini 101, in the Cola di
Rienzo area. They’re open Monday through
Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and
Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. For infor-
mation, call % 800-160000.
Restrooms
Public toilets are few and far between.
You’ll find some outside the Colosseum on
the southeast side; halfway up the steps
from Piazza del Popolo to the Pincio, on the
left side; and facing San Pietro, under the
colonnade on the right. Make sure you have
some change to tip the attendant. Your best
bet may be to go to a nice-looking cafe
(though you’ll have to buy something, like 
a cup of coffee, to use the restroom).
Safety
Rome is a very safe city except for pick-
pockets, who practice with great skill in
tourist areas, on public transportation, and
in any crowded place, including stations
(Termini is notorious) and open-air markets.
Someone will distract you by asking for
information, and an affiliate will snap your
unattended bag at your feet. Roving gangs
of Gypsy children are now less common
than they once were; they try to surround
you, creating distraction and confusion,
while an artful dodger picks your pocket.
Smoking
In 2005, Italy passed a law outlawing smok-
ing in most public places. Smoking is
allowed only where there is a separate,
ventilated area for nonsmokers. If you want
to smoke at your table, call beforehand to
make sure the restaurant or cafe you’ll be
visiting offers a smoking area.
Taxes
See Chapter 5 for information on IVA (Value
Added Tax).
Taxis
Walk to one of the numerous taxi stands —
some of the most central include Termini
rail station, Piazza della Repubblica, Piazza
Barberini, Piazza Venezia, Via Zanardelli,
Vicolo del Gallinaccio (Trevi fountain),
Piazza della Cancelleria, Piazza Belli, and
Piazza del Risorgimento — or call % 06-
3570, 06-88177, 06-6645, 06-4994, 06-5551, or
800-090214 for radio taxi service.

Trenitalia (% 892021; www.trenitalia.

Exploring Rome
In This Chapter
 Experiencing Rome’s great attractions
 Checking out other fun things to see and do
 Going through Rome by guided tour
 Choosing from itineraries
 Finding Rome’s hot shopping spots
 Discovering Roman nightlife
T
he seven hills of Rome have been continuously inhabited for the
past 3,000 years or so. The Eternal City has lived through thousands
of years of history, and today about 2.6 million people live — and many
more work — in this place designed for chariots rather than cabs, with
city buses and hordes of motorini (mopeds and motor bikes) buzzing
around ancient sites. They walk on ruins from the days of Caesar, turn
along the same alleys trod by masters of the Renaissance, and thrill to
the same lighted fountains that were reflected in the eyes of Fellini’s
beautiful debauchers. Rome also contains a city-state — the Vatican, the
official seat of the Catholic faith — whose vast complex of museums,
apartments, chapels, and gardens is filled with masterpieces and riches.
Rome wasn’t built in a day, or even a millennium, so don’t think you can
see it all in a day: Set aside several days to do the city right.
For a service fee of 1.50€ ($1.80), you can make reservations for a
number of attractions — and even buy your tickets online — by contact-
ing Pierreci (% 06-39967700; www.pierreci.it), the official agency
that manages reservations for many Roman attractions. Pierreci will
send you a voucher by e-mail, and you pick up your tickets at a special
desk directly at the attraction entrance, thereby skipping the line.
Pierreci’s hours are Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
and 2:30 to 5 p.m. The official agent for reservations and tickets for
other attractions — such as the Galleria Borghese — is Ticketeria
(% 06-32810; www.ticketeria.it). Just as with Pierreci, Ticketeria
sends you a voucher by e-mail, enabling you to pick up your tickets at a
special location at the attraction entrance.
The Vatican is a separate state, and you must make reservations for the
attractions there at its visitor office (see “Visiting the Vatican’s Top
Attractions,” later in this chapter).

As everywhere in Italy, bare shoulders, halter tops, tank tops, shorts, 
or skirts above the knee will lead to your being turned away at the
entrance of churches — no kidding, and no matter your age and sex 
(see Chapter 2).
Discovering Rome’s Top Attractions
Rome’s sights could keep you going for days, weeks, months, and even
years. In this treasure-trove of possibilities, you have to make some deci-
sions. The sights in this section comprise our roster of the most impor-
tant Roman attractions.
Capitoline Museums
Teatro Marcello
These museums are housed in the two palaces — Palazzo Nuovo and
Palazzo dei Conservatori — that open onto the beautiful Piazza del
Campidoglio, designed by Michelangelo. The oldest public collection in
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 139
Don’t pass up these deals
If you’re planning to do a lot of sightseeing in Rome, you may want to purchase dis-
count cards offered by various museums and attractions.
The brand-new Rome Pass (% 06-82059127; www.comune.roma.it) is valid for
three days, costs 18€ ($22), and includes admission to two major attractions, discounts
on all others, and free public transportation. You can buy it at any tourist info desk and
in all museums.
If you’re planning an extensive visit of ancient Rome, the best deal is the seven-day
Roma Archeologia Card: For 20€ ($24), you can access the Colosseum, Palatine Hill,
all the sites of the National Roman Museum (Octagonal Hall, Palazzo Altemps, Palazzo
Massimo, Terme di Diocleziano, and Cripta Balbi), Caracalla Baths, and the two sites
of the Park of the Appian Way that charge admission (Mausoleum of Cecilia Metella
and Villa of the Quintili). You can purchase the card at any of the participating sites
(except for the Via Appia locations) or at the main visitor center of the Tourist Board
of Rome (APT), at Via Parigi 5 (% 06-36004399).
The complex of the Capitoline Museums offers a combination ticket; it is valid for
seven days and includes admission to the two Capitoline Museums, in addition to the
Tabularium and the Centrale Montemartini (the postmodern annex created in a former
power plant), for 8.50€ ($10) — a savings of 6.50€ ($7.80).
The Appia Antica Card costs 6€ ($7.20) and gets you into Caracalla Baths, the
Mausoleum of Cecilia Metella, and Villa of the Quintili. The pass is valid for seven days
and is available from any of the three sites.

Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 141

the world, the museums hold a treasury of ancient sculpture and an impor-
tant collection of European paintings from the 17th and 18th centuries.
They also preserve the original second-century bronze equestrian statue
of Marcus Aurelius (the one you see standing in the middle of the square
is a copy). The statue was saved only because early Christians thought it
was the first Christian emperor, Constantine.
In the Palazzo Nuovo, you will find famous sculptures such as the
Capitoline Venus and the Dying Gaul, a Roman copy of a Greek original.
The bulk of the sculpture collection, though, is now at the Centrale
Montemartini annex (Via Ostiense 106; % 06-5748038; www.centrale
montemartini.org). Entering Palazzo dei Conservatori, you will find the
dismembered pieces of an ancient 40-foot statue of Constantine II, which
you may have already seen in photographs: the huge head, hands, foot,
kneecap, and so on. Also in this museum is the famous Lupa Capitolina,
the wolf suckling Romulus and Remus, a fifth-century-B.C. bronze that is
the symbol of Rome. On the top floor is the Pinacoteca Capitolina (pic-
ture gallery), a superb collection that includes such famous paintings as
Caravaggio’s Fortune Teller and John the Baptist, Titian’s Baptism of
Christ, and works by Veronese, Rubens, and others.
Between the Palazzo Nuovo and the Palazzo dei Conservatori, closing
Piazza del Campidoglio to the south, is the Senatorial Palace (Palazzo
Senatorio). This palace, used for administrative purposes until recently,
was built in the Middle Ages over the Tabularium, an imposing Roman
building that housed the public archives of the Roman Republic. The
Tabularium was built of massive stone blocks with Doric columns in the
facade. You can clearly see its remains from the Forum (3 of the original 11
arcades remain). It’s now part of the museum complex, and its admission
is included in the ticket. An in-depth visit will take about four hours, but
you can see the highlights in about two hours.
See map p. 140. Piazza del Campidoglio 1, off Piazza Venezia. % 06-67102475. www.
museicapitolini.org. Bus: Minibus 117. Admission: 6.50€ ($7.20); 1.50€ ($1.80)

Ticket booth closes 1 hour earlier. Closed Jan 1, May 1, Oct 28–29, and Dec 25.
Caracalla Baths
Aventino
Built by the Roman emperor Caracalla, these baths were completed in A.D.
216 and operated until A.D. 537. They are the best preserved large thermal
baths in Rome, and some of the internal decoration can still be seen, allow-
ing the imagination to reconstruct what it must have been like: richly deco-
rated with enormous marble columns, hundreds of statues, colored
marble or mosaic floors, and more colored marble or stucco and frescoes
on the walls. The baths in Roman times were much more than just a sauna;
people came here to wash, but also to relax and exercise. After entering the
building from the porticos on the northeast side, one would find the dress-
ing rooms first and then move through the deep cleansing area, a sort of
sauna similar to Turkish baths: starting with the calidarium (hot room)
and then proceeding to the tepidarium (first cooling down), the frigidarium
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
142

(complete cooling down), and natatio (swimming pool). Two gymnasium
(exercise rooms) were also provided, with trainers on duty, as well as gar-
dens for reading and relaxing. Plan to spend about an hour here.

it. Metro: Circo Massimo. Admission: 6€ ($7.20). Includes admission to Mausoleum
of Cecilia Metella and Villa of the Quintili. Open: Mon 9 a.m.–2 p.m.; Tues–Sun 9 a.m.
to 1 hour before sunset. Ticket booth closes 1 hour earlier. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
Castel Sant’Angelo
San Pietro
This “castle” is a perfect example of recycling, Roman style: It began as a
mausoleum to hold the remains of Emperor Hadrian, was then transformed
into a fortress, and is now a museum of arms and armor. Built in A.D. 123,
it may have been incorporated into the city’s defenses as early as 403 and
was attacked by the Goths (one of the barbarian tribes who pillaged Rome
in its decline) in 537. Later, the popes used it as a fortress and hide-out,
and for convenience connected it to the Vatican palace by an elevated 
corridor — the passetto — which you can still see near Borgo Pio, stretch-
ing between St. Peter’s and the castle. Besides the museum, you can also
visit the elegant papal apartments from the Renaissance, as well as the
horrible cells in which political prisoners were kept (among them sculptor
Benvenuto Cellini). Count on about two hours for a full visit.

Ticket booth closes 1 hour earlier. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
Catacombs of San Callisto
Park of Appia Antica
There are several places to visit the catacombs in Rome — including the
catacombs of St. Sebastian, at Via Appia Antica 136 (% 06 7850350), and
those of Ste. Domitilla, Via delle Sette Chiese 282 (% 06 5110342; www.
catacombe.domitilla.it) — but the catacombs of St. Callisto are
among the most impressive, with 20km (121⁄2 miles) of tunnels and galleries
underground, organized on several levels. (It’s cold down there at 18m/60
ft., so bring a sweater.) The catacombs began as quarries outside ancient
Rome where travertine marble and the soil used to make cement were dug.
Early Christians, however, hid out, held mass, and buried their dead in the
catacombs. The Catacombs of St. Callixtus (Callixtus III was an early pope,
elected in 217) have four levels, including a crypt of several early popes
and the tomb where St. Cecilia’s remains were found. Some of the original
paintings and decoration are still intact and show that Christian symbol-
ism — doves, anchors, and fish — was already well developed. You can
tour the catacombs in about one hour.

Colli Albani (on Sun to Arco di Travertino); then Bus 660 to Via Appia Antica.
Admission: 5€ ($6). Open: Thurs–Tues 8:30 a.m. to noon and 2:30–5 p.m. (in summer
to 5:30 p.m.). Closed Feb.
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 143

Colosseum
Colosseo
The Colosseum, along with St. Peter’s Basilica, is Rome’s most recogniza-
ble monument. However, “Colosseum” isn’t its official name. Begun under
the Flavian Emperor Vespasian, it was named the Amphiteatrum Flavium
and was finished in A.D. 80. Its nickname came from the colossal statue of
Nero that was erected nearby in the second century A.D. Estimates are that
the Colosseum could accommodate up to 73,000 spectators. The enter-
tainment included fights between gladiators and battles with wild animals.
In the labyrinth of chambers beneath the original wooden floor of the
Colosseum, deadly weapons, vicious beasts, and gladiators were prepared
for mortal combat. (Contrary to popular belief, the routine feeding of
Christians to lions is a legend.) The Colosseum was later damaged by fires
and earthquakes, and eventually abandoned; it was then used as a marble
quarry for the monuments of Christian Rome until Pope Benedict XV con-
secrated it in the 18th century. Today, the Colosseum houses special exhi-
bitions as well as performances. Next to it is the Arch of Constantine, built
in 315 to commemorate the emperor’s victory over the pagan Maxentius
in 312. Pieces from other monuments were reused, so Constantine’s monu-
ment includes carvings honoring Marcus Aurelius, Trajan, and Hadrian.
We strongly recommend reserving your tickets in advance (by phone or
online) to avoid the long lines. Plan to spend about an hour here.

Domus Aurea
Colosseo
The complex of Domus Aurea (literally “Golden House”) was the brainchild
of the infamous Emperor Nero. Built after the great fire of A.D. 64 (which is
traditionally but perhaps incorrectly blamed on him), it once covered
more than 200 acres, with buildings scattered over a park landscaped to
look like romantic countryside with an artificial lake, pastures, and vine-
yards. The lavishly decorated main reception building — the Golden
House itself — was abandoned after Nero’s fall in 68 and buried under the
thermal baths of the emperors Titus and Trajan. Completely forgotten, it
was stumbled upon in the 18th century when Romans digging in the “hill”
across from the Colosseum found caves that turned out to be ceilings of
ancient rooms decorated with Roman frescoes. The site was excavated
and open to the public in 2000. Note: The site is currently closed for
restorations and is expected to reopen by the end of 2007.

Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
144

Galleria Borghese
Villa Borghese
The Galleria Borghese is housed in the splendid building inside the Villa
Borghese (now a large public park; see “Finding More Cool Things to See
and Do,” later in this chapter) that Cardinal Scipione Borghese created in
1613 for his art collection. The art inside is probably the most stunning
smaller collection on view in Italy. The ground floor focuses on sculpture,
including Canova’s sensual reclining Paulina Borghese as Venus Victrix
(Paulina was Napoleon’s sister) and breathtaking marble carvings by the
young Gian Lorenzo Bernini. His David, captured in the middle of a sling-
shot windup, is full of charmingly boyish concentration; Apollo and
Daphne freezes in marble the moment when Daphne turns into a laurel
tree, her fingers bursting into leaves and bark enveloping her legs. In the
Rape of Proserpine, a sculpture Bernini executed in collaboration with
his father, the god’s fingers uncannily seem to press into her marble flesh.
The extensive painting collection contains many masterpieces:
Caravaggio’s haunting self-portrait as Bacchus and his St. Jerome
Writing, Antonello da Messina’s subtle and mysterious Portrait of a Man,
a young Raphael’s Deposition, and Tiziano’s Sacred and Profane Love.
Andrea del Sarto, Coreggio, Lucas Cranach, Bronzino, Lorenzo Lotto, and
many other artists are also represented in this dazzling display of genius.
The Galleria Borghese can accommodate only so many people, so reser-
vations are required for admission, and your visit must be limited to two
hours. (The astounding number of true masterpieces will make you long
for a second visit.)
See map p. 140. Piazzale del Museo Borghese. % 06-8417645. Reservations required
by calling % 06-328101 or going to www.ticketeria.it. Bus: 52, 53, or 910 to Via
Pinciana behind the villa; 490 to Viale San Paolo del Brasile inside the park; or Minibus
116 to the Galleria Borghese. Metro: Line A to Spagna; take the Villa Borghese exit
and walk up Viale del Museo Borghese. Admission: 6.50€ ($7.80), plus 2€ ($2.40)
reservations fee. Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–7 p.m.
Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Antica in Palazzo Barberini
Via Veneto
Completed in 1633, the Palazzo Barberini is a magnificent example of a
baroque Roman palace. Bernini decorated the rococo apartments in which
the gallery is now housed, and they’re certainly luxurious. Also preserved
in the Palazzo Barberini is the wedding chamber of Princess Cornelia
Costanza Barberini and Prince Giulio Cesare Colonna di Sciarra, exactly as
it was centuries ago. Although the structure itself is an attraction, the col-
lection of paintings that makes up the gallery is most impressive — it
includes Caravaggio’s Narcissus, Tiziano’s Venus and Adonis, and
Raphael’s La Fornarina, a loving, informal portrait of the bakery girl who
was his mistress (and the model for his Madonnas). Other artists repre-
sented are the great Sienese painters Il Sodoma and Simone Martini, as
well as Filippo Lippi. The galleria’s decorative-arts collection contains not
only Italian pieces, but also fine imported objects, including some from
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 145

Japan. In addition to the permanent collections, the gallery regularly
houses special exhibits. Two hours should be enough for a complete visit.
See map p. 140. Via Barberini 18. % 06-4824184. We recommend that you book the
visit to the apartments in advance by calling % 06-328101. Metro: Barberini.
Admission: 5€ ($6). Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–7 p.m.
GNAM — Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Moderna
Villa Borghese
Housed in the beautiful Liberty-style (Italian Art Nouveau) Palazzo delle
Belle Arti, this important art museum preserves a rich collection of
modern work from the 19th and 20th centuries. Italian artists are well rep-
resented, but the collection includes pieces by all sorts of great artists. The
two sections dedicated to the 19th century hold a great selection of paint-
ings by artists of the Macchiaioli movement and a number of works by
French modern artists such as Rodin, van Gogh, and Monet, but the real
riches are in the two sections dedicated to the 20th century, where you can
admire a profusion of artwork by De Chirico, Giorgio Morandi, Marino
Marini, Lucio Fontana, and Giò Pomodoro, to name some highlights. The
collection also includes international names such as Pollock, Calder, and
Tápies, among others. Schedule about two hours for your visit.
GNAM’s new annex, MAXXI (Via Reni 2, off Piazza Apollodoro; % 06-
3202438; www.maxximuseo.org), is housed in the ex-Barracs Montello
nearby; it holds the museum’s 21st-century collection. Admission is free;
hours are Tuesday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
See map p. 140. Viale delle Belle Arti 131. % 06-322981, or 06-3234000 for reserva-
tions. www.gnam.arti.beniculturali.it. Tram: 3 or 19. Admission: 6.50€
($7.80). Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.
National Etruscan Museum of Villa Giulia
Villa Borghese
This splendid papal villa, built by the most prominent architects of the
16th century, houses the world’s most important Etruscan collection.
Originally from Asia Minor, the Etruscans were a mysterious people who
dominated Tuscany and Lazio, including Rome, up to the fifth century B.C.
Many of the objects in this museum came from Cerveteri, an important
Etruscan site northwest of Rome. One of the most spectacular objects is
the bride-and-bridegroom sarcophagus from the sixth century B.C., upon
which two enigmatic figures recline. You can also see a fairly well-
preserved chariot and some impressive sculptures. Some of the most
amazing works are the tiniest: The Etruscans made intricate decorative
objects from woven gold. (Their goldsmithing techniques remain a mys-
tery today.) In the summer, the garden is the site of musical events. Allow
about two hours for a visit.
See map p. 140. Piazzale di Villa Giulia 9. % 06 3226571. www.ticketeria.it.
Tram: 3 or 19 to last stop, then walk down Viale delle Belle Arti to Piazzale di Villa
Giulia; or 225 to Via di Villa Giulia. Admission: 4€ ($4.80). Open: Tues–Sun 
8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
146

Palatine Hill
Colosseo
This is one of our preferred spots in Rome: Huge blocks of brick sur-
rounded by trees and greenery testify to what was once an enormous resi-
dential complex of patrician houses and imperial palaces, built with the
grandiose ambitions of the emperors. The throne room of the Domus
Flavia was approximately 30m (100 ft.) wide by 39m (131 ft.) long. This hill
is also where Romulus drew the original square for the foundation of Rome
and the first houses were built: Excavations in the area uncovered remains
that date back to the eighth century B.C. — Casa di Livia (Livia’s House)
is one of the best-preserved homes. During the Middle Ages, the site was
transformed into a fortress, and during the Renaissance it again became
the residence of the aristocracy, who built large villas (the Horti Palatini,
built by the Farnese on top of the palaces of Tiberius and Caligula, for
example).
Housed in what was the Palace of Caesar — later transformed into a 
convent — the Palatine Museum preserves the most precious artwork
recovered from the archaeological excavations of the Palatino, including
frescoes and sculptures (admission is included in your ticket).
The ruins here are impressive, but may be confusing if you’re not on a
guided tour; we definitely recommend taking one. Depending on your pace
and whether you visit the museum, you should allow up to two and a half
hours for your visit.
See map p. 140. Via di San Gregorio 30 or Piazza Santa Maria Nova 53, off Piazza del
Colosseo. % 06-39967700. Metro: Colosseo. Bus: Minibus 117. Admission: 8€ ($9.60);
includes admission to the Colosseum. Guided tour 3.50€ ($4.20). Open: Daily 9 a.m. to
1 hour before sunset. Ticket booth closes 1 hour earlier. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
Palazzo Altemps (National Roman Museum)
Piazza Navona
Situated behind Piazza Navona, this palazzo was begun sometime before
1477 and finished by Marco Sittico Altemps, who enlarged it at the end of
the 1500s. It was restored (in such a way that you can see the layers of
medieval, Renaissance, and later decoration) to house the Ludovisi
Collection, one of the world’s most famous private art collections — par-
ticularly strong in Greek and Roman sculpture as well as Egyptian works.
The most important piece is the Trono Ludovisi, a fifth-century-B.C. Greek
masterpiece, finely carved to depict Aphrodite Urania rising from the
waves on one side; a female figure offering incense on another; and a naked
female playing a flute on yet another. The remarkable Dying Gaul, depict-
ing a man apparently committing suicide with a sword, was commissioned
by Julius Caesar and placed in his gardens to commemorate his victories
in Gaul. The Ares Ludovisi, a statue restored by Bernini in 1622, is
believed by art historians to be a Roman copy of an earlier Greek work and
shows a warrior (possibly Achilles) at rest. The colossal head of Hera
(also known as Juno) is one of the best-known Greek sculptures; Goethe
wrote of it as his “first love” in Rome and said it was like “a canto of
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 147

Homer.” It has been identified as an idealized portrait of Antonia Augusta,
mother of Emperor Claudius. Plan to spend at least one hour here.
See map p. 140. Piazza Sant’Apollinare 46. % 06-39967700. Bus: Minibus 116 to Via
dei Coronari; then walk away from Piazza Navona. Admission: 7€ ($8.40); includes
admission to Palazzo Massimo. Audio guides: 4€ ($4.80). Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–
7:45 p.m. Ticket office closes 1 hour earlier. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
Palazzo Massimo alle Terme (National Roman Museum)
Repubblica
This is our favorite museum of antiquity in Rome. The collection of ancient
Roman art (from decades of excavations in Rome and the city’s environs)
is simply astounding — and includes, at the upper level, a magnificent col-
lection of floor mosaics and frescoes. Entire rooms from the Villa of Livia
on the Palatine Hill have been reconstructed here, so you can enjoy the
frescoes as they were meant to be seen. (Note: You can visit the fresco col-
lection by guided tour only — you can sign up when you enter, but it’s best
to book advance reservations.) On the lower floors, you’ll find a huge
sculpture collection that encompasses the striking satyr pouring wine, a
Roman copy of the original by Greek sculptor Praxiteles; the Daughter of
Niobe, from the Gardens of Sallust; and an Apollo copied from an original
by Phidias, one of the greatest ancient Greek sculptors. We also enjoyed
the interesting series of sculptures showing how the style of representa-
tion changed under various emperors, and even discussing the family
resemblances of the Claudians, Flavians, and other dynasties. 
Even the basement contains some fascinating things, such as a very well
done numismatic exhibit, with coins dating from the eighth century B.C.
through the 21st century and an explanation of the economy of ancient
Rome and of Renaissance Italy. There’s also the royal house of Savoy’s col-
lection of Roman jewelry, including many items from burial sites, such as
a rare Roman mummy of a child buried with her most precious belong-
ings. Allow a minimum of two hours for your visit, including the tour of
the frescoes.
See map p. 140. Largo di Villa Peretti 1. % 06-39967700. Metro: Line A or B to Termini.
Bus: 64 or 70. Admission: 7€ ($8.40); includes admission to Palazzo Altemps. Audio
guides: 4€ ($4.80). Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–7:45 p.m. Ticket office closes 1 hour ear-
lier. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
Pantheon
Navona/Pantheon
Rome’s best-preserved monument of antiquity, the imposing Pantheon was
built by the emperor Hadrian in A.D. 125 as a temple for all the gods (from
the ancient Greek pan theon, meaning “all gods”). It was eventually saved
from destruction by being transformed into a Christian church in A.D. 609.
The adjective that all descriptions of the Pantheon should contain is per-
fect: The building is 43m (142 ft.) wide and 43m (142 ft.) tall. The portico
is supported by huge granite columns, all but three of which are original,
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
148

and the bronze doors weigh 20 tons each. Inside, the empty niches sur-
rounding the space once contained marble statues of Roman gods; most
of the marble floor is also original. Animals were once sacrificed beneath
the beautiful coffered dome, whose 5.4m (18-ft.) hole (oculus) lets in the
light (and sometimes rain) of the Eternal City. An architectural marvel, this
dome inspired Michelangelo when he was designing the dome of St.
Peter’s. Also inside are the tombs of the painter Raphael and of two of the
kings of Italy.
Crowds always congregate out front on the Piazza della Rotonda, one of
the nicest squares in Rome; it’s lined with cafes and graced by a fountain
by Giacomo della Porta. A half-hour should be enough to take in the high-
lights of the monument, plus another hour to soak up the atmosphere from
the terrace of one of the cafes.
See map p. 140. Piazza della Rotonda. % 06-68300230. Bus: Minibus 116. Admission:
Free. Open: Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.; Sun 9 a.m.–6 p.m.; holidays 9 a.m.–1 p.m.
Piazza di Spagna and the Spanish Steps
Piazza di Spagna
The Piazza and its famous steps are one of the favorite meeting places of
Rome — in high season, it’s packed with wall-to-wall tourists, lovers, back-
packers, Roman youths, and so on. The atmosphere is festive and con-
vivial, and especially romantic in spring, when the steps are decorated
with colorful azaleas.
The piazza’s name dates to the 16th century, when the Spanish ambassa-
dor made his residence here. In those days, the piazza was far less hos-
pitable. (People passing through at night sometimes disappeared, because
it was technically Spanish territory, and the unwary could be press-ganged
into the Spanish army.) In more recent times, the area’s most famous resi-
dent was English poet John Keats, who lived and died in the house to the
right of the steps, which is now the Keats–Shelley Memorial House
(% 06-6784235; open Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–6 p.m., Sat 11 a.m.–2 p.m.
and 3–6 p.m.; admission: 3€/$3.60). When you climb the steps, you’ll find
their real name: Scalinata della Trinità dei Monti, because they lead to the
Trinità dei Monti church, whose towers loom above. At the foot of the
steps, the boat-shaped fountain by Pietro Bernini, father of Gian Lorenzo,
is one of the most famous in Rome.

Piazza Navona
Navona/Pantheon
Our favorite piazza in Rome, this is the most beautiful and also one of the
most popular hangouts. Built on the ruins of the Stadium of Domitian from
the first century A.D., where chariot races were held (note the oval track
form), it has kept its public role to this day: Between the 17th and 19th
centuries, the bottom of the square was flooded for float parades in the
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 149

summer; now it is where the traditional Epiphany market is held during
the Christmas period.
The piazza is dominated by the twin-towered facade of Santa Agnese in
Agone, a baroque masterpiece by Borromini, who renovated and rebuilt
the original church, which had been constructed on the site between the
8th and the 12th centuries. The interior was also redecorated in the 17th
century, but on the lower level, you’ll find vestiges of Domitian’s stadium,
with an ancient Roman mosaic floor. The square’s other great baroque
masterpiece is Bernini’s Fountain of the Four Rivers, with massive figures
representing the Nile, Danube, della Plata, and Ganges (the figure with the
shrouded head is the Nile, as its source was unknown at the time). Built in
1651, it is crowned by an obelisk, a Roman copy from Domitian’s time. This
fountain came as a monumental addition to the two simple fountains
already existing at each end of the square and created in 1576 by Giacomo
della Porta. They were decorated with figures only later: Bernini designed
the figures of the Fountain of the Moor at the piazza’s south end (the tri-
tons and other ornaments are 19th-century copies made to replace the
originals, which were moved to the Villa Borghese lake garden), while the
figures of the Fountain of Neptune, at the piazza’s north end, were added
in the 19th century for balance.
On the southeast side of the square is the famous Palazzo Braschi, which
opened its doors in 2002 after being closed for 15 years. It houses the
Museo di Roma, which covers the cultural, social, and artistic life of the
city from the Middle Ages to the first half of the 20th century. The palazzo
is an attraction in itself, a baroque palace with a grand staircase (Via di
San Pantaleo 10; % 06-67108346; www.museodiroma.comune.roma.it;
open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–7 p.m.; admission: 6.20€/$7.40).

Roman Forum
Colosseo
This was the heart of ancient Rome’s public life, including markets, meet-
ing places, and major religious and administrative buildings. Gradually
expanded by the various emperors with the so-called Imperial Forums
along Via dei Fori Imperiali, it joined the Capitoline hill — where the great
Jupiter Temple was — and the Palatine hill, where the royal palace and
those of other noble families were located, along a central street: the Via
Sacra (“sacred way”), which you can still walk today. The oldest part of
the forum is the Cloaca Massima, a huge drainage and sewage canal built
under the forum to drain the existing marshes at the end of the seventh
century B.C., and still in use today. The forum has many ruins (some, like
the sanctuary of the sewer goddess Venus Cloaca, are just a mark on the
ground) as well as a few standing buildings. The most important is the
square Curia, where the Senate once met; most of the walls were heavily
restored in 1937, but the marble-inlay floor inside is original, from the third
century A.D. Also well preserved is the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina
(the emperor Antoninus Pius, who succeeded Hadrian in A.D. 138), which
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
150

was turned into a church and given a baroque facade (as the Chiesa di San
Lorenzo in Miranda). Near the Curia is the Arch of Septimius Severus,
built in A.D. 203 to commemorate his victories. The arch mentioned his two
sons, Caracalla and Geta, but Caracalla had Geta’s name removed after
murdering him. At the other end of the forum is the Arch of Titus, who
reigned as emperor from A.D. 79 to 81. Nearby is the hulking form of the
fourth-century Basilica of Constantine and Maxentius, Rome’s law courts.
You can buy a map at the entrance to make sense of all the structures, but
we recommend taking a guided tour. The tour in English is at 10:30 a.m.
daily; it’s best to make advance reservations. Allow about 45 minutes for
a visit.

San Giovanni in Laterano and Cloister
Colosseo
Built in A.D. 318 by Constantine, this is Rome’s cathedral (St. Peter’s is in
the separate city-state of the Vatican). It suffered many indignities during
its existence, including being sacked by the Vandals (a barbarian tribe
whose name has given us the word vandalism), burned, and then damaged
in an 896 earthquake. The basilica was restored and rebuilt at various
times; the facade, designed and executed by Alessandro Galilei in 1735, is
crowned by 15 giant statues (7m/22 ft. tall) representing Christ, St. John
the Baptist, John the Evangelist, and others; you can see them from many
parts of Rome.
The interior of the basilica as you see it today was redesigned by
Borromini in the 17th century. The papal altar — under a beautiful 14th-
century baldacchino (canopy) — preserves an important relic: the wooden
altar on which Peter and the other paleo-Christian popes after him are said
to have celebrated mass in ancient Rome’s catacombs. In the left transept
is the altar of the Santissimo Sacramento, decorated with four giant gilded-
bronze columns that are the only remains of the original basilica. Under
the baldacchino of this altar is another important relic, said to be the table
of Christ’s Last Supper. The apse was redone during the 19th century, and
its mosaics are copies of the original medieval mosaics. However, the
fresco fragment depicting Pope Boniface VIII, who declared the first Papal
Jubilee in 1300, is from the 14th century. The Baptistery was built by
Constantine in the fourth century, which would make it the first of the
Western world — except that only the walls are original, while the interior
decoration was restored several times and last redesigned by Borromini
(hence the title goes to the baptistery of the Duomo of Naples, still bear-
ing its original mosaics; see Chapter 18).
From a side door, you can access the delightful 13th-century cloister, a
showcase for carvings and other art pieces from the older basilica, includ-
ing paleo-Christian inscriptions. Outside is an Egyptian obelisk, the tallest
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 151

in Rome (32m/105 ft.), consecrated in the fourth century as a symbol of
Christianity’s victory over pagan cults. Set aside at least an hour for your
visit here.

St. Peter’s Basilica
See “Visiting the Vatican’s Top Attractions,” later in this chapter.
Trajan’s Market and Trajan’s Forum
Colosseo
Many Roman emperors added luxurious public constructions to the origi-
nal Roman Forum (see listing earlier in this chapter), and each new forum
was named after the emperor who built it. Emperor Trajan added the most
splendid of them all, an elegant open space — Trajan’s Forum — over-
looked by a tall curved building — Trajan’s Market. Unfortunately, many
of the temples and decorations were dismantled during the Middle Ages
and the Renaissance, when the marble was used for other construction,
but the archaeological remains are still fascinating — plus you get to walk
along an original ancient Roman alley lined with what is believed to have
been small osterie. Walking north along the Via dei Fori Imperiali from the
Colosseum, you can see the archaeological site from the outside (to your
right), but a visit to the impressive brick complex itself affords an unfor-
gettable experience. This second-century structure housed stalls and
small boutiques — sort of an ancient mall — as well as meeting places.
Note: Most of the Imperial Fori were covered in the 1920s to build Via dei
Fori Imperiali, a major transportation artery; today, the whole area is being
dug up in the largest Roman archaeological excavation to date. The plan
is to exhibit the findings in Trajan’s Market. To accommodate the excava-
tion, visitors are temporarily limited to Trajan’s Forum and part of the
semicircular building; the temporary entrance is from Trajan’s Column off
Piazza Venezia, and the reduced admission is 3.20€ ($3.80). Count on
about 40 minutes for this reduced visit.
Via 4 Novembre 94. % 06-6790048. Admission: 3.20€ ($3.80). Open: Tues–Sun

A pocketful of change
In many of Rome’s churches, fragile paintings are kept in semi-obscurity, but you will
often find a light box nearby. When you insert a coin or two, a light pops on to illumi-
nate a painting, fresco, or sculpture for a limited amount of time. Therefore, carrying
a pocketful of coins is always a good idea.

Trevi Fountain
Trevi
The imposing Trevi Fountain, fronting its own little piazza, existed for cen-
turies in relative obscurity before it became one of the must-see sights of
Rome, thanks to the film Three Coins in the Fountain. Today, it seems that
many of the thousands who clog the space in front of it don’t take the time
to really look at it — instead, they throw coins in it, have their pictures
taken in front of it, and go on their way. If you want a tranquil moment to
actually appreciate the artwork, you must visit late at night or early in the
morning. The fountain was begun by Bernini and Pietro da Cortona, but
there was a 100-year lapse before it was completed, in 1751, by Nicola Salvi.
The central figure is Neptune, who guides a chariot pulled by plunging sea
horses. Tritons (mythological sea dwellers) guide the horses, and the sur-
rounding scene is one of wild nature and bare stone.
Of course, you still have to toss a coin in the Trevi, something all kids love
to do. To do it properly (Romans are superstitious), hold the coin in your
right hand, turn your back to the fountain, and toss the coin over your left
shoulder. According to tradition, the spirit of the fountain will then see to
it that you return to Rome one day.
See map p. 140. Piazza di Trevi. Bus: 62 or Minibus 116 or 119. Take Via Poli to the
fountain.
Visiting the Vatican’s Top Attractions
In 1929, the Lateran Treaty between Pope Pius XI and the Italian govern-
ment recognized the independent state of the Holy See, with its physical
seat in Vatican City (St. Peter’s Basilica and adjacent buildings). Politically
independent from Italy, the Vatican is the world’s second-smallest sover-
eign state, with its own administration, post office, and tourist office. The
Vatican comprises St. Peter’s Basilica, the Vatican Museums, and the
Vatican Gardens, all reviewed in this section.
Make your first stop the Vatican Information Office (% 06-69884466;
open Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m.–7 p.m.) — it’s just to the left of the entrance to
St. Peter’s. In the tourist office, you can get a plan of the basilica — very
useful, given the sheer size of the thing — and make a reservation for a
tour of the Vatican Gardens. You can also find the Vatican Post Office —
with nice stamps and reliable service — and public restrooms.
Consider that at the Vatican, even the men wear ankle-length gowns, and
the most popular color is black. Bare shoulders and thighs — this means
halter tops, tank tops, shorts, and skirts above the knee — will definitely
result in your being turned away from the basilica. This is, after all, the
center of a world religion, not just a tourist extravaganza.
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 153

Piazza San Pietro
San Pietro
One of the world’s greatest public spaces, this piazza was designed by
Bernini. As you stand in the huge square (no cars allowed), you’ll find
yourself in the arms of an ellipse that’s partly enclosed by a majestic Doric-
pillared colonnade, atop which stand statues of some 140 saints. Straight
ahead is the facade of St. Peter’s Basilica; the two statues flanking the
entrance represent St. Peter and St. Paul, Peter carrying the Keys to 
the Kingdom. To the right, above the colonnade, are the ocher buildings
of the papal apartments and the Vatican Museums. In the center of the
square is an Egyptian obelisk, brought from the ancient city of Heliopolis
on the Nile delta. On either side are 17th-century fountains — the one on
the right by Carlo Maderno, who designed the facade of St. Peter’s, was
placed here by Bernini himself; the one on the left is by Carlo Fontana. The
piazza is particularly magical at night during the Christmas season, when
a presepio (nativity scene) and a large tree take center stage.
See map p. 140. Bus: 62 or 64 to Via della Conciliazione; follow it to the end. Metro:
Ottaviano/San Pietro; take Via di Porta Angelica and follow it to the end.
St. Peter’s Basilica
San Pietro
In 324, Emperor Constantine commissioned a sanctuary to be built on the
site of St. Peter’s tomb. The first apostle was thought to have been buried
here under a simple stone, and excavation and studies commissioned by
the Vatican under the Basilica have confirmed that thesis. The original
basilica stood for about 1,000 years, but with its accrued importance and
stability, the papacy decided it was time for renovations. Work began in
1503, following designs by the architects Sangallo and Bramante. Then
Michelangelo was appointed to finish the magnificent dome in 1547, but
he died — in 1564 — before seeing the work completed, and his disciple
Giacomo della Porta finished the job.
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
154
How to attend a papal audience
Many Catholics who come to Rome like to attend a papal audience, during which the
pope addresses a small crowd of people gathered in the Vatican (of course, you don’t
have to be Catholic to attend). To do so (on Wed only; entrance between 10 and 10:30
a.m.), you must get free tickets from the Prefecture of the Papal Household (%
06-69883114), at the bronze door under Piazza San Pietro’s right-hand colonnade
(Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–1 p.m.). To get tickets in advance, write to the Prefecture of the Papal
Household, 00120 Città del Vaticano, indicating your language, the dates of your visit,
the number of people in your party, and (if possible) the hotel in Rome to which the
office should send your tickets the afternoon before the audience.

The inside of the basilica is almost too huge to take in — walking from one
end to the other is a workout, and the opulence will overpower you. On
the right as you enter is Michelangelo’s exquisite Pietà, created when the
master was in his early 20s. (Because of an act of vandalism in the 1970s,
the statue is kept behind reinforced glass.) Dominating the central nave is
Bernini’s 29m-tall (96-ft.) baldaquin, supported by richly decorated twist-
ing columns. Completed in 1633, it was criticized for being excessive and
because the bronze was supposedly taken from the Pantheon. The canopy
stands over the papal altar, which in turn stands over the symbolic tomb
of St. Peter. A bronze statue of St. Peter (probably by Arnolfo di Cambio,
13th century) marks the tomb; its right foot has been worn away by the
millions of pilgrims kissing it in the traditional devotional gesture to salute
the pope. By the apse, above an altar, is the bronze throne sculpted by
Bernini to house the remains of what is, according to legend, the chair of
St. Peter.
To visit Michelangelo’s dome and marvel at the astounding view, you have
to climb some 491 steps. Make sure that you’re ready and willing to climb,
however, because after you’ve started up, you’re not allowed to turn
around and go back down. If you want to take the elevator as far as it goes,
it’ll save you 171 steps. You must make a reservation for the elevator when
you buy your ticket to enter the dome (you’ll pay an additional 1€/$1.20).
On busy days, expect to wait in line to get a lift.
Beneath the basilica are grottoes, extending under the central nave of the
church. You can visit them and wander among the tombs of popes. The
excavations proceed farther down, to the paleo-Christian tombs and
architectural fragments of the original basilica that have been found
here, but you need to apply in writing at least three weeks beforehand to
arrange for a visit. Plan on at least two hours to see the entire basilica.
See map p. 140. Piazza San Pietro. % 06-69883712. Bus: 62 or 64 to Via della
Conciliazione. Metro: Ottaviano/San Pietro. Take Viale Angelico to the Vatican.
Admission: Basilica and grottoes free; dome 4€ ($4.80), with elevator 5€ ($6). Open:
Oct–Mar basilica daily 7 a.m.–6 p.m., dome daily 8 a.m.–4:45 p.m.; Apr–Sept basilica
daily 7 a.m.–7 p.m., dome daily 8 a.m.–5:45 p.m.; grottoes daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m.
Vatican Gardens
San Pietro
People often think the Vatican is made up of only the basilica and the muse-
ums, but behind those walls lies a busy town surrounding a huge — and
splendid — park. You can catch a glimpse of the park from the windows of
the Vatican Museums, revealing groomed grounds, fountains, and elegant
Renaissance buildings. Although normally you need a special permit to
enter the Vatican grounds, you can sign up for a special guided tour that
takes small numbers of visitors to the gardens. These tours last two hours
and start by bus. If you’ve forgotten to make a reservation in advance (by
phone or fax), try to sign up directly at the Vatican Information Office (see
contact information at the beginning of this section) — it may be able to fit
you in on an upcoming tour.

Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel
San Pietro
This enormous complex of museums could swallow up your entire vaca-
tion, with its tons of Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek, Roman, paleo-Christian,
and Renaissance art. Among the several museums, the Gregorian
Egyptian Museum holds a fantastic collection of Egyptian artifacts; the
Gregorian Etruscan Museum, a beautiful collection of Etruscan art and
jewelry; the Ethnological Missionary Museum, a large collection of arti-
facts from every continent, including superb African, Asian, and Australian
art; and the Pinacoteca (Picture Gallery) — the most famous of the
Vatican Museums — contains works by medieval and Renaissance mas-
ters. In Room 9 of the Pinacoteca is Leonardo da Vinci’s St. Jerome, which
has been pieced back together — one piece had ended up as a stool seat
in a shoemaker’s shop; the other, as a tabletop in an antiques shop. In
Room 2 is Giotto’s luminous Stefaneschi Triptych; in Room 8, Raphael’s
Transfiguration. Other highlights include works by Beato Angelico,
Perugino, Bernini, and Caravaggio (a single but great painting, the
Deposition from the Cross).
Also part of the museums are the Stanze di Raffaello, which translates as
Raphael’s Rooms, although they are in fact the private apartments of Pope
Julius II, which were frescoed by the artist. The largest of the four rooms
is that of Constantine, painted between 1517 and 1524, which illustrates
key moments in the life of the first Christian emperor, including his tri-
umph over Maxentius and his vision of the cross. Along the way, you’ll
come across the Borgia Apartments, designed for Pope Alexander VI (the
infamous Borgia pope), and the Chapel of Nicola V, with floor-to-ceiling
frescoes by Fra Angelico.
Of course, it’s the Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo’s masterpiece, that is the
crowning glory of the museums. Years after their restoration, conflict con-
tinues over whether too much paint was removed, flattening the figures.
On the other hand, the brilliant color has been restored. Whether you like
the colors of the drapery or not, Michelangelo’s modeling of the human
form is incredible. The most famous scenes are the Creation of Adam and
the temptation and fall of Adam and Eve. Michelangelo also painted a ter-
rifying and powerful Last Judgment on the end wall.
Binoculars or even a hand mirror will help you appreciate the Sistine ceil-
ing better; your neck will tire long before you can take it all in. Just think
how poor Michelangelo must have felt while painting it flat on his back
atop a tower of scaffolding!
Visiting the whole museum complex in one day is impossible. If you don’t
want to take a guided tour, you can follow one of the four color-coded itin-
eraries (A, B, C, or D), taking you to the highlights of the museums. They
range from one and a half to five hours, and all end at the Sistine Chapel.

works; select what you want to hear by pressing a work’s labeled number.
The museums are free the last Sunday of each month — and everyone
knows it. Be prepared for huge mobs — or pay your way at another time.

Finding More Cool Things to See and Do
Once you’ve covered all of Rome’s musts — and there are plenty —
you’ll still have plenty to choose from. Below are a few more of our
favorite attractions. For more, see our Rome For Dummies.
 Behind Caracalla Baths (see earlier in this chapter) starts the beau-
tiful Archaeological Park of the Appian Way (% 06-5130682; www.
parcoappiaantica.org; Bus: Archeobus, 118, 218, or 360; free
admission). Here, you can walk over an original section of what 
the ancient Romans called the Regina Viarum (Queen of Roads).
Started in 312 B.C. as the highway to Capua, the road was progres-
sively extended to reach Benevento (233km/146 miles to the south-
east), then Taranto (an extra 281km/176 miles), and finally all the
way to Brindisi (another 70km/40 miles). It was on this road that St.
Peter, in flight from Rome, had his vision of Jesus and turned back
toward his martyrdom. The street is still paved with the original
large, flat basalt stones and lined with the remains of villas, tombs,
and monuments against the background of the beautiful country-
side. Besides the Catacombs of San Callisto (see earlier in this
chapter), we think the most interesting attractions are the
Mausoleum of Cecilia Metella (Via Appia Antica 161) and the
impressive Villa dei Quintili (Via Appia Nuova 1092). All archaeo-
logical sites (% 06-39967700; Admission: 6€/$7.20; includes admis-
sion to Caracalla Baths, Villa dei Quintili, and Mausoleum of Cecilia
Metella) are open Tuesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to one hour
before sunset. The best way to visit this park’s attractions is via the
hop-on/hop-off Archeobus (see “Seeing Rome by Guided Tour,”
later in this chapter) or by renting bicycles at the park visitor
center, Cartiera Latina (Via Appia Antica 42), or at the Bar Caffè
dell’Appia Antica (Via Appia Antica 175). Bikes rent for 3€ ($3.60)
per hour or 10€ ($12) for the whole day.
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
158

 Surrounding the Galleria Borghese (see earlier in this chapter),
you’ll find Villa Borghese, one of Rome’s most beautiful parks,
dotted with pretty pavilions and graced by a romantic small lake
where you can rent rowboats. Inside the park is also the Piazza di
Siena, a picturesque oval track surrounded by tall pines, used for
horse races and for Rome’s international horse-jumping event, the
Concorso Ippico Internazionale di Roma, in May (see Chapter 3).
The park connects to the south to the famous Pincio Gardens,
with their panoramic terrace overlooking Piazza del Popolo —
another one of Rome’s wonderful piazze — and offering one of the
best views of the city, particularly striking at sunset.
 A wonderful way to experience Rome is by sailing down the Tiber
on a boat tour with the Compagnia di Navigazione Ponte San
Angelo (% 06-6789361; www.battellidiroma.it); it offers day
and evening cruises leaving from the pier at Ponte Umberto I, off
Via Zanardelli, east of Castel Sant’Angelo. Prices range from 12€
($14) for a day cruise to 53€ ($64) for the candlelight dinner 
cruise. If you’re feeling cheap or need a way to amuse the kids,
there’s also regular boat service with stops at the following
bridges: Risorgimento, Cavour, Sant’Angelo, Sisto, Isola Tiberina,
and Ripa Grande. A single fare is only 1€ ($1.20); you can get a
daily pass for 3€ ($3.60).
 Opening onto a piazza graced by an early baroque fountain, Santa
Maria in Trastevere (Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere; % 06-
5814802; Bus: 23; Tram: 8; Admission: Free; Open: Daily 8 a.m.–
12:30 p.m. and 4 p.m.–7:30 p.m.) is believed to be the first Roman
church to be officially opened to the public in the third century A.D.
The stars of the show are the beautifully preserved original mosaics
decorating the apse. Over the main altar is another famous work: the
Madonna della Clemenza, a unique painting from the sixth century.
 The Doria Pamphili family still live in their 18th-century Roman
palazzo, but you’re welcome to visit their picture gallery and his-
toric apartments. A bit worn and dusty, the Galleria Doria Pamphili
(Piazza del Collegio Romano 1/A; % 06-6797323; www.doria
pamphilj.it; Bus: Minibus 62, 116, 117, or 119) nonetheless
houses some superb artwork, including paintings by Filippo Lippi,
Raphael, Caravaggio, Tiziano, and our favorite: Velázquez’s portrait
of Pope Innocent X. The gallery is open Friday through Wednesday
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; closed on major holidays. It is also open on
some evenings for classical concerts, which you can combine with
a visit to the galleries. Admission is 8€ ($9.60), or 12€ ($14) with
the concert.
 Even if you aren’t a musician, you’ll love the incredible variety of
instruments — some of them true works of art — housed in the
National Museum of Musical Instruments (Piazza Santa Croce in
Gerusalemme 9a; % 06-7014796; www.museostrumentimusicali.
it). Begun with the private collection of famous Italian tenor Evan
Gorga (he was the first Rodolfo in Puccini’s Boheme, back in 1896),
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 159

it now counts over 3,000 pieces stretching from antiquity to the
19th century. Admission is 2€ ($2.40), more for special exhibits; 
it’s open Tuesday through Sunday from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
 The church of Santa Maria Maggiore (Piazza di Santa Maria
Maggiore; % 06-483195; Metro: Termini; Bus: 70; Admission: Free;
Open: Daily 7 a.m.–6:45 p.m.) is one of Rome’s four great basilicas.
Started in the fourth century A.D., it was later given a baroque
facade. Inside are the original Byzantine mosaics (apse and side
walls), the 12th-century Cosmatesque-style (mosaic in marble and
colored stones) floors, and the 15th-century coffered wooden ceil-
ing, richly decorated with gold (said to be the first gold brought
back from the New World and donated by the Spanish queen). To
the right of the altar is the tomb of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Italy’s
most important baroque sculptor/architect.
 Not exactly a picture gallery, the elegant early-16th-century Villa
Farnesina (Via della Lungara 230; % 06-68027268; www.lincei.it;
Bus: 23; Tram: 8; Admission: 5€/$6; Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–1 p.m.)
was frescoed by Raphael and other artists. Built as a noble resi-
dence for the Chigi and then the Farnese family, it is today the seat
of the Accademia dei Lincei, a major Italian cultural institute, and 
of the National Print Gallery, the largest print collection in Italy.
 Only a few metro stops away from the center of Rome, the ruins 
of Ostia Antica (Viale dei Romagnoli 717, off Via Ostiense; % 06-
56358099; www.itnw.roma.it/ostia/scavi; Admission:
4€/$4.80; Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–4 p.m. in winter, 9 a.m.–6 p.m. in
summer), ancient Rome’s seaport and shipyard, are less preserved
than Pompeii — they weren’t buried under a volcanic eruption, after
all — but the site is still impressive. You’ll walk on Roman roads and
see the theater (where shows are held in summer; see “Living It Up
After Dark,” later in this chapter), temples, and homes. We recom-
mend signing up for an official guided tour of the archaeological
area. You can reach the site by subway or by boat (see later in this
chapter for boat tours on the Tiber).
 One of the locals’ preferred destinations is the small town of Tivoli,
only 40 minutes away by train (frequent departures from Tiburtina
rail station) or coach (from Rebibbia metro stop). You can visit two
interesting villas here: the splendid remains of Ancient Roman
Emperor Hadrian’s Villa (Via di Villa Adriana, 5km/31⁄2 miles from
the center of Tivoli; % 0774-530203; Bus: 4 or 4X from Largo
Garibaldi, Tivoli’s main square; Admission: 6.50€/$7.80; Open: 
Daily 9 a.m.–sunset; ticket booth closes 90 minutes earlier), maybe
the most beautiful Roman villa that ever was; and the elegant
Renaissance Villa d’Este (Piazza Trento, west of Largo Garibaldi,
Tivoli’s main square; % 199-766166 within Italy and 0424-600460
from abroad; www.villadestetivoli.info; Admission: 6.50€/
$7.80; Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m. to one hour before sunset; ticket
booth closes one hour earlier), with a unique garden full of foun-
tains that are an engineering marvel — and a wonderfully cool

160

place to be on a hot afternoon. Dining is also a major draw, as the
local restaurants have a good reputation for traditional dishes —
such as the tasty cannelloni. Try the Albergo Ristorante Adriano
(Via di Villa Adriana 194, near the ticket booth to Villa Adriana; 
% 0774-382235; Open: Lunch daily, dinner Mon–Sat).
Seeing Rome by Guided Tour
The French writer Stendhal once wrote, “As soon as you enter Rome, get
in a carriage and ask to be brought to the Coliseum [sic] or to St. Peter’s.
If you try to get there on foot, you will never arrive: Too many marvelous
things will stop you along the way.”
Once you arrive in Rome, taking an introductory bus tour of this compli-
cated city is still an excellent idea. Doing so will help you get a general
feel for the place and give you an idea of what you’d like to see in depth.
Bus tours
We like the hop-on/hop-off formula: You can stay on to take the complete
tour and listen to the guide, and then start again and get off at the vari-
ous stops. Here are the best in Rome:
 The 110 Open (% 800-281281 in Italy, or 06-46952252; www.tram
bus.com) double-decker buses leave from Piazza dei Cinquecento
(across from Termini train station) every 20 minutes between 
8:40 a.m. and 8:20 p.m. and make ten stops at Rome’s major attrac-
tions. At the same spot, you can also get on the Archeobus, which
stops at 15 archaeological sites including the Park of the Via Appia
(see earlier in this chapter). The 16-seat electric buses leave daily
every 40 minutes between 9:45 a.m. and 4:45 p.m. Tickets — sold
on board — cost 13€ ($16) for the 110 Open and 8€ ($9.60) for the
Archeobus (children under six ride free) and are valid for one day;
you can also get a 20€ ($24) combination ticket valid on both bus
tours.
 Leaving from a stop nearby are the Roma Cristiana (% 06-
68809625; e-mail: roma.cristiana@serviziroma.com) double-decker
buses, a similar operation run by the Vatican. The tour makes 16
stops at all of the most important Roman churches and basilicas;
buses run daily with departures every 30 minutes between 8:30 a.m.
and 7:30 p.m. Tickets cost 13€ ($16) and are valid 24 hours.
If you prefer a more traditional bus tour, several options are available.
Tours usually depart around 9 a.m., 3 p.m., and 8 p.m. — with possible
pickup from your hotel included. A three-hour tour will cost about 28€
($34). The best operators are: Appian Line (Piazza dell’Esquilino 6; 
% 06-487861; www.appianline.it), Green Line (Via Farini 5/A; % 06-
483787; www.greenlinetours.com), and Vastours (Via Piemonte 34; 
% 06-4814309; www.vastours.it).
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 161

Walking tours
Enjoy Rome (Via Varese 39, 3 blocks north off the side of Stazione
Termini; % 06-4451843; www.enjoyrome.com; Metro: Termini) offers a
variety of three-hour walking tours, including a night tour that takes you
through the historic center, plus a tour of Trastevere and the Jewish
Ghetto. All tours cost 21€ ($25) for adults and 15€ ($18) for those under
26, which includes admission to some attractions. The office is open
Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 3:30 to 6:30 p.m.,
Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Enjoy Rome also organizes bike tours
with English-speaking guides.
Boat tours
You can enjoy a simple ride down the Tiber or sign up for a special
cruise with Compagnia di Navigazione Ponte San Angelo (see “Finding
More Cool Things to See and Do,” earlier in this chapter). Our favorite is
the special cruise to Ostia Antica, which includes a two-hour stop at the
archaeological area. It leaves Friday through Sunday from Ponte Marconi
(Bus: 170) at 9:15 a.m. and returns at 4 p.m. (but check with the com-
pany, as schedules vary). The cost is 13€ ($16) for adults, 7€ ($8.40) for
children 6 to 12, and free for children under six; you can also skip the
return and take the metro, if you’re pressed for time, but the one-way
price is just 1€ ($1.20) less. You’ll need to make reservations in advance
for this tour.
Suggested One-, Two-, and 
Three-Day Itineraries
So much to see, so little time. In the following three itineraries, we make
recommendations on how best to spend your time in Rome.
Rome in one day
It’s a tall order to try to see the Eternal City in what amounts to the blink
of an eye. But if you don’t have more time, then here it is: Head to the
Termini train station early in the morning and take the 110 Open Stop &
Go bus tour. Get off at the Colosseum for a visit; then walk through the
Roman Forum. Hop on the bus again and get off at the stop near Piazza
Navona to visit this famous square. Afterward, stroll to the nearby
Pantheon and have lunch at Maccheroni. Enjoy some shopping in the
area before getting back on your bus. Head to St. Peter’s Basilica, where
you’ll get off to visit the church. After your visit, climb back on the bus
and continue to the stop near Fontana di Trevi for a visit to the world’s
most famous fountain. Then head toward Piazza di Spagna and the
Spanish Steps, enjoying a bit of shopping on your way. Have a special
dinner at La Pergola (see Chapter 11).
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
162

Rome in two days
If you have two days in Rome, you can spend time absorbing the sights
rather than just seeing them and moving on. You also don’t have to
make as many painful choices.
Day 1
You can begin as in the “Rome in one day” itinerary, above, but spend
more time visiting the archaeological area, including the Colosseum,
Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill. Have lunch at Pizza Forum (see
Chapter 11). In the afternoon, head for Galleria Borghese, where you
have made reservations in advance. After your visit, stroll down through
the Pincio Gardens overlooking Piazza del Popolo, if possible at sunset.
Have your aperitivo here at La Casina Valadier.
Day 2
Get up early and head for the Vatican Museums to see the Sistine
Chapel, and continue your visit with St. Peter’s Basilica. You’ll then be
ready for a good lunch at Dante Taberna de’ Gracchi (see Chapter 11).
Take a peek at Piazza Navona and the Pantheon on your way to the
Spanish Steps and Piazza di Spagna. Stroll to the Trevi Fountain and
have your last dinner in Rome at La Pergola (see Chapter 11).
Rome in three days
Day 1
Head to Termini train station and take the 110 Open Stop & Go bus
tour: an excellent way to orient yourself in Rome as well as a means of
transportation between attractions. Stop at the Colosseum and spend
your morning imbibing in ancient Rome, visiting the Roman Forum and
Palatine Hill as well. After a nice lunch at Hostaria Nerone, get back on
your bus and finish the tour (it’s a loop) to scope out the rest of the city.
Get off at the stop near Piazza Navona to visit this famous square; then
stroll over to the Pantheon for a visit. Have dinner at Maccheroni or 
Il Convivio Troiani, depending on your budget (see Chapter 11).
Day 2
Get up early and head for the Vatican Museums to see the Sistine Chapel,
and continue your visit with St. Peter’s Basilica. You’ll then be ready for 
a good lunch at Dante Taberna de’ Gracchi (see Chapter 11). In the 
afternoon, see Castel Sant’Angelo and cross the river Tiber over Ponte
Sant’Angelo. You can then walk north along the river and turn right at Via
del Clementino toward the Spanish Steps and Piazza di Spagna. Head
over to the Trevi Fountain and have dinner at Presidente.
Day 3
In the morning, explore the funky medieval neighborhood of Trastevere,
on the south side of the river Tiber, visiting the Villa Farnesina and
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 163

Santa Maria in Trastevere. In the afternoon, head for Galleria Borghese,
where you have made reservations in advance. After your visit, stroll
down through the Pincio Gardens overlooking Piazza del Popolo, if pos-
sible at sunset. Have your aperitivo here at La Casina Valadier, and then
head to La Pergola for your last dinner in Rome.
Shopping the Local Stores
People say Rome isn’t good for shopping, at least not compared to Milan
(the fashion capital of Italy). That may be true, but there is certainly a
vast array of goods for sale in the capital city, not to mention a selection
of some items — antique prints, for instance — that other Italian cities
cannot match. You’ll also find bargains here if you know where to look —
and you’ll have a great time browsing in the process!
In terms of crafts, Rome isn’t as rich as it was in ages past. Alas, very 
few workshops still practice traditional arts. On the other hand, Rome is
the capital of the country, so you can find basically everything here —
including specialties from places that you may not have time to visit.
Best shopping areas
The best shopping area in Rome is the triangle of medieval and
Renaissance streets running between Piazza del Popolo, Piazza Venezia,
and Piazza di Spagna. On the exclusive Via Frattina and Via dei Condotti,
you’ll find the showrooms of all the big names of Italian fashion, from
Armani to Valentino. You’ll also see a lot of small shops specializing in
everything from stylish Italian housewares to antiques. The area’s main
artery, Via del Corso — now restricted to pedestrians (except for buses
and taxis) — is lined with shops ranging from fashionable to tacky and
selling everything from clothing to shoes to CDs. La Rinascente (Piazza
Colonna; % 06-6784209) is an elegant department store carrying mainly
clothes and accessories; across the street is the Galleria Alberto Sordi,
a shopping gallery with many nice shops and two bars.
The maze of medieval streets on the west side of the Corso, around the
Pantheon and Piazza Navona, hides a great trove of elegant and original
boutiques, along with some of the oldest establishments in Rome. The
area contains a huge variety of goods, from old prints to exclusive fash-
ions, books to antique furniture. The foot traffic is often lighter here than
on the Corso, which on major shopping days and holidays looks like
New York’s Fifth Avenue around Christmastime. You’ll find old craftsmen
shops on Via degli Sediari and Via Orsini; elegant men’s apparel at
Davide Cenci (Via Campo Marzio 1–7; % 06-6990681; Bus: Minibus 116
to Pantheon), which is popular with locals; and, just a stone’s throw
away, handsome clothes and shoes for women and men at Tombolini
(Via della Maddalena 31–38; % 06-69200342), which emphasizes time-
lessly classic styling rather than chic. If you really want to make your
friends green with envy, have a pair of shoes custom-made by Listo (Via
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
164

della Croce 76; % 06-6784567) or stop by Rome’s most special source of
intoxicants: Ai Monasteri (Corso Rinascimento 72; % 06-68802783; Bus:
Minibus 116), off the east side of Piazza Navona, selling liqueurs, elixirs,
and other alcoholic concoctions that Italian monks have been making
since the Middle Ages.
Another excellent shopping area is along Via Cola di Rienzo, in the Prati
neighborhood. This area is best for clothes and is also excellent for
shoes, with shops catering to every level of price and style. Stores line
both sides of Via Ottaviano and Via Cola di Rienzo.
For a dip into romantic medieval Rome and an interesting mix of artists’
workshops, crafts showrooms, and small shops selling anything from
mystic art to traditional food, head for Trastevere. Some of the shops
have been here for decades, while others are new ventures. Via della
Scala is the best, lined almost wall-to-wall with showrooms and work-
shops. One interesting shop is Pandora (Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere
6; % 06-5895658), which carries a great selection of Murano glass and
Italian designer goods; others are Modi e Materie (Vicolo del Cinque; 
% 06-5885280), with ceramics from the island of Sardinia; Ciliegia (Via
della Scala 5; % 06-5818149), specializing in fashions from Positano,
from handmade sandals and dresses to curios; and Guaytamelli (Via del
Moro 59; % 06-5880704), which sells sundials and other ancient time-
measuring instruments.
What to look for and where to find it
Shopping hours are generally Monday through Saturday from 9 or 
9:30 a.m. (later for boutiques) to about 1 or 1:30 p.m., and then from 
3:30 or 4 to 7:30 p.m.; most apparel boutiques are closed Monday morn-
ings, while food shops are closed Thursday afternoons. In the historic
center, however, many shops choose to stay open at lunchtime and on
Sundays.
Antiques
Rome is famous for its number of reputable antiques shops, and some 
of the best — and priciest — in town are on Via del Babuino and Via
Margutta (a reputable shop here is Dr. Sensi, Via Margutta 86; % 06-
3207643). Don’t miss Via dei Coronari, which is literally lined with
antiques shops: Whether it’s furniture, glass, lamps, or paintings, you’ll
find it here (a good shop among many is Dr. De Sanctis, Via dei Coronari
219; % 06-68801254). The fun continues on the more elegant Via Giulia;
for more casual shopping, try Via del Pellegrino.
Artwork and prints
If you had a euro for every picture that’s been drawn of the Forum over
the years, you could buy your own villa. Rome has been a magnet for
artists for centuries, and views of the city’s ancient and baroque monu-
ments are endlessly reproduced. For high-quality prints, two well-known
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 165

shops are Nardecchia (Piazza Navona 25; % 06-6869318; Bus: Minibus
116) and Alinari (Via Alibert 16/a; % 06-6792923; Metro: Line A to
Spagna). On the upscale Via del Babuino is Fava (Via del Babuino 180;
% 06-3610807; Metro: Line A to Spagna), specializing in Neapolitan
scenes. Antiquarius (Corso Rinascimento 63; % 06-68802941; Bus:
Minibus 116) is also worth a stop. If you’re not after museum-quality
prints, the nearby antiquarian book and print market, on Piazza
Fontanella Borghese (Bus: 81 or Minibus 117 or 119 to the Corso at Via
Tomacelli), is a great place to browse. If you know your stuff, you may
find some treasures — otherwise, caveat emptor (let the buyer beware),
to use a Roman (or at least Latin) phrase.
Books and magazines
Of course, it’s not always the case that you’re looking for something
Italian; the English Bookshop (Via di Ripetta 248; % 06-3203301; Bus:
Minibus 117 or 119 to Piazza del Popolo) stocks a wide variety of books
in — you guessed it — English, as does The Corner Bookshop (Via del
Moro 48; % 06-5836942), in Trastevere. The Libreria Babele (Via dei
Banchi Vecchi 116; % 06-6876628; Bus: Minibus 116 to Via dei Banchi) 
is Rome’s most central gay/lesbian bookstore. In addition, many of the
larger newsstands in the centro have English-language newspapers and
magazines as well as fiction bestsellers and some classics.
Clothing
Italian fashion is world famous. Around Piazza di Spagna, you’ll find all the
established names, including Fendi (Via Borgognona 39; % 06-696661),
Valentino (Via dei Condotti 13; % 06-6739420), Gucci (Via Condotti 8; 
% 06-6793888), Armani (Via dei Condotti 77; % 06-6991460), and
Emporio Armani (Via del Babuino 140; % 06-36002197), as well as
Battistoni (Via dei Condotti 61/a; % 06-697611) and Testa (Via Frattina
104; % 06-6791294) — both men’s clothing specialists. For some emerg-
ing dressmakers, try Scala Magica (Via della Scala 66; % 06-5894098) and
Scala 14 (Via della Scala 14; % 06-5883580), in Trastevere.
Crafts
Rome has an old tradition of crafts ranging from vimini (basketry) to iron-
work, plasterwork to mosaics (including reproductions of Roman and
Pompeian mosaics), pottery to jewelry and embroidery. For beautiful
ceramic work, try Ceramica Sarti (Via Santa Dorotea 21; % 06-5882079)
or the Compagnia del Corallo (Via del Corallo 27; % 06-6833697). For
elegant wrought iron, head to Nicola Arduini (Via degli Specchi 12; 
% 06-68805537). For plasterwork, including reproductions of antique
designs (some objects are small enough to take home; others can be
shipped), visit the Laboratorio Marani (Via Monte Giordano 27; % 06-
68307866). For handmade lace, go to Ricami Italia Garipoli (Borgo
Vittorio 91; % 06-68802196). You’ll find woodcarving at Laboratorio
Ilaria Miani (Via degli Orti di Alibert 13/A; % 06-6861366). Handmade
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
166

stringed instruments are featured at Mohesen (Vicolo del Cedro 33; 
% 06-5882484).
Jewelry
Rome has an old tradition of handmade, high-quality jewelry and gold-
smith work, which has been rediscovered in recent times. For some
excellent jewelry, check out the Bottega Mortet (Via dei Portoghesi 18;
% 06-6861629), Elisabeth Frolet (Via della Pelliccia 30; % 06-5816614),
or Carini (Piazza dell’Unitá 9; % 06-3210715), as well as the goldsmiths
Massimo Langosco di Langosco (Via della Scala 77; % 06-5896375) and
Ferrone (Via della Scala 76; % 06-5803801).
Leather clothing and accessories
Although Florence is more the place for leather clothing, you can find
some nice stores on Rome’s Via Nazionale. For leather accessories, the
two best areas are Via dei Condotti (near Piazza di Spagna) and Via
Cola di Rienzo (in the Vatican area). If money isn’t an issue, check out
the leather bags and wallets at Bottega Veneta (Piazza San Lorenzo in
Lucina 9; % 06-68210024; Bus: 81 or Minibus 116 to Piazza San Lorenzo),
famous for its beautiful woven leather designs, often in rich and startling
colors; and Prada (Via dei Condotti 88–90; % 06-6790897; Metro: Line A
to Spagna), another famous store.
Religious art and crafts
The tradition of religious objects and attire goes back to the Middle
Ages; naturally, many shops specializing in such fare are located in the
Vatican area. Although you probably don’t want to buy a cardinal’s
outfit, you may want to browse the huge selection of figurines, bronzes,
candleholders, paintings, crèches, and other religious objects, some 
of high artistic quality. Two good stores are Ghezzi (Via de Cestari 32;
% 06-6869744) and Salustri (Via de Cestai 11; % 06-6791587), near
Piazza Navona. Savelli, near the Vatican, has two locations: one special-
izing in mosaics at Via Paolo VI 27 (% 06-68307437), another right off
Piazza San Pietro with a huge variety of other objects (Piazza Pio XII; 
% 06-68806383).
Shoes
Among the top names are Dominici (Via del Corso 14; % 06-3610591),
Ferragamo (Via dei Condotti 73–74; % 06-6798402), and Ferragamo
Uomo (Via dei Condotti 75; % 06-6781130). You can get custom-made
shoes at Listo (Via della Croce 76; % 06-678-4567).
Stationery
Paper in various forms — colored, marbled, deckle-edged — is an Italian
specialty and can be found all over Rome. This is one of the most popu-
lar, portable, and affordable gifts for the folks back home. For especially
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 167

refined stationery, go to Pineider, founded in 1774, with one location at
Via Fontanella Borghese 22 (% 06-6878369; Bus: Minibus 117 or 119 to
the Corso at Via Tomacelli) and another at Via dei Due Macelli 68 (% 06-
6795884; Bus: Minibus 116, 117, or 119 to Via Due Macelli). Officina
della Carta (Via Benedetta 26; % 06-5895557) also sells paper and
leather goods in the best Italian tradition.
Living It Up After Dark
The cheapest and most popular nighttime activity in Rome is a passeg-
giata: a stroll through the historic center, enjoying the magical tableau
created by the illuminated monuments, from ancient Roman ruins to
Renaissance and baroque buildings. Don’t miss a walk through the
Roman piazze by night, perhaps sampling a tasty gelato (see the sidebar
in Chapter 11) — or you can sit on the outdoor terrace of a famous cafe
and watch the pageant as you sip an espresso or a glass of local wine.
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
168
The Estate Romana Festival
From June through September — during the off season of many venues in Rome —
Roman nights come alive with a series of musical, theatrical, and other cultural events.
Many are free, while others require advance reservations; ticket prices vary widely,
but are rarely higher than 20€ ($24). Performances often take place in some of the
most picturesque locations and monuments in Rome, lit up especially for the event,
which transforms the show into a multidimensional treat; venues range from the
Colosseum to the Theater of Caracalla Baths (Viale delle Terme di Caracalla 52; 
% 06-48160255 for information), where the Teatro dell’Opera holds some of its summer
season. One of the best theater companies is The Miracle Players (% 06-70393427;
www.miracleplayers.org), which performs in English at the Roman Forum (Via
dei Fori Imperiali; % 06-70393427). At the Toti Globe Theatre in Villa Borghese (Largo
Aqua Felix, entrance at Piazzale delle Ginestre; % 06-82077304; www.globe
theatreroma.com) — a perfect replica of the 16th-century Globe Theatre in
London — you can enjoy Shakespeare as well as other productions. Latin American
jazz is featured at Fiesta! (Ippodromo delle Capannelle, Via Appia Nuova 1245; % 06-
7182139). You can delight in both the music and the setting at the concerts of Villa
Celimontana (Via della Navicella; % 06-7182139). And Gay Village (% 340-5423008;
www.gayvillage.it) includes music and theater performances, as well as disco
and other entertainment particularly geared to gays and lesbians. Other venues during
the festival include Castel Sant’Angelo (Lungotevere Castello 50; % 06-32869 or 06-
32861) and the Roman Theater of Ostia Antica (Viale dei Romagnoli 717, Ostia Antica;
% 06-56352850). You can find details on the festival by going to www.estate

through Saturday between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.

You’ll find a very lively cultural life in Rome: Italy’s capital and a major
art city with a long cultural tradition and international visibility, it
attracts all kinds of world-famous artists and performers. For a schedule
of events in the city, pick up or download a copy of The Happening
City, an excellent monthly review published by Rome’s tourist board; it’s
available online at www.romaturismo.it.
The opera, classical concerts, and ballet always call for elegant dress, as
do the most famous theaters and even the best jazz clubs. People dress
up to go out, even just for drinks. More-casual attire is okay for other
venues and shows.
The performing arts
Rome offers splendid opportunities for lovers of the performing arts.
Concerts, theater, dance, ballet, and opera are scheduled throughout the
year. Expect to pay between 10€ and 120€ ($12–$144) depending on the
venue, the performer, and the quality of the seat. Free or very inexpen-
sive concerts are also often available. You can get a full schedule of
events from the tourist office. To make reservations and buy tickets 
in advance, try a ticket service such as the Italian TicketOne (% 02-
392261 for an English-speaking operator; www.ticketone.it) or the
British Global Edwards & Edwards (% 800-223-6108 in the U.S.), or go
directly to the Web sites of the following venues:
 Parco della Musica (Viale Coubertin 34; % 06-8082058; www.
auditorium.com; Bus: M from Piazza del Popolo), with three con-
cert halls as well as other structures, including La Cavea, a 3,000-
seat outdoor concert space reminiscent of a classical amphitheater.
In addition to classical, pop, and contemporary music, you can see
theater and dance performances here as well. Restaurants, stores,
lecture halls, and a host of other activities and services are located
on-site.
 Teatro dell’Opera (Piazza Beniamino Gigli 1, just off Via Nazionale;
% 06-48160255; www.opera.roma.it; Metro: Line A to Repubblica;
Bus: Minibus 116 to Via A. Depretis), a beautiful venue built at the
end of the 19th century, hosts opera as well as ballet and classical
concerts.
 Teatro Olimpico (Piazza Gentile da Fabriano; % 06-3265991;
www.teatroolimpico.it; Tram: 225 from Piazzale Flaminio),
another great space, hosts musical performances of all kinds.
Keep in mind that the curtain is usually right on time, and if you miss
yours, you’ll usually have to wait until intermission to get to your seat.
It’s also customary to give a small tip to your usher.
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 169

All that jazz and more
Romans love jazz, and the city is home to many first-rate jazz venues fea-
turing excellent local musicians as well as all the big names of the inter-
national scene. Most clubs are in Trastevere and in Prati. They open
their doors around 10 p.m. and close around 3 a.m. Cover charges vary
depending on the event and the club, but usually range from 7€ ($8.40)
for a regular night all the way up to 30€ ($36) for special concerts.
Reservations are recommended at all the top venues.
The most famous jazz clubs are the Alexanderplatz (Via Ostia 9, just off
the Musei Vaticani; % 06-39742171; www.alexanderplatz.it; Metro:
Line A to Ottaviano/San Pietro; Bus: 23 to Via Leone IV); Big Mama
(Vicolo San Francesco a Ripa 18 in Trastevere; % 06-5812551; www.
bigmama.it; Metro: Piramide; Tram: 8); and the Fonclea (Via Crescenzio
82/a, behind Castel Sant’Angelo; % 06-6896302; www.fonclea.it; Bus:
23 to Via Crescenzio), which also has some excellent ethnic and other
concerts.
In addition to jazz and contemporary music, you may hear traditional
Italian songs at Arciliuto (Piazza Montevecchio 5; % 06-6879419; Bus:
62 or 64 to Corso Vittorio Emanuele), located in the maze of streets
behind Piazza Navona.
The Centrale RistoTheatre (Via Celsa 6, off Piazza del Gesu; % 06-
6780501; www.centraleristotheatre.com) is an ultramodern restau-
rant–cabaret–theater hall presenting musical and theatrical perform-
ances that you can enjoy over an aperitivo or full dinner. The dinner is 
at 7:30 p.m.; the live show is at 10:30 p.m.
Historic cafes
Rome boasts some famous cafes that haven’t lost their glamour since
first opening in the 18th century. Although some are protected historic
sites, they still operate as regular Italian-style bars (see Chapter 2 for
more about bars in Italy), opening early in the morning — usually by 
8 a.m. — and closing around 9 or 10 p.m. All are in the historic center.
The Antico Caffè della Pace (Via della Pace 3–7; % 06-6861216; Bus:
Minibus 116 to Piazza Navona) is one of the most popular cafes in the
city — folks here linger at outdoor tables opening onto a romantic little
square. Another sought-after spot is the beautifully furnished Caffè
Greco (Via Condotti 84; % 06-6791700; Metro: Line A to Spagna); among
its customers were famous writers like Stendhal, Goethe, and Keats. Also
noteworthy is the Caffè Rosati (Piazza del Popolo 4–5; % 06-3225859;
Bus: Minibus 117 or 119), which retains its 1920s Art Nouveau décor.
Wine bars and pubs
Rome has many a fine enoteca (wine shop), a very popular hangout for
young and not-so-young Romans. Some of them are regular wine shops
Part III: The Eternal City: Rome 
170

that turn into a wine bar–cum–restaurant after 8 p.m. (and sometimes
also at lunch, between 1 and 3 p.m.). Others are wine bars that open
exclusively in the evening, usually from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. They’re scat-
tered everywhere in Rome, with some of the most popular located in the
centro, in particular the Pantheon/Navona, Colosseo, Trastevere, and
Campo de’ Fiori areas.
The granddaddy of Roman wine stores, Trimani (Via Goito 20; % 06-
4469661; www.trimani.com; Bus: 60 or 62; closed Sun and Aug), has
been run by the same family since 1821. Its happening wine bar is set 
in the old residential neighborhood behind the Terme di Diocleziano.
Across town, the exceedingly popular but old-fashioned wine bar called
Vineria (Campo de’ Fiori 15; % 06-68803268) still holds its own amid
the nightly crowds swarming this trendy piazza, popular with all age
groups. For something calmer, try the intimate wine bar at Gusto (see
Chapter 11).
For something less Italian, head to Drunken Ship (Campo de’ Fiori 20;
% 06-68300535), an American-style bar with a DJ, often jammed with
people; The Albert (Via del Traforo 132, off Via del Tritone, before the
tunnel; % 06-4818795), a real English pub imported from the old coun-
try; or one of the many Irish pubs around. Of the latter, we think the
nicest ones are Mad Jack (Via Arenula 20, off Largo Argentina; % 06-
68808223), with live music on Wednesday and Thursday; and Abbey
Theatre Irish Pub (Via del Governo Vecchio 51–53, near Piazza Navona;
% 06-6861341).
Dance clubs
Romans, especially the younger set, love dancing, and clubs abound.
Cover charges hover between 10€ and 20€ ($12–$24) for the hippest
venues. They usually open around 10:30 p.m. and close around 4 a.m.
Alpheus (Via del Commercio 36, near Via Ostiense; % 06-5747826; Bus:
23, but best to take a cab) has several halls offering different kinds of
music, from jazz to Latin to straight-ahead rock. Alien (Via Velletri
13–19; % 06-8412212; www.aliendisco.it; Bus: 490 to Piazza Fiume) 
is Rome’s clubbiest club — with mirrors, strobe lights, and a New York–
style atmosphere appealing to a frenetic 20-something crowd. Not to be
outdone is Gilda (Via Mario de Fiori 97; % 06-6797396; www.gilda
discoclub.it; Metro: Line A to Spagna), which caters to an older
crowd and plays classic rock as well as some newer stuff.
Gay and lesbian bars
Rome has a lively gay scene with gay clubs scattered around the city
(although the area between San Giovanni and the Colosseo has been
developing as a small gay enclave). They observe the same hours as
other clubs and discos in town. The cover usually runs about 10€ ($12).
Chapter 12: Exploring Rome 171

Trends change quickly, but at press time, Alibi (Via di Monte Testaccio
40–44; % 06-5743448; www.alibionline.it; Bus: 23; Tram: 3, though
taking a cab is best), followed by Angelo Azzurro (Via Cardinale Merry
del Val 13 in Trastevere; % 06-5800472; Tram: 8 to Viale Trastevere at
Piazza Mastai) were the hot gay clubs, while The Frequency (Viale
Odoardo Beccari 10; % 06-7851504) was the trendiest cruising bar. The
leading lesbian club was New Joli Coeur (Via Sirte 5; % 06-86215827;
Bus: 56 or 88 to Piazza Sant’Emerenziana).

Part IV
Florence and the
Best of Tuscany 
and Umbria

In this part . . . 
T
uscany is the most visited region in Italy, and its concen-
tration of attractions — sights, scenery, food, and wine —
is beyond compare. Practically every hill town offers some-
thing interesting to visit. (This is true of all of Italy, but you’ll
ﬁnd so many more hills in Tuscany!) Tuscany has proud tradi-
tions and a unique character and ﬂavor, including the
regional delicacies that each part of Italy seems to offer.
Umbria follows close behind, with a more dramatic land-
scape, a great number of art towns, and a delicious cuisine.
Perugia, a city on a hill (of course) with a rich artistic patri-
mony, is Umbria’s capital. In the following chapters, we give
you the top of the top, the not-to-be-missed things to see and
do in these regions. 
Chapter 13 is dedicated to the beautiful city of Florence.
Chapter 14 covers the northern Tuscan towns of Lucca and
Pisa and detours to the Italian Riviera for a glimpse of the
Cinque Terre, the ﬁve ﬁshing villages of Monterosso al Mare,
Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore. In Chapter
15, we take you to southern Tuscany to explore Siena, San
Gimignano, and the rest of the Chianti region, as well as to
Umbrian cities such as Assisi, Perugia, and Spoleto.

Florence

 Exploring the magnificent sights of Florence
 Getting the scoop on the best shopping areas and nightlife
F
lorence maintains its compact medieval scale and Renaissance core,
and at the same time feels like a real place; the city is also one of the
world’s most incredible repositories of art and architecture, home to such
treasures as the paintings by Botticelli and Leonardo in the Galleria degli
Uffizi, Michelangelo’s David in the Galleria dell’Accademia, Brunelleschi’s
dome crowning the Duomo (Santa Maria del Fiore), Giotto’s Campanile
(bell tower), Ghiberti’s “Gates of Paradise” on the Baptistery (Battistero di
San Giovanni), and the Ponte Vecchio over the Arno River. These treas-
ures have made Florence into one of the paramount tourist stops in Italy,
starting back in the 18th century with the Grand Tour (the cultural trip
that educated people took through Europe). Tourism has exploded in
recent years — this relatively small town is now crammed with six million
visitors annually.
Florence has much to see, but it’s small. Three days are enough to do
everything, but you can hit the highlights in less time, especially if you
have children with you — younger ones will rapidly succumb to “museum
overload.”
Getting There
By air
Florence is served by its own airport, the Aeroporto Amerigo Vespucci
(Peretola), and by Pisa’s nearby Aeroporto Galileo Galilei (see Chap-
ter 14). There are no direct flights from the United States to Florence or

Pisa, but connecting flights are available from a number of European and
Italian cities. Below are tips for getting through the airport and to your
hotel:
 Getting oriented at the airport: Both airports are small (Pisa’s is
the larger of the two) and easy to get around. ATMs, currency-
exchange booths, and tourist information desks can be found at
both airports in the arrivals concourse.
 Navigating your way through passport control and Customs: As
these are not major international airports, most of the flights origi-
nate from within the European Union. Only those flights from coun-
tries outside the Schengen European Community are subject to
passport control. In most cases, you’ll go directly to baggage claim
and then through Customs, where you’ll find two gates: one for
those who have something to declare (beyond the standard
allowance), and one for those who don’t.
 Getting from Florence’s airport to your hotel: Locally referred to
as Peretola after the name of the village nearby, the Aeroporto
Amerigo Vespucci (% 055-3061300; www.aeroporto.firenze.it)
is only 4km (21⁄2 miles) outside of Florence, a few minutes away by
public transportation. You’ll find everything just outside the arrivals
concourse on your right. A taxi will take about 15 minutes and cost
about 20€ ($24). The Volainbus shuttle bus (SITA: % 800-373760;
ATAF: % 800-424500; www.ataf.net) costs 4€ ($4.80); you can buy
tickets on board. Shuttles leave for the 25-minute trip every 20 min-
utes between 5:30 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. and hourly later on, arriving at
Florence’s SITA bus terminal, just behind the central rail station of
Santa Maria Novella. You can also get into town by taking the regu-
lar city bus no. 62, which takes about half an hour and also arrives
at Santa Maria Novella; the fare is 0.80€ (90¢).
 Getting from Pisa’s airport to your hotel: The Aeroporto Galileo
Galilei (% 050-849111; www.pisa-airport.com) is 80km (50 miles)
west of Florence. The easiest way to get into town is to board the
dedicated shuttle train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) from the
airport’s terminal; it arrives at Florence’s air terminal inside Santa
Maria Novella rail station. The shuttle makes ten runs a day, takes
about an hour, and costs about 4.95€ ($5.90).
By train
If you aren’t flying, the train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) is the
best way to get to Florence: Frequent and fast service exists from all
major Italian towns. It will take you only about two hours from Rome and
three from Venice, depending on the kind of train (intercity or the faster
Eurostar). Trains arrive at Florence’s main station, Santa Maria Novella,
often abbreviated SMN Firenze (% 055-288765); you’ll find a luggage
check at the head of Track 16. Also at the station are a last-minute hotel-
reservations desk and a tourist information desk that distributes a free
city map; this is where you can pick up your reserved tickets for the
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
176

Uffizi or the Accademia (see the tip under “Exploring Florence,” later in
this chapter). Public transportation is just outside the station: You’ll see
a taxi stand and a bus terminal with lines to basically anywhere in town.
The station is also within walking distance of a number of attractions.
By car
Florence lies on autostrada A1, in a good central position, only 277km
(172 miles) north of Rome and 298km (185 miles) south of Milan.
If you’re planning a driving tour of smaller towns in Tuscany, schedule it
before or after your stay in Florence; that way, you can either drop off
the car when you arrive or pick it up when you’re ready to leave. You’ll
spare yourself a few headaches, as Florence’s center is closed to traffic.
Parking lots are to the north of the historic district, under the SMN train
station and under Piazza Libertà, north of Fortezza da Basso.
Orienting Yourself in Florence
Florence developed beyond its medieval perimeter only toward the end
of the 19th century, and the new areas have little historic interest. The
old part of town is quite small and has a relatively simple layout, bisected
east–west by the river Arno. The heart of the historic center is on the
north — or right — bank of the river. To the north of the center lies the
Santa Maria Novella train station and Fortezza da Basso, a fortress and
armory now transformed into an exposition hall. The top attractions are
mostly clustered on this bank, around Piazza del Duomo, Piazza della
Repubblica, and Piazza della Signoria. North–south streets run toward
the river, Via dei Calzaiuoli and Via Ricasoli being the most central. Four
bridges cross the Arno within the historic center, but chances are that
you’ll use only two of them: the famous Ponte Vecchio, the most central,
and Ponte Santa Trinità, the next bridge west. The left bank of the Arno
river is Oltrarno, literally meaning “on the other side of the Arno”; its
main hubs are Piazza del Carmine and Piazza Santo Spirito.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Here we highlight the neighborhoods in Florence where you’ll spend
most of your time as a visitor: all are equally safe, but each has its own
character which will make it more or less appealing to you.
Accademia
At the northeast corner of the historic district, this neighborhood devel-
ops around Piazza San Marco, where many bus lines cross. The main
attraction here is the Accademia, with Michelangelo’s famous David.
This is a quiet and accessible neighborhood with many picturesque
streets and what we feel is Florence’s prettiest piazza (Santissima
Annunziata).

Duomo
Right in the middle of it all, this neighborhood centers around Florence’s
magnificent Duomo. It is very well connected and serviced, with all
kinds of shops, restaurants, and hotels — plus it’s within walking dis-
tance of most major attractions. The elegant commercial district along
Via dei Tornabuoni is nearby, as is the business area near Piazza della
Repubblica and Via Roma. Visitors based here will feel in touch with the
everyday business life of Florence as well as with its more touristy side.
Fiesole
Only 4.5km (3 miles) north of Florence’s Duomo, Fiesole is a pleasant
small town on a hill from which you get marvelous views of the city and
the surrounding hills. It is only 10 to 20 minutes away by bus, depending
on the traffic, and is particularly pleasant in summer, when it offers a
cool, welcoming break from the stuffiness below. Fiesole is an excellent
place to stay if you want to be away from the crowds; it also makes a
nice dinner outing.
Fortezza da Basso
On the northeast side of SMN rail station, this neighborhood has grown
up around the Fortezza da Basso. It includes many hotels and restau-
rants catering mostly to businesspeople working in the area or attending
the commercial expositions held in the Centro Congressi (Expo Centre)
inside the fortress. Within walking distance of the centro storico and very
well connected, it offers an excellent compromise: The hotel standards
are high here, but the prices aren’t marked up because this is away from
the main tourist area. The downside to staying here is that it’s outside
the pedestrian zone, so you’ll have to deal with car noise and exhaust.
It’s also a bit less picturesque, but you get more real-life surroundings.
Piazza del Carmine
The western half of Oltrarno was included within the walls of Florence
“only” in 1173. With many restaurants opening in the streets near the
river, the whole area has taken on some of the characteristics of
Trastevere in Rome — especially the old popular neighborhood of San
Frediano to the west, once a bit seedy and today bohemian.
Piazza della Signoria
This is the heart of medieval Florence. Packed with monuments and
museums, it’s where you’ll find the Uffizi, the Bargello, and Ponte
Vecchio. Completely closed to traffic — public buses and electric
navettes (shuttle buses) excluded — it is a visitor’s heaven, with many
exciting restaurants and most of the best hotels. It is also where you’ll
see all of the tourists who come to town, which may bother you. Its
narrow streets and hidden alleys, though, are delightful, and we love
having our hotel just steps from all the best art in Florence. You’ll also
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
180

see locals, who come here all the time to shop and dine in the many fine
restaurants.
Piazza Santo Spirito
Also included within the walls of Florence in 1173, the eastern part of
Oltrarno was and still is a quiet and elegant residential area. This is
where the rulers of Florence decided to build their last palace: Palazzo
Pitti. You’ll find fewer attractions here, yet the magic of the medieval
city is still present, with the great advantage of reduced crowds and a
more real neighborhood. The Ponte Vecchio is only steps away.
Santa Croce
At the southeast corner of the historic district, this neighborhood is one
of our favorites: It’s within walking distance of all the major attractions,
yet enough out of the way so it’s not overcrowded with tourists — and
still residential enough to feel like a real place. However, it is less acces-
sible than other areas and has fewer restaurants and hotels. It’s centered
around the beautiful church of Santa Croce.
Santa Maria Novella
At the northwest corner of the historic district, this neighborhood is 
situated around the church of Santa Maria Novella — one of the key
attractions here, together with the church of San Lorenzo. It is the best
connected of all — SMN train and bus stations are just around the
corner — and has all the services you might need: hotels, restaurants,
shops, and a good share of attractions.
Teatro Comunale
Stretching around the theater that houses the Maggio Fiorentino Festival
(see “Finding more cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter), this
residential area west of Santa Maria Novella is quiet and historic — and 
a very pleasant place to stay. Although it is part of medieval walled
Florence, it is not completely closed to traffic and is well connected by
public transportation. Hotels are cheaper than in the more central dis-
tricts because they are not right by the Duomo or the Uffizi, but those
attractions are only a short walk away. We definitely recommend it.
Finding information after you arrive
The tourist office maintains three information desks in town; you can get
maps and brochures at each of them, but the last two are the best:
 Santa Maria Novella (Piazza Stazione 4/a; % 055-212245) at SMN
rail station; open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
and Sunday from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
 Via Cavour 1r (% 055-290832 or 055-290833), about 3 blocks north
of the Duomo; open Monday through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to
6:30 p.m. and Sunday from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
Chapter 13: Florence 181

 Borgo Santa Croce 29r (% 055-2340444), behind Piazza Santa
Croce; open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and
Sunday from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Getting Around Florence
Florence is very safe, but the major crime — especially in the historic
districts — is pickpocketing, an activity that traditionally occurs in
crowded areas (mostly train station, buses, and outdoor markets).
The free tourist office map is completely adequate for most visitors,
especially if you combine it with the free bus map you can get from the
ATAF information booth at the SMN train station. But if you’re an ambi-
tious explorer, you can buy a cartina con stradario (map with street
directory) at any newsstand for about 6€ ($7.20).
On foot
Since the historic district is closed to all traffic except for public buses —
no cars, no taxis, and no mopeds — and attractions lie relatively close to
one another, walking is the best way to enjoy the town. The walk from the
Accademia to Palazzo Pitti — probably the two farthest attractions from
each other within the historic center — will take you about one hour at
an average pace; you’ll also pass most of the major sights in town along
the way.
By bus
Florence’s bus system is well organized and easy to use. For the most
part, you’ll probably use the electric minibuses — identified by the letters
A, B, C, and D — which are allowed within the centro storico (historic dis-
trict). These minibuses do come in handy when your feet ache after a long
day at the Uffizi or shopping on Via Tornabuoni! Regular buses are a great
way to get quickly back and forth between Oltrarno and the center of
town (nos. 36 and 37), as well as to reach some out-of-the-way attractions
such as Fiesole (no. 7) or San Miniato (nos. 12 and 13).
You can buy bus tickets at most bars, tobacconist shops (signed tabac-
chi or by a white T on a black background), and newsstands; a single
ticket (a biglietto) costs 1€ ($1.20) in advance or 1.50€ ($1.80) on
board. It’s valid for one hour on as many buses as you want. You can
save a bit if you get a Carta Agile — an electronic card worth 12 single
tickets for the price of 10 (10€/$12), or 25 tickets for the price of 20
(20€/$24), which can be used by more than one person if you’re travel-
ing together (just pass it in front of the magnetic eye of the machine on
board the bus as many times as you have passengers in your group; if
you want to know how much money you have left on the card, press the
button on the machine marked info and swipe your card). You can also
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
182

get unlimited-ride passes: a 24-hour pass costs 4.50€ ($5.40); a two-day
pass is 7.60€ ($9.10); and a three-day pass goes for 9.60€ ($12).
Another option if you’re in town for a few days is the Iris pass (23€/$28
for adults, 12€/$14 for youths under 15), valid until 1 p.m. of the fourth
day: It gives access to all public transportation — including trains —
within the province of Florence and Prato, plus a 20 percent discount on
attractions.
Bus drivers don’t make change: Always have the exact fare with 
you. Also remember that tickets need to be stamped upon boarding; 
unlimited-ride passes need to be stamped only once on your first trip.
Staying in Style
As Florence is a major tourist destination, the choice of accommoda-
tions is large and varied. Still, it may be hard to secure a nice room at a
decent price during high season (May–June and Sept–Oct); depending
on your budget, you might have to settle for a less central location, or
else make sure you reserve well in advance (see Chapter 8 for more on
hotel booking).
The Firenze4you card gives you four nights for the price of three (at
participating hotels, listed on the Web site), plus a 10 to 20 percent dis-
count at participating restaurants. You’ll get your card when you check
in at your hotel.
If you arrive in Florence without a hotel reservation, your best bet is the
room-finding service run by the tourist info desk at the Santa Maria
Novella rail station. If you’re driving, there are similar services at the
tourist info desks in the Area di Servizio AGIP Peretola (rest area) on
Highway A11 (% 055-4211800) and in the Area di Servizio Chianti Est
on Highway A1 (% 055-621349).
Chapter 13: Florence 183
Street numbering, Florence style
Florence’s tradition of independence is probably behind the town’s peculiar way of
marking street addresses: Restaurant, office, and shop doors are numbered inde-
pendently from residential and hotel doors. The first set of numbers is usually painted
in red and always marked with the letter r appended to the number (for rosso, “red”);
the second is painted in black or blue. Therefore it can easily happen that no. 1r (office
or business) and no. 1 (private residence — or hotel — this is where it gets confus-
ing) are in different buildings, and maybe a few door numbers apart.

the lovely view. Venetian plaster walls in warm tones and quality carpet-
ing give each room an individual ambience; many of the upper-floor guest
rooms have small balconies as well. The hotel is accessible for people with
disabilities and the staff is extremely helpful.

garden, where you’ll find the restaurant and breakfast buffet, affords won-
derful views. The rooms overlooking the street are a bit noisy despite the

Teatro Comunale
This is the best of the luxury hotels if you’re visiting Florence in summer:
While the beautiful 18th-century palazzo is welcoming in any season, the
large garden and swimming pool will feel absolutely heavenly in the town’s
heat — a unique plus for a centrally located hotel. The large, individually

ful bathrooms done in Carrara marble. Rooms on the higher floors have
small terraces and panoramic views of the city.

Hotel Bellettini
$$
Duomo
This reliable, moderately priced hotel is run by two sisters who are very
friendly and helpful. Housed in a 14th-century palazzo just steps from 
the Duomo, it is pleasantly old-fashioned and offers simple, clean guest
rooms — some with fantastic views — and one of the best breakfasts in
town for the price, with a buffet that includes ham and fresh fruit. You can
get cheaper rates if you choose a shared bathroom, or you can splurge on
one of the superior rooms in the new annex. The latter are more spacious
and come with Carrara marble bathrooms.

Accademia
Aptly named (pace means peace in Italian), this hotel exudes feelings of
quiet and relaxation. The good-sized guest rooms are decorated in warm
tones, with terra-cotta floors and fine fabrics; many have balconies.
Furnishings are modern but elegant. There’s complimentary pickup at the
station on request.

In-depth renovations have brought modernity to this landmark hotel —
which opened in 1896 — while respecting the original architecture. The
spacious guest rooms are luxuriously appointed and done in a refined
Italian style: clean and elegant, but also warm and welcoming. One of the
Savoy’s big draws is its special attention to children, with games, gifts, and
child-sized everything, including slippers and bathrobes in the rooms.

Accademia
This hotel occupies a 15th-century palazzo and its neighboring 17th-cen-
tury palazzo. The guest rooms in the former are pleasantly furnished and
come with beautiful bathrooms; many overlook the inner garden and

large and individually decorated with some antique furniture and modern
art. And you need not worry about noise, even in rooms overlooking the
street — the new windows are triple-paned!

places in winter and a pleasant rooftop terrace in good weather. Guest
rooms are spacious and uniquely decorated: The four-poster beds, fire-
places, antiques, and stylish modern furniture make you feel like an aris-

Loggiato dei Serviti

Accademia
Set in the beautiful piazza near the Accademia Gallery — some say the
most beautiful square in Florence — this hotel offers guest rooms done in
a rich Florentine baroque style, with beautiful wood or terra-cotta floors,
fine drapes, and canopied beds in most units. The hotel occupies a land-
mark 16th-century building designed by Antonio da Sangallo il Vecchio
(the Elder) to match the twin buildings of the Ospedale degli Innocenti
across the square. Originally a monastery, it was transformed into a hotel
early in the 20th century and has been restored to its simple Renaissance
beauty.

Santa Croce
If you stay here, you’ll feel like a guest in a private collector’s home. The
rooms of this beautiful 14th-century palazzo, once home to the Neri family,
vary in style and size. The antique furnishings, original coffered ceilings,
inner garden and patio, modern bathrooms (some with Jacuzzis), and
important artwork make this a very desirable choice. The hotel is acces-
sible for people with disabilities.

Duomo
Recently opened west of the Duomo, this hotel occupies a lovingly
restored 16th-century palazzo, the Renaissance residence of the Benci
family. The common spaces are absolutely gorgeous, with richly stuccoed
walls, and the breakfast room boasts coffered wooden ceilings. The guest
rooms are simple but tasteful; many open onto the delightful courtyard
garden, affording a little peace and quiet.

Relais Santa Croce

Santa Croce
This small luxury hotel in the heart of the historic district offers the com-
fort level of the top hotels in Florence, with a warm atmosphere and
unique style — no dusty old elegance or stuffiness here. The 18th-century
Ciofi-Jacometti palazzo combines antique furnishings and period archi-
tectural details — the original frescoes are magnificent — with contem-
porary Italian design. Precious fabrics, elegant wood panels, and marble
bathrooms — all with separate shower and tub — complete the picture.

Dining Out
The best dining in Florence is in the area between Santa Croce and
Piazza della Signoria, and also around Piazza del Carmine in Oltrarno —
the popular area of San Frediano. You’ll have to compete with locals for
a table at the most popular restaurants, especially on weekends, thus we
always recommend you make reservations — even if it’s just calling ear-
lier on the same day. Tuscans are very proud of their cuisine (see
Chapter 2), and it is difficult to find a good restaurant serving anything
but Tuscan fare. Expect lots of grilled meats and hearty soups — such as
pappa al pomodoro (tomato and bread soup) and the famous ribollita.
Belcore

Santa Maria Novella
CREATIVE SEAFOOD/VEGETARIAN
At this elegant gourmet restaurant, you’ll be pleased with the kind service,
welcoming atmosphere, and intriguing dishes on the seasonal menu
(which also has a vegetarian section). You might find such choices as arti-
choke flan with Stilton cheese sauce, Parmesan and fresh thyme risotto
with spinach and calamari sauce, and seafood fondue for two.

Buca Mario dal 1886
$$$
Santa Maria Novella
FLORENTINE
This historic restaurant serves traditional Tuscan cuisine in a friendly
atmosphere. It’s housed in a cellar (buca in Florentine), with vaulted and
whitewashed dining rooms decorated with dark-wood paneling (the décor
is original). Everything is well prepared, though it doesn’t come cheap. We
liked the classic ribollita and the osso buco, as well as the coniglio fritto
(fried rabbit), a Tuscan delicacy!

Cantinetta Antinori Tornabuoni
$$$
Santa Maria Novella
FLORENTINE/ITALIAN
Antinori is the family name of the oldest and one of the best producers of
wine in Italy. In this restaurant, typical Tuscan dishes and many special-
ties from the Antinori farms are served to accompany the wine. The can-
tinetta (small wine cellar) occupies the 15th-century palazzo of this noble
family and serves as their winery in town. You can sample the vintages at
the counter, or sit at a table and have a full meal. The pappa al pomodoro
is delicious, as is the risotto with prawns.

Chapter 13: Florence 191
Tuscan pride
Tuscans love to remind those who admire French cuisine that many typical French
dishes are actually descended from Tuscan specialties imported to France by the gour-
met queen Caterina de’ Medici in the 16th century. Not trusting northern barbarians 
to cook food to her liking, she brought her own cooks with her when she married 
Henri II of France. For example, French crêpes are derived from Florentine crespelle,
and omelette is nothing else but frittata.

Cavolo Nero
$$
Piazza del Carmine
FLORENTINE
Cavolo Nero serves great food, prepared with enthusiasm and creativity.
The name of the restaurant refers to the black cabbage (similar to kale)
that is typical of Tuscan cooking. The menu isn’t very extensive, but its
offerings are delicious. We enjoyed the homemade gnocchi with broccoli
and wild fennel, as well as the bass filet rolled in eggplant and served over
a yellow-pepper purée.

Cibreo
$$$
Santa Croce
FLORENTINE
Renowned chef-owner Fabio Picchi changes his menu daily, depending on
the market and his imagination. The backbone of the menu is historic
Tuscan, with some recipes that go back to the Renaissance — but they’re
presented here in a modern way. One hallmark of the place is that you
won’t find pasta of any kind; the other is that dinner is at 7:30 or 9 p.m., and
if you choose the first service, you’ll have to be out by 9 p.m. On the menu,
you’ll find soufflés, polenta, roasted and stuffed birds — such as the
superb pigeon stuffed with a traditional fruit preparation — and the much
imitated pomodoro in gelatina (tomato aspic). For a more informal atmos-
phere and lower prices, you can try the trattoria next door (Via de’Macci
122r) or the Caffè Cibreo across the street.

Don Chisciotte

Fortezza da Basso
FLORENTINE/SEAFOOD
This small restaurant is rightfully known for its imaginative fish dishes,
served in a friendly but classy atmosphere. Just north of the main tourist
area, it gets quite busy, especially on weekends. The dining room is on the
second floor of a typical palazzo. We liked the tagliatelle with asparagus
and prawns, along with the tuna steak with cooked greens.

Giannino in San Lorenzo
$$
Duomo
FLORENTINE
Serving roasted meats since 1920, this informal restaurant prides itself on
its fiorentina (grilled porterhouse steak of local beef). Under the vaulted
ceilings of a 17th-century shopping gallery, you can relax and have excel-
lent Tuscan food at moderate prices. You may enjoy the crostini (toasted
bread with savory toppings), ribollita, and famous salsicce toscane alla
griglia con cannellini (grilled local sausages with Tuscan white beans). And
for the wine, you can visit the wine steward in the wine cellar to help you
make your selection.

Il Cantastorie
$
Piazza della Signoria
TUSCAN
With a good singer performing every night, excellent wine, and hearty
food, Il Cantastorie is always a lively spot. Defining itself as a bit of Tuscan
countryside in the heart of Florence, this pleasant trattoria is decorated in
the Tuscan tradition of terra-cotta floors and wooden tables. You’ll find all
the typical Tuscan specialties and some of the best Chianti you’ve ever
had. Ribollita, salsiccia e bietola (pork sausages and green chard), crostoni
(larger version of crostini), and sottoli (vegetables preserved in herbs and
olive oil) are some of the choices you may find on a menu that changes
daily. The same management runs Il Cantinone (reviewed later).

Fast food, Florence style
For a cheap but delicious meal, drop by an alimentari (grocery shop) for picnic fixings.
Our favorite is Consorzio Agrario Pane and Co., Piazza San Firenze 5r, at Via Condotta
(% 055-213063; Bus: A to Condotta), where you’ll find local cheeses and cured meats,
including the excellent cinghiale (wild boar), plus mineral water, wine, and all the rest.
You can also get a nice fruit tart or some other pastries.
Or head for the colorful and noisy Mercato Centrale, near Piazza San Lorenzo
(entrance on Via dell’Ariento), where you’ll find stalls selling all kinds of edibles and
nonedibles, from fruits and vegetables to fragrant Tuscan bread. For a quick Florentine-
style bite, you can try the centuries-old fare served at Narbone (stand no. 292 on the
ground floor; Open: Mon–Sat 7 a.m.–2 p.m.), a counter with a few tables. We recom-
mend the panino col bollito (boiled beef sandwich) and, if you’re up to it, the trippa
alla Fiorentina (tripe with tomato sauce and Parmesan). At the other end of the spec-
trum, the elegant Cantinetta del Verrazzano (Via dei Tavolini 18r; % 055-268590; Open:
Mon–Sat 8 a.m.–4 p.m., in winter until 9 p.m.) sells focaccia hot from the oven and wine
by the glass, plus it has a small self-service lunch counter.

Il Cantinone

Piazza Santo Spirito
FLORENTINE
Il Cantinone combines a convivial atmosphere and good traditional
Florentine cuisine in a setting of low arched ceilings and long wooden tables.
It’s a real enoteca del Chianti Classico — a winery specializing in Chianti
Classico, the heart of the DOCG Chianti (which means it’s denomination con-
trolled and guaranteed). To accompany the wine, try the excellent soups —
ribollita, pappa al pomodoro, pasta e fagioli (pasta and beans) — or the 
salsicce (grilled pork sausages). The prix-fixe menu degustazione for two
includes a different wine with each serving.

La Carabaccia

Santa MariaNovella
FLORENTINE
The name of this restaurant refers both to a traditional working boat that
once plied the Arno and to zuppa carabaccia, a hearty onion soup favored
by the Medicis during the Renaissance. The menu features daily choices
of pasta, fresh vegetables, and fish, depending on what caught the chef’s
eye in the market that morning, plus a variety of homemade breads.

We love this elegant restaurant, where the service is always impeccable
and the cuisine superb — and the prices remain moderate. The first
courses might include an excellent zuppa di cicerchie con mazzancolle
(local legume soup with local prawns) or perhaps artichoke ravioli with
prawns, followed by a second course of delicious guinea fowl in a Chianti
sauce. Both the dessert and the wine menus are very satisfactory.

Osteria del Caffè Italiano

Santa Croce

This is our favorite place in Florence: serving genuine Tuscan food all day
long until late at night, with some of the best Tuscan wines by the glass.
And it’s no wonder: This osteria is the urban outpost of Tuscany’s ten best
vineyards, which send a selection of their finest products here regularly.
Featuring both a more formal dining room and a casual tavern, this place
allows you to choose between a complete meal or light fare; lunch is also
available in either room. Ribollita, farinata al cavolo nero (thick black cab-
bage soup), cinghiale in salmì (wild-boar stew), and a great choice of
Tuscan cold cuts will more than satisfy.

At this cozy, centrally located trattoria, you’ll find ubiquitous Florentine spe-

Looking for a gelato break?
Ice cream is certainly one of the best treats in Italy, and Florence is famous for its
gelato. Of a different school from the Venetian, the Roman, or the Sicilian gelati,
Florentine ice cream was invented — as were many other Tuscan gastronomic spe-
cialties — to gratify the palates of the Medicis. Alas, to our taste at least (one of us is
from Rome, you know), the Medici family had a very big sweet tooth, judging from the
result: Florentine ice cream is extremely sugary. You’ll find some of the best in town at
Gelateria Vivoli (Via Isola delle Stinche 7r, between the Bargello and Santa Croce; 
% 055-292334; Bus: A to Piazza Santa Croce), which is truly a marvel for its zillions of
flavors, but also at Coronas Café (Via Calzaiuoli 72r; % 055-2396139; Bus: A to
Orsanmichele) and Perchè No (Via dei Tavolini 19r, just off Via Calzaiuoli; % 055-
2398969; Bus: A to Orsanmichele), one of the oldest Florentine gelaterie. For excellent
Sicilian gelato that’s been rated among the best in Italy, stop by Gelateria Carabè (Via
Ricasoli 60r, near the Accademia; % 055-289476; Bus: C or 6, to Santissima [SS]
Annunziata), where the owner has the ingredients — lemons, almonds, pistachios —

variety of rare local cheeses served with sweet fruit preparations — to
elaborate main courses. We liked the pasta with a pork and wild-fennel
ragù, as well as the saltimbocca di rana pescatrice con ratatouille di zuc-
chine (sautéed fish and bacon bites with zucchini stew). The restaurant
also offers a tasting menu (30€/$36) and many wines by the glass.

excellent were the carpaccio di branzino, the squid-ink risotto, and the
grilled fish. The cafe next door also serves light fare in the evening.

Exploring Florence
Florence offers precious little in the way of bargains. You might consider
the Iris pass (see “Getting Around Florence,” earlier in this chapter),
which gives you a 20 percent discount on most attractions.
We highly recommend that you reserve your tickets in advance for the
Galleria degli Uffizi and the Galleria degli Accademia (% 055-294883;
Fax: 055-264406; www.firenzemusei.it; Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m.,
Sat 8:30 a.m.–12:30 p.m) in order to save literally hours of waiting in 
line. There is a reservations fee of 3€ ($3.60) per ticket. Upon arrival in
Florence, you will then pick up your tickets at the tourist office inside
the SMN train station. You can always make last-minute reservations and
buy your tickets at the information booth inside the Uffizi, but you’ll run
the risk of all time slots being sold out.

Chapter 13: Florence 199

13th-century mosaics cover the interior. The Baptistery’s north and east
doors — the life’s work of Lorenzo Ghiberti — are the key attractions here.
He began working on the beautiful bronze reliefs adorning the north doors
in 1401, when he was 20, and finished them more than two decades later.
They are now considered one of the world’s most important pieces of
Renaissance sculpture; see, for instance, how they depict Isaac’s sacrifice
with marvelous detail. The east doors, completed shortly before the
artist’s death, are even more beautiful: known as the Gates of Paradise
(when he saw them, Michelangelo supposedly said, “These doors are fit
to stand at the gates of Paradise,” and the name stuck), the ten panels
show stunning scenes from the Old Testament. The panels presently in
place are copies of the originals, which have been moved to the Museo
dell’Opera del Duomo (see later in this section) for safekeeping. The
south doors were created by Andrea Pisano in the mid–14th century and
show a more static Gothic style than Ghiberti’s revolutionary work.
See map p. 198. Piazza San Giovanni. % 055-2302885. Bus: 1, 6, 7, 10, 11, or A.
Admission: 3€ ($3.60). Open: Mon–Sat noon to 7 p.m.; Sun 8:30 a.m.–2 p.m. Last entry

Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
200
From small village to Italy’s capital
With a splendid location by the Arno river, the small town of Fiesole, on the hill over-
looking what was to become Florence, began thriving in the ninth century B.C. and
became an important Etruscan center. Florence was born in Roman times, a flourish-
ing but small village. It remained so until medieval times, when it grew to be a great
banking center, dominating the European credit market. The town’s wealth encour-
aged the development of the arts and of a lively culture: Dante was born here in 1265,
and so was the painter Cimabue (Giotto’s teacher). The Renaissance blossomed here
in the 1300s, despite difficulties that deterred it elsewhere: a flood, the black plague,
and political upheaval.
The 15th century brought the rule of Lorenzo the Magnificent, head of the powerful
Medici clan, when the town reached its apogee. By this point, Florence had become
the leading city-state in central Italy, overcoming the competition of nearby Siena and
Pisa. During this, Florence’s greatest period, the artists Leonardo, Michelangelo, and
Raphael produced amazing works. After a brief restoration of the republic, in 1537, the
Medici family returned to power in the person of Cosimo I, but it was the end of the
Renaissance: The Inquisition began in 1542, suffocating cultural life, while Italy
became the appetizing booty of the succession wars among royal families in Europe.
Florence Gran Duchy resisted as such and passed to the Lorraine house, which main-
tained its power and independence through the 17th and 18th centuries, passing then
to the Bourbon. In 1860, the population rebelled and was able to join the burgeoning
Italian kingdom. Florence was then made the capital of Italy from 1865 to 1870, when
the capital finally moved to Rome.

Bargello Museum
Signoria
If you like sculpture, we think visiting this museum instead of the Galleria
dell’Accademia (see later in this section) is a better use of your time: The
Bargello hides a treasury of Renaissance sculpture, with two Davids by
Donatello (one in marble, the other in bronze) and another David by
Michelangelo (it may also be Apollo). In addition, you’ll find several other
works by Michelangelo, including a bust of Brutus and the famous drunken
Bacchus (which he executed when he was only 22). You’ll also find the
bust of Cosimo I by Benvenuto Cellini. Compare the two bronze panels
depicting the Sacrifice of Isaac, one by Brunelleschi and one by Ghiberti,
which were submitted in the famous contest to see who’d get to do the
Baptistery doors (see earlier in this section).
The museum is housed in the Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo, which
dates back to 1255. This is the oldest seat of Florence’s government and
was the official residence of the Podestà (governor) until 1502; it then
became the seat of the Justice and Police Council. Hence the name
bargello, which meant “cop” in local parlance, and was used to refer to the
chief of police. The prisons here were used until the 19th century; it was
only in 1886 that the Bargello was transformed into the sculpture museum
of Florence.
See map p. 198. Via del Proconsolo 4, between Via Ghibellina and Via della Vigna
Vecchia. % 055-2388606. www.polomuseale.firenze.it. Bus: A. Admission:
4€ ($4.80), 7€ ($8.40) for special exhibits. Open: Daily 8:15 a.m.–6 p.m. Closed second
and fourth Mon each month and May 1; ticket booth closes 40 minutes earlier.
Duomo (Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore)
Duomo
The Duomo’s famous red-tiled dome, a masterpiece of great Renaissance
architect Filippo Brunelleschi, is the symbol of Florence (the church
facade, in contrast, is a much later addition in neo-Gothic style). The
largest in the world at the time it was built, the dome is 45m (150 ft.) wide
and 104m (300 ft.) high from the drum to the distinctive lantern at the top
of the cupola. Brunelleschi had to take over the project when the previ-
ous builders left off, unsure of how to complete the building without
having it collapse; his ingenious solution was to construct the dome in two
layers enclosing a space inside, and to have each layer become progres-
sively thinner toward the top, thus reducing the weight. If you’re up to it,
you can climb the 463 spiraling steps hidden in the space between the
layers to see this architectural marvel from the inside.
The dome was frescoed by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari, while the
rest of the interior was frescoed by Paolo Uccello in the 1430s and 1440s.
Take notice of the memorial to Sir John Hawkwood, an English mercenary
hired by the Florentines, who promised him a statue but gave him a fresco
of a statue instead. The bronze doors of the New Sacristy, by Luca della
Robbia, are the best work of art inside the Duomo.
Chapter 13: Florence 201

Under the Duomo, you can visit the remains of Santa Reparata, the former
Duomo, torn down in 1375 to build the new cathedral. Excavations, begun
in 1966, uncovered a rich trove of material dating back over centuries,
including walls of Roman houses and Roman ceramic, glass, and metal-
work, as well as paleo-Christian and medieval objects (Brunelleschi’s tomb-
stone was also discovered here). Free tours are given Monday through
Saturday, every 40 minutes from 10:30 a.m. to noon and 3 to 4:20 p.m.

Sat of month 8:30 a.m.–4 p.m. Last ascent to the cupola 40 minutes earlier.
Galleria degli Uffizi
Piazza della Signoria
Occupying a Renaissance palazzo built by Vasari to house the adminis-
trative offices (uffizi means “offices”) of the Tuscan Duchy, the gallery
houses a mind-blowing collection of work. Here you pictorially experience
the birth of the Renaissance, seeing how the changing ideas about the
nature of humanity (the new humanism) were translated into visual form.
Medieval artists weren’t bad painters — their work just reflected a holis-
tically Christian viewpoint, with no concept of “nature” as something sep-
arate from the divine — but the new humanism changed all this. You can
witness this shift if you start your visit with Cimabue’s great Crucifixion,
still inspired by the flat forms and ritualized expressions of Byzantine art.
Follow with the work of his student Giotto, where the human figure begins
to take on greater realism. The work of Sandro Botticelli — including his
Birth of Venus (the goddess emerging from the waves on a shell) and
Primavera (an ambiguous allegory of spring) — show how the revival of
classical (pagan) myth opened a new range of expression and subject.
Across from Botticelli’s Venus, don’t miss the spectacular triptych of Hugo

Lorenzo’s hiding spot
The New Sacristy in Florence’s Duomo is where Lorenzo de’ Medici hid out after he
and his brother (who was murdered) were ambushed during mass by some of their
rivals in one of Florence’s endless power struggles.
Mass at the Duomo is still full of surprises: At the end of Easter Sunday mass, a
mechanical dove flies down from the Duomo’s top (sliding along a wire) and falls on a
cart laden with flowers and led by white oxen. If all runs smoothly, the cart explodes
when the hundreds of fireworks hidden beneath the flowers are ignited by the fuse
inside the dove.

van der Goes, whose humanism emerges in the intensity of expression and
powerful realism of his poor peasants (also look for the fanciful monster
lurking in the right panel). Piero della Francesca’s diptych features full-pro-
file portraits of Federico da Montefeltro and his wife, painted in the third
quarter of the 15th century; note how he brings his subjects to life with lumi-
nosity and incredible detail, warts and all. You can then delight in the full
explosion of the Renaissance, with Masaccio’s Madonna and Child with
St. Anne, Leonardo’s Adoration of the Magi and Annunciation, several
Raphaels, Michelangelo’s Holy Family, Caravaggio’s Bacchus . . . there’s
so much at the Uffizi that you should really come twice to absorb it all.
See map p. 198. Piazzale degli Uffizi 6, off Piazza della Signoria. % 055-2388651 or
055-294883 for reservations. Bus: B. Admission: 6.50€ ($7.80); reservation additional
3€ ($3.60). Open: Tues–Sun 8:15 a.m.–6:50 p.m. Last admission 45 minutes earlier.
Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25.
Galleria dell’Accademia (Michelangelo’s David)
Accademia
The Accademia’s undisputed star is Michelangelo’s David, set on a
pedestal at the heart of the museum. Michelangelo was just 29 when he
took a 5.1m (17-ft.) column of white Carrara marble abandoned by another
sculptor and produced the masculine perfection of Il Gigante (The Giant),
as David is nicknamed. The statue stands beneath a rotunda built
expressly for it in 1873, when it was moved here from Piazza della Signoria
(a copy stands in its place on the square). In 1991, David was attacked 
by a lunatic with a hammer, so you now have to view him through a 
reinforced-glass shield (like the Pietà in Vatican City). The gallery’s other
remarkable works include Michelangelo’s St. Matthew and his interesting
series of Slaves (which are either unfinished or were poetically left partly
formed from the original hunks of stone). Among the paintings, you’ll find
Perugino’s Assumption and Descent from the Cross (the latter done in
collaboration with Filippino Lippi); The Virgin of the Sea, attributed to
Botticelli; and Pontormo’s Venus and Cupid.
See map p. 198. Via Ricasoli 60, at Via Guelfa. % 055-2388609. www.sbas.

Giotto’s Bell Tower
Duomo
Giotto was known as a painter and not an architect — but shortly before
the end of his life, he designed this beautiful, soaring 84m (276-ft.) bell
tower banded with pink, green, and white marble. Giotto had completed
only the first two levels by his death in 1337, and the replacement archi-
tect had to correct the mistakes Giotto had made — such as not making

the walls thick enough to support the structure. Some of the artwork that
originally graced the tower — by Donatello, Francesco Talenti, Luca della
Robbia, and Andrea Pisano — are now housed in the Museo dell’Opera
del Duomo (see later in this section), so copies have taken their place. If
you’re up to it, climbing the 414 steps to the top affords excellent views of
the city and especially of the Duomo next door.

6€ ($7.20). Open: Daily 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m. Last admission 20 minutes earlier.
Medici Chapels
Duomo
With a separate entrance to the back of the church of San Lorenzo, these
chapels are part of the same structure; the burial place of the Medici
family, they are more a tribute to Michelangelo than to the people who
bankrolled the Renaissance. While the octagonal Chapel of the Princes is
a gaudy baroque affair, decorated with marble and semiprecious stones
and containing monumental tombs of Medici grand dukes, the New
Sacristy, begun by Michelangelo and finished by the artist/author Vasari,
is somber and impressive. The design reflects some of the elements of the
Old Sacristy inside San Lorenzo (see later in this section), but with bold
innovations so that it became one of the founding works of the Mannerist
style. Michelangelo’s funerary sculptures are brilliant: The Monument to
Lorenzo Duca d’Urbino represents the seated duke flanked by Aurora
(Dawn) and Crepuscolo (Dusk); the Monument to Giuliano Duca di
Nemours (the son of Lorenzo the Magnificent) is shown rising, with the
figures of Giorno (Day) and Notte (Night) at his sides. In front of the sac-
risty’s altar is Michelangelo’s Madonna and Child; Lorenzo the
Magnificent is buried under this sculpture. Ironically, because
Michelangelo didn’t live to complete his plan (he died in 1564), Lorenzo
got a much less magnificent tomb than some of the lesser Medicis. To the
left of the altar is a small subterranean chamber containing some draw-
ings attributed to Michelangelo; you can see them by making an appoint-
ment when you enter.
See map p. 198. Piazza Madonna degli Aldobrandini, behind the church of San
Lorenzo. % 055-2388602. Bus: 1 or 6 to Martelli 02. Admission: 6€ ($7.20). Open: Daily

Museo dell’Opera del Duomo
Duomo
We definitely recommend visiting this museum: It’s where you’ll find all of
the original Renaissance works that decorated the Duomo, its Bell Tower,
and its Baptistery (see earlier in this section) — they were removed from
their settings to avoid damage from pollution and hammer-wielding mani-
acs. You’ll see Ghiberti’s breathtaking bronze Gates of Paradise panels
from the Baptistery; Donatello’s highly realistic sculpture of Habbakuk
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
206

and his Mary Magdalen in polychromed wood from Giotto’s Bell Tower;
one of Michelangelo’s Pietà; and Luca della Robbia’s cantoria (choir loft)
facing a similar work by Donatello, offering an example of the diversity of
Renaissance styles.

special exhibits. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–7:30 p.m. Last admission 40 minutes earlier.
Orsanmichele
Piazza della Signoria
Born as a granary and warehouse, this building was transformed into a
church in the 14th century, when it was the site of a miracle — an image of
the Madonna supposedly appeared here. The new church was decorated
by the best artists of the time, including Donatello, Ghiberti, Verrocchio,
and others. Inside, you’ll find vaulted Gothic arches, 500-year-old frescoes,
and a stone-encrusted 14th-century tabernacle by Andrea Orcagna pro-
tecting a 1348 Madonna and Child by Bernardo Daddi. The art — including
the originals from the church facade (those there now are copies) — is in
the attached museum, accessible from the Palazzo della Lana of the pow-
erful wool merchants’ guild (wool is lana in Italian), built in 1308. This was
still closed at press time, but it is scheduled to open soon.
See map p. 198. Via Arte della Lana, off Via Orsanmichele. % 055-284944. Bus: A to
Orsanmichele. Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Fri 9 a.m. to noon and 4–6 p.m.; Sat, Sun,
and holidays 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 4–6 p.m. Closed the first and last Mon of each month.
Palazzo Pitti and Giardino di Boboli
Piazza Santo Spirito
Begun in 1458 by the textile merchant/banker Luca Pitti, the palazzo was
finished by the Medici family in 1549 (they tripled its size and added the
Boboli Gardens). It houses a superb painting collection in the Galleria
Palatina: several works by Raphael, including his Madonna of the Chair
and the famous La Fornarina (modeled on the features of his Roman mis-
tress); what is perhaps the largest single collection of works by moody
psychological painter Andrea del Sarto; and several famous portraits by
Titian, Veronese, and Tintoretto. Well worth a visit are the Royal
Apartments, where three ruling families once resided (the Medici, Lorena,
and finally Savoy), now adorned with furnishings and rich decorations
from the Renaissance to Rinascimento. The beautifully frescoed and deco-
rated halls of the first floor and mezzanine house the Museo degli 
Argenti — a collection of objects in precious metals, ivory, and crystal —
where we recommend you see the splendid vases of Lorenzo de’ Medici
in semiprecious stone, as well as the cameos and carved precious stones
of the Medici collection. Also worth visiting is the Modern Art Gallery,
which holds several famous paintings of the Macchiaioli movement (the
Italian counterpart to the French Impressionists); most notable are those
by Giovanni Fattori and Telemaco Signorini. If you’re interested in
Chapter 13: Florence 207

Renaissance clothing, do not miss the historical clothing collection in the
Galleria del Costume.
But if your time is limited, after you see the Galleria Palatina and the Royal
Apartments, run behind the palazzo to visit the Boboli Gardens. This is
the world’s most grandiose example of Italianate gardens. The expanse of
45,000 sq. m (11 acres) was designed in the 16th century and expanded in
the 18th and 19th centuries. Take the Viottolone (literally “large lane”) —
lined with laurels, cypresses, and pines and punctuated by statues — to
the Piazzale dell’Isolotto, with the beautiful Fontana dell’Oceano (Ocean
Fountain). You’ll also see several pavilions, such as the 18th-century neo-
classical Palazzina della Meridiana as well as the elegant Casino del
Cavaliere — built in the 17th century as a retreat for the Granduca and
dominating the whole park from the top of the hill. It houses the Porcelain
Museum, which includes Sèvres, Chantilly, and Meissen pieces, as they
were used at the tables of the three reigning families that resided in the
palace.

Palazzo Vecchio
Piazza della Signoria
Built in 1299, this palazzo housed the Signoria — Florence’s government —
during its first period and was taken over by Cosimo de’ Medici and his
family in the 16th century, before they moved to Palazzo Pitti. They are
responsible for the grandiose redecoration. The highlight is the Hall of the
500 (Sala dei Cinquecento), where the 500-member council met when
Florence was still a republic and before the Medicis’ rule; here you’ll find
Michelangelo’s Genius of Victory statue. On the upper floor are the

The birth of opera
The story goes that in 1589, the Medici organized a wedding reception in the Giardino
di Boboli and, of course, wanted something grand. They hired the best local composers
of the time — Jacopo Peri and Ottavio Rinuccini — to provide musical entertainment.
The pair came up with the idea of setting a classical story to music and having actors
sing the whole thing, as in a modern musical. The show was a great success and the
Medici added another feather to their caps: the birth of opera.

private apartments of the Grand Duc, including the private chapel of
Eleonora di Toledo (wife of Cosimo), masterfully frescoed by Bronzino,
along with several elegant halls.

Piazza della Signoria
Piazza della Signoria
Signoria is the name of the political system that governed the city during
medieval times — the Medicis were the signori (lords) — and this was the
political heart of Florence. A beautiful example of medieval architecture,
the L-shaped square is flanked by the Palazzo Vecchio (see earlier) on the
east side and the famous Loggia della Signoria on the south. This elegant
Gothic structure is also called Loggia dei Lanzi (after the Lanzichenecchi
soldiers who camped here in the 16th century) or Loggia dell’Orcagna —
after Andrea di Cione, called Orcagna, the supposed architect (in fact, it
was built by Benci Cione and Simone Talenti). Once used for political cer-
emonies, it later became a sculpture workshop.
Several sculptures still decorate it, including the Rape of the Sabines —
an essay in three-dimensional Mannerism — and Hercules with Nessus
the Centaur, both by Giambologna. He’s also the creator of the bronze
equestrian statue of Cosimo de’ Medici in the middle of the square. Also
in the Loggia are Benvenuto Cellini’s famous Perseus, holding up the sev-
ered head of Medusa; a copy of Michelangelo’s David (the original was
moved to the Galleria dell’Accademia in the 19th century); and a Heracles
by Baccio Bandinelli. At the corner of Palazzo Vecchio is the much criti-
cized Fountain of Neptune, built by the architect Ammannati in 1575 and
disparaged by Michelangelo as well; Florentines used to mock it as Il
Biancone (“Big Whitey”).

Chapter 13: Florence 209
Savonarola was here
Another famous town resident was the passionate reformer Girolamo Savonarola. He
was the prior of the Dominican monastery of San Marco (see later in this section) and
devoted his life to the purification of the Catholic church and the Florentines. He
directed the burning of jewels, books, riches, and art pieces judged too “pagan” on
pyres erected in Piazza della Signoria. His sermons against worldly corruption gave
him increasingly more political power, but eventually brought him into conflict with
Pope Alexander VI (who had four illegitimate children, including Cesare and Lucrezia
Borgia). Excommunicated and betrayed by the Florentines who at one time supported
him, he was condemned as a heretic and burned on Piazza della Signoria in 1498. The
small disk in the ground near the Fountain of Neptune marks the spot where he was
executed.

Ponte Vecchio
Piazza della Signoria
This is the only surviving medieval bridge in Florence. Many lovely ones
spanned the Arno until the 20th century, but the Germans blew them all up
during their retreat from Italy toward the end of World War II (they’ve since
been replaced). Today, this symbol of the city of Florence offers beautiful
views and thrives with shops selling leather goods, jewelry, and other
items. If you look up, you’ll see the famous Vasari Corridor: After the com-
pletion of the Palazzo Pitti in the 16th century, Cosimo de’ Medici com-
missioned Vasari to build an aboveground “tunnel” running along the
Ponte Vecchio rooftops and linking the Palazzo degli Uffizi with the new
palazzo. Inside, the corridor is richly decorated with art (visits are sched-
uled on specific days; make reservations at the Galleria degli Uffizi).
See map p. 198. At the end of Via Por Santa Maria. Bus: B.
San Lorenzo
Duomo
San Lorenzo, founded in the fourth century, was the parish church of the
powerful Medici family, some of whom are buried in the Medici Chapels
(see earlier in this section). Behind its unfinished facade, it hides a treas-
ure-trove of artwork: The counter-facade was decorated by Michelangelo,
while the interior was designed by Brunelleschi; the monument to the left
of the Sacristy’s entrance is a masterpiece Verrocchio created for Giovanni
and Piero de’ Medici. The Old Sacristy itself is a tour de force of
Renaissance architecture, designed by Brunelleschi and then decorated
by Donatello, who executed the cherubs all around the cupola; he might
also be the author of the bronze pulpits and the terra-cotta bust of San
Lorenzo — or they could be by Desiderio da Settignano. From the pretty
cloister on the left of the basilica facade, you can reach — via an elabo-
rate stone staircase — another of Michelangelo’s works: Also designed in
1524, the Biblioteca Laurenziana houses the Medicis’ fabulous collection
of manuscripts, some of which are on display.

San Marco and Museum
Accademia
The main reason for a visit to this Dominican monastery is to see the early
Renaissance masterpieces by the incomparable Fra’ Beato Angelico —
vividly painted, exceptionally human works. The dormitory contains his
famous Annunciation, while the part of the structure that’s now a
museum contains panel paintings and altar pieces, including the
Crucifixion. Another notable work here is the Last Supper by Ghirlandaio.
The church itself is decorated with works by Fra Bartolomeo and other
artists.

Santa Croce, Cappella Pazzi, and Museo dell’Opera di Santa Croce
Santa Croce
This is the world’s largest Franciscan church, begun in 1294 by Arnolfo di
Cambio, the first architect of Florence’s Duomo, and a magnificent exam-
ple of Italian Gothic. Many notable Renaissance figures have found their
final resting place in this church: Over 270 tombstones pave the floor, and
monumental tombs line its walls. Michelangelo, Galileo, Rossini, and
Machiavelli are all buried here; Dante’s tomb is just a cenotaph (an empty
burial monument) because he died in exile in Ravenna and was buried
there. The convent compound’s key attraction are not Giotto’s frescoes in
the church — which are not very well preserved — but the 15th-century
Cappella de’ Pazzi, a wonderful example of early Renaissance architec-
ture by Brunelleschi.
Don’t miss the Museo dell’Opera di Santa Croce, which houses art taken
from the church and the cloisters, including a splendid sculpture of San
Ludovico da Tolosa by Donatello. The famous Crucifixion by Cimabue is
also on display, although restoration of the artwork was not able to undo
the great damage caused by the flood of 1966.

includes admission to the Museo dell’Opera di Santa Croce. Open: Mon–Sat 
9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Sun and holidays 1–5:30 p.m.
Santa Maria Novella and Museum
Santa Maria Novella
This splendid example of Italian Gothic was built as a Dominican church
between 1246 and 1360; it is decorated with frescoes by such great artists
as Domenico Ghirlandaio and Filippino Lippi, but the star of the show is
the Trinità by Masaccio. The other star is Giotto’s Crucifix, gracing the
main nave. Adjoining the church is the entry to the museum, which occu-
pies the cloisters of the church, including the splendid Green Cloister,
named for the beautiful coloration of its frescoes (some by Paolo Uccello).
The Cappellone degli Spagnoli (Chapel of the Spaniards) is worth a visit:
It was frescoed by Andrea di Buonaito between 1367 and 1369 with scenes
from the lives of Christ and St. Peter as well as two famous Triumphs, that
of St. Thomas and that of the Dominicans. (Cosimo de’ Medici’s wife,
Eleonora, was from Toledo, Spain, hence the name of the chapel.)

Chapter 13: Florence 211

Santo Spirito
Piazza Santo Spirito
Behind the 18th-century facade of this church, you’ll discover an archi-
tectural jewel. Built between 1444 and 1488, the interior was designed by
Brunelleschi and is divided into three naves separated by elegant arches;
the sacristy was designed by Sangallo, while the handsome bell tower on
the left of the facade was designed by Baccio d’Agnolo. Inside, you’ll find
frescoes and paintings from various artists. Do not miss the beautiful
Madonna col Bambino e santi by Filippino Lippi.
See map p. 198. Piazza Santo Spirito. % 055-210030. Admission: Free. Open:
Mon–Tues and Thurs–Fri 10 a.m. to noon and 4–5:30 p.m.; Wed 10 a.m. to noon;
Sat–Sun 4–5:30 p.m.
Finding more cool things to see and do
After you’ve exhausted all the “musts” on your list, here are a few more
worthwhile sights and activities:
 The Museo della Casa Buonarroti (Via Ghibellina 70; % 055-241-752;
Bus: A; Admission: 6.50€/$7.80; Open: Wed–Mon 9:30 a.m.–2 p.m.)
may never have had Michelangelo as a tenant, but he and his heirs
did own it. Some of the museum’s holdings are very interesting —
they include a few of the master’s earliest works, such as the
Madonna of the Steps, which he did when only in his mid-teens.
 Florence finally has an attraction specifically designed for the
young ones: The Bottega dei Ragazzi (Youth Workshop) inside the
Museo degli Innocenti (Via dei Fibbiai 2; % 055-2478386; www.
istitutodeglinnocenti.it; Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and
3–7 p.m.) has just opened its doors. This large space inside a beau-
tiful Renaissance building (another of Brunelleschi’s works beside
the famous dome in the Duomo) includes playrooms, workshops,
and an auditorium where children and teens can get their hands on
typical Renaissance techniques and crafts.
 The Palazzo Medici Riccardi (Via Cavour 3; % 055-2760340; Bus: 1,
6, 7, 10, or 11; Open: Thurs–Tues 9 a.m.–7 p.m.; Admission: 4€/$4.80)
is where Cosimo de’ Medici and his family lived before they took
over the Palazzo Vecchio. It was built by Michelozzo in 1444 and has
a lighter feel than later palazzi, such as the Pitti. Benozzo Gozzoli, 
a student of Fra Angelico’s, decorated the chapel — Cappella dei
Magi — with marvelous frescoes. The palazzo gives a good idea of
what upper-class Florentine life was like during the Renaissance.
 During the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino (see “Living It Up After
Dark,” later in this chapter), the town organizes a variety of events,
including special museum exhibits, street performances, musical
performances in bars and boutiques, and even a golf tournament! A
prize is awarded for the best shop-window decorations following
the Maggio Fiorentino theme. Ask your hotel or the tourist office
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
212

for the special program that’s published and distributed for the
occasion.
 If you have the time and disposition for another museum, the
Archaeological Museum (Via della Colonna 38; % 055-23575; Bus:
6; Admission: 4€ ($4.80); Open: Mon 2–7 p.m., Tues and Thurs 
8:30 a.m.–7 p.m., Wed and Fri–Sun 8:30 a.m.–2 p.m.) is a good
choice. Housed inside the elegant 17th-century Palazzo della
Crocetta, near the beautiful Piazza Santissima Annunziata, it con-
tains stunning Etruscan pieces and a very good collection of
Egyptian art. The core of the collection was put together by the
Medici and Lorena families who ruled Florence. Exhibited in the
Uffizi until 1888, it was then moved into its present location and 
further expanded.
 If you’re in town toward the end of June, do not miss the tourna-
ment of Renaissance soccer, the Gioco di Calcio Storico Fiorentino
(% 055-290832) in which two sets of 27 players confront each
other. This rather rough play takes place on the 16th, 24th, and
30th of June to mark the feast of St. John, Florence’s patron saint.
Each day culminates with fireworks on the river Arno.
 The little hill town of Fiesole, 4.5km (3 miles) north of Florence,
makes a wonderful excursion. It’s just an easy bus ride away (take
no. 7 from SMN train station or Piazza San Marco). Fiesole existed
well before Florence — it started as an Etruscan settlement in the
sixth century B.C. — and retains the character of a small town and
its independence as a municipality. In summer, it hosts music, 
theater, and other cultural events. Be sure to visit the Duomo
(Cattedrale di San Romolo) on the main square, Piazza Mino da
Fiesole, which was built in 1028. The archaeological area includes
Roman and Etruscan ruins: Teatro Romano and Museo Civico (Via
Partigiani 1; % 055-59477; www.fiesolemusei.it; Open: winter
Wed–Mon 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m., summer daily 9:30 a.m.–7 p.m.). The
theater, built in the first century B.C., is the site of outdoor concerts
in summer. The Museo Bandini, near the Duomo, features 13th- to
15th-century Tuscan art. A combination ticket, Biglietto Fiesole
Musei, includes round-trip bus fare from Florence and admission to
the archaeological area with the Roman theater, the archaeological
museum, the Museo Bandini, and the Cappella San Jacopo — all for
7.20€ ($8.60). The biglietto is sold at the ATAF information booth at
the SMN train station and in bars and newsstands displaying a
sticker advertising it.
Seeing Florence by guided tour
The guided walking tours arranged through the tourist office (see “Find-
ing information after you arrive,” earlier in this chapter) are extremely
well organized and a great way to explore Florence’s pedestrian-only 
historic center. If you contact the Ufficio Guide Turistiche (Viale Gramsci
9a; % 055-247-8188), you can organize a guided tour tailored to your 
specific needs.
Chapter 13: Florence 213

We like the hop-on/hop-off bus tour run by Florence City Sightseeing
(% 800-424500), which offers two itineraries; tickets are valid for 24
hours and cost 20€ ($24) for adults and 10€ ($12) for children three to
ten. Line A departs the SMN train station every 30 minutes — in winter
from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., in summer until 11 p.m. — and tours the centro
storico, making 15 stops. Line B runs every 60 minutes — in winter from
9 a.m. to 6 p.m., in summer until 10 p.m. — between Porta San Frediano
in Oltrarno all the way to Fiesole, making 23 stops.
Suggested one-, two-, and three-day itineraries
You could easily spend a week in Florence and not tire of it, especially if
you take day trips to the destinations highlighted in the next two chap-
ters. But if your time is limited, you’ll need to make choices. Here’s what
we would do:
Florence in one day
If you only have one day in Florence, you’ll have to start bright 
and early. Head to the Galleria dell’Accademia (where you’ve made
advance reservations), strolling on your way through Piazza Santissima
Annunziata — one of Florence’s nicest squares — and maybe stopping
for a gelato at Carabé (see “Looking for a gelato break?” earlier in this
chapter). For those who are not as keen on the David, we recommend
the Bargello Museum, near Piazza della Signoria, Florence’s best sculp-
ture museum. Head later for the Duomo, enjoying the sight of the cathe-
dral and of Giotto’s Bell Tower, but linger only in the Baptistery, since
you’re short on time. After your visit, lunch on a sampling of cheeses
and cured meats from the Tuscan countryside at Consorzio Agrario
Pane and Co. (see “Fast food, Florence style,” earlier in this chapter)
while you wait for your timed entry to the Galleria degli Uffizi, where
you’ve also made advance reservations. Once you are oversaturated
with Renaissance paintings, walk around Piazza della Signoria, taking in
Palazzo Vecchio; then head for Ponte Vecchio on Via Por Santa Maria,
and cross over to Oltrarno. Check out some of the shops on your way,
such as C.O.I. for gold, Cirri for embroidered linen, Madova Gloves for,
well, gloves, and Giulio Giannini & Figlio for marbleized paper (see
“Shopping the Local Stores,” later in this chapter). After a nice stroll
along the Arno, it is now time for aperitivo, and what better opportunity
to try the Florentine invention Negroni? Try it at the Negroni Florence
Bar (see “Bars, pubs, and clubs,” later in this chapter). For dinner, treat
yourself at Cibreo (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter).
Florence in two days
Two days are a lot better than one — you’ll be able to see most of the
highlights in town.
Day 1
Dedicate the morning to sculpture: the Galleria dell’Accademia, if you
absolutely want to see the David, and the Museo del Bargello, for
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
214

Florence’s best sculpture museum. Near the Accademia, stroll to Piazza
Santissima Annunziata for a peek at one of Florence’s nicest squares and
a stop for gelato at Carabé (see “Looking for a gelato break?” earlier in
this chapter). Later on, pick up the makings of a tasty picnic at Consorzio
Agrario Pane and Co., or have a full lunch at Osteria Ganino or Pane e
Vino (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter). Continue your day with
the Galleria degli Uffizi, where you have made advance reservations.
After your visit, spend the rest of your afternoon and evening exploring
Ponte Vecchio, Palazzo Vecchio, and Piazza della Signoria.
Day 2
Start your day with an exploration of the Duomo, with Giotto’s Bell
Tower and the Baptistery. Continue with the Museo dell’Opera del
Duomo. Have lunch at Le Mossacce (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this chap-
ter). In the afternoon, head for the church of San Lorenzo, and visit the
Medici Chapels behind it as well. You can also stroll through the Mercato
San Lorenzo for some shopping (see later in this chapter) before heading
for the church of Santa Maria Novella and its splendid cloisters. Have
your Negroni aperitivo at the cafe that invented it, Giacosa (see “Bars,
pubs, and clubs,” later in this chapter). For dinner, treat yourself at
Cibreo (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter).
Florence in three days
Three days is a good amount: You’ll be able to see all the best the town
has to offer, without feeling pressed for time.
Day 1 and 2
Follow Day 1 and 2 in “Florence in two days,” earlier in this chapter.
Day 3
Head for the Basilica Santa Croce, and visit the Cappella Pazzi and the
Museo dell’Opera di Santa Croce. Outside the convent compound,
don’t forget to take a look at the leather goods of the Scuola del Cuoio
di Santa Croce (see “Shopping the Local Stores,” later in this chapter).
Have lunch at the Osteria del Caffè Italiano (see “Dining Out,” earlier in
this chapter). In the afternoon, head for Palazzo Pitti and the Giardino
di Boboli. End your day with a stroll and dinner in Oltrarno, perhaps at
Cavolo Nero (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter).
Shopping the Local Stores
With a long tradition of crafts, Florence offers some very nice specialty
products, such as leather, fine woven straw, jewelry, embroidered linens
and lace, and quality paper products. It’s also a center for casual fash-
ion. Many of these goodies are still available at the historic outdoor mar-
kets, which are fun even if you don’t intend to buy anything.
Chapter 13: Florence 215

Remember that all crowded areas, including the outdoor markets, are
the preferred hunting ground for pickpockets and purse-snatchers. Don’t
display your cash too liberally, and keep an eye on your pockets and
purse.
Best shopping areas
For elegant shopping, the place to go is Via de’ Tornabuoni, in the
centro storico near Santa Maria Novella (between Piazzetta degli Antinori
and Piazza di Santa Trinità). This street is at the heart of the ritzy shop-
ping district that includes Via Strozzi and Via della Vigna Nuova (both
off Via de’ Tornabuoni); you’ll find all the big names of Italian fashion
here, such as Ferragamo (Via Tornabuoni 16), Loro Piano (Via della
Vigna Nuova 37r), and Giorgio Armani (Via della Vigna Nuova 51r), plus
a selection of reliable but expensive boutiques. Other stylish boutiques
line the Lungarno Corsini (take a left from Via della Vigna Nuova and
continue along the river); here you’ll find the luxury linen purveyor
Pratesi (see later in this section), among other nice smaller shops. This
shopping district extends east, all the way to Via Roma, Piazza della
Repubblica, Via del Corso, Via dei Calzaiuoli, and Via Calimala off the
Ponte Vecchio. You’ll see lots of real-life stores here, including the
Italian-style department stores La Rinascente (Piazza della Repubblica 1;
% 055-219113), which sells mostly clothes and housewares, and COIN
(Via dei Calzaiuoli 56r; % 055-280531).
What to look for and where to find it
Retail shops are generally open Monday from 4 to 7:30 p.m., Tuesday
through Saturday from 9 or 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4 to 7:30 p.m. As in 
all Italian cities, many shops shut down for the month of August, but
department stores don’t — and are sometimes open during the lunch
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
216
The outdoor markets of Florence
There are two famous markets in Florence: the leather market San Lorenzo (Piazza
del Mercato Centrale, 1 block north of the Basilica of San Lorenzo) and the straw
market Mercato della Paglia (Via Por Santa Maria, off Ponte Vecchio), which sells
traditional straw goods (hats, chairs, bags) of unique quality — plus a lot of cheap
things mixed in. Both markets are open from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily in summer,
Tuesday through Saturday in winter. They’re good places to shop for T-shirts and small
gifts. Good buys can be had, but don’t expect to pay peanuts: Try to have a fair idea in
your mind of what things are worth and be suspicious of prices that seem too low (the
quality might not be what you think). The leather market of San Lorenzo is held around
the building of the Mercato Centrale, which houses a great food market (see “Fast
food, Florence style,” earlier in this chapter).

break as well. During high season, a few stores might be open on
Monday mornings and Sundays.
Embroidery and linens
Cirri (Via Por Santa Maria; % 055-2396593; Bus: B to Ponte Vecchio) is
a good place for Florentine embroideries, but they don’t come cheap.
Pratesi (Lungarno Corsini 32–34r; % 055-211327; www.pratesi.com;
Bus: D) is the place to go for beautifully crafted luxury linens of all kinds.
Housewares and accessories
Controluce (Via della Vigna Nuova 89r; % 055-2398871; Bus: 6, 11, 36,
or 37 to Tornabuoni) has a beautiful assortment of designer lamps and
accessories. Emporium (Via Guicciardini 122r; % 055-212646; Bus: D to
Pitti) is good for a variety of stylish accessories. Viceversa (Via Ricasoli
53r; % 055-2398281; Bus: C or 6 to Santissima Annunziata) is a great
place for browsing and discovering neat gift ideas.
Jewelry
Befani e Tai (Via delle Terme 9; % 055-287825; Bus: B) is a reputable
goldsmith shop that sells both antiques and special-order jewelry.
Leather products
Beltrami (Via de’ Tornabuoni 48r; % 055-287779; Bus 6, 11, 36, or 37 to
Tornabuoni) is the place to go for beautiful leather accessories, includ-
ing shoes, bags, and luggage. The Beltrami Outlet (Via de’ Panzani 1,
near the church of Santa Maria Novella; % 055-212661; Bus: A, 1, 6, 11,
36, or 37 to SMN) offers last season’s inventory at a discount. For gloves,
head straight to Madova Gloves (Via Guicciardini 1r; % 055-2396526;
www.madova.com; Bus: D to Pitti), which is actually a traditional glove-
maker’s workshop. Scuola del Cuoio di Santa Croce (Santa Croce’s
Leather School) (Piazza Santa Croce, enter from the church’s right
transept; % 055-244533; www.leatherschool.it; Bus: A to Piazza
Santa Croce) is your best bet if you want to know about the ancient art
of leather embossing. The beautifully crafted goods don’t come cheap,
though.
Chapter 13: Florence 217
Ponte Vecchio’s gold
It is commonly assumed that Ponte Vecchio is the place to go for gold jewelry: Indeed,
in this area, you will find one jewelry shop after the next, but all with pretty much the
same merchandise. The prices are no longer great and it’s difficult to find something
original — perhaps after 500 years and a trillion tourists, the street has gotten a tad
stale.

Mosaic “stone painting”
Le Pietre nell’Arte (Piazza Duomo 36r; % 055-212587; Bus: A) is the
showroom of a talented father-and-son duo turning out collector-quality
items. Pitti Mosaici (Piazza Pitti 23r; % 055-282127; Bus: D to Pitti) is
one of the few traditional craftsmen left in Florence who specialize in
this art form.
Stationery and paper goods
Giulio Giannini & Figlio (Piazza Pitti 37r; % 055-212621; Bus: D to Pitti)
is a historic paper provider that has specialized in marbleized goods
since the 19th century. You’ll find an excellent choice of stationery here.
J. Pineider (Piazza della Signoria 13r; % 055-284655; Bus: B; also at Via
de’ Tornabuoni 76; % 055-211605; Bus: 6, 11, 36, or 37), opened in 1774,
has supplied paper to many royal figures.
Living It Up After Dark
Nightlife in Florence usually means hanging out in a pub with friends,
going for a drink at a trendy bar, or taking a stroll and enjoying some
gelato in the historic center. Younger crowds like to go dancing at one of
the popular discos out of town.
The free monthly Informacittà pamphlet, distributed free at tourist
offices, gives information on events, exhibits, and concerts.
The performing arts
Several churches in town present evening concerts, mainly in the fall. 
For listings, pick up a free copy of Welcome to Florence from the tourist
office. The most popular are the concerts of the Florentine Chamber
Orchestra (% 055-783374; www.orcafi.it) in the Orsanmichele church.
The season runs March through October; tickets are available at the box
office (Via Luigi Alamanni 39, by Fortezza de Basso; % 055-210804) or
online at www.boxol.it.
In May, Florence blossoms with music — it’s the month of Italy’s oldest
music festival, Maggio Musicale Fiorentino (% 800-112211 or 055-
213535; Fax: 055-2779410; reservations accepted starting in Sept). Tickets
are also sold online at www.maggiofiorentino.com; they range from
20€ to 155€ ($24–$186). Continuing until the end of June, this concert
and dance series includes famous performers and world premieres. The
final concert, held in the Giardino di Boboli, is a magical experience. At
the center of the festival is the Teatro Comunale (Corso Italia 16; % 055-
213535; Tues–Fri 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m., Sat 10 a.m.–1 p.m.), which also has a
regular program of ballet and opera at other times of the year.
Teatro Verdi (Via Ghibellina 99; % 055-212320), a small theater, also
offers prestigious dance and classical music performances.

Bars, pubs, and clubs
The oldest caffè in town is Gilli (Piazza della Repubblica 39r/Via Roma
1r; % 055-213896; Bus: A to Orsanmichele), which dates back to the
18th century and boasts both a great location and elegant décor.
Giacosa (Via de’ Tornabuoni 83r; % 055-2396226; Bus: 6, 11, 36, or 37 to
Tornabuoni; closed Sun) is known for its drinks, particularly the Negroni
(the ancestor of the Italian pre-dinner aperitivo), which apparently was
invented here by Mr. Negroni and his barman. Named in honor of that
drink, the Negroni Florence Bar (Via de’Renai 17r, off Ponte delle Grazie
in Oltrarno; % 055-243647) becomes a lively spot in the evening, with
music almost every night; it stays open until 2 a.m.
The chef-owner of the popular restaurant Cibreo has opened Teatro del
Sale (Via de’ Macci 111r; % 055-2001492; Open: Tues–Sat 9 p.m. to mid-
night), a pleasant club offering a tasty buffet-dinner-and-show combina-
tion; performances range from jazz to poetry readings. The historic Jazz
Club (Via Nuova de’ Caccini 3; % 055-2479700; Open: Mon–Sat 9 p.m.–
2 a.m.) features live music every night.
Florence has been swept up in a passion for Irish pubs. The beer is origi-
nal, but the atmosphere a little less so. Try the Fiddler’s Elbow (Piazza
Santa Maria Novella 7r; % 055-215056; Bus: A, 1, 6, 11, 36, or 37), a suc-
cessful branch of the Italian chain, or the Dublin Pub (Via Faenza 27r;

Hot with the elegant crowds are the restaurants and bars of many hotels
in the city, such as the Savoy (Piazza della Repubblica 7; % 055-27351),
the Donatello Bar at the Westin-Excelsior (Piazza Ognissanti 3; % 055-
264201), the Lungarno (Borgo San Jacopo 14r; % 055-27261), and the
Fusion Bar (Gallery Hotel, Vicolo dell’Oro 5; % 055-27263).
Discos
Yab (Via Sassetti 5r; % 055-215160) is open October through May,
Monday and Thursday through Saturday from 7:30 p.m. to 4 a.m.; it also
serves dinner. Universale (Via Pisana 77r, Oltrarno, between Via di
Monte Oliveto and Viale B. Gozzoli; % 055-221122; www.universale
firenze.it; Bus: 6) is open September through May only, Thursday
through Sunday nights. The cover ranges from 11€ to 18€ ($13–$22).
Another hot spot is Jaragua (Via Erta Canina 12r, Oltrarno, off Viale
Michelangiolo; % 055-2343600), a disco and tropical bar with plenty of
Caribbean and Latin music, free dance classes, and more. It’s open daily
from 9:30 p.m. to 3 a.m.; no cover.
Gay and lesbian bars
Tabasco (Piazza Santa Cecilia 3r, by Piazza della Signoria; % 055-213000;

Fast Facts: Florence

maintains three info desks in town: at Via
Cavour 1r (% 055-290832; Open: Mon–Sat
8:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m., Sun 8:30 a.m.–1:30 p.m.);
at SMN rail station (Piazza Stazione 4/a; 
% 055-212245; Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m.,
Sun 8:30 a.m.–2 p.m.); and at Borgo Santa
Croce 29r (% 055-2340444; Open: Mon–Sat 
9 a.m.–7 p.m., Sun 8:30 a.m.–2 p.m.)
Internet Access
The Caironet chain has several locations,
the most convenient being Via de’ Ginori
59r, off Via Guelfa (% 055-2399376), and Via
Faenza 49r, near SMN train station (% 055-
2645560). The easyInternetcafé chain has 
a branch near the Duomo inside Libreria
Martelli (Via Martelli 22; % 055-2657603;
Open: Daily 9 a.m.–8 p.m.).
Maps
Any newsstand, especially those near the
train station, will have a good selection of
local maps.
Pharmacies
There are many pharmacies in Florence,
but the Farmacia Molteni, Via Calzaiuoli 7r
(% 055-289490; Bus: A to Orsanmichele), 
is open 24 hours, as are the Farmacia
Comunale, inside the Santa Maria Novella
train station (% 055-289435), and All’insegna
del Moro, Piazza San Giovanni 20r (% 055-
211343).
Police
There are two police forces in Italy; call
either one. For the Polizia, dial % 113; for
the Carabinieri, dial % 112.
Post Office
The main post office is the ufficio postale at
Via Pellicceria 3, off Piazza della Repubblica
(% 055-2736481; Open: Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–
6 p.m., Sat 9 a.m.–2 p.m.).
Restrooms
You’ll find a few public restrooms at strate-
gic points — the SMN train station,
Mercato Centrale (market) — as well as
others that are open only in high season.
Your best bet is to go to a cafe displaying
the “Courtesy Point” logo; these have an
agreement with the city to offer such serv-
ice. Better yet, because Florence is full of
museums, use one while you’re inside. Also
a good bet are department stores, such as
the Rinascente in Piazza della Repubblica.
Safety
Florence is quite safe; your only major wor-
ries are pickpockets and purse-snatchers
due to the huge concentration of tourists.
Avoid deserted areas after dark (such as
behind the train station and the Cascine
Park) and exercise normal urban caution.
Smoking
In 2005, Italy passed a law outlawing smok-
ing in most public places. Smoking is
allowed only where there is a separate,
ventilated area for nonsmokers. If you want
to smoke at your table, call beforehand to
make sure the restaurant or cafe you’ll be
visiting offers a smoking area.
Taxes
See Chapter 5 for information on IVA (Value
Added Tax).
Taxi
For a radio taxi, call % 055-4390, 055-4798,
055-4242, or 055-4499.

buses, call SITA (% 800-373760). For trains,
contact Trenitalia (% 892021; www.

phone number for weather forecasts in
Italy, as there is in the U.S.)

Chapter 14
Northern Tuscany and 
the Cinque Terre
In This Chapter
 Exploring city ramparts in Lucca
 Gaping at the Leaning Tower in Pisa
 Discovering fishing villages in the Cinque Terre
N
orthern Tuscany is an area rich in history and natural beauty. Near
the Tyrrhenian Sea, you’ll find Pisa, with its justly famous Leaning
Tower; a little farther inland is Lucca, one of Italy’s most delightful
medieval walled cities. No trip to the area could be complete without 
a glimpse of the Italian Riviera, especially as it is experienced in the
national park of the Cinque Terre, a group of five picturesque villages
clinging to abrupt cliffs and surrounded by a protected marine area.
You’ll need a minimum of a day each for these destinations, but if you
have the time and the disposition, this region could naturally justify a
longer stay. Pisa makes an excellent base for exploring this area; it’s not
only central but also a pleasant city to visit, with a selection of moder-
ately priced hotels. Alternatively, you can easily visit any of the destina-
tions in this area as a day trip from Florence.
Lucca
The English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley passed through here and wrote
“The Baths of Lucca,” celebrating the unspoiled medieval town sur-
rounded by powerful red ramparts. Lucca may have expanded a bit
beyond its ramparts, but the effect is still unchanged.
Lucca is an easy side trip from Florence, and a day will be enough for a
full visit. If you have time, it’s also a wonderful place to spend a couple
of days leisurely strolling the walls and enjoying an opera or a concert,
especially during the September festival (see “More cool things to see
and do,” later in this section).

Chapter 14: Northern Tuscany and the Cinque Terre 225

Getting there
Lucca is 64km (40 miles) west of Florence and just 22km (14 miles) north
of Pisa. If you are arriving by plane at Pisa’s airport (see later in this
chapter), you can get the direct shuttle to Lucca that leaves every hour
between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m.
The area is well served by train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it).
Trains for Lucca leave Florence every hour; the one-hour trip costs
about 4.55€ ($5.50). Trains from Pisa travel as frequently, but the trip 
is only 20 to 30 minutes and costs 2.05€ ($2.50). Lucca’s train station
(% 0583-467013) is on Piazzale Ricasoli, off Porta San Pietro (St. Peter’s
Gate) on the south side of the walls, within walking distance from the
center of town.
You can also get a bus to Lucca. Lazzi (% 055-363041; www.lazzi.it)
runs regular service from both Pisa and Florence. The trip takes about
an hour from Florence (for 4.70€/$5.60), about 30 minutes from Pisa (for
2.20€/$2.60). The bus terminal is in Piazzale Verdi, within Lucca’s walls,
on the west side.
If you’re coming by car, get on autostrada A11 from Florence and exit 
at Lucca. From Pisa, take the local road SS12 to Lucca. Parking lots are
located near most of the six city gates — only locals are allowed to drive
inside — and town buses connect each of them as well as the rail station
to the center of town. Bus tickets are for sale at most tobacconists and
newstands for 0.60€ (72¢) for a single ride, 6€ ($7.20) for 12.
Spending the night
Besides the suggestions below, you may want to consider staying at one
of Tuscany’s most elegant hotels, Locanda L’Elisa (Via Nuova per Pisa
1952, off SS12; % 0583-379737; www.locandalelisa.it), a Relais &
Châteaux member located only 3km (2 miles) south of the town walls,
with splendid accommodations and unique grounds. Another option is
its neighbor across the street, Villa La Principessa (Via Nuova per Pisa
1616, off SS12; % 0583-370037; www.hotelprincipessa.com).
Hotel Ilaria
$$
Via Santa Croce
Tasteful guest rooms, breakfast on a quiet terrace overlooking a beautiful
park, free use of bicycles, a parking garage on the premises — all right in
the center of Lucca. What else do you want, discounted prices at the best
restaurants in town? You got it: The management of Hotel Ilaria has an
agreement with three establishments, including the well-recommended
Giglio and Buca di Sant’Antonio (see “Dining locally,” later in this chapter).
Beautifully renovated, this elegant hotel is housed in the former stables of
the Villa Bottini and overlooks the villa’s park — a quiet setting near the
canal that crosses the city toward the east. Accommodations are spacious,
with modern furniture and good-sized bathrooms. Some rooms are acces-
sible to people with disabilities.

Palazzo Alexander
$$
Piazza San Michele
This hotel, which opened in 2000, offers luxurious accommodations right
in the center of town. The 12th-century palace was restored according to
the style of the original furnishings and decorations. Guest rooms are quite

magnificent, done in what the management refers to as stile nobile
Lucchese (Luccan aristocratic style) — featuring much gilded furniture,

Piccolo Hotel Puccini

Piazza San Michele
In the heart of the historic center is this romantic hotel, offering moderate-
sized, cozily furnished rooms at low rates. Situated just across from the
house where Puccini was born, it is based in a small 15th-century palazzo.
All of the bathrooms were being completely renovated at press time. This
popular spot is always full, so book well in advance. Note that this hotel
lacks an elevator and air-conditioning.

Dining locally
There are fewer good restaurants in Lucca than you would expect, but
most provide a decent meal — you are in Tuscany, after all — although
sometimes it’s overpriced. Those listed below are the best spots in
town. See Chapter 2 for more on Tuscan cuisine.
Antico Caffè delle Mura
$$
City Ramparts
LUCCAN/TUSCAN
With its fantastic location atop the city walls, this elegant restaurant tries
to revive 19th-century atmosphere. After being seated in a paneled formal
dining room or, in good weather, the garden out back, you will be able to
choose from traditional Luccan dishes and other Tuscan favorites, such
as homemade fresh pasta and delectable rabbit, duck, and lamb.
See map p. 227. Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, at Baluardo Santa Maria. % 0583-47962.
Reservations necessary. Secondi: 14€–18€ ($17–$22). AE, DC, MC, V. Open:

Buca di Sant’Antonio

Piazza San Michele
LUCCAN
Lucca’s best restaurant boasts excellent food at very reasonable prices.
The cuisine is strictly traditional — you wouldn’t expect any less from a
place that’s been around since 1782. The capretto garfagnino allo spiedo
(spit-roasted baby goat from the Garfagnana area) is a classic, as are the

tortelli lucchesi al sugo (ravioli with a meat sauce). The remarkable atmos-
phere is characterized by a labyrinthine succession of small rooms deco-
rated with musical instruments and copper pots.

Il Giglio

Piazza Napoleone
LUCCAN
Less formal than Antico Caffè delle Mura (reviewed above), Il Giglio offers
excellent Luccan specialties and a friendly atmosphere. Dine indoors or, in
pleasant weather, alfresco. Try the famed zuppa di farro (thick spelt soup)
or the homemade tortelli al ragù. The secondi are also very tasty; you can
never go wrong with the rabbit or the roasted lamb.

Piazza San Michele
FISH/LUCCAN
You’ll always get a fine seafood meal here — but you may not receive the
service to match. The cuisine mixes tradition with innovation, and the
offerings vary with the daily catch. More creative dishes such as tortelloni
neri di crostacei con asparagi e pomodorini (black round seafood ravioli
with asparagus and cherry tomatoes) and marinated salmon in a pink-
pepper sauce are offered side by side with the classics, like the excellent
frittura di paranza (fried small fish) — one of our favorites. A special chil-
dren’s menu offers simpler dishes with fewer spices.

noon to 2:30 p.m.; Wed–Mon 7:30–10:30 p.m. Closed Jan–Feb.
Exploring Lucca
To fully enjoy the medieval flavor of the town, the best way to explore 
is on foot. Cityphone Guided Tour is a recorded tour — available in
Italian, English, French, Spanish, and German — that offers explanations
of all of Lucca’s sights. Rent one Cityphone for 9€ ($11), two for 14€
($17), and each additional one for 7€ ($8.40). Together with the free city
map, it’s all you need to explore Lucca. Both are available at the tourist
office in Piazzale Verdi (see “Fast Facts: Lucca,” later in this chapter).
You can buy a combination ticket that includes the Duomo, with its sac-
risty and museum, and the church and baptistery of Santi Giovanni e
Reparata, for 5€ ($6). Another combination ticket includes the Museo
Nazionale Palazzo Mansi and the Villa Guinigi for 6.50€ ($7.80).

The top attractions
Duomo (Cattedrale di San Martino)
Piazza San Martino
Gracing a pretty medieval square, this cathedral is a perfect example of
Luccan-Pisan Romanesque architecture. Striped with green and white
marble, the facade is decorated with three tiers of polychromed columns.
Walk behind the church to admire the imposing apse, surrounded by a
small park. The interior is Gothic, divided into three naves, and contains
several fine pieces, such as Tintoretto’s Last Supper over the altar in the
third chapel to the right, and a famous relic: the Volto Santo, a wooden cru-
cifix showing the real face of Christ, said to have been miraculously carved
(the marble housing is by Matteo Civitali, the best 15th-century Luccan
artist). The most important art is in the sacristy: Ghirlandaio’s Madonna
with Saints and Jacopo della Quercia’s funeral monument to Ilaria del
Carretto Guinigi, one of the finest examples of 15th-century Italian sculp-
ture. Ilaria was the first wife of Paolo Guinigi, ruler of Lucca, and he had the
monument built to commemorate her death (she died at 26 after only two
years of marriage). The adjacent museum contains art once housed in the
cathedral, such as Matteo Civitali’s masterly carved choir. Count on about
an hour for your visit, including sacristy and museum.
See map p. 227. Piazza San Martino. % 0583-957068. Admission: Duomo free; sac-
risty 2€ ($2.40); museum 4€ ($4.80). Open: Duomo and sacristy Mon–Fri 9:30 a.m.–
4:45 p.m., Sat 9:30 a.m.–6:45 p.m., Sun 11:20–11:50 a.m. and 1–4:30 p.m., summer also
5–6 p.m.; museum Nov–Mar Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–2 p.m., Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Apr–Oct
daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
Palazzo Mansi and Pinacoteca Nazionale
Porta San Donato
This lavish 17th-century palace built for the Mansi, a powerful Luccan
family, is decorated with some of its original furnishings and frescoes. Of
special note are the Music Room (Salone della Musica) and Nuptial Room
(Camera degli Sposi). The collection in the pinacoteca (picture gallery)
includes Italian and foreign artists from the Renaissance to the 18th cen-
tury, such as Pontormo, Andrea del Sarto, Veronese, and Domenichino.
Allow about an hour here.

The red ramparts of Lucca
Lucca’s architecture speaks of its past glory: An important city under the Romans, it
later became a republic, fighting for its independence against Pisa (see Chapter 2). It
was — and still is — famous for the works produced in its music school, founded in
A.D. 787. A famous student of the school was Giacomo Puccini, who gave the world
some of its greatest operas, such as Madame Butterfly and Tosca.

See map p. 227. Via Galli Tassi 43. % 0583-55570. Admission: 4€ ($4.80). Open:
Tues–Sat 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.; Sun 8:30 a.m.–1:30 p.m. Ticket booth closes 30 minutes
earlier.
San Frediano
Piazza Anfiteatro
Built in the early 12th century, this church has a simple facade decorated
with a beautiful Byzantine-style mosaic depicting the ascension of Christ,
as well as a soaring bell tower. Inside are noteworthy Jacopo della Quercia
carvings in the left nave’s last chapel, a 12th- and 13th-century mosaic
floor around the main altar, and a beautifully carved Romanesque font at
the right nave’s entrance. Allow about 30 minutes here.
See map p. 227. Piazza San Frediano. % 0583-493627. Admission: Free. Open:
Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m. to noon and 3–5 p.m.; Sun 9–11:30 a.m. and 3–6 p.m.
San Giovanni church and archaeological excavations
Piazza San Martino
The 12th-century church of Santi Giovanni e Reparata was partly rebuilt in
the 17th century. Together with the adjacent baptistery, adorned with a
Gothic dome, they are a lovely sight. However, the real attraction here is
the excavations under the church that take you back in time. Underneath
the later constructions, you can see the remains of a previous basilica,
beneath which are the remains of a paleo-Christian church, itself built over
a Roman temple, which was built atop a more ancient Roman house. The
excavations are accessible to the public via guided tour; it’s best to make
a reservation in advance. Expect to spend about 40 minutes here.
See map p. 227. Piazza San Giovanni. % 0583-490-530 for reservations. Admission:
2.50€ ($3). Open: Nov–Mar Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Mar–Oct daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
San Michele in Foro
Piazza San Michele
Probably one of the greatest examples of Luccan-Pisan Romanesque archi-
tecture, the church of San Michele was built between the 12th and 14th
centuries. It derives its name from the fact that it was built over the ancient
Roman city’s Forum. The facade is graced by four tiers of small columns
and is decorated with different colors of marble, while the apse powerfully
illustrates the Pisan influence. Inside is a beautiful Filippino Lippi paint-
ing, representing the saints Sebastian, Jerome, Helen, and Roch. Piazza San
Michele, which surrounds this wonderful church, is itself lovely. Allow
about 30 minutes for your visit.
See map p. 227. Piazza San Michele. % 0583-48459. Admission: Free. Open: Daily
winter 9 a.m. to noon and 3–6 p.m.; summer 7:40 a.m. to noon and 3–6 p.m.

Villa Guinigi
Porta Elisa
Formerly the residence of the Guinigi family — Lucca’s rulers during the
Renaissance — this elegant villa has been transformed into a museum. You
can see some of the original furnishings dating back to the Renaissance as
well as an interesting collection of Lucchese artwork, including paintings
and sculptures from the 13th to the 18th centuries, along with some
ancient Roman and Etruscan artifacts. Allow 40 minutes here.

More cool things to see and do
Lucca is more than just churches and palaces. Herewith, more to explore:
 Lucca is a city of music, and you’ll find that one musical festival or
another is going on almost throughout the year. October through
February is the opera season at the historic Teatro del Giglio
(% 0583-46531 or 0583-467521 for tickets; www.teatrodelgiglio.
it), where Puccini performed his works. If you’re in town between
April and December, you can enjoy the concerts of the Lucca in
Musica festival, held in the Basilica of San Frediano and in the
Auditorium di San Romano. A good time to visit is during the
Settembre Lucchese, when a variety of events liven the city, includ-
ing many concerts. Another great musical event is the Sagra
Musicale Lucchese (organized by Cappella Musicale Santa Cecilia;
% 0583-48421), which takes place between April and June, when
concerts of religious and classical music are performed in several
of the city’s churches. For a schedule of concerts, check with the
tourist office (see “Fast Facts: Lucca,” later in this chapter).
 Overlooking the whole city, the Passeggiata delle Mura — the
promenade built on top of the city walls — is one attraction enjoyed
by visitors and Luccans alike. Erected between 1544 and 1650, this is
the third and final set of city walls built by the independent Republic
of Lucca (the first set was built in Roman times in the second or
third century A.D., the second between the 11th and 13th century). 
In fact, they’re Europe’s only practically undamaged set of defense
ramparts from the Renaissance — perhaps thanks to their monu-
mental scale, measuring 35m (115 ft.) thick at the base and soaring
12m (40 ft.) high, and with baluardi (projecting defense works) at 11
different points. The tops of the walls were transformed into a tree-
lined 4.2km (21⁄2-mile) public promenade in the early 19th century,
with access ramps at 9 of the 11 baluardi. Do as the Luccans do and
rent a bike at the city-run stand (Casermetta San Donato, near the
city walls in Piazzale Verdi; % 0583-583150). Prices range from
about 6€ ($7.20) per hour to about 20€ ($24) per day.
 Though not as numerous as the ones in San Gimignano, Lucca’s
medieval towers are still quite special: A full garden with real trees

Fast Facts: Lucca

Pisa
Pisa is much more than its famous Leaning Tower: Its medieval alleys
and buildings overlooking the curving Arno are little visited, yet offer
some of Italy’s nicest riverside views.
You will not need more than three or four hours to visit Pisa’s most
famous attractions, and you can easily do so on a day trip from Florence,
but you would miss much: Pisa deserves exploration and knows how 
to reward its visitors. If you have the time, we recommend spending at
least one night. Pisa also makes an excellent base for exploring the many
other destinations in northern Tuscany, since it has a good selection of
moderately priced hotels and restaurants and a lively cultural life.
Getting there
Only 3km (2 miles) south of town, Pisa’s Aeroporto Galileo Galilei
(% 050-849111; www.pisa-airport.com) is Tuscany’s main airport,
with daily flights from most major towns in Italy and the rest of Europe.
From the airport, you can take a taxi to the center of town; it will cost
you about 5€ to 7€ ($6–$8.40) and take about ten minutes. You can also
take the train to Pisa Centrale rail station, a five-minute ride for 1€
($1.20); trains depart the airport about every hour. If you’re driving,
rental-car counters are at arrivals, inside the airport. Once you have
your car, just follow the signs for PISA CENTRO.
From other points in Italy, the train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) is
an excellent way to get to Pisa. The station, Pisa Centrale (% 050-41385),
is about an hour from Florence and three and a half hours from Rome.
Trains run about every half-hour from Florence and every hour from
Rome; the trip costs about 5€ ($6) and 24€ ($29), respectively. From the
station, take shuttle bus A across the Arno to the Leaning Tower.
If you’re arriving by car, you’ll be able to drive the 96km (60 miles) from
Florence in about an hour or less. From Florence, take autostrada A11 to
Lucca and follow the signs for A12 toward Livorno; watch for the exit for
Pisa shortly after the junction with A12 South. From Florence, you can
also follow the signs for Empoli-Livorno to reach Pisa by the more direct
but slower superstrada (small highway). Three large free parking lots are
located near the center of Pisa, just north of the town’s walls; each is
linked to the center by bus service (electric or otherwise), which costs
0.80€ (90¢) per ticket. The lots are on Via Pietrasantina, only a few hun-
dred yards from the Duomo (Bus: A); Via di Pratale, a few hundred
yards from the Via del Brennero (Bus: 7); and Via del Brennero, near Via
Paparelli and Porta Zeno, 1km (2⁄3 mile) from the Duomo (Bus: E); this
last lot is closed on Wednesday and Saturday from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.
because of an open-air market. Paid parking can be found at Piazza dei
Miracoli and in a lot on Via Cammeo for 1.50€ ($1.80) per hour, the
same rate as metered street parking.

This hotel, right on the Arno and within walking distance of major attrac-

ice. Opened in 1839 as Pisa’s first hotel, it is still run by the same family. It
occupies several medieval buildings, including the remains of a tenth-cen-
tury tower; as a result, guest rooms differ greatly from one another —
some have frescoed ceilings, while others are more simply decorated —
but all are furnished with antiques and kept extremely clean. If you’re plan-
ning to use the garage, you must reserve that ahead of time as well.

of the famous monument. They’re done up with simple yet tasteful fur-
nishings, whitewashed walls, and small bathrooms. The hotel name comes
from a Pisan heroine who saved the city from the Saracens. A nice touch
is the homemade rolls for breakfast.

Dining locally
It is very difficult to have a bad meal here: Restaurants and trattorie are
plentiful and excellent. Food in Pisa includes typical Tuscan fare (see
Chapter 2), such as ribollita (here called zuppa pisana, or Pisan soup —
old rivalries die hard) and, because the sea is nearby, lots of seafood.

Piazza Solferino
PISAN/SEAFOOD
Near the edge of the historic district is Pisa’s best traditional restaurant
and a local favorite. Housed in a 15th-century slaughterhouse (macello), it
nonetheless offers a cozy atmosphere, with beamed ceilings and dark
wood floors. This family-run place serves up traditional Pisan recipes that
are reinterpreted with genius to produce delectable results: homemade
ravioli stuffed with fish and served with a shrimp sauce; delicious gnoc-
chi with pesto and shrimp; stuffed rabbit with creamy truffle sauce; sea
bass with onion sauce . . . we can’t wait to go back!
See map p. 236. Via Volturno 49, off Piazza Solferino. % 050-20424. Reservations nec-
essary. Secondi: 10€–18€ ($12–$22). AE, DC. Open: Thurs–Tues noon to 3 p.m. and
7:30–11 p.m. Closed 2 weeks in Aug.
Antica Trattoria Da Bruno
$
Duomo
PISAN
Within walking distance of the Duomo and just outside the city walls, this
trattoria offers traditional homemade food in a warm atmosphere. You can
sit in one of the various dining rooms, including a small “private” room
that’s the quietest; all have beamed ceilings and whitewashed walls deco-
rated with photographs and copper utensils. The menu is based on the
traditional local cuisine. We definitely recommend the homemade pap-
pardelle with hare sauce, the baccalà coi porri (codfish with fresh toma-
toes and leeks), and the wild-boar stew.

Piazza dei Cavalieri
PISAN
One of the liveliest restaurants in Pisa, this osteria offers simple and tasty
fare at moderate prices. The two small, bright dining rooms are a perfect
background for the food, which delicately mixes tradition with innovation.
We loved the gnocchi with zucchini flowers and pistachio nuts, the zuppa
Pisana, and the tagliata di manzo ai funghi pioppini con cannellini, a per-
fect steak served with wild local mushrooms and white beans.

A picnic in Pisa
The food market on Piazza delle Vettovaglie, a few steps north of Ponte di Mezzo, is
a wonderful sight. Located here since the Middle Ages, it is a lively affair held Monday
through Saturday from 7 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Food producers from the countryside offer
their specialties for sale — fresh vegetables and fruits, Tuscan bread, cured meats,
and all the fixings — so you can get the makings of a great picnic to enjoy along the
riverbank.

If you’re feeling less ambitious, you can get a combination ticket for your
choice of two (6€/$7.20) or three (8€/$9.60) of the museums and monu-
ments in Campo dei Miracoli; again, your options do not include the
Leaning Tower.
To see Pisa via guided tour from Florence, contact American Express
(% 055-50981) or SitaSightseeing (% 055-214721) in Florence. Both
offer tours of Pisa for about 26€ ($31).
The top attractions
Campo dei Miracoli, also called Piazza del Duomo, is Pisa’s monumental
piazza. Built in medieval times abutting the city walls, it is carpeted with
perfect green grass — an ideal background for the carved marble mas-
terpieces in the monumental compound.
Baptistery
Campo dei Miracoli
Standing across from the Duomo, the Baptistery was built between the 12th
and 14th centuries, and its architecture reflects the passage from the
Romanesque to the Gothic style during those years. It is the largest baptis-
tery in Italy and is actually taller — counting the statue on top — than the
famous Leaning Tower. The richly decorated exterior was once further
embellished with statues by the local artist Giovanni Pisano, but many have
been removed to the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo (see later) for safekeep-
ing. Inside is a unique hexagonal pulpit, carved by Nicola Pisano (father of
Giovanni) between 1255 and 1260, and a baptismal font, carved and inlaid
by Guido Bigarelli da Como. Allow about 30 minutes for your visit.
See map p. 236. Piazza del Duomo. % 050-560547. www.opapisa.it. Admission:
5€ ($6). Open: Daily Nov–Feb 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Mar 9 a.m.–6 p.m.; Apr–Sept 8 a.m.–
8 p.m.; Oct 9 a.m.–7 p.m. Last admission 30 minutes earlier.
Camposanto Monumentale (Cemetery)
Campo dei Miracoli
On the edge of Piazza del Duomo stands the elegantly decorated wall of
what must have been the world’s most beautiful cemetery. Designed by
Giovanni di Simone and built in 1278, it was filled with holy dirt from
Golgotha (Calvary) in Palestine — where Christ was crucified — that was
brought back by ship after a Crusade. Decorated with splendid frescoes
inside, it was the burial ground for Pisa’s constables, who had their tombs
richly decorated with sarcophagi, statues, and marble bas-reliefs. During
the 1944 U.S. bombing of Pisa to dislodge the Nazis, the cemetery’s loggia
roof caught fire, and most of the magnificent frescoes were destroyed.
Parts of the frescoes that were salvaged are exhibited inside, along with
Chapter 14: Northern Tuscany and the Cinque Terre 239

photos showing the Camposanto before the destruction. The Museo delle
Sinopie nearby (see later in this section) holds the preliminary frescoes.
Allow at least 20 minutes for your visit.
See map p. 236. Piazza del Duomo. % 050-560-547. www.opapisa.it. Admission:
5€ ($6). Open: Daily Nov–Feb 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Mar 9 a.m.–6 p.m.; Apr–Sept 8 a.m.–8
p.m.; Oct 9 a.m.–7 p.m. Last admission 30 minutes earlier.
Duomo (Cattedrale di Santa Maria Assunta)
Campo dei Miracoli
The center of Campo dei Miracoli is occupied by the magnificent cathe-
dral, Pisa’s Duomo, built by Buschetto in the 11th century. The facade, with
four layers of open-air arches diminishing in size as they ascend, is actu-
ally from the 13th century. In 1595, the cathedral was heavily damaged by
a fire that destroyed three of the four bronze exterior doors and much of
the art inside. The cathedral was restored during the 16th century, inte-
grating some baroque elements. Still original is the monumental bronze
door at the south entrance (Porta San Ranieri), cast by Bonanno Pisano in
1180; the Andrea del Sarto painting of Sant’Agnese at the choir entrance;
the 13th-century mosaic of Christ Pantocrator; and the Cimabue San
Giovanni Evangelista in the apse. The polygonal pulpit carved by Giovanni
Pisano was restored in 1926 when the original pieces were found; they had
been put in storage after the fire in the 16th century. Plan to spend about
40 minutes here.
See map p. 236. Piazza del Duomo. % 050-560547. www.opapisa.it. Admission:
2€ ($2.40). Open: Daily Nov–Feb 10 a.m.–1 p.m. and 2–5 p.m.; Mar 10 a.m.–6 p.m.;
Apr–Sept 10 a.m.–8 p.m.; Oct 10 a.m.–7 p.m. Sun and holidays open for service only
until 1 p.m. Last admission 30 minutes earlier.

The maritime republic of Pisa
The origins of Pisa as a powerful entity in the Mediterranean stretch back to Roman
times, when the Italic settlement that had existed since 1000 B.C. was transformed into
a commercial harbor (in the second century B.C.). The harbor thrived, but the city’s
maritime power was realized only in the 11th century, when Pisa became one of the
four powerful Italian maritime republics, ruling the Mediterranean along with Venice,
Amalfi, and Genoa. These rival ports developed far-flung mercantile empires. Pisa con-
trolled Corsica, Sardinia, and the Balearic Islands, competing with Genoa for com-
merce with the Arabs. Later, the city lost its water access (the river silted up) and its
power: In 1284, Genoa finally won its struggle against Pisa, whose fleet was destroyed.
Genoa became the dominant power in the Tyrrhenian Sea, while Pisa, after severe
battles, shrank to a possession of Florence. During the three centuries of its splendor,
however, the wealth coming from far-flung commerce funded the construction of the
monumental town that you can still admire today.

Leaning Tower (Campanile)
Campo dei Miracoli
Behind the Duomo is the famous tower, actually built as the Duomo’s cam-
panile (bell tower). Started in 1173 by the architect Bonnano, this beauti-
ful eight-story carved masterpiece, with open-air arches matching those
on the Duomo, was finally finished in 1360. It took so long to build because
it started leaning almost from the beginning, so the Pisans stopped con-
struction in 1185. In 1275, they started again and built up to the belfry, clev-
erly curving the structure as they went to compensate for the lean. The
construction stopped again, until 1360, when the belfry was added. Later
architects and engineers studied the problem — the shifting alluvial sub-
soil, saturated with water — but couldn’t devise a solution (one attempt
to fix it made it lean more). In 1990, the lean became so bad — 4.5m (15 ft.)
out of plumb — that the tower was closed to the public. Two years later,
a belt of steel cables was placed around the base, and in 1993, it was
decided to stop using the bells in the belfry to prevent vibrations from
shaking the tower. Finally, after a $24-million restoration, engineers suc-
ceeded in reducing the tower’s lean by 38cm (15 in.). It reopened in
December 2001.
The visit is guided and tours start every 30 minutes; your ticket is valid
only for the time stamped on it. You can make reservations ahead of time
by going to www.opapisa.it a minimum of 15 days in advance for an addi-
tional cost of 2€ ($2.40) per ticket; you must pick up your printed voucher
from the ticket office at least an hour before your reserved slot.
There are no elevators in the tower, and access is through the original —
and very narrow — staircase. It’s 300 steps to the top and it’s impossible
to stop or turn around, making the climb physically and psychologically
taxing. Anybody suffering from vertigo or claustrophobia should not
attempt it. Children under 8 are not allowed in the tower.
See map p. 236. Piazza del Duomo. % 050-560547. www.opapisa.it. Admission:
15€ ($18). Open: Daily Nov–Feb 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.; Mar 1–13 9 a.m.–6 p.m.; Mar 14–20
9 a.m.–7 p.m.; Mar 21–June 13 and Sept 5–30 8:30 a.m.–8:30 p.m.; June 14–Sept 4 8:30
a.m.–11 p.m.; Oct 9 a.m.–7 p.m.
Museo delle Sinopie
Campo dei Miracoli
On the other side of Piazza del Duomo, across from the Camposanto, this
museum houses the sinopie (preparatory sketches for frescoes) found
under the charred remains of the frescoes in the Camposanto after the fire
that destroyed most of them. Each sinopia faces an engraving that shows
what the Camposanto frescoes looked like before their destruction. It is
very well done, allowing visitors to re-experience what the magnificent
Camposanto must have looked like before 1944. More reproductions are in
the Museo dell’Opera (see below). Allow about 30 minutes for your visit.
Note that the museum was temporarily closed at press time, but should be
open again by the time of your visit.

Museo dell’Opera del Duomo
Campo dei Miracoli
Located on the south side of the Leaning Tower, this museum is a show-
case for all the original artworks that were removed from the Duomo and
the other monuments on the Campo dei Miracoli for preservation, includ-
ing the statues by Giovanni Pisano from the Baptistery (see earlier in this
section). Particularly notable are the 11th-century Islamic bronze of a
griffin — booty from a Crusade — that decorated the Duomo’s cupola
before being replaced by a copy, and Giovanni Pisano’s Madonna col
Bambino, carved from an ivory tusk. Also interesting are the etchings that
were prepared in the 19th century by Carlo Lasinio for the restoration of
the frescoes in the Camposanto (see earlier in this section): Colored by
Lasinio’s son, they’re the best existing record of the frescoes. The museum
also holds the original plans of the Duomo, as well as a collection of
ancient artifacts found on the site when the Duomo was built. Allow about
an hour for your visit.

National Museum of San Matteo
Piazza Mazzini
The monuments on Campo dei Miracoli steal the show in Pisa, but this
important museum should not be overlooked if you are interested in
Italian Renaissance art. Its collection of paintings from the 12th to the 
15th centuries is one of the best in the world, and its sculpture gallery —
including works from the Middle Ages to the 16th century — is very rich.
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria

Galileo Galilei
Born in Pisa in 1564, Galileo was an astronomer, astrologer, and philosopher, and
earned his status as one of the fathers of modern physics. Much of his visible activity
involved watching pendulums and dropping balls of differing weights off the Leaning
Tower to prove that they would hit the ground at the same time. Many people thought
he was nuts, and the church excommunicated (and nearly executed) him for the blas-
phemy of suggesting that the universe did not revolve around the earth, but instead the
earth revolved around the sun. In the scientific world, he is considered the father of
modern science, together with Francis Bacon. Among his achievements are several
improvements on the telescope and the discovery of the first and second laws of
motion.

Some of the works come from nearby churches, particularly from Santa
Maria della Spina (see later), while others are from ecclesiastical buildings
farther away in the town’s territory. Important masterpieces include the
1426 painting San Paolo by Masaccio, two paintings of the Madonna con i
Santi by Ghirlandaio, the sculpture of the Madonna del Latte by Andrea
and Nino Pisano, and sculptures by Donatello. Consider spending one or
two hours at this museum.
See map p. 236. Lungarno Mediceo-Piazza San Matteo, near Piazza Mazzini. 
% 050-541865. Admission: 5€ ($6). Open: Tues–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m.; Sun 9 a.m.–2 p.m.
Closed Jan 1, May 1, Aug 15, and Dec 25.
Santa Maria della Spina
Ponte Solferino
This small church, which has survived in spite of its dangerous location on
unstable ground near the river bed, is a treasure-trove of marble carvings.
Built on the river shore in 1230 as an oratory near a bridge that was
destroyed in the 15th century, the church was enlarged during the 14th
century and decorated by some of the town’s best artists of the time. Its
foundation was reinforced several times over the centuries, and in 1871, as
a final drastic effort to consolidate the ground on which the church was
built, the entire structure was taken apart and rebuilt on a 1.2m-high 
(4-ft.) base. During this process, many of the original sculptures were
moved to the Museo Nazionale di San Matteo and replaced with copies,
and the entire sacristy was destroyed. Although this loss somewhat ruined
the proportions of the building, it remains one of the most delightful exam-
ples of Tuscan Gothic architecture. The many delicate carvings on the
external walls, as well as the elegant arches and windows and the simple
interior, make a wonderful setting for the sculptural masterpiece by
Andrea and Nino Pisano, the Madonna Della Rosa (1345–48). Plan to spend
about a half-hour here.
See map p. 236. Lungarno Gambacorti, near Ponte Solferino. % 055-321-5446.
Admission: 1.50€ ($1.80). Open: Nov–Feb Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–2 p.m., second Sun of

More cool things to see and do
 Some of the town celebrations are great fun: A traditional event is
the Gioco del Ponte, held on the last Sunday in June, when teams
from the north and south sides of the Arno fight each other.
Wearing Renaissance costumes, the teams use a decorated 6,300-
kilogram (7-ton) cart to push each other off the Ponte di Mezzo, 
the Roman bridge at the center of Pisa. Another celebration is the
Festa di San Ranieri, on June 16th and 17th, held in honor of Pisa’s
patron saint. The Arno is lit with torches all along its length, which
makes for quite a beautiful sight. Contact the tourist office for more
info (see “Fast Facts: Pisa,” later in this chapter).

 To get a different perspective on the town, you can visit one, 
or both, of Pisa’s medieval towers. The Torre di Santa Maria
(Piazza del Duomo; % 050-560547; Admission: 2€/$2.40, free for
children under 10; Open: Daily Mar–Oct 11 a.m.–2 p.m. and 3–6 p.m.;

Fri–Sun 3–7 p.m., Nov–Feb Sat–Sun 2–5 p.m., second Sun of month
10 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–5 p.m.) affords great views of the Arno and
surrounding countryside.
 The best way to fully savor the medieval flavor of Pisa is to take the
Tour Lungarno cruise along the urban portion of the Arno, oper-
ated by the Cooperativa il Navicello (Lungarno Galilei 7; % 050-
540162 or 338-9808867; www.ilnavicello.it). Boats leave from
San Paolo a Ripa d’Arno toward the west edge of the historic dis-
trict, April through November on Saturday, Sunday, and holidays at

5 p.m.). Tours are by reservation only, the trip lasts about an hour,
and tickets are 5€ ($6) per person.
 Pisa has a long tradition of intellectual life — local circles played an
important role during the Risorgimento, the movement that led to
the unification of Italy in the 19th century (see Chapter 2). The
Caffè dell’Ussero (Largo Pacinotti 27; % 050-581100) is where
Pisa’s intellectuals and their famous visitors met and mingled.
Housed in the 15th-century Palazzo Agostini and still decorated
with some of the original furnishings, it makes a delicious ice cream
that you can savor on the terrace by the Arno river or as you stroll
along the promenade.

Chapter 14: Northern Tuscany and the Cinque Terre 245
The Cinque Terre
If you push on a bit farther along the coast, you’ll enter the eastern part
of the Italian Riviera, the Riviera di Levante. Nestled here at the water’s
edge, and insulated from the areas farther inland by towering promonto-
ries, are five small towns: Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia,
Manarola, and Riomaggiore, defining a fishing and agricultural area 
of great natural beauty. Generally called Cinque Terre (literally “five
lands”), they were declared a national park a few years back — the first
example of a national park created to protect a man-made environment.
In addition, the sea surrounding them is now a national marine park.
The Cinque Terre region is a great place to spend time with your kids.
The breathtaking views, the sea, and the swimming and hiking provide a
great respite from the usual cultural attractions.
While it is possible to “do” the Cinque Terre in a day, the area is defi-
nitely worth more time if you can spare it — especially if you’re into
hiking and swimming.
Getting there
Auto traffic within the park is limited to residents, but each of the 
villages is served by train. Contact Trenitalia (% 892021; www.
trenitalia.it) for details. There is direct service from Pisa to
Riomaggiore and to Monterosso; from all other towns, you’ll have to
switch in La Spezia to the local line for Levanto, stopping at each of the
five village stations (some runs go only to Riomaggiore and Monterosso).
Don’t expect a scenic ride, though, as the route has been carved into the
cliff and most of the trip is inside a tunnel. It will cost about 5€ ($6) from
Pisa for the 30-minute trip. Electric minibuses connect each train station
with the village harbors, trail heads, and other destinations in the park.

12€ ($14) for adults and 6.50€ ($7.80) for children 6 to 11.
If you have a car, you’ll have to park it. Your best bet is the ACIPARK
lot in La Spezia (Via Crispi 73; % 0187-510545), which will cost you only
4€ ($4.40) for the day. There is also a parking lot in Monterosso al Mare

about 8.30€ ($10) per day. From there, you can get a taxi to town for
about 7€ ($8.40) or take the shuttle bus (fare included in the Cinque
Terre Card; see sidebar in this section).

The gulf of the poets
This idyllic stretch of coast, the eastern section of the Italian Riviera, has gained its
romantic nickname for being the favorite destination — and, at times, abode — of
famous poets and artists. The name actually refers to the bay of La Spezia (the major
town in the region), but extends to the Cinque Terre, which lie on the western shore
of the promontory closing the gulf to the west. From the Latin poet Polibio to Dante,
Petrarch, and Montesquieu, the charms of this coast have inspired many a writer. The
most famous of all were probably Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein, and her
husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley — who met his death in these beautiful waters — but
other famous visitors have included Lord Byron, Virginia Woolf, and D. H. Lawrence.

Dining locally
The cuisine of the Cinque Terre is one of the attractions of the park.
Based on local seafood, it uses plenty of fresh herbs — such as the basil
for the pesto sauce, now famous around the world (see Chapter 2). Here
are our favorite options besides the very good restaurant in the Hotel
Marina Piccola (see earlier in this section).
Cappun Magru in Casa di Marin
$$
Groppo
CREATIVE LIGURIAN
You’ll have to climb up the cliff to enjoy the superb cuisine at this gourmet
hide-out. The restaurant is small and delightful, and the menu spins tradi-
tion with flair for the best combinations. We highly recommend the dish
that gives its name to this restaurant, the cappon magro (a rich fish and
vegetable layered salad), as well as the gnocchi with prawns and a deli-
cious Gorgonzola and Calvados sauce. Leave room for the scrumptious
chocolate mousse with stewed cherries.

with a menu that’s certified organic. The yellow walls, wood accents, and
beautiful linens and real crystal on the tables create a sunny atmosphere.
The terrace — open in peak season — is high above the sea, with a breath-
taking view. We definitely recommend the antipasto platter, with all the
Cinque Terre fish specialties: stuffed mussels and anchovies, marinated
octopus and anchovies, and baccalà (codfish) dumplings.

The Cinque Terre Card
Available at any of the tourist info desks inside the rail stations of La Spezia,
Riomaggiore, Manarola, Vernazza, Corniglia, and Monterosso (see “Fast Facts: The
Cinque Terre,” later in this chapter), the Cinque Terre Card (www.parconazionale5
terre.it) is the best deal in the park: The pass gives you unlimited rides on trains
between La Spezia and each of the villages in the Cinque Terre, and on the minibuses
within the park, as well as free access to the trails and all the structures of the park
(picnic areas, nature observation centers, and so on). You also get free maps and dis-
counts on the boat pass, mountain-bike rentals, and horse and carriages rides. The
daily card costs 5.40€ ($6.50) for adults and 2.70€ ($3.25) for children 5 to 12. Three-
and seven-day cards are also available.

Exploring the Cinque Terre
To fully enjoy this magnificent land that slopes steeply to the sea, we
recommend taking a boat tour: Viewing the Cinque Terre from the water
is part of the magic that shouldn’t be missed. The Consorzio Marittimo
Turistico 5 Terre Golfo dei Poeti (% 0187-732987; www.navigazione
golfodeipoeti.it) runs half- and full-day cruises during the season
(Mar 27–Nov 1), leaving from Molo Italia (dock Italia) in La Spezia. Boats
leave at 9:15 a.m. and 10 a.m. for the full-day excursion, or 2:15 p.m. for
the afternoon trip, and return by 6:30 p.m. The cost is 21€ ($25) for the
whole day and 16€ ($19) for the afternoon only; children 6 to 11 pay 12€
($14) for either cruise. You’re free to hop on and off between the villages
as you please using the local boat service, as your ticket also includes
unlimited rides for that.
Purchasing the Cinque Terre Card (see sidebar earlier) will give you
unlimited access to all the trails of the park and to public transportation,
including trains between the villages and — more important — the elec-
tric minibuses running up and down along the cliff and connecting all
the attractions.
The top attractions
The cliffs surrounding the villages are the real attraction of the National
Park of the Cinque Terre, which was recently declared a World Heritage
Site by UNESCO. Amazingly steep, they have been cultivated for cen-
turies, with narrow terraces built using dry stone walling — over 7,000m
(21,000 ft.) of it. Vineyards are planted all the way down to the edge of the
sea, together with luscious lemon and olive trees. During the harvest,
farmers secure themselves with ropes to keep from falling. Progress has
come to the area, however, so here and there you may notice small lifts
that look something like monorails.
Corniglia
The only inland village of the Cinque Terre — though you can reach the
sea by way of an old flight of steps — it is also the most agricultural of
them all. The cobblestone streets of Corniglia wind from door to door
and to its church, San Pietro. Built in 1334 above a chapel from the 11th
century, the church was redone during the baroque period, but the
Romanic facade was preserved. The whole town is like a step back in
time, with several medieval buildings of interest — such as the arched
Gothic building made of black stone, believed to have been the postal
station of the Fieschi family. The town’s agricultural tradition goes back
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
250

millennia: Corniglia was already exporting wine to Pompeii during the
Roman period.
Manarola
Manarola, a lovely sight from a distance with its gaily colored houses, is
a real fishermen’s village, still dependent on the sea. It’s enclosed in a
gorge opening onto a small harbor between two rocky cliffs. Manarola
contains the 14th-century Romanic church of San Lorenzo, highlighted
by a splendid rose window. From Manarola starts — or ends — the
famous Via dell’Amore (Love Trail), the easiest of the trails joining the
villages (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
Monterosso al Mare
This is the largest of the five villages that comprise the Cinque Terre; it’s
also the only one with a nice sandy beach, giving Monterosso the feeling
of an old-fashioned seaside resort. It’s wonderful for swimming, even
though most of the beach is divided into private swaths for the hotels
lining the beachfront. This is also the busiest of the villages, and some
say the least authentic. In reality, it’s just different: Because high cliffs
don’t surround it on all sides, the old town has seen the growth of a
modern section toward the rail station and the beach, called Fegina.
But the heart of Monterosso is still beautiful and unspoiled. The
medieval tower Aurora separates the modern town from the old; it’s
where you’ll find the late-Romanic church San Giovanni Battista, with a
beautiful rosette on the facade and an elegant portico in back. Farther
up, you’ll climb to the other church in town, San Francesco, within the
complex of the convent of the Capuchins. Built in 1619, it is a nice exam-
ple of Tuscan/Ligurian Gothic in green-and-white-striped marble. Inside,
you can admire a fine crucifixion attributed to Van Dyck.
Riomaggiore
Like Manarola, fishing is still an important industry in this village.
Noteworthy attractions include the church of San Giovanni Battista, a
fine example of late-Romanic architecture with two beautiful lateral por-
tals from the 14th century. Uniting this village with Manarola is the most
famous section of the coastal path: the Via dell’Amore (Love Trail) — 
a trail that was excavated in the cliff and offers fabulous views. It was
closed for more than five years after a landslide blocked it, but it is now
fully accessible again.
Vernazza
Vernazza is a very tiny fishing village with a strong medieval flavor.
Dominated by its castle, it was founded around the year 1000. Overlooking
the village is the Gothic church of Santa Margherita di Antiochia, built
right on the water with an unusual octagonal bell tower. The fishing
harbor offers a fine view over the rest of the bay.
Chapter 14: Northern Tuscany and the Cinque Terre 251

More cool things to see and do
 If you are here to hike, you can tackle the Cinque Terre Trail (diffi-
culty level: easy; Admission: one section 3.50€/$4.20, unlimited
with Cinque Terre Card, described earlier in this chapter) between
Riomaggiore and Monterosso al Mare: It will take you about five
hours, but you need an iron will not to stop and linger in any of the
villages or the beaches along the way. To everybody else, we rec-
ommend instead the easy — and fairly flat — section of the trail
known as the Via dell’Amore between Riomaggiore and Manarola:
You’ll get the full Cinque Terre experience without exhausting your-
self. The walk takes only about 30 minutes. If you’re more ambi-
tious, add the two sections from Manarola to Corniglia and
Corniglia to Vernazza, each taking about 45 minutes. The last sec-
tion of the trail — from Vernazza to Monterosso — is quite differ-
ent, with winding ups and downs, and a precipitous descent into
Monterosso. We don’t recommend it, except for those fit travelers
who specifically want to hike; allow about one and a half hours.
Always hike with at least one companion, bring at least a quart of
water per person (especially in summer, when it gets very hot), and
wear sturdy walking shoes. The trail is along a cliff, and landslides
are not uncommon. If you’re lucky, during your walk you may see a
local farmer standing where you’d think only goats can perch, lov-
ingly tending to one of his plants.
 Only a few sandy beaches can be found along this rocky coast: 
The largest is in Monterosso al Mare, where you can even rent a
beach chair — but it gets extremely crowded, as it is right in town.
Between Corniglia and Vernazza, you can climb down — via a steep
path off the Cinque Terre Trail (see above for admission prices) —
to the romantic small pebble-and-sand beach of Guvano, where
you can dive into the clean waters of the park in the nude, if you
wish (it’s a favorite nudist spot). Easier access is through the
tunnel starting north of Corniglia train station (ring the bell at 
the gate for access). You’ll also find a tiny but pretty beach in
Riomaggiore at the south of the harbor, down a flight of steps.
 More trails connect each of the villages with its Sanctuary (church
dedicated to the Madonna) up the cliff. The trails were the tradi-
tional paths used by the villagers before the local road — SS370 —
was built to reach the churches and the hamlets in between, but
nowadays you can also use public transportation (taxis and
minibuses). The destination of religious processions, these
Romanesque and early Gothic churches dominate the surrounding
countryside high above the sea — fantastic stages for breathtaking
views. Some are more interesting than others: Nostra Signora di
Soviore, overlooking Monterosso, sports the oldest campanile in
Liguria, dating back to the eighth century, while its simple 14th-
century facade is ornamented with a beautiful rose window and
portal. The area in front of the church offers awe-inspiring views
and serves as venue for classical concerts during high season (ask

Montenero overlooks Riomaggiore 340m (1,120 ft.) above sea level;
the church was built in 1335, perhaps over an eighth-century
chapel, and the monastery now houses a good and atmospheric
restaurant, Ca’ de Cian (% 0187-920992; cadecian.tsx.org;
reservations necessary; prix-fixe lunch or dinner: 20€/$24; Open:

Nostra Signora della Salute, in Volastra, also has a simple facade
enlivened by a superb carved portal and a delicate Gothic double-
arched window.
 Hiking is not the only way to explore the park: you can go moun-
tain biking or horseback riding, or even relax on a horse-drawn
carriage ride along the many trails in the area. You can rent moun-
tain bikes for just 4€ ($4.80) per day or book a carriage ride or a
horseback ride (or even a class) at any of the tourist information
desks inside the rail stations in the park (also in La Spezia for the
horse and carriage rides; see “Fast Facts: The Cinque Terre,” later
in this chapter). Prices for horse and carriage rides depend on the
number of hours and participants; consider about 16€ ($19) per
hour per person for a horse ride and about 25€ ($30) per hour per
person for a carriage ride.
 The sea along the national park is a protected marine park which
can be best enjoyed via snorkeling and scuba-diving excursions.
Daiwing 5 Terre Immersioni, in Riomaggiore (Via San Giacomo 1;
% 0187-920011), is a licensed dive center offering guided excur-
sions and equipment rentals. Excursions cost about 22€ ($26) per

 Visiting saints and monasteries in Assisi
 Thrilling to the music festivals in Spoleto
T
he beauty of the landscape and the rich culture of this area make
this part of Italy the most beloved both by Italians and foreigners.
While this may be where the wealthy dream to have their countryside
homes, all visitors can enjoy the riches of this area, where a castle or
walled city seems to top each hill. Perhaps the most famous of all is San
Gimignano, with its beautiful towers — a perfectly preserved medieval
town of considerable commercial importance back then, and delightfully
romantic now. Continuing southeast across the Chianti region, famous
for its flavorful ruby-red wine, you arrive at Siena, Italy’s most beautiful
medieval town — and our favorite. We love it all, from the Palio delle
Contrade (a furiously contested horse race that has been held in the
city’s main square, the Piazza del Campo, since medieval times) to its
streets and many monuments. Continuing southeast, you’ll enter Umbria
with its deep-green hills. Perugia, the region’s capital, is a wonderful 
and lively university town, rich in art and historic sights. Not far to the
east is Assisi, hometown of San Francesco (St. Francis), Italy’s patron
saint, and Santa Chiara (St. Clare). Spoleto is famous for its music and
art festivals — the Festival di Spoleto and the Stagione Lirica — but it’s
also a delightful small medieval town offering beautiful vistas and inter-
esting monuments.
If you have the time to explore the charms of the countryside, we defi-
nitely recommend renting a car (especially if you want to cover a lot of
ground) — you’re then free to base yourself outside the major towns.

You will not need your car within the towns, however, since each is
small enough to be easily seen on foot (even Perugia, which is the
largest of all). So, if your time is limited, you can do quite well using
public transportation between the major destinations. Siena and Perugia
both make good bases for exploring the region, as they offer lots of serv-
ices as well as gorgeous surroundings. To see the scope of the entire
Tuscan and Umbrian landscape, see the “Tuscany and Umbria” map in
Chapter 14.
San Gimignano
This is one of southern Tuscany’s most famous destinations, and with
good reason: It is a perfectly preserved medieval town with a pictur-
esque skyline of towers.
San Gimignano makes an easy day trip from Siena or even Florence, but
it can also be a romantic place to spend the night, with its view of the
twinkling lights of other Tuscan hill towns. You can explore the town’s
major attractions in about four hours.
Getting there
The easiest way to reach San Gimignano is by bus from Siena; TRA-IN
(% 0577-204246; www.trainspa.it) offers regular service. The trip
takes about 50 minutes and costs 4€ ($4.80). From all other locales, you
need to first reach the nearby town of Poggibonsi, well served by both
train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) and bus, and from there switch
to the local bus to San Gimignano — it’s doable, but laborious. To avoid
the hassle, it would be easier to join a guided tour from Florence (see
later in this section) or to rent a car.
To reach San Gimignano by car, get on the autostrada Florence–Pisa and
take either the COLLE DI VAL D’ELSA exit (which takes you along picturesque
small roads through the countryside) or the much faster POGGIBONSI exit,
through a busy industrial area. The sign on the highway doesn’t say San
Gimignano, but after you exit, you will see signs for San Gimignano on
SS324. The trip takes about 11⁄2 hours from Florence and slightly less time
from Siena. Once you arrive, you’ll need to park outside the town’s walls,
as San Gimignano is closed to private traffic. You can drive to your hotel
to deposit your luggage, but you need to have the authorization arranged
by the hotel in advance. None of the hotels inside the town walls have
parking, but you can use the lots outside the walls for 16€ ($19) per day.
Spending the night
In the low season between November and March, the major hotels in
town take turns staying open, so there is always a place to stay.

Outside town walls
This is our favorite hotel here — if you don’t mind a ten-minute walk out-
side the town walls. Actually a resort overlooking the luscious countryside
and surrounded by a private park with a pool and Jacuzzi, it’s the grand
way to see San Gimignano, and yet it isn’t really that expensive — 
especially if you take advantage of its special rates or stay in one of the
smaller rooms. All rooms are beautifully decorated; some have private 
terraces.

Dining locally
The area is known for its wines, and the best place to sample them is at
Gustavo (Via San Matteo 29; % 0577-940057), perhaps accompanied by
the excellent selection of local cured meats, cheese, and fett’unta (toasted
bread with extra-virgin olive oil and veggie toppings). Another wine bar is
attached to the restaurant of the Bel Soggiorno hotel (see earlier).

SIENESE/CREATIVE
On a tiny street near the Duomo, this excellent restaurant is popular with
both locals and Italian gourmands. The food has a classic Tuscan base,
with seasonal themes and some variations on local specialties. You’ll find
perfect pici (fresh homemade local pasta), maybe seasoned with a rabbit
ragout, and excellent stewed local lamb. Note that the secondi here always
include a side dish.

This restaurant is the classiest place to dine in San Gimignano, yet it’s still
very affordable. It opens onto the village’s most picturesque square and
features two dining rooms, one with a breathtaking view of the surround-
ing valley, and the other — original from the 13th century — with medieval
beamed ceilings and wooden furniture. The food is classic countryside
fare, starting from the excellent crostini to the mouthwatering grilled meat
and game ragù.

Chapter 15: Southern Tuscany and Umbria 259
Rise and fall of a small town
San Gimignano was a dormant small village for centuries after it was established by the
Etruscans in the third century B.C. It was only when the main route from Italy to France
went right through the village in the Middle Ages that San Gimignano’s fortunes changed.
Thanks also to a flourishing saffron industry, the local merchants became rich and
marked their increasing pride by building palazzi. Towers, the symbol of the palazzo
owner’s wealth, went up like crazy during the town’s period of great economic success
in the 13th century. So much competition existed in tower-building — always higher and
higher — that the government made a law forbidding any tower taller than the one on
the Palazzo del Popolo, the seat of the government. The economic boom was suddenly
wiped out by the plague (which hit San Gimignano several times between the 14th and
17th centuries), a disaster that ultimately preserved the town, allowing it to remain
basically intact as a typical walled medieval village with no modern additions.

Thurs–Mon 12:30–2:30 p.m. and Wed–Mon 7:30–10 p.m. Closed for a period between
Nov and Mar.
Exploring San Gimignano
You can book a guided tour or pick up an audio guide (5€/$6) at 
the tourist office (ProLoco; Piazza Duomo 1; % 0577-940008; www.
sangimignano.com). You can also book a bus tour from Florence; the
best are organized by American Express (% 055-50981) and SITA
(% 055-214721; www.sita-on-line.it), which both charge about 
50€ ($60).
The Civic Museums combination ticket includes admission to Palazzo
del Popolo, Pinacoteca, Torre Grossa, Santa Fina Apothecary, and
Archaeological Museum; it costs 7.50€ ($9). Another combination ticket
includes admission to the Duomo and the Museum of Religious Art for
5.50€ ($6.60).
The top attractions
The town itself is the attraction here, and walking through its medieval
alleys is quite magical. Of the original 72 or so medieval towers which
are the symbol of town, only 15 remain today, including the tallest: the
one on the Palazzo del Popolo (see later in this chapter). Piazza della
Cisterna, at the heart of town, is the most attractive in San Gimignano
and an elegant example of medieval architecture: Triangular in shape
and beautifully paved with bricks, it is lined with some of the town’s
most important palazzi, such as the Palazzo Tortoli-Treccani at no. 22,
with its double row of bifore (double lancet windows). The center of the
square is graced by a picturesque well: It gives access to an underlying
cistern, which held the town’s water supply in case of siege. The main
street — Via San Matteo — is a section of the medieval highway to
France which brought wealth and renown to town. Besides its historical
interest — it was the most important route between northern and south-
ern Europe — it’s a beautiful section of medieval San Gimignano, lined
with palaces and towers.
Duomo (Basilica di S. Maria Assunta) and Santa Fina Chapel
Still called the Duomo by locals — although according to the Catholic
church’s administration, it technically doesn’t deserve the title (the town
has no bishop and its cathedral should be called a Collegiata) — the basil-
ica was built in the 12th century. Its facade is very plain, but once inside
you’ll discover a gorgeously decorated Romanesque interior with tiger-
striped arches and a galaxy of gold stars. Among the treasures are the
wooden statues of Gabriele and Annunziata by Jacopo della Quercia and
the 14th-century frescoes decorating the naves. The right nave’s last chapel
is the Chapel of Santa Fina, one of the most beautiful from the Tuscan
Renaissance. Designed by Giuliano and Benedetto da Maiano — Benedetto
also carved the panel of the altar — its glorious cycle of frescoes by
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
260

Domenico Ghirlandaio describes the life of a local girl named Fina, who
became the town’s patron saint.
See map p. 257. Piazza del Duomo. % 0577-940316. Admission: 3.50€ ($4.20). Open:
Feb 1–Mar 31, Nov 1–15 and Jan 2–15 Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–4:40 p.m., Sun and holidays
12:30–4:40 p.m.; Apr 1–Oct 31 Mon–Fri 9:30 a.m.–7:10 p.m., Sat 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun
and holidays 12:30–5:10 p.m.; Nov 16–30 and Jan 16–30 open only for mass. Closed
Jan 1, Jan 31, Mar 12, Dec 25, and first Sun in Aug.
Palazzo del Popolo
Built between 1288 and 1323 (except for its crenellations, which were a
19th-century addition), this was the government headquarters. Its tower,
the Torre Grossa, was added in 1311 and is the tallest in town, 53m (177 ft.)
high. We recommend climbing the tower to get a superb view over the
town. The interior of the palace is decorated with great frescoes and fur-
nishings from the 14th and 15th centuries. It also houses the Civic Museum,
where you’ll find the Sala di Dante (Dante’s Room), decorated with splen-
did frescoes by Lippo Memmi (his Maestà is considered a masterpiece).
See map p. 257. Piazza del Duomo 1. % 0577-990312. Admission: 5€ ($6). Open: Daily
Mar 1–Oct 31 9:30 a.m.–7 p.m.; Nov 1–Feb 28 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m. Closes at 1:30 p.m. 
Dec 24, 5 p.m. Dec 25 and 31. Closed Jan 31.
More cool things to see and do
If you have the time, you may want to explore more of the village’s
medieval delights. Here are a few additional options:
 A pleasant and easy excursion is the 15-minute walk out of town
from Porta delle Fonti to the medieval fountain. You’ll follow in the
footsteps of medieval town dwellers: This fountain provided San
Gimignano with running water and was where locals did their laun-
dry. The 14th-century arched construction hides the 9th-century
Longobard fountain inside.
 Sant’Agostino (Piazza Sant’Agostino; % 0577-940383) is a beauti-
ful 13th-century Romanesque-Gothic church. Its plain facade hides
a superb cycle of frescoes on the life of St. Augustine, done by
Benozzo Gozzoli; also interesting is his fresco of St. Sebastian on
the third altar to the left. The church is open daily from 7 a.m. to
noon and 3 to 6 p.m. (Jan and Feb reopens at 4 p.m.; Apr 1–Oct 31
closes at 7 p.m.). Admission is free.
 To explore the dark side of San Gimignano, you can visit the Torture
Instruments Museum (Via del Castello 1, off Piazza della Cisterna; 
% 0577-942243; Admission: 8€/$9.60; Open: daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.,
later on weekends and in summer), appropriately housed in the 
so-called Devil’s Tower; and the smaller Torture and Witchcraft
Museum (Via San Giovanni, % 0577-940526; Admission: 4€/$4.80;
Open: daily 9 a.m.–7 p.m.). Note: These museums may be appropri-
ate for teenagers, but not for young children.

Siena
This is our favorite town in Tuscany. With its rich orange tones and
myriad tiled roofs baking in the strong sun, Siena is a sculpture in its
own right. It is a magnificent medieval city surrounded by sun-drenched
countryside, but Siena is far from being a museum piece. Passion per-
vades Sienese life — and you can experience the love the residents have
for their town and their traditions during their time-honored Palio horse
race (see later in this section).
To do justice to Siena, you should spend the night in town. But if you
don’t have the time, one day is enough to see the highlights; you can
also visit as a day trip from Florence, which is better than nothing.
Getting there
Only 62km (37 miles) south of Florence, Siena is best reached by bus,
either from Florence or Rome. The bus station is in Piazza Gramsci, off
the La Lizza pedestrian gallery only steps from the town center. TRA-IN
(% 0577-204246; www.trainspa.it) and SITA (% 800-373760;
www.sita-on-line.it) offer regular service from Florence (from the
SITA bus station near the SMN train station); the trip takes 11⁄4 hours and
costs about 5€ ($6), with buses leaving every half-hour. SENA (% 800-
930960 or 0577-283203; www.sena.it) runs seven daily buses from
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria

The Chianti
This gorgeous region between Florence and Siena has it all: velvety hills, tiny medieval
towns, and acres of vineyards and olive groves. An agricultural area of uncommon
beauty, the soft slopes of its hills bloom with magnificent colors in every season. The
tallest hills are topped by medieval walled towns and pieve (fortified churches). Break
our rule about driving in Italy and put the pedal to the metal on the Chiantigiana
(SS222), the local road linking Florence to Siena (or at least take a bus tour; see later
in this chapter). This winding 66km (41-mile) road was established as the route for col-
lecting wine from each vineyard in the region and bringing it to Florence — so it’s per-
fect for tourists, as it passes through each of the major points of interest in the area.
If you’re pressed for time, head to Greve in Chianti, the area’s main village. It has a
delightful piazza and an excellent restaurant/hotel, the Giovanni da Verrazzano (Piazza
Giacomo Matteotti 28; % 055-853189; closed Wed and Sun). Good restaurants, hotels,
resorts, and vineyards abound, of course, as it is difficult to have a bad meal in the
Chianti — and impossible to have a bad glass of wine, provided you stick to the local
red. Among the places to stay, we recommend the Castello di Spaltenna, in Gaiole in
Chianti (Via Spaltenna 13; % 0577-749483; www.spaltenna.com), a real medieval
castle; and the much more modest but delightful Villa Rosa di Boscorotondo, in
Panzano (Via San Leolino 59, 5km/3 miles south of Greve on SS222; % 055-852577;
www.resortvillarosa.it). In Spedaluzzo, La Cantinetta (Via Mugnano 93,
2.3km/11⁄2 miles north of Greve on SS222; % 055-8572000; closed Mon) is a superb
restaurant housed in a two-centuries-old farmhouse. Worth a visit is the 11th-century
Castello di Uzzano (% 055-854032; Open: Apr–Oct daily 8:30 a.m.–6 p.m., winter, by
reservation only), a beautiful vineyard located on a side road 5km (3 miles) northeast
of Greve in Chianti. You can visit the cellars (admission: 5€/$6) and tour the famous
gardens (admission: 6€/$7.20).
Head of the Chianti League in the Middle Ages, Radda in Chianti also makes a good
destination. Nearby (about 11km/7 miles southeast of Radda), you can visit the Castello
di Brolio (% 0577-749066; www.ricasoli.it), one of the region’s oldest wine-pro-
ducing estates and the birthplace of the Chianti Classico we know today. Visitors can
explore part of the spectacular grounds and gardens (Admission: 3€/$3.60; Open:
summer 9 a.m. to noon and 3–6 p.m.; winter 9 a.m. to noon and 2–5 p.m.) and take a tour
of the cellars (by appointment) for 23€ ($28).
If you don’t care for driving, we recommend the day tours organized by SITA (% 055-
214721; www.sita-on-line.it). They cost 32€ ($38) and are offered daily from
Florence.

town center (% 0577-280115). You then have to take a taxi or a minibus
(no. C to Piazza Gramsci). You’ll find direct train service from Florence
(and the nearby towns of Empoli and Chiusi), but from most other desti-
nations, you’ll have to change trains at one of the above stations. The
trip from Rome takes about 3 hours and costs about 17€ ($20); from
Venice, it takes about 5 hours and costs about 28€ ($34). Florence is
about 11⁄2 hours away and costs about 6€ ($7.20).
If you’re renting a car, it is easy enough to drive here (via the Florence/
Siena highway or by taking exit VAL DI CHIANA from the A1 highway, and
then following SS326), but keep in mind that the town center is pedes-
trian-only. When you arrive in Siena, you will need to leave your car for
the duration of your stay at one of the parking lots (Siena Parcheggi; 
% 0577-228711; www.sienaparcheggi.com) at the various gates of
town; they charge 1.50€ ($1.80) per hour, which adds up to 36€ ($43)
per day. Don’t even dream of parking for free outside the town walls if
you don’t want your car broken into or stolen. From the parking lots,
you can then use the public minibus to reach the center of town; the
buses run daily from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. One ticket, valid one hour, costs
0.90€ ($1); a daily pass is 3.50€ ($4.20).
Spending the night
It used to be that all hotels in Siena’s historic district were modest proper-
ties offering basic accommodations, and if you wanted modern amenities
you had to head for the modern part of town — but this has changed, and
you’ll now find hotels for all tastes and budgets, including a luxury five-
star: the recently opened Grand Hotel Continental (Banchi di Sopra 85;
% 0577-56011; www.grandhotelcontinentalsiena.it), housed in a
beautifully frescoed historic palazzo.
Garden Hotel
$$
North of the town’s medieval walls
This elegant 1700 villa is only 1.5km (1 mile) north of the city walls, up a
hill among vineyards, olive groves, and a park full of oak trees. (The walk
downhill to town is very pleasant, but take a bus or taxi on your way back.)
Guest rooms are divided among the villa itself and three annexes; are all
large and tastefully furnished. We prefer those in the Belvedere annex 
(decorated in period style with some antiques) and the Poggiarello annex
(luminous and modern in décor). Guests have access to a tennis court and
a large outdoor pool, and the terrace affords panoramic views of Siena and
the countryside. The restaurant is elegant but has a warm atmosphere.

Hotel Antica Torre
$
Porta Romana
This small, family-run hotel has only eight rooms, but they’re in a real 16th-
century tower (torre), romantically appointed with marble floors and
antique furniture. The two rooms on the top floors offer views of Siena and
the countryside. Because it’s a tower, however, don’t expect huge rooms,
air-conditioning, or an elevator.

Duomo
The lengthy renovations of this 17th-century family palace have finally
brought this hotel to its full potential: The beautiful architectural 
details — vaulted ceilings, checked tiled floors, hardwood parquet — have
now been completely restored. Guest rooms are bright, with plaster walls
and some with frescoed ceilings. The garden, which has beautiful views, is
the setting for a typical American breakfast in the high season, as well as
dinner, should you decide to take advantage of the hotel’s perfectly ade-
quate restaurant.

SIENESE
If you’ve come to Siena for a romantic getaway, Al Marsili is the perfect
choice. It lives up to its reputation by offering excellent service, an elegant
but warm atmosphere, and superb food. You can find staples of Sienese
cuisine here, such as delicious homemade pici, as well as specialties like
faraona alla Medici (guinea hen with pine nuts, almonds, and prunes) and
an excellent selection of wines.

SIENESE
This charming trattoria, close to Piazza del Campo, is a favorite with the
Sienese. The food is good, sometimes remarkable. Try the duck stewed
with tomatoes, the Sienese favorite pici alla Cardinale (homemade
spaghetti with hot tomato sauce), or the pappardelle with wild-boar sauce.
The place welcomes families with kids and provides a selection of half-
portion dishes for the younger ones.

Santa Caterina
SIENESE/WINE BAR
The excellent cuisine here is a fine match for the wonderful cellar with
over a thousand wines. The menu offers lighter choices for lunch and
heartier ones at dinner — all made with local ingredients. We recommend
the ravioli maremmani (ravioli with a sauce of goat cheese and basil) and
the rabbit with olives. If you come during a lull, you can even ask for a tour
of the cellars, which are housed in part of a medieval aqueduct running
under the building.

CREATIVE SIENESE
This is a popular, old-fashioned gourmet restaurant where creative Tuscan
cuisine is paired with selections from a notable wine cellar, all served in
historic dining rooms full of character. The seasonal menu includes both
traditional and more sophisticated dishes: from the simpler pappa al

Exploring Siena
The Centro Guide-Associazione Guide Turistiche (% 0577-43273; www.
guidesiena.it) organizes tours of the town’s highlights, which leave
from the tourist office in Piazza del Campo, as well as custom-designed
tours, such as a visit to Siena’s museums. Prices vary according to the
type of tour. For a bus tour from Florence, call American Express
(% 055-50981) or the bus company SITA (% 055-214-721; www.sita-
on-line.it); both offer tours for about 50€ ($60).
Chapter 15: Southern Tuscany and Umbria 269

You can purchase admission tickets in advance through Siena’s 
town office (Comune di Siena, % 0577-41169; Fax: 0577-226265; 
biglietteria.sienastore.com): This way, you’ll avoid the lines and
get a discount of 1€ ($1.20) or 0.50€ (60¢), depending on the attraction.
They’ll send you a confirmation and an account number for a bank trans-
fer; once that has cleared, they will send you a receipt. Pick up your tick-
ets at the attraction’s entrance at the time of your visit.
If you’re planning to see everything in town, the Siena Itinerari d’Arte
(SIA) Pass is the ticket for you: It exists in a winter (Nov 2–Feb 28 for
13€/$16) and summer (Mar 1–Nov 1 for16€/$19) version and is valid for
seven days.
Those who are less ambitious, or have less time, can take advantage of
the Biglietto Cumulativo Musei Comunali, which includes entrance to
Museo Civico, Palazzo delle Papesse, and Santa Maria della Scala for 
10€ ($12) and is valid for two days, or the Biglietto Cumulativo Opera
Duomo, which also costs 10€ ($12), is valid for three days, and includes
admission to the Duomo and Museo dell’Opera, Baptistery, and Oratorio
di San Bernardino with Museum.
The top attractions
The medieval town is an attraction unto itself: Built over three hills, it 
is divided into terza (districts that cover a third of town each). North,
along Via Banchi di Sopra, is the Terza di Camollia; southwest, along Via
di Città, is the Terza di Città (with the Duomo); and southeast, along Via
del Porrione, is the Terza di San Martino. The three terza meet at Piazza
del Campo.
Baptistery of San Giovanni
Built in the 14th century, its unfinished Gothic facade is by Domenico di
Agostino; inside, it is a succession of lavish frescoes, most of which depict
the lives of Christ and St. Anthony and were painted in the 15th century.
At the center of it all is the baptismal font, a splendid masterpiece of monu-
mental proportions made of six bronze panels depicting scenes of the life
of St. John the Baptist, divided by figurines representing the virtues, each
carved by one of the best artists of the time. The Feast of Herod and the fig-
urines of Faith and Hope are by Donatello; Lorenzo Ghiberti carved the
Baptism of Christ and the Arrest of the Baptist; Giovanni di Turino did the
Preaching of the Baptist and, with Turino di Sano, the Birth of the Baptist.
Crowning the font is the marble ciborium with the statue of St. John the
Baptist carved by Jacopo della Quercia. The angels are by Donatello and
Giovanni di Turino.

Duomo and Piccolomini Library
Some consider this Romanesque-Gothic cathedral the most beautiful in
Italy: Decorated with contrasting colored marble both inside and out, it
was built during the first half of the 13th century in Romanesque and
Gothic styles. It contains many works of art, including a superb 13th-cen-
tury pulpit carved by Nicola Pisano — the artist who crafted the magnifi-
cent pulpit in Pisa’s Baptistery and the father of Giovanni Pisano (who
carved the pulpit in Pisa’s Duomo). The cathedral pavement is another
work of art upon which many famous artists of the time worked.
Unfortunately, in order to protect it, it is visible only between August 23
and October 27, in honor of the Palio. Another masterpiece inside the
Duomo is the Piccolomini Library, built by Cardinal Francesco
Piccolomini (later Pius III) to honor his uncle, Pope Pius II. The library was
beautifully frescoed by Pinturicchio with scenes from the life of the pope
and contains the Three Graces, an exquisite Roman sculpture of the third
century B.C. designed after a Greek model.
See map p. 266. Piazza del Duomo. % 0577-283048. www.operaduomo.siena.it.
Admission: 3€ ($3.60); during the exposure of the floor 6€ ($7.20). Open: Mar 1–May

Museo Civico and Torre del Mangia
The Museo Civico is housed in the beautiful 13th-century Palazzo Pubblico,
the seat of the government in Siena’s republican period and today its town
hall. Its richly frescoed rooms host some of Siena’s important artwork. On
the second floor, the loggia is the showcase for the eroded panels from the
masterpiece fountain that decorated Piazza del Campo — the 14th-century
Fonte Gaia was carved by Jacopo della Quercia and replaced by a replica in
the 19th century. In the Sala del Mappamondo (Globe Room), just off the
chapel, are two important pieces by 14th-century Sienese painter Simone
Martini: the Maestà and the magnificent fresco of Guidoriccio da Fogliano,
captain of the Sienese army (though there’s been debate about the attribu-
tion of the latter work to Martini). In the Sala della Pace (Peace Room) —
the meeting room of the Council of Nine that governed Siena — is a famous
series of frescoes by another 14th-century Sienese painter, Ambrogio
Lorenzetti: the secular medieval Allegory of the Good and Bad Government
and Its Effects on the City and the Countryside. From the palazzo’s 14th-cen-
tury Torre del Mangia — accessible from the courtyard — is a breathtak-
ing view of the town and the surrounding hills (if you’re up to climbing the
503 steps, that is). At 100m (335 ft.), the Torre del Mangia is the second-
tallest medieval tower in Italy (the tower in Cremona is taller).

Museo dell’Opera del Duomo
This museum occupies a part of the originally projected Duomo, which
was never built. The ambitious plan was to create a cathedral of such huge
proportions that the current Duomo would have been just the transept,
but it never happened because of engineering problems and the plague of
1348. Today, the space has been turned into a museum; the gallery con-
tains all the original artwork that was removed from the Duomo for safe-
keeping and to prevent further decay, such as the splendid statues that
Giovanni Pisano carved for the facade. The rich collection also includes a
number of painting masterpieces, such as Duccio di Buoninsegna’s
Maestà, depicting the Virgin Mary, and Pietro Lorenzetti’s beautiful trip-
tych the Birth of the Virgin.

Palio delle Contrade
Piazza del Campo
We love coming to Siena for these famous events that have been lighting
the locals afire with passion since at least the Middle Ages (the origin of
the Palio is uncertain and could even go back to the Etruscans, but the
first written document mentioning the race is from 1238). Far from just a
The Palio day by day
The Palio is organized by the town government and strictly regulated. Only 10 of the
17 contrade (town neighborhoods) participate in each of the two races: the seven that
didn’t run the previous year in the same race plus three that are drawn from the
remaining ten. The drawing, which takes place at least 20 days before each race, 
signals the beginning of the competition, but the official opening of the festivities
occurs three days before the race and is marked by the ceremony of the drawing of
the horse — when each of the ten chosen animals is assigned to a contrada — and
the first of six trial runs on Piazza del Campo; other trial runs take place during each
of the three days before the Palio. At 3 p.m. on the day of the Palio, each horse is
blessed in the church of its contrada, and then is led to join the historic cortege. After
the cortege has assembled, it tours the town before convening with the other horses
in Piazza del Campo around 5 p.m. for the race. The alignment of the horses for the start
is also decided by a drawing, and the last horse starts on the run from the back: When
he moves the rope at the front, it is hastily lowered and the race begins. After the race,
the colors of the winning contrada are brought triumphantly around town in a lively
parade. The winning contrada will celebrate all night — and indeed until the next year.
The victory dinner for the whole contrada — with thousands of participants — takes
place around the end of September.

tourist attraction, the Palio is a deeply felt and hotly contested competi-
tion among the city’s 17 districts (contrade) — trust us, the Super Bowl
doesn’t incite as much passion as this medieval-style derby. This is the
world’s most difficult horse race, run bareback on Piazza del Campo,
which is temporarily filled with dirt for the occasion. The horses run
around the square three times while riders hit the horses — and each
other — with a short whip. It’s a horse race: The horse that arrives first
wins, even if it has thrown his rider! Before the 17th century, the Palio was
run in the streets, a bit in the style of the Monte Carlo car race, making it
even more dangerous and brutal — even today, injuries aren’t uncommon.
The two Palio competitions are run in July and August; all the races 
are breathtaking, but we also love the colorful parades of medieval 
costumes — each contrada has its own colors — that take place on the
side, and particularly the flag juggling, a difficult and skillful art which has
been passed on since time immemorial. The pageantry shows are com-
petitive as well, and at the end of the Palio, the contrada with the best
behavior, costumes, and skills wins the Masgalano, traditionally a silver
bowl weighing at least 1 kilogram (21⁄4 pounds) and decorated with Palio
scenes, though it could be a different work of art.
If you want to attend the Palio, you don’t need to buy expensive tickets,
unless you really want to see the horse racing up close. Standing in the
center of the square is free — and a lot of fun. Note, though, that if you do
seat yourself in the middle, you won’t be able to get out until the race is
over. Wherever you sit, bring lots of refreshments and a hat, as the sun gets
very strong, and get there early, as the square quickly fills to capacity.
Piazza del Campo. www.comune.siena.it. Tickets for a seat in the grandstands
or at a window of one of the buildings surrounding the piazza are controlled by the
building owners and the shops in front of which the stands are set up. Palio Viaggi
(Piazza La Lizza 12; % 0577-280828; Fax: 0577-289114) can help you score a seat.
Seats can cost anywhere from 200€ to over 1,000€ ($240 to over $1,200) and need
to be reserved as far as 6 months in advance. Final races: July 2 and Aug 16. Trials
start June 29 and Aug 13.
Pinacoteca Nazionale
This picture gallery, housed in the 15th-century Palazzo Buonsignori, con-
tains an expansive collection of art showing the unique Sienese
Renaissance style, which retained Greek and Byzantine influences long
after realism came into play elsewhere (notably Florence), and also empha-
sized rich coloration. It includes works from the 12th century to the first
half of the 17th century. Guido da Siena, an early developer of the Sienese
school, is well represented, along with the more famous Duccio di
Buoninsegna, the real founder of the style; his painting of the Virgin is a
marvel of delicacy and pathos. Also represented is Giovanni di Paolo —
don’t miss his beautiful little painting of the Virgin.

Santa Maria della Scala
Housed in the former Hospital of Siena, this huge complex of buildings has
been recently opened to the public. Many of its rooms were lavishly deco-
rated with frescoes during the Renaissance and later periods, and almost
all the great Sienese artists worked for the hospital at one time or another.
One of the most surprising rooms is the Pellegrinaio, which held hospital
beds until only a few years ago. Built in the 14th century, it saw its origi-
nal wooden ceiling replaced in the 15th century by a beautiful vaulted ceil-
ing decorated with frescoes narrating the history of the hospital — note
that the last vault by the window was added in the 16th century. The
Cappella del Sacro Chiodo — or Sagrestia Vecchia (Old Sacristy) — was
also built in 1444, to hold the relics and reliquaries bought by the Spedale
from the imperial palace of Byzantium. It was frescoed by Lorenzo
Vecchietta with a cycle on the New and Old Testaments. The chapel also
holds the famous fresco by Domenico di Bartolo, Madonna della
Misericordia, painted in 1444 in the Cappella del Manto, but moved to its
present location in 1610.
See map p. 266. Piazza Duomo 2. % 0577-224828. www.santamaria.comune.

Nov 1–Dec 24 and Jan 7–Mar 15 10:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m., Dec 25–Jan 6 10 a.m.–6 p.m.,
Mar 16–Oct 31 10:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m. Ticket booth closes 30 minutes earlier.
More cool things to see and do
 For a wonderful outing, we highly recommend a ride on the Treno
Natura (Ferrovia della Val d’Orcia; % 0577-207413; www.ferrovie
turistiche.it) — and not only for families. When the local train
line closed a few years ago, a group of volunteers, in cooperation
with the Italian Railroads Company, decided that it was too bad 
to let this scenic ride go to waste. They restored some antique
engines and carriages and reopened the line. It’s a hit, and kids love
it, too. Antique carriages trailed by a diesel engine run on Sundays
at 8:30 a.m., 11:15 a.m., and 3:45 p.m., but there are a number of
special steam-engine tours that are scheduled only on special dates
and require advance reservations. Diesel-engine runs cost 15€
($18), steam-engine runs cost 25€ ($30), and children under 10 ride
for free. Reservations are required; call the APT tourist office in
Siena (% 0577-280551).
 If you have some room left in your head for more Renaissance
paintings, the Oratorio di San Bernardino and Museo Diocesano
di Arte Sacra (Piazza San Francesco 10; % 0577-283048; www.
operaduomo.siena.it) is worth a visit. San Bernardino’s lower
chapel was frescoed by the best Sienese painters of the 17th cen-
tury, while the upper one is a beautiful example of the Italian
Renaissance. Next door, the museum holds works collected from
churches and convents in the area. Admission is 3€ ($3.60). Open:
March through October, daily from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 3 to
5:30 p.m.

Area Code
The local area code is 0577 (see
“Telephone” in the “Fast Facts” section 
of Appendix A for more on calling to and
from Italy).
ATMs
Exchange offices and banks with ATMs can
be found on Via di Città and by the pedes-
trian underpass La Lizza.
 You may want to visit the Home-Sanctuary of Saint Caterina (Via
Costa di Sant’Antonio 6; % 0577-288175; www.caterinati.org),
the Sienese saint’s house and the sanctuary (which includes sev-
eral works of art) that was built around it in 1464, when she was
sanctified. Caterina Benincasa was born here in 1347, the daughter
of a fabric dyer and launderer and one of 26 children (!); she fought
for peace and for the papacy to come back to Rome from its exile in
Avignon — at a time when women had little say in political ques-
tions. Admission is free; the site is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.
 Siena is a town with a lively cultural life, much of which is centered
on sampling the wonderful local wine in one of the many enoteche —
wine shops that turn into wine bars at night. The best of all is the
Enoteca Italica Permanente (Fortezza Medicea, Via Camollia 72; 
% 0577-288811; www.enoteca-italiana.it; Open: Mon noon to 
8 p.m., Tues–Sat noon to 1 a.m.), housed in the cellars of a 16th-
century fortress. It’s actually an official institution, preserving the
best vintages from all over Italy.
Shopping for local treasures
Among the city’s specialties are, of course, the wine and spirits of the
surrounding hills — the Chianti. If you intend to bring some home, 
note that grappa (clear Italian brandy) travels better than wine, which
“bruises” and has to be left to sit for months after being carried on a
plane. One of the best places to buy is the Enoteca San Domenico (Via
del Paradiso 56; % 0577-271181), which offers a good selection of local
wines as well as an assortment of specialty foods. The Antica Drogheria
Manganelli (Via di Città 71–73; % 0577-280002) sells high-quality local
products — including oils, vinegars, and cured meats — and has been
making its own panforte (the typical Sienese honey-and-almond fruit-
cake) since 1879.
Local products include embroidery and fine fabrics. You can find a variety
of hand-embroidered goods at Siena Ricama (Via di Città 61; % 0577-
288339), where you can also place an order for custom-made items 
fashioned after Renaissance patterns. Antiche Dimore (Via di Città 115; 
% 0577-45337) carries beautiful fabric, both sold by the yard and made
into embroidered linens for the home. Also interesting is Ceramiche Santa
Caterina (Via di Città 51, 74, and 76; % 0577-283098), the showroom of
local master ceramicist Marcello Neri.

Perugia
The capital of Umbria, this splendid town is renowned for its art, stretch-
ing from Etruscan to modern times; its universities (including a popular
university for foreigners); and its chocolate! It’s the home of the choco-
late house of Perugina, which makes the delicious Baci.
You can visit its major attractions in a day, but we recommend you stay
the night to partake of the lively local culture, atmosphere, and excellent
cuisine.
Getting there
Perugia is connected by train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) with all
major destinations, although you sometimes have to change in Foligno
or Terontola. Rome is only 21⁄4 hours away; the ticket will cost about 
17€ ($20). Florence is 2 hours away, a ride that costs about 8€ ($9.60).
Perugia’s train station, on Piazza Vittorio Veneto (% 075-5006865), is
about 10 minutes by taxi or 15 minutes by bus to Piazza Italia, in the
town center.

If you have a car, Perugia is on the E45, an easy 180km (115 miles) from
Rome and 150km (94 miles) from Florence. From the A1 highway, take the
exit TERNI if you’re coming from Rome or the exit VAL DI CHIANA BETTOLLE-
SINALUNGA from Florence. The center of the historic town is at the top of a
steep hill and is restricted to traffic. You’ll have to leave your car in one
of the numerous parking lots — a convenient one is Piazza Partigiani’s
underground lot, just south of the historic center. All parking lots are
linked to the center by elevators or escalators.
Spending the night
Castello dell’Oscano
$$
Localita Cenerente
Seven kilometers (41⁄3 miles) from the center of Perugia, this is a fantastic
place to stay in full luxury. It’s a real castle — crenellated towers and all —
that’s been beautifully restored, right down to the frescoed ceilings and
terra-cotta floors. The rooms are large and nicely appointed. The castle
has a lovely garden and a big pool; the Turandot is a popular gourmet
restaurant. There are also rooms in a villa on the property — Villa Ada —
but these are a lot more ordinary.

Hotel Brufani Palace

Piazza Italia
This is the best hotel in Perugia, providing luxury accommodations right
in the heart of town. You’ll tread in the steps of the rich and famous, as
this has been the choice hotel for the visiting aristocracy since its open-
ing in 1884. Guest rooms have been updated since then, however, and now
offer all kinds of amenities such as Wi-Fi; they are spacious and elegantly
furnished in classic style. Some have delightful views over Perugia’s
rooftops.

rooms (Suite 55, which is richly decorated with frescoes). Accommodations
vary in size and furnishings, but all are well kept. The hotel’s restaurant is
popular for its reliable rendition of local cuisine.

Corso Vannucci
Locanda della Posta, right on the busiest (pedestrian) street in the heart of
town, is an excellent value. Its traditions date back to the 18th century —
Goethe stayed here, as did Frederick II of Prussia — when this delightful
palazzo of a marquis eventually became the first and only lodging in town.
Today, the hotel offers guest rooms that vary in size and décor — some lux-
urious with gilded moldings and fine details, others plainer but full of charm.
Bathrooms are modern and nicely decorated with hand-painted tiles.

Dining locally
A university town, Perugia has a lot of pizzerie and cheap trattorie where
you can have a bite in a lively, casual atmosphere, as well as some really
nice gourmet restaurants. The food is typically Umbrian (see Chapter 2
for more on this cuisine) and relies heavily on tartufi (truffles) and porcini
mushrooms. Consider also La Rosetta, in the hotel by the same name
(see earlier in this chapter).
Il Falchetto
$$$
UMBRIAN
With a real medieval atmosphere (one dining room is from the 14th cen-
tury) and a traditional menu, Falchetto is an excellent place for discover-
ing Umbrian cuisine — especially if you’re in the mood to splurge. The
homemade fettuccine is exceptional, and the meat dishes are all excellent:
Try the hare with olives or the torello alla Perugina (beef with homemade
game pâté). The terrace is particularly in demand during the summer
Umbria Jazz Festival.

Exploring Perugia
The Perugia Città Museo card (% 800-697616 in Italy; www.comune.
perugia.it) is just the ticket if you’re visiting more than one museum
or monument in Perugia: It comes in a one-day version for 7€ ($8.40); a
three-day version for 12€ ($14); and a family or group version for 35€
($42) that’s valid for one year and gives access to a maximum of four
people. You can purchase the card at any of the sites and avoid lines
thereafter.
The Museum Pass is a combination ticket to Collegio del Cambio and
Collegio della Mercanzia; it costs 3.10€ ($3.70).
The top attractions
Collegio del Cambio
On the Palazzo dei Priori’s ground floor (see later in this section), this was
the town’s Goods Exchange in Renaissance times. The interesting archi-
tecture of the three halls is enlivened by magnificent frescoed ceilings:
Those of the Sala dell’Udienza (Audience Hall) are by Perugino and his
assistants — one of whom was Raphael — and illustrate the life of Christ;
there’s also a self-portrait of Perugino himself. The splendid wooden carv-
ings of the Legist Chamber are by Giampiero Zuccari; the adjacent Chapel
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
280

of Saint John the Baptist is frescoed by Giannicola di Paolo, a pupil of
Perugino. Half an hour will suffice for your visit.
See map p. 279. Corso Vannucci 25. % 075-5728599. Admission: 2.60€ ($3.10). Open:
Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–12:30 p.m. and 2:30–5:30 p.m.; Sun and holidays 9 a.m.–1 p.m.
Collegio della Mercanzia
This was the medieval Merchants’ Guild; it is a small attraction that you
can visit in just 15 minutes, but it’s definitely worth the time. As you enter,
you’ll find yourself in the 13th-century Audience Hall, decorated with intri-
cately carved wood paneling and beautiful vaulted ceilings. Look around
to admire all the wonderful details.
See map p. 279. Corso Vannucci 15. % 075-5730366. Admission: 1€ ($1.20). Open:

2 p.m., Wed and Sat 8 a.m.–4:30 p.m., Sun 9 a.m.–1 p.m.
Duomo (Cathedral of San Lorenzo) and cloisters
Opening onto the beautiful Piazza IV Novembre, this church presents a
simple, unfinished facade. Begun in the tenth century, the church was con-
secrated only in 1569; the Gothic interior was decorated in the 18th cen-
tury and holds some earlier art, including a beautiful 15th-century carved
wooden choir, miraculously preserved with only minimal damage from a
fire that developed in the Duomo in 1985. From the elegant cloisters, you
can access the Museo Capitolare, which has an important collection of
illuminated manuscripts and 15th-century art, including the famous
Madonna Enthroned by Luca Signorelli (a pupil of Piero della Francesca).
Allow about 45 minutes for your visit.

Chapter 15: Southern Tuscany and Umbria 281
A bit of history
Etruscan in origin, Perugia developed as an important urban center during the Middle
Ages. Further expanding during the Renaissance, the city-state became infamous for
its fierce battles and attempts at maintaining its independence, particularly from the
Roman Church State. The town was finally subjugated by the popes in 1540, who
imposed a few hundred years of steady rule, building the Rocca Paolina fortress.
Perugia was also the hometown of painter Pietro Vannucci, who brought fame to him-
self and his town under the name “Il Perugino.”

National Gallery of Umbria
Housed on the third floor of Palazzo dei Priori (see later in this section),
this gallery holds a splendid and rich collection of Umbrian art stretching
from the 13th to the 19th centuries. In our opinion the most enjoyable of
all Italian museums, it is strong in late-medieval/early-Renaissance art, 
documenting the important phase during which Giotto and Cimabue 
revolutionized painting techniques. The treasures are too numerous to list
here: five unique 13th-century sculptures by Arnolfo di Cambio, several
paintings by Perugino, a Madonna and Child by Gentile da Fabriano, the
Polyptych of San Dominico masterpiece of Beato Angelico, the famous (and
stunning) Piero della Francesca Polyptych of Sant’Antonio, and much
more. Set aside about two hours for your visit.
See map p. 279. Palazzo dei Priori, Corso Vannucci 19. % 075-5721009. www.
gallerianazionaleumbria.it. Admission: 6.50€ ($7.80). Open: Tues–Sun 
8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
Oratorio di San Bernardino
Built in 1452 and designed by Agostino di Duccio, this shrine is a delight-
ful Renaissance masterpiece. The facade is a delicate carving of multicol-
ored marble, with intricate reliefs illustrating the life of the saint. A
paleo-Christian sarcophagus (fourth century) was recycled as the altar.
Allow 30 to 45 minutes for your visit.
See map p. 279. Piazza San Francesco al Prato, at the end of Via dei Priori. Admission:
Free. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–12:30 p.m. and 3–6 p.m.
Palazzo dei Priori and Fontana Maggiore
This is one of the finest examples of Gothic architecture in Italy, a striking
travertine building with white-and-red marble inlays. Built between 1298
and 1353, this palazzo was created as the seat of the government. The
main portal — accessible by a wide semicircular staircase — is off-center
in the facade; it leads to the spacious Hall of the Notables (Sala dei
Notari), a Romanesque architectural marvel supported by 12 arches. The
two bronzes over the door represent a griffin and a lion, the symbols of
Perugia. You can visit the palazzo’s many frescoed rooms, some of which
house the National Gallery of Umbria (see earlier in this section).
The building opens onto the elegant Piazza IV Novembre; once a Roman
reservoir, it is graced by the splendid Fontana Maggiore, a Gothic master-
piece carved by the famous Pisan sculptors Nicola and Giovanni Pisano.
Carved from white and pink marble, it has been called the most beautiful
fountain in the world. Its 24 sides bear allegorical panels representing each
month of the year and the signs of the zodiac; the elegant carvings are now
visible after a difficult restoration that lasted several years. Departing from
the piazza is a typical medieval street, Via Maestà delle Volte, a uniquely
atmospheric vaulted covered passage. Consider a couple of hours to take
it all in.
See map p. 279. Piazza IV Novembre. % 075-5772339. Admission: Free. Open:
Summer daily 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–7 p.m.; winter Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–7 p.m.

More cool things to see and do
 The Rocca Paolina (Piazza Italia and Via Masi; % 075-5725778;
Admission: free; Daily 8 a.m.–7 p.m.) was a grandiose fortress
designed by the famous architect Antonio da Sangallo the Younger,
and built in 1540 by Pope Paul III (hence the name) on top of
medieval and earlier structures. (You can still see an arch from the
original Etruscan city walls, the Porta Marzia from the second cen-
tury B.C.). The upper part of the Rocca was demolished in 1860, but
the lower sections were preserved, and the archaeological site has
now been excavated. By a series of escalators, you can see the
inside, viewing the fortification’s huge walls, parts of dwellings and
ancient streets, and even fragments of the ancient stadium where a
forerunner of soccer was played. Free guided tours — occasionally
offered in English — bring it all to life; reservations are required.
 The imposing complex of the church and convent of San Domenico
was begun in the 13th century and progressively enlarged over 
the following two centuries. In the 18th century, the monastery 
was turned into an archaeology museum — now the National
Archaeological Museum of Umbria (Piazza Giordano Bruno 10; 
% 075-5727141; www.archeopg.arti.beniculturali.it;
Admission: 4€/$4.80; Open: Mon 2:30–7:30 p.m.; Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–
7:30 p.m.; Closed: Jan 1 and Dec 25). Its findings include a travertine
stone with the longest inscription in the Etruscan language ever
found. The Etruscan-Roman section also includes jewelry, funerary
urns, statues, and other objects. The visit will take you about an hour.
 Chosen as the seat of the Eurochocolate fair in October, Perugia 
is famous for its chocolate manufacturers. King of all is Perugina,
the creator of world-famous Baci (“kisses”) — the hazelnut-and-
chocolate bonbons wrapped in silver-and-blue foil. You can take a
free tour at the Perugina Factory Museum (San Sisto, 6km/3 miles
west of the city center; % 075-52761, or % 075-5276796 for reser-
vations; www.perugina.it; Admission: free; Open: Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–
1 p.m. and 2–5:30 p.m., Mar–Sept also Sat). In town, you can buy
some of the most delicious chocolates at Talmone (Via Maestà
delle Volte 10; % 075-5725744).
 Perugia is positively afire during the world-famous Umbria Jazz
Festival (% 075-5721003 or 800-462311 in Italy; www.umbriajazz.
com). The concerts, featuring some of the best international names,
take place during two weeks in July. You’ll need to make reserva-
tions well in advance for the most popular performances. You can
even participate in special jazz clinics organized during the event.
 Come dusk, all Perugia meets along Corso Vannucci for a stroll, a
gelato, an aperitivo, and later for a visit to one of the osterie and
clubs dotting the narrow alleys nearby. One of the most popular 
is the Zibaldone (Via Cesare Battisti 4; % 075-5735567; www.
zibaldone.org), with several rooms including a cocktail bar, a
restaurant, and even a small Liberty-style theater featuring live
music, from chamber to jazz. The club opens at 7 p.m.

Assisi
The hometown of St. Francis, Assisi is famous around the world for its
art and religious monuments. Many of its visitors are actually pilgrims
who come to honor the humble man who was said to speak to animals
and who created the Franciscan order. Indeed, visiting Assisi is some-
what of a mystical experience. The small town is remarkably beautiful,
built in pink stone on the top of a steep hill, and sparklingly clean now
that all has been restored after the severe damage of the 1997 earth-
quake (at press time, the repaving of the side streets was nearing com-
pletion). Luckily, the town’s monuments and most of its masterpieces
were spared, although some of the frescoes were irreplaceably lost.
Assisi is only a small town of about 3,000 souls, though millions flock
here every year. You can easily visit it on a day trip from Florence or
Rome, but if you have the time to stay overnight, you will not regret it.

Getting there
Taking a bus is the easiest way to get to Assisi: The bus station is in
Piazza Matteotti, only steps from the Duomo and the center of town.
APM (% 800-512141 or 075-506781; www.apmperugia.it) runs regular
service from Perugia (Piazza Partigiani) for 2.80€ ($3.40); Sulga (% 800-
099661 or 075-5009641; www.sulga.it) operates buses from Rome (a 
3-hour trip) and Florence (a 21⁄2-hour trip) for about 18€ ($22) round-trip.
Having your own car will allow you to visit the attractions outside town
without having to walk or use the shuttle bus, but since Assisi is mostly
closed to traffic (you can drive through some of the streets, but not park
there), you’ll have to leave your car in one of the two parking lots at
either end of town (about 11€/$13 per day; open 7 a.m.–9 p.m.). Note
that these lots fill quickly with cars and tourist buses; in high season,
you may have to park all the way back in Santa Maria degli Angeli — a
village 6km (33⁄4 miles) from Assisi — and take a shuttle bus. Assisi is
only 27km (17 miles) from Perugia on SS3; from either Florence or Rome,
pass through Perugia (see directions earlier in this chapter) and then
follow the Assisi signs, which are very well marked.
The nearest train station to Assisi is in Santa Maria degli Angeli, well
connected to Assisi by taxis and a shuttle bus that departs every half-
hour. Train service (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) is frequent from
all major destinations. It’s a direct 25-minute trip from Perugia or Spoleto,
though you may need to change trains if you’re coming from Rome or
Florence; the trip takes less than 3 hours from either destination and
costs about 13€ ($16).
Spending the night
It used to be that if you wanted a modern room, you had to stay in the
new but charmless hotels of Santa Maria degli Angeli. While that remains
a good option — since many hotels in Assisi are still cheap accommoda-
tions catering to bus tours of pilgrims — you can now find more than a
few comfortable choices right in town. Book early if you’re planning to
come for the Feast of St. Francis (Oct 3–4) or the Calendimaggio (first
weekend after May 1).
Fontebella Hotel
$$
Piazza San Francesco/Piazza del Comune
Located midway between Assisi’s major attractions, this is a great new
hotel — family run with efficiency and modern spirit. Housed in a historic
building, it offers pleasant public spaces with red marble floors and arched
ceilings, along with spacious guest rooms of all different configurations.
There are even a few rooms with a loft, good for families. Bathrooms are
modern and generally good-sized (some with tubs and others with show-
ers), but a couple are tiny. Most rooms have grand views, as does the
romantic Il Frantoio, the highly recommended restaurant here (daily noon
to 2:15 p.m. and 7–9:15 p.m.).

Hotel Subasio
$$
Piazza San Francesco
For a long time, this was the only good hotel in Assisi, and it remains the
best for the exceptional service, elegance, and unique location: It is housed
in a 16th-century palazzo practically attached to St. Francis Basilica. The
grand public spaces include terraces and a windowed restaurant/break-
fast room with a garden terrace offering excellent views. Guest rooms vary
in size, but all are tastefully and individually decorated — some with a few
antiques — and all have renovated bathrooms. Rooms overlooking the ter-
races have absolutely breathtaking views, and some have their own bal-
conies. In high season, the hotel’s excellent restaurant is open daily from
7 to 9:30 p.m., plus weekends from noon to 2:30 p.m.

Hotel Umbra
$
Piazza del Comune
As you enter this charming, family-run hotel, you’ll feel miles away from
the busy main street. Its historic palazzo is graced with a private walled
garden that is a delight to look at (only part of it is accessible to guests).
The welcoming rooms are uniquely decorated and configured; some have
Deruta tiles on the floors, others have carpeting, and all have a view (and
sometimes a balcony) — either of the garden or of the surrounding hills.
Bathrooms are all new and good-sized, though some have only smallish
showers. The Umbra’s restaurant is particularly good; it’s popular with
locals as well as visitors, especially in summer when a few tables are put
in the garden (open Mon–Sat 7:15–9:30 p.m.).

Exploring Assisi
The Franciscan order in town gives tours of the major Franciscan sites 
in Assisi (also in English), including parts of the St. Francis Basilica and
of the Eremo delle Carceri; you can sign up at the office just outside 
the entrance to the lower basilica on the left, in Piazza Inferiore di San
Francesco (% 075-8190084; Fax: 075-8155208; www.sanfrancesco
assisi.org). Tours last about an hour and take place Monday through
Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon and 2 to 5:30 p.m. (winter to 4:30 p.m.).
They’re free, but make a donation since the order exists only on alms.
If you’d like a more complete tour, contact the Tourist Guide Association,
at Via Dono Doni 18b (% 075-815228; Fax: 075-815229; www.assoguide.
it), or the Guides Cooperative at the Infotourist Point in Perugia (Piazza
Partigiani 3b; % 075-5757; Fax: 075-5727235; www.guideinumbria.com).
You can buy a combination ticket for the Rocca and the Roman Forum
Museum (and one other attraction) for €4.50 ($5.40), valid for seven
days.

Some of Assisi’s streets are quite steep: Wear good shoes and be pre-
pared to use the shuttle bus or a taxi if you cannot walk long distances
or if you get tired easily.
The top attractions
Basilica di San Francesco
Begun in 1228 to house the bones of St. Francis, the basilica is actually two
churches, one on top of the other, and a truly majestic sight. You access
the Lower Basilica from a splendid Gothic portal and enter the main nave
with the first cycle of frescoes on Francis’s life; off the sides open several
chapels, among them the Cappella della Maddalena (third on the right),
frescoed by Giotto and his helpers. You’ll find more of his work in the apse
and the right transept. The left transept is all decorated by the Sienese
master Pietro Lorenzetti, including his beautiful Crucifixion and Deposition.
A set of stairs descends to the crypt, where St. Francis’s coffin is exposed
ever since being rediscovered in the 19th century. The Upper Basilica con-
tains Cimabue’s work, including his dramatic Crucifixion in the left
transept, and Giotto’s celebrated cycle of frescoes on the life of the saint
in the main nave (now believed to have been painted by several artists),
including St. Francis Preaching to the Birds. The 1997 earthquake endan-
gered the very structure of the church and monastery, and destroyed
some frescoes beyond repair (in the Upper Basilica), but through the gen-
erosity of donors all over the world, the ambitious schedule of repairs was
completed in time for the Papal Jubilee in 2000. Most of the damaged fres-
coes were reassembled from the immense puzzles of thousands of pieces
(pretty amazing, given that one fresco was in 50,000 pieces).
Chapter 15: Southern Tuscany and Umbria 289
St. Francis and St. Clare
San Francesco was born in 1182 to a wealthy merchant family and died in 1226 in a
simple hut. How he traversed the social scale and caused a revolution in Christianity
is a remarkable story. In 1209, after a reckless youth and even imprisonment, Francis
experienced visions that led him to sell his father’s cloth and give away the proceeds.
He tried to follow the Bible literally and live the life of Christ, publicly renouncing 
his inheritance and rejecting wealth absolutely (this didn’t endear him to the rich
medieval church hierarchy). Two years before his death, he received the stigmata on
a mountaintop — this and other scenes from his life were popular subjects for painters
of the late medieval period and the Renaissance. Santa Chiara was his mystic sister
who followed his teachings. Canonized in 1255, she was the founder of the order of
the Poor Clares, with strict rules of simplicity similar to the Franciscan order. Chiara
left her family to follow St. Francis, abandoning wealth and worldly pretensions as he
did and cutting off her hair to symbolize her renunciation of the world. A number of
miracles are attributed to her, one of which, a vision, led to her being proclaimed the
patron saint of TV (saints don’t get asked whether they want these honors).

% 075-819001. www.sanfrancescoassisi.org. Admission: By donation. Open:
Lower Basilica daily 6 a.m.–6 p.m.; Upper Basilica daily 8:30 a.m.–6 p.m.; during day-
light saving time, both close at 6:45 p.m.
Basilica di Santa Chiara
Simple, powerful, and full of grace, this basilica is a beautiful building in
alternating stripes of pink and white stone, with a huge rose window on its
facade. Inside, it is divided in two: To the right is the Chapel of the Crucifix,
with the crucifix that miraculously spoke to St. Francis and led him to start
on his difficult path in the face of family, church, and society. To the left is
the main church, with another 14th-century crucifix over the altar. On the
left wall is a gate closing off the Chapel of the Saint Sacrament; you can
still look through it to admire the beautiful stained-glass windows. Stairs
lead to the lower church, built in the 19th century in neo-Gothic style to
honor the remains of the saint. Only some of the church’s original frescoes
remain, but those are beautiful, particularly in the apse of the main nave.

Daily 6:30 a.m. to noon and 2–7 p.m. (winter only to 6 p.m.)
Duomo di San Rufino
Overshadowed by the other attractions in town, this cathedral has a splen-
did Romanesque facade — we highly recommend seeing at least this —
with three portals and delicate carvings and decorations. The interior was
redone in the 16th century and is richly decorated with paintings, fres-
coes, and sculptures. In the apse is a magnificent wooden carved choir.
More artwork — mostly detached from the cathedral during the various
renovations — is kept in the museum, while the crypt holds some ancient
Roman and early Christian artifacts. The superb Romanesque bell tower
outside was built over an ancient Roman cistern, which you can visit from
inside the church and museum.
See map p. 287. Piazza San Rufino. % 075-812283. www.assisimuseo

Piazza del Comune
This is the heart of Assisi civil life and a wonderful example of medieval
and ancient Roman architecture (with so much religious art around, few
realize Assisi was a thriving Roman town). The medieval buildings that
surround the piazza were built over the Roman ones (this was the town’s
Forum at Roman times), and you can still see the powerful Corinthian
columns of the Temple of Minerva, from the first century B.C. Probably
the best-preserved Roman temple in Italy after the Pantheon, it was con-
verted into a church by early Christians and eventually given a baroque

7:30 p.m.; Wed 7:15 a.m.–2 p.m. and 5:15–7:30 p.m.; Sun 8 a.m.–7:15 p.m.).
Adjoining the temple is the 13th-century tower built by the Ghibellines.
From the nearby Roman Forum Museum (Via Portica 2, off Piazza del
Comune; % 075-813053; www.sistemamuseo.it; Admission: 3.50€/$4.20),
you can access the archaeological excavations under the piazza. The site is
open daily 10 a.m.–1 p.m.; Mar–May and Sept–Oct also 2:30–6 p.m.; Nov–Feb
also 2–5 p.m.; and June–Aug also 2:30–7 p.m.; closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
See map p. 287. Corso Mazzini, Via San Rufino, and Via Portica.
Rocca Maggiore
Rebuilt by Cardinal Albornoz in the 14th century, when the papacy sub-
dued Assisi and brought the area under Vatican rule, this is an impressive
fortress dominating the town. Recently restored — it survived the 1997
quake, only to be damaged by lightning in 2000 — it is well worth the climb
(you can also drive here from outside the town walls) to enjoy the fabulous
views of the walls, the town, and the surrounding valley. The foundations
go back to Etruscan and Roman times, and you can visit the corridors and
main halls inside.
See map p. 287. Via della Rocca, from Via Porta Perlici, off Piazza San Rufino. % 075-
812033. www.sistemamuseo.it. Admission: 2€ ($2.40). Open: Daily Sept–May
10 a.m.–sunset; June–Aug 9 a.m.–sunset; closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
More cool things to see and do
 In nearby Santa Maria degli Angeli (6km/3.5 miles from Assisi), the
Basilica della Porziuncola (% 075-8051430; www.porziuncola.
org; Open: Thurs–Sat and Mon–Tues 9 a.m. to noon and 3–6 p.m.)
is a grandiose structure, built between 1569 and 1679 and graced
by a superb cupola. The basilica was built around the Porziuncola,
the first Franciscan church where Santa Chiara was ordered by San
Francesco in 1211 and where he died in 1226. The church and the
museum have a collection of frescoes and paintings from the 14th
to the 18th centuries. Admission is by voluntary donation.
 If you want to partake of the silence of Mount Subasio and visit the
hermitage where St. Francis retired to meditate and pray, we rec-
ommend the pleasant walk (4km/21⁄2 miles east of Assisi, out from
Porta Cappuccini) to the Eremo delle Carceri (% 075-812301;
www.assisiofm.org). Several of his miracles occurred here, and
you can still see the sites — such as the ancient tree believed to be
the one where he preached his sermon to the birds and the dried-
out stream he quieted because its noise was interrupting his
prayers. Even if you are not a believer, the walk in the selva (free
admission; open June–Aug 9:30–12:30 and 3:30–6:30) is uplifting.
Alternatively, you can choose to go for a stroll or a hike on the
marked trails in the park. You can also reach the Eremo by taxi or
minibus. Admission to the Eremo is by donation; it’s open daily 
6:30 a.m.–6 p.m. (during daylight saving time, closes at 7:15 p.m.).
Access to the park is free.
Chapter 15: Southern Tuscany and Umbria 291

Spoleto
This is one of the most picturesque towns in Umbria, built in the shadow
of an imposing fortress. The town was founded by the local population
of the Umbri in pre-Roman times; during the Roman period, Spoleto
valiantly resisted the advances of Hannibal and later became a summer
resort for wealthy Romans. Devastated by the black plague and an earth-
quake in the Middle Ages, Spoleto remained a coveted prize fought over
by Perugia and the papacy. Today, this jewel set among the Umbrian
hills is known the world over as a town of music and culture.
Spoleto is surrounded by the countryside that has made Umbria famous:
olive groves, green hills, and beautiful mountains. Small enough to be
visited as a day trip from Rome, Florence, or a neighboring town (four to
five hours will suffice to see the sights), it’s also a wonderful place to
spend some days of leisure, especially during one of its art and music
festivals.

Fast Facts: Assisi

Getting there
Spoleto is well connected by train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) to
all major destinations. There’s direct and frequent service from Assisi
and Perugia, whereas you may need to change trains if you’re coming
from Rome (a 11⁄2-hour trip, about 15€/$18) and Florence (a three-hour
trip, about 19€/$23). Trains arrive at Spoleto’s Stazione FS, on Piazza
Polvani (% 0743-48516), across the river Tessino to the north of the
city’s center. The station is well connected to the town by bus (line A, B,
C, or D).
You can also get here by bus from Perugia. SIT (% 0743-212211) has
two daily runs; the 90-minute trip costs about 7€ ($8.40).
If you’re coming by car, Spoleto lies about 130km (80 miles) from Rome
on the Flaminia (SS3), the scenic but narrow consular road heading
north from Rome. A faster possibility is the A1; you exit at Orte and take
the superstrada for Terni (follow the directions for Terni). The super-
strada merges back into SS3 right after Terni; then just follow the direc-
tions for Spoleto.
Spending the night
Note that hotel reservations for the Spoleto Festival are made as much
as a year in advance, so plan ahead if you’d like to attend.

Named after the architect who built the Rocca Albornoz (see “More cool

did location on the side of the Rocca, a short (uphill) distance from the
center. The well-appointed guest rooms are spacious, all with views and
modern bathrooms.

Il Tartufo
$$
Piazza Garibaldi
UMBRIAN/CREATIVE
Il Tartufo, as its name suggests, specializes in dishes based on truffles, but
its culinary offerings go well beyond that, including homemade bread, deli-
cious grissini (breadsticks), and simple yet uncommonly good pasta dishes
and desserts. This is traditional Umbrian cuisine at its best, with a modern
twist. Try the truffle and cod ravioli or the homemade pasta with broccoli,
lentils, and sausages. We definitely recommend the tasting menus.
See map p. 295. Piazza Garibaldi 24. % 0743-40236. Reservations required. Secondi:
12€–20€ ($14–$24). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Tues–Sun noon to 3 p.m.; Tues–Sat
7:30–10:30 p.m. Closed 2 weeks in Jan/Feb and 10 days in summer.
Pentagramma
$
Teatro Romano
UMBRIAN
Pentagramma specializes in pasta dishes served with a variety of tasty
sauces — we love the ones with truffles or porcini mushrooms, fresh when
in season. In addition, it serves a variety of soups, such as the hearty
zuppa di farro (spelt soup), and a delicious risotto al radicchio.
See map p. 295. Via Martani 4. % 0743-223141. Reservations recommended. Secondi:
10€–15€ ($12–$18). DC, MC, V. Open: Thurs–Tues 12:30–2:30 p.m. and 7:30–10:45 p.m.
Closed Aug and 2 weeks in Jan/Feb.
Exploring Spoleto
The two-week long Festival di Spoleto is immensely popular, but there’s
much more to explore in this picturesque town.
The top attractions
A medieval town built over a Roman one, Spoleto is a uniquely pictur-
esque sight in itself. Strolling its atmospheric — and steep — alleys lined
with palazzi and churches would be enough to fill your visit.
Duomo (Santa Maria Assunta)
This 12th-century Romanesque cathedral has a majestic facade, graced by
a 1207 mosaic by Solsterno depicting Christ in typical Byzantine style.
Because of the position of the church on the slope of the hill, you can get
a spectacular view looking down on the Duomo and its piazza. The bell
tower was pieced together using stone looted from Roman temples. The
church’s interior, refurbished in the 17th century, still has the original
mosaic floor in the central nave. In a niche at the entrance is the bronze
bust of Urban VIII by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Among all the treasures inside,
the most important are in the apse, which was decorated in the 15th cen-
tury with great Filippo Lippi frescoes, including the brooding and power-
ful Morte della Vergine (Death of the Virgin Mary). The final concert of the
Spoleto Festival is held every year in the piazza in front of the Duomo.
Part IV: Florence and the Best of Tuscany and Umbria 
296

See map p. 295. Piazza del Duomo. Admission: Free. Open: Summer daily 8 a.m.–
1 p.m. and 3–6:30 p.m.; winter daily 8 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–5:30 p.m.
Roman Theater and Archaeological Museum
This theater dates back to the first years of the Roman Empire and is one
of numerous vestiges of ancient Roman Spoleto that are still visible. It was
uncovered by a local archaeologist under Piazza della Libertà at the end
of the 19th century and excavated in the 1950s, revealing some well-
preserved structures. The museum has interesting archaeological findings
from the area, including some sculptures and the famous Lex Spoletina (set
of tablets bearing the carved law protecting the sacred wood of Monteluco
nearby). East of the theater is the first-century Arco di Druso (Via Arco di
Druso), once the monumental arched entry to the Forum (now Piazza del
Mercato). The impressive fountain in the piazza is a baroque addition.
See map p. 295. Via Sant’Agata 18, Piazza della Libertà. % 0743-223277. www.
archeopg.arti.beniculturali.it. Admission: 4€ ($4.80). Open: Daily 
8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.
Spoleto Festival
Also known as the Festival dei Due Mondi (Festival of Two Worlds), the
Spoleto Festival was created by Gian Carlo Menotti in 1958 as a way to
bring together the best of “two worlds,” Europe and America. Now a two-
week festival from late June to early July, it attracts major performing-arts
figures from around the world in a variety of disciplines, including theater,
dance, music, and even cinema (Spoletocinema). Performances are held
all over town, but the most important are held outdoors in the Teatro
Romano (Piazza della Libertà; % 0743-223419), the Rocca, and the scenic
Piazza del Duomo; and indoors in the Teatro Nuovo (Via Filetteria 1; 
% 0743-223419) and the Teatro Caio Melisso (Piazza del Duomo; 
% 0743-222209).
Box office: Piazza del Duomo 8, or buy tickets online. % 800-565600 in Italy, or 0743-
220-320. Fax: 0743-220-321. www.spoletofestival.it. Once in Spoleto, you can
also get tickets at the Teatro Nuovo. Tickets: 8€–50€ ($9.20–$60), depending on the
event.
More cool things to see and do
If you have a bit more time and the steep streets have not tired you out,
here are a few more choices.
 If you stroll along Via del Ponte out of town, you’ll rapidly reach the
famous Ponte delle Torri, an impressive bridge and aqueduct over
a deep gorge dating probably from the 13th century. Its ten elegant
arches — 76m (250 ft.) high — are a unique sight.
 Dominating the town, the powerful fortress Rocca Albornoziana
(Piazza Campello 1; % 0743-43707; www.spoletopermusei.it;
Admission 6.50€/$7.80; Open: Sept 15–Nov 1 and Apr 1–June 10

such until 1983! After lengthy restorations, the Rocca is now open
to the public and houses the National Museum of Spoleto —
exhibiting artwork from a number of collections in town — as well
as an exhibition hall and a theater.

century Chiesa di San Pietro is well worth the detour for its
Romanesque facade decorated with splendid bas-reliefs.

Part V
Venice and the Best
of the Pianura
Padana

In this part . . . 
You’ll have heard this before: “Venice isn’t like any other
place.” Well, once you’re here, you’ll see how true this 
is — and how difﬁcult it can be to ﬁnd words to fully describe
this unique destination. Venice, arguably the world’s most
romantic city, is a city of water — beguiling, mesmerizing,
relaxing — where you’ll never hear an automobile (though
the growling diesel motors of boats are never very far away).
The artistic and cultural inﬂuence of Venice has also spread
to the surrounding region of the Pianura Padana, whose
towns offer many splendid sights.
In Chapter 16, we take you through the watery roads and
alleys of Venice and the most interesting of the nearby lagoon
islands. In Chapter 17, we introduce you to the Pianura
Padana’s other three important art cities: Padua and Verona,
with their rich endowment of beauties and treasures, and
Milan, the business and industrial capital of Italy.

Chapter 16

In This Chapter

 Experiencing the sights, smells, and tastes of Venice
 Getting the scoop on the best shopping areas and nightlife attractions
A
s soon as you arrive in Venice, you’ll realize this city goes beyond
all you have imagined or seen. The elegant private palazzi lining
the canals bear witness to a past of tremendous wealth, power, and cul-
ture. It’s truly a magnificent human achievement. And yet people have
been calling Venice a dead city for a century and a half. Henry James
wrote, “She exists only as a battered peep-show and bazaar.” Only 70,000
people actually live in Venice, but if you’re ever alone anywhere for more
than five minutes, consider yourself lucky. The crowds are unbelievable:
Everywhere you go, someone is already there.
And yet . . . Canal Grande after sunset, Piazza San Marco early in the
morning, the Gallerie dell’Accademia, the Lagoon, the Canaletto skies,
and the stillness beneath the hubbub are sights you just have to experi-
ence to understand. And Venice’s famous serenity (the republic was
called La Serenissima, the “serene one”) is as seductive as ever. Cranky
Henry James and many other famous travelers have succumbed to
Venice before you. James conceded that “the only way to care for Venice
as she deserves it is to give her a chance to touch you often — to linger
and remain and return.”
If you could stay a week in Venice, it would be time well spent, but you
can see the highlights in two days.
Getting There
Regardless of how you arrive, remember to pack light: Unless your hotel
has water access, you’ll have to carry your luggage from the closest
waterway to the door of your accommodations.

By air
Small but not too small, Venice’s Aeroporto Marco Polo (% 041-2609260;
www.veniceairport.it), 10km (61⁄4 miles) north of the town center,
receives daily flights from most Italian and other European destinations.
Below are tips for getting through the airport and to your hotel:
 Getting oriented at the airport: The airport is well organized and
very easy to get around, as there’s only one terminal. You will find
an ATM, a currency-exchange counter, and a tourist information
desk in the main concourse of the arrivals area.
 Navigating your way through passport control and Customs: You’ll
probably arrive in Venice via a connecting flight from another Italian
or European airport, which means that you’ve already cleared
Customs in the city where you changed flights. If your connecting
flight originated in a country outside the Schengen European
Community, then you’ll have to line up for passport control before
going to baggage claim. After picking up your checked bags, you’ll
go through Customs. Here you’ll find two gates: one for those who
have something to declare (above the standard allowance), and one
for those who don’t.
 Getting from the airport to your hotel: From the airport, you can
reach the city by either bus or water. Though romantic and conven-
ient, a water taxi (% 041-5415084) will cost a whopping 70€ ($84)
on average for two to four persons. The motoscafo (shuttle boat)
run by Cooperativa San Marco/Alilaguna (% 041-5235775; www.
alilaguna.it) is a cheaper option: It takes about 50 minutes to
Piazza San Marco, with stops at Murano and Lido, and costs 10€
($12) per person. The ATVO shuttle bus (% 041-5205530; www.
atvo.it) is an even cheaper option; it runs every hour to Piazzale
Roma (Venice’s car terminal on the mainland) and costs 3€ ($3.60)
per person. The trip takes about 20 minutes. From there, you can
take a vaporetto (the local water bus, described later in this chap-
ter) or a water taxi to your hotel.
By train
Venice is well connected by rail (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it). The
fastest trains get you to Venice in about 41⁄2 hours from Rome, in just
under 3 hours from Florence, and in 31⁄2 hours from Milan. A one-way
ticket from Rome costs about 40€ ($48), depending on the category of
train you choose.
Venice’s train station is called Santa Lucia; its mainland rail hub is
Mestre. Choose a direct train to Santa Lucia if you want to avoid switch-
ing in Mestre to a local shuttle train for the ten-minute trip to Santa
Lucia. Just outside Santa Lucia rail station, you’ll find the ticket booth
for the vaporetto (water bus, described later in this chapter), as well as
water taxis.
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana 
302

By car
Venice is off autostrada A4; the distance is 530km (327 miles) from Rome,
266km (165 miles) from Milan, and 243km (151 miles) from Florence.
After the exit, take SS11, always following signs for VENEZIA; you’ll pass
over the scenic bridge — Ponte della Libertà — connecting Mestre and
the mainland to Piazzale Roma, Venice’s car terminal. No cars can enter
Venice, so you’ll have to park here. Expect to pay 20€ to 28€ ($24–$34),
depending on the size of your car. The ASM Garage (% 041-2727211;
www.asmvenezia.it) and the Garage San Marco (% 041-5232213;
www.garagesanmarco.it) are convenient to boat stops. A cheaper
alternative is on the island of Tronchetto, just before Piazzale Roma 
to your right, where the COMPARK (% 041-5207555; www.venice
parking.it) costs about 15€ ($18) per day.
Leaving your car on the mainland, in Mestre, may be a better (and
cheaper) idea in high season and on weekends, when monstrous traffic
jams are likely around Piazzale Roma. You can try the parking lot at the
Mestre train station (% 041-938021; www.garagestazione.it), Garage
Serenissima (% 041-938021), or Crivellari (% 041-929225).
By ship
Traditionally, Venice was accessible only by water — the bridge to the
mainland was not built until 1846. You can still get to Venice by ship, and
it is a unique experience indeed to be welcomed by the town. But pleas-
ant as it is, it’s also rare. Although several international lines offer
cruises to Venice — your travel agent can help you sort through the
options — it’s a long way here from most international ports of call, usu-
ally a minimum of a month (most travelers don’t have that kind of time).
If you do come by ship, you’ll arrive at the Marine Terminal (Stazione
Marittima) in Santa Croce, in the heart of Venice. From there, the regular
city transportation is at your disposal.
Orienting Yourself in Venice
The city of Venice comprises three major areas: the historic district, a
cluster of several islands linked by numerous bridges; the Terraferma, a
modern development on the mainland which includes Mestre — where 
a large part of the city’s population actually lives; and the Laguna
(Lagoon), stretching from the Adriatic Sea to the mainland and including
the larger islands of Lido and Murano, among others.
Made up of more than 100 islands linked by 354 bridges over 177 canals,
the historic district can be quite confusing to the uninitiated. It is
divided into sestieri (a sestiere is a sixth of the city), each made up of
several small islands, divided by canals — Venice’s “streets” — crossed
by small bridges. The central canal — Canal Grande — divides the city
with its reversed “S” shape, leaving three sestieri on each side: San
Marco, Cannaregio, and Castello de citra (“this side” of the canal); and
Chapter 16: Venice 303

Dorsoduro, San Polo, and Santa Croce de ultra (“the far side”). This was
the city’s major thoroughfare and is still lined by elegant palazzi, which
belonged to the most important and wealthiest families and merchant
groups. It is crossed by three bridges: the Ponte dell’Accademia
between San Marco and Dorsoduro, the famous Ponte di Rialto between
San Marco and San Polo, and the Ponte degli Scalzi between Santa Lucia
train station and Santa Croce. San Marco is in the center; to the north,
you’ll find first San Polo, then Santa Croce, and finally Cannaregio; to 
the east is Castello, and to the west and south, Dorsoduro. The Santa
Lucia train station, the car terminal in Piazzale Roma, and the Marine
Terminal are to the northwest, each on its own small island connected
to the mainland through Ponte della Libertà.
Introducing the neighborhoods
There’s no “bad neighborhood” in the historic district, and each sestiere
has its individual flavor. But if you’re after a more authentic or romantic
Venice, you’ll have to know where to look.
Cannaregio
This is an authentic neighborhood where locals still live and work; it
gets a bit crowded in the high season only where it borders San Marco
and around Santa Lucia train station. The painter Tintoretto was born
here, near the Madonna dell’Orto church, not far from the Ghetto.
Along Canal Grande, you’ll find the Ca’ d’Oro; on the lagoon side, the
Fondamenta Nuove vaporetto station, where boats depart for the islands
of Murano, Burano, and Torcello. This area is home to no-frills restau-
rants, a bit of nightlife (toward the Canal Grande), and a number of mod-
erately priced hotels.
Castello
This is our favorite sestiere in Venice, as you don’t need to go far to
escape the crowds. Behind the grandiose promenade of Riva degli
Schiavoni (in high season, crawling with tourists), with its unique views
of the bay of San Marco and its expensive hotels and restaurants, you’ll
find the development of an authentic working district. It’s crossed by Via
Garibaldi, one of the few real streets in town (actually a paved-over
canal), lined with neighborhood shops, osterie, and an outdoor market.
You’ll also find the Basilica dei Santi Giovanni e Paolo and the Arsenale
(Naval Armory). Farther to the east are the Giardini Pubblici — very
nice public gardens with a playground — which every other year play
host to the International Film Festival and the famous international art
show, the Biennale di Venezia.
Dorsoduro
This artsy neighborhood is where the university is located, together with
some famous attractions — Gallerie dell’Accademia, Ca’ Rezzonico, the
Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Santa Maria della Salute — and many
interesting small restaurants, along with a few simpler hotels. Crowds

cluster around the Accademia in high season and on weekends, but all in
all, this neighborhood is far less crowded than San Marco. In the evening,
locals and visitors alike head for the beautiful promenade of the Zattere,
famous for its outdoor cafes. This area also includes La Giudecca, a long
and skinny cluster of islands separated from the rest of the sestiere by
the Canale della Giudecca (second in importance after Canal Grande).
San Marco
Named after the famous Basilica, this is the heart of the historic district
and the main tourist destination, as it contains some of the major attrac-
tions in Venice: St. Mark’s Basilica, Palazzo Ducale, Ponte dei Sospiri,
Correr Museum, Palazzo Grassi, Teatro La Fenice, and the Ponte 
di Rialto. Here you’ll find lots of hotels (including some of the most
expensive in the city), several fabulous shops, and a few administrative
offices — but not many locals live here. The many restaurants tend to be
“touristy,” and the streets overcrowded. To appreciate its picturesque
side, explore the area at night, when the crowds have receded, or come
in the off season.
San Polo
On the other side of Canal Grande from San Marco, this was the main
market in Venice back when Rialto was the marine terminal of the
medieval city. It is still a commercial neighborhood with many shops,
some simple restaurants, and just a few hotels. Its major attractions are
the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, the Basilica dei Frari, and Ponte di
Rialto. It gets crowded — especially around the Rialto during shopping
hours — but mostly in high season and on weekends
Santa Croce
This small borough is the least visited part of Venice, as its few interest-
ing churches and the pretty Riva di Basio promenade are little known.
To the west are the islands with the marine and car terminals; hotels and
restaurants are rare here.

Getting Around Venice
Venice is very safe — the only real dangers are being served a bad meal
at a touristy restaurant and being overcharged for your purchases. No
matter how deserted and run-down a calle (street) may be, you can
stroll anywhere, even at night. That shouldn’t induce you, though, to 
do foolish things such as display large quantities of cash or leave your
expensive camera unattended: Plenty of pickpockets are still around to
take advantage of distracted tourists in crowded areas.
Think of Venice’s canals as its streets: These waterways are the main
means of access to the houses, which is why the facades of buildings are
on the canals. The easiest and best way to get around is by boat, and
you’ll see plenty of small motorboats put-putting along the canals.
No book-sized map can give full details of the narrow calli and bridges. If
you’re planning to do some major exploring, we recommend picking up a
good map — such as the smartly folded Falk map — at most bookstores
and newsstands.
On foot
Behind Venice’s canals are narrow streets that divide one building 
from another. Crossing these canals are small bridges with steps up and
down — a major difficulty for anything on wheels (just imagine how diffi-
cult loading and unloading for shops must be). We’ve seen many a visi-
tor, unprepared for the rigors of walking Venice, slumped in dismay in
front of the steps of yet another bridge. Yet, after having your own boat,
walking is the best way to visit Venice, and you’ll be doing a lot of it. The
only things you need to remember are: Keep to your right — yes, even
walking; do not stop and block traffic on narrow bridges (a major breach
of local etiquette); and wear comfortable shoes.
Although it may appear daunting and mazelike, you can’t get lost in
Venice as you would in a regular city. There are very few streets, and
you’ll always run into a canal — so at worst, you’ll have to backtrack
and then try the next turn. Don’t feel shy about exploring, no matter
how deserted a calle may look: You are never very far from a crowded
spot where you can ask for directions.
Chapter 16: Venice 307

As you wander, look for the ubiquitous signs with arrows (sometimes a
little old, but still readable) that direct you toward major landmarks,
such as Ferrovia (the train station), Piazzale Roma (the car terminal),
Vaporetto (the nearest vaporetto stop), Rialto (the bridge), Piazza San
Marco, Accademia (the bridge), and so on.
The famous acqua alta (high tides) shouldn’t be a concern. They occur
only occasionally between November and March, and there is no need to
pack your waders (unless you want to wander in the smallest or most
out-of-the-way streets at high tide): Wooden platforms are placed along
the major routes. The best hotels actually lend their guests plastic boots
in an ample choice of sizes. Particularly high tides are announced by a
siren.
By vaporetto
Public transportation in Venice (% 041-2722111; www.actv.it) is by
boat: The vaporetto is a water bus — something between a small barge
and a ferry — and can be great fun. One must-do experience is the ride
down the Canal Grande early in the day or by night (see “Exploring
Venice,” later in this chapter). With rush-hour crowds, remember to put
your backpack down when you’re standing: It’ll also be less exposed 
to pickpockets. A simple ride along the Canal Grande costs 2€ ($2.40),
whereas a 60-minute ticket valid on all lines is 5€ ($6).
If you plan to use the vaporetto a lot, go for a 24-hour pass for 12€ ($14),
or a 72-hour pass for 25€ ($30); they give you access to the whole public
transportation system, including the lines crossing the Lagoon to
Murano, Burano, and Lido. Another option is the Venice Card Blue,
which includes unlimited vaporetto rides plus free access to the city-run
public bathrooms. A day card costs 17€ ($20) for adults and 15€ ($18)
for youths 4 to 29; a three-day card is 34€ ($41) and 30€ ($36), and a
seven-day card 52€ ($62) and 47€ ($56), respectively. Finally, with the

How to get around if you’re 
wheelchair-bound
Although the city has made big efforts, Venice still isn’t easy for visitors in wheelchairs.
The only real problem is the bridges over the canals, all with steps up and down to
allow boat passage underneath. But this is an issue only if you want to explore the
little streets, as all the main attractions are accessible by water — and vaporetti are
boarded by gangways, which have no steps. A few bridges have been equipped with
motorized lifts (alas, we saw a number that were inoperable): You’ll need to pick up a
key at a tourist info desk, which can also provide you with a special city map with
wheelchair-accessible itineraries. You can also get the latest info online at www.
comune.venezia.it/handicap.

Rolling Venice Card (see “Exploring Venice,” later in this chapter) you’ll
get a three-day transportation pass for 15€ ($18).
See the Cheat Sheet at the front of this guide for a map of Venice’s
vaporetto system.
By traghetto (ferry skiff)
Many people don’t know that a traditional type of boat similar to the
gondola is still used as public transportation: the traghetto. It’s moved by
two rowers instead of one and is much simpler in its decoration. These
operate along the Canal Grande, providing additional crossing — only
three bridges span this long canal — for a mere 0.50€ (46¢) per person.
The eight traghetto stations are San Tomà, Santa Maria del Giglio,
Dogana, Ferrovia, Rialto, San Marcuola, San Samuele, and Santa Sofia.
The operating hours vary for each traghetto; all start between 7 and 
8 a.m., but only those of Santa Maria del Giglio, San Tomà, and Santa
Sofia run in the afternoon (until between 7 and 9 p.m.); the others stop
at 1 to 2 p.m. To take it, walk down to the small wooden dock indicated
by the sign TRAGHETTO (the street leading to the dock is often called Calle
del Traghetto) and wait for the boat to come. You’ll notice that Venetians
ride traghetti standing, proudly displaying their sea legs — but don’t try
to imitate them, as the water in the Canal Grande is none too clean!
By water taxi
Though a little expensive, water taxis are the perfect way to get to and
from your hotel with your luggage — and to have a taste of luxury. You
can get one by walking to a taxi stand — at San Marco, the rail station, or
Rialto — or by calling for pickup (see “Fast Facts: Venice,” at the end of
this chapter). The fare for up to four people starts at 8.70€ ($10), plus
1.30€ ($1.60) for every 60 seconds and 1.50€ ($1.80) for each piece of
Chapter 16: Venice 309
Street names and numbers in Venice
Even street addresses are different in Venice: There are no street numbers, only postal
addresses, therefore “2534 San Marco” and “2536 San Marco” may well be on two dif-
ferent streets (the post office has a map of buildings). That’s why all hotels and restau-
rants have small maps printed on the back of their business cards and why even
Venetians call for directions before going to an address they haven’t been to before.
Always make sure you have the name of the sestiere (borough): Venice has many
streets of the same name! You’ll also notice that there are very few “Via”; streets here
are called calle (pronounced with a hard l) — or salizzada or calle larga if they are
larger — but also rio terà (a canal that was filled in to make a street), sottoportico
(passage under a building), and fondamenta (promenade running alongside a canal).
There’s only one piazza in Venice, and that’s Piazza San Marco — all the others are
campo or campiello.

luggage larger than 50 centimeters (20 inches) per side; there’s also a 6€
($7.20) call surcharge and a 5.50€ ($6.60) night or 5.90€ ($7) holiday sur-
charge. Remember that even water taxis can’t reach certain locations —
and hotels — in which case you’ll have to walk the rest of the way.
Be aware of “Gypsy” water taxis that will offer you a ride. Official taxis
do not cruise around looking for passengers.
Staying in Style
You’ll find plenty of accommodations in Venice for every budget, but if
you’re looking for a spacious and bright room in a hotel with an elevator
in the historic district in high season, you’ll have to pay full price or book
way in advance — up to a year for the most sought-after spots. Low
season is short — from mid-November to mid-December, the beginning of
January to mid-February, July, and August; at all other times, you’ll have
to compete with literally hundreds of thousands of fellow tourists from
around the world. On the other hand, during low season, prices will liter-
ally drop by half. In this section, we have selected the hotels that provide
the best quality-to-price ratio and that are accessible either by water or a
short walk (and whenever possible without crossing bridges).
If you arrive without a reservation, the Hotel Association of Venice
(AVA; % 800-843006 in Italy, or 041-5222264; www.veneziasi.it) offers
a free reservations service; it maintains booths at the train station, at
Piazzale Roma, at the airport, and at the tourist info desks at the end of
the highway on the mainland.

San Polo
The oldest hotel in Venice — it was commissioned by the doges as a guest-
house back in 1290 — this is still a charming place to stay. It was turned
into a private house and then back into a hotel, now with modern ameni-
ties (except for, alas, an elevator). The medium-sized guest rooms have
been redone to contemporary standards, but have retained some of the
antique flavor thanks to the ornate Venetian-style furnishings, parquet
floors, and damask upholstery. Bathrooms are modern with all the neces-
sary amenities. The cozy breakfast room overlooks the canal.

Dorsoduro
At the tip of La Giudecca — a few minutes from San Marco by free shuttle
boat — this hotel offers one of the most romantic experiences in Venice
and some of the highest rates in Europe. Housed in a 16th-century
monastery overlooking the water on three sides, and complete with clois-
ters, it offers individually decorated rooms that are sumptuous but not
overly ornate. All are spacious and feature elegant furnishings, quality
linens, large bathrooms, and views. Public spaces include gardens and a
private pool. With a ratio of two staff members for each room, the service
here is perfect. The Fortuny is one of the best restaurants in Italy. For
those desiring extra privacy, the two annexes — Palazzo Vendramin and
Palazzo Nani-Barbaro — are 15th-century, all-suite gems connected to the
main building by flowery courtyards.

Hotel Campiello
$$$
Castello
This pink 15th-century building, once a convent, is a bargain for the area.
The location is nearly perfect, just off Riva degli Schiavoni but somewhat
quieter. Guest rooms are decorated in either Liberty (Art Nouveau) or
19th-century style, and all have new bathrooms. The triples and quads are
great for families. Run by two sisters, this hotel offers friendly and expert
service. The substantial buffet breakfast is served in a rather glitzy hall.

Castello
This elegant hotel is a great addition to Venice hotel scene, only steps
away from St. Mark’s Basilica. Once inside, you’ll feel miles away from the
crowds outside. Guest rooms are spacious and nicely done in Venetian

friendly. Note that Internet specials may bring rates down by as much as
40 percent.

Chapter 16: Venice 313

Hotel Metropole
$$$$
Castello
One of the few posh hotels that’s still family run (the others have been
bought by American chains), this romantic property includes the chapel
where Vivaldi composed the Four Seasons. From its elegant canalside
entrance to the opulent Venetian baroque interior, from the peaceful court-
yard garden to the kindness of the staff, this hotel sets itself apart. Each
guest room is spacious and individually furnished with quality fabrics and
some antiques. The suites are palatial — nos. 401 and 403 have an altana
(sort of a widow’s walk), while the Angels Suite is beautifully frescoed —
and the good-sized bathrooms (all with tubs) are done in marble or
mosaic. The restaurant is one of the best in Italy (see later in this chap-
ter), and the beautiful Mirror Hall features afternoon tea with homemade
pastries.
See map p. 312. Riva degli Schiavoni, 4149 Castello. % 041-5205044. Fax: 041-5223679.
www.hotelmetropole.com. Vaporetto: 1, 5, 41, 42, 51, 52, or 82 to San Zaccaria;

Rates include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel San Cassiano Ca’ Favretto
$$$
Santa Croce
This is your chance to stay in a gorgeous 14th-century palazzo on the
Canal Grande without spending a fortune. Located across from the Ca’
d’Oro and left of the Ca’ Corner della Regina, the hotel has been carefully
renovated, so all guest rooms now have quality dark-wood furniture,
brightly colored wallpaper, and large windows. Many have views of the Ca’
d’Oro or the smaller canal on the side. The hotel also has a beautiful ter-
race overlooking the canals.
See map p. 312. Calle della Rosa, 2232 Santa Croce. % 041-5241768. Fax: 041-721033.

Stae, cross the canal and turn right on Fondamenta Rimpetto Mocenigo, then left on

and turn left on Calle della Rosa. Rack rates: 270€–390€ ($324–468) double. Rates
include breakfast. AE, V.
Hotel Santo Stefano
$$$
San Marco
This charming small hotel offers excellent value. Housed in the 15th-
century watchtower of a convent on the beautiful Campo Santo Stefano, it
features lushly decorated accommodations and a nice terrace. Guest
rooms are individually furnished and may come with coffered ceilings,
Murano chandeliers, and antiques. All are equipped with comfortable
Poltrona Frau beds (the best Italian maker of modern beds and sofas),
quality Venetian-style reproductions, and marble and mosaic bathrooms.

Hotel Violino d’Oro
$$$
San Marco
This family-run boutique hotel has an excellent location, very close to San
Marco. Housed in the 18th-century Palazzo Barozzi, it overlooks the canal
Rio San Moisè. Guest rooms are brightly decorated with fine fabrics and
Venetian-style furniture. Some of the rooms are larger than others, but all
have Murano chandeliers and marble bathrooms (only a few with tubs). A
nice roof terrace and an attentive staff round out the perks. Internet spe-
cials can bring down rates by over half.

La Calcina
$$
Dorsoduro
This historic pensione has been renovated to respect its simple original
style and refitted with antique furniture. This is where Victorian writer
John Ruskin stayed in 1876 when he wrote The Stones of Venice. The loca-
tion overlooking the Canale della Giudecca is both beautiful and less hectic
than the area around San Marco. The good-sized guest rooms have par-
quet floors and sometimes beamed ceilings. In warm weather, a buffet
breakfast is served on the terrace. The hotel also has a solarium (roof ter-
race). Be forewarned that this desirable, moderately priced hotel fills up
fast: You’ll need to reserve up to six months in advance for high season.
See map p. 312. Zattere ai Gesuati, 780 Dorsoduro. % 041-5206466. Fax: 041-5227045.
Vaporetto: 51, 52, 61, 62, or 82 to Zattere; turn right along the Canale della Giudecca
to the Rio di San Vio. www.lacalcina.com. Rack rates: 182€ ($218) double. Rates
include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Locanda ai Santi Apostoli
$$
Cannaregio
This small family-run hotel offers cozy accommodations and charming
details. Set on the top floor of a 14th-century palazzo overlooking the
Canal Grande, the guest rooms are quite large and individually decorated
with a mix of modern furnishings and period reproductions, along with a
few antiques. Bathrooms are small, but come with all the amenities. Two
of the rooms have views of the canal, and many are large enough to accom-
modate families.

breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Chapter 16: Venice 315

Locanda Novecento
$$
San Marco
Only a few steps from St. Mark’s and Accademia is this delightful new
family-run boutique hotel, which offers individual and attentive service.
The theme of the hotel is in its name — “1900” — and the décor of both the
public spaces and the sumptuous guest rooms was inspired by the famous
Spanish artist Mariano Fortuny, who worked and lived in Venice in the first
half of the 20th century. The small garden — used for breakfast in good
weather — is a delight.
See map p. 312. Campo San Maurizio, Calle del Dose, 2694 San Marco. % 041-
2413765. Fax: 041-5212145. www.novecento.biz. Vaporetto: 1 to Giglio; walk up to
Campo Santa Maria del Giglio, make a right, and cross two bridges. Rack rates: 260€
($312) double. Rates include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Palazzo del Giglio
$$
San Marco
Next door to the Gritti Palace, this was formerly part of that famous hotel,
but is now independent. Housed in a charming pink-colored palazzo, it
offers plush accommodations and excellent service. Guest rooms —
mostly suites — are nicely furnished in a restrained palette, with some
antique pieces and some reproductions. Bathrooms are above average in
size and appointments: Dressed in Carrara marble, they all have tubs with
hydromassage. Breakfast is served in your room. Most of the suites are
equipped with a kitchenette for long-term business travelers, but they are
also a great resource for families.

041-5205158. www.hotelgiglio.com. Vaporetto: 1 to Giglio. Rack rates:
225€–240€ ($270–$388) double; suite 310€ ($372) and up. Rates include breakfast.
AE, DC, MC, V.
Palazzo Sant’Angelo
$$$$
San Marco
The first hotel to open on the Canal Grande in over a century, this is a wel-
come addition to the Venice luxury options. Housed in Palazzo Corner-
Spinelli, it offers a perfect location, with a private entrance on the Canal
Grande and a vaporetto stop next door, in one of the few quiet corners of
the San Marco neighborhood. The public spaces are gorgeous — the living
room has its original Palladian marble floors — and the guest rooms are
sumptuous. The spacious bathrooms, done in green-and-white marble,
have hydromassage bathtubs. The rooms overlooking the Canal Grande
are the most beautiful.
See map p. 312. 3488 San Marco. % 041-2411452. Fax: 041-2411557. www.palazzo

Pensione Accademia Villa Maravegie
$$$
Dorsoduro
In a beautiful location two steps from the Accademia, this hotel occupies
a 17th-century villa with a garden, and the whole place has a wonderfully
old-fashioned feel. The guest rooms feature 19th-century furnishings and
decent-sized bathrooms. It’s very popular, so reserve well in advance to
secure a room with a view of the garden.

Dining Out
Venice is a tricky place to eat. That’s not because the local cuisine isn’t
good — it is delicious, especially if you like seafood, which is used in
Chapter 16: Venice 317

abundance — but because so many eateries in the city are such tourist
traps. Venice is small enough that restaurants and trattorie are basically
everywhere, but good ones are hard to find. When you find the right
place, though, it can be heavenly: The staples of Venetian cuisine are
fish and shellfish from the lagoon and the Adriatic, served on rice, pasta,
or polenta (cornmeal) — and wine is an important part of the meal (see
Chapter 2 for more details). Note that restaurants here are rather expen-
sive, and all will add to your bill a coperto (cover) charge of between
1.50€ and 5€ ($1.80–$6) and 10 to 15 percent service.
There is no fishing on Sundays, thus the fish market is closed on Mondays
and the seafood you’ll eat is from the Saturday before. On Mondays, have
meat or a pizza instead.
Ae Oche

Dorsoduro
PIZZA
This loftlike restaurant — housed in a former storage building — is a branch
of a local restaurant focusing on quality and speed of service. The décor
combines modern touches with respect for ancient beauty — note the
beamed roof and Murano chandeliers — while the menu includes 100 dif-
ferent pizzas and a choice of beers on tap, plus an extensive salad selection
and a few meat and pasta dishes. The original restaurant is at Campo San
Giacomo dall’Orio, at Calle de le Oche (Santa Croce 1552; % 041-5241161).

A la Vecia Cavana

Cannaregio
VENETIAN
This renowned restaurant is housed in a 17th-century boathouse (gondole
were repaired and stationed here), completely restored and decorated in
bright colors. The cuisine is typically Venetian, with many “turf” options
beside the “surf” ones. The oven-roasted crab is an excellent antipasto, as
are the baccalà mantecato (creamed cod) and the savory sardines. Also
very good is the risotto with basil and scallops, along with the frittura mista
(fried calamari and small fish).

VENETIAN/SEAFOOD
Located well away from the tourist areas, this small trattoria from 1700 is
very popular with locals — and no wonder, as the food is very good and
moderately priced (reservations are a good idea). The seasonal menu
includes many excellent risotti — such as a well prepared squid-ink risotto.
The fish secondi vary, but all are delicious renditions of traditional
Venetian dishes.

Lunch on the go in Venice
Eating in Venice is very expensive — your wallet will welcome a little picnic break
now and then. You’ll find many bars selling sandwiches, but we like making our own.
You’ll find local specialties, fresh bread, and scrumptious sweets at the bakeries and
grocery shops lining Strada Nuova in Cannaregio; nearby, on Rio Terà Santi Apostoli
(4612 Cannaregio), you’ll find a Coop (a supermarket with mainland prices). Two other
excellent places are Via Garibaldi in Castello — where you’ll see another Coop super-
market — and around Campo Rialto Nuovo in San Polo, where you’ll discover the lively
and colorful fish, produce, and flower markets. Remember that Piazza San Marco is
an open-air museum and, as such, eating on the premises is forbidden.

Antico Martini
$$$$
San Marco
VENETIAN/CREATIVE
This elegant restaurant, on the site of an 18th-century cafe, is one of the
city’s best — and as such comes with a high price. Under gilded frames
and chandeliers — and on the delightful terrace in fine weather — you can
sample Venetian specialties such as the excellent veal liver with onions,
as well as innovative dishes like a wonderful torte of young artichokes and
prawns. This gourmet spot is also famous for its involtini di salmone al

The Venetian-Tuscan marriage gave birth here to a refined cuisine, making
this one of Venice’s best restaurants. You can still get steaks in true Tuscan
style, but the traditional Venetian cuisine has taken over much of the
menu. Excellent choices include the bigoli in salsa and the spaghetti al car-
toccio ai frutti di mare (spaghetti with seafood cooked in a pouch), as well
as the frittura della Serenissima (deep-fried seafood and vegetables). Leave
room for dessert, as they are homemade and delicious.

Taking a sweet break
Venetians definitely have a sweet tooth and make delicious pastries; you can sample
typical delights at Pasticceria Tonolo (San Pantalon, 3764 Dorsoduro; Vaporetto: San
Tomà) or Pasticceria Marchini (Spadaria, 2769 San Marco; % 041-5229109). Good
gelato (ice cream) is more difficult to find: Industrial and pretend-homemade ice cream
is sold at every corner, but it is a pale imitation of what you can have in Rome, Naples,
or heavenly Sicily. One of the best places is the hole-in-the-wall Boutique del Gelato

the premises.

Exploring Venice
It is of paramount importance during high season, and a good idea at all
times, to make advance reservations for Palazzo Ducale and the
Gallerie dell’Accademia — thereby avoiding the long lines.
Venice offers a number of interesting passes and discount cards:
 The Venice Card Orange (% 041-2424; www.venicecard.it) is
the most comprehensive: It gives you access to all public trans-
portation, public bathrooms, city-run museums (the equivalent of a
Museum Pass, described below), and the Venice Casinò (adult ver-
sion only). It also grants discounts at participating shops, restau-
rants, and attractions. It comes in one-day (29€/$35 adults;
22€/$26 youths under 29), three-day (54€/$65 adults; 45€/$54
youths), and seven-day (76€/$91 adults; 67€/$80 youths) versions.
The card is free for children under 4. For an additional fee, you can
include the airport shuttle boat or parking at the ASM Garage at
Piazzale Roma (you need to pay this online when you reserve).
Cards must be reserved at least 48 hours in advance (also online).
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana 
324

After you arrive in Venice, you can pick up your card at ticket booths
at Piazzale Roma, Tronchetto, the Santa Lucia train station, and the
Marco Polo airport. The Venice Card Blue does not include city-run
museums (see “Getting Around Venice,” earlier in this chapter).
 If you’re between the ages of 14 and 29, the Rolling Venice Card
(% 041-2413908; www.comune.venezia.it) is a great deal: It
gives you substantial discounts — from 10 to 40 percent — on
hotels, restaurants, museums, public transportation (see earlier in
this chapter), and shops. If you decide to get the Venice Card (see
earlier in this chapter), the Rolling Venice discounts are on top of
those. It costs 3€ ($3.60) and you need to register with a photo ID
at one of the Rolling Venice information kiosks, the most conven-
ient being the one inside the Santa Lucia train station (% 041-
5242852; open daily 8 a.m–8 p.m. July–Oct); they’ll give you your
card plus a map of Venice charting the location of all the participat-
ing hotels, restaurants, clubs, and shops, as well as a special guide-
book with interesting facts and smart itineraries.
 The Museum Pass for 18€ ($22) gives you admission to Palazzo
Ducale, Correr Museum, Libreria Marciana, Ca’ Rezzonico, the Glass
Museum in Murano, and the Lace Museum in Burano, plus a few
others.
 A combination ticket for the Ca’ d’Oro, Museo Orientale in Ca’
Pesaro, and Gallerie dell’Accademia is available for 11€ ($13); you
can purchase it at the ticket booth of any of the three museums.
 If you already have the Venice Card (see earlier in this chapter) and
you’re staying a few days, you can get a free Chorus Card (% 041-
2740462; www.chorusvenezia.org), giving you access to 15 of the
best churches in Venice (including Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari
and the Chiesa del Redentore) with audio guide; without the Venice
Card, the pass costs 8€ ($9.60). A family version, for two adults and
two children 11 to 18, goes for 16€ ($19). The pass is valid for one
year and is for sale at all participating churches except Santa Maria
Gloriosa dei Frari.
As everywhere else in Italy, bare shoulders, halter tops, tank tops, shorts,
and skirts above the knee will lead to your being turned away at church
entrances — no kidding, and no matter what your age and sex (see
Chapter 2).

Ca’ d’Oro
Cannaregio
The Ca’ d’Oro (Gold House), as its name suggests, was once richly deco-
rated with gold, now worn away to reveal the marble beneath. Begun in

Chapter 16: Venice 327

Its elegant tracery of carvings is the epitome of Venetian Gothic, that won-
derfully ornate style that’s never gaudy nor broodingly morbid like its
northern European cousin. The building was bought in 1895 by musi-
cian/art collector Giorgio Franchetti, who donated the Ca’ d’Oro and his
collections to the public in 1916. Besides antique furniture, tapestries, and
Venetian ceramics from as far back as the 12th century, the collection
includes many works by the best Italian masters. The stars of the show
are Mantegna’s San Sebastian and Titian’s Venus at the Mirror.
See map p. 326. Calle Ca’ d’Oro. % 041-5238790. www.cadoro.org. Vaporetto: 
1 to Ca’ d’Oro. Admission: 5€ ($6); children under 12 free. Open: Mon 8:15 a.m.–2 p.m.,
Tues–Sun 8:15 a.m.–7:15 p.m.; ticket booth closes 30 minutes earlier; closed Jan 1,
May 1, and Dec 25.
Ca’ Rezzonico
Dorsoduro
Begun in 1649 for the Bon, an important Venetian family, it was acquired a
hundred years later by the Rezzonico family, who completed the structure,
making it into one of the most magnificent palazzi on the Canal Grande.
The most famous resident was the English poet Robert Browning, who
died here in 1889. The Ca’ Rezzonico contains the Museum of the 18th
Century in Venice, and among its elegant rooms is the Throne Room,
whose ceilings were painted by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. You can step
out onto the balcony and gaze down the Canal Grande like a brooding poet
and get a feel for the life of a Venetian aristocrat.
See map p. 326. Fondamenta Rezzonico 3136. % 041-2410100. www.musei
civiciveneziani.it. Vaporetto: 1 to Ca’ Rezzonico. Admission: 6.50€ ($7.80).
Open: Wed–Mon, Apr–Oct 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Nov–Mar 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; closed Jan 1,
May 1, and Dec 25.
Gallerie dell’Accademia
Dorsoduro
Rivaling Florence’s Uffizi Gallery and Rome’s Galleria Borghese, this is a
fantastic collection of paintings from the 13th through the 18th centuries.
Its 24 rooms are housed in a former church and attached monastery, the
Scuola Grande di Santa Maria della Carità, one of Venice’s religious asso-
ciations. The complex also houses Venice’s Academy of Fine Arts. You
can follow the development of art from the medieval period to the
Renaissance through the galleries, while also walking through the history
of Venetian art.
In room 1, you find the luminous, influential works of Veneziano, still very
medieval in feeling. Then you pass into the totally different world of the
15th century, marked by greater naturalism, fuller figures, and the intro-
duction of perspective. For example, Jacopo Bellini’s Madonna and Child
shows the figures in three-quarter view rather than head-on, giving an inti-
mate feeling. In succeeding rooms are Mantegna’s St. George and exam-
ples of Tintoretto’s revolutionary work (radical postures, greater
looseness, and theatricality, as well as an instantly recognizable palette).
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana 
328

There’s too much in the Accademia to even give an adequate summary,
but don’t miss Lorenzo Lotto’s striking portrait of a young man watched
by a small lizard on a table; Giorgione’s haunting portrait of an old
woman; and the Tiepolo ceiling paintings rescued from a now-destroyed
building. One of the most famous works is Veronese’s incredible, enor-
mous Last Supper. Its frenzied energy and party atmosphere (with wine
flowing and dwarf figures in the foreground) brought a charge of heresy
(and a hasty change of title to The Banquet in the House of Levi). At the end
of room 15 is Palladio’s gravity-defying staircase. Room 20 contains a fas-
cinating series of paintings by Carpaccio, Bellini, and others, all commis-
sioned to illustrate miracles of the True Cross, a fragment of which was
brought to Venice in 1369, but also illustrating Venice as it once was.
See map p. 326. Campo della Carità, at the foot of the Accademia Bridge. % 041-

Palazzo Ducale and Bridge of Sighs
San Marco
Shimmering after a lengthy restoration, the pink-and-white marble facade
of Venice’s most beautiful palazzo has been returned to view. Pause to take
in the delicate decorations, the expressive carvings, and the splendid bas-
reliefs of its columns before entering. Once the private home of the doges
(the doge was leader of the republic, elected for life), as well as the seat of
government and the court of law, the Palazzo Ducale was the heart of the
republic. In Gothic-Renaissance style, it was begun in 1173, integrating the
walls and towers of the previously existing A.D. 810 castle. The palazzo was
enlarged in 1340 with the addition of the new wing housing the Great
Council Room, a marvel of architecture for the size of the unsupported
ceilings (decorated by Tintoretto’s Paradise). On the left side of the court-
yard is the Staircase of the Giants, guarded by two giant stone figures and
a Renaissance masterpiece. At the top of these steps, you enter the loggia,
from which departs the famous Scala d’Oro (Golden Staircase) leading to

Sinking beauty
Venice has weathered wars, dictators, and conspiracies, and enjoyed more than a
thousand years of democracy. But its most treacherous foe may be the very ground
beneath it. The increase in the sea levels registered all over the planet in recent years
has had especially dramatic consequences for Venice — the city is literally sinking
into the muddy lagoon on which it was built. In spite of advice from experts all over the
world, cement injections, and the ongoing work of restoration and solidification of the
canals, the city continues to sink. The search for ways to save one of the most beau-
tiful and extraordinary cities ever built continues.

the doge’s apartments and the government chambers. These were splen-
didly decorated by the major artists of the 16th century, including Titian,
Tintoretto, Veronese, and Tiepolo. A little-known part of the palace’s col-
lection is a group of paintings bequeathed by a bishop, including inter-
esting works by Hieronymus Bosch.
From the palazzo, continue your visit on the famous Bridge of Sighs,
which didn’t get its name from the lovers who met under it: The bridge
was built in the 17th century to connect the palazzo — and the Courts of
Justice — to the prisons, and those condemned to death passed over this
bridge (supposedly sighing heavily) both on their way into the prison and
eventually on their way out to be executed in Piazzetta San Marco. The
two red columns on the facade of Palazzo Ducale mark the place where
the death sentences were read out. You can visit both the 16th-century
New Prisons, built when the palace’s limited facilities became insufficient,
and the Old Prisons; these were also called pozzi, literally “wells,” but
“pits” would be a better translation, as they were at and below the ground
level — which, in Venice, means they flooded at high tide.
If you’re interested in the dark history of these ages, you’ll love the special
guided tour “Secret Itineraries,” which takes you into the doges’ hidden
apartments and the Courts of Justice, where the most important decisions
were made. You’ll also visit the famous Piombi (literally “leads”), the pris-
ons under the lead roof of the palace: Horribly hot in summer and cold in
winter, this is where Casanova was held and from where he made his illus-
trious escape. The tour is offered in several languages and costs an extra
4€ ($4.80) (reserve at least 48 hours in advance).
The Palazzo Ducale is huge, especially when you count the labyrinthine
prison next door. You can easily spend four hours inside, especially if you
take one of the special tours.

Peggy Guggenheim Collection
Dorsoduro
Housed in the elegant Palazzo Venier dei Leoni on the Canal Grande, this
museum holds one of Italy’s most important collections of avant-garde art.
The reason the building looks so short is that it’s the ground floor of a 1749
palazzo that was never completed. American expatriate collector Peggy
Guggenheim lived here for 30 years; after her death in 1979, the building
and collection became the property of New York’s Guggenheim
Foundation. Peggy G.’s protégés included Jackson Pollock, represented by
ten paintings, and Max Ernst, whom she married. From dada and surreal-
ism to abstract expressionism, the collection is rich and diverse, with
works by Klee, Magritte, Mondrian, De Chirico, Dalí, Kandinsky, Picasso,
and others. The sculpture garden includes works by Giacometti.

Piazza San Marco
San Marco
Possibly the world’s most famous piazza, this beautiful space was created
in the 11th century. Lined on one side by St. Mark’s Basilica (see later in
this section) and on the three others by the porticos and loggias of the
Procuratie buildings, it was and is the heart of Venice, site of ceremonies,
celebrations, and, at one time, tournaments. The buildings on the north
side are the Procuratie Vecchie, built in the Renaissance as offices for the
city’s magistrature; facing it to the south are the Procuratie Nuove, built
to house more offices and, after the fall of the Venetian Republic at the
hands of Napoleon, turned into the Royal Palace. The wing enclosing the
piazza to the west was added by Napoleon, after demolishing the church
that was once there. This last building now houses the Correr Museum
(% 041-2405211; Admission: 12€/$14, which includes Palazzo Ducale and
Libreria Marciana; Open: Daily Apr–Oct 9 a.m.–7 p.m., Nov–Mar 9 a.m.–5
p.m.), whose interesting collection includes some remarkable artwork,
such as Canova’s bas-reliefs; the famous painting by Carpaccio called Two
Venetian Ladies; a strange Lucas Cranach, with Christ rising from the
tomb and two bearded soldiers looking trollish; and Hugo van der Goes’s
small but strikingly emotional Crucifixion. Part of the building contains
the Risorgimento museum — with mementos and documents from that
period — and an eclectic collection of items that make up a history of daily
Venetian life. From the Correr, you can also access the Archaeological
Museum, with its rich collection of Greek sculptures.
To the north of the piazza, adjacent to St. Mark’s Basilica, is the Torre
dell’Orologio (% 041-5209070; www.museiciviciveneziani.it), a
clock tower built in 1496. The clock has two huge quadrants, the one below
indicating the phases of the moon and signs of the zodiac. The one above
is the clock with a complicated mechanism propelling wooden statues of
the Magi (the three kings bringing offerings to Jesus) guided by an angel
to come out at the striking of the hour and pass in front of the Virgin and
Child. Above this, yet another mechanism propels two bronze Moors to
strike a bell on the hour. A gruesome legend has it that when the clock was
completed, it was such a wonder that the workman who designed and built
it was blinded so he could never duplicate it anywhere else. The whole
thing has been under restoration for years; we hope you’ll find the clock
back in place and the tower reopened when you get to Venice.
To the south, St. Mark’s Bell Tower (% 041-5224064; Admission:
6€/$7.20; Open: Daily Nov–Mar 9:30 a.m.–4:15 p.m.; Apr–June and Sept–Oct
9 a.m.–7 p.m.; July–Aug 9 a.m.–9 p.m.) dominates the piazza. Used as a

lighthouse by approaching boats, this tall belfry — 97m (324 ft.) high —
was originally built in the ninth century. It suddenly collapsed in 1902, but
was faithfully rebuilt using most of the same materials. From atop, you can
admire a 360-degree panorama of the city and the famous piazza below —
and you can do so without climbing hundreds of steps, as there’s an ele-
vator!
Attached to Piazza San Marco is Piazzetta San Marco, a smaller space
opening onto the bay and lined on one side by the Palazzo Ducale (see
earlier in this section) and on the other by the Libreria Marciana
(% 041-2405211; Admission: 12€ ($14), which includes Palazzo Ducale
and Correr Museum; Open: Daily Apr–Oct 9 a.m.–7 p.m., Nov–Mar 9 a.m.–
5 p.m.). Also called Libreria Sansoviniana (Sansovino Library), after the
name of its architect, Jacopo Sansovino, this elegant building was erected
between 1537 and 1560 to house the republic’s collection of Greek and
ancient Roman manuscripts. Those are made available only to scholars,
but everybody is allowed to see the beautifully decorated rooms and
works of art. We recommend the library’s free guided tour, available at
press time on Saturdays and Sundays at 10 a.m., noon, 2 p.m., and 4 p.m.
Outside, two granite columns — brought from the east in the 12th 
century — decorate the piazzetta. They are topped by Venetian-Byzantine
capitals: one supporting the lion symbol of St. Mark, and the other San
Teodoro, the city’s patron saint before the body of St. Mark was brought
back to Venice. This was the setting for capital executions and cruel,
extraordinary punishments for which the Serene Republic was notorious.
Don’t eat or drink while visiting Piazza San Marco and its surroundings: It
is considered an open-air museum and you will be fined if caught eating,
drinking, or littering outside the authorized areas.
See map p. 326. Off Riva degli Schiavoni. Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to San Marco–Vallaresso.
Ponte di Rialto
San Marco/San Polo
When the original wooden bridge here started rotting away, the citizens
of Venice decided, in 1588, to replace it with the current stone-and-brick
marvel. The bridge opens onto the Rialto district in San Polo, Venice’s main
merchant area since the Middle Ages. Ships arrived here after stopping at
the Dogana (Customs House), at the tip of Dorsoduro, and discharged
their merchandise in the large warehouses. Goods were then sold at the
general market surrounding the warehouses. The fish and produce whole-
sale markets were moved to the new merchant and marine terminal across
from Santa Lucia rail station only in 1998, but the retail markets have sur-
vived, retaining their picturesque flavor. Lined with shops on both sides
and busy with crowds of tourists, it is difficult to truly enjoy this splendid
bridge’s architectural beauty during the day; for the best view, try early in
the morning or late in the evening.

Santa Maria della Salute
Dorsoduro
Built after the 1630 black-plague epidemic as an ex-voto (thanks offering
to God), the octagonal St. Mary of Good Health is an enduring baroque
landmark at the end of Dorsoduro, almost across from Piazza San Marco.
On the main altar is a 13th-century Byzantine icon and Titian’s Descent of
the Holy Spirit; in the Sacristy are three Titian ceiling paintings as well
as Tintoretto’s wonderful Wedding at Cana. If you happen to be in town on
November 21, you can see the feast of the Madonna della Salute, a centuries-
old commemorative pageant in which a pontoon bridge is constructed
across the Canal Grande, linking La Salute with the San Marco side.
See map p. 326. Campo della Salute. % 041-5225558. Vaporetto: 1 to Salute.
Admission: Church voluntary offering; Sacristy 1.50€ ($1.80). Open: Daily 9 a.m. to
noon and 3–6 p.m.; open only for mass Sun 11 a.m.–12:30 p.m.

Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari
San Polo
This church is a magnificent example of the Venetian Gothic, built in the
first half of the 14th century and enlarged in the 15th. Beside it is the origi-
nal 14th-century bell tower. We single out this church not only for its archi-
tecture, but also for the exquisite artwork it contains, none more so than
Titian’s Pala Pesaro (Pesaro Altarpiece) and his Assumption over the
main altar. Another star here is Donatello’s St. John the Baptist, a rare
sculpture in wood. Be sure to visit the original wooden choir, where monks
participated in mass — this is the only extant choir of its kind in Venice.
The triangular marble monument dedicated to sculptor Antonio Canova
was actually designed by Canova to be a monument to Titian (Canova’s
followers appropriated the design for their master after he died in 1822).

La Serenissima
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 475 A.D., barbarians overran Italy’s penin-
sula, prompting some in the region to flee to where no sane barbarian could attack: the
middle of the water. Although the Venetian lagoon was populated with fishing com-
munities, Venice rapidly built itself up as a commercial seafaring powerhouse under
the protection of Bisance (Constantinople, the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire).
A thriving commercial harbor and shipyard, it detached itself and became independ-
ent in the eighth century A.D. with its first doge (the head of the government elected by
the town’s citizen) — the word doge is the Venetian mutation of the Latin word dux
(“leader”). Venice became a harbor of international importance in the tenth century,
when the Republic started regulating commerce between Europe and the Orient. The
city we know today started developing around St. Mark’s Basilica (Basilica di San
Marco), constructed to house the relics of the saint. The group of islands in the lagoon
was built up, the canals drained, and their edges reinforced. The city had begun its
metamorphosis.
The Venetian Republic was a great experiment in government. Over the centuries, a
complicated network of institutions and checks and balances was built to limit the
power of the doge and all the other political institutions that governed the city-state.
At the heart was the Maggior Consiglio (Great Council), which elected the doge.
Originally elective, membership to the Maggior Consiglio became hereditary in 1297.
The smaller Council of Ten was established in 1310 to judge conspirators in a failed
plot, but it became permanent (the doge and his counselors were also members). It
became so powerful that the Maggior Consiglio passed legislation to limit its powers
in 1582, 1628, and 1762. Most powerful of all, perhaps, was the Grand Chancellor, who,
as the head of the secret police, knew all the dark secrets of the nobility, so other insti-
tutions were established to limit his power. The experiment was successful: Venice
remained a republic until May 12, 1797, when Napoleon invaded northern Italy and
established a new European order. After Napoleon’s fall, the Austro-Hungarian empire
took over Venice, and it was only in 1866 that they were chased away and Venice
became part of the newly created Italian kingdom.

A bit of trivia: If you look carefully at the walls near the monument, you
can see an Austrian bomb that was dropped on the church during World
War I but miraculously failed to explode.

St. Mark’s Basilica
San Marco
The symbol of Venice, it was built in A.D. 829 to house the remains of San
Marco, one of the four evangelists, martyred by the Turks in Alexandria of
Egypt, and the city’s patron saint. The original church was rebuilt after it
burned down in 932, and again in 1063, taking its present shape. Five
domes — originally gilded — top the five portals, while an elegant loggia
opens in between: This is where the doge presided over the public func-
tions held in the square (multilingual audio boxes up here give a brief
description of the sites you can see around the piazza). The bronze doors
of the Basilica’s main portal are booty from the Fourth Crusade from
Constantinople. Above the entrance hall is the gallery, from which you
can have a close-up view of the rich mosaic decorations of the portals.
Only one of the mosaics above the doorways is original — the one in the
first doorway to the left. The others are 17th- and 18th-century reproduc-
tions. The rooms above house the Museo Marciano, which holds the origi-
nal horses of the Triumphal Quadriga: the famous gilded bronze horses
(the ones outside gracing the loggia are copies) which were brought back
from Constantinople in 1204 after the Fourth Crusade. Experts have esti-
mated that the horses are Greek sculptures from the fourth century B.C.
The museum also has a collection of mosaics, altarpieces, and sculptures
that decorated the basilica at one time or another. You can access the
loggia, as well as the gallery and the museum, from a long and steep flight
of stone steps inside the basilica entrance on the right.
Entering the portal, you may be overwhelmed by the luxury of the deco-
rations: gold mosaics and colored inlaid marble everywhere. The lower
part of the basilica is decorated in Byzantine and Venetian style and the
second story in Flamboyant Gothic. The atrium’s ceiling mosaics date from
1225 to 1275 and depict Old Testament scenes. The floors are in geomet-
ric marble mosaics of typical Byzantine style from the 11th and 12th cen-
turies. The inner basilica mosaics, depicting scenes from the New
Testament, were begun in the 12th century and finished in the 13th. The
treasury holds the basilica’s rich collection of relics and art, including loot
from Constantinople and the Crusades. Behind the main altar is the
famous Pala d’Oro, a magnificent altarpiece in gold and enamel started in
the 10th century and further decorated in the 14th and 15th centuries.
Finely chiseled in Byzantine-Venetian style, it is encrusted with over 2,000
precious stones.

Scuola Grande di San Rocco
San Polo
San Rocco is Jacopo Tintoretto’s Sistine Chapel. From 1564 to 1587,
Tintoretto, a brother of the school, decorated the Sala dell’Albergo, the
lower hall, and the upper hall with a series of incredibly beautiful paint-
ings depicting biblical and Christian subjects. There are 21 paintings on
the upper-hall ceiling alone (mirrors are available so you don’t have to
strain your neck). The most impressive is his Crucifixion, a painting of
almost overpowering emotion and incredible detail (the tools used to
make the cross are strewn in the foreground); the painter shows the
moment when one of the two thieves’ crosses is raised. The upper hall is
also decorated with a fascinating collection of wood sculptures carved by
Francesco Pianta in the 17th century; some depict artisans and the tools
of their trade with an amazing realism.

Finding more cool things to see and do
 Yes, we know, gondolas are for, ahem, tourists . . . but really, what
can be more romantic than being rowed in a gondola along off-the-
beaten-path canals? These historic crafts built of wood and iron are
conducted according to the strictest traditional rules, and require
enormous skill (not to mention expensive maintenance). A gondola
ride is the best way to admire the city’s Venetian Gothic and
Renaissance architecture. The palazzi on the canals were once the
residences of Venice’s wealthiest families, but many have been
transformed into museums or hotels, while others are still lived in
(lucky tenants!); a few seem forlorn and abandoned. The official
rates (set by Ente Gondola; % 041-5285075; www.gondola
venezia.it) are 73€ ($88) during the day and 91€ ($109) from 
8 p.m. to 8 a.m. for 50 minutes, with a maximum of six people; each
additional 25 minutes will cost 37€ ($56) during the day and 47€
($56) at night. All gondola stations in Venice are about equal, but
make sure you use only authorized gondolas — and establish the
price and time in advance, before you get in the boat, to avoid
unpleasant surprises. You’ll find gondola stations at San Marco 
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana

(% 041-5200685), San Tomà (% 041-5205275), Rialto (Riva del

Campo San Moisé off Calle Larga 22 Marzo (% 041-5231837), and
Riva Schiavoni (across from Danieli; % 041-5222254).
 You may want to take your tour at high tide — to be more level
with the pavement, instead of the rather scummy canal sidewalls.
You’ll also want to avoid the Canal Grande, except maybe in the
wee hours: It is so large and busy that it gets very noisy and
choppy and can therefore be quite unpleasant in a small boat.
 Built in the 12th century, the Arsenale (Vaporetto: 1, 41, or 42 to
Arsenale; follow Calle dei Forni to its end, turn left on Calle di Pegola,
and turn right into Campo Arsenale) was the Venetian Republic’s
shipyard — the name comes from the Arab word darsina’a (ship-
yard) — the largest in the world for centuries. At its heyday, when
there were as many as 100 galleons ready to sail, crews could
assemble a vessel from prefab timbers in a single day — and a crew
at that time could number as many as 16,000! The Arsenale is still
part of the Italian Navy, but is now open to the public for special
exhibits, such as Navalis — the wooden boat show — and the
Biennale di Venezia, the international art show that takes place in
odd-numbered years. We recommend taking vaporetto no. 51 or 52
to enjoy the daunting view from the water. Nearby is the Museo
Storico Navale (Campo San Biagio, 2148 Castello; % 041-5200276;
Admission: 1.60€/$1.90; Open: Mon–Fri 8:45 a.m.–1:30 p.m., Sat 
8:45 a.m.–1 p.m.), housed in the 15th-century Granary of the Venetian
Republic and in part of the Arsenale. It is the largest in Italy and
includes a beautiful collection of historical boats and models.
 The word ghetto has been used to name the neighborhood once set
apart for Jews in European cities, but the Venetian Ghetto (Ghetto
Novo) was Europe’s first. It was established in 1516 on a small
island accessible by only one bridge, which was closed at night. In
1541, when Jews from Germany, Poland, Spain, and Portugal fled to
Venice, the government allowed the community to expand into the
Old Ghetto (Ghetto Vecchio), the area between the Ghetto Novo
and the Rio di Cannaregio, which has the two largest places of 
worship — Scola Levantina and Scola Spagnola (the Levantine and
Spanish synagogues). To accommodate the growing population,
buildings were made taller and taller, which is why this area has
some of the tallest buildings in Venice. Every hour beginning at
10:30 a.m. daily, guided tours of the Ghetto (6.20€/$7.40) start at the
Museo Ebraico (Campo del Ghetto Novo; % 041-715359; Vaporetto:
1 or 82 to San Marcuola; Open: Daily Oct–May 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.,
June–Sept 10 a.m.–7 p.m.; closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25).
Admission is 3€ ($3.60) for the museum and 8.50€ ($10) for the
tour, which includes the synagogues (25 percent discount with the
Venice Card).
Chapter 16: Venice 337

 A visit to Venice isn’t complete without a trip to the Lagoon. The
closest and largest island is Murano (Vaporetto: 41 or 42) — actu-
ally a cluster of islands. It feels like a smaller, much quieter replica
of Venice, down to its main canal meandering across it. Known as
the island of the glassmakers, an industry that was created here
centuries ago, it’s still famous as ever for the unique quality of its
artistic glass work. This community of more than 6,000 contains
about 70 glass factories, some of which allow you to sit and watch
glass being blown (most only in the morning). You’ll find many
shops selling glass of all kinds — from cheap trinkets to million-
dollar chandeliers — and several good seafood restaurants. We rec-
ommend the moderately priced Ostaria ai Vetrai (Fondamenta
Manin 29; % 041-739293; Open: Wed–Sun noon to 3 p.m.), with a
pleasant canalside terrace serving excellent seafood. At the Glass
Museum (Fondamenta Giustinian; % 041-739586; Admission:
6€/$7.20; Open: Thurs–Tues Apr–Oct 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Nov–Mar 
10 a.m.–4 p.m.), you can see a number of splendid antique master-
pieces. Founded in the 7th century and rebuilt in the 12th in
Venetian Byzantine style, the church of Santa Maria e Donato is
really one of the wonders of the whole Venetian region: The floor is
decorated with a mosaic of birds and animals in semiprecious
stone, dating from 1140 — it’s a marvel unto itself.
 The farthest island from Venice — about half an hour by vaporetto
LN from Fondamenta Nove — is Burano, a fishing village renowned
for its lacemaking. The houses on Burano are famous for their
bright colors, ranging from purple to bright yellow. The town itself
is almost wholly given up to lace shops, not necessarily selling the
real thing. But the Lace School and the attached Lace Museum
(Piazza Baldassarre Galuppi 187; % 041-730034; Admission:
4€/$4.80; Open: Wed–Mon Apr–Oct 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Nov–Mar 
10 a.m.–4 p.m.) — a world-renowned center — are the repository of
ancient techniques and skills. In the museum, you can delight in the
amazing creations at leisure, without salespeople pressing you to
buy. The Duomo, with its tilting campanile, is just across the street
and features a Tiepolo Crucifixion; it’s open daily from 9 a.m. to
12:30 p.m. and 3 to 6 p.m.
 Lido (Vaporetto: 1, 6, 51, 52, or 82) is the long barrier island that
protects the lagoon from the open sea. Inhabited since ancient
times, it bloomed at the end of the 19th century with the develop-
ment of an elegant Art Nouveau resort. Its name means “beach,” so
it’s no surprise that its huge beach is where Venetians come to take
their seaside vacations. It feels a bit like California, with a lot of
green spaces and a beach atmosphere (cars can circulate here).
The Lido is also the site of some of the most elegant hotels from
the early 1900s, such as the Hotel des Bains (Lungomare Marconi
17; % 800-3253535 in the U.S., or 041-5265921; www.starwood
italy.com; closed Nov to mid-Mar), restored by Starwood to its
Art Nouveau splendor (Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice was set
here). Many visitors stay at one of Lido’s numerous hotels because

it’s only a short vaporetto ride from San Marco — and you get much
more for your money. You can spend a decadent evening at the 
elegant historic casino (still functioning in summer), ride a bike
around this barrier island (which extends for 11km/7 miles), or
play golf. If you choose to bike, you can rent one not far from the
ferry station at Gardin Anna Vallè (Piazzale Santa Maria Elisabetta
2/a; % 041-2760005).
 The period before Lent — known as Mardi Gras in New Orleans —
is celebrated as Carnevale all over Italy, and Venice’s celebrations
are spectacular, culminating the week before Ash Wednesday (usu-
ally in Feb) and on the last day, Martedi Grasso (Fat Tuesday). In
1797, Napoleon suppressed Carnevale, which had grown into a
month-long bacchanal, but this festive holiday was revived in 1980
and is a big deal in Venice. The city is famous for its elaborate cos-
tumes and masks, which are historical and elegant rather than
Halloween-ish. Musical events take place at all times, and big
crowds surge all over. Some of the events are reserved only for
those who are in disguise, such as the Gran Ballo in Piazza San
Marco. Other events include a daily Children’s Carnevale on Piazza
San Polo, a cortege of decorated boats on the Canal Grande, and a
market of Venetian costumes at Santo Stefano (see “Shopping the
Local Stores” later for other sources of authentic Venetian getups).
Costumes are for rent at Tragicomica di Gualtiero dell’Osto
(Campiello dei Meloni, 2800 San Polo; % 041-721101; Vaporetto: 1
to San Stae).
 If you love the work of Palladio, the famous architect of so many
elegant villas along the Brenta river (see Padua in Chapter 17), you
should not miss some of his best churches here in Venice. The
Chiesa del Redentore (Campo del Redentore on the Giudecca
island; Vaporetto: 82 to Redentore; Admission: 2.50€/$3; Open:
Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.) is the largest, built in the 16th century 
to celebrate the end of yet another spell of the black death; huge
yet perfectly proportioned, the monument was decorated by
important artists including Tintoretto and Veronese. We prefer the
smaller but still imposing — and much less visited — San Giorgio
Maggiore (Vaporetto: 82 to San Giorgio; free admission; Open:
Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–12:30 p.m. and daily 2:30–4:30 p.m., till 6:30 pm.
in summer), on the small San Giorgio island across from Riva degli
Schiavoni. Palladio died before its completion, but he would have
been proud of the result; the interior is decorated with works by
great artists, including Tintoretto, who left two of his masterpieces
here: the Last Supper and the Fall of the Manna, both in the presby-
tery. Sunday mass at 11 a.m. is chanted Gregorian style.

walking, thanks to the complex GPS technology. You’ll find it at the
tourist info desks (10 percent discount with the Venice Card). The best
traditional guided tours are offered by American Express (Salizzada 
San Moisè, 1471 San Marco; % 041-5200844; Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to San

($48) for a full day.
Suggested one-, two-, and three-day itineraries
Time in Venice always seems to fly. Here are a few suggestions on how to
schedule your visit:
Venice in one day
If you have only one day in Venice, you definitely want to make the most
of it with an early start. Begin your day on Piazza San Marco with a visit
to the Basilica, including the climb to the loggia upstairs, where the
light is at its most beautiful in the morning. You should then have a little
time left for the Doge’s Palace. Have a caffè or cappuccino on the terrace
of one of the two historic cafes — Caffè Florian and Caffè Quadri (see
“Living It Up After Dark,” later in this chapter) — on the piazza: expen-
sive, but oh so romantic. Afterward, have a look at the beautiful Murano
glass — and maybe even buy some — in Venini and Pauly & C. or at the
more affordable Marco Polo (see “Shopping the Local Stores,” later in
this chapter). Then walk toward the Accademia, taking the footbridge
over the Canal Grande and having lunch in the lively area nearby at
Osteria da Fiore. If you just want a sweet snack, the Pasticceria Tonolo
is wonderful (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter). After you’ve had
a bite to eat, visit the Gallerie dell’Accademia for a tour of several hun-
dred years of Venetian art. You’ll then be in the mood for a Venetian
aperitivo — a cicchetto (a glass of dry wine accompanied by some savory
tidbits) — in one of the small bars near the Accademia, or across the
Canal Grande at the Antico Martini. Treat yourself to dinner at Met in the
Hotel Metropole. Take a post-dinner gondola ride if you can afford it or
settle for a slow ride down the Canal Grande on vaporetto line no. 1. Bask
in that magical atmosphere, the glorious facades of the palazzi lining the
canal, and the romantic Ponte di Rialto as you pass beneath it.
Venice in two days
Two days in Venice are better than one, but you still don’t have time to
waste. Here is what we would do:
Day 1
Start off by following our one-day itinerary, above, in the morning, but
dedicate more time to St. Mark’s Basilica. In the afternoon, take a tour 
of the Doge’s Palace and the Bridge of Sighs. After your visits, head 
to Antico Martini for a well deserved aperitivo and possibly dinner.
Afterward, stroll to the Ponte di Rialto.
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana 
340

Day 2
Devote your morning to the Gallerie dell’Accademia. Have lunch at
Osteria da Fiore and, after you eat, visit the Basilica de’ Frari and the
Scuola Grande di San Rocco. Follow our dinner and after-dinner recom-
mendations in “Venice in one day” itinerary, above.
Venice in three days
On Day 1 and 2, follow our “Venice in two days” itinerary, above.
Dedicate your third day to the Lagoon, visiting first Murano, with its
Glass Museum and the showrooms of the most famous glassmakers, and
then Burano, with its Lace Museum. End the day with a bike ride on the
island of Lido; if it’s high season, take a swim and grab drinks at the
Casino. Alternatively, you can visit the other top churches in Venice:
Santa Maria della Salute and Palladio’s masterpieces, Chiesa del
Redentore and San Giorgio Maggiore.
Shopping the Local Stores
Venice’s most renowned wares reflect the city’s aura of delicate, shim-
mering beauty. Where else would you find exquisite goblets tinged with
gold, or lace as fine as snowflakes? Where else would fine paper be fash-
ioned from molds from the 18th century? The good stuff is definitely
here, but so is the not-so-good: Be careful to buy only from reputable
merchants.
Best shopping areas
In Venice, you may feel like a bull in a china shop — there’s glass here,
there, and everywhere. You’ll be tempted to buy some as a souvenir. For
a real Murano art object, the best bets are the — usually expensive —
showrooms of Murano’s big names of glassmaking, as well as galleries
carrying a selection of works by several glass artists. Another option, 
of course, is to go to Murano itself and shop around; a huge array of
glass shops and showrooms lines both sides of the Rio dei Vetrai (see
“Finding more cool things to see and do,” earlier in this chapter). Prices
will be the same as in town, but the selection will be larger.
If your thing is lace, you should be even more careful than with glass:
You may find local handmade lace, or local but not handmade, or not
handmade at all and actually produced thousands of miles away. Burano
(see “Finding more cool things to see and do,” earlier in this chapter)
has become an outdoor market selling everything from machine-made
stuff from Singapore to genuine handmade local lace. Again, if you know
your linens and laces, you can tell what you’re getting. If not, going to a
reputable shop in Venice may be better.
For general shopping, the best streets are the Mercerie (the zigzag route
from the Piazza San Marco clock tower to the Ponte di Rialto) and the
path leading from Piazza San Marco to Campo Santo Stefano, including
Chapter 16: Venice 341

Calle Larga XXII Marzo. Here you can find big-name Italian stores spe-
cializing in everything from shoes to housewares to clothing.
What to look for and where to find it
Venice is known for its exquisite blown glass, lace, fine paper, and the
incredibly beautiful Carnevale costumes; lesser-known items include
lovely hand-worked metal (both iron and brass) and blown-glass
lanterns.
Generally, shopping hours are daily from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 3:30 to 
7:30 p.m. In Venice, only local neighborhood shops close on Sundays.
Cast iron
Murano chandeliers are gorgeous, but lanterns are also very beautiful and
affordable. At De Rossi (showroom at Strada Nuova, 4311 Cannaregio; 
% 041-5222436; workshop at Fondamenta Nuove, 5045 Cannaregio; 
% 041-5200077), you’ll find a large collection of Venetian lanterns, the
glass blown directly inside the handmade iron fittings, plus a variety of
other iron and brass work.
Glass
Founded in the early 1920s, Venini (Piazzetta dei Leoncini, just to the
left of St. Mark’s Basilica, 314 San Marco; % 041-5224045; Vaporetto: 1
or 82 to San Marco-Vallaresso; and at Fondamenta Vetrai, Murano 47/50;
% 041-2737211; www.venini.com) is world renowned. Prices are what
you’d expect for works of art; one drinking glass could cost up to $1,000.
Pauly & C. (Palazzo Trevisan Cappello, Ponte dei Consorzi 4391/A San
Marco, off Calle Larga San Marco; % 041-5209899; www.paulyglass
factory.com) has three nice boutiques in Piazza San Marco (Piazza San
Marco 73, % 041-5235484; Piazza San Marco 77, % 041-277-0279; and
Piazza San Marco 316, % 041-523-5575). If you have the time, though,
visit the company headquarters on Rio di Palazzo, where you’ll see a
large collection of antiques and high-quality copies of ancient models.
Barovier & Toso (Fondamenta Vetrai, Murano 28; % 041-739049; www.
barovier.com) has been a family business since the 13th century. You
can visit its showroom as well as a small but rich museum with its his-
toric pieces, both housed in a 17th-century palazzo in Murano.
L’Isola (Campo San Moise, 1468 San Marco; % 041-5231973; Vaporetto:
1 or 82 to San Marco–Vallaresso) is the showroom of Carlo Moretti, one
of Murano’s great names.
The gallery Murano Collezioni (Fondamenta Manin, Murano 1CD; 
% 041-736272) has a selection of works by the three biggest names 
in Venetian glass — Barovier & Toso, Venini, and Carlo Moretti — and
makes for good one-stop shopping if you’re short on time.
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana 
342

Lace
Jesurum (Mercerie del Capitello, 4857 San Marco; % 041-5206177; www.
jesurum.it; Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to San Marco–Vallaresso) is a reliable
lace shop that’s been in business since the 1870s. High quality is expen-
sive, but the range of items, from cocktail napkins to bed linens, means
that you stand a good chance of finding something within your budget.
Another good choice is Martinuzzi (Piazza San Marco, 67/A San Marco;
% 041-5225068), with an extensive selection of beautiful lace and
embroidered linen.
Masks and costumes
If you’re in town to enjoy Carnevale and you didn’t pack your 18th-
century finery, you’re going to need a mask, at the very least. The
Laboratorio Artigianale Maschere, just a short way from SS. Giovanni e
Paolo (Barbaria delle Tole, 6657 Castello; % 041-522310; Vaporetto: 41,
42, 51, or 52 to Ospedale), has some of the most beautiful costumes.
Another option is the more affordable Mondonovo (Rio Terà Canal, 3063
Dorsoduro; % 041-5287344; Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to Accademia). Still,
expect to pay 16€ ($19) for a basic mask; for the most beautiful and
artistic masks, prices run much higher.
Paper
Handmade marbleized paper is a specialty of Venice, and Piazzesi
(Campiello della Feltrina, just off Santa Maria del Giglio, 2511 San Marco;
% 041-5221202; Vaporetto: 1 to Giglio) is said to be one of the oldest in
the business — founded in 1900.
Living It Up After Dark
As is often the case in Italy, nightlife for the locals means visiting pubs,
sitting at the outdoor terraces of well-placed cafes, going to concerts, and
(for the younger crowd) dancing at discos. Nightlife ends early in Venice
and you’ll be hard-pressed to find a place that stays open much past mid-
night. For the big discos, you have to go to Lido or the Terraferma.
The performing arts
Many Venice churches and palazzi become venues for concerts —
mostly classical — throughout the year. You’ll find a schedule of events
in the free brochure Un Ospite a Venezia, distributed by the tourist
office. The Teatro Goldoni (Calle Goldoni, 4650/B San Marco; % 041-
2402011; Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to Rialto) is one of Venice’s premier theaters
and one of the oldest, dating back to the 17th century. Venice’s largest
opera theater, the Teatro La Fenice (Campo San Fantin, 1965 San Marco;
% 041-786511; www.teatrolafenice.it) is perhaps the most elegant
in Italy. True to its mythological name, it was reborn from its ashes
Chapter 16: Venice 343

twice, after the fire of 1836 and the more recent one of 1996. Tickets are
about 12€ to 50€ ($14–$60).
Bars, pubs, and clubs
Since Hemingway’s days in Venice, one of the classic things for visitors
to do is head to Harry’s Bar (Calle Vallaresso, 1323 San Marco; % 041-
528-5777; Vaporetto: 1 to San Marco–Vallaresso) for a martini or a Bellini
(made with prosecco, a champagne-like white wine, and the juice of
white peaches). The Devil’s Forest Pub (Calle Stagneri, 5185 San Marco;
% 041-5200623; Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to Rialto) is often crowded. Another
popular spot, with younger crowds as well, is the wine bar VinoVino
(Ponte della Veste, San Marco 2007a; % 041-2417688; closed Tues),
which offers a choice of over 350 wines. Attached to the Antico Martini
restaurant is the Martini Scala (Campo San Fantin, 1980 San Marco, left
of Teatro La Fenice; % 041-522-4121; closed Tues), open until 3:30 a.m.
with a good live piano bar. Bacaro Jazz (Rialto, San Marco 5546; % 041-
5285249) is a wine bar with good music. At Il Piccolo Mondo (Calle
Contarini Corfu, Dorsoduro 1056a; % 041-5200371), near Accademia,
you’ll find younger crowds; the action goes on often until 4 a.m.
You won’t find any gay or lesbian bars in Venice, but as someone once
said, every bar in Venice is a gay bar if you look in the right corner.
Cafes
Right on St. Mark’s Square are two packed restaurant-cafes that square
off (sorry!) against each other with classical music ensembles. They’ve
been here forever: Caffè Florian (% 041-5205641; www.caffeflorian.
com) since 1720 and Caffè Quadri (% 041-5222105; www.quadrivenice.
com) since 1638. If you want something a little more authentic, Le Cafe
(Campo Santo Stefano, 2797 San Marco; % 041-5237201; Vaporetto: 1 or
82 to Accademia, then cross the bridge) serves a large assortment of
drinks, good coffee, and salads at its outdoor tables.
Venice’s Casino
The historic Palazzo Vendramin-Calergi (Campo San Marcuola,
Cannaregio 2079; % 041-5297111; www.casinovenezia.it; Vaporetto:
1 or 82 to San Marcuola) — the great composer Richard Wagner died
here in 1883 — hosts Venice’s casino from October through May. You’ll
need to be at least 18, and wearing a jacket and tie, to enter this elegant
venue offering roulette, card games, and a few slot machines. In summer,
the action moves to the island of Lido, where the Municipal Casino
(Lungomare Marconi 4; % 041-5297132; dedicated shuttle boat from
Ferrovia, Piazzale Roma, and San Marco) welcomes its guests in a grand,
if a bit stiff, atmosphere. It also offers dining and live shows.

Chapter 17
Padua, Verona, and Milan
In This Chapter
 Discovering Padua and the famous Giotto frescoes
 Thrilling to Verona, the setting for the legend of Romeo and Juliet
 Shopping ’til you drop in bustling Milan
W
ith its art and unique setting, Venice towers over all other cities
in northern Italy, shadowing many real gems. A little farther
inland from Venice is Padua, with its wealth of churches and museums.
Moving farther to the west is pleasant Verona, drawing visitors from all
over the world to see the House of Juliet — which they like to believe
was once the home of Shakespeare’s tragic heroine — and the city’s
ancient Roman and Renaissance architecture. Finally, there’s Milan,
which is such an important business center — renowned for both its siz-
zling fashion and incredible shopping opportunities — that one forgets
its art: Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper and Milan’s grandiose Gothic
Duomo, for example, seem all but trifles.
Padua and Verona make easy day trips from Venice (Padua also makes
an excellent base) — you can see the highlights of each in a few hours.
Milan is farther west and a much larger city; if you want to see both its
sides — the art and the shopping — we recommend you spend the night.
Padua: Home of Giotto’s Fabulous Frescoes
Padua (Padova) is a small but bustling, elegant yet modern city, as well
as the Veneto’s economic heart. The historic district is delightful and 
full of artistic surprises, beyond Giotto’s justly famous frescoes in the
Cappella degli Scrovegni, so breathtaking that they dwarf the other
worthy attractions in town. From its canals to its churches, Padua will
not disappoint you.
You can easily see the highlights in one day, but spending the night will
allow you to fully enjoy the town. In high season, or if you’re on a budget,
Padua also makes an excellent base for visiting Venice and the rest of the
region, as it has less expensive and much less crowded hotels.

Getting there
On the main train route from Rome to the northeast, Padua enjoys excel-
lent rail connections (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it). The city is only
30 minutes from Venice, with trains running as frequently as every few
minutes during rush hour; the fare is about 8€ ($10). The trip from
Rome lasts four and a half hours and costs about 45€ ($54). The Padua
train station is on Piazza Stazione (% 049-8751800), a 10- to 15-minute
walk from the town’s major attractions. If you don’t feel like walking,
though, you can use the excellent bus service; a 75-minute ticket costs
1€ ($1.20). Get a bus map from the tourist office in the train station.
If you’re getting here by car, Padua lies at the convergence of the
autostrada A4 (east–west) and A13 (north–south); you can easily reach it
by car from any direction. Traffic in the historic district is restricted, so
park in one of the town-run lots: APS parking on Prato della Valle, at the
train station, and on Via Fra’ Paolo Sarpi.
Spending the night
You’d expect to find plenty of delightful hotels tucked away in the heart
of Padua’s romantic historic district — but the few that there are tend to
be old-fashioned and lack style; the service is professional and kind, but
the décor is always a bit drab. That said, below is our selection of the
best hotels within walking distance of the major attractions.
Hotel Grand’Italia
$$
Train Station
Housed in a beautiful late-19th-century Liberty (Italian Art Nouveau) build-
ing that’s been completely restored, this hotel offers excellent service —
including baby sitting — and a very central location, which, together with
the historic setting, makes it our preferred choice in town. The public
spaces have been carefully decorated with fine antiques and carpets. The
large and bright guest rooms are appointed with fine fabrics and contem-
porary furnishings.
See map p. 350. Via P. Bronzetti 62, across from the train station. % 049-8761111. Fax:
049-8750850. www.hotelgranditalia.it. Parking: 15€ ($18). Rack rates: 210€
($252) double. Rates include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel Plaza
$$
Center
The most popular hotel in town with businesspeople, the Plaza offers
accommodations in line with international standards — large, carpeted
rooms decorated with modern European furniture, as well as stylish public
areas — but is housed in a nondescript modern building. The nearby
annex offers nicely appointed suites and mini-apartments. Amenities
include Wi-Fi and a gym.

Center
Just off an old market square, this is one of the best hotels in town and a
charming place to stay. The staff is helpful and the service excellent —
there’s even baby sitting — while the public spaces are elegantly outfitted
with marble floors and fine furnishings. The guest rooms have been 
renovated — some in Venetian baroque and others in Victorian style. You
won’t lack for atmosphere, comfort, or amenities (including Wi-Fi).

Dining locally
Padua’s cuisine is typically Italian, with a Venetian influence. As a univer-
sity town, it offers a variety of cheap lunch spots, particularly on Piazza
Cavour and along Via Matteotti, with everything from pasta and pizza to
sandwiches.

PADUAN
This moderately priced osteria is famous for its excellent cuisine and
friendly service. In summer, you can dine in the pretty garden, which chil-
dren seem to enjoy. Good choices include ravioli with fresh herbs and bac-
calà mantecato (creamed cod), as well as a variety of surf or turf secondi;
half-portions are available for the little ones. The wine list is excellent.

PADUAN/SEAFOOD
Down the street from the Basilica di Sant’Antonio, this moderately priced
restaurant offers welcoming dining rooms and good cuisine. The menu
includes regional dishes from coastal Veneto, with an accent on seafood;
some of the specialties are capitone (a local kind of eel), when it’s in
season, and fresh whole fish cooked in a salt crust. We also recommend
the superb antipasto buffet that can be a meal into itself; it includes a vari-
ety of preparations, from fried calamari to marinated zucchini.

CREATIVE/ENOTECA
True to its name, this is a temple to good wine, with a wine list that
includes hundreds of labels by the glass — all of it accompanied by excel-
lent cuisine. The ravioli di ricotta alla crema (ricotta ravioli with a cream

excellent stuffed quail on a bed of zucchini, mint, and green apple, or the
rabbit with pears.

Exploring Padua
Although Padua isn’t very large and you can easily explore it on foot,
you may like the new hop-on/hop-off tour offered by City Sightseeing
(www.padova.city-sightseeing.it) from May through September.
Buses depart from Basilica di Sant’Antonio every 20 to 30 minutes
between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. The route lasts one hour if you stay on board.
Tickets — for sale on the bus and valid 24 hours — cost 13€ ($16) for
adults and 6.50€ ($7.80) for children 5 to 15.
If you visit in high season, we recommend taking a boat tour of the his-
toric network of urban canals; these inner waterways have been used for
centuries and afford a very special view of Padua (see “More cool things
to see and do,” later in this section).
Associazione Guide Turistiche (% 049-8209741; www.guidepadova.it)
offers a variety of walking tours — with classical, religious, scientific, and
other themes — and will even custom-design a tour for you. Prices vary,
depending on the number of persons and the length of the tour.
For 14€ ($17), the Padova Card (% 049-8767927; www.apt.padova.it)
is an excellent deal, granting one adult (and one child under 12) free
public transportation, parking in the APS lots, and admission to the
major museums in town (except the 1€/$1.20 reservations fee for the
Scrovegni Chapel). It also gives discounts on boat tours, City Sightseeing
tours, and other guided tours (see later in this section). It’s valid for 
48 hours and is available at tourist info desks and at each participating
attraction, including the parking lots.
The top attractions
Basilica di Sant’Antonio
Built in the 13th century, this basilica houses the remains of St. Anthony
of Padua (including his tongue, still amazingly undecayed). The construc-
tion’s distinctive Romanesque-Gothic style reveals Eastern influences,
Chapter 17: Padua, Verona, and Milan 353

most visible in the eight round domes and the several campanili (bell
towers) that are vaguely reminiscent of minarets. In front of the church is
one of Donatello’s masterpieces, the equestrian statue of Gattamelata,
with a true-to-life horse and rider. Several prominent Renaissance artists
worked on the church interior: Donatello sculpted the bronze crucifix,
reliefs, and statues on the high altar (1444–48), whereas the frescoes are
by 14th-century artists Altichiero and Giusto de’ Menabuoi. From the basil-
ica cloisters, you can access the Museo Antoniano, with a collection of
works of art from the basilica; the stars are a fresco by Mantegna and a
painting by Tiepolo. Attached to the basilica is the 14th-century Oratory
of San Giorgio (ring the gatekeeper in the adjacent building if it’s not
open), decorated with a fine cycle of frescoes by Altichiero da Zevio,
restored in 2000. Next door to the right is the Scoletta del Santo, a chapel
and guild house in the style of the Venetian Scole built in the 15th century.
The second floor was added at the beginning of the 16th century and deco-
rated with sculptures and paintings by various artists — among them
Titian, who left three beautiful frescoes.
See map p. 350. Piazza del Santo 11. Basilica: % 049-8789722. Museum: 049-8225656.
www.santantonio.org. Admission: Basilica free; Oratorio di San Giorgio 1.50€
($1.80); Scoletta 1.55€ ($1.90); Museo Antoniano 2.50€ ($3). Open: Basilica summer
daily 6:20 a.m.–7:45 p.m., winter daily 6:20 a.m.–7 p.m.; Oratorio and Scoletta summer
daily 9 a.m.–12:30 p.m. and 2:30–7 p.m., winter daily 9 a.m.–12:30 p.m. and 2:30–5 p.m.;
Museo Antoniano daily 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 2–6 p.m.
Duomo and Baptistery
Built between the 16th and 18th centuries, Padua’s Duomo was partly
designed by Michelangelo. Behind the unfinished facade, the two points
of interest are the paintings in the Sacristy and the statues by Florentine
artist Giuliano Vangi in the new Presbytery. Attached to the Duomo is a
remarkable Baptistery dating from 1075 and recently restored; its interior
is a 14th-century masterpiece, completely decorated with beautiful fres-
coes by Giusto de’ Menabuoi that illustrate scenes from the lives of John
the Baptist and Christ. A vision of paradise is gloriously depicted on the
domed ceiling.
See map p. 350. Piazza Duomo. % 049-656914. Admission: Duomo free; Baptistery
2.50€ ($3), free with Padova Card. Open: Duomo Mon–Sat 7:30 a.m. to noon and
3:45–7:30 p.m., Sun 7:45 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3:45–8:30 p.m.; Baptistery daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
Closed Jan 1, Easter, and Dec 25.
Palazzo della Ragione
Opening onto Piazza delle Erbe on one side and Piazza della Frutta on
the other, this was the heart of medieval and Renaissance Padua. Open-
air markets — a fresh produce market on one side, a fruit and dry-goods
market on the other — were held then as today, and are still lively and col-
orful affairs. The ground floor, an elegantly colonnaded structure, was built
in 1218, and it served as the seat of the city’s courts of law and its assem-
bly hall. The upper level, known as the salone (Great Hall), was added in
Part V: Venice and the Best of the Pianura Padana 
354

1306; it is a fine example of medieval architecture and one of the largest of
its kind in the world: one huge open hall measuring 81m x 27m x 27m high
(265 ft. x 89 ft. x 89 ft.) and topped with a beautifully crafted wooden
vaulted roof. The rich wall frescoes, illustrating religious and astrological
themes, date from the 15th century; they replaced the original 13th-
century frescoes by Giotto and his school, which were unfortunately
destroyed by fire. The palazzo’s biggest conversation piece is a giant
wooden horse built for a jousting event in 1466. Today, after a complete
restoration that ended in 2002, the building houses special exhibitions.
See map p. 350. Via VIII Febbraio, between Piazza delle Erbe and Piazza della Frutta.
% 049-8205006. Admission: 8€ ($10); free with Padova Card. Open: Tues–Sun 
9 a.m.–7 p.m.
Scrovegni Chapel and Musei Civici Eremitani (Civic Museums)
Construction of the chapel began in 1303 by banker Enrico Scrovegni,
partly as an act of contrition because of his family’s ill-gotten wealth (his
father was an usurer). The idea had been developed by Dante in his
Inferno, which would have put Enrico’s father, Reginaldo, in the circle of
hell reserved for usurers. (Ironically, the jewel that the chapel became
under Giotto’s hands led local monks to complain about the excessive
luxury of the Scrovegni family — sometimes you just can’t win.) The
chapel is an early example of a complex project that reflects the vision of
a single artist. The unusual design — windows on one side but not the
other, no internal architectural decorations — made it a perfect canvas for
Giotto’s work, and the frescoes he executed are absolute masterpieces.
The stories that he depicts move from left to right: The top row or band
contains scenes from the life of Joachim and Anna, parents of the Virgin
Mary; the middle and lower levels of the chapel contain scenes from the
life of Jesus. Giotto also painted allegorical figures representing six virtues
and six vices. The frescoes broke with tradition in a number of striking
ways: His composition is dramatic rather than static, as in Byzantine art;
he chose scenes that weren’t usually depicted; and, above all, he repre-
sented human beings with greater psychological realism, which a glance
at these beautiful faces shows. On the altar are a beautiful Madonna with
child and two angels by the sculptor Giovanni Pisano.
A special access gate — filtering the air and controlling humidity and other
factors — protects the invaluable frescoes, as does the severely restricted
number of visitors and the length of their stay (only 25 people every 30
minutes); you will need to make a reservation for a precise time slot. Note
that reservations are also required for children under 6, even though they
enter for free.
The chapel is surrounded by the archaeological remains of the Roman
Arena — hence its other name, Cappella dell’Arena — and is accessible
from the courtyard of the museums. Housed in the monastery attached to
the chapel, these museums include a picture gallery upstairs — a rich col-
lection of paintings by Venetian masters from the 15th to the 19th cen-
turies, including important artists such as Giorgione, Titian, Veronese, and
Tintoretto — and an archaeological museum downstairs, where you can
Chapter 17: Padua, Verona, and Milan 355

see a collection of artifacts documenting the history of Padua from its pre-
historic times.
See map p. 350. Piazza Eremitani 8, off Corso Garibaldi. % 049-2010020. www.
cappelladegliscrovegni.it. Admission: 12€ ($14) adults; free with Padova
Card; children under 6 free. Mandatory reservations fee 1€ ($1.20) per person. Open:
Daily 9 a.m.–7 p.m. Closed Jan 1, Dec 25 and 26.
More cool things to see and do
 Founded in 1222, the University of Padua is Italy’s second oldest
and counted among its scholars Galileo Galilei. It was moved to 
the Palazzo del Bo (Via VIII Febbraio, just off Piazza delle Erbe; 
% 049-8273044 or 049-8273047 for reservations; www.unipd.it;
Admission: 3€/$3.60) in the 16th century and later expanded to
other buildings in town. It was the first university in the world to
have an Anatomy Theater, an architectural masterpiece by 
G. Fabrici d’Acquapendente, built in 1594. Here medical students
observed dissections of cadavers (sometimes in secret, for it was
long forbidden by the church) in order to learn about the human
body. You can visit only by guided tour; call for reservations or go
at one of the set visiting times: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at
3:15 p.m., 4:15 p.m., and 5:15 p.m.; and Tuesday, Thursday, and
Saturday at 9:15 a.m., 10:15 a.m., and 11:15 a.m.
 Like Venice, Padua is also a town of water, crossed by many 
canals — these link Padua to the Brenta river and, farther away, to
Venice and its Lagoon. During the Renaissance, rich Venetians had
their country “houses” built along this river; many of these splen-
did villas were designed by Palladio, one of the greatest architects
of all time, noted for the grace and balance of his designs. The
Consorzio Battellieri di Padova e Riviera del Brenta (Passeggio
de Gasperi 3; % 049-8209825; www.padovanavigazione.it)
offers several boat tours, all very interesting, but we particularly
recommend the Urban Tour of Padua’s historic district (about 40
minutes) along the town’s canals, as well as the tour of the villas
along the Riviera del Brenta, which starts in Padua and brings you
to Venice (a great way to get into Venice). A number of other com-
panies offer similar cruises at comparable rates, so check with the
tourist office to see which works best for you (see “Information”
under “Fast Facts: Padua,” later in this chapter). Boats run from
March to October.
 Caffè Pedrocchi (Piazza Pedrocchi, off Piazza Cavour; % 049-
8205007 or 049-8781231; www.caffepedrocchi.it) has been the
main intellectual gathering spot for the city’s intelligentsia since 
its opening in 1831. At that time, Padua was under Austrian rule,
and the cafe became a meeting place for patriotic and political
groups; it maintained this role through the years, and as late as
1943 was the scene of a student uprising against the fascist regime.
Completely restored to its elegant 19th-century glory, the cafe is
open daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. (until midnight Thurs–Sat) for

Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–1 p.m., summer also 3–6 p.m.), founded in
1545 as the garden for the university’s faculty of medicine, where
medicinal plants and herbs were grown. A pleasant and interesting
sight, it offers a unique collection of rare plants as well as the uni-
versity’s original library and collection of botanical specimens, but
there’s nothing dusty and academic about it: It’s organized like a
Renaissance garden and makes for a very pleasant stroll.

Verona: City of Juliet and Romeo
A town with ancient origins, as its famous Roman theater attests, Verona
is today a major economic hub for the region. Its pretty historic center —
rich in Romanesque churches, beautiful squares, and attractive
Renaissance architecture — is now surrounded by a bustling, modern
urban area, which contributes to a lively cultural life without spoiling the
unique spirit of this beautiful medieval town.
You can easily visit the sights in a day, but if you’re fond of opera and
you’re visiting during the Arena opera season, we recommend you
spend the night and catch a show (see later in this section).
Getting there
The train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) to Verona takes about 80
minutes from Venice and four and a half hours from Rome. The fare is
approximately 11€ ($13) from Venice and 40€ ($48) from Rome. Trains
arrive at the Stazione Porta Nuova, on Piazza XXV Aprile (% 045-
590688).
Verona’s Aeroporto Valerio Catullo, in Villa Franca (% 045-8095666;
www.aeroportoverona.it), receives flights from most major destina-
tions in Europe and Italy. Meridiana (% 892928 in Italy, or 0789-52682
from abroad; www.meridiana.it) offers daily hour-long flights from
Rome for as low as 70€ ($84) round-trip. The airport is compact; in the
arrivals lounge, you’ll find a bank with ATM and a tourist info desk. The
airport is 16km (10 miles) from the center of town, a 15-minute drive by
taxi (you’ll find a stand outside the airport). It’s about 20 minutes away
by Aerobus, the bus link to Verona’s train station; tickets costs 4.50€
($5.40) and buses leave every 20 minutes.
If you’re coming by car, Verona lies on autostrada A4. From Rome, it will
take you about six hours to cover the 505km (315 miles); from Venice,
about two hours for the 110km (68-mile) drive. Verona’s historic district
is closed to private cars, so you’ll have to park — the main parking lot is
Arsenale (Piazza Arsenale 8; % 045-8303281).

Jerusalem artichokes and a chocolate and balsamic vinegar sauce, and
tortelli di baccalà mantecato con pomodori e capperi (large ravioli filled with
cod in a tomato-and-capers sauce). Each fantastic dessert concoction is a
perfect balance of flavor and texture. The tasting menu for 115€ ($138) is
a gourmet celebration.

The menu is seasonal, but you will always find the classics: lasagna,

vicentina (cod in a tomato sauce). In good weather, the terrace is very
pleasant.

Exploring Verona
In peak season, you can take the Bus Romeo (% 045-8401207; e-mail:
romeo@amt.it for reservations), a 90-minute guided tour that’s accompa-
nied by an audio guide (available in several languages). Tours depart from
Piazza Bra and are offered from June to September, Tuesday through
Sunday, four times a day (10 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 1 p.m., and 3:30 p.m.). 
You can make reservations up to one hour before departure by phone,
through your hotel’s reception desk, or at one of the two tobacconist
shops on Piazza Bra (nos. 6b and 26). Tickets are 15€ ($18) for adults, 7€
($8.40) for youths 5 to 18. The last run on Saturday has a live guide — in
Italian and English, depending on the audience — and costs 5€ ($6) extra.
The Verona Card (% 045-8077774; www.verona.com) is a great deal,
offering unlimited public transportation and free access to all major
attractions in town. It comes in two versions: a 8€ ($10) one-day pass
and a 12€ ($14) three-day pass, which you can purchase at any of the
participating sites, a number of hotels in town, several tobacconist
shops, or online.
Chapter 17: Padua, Verona, and Milan 361

If you spend at least three nights in any hotel — or even camping — in
the province of Verona, you will receive the Welcome Card, granting dis-
counts on many attractions, guided tours, public transportation, and
even some shops and restaurants. Ask for it upon check-in should your
host forget to give it to you.
You can get a combination ticket for the five most interesting churches
in town — San Zeno, Duomo, Sant’Anastasia, San Lorenzo, and San
Fermo — for 5€ ($6) per person. The ticket can be purchased at any of
the participating churches (% 045-592813; www.chieseverona.it).
The top attractions
Arche Scaligere
These are the monumental tombs of the Scaligeri princes, enclosed in their
private cemetery adjoining the Romanesque church of Santa Maria
Antica. The wrought-iron gates bear the representation of ladders, the
family’s heraldic symbol. The grandest of the monuments is that of
Cangrande I (he was certainly top dog — his name means “Big Dog”),
which stands over the portal of the church and is crowned by his eques-
trian statue (a copy — the original is at the Castelvecchio; see later in this
section). The two other major monuments are for Cansignorio (more or
less “Sir Dog”) and Mastino II (“Mastiff”). All richly decorated, the monu-
ments are sculptural masterpieces. The church — originally built in the
8th century, but rebuilt in the 12th century after it was severely damaged
by the earthquake of 1117 — still contains part of a mosaic floor believed
to belong to the original 8th-century church. Tickets are sold at the booth
by the Torre dei Lamberti (see Piazza dei Signori, later in this section).
See map p. 359. Via Arche Scaligere, off Via Sant’Anastasia and Via P. Bosari, near
Piazza dei Signori. % 045-8032726. Admission: 2.50€ ($3); includes Torre dei Lamberti.
Open: June–Sept Mon 1:45–7:30 p.m.; Tues–Sun 9:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m. Closed Oct–May.
Arena (Roman Amphitheater)
This famous elliptical Roman arena dates from the reign of Diocletian (it
was built around A.D. 290) and remains in surprisingly good condition. The
inner ring is basically intact, though a 12th-century earthquake destroyed
most of the outer ring (only four of the arches remain). This was Italy’s
third-largest Roman amphitheater and the second most important to have
survived (after Rome’s Colosseum). The amphitheater’s overall length was
152m (499 ft.) and its height 32m (105 ft.); its 44 rows of seats could origi-
nally hold as many as 20,000 spectators, who watched gladiators and ani-
mals sparring. These days, however, the arena hosts more civilized
entertainment: One of the greatest experiences in Verona is attending an
opera or a ballet here. The season spans only the months of July and
August. Ticket prices are 20€ to 160€ ($24–$192); for a schedule and reser-
vations, call % 045-8005151 or visit www.arena.it.
See map p. 359. Piazza Brà. % 045-8003204. www.arena.it. Admission: 3.50€

1:45–7:30 p.m. Ticket booth closes 45 minutes earlier. During the performance season
(June–Aug), arena closes at 3:30 p.m.
Basilica di San Zeno Maggiore
A wonderful example of the Romanesque style and the most beautiful in
northern Italy, this church and campanile were built between the 9th and
12th centuries above the tomb of Verona’s patron saint (the original church
dates from the 4th and 5th centuries). The fascinating 11th- and 12th-
century bronze door panels illustrate San Zeno’s miracles; like other works
in this part of Italy (notably Venice), they reflect a mix of Byzantine, Gothic,
and Turkish influences. Over the entrance is the famous Ruota della
Fortuna (Wheel of Fortune), a beautiful rose window from the early 12th
century. Inside, the church is decorated with graceful Romanesque capi-
tals on the columns and frescoes (dating from the 12th to 14th centuries).
The timbered roof is still the original 14th-century one. At the north end
of the church, you can access the peaceful Romanesque cloister.
See map p. 359. Piazza San Zeno, just west of the Arena. % 045-800-4325 or -6120.
Admission: 2.50€ ($3). Open: Mar–Oct Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun and holidays
1–6 p.m.; Nov–Feb Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–1 p.m. and 1:30–4 p.m., Sun and holidays 
1–5 p.m. Ticket booth closes 15 minutes earlier.
Castelvecchio and Ponte Scaligero
The 14th-century Castelvecchio, perched over the Adige river, was the
fortress and residence of the Scaligeri family, set to defend the famous
bridge Ponte Scaligero. Built between 1355 and 1375, the bridge was
destroyed by the Nazis during their retreat at the end of World War II, but
was painstakingly rebuilt like an enormous puzzle, using the pieces that
remained in the river. Today, this castle, complete with crenellated towers
and walls, houses the Museo Civico d’Arte, a rich picture gallery con-
taining paintings by great local artist Paolo Veronese and his school, as
well as Venetian artists like Tiepolo and Tintoretto. The castle itself is
worth a visit for its labyrinthine passageways and its tower, from which
you can enjoy sweeping vistas of the city and its environs. In the court-
yard is the equestrian statue of Cangrande I.
See map p. 359. Corso Castelvecchio 2, at the western end of Corso Cavour. % 045-
594734. www.comune.verona.it/Castelvecchio/cvsito. Admission: 4€
($4.80), free the first Sun of each month. Audio guide 3.60€ ($4.30). Open: Mon
1:45–7:30 p.m.; Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m. Ticket booth closes at 6:45 p.m.
Piazza dei Signori
One of northern Italy’s most beautiful piazze, surrounded by equally beau-
tiful palaces, this square was the center of Verona’s government during its
heyday. The Palazzo del Governo is where Cangrande della Scala (one of
the first Scaligeri) extended the shelter of his hearth and home to the flee-
ing Florentine poet Dante Alighieri. A marble statue of Dante stands in the
center of the square in memory. The Palazzo della Ragione, on the south
Chapter 17: Padua, Verona, and Milan 363

side of the piazza, was built in 1123 but underwent changes many times in
later centuries, including receiving a Renaissance facade in 1524. From its
courtyard rises a medieval tower, the majestic Torre dei Lamberti
(84m/277 ft.), also called the Torre del Comune. An elevator takes you to
the top, where the views are magnificent. On the north side of the piazza
is the 15th-century Loggia del Consiglio, which was the town council’s
meeting place; it’s surmounted by five statues of famous Veronese citizens,
and five arches lead into Piazza dei Signori.
See map p. 359. Torre dei Lamberti: Cortile Mercato Vecchio. % 045-8032726.
Admission: Oct–May1.50€ ($1.80), elevator 0.60€ (72¢); June–Sept 2.10€ ($2.50) and
includes Arche Scaligere, elevator 0.50€ (60¢). Open: Tues–Sun 9:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.;
Mon 1:45–7:30 p.m. Ticket booth closes 30 minutes earlier.
Piazza delle Erbe
This has been the seat of the market since Roman times — it was built on
top of the Forum — and today, Veronese shoppers and vendors still mill
about, surrounded by Renaissance palaces. The lively market should not
distract you from the beauty of this piazza, graced in the center by the
Berlina — a canopy supported by four columns where the election of 
the town’s signore (elected prince) and the podestà (the governor) took
place — and surrounded by medieval palazzi: the early-14th-century Casa
dei Mercanti (House of the Merchants), restructured in 1870 to restore
its original 1301 form; the baroque Palazzo Maffei; the adjacent Torre del
Gardello, a tower built in 1370; and the Casa Mazzanti, another Scaligeri
palazzo, decorated with frescoes. On the north side is a 14th-century foun-
tain flanked by the venerated Madonna Verona, which is actually a
restored Roman statue.
See map p. 359. Intersection of Via Mazzini and Via Cappello.
More cool things to see and do
 The small Casa di Giulietta (Juliet’s House), at Via Cappello 23 
(% 045-8034303; Admission: 3.50€/$4.20; Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–
7:30 p.m., Mon 1:30–7:30 p.m.), is an original 12th-century house that
the city bought in 1905 and turned into a tourist attraction (the
famous balcony was added in 1935). Shakespeare’s Capulets and
Montagues (from his play Romeo and Juliet) were indeed versions of
two historical Veronese families, the Capuleti (or Cappello) and the
Montecchi. No proof exists that a family of Capulets ever lived in this
house, but that doesn’t stop people from flocking here to see the 
balcony where Juliet would have stood, if she’d been here at all.
Tradition calls for you to rub the right breast of the bronze statue 
of Juliet for good luck. Of course, you can’t have a Juliet without a
Romeo, and there’s a so-called Casa di Romeo (House of Romeo) at
Via Arche Scaligere 2 (east of Piazza dei Signori), a 13th-century
house that is said to have been the home of the Montecchi family. It
now contains a small, cute restaurant, the Osteria del Duca (% 045-
594474), serving excellent Veronese fare for lunch and dinner

 The Fresco Museum and Juliet’s Tomb are housed in the 13th-
century complex of San Francesco al Corso (Via Shakespeare; 
% 045-8000361). It was inaugurated in 1935 with the display of a
sarcophagus that, according to legend, holds the bodies of Romeo
and Juliet. The museum displays an interesting collection of fres-
coes from a number of buildings in Verona, as well as 19th-century
sculptures. The church of San Francesco has several paintings from
the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries and a large collection of Roman
amphoras in the vaults. The complex is open Monday from 1:45 to
7:30 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
Admission is 3€ ($3.60) per person; free the first Sunday of each

6 p.m., Sun and holidays 1–6 p.m., Nov–Feb Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–1 p.m.
and 1:30–4 p.m., Sun and holidays 1–5 p.m.) is Verona’s largest
church. Built between 1290 and 1481, it is graced by an unfinished
Gothic facade adorned by a beautiful arched portal and an ornate
campanile. Although the architecture (rather than the contents of
the church) is its noblest feature, the Cappella Giusti does contain
a Pisanello fresco of San Giorgio pictured with a princess, while the
Cappella Pellegrini has terra-cotta works by Michele da Firenze.
 If you’ve ever wondered what an Italian garden should really 
look like, visit the Giardino Giusti (Via Giardino Giusti 2; % 045-
8034029). Built in the 14th century and given its current layout in
the 16th, this Renaissance garden has survived more or less intact
over centuries, and is now one of the most famous in Italy. Crossed
by a main alley lined with cypress trees, the garden is embellished
with grottoes, statues, and fountains. From a balcony at one end of
the garden, you can enjoy a panoramic view of the city. It’s open
daily in summer, from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., and until sunset in winter;
admission is 5€ ($6).

Milan: Italy’s Business and Fashion Center
As the economic heart of northern Italy — Italy’s main industrial and
manufacturing region — the city’s charm as a tourist destination is tar-
nished by its fast-paced modern Milanese lifestyle and its inclement
weather, which includes much fog in winter and steamy heat in summer.
Still, Milan is a city of art, with deep historical roots, and it’s home to
several gems — including one of the best art galleries in Italy — making
it well worth a detour. You can see the highlights in one day, but we rec-
ommend spending the night if you can spare the time.
Getting there
Milan’s international airport of Malpensa (% 02-74852200), located
50km (31 miles) north of the city, has the dubious distinction of being
called “the worst airport in Europe,” but that’s mainly due to the fre-
quent fog that causes significant delays. In winter, Italians try to avoid
flying to this airport. If you do land here, you can take the frequent
(every 30 minutes) Malpensa Express Train to the Cadorna train sta-
tion, a 40-minute ride, or the shuttle bus (every 40 minutes) to the
Milano Centrale train station, a 50-minute ride. Count on spending over
70€ ($84) for a taxi ride, which, depending on traffic, could take you
over an hour.
The smaller Linate Airport (% 02-74852200) is only 10km (61⁄4 miles)
east of the city and has far fewer delays; it handles some European and
most domestic flights. From here, it’s a 15-minute taxi ride to the center
of town. If you have no luggage, you can take the frequent (every ten
minutes) city bus (no. 73) to the M1 subway line.
Milan is easy to reach by train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it): The
trip from Rome lasts about five hours — or four hours on the faster busi-
ness train that makes two trips daily — and costs about 40€ ($48). Most
long-distance trains arrive at Milano Centrale, on Piazza Duca d’Aosta.

We do not recommend driving to Milan: Although plenty of autostrade
lead to the city, it’s an absolute nightmare of traffic at most times, and
safe parking garages are expensive (do not leave your car on the street
for lengthy stays). If you need to, take the exit MILANO CENTRO for the his-
toric district — and good luck.
Getting around
Milan’s historic district is not huge, but it’s still quite large, and you’ll
have to use some form of transportation to visit the attractions. Besides
taxis, which are as good as in any other busy city, you’ll want to use
buses and trams — convenient, but slow in traffic — or the metro
(subway), which is the fastest and simplest means of getting around.
Buses, trams, and subways use the same tickets, which are sold at news-
stands, tobacconists, and bars. A 75-minute ticket costs 1€ ($1.20), but
you can also buy a carnet of ten tickets for 9.20€ ($11), a one-day travel
card for 3€ ($3.60), or a two-day travel card for 5.50€ ($6.60). Pick up a
public transportation map from the transportation authority’s informa-
tion booth inside the Duomo subway station (% 800-808181; www.
atm-mi.it; open Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m.–8 p.m.).
Spending the night
As Italy’s business center, Milan has many hotels. Mostly geared toward
business travelers, they tend to offer good weekend deals.
Antica Locanda Leonardo

Center
This is a gem: a small, family-run hotel where you’ll get individual attention
and great accommodations at moderate rates, right in the center of it all.
Housed in a 19th-century building overlooking a courtyard garden — 
perfect for a relaxing moment, especially in spring when the wisteria is in
flower — it offers guest rooms done in classic style with period themes
ranging from Liberty to rococo to modern. You’ll find two computers with
Internet access for hotel guests’ use. Make sure you reserve in advance, as
this hotel is not so secret anymore.

it boasts frescoes, marble floors, and convenient proximity to the chic

witness his perfect saffron risotto and superb roasted meats — but also in
creating new dishes with a unique mix of flavors and textures, such as the

This wonderful place is one of the best restaurants in Milan: Using simple
yet excellent ingredients (personally chosen by the chef from small local
producers throughout Italy), the chef prepares dishes that vary with the
seasons and his own whims. We loved the ricottine mantecate agli asparagi
(baby ricotta sautéed with asparagus), the zuppa etrusca profumata al
finocchio selvatico (vegetable and legume soup with wild fennel), and the
trio di pesce con tortino di melanzane (triglia, gallinella, and prawns with
eggplant torte). The small lunch tasting menu is 35€ ($42), while the

CREATIVE VEGETARIAN/SEAFOOD
The Swiss chef Pietro Leeman is on a mission: to promote his love for gour-
met vegetarian cuisine. He succeeds very well with this restaurant, as well
as with his classes and other special events. The menu is seasonal and
varied, including such concoctions as “the apparent egg and its taste”: two
pretend-eggs, one of white truffle and zucchini, the other of almonds and
nutmeg. We definitely recommend the tasting menus, which come in three
sizes: 13 courses for 95€ ($114), eight courses for 60€ ($72), and five

Brera Picture Gallery
Open since 1809 and housed in a beautiful 18th-century palace, this art
museum was started by the Austrian Hapsburgs in the late 18th century as
a small collection for the use of the students at the attached Art Academy.
During the Napoleonic period, however, it was vastly enlarged with artwork
confiscated by the French from museums as well as from the churches and
monasteries that were shut down all over northern Italy. This already-rich
art collection was further expanded with the addition of two private col-
lections of modern art. The gallery includes paintings by famous masters
from the 14th to the 18th centuries — such as the famous Pala di Urbino,
by Piero della Francesca; Sposalizio della Vergine, by Raffaello; Cristo
Morto, by Andrea Mantegna; and Cena di Emmaus, by Caravaggio — as
well as important 19th- and 20-century paintings by artists such as Carrà
and Morandi. The loggias and other halls of the palace also hide an impor-
tant collection of sculpture and artifacts.

Castello Sforzesco
This castle embraces centuries of Milanese history and ruling clans, from
small defensive rocca, built by the Visconti family in the 14th century, to
its enlargement as a palace by the Sforza family, who dominated Milan
during the Renaissance, and finally to its military development under the
Austrian domination of the Hapsburg. Badly damaged during the Italian
wars for independence in the 19th century, the castle seemed doomed, but
the powers that be finally decided to restore it to its original Renaissance
glory. Kids will love the storybook crenellated walls, the underground pas-
sages, and the towers.
The castello houses several museums. The Sculpture Museum, located in
the ducal public apartments, has a large collection ranging from Roman
times to the Renaissance, including the famous Pietà Rondanini by
Michelangelo, his last — and unfinished — work, finally visible again after
a lengthy restoration and cleaning. The Picture Gallery, located in the
ducal private apartments, holds a collection of Italian art from the 13th to
the 18th centuries, including the Madonna in Gloria con Santi, by Andrea
Mantegna, and the San Benedetto, by Antonello da Messina. Also on the
premises is a great collection of arms and armor, along with a museum of
musical instruments dating from the 15th to the 19th centuries.
Underground is the archaeological collection.

Duomo and Museo del Duomo
This grandiose cathedral — second in Italy only to St. Peter’s — covers
about 10,034 sq. m (108,000 sq. ft.) and is 107m (356 ft.) high. Its con-
struction lasted for centuries: Founded in 1386, the facade was completed
at the beginning of the 19th century, and the last bronze portal was done
in 1965. Its exterior is decorated with about 3,400 statues and 135 marble
spires; its 1,394 sq. m (15,000 sq. ft.) of windows feature around 3,600 dif-
ferent characters. Some of the best artists of all periods participated in
the project, a history illustrated by the very interesting collection in the
Museo del Duomo. The museum is on the first floor of the Royal Palace,
by the cathedral, and houses a huge collection of artwork assembled over
the centuries of construction and ongoing restoration, including Gesù al
Tempio, by Tintoretto. An important sculpture collection is organized
chronologically and offers a unique panorama of Italian work from the late
14th to the 19th centuries. There is also a fascinating array of stained-glass
windows. The baptistery is from the fourth century.

Santa Maria delle Grazie and Leonardo’s Last Supper
Built in the 15th century, this church was supposed to be the burial place of
Ludovico il Moro and his descendants; the beautiful sculpted cover for the
tomb is still here. But it’s not tombs that draw tourists from all over the
world: In the refectory of the church is the famous Ultima Cena, or Last
Supper, by Leonardo da Vinci. It was painted by the master with an experi-
mental technique (tempera over a plaster preparation) over four years of
work between 1494 and 1498. The fresco was already looking quite bad by
the end of the 16th century, so it required continuous repainting and restora-
tion during the following centuries. The most recent restoration lasted 20
years and was completed in 1999; it removed the many previous restora-
tions, revealing Leonardo’s original work. Unfortunately, there are many
gaps, but what remains is still a wonderful example of artistic achievement.
Audio guides are available. Note: You need to reserve entry at least 24 hours
in advance; you can do so by going to the Web site listed below.

More cool things to see and do
 Originally built in 386 by the Roman Magistrate Ambrogio on the
burial site of two martyrs, Gervaso and Protaso, the Basilica di
Sant’Ambrogio is the church of Milan’s patron saint and an inter-
esting example of Romanesque church (Piazza S. Ambrogio 15; 
% 02-86450895; Metro: M2 S. Ambrogio; Admission: Church free,
museum 2€/$2.40; Open: Church daily 9 a.m.–12:30 p.m. and 3:30–
5 p.m.; museum Wed–Sun 10 a.m. to noon and 3–5 p.m.; closed Aug).
Under the main altar is a ninth-century masterpiece housing the
church’s relics and decorated with scenes from the life of Jesus in
gold, toward the front, and the life of St. Ambrose in silver, toward
the back. You can still view the remains of the two martyrs, along
with those of Ambrogio. The chapel of San Vittore in Ciel d’Oro, in
the apse, is the only visible part of the church that dates from the
fifth century. The Museum of the Basilica, recently reopened after a
complete overhaul, is also worth a visit. Of particular interest is the
Urna degli Innocenti, a jewelry masterpiece from the 15th century,
and a stucco portrait of Saint Ambrose from the 11th century.
 Among the many other museums of Milan, you may enjoy visiting
the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana (Piazza Pio XI; % 02-806921; www.
ambrosiana.it; Metro: M1 or M3 to Duomo), the oldest museum
in town (opened in 1618). The art collection here includes the
Canestra, by Caravaggio; Madonna del Padiglione, by Botticelli; 
and Musico, by Leonardo — although this last attribution is under
debate. It’s open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
(last entrance one hour earlier); admission is 7.50€ ($9).

this section) is a landmark in the history of Milan and of Italian

interesting Museo Teatrale della Scala, in Palazzo Busca, near
Leonardo’s Last Supper (Corso Magenta 71; % 02-4691528; Metro:

Duomo), a beautiful construction of wrought iron and glass cover-
ing four streets, built in the 1870s. Under the elegant canopy, you’ll
find a number of shops, cafes, and small boutiques.
Shopping the local stores
The heart of Italy’s fashion industry, Milan means prêt-à-porter galore. The
most famous shopping street for clothing and accessories is the world-
renowned Via Montenapoleone, the fashion heart of Milan. Also worthy
are the nearby streets of Via della Spiga and Via Sant’Andrea. Here, you’ll
find all kinds of shops and boutiques along with some of the top names of
Italian fashion (Valentino and Versace are on Via Montenapoleone, Dolce
& Gabbana is on nearby Corso Venezia, and Armani is on Via Manzoni).
The shopping district, which now contains more down-to-earth retail as
well, has spilled over all the way to Piazza Duomo.
If you aren’t interested in haute couture, another excellent shopping
area is the Brera district. In its back streets — Via Solferino, Via
Madonnina, Via Fiori Chiari, and so on — you’ll find elegant boutiques,
with many designer names (including the young and trendy); antiques
and bric-a-brac stores; and open-air market stalls. On the third Saturday
of each month, the stretch of Via Brera near La Scala houses a large
open-air market of antiques and knickknacks.
Finally, if you have the time and you’re a keen shopper, you can head for
Corso Buenos Aires, off Piazza Oberdan, for everything from designer
clothes to scuba equipment.
Chapter 17: Padua, Verona, and Milan 375
Outlets, please
If you aren’t visiting during sale periods (Jan and July), you may want to hit a few dis-
count stores or outlets. Such places often sell the previous season’s looks and items
that have been worn on the runways. The discounts are excellent, though, and the
atmosphere often competitive. D Magazine Outlet is right on Via Montenapoleone, at
no. 26 (% 02-76006027). Others are a bit farther away, such as Biffi (Corso Ganova 6;
% 02-8311601; Metro: San Ambrogio), which specializes in women’s wear in the main
store and men’s across the street. Another recommended shop — far from a secret
anymore, unfortunately — is Il Salvagente (Via Bronzetti 16; % 02-76110328), with a
large array of women clothes. There’s also a small children’s section at Via Balzaretti
28 (% 02-26680764; Metro: San Babila).

Living it up after dark
For opera fans, attending a performance at the grand Teatro della Scala
(Piazza della Scala; % 02-72003744; www.teatroallascala.org) is an
unforgettable experience. After three years of renovations, this grand
theater reopened its doors in 2004 and is now better than ever: with
wonderful acoustics, movable high-tech stages, and 200 additional seats.
You’ll need to reserve tickets well in advance. Prices range from 10€ to
90€ ($12–$108).
Fine classical music can be heard at the Conservatorio (Via del
Conservatorio 12; % 02-7621102); ticket prices range from 15€ to 
35€ ($18–$42).
For a simpler evening out, head for one of the two major nightlife desti-
nations in Milan. The more elegant Brera district gives a taste of trendy
“Old Milan,” with narrow streets and alleys. It used to be the artsy neigh-
borhood of Milan, but of late it has become much more classy and estab-
lished; expect sleek joints and stylish restaurants. The more casual
Ticinese/Navigli district is a charming neighborhood of narrow streets
and canals (although most of them have been paved over), lying to the
southwest of the city center. Places here are open late and attract a
more mixed crowd, with lots of trendy bars, small restaurants, clubs
with live music, and hangouts for young people.
Enoteche (wine bars) abound in Milan. You can drink a glass — or a
bottle — of excellent wine and accompany it with a tasty bite to eat. 
One of the most elegant is Sadler Wine & Food (Via Monte Bianco 2A;
% 02-4814677; Metro: Amendola Fiera). Our favorites include Cotti (Via
Solferino 42; % 02-29001096; open until the wee hours); Ronchi (Via 
S. Vincenzo 12; % 02-89402627), which also has a wine museum; and
Enoteca Wine & Chocolate (Foro Buonaparte 63; % 02-862626), which
features chocolate tastings as well.
Club Due (Via Formentini 2; % 02-86464807; Metro: Lanza; Open: Daily)
has a pleasant piano bar upstairs and a disco in the basement. If dance
clubs are your thing, also try Hollywood (Corso Como; % 02-6598996;
Metro: Garibaldi or Moscova; Open: Tues–Sun) for some of the hottest
sounds in town. For an elegant nostalgic atmosphere, head to Gimmi’s
(Via Cellini 2; % 02-55188069; Open: Thurs–Tues), where after-dinner
dancing is to tunes from the 1960s and ’70s (jacket required).
Milan is also the center of Italy’s gay scene. The most established gay
disco is Nuova Idea International (Via de Castillia 31; % 02-69007959;
Metro Garibaldi; closed Mon). A popular disco and restaurant — with
straight folks as well — is the mostly lesbian After Line (Via Sammartini
25; % 02-6692130; Open: Daily). The G-lounge (Via Larga 8; % 02-805-
3042) is a trendy disco/bar with quality music.

Naples, Pompeii,

In this part . . . 
N
aples is the capital of Campania, the beautiful region
south of Rome. Campania is in many ways the heart of
Italy — warm, welcoming, and mysterious. Its natural beauty
has been famous since antiquity, and its history has made it a
treasure-trove of ﬁne art.
Chapter 18 covers the best of Naples, a city that borrows
some of its character from Mount Vesuvius — the unpre-
dictable volcano in whose shadow the city lies — and is ebul-
lient with cultural happenings and treasures. Naples opens
onto the most beautiful gulf in Italy: Chapter 19 guides you 
to excursions along these shores and beyond, including the
splendid Royal Palace of Caserta, the picturesque Greek and
Roman ruins in the Campi Flegrei, and Vesuvius, with its ring
of ancient Roman towns that were violently and instantly
destroyed by the volcanic eruption in A.D. 79. Finally, in
Chapter 20, we explore the most beautiful area of all: the
Sorrento Peninsula, with the mythical isle of Capri at its tip,
and the most celebrated stretch of Italian coast, the justly
renowned AmalﬁCoast. All have entranced the artistic and
well-to-do since the Roman Emperor Tiberius rioted in Capri
with his playthings.

In This Chapter
 Finding your way to and around Naples
 Choosing where to stay and where to eat
 Discovering art treasures and unique views
 Soaking up the Neapolitan atmosphere and activities
I
f you look past the daunting traffic and noise of Naples, you’ll find a
seductive place — rich in art, churches, historic sites, and character —
and one of the most vital cities anywhere. In a sense, if you haven’t seen
Naples, you haven’t seen Italy. After the cultural renaissance begun in the
1990s, the historic district of Naples welcomes its visitors as never before,
revealing again to our astounded eyes its many treasures. Refurbished
monuments and areas reclaimed for pedestrians make it a very enjoyable
destination.
Try not to visit Naples as a day trip: It’s possible to see the highlights in
a day, but if you can, take the time to explore this vivid, intense city by
spending a couple of nights. Naples is also an excellent starting point for
exploring other nearby sites (see Chapters 19 and 20) and a perfect
jumping-off point for Sicily (see Chapters 21 and 22).
Getting There
Naples may feel a world apart from Rome or Florence, but logistically it
is easily reached by rail, air, sea, or road.
By air
The small but well-run Aeroporto Capodichino (% 081-7896259; www.
gesac.it) receives daily flights from Italian and other European desti-
nations, including connecting flights from the United States. Here are a
few tips for getting through the airport and to your hotel:
 Getting oriented at the airport: Capodichino is easy to navigate.
You’ll find a bank with ATM, a currency-exchange booth, and a
tourist information desk in the arrivals concourse.

 Navigating your way through passport control and Customs: As
most flights to Naples originate from within the European Union,
you probably will have passed through passport control at your
intermediate stop, in which case you’ll go directly to baggage claim
here and then go through Customs.
 Getting from the airport to your hotel: The airport is about 7km 
(4 miles) from the city center, only 15 minutes away. The easiest
way to get into town is by taking a taxi directly to your hotel; the
flat rate is 20€ ($23), plus gratuities. You can also arrange for a lim-
ousine pickup through your hotel, but you’ll have to pay about 35€
($42). A cheaper alternative is the shuttle bus (% 800-639525; www.
anm.it), which costs 3€ ($3.60). It stops on Corso Garibaldi near
the Napoli Centrale train station, as well as in Piazza Municipio, at
the heart of the historic district. Departures are every 30 minutes.
By train
If you take one of the four daily high-speed trains from Rome, you’ll be in
Naples in only 87 minutes; other trains take about two and a half hours
(% 892021; www.trenitalia.it). Trains from Rome to Naples depart
often — nearly every hour — and cost about 20€ ($24). The trip from
Florence takes about four and a half hours and costs about 35€ ($42),
while the trip from Venice takes seven and a half hours and costs 50€
($60). Trains arrive at Napoli Centrale, also known as Stazione Centrale
(Piazza Garibaldi; % 081-5543188), on the northeastern edge of the 
historic district. Outside the station, you’ll find taxis and public 
transportation.
By ferry or ship
Naples’s harbor is the major port of central Italy, with ferries and cruise
ships stopping on their way to and from Capri and Sicily (see Chapters
20 and 21 for rates and schedules) and other Italian islands, as well as
international destinations in the Mediterranean and beyond. Arriving by
water is the best way to approach Naples: You will get the full effect of
the magical beauty of the bay, and you will arrive in the heart of town,
where most of the attractions lie. Most ships and ferries arrive at the
Stazione Marittima seaport, off Via Cristoforo Colombo in the heart of
the historic district. Other ferries and most hydrofoils arrive at the
Terminal Aliscafi in Mergellina, to the west of the historic district.
You’ll see taxis and public transportation right outside the terminal.
By car
The aggressive driving style in Naples makes taking a car into town chal-
lenging, even for Italians, and we do not recommend it. Also, Naples is
infamous for car theft, including from guarded parking lots. If you think
you need a car to explore farther destinations such as the Amalfi Coast,
think again — and see Chapter 20 for better options.

Orienting Yourself in Naples
Historically and geographically turned toward the sea — its high cliffs
surrounding a perfect harbor — Naples developed like a crescent
around its bay. Up the cliff is Vomero, and farther away to the northeast
is Capodimonte. Down by the sea is the historic district, with the città
antica (old city) at the heart, stretching from Piazza Garibaldi and the
Stazione Centrale train station to the east, to Via Toledo — the main
north–south street, lined with elegant palaces and fashionable shops,
and continuing with different names all the way up to Capodimonte — 
to the west. To the south is the seaside artery Via Cristoforo Colombo,
leading to the Stazione Marittima (Seaport). A main east–west street is
Via Benedetto Croce, which, along with its continuation Via Biagio dei
Librai, Neapolitans call Spacca Napoli (“Divide Naples”) — as these
divide the old city in two. Parallel to the north is Via dei Tribunali,
while parallel to the south runs Corso Umberto I — a major and noisy
shopping street.
West of Via Toledo is the Quartieri Spagnoli. To the south lies the civic
heart of Naples, with the town hall in Piazza Municipio and the two
former royal palaces: Castel Nuovo — built by the Angevins as the
center for their two-century-long kingdom — and Palazzo Reale, the
Royal Palace built for the Spanish rulers. Closed to traffic, Piazza del
Plebiscito (by Palazzo Reale and at the end of Via Toledo) is at the heart
of it all. West of the Stazione Marittima starts the fashionable waterfront,

Taxi tips in Naples
Neapolitans get a bad rap for trying to rip off tourists whenever the occasion presents
itself, and Gypsy cabs are largely to blame for it. Always and only use official taxis:
They’re white (the old yellow ones have mostly disappeared) and marked on the out-
side, while inside you’ll see a meter and a town license bearing the code number, as
well as a card with rates and a list of flat-rate destinations (20€/$23 from Capodichino
airport to hotels in the historic district; 9.50€/$11 from Piazza Municipio to Museo di
Capodimonte, and so on). If your ride is a flat-rate one, the meter will be turned off.
Regular rates are 4.15€ ($5) minimum charge, 2.60€ ($3.10) initial charge, plus .05€ (6¢)
for every 250 feet or 15 seconds. A 10 to 15 percent gratuity is expected, especially
since these rates have not gone up since 2002.
Although most licensed taxi drivers are honest, you can always happen upon a bad
apple who pretends his meter is broken in order to charge a little more. If this hap-
pens to you, take another cab. If you’re picked up at your hotel or at a restaurant, ask
your concierge or waiter for an estimate of what a reasonable fare may be to your
destination, and get a quote from the taxi driver before boarding: If it is not extravagant,
it is probably correct; if it doesn’t seem right, demand an explanation in order to avoid
surprises.

with the neighborhoods of Santa Lucia and Chiaia, followed by Posillipo
and Mergellina — two nice suburbs of Naples.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Capodimonte
Overlooking the bay from a separate hill, Capodimonte is a middle- and
lower-class residential neighborhood that developed to the west and
north of its major landmarks: the royal palace housing the Museo di
Capodimonte, with its park, and the nearby Catacombs, which are the
only reasons to come to this otherwise uninteresting area.
Chiaia
Stretching along Naples’s fashionable seafront, behind the pleasant green
of the beautiful Villa Comunale gardens, this elegant residential area
stretches up the slope toward the Vomero hill. Only a short distance from
the historic district, it is a major destination for chic shopping as well as
nightlife, especially along Via Chiaia and Piazza dei Martiri. Hotels are
few, and restaurants tend to cluster in the eastern area.
Città antica
Today the embodiment of “Neapolitanness” — laundry drying at win-
dows, mammas screaming at their kids down in the street, motor scoot-
ers rushing past, and so on — together with the Quartieri Spagnoli (later
in this chapter), this is the city’s heart. Along these streets are concen-
trated some of the most important attractions in Naples, particularly 
the churches — Duomo, Santa Chiara, Sant’Anna dei Lombardi, San
Lorenzo Maggiore — as well as the university, which attracts a lively
nightlife scene and rich cultural activity. Hotels tend to be on the south-
ern edge of the area, whereas restaurants and small shops abound.
Piazza del Plebiscito
The most beautiful piazza in Naples, this is where Neapolitans, young
and old, like to meet, especially in the evening. Called il salotto — the
living room — it is a short distance from everything important in the
city: the Stazione Marittima, Teatro San Carlo, the administrative and
political offices of Piazza Municipio, and the restaurants and nightlife of
Quartieri Spagnoli, città antica, Chiaia (Piazza dei Martiri is only steps
away), and Santa Lucia. Off the piazza itself are a few cafes.
Piazza Garibaldi
At the eastern edge of the città antica, this is a huge square that’s the
major transportation hub: Napoli Centrale train station is here, as well
as many bus lines, the subway, and, nearby, the Circumvesuviana rail-
road to Pompeii and other destinations (see Chapter 19). Very busy with
locals and visitors, it is only a short distance from some major attrac-
tions and offers hotels, restaurants, and many shops. It gets a bit seedy
at night, however.

Chapter 18: Naples 387

Quartieri Spagnoli
A tight grid of narrow streets built by the Spanish in the 16th century to
house their troops, this picturesque neighborhood lies along the west
side of Via Toledo, the main street in the heart of Naples. It offers an
excellent location near all major attractions, as well as a few very nice
restaurants and hotels.
Santa Lucia
Famous for its elegant hotels along the promenade of Via Partenope
and the picturesque view over the bay, this small neighborhood feels a
bit secluded from the rest of Naples — yet it’s only steps from every-
thing. Its landmark is the city’s most famous sight, Castel dell’Ovo, the
fortress built on a small island at the end of a causeway and stretching
into the bay.
Vomero
The hill of the Vomero is an elegant, middle- and upper-class residential
neighborhood. The fresher air and the views attract visitors, especially
in the summer, and you’ll find some good shopping and limited nightlife.
Its landmarks are the famous Castel Sant’Elmo and the Certosa di San
Martino, as well as the lesser known but splendid Villa La Floridiana.
Finding information after you arrive
The best tourist information offices in town are at Via San Carlo (Via
San Carlo 9, off Piazza del Plebiscito; % 081-402394; www.inaples.it)
and Piazza del Gesù (% 081-5512701), both open Monday through
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 to 7 p.m. You’ll also find a
small tourist info desk inside Stazione Centrale (Piazza Garibaldi; 
% 081-268799; Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m.), but it tends to have 
limited material.
Getting Around Naples
Naples is a large, bustling city, and although you won’t be interested in
the suburbs, you’ll welcome some form of transportation to get from
one attraction to the next.
The historic district of Naples is safe, but you will want to watch your
purse and your belongings carefully, especially in crowded situations:
pickpockets and purse-snatchers are a sad — and abundant — reality. At
night, avoid poorly lit and deserted streets; muggers are rare, but unfor-
tunately do exist.
On foot
You can cover a lot of ground on foot, and Naples offers beautiful walks,
particularly in Santa Lucia, Chiaia, and in the città antica, where some
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
388

sections have been reserved for pedestrians only. The free map from the
tourist office is good enough for most visitors, but if you want more
detail, get a map with a stradario (street directory) from any news-
stand; personally, we like the wallet sized Mini-City map, sold at the
bookshop of Palazzo Reale and other museums in town.
By subway, bus, funicular, and tram
Public transportation in Naples (% 800-482644 in Italy; www.ctpn.it)
is good and extensive, but gets rather crowded at rush hour. You can
choose between two metropolitana (subway) lines — the faster one
runs daily from 5 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. There are also three funivia (funicu-
lar, or cable car) lines that go up and over the hills: Montesanto, which
runs daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Chiaia, at Piazza Amedeo, Monday
through Thursday from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Friday through Sunday from
7 a.m. to 1 a.m.; and Centrale, at Via Toledo, daily from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m.
You can also take advantage of the several bus and tram lines. Trams
fare a bit better against city traffic, but they’re still the slowest from of
transportation; also, after 8:30 p.m. many lines run only hourly, if at all.
The most convenient are the special “tourist” bus lines marked R, which
stop at major attractions (daily 5:30 a.m. to midnight), and the electric
minibuses serving the città antica.
All public transportation uses the same tickets: the regular biglietto
(ticket), valid for unlimited travel for 90 minutes at a cost of 1€ ($1.20);
and the giornaliero (day pass), valid for unlimited travel for one day at
a cost of 3€ ($3.60). You can buy them at bars, tobacconists, and news-
stands around town.
By taxi
Taxis are a great resource: You may have to put up with colorful lan-
guage and reckless driving to avoid traffic jams, but at least you’ll be
comfortably seated. Taxis do not cruise around as in New York, though,
so you’ll have to walk to a taxi stand to find one, or else call for pickup
(see “Fast Facts: Naples,” at the end of this chapter). Refer to the sidebar
“Taxi tips in Naples,” earlier in this chapter, for rates.
Staying in Style
Naples is a cheaper destination than Rome, Florence, or Venice, so you
will be able to treat yourself to a higher caliber of hotel — which is a
good thing, as some of the hotels are still quite old-fashioned. Overall,
though, the lodging choices here are getting up to par with international
standards.

The top hotels
Grand Hotel Parker’s
$$$$
Chiaia
In competition with the Grand Hotel Vesuvio, below, for the title of best in
Naples, this hotel offers a superb vantage point — on the slopes above
Riviera di Chiaia — and a unique charm: Dating from 1870, its neoclassical
interior and ornate Liberty (Italian Art Nouveau) plasterwork and deco-
rations have been completely preserved and restored. The large, elegant
guest rooms are decorated in period furniture — several with original
pieces — and the best units afford grand views of the beautiful bay. The
elegant marble bathrooms offer all the amenities you would expect. The
roof garden houses George’s (see “Dining Out,” later in this chapter).

Grand Hotel Vesuvio
$$$$
Santa Lucia
The best in town and the most renowned, this elegant historic hotel offers
attentive, professional service and splendid views of Mount Vesuvius or the
bay of Naples, with Castel dell’Ovo in the foreground. The bright and spa-
cious guest rooms are individually decorated, some with antiques, others
with stylish modern furniture, and still others with a mix of antiques and
good-quality reproductions. All have large marble bathrooms with Jacuzzi
tubs. The suites and the most expensive doubles have balconies — but you
can enjoy the same breathtaking view from the excellent roof-garden restau-
rant, Caruso.

Hotel Miramare
$$
Santa Lucia
Built in 1914 as a private villa, this charming hotel right on the water offers
bright guest rooms with beautiful bathrooms, decorated with quality
modern furniture — and many with views of the sea. Recently renovated,
this villa was the American consulate before being converted into a hotel.
The public areas are still decorated in the original Liberty style. Breakfast
is served on a terrace overlooking the bay, while a second panoramic ter-
race is used as a solarium. Guests here receive a 10 percent discount at the
nearby La Cantinella restaurant (see “Dining Out,” later in this chapter).

Hotel Rex
$
Santa Lucia
The Rex is well known (read: reserve well in advance) as a moderately
priced hotel in the waterside neighborhood of Santa Lucia. It offers simply
but carefully decorated guest rooms, some with a view of the harbor or
Vesuvio, and all with private balconies. Housed in a 19th-century palace,
most rooms and bathrooms are good-sized; in contrast to its lavish exte-
rior, the furnishings are simple (many rooms are decorated in a 1960s
style) but in good repair. A very nice breakfast is served in your room.

Il Convento
$
Quartieri Spagnoli
Housed in a 17th-century palace in the heart of Naples, this hotel offers
carefully restored guest rooms and public spaces at a moderate price.
Guest rooms have pastel plaster walls and quality modern furniture. Some
rooms have wooden beams, while others have arches or private roof gar-
dens; the two family rooms are duplexes with a loft.

Palazzo Alabardieri
$$
Chiaia
A great addition to the Naples lodging scene, this hotel is housed in an ele-
gant 19th-century palazzo with an inner courtyard garden and elegant
marble floors in the public spaces. Guest rooms are spacious and done up
with all the amenities, including hardwood floors and stylish furnishings
mixed with period pieces. The good-sized bathrooms are clad in marble.

Città Antica
Located between the university and the harbor, this
recently opened hotel is within sight of the Angioino castle. Housed in a
beautiful restored 19th-century building, the Mercure is both modern and
convenient, offering simple rooms with large beds and carpeting; one floor
is nonsmoking. See map p. 386. Via Depretis 123. % 081-552-9500. Fax: 081-552-

Piazza Garibaldi
After a complete overhaul, this elegant hotel near
Napoli Centrale train station has become one of the most attractive in
town, offering commodious rooms with all the comforts. Accommodations
are modern, with carpeting, wood accents, and stylish furniture.
Bathrooms are good-sized. The roof-garden bar is popular for drinks
among elegant Neapolitans and visitors alike. See map p. 386. Piazza Garibaldi

Villa Capodimonte
$$
Capodimonte
The appeal of this hotel is the great location near the
Museo di Capodimonte, the beautiful views, and the private garden, which
make it well insulated from the surrounding neighborhood. Guest rooms
are large and furnished in classic style, with wooden floors and good-sized
modern bathrooms. All open onto a terrace or the hotel’s garden, making
this a great choice if you have children. See map p. 386. Via Moiariello 66. 
% 081-459000. Fax: 081-299344. www.villacapodimonte.it.
Dining Out
We love the food in Naples — it is as sunny as the city and its people (see
Chapter 2 for more on Neapolitan cuisine). You’ll find plenty of both tradi-
tional and trendy restaurants here. The best places to browse for yourself
are Via Partenope, in Santa Lucia, and the narrow streets around Piazza
dei Martiri, in Chiaia.
Antonio e Antonio
$$
Santa Lucia
NEAPOLITAN/PIZZA
The location is perfect, right along Via Partenope overlooking the pictur-
esque Borgo Marinari, in the shadow of Castel dell’Ovo. The food is equally
good at this popular restaurant. You’ll find everything from seafood to
meat to pizza (40 different varieties) on the seasonal menu. Everything is
freshly made: We particularly recommend the buffet of appetizers, the
scialatielli ai frutti di mare (fresh pasta with seafood), and the polipetti in
cassuola (small squid stewed with tomatoes).
See map p. 386. Via Partenope 24. % 081-2451987. Reservations recommended. Bus:
C25, 140, 152. Secondi: 6€–17€ ($7.20–$20). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily 12:30–
3:30 p.m. and 7:30–11:30 p.m.
Brandi
$
Quartieri Spagnoli
PIZZA
Literally fit for a queen, this pizzeria opened in the 19th century and is the
place where pizza margherita was invented. It takes its name from
Margherita di Savoia, first queen of Italy, who graciously accepted having
a pizza named after her (how many sovereigns can say that?). Her name-
sake pizza comes with tomato, basil, and mozzarella — red, green, and
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
392

white, not coincidentally the colors of the united Italy. Brandi’s menu
includes a few appetizers — such as an excellent impepata di cozze (mus-
sels stewed with black pepper) — as well as pizza.
See map p. 386. Salita Sant’Anna di Palazzo 1. % 081-416928. Reservations recom-
mended. Bus: R2 or R3 to Piazza Trieste e Trento. Pizza: 7€–18€ ($8.40–$22). No credit
cards accepted. Open: Tues–Sun 12:30–3:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. to midnight.
Ciro a Santa Brigida
$$
Città Antica
NEAPOLITAN
This famous historic restaurant offers excellent food and professional
service. The extensive menu — accompanied by an equally extensive wine
list — includes the best dishes of the Neapolitan region, all prepared with
attention to detail and the freshest ingredients. In addition to its home-
made pastas and daily fish dishes, this place is known for its fritti (deep-
fried specialties) and for the quality and variety of traditional vegetable
contorni. It also serves excellent pizza and a large selection of desserts.
See map p. 386. Via Santa Brigida 71, off Via Toledo and the Galleria Umberto I.

$$$
Città Antica
NEAPOLITAN/SEAFOOD
In the welcoming atmosphere of this historic dining room, the chef offers
tasty choices inspired by local traditions. We recommend the zuppa di can-
nellini e cozze (bean and mussel soup) and the pasta e patate con provola
(pasta and potatoes with melted local cheese), as well as the scorfano all’
acquapazza (scorpion-fish in a light herbed broth). The pizzas are also
very good. Leave room for the great traditional desserts such as the babà
(like a liquor-soaked brioche with a dollop of pastry cream) and the
pastiera (tart filled with a creamy wheat-berry and candied-fruit mixture).

CREATIVE NEAPOLITAN
Housed on the Art Nouveau Grand Hotel Parker’s roof terrace, this is the
best and most elegant restaurant in Naples. Come here to enjoy creative
regional cuisine and magnificent views — while being pampered in sheer
luxury. The menu is seasonal, and the acclaimed Chef Baciot (Vincenzo
Bacioterracino) adds his creative touches to the simplest — and best —
traditional ingredients. We loved the zucchini napoleon and the grilled

a true love for cooking and good ingredients. The pizza is some of the best
you’ll taste in Naples, the dough prepared according to a century-old family
secret recipe, but we also recommend the other dishes on the menu. The
soup changes daily and is always tasty, as are the pasta dishes — such as
splendid spaghetti with zucchini, tomatoes, and olives.

Piazza del Plebiscito
NEAPOLITAN/PIZZA
With a view of the grand buildings of the Piazza Plebescito, and with out-
door dining in good weather, this is a nice place to sample the city’s great-
est culinary contribution at moderate prices. In addition to fine brick-oven
pizza, the menu includes a full range of antipasti and vegetable dishes
served buffet-style. There’s a second location near the archaeological
museum (Piazza Dante 16, off Via Toledo), which is also open from
lunchtime until 1 a.m.

Sweet breaks
If you have a sweet tooth, try the local specialties (see Chapter 2 for details) at the
Pasticceria Scaturchio (Piazza San Domenico Maggiore 19; % 081-5516944; Bus: R2),
one of the oldest pastry shops in town, established in 1903. Besides wonderful pastries,
you may also want to sample the Ministeriale, a medallion of dark chocolate with a
liqueur cream filling. Another excellent spot is Caffetteria Pasticceria Gelateria G.
Mazzaro (Via Tribunali 359; % 081-459248; www.pasticceriamazzaro.it),
which serves not only splendid pastries but also excellent gelato.

Santa Lucia
NEAPOLITAN/CREATIVE/FISH
One of the best and most-loved restaurants in Naples, this waterfront spot
has plenty of style. It feels like a 1930s nightclub or something out of a
movie, but the food is pure Neapolitan, with excellent antipasto and grilled
seafood. Try the pappardelle “sotto il cielo di Napoli” (homemade pasta
with zucchini, prawns, and green tomatoes) and the excellent fritto misto
(deep-fried calamari, small fish, and shrimp). Do not forget the wine — the
selection is excellent — or the dessert (if you have the patience for the
lengthy preparation, choose the fantastic soufflé).

Pizzeria Di Matteo

Città Antica
PIZZA
At this hole-in-the-wall restaurant, you’ll find some of the most authentic
pizza in Naples. The place is far from elegant — the dining room upstairs
looks like a cafeteria — and the service minimal (you’d better make up
your mind fast, and don’t expect a menu), but the pizza is superb. It comes
in only a few basic styles, but all are good. We recommend the pizza fritta,
a Neapolitan traditional specialty: Two rounds of dough are filled with
tomatoes, ham, and cheese, and then deep-fried in a special copper skil-
let (you’ll see it downstairs as you enter).

Exploring Naples
If you plan to do some extensive sightseeing, we recommend the artecard
(% 800-600601 in Italy, or 06-39967650; www.campaniartecard.it). This
pass is a really good deal, granting unlimited public transportation, free
admission to two attractions, and a 50 percent discount at all other attrac-
tions on an extensive list that includes the major museums. It also gives
discounts at participating shops and entertainment venues. The artecard
comes in two versions: The 13€ ($16) “3 days Naples and Campi Flegrei”
is limited to the area of Naples and the Campi Flegrei (including the dedi-
cated Archeobus; see Chapter 19); while the 25€ ($30) “3 days all sites”
covers the whole region, including Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Paestum
(see Chapters 19 and 20). The card is for sale at all participating sites, as
well as at the Capodichino airport, the molo beverello (harbor), the train
station of Napoli Centrale, major hotels, and some news kiosks.

Discovering the top attractions
Declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1995, the historic district
of Naples is one of the richest art destinations in Italy.
Archaeological Museum
Città Antica
If you want to visit just one archaeological museum in Italy, make it this
one. Established in the 17th century, it is one of the world’s oldest antiq-
uity museums and one of the richest. Part of the astonishing collection is
actually embedded in the walls and floors of the palazzo, as that was the
style in the 17th century: Roman sculptures embellish the facade and
superb ancient Roman mosaics decorate the floors, all originals from
Pompeii, Herculaneum, and other archaeological excavations in the region.
The collection of Roman sculptures on the first floor is superb, with 
many Roman copies of original Greek masterpieces such as the Ercole
Farnese — a statue of Hercules copied from an original in bronze by
Lisippo from the fourth century B.C., which greatly influenced the artists
of the Renaissance — and the Toro Romano, a dramatic scene come to
life in marble that stands over 4m (13 ft.) high; it depicts the punishment
of the queen of Beotia from a Greek original of the second century B.C.
The mezzanine is dedicated to ancient Roman mosaics, the most won-
derful of all the huge one depicting the victory of Alexander the Great
over the Persians and found in the House of the Faun in Pompeii (see
Chapter 19). But the best is on the second floor, where you’ll find a unique
collection of ancient Roman paintings and frescoes — entire rooms from
Pompeii, Herculaneum, and other nearby sites have been reconstructed
here with the original frescoes (we love room 77, with a series of land-
scapes and the portrait of Saffo, a young girl). Famous already back in
Goethe’s day is the so-called Gabinetto Segreto (Secret Room): a collec-
tion of Roman erotica originals documenting the attitude toward sexuality
in Roman times (guilt-free and frank, to say the least). If you wish, you can
sign up for a guided tour at the ticket booth. Allow a couple of hours for
your visit; we recommend renting an audio guide (in English).
See map p. 386. Piazza Museo Nazionale 19. % 081-440166. Metro: Museo or Piazza
Cavour. Admission: 6.50€ ($7.80). Included on the artecard list. Audio guide: 4€

Carthusian Monastery of San Martino and Museum
Vomero
This wonderful monastery provides the perfect excuse to take the funicu-
lar and visit the Vomero neighborhood. Built in the 14th century and
enlarged in the 17th, it occupies a natural terrace at the edge of the cliff.
Its church is considered the most beautiful baroque church in Naples, deco-
rated with gorgeous marble floors and works of art. Now turned into a
museum, you can visit the Quarto del Priore, the elegant apartments
where the prior received the VIPs of the time; among the artwork here is
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
396

a Madonna by Pietro Bernini, the father of the great Gian Lorenzo. The
monastery centers around two beautiful cloisters, the imposing Chiostro
Grande — with a cemetery enclosure decorated with carvings of skulls —
and the smaller Chiostro dei Procuratori. From here, you can enter the
presepi (manger scenes) collection, a typical Neapolitan art form that
reached its peak in the 18th and 19th century but is still alive today (see
“Shopping the Local Stores,” later in this chapter). This collection includes
the most famous historic presepio, the Cuciniello created in 1879 using
figures and accessories by famous sculptors and architects from the 18th
century. The upper floors display a collection of artwork with Naples as a
subject, whereas the Gothic cellars contain the sculpture section.
Your admission includes the nearby Castel Sant’Elmo (Via Tito Angelini
20; % 081-5784030; Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.), the star-shaped 14th-
century fortress looking over the city (its daunting walls are visible from
everywhere downtown). Restored in the 16th century, it’s now open to visi-
tors who’d like to see its dungeons, halls, and terraces, affording 360-
degree views of the city and bay.

Admission: 6€ ($7.20); includes Castel Sant’Elmo. Included on the artecard list. Open:
Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.
Castel dell’Ovo
Santa Lucia
This is the most famous landmark in Naples, a picturesque fortress built
on a small promontory projecting into the beautiful harbor. In Roman
times, the celebrated gourmand Lucullus had his villa in this idyllic spot.
The villa was fortified during the Middle Ages, and from those times comes
the legend that Virgil (the poet author of the Aeneid and a reputed magi-
cian) placed a magic egg under the castle’s foundations to protect it, hence
the name (ovo means “egg”). When he took over the city, Frederick II trans-
formed it into his castle, and his successors, the Angevins, later enlarged
it. The castle is a fortified citadel, and from its walls you can enjoy a superb
view of the city and the surrounding bay. Today, it houses the Museum of
Ethno-History (% 081-2400055; admission varies, depending on the
exhibit; 10 percent discount with artecard; Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun
8:30 a.m.–2 p.m.), but at press time it was open only for special exhibits. If
you get to enter, do not miss the Sala delle Colonne (Hall of the Columns)
and the Loggiato, two architectural gems. Otherwise, limit your visit to
the picturesque Borgo Marinari — a fishermen’s hamlet that is now
mostly taken over by restaurants — and enjoy the view of the castle from
the beautiful promenade of Via Partenope.

Castel Nuovo and Civic Museum
Piazza Plebiscito
Built in the 13th century by Carlo d’Angió (Angevin dynasty) as the 
new royal residence — the Castel dell’Ovo didn’t fit the needs of the new
Chapter 18: Naples 397

kingdom — this castle was renovated in the 15th century by Alfonso I of
Aragona, who also added the grandiose Triumphal Arch over the inland
entrance to commemorate the expulsion of the Angevins at his hands in
1443. A splendid example of early Renaissance architecture, this is the
work of Francesco Laurana, the gifted Neapolitan sculptor. Inside, beyond
the courtyard and up the staircase, you’ll find the Sala dei Baroni (Barons’
Hall), a monumental room with a star-shaped ceiling that was once deco-
rated by Giotto (his frescoes have been lost, however). Most of the sculp-
tures that decorated the room were destroyed by fire in 1919. Today, the
hall is the seat of the Municipal Council.
The castle also houses the Civic Museum, through which you can visit the
Cappella Palatina, the chapel opening onto the castle’s courtyard and
dedicated to Santa Barbara. The church was built in 1307 — only the
carved portal and rose window are from the 15th century, replacing the
originals which were destroyed by an earthquake — and was also com-
pletely decorated by Giotto, but only a few fragments remain. The chapel
houses part of the museum’s collection: a series of 14th-century frescoes
from nearby churches and 15th-century sculptures, including Domenico
Gagini’s altarpiece of Madonna and child (Gagini was a pupil of Donatello
and Brunelleschi) and two Madonnas by Francesco Laurana. The
museum’s second and third floors contain the picture gallery — stretch-
ing from the 15th to the 20th century — with works by Luca Giordano and
Francesco Solimena, among many others.
See map p. 386. Piazza Municipio. % 081-7955877. Bus: R1 or R4. Admission: 5€ ($6).
Included on the artecard list. Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m.; Sun 9 a.m.–2 p.m.
Duomo and Museum
Città Antica
This grandiose church — also known as the Cathedral of Santa Maria
Assunta — hides a treasure-trove of artwork inside. The monumental cen-
tral body, built in the 13th century, is supported by 110 ancient granite
columns; in the right transept you’ll find Perugino’s Assunta and the
Cappella Minutolo, a Gothic marvel decorated with a mosaic floor and
frescoes. In the crypt below is the Cappella Carafa (also called Succorpo),
probably designed by the great Renaissance architect Bramante, and a
marvel of architectural elegance. To the right of the Duomo’s atrium opens
the Cappella di San Gennaro: A church more than a chapel, it is lavishly
decorated with marble and gold leaf — an apotheosis of Neapolitan
baroque — and a dome with a cycle of frescoes by Domenichino. If you
happen to visit on September 19th, on the first Sunday in May, or on
December 16th, you’ll see on display, over the main altar, the famous reli-
quary containing the skull and the vial with the blood of San Gennaro
(patron saint of Naples), which is said to miraculously liquefy on these
dates — it’s a sign of great misfortune for the whole town if the miracle
doesn’t take place. To the left of the Duomo’s atrium, you can access
what’s left of Santa Restituta, a paleo-Christian basilica from the sixth cen-
tury that was incorporated into the Duomo when this was built. Redone in
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
398

the 17th century, only one of its chapels is still decorated with the origi-
nal Renaissance artwork, the sixth to the left. The real attraction, though,
is its baptistery (entrance at the end of the nave to the right), which dates
back to the fourth century; it’s the world’s oldest Western baptistery and
is still decorated with beautiful fifth-century mosaics.
Attached to the Duomo is the entrance to the museum, which holds the
Treasure of San Gennaro, a stunning collection of precious artwork
donated to the saint throughout the centuries. The collection is so rich
that the museum has to show it on a rotating basis, changing the display
every year. From the museum, you can also visit the sacristy, with its beau-
tiful frescoes by Luca Giordano and paintings by Domenichino. Should you
find the doors to Santa Restituta and to the Cappella Minutolo closed, ask
here to arrange for a visit.

painting collection. The Farnese collection alone includes Masaccio’s
Crucifixion, Perugino’s Madonna and Child, Bruegel’s Misanthrope,

Neapolis
Born from two Greek colonies — Partenope, established in the seventh century B.C.
on the promontory behind Piazza del Plebiscito, and Neapolis, established 200 years
later in the area now called città antica — the city grew and thrived. First taken over
by the Sannites, it was annexed by the Romans by the third century B.C. The cultural
melting pot gave birth to the unique personality we can still witness today. Always
coveted for its splendid position, Naples passed under many rulers, first the Byzantines
and the Longobards, then the Normans and the Angevins (house of Anjou), then the
Spanish and finally the Bourbons. Made capital of the Southern Kingdom in 1266, 
it remained so until it became part of the new Italian Kingdom in 1860, and was
enriched with artistic monuments by each of its rulers. It then knew a period of deca-
dence that culminated in the 1980s, when most of its monuments were closed to the
public and dingy with accumulated dirt. A huge program of restoration and revitaliza-
tion brought about a cultural renaissance, resulting also in the ebullient artistic and
creative verve — especially in the field of music, but also in the performance and fig-
urative arts — we can witness today.

and works by several other masters, such as Mantegna, Raphael, Titian,
Caravaggio, and Botticelli. The nearby Borgia collection includes works by
Mantegna and a number of Spanish artists. The Neapolitan Gallery on the
third floor has more works by Titian (his Annonciation) and Caravaggio
(his Flagellation), among others; the adjacent D’Avalos collection includes
a celebrated 16th-century tapestry series depicting the Battle of Pavia.
The contemporary gallery on the third and fourth floors holds works by
Alberto Burri, Jannis Krounellis, Andy Warhol, and so on. We also recom-
mend a visit to the second floor’s royal apartments, which are full of price-
less objects, tapestries, and porcelain, including a whole room — the
salottino di porcellana — completely done in porcelain.

Palazzo Reale
Piazza Plebiscito
The imposing neoclassical Royal Palace was designed by Domenico
Fontana and built by the Bourbons in the 17th century; the eight statues
on the facade depicting Neapolitan kings were added in the 19th century.
The palazzo retains its glamour to this day, and was used as the venue 
for a G7 summit meeting in 1994. The royal apartments inside are quite
splendid — richly appointed with marble floors, tapestries, frescoes, and

Naples and the presepio
The dearest activity to Neapolitans is the making of manger scenes for Christmas. Far
from being a Christmas-only preoccupation, Neapolitans have turned this into an art
form — and the carving of figurines, as well as the preparation of details of the set-
ting, is the permanent activity of a number of reputed artists. These figurines are col-
lectors’ items now. People save to buy them — the ones dressed in original
18th-century fabrics are quite expensive — and think about their displays for months.
Unlike those crèches that are simply a little display of established characters,
Neapolitan versions are alive with the passions and happenings of the historical and
political present, and among the figures offered for sale, you will recognize such char-
acters as Lady Diana and Madre Teresa di Calcutta, and even Gianni Versace! Via San
Gregorio Armeno, in the città antica, is where most of the historic workshops are
located; you will find not only characters, but also rocks, grottoes, miniature pumps to
make “rivers,” miniature street lamps, and so on. A vividly painted figure or figurine —
some of them are life-size — can be a beautiful souvenir of Naples and Italy, but
remember that these carvings don’t come cheap: A shepherd dressed in 18th-century
clothes will be priced in the hundreds of dollars. See “Shopping the Local Stores,”
later in this chapter, for more information.

baroque furniture — and the chapel holds the splendid Presepio del
Banco di Napoli (manger scene), with characters carved by famous
Neapolitan sculptors in the 18th century. The palazzo’s most grandiose
rooms house the Vittorio Emanuele III Library, accessible from a sepa-
rate entrance on the ground floor. Originally established by Charles de
Bourbon and later enlarged, it is the greatest in southern Italy, holding over
2 million volumes, stretching as far back as papyrus manuscripts from
Herculaneum. Those are not on display, but you should definitely admire
the gorgeous decorated public halls. To bring the place to life, we recom-
mend taking the guided tour, also available in English.

Santa Chiara
Città Antica
Built at the beginning of the 14th century as the burial church for the
Angevin dynasty, this majestic church is the heart of the large monastic
complex of the Clares. The church was severely damaged by World War II
bombing and an ensuing fire, and although much of the artwork that deco-
rated the interior was lost, its architectural structure was restored to its
original look. Among the several monuments inside, the tomb of Roberto
d’Angió at the end of the nave — a beautiful example of Tuscan-style
Renaissance sculpture — is the most magnificent. The Choir of the Clares,
accessible from the sacristy, is where the nuns can sit protected from the
public during mass; it was a splendid work of art decorated by Giotto —
you can still admire some fragments and the gorgeous carved portal —
but much was lost in the fire. Outside of the church to the back, you can
visit the key attraction of the whole complex: the Cloister of the Clares, a
uniquely beautiful cloister completely decorated with hand-painted
majolica tiles. From the cloister, you can also access the museum, which
holds artwork donated to the church as well as the archaeological exca-
vations of ancient Roman thermal baths from the first century A.D.

Sant’Anna dei Lombardi (Santa Maria di Monteoliveto)
Città Antica
Opening onto a charming piazza graced by the city’s most beautiful
baroque fountain, this 15th-century church was the favorite church of the
Aragonese dynasty, which is why many of them are buried here. This is
also why the artwork and architectural masterpieces here make this
church a Renaissance gem. The elegant Piccolomini Chapel to the left
houses the tomb of Maria d’Aragona, by Antonio Rossellino and

the styles of Brunelleschi and della Robbia by Giuliano da Maiano, is a
showcase of Neapolitan sculpture from the 15th and 16th centuries. The
Cappella Correale, to the right, holds a beautiful San Cristoforo by
Francesco Solimena over a superb marble altar by Benedetto da Maiano.
In the sacristy are frescoes by Giorgio Vasari and helpers, as well as the
spectacular wood inlay work by Giovanni da Verona (created 1506–10)
depicting classical panoramas, musical instruments, and other scenes with
thousands of tiny slivers of wood of various kinds and colors.

Finding more cool things to see and do
Naples has enough attractions to satisfy its visitors for weeks on end.
Here are some more sights to explore:
 Built at the end of the 19th century (20 years after its larger
Milanese counterpart), the Galleria Umberto I (Bus: R2 or R3 to
Piazza Trieste e Trento) is a splendid example of the Liberty style
(Italian Art Nouveau). Opening to the right of Via Toledo as you
come from Piazza del Plebiscito, the glass-and-iron covered pas-
sage is an enormous airy space with a soaring glass ceiling, lined
with graciously decorated buildings and elegant shops. Come to
marvel at the architecture or to simply shop (see “Shopping the
Local Stores,” later in this chapter).
 Built by the Bourbons at the beginning of the 18th century, the
Teatro San Carlo (Via San Carlo 93; % 081-400300; Bus: R2 or R3
to Via San Carlo) is among Europe’s most beautiful opera houses, a
neoclassical jewel with an ornate gilded interior. It was also the first
opera theater in the world and is said to have even better acoustics
than Milan’s famous La Scala. You can appreciate its architecture
and decorations by taking the free guided tour (by reservation 
at % 081-664545; www.itineranapoli.com), but of course you
can also come for a performance to see the building in its full glory
and hear for yourself (see “Living It Up After Dark,” later in this
chapter).
 The country house of the Duchess of Floridia, second wife of King
Ferdinand II Bourbon, Villa La Floridiana (Via Domenico Cimarosa
77; % 081-407881; Funivia to Vomero; Admission: 2.50€/$3; 10 per-
cent discount with artecard; Open: Wed–Mon 8:30 a.m.–2 p.m.), is 
a very pleasant place indeed. The richly decorated halls house a
porcelain museum that boasts the world’s largest collection of
Capodimonte porcelain, as well as other precious objects. The
splendid park affords great views of the city and the bay.
 The dark and mysterious Prince Raimondo di Sangro of Sansevero,
an alchemist from the 18th century, transformed his family chapel
into an architectural marvel. The Cappella di San Severo (Via

artecard; Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun 10 a.m.–1 p.m.), in the
città antica, contains some of the most strangely beautiful sculp-
tures of the time, including the famous Veiled Christ, by the
Neapolitan master Giuseppe Sanmartino. The crypt holds two
mummified bodies — the work of the prince — showing their per-
fectly preserved circulatory systems.
 Less frequently visited than the Duomo, San Domenico Maggiore
(Piazza San Domenico Maggiore, off Via Benedetto Croce; % 081-
449097; Metro: Piazza Cavour; Admission: Free; Open: Daily 9 a.m.
to noon and 5–7 p.m.) is still a splendid church. Built by the
Angevins in the 13th century, its main facade is not on the piazza
but inside a courtyard, according to their customs. The interior is
graced by innumerable works of art, from the elegant Renaissance
monumental tombs along the walls to the 14th-century frescoes
and many paintings. From the transept, you can also visit the
medieval church of San Michele Arcangelo a Morfisa, which was
incorporated into the newer one. In the piazza is the Guglia San
Domenico, one of the city’s typical baroque stone spires — a pile
of carved figures — erected at the end of the plague.
 In use between the second and ninth centuries, the Catacombs 
of St. Gennaro (Via Capodimonte 13, down a small alley running
alongside the church Madre del Buon Consiglio; % 081-7411071;
Bus: 24 or R4 to Via Capodimonte; Admission: 3€/$3.60) are partic-
ularly famous for the well-maintained frescoes decorating the large
corridors and chapels. One of the most beautiful is the Cripta dei
Vescovi on the upper level, decorated with fifth-century mosaics.
Buried in these catacombs is San Gennaro, the patron saint of
Naples — hence the name — whose remains were moved here in
the fifth century. You can visit only by guided tour, Tuesday
through Sunday at 9 a.m., 10 a.m., 11 a.m., and noon.
 The medieval church of San Lorenzo Maggiore (Piazza San Gaetano;

5–7 p.m.) has important literary references, as it’s where the poet
Boccaccio (author of the Decameron) met his love, Fiammetta, back
in 1334. The attached convent was also home to the great poet
Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch) for a time. Originally built in the sixth
century, the church enjoyed both a Renaissance and a baroque over-
haul, which left untouched the beautiful 13th- and 14th-century fres-
coes, as well as the many carvings decorating the interior. From the
cloister, you can access the very interesting archaeological excava-
tions (www.sanlorenzomaggiorenapoli.it; Admission: 2€/$2.40;
Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–6 p.m.), descending to the Roman and Greek
period: You’ll see different layers, with the Greek merchant stalls at
the bottom, then the ancient Roman market, a paleo-Christian basil-
ica, and the medieval buildings.
Chapter 18: Naples 403

 The neighborhood of Mergellina (Tram: 1; Bus: 140; Metro:
Mergellina), to the west of Chiaia, lies along the waterfront, where
you’ll find the pleasure harbor and the hydrofoil terminal. Only a
short distance from the city center, Neapolitans like to come here for
dinner and ice cream by the sea, looking at the bay from under the
shadow of the Posillipo towering promontory. If you want to do like
the locals, try Don Salvatore (Via Mergellina 4/a; % 081-681817;
closed Wed in winter), a good trattoria housed in a former boat shed,
or the more formal Ciro a Mergellina (Via Mergellina 18; % 081-6
81780; closed Mon), which has better service as well as excellent
pizza. At both places, you can enjoy nicely grilled fresh fish, accom-
panied by local vegetables, or else opt for the seafood pasta or
risotto.
Seeing Naples by guided tour
The hop-on/hop-off buses operated by City Sightseeing (% 081-5517279;
www.napoli.city-sightseeing.it) offer a great way to see the city as
well as a good alternative to public transportation. Three one-hour itiner-
aries start from Piazza Municipio/Parco Castello: Line A travels inland to
Museo di Capodimonte (9:45 a.m.–6:45 p.m., every 45 minutes); Line B
goes along the seaside to Posillipo (9:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m., every 45 minutes);
and Line C heads to the Carthusian Monastery of San Martino on the
Vomero (Sat–Sun and holidays 10 a.m.–7 p.m., every two hours). Check
the schedule, as it changes often. You can get tickets on board for 16€
($19) for adults and 8€ ($10) for children 5 to 15. Tickets are valid for both
itineraries for 24 hours. You get a 10 percent discount if you have the arte-
card (see the beginning of the “Exploring Naples” section, earlier in this
chapter).
At Museo Aperto Napoli (Via Pietro Colletta 85; % 081-5636062; www.
museoapertonapoli.com; Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.), you can sign up
for free self-guided walking tours (with a map and audio guide in six lan-
guages) of the città antica.
Suggested one-, two-, and three-day itineraries
Even for a short stay, consider purchasing the artecard, which gets you
free and discounted admissions to attractions, unlimited public trans-
portation, and a variety of other discounts (see the beginning of the
“Exploring Naples” section, earlier in this chapter).
Naples in one day
It’s impossible to see the best of Naples in one day, but you can hit some
of the highlights; it only means that you’ll have to return for more days
next time! Begin in Piazza Municipio, taking in the Castel Nuovo — the
huge fortress in the center of the square — and stopping just long
enough to admire its magnificent portal. Head now for the City
Sightseeing hop-on/hop-off bus to the side of the piazza and buy a
ticket: Its three routes offer a great way to get an overview of the city
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
404

and to move from attraction to attraction. Go directly up to the Museo
di Capodimonte, where you’ve made advance reservations, and spend
time exploring this splendid museum. After your visit, hop back on the
bus and get off at Porta Capuana to have lunch at the Pizzeria di
Matteo. After your taste of real Neapolitan pizza, take a stroll along Via
dei Tribunali in the heart of the città antica. Stop at the Caffetteria
Pasticceria Gelateria G. Mazzaro for a snack of Neapolitan coffee and
pastries (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter) while you wait for the
Duomo to open. After your visit to the Duomo, its baptistery, and its
Cappella di San Gennaro, head for the Museo Archeologico. You can’t
skip this part — some of the ancient Roman artifacts here are the best in
the world. Then climb back on your bus and, back in Piazza Municipio,
switch to Line B for a sunset ride along the waterfront. Stop at Castel
dell’Ovo on the way back and have dinner by the sea, taking in the
romantic beauty of the bay. After your meal, stroll to Piazza Plebiscito,
the most beautiful square in Naples, for your adieu to this magic city.
Naples in two days
Two days is a lot better than one — you’ll be able to skip fewer attrac-
tions. Here’s how we’d spend our time:
Day 1
Start off by following our “Naples in one day” itinerary, earlier in this
chapter, up to and including the visit to the Duomo, but then dedicate
more time to the old streets of the città antica, also visiting Santa
Chiara and one or all of the minor churches — Cappella San Severo,
San Domenico Maggiore, and San Lorenzo Maggiore. Get back on your
bus at Piazza Bovio and finish the day as in the itinerary earlier in this
chapter, with a scenic waterfront ride and dinner.
Day 2
Begin your day at Santa Maria di Monteoliveto (Sant’Anna dei
Lombardi), maybe stopping for caffè and sfogliatella at the Gran Caffè
Gambrinus on your way. Proceed then to the Museo Archeologico,
where you’ll spend the rest of your morning. Dedicate your afternoon to
the Riviera di Chiaia, strolling the waterfront, and visiting the Giardini
Comunali. End your stay in memorable fashion, with aperitivo at Piazza
dei Martiri and dinner at George’s in the Grand Hotel Parker’s (see
“Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter).
Naples in three days
Follow our itinerary for “Naples in two days,” earlier in this chapter. On
your third day, devote your morning to a visit of Castel Nuovo, followed
by a funivia ride up to the Vomero to see the splendid attractions up
there. Visit Villa La Floridiana before having lunch at Gorizia (see “Dining
Out,” earlier in this chapter). Then proceed to the Carthusian Monastery
of San Martino; you can then follow up with Castel Sant’Elmo to admire
the sunset over the bay from its splendid vantage point, or descend to
Chapter 18: Naples 405

Chiaia for some shopping. Alternatively, you can dedicate your whole 
day to one of the side trips we highlight in Chapter 19 — Pompeii,
Herculaneum, or the Campi Flegrei— or catch a ferry to Capri (see
Chapter 20).
Shopping the Local Stores
Though not as glitzy and ubiquitous as in Milan or Rome, shopping in
Naples does offer some serious possibilities. You can find all the big and
small names of Italian fashion here, as well as some local designers.
Naples also excels in antiques, but you need to know what you’re doing
(the city is known for its experts in the tricky art of “antiquing,” or
making something new look old). Finally, Naples and the surrounding
areas maintain a tradition of producing crafts — one specialty being
cameos (delicately carved jewels using colored stone like agate or
coral), the other being figurines for presepi (manger scenes). Both of
these artistic traditions date back to the 18th century.
Best shopping areas
In the elegant area behind the Chiaia waterfront, you’ll find all the big
names of Italian fashion, such as Valentino, Versace, Ferragamo, and
Prada, plus a lot of other nice boutiques. The best streets for such high-
end shopping are Via dei Mille, Piazza dei Martiri, and Via Calabritto.
Also in this area are many antiques dealers. Via Domenico Morelli is
home of the city’s most established dealers, specializing in 18th-century
furniture and paintings. Another good area for shopping is Via Toledo,
the animated street leading away from Piazza del Plebiscito.
What to look for and where to find it
Shops in Naples are generally open Monday through Saturday from 
10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 4 or 4:30 to 7:30 or 8 p.m.
Accessories
Among the local designers, Marinella (Via Riviera di Chiaia 287; % 081-
7644214; Open: Mon–Sat 6:45 a.m.–8 p.m.) is the most famous. The spe-
cialty is cravats and ties, with a new collection offered almost every
week.
Antiques
The Fiera Antiquaria (% 081-621951), in the Villa Comunale di Napoli
on Viale Dohrn, is an important event held every third Saturday and
Sunday of each month from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. (except in Aug).
Two reputable antiques shops are Regency House (Via D. Morelli 36; 
% 081-764-3640) and Navarra (Piazza dei Martiri; % 081-764-3595). 
To get to these shops, take bus no. R3 to Riviera di Chiaia.
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
406

Cameos
In the Galleria Umberto I, off Via Toledo (see “Finding more cool things
to see and do,” earlier in this chapter), you can buy as well as see a
demonstration of cameo and coral carving, at Ascione 1855 (% 081-
421111).
Chocolate
The most interesting shop in Naples is Gay-Odin (Via Toledo 214 and 
up the street at no. 427; % 081-417843), a historic chocolate factory
making delicious, 100-percent pure chocolate (what you usually get is
30-percent chocolate at best), and such daring concoctions as chocolate
con peperoncino (with hot pepper): try it, it is great!
Presepi (Manger Figurines)
At Gambardella Pastori (Via San Gregorio Armeno 40; % 081-5517107),
you’ll find a large array of manger figurines and accessories. Another
good resource is Giuseppe Ferrigno (Via San Gregorio Armeno 8; % 081-
5523148). These are traditional workshops selling quality items, but
nearby you’ll also find cheaper plastic versions of the same thing.
Living It Up After Dark
Like other Italians, Neapolitans like to stroll in the evening, perhaps
having an ice cream or sitting out on the terrace of a popular cafe. On
the other hand, the lively local cultural life is also well worth sampling.
The performing arts
Seeing an opera at the Teatro San Carlo (Via San Carlo 98/f; % 081-
7972412 or 081-7972331; www.teatrosancarlo.it) is an unforgettable
experience. This is a world-class venue (see “Finding more cool things to
see and do,” earlier in this chapter) that attracts the best international
stars. The acoustics are excellent, and the program always includes
some grandiose production. The season runs from December to June,
with shows Tuesday through Sunday. Ticket prices range from 45€ to
110€ ($54–$132); you can get a 20 percent discount with the artecard.
Traditional Neapolitan songs are famous around the world — think 
O Sole Mio — and you can see some of the best performers at the
Trianon (Piazza Vincenzo Calenda 9; % 081-2258285). Tickets cost 
5€ to 25€ ($6–$30), with 10 percent off if you have an artecard.
Live music
Naples has a tradition of music, and its pop scene is very lively with
both new and more established local groups. The local sound is jazz
mixed with traditional and ethnic influences. You can sample some of it

Giovanni Maggiore Pignatelli 10; % 081-5513984).
Clubs and discos
A real harbor town, Naples offers a lively nightlife scene with discos and
clubs galore; they’re mostly open Thursday through Saturday until 4 or 
5 a.m. One of the most popular is Chez Moi (Via del Parco Margherita 13;
% 081-407526), a small, chic hangout in Chiaia. Nearby is La Mela (Via
dei Mille; % 081-4010270), where the best night is Thursday.
For a gay atmosphere, go to Tongue (Via Manzoni 202; % 081-7690888),
in the seaside suburb of Posillipo, where you’ll find a mixed crowd with
a large proportion of gays and lesbians. In the città antica, check out Bar
B (Via Giovanni Manna, near the Duomo; % 081-287681), which has an
attached sauna.
Wine bars and cafes
Aperitivo and after-dinner pastries and ice cream are popular with locals;
join them at the oldest cafe in Naples, the Gran Caffè Gambrinus (Via
Chiaia 1; % 081-417582; Bus: R2 or R3 to Piazza Trieste e Trento). The
cafe has been beautifully restored to its full glory; the ornate gilded in-
terior dates from the 1860s. If Gambrinus is too full, try the nearby Caffè
del Professore (Piazza Trieste e Trento 46; % 081-403041), less glitzy
but also popular. Even more fashionable is La Caffetteria (Piazza dei
Martiri; % 081-7644243). Also trendy is the roof bar of the Starhotel
Terminus (Piazza Garibaldi 91; % 081-7793111).
If you feel like relaxing over a nice glass of vino, Berevino (Via Sebastiano
62; % 081-290313) is an enoteca with lots of room and many wines to
sample. With its beamed ceiling and warm interior, it will make you feel
as if you’ve stepped into the countryside. Berevino also serves food and
has a full bar.

Going Beyond Naples:
Three Day Trips
In This Chapter
 Checking out steam holes and ruins in the Campi Flegrei
 Seeing the eerie sights of Herculaneum
 Discovering the marvels of Pompeii
R
ich in history and natural beauty, the region surrounding Naples is
a favorite destination of antiquity lovers and seaside loungers in
particular. While the famous sites of Herculaneum and Pompeii are
today mainly interesting for their archaeological areas, the ancient
Roman resort of Baia and busy Pozzuoli, in the volcanic natural park of
the Campi Flegrei, have maintained their appeal and are still attracting
visitors — not only for their Greek and ancient Roman ruins, but also for
their splendid seaside scenery.
You can visit each destination as a day trip from Naples, but the area of
the Campi Flegrei could also warrant a longer stay if you have the time.
Campi Flegrei
This volcanic area, lying to the west of Naples, was established as a pro-
tected natural park in 1993. Its attractions range from the archaeological
sites of Pozzuoli to the dramatic ruins of Cuma, from the hot mud and
steam holes in the volcano of the Solfatara to beautiful lakes and the
underwater archaeological park of Baia.
Getting there
Pozzuoli, the area’s main town, is about 18km (11 miles) from the center
of Naples and is connected to the city by metro line no. 2; by the Cumana
railroad — a frequent commuter line — from Piazza Montesanto in Chiaia
(% 800-001616 in Italy); and by the scenic but slower bus no. 152, start-
ing from Piazza Garibaldi in Naples and going through Santa Lucia and
Chiaia. Allow about 15 to 20 minutes to get here by metro or rail, and an
hour by bus. To reach the farthest attractions, your best bet is to take the

Archeobus (see later in this section). If you visit when the Archeobus
isn’t operating, you can take a taxi (same rates as in Naples; see Chap-
ter 18) from the taxi stand at Piazza della Repubblica, in Pozzuoli 
(% 081-5265800), or the one at Piazzetta Centrale, in Bacoli (% 081-
5235300) — or use the local bus service (% 800-001616 in Italy; www.
sepsa.it) and the Cumana commuter train (see earlier in this para-
graph) between Pozzuoli and Baia.
Taking a tour
The Archeobus (% 800-001616 in Italy; www.sepsa.it) is the park’s
official hop-on/hop-off bus tour. Tickets cost 8€ ($9.60) and are included
with the artecard (see “Exploring Naples,” in Chapter 18). The bus oper-
ates hourly, Friday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., from Piazza
della Repubblica in Pozzuoli (check again before your trip, as the sched-
ule changes often). The whole loop takes 90 minutes, with 16 intermedi-
ary stops.
Seeing the sights
The whole area itself is the attraction, centered around a small bay with
splendid views of the islands of Ischia and Procida. Pozzuoli is the main
town and the park’s entrance; it’s a lively town on a picturesque bay,
home to many locals who commute to Naples.
If you’re planning to see several attractions in the Naples area, the best
deal after the artecard (see “Exploring Naples,” in Chapter 18) is the
5.50€ ($6.60) combination ticket, valid for two days and including the
archaeological area and museum of Baia, the excavations of Cuma, Rione
Terra, and the archaeological area in Pozzuoli.
Archaeological Area and Museum of Baia
Baia was a lively VIP resort in Roman times as well as an important town;
its ruins are scattered over a large area adjacent to today’s welcoming fish-
ing town. The most interesting are the Thermal Baths, fabled in antiquity
for their beauty and therapeutic properties. You can admire the pools and
rooms, as well as the complicated hydraulic systems that worked under-
neath. From the baths, follow a foothpath to the Monumental Park, the rest
of the huge archaeological area — it covers over 14 hectares (35 acres) —
which is still being excavated, exposing partially uncovered villas and impe-
rial residences. The museum, housing the best findings from the archaeo-
logical area, is located in the Aragonese Castle on the promontory
overlooking the town.
Thermal Baths: Via Sella di Baia 22. % 081-8687592. Museum: Via Castello 39. 
% 081-5233797. Admission: 4€ ($4.80); includes archaeological area of Pozzuoli and
excavations of Cuma. Open: Tues–Sun Thermal baths 9 a.m. to 1 hour before sunset;
museum 9 a.m.–8 p.m. Ticket booth closes 1 hour earlier. Closed Jan 1, May 1, and
Dec 25.

Underwater Archaeological Park of Baia
Visiting the part of the ruins of Roman Baia that are submerged under the
sea is a very evocative experience, whether you do it by glass-bottom boat
or by scuba diving. The prices are the same, but the dive is unique and
memorable; you’ll need to be certified to do it (the dive is easy, as the ruins
lie only a few feet underwater). The glass-bottom boat excursion is also
very nice; departures are by the harbor.
Harbor of Baia. % 081-5248169. www.baiasommersa.it. Admission: 35€ ($42),
including boat and scuba equipment. Open: Mid-Mar to mid-Nov Tues–Sun 
9:30 a.m.–1:30 p.m. and 3:30–7:30 p.m.
Excavations of Cuma
Back when the ancient Greeks started taking over the Mediterranean, this
is where they founded their first colony, in the eighth century B.C. The set-
tlement rapidly evolved to become the most important city on this coast,
and the little that remains today speaks of its past grandeur: its acropolis
and part of the fortified walls, as well as a necropolis, an amphitheater,
and a grandiose but mysterious tunnel excavated through the mountain.
Known as Sybilla’s Cave, it was for a long time believed to have been the
cave where this priestess to Apollo officiated; in reality, it was probably a
strategic construction. The view from the terraces is spectacular.
Via Monte di Cuma 3. % 081-8543060. Admission: 4€ ($4.80); includes archaeologi-
cal area of Pozzuoli and archaeological area and museum of Baia. Open: Daily 9 a.m.
to 1 hour before sunset. Ticket booth closes 1 hour earlier. Closed Jan 1, May 1, and
Dec 25.
Archaeological Area of Pozzuoli
A Greek and then Roman town, Puteoli — as it was then called — 
surpassed Naples many times in size, commercial significance, and strate-
gic importance, as you can see from its imposing ruins scattered through-
out the modern town. The so-called Temple of Serapis by the harbor —
actually the town’s market and forum from the first century A.D. — is an
elegant columned structure, once lined with shops and taverns with a
temple in the middle; the whole thing was once submerged beneath sea
level, but has now re-emerged due to the local phenomenon of bradisism
(a slow movement of the earth’s surface). The third largest after the
Colosseum, the Flavian Amphitheater to the north of town is worth the
detour; the walls and the vaulted ceilings under the arena are still pre-
served here, unlike the Colosseum’s, where they have collapsed. The arena
hosts special musical performances during the Flavian Nights Festival
(% 081-7611221 for a schedule of events.)
Temple of Serapis: Via Roma 10. Amphitheater: Via Terracciano 75. % 081-5266007.
Admission: 4€ ($4.80); includes excavations of Cuma and archaeological area and
museum of Baia. Open: Daily 9 a.m. to 1 hour before sunset. Closed Jan 1, May 1, and
Dec 25.
Chapter 19: Going Beyond Naples: Three Day Trips 413

Rione Terra
The most suggestive ruin in Pozzuoli, this is the excavation of what was
once the town’s acropolis, which later sunk to below sea level. You can
walk the streets underground and see the shops and taverns that lined
them; you’ll need to sign up for your visit in advance. We also recommend
taking the 3.50€ ($4.20) guided tour.
Largo Sedile di Porta. % 848-800288 or 06-39967050 for reservations. Admission 3€
($3.60), plus 2€ ($2.40) reservations fee, children under 6 free. Open: Sat–Sun 
9 a.m.–7 p.m.
Solfatara
A 20-minute walk uphill, or a five-minute taxi ride from Pozzuoli, this is
actually the large crater of a flattish volcano which was used as a spa back
in the 19th century. You can see a series of impressive phenomena, from
hissing steam holes to bubbling mud, not to mention the pervasive sul-
furous smell. Quite hellish, but not to be missed!
Via Solfatara 161. % 081-5262341. www.solfatara.it. Admission 5.50€ ($6.60);
children under 4 free; 20 percent discount with artecard. Open: Daily 8:30 a.m.–7 p.m.

NEAPOLITAN
This restaurant features a good choice of local dishes, well prepared and
moderately priced. We loved the simply prepared, very fresh, and very
tasty seafood: The various catches of the day are displayed on ice, so you
can choose your fish and how you’d like it prepared (baked with potatoes,
grilled, or all’acquapazza — in a light herbed broth). The buffet of antipasto
and side dishes is superb — you could create a whole meal from the tasty
vegetables and seafood salads alone.

Herculaneum
Few archaeological sites are as moving as this town buried beneath vol-
canic mud after Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79. The mud preserved
the houses to a remarkable extent, and the town has yielded great num-
bers of artifacts and sculptures, some of which are on display in the
Archaeological Museum of Naples (see Chapter 18).
Getting there
From Naples, take either line of the Circumvesuviana Train (Corso
Garibaldi; % 800-053939; www.vesuviana.it; Metro: Garibaldi) to the
Ercolano Scavi stop; outside the station, you’ll find a shuttle bus to the
site. The 20-minute ride costs 1.70€ ($2); trains leave every half-hour.
Taking a tour
The agency Every Tours (Piazza del Municipio 5; % 081-551-8564;
Metro: Garibaldi) — which serves as the American Express office in
Naples — organizes day excursions to Herculaneum. Unless you are
Chapter 19: Going Beyond Naples: Three Day Trips 415

keen on bus tours, we much prefer getting to the archaeological area by
ourselves and booking one of the official guided tours (see later in this
section).
Seeing the sights
Unless you’re visiting in the dead of winter, remember to bring a hat,
plenty of sunscreen, and water. There are no trees among the ruins, and
it can get really hot here. Remember to wear comfortable shoes as well.
If you have time to visit both Herculaneum and Pompeii, you can get a
combination ticket for 18€ ($22); it is valid for three days and gives you
access to three other archaeological sites in the Vesuvian area — Oplonti,
Stabia, and Boscoreale. This is a good alternative to the 25€ ($30) “3 days
all sites” artecard (see “Exploring Naples,” in Chapter 18), which grants
free admission to two attractions and a 50 percent discount on all others
from an extensive list (including Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Paestum).
Archaeological Area
Smaller than Pompeii — about a third the size, according to experts — this
was the glitzier seaside resort for VIPs during Roman times. It’s been esti-
mated that at the time of the eruption, Herculaneum was a town of about
5,000. Because it was covered in hard volcanic mud — and the new town
was built over it — only a small part has been excavated, but what has
been unearthed is highly interesting: rich and elaborate buildings, along
with woodwork that’s only partially burned. Among the most interesting
public sites are the elegantly decorated thermal baths and the Palestra,
a sports arena where games were staged to satisfy the spectacle-hungry
denizens. The Collegio degli Augustali, lavishly adorned with marble
floors and frescoes, had a custodian: He was found sleeping in his bed,
which you can still see in his small room. The best example of private
architecture is the House of the Stags, named for the sculpture found
inside; it was an elegant town house overlooking the sea, built around atri-
ums and terraces, and decorated extravagantly. The House of the
Latticework was at the other end of the scale: It was where poor workers
had their rooms, in a forerunner of project housing. The House of the
Mosaic of Neptune, in contrast, belonged to a merchant — and you can
see his shop lined with cabinets and merchandise still on his counter. Tip:
We strongly recommend signing up for an official guided tour at the
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
416
Pack a picnic
There’s little to eat at the excavation sites, so it’s a good idea to pack a picnic lunch to
bring along (don’t forget plenty of water during the summer). If you want to eat in a
restaurant, you’ll have to head for the modern town of Ercolano, which is relatively
poor, though it does have a few snack bars near the center.

this villa was built around A.D. 60; you can visit both the lower and upper

floors, all decorated with rich mosaics and frescoes. Entrance is by guided
tour only, and requires advance reservation. The visit takes about an hour.

Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
418
Mount Vesuvius
Loved and feared by Neapolitans, Mount Vesuvius (Vesuvio) is the dormant volcano
that dominates Naples and its bay to the southeast. Mount Vesuvius is the only conti-
nental volcano still active in Europe, and it is now a national park. Of the two major
kinds of volcanoes — some slowly ooze magma, like the ones on Hawaii; others build
and build and build up pressure inside and then blow their tops — Vesuvius is a top-
blower. Although Vesuvius has belched only a few puffs of smoke since the last real
eruption in 1944, no one really knows whether the volcano is losing its punch or just
biding its time. It had been dormant for centuries when it exploded in the great erup-
tion of A.D. 79., which buried Pompeii and Herculaneum. It got everybody on their toes
when it puffed again in 1999, just in case anyone thought it was extinct.
Luckily, one of the best (and the first) observatories for the study of volcanology is right
here on the mountain, taking its pulse daily. From Naples, take the Circumvesuviana
Train (Corso Garibaldi; % 800-053939; www.vesuviana.it; Metro: Garibaldi) and
get off at the Ercolano stop, about 15 minutes away. From there, an electric minibus
will take you to the entrance of the park at 1,017m (3,106 ft.) altitude. The trip costs
about 1.50€ ($1.80). Rising 1,281m (3,944 ft.), the slopes of Vesuvius are green with
vineyards — producing the famous local wine, the amber-colored Lacrimae Christi —
and they become more rugged only as you approach the top. At the entrance of the
park (Admission: 4.50€/$5.40; Open: Daily 9 a.m.–sunset; last entrance one hour ear-
lier), there is a visitor center (% 081-7775720) where you can sign up for a guided tour
of the crater (3€/$3.60), as well as a historic osteria that was recently restored and is
now open for business. A small shop sells local products, including wine. Nearby, at
608m (1,994 ft.), you can visit the Vesuvian Observatory, the top-notch center that has
observed the volcano’s activity day by day since around 1850. Attached to the obser-
vatory are the geological museum and a rich scientific library.
After entering the park, you’ll follow a dirt trail to the crater. Closer to the top, the dirt
trail becomes lava, which looks like typical black-and-purple rough pieces of stone.
The trail circles the crater, but you’ll need a guide to descend into it and look at the
smoldering lava. From the top on a good day, you can enjoy a fantastic view of the Bay
of Naples. The manageable uphill hike — up 264m (838 ft.) in altitude — takes about
an hour; allow twice as much time if you choose to descend into the crater. You can
also join an organized tour from Naples: Every Tours (Piazza del Municipio 5; % 081-
5518564) offers classic bus excursions, while La Porta del Vesuvio (% 081-274200;
www.laportadelvesuvio.it; for reservations, call from 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m.) organ-
izes scenic night tours of the crater as well as a nature trail hike (Sun at 11 a.m.).

Pompeii
Buried beneath volcanic ash and pumice stone in the A.D. 79 eruption of
Mount Vesuvius, the ruins of Pompeii have been easier to excavate than
those in Herculaneum (see earlier in the chapter), allowing archaeolo-
gists to bring nearly the whole town back to light. The huge site — four
times larger than Herculaneum — is impressive indeed. The burning
ashes suffocated people without burning them, transforming Pompeiians
taking flight into human statues that are preserved now in the museum —
an eerie and moving sight.
Getting there
From Naples, take the Sorrento line of the Circumvesuviana Train (Corso
Garibaldi; % 800-053939; www.vesuviana.it; Metro: Garibaldi) to the
Pompei Scavi stop (the Pompei stop on the other line is the modern
town, which you don’t want); the station is near the entrance to the
archaeological area. The 45-minute ride costs 2.20€ ($2.60); trains leave
every half-hour.
Taking a tour
If you prefer a classic bus tour, both Every Tours (Piazza del Municipio 5;
% 081-5518564; Metro: Garibaldi) — the American Express branch in
Naples — and NapoliVision (% 081-5595130; www.napolivision.it)
organize day trips to Pompeii.
We prefer booking one of the several guided tours offered by Arethusa
(% 081-8616405; www.arethusa.net) — the official tour provider of
the archaeological area. Given the sheer size of the excavations, the
tours are organized by theme, some of them seasonal: public life, private
homes, merchants, grape harvest (we especially like this one, since you
get to see — and sample — the wine production using 2,000-year-old
techniques).
Seeing the sights
Even more so than for Herculaneum, you’ll need water, comfortable
shoes, and a hat and sunscreen (in good weather) to visit this large site
in comfort.
If you’re planning to visit more than one archaeological site in the area,
you should take advantage of one of the available deals.
Certain attractions within the archaeological area — for instance, the
Suburban Baths and the House of the Gilded Cupids (see later in this
section) — require advance reservations. These reservations are free 
of charge, but need to be made at least 24 hours in advance by calling 
% 081-8575347 daily between 10 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., or by going online
to www.pompeiisites.org. If you’re planning to sign up for both free
Chapter 19: Going Beyond Naples: Three Day Trips 419

tours recommended below, keep in mind that you’ll need about 30 min-
utes to get from one to the other.
Archaeological Area
Pompeii was an important commercial town as well as a residential resort,
and its urban fabric was a mix of elegant villas, shops, and more modest
housing. The town was buried under volcanic ash and pumice stone that
then solidified, which allowed the residents who had escaped to come back
and salvage some of their treasures. Of course, this same situation also
made it easier for the treasure hunters of later centuries to loot the place.
In spite of all the scavengers, the city was very well preserved, and the
archaeological excavations have uncovered much about the life of that time
period. The excavated archaeological area is huge — about 44 hectares
(109 acres) — representing about two-thirds of the original town; at the
time of the eruption, Pompeii had about 35,000 inhabitants.
Organized around three points — the Forum; the theater district by the tri-
angular forum; and the games and sports area with the Palestra and the
Amphitheater — this large town followed the classic Roman grid of almost
perpendicular streets, both residential and commercial, lined with taverns
and shops.
Nearest to the entrance is the Forum — covering 5,388 sq. m (58,000 sq.
ft.) — surrounded by three important buildings: the Basilica (the meeting
hall, the city’s largest single structure), the Macellum (covered goods
market), and the Temple of Jupiter. Interestingly, the Forum was severely
damaged in an earthquake 16 years before the eruption of Vesuvius, and
you can see how parts of it had not yet been repaired when the final
destruction came.
Farther along is the theater district, with the beautiful Teatro Grande —
a structure that could hold 5,000 — and the smaller Odeion, for only about
1,000. Nearby are the Stabian Baths, the finest thermal baths to have sur-
vived from antiquity. Still in good condition, they are richly decorated with
marble, frescoes, and mosaics.
At the other end of town are the Amphitheater — from 80 B.C., making it
the oldest in the world — and the magnificent Palestra, the sports com-
pound, with exercise areas and a swimming pool that must have been won-
derful (it was huge and surrounded by plane trees — you can see the casts
of the stumps).
Among the private homes, the most elegant is the House of the Vettii,
belonging to two rich merchants, where you can admire a frescoed dining
room in the shade that has become famous as Pompeiian red. The largest
is the House of the Faun, named for the bronze statue of a dancing faun
that was found there; the house takes up a city block and has four dining
rooms and two spacious inner gardens.
Some buildings within the archaeological area can be visited only with
advance reservations through www.arethusa.net. These include the beau-
tifully decorated House of the Gilded Cupids, named after the delicate
cupids painted on gilded glass in one of the bedrooms (20-minute visits
scheduled daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.), and the Suburban Baths, a set of private

thermal baths attached to a sumptuous villa, which opened to the public
in 2002 (30-minute visits scheduled daily 10 a.m.–1:30 p.m.). These baths
reveal the pleasure-oriented mind of the local population: Set in a splendid,
panoramic spot by the western town wall overlooking the sea, they were
used by men and women together, and the various halls and spaces were
decorated with frescoes and mosaics.
About half a mile down Via dei Sepolcri, out of Porta Ercolano to the north-
west of Pompeii’s archaeological area, you can visit the Villa dei Misteri
(House of the Mysteries). This was an elegant suburban villa once over-
looking the sea (it has since receded). The most famous of its decorations
are those of a medium-sized room with frescoes of ritual scenes related to
the cult of Bacchus (Dionysus) — a cult inherited from the Greeks, along
with its mysterious practices. The villa’s architecture, with its dramatic
terrace, is worth the detour.
Allow about four hours if you want to get a glimpse of everything. We
strongly recommend taking an official guided tour (see earlier in this sec-
tion); you can sign up at the ticket booth when you arrive, but we suggest

making reservations ahead of time, especially if you’re going to be here on
a weekend in high season.

well as the sweet and spicy recipes from 2,000 years ago: The lagane al

 Living the good life on the Amalfi Coast
E
nclosing the famous bay of Naples to the south, the Sorrento penin-
sula has been a place of pleasure since antiquity. Giving its name to
the peninsula, the town of Sorrento is said to be the most picturesque
on this coast. Only a short ferry ride away, the famed island of Capri
(pronounced Cap-ry), favored by VIPs, makes a perfect getaway.
Occupying the whole southern edge of the peninsula and opening onto
the splendid bay of Salerno is the Amalfi Coast, a stretch of shore
famous for its natural beauty, as well as for its picturesque towns of
Amalfi, Ravello, and Positano.
If you have the time, the best way to enjoy each of these destinations is
to spend the night, but you can also see the highlights as a day trip from
Naples. Sorrento makes a good base for your explorations, or you can
choose to move southward along the coast as we do in this chapter.
Sorrento
The favored destination of writers and artists — following in the foot-
steps of such illustrious predecessors as Emperor Augustus and
Tiberius — Sorrento has not had its charm dulled by the crowds of 
visitors that populate its cobbled streets at the height of summer. You
can enjoy a taste of it all in three to four hours.
Getting there
Sorrento is the last stop on the Circumvesuviana Train (Corso Garibaldi;
% 800-053939; www.vesuviana.it; Metro: Garibaldi) from Naples; the
50-minute ride costs about 3€ ($3.60). Trains depart every half-hour.

You can also get here by one of the frequent ferries from Naples and
Capri, run by Linee Marittime Partenopee (% 081-55513236), NLG
(% 081-5527209), and Linee Lauro (% 081-55522838). All are reputablez
companies; you just need to choose the one leaving at a time that’s con-
venient for you. Ferries arrive at the Marina Piccola by the waterside.
You can then take the frequent shuttle bus for the steep climb to Piazza
Tasso, in the heart of town.
If you’re coming from the Capodichino airport in Naples, you can take
one of the seven daily buses operated by Curreri Viaggi (% 081-
8015420); the trip takes about an hour and costs 6€ ($7.20).
You’ll find the local tourist office on Via Luigi de Maio, off Piazza Tasso
(% 081-8074033; www.sorrentotourism.com).
Spending the night
Sorrento offers many hotel options, with the most expensive ones lining
the waterfront. Here is our selection of the best in each price range.

From the public spaces, furnished with the original 19th-century furniture,
to the beautiful terraces, everything whispers taste, luxury, and relaxation.
Guest rooms, which are palatial in size and décor, continue that theme.

is where you’ll find the best rendition of the local favorites. We loved the
seafood lasagna and the ravioli with eggplant sauce, as well as the perfectly
grilled fish of the day. The orange and walnut cake is heavenly.

CREATIVE SORRENTINE
This is a real gourmet hide-out, where locals and visitors come to partake
of the daily offerings from the imaginative chef. Housed in the atmospheric
cellars of a convent, it also has a small outdoor terrace. The menu includes
simple dishes with elaborate flavor combinations, such as the splendid
seafood ravioli with sweet peppers. You can also choose one of the two

Exploring Sorrento
At Nautica Sic Sic (Marina Piccola; % 081-8072283; closed Nov–Apr)
and at Tony’s Beach (Marina Grande; % 081-8785606), you can rent a
boat with a driver to poke around the coast and discover the small
secluded beaches. Figure on spending 20€ ($24) for about an hour.
The top attractions
Although little remains from medieval Sorrento, as it was destroyed in
the 16th century, the old part of town is very picturesque. Narrow cob-
bled streets and pretty flower-ringed squares are set behind a dramatic
cliff, overlooking the two harbors of Marina Grande and Marina Piccola.
Duomo
This is Sorrento’s cathedral, dedicated to San Filippo and San Giacomo.
Behind the simple Romanesque facade, flanked by a bell tower and deco-
rated with four antique columns and a majolica clock, you’ll find an ele-
gant interior, adorned with original bas reliefs from the 14th and 15th
centuries. The bishop’s chair on display is an example of splendid wood
intarsia work — a typical local craft (see later in this section).
Corso Italia 1. % 081-8782248. Admission: free. Open: Daily 8 a.m. to noon and 4–8 p.m.
Museo Correale
This interesting museum was the home of a local aristocratic family who
donated it to the town, along with their collection of art. Besides the
beauty of the villa itself, overlooking the sea, you’ll find all the original fur-
nishings as well as a collection that includes a few Flemish masters and a
number of precious objects and valuable porcelains.

The best gelato on the coast
Gelato is our guilty pleasure, and we are hard to please — but we’d be perfectly happy
to return again and again to Davide Il Gelataio (Via Padre Reginaldo Giuliani 41; 
% 081-8781337), which produces such enticing flavors as delizia al limone (lemon
delight) — oh so delicious indeed — and cioccolato ai canditi (dark chocolate and
candied orange peel). You’ll have a hard time choosing: Davide makes some 60 dif-
ferent flavors.

Via Correale, off Piazza Tasso. % 081-8781846. www.museocorreale.com.
Admission: 8€ ($10). Open: Wed–Mon 9 a.m.–2 p.m.
San Francesco
This average 18th-century church hides a treasure inside: its splendid
14th-century cloister, done in the typical local mix of styles that merges
Eastern influence with Western. On selected nights, the cloister becomes
the beautiful setting for classical music concerts (see “Living it up after
dark,” later in this section).
Piazza Francesco Saverio Gargiulo. Admission: free. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–1 p.m. and
2–7 p.m.
More cool things to see and do
 If you like marquetry furniture, you’ll be delighted by the display of
the Bottega della Tarsia Lignea Museum (Via San Nicola 28; % 081-
8771942; Admission: 8€/$10; Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–1 p.m.), housed
in the 18th-century Palazzo Pomaranci Santomaso. You can admire
the frescoes that decorate the ceilings as well as a collection of some
of the best examples of this local traditional craft spanning the 19th
century.
 Swimming is definitely one of the best things to do here, but don’t
expect soft sandy beaches: The rugged coast that makes this area
so beautiful, and the sea so attractive, yields only a few tiny
stretches of sand — like the one at Marina Grande — and some
rocky beaches. Hotels have gotten around this dilemma by rigging
piers that extend into the sea and are equipped with beach chairs
and umbrellas. If you don’t mind a pleasant hike, you can also head
to Punta del Capo, with the best beach in town — and a few Roman
ruins to top it all off. Take Via del Capo heading west out of town;
the trail starts at Piazza Capo di Sorrento. Even easier: Hire a boat
to take you there, and you can admire the coast along the way.
 Provided you can convince yourself to abandon your lounge chair,
hiking is a major possibility here, with trails crisscrossing the
promontory behind town. They’re well marked, but local book-
stores and newsstands also carry an excellent map.
Living it up after dark
In high season, Sorrento has a lively cultural life that’s mostly centered
on music, with concerts — mostly classical music but not exclusively —
scheduled at major hotels and churches around town. At the tourist
office (Via Luigi de Maio 35; % 081-8074033; www.sorrentoturismo.
com; Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–6 p.m., plus July–Aug Sun 9 a.m.–12:30 p.m.),
you can pick up the free magazine Sorrentum, the best source for infor-
mation on all events.

colorful local dance) — or Matilda (% 081-8773236; cover 10€/$12),
with DJ music and a somewhat younger clientele. Or hit the pubs: The
most popular in town are Chaplin’s Video Pub (Corso Italia 8; % 081-

also like the Merry Monk (Via Capo 6; % 081-8772409), a bit farther
away.
Fast Facts: Sorrento
How a myth begins
Established by the Etruscans and taken over by the Greeks, beautiful Sorrento was a
thriving town. Such was the beauty of this peninsula — and so treacherous its 
seas — that it was believed to be the headquarters of the sirens, the half-woman/half-
animal creatures who used their enchanted songs to lure mariners onto the rocks and
to their destruction. Taken over by the Romans, Sorrento had already become an ele-
gant resort by the first century B.C. At the end of the Roman Empire, the Goths occu-
pied the town, but it was reconquered by the Byzantines in A.D. 552 and remained part
of their Duchy of Naples until the 11th century. Though it succeeded in becoming an
independent city-state for a few decades, it fell again, first under the Normans in 1133,
and then the Angevins. With the Saracens continuously menacing this stretch of coast,
Sorrento lived through difficult years until it was basically razed to the ground by the
Saracens in 1558. The Sorrentines didn’t lose their spirit, however, and immediately
began reconstruction work, surrounding the town with a new set of walls and a
number of watchtowers. Since then, Sorrento has kept up its role as enchanted land,
attracting travelers and not letting them go — or at least keeping their hearts.

Chapter 20: Sorrento, Capri, and the Amalfi Coast 429
Capri and the Blue Grotto
Emperor Tiberius retreated to the island of Capri to concentrate on his
own decadent pleasures. Idyllic in the off season, and full of charm in 
any season, Capri is just a short ferry ride away from Naples, Sorrento,
Positano, or Amalfi. This famous island has been a haunt for eccentric
characters (such as movie stars hiding out, artists in exile, and the like)
for decades. Whether you stay for a day or a year, remember to bring
very little luggage or expect to hire a porter when you land: The island is
quite steep and you may have to walk up many steps to get to your hotel.
Getting there
From Naples, you can catch one of the frequent ferries at Molo Beverello,
in the Stazione Marittima: Metrò del Mare (% 199-446644; www.metro
delmare.com) makes only one daily run on line MM4 (a 50-minute trip)
to Capri at 4:25 p.m., with return from Capri at 10:50 a.m., but the ticket
costs just 4.50€ ($5.40) and includes ground transportation for 45 min-
utes before and 45 minutes after the ferry link. Or you can take one of 
the four daily run by Caremar (% 081-5513882; www.caremar.it) for
6€ ($7.20); the trip takes 90 minutes. If you prefer the faster aliscafo
(hydrofoil) — a 35-minute trip — SNAV (% 081-7612348; www.snav.it)
and NLG (% 081-5527209; www.navlib.it) make several runs a day; a
few are from Molo Beverello, but most are from the hydrofoil terminal in
Mergellina; tickets are 12€ ($14).
From Sorrento, you can choose between hydrofoil or regular ferry; they
all leave from Marina Piccola. The companies are Caremar and NLG, as
from Naples (see earlier in this chapter), as well as Linee Lauro (% 081-
5522838; www.alilauro.it) and Linee Marittime Partenopee (% 081-
55513236). Tickets are 13€ ($16) for the hydrofoil and 7€ ($8.40) for the
regular ferry.

You can also get to Capri from the Amalfi Coast with Alicost (% 081-
7611004; www.alilauro.it) or NLG (see earlier in this chapter), which
offer several daily runs by hydrofoil or ferry from Positano (hydrofoil
13€/$16; regular ferry 9€/$11), Amalfi (hydrofoil 14€/$17; ferry 10€/$12),
and off Molo Manfredi in Salerno (hydrofoil 15€/$18; ferry 11€/$13).
Ferries and hydrofoils arrive at Marina Grande in Capri. From the ferry
terminal, you can take a taxi (see “Fast Facts: Capri,” at the end of this
section) or the picturesque funicolare (funicular) up the steep coast to
the town of Capri. Regular bus service also links Marina Grande, Capri,
Marina Piccola, Anacapri, Faro (Lighthouse), and Grotta Azzurra. A regu-
lar ticket costs 1.30€ ($1.60) for either the bus or the funicular; you can
also get a 60-minute ticket for 2.10€ ($2.50), valid for one funicular run
and unlimited bus runs during the time limit, or a day pass for 6.70€
($8), valid for two funicular rides and unlimited bus service.
You’ll find the local tourist office at Piazzetta I. Cerio 11 (% 081-8375308;
www.capritourism.com).
Spending the night
If you want to stay overnight, hotels in Anacapri are cheaper and qui-
eter, as they’re set among the vineyards of the hills. If you’d like to be 
in the heart of things, though, Capri offers much more in the way of
nightlife and glitzier hotels. If you’re traveling in the off season when
most hotels are closed, or arriving without a reservation, contact the
tourist office for assistance (Piazzetta I. Cerio 11; % 081-8375308; www.
capritourism.com).

in the splendid private gardens with swimming pool. Guest rooms are large
and furnished in high-comfort modern style. Those with sea views have
private balconies. All have spacious marble bathrooms with all the com-

If you don’t get too distracted by the great view of the Faraglioni, you will
be able to enjoy the very good cuisine of this restaurant. Among the local
dishes, the paccheri con frutti di mare e rucola (pasta with seafood and
arugula) was excellent, as were the other homemade pastas. The fish sec-
ondi change daily; meat and vegetarian dishes are available as well. We
enjoyed the eggplant, zucchini, and cheese carpaccio. Leave room for the
delicious homemade desserts.

NEAPOLITAN/CAPRESE
Tucked away on a small street a short distance from Capri’s piazzetta, this
is one of our favorite restaurants on the island. The food is always fresh
and well prepared, from the splendid and rich antipasto buffet to the large
choice of meat and seafood dishes. The red snapper all’acquapazza (in a
light herbed broth) and the totanetti affogati (baby squid stewed in herbs
and wine) were very good, and so was the veal Sorrento.

CAPRESE/PIZZA
This excellent restaurant, right in the center of tranquil Anacapri, serves
some of the best food on the island; an added perk is the chance to dine
outdoors in good weather. Do try the ravioli alla caprese (with mozzarella,
basil, and tomatoes) — it’s the best we’ve had — and enjoy the local and
fragrant bread with the daily catch or one of the meat dishes. We also
highly recommend the pizza and the desserts: The torta caprese (almond
cake) is a local specialty.

Exploring Capri
Boat tours of the island leave from Marina Grande (where the ferries 
and hydrofoils from Naples arrive). A complete tour of the island will cost
you about 19€ ($23) per person with either Gruppo Motoscafisti (www.
motoscafisticapri.com) or Laser Capri (www.lasercaprisrl.com).
Both companies offer other excursions as well, such as a short trip to the
Faraglioni, Capri’s famous cliffs.
The top attractions
Anacapri
This is the smaller of the two towns on the island and the one that’s higher
up. The steep climb from Capri could technically be done on foot (see
“More cool things to see and do,” later in this section), but it’s a lot easier
by taxi or bus — a hair-raising ride along the cliff road. The natural beauty
of the place can be best enjoyed from the terraces of Villa San Michele
(Via San Michele; % 081-8371401; www.sanmichele.org; Admission:
5€/$6; Open: Mar–Apr and Oct daily 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m., May–Sept daily 
9 a.m.–6 p.m., Nov–Dec daily 10:30 a.m.–3:30 p.m.), the splendid 19th-
century villa of Swedish doctor Axel Munthe.
Capri
This is the most picturesque — and largest — town on the island, a hive
of activity, glamorous hotels, cafes, and shops. The heart of it all is the
famous piazzetta (Piazza Umberto I) and the little streets around it;
another popular spot is the terraces of the public gardens — the Giardini
di Augusto — which afford superb views.
Grotta Azzurra (Blue Grotto)
Kids will love visiting this underwater cave that can be reached only by
small rowboat, though some adults may find it a bit less comfortable. This
natural wonder conjures up visions of pirates and buried treasure; Capri’s
top attraction, it is unfortunately so overrun with tourists that it is diffi-
cult to truly enjoy. The most common way to visit is to board one of the
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
432

large motorboats leaving from Marina Grande, and then be shuttled in a
small rowboat that takes only a few people at a time down to the entrance
of the grotto, and under the narrow passage — so narrow and low that if
you’re not limber or if you have claustrophobia, you won’t like it: The slow
sinking of the grotto over time has reduced the opening to slightly more
than 1m (3 ft.) above sea level.
Once inside, though, you’ll immediately understand what all the commo-
tion is about, and you’ll even forget about the outrageous money you’ve
paid to see it. The grotto was known to the ancients — you’ll see a little
landing just inside the entrance that dates back to Roman times, but was
later lost to the world until an artist stumbled upon it in 1826. Inside the
cavern, light refraction (the sun’s rays entering from an opening under the
water) creates incredible colors and a magical atmosphere — stunning,
indeed. Alas, chances are you won’t be able to stay as long as you’d like,
because at the height of tourist season no lingering is allowed. For all these
reasons, we think that the grotto, like Capri in general, should be seen in
the off season, if possible.
Another way to reach the grotto is by taking the bus to the stop by
Anacapri, hence skipping the motorboat ride. From there, you can directly
take the rowboat ride. We much prefer this option. Technically, you could
also swim inside the grotto — a wonderful experience if you’re a good
swimmer — but definitely not to be attempted in high season and during
the hours of operation of the large motorboats and the incessant boat traf-
fic. Whatever your means of access, you will need to pay the admission.
Note that rowboat operators welcome, and deserve, a tip: Their rates have
been officially blocked from any increases for many years.
Near the northwestern tip of the island. Admission: Grotto only 4€ ($4.80); rowboat
ride 4.50€ ($5.40); boat tour from Marina Grande (including rowboat ride inside the
grotto and admission) 17€ ($20); land excursion from Anacapri (including rowboat
ride inside the grotto and admission) 8.10€ ($9.70). Rowboat operators welcome tips.
Open: Daily 9 a.m. to 1 hour before sunset.
Marina Piccola and the Faraglioni
A tiny and picturesque harbor on the south shore of the island, this is
where you can admire the Faraglioni, the tall cliffs off the island’s south-
eastern tip, Capri’s famous landmark. The local beach offers perfect views,
but you can also hire a boat to take you closer to this natural attraction.
Monte Solaro
This is the highest point on the island. From Anacapri, you can take the
chairlift up to the top, or walk up the trail. The views from up here are
absolutely breathtaking, especially on a clear day, when you can see Mount
Vesuvius and the entire bay.
Chairlift at Via Caposcuro 10, Anacapri. % 081-8371428. Tickets: 4€ ($4.80) one-way,
5.50€ ($6.60) for the 12-minute round-trip ride. Ride operates Mar–Oct 9:30 a.m.–
sunset; Nov–Feb 10:30 a.m.–3 p.m.
Chapter 20: Sorrento, Capri, and the Amalfi Coast 433

Villa Jovis
During his self-imposed exile here, Emperor Tiberius built several villas
on the island, where he could enjoy all sorts of illicit pleasures far away
from the prying eyes of the Roman Senate. The Villa Jovis, the palace
where Tiberius lived, extended over several levels for an estimated 5,850
sq. m (63,000 sq. ft. — just a modest summer home), but is now only a
romantic ruin from which you get beautiful views.
Viale Amedeo Maiuri, at the eastern tip of the island. www.villajovis.it.
Admission: 2€ ($2.40). Open: Daily 9 a.m.–sunset; ticket booth closes 1 hour earlier.
More cool things to see and do
 Capri boasts beautiful cliffs and views of the sea, the Bay of Naples,
and Vesuvius, which can be best enjoyed by going on a hike. If
you’re moderately fit, the windy roads climbing up the promontory
offer fantastic vistas. The best and most popular trail is the Scala
Fenicia, originally the only road connecting Anacapri to Capri,
which was built by Greek colonists almost 3,000 years ago. This
path is so steep that it’s actually a staircase (scala means “stairs”)
with over 500 steps. We recommend you descend the stairs from
Anacapri rather than climbing up from Capri.
 If you like swimming, you won’t be disappointed: The water is
beautiful and marvelously refreshing under the hot sun. Because
Capri is very rocky, however, its beaches are small, and the easy-
to-reach ones are beautiful but often crowded, such as those of
Marina Piccola (where you can rent umbrellas and beach chairs).
The best approach is to avail yourself of one of the small boats that
will take you to a difficult-to-reach beach for about 10€ ($12). The
Bagni di Tiberio is a nice sandy beach on the north side of the
island, near the ruins of an ancient villa. You can take a boat there
from Marina Grande or walk on a rough trail (allow about half an
hour). The beach is freely accessible and not too crowded.
Shopping for local treasures
We know of people who come to Capri to shop — and there are indeed
some nice clothing, accessories, and jewelry shops carrying merchan-
dise that you wouldn’t find on the mainland. The perfume maker
Carthusia has two locations, one in Capri (Via Camerelle 10; % 081-
8370358) and one in Anacapri (Via Capodimonte 26; % 081-8373668); 
it has made unique perfumes with local herbs and flowers since 1948.
Another good store is Canfora (Via Camerelle 3; % 081-8370487), which
carries handmade, high-quality, good-looking sandals. If you’re looking
for prestigious jewelry, you should not miss La Perla Gioielli (Piazza
Umberto I 21; % 081-8370641), selling wonderful creations since 1936.
We have only two words for you: Happy hunting!

Chapter 20: Sorrento, Capri, and the Amalfi Coast 435

The Amalfi Coast
The Amalfi Coast’s terraced cliffs overlooking the sea are blanketed with
lemon trees, olive groves, and vineyards interspersed with small villages
and historic towns; its waters are clear and blue, lapping the small sand
and rocky beaches, making it the perfect spot for an interesting and relax-
ing vacation. The queen of the coast is Amalfi, a small harbor town with
a charming medieval center and mementos from its glorious past; fol-
lowed by elegant Ravello — overlooking the sea from its own valley —
and Positano, the most picturesque of all, with its small harbor opening
between towering cliffs. Many other small villages would also be worth-
while if you had the time: You could stay here a week or spend only the
day, depending on your interests and schedule.

The Amalfi Coast
Chapter 20: Sorrento, Capri, and the Amalfi Coast 437

Getting there
What makes this place beautiful is also what makes it difficult to get
here: The road is narrow and winding, sometimes without a guard rail,
and it’s cut into the side of tall cliffs. Traffic and speeding locals (seem-
ingly attached to your rear bumper) don’t make it any easier. There 
are several ways to get to the Amalfi Coast, as we discuss later in this
chapter — driving yourself is just not one of them.
By far the best way to visit the Amalfi Coast if you’re coming for a day
trip is hiring a car with a driver, which allows you to enjoy the scenic
drive in complete comfort and at your own pace. ANA Limousine
Service (Piazza Garibaldi 73; % 081-282000) and Italy Limousine 
(% 081-8016184 or 335-6732245; www.italylimousine.it) in Naples,
or 2golfi car service (Via Deserto 30/e, Sant’Agata sui due Golfi; % 339-
8307748 or 338-5628649; www.duegolficarservice) near Sorrento, are
all reliable companies that use new, air-conditioned cars and minivans,
with trained English-speaking drivers who double as guides. Prices vary
depending on your needs, the car you choose, and the number of people
in your group, but the hourly rate is about 35€ ($42) for two people. You
can arrange for pickup at your hotel, the Naples airport, the rail station,
or Stazione Marittima.
Taking a ferry is the best way to get here if you have a little time on your
hands. The newly created Metrò del Mare (% 199-446644; www.metro
delmare.com) makes several daily runs to Amalfi and Positano (Apr–Sept
only) from Molo Beverello in Naples; the trip to Positano takes 75 minutes
on the express line (MM2) and about two hours on the local line (MM3);
allow 25 extra minutes to Amalfi on either line. You can use the special
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
438
The Amalfi Drive
When this stretch of coast was discovered by tourists back in the 19th century — the
famed road that winds along the cliffs (SS163) was built in 1840 — visitors were few
and far between, and traveled slowly by horse-drawn carriages. When it became a
fave destination for the jet set of the Dolce Vita and their artsy friends in the 1950s and
early 1960s, tourists were rare, and the few lucky ones traveled in convertible cars
with Sophia Loren by their side. If that’s the image in your head when you picture your-
self driving along the Amalfi Coast, well, think again: SS163 is still the same road (not
any larger or more modern than back then) and the beauty of the place is still quite
unspoiled, but the crazy traffic and noise on that narrow road are at times unbearable.
You can still have your scenic drive, provided you’re not the one driving, and you’re
doing it in the off season in the very early hours of the morning. Just hire a limousine
service and have them take you; even better, skip the drive altogether and go for a
hike instead.

ticket Terra and Mare, which includes ground transportation for 45 min-
utes before and 45 minutes after the ferry link for about 8.50€ ($10). The
company Alicost (% 081-7611004) offers year-round ferry service, as
well as faster hydrofoil service during high season, to Positano and
Amalfi from Sorrento and Capri. Rates vary depending on your destina-
tion and point of departure, but estimate about 14€ ($17) for the hydro-
foil and 11€ ($13) on the regular ferry. Make reservations at least 24
hours in advance. Cooperativa Sant’Andrea (% 089-873190; www.
coopsantandrea.it) offers regular motorboat service from Sorrento
and Salerno to Amalfi, Positano, and a number of points in between; tick-
ets range from 5€ to 9€ ($6–$11), depending on the distance.
A cheaper way to get to this stretch of coast is by taking buses operated
by SITA (% 081-5522176; www.sita-on-line.it), which make daily
runs from Naples, Sorrento, and Salerno to both Positano and Amalfi.
Local lines to Ravello — and to a number of other villages and hamlets 
in the area — start from the SITA bus terminal at Piazza Flavio Gioia in
Amalfi (% 089-871009). The trip from Naples should cost about 4€
($4.80) and take about two hours. The ride can be hair-raising at times —
you’ll be grateful that you’re not driving the bus — but it’s certainly
panoramic.
Spending the night
The coast and its cliffs are dotted with places to stay, ranging from small
hotels to beautiful resorts. Here are some of our favorites:
Casa Albertina
$$
Positano
The favorite hotel of Luigi Pirandello — the famous Sicilian writer and 
playwright — this small family-run house is a well-hidden gem in busy
Positano. Each guest room is different from the others, simply furnished
but with care and taste, and all have private balconies opening onto the
sea. Bathrooms are not large, but do come with all the essentials. In high
season, only a half-board plan is offered (all rates include dinner, whether
you want it or not).
Via della Tavolozza 3. % 089-875143. Fax: 089-811540. www.casalbertina.it.
Parking: 22€ ($26) in a garage nearby. Rack rates: 230€–280€ ($276–$336) double.
Rates include breakfast and dinner. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel Lidomare
$
Amalfi
This moderately priced hotel near the beach is housed in a 13th-century build-
ing. The guest rooms are brightly decorated in typical Amalfitan style (tiles,
strong colors, lots of sparkling white). Most rooms have air-conditioning, the
bathrooms are small but very clean, and the staff is extremely friendly and
welcoming to families with children.
Chapter 20: Sorrento, Capri, and the Amalfi Coast 439

Largo Duchi Piccolomini 9. % 089-871332. Fax: 089-871394. www.lidomare.it.
Parking: 15€ ($18). Rack rates: 120€ ($144) double. Rates include breakfast. AE, MC, V.
Hotel Luna Convento
$$$$
Amalfi
With a splendid position on the promontory of Amalfi, overlooking the sea,
this family-run hotel offers elegant and romantic accommodations. An
ancient monastery founded by St. Francis in 1222, it was transformed into
a hotel in 1822; you can still visit the original cloister and chapel, as well
as the watchtower from 1564. The large and bright guest rooms are indi-
vidually decorated, with whitewashed walls, fine fabrics, and vaguely
Moorish-style furnishings. All rooms have views of the sea and large tiled
bathrooms; some have private terraces. The hotel also has a large salt-
water swimming pool, a solarium, and two excellent restaurants, one more
upscale and the other less formal.
Via Pantaleone Comite 33. % 089-871002. Fax: 089-871333. www.lunahotel.it.
Free parking. Rack rates: 240€ ($288) double. Rates include breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel San Pietro
$$$$
Positano
One of the best hotels in the world, this abode to the rich and famous is still
family run with hard-to-find warmth and professional efficiency. The gorgeous
public areas include terraces, a garden, a pool, and a private, elevator-
accessible beach. You can relax in perfect style in the commodious guest
rooms, bright with hand-painted tiles and cozy with antiques. The bath-
rooms are done in pink marble. The restaurant is one of the best in the
region.
Via Laurito 2. % 089-875455. Fax: 089-811449. www.ilsanpietro.it. Free park-
ing. Rack rates: 380€ ($456) double. Rates include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Closed Nov–Mar.
Palazzo Sasso
$$$$
Ravello
This is one of the oldest hotels in Ravello — it opened in 1880 — but it’s
been completely refurbished since closing down in the 1960s. Housed in
an 11th-century palazzo, it is a haven of elegance and style, receiving its
guest in rooms furnished with antiques and appointed with all the com-
forts, including spacious marble bathrooms. Some of the guest rooms have
glorious views. The restaurant is one of the best in town.
Via San Giovanni del Toro 28. % 089-818181. Fax: 089-858900. www.palazzo
sasso.com. Rack rates: 296€–590€ ($355–$708) double. Rates include buffet break-
fast. AE, DC, MC, V. Free parking. Closed Nov to mid-Mar.
Part VI: Naples, Pompeii, and the Amalfi Coast 
440

Villa Cimbrone
$$$
Ravello
Residence of the Vuillemier family, this villa welcomes a small number of
guests in great luxury and privacy. Each room is unique and decorated
with antiques; some of them have views over the park, while others have
private terraces overlooking the sea. From Ravello, call the hotel; it will
send a porter to carry your luggage to the hotel. The villa is an attraction
in itself (see “The top attractions,” later in this chapter), and its restau-
rant is both beautiful and excellent.
Via Santa Chiara 26. % 089-857459. Fax: 089-857777. www.villacimbrone.it.
Rack rates: 250€–450€ ($300–$540) double. Rates include breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Closed Dec–Mar.
Dining locally
On the Amalfi Coast, the sea reigns, making this a paradise for seafood
lovers. Besides the restaurants we describe later in this chapter, con-
sider also those inside the best hotels reviewed earlier in this chapter,
offering romantic locations and quality food.
Cumpà Cosimo
$$
Ravello
AMALFITAN
At this great family-run spot, you can order all the local home-style spe-
cialties, but at lower prices than in the more “resorty” restaurants. You
will see locals with their families, especially at lunchtime on the weekend.
The pasta is very good, as are the secondi, among which you’ll find a
worthwhile zuppa di pesce (fish stew) and a fine fritto misto (deep-fried
mixed seafood). Half-portions and kid-friendly menu items will please the
little ones.
Via Roma 44. % 089-857156. Reservations recommended. Secondi: 11€–28€
($13–$34). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Tues–Sun 12:30–3 p.m. and 7:30–11 p.m.; Apr–Oct
daily.
Da Adolfo
$$
Positano
AMALFITAN/SEAFOOD
Located right on the beach of Laurito, a short boat ride from Marina
Grande (the free shuttle boat, marked with a red fish, leaves every 30 min-
utes), this restaurant, which doubles as beach club, offers excellent food
and a relaxed atmosphere. You can swim (a beach chair and umbrella rent
for 7€/$8.40 per day) and delight in an array of seafood antipasto and
seafood dishes. We recommend the delicious spaghetti with mussels as
well as the grigliata di pesce (a choice of several kinds of grilled fish and
seafood).
Spiaggetta di Laurito. % 089-875022. Reservations recommended. Secondi: 12€–18€
($14–$22 No credit cards accepted. Open: Daily noon to 3 p.m.; July–Aug also Sat 
8 p.m. to midnight. Closed Oct–May.
Chapter 20: Sorrento, Capri, and the Amalfi Coast 441

Da Gemma
$$$
Amalfi
AMALFITAN
One of the most popular restaurants on this stretch of coast, Da Gemma
has been serving repeat customers for over a century. It specializes in tra-
ditional dishes of the area: The zuppa di pesce per due (fish stew for two)
is definitely a winner; the fritto misto is one of the lighter fried mixed
seafoods we’ve tasted; and the polipo (tender octopus) is simply great.
The homemade crostata (a thick bread topped with jam, a typical Italian
home-style dessert), prepared with local citrus-fruit jam, also deserves a
mention. Half-portions and child-friendly foods are available.
Via Fra Gerardo Sassi 9. % 089-871345. Reservations required. Secondi: 16€–25€
($19–$30). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Thurs–Tues 12:30–2:45 p.m. and 7:45–10:30 p.m.; daily
in summer. Closed mid-Jan to mid-Feb.
Da Salvatore
$
Ravello
AMALFITAN
This down-to-earth restaurant is a favorite hangout with locals as well as
visitors. Everybody enjoys the traditional food prepared according to local
family recipes, as well as the splendid setting with views from both the
dining room and the garden terrace. We recommend the gnoccoloni al
pomodoro e basilico (potato-based dumplings with fresh tomatoes and
basil).

Exploring the Amalfi Coast
Beaches, seaside resorts, small farming villages up the cliffs, fishing vil-
lages by the sea — the Amalfi Coast is varied and beautiful. The attrac-
tions of the coast are mainly natural; people come to explore the
spectacular cliffs, play in the sea, and eat delicious seafood.
The top attractions
Amalfi
The largest of the small towns on this stretch of coast, Amalfi is today a
pleasant fishing harbor and resort. The medieval part of town — including
the old harbor — is rich in monuments that are mementos of its past
importance. The imposing Duomo (Piazza del Duomo; % 089-871059;
Free admission; Open: Daily Nov–Feb 10 a.m.–1 p.m. and 2:30–4:30 p.m.;

gold leaf and majolica and is flanked by a charming belltower finished in
the 13th century. The portal is closed by a bronze door that is only slightly
less famous that the one in the Duomo of Ravello (see later in this chap-
ter), but still magnificent; the grandiose staircase leading to it was added

Amalfi’s glory days
The first of Italy’s maritime republics — the city-states that dominated the
Mediterranean sea and its commerce starting in the tenth century — Amalfi once sur-
passed Pisa, Genoa, and Venice in both power and riches. Created in ancient Roman
times, Amalfi declared its independence from the Byzantine empire in A.D. 839, as it
had developed into an important commercial harbor thanks to its great strategic loca-
tion. Its moment of glory came between the 10th and the 12th centuries, when it domi-
nated the southern Mediterranean. When you walk the narrow streets of medieval
Amalfi, imagine this as the cosmopolitan heart of the republic, where peoples from all
over the known world intermingled and exchanged their goods. Amalfi’s notables and
VIPs mostly lived outside town, in the hills or nearby resorts; Ravello was the resi-
dence of some of the wealthiest merchant families of Amalfi. Even after the fall of the
city-state by the hands of Pisa in 1135, it continued to be an important center for com-
merce with the East throughout the 13th century.

in the 18th century, when the Duomo was enlarged. To the left is the
entrance of one of the most beautiful cloisters you’ll ever see — the
Chiostro del Paradiso (Admission: 3€/$3.60; Open: Daily June–Oct 
9:30 a.m.–7 p.m.; Nov–May 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.), which has a small collection
of antiquities. It gives access to the Chiesa del Crocifisso (Church of the
Crucifix), the original cathedral from the tenth century that was integrated
into the Duomo. From the Church of the Crucifix, you can descend into the
crypt containing the remains of St. Andrew. The apostle’s face is missing:
It was donated to the Cathedral of St. Andrew in Patras, Greece.
Off the main square, you can visit the ruins of the medieval shipyard (Via
Matteo Camera, off Piazza Flavio Gioia; Free admission; Open: Easter–Sept
9 a.m.–8 p.m.), where the once-powerful city-state built its galleys. These
were big ships moved by sails and oars — up to 120 for a 130-foot ship —
used for both defense and commerce with the East through the
Mediterranean. Near the end of Amalfi’s period of glory in the 12th cen-
tury, a series of violent sea storms (due to a seaquake) destroyed part of
the shipyard, which was never rebuilt.
The republic was also famous for its paper industry, which produced a
particularly kind of paper called bambagina. Paper from Amalfi was
shipped all over Europe, and still is to this day: This art has been pre-
served in town, where descendants of the ancient master papermakers are
still at work, producing paper of an almost forgotten quality. It’s sold to
the most exclusive paper shops in Europe and the U.S. The Vatican, for
one, uses Amalfi paper for its official correspondence (see “The paper of
Amalfi” sidebar, later in this chapter). We enjoyed visiting the workshop of
Antonio Cavaliere (Via Fiume; % 089-871954), whose trademark is paper
with dried wildflowers caught between the fibers. His shop, open during
regular business hours, is outfitted with the traditional equipment of the
trade. The water for his craft still comes from the covered river that
crosses town and was the key resource in the development of the paper
industry in Amalfi.
You can actually follow that river inland and out of town toward the hills
(start at Piazza del Duomo and head up Via Genova), where you can
explore the Valle dei Mulini (Valley of the Mills). A pleasant and easy
walk, the path stretches down the narrow valley of the river, along which
the old paper mills are still visible. You can find out more about the indus-
try at the very interesting Museo della Carta (Museum of Paper), Via delle
Cartiere 23 (% 089-8304561; www.museodellacarta.it; Admission:
3.40€/$4.10; Open: winter Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–1 p.m., summer daily 10 a.m.–
6 p.m.), filled with antique presses and yellowing manuscripts.
Besides paper, Amalfi is famous today for its lemons. Unique in size, sweet-
ness, flavor, and color, the lemons of Amalfi are exported as rare gems to
markets around Italy. If you come at harvest time, you can see lemons
being processed all over town: turned into the famous limoncello, a sweet
lemon liqueur, but also into delicious confections such as candied lemons,
jams, and lemon ice cream.
Limoncello has a very nice taste, but few people can drink it straight. If
you buy a bottle, you will probably want to use it to flavor cakes, cook-
ies, and other sweet preparations.

Positano
Positano is a seaside resort made exclusive by its topography. The west-
ernmost of the three most famous towns on the Amalfi Coast, Positano is
also the most dramatic. Built in the narrow gap between two mountains,
the village slopes steeply to the Tyrrhenian Sea.
The village develops vertically and, as you’ll soon discover, is impossibly
steep. You may want to wear comfortable shoes without heels to climb the
steep alleys and many ramps of steps.
Don’t expect white Caribbean beaches here: The beach is gray and rather
pebbly. The sea, however, is splendid. Just off the coast are the legendary
Sirenuse Islands, Homer’s siren islands in the Odyssey, which form the pri-
vately owned mini-archipelago of Li Galli (The Cocks).
This elegant resort village’s small alleys are filled with boutiques, restau-
rants, and hotels. Aside from the picturesque alleys, the big attraction 
here — you’ll notice it the moment you step into town — is the local style,
known as Positano Fashion. Fabrics and particularly swimsuits — whether
maillot, bikini, or thong — all have colorful and unique patterns. Because
people here spend two-thirds of their time in swimsuits, this local indus-
try has exploded. We know someone who buys her bikinis only in
Positano, no matter how far she has to travel to get them!
Ravello
The only one of the major towns that’s not on the coast, Ravello opens
onto a splendid valley with intensive cultivation — vineyards and lemons
and other fruit grow on its steep terraced flanks. The town has a feeling
of subdued elegance, the evidence of its magnificent past — and its past
Chapter 20: Sorrento, Capri, and the Amalfi Coast 445
The paper of Amalfi
Called bambagina, Amalfi’s paper is made from macerated cloth fibers, which are then
filtered and pressed into large frames. Such an art was learned from the Arabs of the
Middle East, with whom the Republic of Amalfi enjoyed flourishing commercial rela-
tionships. Researchers actually believe that the name bambagina is a distortion of the
Arab town that perfected this paper-making technique, El Marubig. The paper indus-
try developed in Amalfi in the 12th and 13th centuries, and continued its expansion
through the Renaissance and into modern times. The first machines were introduced
in the 18th century, and only the development of cheaper paper manufacturing from
wood pulp, in the 19th and 20th centuries, drove the local industry nearly out of busi-
ness. The higher quality of its product kept it alive, though, and Amalfi still produces
and sells paper throughout the world, in spite of the harsh competition. What makes
this paper so special is that its fibers are very soft, making it wonderful to handle and
allowing special effects as in the work of Antonio Cavaliere (see earlier in this chap-
ter), which would be impossible with the harsher and less flexible fibers making up
other qualities of paper.

and present exclusiveness. Celebrities and writers favor this town; the
reigning celeb of the moment is Gore Vidal, who purchased a villa as a
writing retreat.

Salerno
If you happen to be in the area, it would be a real shame to miss out on Salerno’s little-
visited and off-the-beaten-track attractions. From the splendid seafront promenade to
the medieval city, graced by one of the most beautiful cathedrals in all southern Italy,
Salerno does not disappoint. You can get here by train from Naples in 35 minutes
(trains depart every 15 minutes from Stazione Centrale), or by ferry and hydrofoil from
Sorrento, Capri, and the Amalfi Coast run by Alicost (% 089-234892) and Travelmar
(% 089-2227979; from Amalfi, Positano, and Minori only). April through September,
you can also get here from Naples via the Metrò del Mare (% 199-446644; www.
metrodelmare.com), a two-hour ferry ride. You’ll find one tourist office at Via Roma
258 (% 089-224744) and a smaller one inside the train station at Piazza Vittorio Veneto.
An Etruscan town founded in the sixth century B.C., Salerno grew in importance under
the Romans to become one of the leading cultural centers in Italy. In medieval times
and during the Renaissance, its medical school was the top research center in the
whole Western world. It then lost its primacy, as Naples was made the capital of the
Southern Kingdom and became progressively larger and more powerful, leaving
Salerno to fall into quiet oblivion.
The second-most-important harbor in the region, after Naples, Salerno today is 
a modern town bustling with activity and a cultural life dominated by its important 
university. At its heart is the medieval town, centered around Piazza Sedile del 
Campo — the picturesque old market square — and the beautiful Duomo (Piazza
Alfano I; % 089-231387; Free admission; Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.). This 11th-century
cathedral is one of the most beautiful Romanesque churches in Italy, with delicate
carvings decorating its halls and portals (the main one closes with a set of bronze
doors from Constantinople). Inside, do not miss the monumental candle holder, mosaic,
inlay, and carved masterpieces. Attached to the church is the museum (Via Monsignor
Monterisi; % 089-239126; Free admission; Open: Daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.), well worth a
visit to see the 12th-century paliotto (altar front) decorated with 54 carved panels. Four
frames are missing; each is the coveted possession of a museum: Paris’s Louvre, New
York’s Met, and the museums of Berlin and Budapest.
From Salerno, you can catch a regular bus (several companies leave from Piazza della
Concordia, among them SCAT;% 0974-838415) to nearby Paestum. You can also hire
a car with driver — the best option if your time is limited — who will double as guide;
one reliable company is Leonardo D’Onofrio (Via Cesare Pavese; also sign up for a
guided tour). If you are at all interested in antiquity and don’t have time to go to Sicily,
Paestum is an all-important destination: Three magnificent temples, a few ruined
abodes, and long sections of fortified walls are all that remain of this powerful Greek
city, once dominating the whole of southern Italy. You can walk the walls — affording
beautiful views of the sea — but the key attractions are the well-preserved temples,

The 11th-century Duomo (Piazza Vescovado; % 089-858311; Admission:
Duomo free, Museum 2€/$2.40; Open: Daily winter 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 
4–7 p.m., summer 8:30 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–8 p.m.) is a splendid Romanesque
church, with a grandiose carved triple portal and an elegant bell tower
from the 13th century. The bronze door closing the center arch of the
portal was sculpted in 1179 by Barisano da Trani, and cast in
Constantinople: It is one of Italy’s most beautiful, rivaling the doors in
Florence’s Baptistery and Pisa’s Duomo. Inside, to the left of the main altar,
is the Cappella di San Pantaleone, the chapel of the patron saint of
Ravello. It contains a relic of the saint (a cracked vessel with his blood,
which miraculously fails to leak away when it liquefies once a year). The
blood is a symbol of the saint’s violent demise: He was beheaded in
Nicomedia on July 27, 290. Ravello holds a festival on that day every year.
The crypt houses a small museum, where the star of the show is the beau-
tiful sculpture by the 13th-century artist Bartolomeo da Foggia, depicting
the bust of Sichelgaita della Marra, a local noble woman.
To the right of the Duomo is the beautiful 13th-century Villa Rufolo (Piazza
Vescovado; % 089-857657; Admission: 5€/$6; Open: Daily summer 
9 a.m.–8 p.m., winter 9 a.m.–5 p.m.), with its splendid gardens that play
host to part of the Ravello Festival (see later in this section). Although

pink hue. Admission to the archaeological area (Via Magna Grecia; % 0828-811023;
www.infopaestum.it; Open: Daily 9 a.m.–sunset) is 4€ ($4.80), plus 4€ ($4.80) for
the museum (combination tickets 6.50€/$7.80), which is closed the first and third
Monday of each month.
Another excursion is to the fantastic Carthusian Monastery of Padula (% 097-577484;
Open: Sun and holidays 8 a.m.–sunset, other days by appointment), a Renaissance
and baroque masterpiece. This is rarely visited because of its remote location in the
hills inland of Salerno, but it’s worth your time. You can take a bus with Curcio Viaggi
(% 089-254080; www.curcioviaggi.it) from Piazza della Concordia in Salerno
(and also from Firenze and Siena), or with Autolinee SLA (% 0973-21016; www.
slasrl.it) from the same piazza in Salerno or from Naples. The complex is huge,
covering over 46,450 sq. m (500,000 sq. ft.), with gorgeous cloisters and elegant cells
for the monks, the most beautiful of all being the apartments of the Prior, of course. It
is worth visiting the archaeological museum (% 097-577745; Admission: 3€/$3.60;
Open: Daily Oct 1–Mar 31 9 a.m.–7 p.m.) to see the monastery’s original library and
reception halls, which house the exhibits.
You can stay in Salerno at the Jolly Hotel delle Palme (Lungomare Trieste 1; % 089-
225222; www.jollyhotels.it) and dine very well at the elegant Cenacolo (Piazza
Alfano I 4; % 089-238818; Open: Tues–Sun 12:30–3 p.m., Tues–Sat 7:30–11 p.m.), across
from the Duomo, serving local cuisine with a creative twist. Or settle for simpler fare
and excellent pizza at Zi Renato (Via Roma 170; % 089-228018; Open: Daily 12:30–
3 p.m. and 7:30–10 p.m.). In Paestum, you can stay at Mec Paestum (Via Tiziano 23; 
% 082-8722444; www.mechotel.com).

the renovations by its 19th-century Scottish owner somewhat altered the
original beauty of the building, much of its architecture still deserves a
visit, from the elegant entrance hall to the grand reception and main halls
to the romantic loggias of the inner court. In the gardens, you can visit the
Terrazza Wagner, where the German composer received his inspiration
for the Klingsor Garden scene in his Parsifal. The views are truly splendid.
Going farther up from the center of town (a steep ten-minute walk), you
can reach Villa Cimbrone (Via Santa Chiara 26; % 089-858072; Admission:
5€/$6; Open: Daily 9 a.m.–7 p.m., winter until sunset), the fruit of the exten-
sive renovations of a 15th-century villa by an eccentric English lord, who
bought it at the end of the 19th century. The views and the gardens are
very beautiful — particularly the famous Belvedere Cimbrone, a terrace
lined with statues and opening onto a breathtaking panorama stretching
from Capri to Paestum, beyond Salerno. You can also visit part of the villa,
which has been turned into a hotel and restaurant (see “Spending the
night,” earlier in this chapter). Ring the bell at the entrance, and a member
of the staff will let you in and take you around.
More cool things to see and do
Many people drive the Amalfi Coast and stop at only one or two of the
towns, usually Amalfi or Positano. But the smaller towns and destina-
tions are worth exploring, too. Here are a few recommendations:
 About 5km (3.1 miles) west of Amalfi — on foot or by boat — is the
Grotta dello Smeraldo (Emerald Grotto), an underwater grotto less
famous than Capri’s Blue Grotto, but to the eyes of some, even more
beautiful. What’s unique about this grotto is its ancient formation of
stalactites and stalagmites, which have been partially invaded by
seawater. As a result, some of the formations are submerged, creat-
ing fantastic effects of light and shade. The boat takes you inside and
around this bizarre world. It’s open daily from November through
February from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and March through October from 
9 a.m. to 7 p.m., weather permitting. The cave is accessible from 
the sea; regular launch service is available from Molo Pennello in
Amalfi, from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., for 10€ ($12) round-trip. Or from
land, you can take the SITA bus (Amalfi–Positano line; get off at the
km 26.4 milestone on SS163) and go down a steep staircase or take
the elevator. Admission to the grotto is 5€ ($6) per person, which
includes the elevator ride from the road down to sea level and the
boat ride to and inside the cave.
 The Amalfi Coast is a seaside resort, so naturally you can enjoy 
its many small sandy beaches, sunbathe, and swim in the blue
Mediterranean. The beach in Amalfi is nice but crowded; you’ll do
better in the small towns of Maiori and Minori, two villages nearby
to the south and easily reached by SITA bus. In Positano, besides
the large and crowded beach by Marina Grande in the center of
town, you can access Fornillo to the west and three small beaches
to the east, followed by the nice beach of Laurito.

Area Code
The local area code is 089 (see “Telephone”

ATMs
You’ll find banks with ATMs along the main
streets and in the main square of each of
the major towns, including a Banco di
Chapter 20: Sorrento, Capri, and the Amalfi Coast 449
 Hiking is the best way to enjoy this stretch of coast. One very
pleasant trail takes you through ramps and alleys from the center
of Ravello (by a small fountain at the left of Villa Rufolo) down to
Minori, a village on the seashore; allow about half an hour for the
descent and double that for the climb back (or take a bus back).
Another easy trail is along the Valle dei Mulini in Amalfi, up to the
so-called “ruined mill” about one hour uphill. You could then con-
tinue on the moderately difficult hike along the Vallone delle
Ferriere. This valley, which has been declared a World Heritage Site
by UNESCO, is a protected natural area where you can find some
animal and vegetable species from the Quaternary and Tertiary
period, before glaciation. The whole trail is 12km (7.4 miles) long.
From Positano, you can take the famous Via degli Incanti, a trail
that goes all the way to Amalfi — a distance of 25km (15.6 miles) —
along the steep coast, or at least the section of it called Sentiero
degli Dei (Trail of Gods), starting to the right of Chiesa Nuova in 
the north of town.
Living it up after dark
During the summer months, this whole stretch of coast comes alive with
cultural events, mostly centered on music and the figurative arts. The
music festivals, featuring everything from classical to jazz, animate the
sweet summer nights. The most famous of all is the Ravello Festival 
(Via Roma 10–12; % 089-858422 or 199-109910 for reservations; www.
ravellofestival.com), attracting international artists and a crowd of
connoisseurs. Held in Ravello from June to September, it offers a great
number of concerts and performances by the big names — mostly, but
not entirely, classical. Special series include the Festival Wagneriano, in
Villa Rufolo, and the Dawn Concerts, held, well, at dawn (by 4 a.m.). The
price of events ranges from free to about 130€ ($156), depending on the
performance.
Concerts are scheduled in Amalfi as well; the most popular are those
held in the Chiostro del Paradiso, in Amalfi’s Cathedral, on Friday nights
from July through September.
In Positano, Summer Music is a festival of chamber music that takes 
place from the end of August through September. For a schedule of
events, contact the tourist office (% 089-875067; www.aziendaturismo

Part VII
Sicily

In this part . . . 
“You cannot understand Italy without seeing Sicily.
Sicily is where you can ﬁnd the key to everything.”
These words, which Goethe wrote in 1787, still hold true
today. Visiting Sicily is a unique experience: It’s a more
intense version of Italy, where things from the past are pre-
served with a magic vitality and hit you with strength and
clarity. It is also a splendid Mediterranean island where you
can abandon yourself to the task of enjoying life, the food and
wine, and the sea and sun.
In Chapter 21, we tell you everything you need to know about
Palermo, Sicily’s capital and southern Italy’s largest art
center. In Chapter 22, we present the other top destinations in
Sicily: beautiful Taormina; sleepy and mysterious Syracuse;
Agrigento, with its breathtaking Valley of the Temples; as well
as a few side trips — Segesta, Selinunte, Piazza Armerina, and
Catania — all rich in art and attractions.

 Getting the best deals on lodging — and the best meals
 Enjoying the sights and activities
S
icily is a big chunk of Italy, both geographically and culturally.
Palermo — the island’s capital and a busy modern port — has been
the political center of “new” Sicily since about 1060 onward. A unique
melting pot of cultures — from Arab to Norman to Spanish — it is a city
rich in stunning works of art and local character. Behind a decaying but
elegant facade, you’ll find some of the region’s — and the country’s —
finest art, particularly in the splendid churches, but also in the good
museums. Similarly, behind their more formal manners and customs,
you’ll get to know the Sicilians as a warm and welcoming people, ready
to help you enjoy your visit.
You can see Palermo’s highlights in one day, but we recommend you
dedicate at least two days to this splendid city. Palermo is also a good
starting point for exploring the rest of Sicily, especially if your time is
limited and you want to take advantage of the numerous day excursions
that are offered from here (see “Seeing Palermo by guided tour,” later in
this chapter).
Getting There
Sicily is well connected with the rest of Italy, as well as with major desti-
nations in Europe and in the Mediterranean. The major ports of entry to
the island are Palermo, described in this chapter, and Catania (see
Chapter 22), each with an important harbor, airport, and, of course, train
and bus stations.
By ferry
Of the many ways to get here, our favorite is the overnight ferry: Not only
do you get to enjoy some fabulous views, but you can also comfortably
sleep in your cabin and have more time for sightseeing the next day. Sev-
eral ferry companies serve Sicily: SNAV (Via Giordano Bruno 84; % 081-
4285555 in Naples, 0766-366366 in Civitavecchia; www.snav.it) runs 

ferries daily from Naples and every other day from Civitavecchia (the
harbor about one hour north of Rome and easily connected to the capi-
tal by very frequent train and bus service, as well as car service). Tirrenia
(% 892123 in Italy, or 081-0171998 from abroad; www.tirrenia.it)
operates daily overnight service from Naples. Grimaldi Ferries (% 081-
496444; www.grimaldi-ferries.com) offers weekly service between
Salerno (on the Amalfi Coast) and Palermo. Rates vary depending on the
season, the seats or cabin chosen, and whether you’re bringing a car;
they range from around 60€ to 150€ ($72–$180) per person. It takes
about 11 hours to travel from Naples or Salerno to Palermo, and 13
hours from Civitavecchia.
By air
Flying is less romantic than taking the ferry, but it’s a lot faster. Daily
flights connect Palermo to all other destinations in Italy and most major
destinations in Europe (from the U.S., you’ll need a connecting flight).
Alitalia (% 06-2222, or 800-223-5730 in the U.S.; www.alitalia.it
or www.alitaliausa.com) has several flights a day from Italian cities 
to Sicily. Meridiana (% 892928 in Italy, or 0789-52682 from abroad;
www.meridiana.it) may offer better deals from some Italian 
destinations.
All flights arrive at Palermo’s airport, Falcone Borsellino (% 800-541880
or 091-7020111; www.gesap.it) — locally called Punta Raisi — located
31km (19 miles) west of Palermo. In the arrivals concourse, you’ll find a
bank with ATM, a currency-exchange office, and a tourist information
desk; public transportation is just outside the terminal.
The airport is a 25-minute taxi ride to the center of town; expect to pay
about 40€ ($48). The airport is also connected to the city by rail: Trains
run every hour (every half-hour at peak times) and cost 4.50€ ($5.40).
You can also take the bus, run by Prestia & Comande (% 091-586351),
to Palermo’s rail station; it departs every 30 minutes and makes five
stops in town, including the modern harbor and the Teatro Politeama. It
takes about half an hour and costs 5€ ($6).
By train
Sicily is served by train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) from all
major destinations: Cars are put on a train ferry at Messina and then
continue on to Palermo. The trips are long, but sleeping cars can be
quite comfortable if you book a single, double, or triple cabin; regular
cuccetta (sleeping berths) in a six-seat compartment are more cramped.
The ride from Rome to Palermo takes 11 or 12 hours and costs about
90€ ($108). Trains arrive at Palermo’s Stazione Centrale, at Piazza
Giulio Cesare (% 091-6165914), on the southeastern edge of the historic
district.

Orienting Yourself in Palermo
Palermo is a port city, organized around its busy waterfront: To the west
is the modern harbor, with piers for large ships; to the east is the old
harbor — La Cala — a rounded basin where sailing and fishing boats
bob sleepily in the sun. Via Francesco Crispi is the major thoroughfare
running along the waterfront from the modern harbor to La Cala. The
historic district centers around and inland of the old harbor. To the east
is La Kalsa, the ancient Arab quarters, with Piazza Marina by the harbor
and Piazza Magione at its heart; to the south and west are the four man-
damenti (neighborhoods) of the old town. This is neatly divided into
four sections by Corso Vittorio Emanuele (running northeast to south-
west and leading from the old harbor to the royal residence of Palazzo
dei Normanni) and Via Maqueda (running northwest to southeast and
leading from Piazza Verdi, with the Teatro Massimo, to Piazza Giulio
Cesare, with the train station and bus terminal), intersecting at Piazza
Vigliena, appropriately called Quattro Canti (Four Corners) by locals.
Parallel to Via Maqueda to the north is Via Roma.
During the 19th century, the city expanded to the west, developing the
modern harbor and, inland, a residential and commercial neighborhood.
The heart of this more modern section of the historic district is Piazza
Castelnuovo, with the Teatro Politeama, crossed by the continuation of
Via Maqueda — Via Ruggero VII — and its further continuation to the
northwest, Via della Libertà, the elegant avenue leading to the gardens
of Villa Trabia and Giardino Inglese.
Farther to the north is Monte Pellegrino, a steep mountain overlooking
the sea; up the hill to the south is Monreale, a separate town overlook-
ing the city (it is to Palermo as Fiesole is to Florence). The great attrac-
tion here, enough in itself to justify your whole trip to Sicily, is the
Duomo, with its cloister (see later in this chapter).
Introducing the neighborhoods
All of the neighborhoods below are safe. For tips on safety, see “Getting
Around Palermo,” and “Safety” under “Fast Facts: Palermo,” both later in
this chapter.
La Kalsa
The most famous — and once the most notorious — neighborhood in
Palermo, this residential area of picturesque narrow streets stretches
southeast of the old harbor. There was a time when visitors and locals
wouldn’t come here at all if they valued their lives: Crooks and thugs
had made this neighborhood their headquarters. Today, it’s perfectly
safe (although do observe typical big-city caution) and is now the focus
of an exuberant nightlife, cultural, and dining scene (see “Exploring
Palermo,” later in this chapter).

Piazza Castelnuovo
Less picturesque than the old town, but much more elegant, this neigh-
borhood was first developed in the late 19th century. This is the modern
heart of Palermo, its streets lined with boutiques, restaurants, theaters,
and, of course, hotels. The Teatro Politeama, where opera and ballet 
are staged (see “Living It Up After Dark,” later in this chapter), is the ren-
dezvous point for locals of every age, who meet here in noisy and color-
ful groups before heading for their evening destination, whether a
restaurant or a simple stroll. One favorite stroll is along beautiful Via
Libertà, which is lined with Liberty (Italian Art Nouveau) palaces.
Piazza Verdi
Dominated by the beautiful Teatro Massimo, where opera and concerts
are presented, this neighborhood sits at the hinge of the old town of 
the Quattro Canti (see later) and the 19th-century district of Piazza
Castelnuovo (see earlier). It shares some of the characteristics of each,
preserving a historical feeling yet more stately and well maintained than
the oldest neighborhoods in town. Centrally located, it is within walking
distance of many attractions and is not far from the modern harbor, with
its numerous hotels and restaurants.
Quattro Canti
The heart of the oldest part of town along with La Kalsa (see earlier),
this is where you’ll find most of the attractions in the historic district,
including some of Palermo’s most important monuments, such as La
Martorana, Palazzo dei Normanni, and the Cattedrale. This area is
home to many hotels and restaurants, an active nightlife scene, and
lively shopping — including the famous Vucciria open-air market.
Finding information after you arrive
The main tourist office is at Piazza Castelnuovo 34, across from the
Teatro Politeama (% 091-6058351; www.palermotourism.com; Open:
Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–2 p.m. and 3–6 p.m.); it maintains two tourist info points,
one at the airport (% 091-591698; Open: Mon–Fri 8 a.m. to midnight,
Sat–Sun 8 a.m.–8 p.m.), and one at the train station on Piazza Giulio
Cesare (% 091-6165914; Open: Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–2 p.m. and 3–6 p.m.).
Getting Around Palermo
Modern Palermo sprawls between the mountains and the sea, but the his-
toric district and its sights are fairly concentrated, making it easy to visit.
Despite the police’s best efforts, purse-snatchers (often operating from
motor scooters) and pickpockets are a common reality. Backpacks are
especially susceptible, as their bottoms can be easily sliced without
your noticing it. Observe common big-city caution and, at night, avoid
deserted, run-down streets, as muggings are not unheard of.
Part VII: Sicily 
458

On foot
Palermo is an interesting city to discover on foot; the city layout is
simple, making it easy to find your way. Among the hidden surprises of
the back streets in the historic district are forlorn blocks with partially
destroyed buildings — some by World War II bombings, others by earth-
quakes — that are still unrepaired. We have walked down some of these
streets (by day) to look at the shuttered villas of the Sicilian aristocracy
and never had any problem, but everyone has their own comfort level. If
you don’t feel comfortable, turn around and take a different street.
The free map from the tourist office is perfectly adequate for most visi-
tors; if you want more detail, you can pick up a map with stradario
(street directory) at most news kiosks.
By bus
Palermo’s bus system (% 848-800817; www.amat.pa.it) is functional
and well run. Regular bus tickets cost 1€ ($1.20) and are valid for two
hours; you can save a little if you want to invest in a carnet of 20 indi-
vidual tickets, selling for 19€ ($23); you can also get a giornaliero (day
pass) for 3.50€ ($4.20). Tickets are sold at tobacconist stores and news
kiosks around town; you can get a free bus map at the information office
at Via Giusti 7 (Open: Mon–Wed 8 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–5:30 p.m.; Thurs–Fri
8 a.m.–1 p.m.).
The three electric minibus lines (red, yellow, and green) are convenient
for visiting all the important attractions in Palermo; they loop through
the historic district Monday through Saturday from 7:45 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
and Sunday and holidays from 7:45 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Use them as you
would a hop-on/hop-off tour bus; the ticket costs 3€ ($3.60) and is valid
for one day on all lines.
By taxi
Taxis are an excellent way to get around Palermo; you’ll find taxi stands
at all the major squares — Piazza Indipendenza, Piazza Verdi, Piazza
Castelnuovo — as well as at the modern harbor and the train station. You
can also be picked up anywhere by calling a radio taxi (% 091-225455
or 091-513311). The meter starts at 3.50€ ($4.20) and goes up 0.65€
(78¢) for every additional kilometer (2⁄3 mile); you’ll also pay a 1.50€
($1.80) night or holiday surcharge and, for radio-taxi calls, the meter
reading from where your taxi came from to pick you up. However, expect
to pay a few euro more than what the meter shows: Because official
rates haven’t been adjusted since 1995 (it’s true, we checked), taxi driv-
ers award themselves an inflation increase over what the meter reads.
It’s a lot easier — and will avoid friction on both sides — if you ask the
driver to estimate the charge for your destination upfront, rather than
being surprised by an extravagant amount upon arrival. Ask the concierge
at your hotel for the likely charge for your destination and, if need be,
negotiate with the driver. If it doesn’t sound reasonable, take another cab.
Chapter 21: Palermo 459

Staying in Style
Hotels in Palermo are mixed, ranging from old-fashioned accommodations
that are remnants of a previous era (beware of those) to modern, up-to-
international-standards hotels. Rates tend to be considerably lower than
in other major Italian destinations such as Venice, Rome, and Florence, so
you can stay in superior hotels without paying through the nose.
If you arrive without a reservation, check with the tourist office for 
assistance — it maintains information desks at the airport and the train
station (see “Information” under “Fast Facts: Palermo,” later in this 
chapter).

Monreale
We’re not great fans of staying out of the historic district when that’s what
you’ve come to see, but we have to make an exception for this wonderful
place. Housed in a historic baglio (paper mill) on the slopes of the hill of
Monreale, south of Palermo, it is located 10km (6 miles) away from the city
center and only 3km (2 miles) from Monreale. Perfectly restored, the villa
welcomes its guests in elegant public spaces done with frescoed ceilings
and wooden beams; guest rooms are splendid, with a good mix of modern
comforts and countryside elegance. The hotel’s restaurant, Absidi, is quite
good and open to the public. Note: If you’re driving instead of taking a 
cab, be forewarned that the hotel is off the main road and not easy to find
after dusk.

Teatro Massimo
Once a private home, the Grand Hotel opened in 1874 and immediately
became the place to stay in Palermo: Wagner finished writing his Parsifal
here. The classically inspired lobby has marble floors, Greek columns,
chandeliers, marble staircases, and original Art Nouveau furnishings.
Guest rooms are spacious and grand, but not all of them have been
updated, and some are rather staid. The excellent buffet breakfast is
served in the Hall of Mirrors (Sala degli Specchi) — a superb hall used also
for private receptions — and the hotel’s restaurant, La Palmetta, serves
lunch and dinner fare.

Grand Hotel Villa Igiea

Monte Pellegrino
The best hotel in Palermo is not only a hotel, but also a historic site: A
former private villa on the outskirts of town, Villa Igiea is a masterpiece of
the Sicilian Liberty (Italian Art Nouveau) style, completely designed —
right down to the furnishings — by Sicilian architect Ernesto Basile. The
hotel is surrounded by splendid terraced gardens overlooking the bay. It
features two restaurants with a panoramic terrace, a piano bar, and a salt-
water pool. The spacious guest rooms are as glamorous as the public
areas, with elegant furnishings and fine fabrics; some offer glorious views
and private terraces. Be aware that some of the cheaper rooms may not
have been renovated and could be a bit worn, with aging bathrooms.

bathrooms and private terraces; some have views of Monte Pellegrino, the
mountain overlooking Palermo. Although the hotel is small, it offers a
pleasant lounge for guests.

Dining Out
Even within Italy, where every town seems to lay claim to a unique cuisine,
Sicily is exceptional: The Sicilians perfected multiculturalism centuries
ago, so here you can find pasta and meats seasoned with pistachio nuts,
almonds, North African spices, and, because Sicily is an island, many
culinary treasures from the sea (see Chapter 2 for details).
Two dining areas well worth checking out are Piazza Marina, behind the
recreational harbor of La Cala, and the area around the Teatro Politeama,

CREATIVE SICILIAN
This is our favorite gourmet restaurant in Palermo — your taste buds will
be tickled by a cuisine that integrates traditional flavors with some of the
best ingredients from elsewhere on the Italian peninsula. The colorful
modern décor is welcoming, and we love the terrace in good weather. Your
menu may include such dishes as swordfish and smoked-tuna pâté served
with confit of fresh figs, or perhaps zucchini-stuffed lamb with garlic and
fresh mint. The desserts are excellent, and if you like wine, you’ll find a
well-rounded list with some unusual bottles.

SNACKS
More of a snack place than a restaurant, this eatery is a Palermo institution
for those in the know. Here you’ll find some delicious and difficult-to-find
staples of Sicilian traditional fast food, served since 1834. The best is pan-
elle (chickpea fritters), arancini (deep-fried stuffed rice balls), and the
more recent addition of focaccia farcita (stuffed pizza). If you’re daring, try
the house specialty, deep-fried spleen sandwich, served with or without
cheese (we prefer without, but also decided we could live very well with-
out the whole thing altogether).

Located in the more elegant part of the town center, Capricci di Sicilia is

sardines and wild fennel), maccheroni alla Norma (with eggplant), invol-
tini di pesce spada (rolled and stuffed swordfish), and trionfo di pesce

This trattoria, opened in 1890, claims to be the oldest in Palermo. Indeed,
the dining room is very atmospheric, but the old-fashioned ambience isn’t
a bit ruined by the new air-conditioning. We love coming here for the buffet
of antipasti, always including a large variety of traditional fish and veg-
etable specialties, as well as for the traditional primi — our faves are pasta
alla Norma (with eggplant) and pasta con le sarde (with sardines) — and
the well-prepared grilled fish. It gets very crowded at lunch, so come early.

In the residential area a short distance north of the center, this is an excel-

menu includes some successful innovative touches. We loved the squid-ink
pasta with seafood ragout, the mackerel with caper sauce, and the polpet-
tine di pesce azzurro al finocchio selvatico (wild-fennel fish cakes). Desserts
are also very good.

until 9 or even 9:30 p.m. in summer — or be prepared to wait. Try the superb
pasta con le sarde (pasta with sardines, fennel, and tomato sauce) or the pasta

proprietor Alberto Rizzo has become renowned. Try the soup made with
local mushrooms, or perhaps the mushroom, potato, and thyme ravioli

in hazelnut crust is also worthwhile. In a land known for idiosyncrasy,
Rizzo earns that reputation. The 45€ ($54) tasting menu is a great deal.

Exploring Palermo
If you’re planning to visit several attractions in town, one good deal is
the combination ticket to La Zisa, San Giovanni degli Eremiti, and the
cloister of the Duomo of Monreale. It’s valid for two days and sold at any
of the participating attractions for 12€ ($14).
Discovering the top attractions
Just wandering around the historic district is fascinating — note the vari-
ous styles and cultural overlays that bear witness to Palermo’s variegated
history. The old town, centered around Piazza Vigliena, is a sight unto
itself; the small square is appropriately called Teatro del Sole (Theater of
the Sun) because you can see the sun from sunrise to sunset, and it is very
picturesque . . . but you should not miss the nearby Piazza Bellini — one
of the most attractive squares in town — nor Fontana Pretoria on Piazza
Pretoria, at the intersection of Via Vittorio Emanuele and Via Maqueda.
Created for a Florentine villa, this magnificent 16th-century fountain was

The Mafia
The region’s reputation as headquarters of the Mafia and its bloody vendettas scared
people away from Sicily, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, when the internal fights
between the new generation — mostly drug traffickers and thugs — and the old 
generation — the “men of honor,” as they liked to call themselves — allowed the
police to butt in and bring to justice many criminals. The magistrates stood up to the
challenge, some at the cost of their lives (Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino were
slaughtered in 1992), and started a crackdown that cleared much ground and lifted
the heavy veil that had weighed upon the island for so long. Most of this is now 
history — you can even visit the Mafia Museum in Corleone (Palazzo Provenzano, Via
Orfanatrofio 7; % 091-8464907) — but as with all recent history, it has left scars that
are slow to heal. The changes are tangible and far-reaching: The trials spawned a
Sicilian renaissance that has brought about restoration and reopening of monuments
that had been closed for decades, and, even more important, a jolt of cultural and eco-
nomic energy that has given new life to the island.

sold to the Palermo Senate when the villa’s owner died. The nudes cre-
ated a big scandal at the time, and for a while it was called the “Fountain
of Shame.”
Cattedrale and Museo Diocesano
Palermo’s cathedral was built in 1185 atop a mosque that was itself built
atop a Byzantine church. In this architectural sandwich, some material
was reused; for example, in the portico is a column (first on the left) with
an engraved inscription from the Koran, an unusual feature for a Catholic
church. The church went through many renovations, but the Romanesque
exterior is still original; this creates quite a shock when you go in and find
yourself deep into baroque. Many masterpieces are hidden inside: Look
for the bas-reliefs by Vincenzo and Fazio Gagini on the altar, and for the
Madonna with Child by Francesco Laurana in the seventh chapel of the
left nave (Laurana’s famous sculpture of Eleanora d’Aragona is in the
Galleria Regionale Siciliana — see later in this chapter). The apses are the
only section of the interior that are still original from the 12th century.
From a door to the right of Santa Rosalia chapel inside the cathedral, or
from the garden outside, you can access the crypt and the treasury; the
latter contains a variety of precious objects, including chalices, vestments,
and other utensils of the Catholic rite, as well as the crown of Constance
of Aragon, the wife of Frederick II. The cathedral also houses the tombs of
Sicily’s kings and emperors, including those of Holy Roman Emperor
Frederick II and Roger II.
Recently open to the public, the Museo Diocesano is housed in the beau-
tiful archbishop’s palace attached to the cathedral to the left (entrance on
Via Matteo Bonello). It holds a great collection of religious art from the
12th to the 19th centuries.

Chiesa del Gesù
Most commonly called the Casa Professa, after the library attached to the
church, this was the first church in Sicily founded by the Jesuits. Its inte-
rior is rich in stucco work by several members of the Serpotta family
(famous Palermitan sculptors who operated between the 17th and the 18th
centuries). We love the beautiful marble inlays, in a large range of colors,
that decorate the altar and walls. The original Renaissance church, in the
form of a Latin cross (a nave and two short aisles), was much changed in
the following century by the Jesuit Natale Masuccio, who made it into one
of the most ostentatious churches of the Sicilian baroque. The lavish

bombing, which partially destroyed the church.

Chiesa della Martorana
Built in 1143 by Giorgio di Antiochia, admiral to Ruggero II, this church was
transformed during later centuries, but its stunning Byzantine mosaics
were luckily preserved, magnificently depicting religious scenes from the
life of Mary. The mosaic on the balustrade contains an interesting detail:
It shows Roger II getting his crown directly from Christ and not from the
pope — a direct political statement against the church in Rome. The name
Martorana comes from the nearby convent, founded by the Martorana
family. Tradition says that the nuns there invented the little marzipan fruits
that today are a typical — and delicious — souvenir from Sicily. They still
sell the original creations: bunches of grapes made of almond paste, each
grape delicately painted with sugar, the stems made of candied orange
peel covered in dark chocolate — a bit expensive, yes, but a treat fit for 
a king.

Duomo di Monreale
Overlooking Palermo about 10km (6 miles) away, Monreale dominates 
the city from its beautiful hill. The great attraction here, enough in itself 
to justify your whole trip to Sicily, is the Duomo, with its cloister. This
12th-century Romanesque church is one of the most breathtaking in 
existence. It may not be exceptional for its Norman exterior — the Duomo
in Palermo is more interesting — but the interior is extraordinary. The
church is decorated with 6,000 sq. m (55,000 sq. ft.) of fabulous Byzantine
mosaics depicting scenes from the Old and New Testaments; only in
Constantinople — in the Hagia Sofia — did the Byzantines create a more
extensive series of mosaics. The floors are also magnificent, made up of
remarkable marble mosaics, and the bronze doors by Bonanno Pisano
(designer of Pisa’s famous tower) are masterpieces. You can also visit the
treasury, with its collection of precious religious objects, and the terraces,
from which you can enjoy pretty views over the attached cloister and the
town.
Annexed to the church is the cloister from 1180, one of the most beautiful
in Italy. A unique work of art, its 228 double columns are decorated with indi-
vidual details, some with mosaic inlay and each with a different pattern; the
carved stone capitals are amazingly intricate renderings of scenes such as
battles, the punishment of the damned, and stories of obscure meaning with

Galleria Regionale Siciliana
Housed in the 15th-century Palazzo Abatellis — in elegant late Catalan-
Gothic style — this is the principal museum of Sicilian art from the 13th to
the 18th centuries. Among the many treasures inside, the 15th-century
Triumph of Death is a powerful and intriguing fresco that came from the
hall of the 1330 Palazzo Sclafani in town: A skeleton on horseback fires
arrows at pleasure seekers, rich prelates, and other sinners as the poor
and ill look on (the two artists who did the fresco painted themselves in
this group). The faces are incredibly expressive; Picasso could have done
the horse’s head. One of the words that comes to mind when seeing this
work is “modern.” It’s unfortunate that its creator’s identity is not known.
Our favorite painting is Antonello da Messina’s Madonna Annunziata,
looking out from under a blue mantle, which displays the painter’s
uncanny ability to portray more than one emotion at the same time.
Part VII: Sicily 
468
A bit of history
Although today Palermo may seem off the beaten track in terms of tourism, its treas-
ures attest that it was once the center of an empire: Holy Roman emperor Frederick II
(1194–1250) was born in Italy, and he made Palermo his capital. It eventually became
one of the most renowned and magnificent courts in the Western world. Before that,
Palermo had been an important Phoenician, Greek, Roman, and Byzantine harbor, but
it was only with the Arabs, in the ninth century, that it gained importance in the
Mediterranean. The new rulers made Palermo into Sicily’s capital, gracing the flour-
ishing commercial and cultural center with beautiful palaces and innumerable
mosques (over 300, it is said). Little remains of that period: The Normans erased most
traces of the Arab presence when they took over the city in 1072, transforming most
of the palaces and churches with their own architectural style. Sicily was taken over
by Spain in the 15th century and was reunited with Italy by the Bourbons in the 18th
century.
Palermo suffered severe damage by earthquakes in the early 20th century and was
bombarded in World War II; much of it seems to have never recovered. However,
Palermo’s intertwined traditions have left behind a city like no other in the world, where
“multiculturalism” has flourished since the early Middle Ages.

Francesco Laurana’s splendid marble bust of Eleonora d’Aragona is one
of the most famous works in Sicily.

La Kalsa
This is one of Palermo’s oldest neighborhoods, created by the Arabs as
their emir’s walled citadel when they took over the island and the town in
A.D. 831. Left undisturbed — and decaying — the neighborhood had
become one of the most dangerous areas in Palermo until the late 1980s,
when a successful plan of renovation and revitalization transformed it into
a lively cultural destination, attracting intellectuals and artists as well as
regular people who come for the many events, restaurants, and nightlife.
Although some of the area still needs refurbishing, it is extremely inter-
esting to explore.
La Kalsa developed around Piazza Magione, southeast of Piazza Marina
and Palermo’s old harbor, La Cala. The grandiose battle scene between
Garibaldi and the Bourbons in the famous Visconti movie Il Gattopardo
(The Leopard) was filmed on Piazza Magione. Piazza Marina is one of La
Kalsa’s main features, with its beautiful garden enclosed by elegant
Liberty-style iron railings and graced by an impressive giant ficus. Via
Alloro was the citadel’s main street, as you can see from the once-elegant
palaces lining it. Unfortunately, much of the Arabs’ fine work was
destroyed when the Spanish viceroys took over, adding their own archi-
tectural interpretations, and many of the later palazzi were damaged or
destroyed by earthquakes and World War II, and are now mostly semi-
abandoned. For an idea of what they looked like in their former splendor,
visit Palazzo Mirto (Via Merlo 2; % 091-6164751; Admission: 3€/$3.60;
Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m., Sun and holidays 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m.), which

example of the irrepressible Sicilian baroque, lavishly decorated inside

13th-century San Francesco d’Assisi (Piazza San Francesco, off Via Merlo;
% 091-582370; open occasionally), with a superb 14th-century portal and
handsome carvings inside its magnificent chapel Mastrantonio.

time. Its dark alleys and decaying buildings can be intimidating at night.

Museo Archeologico Regionale Salinas
Built on the site of a monastery, this museum occupies several buildings
and contains what is probably the most impressive archaeological collec-
tion in the country. Walking through its rooms is a good introduction to
Sicily’s ancient history, from pre-historic findings to Roman times. On the
ground floor, you’ll see the major art finds from Greek and Roman sites on
the island, particularly from Tindari, Solunto, and Selinunte. One of the
most famous pieces is the head of Medusa. The basement houses a recon-
struction of clay decorations of a Greek temple, while in the Sala Marconi
you’ll find a partial reconstruction of the cornice moldings with lion heads
from the Temple of Victory in Himera. The museum also holds beautiful
Roman bronze statues — note in particular the bronze statue of a ram —
and a fair amount of Etruscan pottery and other objects. Also remarkable
are the Phoenician works dating from the fifth century B.C., including sar-
cophagi depicting human images.

Palazzo dei Normanni and Cappella Palatina
Built over an ancient Roman palace — itself probably built over a
Carthaginian building — this palazzo embodies the island’s culture of con-
tinuity in change. The imposing building was the castle and royal residence
of the various powers that reigned over Palermo, from the Arab emir to
the current Regional Assembly of Sicily. In the 12th century, the Normans
remodeled the palace, which had been the residence of the Arab emir. It
had four towers, of which only one remains today, the Torre Pisana. It was
remodeled again in the 16th century as the residence of the Spanish
viceroy. The royal apartments are open to the public, but because of the
parliamentary meetings, access is restricted (see details later). On the
third floor is the Sala di Ruggero, originally the bedroom of Ruggero II
(1095–1154), with mosaics representing hunting scenes and striking ani-
mals and plant forms. On the second floor is the famous Cappella Palatina
(Palatine Chapel), with its impressive decorations. The chapel, started by
Ruggero II in 1132, took over ten years to complete and is a harmony of
masterwork from different cultures — Arab artisans made the inlaid
wooden ceilings (a type of work known as muqarnas), Sicilians did the
stonecutting, and the mosaics are Byzantine. The walls and dome are com-
pletely covered with rich mosaics representing scenes from the Old
Testament (the nave), Christ’s life (the southern transept), and the lives of
Peter and Paul (the aisles). Note the candlestick by the entrance — it’s intri-
cately carved from a single piece of stone and stands over 3.9m (13 ft.) tall.

Teatro Massimo
Begun in 1875 but not completed until 1897, this building cost a fortune and
was Italy’s largest and most splendid theater at a time when Palermo didn’t
even have a good hospital. The theater is a masterpiece of Liberty style
(Italian Art Nouveau) and was designed by Gian Battista and Ernesto Basile,
the famous Sicilian father-and-son Art Nouveau stylists. The stage and back-
stage measure 1,280 sq. m (12,000 sq. ft.), the second largest in Europe after
the Opéra Garnier in Paris. Its greatest marvel is a painted ceiling with 11
panels that open like flower petals to let heat escape from the interior during
intermissions. Since the building’s conception, the only change that’s been
made is a new wood floor for better acoustics. The building was used not
only as a theater, but also as a meeting place, and these rooms were the site
of important business and political meetings. The most famous is the Sala
Pompeiana, at the level of the second loggia, where the men would meet; it’s
designed so that the sound of voices would keep bouncing from wall to wall
and not escape the room and disturb the performance. After being closed
for 23 years of restoration work, the theater reopened in 1997.

far away as Great Britain. The villa is still stocked with beautiful antiques

Santa Rosalia
If you happen to be in Palermo between July 11 and July 15, you’ll be surprised by the
enthusiastic celebrations of Palermo’s patron saint, Santa Rosalia. The festivities com-
memorate the anniversary of the discovery of the saint’s remains. Niece of Norman
King Guglielmo II, Rosalia abandoned the palace (Palazzo dei Normanni, described
earlier in this chapter) for a cave on Monte Pellegrino to live a life of prayer. Many
centuries after her death, during the terrible plague epidemic of 1624, her bones were
found and brought down the mountain. As the procession bringing her remains tra-
versed the city, the epidemic miraculously stopped (a good reason to keep celebrat-
ing her!). During the festival, a religious procession — with a huge, beautifully
decorated triumphal carriage carrying an orchestra — winds through the town.
There’s also a spectacular candlelit procession up Monte Pellegrino to Santa Rosalia’s
cave. The end of the festival is marked by great fireworks.

rooms, the Sala d`Estata (Summer Room), is decorated with trompe l’oeil
frescoes on the walls and ceiling.

Finding more cool things to see and do
The major sites of Palermo are stunning, but there’s still much more to
see and do. Here are a few recommendations:
 The city has three much-visited traditional food markets (Open:
Mon–Sat 6 a.m.–4 p.m.), where fruits, vegetables, meat, and fish
provide an explosion of colors and flavors. La Vucciria, whose
name comes from the French word boucherie (“meat store”), is in
La Kalsa and runs along Via Argenteria to Piazza Garraffello.
Ballarò is our favorite and Palermo’s oldest, running from Piazza
Casa Professa to Corso Tukory toward Porta Sant’Agata; it’s con-
nected to the market of Casa Professa, which sells shoes and sec-
ondhand clothing. Smaller Il Capo covers Via Carini and Via Beati
Paoli, crossing Via Sant’Agostino and Via Cappuccinelle. All are
best visited in the morning. Beware of potential purse-snatchers
and pickpockets riding motorini.
 We fell in love with the work of Giacomo Serpotta, the Sicilian sculp-
tor who excelled in the use of marble and polychrome, but became
famous for his stucco work — his putti (cherubs) in particular. His
masterpiece is the Oratorio del Rosario di San Domenico (Via dei
Bambinai 2, off Via Roma; % 091-6090308; www.campodivolo.it),
which he lavishly decorated between 1714 and 1717 (inside you’ll
also find Anthony Van Dyck’s Madonna of the Rosary, commissioned
during the artist’s stay in Palermo in 1624). Between 1687 and 1718,
the Sicilian sculptor decorated the nearby Oratorio di Santa Cita
(Via Valverde 3, off Via Squarcialupo, between Via Cavour and Via
Roma, on the left of the church), creating a whole world of stucco
figures and reliefs. Admission is 2.50€ ($3) for each; both are open
Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
 One of the most famous sights of Palermo is San Giovanni degli
Eremiti (Via dei Benedettini 3; % 091-6515019; Admission: 6€/$7.20;
Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m., Sun and holidays 9 a.m–1:30 p.m.).
Although it is a Christian church, it was built at the height of the
Arab-Norman style, and thus it was given five round red domes.
The church is a ruin and the inside is open to the elements; once
you’ve seen it from the outside, you have experienced most of its
charm, although its 13th-century cloister is also quite nice.
 One of the few examples of Arab architecture left in town, La Zisa
(Piazza Guglielmo il Buono; % 091-6520269; Admission: 3€/$3.60;
Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m., Sun and holidays 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m.)
dates from 1165. Known for its elegant columns and mosaics, the
palace was surrounded by a park with an artificial lake in which the
Part VII: Sicily 
472

building was reflected (a few hundred years before the Taj Mahal),
small rivers, and ponds for fish. The origin of the name is uncertain —
it may have belonged to an Arab noblewoman, Azisa, or may have
been built for King Guglielmo I (William) using Arab techniques and
hence named Al-Aziz, “The Magnificent.” The surrounding garden
has disappeared, but the building has been restored and houses a
museum of Islamic art, including a rich collection of the character-
istic carved wooden screens known as musciarabia.
 La Cuba (Corso Calatafimi 100, inside the Caserma Tukory; % 091-
590-299; Admission: 2€/$2.40; Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m., Sun 
9 a.m.–1 p.m.), a dome surrounded by gardens, is another striking
example of Arab and early Norman architecture. It was built by
Guglielmo II in 1180 in the Park of Genoardo; its beauty was so
famous that Boccaccio used it in the Decameron. The building is
only one floor, organized around a central space with a star-shaped
fountain. Today, only the external walls and giant arches remain.
 If you’re into catacombs and you aren’t squeamish, you will enjoy
the Catacombe dei Cappuccini (Via Cappuccini 1; % 091-212117;
Admission: 1.50€/$1.80; Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m. to noon and 3–5 p.m.),
which were used as a burial spot until 1920. For some reason, these
catacombs miraculously preserved the dead — or at least some of
them — and they still contain 8,000 mummified bodies of aristocratic
Sicilians and priests, still dressed in the costumes of their time.
Needless to say, this is not a “kid-friendly” sight, unless you have
teenagers.
 If you’re visiting in high season, you may want to take a break from
the art and hop onto bus no. 806 or 833 from Teatro Politeama to
the beach of Mondello (a few miles west of town beyond Punta
Raisi). A favorite with locals, it gets crowded at the height of summer
(July and Aug) but is quite nice in the shoulder season (spring and
fall), when the Mediterranean waters are mild enough for a swim.
Seeing Palermo by guided tour
The best bus tour in town is the Giro Città (% 091-6902690; www.amat.
pa.it), a hop-on/hop-off loop starting from Teatro Politeama (Piazza
Ruggero Settimo 9) daily at 9 a.m. Tickets cost 12€ ($14) per person
(children under 12 ride free) and can be purchased directly on the bus.
Another good option is City Sightseeing (% 091-589429; www.palermo.
city-sightseeing.it), whose open double-decker buses depart on
two loops every 30 minutes from Teatro Politeama; tickets cost 20€
($24) for adults, 10€ ($12) for youths 6 to 15 (children under 6 go free).
You can also arrange for your own personal tour of the city with a local
guide by contacting AGT (www.palermoguide.it; no phone); it charges
70€ ($84) for a two-hour “mini-tour” of the historic center of Palermo for
up to eight people, or 120€ ($144) for half a day.
Chapter 21: Palermo 473

Several companies organize guided tours to all the major attractions 
in Sicily, departing from Palermo on a daily basis. CST (Compagnia
Siciliana Turismo; Via A. Amari 124; % 091-7439654; www.compagnia
sicilianaturismo.it) is one of the best; it offers guided bus tours of
the island that include the Valley of the Temples in Agrigento, Piazza
Armerina, and Mount Etna. Excursions depart from both Palermo and
Taormina; those from Palermo are priced from about 20€ ($24).
Suggested one-, two-, and three-day itineraries
Palermo deserves as much time as you can give it. Here are our sugges-
tions on how to manage the time you have.
Palermo in one day
You’ll have only time for a quick bite of Palermo’s attractions, but the
taste will stay with you forever. After a nice breakfast of ice cream and
brioche — a Sicilian tradition, delicious with coffee on the side — head
for the Cattedrale, Palermo’s Duomo. Keep up your strength, however,
as you’ll need to continue on to Palermo’s most stunning attraction, the
Palazzo dei Normanni. Visit the splendid royal apartments and the 
magnificent Palatine Chapel before lunch. Dedicate the afternoon to
Monreale (a 30-minute bus ride from the Palazzo dei Normanni), visiting
the superb Duomo and its cloister, one of the world’s most beautiful.
Return to Palermo for drinks and dinner: If you head for the waterfront
in the neighborhood of La Kalsa, by the horseshoe-shaped old harbor,
La Cala, you’ll find some excellent restaurants, including the ones we
recommend in Piazza Marina (see “Dining Out,” earlier in this chapter).
Palermo in two days
In two days, you can start to savor Palermo and the best it has to offer.
On your first day, follow our “Palermo in one day” itinerary, earlier. On
your second day, start the morning with a visit to one of the historic
open-air markets — Il Capo, Ballarò, or La Vucciria (see “Finding more
cool things to see and do,” earlier in this chapter) — and then proceed
to the Galleria Regionale Siciliana. Afterward, admire the stuccowork
of Serpotta at the Casa Professa, and then get a glimpse of the marvelous
Oratorio di Santa Cita. Spend the afternoon exploring Palermo’s more
ancient past at the Museo Archeologico Regionale. Finish your day by
taking in a performance at the Teatro Massimo, or cap off your evening
with some other form of entertainment (see “Living It Up After Dark,”
later).
Palermo in three days
Follow the suggested itinerary for “Palermo in two days,” earlier. On your
third day, begin by exploring the beautiful rooms of the Villa Malfitana
before proceeding on in the same direction toward La Zisa. After lunch,
take in some more architectural marvels, or perhaps have a little adven-
ture: Visit the Grand Hotel Villa Igea and head for the beach.
Part VII: Sicily 
474

Living It Up After Dark
Nightlife in Palermo is like everything else on the island: intense and
somewhat more deeply Italian than elsewhere in the country. Leisurely
strolls take up a large share of locals’ evenings, and — as Sicilians have a
sweet tooth — you’ll often find them chatting over a pastry or an ice
cream as well. Try Antico Caffè Spinnato (Via Principe di Belmonte 115;
% 091-583231; Open: Daily 7 a.m.–1 a.m.) for luscious desserts and a
historic décor — it’s one of the oldest cafes in Palermo — or go for drinks,
pastries, and splendid ice cream at Caffè Mazzara (Via Generale Vincenzo
Magliocco; % 091-321443; Open: Daily 7:30 a.m.–11 p.m.), only about a
century old.
For more serious entertainment, head to Teatro Politeama Garibaldi
(Piazza Ruggero Settimo; % 091-6053315), which stages opera and ballet;
tickets are reasonably priced at about 20€ to 40€ ($24–$48). The splendid
Teatro Massimo (Piazza Verdi; % 800-655858; www.teatromassimo.it)
also hosts concerts and opera performances. The season runs from
October through June.
We love the traditional Teatro dei Pupi, a typically Sicilian puppet the-
ater. The pupi — dressed in armor and bright-colored fabrics — tell 
tales of Orlando and the Paladins of France and stage fights against the
Saracens, in which the audience actively participates. This traditional
art is slowly disappearing, and out of the ten companies that were pres-
ent in Palermo a couple of decades ago, only a few still perform today.
The best is the Teatro Arte Cuticchio — Opera dei Pupi e Laboratorio
(Via Bara all’Olivella 95; % 091-323400; www.figlidartecuticchio.
com), performing November through June. Tickets cost 6€ ($7.20) for
adults and 3€ ($3.60) for children; the theater also contains a museum
with a collection of pupi, machines, and special effects.
You’ll find more modern-minded crowds at I Candelai (Via Candelai 65;
% 091-327151; www.candelai.it), a club for the young and energetic
that stages live concerts and DJ dancing — often the latest rock — and a
variety of other events. Quieter and also popular is the well-established
Kandinsky (Discesa Tonnara 4; % 091-6376511). If your thing is jazz,
don’t miss Lo Spasimo-Blue Brass (Via Spasimo, off Piazza Magione; 
% 091-6161486; www.thebrassgroup.it), the temple of jazz in town,
housed in the beautiful setting of the ex-church Santa Maria dello Spasimo.
One of the best pubs, Villa Niscemi (Piazza Niscemi 55; % 091-6880820),
has music of various kinds, including, literally, pickup groups (instruments
provided), and stays open into the wee hours. Pub 88 (Via Candelai 88;
% 091-611-9967), just down the road from I Candelai, is a quieter place
to have a drink and relax. At Agricantus (Via XX Settembre 82; % 091-
487117), you may find jazz playing in the background or a group per-
forming a skit.
Chapter 21: Palermo 475

One of the few gay spots in town, Exit (Piazza San Francesco di Paola 40;
% 0348-781498), is also the best one. It has a great disco-cum-pub-cum-
cabaret.

Police
Call % 113.
Restrooms
Museums have public toilets. The best bet
for a restroom is to go to a nice-looking
cafe (though you’ll have to buy something,
like a cup of coffee).
Safety
Palermo’s historic districts are safe except
for the pickpockets and purse-snatchers
on motorini. They concentrate in tourist

areas, on public transportation, and at
crowded open-air markets, such as the 
Il Capo and the Vucciria; muggings are rare
but could occur in the most deserted streets
at night.
Smoking
In 2005, Italy passed a law outlawing smok-
ing in most public places. Smoking is
allowed only where there is a separate, ven-
tilated area for nonsmokers. If you want to
smoke at your table, call beforehand to
make sure the restaurant or cafe you’ll be
visiting offers a smoking area.
Taxes
See Chapter 5 for information on IVA (Value
Added Tax).
Taxi
Walk to one of the taxi stands in town —
Piazza Indipendenza, Piazza Verdi, Piazza
Castelnuovo, the modern harbor, or the rail-
road station — or call a radio-taxi company
(% 091-225455 or 091-513311) for pickup.
Transit info
Contact Palermo’s transportation authority,
AMAT (% 091-6902690; www.amat.pa.
it), for city bus and subway info; call AST
(% 800-234163 in Italy, or 091-6882906) for
out-of-town bus connections.
Weather Updates
Your best bet is the news on TV. (There’s no
phone number for weather forecasts in Italy,
as there is in the U.S.)

Chapter 22
Taormina, Syracuse, 
and Agrigento
In This Chapter
 Touring Taormina
 Viewing the past and present in Syracuse
 Visiting the Valley of the Temples in Agrigento
S
icily is a splendid island rich with many wonderful destinations.
Taormina — a city that flourished during the Roman period and
again from the 19th century on — stands out for its fabulous position
between the sea and Etna, the snow-capped volcano, and for its Greco-
Roman Theater — one of the greatest of antiquity. Rivaling Athens for
importance during antiquity, Syracuse knew a second period of glory
during the 17th and 18th centuries, which left their marks in the archae-
ological area and the baroque architectural jewel of Ortigia. Dominating
the southern shore, Agrigento was another important Greek city, one 
of the most beautiful of the ancient world, graced by one of the most
imposing complexes of temples, which has partly survived to this day.
If you have the time, you could spend a night in each of these destina-
tions; otherwise, either Taormina and Palermo (see Chapter 21) makes
an excellent base for visiting the rest of the island.
Taormina
On Sicily’s eastern shore, south of Messina, Taormina was built on a
breathtakingly beautiful site, overlooking the sea with nearby volcano
Mount Etna smoldering in the background. A small town of about 10,000
residents, Taormina receives some 900,000 visitors per year — that’s
about 2,500 visitors a day — counting only those who stay overnight;
many others just pass through for the day. You may find it odd that this
was a haunt of Greta Garbo, who “wanted to be alone,” but crowded as it
may be, Taormina’s unique charm remains untouched, especially in the
off season.

Chapter 22: Taormina, Syracuse, and Agrigento 479

Taormina makes an excellent base for visiting the rest of the region; many
travel agencies based here offer guided tours to other destinations in
Sicily (see “Exploring Taormina,” later in this section).
Getting there
Taormina is 50km (30 miles) north of Catania (see later in this chapter)
and 250km (150 miles) east of Palermo (see Chapter 21). Catania, a
major harbor town on Sicily’s eastern shore, is the most logical point of
arrival, as it’s linked to the mainland and other destinations in Europe
and the Mediterranean by air and water.
Flights from most major destinations in Italy and Europe arrive at
Catania’s Aeroporto Fontanarossa (% 800-605656 in Italy; www.
aeroporto.catania.it), only 4km (21⁄2 miles) south of Catania town.
Efficient and compact, the airport is well organized with a bank with
ATM, a currency-exchange booth, and a tourist information desk in the
arrivals concourse. Public transportation is right outside: You’ll find the
electric shuttle Alibus (% 800-018696), which runs to the center of
Catania every 20 minutes from 5 a.m. to midnight, and the bus operated
by Etna Trasporti (% 095-532716; www.etnatrasporti.it), which
serves Taormina, a 75-minute ride away.
By ferry, TTT Lines (% 800-915365 in Italy, or 081 5752192; www.ttt
lines.com) offers daily overnight service from Molo Angioino in Naples
to Catania’s harbor for 50€ to 150€ ($60–$180) per person. You can then
take the easy 50-minute train ride from Catania rail station to Taormina.
Taormina is well linked by train service with the rest of Sicily and Italy
(% 892021; www.trenitalia.it). The train station (Via Nazionale; 
% 0942-51026 or 0942-51511) is located a little down the hill, below
Taormina’s center, in Villagonia. From the station, you can take a taxi
(% 0942-51150 or 0942-23800) or the electric shuttle.
If you’re getting here by car, Taormina lies off the autostrada A18 from
Catania to Messina. From Palermo, you’ll have to take A19 to Catania,
where you’ll pick up A18. Taormina’s center is pedestrian-only, so you’ll
have to leave your car at the entrance of town. The best place to park
your car is just after the highway exit for Taormina, at Parcheggio
Lumbi (% 0942-23605), at the base of the hill; the cost is about 8€
($9.60) for half a day and 13€ ($16) for 24 hours. A shuttle bus runs from
the parking lot to town every few minutes. If you’re spending the night,
ask if your hotel has parking.
Spending the night
Taormina is a prime tourist destination in Italy, and the hotel standards
are high here: You’ll find accommodations for every budget and taste.
The two luxury resorts in town — Grand Hotel Timeo (Via del Teatro
Greco 59, by the Greek theater; % 0942-23801; www.framon-hotels.
com; Rack rates: 490€/$588 double) and San Domenico Palace (Piazza
Part VII: Sicily 
480

San Domenico 5, south of the Duomo; % 0942-613111; www.san
domenico.thi.it; Rack rates: 450€/$540 double) — the first and
second hotels, respectively, to open in town back in the 19th century —
are beautiful and will make for the perfect vacation, but you can also do
very well in the more moderately priced accommodations.
Villa Diodoro

Centro
This elegant hotel is set in an attractive villa near the center of town, sur-
rounded by its own garden. Guest rooms are spacious and tastefully dec-
orated with fine fabrics and period furniture, including wrought-iron beds
and Oriental carpets. Most of the rooms feature private terraces and gor-
geous ocean views. Amenities include a swimming pool, a solarium, a bar,
and a restaurant; in high season, a shuttle bus gets you to the Lido
Caparena beach nearby.

Villa Ducale
$$$
Centro
Housed in a beautifully restored villa from the early 1900s, this small hotel
offers splendid accommodations. From its unique position on the cliff, a
ten-minute uphill walk from the center of town, it affords quiet and unique
views. Guest rooms are full of charm, each with its own veranda opening
onto a sea view. They’re individually decorated in Sicilian style — terra-
cotta floors, wrought-iron beds, whitewashed or pastel walls — with com-
pact but pleasant tiled bathrooms. In high season, a shuttle bus takes
guests to the beach.

include buffet breakfast. AE, MC, V.
Villa Fabbiano
$$$
Centro
Set in a former private villa built to resemble a castle, this family-run hotel
offers welcoming accommodations, friendly staff, and a quiet and roman-
tic location. Guest rooms are spacious and bright, individually decorated
with comfortable quality furnishings. The good-sized tiled bathrooms have
all the comforts. The hotel’s roof garden and the outdoor swimming pool,
along with the large suites with private terraces, are a real plus for families
with children. There’s also an excellent restaurant here.

Dining locally
You will find plenty of restaurants in this lively resort, catering to a vari-
ety of tastes; they are particularly easy to spot during the warm season,
when tables overflow on small outdoor terraces and sidewalks. Many
hotels also have excellent restaurants open to the public, such as the
superb Bougainvillées inside the San Domenico Palace (see “Spending
the Night,” earlier in this chapter), serving regional specialties on its ter-
race with a breathtaking view of Mount Etna.

you can enjoy on the terrace with a view or inside the very pleasantly
appointed dining room — or you can reserve a romantic table for two on
the private balcony in summer. Excellent choices include the tonno 
sott’olio fatto in casa (home-preserved tuna in olive oil), zuppa di ceci
(chickpea soup), pasta ca’ nocca (pasta with anchovies, fried bread
crumbs, and wild fennel), braciole di pesce spada alla messinese (swordfish
steaks, Messina style), and agnello “ngrassatu” (roasted lamb chops).
There is also a good selection of vegetarian dishes and great traditional
desserts such as cassata (a ricotta, almond paste, and candied-fruit prepa-
ration) and cannoli di ricotta.

A contended place
In the fifth century B.C. Greek colonists founded Naxos (today the seaside resort of
Giardini Naxos), on the shore below Mount Taurus — the mountain giving its name to
Taormina — but the town was completely destroyed by the ruler of competing city-
state Syracuse, Dionysius I. In 358 B.C., Andromachus decided to rebuild over the dra-
matic cliff overlooking the sea, and thus founded Taormina at its present location. The
residents had thought it prudent to move to the top of the cliffs, but that didn’t save
them from further invasions. They certainly had a keen eye for the most picturesque
location, though, and had become able politicians: The Greek city-state backed the
Romans in the Punic Wars, who in return protected them from Syracuse. This resulted
in a glorious period that stretched from the third century B.C. to the end of the Roman
Empire; during this time, Taormina thrived and received the coveted status of Roman
colony under Augustus. After the empire ended, the city of Taormina lost its protection:
It was twice laid waste by the Arabs, until Roger II took over the city in 1078 for the
Normans. After the Middle Ages, Taormina slowly sank into obscurity for several hun-
dred years. It remained a forgotten medieval village until the end of the 18th century,
when European artists, such as the German writer Goethe, began to celebrate it as
the “ideal vista.” Taormina’s unique panorama, with the sea on one side and snow-
capped Etna on the other, started attracting visitors from all over the world. Taormina
became the place to be, appealing to the wealthy and glamorous until this day.

as well as to the top attractions on rest of the island, including Palermo
(see Chapter 21), Syracuse, Agrigento, and Piazza Armerina (see later in
this chapter). SAT Sicilian Airbus Travel (Corso Umberto 73; % 0942-
24653; www.sat-group.it) offers a similar array of tours, including a
nice bus-and-jeep sunset tour of Mount Etna, which we particularly 
recommend. CST (Corso Umberto 101; % 0942-626088; www.compagnia
sicilianaturismo.it) organizes guided tours to all major sights in
Sicily, departing from both Taormina and Catania. Expect to pay between
35€ and 60€ ($42–$72) per person for a half- or full-day tour.
The top attractions
The medieval center of town is best enjoyed early in the morning or in
the off season, when its streets are less crowded and noisy with happy
visitors. If you feel overwhelmed by the hordes, just step into the side
streets, lined with many magnificent villas owned by famous residents
past and present.
Archaeological Museum
Opened in 2002, this museum is housed in the elegant Palazzo della Badia
Vecchia — a beautiful example of Sicilian Gothic — and holds an important
collection of artifacts from 19th-century excavations in Taormina and the
nearby areas. Among its best pieces is the statue of a priestess to the cult
of Isis from the second century A.D., found in the excavations of the church
of San Pancrazio, where there was a Hellenistic temple.
See map p. 479. Via Circonvallazione 30. % 0942-620112. Admission: 2.50€ ($3). Open:
Daily 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 4–8 p.m.
Corso Umberto I
Taormina’s central street stretches between Porta Catania and Porta
Messina; these were the town’s gates in Greek and Roman times. In
medieval times, the town shrunk so much that they built another gate —
the Torre dell’Orologio (Clock Tower), also appropriately called Porta di
Mezzo (Middle Gate) — and abandoned Porta Messina. During the
Renaissance, the town began expanding again, but it reoccupied the whole
hourglass-shaped area of the Greek city only in modern times. The clock
tower of the middle gate was rebuilt and attached to the Chiesa di San
Giorgio in the 17th century, in a baroque remake.
Along Corso Umberto I are some of Taormina’s most interesting monu-
ments, such as the Palazzo dei Duchi di Santo Stefano, the best preserved
of the town’s Norman buildings, and the Chiesa di Sant’Agostino, a 16th-
century church opening onto a nice square, Largo IX Aprile, above the
sea (the church is closed to worship and used as the town library).
Opening onto Piazza Santa Caterina is Palazzo Corvaja, one of the most
interesting in town. Built between the 12th and 15th centuries around a
preexisting Arab cubic tower — probably part of a fortress — in several
additions, it has a crenellated structure and beautiful entrance staircase
from the 12th century, plus a 15th-century wing (to the right) where the
Sicilian Parliament met. Today, it houses the Ethno-Anthropological

1 p.m. and 4–8 p.m.) and the tourist office (see “Information” under “Fast
Facts: Taormina,” later in this chapter).
Duomo
Built in the 12th century according to a Latin cross plan and dedicated to
St. Nicola, this church was later remodeled — the central portal dates to
1633, while the lateral portals date to the 15th and 16th centuries, respec-
tively. Inside, the nave is defined by gracious monolithic pink-marble
columns topped by capitals decorated with a fish-scale pattern, recalling
Sicily’s maritime tradition. In front of the Duomo is the beautiful baroque
Fontana Monumentale, built in 1635 with two-legged female centaurs.
See map p. 479. Piazza del Duomo, just off Corso Umberto. % 0942-23123. Admission:
Free. Open: Daily for mass, usually early morning and early evening.
Greek-Roman Theater
Seating a capacity of 5,000 people, this theater carved out of rock is second
in Sicily only to Syracuse’s (see later in this chapter) in both size and
importance. It’s the best preserved of all Greek and Roman theaters in
Italy. Unusual for a Greek theater, the backdrop scene was a fixed struc-
ture: It represented a two-story house, part of which is still visible.
Following the destiny of so many buildings of antiquity, part of the the-
ater’s materials were taken to construct other buildings, in this case by
the Arabs and Normans, leaving modern-day visitors to imagine what it
once looked like. During its glory days, the walls of the theater (only a por-
tion in the back remains) were covered with marble and decorated with
frescoes. Although the theater was Greek in origin, the Romans modified
it for gladiator battles. A tunnel connected the cellar of the Roman arena
with the outside; the orchestra of the theater was enlarged and closed off
by a high podium in order to protect spectators. Today, the theater is
famous for the performances held during the Taormina Arte (Via
Pirandello 31; % 0942-21142; Fax: 0942-23348), a summertime festival of
cinema, theater, music, ballet, and video started in 1983.

Daily Apr–Sept 9 a.m.–7 p.m.; Oct–Mar 9 a.m.–4 p.m.
Public Gardens
These gardens were built by Miss Florence Trevelyan, who arrived in 1882,
fell in love with the town, and bought a piece of land sloping toward the
sea. She worked at transforming the land, training and employing local
workers as gardeners. Within the gardens, she designed and built the
Victorian Follies — bizarre toy houses built with red bricks and light-
colored stone containing inlaid archaeological materials. Taorminians
were fond of her, and when she died in 1902, they showered flowers upon
her funeral procession. Her will forbade her heirs from ever building on
or industrially cultivating the land.

Daily sunrise–sunset.

More cool things to see and do
 By the sea below Taormina lies the small seaside resort of Mazzarò,
with its beautiful beaches and seafood restaurants. This is what
most visitors to Taormina come for: to enjoy the beautiful sea. To 
the right of Mazzarò, at the center of a picturesque bay, is the Isola
Bella, a protected nature refuge with its marine grottoes: Some
people swim to it from the beach, but it’s also great fun to hire a boat
from Mazzarò and circle around the point to the bay. The best way to
get down to the beach is via the funivia (cable car; % 0942-23605)
from Via Pirandello, in the center of Taormina. It runs every 15 min-
utes all day long (until 3 a.m. in summer); tickets are 3€ ($3.60)
round-trip and 1.80€ ($2.15) one-way.
 We love taking a day trip to the great volcano Etna, which dominates
the area around Taormina. Europe’s biggest and most active volcano
(the last eruptions were in 2001 and 2003), it is 3,300m (10,824 ft.) tall
and still growing. Famous for its mega-eruptions — which ceased
centuries ago — Etna’s littlest grumbles and oozings can still wipe
out vast areas and human settlements. The 1669 eruption not only
took out chunks of the not-so-close-by town of Catania (amazingly,
the deposits by the side of the highway south of town look as if they
were made yesterday), but also extended the coastline about a kilo-
meter (more than half a mile) into the sea. Etna isn’t all lava and
debris; parts of its north slopes are covered with a soaring conifer
forest that took root in the rich soil. The easiest way to visit is via
organized tour from Taormina (see earlier in this section); if you
have a car, follow the signs for Linguaglossa and then Zafferana,
where you take the small winding road to the Rifugio Sapienza. The
cable car to the summit starts from Rifugio. If you want to see the
craters up close and personal, you’ll need an authorized guide: Book
one at Guide Alpine Etna Sud (% 095-7914755), which will take you
close enough to see the craters from a safe distance.

Piazza Armerina and its 
glorious Roman villa
Inland from Taormina and Catania, and east of Palermo, lies a unique archaeological
finding: Villa del Casale (% 0935-680036; www.piazza-armerina.it). This well-
preserved ancient Roman rural villa — it was once a wealthy hunting lodge — hides
a treasure trove of mosaics. The roofs and walls have collapsed, but since this villa
was abandoned before the Middle Ages, it has come to us basically unchanged since
Roman times. Its splendid mosaic floors are untouched, making for a unique experi-
ence. The visit takes about one hour and you can easily get here by organized tour
from either Taormina or Palermo. If you’re driving, take A19, exit at ENNA, and follow
signs for PIAZZA ARMERINA; the archaeological area is just south of town near the ramps
to the highway. Admission is 4€ ($4.80); hours are daily from 8 a.m. to sunset.

Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.), a series of picturesque gorges,

at least a bathing suit, towel, and aqua shoes). You can get here by
guided tour (see earlier in this section), by car (off SS185, about
18km/11 miles from Taormina), or by bus from Taormina — Interbus

charges 5€ ($6) round-trip. From the parking lot, an elevator takes
you part of the way, and from May through September, you can
climb the rest of the way (partly walking in the frigid waters).
Fast Facts: Taormina

Syracuse
Close to Sicily’s southeastern tip, Syracuse is a beautiful stone city shim-
mering somewhat sleepily by the sea. Its attractions range from an
impressive Greek theater to the island of Ortigia, the town’s baroque his-
toric district. Staying overnight will allow you to see most of the local
attractions, including a short visit to nearby Noto.
Getting there
Syracuse is easily reached from Catania, only 63km (39 miles) to the
north (see the “Getting there” section in “Taormina,” earlier in this chap-
ter). From Catania’s airport and town, Interbus (% 0935-565111; www.

it also has frequent bus service from Palermo (a three-and-a-half-hour
ride). You can also take the train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) to
Syracuse’s train station (% 0931-69722), on the west side of town,

Catania
Almost unknown to foreign visitors, Catania is the second-largest town in Sicily after
Palermo. Centered around an important harbor, it hides a baroque heart that rewards
those who brave its belt of industrial — and quite ugly — developments.
The historic district is an apotheosis of baroque buildings, as the town was completely
rebuilt after the earthquake of 1693. The most famous attraction in town is the Duomo
(Piazza Duomo; % 095-320044; Admission: Free; Open: Daily 7 a.m. to noon and 4:30–
7 p.m.), Catania’s cathedral. Named for St. Agata, it is richly decorated with paintings
and carvings. From Piazza Duomo and crossing the heart of the historic district, Via
Etnea is lined with ornate buildings; follow it down to the Giardini Bellini (Piazza
Roma), the beautiful public gardens named after the local opera composer Vincenzo
Bellini (composer of Norma, among others) — a destination favored by locals, and
one of the nicest gardens in Europe. Also worth a visit are the Greek theater and the
Roman ruins, including the thermal baths and the forum.
You can eat very well at Ambasciata del Mare (Piazza Duomo 6; % 095-341003;
www.ambasciatadelmare.com; Open: Tues–Sun 12:30–3 p.m. and 7:30–11 p.m.),
and even better at the Osteria I tre Bicchieri (Via San Giuseppe al Duomo 31; 
% 095-7153540; www.osteriaitrebicchieri.it; Open: Mon–Sat 7:30–11 p.m.),
both conveniently located near the beautiful Duomo. If you’re planning to stay
overnight, the Excelsior Grand Hotel (Piazza Giovanni Verga; % 095-7476111; www.
thi.it) is the best in town, followed by the Katane Palace (Via Camillo Finocchiaro
Aprile 110; % 095-7470702; www.katanepalace.it) with its excellent restaurant
Il Cuciniere, one of the best on the island.
You’ll find tourist information offices at the train station, the airport, and Via Etnea 63,
in the center of town (% 095-7306233; www.apt.catania.it).

about a 20-minute walk from either Ortigia or the Archaeological Zone;
you’ll find local buses and taxis outside. For radio-taxi pickup, call 
% 0931-69722.
If you’re coming by car, beware of the dangerous 21km (13-mile) stretch
on SS114 (also labeled E14 on European maps) between Catania and
Syracuse, where the road reduces to two lanes. Much too narrow for the
amount of traffic on it, locals speeding and passing each other turn it
into a hair-raising, and potentially deadly, experience. State road SS115
from Agrigento is picturesque, but a long haul.

Museo Archeologico Regionale Paolo Orsi
This is the best archaeological museum in Sicily. Every time period is rep-
resented in the large, well-organized collection, from prehistoric objects to
an extensive Hellenistic collection from Syracuse’s heyday. The single most
famous piece is the second-century-B.C. Venus Anadyomene, which —
though headless — powerfully evokes the birth of the goddess from the
sea. The pre-Greek vases are lovely, too.

Ortigia
Today connected to the mainland by a bridge — Ponte Nuovo — this
island in the heart of Syracuse’s harbor is where the city began back in the
eighth century B.C. With its Greek ruins and baroque palazzi, it is the heart
of the historic district. Actually, one could say that it is the historic dis-
trict, since, until the end of the 19th century, Ortigia was still all there was
of Syracuse; the mainland area contained only the rail station and the
Greek ruins.
Chapter 22: Taormina, Syracuse, and Agrigento 491
Siracusa
When the Corinthians founded Syracuse in the eighth century B.C., they established
their first settlement by the island of Ortigia, home to the mythical nymph Calypso, who
kept Odysseus captive for seven years. The city-state flourished around its beautiful
harbor, perfectly positioned for trade. It rapidly gained increasing control over the
eastern and western Mediterranean, to the point of rivaling the great cities of the
mother country, and particularly Athens. Syracuse rose to become the
Mediterranean’s greatest power under its forceful tyrants (particularly Dionysius I).
However, during the Punic Wars, Syracuse was caught between a rock and a hard
place — the Romans and the Carthaginians. The Roman siege lasted two years, and
in 215 B.C. they finally overwhelmed Syracuse, despite the clever devices that
Archimedes, the city’s most famous son, constructed to thwart them and their siege
engines. Archimedes died in the Roman siege, and Syracuse wound up on the losing
side. It lost all its importance at that point and never recovered.

As you cross the Ponte Nuovo, you will first see the remains of the Temple
of Apollo, built in the sixth century B.C., reduced now to just a few
columns. Walk up Via Savoia to Porta Marina (Seaside Gate) and enter the
old town. If you proceed along the stone border of the harbor, you’ll find
the romantic Fonte Aretusa: This — according to the myth — is the very
spring into which the nymph Arethusa was turned in order to escape the
fiery advances of Alfeo, the marine god who was trying to seduce her. He
then turned into a river so their waters could mingle together. Famous
since antiquity for its almost magical qualities, this spring — separated
from the sea only by a stone wall — is rich in freshwater fish.
Head back to the center of Ortigia to admire the seventh-century Duomo
(Piazza del Duomo; % 0931-65328; Admission: Free; Open: Daily 8 a.m. to
noon and 4–7 p.m.), built on the remains of the Greek temple to Athena
(Minerva to the Romans). You can still see 12 of the temple’s columns
incorporated into the church structure. Farther to the southeast, you’ll
find beautiful Piazza Archimede, the heart of Ortigia, graced by a stately
baroque fountain. Nearby is the splendid Palazzo Bellomo, which houses
the Galleria Regionale (Via Capodieci 16; % 0931-69511; Admission:
3€/$3.60; Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m., Sun 9 a.m.–12:30 p.m.). Built in
the 13th century and remodeled in the 15th, this elegant palazzo holds a
large collection of Sicilian figurative art stretching from the Byzantine
period to the 18th century. The most important piece is Antonello da
Messina’s famous Annunciation. (Note that the palazzo was still closed
for restoration at press time, but is scheduled to reopen imminently.) At
the tip of the island is the Castello Maniace (% 0931-464420; Admission:

Parco Archeologico della Neopolis (Archaeological Area)
On the western edge of modern Syracuse lies the Neopolis (“new town” in
Greek, as opposed to the old settlement of Ortigia). Created at the height
of Syracuse’s glory, it was practically abandoned during the town’s decline
in Roman times; thus its ruins are well preserved. The archaeological area
is large, encompassing two theaters and the quarries from which stone
was excavated to build all the monuments in the old town.
Beware of the sun in the hot months — walking around the ruins at high
noon can quickly exhaust and dehydrate you. Bring water, wear a hat, and
put on your most comfortable shoes.
The star of the park is the Greek Theater, dating back to the fifth century
B.C. Carved out of the hillside, it is very well preserved and a magical place
to attend a show. Indeed, thanks to the Italian Institute of Ancient Drama
(INDA, Corso G. Matteotti 29; % 800-907080 in Italy, or 0931-67415; www.
indafondazione.org), this theater comes to life again in even-numbered
years, when classical plays by Aeschylus, Euripides, and other Greek play-
wrights are staged as they were 2,500 years ago. The season usually runs
from May to June, and tickets cost about 30€ ($36). In odd-numbered
years, plays are presented at the theater of Segesta (see “Segesta and
Part VII: Sicily 
492

Selinunte” sidebar, later in this chapter). The tunnels you see in the stage
area aren’t original; they were dug later by the Romans so they could use
the theater for their blood sports.
On the other side of the hill, you can visit the Latomia del Paradiso, one
of the stone quarries that served the city. Once a huge grotto, its roof col-
lapsed in the 1693 earthquake, leaving a hole covering many acres and a
few stone pillars sticking up here and there. Some of the grottoes still exist,
including the Grotta dei Cordari, used in later centuries for ropemaking,
and the Orecchio di Dionisio (Dionysius’s Ear), a deep, very tall, pitch-
black cave with unique acoustics (try tearing up a piece of paper). The
story that the tyrant Dionysius used the cave to eavesdrop on conversa-
tions is a myth; the painter Caravaggio was said to have given the cave its
name (perhaps he made up the story, too).
Nearby is the Roman Amphitheater, built during the reign of Augustus
and partially carved from the rock. Like other Roman theaters, it was used
for life-and-death battles between humans and animals, and was some-
times flooded and filled with crocodiles and other friendly creatures for
water fights. What you see today is only the bottom story — try to imag-
ine how it looked when the top of the theater reached the present height
of the surrounding trees. Holy Roman Emperor Charles V is the bad guy of
many stories about Italy, and Syracuse is no exception. He did more

Segesta and Selinunte
Sicily is the land of Greek temples — if you’re into ancient ruins, you’ll be delighted by
the gorgeous sites of Segesta and Selinunte. Selinunte lies 122km (76 miles) south-
west of Palermo and 113km (70 miles) west of Agrigento. Once a prosperous Greek
colony established by Syracusans, it was destroyed by Hannibal in 409 B.C. The archae-
ological area (Admission: 4.50€/$5.40; Open: Daily 9 a.m.–sunset) feels like a dinosaur
cemetery, with the huge stone structures of the once splendid acropolis lying on the
ground, scattered here and there. Part of temple C was re-erected in 1925. The easi-
est way to visit is by guided tour from Palermo (see Chapter 21) or by car, but you 
can also get here by public transportation: Take a train (% 892021; www.
trenitalia.it) from Palermo to Castelvetrano, and then switch to a bus operated
by Autoservizi Salemi (% 0923-981120) to get to Selinunte.
The temple — yes, there’s only one — in Segesta is still standing, and it’s a unique
sight indeed. All alone in a field on a hill, it’s one of the best preserved Greek temples
in the world. The archaeological site (Admission: 4€/$4.80; Open: Daily 9 a.m.–7 p.m.;
last entrance one hour earlier) lies only 74km (46 miles) southwest of Palermo and is
easily reached by train (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) — the train station is
1km (2⁄3 mile) away — or by guided tour from Palermo (see Chapter 21). Up nearby
Mount Barbaro lies the ancient Greek theater, which comes alive in summer with
modern and classic plays. Bus service from Palermo is organized for these shows;
check with the tourist office for a schedule of events.

More cool things to see and do
 In summer, Syracuse is boiling hot. Head for the beach, like the
locals do. Arenella is the closest (only about 8km/5 miles south of
the historic district), but Fontane Bianche (19km/12 miles away in
the same direction) is the best. You can easily get there by public
transportation (bus no. 23 from Riva della Posta). If you’re driving,
take SS115 and follow the signs.
 The famous town of Noto, which is easy to reach via guided tour or
by bus — service is offered by Interbus (% 0935-565111 or 0931-
66710; www.interbus.it) — lies only 32km (20 miles) southwest
of Syracuse off autostrada A18, a 50-minute ride from the historic
district of Syracuse. A wonderful example of Sicilian baroque, the
town was reduced to rubble by the 1693 earthquake — the same
one that destroyed the whole southeast of Sicily — and the town’s
notables decided to rebuild a completely new town 16km (10 miles)
south of its original location. The reconstruction happened very
rapidly — in about 45 years — and the result was a town remark-
ably uniform in style, a real rarity in Italy where you can usually see
the layers of history. Faithful to pure baroque standards, Noto was
built on a regular street grid; many important Sicilian artists con-
tributed to the reconstruction, and the whole town is considered a
work of art. Carvings of grotesque animals and figures support the
balconies, and all the buildings were constructed of a golden-yellow
stone. Noto underwent a restoration that started in 1997, leaving it
more beautiful than ever. The tourist office, where you can also get
a map of the town, is in the center at Piazza XIV Maggio (% 0931-
573779; Open: Summer daily 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3:30–6:30 p.m.,

Chapter 22: Taormina, Syracuse, and Agrigento 495
Agrigento and the Valley of the Temples
Dominating the southern shore, Agrigento was another important Greek
city-state, and one of the most beautiful of the ancient world. Founded 
in 581 B.C., it was deeply admired by the Greek poet Pindar. Agrigento
reached great heights in art and culture in the third century B.C., but 
saw its fortunes wax and wane with those of the Roman Empire. Its
Valley of the Temples is one of the most dramatic classical sites in the
Mediterranean: A high plateau overlooking the sea holds the most
impressive Greek ruins in existence outside Greece, and is reason
enough to come to Sicily. Farther up the hill from the ruins stands
modern Agrigento, a small town that most visitors bypass.
Getting there
Several companies in both Taormina and Palermo offer tours (see
Chapter 21 and earlier in this chapter), but you can easily get to
Agrigento on your own. Trains (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it) arrive
at Agrigento rail station, on Piazza Guglielmo Marconi (% 0922-725669);
the trip from Palermo takes one and a half hours and costs about 7€
($8.40). You can also take a bus: AST (% 800-234163 in Italy, or 091-
6882906) and Omnia (% 0922-596490) serve Agrigento from Palermo
town, whereas Licata (% 0922-401360) connects Agrigento with
Palermo’s airport, Falcone Borsellino/Punta Raisi. If you’re coming by
car, Agrigento lies 126km (79 miles) south of Palermo. You can take the
shorter but narrower SS121/189 connecting Palermo to Agrigento, or the
A19 autostrada connecting Palermo to Caltanissetta (and then follow the
directions to Agrigento and take SS640 for the remaining 60km/37 miles).
The Valley of the Temples is 3km (2 miles) south of Agrigento; a shuttle-
bus service connects the archaeological area with the train station in
Agrigento, or you can take a taxi (see “Fast Facts: Agrigento,” later in
this chapter).

The top attractions
Valley of the Temples
The archaeological area is vast and has very few trees. Bring comfortable
shoes and, if you’re visiting in high season, a hat, sunscreen, and at least
a quart of water per person. Packing a picnic lunch to enjoy by the ruins
is also a good idea if your time is limited. The valley is at its most dramatic
at sunrise or sunset (when the temperature is also cooler). You will need
two to three hours for your visit.
Entering the archaeological area from the Porta Aurea (a gate in the Greek
walls), you’ll find the three best-preserved temples — Hercules, Concord,
and Juno — to your right, while the Temple of Jupiter and the Temple of
Castor and Pollux are by the river on your left.
You’ll have to use your imagination to fully appreciate the massive Temple
of Jupiter, built to celebrate the gratitude of the people of Agrigento for
their 480-to-479 B.C. victory over the Carthaginians at Himera. One of 
the largest temples of antiquity, it covered approximately 6,317 sq. m
Chapter 22: Taormina, Syracuse, and Agrigento 497
The Greek temple
The Greek temple was conceived as the habitation of a god and always opened to the
east because the god’s statue had to face the rising sun (symbol of the beginning of
light and life) and never the sunset (symbol of the night and death). Over a high rec-
tangular platform with steps, the classic temple has a perimeter of columns and an
inside wall enclosing three rooms: the pronaos (entrance), the naos (the cell with the
statue of the god), and the opistodomos (where the treasure, the votive gifts, and the
archives of the temple were kept). In fact, temples were so sacred that citizens used
to leave their valuables there, thus using them as safes.

(68,000 sq. ft.) and was 32m (108 ft.) tall. Each of the columns rose 26m 
(55 ft.) and measured 4.1m (14 ft.) at the base; probably alternated with
the columns were the Telamons (or Atlases, human figures supporting a
structure). Each of these giants measured 7.5m (25 ft.) high, as you can
see from the whole one lying flat on the ground; a better preserved one is
in the Regional Museum (see later in this section). Little remains also of the
Temple of Castor and Pollux, built between 480 and 460 B.C. to honor the
twin sons of Jupiter and Leda (queen of Sparta), protectors of athletes,
hospitality, and sailors in difficulty. Of the 34 columns, only 4 remain stand-
ing (at the corner of the temple); these were restored in the 19th century.
Nearby are the few remains of the Tempio di Vulcano.
The temples on the other side of the entrance are much better preserved
and remain an impressive sight. The Temple of Hercules is one of the most
beautiful and the largest of the temples on this side: It occupied an area of
about 2,043 sq. m (22,000 sq. ft.). Hercules was highly revered in Sicily and
particularly in Agrigento; the god of strength, he was thought to free
people from nightmares and unwanted erotic stimuli. Nine columns are

still standing, thanks to the generosity of the English Captain Hardcastle,
who paid for their restoration in the 1920s. The temple was richly deco-
rated with reliefs and sculptures; the columns were painted white to sim-
ulate marble, whereas the cornice was decorated in red, blue, and
turquoise. The Temple of Concord, built around 430 B.C., is remarkably
well preserved. Transformed into a church as far back as A.D. 597, 12
arches were opened in the walls of the temple, while the space between
the columns was walled in to make it into a church with three naves. These
alterations were reversed in 1743, when the temple was declared a national
monument and restored. It’s one of the best-preserved temples of this
period, along with the one of Hera in Paestum (see Chapter 20) and the
Theseion in Athens. The Temple of Juno is also well preserved. Built in
450 to 440 B.C. in honor of Juno (Hera) — the mother goddess and protec-
tress of marriage and fertility — it has 34 columns and a maximum height
of 15m (50 ft.). It rises on a pretty hill, near one of the few trees on this side
of the archaeological area.

useful to you and help you have the splendid vacation you
deserve.
Think you can’t possibly make do in Italy knowing only ten
Italian words? Believe it or not, you can — and in Chapter 23,
we give you ten key words to help you converse with the

perhaps the greatest ones of all, and certainly some whose
work you will encounter over and over during your visit.

Need to Know

raveling in a country where you don’t know the language can be
intimidating, but trying to speak the language can be amusing, at 
the very least. Local people often appreciate it if you at least make the
effort. And you’ll find that Italian is a fun language to try to speak. If
you’re ready for more, check out Appendix B for a glossary of architec-
tural and menu terms.
Per Favore
Meaning “please,” per favore (pehr fah-voh-reh) is the most important
expression you can know. With it, you can make useful phrases such 
as “Un caffè, per favore” (“A coffee, please”) and “Il conto, per favore”
(“The bill, please”). There’s no need for verbs, and it’s perfectly polite!
Grazie
Grazie (grah-tsee-eh) means “thank you”; if you want to go all out, use
grazie mille (mee-leh), meaning “a thousand thanks.” Say it clearly and
loudly enough to be heard. Saying grazie is always right and puts people
in a good mood. Grazie has other uses as well: Italians often use it as a
way to say goodbye or mark the end of an interaction. It’s particularly
useful when you don’t want to buy something from an insistent street
vendor: Say “Grazie,” and walk away.

Permesso
Meaning “excuse me” (to request passage or admittance), permesso
(pehr-mehs-soh) is of fundamental importance on public transportation.
When you’re in a crowded bus and need to get off, say loudly and clearly,
“Permesso!” and people will clear from your path (or feel less irritated as
you squeeze your way through). The same thing applies in supermarkets,
trains, museums, and so on. Of course, you may be surrounded by non-
Italians, so the effect may be a little lost on them.
Scusi
Scusi (scoo-zee) means “excuse me” (to say you’re sorry after bumping
into someone) and is more exactly mi scusi, but the shortened form is
the one most people use. Again, it’s a most useful word in any crowded
situation. You’ll note that Italians push their way through a narrow pas-
sage with a long chain of “Scusi, permesso, mi scusi, grazie, permesso . . .”
It’s very funny to hear. Scusi has another important use: It’s the proper
way to attract somebody’s attention before asking a question. Say
“Scusi?” and the person will turn toward you in benevolent expectation.
Then it’s up to you.
Buon Giorno and Buona Sera
Buon giorno (bwon djor-no), meaning “good day,” and its sibling buona
sera (bwon-a sey-rah), meaning “good evening,” are of the utmost impor-
tance in Italian interactions. Italians always salute one another when
entering or leaving a public place. Do the same, saying it clearly when
entering a store or restaurant. Occasionally, these words can also be
used as forms of goodbye.
Arrivederci
Arrivederci (ah-ree-vey-der-chee) is the appropriate way to say goodbye
in a formal occasion — in a shop, at a bar or restaurant, or to friends. If
you can say it properly, people will like it very much: Italians are aware
of the difficulties their language poses for foreigners.
You’ll hear the word ciao (chow), the familiar word for goodbye, used
among friends (usually of the same age). Note that using the word ciao
with someone you don’t know is considered quite impolite!

504

Dov’è
Meaning “where is,” dov’è (doe-vay) is useful for asking for directions.
Because the verb is included, you just need to add the thing you’re look-
ing for: “Dov’è il Colosseo?” (“Where is the Colosseum?”) or “Dov’è la
stazione?” (“Where is the train station?”).
Quanto Costa?
Meaning “How much does it cost?”, Quanto costa? (quahn-to koss-tah) is
of obvious use all around Italy, for buying anything from a train ticket to
a Murano glass chandelier.
Che Cos’è?
Meaning “What is it?”, Che cos’è? (kay koss-ay) will help you buy things,
particularly food, and know what you’re buying. But it could also be
useful in museums and other circumstances. But then the tricky part
begins: understanding the answer. If you don’t understand the answer,
you can get the person to repeat it by saying the next phrase on our list:
Non Capisco
Non capisco (nohn kah-pees-koh) means “I don’t understand.” There’s no
need to explain this one: Keep repeating it and Italians will try more and
more imaginative ways to explain things to you.

Ten Great Italian Artists
In This Chapter
 Knowing who’s who
 Charting the careers of the masters
 Getting background on what you’ll be seeing
A
dmittedly, hundreds of books have been written about the great 
figures of Italian art, so any choice of ten figures is apt to be per-
sonal. However, some artists would be on everybody’s list: Leonardo,
Michelangelo, Raffaelo . . . This chapter is intended to give you some
background to attach to the names that you will encounter again and
again during your travels in Italy.
Giotto
Immortalized by Dante in the Divine Comedy, Giotto di Bondone (1266 or
1276–1337) was born in a village not far from Florence, and went on to
become an apprentice of the great painter Cimabue. He was famous in
his own time and in later centuries came to be known as the father of
modern painting. A practitioner of the Gothic style, he departed from
the serene but flat and static mode of Byzantine painting and the somber,
otherworldly beauty of medieval art. In works such as his masterpiece,
the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua (see Chapter 17), he depicted human
beings with a passion and emotion not seen since classical times, and
paved the way for the Renaissance in the following century.
Donatello
In a sense, Donatello (1386–1466) did for sculpture what Giotto did for
painting: pulled it out of the Middle Ages and gave it a new realism and
psychological accuracy. He developed a new technique, schiacciato, which
used flattened, shallow carving to make relief sculpture more pictorial 
and more like painting. Donatello executed works in marble, bronze, and
wood, and many of these pieces survive in his native Florence, where he
spent most of his long life. His crowning achievement is probably the
carvings for the sacristy in the Basilica di San Lorenzo; the Bargello

museum has two of his statues of David, one in bronze and the other in
marble (see Chapter 13).
Giovanni Bellini
Born to an artistic family (his father and brother were painters, and his
sister married Andrea Mantegna), Giovanni Bellini (1430–1516) began as
a painter of austere religious pictures in the late Gothic tradition. He
later developed one of the most recognizable styles and had a lasting
effect on Venetian painting. His masterpiece is reputed to have been the
large historical paintings he did for the hall of the Maggior Consiglio in
Venice, but these were destroyed by fire in 1577. However, his luminosity
and exquisite colors are fully on display in religious artworks (such as
his famous Madonnas) and other pieces preserved in the museums and
churches of Venice (see Chapter 16).
Leonardo da Vinci
Leonardo (1452–1519) grew up on his father’s estate in Vinci, a Tuscan
town under the rule of Florence. He was apprentice to the Florentine
painter Andrea del Verrocchio. Leonardo later left Florence for Milan,
where he spent 17 years. His genius for observation manifested itself in
portrayals of the human figure, such as the Mona Lisa, that were psycho-
logically real to the point of being uncanny, while also showing a revolu-
tionary sense of physicality, based on a profound grasp of anatomy. His
use of chiaroscuro (contrast between light and dark) influenced later
painters. Leonardo’s attention to nature led him to become a scientist,
engineer, and inventor as well. Leonardo’s life and work are perhaps the
most perfect expression of the spirit of the Renaissance. His Last Supper
in Milan (see Chapter 17), though much damaged, is a pilgrimage site for
art lovers.
Michelangelo
Michelangelo Buonarotti (1475–1564), like Leonardo, was a great painter
but many other things as well, including an architect; St. Peter’s in Rome
(see Chapter 12) received its final form and its dome from him. This
architectural masterpiece also contains his painterly masterpiece, the
frescoes of the Cappella Sistina (Sistine Chapel), and his sculptural
masterpiece, the Pietà. A tempestuous genius, Michelangelo was often
embroiled in conflict. His patrons included Lorenzo de’ Medici and Pope
Julius II. Julius’s successor, Leo X, was actually a son of Lorenzo and
longtime friend of Michelangelo, and he employed the artist in the
Medici Chapels in Florence (see Chapter 13). His use of color and monu-
mental modeling of the human form pointed ahead to the style known as
Mannerism.
Chapter 24: Ten Great Italian Artists 507

Raphael
In a short lifetime, Raffaelo Sanzio (1483–1520) left a profound mark on
European painting. He had already shown great talent as a draftsman
before he was out of his teens. After studying painting with Perugino and
other artists, he moved to Florence and fell under the spell of Leonardo
da Vinci. But Raffaelo’s figures have a radiant, peaceful composure that
is all his own; his images have often been described as “sublime.” Some
of his finest work is in the rooms he frescoed at the Vatican for Pope
Julius II (see Chapter 12). It is less well known that Raffaelo was very
interested in archaeology and was appointed commissioner of antiqui-
ties for the city of Rome. He died on his birthday at the age of 37; his
tomb is in the Pantheon.
Titian
Tiziano Vecellio (circa 1488–1576) moved to Venice with his brother at the
age of nine and was apprenticed to a mosaicist. He found his true calling,
however, when he began to study under the greatest Venetian painter of
the time, Giovanni Bellini. Titian became famous for his depictions of
mythological and idyllic scenes, powerful and revealing portraits (like the
one of Pope Paul III and family in the Capodimonte museum in Naples —
see Chapter 18), and stunning religious works such as the revolutionary
Assumption in the Frari church in Venice (see Chapter 16), a truly glorious
painting.
Tintoretto
Jacopo Robusti (1518–94) was nicknamed “tintoretto” (“little dyer”)
because his father was a silk dyer. His unmistakable mature style involved
dynamic, loose brushwork and a palette that could almost be described
as moody. He was a colossal talent, the leading Mannerist painter of the
time, and his presence is felt everywhere in Venice, particularly in Scuola
Grande di San Rocco, which he literally filled with large canvasses (see
Chapter 16). Inspired by Michelangelo and Titian, Tintoretto was none-
theless a unique and startlingly original painter, whose work is above all
passionate.
Gian Lorenzo Bernini
If anyone personifies the baroque period, it is Bernini (1598–1680).
Although born in Naples, he did his major work in Rome, where one can
hardly turn around without stumbling on one of his masterworks. He
developed a style that combined the psychological realism of earlier
Renaissance sculptors with heightened decoration. His baldaquin inside
St. Peter’s in Vatican City (see Chapter 12), a giant gilt-and-bronze
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
508

canopy over four stories tall, has been called the first baroque monu-
ment. His fountain in the Piazza Navona is one of the most beautiful 
in Rome, while the Galleria Borghese contains several sculptures of
incredible mastery in which he made marble behave like flesh. Bernini
was so famous that when he visited the court of French king Louis XIV in
1665, crowds lined the streets to see him.
Caravaggio
One of the most beloved of Italian artists, Michelangelo Merisi da
Caravaggio (1572–1610) appeals to the modern imagination for his
romantic, tragic life as well as for his intense and unique art. He was con-
sidered a wild spirit by his contemporaries, and he befriended both
prostitutes (some of whom were his models) and criminals. However, he
was also protected and encouraged by cardinal Francesco del Monte.
His religious paintings were often rejected for their emotional intensity
and overpowering sensual impact (many can be found in the churches of
Rome and in the Galleria Borghese — see Chapter 12). He fled Rome
after a killing, or duel, which remains shadowy; he died soon thereafter.
The lurid details of his life, however, are less important than his extraor-
dinary use of light and shade, brilliant depiction of bodies in motion,
and tremendous fusion of naturalistic art and spiritual faith.

ual destination chapters.
Language
Italians speak Italian, and although many
know a bit of English, it is not widely
understood. Luckily, you can survive with
very little knowledge of the Italian lan-
guage (see Chapter 23 for a few choice
terms), especially because Italians are
very friendly and ready to help foreigners
in difficulty. However, you’ll greatly
enhance your experience if you master
more than a dozen basic expressions. A
good place to start your studies is Italian
For Dummies (Wiley).
Liquor Laws
There are no liquor laws in Italy. That is,
anybody is free to drink, but drinking and
driving is forbidden, as is displaying
drunken behavior. The law against disturb-
ing the quiete pubblica (public quiet) is
strict, and getting drunk and loud in bars,
streets, and even private homes is not tol-
erated. You can buy alcohol in all super-
markets and grocery stores, open usually
from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4 to 7 p.m.
Maps
The free maps distributed at tourist infor-
mation desks are usually adequate. If you
want something more detailed, you can
buy maps at local newsstands, kiosks, and
tobacconists — they all carry a good
selection.
Police
Call % 113 from anywhere in Italy.
Post Office
Each town has at least one post office,
usually in the center. Mail in Italy used to
be notoriously unreliable, and many visi-
tors still prefer to use the Vatican post
office while they’re visiting St. Peter’s in
Rome (it’s the same price as Italian post
offices, but faster). But Italian mail has
gotten a lot better with the introduction of
Italy For Dummies, 4th Edition 
512

Posta Prioritaria (express/priority). A letter
to the U.S. costs 0.80€ (96¢) and can take
as little as four to five days to get there.
Beware, though, that postcards are always
sent via the equivalent of U.S. third-class
mail and will take a long time to arrive; if
you want your postcard to arrive more
quickly, slip it into an envelope and send it
letter rate. Also, make sure you put your
mail in the right mailbox: The ones for
international mail are blue, whereas the
red ones are for national mail. The new pri-
ority mail also applies to packages; how-
ever, it is expensive and you may be better
off using a private carrier like UPS or DHL,
which will guarantee your delivery, espe-
cially for valuables.
Safety
Italy is very safe, but petty theft is common.
Pickpockets abound in tourist areas, on
public transportation, and in crowded
open-air markets. Purse-snatchers on
motor scooters are less common than they
used to be — Palermo is the only city
where they’re still prevalent. Avoid carrying
your bag on the street side of the sidewalk,
lest a thief zip by on a scooter. Instead,
keep your bag on the non-street side, or
between you and your companion. Observe
common big-city caution: Keep your valu-
ables in your hotel’s safe, don’t be dis-
tracted, watch your belongings, don’t count
your money in public, and avoid displaying
valuable jewelry and electronic equipment.
There are areas of poverty where a
wealthy-looking tourist with an expensive
camera may be mugged after dark, but
those are usually on the outskirts of cities.
(We indicate seedy areas, when applica-
ble, in individual destination chapters.)
If you’re a woman traveling alone in Italy —
especially if you’re young and fair-haired —
you will attract attention from young (and
sometimes not-so-young) Italian men.
They’ll give obvious and often vocal indica-
tion of their admiration; in fact, they may
approach you and try to charm you.
However, it’s unlikely that someone will
touch you, let alone harm you. Still, it’s a
good idea to ignore and not make eye con-
tact with anyone who approaches you, lest
you be thought promiscuous. The way you
dress will also have an effect: Italians have
a stricter dress code than Americans do,
and the farther south you go, the more tradi-
tional the society is. You’ll see a lot of
female skin displayed, but only when
women are accompanied by a man. If
you’re alone, you may want to cover up 
a bit.
Smoking
In 2005, Italy passed a law outlawing
smoking in most public places. Smoking is
allowed only where there is a separate,
ventilated area for nonsmokers. If you
want to smoke at your table, call before-
hand to make sure the restaurant or cafe
you’ll be visiting offers a smoking area.
Taxes
See Chapter 5 for information on IVA
(Value Added Tax).
Telephone
To call Italy from the U.S., dial the interna-
tional access code, 011; then Italy’s coun-
try code, 39; and then the area code
followed by the local telephone number.
Area codes for land lines in Italy can have
different numbers of digits — 06 for Rome,
055 for Florence, 0583 for Lucca, and so 
on — but always begin with 0; cellular
lines instead always have three-digit area
codes beginning with 3 (340, 338, and so on
depending on the company network). Toll-
free numbers have an 800 or 888 area code
(you’ll be tempted to add a 1, but it doesn’t
work). Some paying services use three-
digit codes beginning with 9. Also, some
Appendix A: Quick Concierge 513

companies have their own special num-
bers that don’t conform to any of the pre-
ceding standards and that are local calls
from anywhere in Italy, such as the rail-
road info line of Trenitalia (% 892021).
To make a call within Italy, always use the
area code — including 0 if any — for both
local and long distance. Public pay phones
in Italy take a carta telefonica (telephone
card), which you can buy at a tabacchi
(tobacconist, marked by a sign with a
white T on a black background), bar, or
newsstand. The cards can be purchased in
different denominations, from 2€ to 7.50€
($2.40–$9). Tear off the perforated corner,
stick the card in the phone, and you’re
good to go. A local call in Italy costs 
0.10€ (12¢).
To call abroad from Italy, dial the interna-
tional access code, 00; then the country
code of the country that you’re calling (1
for the United States and Canada, 44 for
the United Kingdom, 353 for Ireland, 61 for
Australia, 64 for New Zealand); and then
the local area code and phone number.
Make sure you have a high-value carta
telefonica before you start; your 5€ won’t
last long if you call San Diego at noon.
Lower rates apply after 11 p.m. and before
8 a.m. and on Sundays. The best option for
calling home, though, is using your own
calling card linked to your home phone.
Some calling cards offer a toll-free access
number in Italy; for those that don’t, you
must put in a carta telefonica to dial the
access number (you’re usually charged
only for a local call or not at all). Check
with your calling-card provider before
leaving on your trip. You can also make
collect calls: For AT&T, dial % 800-1724444
and then your U.S. phone number, area
code first; for MCI, dial % 800-905825; and
for Sprint, dial % 800-172405 or 800-
172406. To make a collect call to a country
other than the United States, dial % 170.
Directory assistance for calls within Italy is
free: Dial % 12. International directory
assistance is a toll call: Dial % 176.
Remember that calling from a hotel is con-
venient but usually expensive, as various
surcharges apply.
Time Zone
In terms of standard time zones, Italy is six
hours ahead of eastern standard time in
the United States: When it is 6 a.m. in New
York, it is noon in Italy. Daylight saving time
goes into effect in Italy each year from the
end of March to the end of September.
Tipping
Tipping is customary as a token of apprecia-
tion as well as a polite gesture on most
occasions. A 10 to 15 percent service
charge is usually included in your restau-
rant bill (check the menu when you order —
if the service is included, it will be marked
at the beginning or at the end as servizio
incluso), but it is customary to leave an
additional 5 to 10 percent if you appreciated
the meal. If the service is not included,
leave 15 to 25 percent. In bars, leave a 
5 percent tip at the counter and a 10 to 
15 percent tip if you sit at a table. Bellhops
who carry your bags will expect about 1€
($1.20) per bag, and you may want to leave 
a small tip for housekeeping in your hotel;
cabdrivers will expect 10 to 15 percent of
the fare.
Weather Updates
Before you go, you can check a Web 
site such as www.cnn.com or www.
weather.com. Once in Italy, your best
bet is to watch the news on TV (there’s no
number for weather forecasts, as there is
in the U.S.).
