The picture on the cover is a representation of the Smarandache near-ring (S-near-ring). The 
international near-ring community represents the near-ring by a structure which is nearly a ring, but 
not exactly a ring, i.e. a near-ring. For the S-near-ring, of course, we have a "S" within the near-ring 
structure!

PREFACE 
 
 
Near-rings are one of the generalized structures of rings. The study and research on 
near-rings is very systematic and continuous. Near-ring newsletters containing 
complete and updated bibliography on the subject are published periodically by a 
team of mathematicians (Editors: Yuen Fong, Alan Oswald, Gunter Pilz and K. C. 
Smith) with financial assistance from the National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. 
These newsletters give an overall picture of the research carried out and the recent 
advancements and new concepts in the field. Conferences devoted solely to near-rings 
are held once every two years. There are about half a dozen books on near-rings apart 
from the conference proceedings. Above all there is a online searchable database and 
bibliography on near-rings. As a result the author feels it is very essential to have a 
book on Smarandache near-rings where the Smarandache analogues of the near-ring 
concepts are developed. The reader is expected to have a good background both in 
algebra and in near-rings; for, several results are to be proved by the reader as an 
exercise. 
 
This book is organized into ten chapters: chapter one recalls some of the basic notions 
on groups, semigroups, groupoids semirings and lattices. The basic notions on near-
rings are dealt in chapter two. In chapter three several definitions from available 
researchers are restated with the main motivation of constructing their Smarandache 
analogues. The main concern of this book is the study of Smarandache analogue 
properties of near-rings and Smarandache near-rings; so it does not promise to cover 
all concepts or the proofs of all results. Chapter four introduces the concept of S-near-
rings and some of its basic properties. In chapter five all associative Smarandache 
near-rings built using group near-rings/semi near-rings and semigroup near-rings and 
semigroup seminear-rings are discussed. This alone has helped the author to build 
several new and innovative classes of near-rings and seminear-rings, both 
commutative and non-commutative, finite and infinite; using the vast classes of 
groups and semigroups. It has become important to mention here that the study of 
near-rings or seminear-rings using groups or semigroup is void except for a less than 
half a dozen papers. So when Smarandache notions are introduced the study in this 
direction would certainly be perused by innovative researchers/students.  
 
Chapter six introduces and studies the concepts about seminear-rings and 
Smarandache seminear-rings. It is worthwhile to mention here that even the study of 
seminear-rings seems to be very meagre. The two applications of seminear-rings in 
case of group automatons and Balanced Incomplete Block Designs (BIBD) are given 
in chapter seven and the corresponding applications of the Smarandache structures are 
introduced. One of the major contribution is that by defining Smarandache planar 
near-rings we see for a given S-planar near-ring we can have several BIBD's which is 
impossible in case of planar near-rings. So, the introduction of several BIBD's from a 
single S-planar near-ring will lead to several error-correcting codes. Codes using 
BIBD may be having common properties that will certainly be of immense use to a 
coding theorist.  
 

 
6 
The study of non-associative structures in algebraic structures has become a separate 
entity; for, in the case of groups, their corresponding non-associative structure i.e. 
loops is dealt with separately. Similarly there is vast amount of research on the non-
associative structures of semigroups i.e. groupoids and that of rings i.e. non-
associative rings. However it is unfortunate that we do not have a parallel notions or 
study of non-associative near-rings. The only known concept is loop near-rings where 
the additive group structures of a near-ring is replaced by a loop. Though this study 
was started in 1978, further development and research is very little. Further, this 
definition is not in similar lines with rings. So in chapter eight we have defined non-
associative near-rings and given methods of building non-associative near-rings and 
seminear-rings using loops and groupoids which we call as groupoid near-rings, near 
loop rings, groupoid seminear-rings and loop seminear-ring. For all these concepts a 
Smarandache analogue is defined and several Smarandache properties are introduced 
and studied. The ninth chapter deals with fuzzy concepts in near-rings and gives 5 
new unconventional class of fuzzy near-rings; we also define their Smarandache 
analogues. The final chapter gives 145 suggested problems that will be of interest to 
researchers. It is worthwhile to mention that in the course of this book we have 
introduced over 260 Smarandache notions pertaining to near-ring theory.  
 
My first thanks are due to Dr. Minh Perez, whose constant encouragement and 
intellectual support has made me to write this book.  
 
I am indebted to my devoted husband Dr. Kandasamy and my very understanding 
children Meena and Kama without whose active support this book would have been 
impossible.  
 
I humbly dedicate this book to the heroic social revolutionary Chhatrapathi Shahuji 
Maharaj, King of Kolhapur state, who, a century ago, began the policy of affirmative 
action in India, thereby giving greater opportunities for the socially dispriveleged and 
traditionally discriminated oppressed castes. His life is an inspiration to all of us, and 
his deeds are benchmarks in the history of the struggle against the caste system.

Chapter One 
 
PREREQUISITES  
 
 
In this chapter we just recall the definition of groups, groupoids, loops, semigroups, 
semirings and lattices. We only give the basic definitions and some of its properties 
essential for the study of this book. We at the outset expect the reader to have a good 
knowledge in algebra and in near-rings. This chapter has five sections. In the first 
section we recall the definition of groups and some of its basic properties. In section 
two we define groupoids and loops and introduce a new class of loops and groupoids 
built using the modulo integers Zn. Section three is devoted for giving the notions 
about semigroups and its substructures. In section four we recall the definition of 
semirings and its properties. In the final section we define lattices and give some 
properties about them.  
 
 
1.1  Groups with examples  
 
In this section we just recapitulate the definition of groups and some of its properties 
as the concept of groups is made use of in studying several properties of near-rings.   
 
DEFINITION 1.1.1: Let G be a non-empty set. G is said to form a group if in G there is 
defined a binary operation, called the product and denoted by ‘.’ such that  
 
1. a, b ∈ G implies a . b ∈ G. 
2. a, b, c ∈ G implies that a . (b . c) = (a . b) . c. 
3. There exists an element e ∈ G such that a . e = e . a = a for all a ∈ G.  
4. For every a ∈ G there exists an element a–1 ∈ G such that a . a–1 = a–1 . a = e.  
 
A  group  G  is  said to be abelian (or  commutative)  if  for every a, b∈ G, a . b =  
b . a. A group which is not abelian is called naturally enough non-abelian or non-
commutative.  
 
The number of elements in a group G is called the order of G and it is denoted by 
o(G) or |G|. When the number of elements in G is finite we say G is a finite group, 
otherwise the group is said to be an infinite group.  
 
DEFINITION 1.1.2: A non-empty subset H of a group G is said to be a subgroup of G if 
under the product in G, H itself forms a group.  
 
Example 1.1.1: Let G = Q \ {0} be the set of rationals barring 0. G is an abelian group 
under multiplication and is of infinite order.  
 
Example 1.1.2: Let S = {1, –1}, S is a group under multiplication. S is a finite group 
of order 2.  
 

 
8 
Example 1.1.3: Let X = {1, 2 ,…, n} be set with n elements. Denote by Sn the set of 
all one to one mappings of the set X to itself. Define a binary operation on Sn as the 
composition of maps. Sn is a group of finite order. |Sn| = n! and Sn is a non-
commutative group.  
 
Throughout this paper Sn will be called the symmetric group of degree n or a 
permutation group on n elements. An is a subgroup of Sn which will be called as the 
alternating group and its order is n!/2.  
 
DEFINITION 1.1.3: A subgroup N of a group G is said to be a normal subgroup of G if 
for every g ∈ G and n ∈  N,  gng–1 ∈ N or equivalently if by gNg–1 we mean the set of 
all  gng–1,  n  ∈  N  then N is a normal subgroup of G if and only if gNg–1⊂ N for 
every g ∈ G.  
 
N is a normal subgroup of G if and only if gNg–1 = N for every g ∈ G.  
 
DEFINITION 1.1.4: Let G be a group, we say G is cyclic if G is generated by a single 
element from G.  
 
Example 1.1.4: Let G = Z5 \ {0} be the set of integers modulo 5. G is a cyclic group. 
For 3 ∈ G generates G. G = {3, 32, 33, 34} = {3, 4, 2, 1}, 32 ≡ 4 (mod 5), 33 ≡ 2 (mod 
5) and 34 ≡ 1 (mod 5). So G is a cyclic group of order 4.  
 
It is obvious that all cyclic groups are abelian.  
 
DEFINITION 1.1.5: Let G and H be two groups. A map φ from G to H is a group 
homomorphism if for all a, b ∈ G we have φ (ab) = φ (a) φ (b).  
 
The concept of isomorphism, epimorphism and automorphism can be defined in a 
similar way for groups.  
 
 
1.2 Definition of Groupoids and Loops with examples  
 
In this section we introduce the notion of half-groupoids, groupoids and loops. Further 
we include here the loops and groupoids built, using the modulo integers Zn. We 
illustrate these with examples.  
 
DEFINITION 1.2.1: A half-groupoid G is a system consisting of a non-empty set G and 
a binary operation '.' on G such that, for a, b ∈ G, a . b may be in G or may not be in 
G if a . b ∈ G we say the product  under '.' is defined in G, otherwise the product 
under '.' is undefined in G.  
 
Trivially all groupoids are half-groupoids.  
 
Example 1.2.1: Let G = {0, 1, 4, 3, 2}. Clearly 3 . 4 , 2 . 4, 3 . 2 are some elements not 
defined in G where '.' is the usual multiplication. 
  

 
9 
DEFINITION 1.2.2: Let A be a non-empty set, A is said to be a groupoid if on A is 
defined a binary operation '∗' such that for all a, b ∈ A; a ∗  b ∈ A and in general a ∗ 
(b ∗ c) ≠ (a ∗  b) ∗ c for a, b, c ∈ A.  
 
A groupoid A can be finite or infinite according as the number of elements in A are 
finite or infinite respectively. If a groupoid A has finite number of elements we say A 
is of finite order and denote it by o(A) or |A|.  
 
Example 1.2.2: The following table A = {a, b, c, d, e} gives a groupoid under the 
operation '∗'.  
 
∗ a b c d e 
a a c b d a 
b c d e a b 
c b b c b b 
d d e e d a 
e e a e a d 
 
Clearly (A, ∗) is a groupoid and the operation '∗' is non-associative and A is of finite 
order.  
 
If a groupoid (A, ∗) contains an element i, called the identity such that a ∗ i    =  i ∗ a 
= a for all a ∈ A, then we say A is a groupoid with identity. If in particular a ∗ b = b ∗ 
a for all a, b ∈ A we say the groupoid is commutative.  
 
Now we proceed on to define the new classes of groupoid using Zn.  
 
DEFINITION 1.2.3: Let Zn = {0, 1, 2, …, n – 1}, n a positive integer. Define an 
operation '∗' on Zn by a ∗ b = ta + ub (mod n) where t, u ∈ Zn \ {0} with (t, u) = 1 for 
all a, b ∈ Zn. Clearly {Zn, '∗', (t, u)} is a groupoid. 
 
Now for any fixed n and for varying t, u ∈ Zn \{0} with (t, n) = 1 we get a class of 
groupoids. This class of groupoids is called as the new class of groupoids built using 
Zn. For instance for the set Z5 alone we can have 10 groupoids. Thus the number of 
groupoids in the class of groupoids built using Z5 is 10.  
 
Example 1.2.3: Let (Z5, ∗) be a groupoid given by the following table:  
 
∗ 0 1 2 3 4 
0 0 4 3 2 1 
1 3 2 1 0 4 
2 1 0 4 3 2 
3 4 3 2 1 0 
4 2 1 0 4 3 
 
Here t = 3 and u = 4, a ∗ b = 3a + 4b (mod 5). Clearly this is a non-commutative 
groupoid with no identity element having just five elements. We can also define 
groupoids using Zn where (t, u) = d, d > 1, t, u ∈ Zn \ {0}.  

 
10 
 
Now the groupoids in which (t, u) = d or t, u ∈ Zn \ {0} from a generalized new class 
of groupoids which contain the above-mentioned class. They have more number of 
elements in them. Just for comparison using Z5 we have, if we assume (t, u) = d we 
have in this class 12 groupoids and if just t, u ∈ Zn\{0} with no condition on t and u 
we have the number of groupoids in this new class of groupoids using Z5 to be 16.  
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache groupoid (S-groupoid).  
 
DEFINITION 1.2.4: A Smarandache groupoid (S-groupoid) G is a groupoid which has 
a proper subset S, S ⊂ G such that S under the operations of G is a semigroup.  
 
Example 1.2.4: Let (G, ∗) be a groupoid given by the following table:  
 
∗ 0 1 2 3 4 5 
0 0 3 0 3 0 3 
1 1 4 1 4 1 4 
2 2 5 2 5 2 5 
3 3 0 3 0 3 0 
4 4 1 4 1 4 1 
5 5 2 5 2 5 2 
 
Clearly (G, ∗) is a S-groupoid for it has A = {2, 5} to be a semigroup.  
 
DEFINITION 1.2.5: Let (G, ∗) be any group. A proper subset P of G is said to be a 
subgroupoid of G if (P, ∗) is a groupoid.  
 
Similarly (P, ∗) will be a Smarandache subgroupoid (S-subgroupoid) of G if (P, ∗) is 
a S-groupoid under the operation of ∗ ; i.e. P has a proper subset which is a 
semigroup under the operation '∗'.  
 
Now we proceed on to define free groupoid and Smarandache free groupoid as the 
notion of these concepts will be used in the construction of Smarandache semi-
automaton and Smarandache automaton.  
 
DEFINITION 1.2.6: Let S be a non-empty set. Generate a free groupoid using S and 
denote it by 〈S〉. Clearly the free semigroup generated by the set S is properly 
contained in 〈S〉; as in 〈S〉, we may or may not have the associative law to be true.  
 
Note: If S = {a, b, c, …} we see even (ab)c ≠ a(bc) in general for all a, b, c ∈ 〈S〉. 
Thus unlike a free semigroup where the operations is assumed to be associative, in 
case of free groupoids we do not even assume the associativity while placing them in 
juxtaposition.  
 
THEOREM [98]: Every free groupoid is a S-free groupoid.  
 
Proof: Obvious from the fact that the set S which generates the free groupoid will 
certainly contain the free semigroup generated by S. Hence the claim. 
  

 
11 
Now we proceed on to define loops and give the major important identities.  
 
DEFINITION 1.2.7: (L, ∗) is said to be a loop where, L is a non-empty set and ‘∗’ a 
binary operation called product defined on L satisfying the following conditions:  
 
1. For a, b ∈ L we have a ∗ b ∈ L. 
2. There exists an element e ∈ L such that a ∗ e = e ∗ a = a for all a ∈ L. e is 
called the identity element of L.  
3. For every ordered pair (a, b) ∈ L × L there exists a unique pair (x, y) ∈ L × L 
such that ax = b and ya = b.  
 
We say L is a commutative loop if a ∗ b = b ∗ a for all a, b ∈ L, otherwise L is non-
commutative. 
 
The number of elements in a loop is the order of the loop denoted by o(L) or |L|; if |L| 
< ∞ it is finite, otherwise infinite.  
 
Example 1.2.5: (L, ∗) is a loop given by the following table:  
 
∗ 
e 
a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 
e 
e 
a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 
a1 a1 
e 
a3 a5 a2 a4 
a2 a2 a5 
e 
a4 a1 a3 
a3 a3 a4 a1 
e 
a5 a2 
a4 a4 a3 a5 a2 
e 
a1 
a5 a5 a2 a4 a1 a3 
e 
 
It is easily verified this loop is non-commutative and is of finite order.  
 
DEFINITION 1.2.8: Let (L, ∗) be a loop. A proper subset P of L is said to be a subloop 
of L if (P, ∗) is a loop.  
 
DEFINITION 1.2.9: A loop L is said to be a Moufang loop if it satisfies any one of the 
following identities:  
 
1. (xy) (zx)  =  (x(yz)) x.  
2. ((xy)z) y  =  x(y (zy)). 
3. x(y(xz))  =  ((xy)x)z  for all x, y, z ∈ L.  
 
DEFINITION 1.2.10: Let L be a loop. L is called a Bruck loop if (x(yx)) z = (x(y(xz)) 
and (xy)–1 = x–1y–1 for all x, y, z ∈ L.  
 
DEFINITION 1.2.11: A loop (L, ∗) is called a Bol loop if ((xy)z)y = x((yz)y) for all x, y, 
z ∈ L.  
 
DEFINITION 1.2.12: A loop L is said to be right alternative if (xy) y = x (yy) for x, y ∈ 
L and L is left alternative if (xx) y = x(xy) for all x, y ∈ L. L is said to be an 
alternative loop if it is both right and left alternative loop.  

 
12 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.13: A loop (L, .) is called a weak inverse property loop (WIP-loop) if 
(xy) z = e imply x(yz) = e for all x, y, z ∈ L.  
 
DEFINITION 1.2.14: A loop L is said to be semialternative if (x, y, z) = (y, z, x) for all 
x, y, z ∈ L where (x, y, z) denotes the associator of elements x, y, z ∈ L. 
 
We mainly introduce these concepts as we are interested in defining non-associative 
near-ring in chapter six and the concept of loops and groupoids will play a major role 
in that chapter.  
 
Now we just proceed on to define Smarandache loops and conclude this section.  
 
DEFINITION 1.2.15: The Smarandache loop (S-loop) is defined to be a loop L such 
that a proper subset A of L is a subgroup with respect to the same induced operation 
that is φ ≠ A ⊂  L.  
 
Example 1.2.6: The loop (L, ∗) given by the following table is a S-loop.

The subset Hi = {e, ai} for all ai ∈ L is a subgroup of L, hence L is S-loop.  
 
Now we just recall the new class of loops constructed using Zn.  
 
DEFINITION 1.2.16: Let Ln(m) = {e, 1, 2, 3 ,…, n} be the set where n > 3, n is odd and 
m is a positive integer such that (m, n) = 1 and (m – 1, n) = 1 with m < n. Define on 
Ln(m) a binary operation '.' as follows:  
 
i) 
e . i = i . e = i for all i ∈ Ln(m). 
ii) 
i . i = i2 = e for all i ∈ Ln(m). 
iii) 
i . j = t where t = (mj – (m – 1)i) (mod n) for all i, j ∈ Ln(m), i ≠ j, i ≠ e and 
j ≠ e.  
 
Clearly Ln(m) is a loop. Let Ln denote the new class of loops, Ln(m) for a fixed n and 
varying m satisfying the conditions; m < n, (m, n) = 1 and (m – 1, n) = 1, that is Ln = 
{Ln(m) / n > 3, n odd, m < n, (m, n) = 1, (m – 1, n) = 1}.  
 

 
13 
We see each loop in this new class is of even order. For in L5 we have only 3 loops 
given by L5(2), L5(3) and L5(4) none of them are groups. Just for illustrative purpose 
we give the loop L5(3). The loop L5(3) in L5 is given by the following table: 
 
. 
e 1 2 3 4 5 
e e 1 2 3 4 5 
1 1 e 4 2 5 3 
2 2 4 e 5 3 1 
3 3 2 5 e 1 4 
4 4 5 3 1 e 2 
5 5 3 1 4 2 e 
 
This loop is commutative and is of order 6.  
 
 
1.3 Semigroups  
 
In this section we recall the concept of semigroups, Smarandache semigroups and 
some of its basic properties as this concept would be used to construct semigroup 
near-rings; a class of near-rings having a variety of properties.  
 
DEFINITION 1.3.1: Let S be a non-empty set. S is said to be a semigroup if on S is 
defined a binary operation ‘.’ such that for all a, b ∈ S, a . b ∈ S and (a . b) . c = a . 
(b . c) for all a, b, c ∈ S.  
 
A semigroup S is said to be commutative if a . b = b . a for all a, b ∈ S. A semigroup 
in which ab ≠ ba for at least a pair is said to be a non-commutative semigroup. 
 
A semigroup which has an identity element e ∈ S is called a monoid, if e is such that a 
. e = e . a = a for all a ∈ S. A semigroup S with finite number of elements is called a 
finite semigroup and its order is finite and it is denoted by o(S) = |S|. If |S| is infinite 
we say S is a semigroup of infinite order.  
 
DEFINITION 1.3.2: Let (S, .) be a semigroup. P a non-empty proper subset of S is said 
to be a subsemigroup if (P, .) is a semigroup.  
 
DEFINITION 1.3.3: Let (S, .) be a semigroup. A non-empty subset I of S is said to be a 
right ideal (left ideal) of S if s ∈ S and a ∈ I then a s ∈ I (s a ∈ I). An ideal is thus 
simultaneously a left and a right ideal of S.  
 
Example 1.3.1: Let Z9 = {0, 1, 2 ,…, 8} be the integers modulo 9. Z9 is a semigroup 
under multiplication modulo 9. P = {0, 3, 6} is an ideal of Z9.  
 
DEFINITION 1.3.4: Let S be a semigroup, with 0, an element 0 ≠  a ∈ S is said to be a 
zero divisor in S if there exists b ≠  0 in S such that a.b = 0.  
 
DEFINITION 1.3.5: Let S be a semigroup an element x ∈ S is called an idempotent if x2 
= x.  
 

 
14 
DEFINITION 1.3.6: Let S be a semigroup with unit 1. We say an element x ∈ S is said 
to be invertible if there exist y ∈ S such that xy  = 1.  
 
Now we proceed on to define the concept of Smarandache semigroup.  
 
DEFINITION 1.3.7: A Smarandache semigroup (S-semigroup) is defined to be a 
semigroup A such that a proper subset of A is a group with respect to the operation of 
the semigroup A.  
 
Example 1.3.2: Let Z12 = {0, 1, 2 ,…, 11} be the semigroup under multiplication 
modulo 12. Z12 is a S-semigroup for {4, 8} = P is a group under the operations of Z12.  
 
Example 1.3.3: Let Z4 = {0, 1, 2, 3} is a semigroup under multiplication modulo 4. Z4 
is a S-semigroup for P = {1, 3} is a group.  
 
DEFINITION 1.3.8: Let S be a S-semigroup. A proper subset P of S is said to be a 
Smarandache subsemigroup (S-subsemigroup) if P is itself a S-semigroup under the 
operations of S.  
 
Example 1.3.4: Let Z24 = {0, 1, 2 ,…, 23} be the S-semigroup under multiplication 
modulo 24. P = {0, 2, 4 ,…, 22} is a S-subsemigroup of Z24 as A = {8, 16} is a 
subgroup in P. Hence the claim.  
 
 
1.4 Semirings  
 
In this section we give the definition of semirings. As books on semirings is very rare 
we felt it would be appropriate to give this concept as it would be used in defining 
Smarandache seminear-rings and its Smarandache analogue.  
 
DEFINITION 1.4.1: Let (S, +, .) be a non-empty set on which is defined two binary 
operation ‘+’ and ‘.’ satisfying the following conditions:  
 
1. (S, +) is an additive abelian group with the identity zero.  
2. (S, .) is a semigroup.  
3. a . (b + c) = a . b + a . c and (a + c) . b = a . b + c . b for all a, b, c ∈ S. We 
call (S, +, .) a semiring.  
 
The semiring S is commutative if a . b = b . a for all a, b ∈ S. The semiring in which 
ab ≠ ba for some a, b ∈ S, we say S is a non-commutative semiring. The semiring has 
unit if e ∈ S is such that a . e = e . a = a for all a ∈ S.  
 
The semiring S is said to be a strict semiring if a + b = 0 implies a = b = 0 for all a, b 
∈ S.  
 
The semiring has zero divisors if a . b = 0 without a or b being equal to zero i.e. a, b 
∈ S \ {0}. A commutative semiring with unit which is strict and does not contain zero 
divisors is called a semifield.  
 

 
15 
Example 1.4.1: S = Z+ ∪ {0} the set of positive integers with 0 is a semifield under 
usual addition '+' and usual multiplication '.'.  
 
Example 1.4.2: Let S = Z+ ∪ {0}; take P = S × S; clearly P is a semiring which is not 
a semifield under componentwise addition and multiplication. 
 
DEFINITION 1.4.2: Let (S, +, .) be a semiring. A proper subset P of S is said to be a 
subsemiring if (P, +, .) is itself a semiring.  
 
DEFINITION 1.4.3: Let S be a semiring, S is said to be a Smarandache semiring (S-
semiring) if S has a proper subset B which is a semifield with respect to the 
operations of S.  
 
DEFINITION 1.4.4: Let S be a semiring. A non-empty proper subset A of S is said to be 
a Smarandache subsemiring (S-subsemiring) if A is a S-semiring i.e. A has a proper 
subset P such that P is a semifield under the operations of S.  
 
Example 1.4.3: Let Zo[x] be the polynomial semiring. Zo = Z+∪ {0}. Zo [x] is a S-
semiring and Zo is a S-subsemiring.  
 
Example 1.4.4: Qo = Q+ ∪ {0} is a S-semiring under usual addition '+' and 
multiplication '.'.  
 
DEFINITION 1.4.5: Let S be a S-semiring. We say S is Smarandache commutative 
semiring (S-commutative semiring) if S has a S-subsemiring A where A is a 
commutative semiring.  
 
For more about semirings and S-semirings please refer [100, 101].  
 
 
1.5  Lattices and its properties  
 
This section is devoted to the introduction of lattices and some of its basic properties 
as the concept of lattices is very much used in near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 1.5.1: Let A and B be two non-empty sets. A relation R from A to B is a 
subset of A × B. Relations from A to A are called relation on A, for short. If (a, b)∈R 
then we write aRb and say that ‘a is in relation to b’. Also if a is not in relation to b 
we write a R/ b.  
 
A relation R on a nonempty set A may have some of the following properties:  
 
R is reflexive if for all a in A we have aRa.  
 
R is symmetric if for all a and b in A aRb implies bRa. R is transitive if for all a, b, c 
in A aRb and bRc imply aRc. 
 

 
16 
A relation R on A is an equivalence relation, if R is reflexive, symmetric and 
transitive. In case [a]: {b ∈ A / aRb} is called the equivalence class of a, for any a ∈ 
A.  
 
DEFINITION 1.5.2: A relation R on a set A is called partial order (relation) if R is 
reflexive, anti-symmetric and transitive.  
 
In this case (A, R) is called a partial ordered set or a poset.  
 
DEFINITION 1.5.3: A partial order relation ‘≤ ’ on A is called a total order (or linear 
order) if for each a, b ∈ A either a ≤ b or b ≤ a; (A, ≤ ) is then called a chain or a 
totally ordered set.  
 
DEFINITION 1.5.4: Let (A, ≤ ) be a poset and B ⊆  A.  
 
a) a ∈ A is called an upper bound of B Ù∀  b ∈ B, b ≤  a.  
b) a ∈ A is called a lower bound of B Ù ∀  b ∈ B a ≤  b.  
c) The greatest amongst the lower bounds whenever it exists, is called the 
infimum of B and is denoted by inf B.  
d) The least upper bound of B whenever it exists is called the supremum of B and 
is denoted by sup B.  
 
DEFINITION 1.5.5: A poset (L, ≤ ) is called lattice ordered if for every pair of elements 
x, y in L the sup (x, y) and inf (x, y) exists.  
 
Remark:    
 
i) Every ordered set is lattice ordered.  
ii) If a lattice ordered set (L, ≤) the following statement are equivalent for all x and y 
in L 
 
a) x ≤ y. 
b) sup (x, y) = y. 
c) inf (x, y) = x . 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.6: An algebraic lattice (L, ∩, ∪) is a non-empty set L with two binary 
operations ∩ (meet) and ∪ (join) (also called intersection or product and union or 
sum respectively) which satisfy the following conditions for all x, y, z ∈ L.  
 
 
L1 
x ∩ y = y ∩ x; and x ∪ y = y ∪  x 
 
L2 
x ∩ (y ∩ z) = (x ∩  y) ∩ z and x ∪ (y ∪ z) = (x ∪ y) ∪ z 
 
L3 
x ∩ (x ∪ y) = x and x ∪ (x ∩ y) = x  
 
Two application of L3 namely x ∩ x = x ∩ (x ∩ x) = x lead to idempotent law. viz. x ∩ 
x = x and x ∪ x = x.  
 
DEFINITION 1.5.7: A nonempty subset S of a lattice L is called the sublattice of L if S 
is a lattice with respect to the restriction of ∪ and ∩ of L on to S.  
 

 
17 
DEFINITION 1.5.8: A lattice L is called modular if for all  x, y, z ∈ L x ≤ z implies x ∪ 
(y ∩ z) = (x ∪ y)  ∩ z this equation is known as the modular equation.  
 
Example 1.5.1: The lattice given by the following figure:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is called the pentagon lattice which is the smallest non-modular lattice.  
 
Example 1.5.2: The lattice given by the following figure is a modular lattice.  
 
This lattice will be called as the diamond lattice in this book.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.9: A lattice L is distributive if either of the following conditions hold 
for all x, y, z in L 
 
 
x  ∪ (y ∩ z) = (x ∪ y) ∩ (x ∪ z)  or 
x  ∩ (y ∪ z) = (x ∩ y) ∪ (x ∩ z).  
 
These equations are known as distributive equations.  
 
Remark: 
 
1. The pentagon lattice is non-distributive.  
2. All distributive lattices are modular.  
3. The diamond lattice is non-distributive but modular. It is the smallest non-
distributive lattice which is modular.

DEFINITION 1.5.10: A lattice in which every pair of elements is comparable i.e. if a, b 
∈ L we have a ≤ b or b ≤ a then we call such lattices as chain lattices. All chain 
lattices are distributive.  
 
DEFINITION 1.5.11: Let L be a lattice with 0 and 1. Let x ∈ L we say x has a 
complement y in L if x  ∩ y = 0 and x ∪ y = 1. A lattice L with 0 and 1 is called 
complemented if  for each x  ∈  L there is  at least one element y in L such that x ∩ y 
= 0 and x ∪ y = 1; y is called a complement of x.  
 
DEFINITION 1.5.12: A complemented distributive lattice is a Boolean algebra.  
 
Example 1.5.3: The following lattice is a Boolean algebra.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Remark: We have defined in the section 1.4 the concept of semirings and we see all 
Boolean algebras are semirings. In fact all distributive lattices are semirings.

NEAR-RINGS AND ITS PROPERTIES  
 
 
This chapter has five sections; in the first section we just recall the definition of near-
rings and give some examples. Section two is devoted to the introduction of N-groups, 
homomorphism and ideal like substructures. Direct products, and subdirect products 
in near-rings are introduced in section three. Section four is utilized in giving 
properties about ideals in near-rings. The fifth section is devoted to the recollection of 
modularity in near-rings. Near-polynomial rings are introduced in section six and the 
final section is devoted to introduce near-matrix rings. We have only recalled the 
definitions of these concepts and as we expect the reader to be well versed in the 
theory of near-rings the results and properties about near-rings should be known to the 
reader. Secondly as our main purpose is the study of Smarandache near-ring and 
Smarandache property in near-rings we do not even give problems for the reader in 
these sections.  
 
 
2.1 Definition of Near-ring and some of its basic properties  
 
In this section we just recall the definition of near-ring and illustrate it with examples. 
Several of its basic properties like homomorphism, direct products, N-groups etc are 
given in this section mainly to make it self contained. Certainly this does not mean 
that all properties about near-rings are given but we demand the reader to be well 
versed in near-ring theory. Most of the results given here are from the book of G.Pilz 
[61] who can be called as the father of near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 2.1.1: A near-ring is a set N together with two binary operations ‘+’ and 
‘.’ such that  
 
a. (N, +) is a group (not necessarily abelian). 
b. (N, .) is a semigroup. 
c. For all n1, n2, n3, ∈ N; (n1 + n2) . n3 = n1 . n3 + n2  . n3 (right distributive law). 
 
This near-ring will be termed as right near-ring. If n1 (n2 + n3  ) = n1 . n2 + n1 . n3 
instead of condition (c) the set N satisfies, then we call N a left near-ring.  
 
In this text by a near-ring we will mean only a right near-ring. This convention will be 
strictly followed unless otherwise stated explicitly. Further we will write ab for a . b 
just for simplicity of notation.  
 
Example 2.1.1: Z be the set of positive and negative integers with 0. (Z, +) is a group. 
Define '.' on Z by a . b = a for all a, b ∈ Z.   Clearly (Z, +, .) is a near-ring.  
 
Example 2.1.2: Let Z12 = {0, 1, 2 ,…, 11}. (Z12, +) is a group under ‘+’ modulo 12. 
Define '.' on Z12 by a . b = a for all a ∈ Z12. Clearly (Z12, +, .) is a near-ring.  
 

 
20 
Example 2.1.3: Let M2×2 = {(aij) / Z ; Z is treated as a near-ring}. M2×2 under the 
operation of '+' and matrix multiplication '.' is defined by the following:

It is easily verified M2×2 is a near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 2.1.2: (N, +, .) is a near-ring. |N| or o(N) denotes the order of the near-
ring N i.e. the number of elements in N. If |N| < ∞ we say the near-ring is finite if |N| 
= ∞ we call N to be an infinite near-ring. A non-empty set R is said to be a ring if on 
R is defined two binary operations '+' and '.' such that  
 
i) 
(R, +) is an abelian group. 
ii) 
(R, .) is a semigroup. 
iii) 
a . (b + c) = a . b + a . c and (a + b) . c = a . c + b . c for all a, b, c ∈ R.  
  
If a . b = b . a for all a, b ∈ R we say R is a commutative ring. If 1 ∈ R is such that 1 . 
a = a . 1 = a for all a ∈ R; then R is a ring with unit. If R \ {0} is an abelian group 
under '.' we say R is a field. Thus every ring is a field.   
 
The following concepts are defined in near-rings as in rings : Left (right) identities, 
left (right) zero divisors, left (right) invertible elements, left (right) cancellable 
elements, idempotents and nilpotent elements. 
 
Remark: Every ring is a near-ring.  
 
Notation: Let N be a near-ring. d ∈ N is called distributive if for all n, n1 ∈ N we have 
d(n + n1) = dn + dn1. Nd = {d ∈ N / d is distributive}  
 
DEFINITION 2.1.3: Let N be a near-ring. If (N, +) is abelian, we call N an abelian 
near-ring. If (N, .) is commutative we call N itself a commutative near-ring. If N = Nd , 
N is said to be distributive. If all non-zero elements of N are left (right) cancelable, we 
say that N fulfills the left (right) cancellation law. N is an integral domain if N has no 
non-zero divisors of zero. If N* = N \ {0} is a group N is called a near-field. A near-
ring, which is not, a ring will be referred to as non-ring. Similarly a non-field is a nf 
which is not a field. A near ring with the property that Nd generates (N, +) is called a 
distributively generated near-ring.  
 
Example 2.1.4: (Z2, +, .) be the set. Z2 = {0, 1} under ‘+’ usual addition ‘.’ defined as 
1.1 = 1 = 1.0 and 0.0 = 0.1 = 0 is a near-field.  
 
Throughout this book η will denote the class of all near-rings.

2.2 N-groups, Homomorphism and ideal-like subsets  
 
In this section we recall the definition of N-groups, N-homomorphism and ideals in a 
near-ring and illustrate with examples. For more about these concepts the reader is 
requested to refer [61].  
 
DEFINITION 2.2.1:  Let (P, +) be a group with 0 and let N be a near-ring. Let µ ; N × 
P → P; (P, µ) is called an N-group if for all p ∈ P and for all n, n1, ∈ N we have (n + 
n1) p = np + n1p and (nn1) p = n(n1p). N P stands for N-groups.  
 
DEFINITION 2.2.2: A subgroup M of a near-ring N with M.M ⊆ M is called a subnear-
ring of N. A subgroup S of N P with NS ⊂ S is a N-subgroup of P.  
 
Example 2.2.1: Let (Z, +, .) be the near-ring. (2Z, +, .) is a subnear-ring.  
 
Example 2.2.2: Let (R, +, .) be a near-ring. R denote the set of reals. R is a N-group. 
Q the set of rationals is a N-subgroup of R.  
 
DEFINITION 2.2.3: Let N and N1 be two near-rings. P and P1 be two N-groups.  
 
a. h : N → N1 is called a near-ring homomorphism if for all m, n ∈ N  
h(m + n) = h(m) + h(n)  and h(mn) = h(m) h(n).  
b. h : P → P1 is called N-homomorphism if for all p, q ∈ P and for all n ∈ N  
h(p + q) = h(p) + h(q) and h(np) = nh(p).  
 
DEFINITION 2.2.4: Let N be a near-ring and P a N-group. A normal subgroup I of (N, 
+) is called an ideal of N if  
 
i. 
IN ⊆ I.  
ii. 
∀ n, n1 ∈N and for all i ∈ I , n(n1 + i) – nn1∈ I.  
 
Normal subgroup T of (N, +) with (i) is called right ideals of N while normal 
subgroup L of (N, +) with (ii) are called left ideals. A normal subgroup S of P is 
called ideal of NP if for all s ∈ P; s1 ∈ S and for all n ∈ N, n(s + s1) – ns ∈ S. Factor 
near-ring N / I and factor N-groups P / S are defined as in case of rings.  
 
DEFINITION 2.2.5: A subnear-ring M of N is called invariant if MN ⊆ M and NM ⊆ 
M.  
 
It is pertinent to note that subnear-rings and ideals coincide in case of rings but does 
not in case of near-rings. A near-ring is simple if it has no ideals. NP is called N-
simple if it has no N-subgroups except 0 and P.  
 
DEFINITION 2.2.6: A minimal ideal N is an ideal which is minimal in the set of all 
non-zero ideals. Similarly, one defines minimal right ideals, left ideals, N-subgroups. 
Dually, one gets the concept of maximal ideals etc.  
 

 
22 
DEFINITION 2.2.7: Let X, Y be subsets of NP.  
 
 
(X : Y) = {n ∈ N / nY ⊆ X}.  
 
 
(0 : X) is called the annihilator of X.  
 
We denote it by (X : Y)N as N is the related near-ring. NP is faithful if (0:P) = {0}.  
 
 
2.3 Products, Direct sums and subdirect products in near-rings  
 
In this section we recall the concepts of products, direct sums and subdirect products 
in near-rings and illustrate them with examples.  
 
DEFINITION 2.3.1: Let {Ni} be a family of near-rings (i ∈ I, I an indexing set).

with the component wise defined operations ‘+’ and ‘.’, N is 
called the direct product of the near-rings Ni.  
 
Example 2.3.1: Let Z2 = {0, 1} be the near-field. Z be the near-ring. N = Z × Z2 is a 
direct product of near-rings. Here N = {(z, p) / z ∈ Z and p ∈ Z2} is a near-ring under 
component wise addition ‘+’ and ‘.’.  
 
DEFINITION 2.3.2: The subnear-ring of

projection maps πI (i ∈ I) are surjective (in other words for all i ∈ I and for all  in ∈ 
Ni, ni is the ith component of some element of N) is called the subdirect product of the 
Ni’s.  
 
DEFINITION 2.3.3: Let N be a near-ring and S a subsemigroup of (N, +). A near-ring 
Ns is called a near-ring of left (right) quotients of N with respect to S if  
 
a. Ns has identity. 
b. N is embeddable in Ns, by a homomorphism, h. 
c. For all s ∈ S; h(s) is invertible in (Ns, .).  
d. For all q ∈ Ns there exists s ∈ S and there exist n ∈ N such that q = h(n) 
h(s)-1 (q = h(s)-1 h(n)).  
 
DEFINITION 2.3.4: The near-ring N is said to fulfil the left (right) ore condition (ore 
(1)) with respect to a given subsemigroup S of (N, .) if for (s, n) ∈ S × N there exists 
ns1 = sn1 (s1n = n1s).  
 
DEFINITION 2.3.5: If S = {s ∈ N / s is cancellable} then Ns (if it exists) is called the 
left (right) quotient near-ring of N.

Notation: Let V denote the set of all variety of near-rings (example - all near-rings, all 
abelian near-rings, all near-rings with unity, or all distributive near-rings). Let X be 
any non-empty subset.  
 
DEFINITION 2.3.6: A near-ring FX ∈ V is called a free near-ring in V over X if there 
exists f : X → F (where X is any non-empty set) for all N ∈ V and for all g : X → N 
there exists a homomorphism h ∈ Hom (FX, N): h o f = g.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.7: Let V = {set of all near-rings}, we simply speak about free near-
ring on X. A near-ring is called free if it is free over some set X.  
 
On similar lines one can define free N-groups. For more about these properties refer 
[61].  
 
Finally it is interesting to note that if G is a group. M(G) be the set of all self maps of 
G and define operations on M(G) as additions of maps ‘+’ and compositions of maps 
‘o’ clearly (M(G), +, o) is a near-ring.  
 
 
2.4 Ideals in Near-rings  
 
Here we just recall the definitions related to ideals in near-rings. All proofs and 
theorems related to them are left as exercise for the reader to study and refer.  
 
DEFINITION 2.4.1: Let N be a near-ring. {Ik}k ∈ K be the collection of all ideals of the 
near-ring N. Then the following are equivalent :  
 
a. The set of all finite sums of the elements of the Ik’s. 
b. The set of all finite sums of elements of different Ik’s.

(or I1 + I2 + I3 …). 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.3: Let I be an ideal of the near-ring N. I is called a direct summand of 
N if there exists an ideal J in N such that N = I 
.
+ J.  
 
DEFINITION 2.4.4: A finite sequence N = N0 ⊃ N1 ⊃ N2 ⊃ … ⊃ Nn = {0} of subnear-
rings Ni of N is called a normal sequence of N if and only if for all i ∈ {1, 2, …, n} Ni 
is an ideal of Ni-1.  
 
In the special case that all Ni is an ideal of N call the normal sequence an invariant 
sequence. n is called the length of the sequence and Ni-1 / Ni are called the factors of 
the finite sequence. Furthermore properties can be had from [61]. As in case of rings 
in case of near-rings also D.C.C and A.C.C can be defined.  
 
DEFINITION 2.4.5: Let N be a near-ring (Np a N-group). N is called decomposable if it 
is the direct sum of nontrivial ideals or if it has nontrivial direct summand, otherwise 
indecomposable.  N is completely reducible if it is the direct sum of simple ideals.  
 
Example 2.4.1: The ring Z is indecomposable but is not simple. There exists nice 
relationship between completely reducible and ACCI and DCCI.  
 
Notation: If S and T are ideals of N then ST = {st / s ∈ S and t ∈ T}. For n ∈ N we 
can define Sn in a similar way when S is an ideal of N.  
 
DEFINITION 2.4.6: Let P be an ideal of the near-ring N. P is called a prime ideal if for 
all ideals I and J of N ; IJ ⊆ P implies I ⊂ P or J ⊂ P.  
 
DEFINITION 2.4.7: N is called a prime near-ring, if {0} is a prime ideal.  
 
DEFINITION 2.4.8: Let M ⊂ N, N a near-ring. M is called a m – system if for all a, b ∈ 
M there exists a1 ∈ (a) and b1 ∈ (b): a1 b1 ∈ M.  
 
DEFINITION 2.4.9: Let S be an ideal in N, S is semiprime if and only if for all ideals I 
of N I 2 ⊆ S implies I ⊂ S.  
 
DEFINITION 2.4.10: N is called a semiprime near-ring if {0} is a semiprime ideal.  
 

 
25 
DEFINITION 2.4.11: Let I be an ideal of N; the prime radical of I denoted by P(I) = 
∩
P
I
P
⊆
.  
 
DEFINITION 2.4.12: n ∈ N is nilpotent if nk = 0 for some k > 0, k an integer. S ⊂ N is 
nilpotent if Sk = {0}. S ⊂ N is called nil if all s ∈ S is nilpotent.  
 
 
2.5 Modularity in near-rings  
 
In this section we recall the concept of modularity, quasi regularity, idempotents and 
centralizer in near-ring. We give only the basic definitions.  
 
DEFINITION 2.5.1: Let L be a left ideal in a near-ring N. L is called modular if and 
only if there exists e ∈ N and for all n ∈ N, n – ne ∈ L. In this case we also say that L 
is modular by e and that e is a right identity modulo L since for all n ∈ N; ne = n 
(mod L).  
 
Results: 
  
1. Each modular left ideal L ≠ N is contained in a maximal one.  
2. If N = L1 + L2 where L1, L2 are modular left ideals, then L1 ∩ L2 is again 
modular.  
 
Notation: For z ∈ N, denote the left ideal generated by the set {n- nz / n ∈ N} by Lz. 
Note that for LZ = N, z = 0.  
 
DEFINITION 2.5.2: z∈ N is called quasi regular if z ∈ Lz, S ⊂ N is called quasi regular 
if and only if for all s ∈ S, s is quasi regular.  
 
Result: Each nil ideal I of a near-ring N is quasi regular.  
 
DEFINITION 2.5.3: Let E be the set of idempotents in N. A set E of idempotents is 
called orthogonal if for all e, f ∈ E, e ≠ f implies e.f = 0.  
 
DEFINITION 2.5.4: An idempotent e ∈ N is called central if it is in the center of (N, .) 
i.e. if for all n ∈ N; en = ne.  
 
DEFINITION 2.5.5: A ring R is called biregular if each principal ideal is generated by 
an idempotent.  
 
DEFINITION 2.5.6: A near-ring is said to be biregular if there exists some set E of 
central idempotents with  
 
a. For all e ∈ N, Ne is an ideal of N.  
b. For all n ∈ N there exist e∈ E; Ne = (n) (principal ideal generated by n).  
c. For all e, f ∈ E, e + f = f + e. 
d. For all e, f ∈ E, ef ∈ E and e + f – ef ∈ E.  
 

 
26 
[63] showed that each commutative biregular near-ring is isomorphic to a subdirect 
product of fields and hence is a biregular ring.  
 
DEFINITION 2.5.7: Let I be an ideal of N. The intersection of all prime ideals P which 
contain I is called the prime radical of I.  
 
We have just recalled some of the definitions, which we are interested in developing 
to Smarandache notions. We do not claim to have exhausted all the Smarandache 
notions about near-ring as in certain places we are not in a position to define 
Smarandache analogue. We have developed only those concepts which has interested 
us. The innovative reader can develop Smarandache notions for other concepts about 
near-rings which we have not dealt in this book.  
 
 
2.6 Near Polynomial rings  
 
In this section we define a new notion called near polynomial rings which are near-
rings only when the near-ring N is of the special form, otherwise the near polynomial 
ring will fail to be a near-ring.  
 
Throughout this section (N, +, .) will be a near-ring satisfying the following postulates 
(where N is a non-empty set).  
 
1. (N, +) is a group with 0 as the additive identity.  
2. For all m, n ∈ N we define m.n = m. Hence (N, .) is a semigroup. 
3. 1 ∈N is such that 1.x = 1 for all x ∈N  
4. (a + b)c = ac + bc is the only distributive law satisfied by N for all a, b, c ∈ N.  
 
Clearly N is a near-ring. We use only this near-ring to built near polynomial rings.  
 
DEFINITION 2.6.1: Let (N, +, .) be a near-ring and x an indeterminate. N(x) will be 
called the near polynomial ring where

 In N(x) two polynomials p(x), q(x) will be equal; where  
 
 
p(x) = p0 + p1x +  … + pnxn 
 
q(x) = q0 + q1x +  … + qmxm if and only if pi = qi and m = n, for each i.  
 
The addition of polynomials is given by  
 
p(x) + q(x) = (p0 + q0) + (p1 + q1) x + … + pn xn (qmxm) if n > m (if m > n). Thus 
(N(x), +) is a group with 0 = 0 + 0x + … + 0xn + … which acts as the 0 polynomial. 
For p(x), q(x) ∈ N(x) define ‘.’ as p(x).q(x) = p(x). (N(x), .) is a semigroup. Clearly 
(p(x) + q(x)) r(x) = p(x) r(x) + q(x) r(x). Thus (N(x), +, .) is a near-ring called the 
near polynomial ring.  
 

 
27 
DEFINITION 2.6.2: Let N(x) be a near polynomial ring. For 0 ≠ f(x) = a0 + a1x + … 
amxm where am ≠ 0; in N we define degree of f(x) to be m, thus deg f(x) is the index of 
the highest non-zero coefficient of f(x). 
  
deg [f(x) g(x)] = deg f(x). 
  
This is the marked difference between the polynomial ring and the near polynomial 
ring.  
 
Example 2.6.1: Let Z3 [x] be the near polynomial ring of degree less than or equal to 
2. That is Z3[x] = {0, 1, 2, x, 2x, x + 2, x + 1, 2x + 1 2x + 2, x2, 2x2, x2 + 2, x2 + 1, x2 
+ x, x + 2x2, x + x2 + 1, x + 2x2 + 1, 2x + x2 + 1 2 + x + x2, 2x + 2x2 + 2, 2x + 2 + x2, 
2x2 + 2x + 1, x + 2x2 + 2, 2 + 2x2, 2x2 + 2x, 2x2 + 1 2x + x2}. Z3[x] is a near 
polynomial ring with 27 elements in it.  
 
Example 2.6.2: Let Z2 = {0, 1} be the near-ring. Z2[x] is a near polynomial ring. Thus 
we get a class of near polynomial rings using Zn, Q or R but only restriction is a.b = a 
for all a, b ∈ Zn (or Q or R). 
 
Thus this gives us a new class of near-rings which will certainly have more interesting 
properties.  
 
 
2.7 Near Matrix rings  
 
In this section we introduce a new class of near-rings called near matrix ring. We will 
show near matrix rings are also near-rings. To build near matrix rings we take only 
near-rings N, defined in the earlier section i.e. in section 2.6 in which we have a.b = a 
for all a, b ∈ N and (a + b).c = a.c + b.c is the distributive law satisfied by N. We 
define near matrix rings as follows:  
 
DEFINITION 2.7.1: Let N be a near-ring. Consider the set of all n × n matrices with 
entries from N is denoted by Mn×n. Let M ∈ Mn×n then

In×n A ≠ In×n and A In×n ≠ A for A ∈ Mn×n also AB ≠ A for A, B ∈ Mn×n.  
 
Example 2.7.1: Let M2×2 = {(aij) / aij ∈ Z}. Z is a near-ring with usual addition but a .

Chapter Three 
 
SPECIAL CLASSES OF NEAR-
RINGS AND THEIR 
GENERALIZATIONS 
 
This chapter has 5 sections. As the name of the chapter suggests it deals with the 
introduction of several properties of near-rings, seminear-rings. We do not promise to 
prove any of the properties about these near-rings or seminear-rings. We in fact recall 
the definition of group near-rings and give the classical problems to be solved about 
these structures.  
 
In fact till date no one has introduced or studied the concept of semigroup near-ring. 
In this chapter we define and introduce those concepts. Section one recalls the 
definition of several properties about near-rings. Section two is solely devoted to the 
introduction and study of the concepts like group near-rings, semigroup near-rings, 
group seminear-rings and semigroup seminear-rings. Section three is completely used 
to define a new concept called near loop-rings. Loop near-rings have been already 
studied in [64] but the structure of loop near-rings is constructed by replacing a group 
by a loop in the definition of near-ring, so this study is interesting as it gives a class of 
non-associative near-rings and its generalizations. The fourth section is a still 
generalization of section three for it introduces a new class of non-associative near-
rings using groupoids over near-rings which the author chooses to call as groupoid 
near-rings. The study of this structure gives a non-abstract class of non-associative 
near-rings. The final section gives many special properties in near-rings and concepts 
related to near-rings.  
 
 
3.1 IFP-near-rings 
 
In this section we just recall the definition of IFP-near-rings as given by [61] and give 
some of the basic properties enjoyed by these near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 3.1.1: Let N be a near-ring. N is said to fulfil the insertion of factors 
properly (IFP) provided that for all a, b, n ∈ N we have ab = 0 implies a n b = 0. N 
has strong IFP property if every homomorphic image of N has the IFP.  
 
THEOREM 3.1.1: N has the strong IFP if and only if for all I in N and for all a, b, n ∈ 
N. ab ∈ I implies a n b ∈ I. 
 
Proof: The proof is straightforward, hence omitted.  
 
THEOREM 3.1.2: The following assertions are equivalent 
 
a) N has the IFP property. 
b) for all n ∈ N (0:n) is an ideal of N. 
c) for all S ⊆ N; (0:S) is an ideal of N.  

 
30 
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
DEFINITION 3.1.2: Let p be a prime. A near-ring N is called a p-near-ring provided 
that for all x ∈ N, xp = x and px = 0.  
 
DEFINITION 3.1.3: A near-ring N is Boolean if and only if for all x ∈ N, x2 = x.  
 
DEFINITION 3.1.4: Let (G, +) be a group. Define '∗' on G by a ∗ b = 0 for all a, b ∈ 
G. Then (G, +, ∗) is a IFP near-ring. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.5: Let (G, +) be a group. Define '∗' on G by a ∗ b = a if b ≠ 0, a ∗ b = 
0 if b = 0. Then (G, +, ∗) is a IFP near-ring.  
 
Now we get loop near-rings which are IFP as follows:  
 
DEFINITION 3.1.6: Let (L, +) be a loop. Define ∗ on L by a ∗ b = 0 for all a, b ∈ L; 
then (L, +, ∗) is a IFP-loop near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 3.1.7:  Let (L, +) be a loop. Define ∗ on L by a ∗ b = 0 if b ≠ 0 and a ∗ b 
= 0 if b = 0. Now (L, +, ∗) is a IFP-loop near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION [80]: A right ideal I of a near-ring N is called right quasi reflexive if 
whenever A and B are ideals of N with A.B ⊂ I then b (b' + a) – bb' ∈ I for all a ∈ A 
and for all b, b' ∈ B.  
 
DEFINITION [80]: A near-ring N is strongly subcommutative if every right ideal of it is 
right quasi reflexive; any near-ring in this class of rings is therefore right quasi 
reflexive.  
 
Example 3.1.1: The class of semiprime and prime near-rings are strongly 
subcommutative.  
 
THEOREM [80]: Let N be a strongly commutative near-ring and e be an idempotent in 
N. If eN is a right ideal of N, then eN is a ideal of N.  
 
Proof: Since N is strongly subcommutative near-ring, eN is right quasi reflexive ideal 
of N. Now by definition we see eN is an ideal of N as eN.N ⊂ eN we must have Ne.N 
⊂ eN.  
 
THEOREM [80]: Let N be a strongly subcommutative near-ring and e a non-zero 
idempotent in N. If eN is a minimal right ideal of N then eNe is a division subnear-
ring of N.  
 
Proof: Straightforward.  
 
Result [80]: If eN is a minimal right ideal with e a central idempotent in N then  
 
1) eN is a division near-ring. 

 
31 
2) If the right annihilator of e in N is zero then N is a division near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION [80]: Let N be a near-ring. S a subnormal subgroup of (N,+). S is called 
a quasi ideal of N if SN ⊆ NS ⊂ S where by NS we mean elements of the form {n(n' + 
s) – nn' / for all s ∈ S and for all n, n' ∈ N} = NS.  
 
THEOREM [80]: Let N be any strongly subcommutative near-ring and e a non-zero 
idempotent in N. If eNe is a minimal quasi ideal of N then eN is a minimal quasi 
reflexive ideal of N.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader as an exercise.  
 
DEFINITION [8]: A left near-ring N is said to satisfy left self-distributive identity if abc 
= abac for a, b, c ∈ N.  
 
DEFINITION [8]: A near-ring N is said to be  
 
left permutable if abc = bac,  
right permutable if abc = acb  
medial if abcd = acbd 
right self-distributive abc = acbc  
 
for all a, b, c, d ∈ N.  
 
DEFINITION [19]: Let (S, +, .) be a ring and M a right S-module. Let R = S × M and 
define (α, s)  (β, t) = (αβ, sβ + t). Then (R, +, ) is a left near-ring, the abstract 
affine near-ring inducted by S and M. If S is a right self-distributive near-ring and 
MS2 = 0 then R is a right self-distributive near-ring. If MS = 0 and S is a medial, left 
permutable or left-self distributive then (R, ) is a medial left-permutable or left-self 
distributive respectively.  
 
Example 3.1.2: Let (G, +) be a group and let h be any idempotent endomorphism on 
(G, +), define a ⊗ b = h(b) for each a, b ∈ G. Then (G, +, ⊗) is both a right self-
distributive and a left self-distributive near-ring.  
 
Example 3.1.3: Let F be a free near-ring and J the ideal of F generated as an ideal by 
{abc – abac / a, b, c ∈ F} then F/J is a left-self distributive near-ring.  
 
THEOREM 3.1.3: Let R be a left-distributive near-ring such that a, b,c ∈ R  and X is a 
non-empty subset of R. abc = abanc = abnc for n ≥ 1. Hence a3 = an is an idempotent 
for n ≥  3 and if abc = 0 then bac = 0.  
 
Proof: By the very definition, the result follows.  
 
Several results can be got in this direction [8]. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.8: A near-ring R is defined to be equiprime if for all 0 ≠ a ∈ R and x, 
y ∈ R, arx = ary for all r ∈ R implies x = y. If P is an ideal of R, P is called an 
equiprime ideal of R if R/P is an equiprime near-ring. It can be proved if P is an ideal 

 
32 
of r if and only if for all a ∈ R\ P, x, y ∈ P, arx – ary ∈ P for all r ∈ R implies x – y ∈ 
P. 
 
DEFINTION  [10]: An infra near-ring (INR) is a triple (N, +, . ) where 
 
i) 
(N, +) is a group. 
ii) 
(N, . ) is a semigroup. 
iii) 
(x + y)z = xz – 0z + yz for all x, y, z ∈ N.  
 
DEFINITION [10]: Let I be a left-ideal of N. Suppose that I satisfies the following 
conditions:  
 
i) 
a, x, y ∈ N, anx –any ∈ I  for all n ∈ N implies x – y ∈ I.  
ii) 
I is left invariant. 
iii) 
0N ⊂ I. 
 
Then I is called an equiprime left-ideal of N. We call an idempotent e of a near-ring to 
be central if it is in the center of (N, .) i.e. for all n ∈ N, ne = ex.  
 
DEFINITION 3.1.9: Let N be a near-ring. N is said to be partially ordered by ≤ if  
 
a) ≤ makes (N, +) into a partially (fully ordered group). 
b) ∀ n, n1 ∈ N, n ≥ 0 and n' > 0 implies nn' ≥ 0. 
 
DEFINITION [87]: Let N be a near-ring. Let I1, I2 ,…, Imbe the collection of all right 
ideals of N. We say N is a n-ideal near-ring (n an integer less than or equal to m) if 
for every n right ideals I1, I2  ,…, In of N and for every n elements X1, X2, …, Xn in N \ 
(I1 ∪ I2 ∪ … ∪ In) we have 〈 X1 ∪ I1 ∪ I2 … ∪ In 〉 = 〈 X2 ∪ I1 ∪ I2 ∪ … ∪ In 〉 = … = 
〈 Xn ∪ I1 ∪ … ∪ In〉 where 〈 〉 denotes the right ideal generated by Xi ∪ I1 ∪ … ∪ In; 1 
≤  i ≤ n.  
 
Example 3.1.4: Let Z8 = {0, 1, 2 ,…, 7} be the group under addition and 
multiplication as  
 
 
0.0 = 0.1 = 0.2 = … = 0.7 = 0 
1.0 = 1.1 = 1.2 = … = 1.7 = 1 
. . .   
7.0  = 7.1 = 7.2 = … = 7.7 = 7. 
 
I1 = {2, 4, 6, 0} and I2 = {0, 4} are the only ideals of Z8. Clearly Z8 is a 2-ideal near-
ring.  
 
Example 3.1.5: Let Z12 = {0, 1, 2, …, 11}. Define usual '+' on Z12 and '.' by a.b = a for 
all a, b ∈ Z12. Clearly (Z12, +, .) is a near-ring. I1 = {0, 6}, I2 = {0, 4, 8}, I3 = {0, 3, 6, 
9}, I4 = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10} be the set of all ideals of Z12. Z12 is not a 2-ideal near-ring 
for we take I1 and I2 and 3, 2 ∈ Z12 \ (I1∪ I2), (3 ∪ I1) = I3 and 〈2 ∪ I2〉 = I4. But it is 
easily verified Z12 is a 3-ideal near-ring and 4-ideal near-ring.  
 

 
33 
Example 3.1.6: Let Z7 = {0, 1, 2, 3 ,…, 6}. Clearly (Z7, +, .) is a near-ring which is 
not an n-ideal near-ring for any positive integer n.  
 
THEOREM 3.1.4: Let N be a near-ring. Let I1, I2, …, Im be the collection of all right 
ideals of N. If Ii ∩ Ij = {0} for i ≠ j for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. Then N is a n-ideal near-ring n ≤ 
m.  
 
Proof: Let I1 ,…, Imbe the set of right ideals of N. If Li ∩ Lj = {0} if i ≠ j for all 1 ≤ i, j 
≤ n.  Let X1 ,…, Xm ∈ N \ {I1 ∪ I2 ∪ … ∪ Im}. Then 〈X1 ∪ I1 ∪ I2 ∪ … ∪ Im〉 = 〈X2 
∪ I1 ∪ … ∪ Im〉 = … = 〈Xm ∪ I1 ∪ … ∪ Im〉 = N. 
 
THEOREM [87]: Let N be a near-ring. Let I1, I2, …, Im be the collection of all right 
ideals of N. N is not an n-ideal near-ring (n < m), if I1 ∪ I2 ∪ … ∪ In ⊆ Ik where Ik is 
a proper right ideal of N.  
 
Proof: Let I1, …, Im be any arbitrary collection of right ideals of N. Take X ∈ Ik \ (I1 
∪ … ∪ In) and Y ∈ N \ (I1 ∪ … ∪ In   ∪ Ik) then 〈X ∪ I1 ∪ I2 ∪ … ∪ In〉 = Ik and 〈Y 
∪ I1 ∪ … ∪ In〉 ≠ Ik, hence N is not a n-ideal near-ring.  
 
The concept of Γ-near-ring, a generalization of ring was introduced by Nobusawa [56] 
and generalized by [3]. A generalization of both the concepts of near-ring and the Γ-
ring, namely Γ-near-ring was introduced by [67] and later studied by [9]. 
 
DEFINITION [67]: Let (M, +) be a group (not necessarily abelian) and Γ be a non-
empty set. Then M is said to be a Γ-near-ring if there exists a mapping M × Γ × M → 
(the images of (a, α, b) is denoted by aαb) satisfying the following conditions :  
 
a. (a + b)αc = aαc + bαc    and  
b. (aαb)βc = aα(bβc)  
 
for all a, b, c ∈ M and α, β ∈ Γ. M is said to be a zero symmetric Γ near-ring if aα0 
= 0 for all a ∈ M and α ∈ Γ where 0 denotes the additive identity in M.  
 
Example [67]: Let (G, +) be a group and X be a non-empty set. Let M = {f / f: X → 
G}. Then M is a group under pointwise addition. If G is non-abelian, then (M, +) is 
non-abelian. To see this let a, b ∈ Γ such that a + b ≠ b + a. Now define fa , fb from x 
to G by fa(x) = b for all x ∈ X, fa, fb ∈ M and fa + fb ≠ fb + fa. Thus if G is non-
abelian then M is also non-abelian.  
 
Let Γ be a set of all mappings of G into X. If f1, f2 ∈ M and g ∈ Γ, then, obviously 
f1gf2 ∈ M for all f1, f2, f3 ∈ M and g1, g2 ∈ M it is clear that  
 
i) 
(f1g1f2)g2f3 = f1g1(f2g2f3) and  
ii) 
(f1 + f2)g1f3 = f1g1f3 + f2g1f3. 
 
But  f1g1 (f2 + f3) need not be equal to f1g1f2 + f1g1f3. To see this fix 0 ≠ z ∈ M and u 
∈ X. Define Gµ : G → X by gµ(x) = µ for all x ∈ G and fz : X → G by fz(x) = z for all 
x ∈ X. Now for any two elements f2, f3 ∈ M, consider fzgµ(f2 + f3) and fzgµf2 + fzgµf3. 

 
34 
For all x ∈ X [fzgµ(f2 + f3)](x) = fz[gµ(f2(x) + f3(x))] = fz(µ) = z and [fzgµf2 + fzgµf3](x) 
= fzgµf2(x) + fzgµf3(x) = fz(µ) + fz(µ) = z + z. Since z ≠ 0 we have z ≠ z + z and hence 
fzgµ (f2 + f3) ≠ fzgµf2 + fzgµf3. Now we have the following:  
 
If (G, +) is non-abelian and X is a non-empty set then M = {f / f: X → G} is a non-
abelian group under pointwise addition and there exists a mapping M × Γ × M → M 
where Γ = {g / g: G → X} satisfying the following conditions:  
 
i) 
(f1g1f2)g2f3 = f1g1(f2g2f3) and  
ii) 
(f1 + f2) g1f3 = f1g1f3 + f2g1f3. 
 
for all f1, f2, f3 ∈ M and for all g1, g2 ∈ Γ. Therefore M is a Γ-near-ring.  
  
DEFINITION [67]: Let M be a Γ-near-ring. Then a normal subgroup I of (M, +) is 
called  
 
i) 
a left ideal if a α (b + i) – a α b ∈ I for all a, b ∈ M, α ∈ Γ and i ∈ I.  
ii) 
a right ideal if i α a ∈ I for all a ∈ M, i ∈ I and  
iii) 
an ideal if it is both a left and a right ideal.  
 
DEFINITION [67]: An ideal A of M is said to be prime if B and C are ideals of M such 
that B ΓC ⊆ A implies B ⊆ A or C ⊆ A.  
 
DEFINITION [67]: Let M1 and M2  be Γ-near-rings. A group homomorphism f of (M1, 
+) into (M2, +) is called a Γ-homomorphism if f(x α y) = f(x) α f(y) for all x, y ∈ M 
and α ∈ Γ. We say f is a Γ -isomorphism if f is one to one and onto.    
 
For an ideal I of a Γ-near-ring the quotient Γ-near-ring M/I is defined as usual:  
 
THEOREM [67]: Let I be an ideal of M and f, the canonical group epimorphism from 
M onto M/I. Then f is a Γ-homomorphism of M onto M/I with kernel I. Conversely if f 
is a Γ-epimorhism of M1 onto M2 and I is the kernel of f then M1/I is isomorphic to 
M2.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
There is yet another theorem the proof of which is left as an exercise to the reader.  
 
THEOREM [67]: Let f be a Γ-homomorphism of M1 onto M2 with ker f = I and T∗ a 
non-empty subset of M2. Then T∗ is an ideal of M2 if and only if f'(T∗) = T is an ideal 
of M1 containing I. In this case we have M1/T, M2/T∗ and (M1/I)(T/I) are Γ-
isomorphic.  
 
Example [67]: Let G be a non-trivial group and X be a non-empty set. If M is the set 
of all mappings from X into G and Γ be the set of all mappings from G into X, then M 
is a Γ-near-ring. Let y be a non-zero fixed element of G. Define φ : X → G by φ(x) = 
y for every x ∈ X. Then 0 ≠ φ ∈ M, where 0 is the additive identity in M and φg0 = φ 
≠ 0 for any g ∈ Γ. Therefore M is a Γ-near-ring which is not zero-symmetric.

3.2 Group near-rings and its generalizations  
 
In this section we introduce the concept of group near-rings analogous to group rings 
where rings are replaced by near-rings. Such study was started only in the year 1992. 
When group near-rings find so much of place why group near-rings never grew into a 
theory is really incomprehensible. As there are several books on group rings there is 
not even a single book on group near-rings neither is the study become very popular. 
One of the reasons for it may be the following [61] concentrates only on the study of 
ideals, distributivity and idempotents. Apart from this one fails to study the 
isomorphism problem or semisimplicity problem or other famous problems about 
group near-rings.  
 
Just for the sake of completeness we recall the definition of group near-rings and 
develop the subject analogous to group rings.  
 
DEFINITION 3.2.1: Let G be any group under multiplication. N a near-ring with 1 
which is assumed to be commutative or a near-field. The group near-ring NG consists 
of all finite formal sums of the form Σ αi gi where i runs over a finite index and αi ∈ N 
and gi ∈ G; satisfying the following conditions.  
 
1. Σ αi gi = Σ βi gi Ù αi = βi where αi, βi ∈ N.  
2. Σ αi gi + Σ βi gi = Σ (αi + βi) gi . 
3. αi gi = gi αi . 
4. (Σαi gi) (Σ βj hj) = Σ λk k and gi hj = k and λk = Σαi βj . 
 
whenever the elements αi’s and βj's are distributive, if they are not distributive we 
assume   ( Σαi gi  =  (α1 g1 + … + αn gn  )  and   Σ βj hj   =  (β1 h1 + … + βm hm)) Σαi 
gi Σ βj hj = α1 g1 (β1 h1 +… + βm hm) + α2 g2(β1 h1 + … + βmhm) + … + αngn (β1 h1 

 
36 
+ … + βmhm) =  α1 (β1 g1 h1 + … +  βm g1 hm ) +  α2 (β2 g2 h2 +  … + βm g2 hm) + … 
+ αn (β1 gn h1 + … + βm gn hm). 
 
This will be defined in this text in two ways:  
 
1. Σ αi gi Σ βj hj = Σ α1 gi or  
2. α1 (g1 h1 + … + g1 hm) + ... + αn (gh h1 + … + gn hm).  
 
Here 'or’ in the mutually exclusive sense. We assume 1 . g = g for g ∈ G.  
 
Example 3.2.1: Let G = 〈g / gn = 1〉 and Z2 = {0, 1} be the near-field. The group near-
ring;

Example 3.2.2: Let G = 〈g / g2 = 1〉 and Z2 = {0, 1}. The group near-ring Z2G = {0, 1, 
g, 1 + g}.  
 
Study of zero divisor, units, idempotents, nilpotent elements happen to be an 
interesting feature but to the best of my knowledge there are only 5 papers on group 
near-rings where the study is made only relative to ideals, modules, direct 
decomposition and pseudo distributivity. The literature was got from the international 
near-ring community on searchable database [104]. Thus the author concludes if the 
study is taken online with the development and research as for the group ring, the 
group near-ring certainly will have more interesting results.  
 
DEFINITION 3.2.2: Let G be a group and N a near-ring. NG the group near-ring 
 
1. has zero divisors if αβ = 0 if α, β ∈ NG \ {0}. 
2. α2 = α for α ∈ NG \ {0, 1} will be called idempotents of NG.  
3. αβ = 1 where α, β ∈ NG \ {1} will be called units of NG.  
4. αn = 0 where α ∈ NG \ {0} will be called as nilpotent elements of NG.  
 
We know if G is a finite group the group ring KG is artinian. We propose the 
analogous problems; when is NG artinian given G is a finite group and N a near-ring? 
Such study is classically important as near-rings are the generalizations of rings it is 
all the more relevant. Analogous to the classical theorem on group rings which says if 
K is a field of characteristic 0, then KG is semiprime for any group G; what is the 
analogous question and solution in case of group near-ring? Now the study of the 
question: If Zm be a near-ring and G be a group with no elements of order m, m a 
prime. Can we say the group near-ring ZmG has no nonzero nil ideals?  
 
In case of group rings we have ZpG has no non-zero nil ideals if G has no elements of 
order p.  
 
Example 3.2.3: Let Z3 = {0, 1, 2} be a near-ring under usual ‘+’ modulo 3 and ‘.’ 
defined by a . b = a for all a, b ∈ Z3. G = 〈g / g2 = 1〉 be any group. The group near-
ring Z3G = {0, 1, 2, g, 2g, 1 + g, 1 + 2g, 2 + g}. Does Z3G have units, zero divisors or 
idempotents?  

 
37 
 
Is the group near-ring Z3G a p-near-ring? These two questions are left for the reader 
as exercise.  
 
The concept of modular group near-ring is briefly described here following the 
definition of [39]. Let ZpG be the group near-ring of a group G of prime order p over 
the near-ring Zp. We define the mod p-envelop of G denoted by G∗ = 1 +  U  where U 
= {Σ αi gi / Σ αi = 0}; G∗ may be a group or a semigroup.  
 
Example 3.2.4: Let G = 〈g / g2 = 1〉 be a group of order two, Z2 = [0, 1] be the near-
ring with 2 elements and Z2G be the group near-ring. G∗ = 1 + U = 1 + {0, 1 + g} = 
{1, g}, so G = G∗.  
 
Example 3.2.5: Let G = 〈g / g2 = 1〉 and Z3 = {0, 1, 2} be the near-ring. For the group 
near-ring Z3G the mod p-envelop of G is G∗ = {1, g, 2 + 2g, 1 + g} is a semigroup 
under multiplication.  
 
Example 3.2.6: Let G = 〈g / g2 = 1〉 be a group and Zp = {0, 1, 2, 3 ,…, p – 1} be a 
near-ring. Find G∗ for the group near-ring ZpG.  
 
What is the order of G∗? Is G∗ a semigroup?  
 
It is still more surprising to see that the notion of semigroup near-rings have not even 
been introduced, we on the contrary see that semigroup rings have become a very 
developed concept. Now semigroup near-rings are constructed in an analogous way as 
group near-rings. If we replace the group by a semigroup in the definition of group 
near-rings we get semigroup near-rings.  
 
All this study is significant as the class of semigroup near-rings is a more generalized 
concept than that of the group near-rings or to be more precise the class of group near-
rings is strictly and completely contained in the class of semigroup near-rings. 
 
We proceed on to study some famous and important concepts about semigroup near-
rings and at the same time we bring to the notice of the reader that a varied and a vast 
research can be carried out in this direction. Further we suggest several problems for 
the reader to solve in chapter ten.  
 
The study and characterization of zero divisors, units, idempotents, nilpotents in 
semigroup near-rings happens to be a routine one left for the reader to develop by 
putting conditions on both the semigroups and near-rings. We first give the condition 
for a semigroup near-ring to be a p-near-ring, secondly for it to be a Marot near-ring 
and finally for it to be the mod p-envelop of a semigroup S when Zp is the integral 
near-ring of order p. 
 
Throughout this section we assume Zp to be a near-ring of the form Zp where Zp is a 
group under ‘+’ modulo p and multiplication '.' defined by a . b = a for all a, b ∈ Zp.

THEOREM 3.2.1: Let S be a semigroup with identity 1. If the semigroup near-ring NS 
is a p-near-ring then S is a commutative semigroup with xp = x for every x ∈ S and N 
is a p-near ring without identity.  
 
Proof: Given NS the semigroup near-ring is a p-near-ring. As 1 ∈ S we have N.1 ⊆ 
NS so N is also a p-near-ring. Let n ≠ 0 be in N and s ∈ S, ns ∈ NS; (ns)p = np sp = nsp 
= ns (given) forcing sp = s. Since N is commutative we see S is also commutative.  
 
THEOREM 3.2.2: Let N be a finite p-near-field and S a commutative semigroup such 
that sp = s for every s in S and s . s1 = 0 if s ≠ s1, for all s, s1 ∈ S with multiplicative 
identity 1, then NS is a p-near-ring.  
 
Proof: A finite p-near-field is isomorphic to the field Zp so we have N = Zp; hence Zp 
S is a p-near-ring. For if α = Σ αi si ∈ Zp S we have αp = α (using the fact αI
p = αI for 
all αI ∈ Zp and sp = s for all s in S and S is a commutative semigroup with 1.  
 
THEOREM 3.2.3: Let N be a finite near-field. The semigroup near-ring NS is a p-near-
ring if and only if N is a p-near-ring and S is a commutative semigroup with identity 
in which every s ∈ S; sp = s and ss1 = 0 if s ≠ s1 for all s, s1 ∈ S.  
 
Proof: It is left for the reader to prove using the results given in the earlier theorems.  
 
THEOREM 3.2.4: Let S be a commutative idempotent semigroup in which xy = 0 if x ≠ 
y and Zp be the near-field of integers modulo p, p a prime. Then the semigroup near-
ring ZpS is a p-near-ring.  
 
Proof: Obvious from the fact xp = x for every x ∈ S. So ZpS is a p-near-ring.  
 
Finally it is left for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 3.2.5: Let N be a Boolean near-ring and S is an idempotent semigroup with 
identity in which x.y = 0 if x ≠ y. Then the semigroup near-ring NS is a Boolean near-
ring.  
 
Recall by a regular element of a near-ring N, we mean a nonzero divisor in N. An 
ideal containing regular elements is called regular. A commutative near-ring with 
identity is called a Marot near-ring if each regular ideal of N is generated by a regular 
element of N.  
 
Clearly every near-field is a Marot near-ring.  
 
THEOREM 3.2.6: Let S be an ordered semigroup without divisors of zero and with no 
elements of finite order and N be a near-field. The semigroup near-ring NS is a Marot 
near-ring.  
 
Proof: The proof follows from the fact that the semigroup near-ring NS has no zero 
divisors; using the fact S is ordered and has no elements of finite order and N is a 
near-field.  
 

 
39 
THEOREM 3.2.7: Suppose NS is a Marot semigroup near-ring with nontrivial divisors 
of zero then  
 
1. N has divisors of zero. 
2. S has divisors of zero.  
3. S has elements of finite order.  
4. N has divisors of zero and S has divisors of zero and elements of finite 
order.  
 
Proof: Given the semigroup near-ring is a Marot near-ring, so both N and S are 
commutative as N ⊆ NS and S ⊂ NS, N and S can have divisors of zero or S can have 
elements of finite order which obviously contribute to divisors of zero.  
 
THEOREM 3.2.8: Let N be a commutative Marot near-ring and N \ {0} = Nd. S be a 
commutative semigroup with identity, having no divisors of zero and 0 ∉ S. Then NS 
is a Marot semigroup near-ring.  
 
Proof: NS is a commutative near-ring as N and S are given to be commutative. To 
prove NS is a Marot near-ring we need to only prove that every regular ideal is 
generated by a regular element of NS; to prove this we have to prove.  
 
i. 
If a regular ideal I is generated by a regular element, I contains no 
proper divisors of zero.  
 
ii. 
If a regular ideal I is generated by a divisor of zero then I cannot 
contain regular elements.  
 
Proof of i. Let I be generated by the regular element α. Let β ≠ 0 ∈ I such that βλ = 0 
(λ ≠ 0). Now

The following result is obvious and is left as an exercise for the reader.  
 
THEOREM 3.2.9: If NS is a Marot semigroup near-ring then N is a commutative near-
ring and S is a commutative semigroup.  
 
THEOREM 3.2.10: Let N be a near-field. If NS is a Marot semigroup near-ring with 
divisors of zero then S is a commutative semigroup with divisors of zero or S has 
elements of finite order.

Proof: Straightforward and hence left for the reader to prove.  
 
The study of mod p-envelop of group of order p and K a field of characteristic p have 
been studied by [39]. Such study for group near-rings have not been carried out by 
any researcher. Here we just mention about this analysis and leave the rest for the 
reader to prove. We study this presently for the semigroup near-rings ZpS; where Zp is 
the integral near-ring and the mod p envelope of the semigroup S is denoted by S*.  
 
DEFINITION 3.2.3: Let ZpS denote the integral semigroup near-ring of the semigroup 
S over the near-ring Zp. Let U = {Σ αi si / Σ αi = 0} then 1 + U = S* is called the mod 
p envelope of the semigroup S over the integral near-ring Zp.  
 
Example 3.2.7: Let S = {s / s2 = s} be a semigroup and Z2 = {0, 1} be the integral 
near-ring with usual ‘+’ and in which ‘.’ is defined by a.b = a ∀ a, b ∈ Z2. Z2S = {0, 1, 
0.s, 1.s, 1+ 0.s, …}; U = {0, 0s, 1 + 1.s, 1 + 0.s + 1s}; S* = 1 + U = {1, 1 + 0s, 1.s, 0.s 
+ 1.s}. S* can be easily verified to be a semigroup under multiplication and |S*| = 4. It 
is left for the reader to verify the following example.  
 
Example 3.2.8: Let Z2 = {0, 1} and S = {a, b, ab / a2 = a, b2 = b and ab = ba} be the 
semigroup. The semigroup near-ring Z2S have its mod p envelope to be a semigroup 
S*, where |S*| = 26.  
 
We only propose several problems for the reader. Now the study of the following 
classical problems would certainly be of interest to any researcher. Now suppose 
given two semigroup near-rings NS and N1S1, when are they isomorphic. This 
problem for the case of group rings remains open. The study of such structures will

3.3 Loop near-rings and its generalization  
 
In this section we introduce the concept of non-associative near-rings and define two 
new classes of near-rings using groupoids and loops. They form a nice class of near-
rings satisfying certain special properties as well as satisfying some famous identities 
like Moufang. Bol, alternative etc. But the study of loop near rings was existent even 
from the year 1978 [64].  
 
Here we bring in the notions of bipotent loop near-ring, regular loop near-ring and 
several of the properties enjoyed by them.  
 
Study is also done about groupoid near-rings and half groupoid near-rings. Two types 
of loop near-rings are studied: we use loop near-rings analogous to group rings, which 
we denote by near loop rings. Another type of loop near-rings are got when we 
replace the group in the near-ring by a loop and the semigroup remains so.  
 
DEFINITION [75]: The system N = (N, +, ., 0) is called a right loop-half groupoid 
near-ring provided.  
 
1. (N, +, 0) is a loop.  
2. (N, .) is a half groupoid.  
3. (n1.n2).n3 = n1 (n2.n3) for all n1, n2, n3 ∈ N for which n1.n2, n2.n3, (n1.n2).n3 and n1. 
(n2.n3) ∈ N. 
4. (n1 + n2) n3 = n1.n3 + n2.n3 for all n1, n2, n3 ∈ N for which (n1 + n2)n3, n2.n3 ∈ N; 
we just denote n1.n3 by n1n3. If instead of (4) N satisfies n1(n2 + n3) = n1n2 + n1n3 
for every n1, n2, n3 ∈ N then we say N is a left loop-half groupoid near-ring.  
 
For any a belonging to the additive loop L we shall denote the unique left and right 
inverse of a by al and ar respectively.  
 
DEFINITION [75]: A right loop near-ring N is a system (N, +, .) of double composition 
‘+’ and ‘.’ such that  
 
1. (N, +) is a loop.  
2. (N, .) is a semigroup.  
3. The multiplication ‘.’ is right distributive over addition + i.e. for all n1, n2, n3 ∈ 
N; (n1 + n2).n3 = n1.n3 + n2.n3; here after by convention by a loop near-ring we 
mean only a right loop near-ring.  
 
Result [75]: A loop-half groupoid near-ring N is a loop near-ring if and only if (N, .) 
is a groupoid.  
 
Example 3.3.1: Every near ring is a loop near-ring.  
 
Example 3.3.2: Let (G, +, 0 ) be an additive loop where 0  is the identity element of 
G. Let ∆ be a proper subset of G. Define a.b = a for all a ∈ G and b ∈ ∆. Then (G, ‘+’, 
‘.’, 0 ) is a loop half groupoid near-ring.  
 

 
42 
DEFINITION [63]: Let (G, +, 0 ) be a loop and ∆ a subset of G. A set S of 
endomorphism of G is called a ∆ centralize of G provided.  
 
1. The zero endomorphism 0  ∈ S. 
2. S / 0ˆ (component of 0  in S) is a group of automorphism of G.  
3. φ (∆) ⊆ ∆ for all φ ∈ S.  
4. φ, ψ ∈ S and φ (ω) = ψ (ω) for some 0  ≠ ω ∈ ∆ imply φ = ψ.  
 
DEFINITION [63]: Let (G, +, 0 ) be a loop. Let ∆ be a subset of G and S a ∆ -
centralizer of G. A mapping T of G into itself is called a ∆ -transformation of G over S 
provided T [φ (ω)] = φ [T (ω)] for all ω ∈ ∆ and φ ∈ S. It is interesting to note that if 
0 ∈ ∆ and T is a ∆ -transformation of G over S then T fixes 0  i.e. 
 
T (0 ) = (0 ). 
 
We shall denote the set of all ∆-transformations of G over S by N (S, ∆). Further we 
see for any endomorphism φ of a loop G, [φ (g)]r = φ (gr ) for all g ∈ G.  
 
Result [63]: Let (G, +, 0) be a loop. ∆ a subset of G containing 0  and S a ∆ -
centralizer of G. Then N (S, ∆) is a loop-half groupoid near-ring under addition and 
composition of mappings but N (S, ∆) is not a loop near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION [63]: A non-empty subset M of a loop near-ring (N, ‘+’, ‘.’, 0) is said to 
be a subloop near-ring of N if and only if (M, ‘+’, ‘.’, 0) is a loop near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION [63]: A loop near-ring; N is said to be zero symmetric if and only if n0 = 
0 for every n ∈ N where ‘0’ is the additive identity. Zero symmetric loop near-ring 
will be denoted by N0.  
 
DEFINITION [63]: A loop near-ring is said to be a near-ring if the additive loop of the 
loop near-ring is an additive group. 
 
DEFINITION [63]: An element a of a loop near-ring N is said to be a left (right) zero 
divisor in N, if there exists an element b ≠ 0 in N such that ab = 0 (ba = 0). An 
element which is both a left and a right zero divisor in N is called a two sided zero 
divisor or simply a zero divisor in N.  
 
DEFINITION [63]: A map θ from a loop near-ring N into a loop near-ring N1 is called 
a homomorphism if  
 
θ (n1 + n2) = θ (n1) + θ (n2), 
θ (n1 n2) = θ (n1) θ (n2) for every n1, n2 ∈ N. 
 
DEFINITION [37]: Let N be a loop near-ring. An additive subloop A of N is a N-
subloop (right N-subloop) if NA ⊂ A (AN ⊂ A) where NA = {na / n ∈ N, a ∈ A}.  
 
DEFINITION [63]: A non-empty subset I of N is called left ideal in N if  
 

 
43 
1. (I, +) is a normal subloop of (N, +).  
2. n (n1 + i) + nrn1 ∈ I for each i ∈ I and n, n1 ∈ N, where nr denotes the unique 
right inverse of n.  
 
DEFINITION [37]: A non-empty subset I of N is called an ideal in N if  
 
1. I is a left ideal.  
2. IN ⊆ I.  
 
DEFINITION [38]: A loop near-ring N is said to be left bipotent if Na = Na2 for every 
a in N.  
 
Example [38]: Let N1 = {0, 1, 2, 3}, N2 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and N3 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} 
with additions defined as modulo 4, 5 and 7 respectively and multiplication by the 
following tables: 
 
(N1, .) 
. 
0 1 2 3 
0 0 0 0 0 
1 0 3 0 1 
2 0 2 0 2 
3 0 1 0 3

1 0 0 4 1 0 
2 0 0 3 2 0 
3 0 0 2 3 0 
4 0 0 1 4 0 
 
and (N3, .) is given by  
 
. 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
1 0 1 2 4 4 2 1

4 0 4 1 2 2 1 4 
5 0 5 3 6 6 3 5 
6 0 6 5 3 3 5 6 
 
Clearly N1, N2, N3 are left bipotent near-rings, hence left bipotent loop near-rings 
further we see in general a left bipotent loop near-ring need not be a left bipotent near-
ring by the following example [38].  
 
Example [38]: Consider the set N = {e, a, b, c, d} define addition ‘+’ as follows: 
 

 
44 
+ e a b c d 
e e a b c d 
a a b e d c 
b b c d a e 
c c d a e b 
d d e c b a 
 
Let the multiplication be defined by x.y = x for every x, y ∈ N. Since a + (b + d) ≠ (a 
+ b) + d; (N, +) is a loop and not a group. One can easily see that Na2 = N for every a 
∈ N. Thus N is a left bipotent loop near-ring which is not a left bipotent near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION [37, 38]: A loop near-ring N is said to be a s-loop near-ring if a ∈ Na for 
every a in N. 
 
Example [37, 38]: The following loop near ring (N, +, .) given by the following table 
where N = {0, a, b, c} is s-loop near-ring.  
 
+ 0 a b c 
0 0 a b c 
a a 0 c b 
b b c 0 a 
c c b a 0 
 
. 
0 a b c 
0 0 0 0 0 
a 0 a b c 
b 0 b 0 0 
c 0 c b c 
 
DEFINITION [38]: A loop near-ring N is said to be regular if for each a in N there 
exists x in N such that a = axa.  
 
THEOREM [38]: Let N be a s-loop near-ring, then N is regular if and only if for each    
a (≠ 0) in N there is an idempotent ‘e’ such that Na = Ne.  
 
Proof: Proof is left for the reader.  
 
DEFINITION [38]: A loop near-ring N is said to be strictly duo (duo) if every N-
subloop (left ideal) is also a right N-subloop (right ideal).

DEFINITION [38]: A loop near-ring N is called irreducible (simple) if it contains only 
the trivial N-subloops (ideals) (0) and N itself.  
 
DEFINITION [38]: A loop near-ring N is called a loop near-field if it contains an 
identity and each non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.  

 
45 
 
DEFINITION [38]: An ideal (P ≠ N) is called strictly prime (prime) if for any two N-
subloops (ideals) A and B of N such that AB ⊂ P then A ⊂ P or B ⊂ P.  
 
Definition [38]: A left ideal B of a loop near-ring N is called strictly essential if B ∩ 
K ≠ {0} for any zero N-subloop K of N. An element x in N is said to be singular if 
there exists a nonzero strictly essential left ideal A in N such that Ax = {0}.  
 
DEFINITION [38]: An element x of a loop near-ring N is said to be central if xy = yx 
for all y ∈ N.  
 
Result: If N1 is a homomorphic image of a regular loop near-ring N whose 
idempotents are central then the idempotents of N1 are also central.  
 
DEFINITION [38]: A nonzero loop near-ring N is said to be subdirectly irreducible if 
the intersection of all the non-zero ideals of N is non-zero.  
 
Now the study of loop rings was existent soon after the definition of group rings. 
Loop rings are nothing but loops over rings analogous to group rings which are 
groups over rings. But the study of “Loop near-rings” i.e. loops over near-rings was 
non-existent till 1990. The author  was the first one to study this concept [78]. As loop 
near-ring was not a loop over near-ring but in the definition of near-rings the additive 
group was replaced by a additive loop, so the author cannot call the study of loops 
over near-rings as loop near-rings so has decided to call these structure as near-loop 
rings which are loops over near-rings. Before we proceed on to define near loop rings 
we just give the definition of non-associative near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION [78]: Let (N, +, .) be a nonempty set. N is said to be a non-associative 
right near-ring if the following conditions are true.  
 
1. (N, +) is a group with identity 0.  
2. (N, .) is a non-associative semigroup (i.e. a groupoid). 
3. (a + b)c = ac + bc for all a, b, c ∈ N.  
 
If (N, +, .) has an element 1 such that a.1 = 1.a = a for all a ∈ N, we call N a non-
associative right near-ring with unit.  
 
If (N, .) is a loop; barring the zero element from N, we call N a non-associative 
division right near-ring. If N \ {0} is a commutative loop under the operation ‘.’ we 
call N a non-associative near-field.  
 
We say (N, +, .) is a non-associative left-near ring if instead of 3 we have a(b + c) = a 
. b + a . c for all a, b, c ∈ N. We study in this text only non-associative right near-ring 
which we simply term as non-associative near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION [78]: Let (L, ., 1) be a loop and N a near-ring with a multiplicative 
identity. The loop over near-ring, that is the near loop ring denoted by NL with 
identity is a non-associative near-ring consisting of all finite formal sums of the form 
α = Σ α (m)m; m ∈ L and α (m) ∈ N. 

 
46 
 
(where supp α = {m / α(m) ≠ 0}, the support of α is finite) satisfying the following 
operational rules.  
 
1. Σ α(m) m = Σ µ(m) m ⇔ α (m) = µ(m) for all m ∈ L. 
2. Σ α(m) m + Σ µ(m) m = Σ (α(m) + µ (m)) m; m ∈ L; α (m), µ(m) ∈ N. 
3. (Σ α(m) m) (Σ µ(m) n) = Σ γ(k) k; m, n, k ∈ L where γ (k) = Σ α(m) µ(n); mn = k 
∈ L (whenever they are distributive, otherwise it is assumed to be in NL).  
4. n (Σ α(m) m) = Σ n α (m) m for all n ∈ N and m ∈ L.  
5. α (m) m = m α (m) for all α (m) ∈ N and m ∈ L.  
 
Dropping the zero components of the formal sum we may write α = Σ αi mi; i = 1, 2 
,…, n. Thus m → m . 1 is an embedding of N in NL. After the identification of N with 
N . 1 we shall assume that N is contained NL. It is easily verified NL is a near-ring 
and it is a non-associative near-ring. Throughout this section N is right near-ring with 
identity 1.  
 
Result [78]: Let L be a Moufang loop. N a near-ring with identity. Then the near loop 
ring NL is a N-group.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM [78]: Let L be a Moufang loop and N a near-ring; NL the loop near-ring. 
The set of all ideals, (N-subgroups) of an N-group of NL forms a inductive Moore 
systems of NL.  
 
THEOREM [78]: Let N be a commutative near-ring without divisors of zero and L a 
Moufang loop with no elements of finite order. Then the near loop ring NL contains 
nontrivial associative near domains.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
We now proceed to define Marot loop near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION [83]: By a regular element of a near-ring N we mean a non-zero divisor 
in N. An ideal containing regular elements is called a regular ideal. A commutative 
near-ring with identity is called a Marot near-ring if each regular ideal of N is 
generated by a regular element of N.  
 
Example 3.3.3: Every near-field is a Marot near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION [83]: We call a commutative near loop ring NL with identity to be a 
Marot near-ring if each regular ideal of NL is generated by a regular element of NL; 
by a regular element we mean a nonzero divisor in NL.  
 
THEOREM [83]: Let N be a near-field and L a commutative ordered loop without 
elements of finite order then the near loop ring NL is a Marot near loop ring.  
 

 
47 
Proof: To prove NL is a Marot near loop ring it is sufficient if we prove NL has no 
zero divisors i.e. all elements in NL will be regular elements. To this end we make use 
of the following facts:  
 
1. N is a near-field so mn = 0 if and only if m = 0 or n = 0.  
2. L is ordered and has no elements of finite order. We prove this by assuming NL 
has zero divisors and arrive at a contradiction. Let

belong to NL; with g1 < g2 < … < gn and h1 < h2 < … < hm suppose αβ = ΣnigiΣmjhj = 
Σnimj gihj = 0; now nimj ≠ 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ m with g1h1 to be the smallest 
element and gnhm to be the largest element. So αβ = 0 is impossible as n1m1 ≠ 0 and 
nnmm ≠ 0. Thus αβ = 0 is impossible, hence NL has no zero divisors so all elements in 
NL are regular, thus NL is a Marot near loop ring.  
 
The reader is requested to develop more properties for Marot near-rings.  
 
THEOREM [82]: Let L be a loop and N a near-ring, NL the near loop ring (loop L over 
the near-ring N). If M ⊂ N is an invariant subnear-ring then the near loop ring ML is 
an invariant subloop near-ring.  
 
Proof: Follows from the fact M ⊂ N, MN ⊂ M and NM ⊂ M. Hence ML. NL ⊆ ML 
and NL. ML ⊆ ML.  
 
THEOREM [78]: Let N be a near-ring and L a disassociative loop then the near loop 
ring NL has proper near-ring.  
 
Proof: Follows from the fact L is diassociative; hence has subgroups and the group 
near-rings are near-rings. 
 
Now using the definition of [63] and [64] we take the near-ring to be the non-
associative near-ring with respect to ‘+’ given by them. Now using this loop near-ring 
as a near-ring we take loop L under multiplication and form the loop-loop near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION [91]: Let L be a loop (under multiplication) N a loop near-ring which is 
taken as a loop near-field. The loop – loop near-ring NL of the loop L over the loop 
near-ring N with identity is not even an associative loop but a doubly non-associative 
near-ring as (NL, ‘+’, ‘.’) is non-associative with respect to both ‘+’ and ‘.’. NL 
consists of all finite formal sums of the form

3. (Σ α(m)m) (Σ β(n)n) = Σγ(k) k; γ(k) = Σ α(m) β(n); mn = k; only when α(m)'s are 
distributive in N if α(m)'s are not distributive in N we assume the product is in NL.  
 
4. nΣα(m) m = Σnα(m)m if and only if n ∈ Nd. Dropping the zero components of the 
formal sum we may write α = ΣαImi. Thus n → n.1m. 1m is the identity of the loop 
L. So N.1 = N so N.1 = N ⊆ NL. The element 1.1m acts as the identity element of 
NL.  
 
This new concept has lead to define a new algebraic structure called Lield. Please 
refer [91] for more properties.  
 
DEFINITION [91]: A nonempty set (L, 0, ‘+’, ‘.’) is called a Lield if  
 
1. L is an abelian loop under ‘+’ with 0 acting as the identity.  
2. L is commutative loop with respect to ‘.’ ; 1 acts as the multiplicative identity.  
3. The distributive laws a (b + c) = ab + ac , (a + b) c = ac + bc for all a, b, c ∈ L 
holds good.  
 
NL defined above will be a Lield only if L is a commutative loop and NL has no zero 
divisors and NL = Nd.  
 
Near domains are defined in a different way by [42].  
 
DEFINITION [42]: The algebraic structure (D, ‘+’, ‘.’ 0, 1) is called a near domain if 
it satisfies the following axioms:  
 
1. (D, +, 0) is a loop.  
2.  a + b = 0 => b + a = 0 for all a, b ∈ D.  
3. 〈D∗, ‘.’ 1〉 is a group where D∗ = D \ {0}.  
4. 0.a = a.0 = 0 for all a ∈ D.  
5. a (b + c) = ab + bc for all a, b, c ∈ D. 
6. For every pair a, b ∈ D there exist da,b ∈ D∗ such that for every x ∈ D, a + (b + x) 
= (a + b) + da,b x.  
 
For more about near domains refer [42].  
 
Using this we define loop near domains which are analogous to groups over rings.  
 
DEFINITION [78]: Let L be a finite loop under ‘+’ and D be a near domain, the loop 
near domain DL contains elements generated by dimi where di ∈ D and mi ∈ L where 
we admit only finite formal sums satisfying the following conditions: 
 
1. (DL, 0, ‘+’) is a loop under ‘+’.  
2. dimi . djmj = didj mimj where we assume mimj ∈ DL as an element and didj = dk di, 
dj, dk ∈ D.  

 
49 
3. We assume (mi . mj ) . mk = mi (mj  . mk) where just the elements mi mj mk are 
juxtaposed; mi  , mj  , mk ∈ L. 
4. We assume only finite sequence of elements of the form m1 , m2  ,…, mk ∈ DL. 
5. mimj = mjmi for all mi, mj ∈ L.  
6. mi mj … mk = m1
1 m2
1 … mk
1 if and only if mi = mi
1 for i = 1, 2, 3, …, k.  
7. Since L is a loop under ‘+’ and D is also a loop under ‘+’; DL inherits the 
operation of '+' and ‘0’ serves as the additive identity of the loop DL.  
8. Since 1 ∈ D we have only 1.L ⊂ DL so L is a subset of DL and 1.mi = mi.1 = mi 
for all i ∈ L.  
 
Here the study, under what conditions will DL contain a near domain is an interesting 
one.  
 
DEFINITION 3.3.1: We call an additive loop L to be conditionally associative if  
 
1. L is closed under some product operation ‘.’. 
2. For every pair a, b ∈ L there exists da,b ∈ L \ {0} such that for every x ∈ L; a + (b 
+ x) = (a + b) + da.b.x.  
 
Example 3.3.4: Near domains are trivially conditionally associative loops. The 
following theorem is left for the reader as an exercise.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.1: Let L be a conditionally associative loop and D a near domain. The 
loop near domain DL is a conditionally associative loop.  
 
When we take for the near-ring the Boolean near-ring we can define the loop Boolean 
near-ring analogous to the loop near-ring. We just by default of notion call loops over 
Boolean near-rings as loop Boolean near-rings.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.2: Let N be a Boolean near-ring and L a loop. The loop Boolean near-
ring is not a Boolean near-ring.  
 
Proof: Straightforward, hence left for the reader as an exercise.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.3: Let N be a Boolean near-ring such that x.y = 0 for all x, y ∈ N , x ≠ 
y and L a finite loop. The loop Boolean near-ring NL has nontrivial idempotents.  
 
Proof: Let |L| = n and L = {m1 = 1, m2 ,…, mn}. Suppose 
∑

with αi’s distinct in N then, α2 = α is a nontrivial idempotent of NL.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.4: Let L be a finite loop and Z2 = (0, 1) be the Boolean near-ring. The 
loop Boolean near-ring Z2L has nontrivial subnear-rings which are Boolean near-
rings.  
 
Proof: |L| = n with L = {1, m2  ,…, mn }, n odd. Take S = {0, 1 + m2 + … + mn}. S is a

is a near-ring. L any loop. ZpL is a near loop ring which is a non-associative ring.  
 
Example 3.3.6: Let Z2 = (0, 1) be a near-ring and L be a loop given by the following 
table:  
 
. 1 a b c d e 
1 1 a b c d e 
a a 1 e b c d 
b b c d a e 1 
c c d 1 e a b 
d d e c 1 b a 
e e b a d 1 c  
 
Z2L is a near loop ring; (1 + a) ∈ Z2L is a zero divisor which can be easily verified. 
 
(1 + a) (1 + a + b + c + d + e) = 0 but (1 + a + b + c + d + e) (1 + a) ≠ 0; as Z2is not 
left distributive. (1 + a + b + c + d + e)2 = 0.  
 
Example 3.3.7: Let Z2 = (0, 1) be the near-ring and L be a loop given by the 
following table: 
 
. 
1 a b c d 
1 1 a b c d 
a a 1 c d b 
b b d a 1 c 
c c b d a 1 
d d c 1 b a 
 
Z2L the near loop ring is a non-associative ring. (1 + a + b + c + d)2 = 1 + a + b + c + 
d is an idempotent of Z2L.  
 
In view of the two examples we give the following theorem:  
 
THEOREM 3.3.5: Let Z2= {0, 1} be the near-ring. L be a loop of finite order. The near 
loop ring has atleast nontrivial idempotent if |L| is odd and has zero divisors in |L| is 
even.  
 

 
51 
Proof: Let |L| = n + 1 with L = {1, m1, …, mn}. Choose 
∑

m if |L| is odd then 
we get α2 = α and if |L| is even we get α2 = 0; hence the claim.  
 
Certainly the near loop ring Z2L may have more idempotents and zero divisors than 
the ones mentioned in the theorems. Now we proceed on to define a new concept 
called modular near loop rings; modular group rings of a finite p-group was studied 
by [39].  
 
DEFINITION [39]: Let ZpG be the group ring of a finite group G over the field Zp or 
the ring of integer Zn. The mod p envelop of G is defined to be set G* = 1 + U where

Example 3.3.8: Let Z2 = {0, 1} be the prime field of characteristic 2 and G = {g / g3 = 
1} be the group. The group ring Z2G has G* = 1 + U where U = {0, 1 + g, 1 + g2, g + 
g2}.  
 
Thus G∗ = 1 + U = {1, g, g2, 1 + g + g2} is the mod p envelop of G.  
We proceed on to define this concept in case of near loop rings.  
 
DEFINITION 3.3.2: Let L be a loop of finite order and Zp be the near-ring. ZpL be the 
near loop ring of the loop L over the near-ring Zp. The mod p envelop of the loop, L∗ 
= 1 + U where U = {Σαi mi / Σαi = 0, αi ∈ Zp}. 
 
Example 3.3.9: Let L be a loop given by the following table with 5 elements. 
 
 
1 a b c d 
1 1 a b c d 
a a 1 c d b 
b b d a 1 c 
c c b d a 1 
d d c 1 b a 
 
Z2 = {0, 1} be the near-ring. Z2L be the near loop ring.  
 
L∗ = 1 + U = 1 + {0, 1 + a, 1 + b, 1 + c, 1 + d, a + b, a + c, a + d, b + c, b + d, c + d, 1 
+ a + b + c, 1 + a + b + d, 1 + a + d + c, 1 + b + c + d, a + b + c + d} = {1, a, b, c, d, 1 
+ a + b, 1 + a + c, 1 + a + d, 1 + b + c, 1 + b + d, 1 + c + d, a + b + c, a + b + d, a + c + 
d, b + c + d, 1 + a + b + c + d}. L∗ is not a loop; L∗ is a groupoid. It is easily verified 
L∗ is closed under the product.  
 
In view of this we have the following result; the proof of which is left for the reader as 
an exercise.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.6: Let L be a loop of odd order n and Z2 = {0, 1} be the near-ring. Z2L 
be the near loop ring. Then L∗ is a groupoid with 1 and |L∗| = 2n–1.

All near-rings N in the following definitions are assumed to be non-associative for 
otherwise all identities will be trivially true. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.3: Let N be a non-associative near-ring we call N a moufang near-
ring if it satisfies any one of the following identities.  
 
i. 
(xy) (zx) = (x (yz)) x.  
ii. 
((xy) z) y = x (y (zy)).  
iii. 
x (y (xz)) = ((xy) x) z for all x, y, z in N.  
 
DEFINITION 3.3.4: We call a non-associative near-field N to be a Bruck near-ring if  
 
 
(x (yx)) z = x (y (xz)) 
 
and (xy)–1 = x–1y–1 for all x, y, z ∈ N.  
 
DEFINITION 3.3.5: Let N be a non-associative near-ring. N is said to be a Bol near-
ring if ((xy) z) y = x ((yz) y) for all x, y, z in N. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.6: We say the non-associative near-ring N to be right alternative 
near-ring if (xy) y = x (yy) for all x, y in N and left alternative if x (xy) = (xx) y. N is 
alternative if N is simultaneously right and left alternative.  
 
DEFINITION 3.3.7: A non-associative near-ring N is said to have weak inverse 
property (WIP) if (xy) z = 1 implies x (yz) = 1 for all x, y, z in N.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.7: Let Ln(2) be the loop n > 3 and n odd and N any near-ring. The loop 
near-ring NL2(2) is a right alternative near-ring.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.8: Let Ln(n-1) be the power associative loop and N any near-ring. NLn 
(n-1) is a left alternative near-ring.  
 
Proof: Left as an exercise to the reader to prove. 
 
Theorem 3.3.9: Let Ln(m) be any loop in Ln. NLn(m) for no near-ring N is a 
alternative near-ring.  
 
Proof: Straightforward by definition.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.10: Ln(m) ∈ Ln; NLn (m) for no Ln(m) is a Moufang near-ring.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.11: Let N be a near-ring. Ln(m) ∈ Ln be any loop. The near loop ring 
NLn(m) is never a Bol near-ring.  
 
Proof: Follows from the fact Ln(m) are never Bol loops.  

 
53 
 
Now we proceed on to define the concept of quasi regular elements in near loop rings.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.12: Let L be a loop and N any near-field. NL the near loop ring. Every 
element of the form 1 ± mj, mj ∈ L is quasi regular in the near loop ring NL. 
 
Proof: Let x = 1 ± mj choose y = ± mi such that mi mj = 1. Then y (1-x) = ± mi (1 – 1 
∓, mj ) = 1 (Choose –mj if x = 1 + mi and mj if x = 1 – mi ), hence x is quasi regular in 
NL.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.13: Let N be a near-field and L = {1, m2  ,…, mn} be a loop. NL the 
near loop ring. Elements in L can never be quasi regular. 
 
Proof: Suppose mi ∈ L be quasi regular then it implies α = Σaimi ∈ NL is such that α 
(1 – mi) = 1 but α (1 – mi) = α – α = 0. Hence the claim.  
 
Several interesting results can be obtained in this direction. It is left for the reader to 
prove or disprove if L = {m1 = 1, m2, …, mn} be loop of finite order and N a near-
field. α = Σai mi ∈ NL is quasi regular if and only if Σai is quasi regular in N. (Hint: 
mi runs over all elements of L and ai ≠ 0 for i = 1, …, n.).

3.4 Groupoid Near-rings and its Properties  
 
In this section we introduce a new type of non-associative near-rings using a groupoid 
and a near-ring and obtain several nice properties about these near-rings. The 
generalization of this is nothing but groupoids over seminear-rings these groupoid 
near-rings would be a larger class of non-associative near-rings which will contain the 
class of seminear-rings. In fact this class will be a class of non-associative seminear-
rings. Throughout this section we assume N to be a right seminear-ring with 1 and G a 
groupoid; G may have one of may not have one.  
 
DEFINITION 3.4.1: Let N be a seminear-ring with 1 and G any groupoid. The 
groupoid seminear-ring NG of the groupoid G over the seminear-ring N consists of 
all finite formal sums of the form Σ αi gi;  αi ∈ N; gi ∈ G (i – running over a finite 
index) satisfying the following properties:  
 
1. We assume NG consists of all elements of the groupoid G i.e. G ⊆ N by the 
assumption 1.g = g = g.1 where 1 ∈ N and g ∈ N. 
2. We have  
Σ αIi gi = Σ βi gi Ù αi = βi for all i.  
3. Σ αIi gi + Σ βi gi = Σ (αi + βi) gi .  
4. gi Σ αi hj = Σ αi gi hj (Clearly it can be checked NG is a semigroup under '+' (NG, 
.) is a groupoid).  
5. (Σαi gi) (Σ βj hj) = Σ λk sk where λk = Σαi βj and gi hj= sk if the elements αi 
distributes over βj otherwise we see (αi gi + … + αn gn) Σ βj hj = α1 g1 Σ βj hj + 
… + αn gn Σ βj hj (under assumption all our near-rings and seminear-rings are 
right distributive).  
= αi Σ βj gi hj + … + αn Σ βj gn hj 
= α Σ βj sij + … + αn Σ βj snj , 
gi hj = sij ∈ G.  

 
55 
6. gi α = α gi for all α ∈ N and gi ∈ G.  
 
Thus (NG, +, .) is a non-associative seminear-ring. This is the only known method to 
us by which we get non-associative seminear-rings. 
 
Since the seminear-rings happens to be non-associative we can define analogously the 
identities enjoyed by non-associative structures like Moufang, Bol, right (left) 
alternative, WIP.  
 
All other properties which are true in case of seminear-rings will continue to be true 
even in case of non-associative seminear-rings as in places where we have used 
product of 3 elements, except in the definition of IFP and regular elements.  
 
Example 3.4.1: Let Z4 = {0, 1, 2, 3} define ‘×’ and ‘.’ on Z4 as ‘×’ is the usual 
multiplication modulo 4, ‘.’ is a.b = a for all a ∈ Z4. Clearly (Z4, ×, .) is a right 
seminear-ring which is associative. G be a groupoid given by the following table:  
 
. 
a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 
a0 a0 a3 a0 a3 a0 a3 
a1 a2 a5 a2 a5 a2 a5 
a2 a4 a1 a4 a1 a4 a1 
a3 a0 a3 a0 a3 a0 a3 
a4 a2 a5 a2 a5 a2 a5 
a5 a4 a1 a4 a1 a4 a1 
 
Z4G is a groupoid seminear-ring which is a non-associative seminear-ring. Just we 
will call a non-associative seminear-ring N to be a Bol seminear-ring if ((xy)z)y = 
x(yz)y) for all x, y, z ∈ N.  
 
Let  
α  
= 
2a1 + 3a3 + a0 
β  
=  
3a5 + 2a2 + 2a4  
 
α β  
= 
(2a1 + 3a3 + a0) (3a5 + 2a2 + 2a4) 
= 
2a1 [ 3a5 + 2a2 + 2a4] + 3a3 [3a5 + 2a2 + 2a4] + a0 [3a5 + 2a2 + 2a4] 
=  
2 [3a1a5 + 2a1a2 + 2a1a4] + 3 [3a3a5 + 2a3a2 + 2a3a4] + 1 [a0a5 + 2a0a2 + 
2a0a4]  
=  
2 [3a5] + 3 [3a3] + 1 [3a3] 
 
=  
2a5 + 3a3 + a3 
 
=  
2a5 + 3a3.  
 
This example clearly illustrates how the product operation is performed in Z4G.  
 
The above groupoid G is a Bol groupoid. It can be easily verified by the reader.  
 
Example 3.4.2: Let Z6 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} with ‘×’ and ‘.’ the usual multiplication 
modulo 6 and ‘.’ is a.b = a for all a, b in Z6 be the seminear-ring. G be a groupoid 
given by the following table: 

 
56 
 
 
x1 x2 x3 
x1 x1 x3 x2 
x2 x2 x1 x3 
x3 x3 x2 x1 
 
Z6G is a groupoid seminear-ring if α = 3x1 + 2x2 we see α2 = 3x3 + 2x2 . α = x1 + x2 + 
x3 is such that α2 = (x1 + x2 + x3)2 = x1 + x2 + x3 = α. Now as we have constructed 
seminear-rings which are non-associative we can obtain zero divisor, idempotents, 
units from these groupoid seminear-rings.  
 
Thus finding these special elements in groupoid seminear-rings happens to be a very 
interesting problem.  
 
Example 3.4.3: Let Z4 = {0, 1, 2, 3} be a seminear-ring and G be a groupoid given by 
the following table:  
 
. 
a0 a1 a2 a3 
a0 a0 a2 a0 a2 
a1 a1 a3 a1 a3 
a2 a2 a0 a2 a0 
a3 a3 a1 a3 a1 
 
Z4G be the groupoid seminear-ring. Let α = 2 (a0 + a1 + a2 + a3) and β = (a0 + a1 + a2 
+ a3); it is easily verified that αβ = 0. I = Z4H where H = {a0, a2} is not a left ideal of 
the seminear-ring. Recall in a seminear-ring N, I is a left ideal in N if  
 
1. (I, +) is a subsemigroup of (N, +). 
2. n (n1 + i) + nn1 ∈ I (for each i ∈ I and n, n1 ∈ N). But this seminear-ring 
Z4G has several subsemigroups.  
 
Just like groupoids can be used to built automaton we see using group automaton we 
can construct syntactic near-rings. Chapter seven is completely reserved for dealing 
with the probable applications of Smarandache near-rings and Smarandache seminear-
rings both associative and non-associative.  
 
The study of the groupoid seminear-rings when we take the groupoid from the new 
class of groupoids and seminear-ring as Zn, n non-prime or Z+ ∪ {0} happens to be a 
very concrete study. We see there are a lot of openings to find under what conditions 
these groupoid seminear-rings happen to be Bol, Moufang, right (left) alternative or 
WIP.  
 
Such study is at a very dormant stage as this is the first place we have made the 
definition non-associative seminear-rings to be satisfying several of these identities. 
Before we propose problems we make some more new definitions.  
 

 
57 
DEFINITION 3.4.2: Let N be a non-associative seminear-ring. We say N is a weak Bol 
seminear-ring if N has a proper subseminear-ring M which is non-associative and all 
elements of M satisfies the Bol identity.  
 
Note: N need not be a Bol seminear-ring still N can be a weak Bol seminear-ring i.e. 
all elements of N need not satisfy Bol identity.  
 
DEFINITION 3.4.3: Let N be a non-associative seminear-ring. If every subseminear-
ring M of N which is also a non-associative subseminear-ring satisfies the Bol identity 
or is a Bol subseminear-ring then we say N is a strong Bol seminear-ring.  
 
THEOREM 3.4.1: Let N be a strong Bol seminear-ring then N is a weak Bol seminear- 
ring.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition. The reader is requested to give an example of a 
weak Bol seminear-ring which is not a strong Bol seminear-ring.  
 
Remark: In a similar way as we have defined weak and strong Bol seminear-rings we 
can define weak Moufang seminear-rings, strong Moufang seminear-ring, weak 
alternative seminear-rings and strong alternative seminear-rings and so on. The reader 
is requested to develop these ideas and characterize these groupoid seminear-rings. 
We just define P-seminear-rings where N is a non-associative seminear-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 3.4.4: Let N be a non-associative seminear-ring; we say N is a P-
seminear-ring if (x.y). x = x.(y.x) for all x, y ∈ N.  
 
One can define P-weak seminear-ring and P-strong seminear-ring and obtain 
interesting results about them. Thus using groupoids and seminear-rings we can 
construct a class of non-associative seminear-rings.  
 
Apart from these class of non-associative seminear-rings the author is not in a position 
to get any non-associative seminear-rings.

3.5 Special properties of Near-rings  
 
This section has very unique feature, for here we just recall several definitions of 
different authors and have listed them. The main purpose of this book is to study and 
introduce as many as Smarandache concepts in near-rings; so we avoid dealing with 
near-rings; whereever it is a dire necessity we give the definitions. This section gives 
the definitions from several authors.  
 
DEFINITION [22]: Let N be a zero symmetric left near-ring. A mapping F : N → N is 
said to be commuting on the subset S of N if [x, F(x)] = 0 for all x ∈ S, where [x, y] = 
xy – yx.  
 
A mapping D : N → N is called a multiplicative derivation if D(xy) = x D(y) + D(x)y 
for all x, y ∈ N; if D is also additive, D is called a derivation.  
 
Several interesting properties can be derived in case of S-near-ring and all the more 
on non-associative near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION [5]: Near-rings here are left near-rings. A near-ring N is weakly divisible 
if for all x, y ∈ N there exists z ∈ N, such that xz = y or yz = x.  
 
For more about these near-rings please refer [5].  
 
DEFINITION [14]: The right near-ring N is called strongly prime if for each a ∈ N \ 
{0} there exists a finite subset F such that aFx ≠ {0} for all x ∈ N \ {0} [respectively 
such that afx = afy for all f ∈ F implies x = y].  
 
DEFINITION [51]: Let S be a non-empty subset of a right near-ring N and define the 
left and right polar subsets of N, respectively by L(S) = {x / xNs = (0) ∀ s ∈ S} and 
R(S) = {y / sNy = (0) ∀ s ∈ S} If PL(N) is the set of left polar subsets of N and PR(N) 
is the set of nonempty right polar subsets of N, then PL(N) and PR(N) are complete 
bounded lattices.  
 

 
59 
DEFINITION [4]: A generalized p-near-field (gp near-field) is a near-ring with 1 in 
which for each x there is an n = n(x) with xn(x) = 1. N is called an gp-near-ring if it 
has nonzero nilpotent elements and its one sided proper non-nil ideals are gp-near-
fields.  
 
DEFINITION [43]: If R is a ring and M is an R-module then there is exactly one way to 
extend the module multiplication ‘o’ in (N, +) = (R, +) ⊕ (M, +) to get an abstract 
affine near-ring namely (r, m) o (s, n) = (rs, rn + m).  
 
DEFINITION [69]: Let N be a near-ring, S a non-empty subset of an N-group V. An N-
subgroup H of V centralizes S if (h + u) a = ha + ua for all h ∈ H, u ∈ S and a ∈ N.  
 
DEFINITION [69]: An involution in a near-ring N (with identity) is a proper unit λ that 
satisfies λ2 = 1. If N is generated by some single involution then N is an involution 
near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION [18]: A group semiautomaton is an ordered triple S = (G, I, δ) where G 
is a group, I is a set of inputs and δ : G × I → G is a transition function. The syntactic 
near-ring of S denoted by N (S) is a subnear-ring of M(G) generated by the maps fx 
where afx = δ (a, x) together with the identity map of G.  
 
DEFINITION [102]: A θ-symmetric near-ring N is called reliable if whenever θ : I → N 
is an epimorphism and I is an ideal of a near-ring A then for (x, y ∈ I, a ∈ A); x – y ∈ 
Ker θ implies ax – ay ∈ Ker θ.  
 
DEFINITION [30]: Let N be a near-ring one can define an equivalence relation on N 
by a ≡ b if and only if na = nb for all n ∈ N.  
 
N is called planar if there are more than three equivalence classes and every equation 
of the form xa = xb + c has a unique solution x when a ≡/  b.  
 
A planar near-ring can be used to construct balanced incomplete block designs 
(BIBD) of high efficiency. By taking either rows or columns of the incidence matrix 
of such a BIBD one can obtain error correcting codes with several nice features.  
 
DEFINITION [49]: An I-E group is a group which satisfies I (G) = E(G) where I(G) is 
the near-ring generated by all the inner automorphisms of G and E(G) is the near-
ring generated by all the endomorphisms of G. The authors show that a semidirect 
product G = H.K of I-E groups where (|H|, |K|) = 1 and H is normal in G in an I-E-
group if and only if projection of G onto K is in I(G).  
 
DEFINITION [50]: A group G written additively is an I-E group if I(G) = E(G). Here 
I(G) and E(G) are near-rings additively generated by the inner automorphisms and 
the endomorphisms of G respectively.  
 
DEFINITION [73]: Let G = S ⊕ Z be the direct sum of a simple non-abelian group S of 
order n, and a cyclic group Z of order q, where S contains a cyclic group of order q. 
Let E(G) be the near-ring generated by all the endomorphism of G. Let N = {a ∈ 
E(G) / Ga ⊆ S, Sa = {0}} Then N is an ideal of order nn(q-1).  

 
60 
 
DEFINITION [20]: S is a unitary non-associative zero symmetric right near-ring. L 
denotes the set of all elements in S without left inverses. U = S \ L and (A, B, C) = 
{(ab) c – a (bc) / a ∈ A, b ∈ B, c ∈ C} where (A, B, C) ∈ {L, S, U}.  
 
DEFINITION [27]: Let (G, +) be a group written additively not necessarily abelian, 
with identity element denoted by 0. Let T ⊂ G \ {0} and define . Γ by a. Γ b  = a if b 
∈ T; aΓ b = 0 if b ∉ T. Then {G, +, Γ } is a right zero symmetric near-ring.  
 
Several interesting results have been carried out in this direction.  
 
DEFINITION [15]: Let N be a near-ring and let N0 be a subset of N such that N0 
generates N and NN0 ⊆ N0; suppose that A0 is a subset of N0 then, NA0 ⊂ A0 and A0 
N0 ⊂ A0. Then A0 is called the σ -subset of N and the subnear-ring generated by A0 is 
called a σ -subnear-ring N. A class B of near-rings is called σ - hereditary of N ∈ B. 
A σ - subnear-ring E of N is a called essential in N if 0 ≠ A is an ideal of N implies E 
∩ A ≠ 0. 
 
DEFINITION [34]: A subset S of a near-ring N is integral if S has no nonzero divisors 
of zero. If H is an integral subset of N with the further property that N2 ⊂ H then N is 
said to be an H- integral near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION [13]: Let N be a right near-ring and G a N-group. G is called equiprime 
if NG ≠ 0, N0 = 0 and if for each a ∈ N and g, g1 ∈ G with Ga ≠ 0; ang = ang1 for all 
n ∈ N implies g = g1. The equiprime ideals of N are precisely the annihilators of 
equiprime N-groups.  
 
DEFINITION [27]: A semiautomaton S = (Q, X, δ) with state set Q, input monoid X and 
state transition function δ : Q × X → Q is called a group semiautomaton if Q is an 
additive group. S is called additive if there is some x0 ∈ X with δ (q, x) = δ (q, x0) + δ 
(0, x) and δ (q – q1, x0) = δ (q, x0) - δ (q1, x0) for all q, q1 ∈ Q and x ∈ X. Then there is 
some homomorphism  
 
 
ψ : Q → Q and some map  
 
 
 
α : X → Q with φ (x0) = 0  
 
and δ (q, x) = ψ (q) + α (x). Let δx for a fixed x ∈ X be the map Q → Q, q → δ (q, x) 
then {δx / x ∈ X} generates a subnear-ring N(P) of the near-ring (m(Q), +, .) of all 
mappings on Q. The near-ring N(P) is called the syntactic near-ring of P.  
 
DEFINITION [13]: Let N be a right near-ring and A an ideal or a left ideal of N. We 
define three properties as follows: 
 
a. 
A is equiprime if for any a, x, y ∈ N such that anx – any ∈ A for all n ∈ 
N, we have a ∈ A or x – y ∈ A.  
b. 
A is strongly semiprime if for each a ∈ N \ A there exists a finite subset F 
of N such that if x, y ∈ N and afx – afy ∈ A for all f ∈ F then x – y ∈ A.  
c. 
A is completely equiprime if a ∈ N \ A and ax – ay ∈ A imply x – y ∈ A.  

 
61 
 
DEFINITION [55]: A right near-ring N is a left infra near-ring if (N, +, .) is a triple 
where N is a non-empty set + and . are binary operations satisfying  
 
1. (N, +) is a group.  
2. (N, .) is a semigroup. 
3. For all x, y, z in N, x.(y + z) = x.y – x.0 + x.z. 
 
DEFINITION [41]: A near-ring M which satisfies the property, A an ideal of B, B an 
ideal of N and B / A ≅ M implies A is an ideal of N for all near-rings N and subnear-
ring A and B of N are called F near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION [20]: The authors consider a left zero symmetrical near-ring R and 
subsemigroup S of R under multiplication. Let D be the normal subgroup of R under 
addition generated by the set of differences { –(xs + ys) + (x + y)s / x, y ∈ R; s ∈ S}. 
Call D the defect of distributivity. D is a minimal defect if D is either {0} or minimal 
as a normal subgroup of R under addition.  
 
DEFINITION [23]: The author defines weak-weakly regular near-ring. A near-ring N is 
left weak-weakly regular if every x ∈ N is of the form x = ux for some u in the 
principal ideal generated by x and is left weakly regular if every a ∈ N is in the 
product of {Na} * {Na} = {finite sums Σxk yk / xk, yk ∈ Na}.  
 
DEFINITION [60]: A composition near-ring is a quadruple {C, +, 0, .) where (C, +,.) 
and (C, +, o) are near-rings such that (a.b) o c = (a o b) .c for all a, b, c ∈ C.  
 
DEFINITION 3.5.1: A nonzero ideal H of G is said to be uniform if for each pair of 
ideals K1 and K2 of G such that K1 ∩ K2 = (0); K1 ⊂ H, K2 ⊂ H implies K1 = (0) or 
K2= (0).  
 
DEFINITION 3.5.2: An ideal H of G is said to have finite Goldie dimension (written as 
FGD) if H does not contain an infinite number of non-zero ideals of G whose sum is 
direct. 
 
THEOREM [67]: Let G be a N-group with FGD then every nonzero ideal of G contains 
a uniform ideal.  
 
The proof is left for the reader. Now we proceed on to introduce a new notion called 
normal near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 3.5.3: Let N be a near-ring; an element a ∈ N is called normal element of 
N if aN = Na. If aN = Na for every a ∈ N then N is called a normal near-ring. Let 
n(N) denote the set of all normal elements of N. N is a normal near-ring if and only if 
n(N) = N.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.1: Let N be a near-ring we can have n(N) = φ.  
 
Proof: Take Zm = {0, 1, 2, …, m-1} the set of integers modulo m. {Zm, +, .} is a near-
ring under addition ‘+’modulo m and ‘.’ defined by a.b = a for all a, b ∈ Zm, n(N) = φ.  

 
62 
 
DEFINITION 3.5.4: Let N be a near-ring. A subnear-ring S of N is called a normal 
subnear-ring with respect to a non-empty subset T of N if ts = st for every t ∈ T. In 
particular we have nS = Sn for every n ∈ N we say S is a normal subnear-ring of N.  
 
DEFINITION 3.5.5: Let N be a near-ring, a subsemigroup S of N is called a normal 
subsemigroup of S if nS = Sn for all n ∈ N.  
 
PROPOSITION 3.5.1: Let N be a near-ring and S be a normal subsemigroup of (N, .) 
then N satisfies the left ore condition with respect to S of (N, .) 
 
Proof: N is said to fulfill the left ore condition with respect to a given subsemigroup S 
of (N, .) if for all (s, n) ∈ S × N there exists (s1, n1) ∈ S ×N; ns1 = sn1. Now if S is a 
normal subsemigroup then we have nS = Sn that is ns1 = s2n for n ∈ N; hence N 
satisfies the left ore condition with respect to normal subsemigroup S of (N, .).  
 
DEFINITION 3.5.6: Let N be a near-ring a subnear-ring M of N is invariant with 
respect to an element a ∈ N \ M if a M ⊂ M and Ma ⊂ M and strictly invariant with 
respect to a if aM = M and Ma = M.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.2: A subnear-ring M of N is invariant with respect to every element a of 
N; then M is invariant subnear-ring of N.  
 
Proof: Straightforward; left for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.3: Let N be a near-ring. A subnear-ring M is strictly invariant with 
respect to every element T in a subset in N. Then M is a normal subnear-ring with 
respect to T.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
DEFINITION 3.5.7: A commutative near-ring N with identity is called a Marot near-
ring if each regular ideal of N is generated by regular elements, where by regular 
ideal we mean an ideal with regular elements and a non-zero divisor of a near-ring N.  
 
Example 3.5.1: All near-fields are Marot near-rings.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.4: Let G be a torsion free abelian group and N a near-field. The group 
near-ring is a Marot near-ring.  
 
Proof: Straightforward, hence left for the reader to prove. A near-ring N is Boolean if 
and only if for all x ∈ N, x2 = x. A near-ring N is a p-near-ring if and only if for all x 
∈ N; xp = x and px = 0.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.5: Let N be a near-ring which is Boolean and is such that x.y = 0 for 
every distinct pair of elements x, y ∈ N and S a semigroup. The semigroup near-ring 
NS is a Boolean near-ring if and only S is a semigroup such that in S for any ai, aj ∈ 
S, ai ≠ aj we have ai aj = 0 and ai aj = ai if ai = aj.  
 

 
63 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader to prove. It is important to note that if we 
replace the semigroup by a group and even if N is a Boolean near-ring with x2 = x and 
xy = 0 if x ≠ y for all x, y ∈ N; NG the group near-ring is never a Boolean near-ring 
as in G we can never have g2 = g.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.6: Let G be a group of finite order say n, n-odd Z2 = {0, 1} be the near-
ring. Then the group near-ring Z2G has nontrivial subBoolean near-rings.  
 
Proof: Clearly S = {0, (1 + g2 + … + gn)} is a nontrivial Boolean near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION [66]: Let K and I be ideals of a N-group G, K is said to be the 
complement of I if the following two conditions are true.  
 
1. K ∩ I = (0) and  
2. K1 is an ideal of G such that K ⊂ K1, K1 ≠ K imply K1 ∩ I ≠ 0.  
 
THEOREM [66]: Let G be a N-group. Fix an ideal I of G, by Zorn’s lemma, the set of 
all ideals H of N satisfying H ∩ I = (0) contains a maximal element say K. Again by 
Zorn’s lemma the set of all ideals X of G satisfying I ⊂ X and X ∩ K = (0) contains a 
maximal element say K0 then we have  
 
a. K is complement of I,  
b. K0 is a complement of K;  
c. K + I and K + K0 are essential ideals and  
d. I is essential in K0.  
 
Proof: The proof can be had from [66].  
 
DEFINITIONS [66]:  
 
a. A subset S of the N-group G is said to be small in G if S + K = G 
and K is an ideal of G imply K = G.  
b. G is said to be hollow if every proper ideal of G is small in G and  
c. G is said to have finite spanning dimension (FSD in short) if for 
any decreasing sequence of N-subgroups.  
 
X0 ⊃ X1 ⊃ X2 ⊃ … of G such that Xi an ideal of Xi-1 ;  there exists an integer k such 
that Xj is small in G for all j > k.  
 
DEFINITION [65]: Suppose H and K are two N-subgroups of G. Then K is said to be 
supplement for H if H + K = G and H + K1 ≠ G for any proper ideal K1 of K.  
 
THEOREM [65]: Let H be a non-small N-subgroup of G. If every proper ideal of H is 
small in G then H is hollow.   
 
Proof: Left for the reader to refer [65]  
 
THEOREM [65]: If G has FSD, then every non-small N-subgroup H of G contains a 
hollow N-subgroup which is non-small in G.  

 
64 
 
Several more results can be had from [65]. Now we proceed on to define a new class 
of near-rings called near semilattices [85].  
 
DEFINITION [85]: Let L be a lattice with 0 and 1. The new product is defined on L ×p 
L as  
 
1. a1, a, b1, b ∈ L we have (a, b) ∪ (a1, b1) = (a1 ∪ a1, b∪ b1). 
2. (a,b) ∩ (a1, b1) = (a ∩ b1, b ∩ a1) (‘∪’ and ‘∩’ can also be inter changed).  
Clearly (0, 0) and (1, 1) are the least and the greatest elements of L ×p L. 
Obviously L ×p L is not a lattice; we call this structures (L ×p L, ∪, ∩) a near-
semilattice.  
 
DEFINITION [85]: Let L be a lattice, if we define a new product on L ×q L as  
 
1. L ×n L = {(a, b) / a, b ∈ L}. 
2. For (a, b), (c, d) ∈ L ×n L (a, b) ∪ (c, d) = (a ∪ d, b ∪ c). 
3. (a, b) ∩ (c, d) = (a ∩ d, b ∩ c). 
 
then we call L ×9 L a quasi near semilattice. For this also (0, 0) acts as the least 
element and (1, 1) acts as the greatest element. If lattice L is distributive we get a near 
semilattice to be a seminear-ring.  
 
Example 3.5.2: Let L = {0, 1} be the two element lattice L ×p L = {(0,0) (1, 0) (0, 1), 
(1, 1)}. Clearly L ×p L is a semilattice with respect to ∩ (or ‘∪’) but not even a 
semilattice under ‘∪’ (or ∩) L  ×p L = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)} is the quasi near-
semilattice.  
 
THEOREM [85]: Let L ×p L, L ×q L be the near semilattice and quasi near semilattice 
where L has 0 and 1. Then L ×p L and L ×q L have nontrivial idempotents.  
 
Proof: Obvious from the fact (x, x) under the operation ∪, ∩ are idempotents. It is 
very important to note no other elements other than elements of the form (x, x) are the 
only idempotents.  
 
Example [85]: Let L = {0, 1}; L ×p L, be the near semilattice {L ×p L, ∪, ∩} has the 
following diagram:

(0, 1) 
(0, 0) (1, 0) 
(0, 1) (0, 0)

65 
 
DEFINITION [85]: Let L and L1 be any two lattices L ×p L and L1 ×p L1 be near 
semilattices. A map φ from L ×p L to L1 ×p L1 is called a near semilattice 
homomorphism if  
 
 
φ ((a, b) ∪ (c, d)) = φ (a1 b1) ∪ φ (c1 d1) and  
 
 
φ ((a, b) ∩ (c, d)) = φ (a1 b1) ∩ φ (c1 d1) 
 
for all (a, b), (c, d) ∈ L ×p  L and (a1, b1), (c1, d1) ∈ L1 ×p L1. Clearly φ (0, 0) = (0, 0) 
and φ (1, 1) = (1, 1).  
 
DEFINITION [85]: Let L be a lattice L ×p L be a near semilattice of L. S a proper 
subset of L ×p L is called a subnear-semilattice if (S, ∪, ∩) itself a near semilattice.  
 
Also if S1 is a sublattice of L then S = S1 ×p S1 is also a subnear semilattice. This study 
becomes interesting when the lattices under study are distributive so that L ×p L 
becomes a seminear-ring.  
 
Finally we introduce yet another structure about seminear-rings, which we call as 
seminear pseudo rings (SNP-ring).  
 
DEFINITION 3.5.8: Let P be a non-empty set on which is defined two binary 
operations ⊕  and  satisfying the following conditions:  
 
a. For all p, q ∈ P, p ⊕ q ∈ P.  
b. p ⊕ p = e for all p ∈ P, e is called the one sided identity in P with 
respect to the operation ⊕.  
c. p ⊕  e = p for all p ∈ P.  
d. p ⊕  q ≠ q ⊕ p for p, q ∈ P.  
e. (p ⊕  q) ⊕  r ≠ p ⊕ (q ⊕ r), in general for p, q, r ∈ P.  
f. p  q ∈ P for all p, q ∈ P.  
g. p  p = e1, e1 ∈ P is the one sided identity with respect to  for 
all p ∈ P.  
h. p  q ≠ q  p for p, q ∈ P.  
i. p  (q  r) ≠ (p   q)  r for p, q, r ∈ P.  
j. (p ⊕ q )   r  = p  r ⊕ q  r for all p, q, r ∈ P.  
 
Then (P, ⊕, ) is called a seminear pseudo ring.  
 
Example 3.5.3: Q be the field of rationals; define on Q '⊕'  as the usual ‘–’ and   as 
p  q = p  q-1. It is easily verified (Q, ⊕ , ) is a SNP-ring.  
 
Example 3.5.4: Let D be a division ring of characteristic 0. Define p ⊕  q = p – q , p 
 q = q
p , (q ≠ 0), p  0 = 0 . Clearly (D, ⊕, ) is a SNP-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 3.5.9: Let (R, ⊕, ) be a SNP-ring. A proper subset S ⊂ R is said to be a 
SNP-subring of R if (S, ⊕, ) is a SNP-ring.  

 
66 
 
DEFINITION 3.5.10: Let (R, ⊕, ) be a SNP-ring. A nonempty subset I of R is called 
the SNP-ideal if  
 
1. For all p, q ∈ I, p ⊕  q ∈ I.  
2. 0 ∈ I. 
3. For all p ∈ I and r ∈ R we have p  r or r  p ∈ I.  
 
DEFINITION 3.5.11: Let (R, ⊕, ) be a SNP-ring if (a ⊕  b)   c = a  c ⊕  b  c 
for all a, b, c ∈ R; then R is a quasi SNP-ring.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.7: Every SNP-ring is a quasi SNP-ring and not conversely.  
 
Proof: Straightforward by the very definition.  
 
DEFINITION 3.5.12: Let (R, ⊕, ) and (Q, ⊕, ) be two SNP-rings. A SNP-ring 
homomorphism φ form (R, ⊕, ) to (Q, ⊕ 1,  1) satisfies the following operational 
rules  
 
1. φ (r ⊕ s) = φ (r)  ⊕ 1 φ (s). 
2. φ (0) = 0.  
3. φ (r  s) = φ (r)   1 φ (s). 
4. φ (e) = e1 where e and e1 are the identities of R and Q respectively.  
 
The kernel of the SNP-ring homomorphism and the concept of isomorphism are 
defined as for in case of rings.  
 
PROBLEMS:

Chapter Four 
 
SMARANDACHE NEAR-RINGS 
 
 
In this chapter we introduce the concept of Smarandache near-rings (S-near-ring) and 
introduce several of the properties in near-rings to the S-near-rings. The study of S-
near-rings is very recent [99]. The near-rings introduced in this chapter will be called 
as S-near-rings of level I. S-near-rings of level II will also be introduced in the next 
chapter. Throughout this chapter by a S-near-ring we mean only S-near-rings of level 
I. All near rings and S-near rings in this book will only be right near-rings. This 
chapter has five sections. In section one we define S-near-rings and give examples; 
Smarandache N-groups are introduced in section two. In section three Smarandache 
direct product and Smarandache free near-rings defined and described. The concept of 
Smarandache ideals in near-rings is introduced in section four and in the final section 
we give the notion of S-idempotents and Smarandache modularity.  
 
 
4.1 Definition of S-near-ring with examples  
 
In this section we define S-near-rings, Smarandache subnear-rings and illustrate them 
with examples. We do not claim by any way that we have exhausted all Smarandache 
analogous for near-rings. The only aim of this book is to introduce S-near-rings and 
define some properties and leave the rest of the work for any innovative researcher/ 
student to pursue the research on Smarandache notions about near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 4.1.1: N is said to be a Smarandache near-ring (S-near-ring) if (N, +, .) 
is a near-ring and has a proper subset A such that (A, +, .) is a near-field.  
 
Example 4.1.1: Let Z2 = {0, 1} be the near-field. Take any group G such that Z2G is 
the group near-ring of the group G over the near-field Z2. Z2G is a S-near-ring as Z2 ⊂ 
Z2G and Z2 is a near-field.  
 
It is important to note that in case of S-near-rings we can get several or a new class of 
S-near-ring by using group near-rings and semigroup near-rings using basically the 
near-field Z2 or any Zp.  
 
Example 4.1.2: Let Z2 = {0, 1} be a near-field and S(n) any symmetric semigroup. 
The semigroup near-ring Z2S(n) is a S-near-ring. This S-near-ring can be of any order 
finite or infinite depending on the order of the group or the semigroup which is used. 
Similarly they can be commutative or non-commutative which depends basically on 
the groups and semigroups.  
 
DEFINITION 4.1.2: Let (N, +, .) be a S-near-ring. A non-empty proper subset T of N is 
said to be a Smarandache subnear-ring (S-subnear ring) if (T, +, .) is a S-near-ring; 
i.e. T has a proper subset which is a nearfield. 
  

 
68 
Example 4.1.3: Let Z2 be the near-field. Sn be the symmetric group of degree n. Z2Sn 
is the group near-ring. Clearly Z2H is a S-subnear ring where

is a subgroup of Sn and Z2 ⊂ Z2 H. Hence the claim.  
 
Example 4.1.4: Let M3×3 = {(aij) / aij ∈ Z2 = {0, 1} the near-field} be the collection of 
all 3 × 3 matrices. M3×3 under the usual matrix addition, and multiplication defined as 
from Z2 makes M3×3 a near-ring which is also a S-near-ring. This has also S-subnear-
rings which are nontrivial.  
 
Example 4.1.5: Z2 be the near-field. Z2[x] is a S-near-field. By taking p(x).q(x) = p(x) 
for all p(x), q(x) ∈ Z2[x] we see (Z2[x], +, '.') is a S-near-ring. Z2[x] has nontrivial S-
subnear-rings.  
 
PROBLEMS: 
 
1. Find a S-near-ring of order 32.  
2. Does their exist a S-near-ring of order 17? Justify your answer.  
3. Is the group near-ring Z2G where Z2 is a near-field and G = 〈g / g8 = 1〉, a S-near-
ring? 
4. Does there exist at least two nontrivial S-subnear-rings of the near-ring given in 
problem 3? 
5. Let M4×4 = {(aij) / aij ∈ Z2 – Z2 a near-field} prove M4×4 is a S-near-ring. Find a S-
subnear-ring in M4×4. What is the order of M4×4?  
6. Prove S = Z2 × Z2 is a S-near-ring where Z2 is the near-field. Can Z2 × Z2 have S-
subnear-rings?  
7. Let Zn = {0, 1, 2, …, n-1}, (Zn, +) is a group and define product '.' as a.b = a for all 
a, b ∈ Zn. Is (Zn, +, .) a S-near-ring?  
 
 
4.2 Smarandache N-groups  
 
In this section we introduce a concept analogous to N-groups in a near-ring the 
Smarandache N-groups (S-N-groups). We define and illustrate them with examples 
and proceed onto define S-ideals of a near-ring and Smarandache homomorphism (S-
homomorphism) of near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 4.2.1: Let (P, +) be a S-semigroup with zero 0 and let N be a S-near-ring. 
Let µ : N × Y → Y where Y is a proper subset of P which is a group under the 
operations of P. (P, µ) is called the Smarandache N-group (S-N-group) if for all y ∈ Y 
and for all n, n1 ∈ N we have (n + n1) y = ny + n1y and (nn1) y = n(n, y). S (Np) 
stands for S-N-groups.

DEFINITION 4.2.2: A S-semigroup M of a near-ring N is called a Smarandache-quasi 
subnear-ring (S-quasi subnear-ring) of N if X ⊂ M where X is a subgroup of M which 
is such that X.X ⊆ X.  
 
THEOREM 4.2.1: If N has a S-quasi subnear-ring then N has a subnear-ring.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definitions of these concepts.  
 
It is noteworthy to state that the existence of a subnear-ring in a near-ring need not in 
general be a S-quasi subnear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 4.2.3: A S-subsemigroup Y of S(NP) with NY ⊂ Y is said to be a 
Smarandache N-subgroup (S-N-subgroup) of P.  
 
DEFINITION 4.2.4: Let N and N1 be two S-near-rings. P and P1 be S-N-subgroups.  
 
a. h : N → N1 is called a Smarandache near-ring homomorphism (S-near-ring 
homomorphism) if for all m, n ∈ M (M is a proper subset of N which is a near-
field) we have  
 
h (m + n) = h(m) + h(n),  
h (mn) = h(m) h(n) where h (m) and  
 
h (n) ∈ M1 (M1 is a proper subset of N1 which is a near-field).It is to be noted that 
h need not even be defined on whole of N.  
 
b. h : P → P1 is called the Smarandache N-subgroup-homomorphism (S-N-
subgroup-homomorphism) if for all p, q in S (S the proper subset of P which is a 
S-N-subgroup of the S-semigroup P) and for all m ∈ M ⊂ N (M a subfield of N) h 
(p + q) = h (p) + h (q)  and h (mp) = mh (p); h(p), h(q) and mh(p) ∈ S1 (S1 a 
proper subset of P1 which is a S-N1 subgroup of S-semigroup P1). 
  
Here also we do not demand h to be defined on whole of P.  
 
DEFINITION 4.2.5: Let N be a S-near-ring. A normal subgroup I of (N, +) is called a 
Smarandache ideal (S-ideal) of N related to X if  
 
a. IX ⊆ I. 
b. ∀ x, y ∈ X and for all i ∈ I; x (y + i) – xy ∈ I,  
 
where X is the near-field contained in N.  
 
A subgroup may or may not be a S-ideal related to all near-fields. Thus while defining 
S-ideal it is important to mention the related near-field.  
 
Normal subgroup T of (N, +) with (a) is called S-right ideals of N related to X while 
normal subgroups L of (N, +) with (b) are called S-left ideals of N related to X.  
 

 
70 
DEFINITION 4.2.6: A proper subset S of P is called a Smarandache ideal of S(Np) (S-
ideal of S(N)P) related to Y if  
 
1. S is a S-normal subgroup of the S-semigroup P.  
2. For all s1 ∈ S and s ∈ Y (Y is the subgroup of P) and for all m ∈ M (M the 
near-field of N)  
n ( s + s1) – ns ∈ S.  
 
A S-near ring is Smarandache simple (S-simple) if it has no S-ideals. S(Np) is called 
Smarandache N-simple (S-N-simple) if it has no S-normal subgroups except 0 and P.  
 
DEFINITION 4.2.7: A S-subnear-ring M of a near-ring N is called Smarandache 
invariant (S-invariant) related to the near-field X in N if M X ⊂ M and X M ⊂ M 
where X is a S-near-field of N. Thus in case of Smarandache invariance it is only a 
relative concept as a S-subnear ring M may not be invariant related to every near-
fields in the near-ring N.  
 
DEFINITION 4.2.8: Let X and Y be S-semigroups of S(NP). (X:Y) = {n ∈ M / nY ⊂ X} 
where M is a near-field contained in N. (0, x) is called the Smarandache annihilator 
(S-annihilator) of X.  
 
PROBLEMS: 
 
1. Is the near-ring Zn under usual addition and multiplication defined by m.p = m for 
all m, p ∈ Zn.  
a. A-S-near-ring? 
b. Does Zn have S-quasi subnear-ring?  
c. Find the S-N-subgroup for Zn.  
2. Find the order of the smallest S-near-ring (It is well known Z2 is the smallest near-
ring).

4.3 Smarandache direct product and Smarandache free near-rings  
 
In this section we define Smarandache direct product (S-direct product) of near-rings 
and introduce the concept of Smarandache free near rings (S-free near rings) and 
several related concepts are defined and it is left for the reader to develop more results 
and theorems based on these definitions. 
 
DEFINITION 4.3.1: Let {Ni} be a family of near-rings which has at least one S-near-
ring. Then this direct product N1 × … × Nr = 
i
I
i
N
X
∈
with component wise defined 
operations ‘+’ and ‘.’ is called Smarandache direct product (S-direct product) of 
near-rings.  
 

 
71 
THEOREM 4.3.1: The S-direct product of near ring is a S-near-ring.  
 
Proof: Follows from the fact in the product at least one of the Ni is a S-near-ring.  
 
Example 4.3.1: Let N = Z2 × Z × Z3 × Z7 be the S-direct product of near-rings. N is a 
S-near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 4.3.2: The S-subnear-ring of the S-direct product 
i
I
i
N
X
∈
 consisting of 
those elements where all components except a finite number; equal to zero, is called 
the Smarandache (external) direct sum (S-direct sum) 
i
I
i
N
∈⊕
 of the Ni’s.  
 
More generally every S-subnear-ring N of 
i
I
i
N
X
∈
 where all projection maps πI (i ∈ I) 
are surjective (in other words for all i ∈ I and for all ni ∈ Ni: ni is the ith component of 
some element of N) is called the Smarandache subdirect product (S-subdirect product) 
of the Ni’s.  
 
Note we would be defining Smarandache mixed direct product of near-rings which 
will be different from these; as the sole motivation of defining Smarandache mixed 
direct product is to define Smarandache near-rings of several levels.  
 
THEOREM 4.3.2: If N = ⊕ Ni is the S-external direct sum of near-rings then N is a S-
near-ring.  
 
Proof: Follows from the very definition of S-external direct sum.  
 
DEFINITION 4.3.3: Let N be a near-ring and S a S-subsemigroup of (N, +). The near-
ring Ns is called the Smarandache-near-ring of left (right) quotients (S-near-ring of 
left (right) quotients) of N with respect to S if  
 
a. Ns has identity.  
b. N is embeddable in Ns, by a homomorphism h.  
c. For all s ∈ S; h(s) is invertible in (Ns, .).  
d. For all q ∈ Ns, there exists s ∈ S and there exist n ∈ N such that q = h(n) 
h(s)-1 (q = h(s)-1 h(n)).  
 
The problem whether Ns is a S-near-ring is left as an open problem.  
 
DEFINITION 4.3.4: The near-ring N is said to fulfil the Smarandache left (right) ore 
conditions (S-left(right) ore condition) (ore (1)) with respect to a given S-
subsemigroup P of (N, .) if for (s, n) ∈ S × N there exists ns1 = sn1 (s1n = n1s).  
 
THEOREM 4.3.3: If a near-ring N satisfies S-left (right) ore condition with respect to 
S-subsemigroup P then the near-ring N fulfils left (right) ore condition (ore (1)) with 
respect to a given subsemigroup P of (N, .). 
 

 
72 
Proof: Obvious by the very definitions. The reader is advised to find an example of 
near-ring N which fulfills left (right) ore condition (ore (1)) with respect to 
subsemigroup P of (N, .) but does not satisfy S-left (right) ore condition.  
 
DEFINITION 4.3.5: If S = {s ∈ N / s is cancellable}, the NS if it exists and if NS is a S-
near-ring then Ns is called the Smarandache left (right) quotient (S-left(right) 
quotient) near-ring of N.  
 
THEOREM 4.3.4: If NS is a S-quotient near-ring then NS is a quotient near-ring.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition.  
 
It is once again an interesting problem to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition 
for a left (right) quotient near-ring N to be a S-quotient near-ring.  
Let S(V) denote the collection of all S-near-rings and X be any nonempty subset 
which is S-semigroup under ‘+’ or ‘.’.  
 
We define Smarandache free near-ring as follows.  
 
DEFINITION 4.3.6: A S-near-ring Fx ∈ S(V) is called a Smarandache free near-ring 
(S-free near ring) in V over X if there exist f : X → F for all N ∈ V and for all g : X → 
N there exists a S-near-ring homomorphism h ∈ S (Hom Fx, N) [Here S (Hom (Fx, N)) 
denotes the collection of S-homomorphism form Fx to N] such that h o f = g.  
 
THEOREM 4.3.5: Let Fx be a S-free near-ring then Fx is a free near-ring.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition.  
 
PROBLEMS: 
  
1. Give an example of a near-ring which is not a S-near-ring.  
2. Is N = Z5 × Z7 × Z3 a S-direct product? Justify your answer.  
3. Prove N = Z2 × Z is a S-direct product.  
4. Is Z2 = {0, 1} a S-near-ring?  
5. Let N = Z2 × Z12? Choose S = Z2 × {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10} which is a S-subsemigroup 
of (N, +). Find NS.  
6. Is Ns given in problem 5 a S-near-ring?  
7. Give an example of a S-free near-ring.  
 
 
4.4 Smarandache ideals in Near-rings  
 
In this section we introduce the notion of Smarandache internal direct sum, 
Smarandache normal sequence, Smarandache prime ideal, Smarandache semiprime 
ideal and the concept of Smarandache nilpotent elements and Smarandache nilpotent 
ideals in a near-ring. We illustrate this by examples and give some interesting related 
results, we propose several problems as we except the reader to get involved in this 
Smarandache concepts about near-rings.

 is called the Smarandache internal direct sum (S-internal 
direct sum) if each element of ΣSk has a unique representation as a finite sum of 
elements for different Sk’s.  
 
THEOREM 4.4.1: If the near-ring has S-internal direct sum then it has internal direct 
sum.  
 
Proof: Follows by the very definition of the two concepts.  
 
DEFINITION 4.4.2: Let I be an S-ideal of the near-ring N. I is called a Smarandache 
direct summand (S-direct summand) of N if there exists an ideal J such that N = I + J. 
I is called a Smarandache strong direct summand (S-strong direct summand) of N if 
there exists a S-ideal J such that N = I +  J.  
 
THEOREM 4.4.2: If the S-ideal I of N is a S-strong direct summand then it is a S-direct 
summand.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader as an exercise.  
 
THEOREM 4.4.3: If the S-ideal I of N is a S-strong direct summand or S-direct 
summand then obviously I is a direct summand.  
 
Proof: The reader is requested to prove using the definitions.  
 
DEFINITION 4.4.3: A finite sequence N = N0 ⊃ N1 ⊃ N2 ⊃ … ⊃ Nn = {0}of S-subnear-
rings Ni of N is called a Smarandache normal sequence (S-normal sequence) of N if 
and only if for all i ∈ {1, 2, …, n}, Ni is an S-ideal of Ni-1. In the special case that all 
Ni is an S-ideal of N then we call the normal sequence an Smarandache invariant 
sequence; (S-invariant sequence) and n is called the Smarandache length (S-length) 
of the sequence and Ni-1 / Ni are called the Smarandache factors (S-factors) of the 
sequence.  
 
DEFINITION 4.4.4: Let N be a near-ring. N is called Smarandache decomposable (S-
decomposable) if it is the direct sum of nontrivial S-ideals or if it has nontrivial direct 
summand. Otherwise it is S-indecomposable. Thus even if it is indecomposable yet not 
as S-ideals then it is still S-indecomposable.  
 
DEFINITION 4.4.5: Let P be a S-ideal of the near-ring N. P is called Smarandache 
prime ideal (S-prime ideal) if for all S-ideals I and J of N, IJ ⊆ P implies I ⊂ P or J ⊂ 
P.  
 
THEOREM 4.4.4: Let N be a near-ring if P is a S-prime ideal then P is a prime ideal.  
 
Proof: Easily proved.  
 
If P is not in general a S-prime ideal even if P is a prime ideal. The study of finding 
these would be an interesting problem.  

 
74 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.6: Let P be an S-ideal in N, P is Smarandache semiprime (S-
semiprime) if and only if for all S-ideals I of N I2 ⊂ P implies I ⊂ P.  
 
DEFINITION 4.4.7: Let I be a S-ideal of N; the Smarandache prime radical (S-prime 
radical) of I denoted by S (P (I)) = ∩

has prime radical.  
 
DEFINITION 4.4.8: Let N be a near-ring. A nilpotent element 0 ≠ x ∈ N is said to be a 
Smarandache nilpotent element (S-nilpotent element) if xn= 0 and there exists y ∈ R \ 
{0, x} such that xr y = 0 or yxr = 0, r, s, > 0 and ym ≠ 0 for an integer m > 1.  
 
THEOREM 4.4.5: Let N be a near-ring 0 ≠ x ∈ N is S-nilpotent then x is nilpotent.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition.  
 
DEFINITION 4.4.9: Let S be a S-ideal we say S ⊂ N is nilpotent if Sk = {0}. S ⊂ N is 
called Smarandache nil (S-nil) if for all s ∈ S, s is S-nilpotent.

4.5 Smarandache Modularity in near-rings  
 
In this section we introduce the concept of Smarandache idempotents (S-idempotents) 
as this is the basic notion needed for the definition of Smarandache modular ideals 
and other related concepts. Using the concept of S-idempotents we develop 
Smarandache biregular and Smarandache prime radical and obtain some interesting 
results about them.  
 

 
75 
DEFINITION 4.5.1: Let N be a near-ring. An element 0 ≠ x ∈ N is a Smarandache 
idempotent (S-idempotent) of R if  
 
a. x2 = x. 
b. There exist a ∈ N \ {x, 1, 0} (if N has 1). With  
 
 
1. a2 = x and  
2. xa = a (ax = a) or ax = x (xa = x)  
 
or in (b,2) is in the mutually exclusive sense.  
 
The element a ∈ N is called the Smarandache co-idempotent (S-co-idempotent).  
 
DEFINITION 4.5.2: Let P be a S-left ideal of a near ring N. P is called Smarandache 
modular (S-modular) if and only if there exists a S-idempotent e ∈ N and for all n ∈ 
N; n – ne ∈ P.  
 
In this case we also say that P is S-modular by e and e is right identity modulo P since 
for all n ∈ N, ne = n (mod p). 
 
THEOREM 4.5.1: Let N be a near-ring. If x ∈ N is a S-idempotent then x is an 
idempotent.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition of these concepts.

Chapter Five 
 
SPECIAL PROPERTIES OF 
CLASSES OF SMARANDACHE 
NEAR-RINGS AND ITS 
GENERALIZATIONS 
 
 
In this chapter we introduce several new classes of Smarandache near-rings and their 
generalizations; all new concepts in near-rings and seminear-rings are introduced to S-
near-rings and S-seminear-rings. This chapter has five sections. In section one we 
introduce five types of Smarandache mixed direct products which will pave way for 
several types of S-near-rings and S-seminear-rings. Section two is used to define 
special classes of S-near-rings like S-IFP near-ring etc. The study of Smarandache 
group near-rings is introduced in section three, section four studies S-seminear-ring 
and their generalizations. The final section is devoted to the study of special 
properties in S-near-rings.  
 
 
5.1 Smarandache mixed direct product of near-rings and seminear rings 
 
This section is completely devoted to the introduction of Smarandache mixed direct 
product of near-rings. Only by defining these Smarandache mixed direct product we 
are able to define several levels of S-near rings and S-seminear-rings and S-quasi 
seminear-rings. We illustrate them with examples and denote how each of these S-
mixed products yield different levels of S-near-rings and S-seminear-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 5.1.1: Let N = N1 × N2 × … × Nn be the Smarandache mixed direct 
product I (S-mixed direct product I) of seminear-rings and near-rings where Ni 's are 
from the classes of near-rings and seminear-rings which we call as S-mixed direct 
product I.  
 
The use of S-mixed direct product I is two-fold.  
 
THEOREM 5.1.1: Let N = N1 × N2 × … × Nn be S-mixed direct product I, then N is a S-
seminear-ring.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition.  
 
THEOREM 5.1.2: Let N = N1 × … × Nr be S-mixed direct product I, then N has S-
subnear-rings and S-ideals.  
 
Proof: Direct by using definitions.  
 

 
78 
DEFINITION 5.1.2: Let N = N1 × N2 × … × Nr where some Ni's are near-rings and 
some of them are near-fields. Then this Smarandache mixed direct product of near-
rings is called S-mixed direct product II.  
 
It is easily verified that S-mixed direct product II gives S-near-rings. Further these S-
mixed direct product II when r > 2 can give S-subnear-rings. It is also useful in 
getting S-N groups. It paves way for S-quasi subnear-rings.  
 
It is also useful to define notions like S-invariant subnear-rings related to near-field as 
we can take in the S-mixed direct product II more than one near-field. It is pertinent to 
mention here that S-mixed direct product near-rings I and II are entirely different from 
S-direct product of near-rings. Thus we can say a S-mixed direct product of near-rings 
is a S-direct product if and only if one of the Ni is a S-near-ring.  
 
Thus if we assume none of the Ni is a S-near-ring then certainly the S-mixed direct 
product I or II is a S-near ring but the product is never a S-direct product of near-
rings. But they are S-near-rings or S-seminear-ring but they are different in their own 
ways. Now we call these S-near-rings and S-seminear-rings as level I. Now we 
proceed on to define Smarandache near-rings and Smarandache seminear-rings of 
level II.  
 
DEFINITION 5.1.3: Let N = N1 × … × Nr be the Smarandache mixed direct product III 
(S-mixed direct product III) of near-rings and rings i.e. some of the Ni's are rings and 
certainly some Nj's are near-rings. N is not a S-near-ring unless one of the Ni's is a 
near-field.  
 
We now define Smarandache near-ring of level II.  
 
DEFINITION 5.1.4: Let N be a near-ring. N is said to be a Smarandache near-ring of 
level II (S-near-ring II) if N has proper subset P, P ⊂ N where P is a ring.  
 
Thus we see S-mixed direct product II is always a S-near-ring II. We see only by this 
we can get S-near-ring II for it is not easy to obtain subset in a near-rings which are 
rings. We see S-near-ring I and S-near-ring II are in general not related; they happen 
to be two distinct classes.  
 
DEFINITION 5.1.5: Let N = N1 × … × Nt where some of the Ni's are the seminear-ring 
and some of them are semirings then N is called the Smarandache mixed direct 
product IV (S-mixed direct product IV) of seminear-rings.  
 
The S-mixed direct product IV paves way for the following definition.  
 
DEFINITION 5.1.6: Let N be a seminear-ring. N is said to be a Smarandache 
seminear-ring of level II (S-seminear-ring of level II) if N contains a proper subset P 
which is a semiring. Clearly the S-mixed direct product IV gives S-seminear-ring II.  
 
Here also we wish to state that by no means in general S-seminear-ring I and S-
seminear-ring II are related in fact they are disjoint notions but not totally disjoint 
which is seen by the following example.   

 
79 
Example 5.1.1: Let N = Zo × Z15 where Zo = Z+ ∪ {0} is a semiring under usual '+' 
and '.'. (Z15 , '×', '.') is a seminear-ring. Clearly N is a S-seminear-ring II. This is also a 
S-seminear-ring I as Z15 has a proper subset P where P is a near-ring.  
 
Thus we cannot say in general that a S-seminear-ring I is never a S-seminear-ring II.  
 
To obtain a Smarandache pseudo seminear-ring we are not in any position to construct 
S-mixed direct products. It is interesting to note that in case of non-associative near-
rings (NA-near-rings) and non-associative seminear-rings (NA-seminear-rings) every 
S-mixed direct product of various types helps us to build S-NA-seminear-rings and S-
NA-near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 5.1.7: Let N = N1 × N2 × … × Nn be the Smarandache mixed direct 
product V (S-mixed direct product V) of non-associative seminear-rings, rings and 
non-associative near-rings. Clearly N is a S-quasi near-ring.  
 
Thus using this S-mixed direct product V we get a class of S-quasi near-rings. If we 
include semirings in the S-mixed direct product we can get S-quasi seminear-rings.  
 
Thus whenever we need these S-mixed direct products we would be using them, but 
what is more important is that we are not able to construct by any natural means NA-
near-ring or NA-seminear-rings. The only way is that we get NA-near-rings and NA-
seminear-rings by building near loop-rings and groupoid near-rings, loop seminear-
rings and groupoid seminear-rings.

5.2 Special Classes of Smarandache near-rings 
 
In this section we introduce some basic well-known classes of near-rings which are S-
near-rings. We do not claim to give all the results pertaining to them. We provide only 
the main definitions and leave the rest for the reader to develop. Concepts like S-IFP, 
S-n-ideal near-rings, S-LSD near-rings and S-equiprime near-rings are introduced.  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.1: Let N be a S-near-ring. N is said to fulfil the Smarandache 
insertion of factors property (S-IFP for short) if for all a, b ∈ N we have a.b = 0 
implies anb = 0 for all n ∈ P, P ⊂ N, where P is a near-field.  
 
We say N has S-strong IFP property if every homomorphic image of N has the IFP 
property or we redefine this as:  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.2: Let N be a S-near-ring and I a S-ideal of N. N is said to fulfil 
Smarandache strong IFP property (S-strong IFP property) if and only if for all a, b ∈ 
N, ab ∈ I implies anb ∈ I where n ∈ P, P ⊂ N and P is a near-field.  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.3: Let p be a prime. A S-near-ring N is called a Smarandache p-near-
ring (S-p-near-ring) provided for all x ∈ P, xp = x and px = 0, where P ⊂ N and P is a 
semifield. Clearly if N is itself a p-near-ring and N is a S-near-ring then N will 
trivially be a S-p-near-ring. Conversely if N is a S-p-near-ring N in general need not 
be a S-p-near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.4: Let N be a near-ring. A S-right ideal I of N is called Smarandache 
right quasi reflexive (S-right quasi reflexive) if whenever A and B are S-ideals of N 
with AB ⊂ I, then b(b' + a) – bb' ∈ I for all a ∈ A and for all b, b' ∈ B.  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.5: Let N be a near-ring. N is said to be Smarandache strongly 
subcommutative (S-strongly subcommutative) if every S-right ideal of it is S-right 
quasi reflexive. 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.6: Let N be a near-ring. S a S-subnormal subgroup of (N, +). S is 
called a Smarandache quasi-ideal (S-quasi ideal) of N if SN ⊂ N and NS ⊂ S where 
by NS we mean elements of the form {n(n' + s) – nn'/ for all s ∈ S and for all n, n' ∈ 
N} = NS.  

 
81 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.7: A left-near-ring N is said to be Smarandache left-self-distributive 
(S-left self distributive) if the identity abc = abac is satisfied for a, b, c ∈ A, A ⊂ N 
and A is a S-subnear-ring of N.  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.8: Let N be a near-ring. N is said to be Smarandache left permutable 
(S-left permutable) if abc  = bac for all a, b, c ∈ A, A a subnear-ring of N.  
 
The near-ring N is said to be Smarandache right permutable (S-right permutable) if 
abc = acb for all a, b, c ∈ A; A ⊂ N, A a subnear-ring of N. The near-ring N is said to 
be Smarandache medial (S-medial) if abcd = acbd for all a, b, c, d in A where A is a 
S-subnear-ring of N.  
 
The near-ring N is said to be Smarandache right self-distributive (S-right self 
distributive) if abc = acbc for all a, b, c in A, A a S-subnear-ring of N.  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.9: Let (R, +, .) be a S-ring and M a S-right R-module. Let W = R × M 
and define (α, s)  (β, t) = (αβ, sβ + t). Then (W, +, ) is a S-left near-ring, the 
abstract Smarandache affine near-ring (S-affine near-ring) inducted by R and M. If R 
is S-right self-distributive and MR2 = 0 then W is a S-right self-distributive near-ring. 
If MR = 0 and R is S-medial, S-left permutable or S-left self-distributive then (W, ) 
is S-meidal, S-left permutable or S-left self-distributive respectively. 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.10: Let R be a S-near-ring. R is said to be Smarandache equiprime 
(S-equiprime) if for all 0 ≠ a ∈ P ⊂ R. P the near-field in R and for x, y ∈ R, arx = 
ary for all r ∈ R implies x = y. If B is a S-ideal of R, B is called a Smarandache 
equiprime ideal (S-equiprime ideal) if R/B is an S-equiprime near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.11: Let (N, +, .) be a triple. N is said to be a Smarandache infra-
near-ring (S-INR) where  
 
1. (S, +) is a S-semigroup. 
2. (N, .) is a semigroup. 
3. (x + y)z = xz – 0z + yz for all x, y, z ∈ N.  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.12: Let I be a S-left ideal of N. Suppose I satisfies the following 
conditions: 
  
1. a, x, y ∈ N, anx – any ∈ I for all n ∈ N implies x – y ∈ I.  
2. I is left invariant. 
3. 0N ⊂ I. 
 
Then I is called a Smarandache equiprime left-ideal (S-equiprime left ideal) of N.  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.13: Let N be a S-near-ring. N is said to be Smarandache partially 
ordered (S-partially ordered) by ≤ if  
 
1. ≤ makes (N, +) into a partially ordered S-semigroup. 
2. for all n, n' ∈ N, n ≥ 0 and n' > 0 implies nn' ≥ 0. 

 
82 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.14: Let N be a near-ring. Let I1, I2, …, Im be the collection of all S-
right ideals of N. We say N is a Smarandache n-ideal near-ring (S-n-ideal near-ring) 
(n an integer less than or equal to m) if for every n, S-right ideals I1, …, In and for 
every n elements X1, X2, …, Xn in N \ (I1 ∪ I2 ∪ … ∪ In) we have 〈X1  ∪ I1 ∪ … ∪ In 〉 
= 〈X2 ∪ I1 ∪ … ∪ In 〉 = … = 〈Xn ∪ I1 ∪ … ∪ In〉 where 〈 〉 denotes the S-right ideal 
generated by Xi ∪ I1 ∪ … ∪ In ; 1 ≤ i ≤ n.  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.15: Let (M, +) be a S-semigroup (not necessarily abelian) and Γ a 
non-empty set. Then M is said to be a Smarandache Γ-near ring (S-Γ-near-ring) if 
there exists a mapping M × Γ × M → M the images (a, α, b) denoted by aαb 
satisfying the following conditions:  
 
1. (a + b)αc = aαc + bαc. 
2. (aαb)βc = aα(bβc)  
for all a, b, c ∈ M and α, β ∈ Γ.  
 
M is said to be Smarandache zero symmetric Γ-near-ring (S- zero symmetric Γ-near-
ring) if aα0 = 0 for all a ∈ M and α ∈ Γ where 0 denotes the additive identity in M. 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.16: Let M be a S-Γ-near-ring, then a S-normal subsemigroup I of (M, 
+) is called  
 
1. a S-left ideal if aα(b + i) - aαb ∈ I for all a, b ∈ M, α ∈ Γ and i ∈ I.  
2. a S-right ideal if i α a ∈ I for all a ∈ M, α ∈ Γand i ∈ I and  
3. a S-ideal if it is both S-left and S-right ideal.  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.17: An S-ideal A of M is said to be Smarandache prime (S-prime) if B 
and C are S-ideals of M such that BΓC ⊂ A implies B ⊆ A or C ⊆ A.  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.18: Let M1  and M2 be any two S-Γ-near-rings. A S-S-semigroup 
homomorphism f of (M1, +) into (M2, +) is called a Smarandache Γ-homomorphism 
(S-Γ-homomorphism) if Γ(xαy) = f(x) α f(y) for all x, y ∈ M and α ∈ Γ. We say f is a 
S-Γ-isomorphism if f is one to one and onto. For an S-ideal I of a S-Γ near-ring, the 
S-quotient Γ near-ring M/I is defined in a similar way as quotients are defined for any 
near-ring.  
 
Now several interesting Smarandache results can be obtained on S-Γ-near-rings. The 
reader is entrusted with that work. Now we proceed on to define the concept of 
Smarandache left-self-distributive near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.19: Let N be a near-ring. We say N is a Smarandache left self-
distributive near-ring (S-LSD near-ring) if N has a proper S-subnear-ring which is a 
LSD, we do not need the totality of the near-ring to be a LSD near-ring.  
 
THEOREM 5.2.1: If N is a LSD near-ring having a S-subnear-ring then N is a S-LSD 
near-ring.  
 

 
83 
Proof: Straightforward.  
 
Give an example of a LSD near-ring which is not a S-LSD near-ring. Also give an 
example of S-LSD near-ring which is not a LSD near-ring.

5.3 Smarandache Group near-rings and their generalization 
 
When the study of group rings is very vast with over a dozen texts on them we see 
group near-rings is very rare only less than half a dozen research papers and all the 
more the introduction of even semigroup near-rings is totally absent. But as we don’t 
have several classes or concrete examples of near-rings except those near-rings got 
from Zn or Z and some as group morphisms; the concept of group near-rings and the 
introduction of semigroup near-rings will certainly serve to provide us with a vast 
stretch of examples as both the algebraic structures groups and semigroups are very 
non-abstract with several concrete examples.  
 
Thus in this section we introduce the concept of Smarandache group near-rings and 
Smarandache semigroup near-rings and generalize them and built Smarandache group 
seminear-rings and Smarandache semigroup seminear-rings. We obtain several 
interesting and innovative illustrations and results and give four distinct classes of S-

 
84 
near-rings and S-seminear-rings. Several of the open problems about group rings are 
also reformulated in the case of group near-rings and semigroup near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 5.3.1: Let G be a group and N a S-near-ring. Then we define the group 
near- ring NS to be a Smarandache group near-ring (S-group near-ring).  
 
It is important to note that all group near-rings are not S-group near-rings. By an 
example we illustrate this.  
 
Example 5.3.1: Let Z2 = (0, 1) be the near-field and G = 〈g / g3 = 1〉. The group near-
ring Z2G is not a S-group near-ring.  
 
Thus we make it very clear that if N is not a S-near-ring but the group near-ring NG 
happens to be a S-near-ring still we do not call NS the S-group near-ring, we can say 
group near-ring is a S-near-ring. Thus we can redefine S-group near-ring NS as:  
 
DEFINITION 5.3.2: Let N be a near-ring and G any group. The group near-ring NS is 
a S-group near-ring if and only if N is a S-near-ring.  
 
Thus in this section we will be mainly interested in the study of S-group near-rings 
than the S-near-rings.  
 
THEOREM 5.3.1: Let NG be a S-group near-ring. Then NG has a S-subnear-ring.  
 
Proof: Since it is given N has a proper subset P which is a near-field we can take PG 
and PG ⊂ NG and P ⊂ PG so PG is a S-subnear-ring. Thus if NG is a S-group near-
ring we can always say NG contains a S-subnear-ring.  
 
Now the natural question would be if the group near-ring NG has a S-subnear-ring; 
can we say NG is a S-group near-ring? The answer to this question in general is true. 
For we may have a S-subnear-ring of NG got from a proper subset of NG and not of 
N so NG with the properties of G may yield a S-subnear-ring yet NG may fail to be a 
S-group near-ring.  
 
We just recall if G is a group, ∆ = ∆ (G) = {x ∈ G / [G : CG (x)] < ∞} since the 
conjugates of x are in one to one correspondence with the right cosets of CG(x), it 
follows that x has only finitely many conjugates if and only if x ∈ ∆. We observe ∆ is 
a normal subgroup of G. For clearly 1 ∈ ∆ and since CG (x –1) = CG(x) we see that x ∈ 
∆ implies x–1 ∈ ∆.  ∆ is called the finite conjugate subgroup of G. The importance of 
∆ is two fold. Firstly reduce the problem studied from NG to N∆ and second we are 
able to handle the much simpler group ∆.  
 
Clearly if NG is a S-group near-ring we see N∆ is also a S-group near-ring. But N∆ ⊆ 
NG. Let θ denote the projection.

85 
a. Suppose A and B be S-ideals of NG; then can we say θ(A) is a S-ideal of 
N∆?  
b. If A ≠ 0 can we say θ (A) ≠ 0 and conversely?  
c. Can we prove if AB = 0 then it implies that θ (A) θ(B) = 0?  
 
The above 3 questions are left for the reader to settle.  
 
The next natural question would be if N is any near-field and G a torsion free abelian 
group can NG have zero divisors or suppose if H is a torsion free abelian subgroup of 
G, G any group can we say if α ∈ NH ⊂ NG with α ≠ 0 then α is not a zero divisor of 
NG? The study of these problems is related to the zero divisor problem for group 
rings, here we have only changed rings to near-rings.  
 
Now we go for the introduction of the several of the properties enjoyed by group rings 
to group near-rings.  
 
Now let M ⊂ N be a near-field in the near-ring N and G any group. Let MG be the 
subgroup near-ring of the S-group near-ring NG. Prove or disprove MG is prime if 
and only if ∆(G) is torsion free abelian. Yet another important question is can we say 
for any finite group G the S-group near-ring NG is artirian? This study is also 
dormant, a host of research can be done in this direction also. Another important study 
is if NG is a S-group near-ring, G a finite group; will NG satisfy N-artirian condition? 
To this end we introduce the S-artirian condition for S-near-rings N.  
 
DEFINITION 5.3.3: Let N be a near-ring. If the S-ideals of the near-ring N fulfils 
D.C.C conditions then we say N satisfies Smarandache DCC (S-DCC) conditions.  
 
If the S-ideal of a near-ring N satisfies ACC condition then we say N satisfies 
Smarandache ACC (S-ACC) condition. If SDCC is satisfied by S-left ideals we 
distinguish it by S-DCC L. Similarly in case of S-right ideals we denote it by S-DCC 
R. If we have collection of S-N-subsemigroups of a near-ring N and if it satisfies DCC 
or ACC we denote it by S DCC N or S ACC N.  
 
Thus if N is a near-field and G a finite group will the group near-ring NG satisfy 
 
1. S-DCC R or  
2. S-DCC N or  
3. S-DCC L or  
4. S-ACC R or  
5. S-ACC L or 
6. S-ACC N.  
 
This study is important and may yield a lot of results. For example if we take the near-
ring to be the near-field Z2 and G a solvable group Z2G; the group near-ring will 
satisfy several of the conditions mentioned. Finally as the study in this direction is 
totally absent by researchers it may give any researcher a lot of scope for research in 
this direction.  
 

 
86 
We recall if N is a near-ring and P a S-prime ideal of N then N / P is a S-prime near-
ring, we will say the near-ring N is S-semiprime if and only if the intersection of all S-
prime ideals is 0.  
 
Now let G be any group and N a near-field. When will the group near-ring NG be S-
semiprime. This question too is not very simple it needs condition on N as well as G 
to be discussed. We have in case of group rings, KG is semiprime if K is a field of 
characteristic zero.  
 
Another natural question about group near-ring and S-group near-ring is: Will the 
group near-ring or S-group near-ring contain nil ideals. The problem in case of prime 
fields of characteristic p and when G has no elements of order p is dealt by [58]. They 
have proved KG the group ring has no nonzero nil ideals. This question in case of 
group near-rings remains as an open problem.  
 
The study of near-rings satisfying polynomial identity is a study in another direction 
as such study has never been contemplated even for near-rings we propose some 
problems in chapter X and accept our inability to discuss about it in this book. We 
now proceed on to define the concept of Smarandache near module. The near module 
is nothing but the N-group so the Smarandache near module is defined as the 
Smarandache N-subsemigroup. We end this study of group near-rings with  
 
1. When is the S-group near-ring NG, S-regular? 
2. When is the group near-ring regular?  
 
It is well known [58], the group ring KG is regular if and only if G is a locally finite 
group and has no elements of order p in case K has characteristic p > 0.  
 
Now we have already mentioned that the study of semigroup near-rings has not even 
started till date. Hence we in chapter 3 have mentioned some properties and have 
introduced the notion of semigroup near-rings. In this section we define Smarandache 
semigroup near-rings and indicate some more research in this direction.  
 
DEFINITION 5.3.4: Let N be a any near-ring and S a semigroup. The semigroup near-
ring NS is said to be a Smarandache semigroup near-ring (S-semigroup near-ring) if 
S is a S-semigroup.  
 
Now even if N is a S-near-ring and S is not a S-semigroup we call NS a semigroup 
near-ring which is a S-near-ring and it is not a S-semigroup near-ring. It is pertinent to 
mention here that the S-semigroup near-ring may not in general be a S-near-ring. 
Even if NS is a S-near-ring; NS need not be a S-semigroup near-ring.  
 
THEOREM 5.3.2: Let NS be a S-semigroup near-ring; then NS has a S-group near-
ring if and only if N is a S-near-ring.  
 
Proof: Given NS is a S-semigroup near-ring so S is a S-semigroup i.e. S has proper 
subset which is a subgroup say H. Now NH is a S-group near-ring if and only if N is a 
S-near-ring.  
 

 
87 
THEOREM 5.3.3: Let N be a S-near-ring and S a S-semigroup. The S-semigroup near-
ring NS has nontrivial S-subnear-rings.  
 
Proof: Obvious from the fact S is a S-semigroup so; G ⊂ S is a group; NG is a S-
subnear-ring of NS, hence the claim.  
 
Obtain any other interesting result about them.  
 
Example 5.3.2: Let Z2= {0, 1} be  a near-ring and S(n) be the S-semigroup. Z2S(n) is 
a S-semigroup near-ring. Find S-ideals in Z2S(n). Is Z2S(n) a S-near-ring? Find zero 
divisors if any in Z2S(n). Does Z2S(n) have S-zero divisor?

5.4 On a special class of Smarandache seminear-rings and their 
generalizations 
 
The study of seminear-rings is itself very meagre. With the well-known example of 
Zn, n a composite number where '×' is defined as usual multiplication on Zn modulo n 
and '.' defined a . b = a or a . b = 0 for all a, b ∈ Zn. Then {Zn, '×', .} becomes a 
seminear-ring. To obtain a nontrivial class of seminear-rings we have ventured to 
study group seminear-rings and semigroup seminear rings. Now here we proceed on 

 
88 
to study and define Smarandache seminear-rings (S-seminear-rings) and study them. 
The study or the definition of S-seminear-rings is given in [99].  
 
DEFINITION [99]: A non-empty set N is said to be a Smarandache seminear-ring (S-
seminear-ring) if (N, +, .) is a seminear-ring having a proper subset A, (A ⊂ N) such 
that A under the same operations of N is a near-ring, that is (A, +, .) is a near-ring.  
 
Example 5.4.1: Let Z10 = {0, 1, 2  ,…, 9}. (Z10, ×, .) is a seminear-ring. (Z10, ×, .) is a 
S-seminear-ring as A = {2, 4, 6, 8} is such that (A, ×, .) is a near-ring.  
 
Example 5.4.2: Let Z8 = {0, 1, 2, …, 7}. (Z8, '×', '.') is a seminear-ring. Clearly Z8 is 
also a S-seminear-ring as (A, ×, .) with A = (1, 3) is a near-ring.  
 
THEOREM 5.4.1: Let Zn = {0, 1, 2, …, n – 1}, n a composite number; (Zn, '×', .) is a S-
seminear-ring.  
 
Proof: For take A = {1, n – 1} ⊂ Zn then (A, ×, .) is a near-ring. We assume n is a 
composite number for otherwise if n is a prime (Zp, ×, .) itself is a near-ring as Zp \ 
{0} under '×' is a group.  
 
We have now seen only examples of S-seminear-rings N in which the semigroup (N, 
×) is a commutative semigroup. To obtain non-commutative S-seminear-ring we 
proceed on as follows:  
 
Example 5.4.3: Let (Z6, ×, .) be a seminear-ring and G any group. We see the group 
seminear-ring Z6G is a non-commutative seminear-ring provided G is taken to be non-
commutative group.  
 
Example 5.4.4: Let (Z4, ×, .) be a seminear-ring and G = S3. The group seminear-ring 
Z4S3 is a S-seminear-ring which is non-commutative. 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.1: Let G be any group, N a seminear-ring, the group seminear-ring, 
NG is a Smarandache group seminear-ring (S-group seminear-ring) if and only if N is 
a S-seminear-ring. Thus we define in this way. Suppose N is not a S-seminear-ring 
and G any group even if the group seminear-ring is a S-seminear-ring we still call it 
only as a S-seminear-ring and not as a S-group seminear-ring.  
 
We now proceed on to define yet another new class of seminear-rings viz. 
Smarandache semigroup seminear-rings. The concept of semigroup seminear-rings 
was introduced in Chapter 3. 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.2: Let N be a seminear-ring, and S a S-semigroup. We call the 
semigroup seminear-ring to be a Smarandache semigroup seminear-ring (S-
semigroup seminear-ring) thus we say NS the semigroup seminear-ring is a S-
semigroup seminear-ring if and only if the semigroup S is a S-semigroup.  
 
Here also we may or may not have the S-semigroup seminear-ring to be a S-seminear-
ring. If S is not a S-semigroup and N a seminear-ring even if the semigroup seminear-
ring NS, is a S-seminear-ring still we do not call NS a S-semigroup seminear-ring.  

 
89 
 
THEOREM 5.4.2: Let S be a semigroup with 1 and N a S-seminear-ring. Then the 
semigroup seminear-ring NS is a S-seminear-ring.  
 
Proof: Straightforward. Hence left for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 5.4.3: Let S be a S-semigroup and N a S-seminear-ring. The S-semigroup 
seminear-ring NS has subseminear-rings which are group seminear-rings and group 
near-rings.  
 
Proof: Follows from the very definition of these concepts.  
 
THEOREM 5.4.4: Let S be a S-semigroup, and N a S-seminear-ring. The S-semigroup 
seminear-ring. NS has nontrivial S-group seminear-rings.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definitions.  
  
THEOREM 5.4.5: Let N be a seminear-ring and S be S-semigroup having S-
subsemigroup. Then the semigroup seminear-ring NS has S-subseminear-ring.  
 
Proof: Straightforward by the definitions.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.3: Let N be a seminear-ring. If (N, +) has a S-normal subgroup then 
the seminear-ring N is said to have Smarandache normal subseminear-ring (S-normal 
subseminear-ring). 
 
Example 5.4.5: Can {Z10, '×', '.'} have S-normal subseminear-ring?  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.4: Let (N, +, .) be a seminear-ring. If in the S-semigroup (N, +) every 
proper subset (A, +) which is a group is commutative then we say the S-seminear-ring 
N is Smarandache commutative (S-commutative). Thus if (N, +, .) is commutative and 
if (N, +) is S-semigroup then trivially (N, +, .) is S-commutative. Secondly if (N, +, .) 
is S-commutative seminear-ring then N need not in general be commutative.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.5: Let (N, +, .) be a seminear-ring. If (N, +) is a S-semigroup and if 
N has at least one proper subset which is a subgroup that is commutative then we say 
the seminear-ring (N, +, .) is a Smarandache weakly commutative seminear-ring (S-
weakly commutative seminear-ring).  
 
THEOREM 5.4.6.: Let (N, +, .) be a seminear-ring which is S-commutative then N is S-
weakly commutative.  
 
Proof: Proof is direct and the reader is expected to prove.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.6: Let (N, +, . ) be a seminear-ring. (N, +) be a S-semigroup such 
that every proper subset A of N which is a group is a cyclic subgroup then we say the 
seminear-ring (N, +, .) is a Smarandache cyclic seminear-ring (S-cyclic seminear-
ring). In particular (N, +, .) has at least one proper subset which is a cyclic group, we 
call (N, +, .) a Smarandache weakly cyclic seminear-ring (S-weakly cyclic seminear-
ring).  

 
90 
 
The following theorem is an easy consequence of the definitions, hence left as an 
exercise for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 5.4.7: Let (N, +, .) be a S-cyclic seminear-ring then N is a S-weakly cyclic 
seminear-ring.  
 
The reader is requested to construct an example of a S-weakly cyclic seminear-ring 
which is not a S-cyclic seminear-ring. 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.7: Let N be any seminear-ring. If (N, +) has two subgroups say (A, +) 
and (A1, +) such that A and A1 are conjugate then we say the seminear-ring N is a 
Smarandache conjugate seminear-ring (S-conjugate seminear-ring).  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.8: Let N and N1 be any two S-seminear-rings. We say a map φ from N 
to 
N1 
is 
a 
Smarandache 
seminear-ring 
homomorphism 
(S-seminear-ring 
homomorphism) from A to A1 where A ⊂ N is a near-ring and A1 ⊂ N1 is a near-ring 
and φ(x + y) = φ(x) + φ(y), φ(xy) = φ(x)φ(y) where x, y ∈ A and φ(x), φ(y) ∈ A1 and it 
is true for all x, y ∈ A. We need not even have the map φ to be well-defined or even 
defined on the whole of N. The concept of Smarandache isomorphism (S-
isomorphism) etc. are defined in a similar way.  
 
Example 5.4.6: Let N = (Z12 , × , .) be a S-seminear-ring and N1 = (Z4 , ×, .) be a S-
seminear-ring φ : N to N1 is a S-seminear-ring isomorphism as φ: A → A1 is a near-
ring isomorphism, here A = {1, 11} and A1 = {1, 3}. Thus |N| = 12 and |N1| = 4, yet N 
and N1 are S-isomorphic under this φ. 
 
We define level II Smarandache seminear-rings as follows:  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.9: Let (N, +, .) be a seminear-ring. We say N is a Smarandache 
seminear-ring of level II (S-seminear-ring II) if N has a proper subset P where P is a 
semiring.  
 
Example 5.4.7: Let N = Z6 × Zo be the S-mixed direct product of the seminear-ring 
(Z6 , ×, .) and the semiring (Zo, +, .) where Zo = Z+ ∪ {0}. Clearly N is a seminear-
ring which is a S-seminear-ring II. 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.10: Let N be a S-seminear-ring II, we say N is a Smarandache strict 
seminear-ring (S-strict seminear-ring) if A is a strict semiring ( A ⊂ N and A is 
semiring). 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.11: Let N be a S-seminear-ring II we say N is a Smarandache 
commutative seminear-ring II (S-commutative seminear-ring II) if every proper subset 
A of N which is a semiring is a commutative semiring. If the S-seminear-ring II has at 
least one proper subset which is a semiring and is commutative we call the N a 
Smarandache weakly commutative seminear-ring II (S-weakly commutative seminear-
ring II). 
 

 
91 
DEFINITION 5.4.12: Let N and N1 be two S-seminear-ring II, we say a map φ : N to N1 
is a Smarandache seminear-ring homomorphism II (S-seminear-ring homomorphism 
II) if φ : A → A1 is a semiring homomorphism where A ⊂ N and A1 ⊂ N1 and A and A1 
are semirings.  
 
Example 5.4.8: Let N = Zo × Z12 × Z3 be the S-mixed direct product, where Zo is a 
semiring, Z12 a seminear-ring and Z3 a near-ring. Clearly N is a S-seminear-ring II 
and as well as S-seminear-ring I. Thus we see a seminear-ring can simultaneously be a 
S-seminear-ring I as well as S-seminear-ring II.  
 
Example 5.4.9: Let N = L × Z18 , S-mixed direct product of a semiring and seminear-
ring where L is a distributive lattice given by the following diagram.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clearly N is a seminear-ring which is a S-seminear-ring II. Thus we have also seen 
examples of S-seminear-rings II of finite order.  Now we proceed on to define the 
concept of Smarandache pseudo seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION [99]: N is said to be a Smarandache pseudo seminear-ring (S-pseudo 
seminear-ring) if N is a near-ring and has a proper subset A of N which is a 
seminear-ring under the operations of N.  
 
We cannot obtain several examples of S-pseudo near-rings by using the S-mixed 
direct product.  
 
Example 5.4.10: Let (Z, +, .) be a near-ring. Clearly (Z, +, .) is a S-pseudo seminear-
ring as (Zo, +, .) is a seminear-ring.  
 
Example 5.4.11: Let Mn×n = {(aij ) / aij ∈ Z, (Z, +, .) a near-ring}. Mn×n is a S-pseudo 
seminear-ring as Mn×n = {(aij )/ aij ∈ Zo = Z+ ∪ {0}} is a seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.13: Let N and N1 be the S-pseudo seminear-ring. A mapping φ : N → 
N1 is said to be a Smarandache pseudo seminear-ring homomorphism (S-pseudo 
seminear-ring homomorphism) if φ restricted from A to A1 is a seminear-ring 
homomorphism where A and A1 are proper subsets of N and N1 which are seminear-
rings. Thus φ need not even be defined on the whole of N.  
 
We define the concept of S-pseudo subseminear-ring and Smarandache pseudo ideals 
of a near-ring.

DEFINITION 5.4.14: Let N be a near-ring if N has a proper subset A which is a 
subnear-ring A and if A itself a S-pseudo seminear-ring then we say A is a 
Smarandache pseudo subseminear-ring (S-pseudo subseminear-ring).  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.15: Let N be a near-ring. A proper subset M of N is said to be a 
Smarandache pseudo ideal (S-pseudo ideal) if M is a S-ideal of the near-ring N.  
 
THEOREM 5.4.8: Let N be a near-ring. If N has a S-pseudo subseminear-ring then N 
is a S-pseudo seminear-ring.  
 
Proof: Straightforward by the very definitions.  
 
It is left for the reader to construct a S-pseudo seminear-rings which has no S-pseudo 
subseminear-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.16: Let N be a S-pseudo seminear-ring, if N has no proper S-pseudo 
subseminear-ring then we say N is a Smarandache pseudo simple seminear-ring (S-
pseudo simple seminear-ring).  
 
The reader is assigned the work of finding an example of a S-pseudo simple seminear-
ring.

5.5 Some special properties in S-near -rings 
 
In this section we introduce several interesting Smarandache properties in S-near-ring 
like Smarandache planar, Smarandache integral, Smarandache equiprime etc. we do 
not intend to give results or routine theorems for the reader but on the contrary expect 
the reader to work in these directions and develop effective theories and results on 
Smarandache notions.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.1: Let N be a near-ring, A a non-empty subset of a S-N-subgroup V. 
The S-N-subgroup H of V, Smarandache centralizes (S-centralizes) a if (h + u)a = ha 
+ ua for all h ∈ H    u ∈ A and a ∈ N.  

 
93 
 
THEOREM 5.5.1: If N is a near-ring and if a S-N-subgroup H of V, S-centralizes A 
then it centralizes A.  
 
Proof:  Direct by the very definition. It is left as an exercise for the reader to give an 
example of a N-subgroup which centralizes but does not S-centralize.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.2: A zero symmetric S-near-ring N is called Smarandache reliable (S-
reliable) if whenever θ : I → N is an epimorphism and I is a S-ideal of a S-near-ring 
A then for (x, y ∈ I and a ∈ A) x – y ∈ Ker θ implies ax – ay ∈ Ker θ.  
 
Construct an example of a S-reliable θ symmetric S-near-ring N.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.3: Let N be a S-near-ring we define a Smarandache equivalence 
relation (S-equivalence relation) on N by a ≡ b if and only if na = nb for all n ∈ P ⊂ 
N where P is a semifield in N. The near-ring N is called Smarandache planar (S-
planar) if there is more than three S-equivalence classes and every equation of the 
form xa = xb + c has unique solution x when a ≠ b.  
 
This S-planar near-ring will be utilized in Balanced Incomplete Block Designs 
(BIBD) of high efficiency and it has application in error correcting codes.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.4: A Smarandache I-E S-semigroup (S-IE-S-semigroup) A is a S-
semigroup which satisfies I (G) = E (G) (here G ⊂ A and G is a group of the S-
semigroup A) where I(G) is the S-near-ring generated by all inner automorphisms of 
G and E (G) is the S-near-ring generated by all the endomorphisms of G.  
 
THEOREM 5.5.2: If A is a S-semigroup which is S-I-E semigroup then A has a proper 
subset which is a I-E group and conversely if A is a semigroup which has a subgroup 
of G which is I-E group then A is a S-I-E semigroup.  
 
Proof: Straightforward, hence left for the reader to prove. Several interesting 
properties of these S-I-E semigroups can be derived.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.5: Let (G, +) be a S-semigroup written additively not necessarily 
abelian, with identity element denoted by 0. Let T ⊂ A \ {0} where (A, +) is the 
subgroup of the S-semigroup (G, +). Define Γ by a Γ  b = a if b ∈ T; a Γ  b = 0 if b ∉ 
T then (G, +, Γ ) is a Smarandache right zero symmetric near-ring (S-right zero 
symmetric near-ring).  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.6: Let N be a S-near-ring and let N0 be a subset of N such that N0 
generates B ⊂ N where B is the near-field of N and BN0 ⊂ N0. Suppose A0 is a subset 
of N0 such that BA0 ⊂ A0 and A0 N0 ⊂ A0, then A0 is called the Smarandache σ subset 
(S-σ-subset) of N and the S-subnear-ring generated by A0 is called a Smarandache σ 
subnear-ring (S-σ-subnear-ring) of N.  
 
A S-σ- subnear-ring E of N is called essential in N if 0 ≠ A is an ideal of N implies E 
∩ A ≠ 0.  
 

 
94 
Several interesting results can be developed in this direction using these two 
Smarandache concepts. It is left for the researchers to do research in this direction and 
obtain some interesting results about them.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.7: A subset S of a N-near-ring is called Smarandache integral (S-
integral) if S has no non-zero divisors of zero. If H is an S-integral subset of N with 
the further property that B2 ⊂ H where B ⊂ N is a near-field then N is said to be an 
Smarandache H integral near-ring (S-H-integral near-ring).  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.8: Let N be a S-right near-ring and G a S-N-semigroup; G is called 
Smarandache equiprime (S-equiprime) if PG ≠ 0, P0 = 0 (where P ⊂ N and P is a 
near-field) and if for each a ∈ P and g, g1 ∈ G with Ga ≠ 0, ang = ang1 for all n ∈ P 
implies g = g1.  
 
Thus the reader is to find some interesting relations between the S-equiprime ideals 
and S-equiprime N-semigroups.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.9: Let N be a S-right near-ring and A an S-ideal or a S-left ideal of N. 
We define 3 Smarandache properties in the following :  
 
i. 
A is S-equiprime if for any a, x, y ∈ P ⊂ N such that nx – any ∈ A for all n 
∈ P ⊂ N we have a ∈ P or x – y ∈ A. (P ⊂ N is a near-field).  
ii. 
A  is  Smarandache  strongly semiprime (S-strongly semiprime) if for  each  
a  ∈  N  \  A  there  exists  a  finite  subset  F  of  N  such  that if x, y ∈ F ⊂ 
N and afx – afy ∈ A for all f ∈ F then x – y ∈ A.  
iii. 
A is Smarandache completely equiprime (S-completely equiprime) if a ∈ 
P\ A and ax – ay ∈ A imply x – y ∈ A.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.10: A S-right near-ring N is a Smarandache left infra near-ring (S-
left infra near-ring) if (N, +, .) is a triple where N is a non-empty set and '+' and '.' 
are binary operations satisfying.  
 
1. (N, +) is a S-semigroup.  
2. (N, .) is a S-semigroup. 
3. For all x, y, z in N x . (y + z) = x . y – x . 0 + x . z. 
 
DEFINITION 5.5.11: A S-near-ring M which satisfies the property, A an S-ideal of B, B 
an S-ideal of N and B / A ≅ M implies,  A is an S-ideal of N for all S-near-rings N, and 
S-subnear-rings A and B of N are called Smarandache F-near-ring (S-F-near-ring).  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.12: A near-ring N is Smarandache left weakly regular (S-left weakly 
regular) if every x ∈ N is of the form x = ux for some u1 in the S-principal ideal 
generated by x and is S-left weakly regular if every a ∈ N is in the product of {Na} * 
{Na} = {finite sums Σ xk yk / xk, yk ∈ Na}. 
 
DEFINITION 5.5.13: A Smarandache composition near-ring (S-composition near-ring) 
is a quadruple {C, +, o, .} where (C, +, o) and (C, +, .) are S-near-rings such that (a . 
b) o c = (a o b) . c for all a, b, c ∈ C.  
 

 
95 
DEFINITION 5.5.14: A non-zero S-ideal H of G is said to be Smarandache uniform (S-
uniform) if for each pair of S-ideals K1 and K2 of G such that K1 ∩ K2 = (0), K1 ⊂ H, 
K2 ⊂ H implies K1 = (0) or K2 = (0).  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.15: An S-ideal H of G is said to have Smarandache finite Goldie 
dimension written as (S-FGD) if H does not contain an infinite number of non-zero S-
ideals of G whose sum is direct.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.16: Let G be a S-N subgroup with S-FGD then every non-zero ideal 
of G contains a S-uniform ideal.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.17: Let N be a S-near-ring an element a ∈ P is called Smarandache 
normal element (S-normal element) of N if aN = Na. If aN = Na for every a ∈ P then 
N is called a Smarandache normal near-ring (S-normal near-ring).  
 
Let Sn(N) denote the set of all S-normal elements of N. N is called a S-normal ring if 
and only if Sn (N) = P where P ⊂ N and P a near-field.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.18: Let N be a S-near-ring. A S-subnear-ring S of N is called S-
normal subnear-ring with respect to a non-empty subset T of N if ts = st for every t ∈ 
T. In particular we have nS = Sn for every n ∈ P ⊂ N we say S is a Smarandache 
normal subnear-ring (S-normal subnear-ring) of N.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.19: Let N be a S-near-ring ;  a S-subsemigroup S of N is called a 
Smarandache normal subsemigroup (S-normal subsemigroup) of S if nS = Sn for all n 
∈ P ⊂ N.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.20: Let N be a S-near-ring. A S-subnear-ring M of N is Smarandache 
invariant (S-invariant) with respect to an element a ∈ P \ M if aM ⊂ M and Ma ⊂ M. 
M is said to Smarandache strictly invariant (S-strictly invariant) with respect to a if 
aM = M and Ma = M.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.21: A commutative S-near-ring N with identity is called a 
Smarandache Marot near-ring (S-Marot near-ring) if each regular S-ideal of N is 
generated by regular elements where by regular S-ideal we mean an ideal with 
regular elements and the non-zero divisors of the near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.22: Let K and I be S-ideals of the S-N-subgroup G. K is said to be the 
Smarandache complement (S-complement) of I if the following two conditions hold 
good.  
 
1. K ∩ I = (0) and  
2. K1 is an S-ideal of G such that K ⊂ K1 then K1 ≠ K imply K1 ∩ I ≠ (0).  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.23:  
 
i. 
A subset S of the S-N-subsemigroup G is said to be Smarandache small (S-
small) in G if S + K = G where K is an S-ideal of G imply K = G.  
 

 
96 
ii. 
G is said to be Smarandache hollow (S-hollow) if every proper S-ideal of G is 
S-small in G and  
 
iii. 
G is said to have Smarandache finite spanning dimension (S-finite spanning 
dimension) if for any decreasing sequence of Smarandache NS-subsemigroups 
(S-NS-subsemigroups) X0 ⊃ X1 ⊃ X2 ⊃ … of G such that Xi is an S-ideal of Xi-1 
there exists an integer such that Xj is S-small in G for all j ≥ k.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.24: Suppose H and K be any two S-N-subsemigroup of G. Then K is 
said to be Smarandache supplement (S-supplement) for H if H + K = G and H + K1 ≠ 
G for any proper S-ideal K1 of K.  
 
Now we have just defined several of the Smarandache concepts in near-ring so that an 
interested researcher will develop them.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.25: Let N be a near-ring we say N is Smarandache ideally strong (S-
ideally strong) if for every S-subnear-ring of R is a S-ideal of R.  
 
DEFINITION 5.5.26: Let N be near-ring {Ik} be the collection of all S-ideal of R. R is 
said to be a Smarandache I* near-ring (S-I∗ near-ring) if for every pair of ideals. I1, 
I2 ∈ {Ik} we have for every x ∈ N \ {I1 ∪ I2} the S-ideal generated by x and I1 and x 
and I2 are equal i.e. 〈 x ∪ I1 〉 = 〈 x ∪ I2 〉 we can have several examples of these.

SMARANDACHE SEMINEAR-RINGS  
 
 
This chapter specially serves the purpose of introducing Smarandache notions on 
seminear-rings. We define two levels of Smarandache seminear-ring and study them. 
This chapter has five sections, in section one we define Smarandache seminear-rings 
of type I and study some of its properties. For these S-seminear-rings we define and 
study homomorphism and its ideals in section two. Section three is devoted to the 
introduction and study of Smarandache seminear-rings of level II. In section four we 
define Smarandache pseudo seminear-rings and study several of its Smarandache 
properties.  
 
In the final section we introduce two special classes of Smarandache seminear-rings 
using groups and semigroups. These definitions help us to find more and more new 
classes of S-seminear-rings. At the end of each section some problems are given for a 
reader to solve.  
 
 
6.1 Definition and properties of Smarandache seminear-rings.  
 
In this section we define a new concept called Smarandache seminear-rings (S-
seminear-rings) and define some interesting properties in them like Smarandache 
subseminear-ring, Smarandache simple seminear-ring and Smarandache commutative 
seminear-rings. We prove if a seminear-ring has a Smarandache subseminear ring 
then the seminear-ring is a S-seminear-ring. But even if N is S-seminear-ring its 
subseminear-ring in general need not be a S-subseminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.1: A set S with two binary operations ‘+’ and ‘.’ is called a 
Smarandache seminear-ring (S-seminear-ring) if (S, +) and (S, .) are Smarandache 
semigroups and for all s, s1, s11 ∈ S, (s + s1) s11 = ss11  + s1s11. 
 
Example 6.1.1: Let Z+ be the set of positive integers. (Z+, +) is a semigroup. Define 
‘.’ on Z+ by a.b = a for all a, b ∈ Z+. (Z+, ‘+’, ‘.’) is a seminear-ring which is not a S-
seminear-ring. Thus this example proves all seminear-rings are not in general S-
seminear-ring.  
 
Now we will see an example of a S-seminear-ring.  
 
Example 6.1.2: Let N = Z2 × (Z+ ∪ {0}) clearly N is a S-seminear-ring. Here Z+ ∪ 
{0} is a seminear ring with usual ‘+’ and ‘.’ defined by a.b = a for all a, b ∈ Z+. P = Z2 
× {0} is a subgroup of N under ‘+’ so N is a S-semigroup; {1} × {0} is a subgroup of 
N under ‘.’. Hence N is a S-seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.2: Let (N, +, .) be a seminear-ring. A proper subset P of N is said to 
be a Smarandache subseminear-ring (S-subseminear-ring) if (P, +, .) is a S-seminear-
ring.  
 

 
98 
THEOREM 6.1.1: Let (N, +, .) be a seminear-ring. If N has a S-subseminear-ring then 
N is a S-seminear-ring.  
 
Proof: Follows from the fact that if N has P to be a S-subseminear-ring then (P, +) is a 
S-semigroup and (P, .) is a S-semigroup. Since P ⊂ N, (N, +) is a S-semigroup and (N, 
.) is a S-semigroup.  
 
Thus we see in the definition of S-subseminear-ring we need not put the condition N 
is a S-seminear-ring. Still we may have examples in which a S-seminear-ring may not 
have proper S-subseminear-rings.  
 
In view of this we define the following:  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.3: Let (N, +, .) be a S-seminear-ring. If N has no proper S-
subseminear-rings we say N is a Smarandache simple seminear-ring (S-simple 
seminear-ring).  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.4: Let (N, +, .) be a seminear-ring. We say (N, +, .) is a Smarandache 
commutative seminear-ring (S-commutative seminear-ring) if every S-subseminear-
ring P, P ⊂ N is a commutative seminear-ring.  
 
THEOREM 6.1.2: Let N be a commutative seminear-ring which has S-subseminear-
rings then N is a S-commutative seminear-ring.  
 
Proof: Obvious.  
 
It is left as an exercise to find S-commutative seminear-ring which is not a 
commutative seminear-ring.  
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache ideals in seminear-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.5: Let (N, +, .) be a S-seminear-ring. If N has atleast one S-
subseminear-ring which is commutative then we say (N, +, .) is a Smarandache 
weakly commutative seminear-ring (S-weakly commutative seminear ring).  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.6: Let (N, +, .) be a seminear-ring. We say N has a Smarandache 
hyper subseminear-ring (S-hyper subseminear-ring) S,  
 
1. If (S, +) is a S-semigroup.  
2. If A is a proper subset S which is a subsemigroup of S and A contains the largest 
group of (S, +). 
3. (A, .) is a S-subsemigroup or a group.  
 
THEOREM 6.1.3: Let N be a seminear-ring. Every S-hyper subseminear-ring is a S-
subseminear-ring, but every S-subseminear-ring in general is not a S-hyper 
subseminear-ring.  
 
Proof: One way is straightforward by the definition. To prove the other part the reader 
is requested to construct examples.  
 

 
99 
Now we define Smarandache dual hyper subseminear-ring in the following.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.7: Let (N, +, .) be a seminear-ring. We say a proper subset S of N is a 
Smarandache dual hyper subseminear-ring (S-dual hyper subseminear-ring) if  
 
1. (S, .) is a S-semigroup.  
2. If A is a proper subset of S which is a subsemigroup of S and A contains the 
largest group of (S, .).  
3. (A, +) is a S-subsemigroup or a group.  
 
The reader is advised to obtain examples and some more properties about these 
concepts.  
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache normal subseminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.8: Let (N, +, .) be a seminear-ring. A proper subset A of N which is a 
group under the operations of both ‘+’ and ‘.’ ({A \ {0}} is a group under ‘.’) is called 
a Smarandache normal subseminear-ring (S-normal subseminear-ring) if x A ⊆ A and 
Ax ⊂ A or xA = {0} and Ax = {0} for all x ∈ S.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.9: If a seminear-ring (N, +, .) has no S-normal subseminear-ring then 
we call the seminear ring Smarandache pseudo simple (S-pseudo simple).  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.10: Let (N, +, .) be a seminear-ring. If A is a S-normal subseminear-
ring of N then we define the Smarandache quotient seminear-ring (S-quotient 
seminear-ring) of the seminear-ring of N by N / A = {Ax / x ∈ N}.  
 
It is not known under what condition N / A will be a near-ring or a S-near-ring or a 
seminear-ring or a S-seminear-ring.  
 
It is left as an open problem for the reader to solve.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.11: Let (N, +, .) be a S-seminear-ring, we say P is a Smarandache 
maximal S-subseminear-ring (S-maximal S-subseminear-ring) if there is a S-
subseminear-ring M such that P ⊂ M then P = M is the only possibility.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.12: Let (N, +, .) be a seminear-ring. If N has only one maximal 
subseminear-ring we call N a Smarandache maximal seminear-ring (S-maximal 
seminear-ring).  
 
THEOREM 6.1.4: If (N, +, .) is a S-maximal seminear-ring then N is a S-seminear-
ring.  
 
Proof: Follows from the very definition.  
 
PROBLEMS: 
 
1. 
Can a S-seminear-ring of order 5 exist?  
2. 
What is the order of the smallest S-seminear-ring? 
3.

11.

12.

6.2 Homomorphism and ideals of a S-seminear-ring  
 
In this section we define the notion of S-ideals and S-seminear-rings and obtain some 
Smarandache notions by way of definitions and properties. These S-seminear rings 
are got when the semigroups under '+' and '.' are replaced by S-semigroups.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.1: Let N and N1 be two S-seminear-rings. A map θ from N to N1 is 
said 
to 
be 
Smarandache 
seminear-ring 
homomorphism 
(S-seminear-ring 
homomorphism) if  
 
1. θ (x + y) = θ (x) + θ (y) for all x, y ∈ A, A an additive subgroup of (N, +) and θ 
(x), θ (y) ∈ A1, A1 an additive subgroup of (N, +).  
2. θ (xy) = θ (x) θ (y) for all x, y ∈ B, B a multiplicative subgroup (N, .) and θ(x), θ 
(y) ∈ B1,   B1 a subgroup of (N1, .). 
 
THEOREM 6.2.1: Let (N, +, .) be a S-seminear-ring. A proper subset P of N is a near-
ring if and only if  
 
1. (P, +) is a subgroup of (N, +). 
2. (P, .) is a subsemigroup of (N, .). 
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
Example 6.2.1: Let Z6 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Define ‘×’ as usual multiplication modulo 6 
‘o’ as a o b = a for all a, b ∈ Z6. Clearly (Z6, ×) is a S-semigroup for A = {1, 5} is a 
subgroup of Z6. (Z6, .) is a S-semigroup for every singleton {x} is a group as x o x = 
x.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.2: Let (N, +, .) be a S-seminear-ring. A proper subset P of N is said 
to be a Smarandache left ideal (S-left ideal) of N if  
 
1. (P, +) is a S-subsemigroup of (N, +). 
2. n (n1 + i) + nr n1 ∈ P for each i ∈ P and n, n1 ∈ A ⊂ N where (A, +) is a 
subgroup.  

 
101 
 
DEFINITION 6.2.3: Let P be a nonempty subset of a S-seminear-ring N. P is called an 
Smarandache ideal (S-ideal) of N if  
 
1. P is a S-left- ideal.  
2. PA ⊂ P (for A ⊂ N, A is a subgroup of (N, +)). 
 
DEFINITION 6.2.4: Let N be a S-seminear-ring. N is said to be Smarandache left 
bipotent (S-left bipotent) if Pa = Pa2 for all a ∈ N (P ⊂ N is subgroup of (N, +)). 
 
DEFINITION 6.2.5: Let N be a S-seminear-ring N is said to be Smarandache dually left 
bipotent (S-dually left bipotent) if B + a = B + a2 for all a ∈ N (B ⊂ N is a subgroup 
of (N, .)).  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.6: Let N be a S-seminear-ring. We say N is Smarandache strongly 
bipotent (S-strongly bipotent) if  
 
1. Pa = Pa2
.. 
2. P + a = P + a2 . 
 
where (P, +) is subgroup of (N, +) and (P, .) is a subgroup of (N, .).  
 
From the above definitions we have the following theorem which is left for the reader 
to prove as an exercise.  
 
THEOREM 6.2.2: Let N be a S-seminear-ring which is S-strongly bipotent then N is S-
left bipotent and S-dually left bipotent.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.7: A S-seminear-ring N is said to be a Smarandache s-seminear-ring 
(S-s-seminear-ring) if a ∈ Pa for each a ∈ N and P a subgroup of (N, +). 
 
DEFINITION 6.2.8: Let N be a S-seminear-ring. An additive subgroup A of N is called 
the Smarandache N-subgroup (S-N-subgroup) of N related to P if PA ⊂ A and AP ⊂ A 
where (P, .) is a subgroup of (N, .).  
 
PA = {pa / p ∈ P and a ∈ A}.  
 
Thus by the very definition S1N subgroups may or may not exist for all S-seminear-
ring.  
 
Example 6.2.2: Let Z12 = {0, 1, 2, 3, …, 11} be a S-seminear-ring under the operation 
‘×’ and ‘.’. Take A = {1, 5, 7, 11} is a subgroup of (Z12, ×). Take P = {1} a subgroup 
of (Z12, .); A is a S1N-subgroup of Z12.  
 
If we take P1 = {9} a subgroup of (Z12, .) A is not S1N-subgroup. From this we see the 
term “related to P” is important for a subgroup may fail to be S1N subgroup if we 
change P. This is evident from the above example. So a natural question of interest 
will be does there exist an additive subgroup in S-seminear-ring N such that A is a 

 
102 
S1N subgroup related to all subgroups of (N, .). If such seminear-rings exists 
characterize them. This is given as a suggested problem in chapter X.  
 
On similar dual lines one can define S1N subgroups replacing the operation ‘+’ by ‘.’ 
and ‘.’ and ‘+’ and study the related questions. It is left for the reader to define 
Smarandache dual N subgroups, (S1DN subgroups) and illustrate them by examples.  
 
PROBLEMS: 
 
1. 
Give an example of a S-seminear-ring N in which (P, +) is a subgroup but (P, .) is 
not even a semigroup, where P is a proper subset of N.  
2. 
Prove (Z24, ×, .) is a S-seminear-ring. Show (P, +) and (P, .) are group and S-
semigroup respectively. Show (P, .) a group exists in Z24.  
3. 
Find S-left ideals in Z24 given in example 2.  
4. 
Is (Z, ×, .) a S-seminear-ring? Justify. Will (Z, ×, . ) be a seminear-ring? 
5. 
Prove (Q, ×, .) is a S-seminear-ring. Is (Q, ×, .), S-strongly bipotent or just S-left 
bipotent? 
 
 
6.3 Smarandache seminear-rings of level II 
 
In section 6.1 we saw S-seminear-rings N defined as (N, +) and (N, .) to be S-
semigroups. We defined various Smarandache properties associated with them. Now 
we define in this section S-seminear-rings more in a conventional way, these S-
seminear-rings will be distinguished from type I by putting II. By default of notions 
we do not denote S-seminear-ring I by just S-seminear-ring. We obtain several 
interesting results about them.  
 
DEFINITION [99]: A nonempty set N is said to be a Smarandache seminear-ring II (S-
seminear-ring II) if (N, +, .) is a seminear-ring having a proper subset A (A ⊂ N) such 
that A under the same binary operations of N is a near-ring that is (A, +, .) is a near-
ring.  
 
Example 6.3.1: Let Z18 = {0, 1, 2 ,…, 17} be the set of integers modulo 18. Z18 under 
usual multiplication ‘×’ modulo 18 is a semigroup. Define ‘.’ an operation on Z18 as 
a.b = a for all a, b ∈ Z18. Clearly (Z18, ×, .) is a seminear-ring. (Z18, ×, .) is a S-
seminear-ring for take A = {1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17}; (A, ×, .) is a near-ring hence the 
claim.  
 
THEOREM 6.3.1: All seminear-rings need not in general be S-seminear-rings II. 
  
Proof: By an example.  
 
Let Z+ = {set of positive integers}. Z+ under ‘+’ is a semigroup. Define ‘o’ a binary 
operation on Z+ as a o b = a for all a, b ∈ Z+. Clearly Z+ is a seminear-ring which is 
not a S-seminear-ring.  
 
THEOREM 6.3.2: Let N be a S-seminear-ring II then N is a S-seminear-ring I provided 
(N, .) is a S-semigroup.  

 
103 
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definitions as (N, +) is a S-semigroup and (N, .) is a S-
semigroup.  
 
Example 6.3.2: Let Mn×n = {(aij) / aij ∈ Q}. Define matrix multiplicative as an 
operation on Mn×n. (Mn×n, ×) is a semigroup. Define ‘o’ on Mn×n as A o B = A for all 
A , B ∈ Mn×n, (Mn×n, ×, .) is S-seminear-ring. For the set of all n × n matrix with |A| ≠ 
0 is a group if we denote the collection by An×n then An×n ⊂ Mn×n. Clearly (An×n, ×, .) 
is a near-ring.  
 
Example 6.3.3: Let Z24 = {0, 1, 2, …, 23} be the set of integers modulo 24. Define 
usual multiplication '×' on Z24. (Z24, ×) is a semigroup. Define 'o' on Z24 as a o b = a 
for all a ∈ Z24. Z24 is a S-seminear-ring as A = {1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23} is a group 
under '×' as (A1, ×, .) is a near-ring. Thus Z24 is a S-seminear-ring. In view of these 
examples we propose problems in chapter 10.  
 
Example 6.3.4: Let Z4 = {0, 1, 2, 3}, clearly (Z4, '×', '.') is a S-seminear-ring as {A = 
{1, 3},  ×, . } is a near-ring.  
 
Example 6.3.5: Z9 = {0, 1, 2, …, 8} is a S-seminear-ring as {A = {1, 8}, ×, .} is a 
near-ring.  
 
From this example we see 9 is not a prime, still in case n = pα; where p is a prime, we 
see Zn is a S-seminear-ring.  
 
Example 6.3.6: Let Z25 = {0, 1 ,…,  24}. Z25 is a S-seminear-ring as (A = {1, 24}, ., 
×) is a near-ring.  
 
In view of this we have the following theorem.  
 
THEOREM 6.3.3: Let (
2
p
Z
, ×, .) be a seminear-ring. (
2
p
Z
,×, .) is a S-seminear-ring.  
 
Proof: To prove we have to show a near-ring as a substructure of (
2
p
Z
, ×, .). Take A 
= ({1, p2 –1}, ×, .) is a near-ring. Hence the claim.  
 
THEOREM 6.3.4: Let 
n
p
Z
 = {0, 1, …, pn-1} be a seminear-ring under ‘×’ and ‘.’.  
Clearly 
n
p
Z
 is a S-seminear-ring for take {A = ({1, pn-1}, ×, .)}; A is near-ring.  
 
Proof: Simple number theoretic arguments will yield the result.  
 
Thus we have a natural class of S-seminear-rings. In fact this natural class of S-
seminear-rings is also trivially S-seminear-rings of level I by taking singletons x in Zn 
where x2 = x.  
 

 
104 
Now it may happen that many near-rings may contain subsets which are seminear-
rings we choose to call these S-pseudo seminear-rings which will be dealt in the next 
section.  
 
PROBLEMS:  
 
1. 
Find a seminear-ring other than Z+ which is not a S-seminear-ring.  
2. 
Prove Z19 = {0, 1, 2, …, 18} is S-seminear-ring.  
3. 
Does there exist an example of a S-seminear-ring I which is never a S-seminear-
ring II? Justify your answer.  
4. 
Illustrate by an example that there exists a S-seminear-ring II which is not a S-
seminear-ring I.  
5.

rings?

Z28.  
7. 
Is Z2 = {0, 1} a S-seminear-ring? Justify your answer. 
 
 
6.4 Smarandache pseudo seminear-ring  
 
In this section we just define the concept of S-pseudo seminear-rings and obtain some 
interesting results about them. This is an interesting case when a near-ring has the 
general structure as a proper subset. To find a natural class of such S-pseudo 
seminear-rings we define Smarandache mixed direct products in near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 6.4.1: N is said to be Smarandache pseudo seminear-ring (S-pseudo 
seminear-ring) if N is a near-ring and has a proper subset A of N such that A is a 
seminear-ring under the operations of N.  
 
Example 6.4.1: Let Z be the set of integers under usual '+' and ‘o’ defined by a o b = a 
for all a, b ∈ Z, (Z, ‘+’, ‘o’) is a near-ring. Taking A = Z+; (Z+, +, .) is a seminear-ring 
So Z is a S-pseudo seminear-ring.  
 
Example 6.4.2: Let Z[x] be the polynomial ring over the ring of integers. Define ‘+’ 
on Z[x] as usual addition of polynomials. Define an operation ‘o’ on Z[x] as p(x) . 
q(x) = p(x) for all p(x), q(x) ∈ Z[x]. Clearly (Z[x], +, .) is a S-pseudo seminear-ring 
for (Z+ [x], +, .) is a seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.4.2: Let N and N1 be two S-pseudo seminear-rings. h : N → N1 is a 
Smarandache pseudo seminear ring homomorphism (S-pseudo seminear-ring 
homomorphism) if h restricted from A to A1 is a seminear-ring homomorphism.  
 
DEFINITION 6.4.3: Let N be a S-seminear-ring II. An additive subgroup A of N is 
called a Smarandache N-subgroup II (S-N-subgroup II) if NA ⊂ N (AN ⊂ A) where 
NA = {na / n ∈ N and a ∈ A}. 
 
Thus we see in case of S-seminear-rings we have the concept of S-N-subgroup. We 
define S-left ideal for S-seminear-ring.  

 
105

6.5 Miscellaneous properties of some new classes Smarandache 
seminear-ring. 
 
In this section we recollect the various properties of seminear-ring and adopt them to 
S-seminear-rings. We study and introduce the two new classes of seminear-rings got 
using groups and semigroups. We study about units and zero divisors in these 
structure. We introduce the concept of semi-idempotents in case of S-seminear-rings. 
Just we recall the definition of group seminear-rings [84].  
 
DEFINITION 6.5.1: Let (N, +, .) be a seminear-ring such that (N, +) is a commutative 
semigroup and (N, .) is a semigroup, G be any group. The group G over the seminear-
ring N; called the group seminear-ring, NG is a seminear-ring; NG consists of all 
formal sums of the form α = Σ α (g) g; α (g) ∈ N and g ∈ G such that supp α = {g / 
α(g) ≠ 0} i.e. the support of α is finite satisfying the following operational rules.  
 
1. Σ α (g) g = Σ β (g) g ⇔ α (g) = β (g) for all g ∈ G. 
2. Σ α (g) g + Σ β (g) g = Σ (α (g) + β (g)) g for all g ∈ G.  
3. (Σ α (g) g) (Σ β (g1) g1) = Σ µ (g1) g1 where µ (g) = Σ α (g) β (g1) with gg1 = g1 
provided the coefficient are distributive from the left and right; otherwise we 
assume the product term is in NG. 
4. Σ α (g) gn = Σ α (g) ng ∀ α (g), n ∈ N.  
 
Since 1 ∈ G we see N ⊆ NG. G may or may not be contained in NG. For all n ∈ N 
and g ∈ G we have ng = gn. It can be verified NG is a seminear-ring.  
 

 
107 
THEOREM 6.5.1: Let N = Z+ ∪ {0} be a seminear-ring and G any group. The group 
seminear-ring NG has no nontrivial divisors of zero.  
 
Proof: Follows from the fact if α = Σ αi gi; αi ∈ Z+ and β = Σ βj hj; βj ∈ Z+, αβ ≠ 0 as 
in Z+ ∪ {0}; 0h = 0 for all h ∈ N. Hence the claim.  
 
Thus we see in case of group rings RG, every element of finite order in the group G 
will give way to a zero divisor. This is not in general true for group seminear-rings, 
evident from theorem 6.5.1.  
 
Now we proceed on to define semigroup seminear-rings. If in the definition of group 
seminear-ring we replace the group G by a semigroup we get the semigroup seminear-
ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.5.2: Let N be a seminear-ring and S a semigroup with unit. The 
semigroup seminear-ring NS is defined analogous to group seminear-rings i.e. in the 
definition 6.5.1 replace the group G by a semigroup S with unit we get semigroup 
seminear-ring NS.  
 
It is easily proved NS is also a seminear-ring.  
 
THEOREM 6.5.2: Let Z+ ∪ {0} = N be a seminear-ring and S any semigroup with unit. 
βα = αβ = 1 if and only if Σ αi = 1and Σ βi = 1 where α = Σ αi si and β = Σ βj sj 
[only under product αβ = Σ αi si   Σ βj si = Σ αi for all αi β ∈ NS (as in Z+ we have 
ab = a ∀ a, b ∈ Z+)].  
 
Proof: Using the definitions the result is straightforward.  
 
We now proceed on to define the concept of semi-idempotents in near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 6.5.3: Let N be a seminear- ring we say α ∈ N is a semi-idempotents of N 
if N(α2 - α) does not contain (α2 - α).  
 
DEFINITION 6.5.4: A seminear-ring N is strongly subcommutative if every left ideal of 
it is a right quasi reflexive. (They define ideal in seminear-rings in a different way). 
 
DEFINITION [2]: Let R denote a seminear-ring. A non-empty subset I of R is an ideal 
if x + y, rx, xr are in I for all x, y ∈ I and r ∈ R.  
 
In this book we call this ideal as a common ideal.  
 
DEFINITION [2]: A ideal I is called strongly idempotent (SI-seminear-ring) if for every 
ideal I is such that 〈I2〉 = I.  
 
For more about these concepts refer [2].  
 
We just introduce here the notion of chain seminear-ring.  
 

 
108 
DEFINITION 6.5.5: A seminear-ring S is said to be a left chain seminear-ring if the set 
of all left ideals of S is totally ordered by inclusion.  
 
DEFINITION 6.5.6: A seminear-ring N is said to be a chain seminear-ring if the set of 
ideals of N is totally ordered by inclusion.  
 
DEFINITION 6.5.7: Let P ⊂ S be an ideal of S, P is called prime if for all ideals I, J ∈ 
S, IJ ⊂ P implies I ⊂ P or J ⊂ P.  
 
DEFINITION 6.5.8: An ideal I ⊆ S is called semiprime if and only if for all ideals J ⊂ 
S, J2 ⊂ I implies J ⊂ I.  
 
DEFINITION 6.5.9: Let S be a seminear-ring. The prime radical of S is the intersection 
of all prime ideals of S.  
 
As our main motivation is only the study of S-seminear-ring we have only just 
recalled the definitions and concepts about seminear-rings and by no means we deeply 
go into the subject as we assume the author to be well versed in the theory of near-
rings. Hence we now proceed on to define Smarandache analogous of each and every 
concept mentioned here. We also by no means claim that we have exhausted all the 
properties about seminear-rings. We enlist here only those notions and definitions 
which was available to us.  
 
Now first we study when do we call any group seminear-ring to be a Smarandache 
group seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.5.10: A group seminear-ring NG of a group G over a near-ring NS is 
called a Smarandache group seminear-ring (S-group seminear-ring) if and only if N 
is a S-seminear-ring II.  
 
THEOREM 6.5.3: Let NG be a S-group seminear-ring then N has a near-ring P such 
that P ⊄ N but P ⊂ NG.  
 
Proof: From the very construction and definition of S-group seminear-ring NG we 
have N to be S-seminear-ring so N contains a near-ring P ⊂ N. Clearly PG the group 
near-ring which is a near-ring. Hence the claim.  
 
Example 6.5.1: Let Z24 be a seminear-ring with operation ‘×’ and ‘o’ where '×' is the 
usual multiplication modulo 24 and a o b = a for all a, b ∈ Z24. A = {1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 
17, 19, 23} is a near-ring. Let G = S3. The group seminear-ring Z24G contains AG to 
be a near-ring, hence the claim. Find zero divisors, idempotents, and units in Z24G.  
 
DEFINITION 6.5.11: Let N be a seminear-ring and S a semigroup. The semigroup 
seminear-ring NS is said to be a Smarandache semigroup seminear-ring (S-
semigroup seminear-ring) if and only if S is a S-semigroup.  
 
Thus it is an interesting problem to find when S-semigroup seminear-rings are S-
seminear-rings.  
 

 
109 
Example 6.5.2: Let N = Z+ be a seminear-ring under ‘×’ and ‘o’. S = S(n) be the 
symmetric semigroup i.e. the semigroup of all mapping of a set of n elements to itself. 
NS is a Smarandache semigroup seminear-ring as S(n) is a S-semigroup.  
 
DEFINITION 6.5.12: Let N be a seminear-ring. We say N is Smarandache strongly 
subcommutative seminear-ring (S-strongly subcommutative seminear-ring) if every S-
right ideal of it is a right quasi reflexive.  
 
DEFINITION 6.5.13: Let R be a S-seminear-ring. We call a non-empty subset I of R to 
be a Smarandache common ideal (S-common ideal) related to A, (A ⊂ R and A is a 
near-ring) if  
 
i.  
x + y ∈ I, for all x, y ∈ I.     
ii.  
ax, anx,  xa ∈ I for all x ∈ I and a ∈ A.  
 
THEOREM 6.5.4: If N is a S-seminear-ring. Every common ideal of N is a S-common 
ideal of N. But all S-common ideals of N need not be common ideals of N.  
 
Proof: Follows from the definitions. The reader is expected to construct an example of 
an S-common ideal which is not a common ideal.  
 
Example 6.5.3: Let Z24 = {0, 1, 2, …, 23} be a S-seminear-ring under ‘×’ and ‘.’ 
Does this seminear-ring have S-common ideals and common ideals?  
 
DEFINITION 6.5.14: Let N be a seminear-ring. N is said to satisfy Smarandache chain 
seminear-ring condition (S-chain seminear-ring condition) if the set of S-ideals of N is 
totally ordered by inclusion.  
 
The reader is requested to formulate interesting results and properties about these S-
chain conditions on seminear-rings.  
 
DEFINITIONS 6.5.15: Let N be a seminear-ring. An S-ideal I ⊆ N is called 
Smarandache semiprime  ( S-semiprime )  if and only if for  all S-ideals J ⊂ S, J2 ⊂ I 
implies J ⊂ I.  
 
DEFINITION 6.5.16: Let P ⊂ N, N a seminear-ring. An S-ideal of N, P is called 
Smarandache prime (S-prime) if for all S-ideals I, J ∈ N,   IJ ⊂ P implies I ⊂ P or J ⊂ 
P.  
 
Motivated by these definitions the reader is expected to study the notions of S-zero 
divisors, S-idempotents, S-units, S-nilpotents and S-semi-idempotents which can be 
thought of as element wise study. Find also substructure like S-ideals, S-common 
ideals, S-chain condition for S-group seminear-rings, S-semigroup seminear-rings, S-
seminear-ring and characterize them. It is upto the researchers to find innovative and 
ingenous results about S-seminear-rings. Several suggested problems proposed in 
chapter X may help the reader with more information.  
 
We at this point wish to state several modular or non-modular lattices may contain 
subsets which are seminear-rings. Thus we can have a class of seminear-rings derived 

 
110 
from modular or non-modular lattices as distributive lattices are trivially seminear-
ring.

SOME APPLICATIONS OF 
SMARANDACHE NEAR-RINGS AND 
NEAR-RINGS 
 
 
This chapter is a maiden effort to bring the two probable existing applications of near-
rings and seminear-rings. We are not widely speaking about the applications of near-
rings we only discuss here the two applications one in automatons and the other in the 
construction of error correcting codes. This chapter has three sections. In section one 
we recall the basic notions of an automaton, semi-automaton, Smarandache 
automaton and group automaton and give some interesting illustrations of them.  
 
Section two completely gives the definition of Smarandache semigroup semi-
automaton and illustrate them with examples and also give the associated syntactic 
near-ring. We introduce the state graph for these S-S-semigroup semi-automaton and 
extend this notion to the group automaton and Smarandache S-semigroup automaton 
(S-S-semigroup automaton) and define the concept of Smarandache syntactic near-
ring. The final section is just only the introduction of Smarandache-planar near-rings 
used in the construction of  Balanced incomplete block design, (BIBD) we show the 
introduction of a S-planar near-rings leads to several BIBDs for any given S-planar 
near-ring.  
 
 
7.1 Basics on automaton and on semi-automaton  
 
In this section we just recall the definitions of automaton, semi-automaton, 
Smarandache automaton, Smarandache semi-automaton and group semi-automaton 
and finally the concept of syntactic near-ring given by [18]. We illustrate them with 
explicit examples so that it would become easy in the next section when we introduce 
the Smarandache equivalence of a syntactic near-ring and its probable application to 
group semi-automaton. As this section deals with application all basic relevant 
information are recalled.  
 
DEFINITION 7.1.1: A semi-automaton is a tripe S = (Z, A, δ) consisting of two 
nonempty sets Z and A and a function δ : Z × A → Z, Z is called the set of states and A 
the input alphabet and δ the next state function of S.  
 
DEFINITION 7.1.2: An automaton is a quintuple A = (Z, A, B, δ, λ) where (Z, A, δ) is a 
semi-automaton, B is a nonempty set called the output alphabet and λ : Z × A → B is 
the output function.  
 
A (semi) automaton is finite if all sets Z, A and B are finite. Several types of 
automaton are studied. 
  
We usually describe the (semi) automaton only by tables or by graphs.  

 
112 
 
Description of automaton: 
 
Let A = {a1, a2, …, an}, B = {b1, b2, …, bn} and Z = {z1, z2 ,…, zk} where A is the 
input alphabet, B is the output alphabet and Z is the set of states. We describe δ the 
next state function from Z × A → Z by the following transition table.

The output table in case of automaton is given by λ, where λ : Z × A → B where B is 
the output alphabet is given by the following output table.

where λ (zi, ai) ∈ B.  
 
The graphical representation which is called a state graph are drawn by taking the set 
of states z1, z2, …, zk as, ‘discs’.  
 
 
 
 
if  δ (zr, ai) = zs. In case of an automaton, we have λ (zr, ai) also as the output function 
so that the state graph in this case is  
 
 
 
 
 
We illustrate by the following example the parity check automaton by both the tables 
and state graphs.  
 
Example (Parity-check Automaton): Let Z = Z = {z0, z1}, A = B = {0, 1} and

The state graph of this automaton  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This automaton has liminations for a given input it can give an output. It cannot do 
any sequential operations so using free semigroups as automaton which can perform 
sequence of operations acting on sequence of elements. To achieve this we define the 
following:  
 
A   
=  
free semigroup generated by the input  
alphabets A together with the empty sequence Λ.  
 
B  
= 
free semigroup generated by the output  
alphabets B together with the empty sequence Λ.  
 
Clearly the number of states Z in a machine cannot be adjusted as it is constructed or 
designed with a fixed number of states.  
 
We extend the next state function δ and the output function λ from Z × A to Z × A  by 
defining for z ∈ Z and a1, a2 …, ar ∈ A where δ: Z × A → Z and δ . Z × A  → Z by

Now using the concept of semi-automaton and automaton we define the concept of 
Smarandache semi-automaton and Smarandache automaton as follows:  
 
We would advise the reader to go through the definition of free groupoids and 
Smarandache free groupoids defined in chapter I.  
 
DEFINITION [98]: γs = (Z, 
)
,
A
s
s δ
is said to be a Smarandache semi-automaton if 
s
A  
= 〈A〉 is the free groupoid generated by A with Λ the empty sequence adjoined with it 
and 
s
δ  is the function from Z × 
s
A → Z. Thus the Smarandache semi-automaton (S 
semi-automaton) contains γ = (Z, 
)
,
A
s
s δ
as a new semi-automaton which is a proper 
substructure of γs.  
 
Or equivalently we define a S-semi-automaton as one which has a new semi-
automaton as a substructure.  
 
Clearly the S-semi-automaton is a generalized structure than the new semi-automaton 
as all free semigroups are in A  where A  is the free groupoid generated by A.

Example 7.1.1: Let Z = Z4= (2, 2) and A = Z3 (1, 2) we define δ (z, a) = z * a (mod 4) 
‘*’ as in Z. The table for the semi-automaton is given by  
 
δ

The graph for it is  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus this has Smarandache subsemi-automaton Z1 given by Z1 = {0, 2} states.  
 
Remark: A machine equipped with this S-semi-automaton can use any new 
automaton as per need. Now proceed on to recall the definition of group semi-
automaton.

Thus S-automaton enables us to adjoin some more elements which is present in A and 
freely generated by A, as a free groupoid; that will be the case when the compositions 
may not be associative.  
 
Secondly, by using S-automaton we can couple several automaton as  
 
 
Z

A machine equipped with this S-automaton can use any new automaton as per need.   
 
Example 7.1.2: Let Z = Z4 (3, 2), A = B = Z5 (2, 3). K = (Z, A, B, δ, λ) is a S-automaton 
defined by the following tables where δ (z, a) = z ∗ a (mod 4) and  λ (z, a) = z ∗ a (mod 
5).

We obtain the following graph:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus we see this automaton has two Smarandache subautomatons given by the sates {0,

The Smarandache automaton direct product (S-automaton direct product) of

K   is defined as the direct product of the automaton K1 = (Z1, A1, B1,

δ ((z1, z2), (a1, a2)) = (δ1 (z1, a2), δ2 (z2, a2)), λ ((z1, z2), (a1, a2)) = (λ1 (z1, a2), λ2 (z2, a2)) 
for all (z1, z2) ∈ Z1 × Z2 and (a1, a2) ∈ A1 × A2.  
 
Remark: Here in

Thus the S-automaton direct product exists wherever a automaton direct product exists.  
 
We have made this in order to make the Smarandache parallel composition and 
Smarandache series composition of automaton extendable in a simple way.  
 
DEFINITION [98]: A Smarandache groupoid G1 divides a Smarandache groupoid G2 if 
the corresponding semigroups S1 and S2 of G1 and G2 respectively divides, that is, if S1 is 
a homomorphic image of a sub-semigroup of S2.

We proceed on to define direct product S-automaton and study about them. We can 
extend the direct product of semi-automaton to more than two S-automatons. Using the 
definition of direct product of two automaton K1 and K2 with an additional assumption we 
define Smarandache series composition of automaton.

The Smarandache automaton composition series (S-automaton composition series)

K  of 
1
K  and

K  is defined as the series composition of the automaton

K = (Z1 × Z2, A1, B2, δ, λ) 
where δ ((z1, z2), a1) = (δ1(z1, a1), δ2(z2, λ1(z1, a1))  and λ((z1, z2), a1) = (λ2(z2, λ1(z1, a1)) 
((z1, z2) ∈ Z1 × Z2, a1 ∈ A1). 
 
This automaton operates as follows: An input a1 ∈ A1 operates on z1 and gives a state 
transition into z1' = δ1(z1, a1) and an output b1 = λ1(z1, a2) ∈ B1 = A2. This output b1 
operates on Z2 transforms a z2 ∈ Z2 into z2'  = δ2(a2, b1) and produces the output  λ2(z2, 
b1).  
 
Then

K  ||

K  is in the next state (z1', z2') which is clear from the following circuit:

K .

K  since Z1, and Z2 can be interpreted 
as two parallel blocks. A1 operates on Zi with output Bi (i ∈ {1,2}), A1 × A2 operates on

DEFINITION [18]: A group semi-automaton is an ordered triple S = (G, I, δ) where G 
is a group; I is a set of inputs and δ : G × I → G is a transition function.  
 
For more about these refer [18]. We illustrate this by an example.  
 
Example 7.1.3: Let G = S3, where S = {p0, p1, …, p5} I = {0, 1, 2,} be the set of 
inputs. The transition function δ : G × I → G defined by

δ (pi, 0) = pi for i = 1, 2, …, 5  
δ (pi 1) = pi+1 and δ (p5 1) = 0, for i = 1, 2, …, 4 
δ (pi 2) = pi+2, for i = 1, 2, 3 and δ (p4, 2) = p0 δ = (p5, 2) = p1 
 
Clearly (G, I, δ) is a group semi-automaton.  
Now using the notions of [27] we define the following.  
 
DEFINITION [27]: A semi-automaton S = (Q, ×, δ) with state set Q input monoid X and 
state transition function δ; δ : Q × X → Q is called a group semi-automaton if Q is an 
additive group. δ is called additive if there is some x0 ∈ X with δ (q, x) = δ (q, x0) + δ 
(0, x) and δ (q – q1, x0) = δ (q, x0) - δ (q1, x0) for all q, q1 ∈ Q and x ∈ X. Then there 
is some homomorphism  
 
 
ψ : Q → Q and some map  
 
 
α : × → Q with (x0) = 0 and δ (q, x) = ψ (q) + α (x).  
 
Let δx for a fixed, x ∈ X be the map Q → Q; q → δ (q, x) then {δx / x ∈ X} generates a 
subnear-ring N (S) of near-ring (M (Q), +, .) of all mappings on Q. This near-ring N 
(S) is called the syntactic near-ring.  
 
Thus both [18] and [27] have defined group semi-automaton and syntactic near-ring.  
 
 
PROBLEMS:  
 
1. 
Describe the semi-automaton with A = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4); Z3 =  (0, 1, 2) and δ : Z3 × A 
→ Z3 by δ (z, ai) = zai (mod 3) by the table and graph.  
2. 
Describe the following automaton A = (Z, A, B, δ, λ) given by Z = Z7; A = B = 
Z5, δ (z, a) = z + a (mod 7), λ (z, a) = z.a (mod 5), by a state graph and by the 
tables.  
3. 
Convert the automaton A given in problem 2 into a new automaton.  
4. 
Let A = B = Z5 (3, 2) be a S-groupoid of order 7 and Z = Z (2, 2). Describe the S-
automaton where δ (z, a) = z * a (mod 4) and λ (za) = z * a (mod 5) by its graph. 
5. 
For the group G = 〈g / g7 = 1〉 and I = {0, 1, 2, 3}, set of input with δ : G × I → G 
defined by δ(gi, 0) = gi+0 δ(gi, 3) = gi+1, δ(gi, 2) = gi+2 and δ(gi, 3) = gi+3 for gi ∈ G 
describe the group semi-automaton what is the associated syntactic near-ring.  
 
 
7.2 Smarandache S-semigroup semi-automaton and the associated 
Smarandache syntactic near-ring  
 
In this section we introduce the concept of Smarandache semigroup semi-automaton 
analogous to the group semi-automaton. Further for each group semi-automaton an 
associated syntactic near-ring is also given. Here we define the Smarandache 
analogous of it.  
 
DEFINITION 7.2.1: Let G be S-semigroup. A Smarandache S-semigroup 
semiautomaton (S-S-semigroup semiautomaton) is an ordered triple S(S) = (G, I, δ) 

 
120 
where G is a S-semigroup; I is a set of inputs and δ : G × I → G is a transition 
function.  
 
Clearly all group semi-automatons are trivially S-S-semigroup semiautomaton. Thus 
the class of S-S semigroup semiautomaton propertly contains the class of group semi-
automaton.  
 
Example 7.2.1: Let G = {0, 1, 2, … , 5} = Z6 and I = {0, 1, 2} be the set of states; 
define the transition function δ : G × I → G by δ(g, i) = g.i (mod 6) thus we get the S-
semigroup semi-automaton. We give the following state graph representation for this 
S-S semigroup semi-automaton.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Now we see when we change the function δ1 for the same S-semigroup, G and I = {0, 
1, 2} we get a different S-S-semigroup semiautomaton which is given by the 
following figure; here the transition fuctions. δ : G × I → G is defined by δ1 (g, i) = (g 
+ i) mod 6. We get a nice symmetric S-S-semigroup semiautomaton.

DEFINITION 7.2.2: Let S (S) = (G, I, δ) where G is a S-semigroup I the set of input 
alphabets and δ the transition fuction as in case of S-S semigroup semi-automaton. 
We call a proper subset B ⊂ G with B a S-subsemigroup of G and I1 ⊂ I denoted (B, 
I1, δ) = S(SB) is called the Smarandache subsemigroup semi-automaton (S-
subsemigroup semiautomaton) if δ : B × I1 → B. A S-S-semigroup semi-automaton 
may fail to have sometimes S-S-subsemigroup subsemi-automaton.  
 
Example 7.2.2: In example 7.2.1 with S = {Z6, I, δ} when we take B = {0, 2, 4} we 
get a S-S-semigroup subsemi-automaton  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as B = {0, 2, 4} is a S-subsemigroup of Z6.  
 
Now to the best of our knowledge we have not seen the definition of group automaton 
we define it and then proceed on to get corresponding near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 7.2.3: A group automaton is an ordered quintuple A = {G, A, B, δ, λ} 
where G is a group, A is a set of inputs, B is a set of outputs δ : G × A → G and λ : G 
× A → B is the transition and output functions respectively.  
 
The Smarandache analogous of this would be as follows.  
 
DEFINITION 7.2.4: A Smarandache S-semigroup automaton (S-S semigroup 
automaton) is an ordered quintuple S(A) = (G, A, B, δ, λ) where G is a S-semigroup 
and A set of input alphabets and B set of output alphabets, δ and λ are the transition 
and output functions respectively.  
 
If δ restricted form G × A → G maps a subgroup T ⊂  G into itself δ : T × A → T then 
we can say the S-S-semigroup automaton has (T ⊂ G, A, B, δ, λ) to be a group 
automaton.  
 
We call this level I S-S-semigroup automaton. Now we proceed on to define S-S-
semigroup semiautomaton and S-S-semigroup automaton of level II.  
 
DEFINITION 7.2.5: Let S = (G, I, δ) be an ordered triple where G is only a S-
semigroup. If B ⊂ G and B is a group under the operations of G, and if S1 = (B, I, δ) 
is a group semi-automaton with B a group, I is a set of inputs and δ : B × I → B then 
S = (G, I, δ) is called the Smarandache S-semigroup semi-automaton of level II (S-S-
0

Figure 7.2.3 

 
122 
semigroup semiautomaton II). Similarly we define Smarandache S-semigroup 
automaton of level II (S-S-semigroup automaton II).  
 
It is left for the reader to find any relation existing between the two levels of 
automaton. Now we proceed on to see how these concepts will produce for us the S-
near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 7.2.6: Let S = (Q, X δ) be a S-S-semigroup semi-automaton where Q is a 
S-semigroup under addition ‘+’ i.e. G ⊂ Q is such that G is a S-semigroup under ‘+’ 
and G a proper subset of Q Let δ : G × X → G is well defined i.e. restriction of δ to G 
is well defined so (G, X, δ) = C becomes a semi-automaton C is called additive if 
there is some x0 ∈ X with  
 
 
 
 
δ (q, x) = δ (q, x0) + δ (0, x) and  
 
 
 
δ (q – q1, x0) = δ (q1 x0) - δ (q1, x0) for all q, q1 ∈ G and x ∈ X.  
 
Then there is some homomorphism  
 
 
 
 
ψ : G → G and some map  
 
 
 
α : X → G with ψ(x0) = 0 and δ(q, x) = ψ(q) + α(x).  
 
Let δx for a fixed x ∈ X be the map from G → G; q → δ (q, x). Then {δx / x ∈ X} 
generates a subnear-ring N (P) of the near-ring (M (G), +, .) of all mappings on G; 
this near-ring N(P) is called as the Smarandache syntactic near-ring (S-syntactic 
near-ring).  
 
The varied structural properties are enjoyed by this S-syntactic near-ring for varying 
S-semigroups. The most interesting feature about these S-syntactic near-ring is that 
for one S-S-semigroup semi-automaton we have several group semiautomaton 
depending on the number of valid groups in the S-semigroup. This is the vital benefit 
in defining S-S-semigroup automaton and S-syntactic near-ring. So for a given S-S-
semigroup semi-automaton we can have several S-syntactic near-ring.  
 
Thus the Smarandache notions in this direction has evolved several group automaton 
for a given S-semigroup. 
 
PROBLEMS:  
 
1. 
Let S = (G, I, δ) where G = S5 define  : G × I → G in any suitable way where I 
= {0, 1} and obtain state graph of S.  
2. 
Let S(S) = {S(5), I = {0, 1, 2}, δ} study the S-S-semigroup semi-automaton.  
3. 
Give an example of a syntactic near-ring.  
4. 
Find an example of S-syntactic near-ring. Does it have S-ideals which have 
any impact on the S-S-semigroup semi-automaton?  
5. 
Let S = {Z12, I, δ}, I = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, δ = Z12 × I → Z12, δ (xi, k) = xi.k (mod 
12), and Z12 is a S-semigroup under '×' mod 12. Does this have S-S-semigroup 
subsemi-automaton?

7.3 Applications of near-rings to error correcting codes and their 
Smarandache analogue  
 
The study of how experiments can be organized systematically so that statistical 
analysis can be applied in an interesting problem which is carried out by several 
researchers. In the planning of experiments it often occurs that results are influenced 
by phenomena outside the control of the experimenter. The introduction of balanced 
incomplete block design (BIBD) helps in avoiding undesirable influences in the 
experiment. In general, if we have to test the effect of r different conditions with m 
possibilities for each conditions this leads to a set of r orthogonal latin squares.  
 
 
A planar near-ring can be used to construct balanced incomplete block designs 
(BIBD) of high efficiency; we just state how they are used in developing error 
correcting codes as codes which can correct errors is always desirable than the ones 
which can only detect errors. In view of this we give the following definition. Just we 
recall the definition of BIBD for the sake of completeness.  
 
DEFINITION 7.3.1: A balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) with parameters (υ, b, 
r, k, λ) is a pair (P, B) with the following properties.  
 
i. P is a set with υ elements. 
ii. B = (B1, …, Bb) is a subset of p (P) with b elements.  
iii. Each Bi has exactly k elements where k < υ each unordered pair 
(p, q) with p, q ∈ P, p ≠ q occurs in exactly λ elements in B.  
 
The set B1, …, Bb are called the blocks of BIBD. Each a ∈ P occurs in exactly r sets of 
B. Such a BIBD is also called a (υ, b, r, k, λ) configuration or 2 – (υ, k, λ) tactical 
configuration or design. The term balance indicates that each pair of elements occurs 
in exactly the same number of block, the term incomplete means that each block 
contains less than υ - elements. A BIBD is symmetric if υ = b.  
 
The incidence matrix of a (υ, b, r, k, λ) configuration is the v ×  b matrix A = (aij) 
where

here i denotes the ith element of the configuration. The following conditions are 
necessary for the existence of a BIBD with parameters υ, b, r, k, λ.  
 
1. bk = rv. 
2. r(k – 1) = λ (v – 1). 
3. b ≥ v.  
 
Recall a near-ring N is called planar (or Clay near-ring) if for all equation x o a = x 
o b + c. (a, b, c ∈ N, a ≠ b) have exactly one solution x ∈ N.  
 

 
124 
Example 7.3.1: Let (Z5, ‘+’, *) where ‘+’ is the usual ‘+’ and ‘*’ is n * 0 = 0, n * 1 = 
n * 2 = n, n * 3 = n * 4 = 4n for all n ∈ N. Then 1 ≡ 2 and 3 ≡ 4. N is planar near-ring; 
the equation x * 2 = x * 3 + 1 with 2 ≠ 3 has unique solution x = 3.  
 
A planar near-ring can be used to construct BIBD of high efficiency where by high 
efficiency ‘E’ we mean E = λv / rk; this E is a number between 0 and 1 and it 
estimates the quality of any statistical analysis if E ≥ 0.75 the quality is good.  
 
Now, how does one construct a BIBD from a planar ring? This is done in the 
following way.  
 
Let N be a planar ring. Let a ∈ N. Define ga : N → N by n → n o a and form G = {ga / 
a ∈ N}. Call a ∈ N “group forming” if a o N is a subgroup of (N, +). Let us call sets a 
. N + b (a ∈ N*, b ∈ N) blocks. Then these blocks together with N as the set of 
“points” form a tactical configuration with parameters  
 
(υ, b, r, k, λ) = (υ, 
|
G
|
1υ
α
 + α2 υ, α1 + α2 |G|, |G|, λ) 
 
where υ = |N| and α1 (α2) denote the number of orbits of F under the group G \ {0} 
which consists of entirely of group forming elements. The tactical configuration is a 
BIBD if and only if either all elements are group forming or just 0 is group forming.  
 
Now how are they used in obtaining error correcting codes. Now using the planar 
near-ring one can construct a BIBD. By taking either the rows or the columns of the 
incidence matrix of such a BIBD one can obtain error correcting codes with several 
nice features. Now instead of using a planar near-ring we can use Smarandache planar 
near-ring. The main advantage in using the Smarandache planar near-ring is that for 
one S-planar near-ring we can define more than one BIBD. If there are m-near-field in 
the S-planar near-ring we can build m BIBD. Thus this may help in even comparison 
of one BIBD with the another and also give the analysis of the common features.  
 
Thus the S-planar near-ring has more advantages than the usual planar near-rings and 
hence BIBD's constructed using S-planar near-rings will even prove to be an efficient 
error correcting codes.  
 
PROBLEMS:  
 
1. 
Using (Z7, +, .) build a planar near-ring.  
2. 
Can (Z7, +, .) help in constructing S-planar near-ring? Justify your claim. 
3. 
For the planar near-ring (Z11, +, .) construct the associated BIBD.  
4. 
For the S-planar near-ring constructed using Z24, how many associated 
BIBD’s can be constructed?

For the S-planar ring N = (Z12, +, .) using the BIBD associated with N 
construct error correcting codes.

SMARANDACHE NON-ASSOCIATIVE 
NEAR-RING AND SEMINEAR-RING 
 
 
This chapter is solely devoted to the study and introduction of Smarandache non-
associative near-rings (S-NA-near-rings) and Smarandache non-associative seminear-
rings  (S-NA-seminear-ring). The study of non-associative near-rings started in the 
year 1978. They have called the loop near-ring which is a non-associative structure 
with respect to the operation ‘+’ which is very unusual in rings.  
 
This chapter is organized into five sections. In section one we just define S-NA-
seminear-ring and define several of its Smarandache properties. In section two we 
construct several new types of S-NA-near-rings and seminear-rings using S-mixed 
direct product. Here we also define level II seminear-rings and study them. Section 
three is completely devoted to the introduction of Smarandache loop near-ring, 
Smarandache near loop ring and the identities satisfied by them. In section four we 
study the new S-NA-seminear-rings built using loops and groupoids. In the final 
section a few new notions which are studied for near-rings and seminear-rings are 
studied in case of S-seminear-rings and S-near-rings.  
 
 
8.1 Smarandache non-associative seminear-ring and its properties  
 
In this section we just define the notion of S-NA-seminear-ring and introduce several 
properties enjoyed by these structures to S-seminear-ring. This study is interesting and 
innovative as this gives a new class of non-associative seminear-rings. To the best our 
knowledge no one has introduced non-associative seminear-rings; only study of 
seminear-ring have been carried out by researchers.  
 
DEFINITION 8.1.1: Let (N, ‘+’, ‘.’) be a non-empty set endowed with two binary 
operation ‘+’ and ‘.’ satisfying the following: 
 
a. (N, +) is a semigroup. 
b. (N, .) is a groupoid. 
c. (a + b) c = a.c + b.c for all a, b, c ∈ N; (N, ‘+’, ‘.’) is called the right 
seminear-ring which is non-associative.  
 
If we replace (c) by a. (b + c) = a.b + a.c for all a, b, c ∈ N Then (N, ‘+’, ‘.’) is a 
non-associative left seminear-ring.  
 
We in this text denote by (N, +, .) a non-associative right seminear-ring and by default 
of notation call N just a non-associative seminear-ring. The theory of right or left 
seminear-ring runs completely parallel in both cases. (N, .) will be only groupoids and 
never semigroups for we assume non-associativity of seminear-rings.  
 

 
126 
Example 8.1.1: Let Z2 = {0, 1} be a near-ring and G a groupoid. The groupoid near-
ring Z2G is a non-associative near-ring. In view of this we have the following.  
 
Example 8.1.2: All non-associative near-rings are non-associative seminear-rings.  
 
Example 8.1.3: Let Z12 = {0, 1, 2, … , 11} be a seminear-ring with operation ‘+’ and 
‘.’. (G, .) be a groupoid given by the following table:

Z12G is a non-associative seminear-ring. For Z12G under multiplication is only a 
groupoid. We define substructures in non-associative seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 8.1.2: Let (N, +, .) be a seminear-ring which is not associative. A subset 
P of N is said to be a subseminear-ring if (P, +, .) is a seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 8.1.3: Let N be a non-associative seminear-ring. An additive 
subsemigroup A of N is called the N-subsemigroup (right N-subsemigroup) if NA ⊆ A 
(AN ⊂ A) where NA = {na / n ∈ N, a ∈ A}. 
 
DEFINITION 8.1.4: A non-empty subset I of N is called left ideal in N if  
 
i. 
(I, +) is a normal subsemigroup of (N, +). 
ii. 
n (n1 + i) + nn1 ∈ I for each i ∈ I, n, n1 ∈ N.  
 
DEFINITION 8.1.5: Let N be a non-associative seminear-ring. A nonempty subset I of 
N is called an ideal in N if  
 
i. 
I is a left ideal.  
ii. 
IN ⊂ I. 
 
DEFINITION 8.1.6: A non-associative seminear-ring N is called left bipotent if Na = 
Na2 for a in N.  
 
DEFINITION 8.1.7: A non-associative seminear-ring N is said to be a s-seminear-ring 
if a ∈ Na for each a in N.  
 
The following definitions about strictly prime ideals would be of interest when we 
develop Smarandache notions.  
 
DEFINITION 8.1.8: An ideal P (≠N) is called strictly prime if for any two N-
subsemigroups A and B of N such that AB ⊂ P then A ⊂ P or B ⊂ P.  

 
127 
 
DEFINITION 8.1.9: An ideal B of a non-associative (NA for short) seminear-ring N is 
called strictly essential if B ∩ K ≠ {0} for every non-zero N-subsemigroup K of N.  
 
DEFINITION 8.1.10: An element x in N is said to be singular if there exists a nonzero 
strictly essential left ideal A in N such that Ax = {0}.  
 
Several other analogous results existing in near-rings and seminear-rings can also be 
defined for non-associative seminear-rings. Now we proceed on to define 
Smarandache notions.  
 
DEFINITION 8.1.11: Let (N, +, .) be a non associative seminear-ring. N is said be a 
Smarandache non associative seminear-ring of level I (S-NA seminear-ring I) if  
 
i. (N, +) is a S-semigroup.  
ii. (N, .) is a S-groupoid.  
iii. (a + b) c = a.c + b.c for all a, b, c ∈ N.  
 
DEFINITION 8.1.12: Let (N, +, .) be a non-associative seminear-ring. N is said to have 
a Smarandache subseminear-ring (S-subseminear-ring) P ⊂ N if P is itself a S-
seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 8.1.13: Let (N, +, .) be a non-associative seminear-ring. An additive S-
subsemigroup A of N is called the Smarandache N-subsemigroup (S-N-subsemigroup) 
(right N-subsemigroup) if NA ⊂ A (AN ⊂ A) where Na = {na / n ∈ N, a ∈ A}.  
 
DEFINITION 8.1.14: A non-empty subset I of N is called Smarandache left ideal (S-left 
ideal) in N if  
 
1. (I, +) is a normal S-subsemigroup of (N, +).  
2. n (n1 + i) + nn1 ∈ I for each i ∈ I, n, n1 ∈ N. 
 
DEFINITION 8.1.15: Let N be a NA-seminear-ring. A nonempty subset I of N is called 
an Smarandache ideal (S-ideal) in N if  
 
i. 
I is a S-left ideal.  
ii. 
IN ⊂ I.  
 
DEFINITION 8.1.16: A S-NA-seminear-ring N is called Smarandache left bipotent (S-
left bipotent) if Na = Na2 for every a in N.  
 
THEOREM 8.1.1: Every S-NA seminear-ring N has a nontrivial seminear-ring P if and 
only if (P, +) is a semigroup and (P, .) is a semigroup.  
 
Proof: If N has P to be a seminear-ring where P ⊂ N then (P, +) and (P, .) are 
semigroups. (N, .) is a S-groupoid which is always possible. Converse is 
straightforward.  
 
THEOREM 8.1.2: Every SNA seminear-ring N has a subset P which is a near-ring if 
and only if (P, +) is a group and (P, .) is a semigroup.  

 
128 
 
Proof: This is also possible when N is a SNA-seminear-ring as (N, +) is a S-
semigroup, so has a subgroup with respect + and (N, .) is a S-groupoid so has a subset 
which is a semigroup. If the same subset N happens to be group under ‘+’ and 
semigroup ‘.’ then we have the above theorem to be true.  
 
It is pertinent to mention that only this definition of SNA seminear-ring has paved 
way for such possibilities so we can define S-seminear-ring I of type A as follows.  
 
DEFINITION 8.1.17: Let (N, +, .) be a NA seminear-ring. N is said to be a 
Smarandache seminear-ring I of type A (S-seminear-ring I of type A) if N has a 
proper subset P such that (P, +, .) is an associative seminear-ring.  
 
It is very important to note by no means we claim that the two definition SNA-
seminear-ring I and  SNA seminear-ring I of type A are equivalent. But of course it is 
an interesting problem to find under what conditions the two definitions are 
equivalent which is enlisted as suggested problems in chapter ten.  
 
DEFINITION 8.1.18: Let N be a NA-seminear-ring. N is said to be a Smarandache NA 
seminear-ring I of type B  (S-NA seminear-ring I of type B) if N has a proper subset P 
where P is a near-ring.  
 
 
We say in the definition of S-NA seminear-ring I we assumed (N, +) is a S-semigroup 
so we have (P, +) for a suitable proper subset P to be a group and since (N, .) is a S-
groupoid we have (Q, .) is a semigroup, if P = Q we see N has P to be a near-ring. 
This has forced us to define S-NA seminear-ring I of type B. It is pertinent to mention 
here that by no means we assume or state that the definitions S-NA seminear-ring I, 
S-NA seminear-ring I type B are equivalent. Thus this definitions give some what 
conditionally equivalent conditions or the Smarandache structures gives way for such 
concepts i.e. a non-associative algebraic structure containing completely an 
associative structure or more richer algebraic structure.  
 
Example 8.1.4: Let (N, +, .) be a seminear-ring and G be a groupoid. The groupoid 
seminear-ring NG is a non-associative seminear-ring. NG is S-NA-seminear-ring if 
and only if N is a S-seminear-ring.  
 
We ask the reader to obtain interesting results about S-non-associative seminear-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 8.1.19: Let N and N1 be two S-seminear-rings; we say a map φ from N to 
N1 is a Smarandache non-associative seminear ring homomorphism (S-NA seminear-
ring homomorphism) if  
 
 
φ(x + y) = φ(x) + φ(y)  
 
φ(xy) = φ(x) φ(y) for all x, y ∈ N.

8.2 Some special Smarandache NA seminear-rings of type II 
 
In this section we introduce Smarandache NA seminear-ring of type II and define 
some interesting results about them. We see that S-NA seminear-rings of type I 
happen to have a very meager property for we in the definition of  S-NA seminear-
rings of type I replace the groupoid by S-groupoids this does not make a big change 
except one of the obvious properties that these non-associative seminear-rings contain 
associative seminear-rings as substructures. Except for this we were not able to 
achieve many more properties we proceed on to define Smarandache NA seminear-
rings.  
 
DEFINITION 8.2.1: Let (N, +, .) be a NA seminear-ring, we say N is a Smarandache 
NA seminear-ring II (S-NA-seminear-ring II) if N has a proper subset P which is a 
associative seminear-ring.  
 
THEOREM 8.2.1: Let N be a S-NA seminear-ring II then N is a S-NA-seminear-ring I 
of type A.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition. Now using the S-mixed direct product 
definition of seminear-rings we can extend it to the case of non-associative seminear-
rings. This method will help to build a class of S-NA seminear-rings of type II.  
 
DEFINITION 8.2.2: Let N1, …, Nk be k seminear-rings where at least one of the 
seminear-rings is non-associative and at least one is associative. The direct product 
of these seminear-rings N = N1 × … × Nk is called the S-mixed direct product of 
seminear-rings (S-mixed direct product of seminear-rings). The operation in N is 
carried out component wise. Clearly N is a S-seminear-ring II and S-seminear-ring I 
of type A.  
 
Now we define a still a strong mixed product.  
 

 
130 
DEFINITION 8.2.3: Let N1, N2, …, Nk be a collection of near-rings, non-associative 
seminear-rings and seminear-rings. The product N = N1 × N2 × … × Nk is called the 
Smarandache strong mixed direct product (S-strong mixed direct product) of NA 
seminear-rings. Under the component wise operation on N we get N to be a NA 
seminear-ring. Clearly N is a S-NA seminear-ring I of type A and B and also S-NA 
seminear-ring II.  
 
Since these S-NA seminear-rings are non-associative structures we would be justified 
in studying the cases when these S.NA seminear-rings satisfy the special identities 
like Bol, Moufang, alternative etc. 
 
As we do not have a very large class of S.NA-seminear-rings or for that matter NA 
seminear-rings we are forced to build S.NA seminear-rings and NA seminear-rings 
only by using loops and groupoids and these newly constructed structure will be 
called as loop seminear-rings and groupoid seminear-rings. These will be non-
associative seminear-rings even if we take the seminear-rings to be associative. We 
study when these new class of NA seminear-rings satisfies these identities.  
 
To the best of the authors knowledge no researcher has studied such types of identities 
in these structures. Further in view of the author the very study of non-associative 
near-rings and seminear-rings is very meager. It is all the more important to state 
especially these non-associative seminear-rings do not find any place in any text 
books on near-rings. Even the very concept of seminear-ring is dealt very sparingly in 
some of the text books. Further as contrary to the case of ring theory where there are 
several books, in case of near-rings there are only less than a dozen text books.  
 
Thus we have tried to give the definitions as well, we have mentioned them in the 
bibliography. Now we proceed on to define the Smarandache substructures and 
Smarandache special elements in these NA seminear-rings. Throughout this section 
we only assume S-seminear-ring of level II or S-seminear-ring of level I type B.  
 
DEFINITION 8.2.4: Let N be a S-NA seminear-ring II. An additive S-semigroup A of N 
is said to be a S-left N subsemigroup (right-N subsemigroup) if PA ⊂ A and (AP ⊂ A). 
where P is a proper subset of N and P is a seminear-ring which is associative. PA = 
{pa / p ∈ P and a ∈ A}.  
 
DEFINITION 8.2.5: Let N and N1 be any two S-NA-seminear-rings A mapping φ from 
N to N1 is called a Smarandache-NA seminear-ring homomorphism (S-NA seminear-
ring homomorphism) if φ maps every p ∈ P ⊂ N (p a associative seminear-ring-
associative) into a unique element φ (p) ∈ P1 ⊂ N1 where P1 is an associative 
seminear-ring such that φ (p + p1) = φ (p) + φ (p1) and φ (p1 p2) = φ (p1) φ(p2) for 
every p1, p2 ∈ P ⊆ N.  
 
It is important to note that φ need not be defined on the whole of N it is sufficient if φ 
is defined on a subset P of N where P is an associative seminear-ring. Thus if P ⊂ N 
and P1 ⊂ N1 and φ : N → N1 is such that φ is one to one and on to from P to P1 the 
two S NA seminear-rings would become isomorphic even if they are not having same 
number of elements in them.  
 

 
131 
DEFINITION 8.2.6: Let N be a S-NA-seminear-ring. An additive S-semigroup A of N is 
said to be a Smarandache left ideal (S-left ideal) of N if it is an ideal of the semigroup 
(N, +) with the conditions.  
 
 
p1 (p2 + a) – p1 p2 ∈ A for each a ∈ A; p1, p2 ∈ P ⊂ N; P a seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 8.2.7: A subset I of N is called a S-ideal if it is a S-left ideal and IP ⊂ I 
where P ⊂ N is the associative seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 8.2.8: A S-NA seminear-ring N has Smarandache IFP (S-IFP) (insertion 
of factor property) if for a, b ∈ P, ab = 0 implies a.p.B = 0 for all p ∈ P ⊂ N since N 
is non-associative we have to restrict our selves only to the associative substructure to 
define IFP property as a (nb) ≠ (an) b in general for all a, n, b ∈ N.  
 
Now for S-NA seminear-ring of level I type B we define all the above concepts with 
the only modification we replace the seminear-ring P by the near-ring in all the 
definitions. 
 
Certainly we cannot say S-ideals in S-NA seminear-ring of level II will be the same as 
S-ideals of SNA seminear-ring I of type B even if N is both a S-NA seminear-ring II 
and S-NA-seminear-ring I type B. So all results will be different. The reader can 
verify them. We give only example.  
 
Example 8.2.1: Let N = N1 × N2 × N3 where N1 is any non-associative seminear-ring, 
N2 = Z24 where ‘×’ is the usual multiplication modulo 24 and '.' is a . b = a for all a, b 
∈ Z24 is an associative seminear-ring and N3 = Z12 where '+' is the operation i.e. 
addition modulo 12 and a.b = a for all a, b ∈ N3; clearly N3 is an associative near-ring. 
N by the very definition is a non-associative seminear-ring. Now N is a S-NA 
seminear-ring II for it has N2 as a proper subset which is an associative seminear-ring. 
N is also a S-NA seminear-ring I type B as N3 is a proper subset which is a near ring 
of N. Thus we see simultaneously N is S-NA seminear-ring II and S-NA seminear-
ring I type B. It is left for the reader to define S-ideals in them and see how they are 
different sets behaving in a distinct way, in case of S-mixed direct product of 
seminear-rings II or S-NA seminear-ring I of type B or S-NA seminear-ring I of type 
A. This is clearly evident from the example. 
 
Example 8.2.2: Let N = Z × Z15 × N1 where Z is a near-ring in which (Z, +) is a group 
and for all x, y ∈ Z; x.y = x, (Z15, '×', ‘.’) is a seminear ring under usual multiplication 
modulo 15 and ‘.’ as a.b = a for all a, b ∈ Z15 and N1 some non-associative seminear-
ring. N is a S-NA seminear-ring II and S-NA seminear-ring I of type B. 
 
From these examples we are not still in a position to find natural examples of NA 
seminear-ring, we have a class of associative seminear-ring given by Zn where (Zn, x) 
is a semigroup under multiplication modulo n and a.b = a for all a, b ∈ Zn. Thus the 
section 4 is completely devoted to finding a class of NA seminear-rings.

8.3 Smarandache Non-Associative near-rings  
 
In this section we introduce the concept of Smarandache non-associative ring and also 
study about the near loop ring introduced in chapter 3 to be S-near-ring. Several 
interesting Smarandache concepts are introduced. Here also we once again mention 
loop near-rings and near loop rings are different for the former has ‘+’ to be non-
associative where as in the later ‘+’ is associative but ‘.’ happens to be non-associative 
and the near loop rings are built using a loop and a near-ring. Finally we also 
introduce the identities newly to the near-ring which are non-associative. We 
introduce the concept of Smarandache right loop-half groupoid near-ring which is the 
most generalized concept of loop near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.1: The system N = (N, ‘+’, ‘.’ 0) is called a Smarandache right loop 
half groupoid near-ring (S-right loop half groupoid near-ring) provided.  
 
1. (N, +, 0) is a Smarandache loop.  
 
2. (N, '.') is a half groupoid.  
 
3. (n1.n2).n3 = n1.(n2.n3) for all n1, n2 n3 ∈ N for which n1.n2, n2.n3, (n1.n-
2).n3 and n1.(n2.n3) ∈ N.  

 
133 
 
4. (n1 + n2) n3 = n1.n3 + n2.n3 for all n1, n2, n3 ∈ N for which (n1 + n2).n3, 
n1.n3 , n2.n3 ∈ N. If instead of (4) in N the identity n1.(n2 + n3) = n1.n2 
+ n1.n3 is satisfied then we say N is a Smarandache left half groupoid 
near-ring (S-left half groupoid near-ring).  
 
We just say (L, +) is a S-loop if L has a proper subset P such that (P, +) is an additive 
group.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.2: A Smarandache right loop near-ring (S-right loop near-ring) N is 
a system (N, +, .) of double composition ‘+’ and ‘.’ such that  
 
1. (N, +) is a S-loop.  
2. (N, .) is a S-semigroup.  
3. The multiplication ‘.’ is right distributive over addition i.e. for all n1, n2, n3 
∈ N (n1 + n2).n3 = n1.n3 + n2.n3.  
 
THEOREM 8.3.1: Let N be a S-right loop near-ring then N is a S-right loop half 
groupoid near-ring.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definitions.  
 
THEOREM 8.3.2: Let N be a S-right loop half groupoid near-ring, then N is not in 
general a S-right loop near-ring. 
 
Proof: Obvious. (N, .) is only a half groupoid so it can never be a S-semigroup.  
 
Example 8.3.1: Every S-near-ring is a S-loop near-ring.  
 
THEOREM 8.3.3: Let N be a S-loop near-ring. Then N contains a proper subset P such 
that (P, +) is a group and (P, .) is a semigroup so that P is a near-ring.  
 
Proof: By the very definition of S-loop near-ring we have (N, +) is a S-loop so N has 
a proper subset P which is a group under ‘+’ Now (P, +, .) is near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.3: Let (G, +, 0) be a S-loop and ∆ be a S-groupoid of G. A set of all 
endomorphism of G is called a Smarandache ∆ centralizer (S-∆ centralizer) of G 
provided.  
 
1. The zero endomorphism ô ∈ S. 
2. S / ô (complement of ô in S) is a group of automorphisms of G. 
3. φ (∆) ⊂ ∆ for all φ ∈ S. 
4. φ, ψ ∈ S and φ (ω) = ψ (ω) for some ô ≠ ω ∈ ∆ imply φ = ψ.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.4: Let (G, +, 0) be a S-loop. Let ∆ be a subset of G which is a S-
groupoid of G and S a S-∆ centralizer of G. A mapping T of G into itself is called a 
Smarandache ∆ - transformation (S-∆ - transformation) of G over S provided T [φ 
(ω)] = φ[T (ω) for all ω ∈ ∆ and φ ∈ S. It is interesting to note that if 0 ∈ ∆ and T is 
a S - ∆ transformation of G over S then T fixes 0 i.e. T (0 ) = (0 ). We shall denote the 

 
134 
set of all S - ∆ transformations of G over S by S(N (S, ∆)). Further we see for any 
endomorphism φ of a S-loop G, [φ (g)]r = φ (gr) for all g ∈ G.  
 
The reader is requested to prove the following theorem:  
 
THEOREM 8.3.4: Let (G, +, 0) be a S-loop. ∆ a subgroup of G which is a groupoid 
containing 0  and S a S-∆-centralizer of G. Then S(N (S, ∆)) is not a S-loop near-ring 
or even a loop near-ring (The operation on S (N (S, ∆)) being usual addition and 
composition of mappings).

here ‘0’ is the additive identity. S-zero symmetric loop near-ring will be denoted by 
S(No ).  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.7: A S-loop near-ring N is said to be a S-near-ring if N contains a 
proper subset P such that (P, +, .) is a near-field.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.8: An element a of a S-loop near-ring N is said to be a Smarandache 
left (right) zero divisor (S-left (right) zero divisor) in N if there is an element b ≠ 0 in 
N with a.b = 0    (b . a = 0) and there exist x, y ∈ S \ {a, b, 0}, x ≠ y with 
  
1. a . x = 0 (xa = 0). 
2. by = 0  (yb = 0). 
3. xy ≠ 0 (yx ≠ 0).

Smarandache two sided zero divisor or simply a Smarandache zero divisor (S-zero 
divisor) in N.

θ (n1 n2) = θ (n1) θ (n2)  
 
for every n1, n2 ∈ P ⊂ N where (P, +, .) is a near-ring and φ (n1), φ (n2) ∈ P1 where 
(P1, +, .) is a near-ring of N1. 
 
DEFINITION 8.3.10: Let N be a S-loop near-ring. An additive S-subloop A of N is 
called a N-subloop (right N-subloop) if NA ⊂ A (AN ⊂ A) where NA = {na / n ∈ N 
and a ∈ A}.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.11: A nonempty subset I of a S-near-ring N is called a Smarandache 
left ideal (S-left ideal) in N if  

 
135 
 
1. (I, +) is a S-normal subloop of (N, +). 
2. n (n1 + i) + nr n1 ∈ I for each i ∈ I and n, n1 ∈ N where nr denotes the

DEFINITION 8.3.12: A nonempty subset I of N is called a Smarandache ideal (S-ideal) 
of N if

2. IN ⊂ I. 
 
DEFINITION 8.3.13: A S-loop near-ring N is said to be Smarandache left bipotent (S-
left bipotent) if Na = Na2 for every a in N.

Let ‘.’ be defined on N by x.y = x for every x, y ∈ N. (N, +, .) is a S-loop near-ring. 
For P = {e, c} is a S-loop. Clearly Na2 = Na for every a ∈ N. Thus N is a S-left 
bipotent loop near-ring.

Every pair (0, a) is a group so (N, +) is a S-loop. (N, .) is a S-semigroup as {a} is a 
group. Thus (N, +, .) is a S-s-loop near-ring.  
 

 
136 
DEFINITION 8.3.15: A S-loop near-ring N is said to be Smarandache regular (S-
regular) if for each a in N there exists x in P (P ⊂ N), P a S-loop such that a = axa.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.16: Let N be a near-ring. An element e ∈ N is said to be 
Smarandache idempotent (S-idempotent) in N if  
 
1. e2 = e. 
2. There exists b ∈ N \ {e} such that b2 = e and eb = b (be = b) or (be = e or 
eb = e).  
 
THEOREM 8.3.5: All S-idempotents in S-loop near-rings are also idempotents and 
non-conversely.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 8.3.6: Let N be a S-s-loop near-ring, then N is S-regular if and only if for 
each a (≠0) in N there exists a S-idempotent e such that Na = Ne.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.17: A S-loop near-ring N is said to be Smarandache strictly duo (S-
strictly duo) if every S-N-subloop (S-left ideal) is also a S-right N-subloop (S-right 
ideal).  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.18: For any subset A of a S-loop near-ring N we define,
A  = {x ∈ N 
/ xn ∈ A for some n}.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.19: A S-loop near-ring N is called Smarandache irreducible (S-
irreducible) (S-simple) if it contains only the trivial S-N-subloops (S-ideals) (0) and N 
itself.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.20: A loop near-ring N is called a S-loop near-field.  
 
1. if N is a S-loop near-ring.  
2. if P ⊆ N contains an identity and each non-zero element in P ⊂ N, {(P, +) a 
group} has a multiplicative inverse.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.21: An S-ideal P (≠N) is called Smarandache strictly prime (S-strictly 
prime) if for any two S-N-subloops (S-ideals) A and B of N such that AB ⊂ P then A ⊂ 
P or B ⊂ P.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.22: As left ideal B of a S-loop near-ring N is called Smarandache 
strictly essential (S-strictly essentail) if B ∩ K ≠ {0} for any non zero S-N-subloop K 
of N.  
 
An element x in N is said to be Smarandache non-singular (S-non-singular) if there 
exists a S-strictly essential left ideal A in N such that Ax = {0}.  
 

 
137 
DEFINITION 8.3.23: An element x of a S-loop near-ring N is said to be Smarandache 
central (S-central) if xy = yx for all y ∈ P ⊂ N, (P, +, .) is a near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.24: A nonzero S-loop near-ring N is said to be Smarandache 
subdirectly irreducible (S-subdirectly irreducible) if the intersection of all the nonzero 
S-ideals of N is non-zero.  
 
Now we study when are loops over near-rings i.e. near loop rings interminology 
Smarandache near loop rings, as loop near-rings are not non associative near-ring 
analogous to non associative ring; we proceed to define here the concept of 
Smarandache non associative near-rings first in the following:  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.25: Let (N, +, .) be a nonempty set. N is said to be a Smarandache 
non-associative near-ring (S-NA-near-rings) if the following conditions are satisfied.  
 
1. (N, +) is a S-semigroup.  
2. (N, .) is a S-groupoid.  
3. (a + b) c = ac + bc for all a, b, c ∈ N.  
 
If (N, +, .) has an element 1 such that a.1 = 1.a = a for all a ∈ N, we call N a S-non 
associative near-ring with unit. If (N, .) is a S-loop; barring 0 we call N a 
Smarandache non-associative division near-ring (S-NA-division near-ring).  
 
If N \ {0] is commutative S-loop under the operation ‘.’ we call N a Smarandache 
non-associative near-field (S-NA near-field).  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.26: Let N be a near-ring; L a loop the near loop ring NL is a 
Smarandache near loop ring (S-near loop ring) if  
 
1. N is a S-near-ring.  
2. L is a S-loop.  
 
THEOREM 8.3.7: Let N be a S-near ring and L a S-Moufang loop. Then the near loop 
ring NL is a S-moufang near loop ring.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader as an exercise.  
 
Example 8.3.4: Let Z2 = {0, 1} be a near-ring and L be a S-loop.  
 
The near loop ring Z2L is a S-near-ring where the S-loop is given by the following 
table:  
 
. 
e 
a1 
a2 
a3 
a4 
a5

Now Z2L = {1, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, sums taken 2 at a time …} where 1.e = e.1 = 1 is the 
assumption made so that 1 acts as the identity. When we say Z2L is a near loop ring 
we assume L ⊂ Z2L . Clearly Z2L is a non-associative near-ring and it is a S-near-
ring.  
 
THEOREM 8.3.8: Let L be a loop and N be a S-near-ring. NL is a S-near-ring which is 
non-associative.  
 
Proof: Follows from the fact N ⊂ NL and L ⊂ NL and as L is non-associative and N 
is a S-near-ring NL is a S-near-ring.  
 
THEOREM 8.3.9: Let L be any loop and N any near-ring. The near loop ring NL is a 
S-non-associative near-ring.  
 
Proof: Follows from the fact (NL, +) is a group; hence trivially a S-semigroup and 
(NL, .) is a S-groupoid as N ⊂ NL is a semigroup. Hence the claim.  
 
Now we will study when the class of S-non-associative near-rings are Moufang, Bol, 
etc.  
 
THEOREM 8.3.10: Let N be a near-ring and L a Moufang loop then the near loop ring 
is a S-Moufang near-ring.  
 
Proof: Follows from the fact (N, .) is a associative semigroup and L is a Moufang 
loop.  
 
Corollary: Let N be near-ring and L not a Moufang loop; N the near loop ring is not a 
S-Moufang near-ring.  
 
Thus we can say if we take any near-ring N with 1 and L to be a special type of loop 
say Bol, alternative … then NL will be correspondingly the special type of near-ring 
Bol, alternative, … 
 
But even if L is a Bruck loop the near loop ring NL will not be a Bruck loop. NL will 
be not a Bruck near-ring even if N is a near-field and L a Bruck loop.  
 
Now we have introduced in chapter one a new class of loops Ln which will be a class 
of non-associative S-loops which are alternative, power associative and their near 
loop rings are S-near loop rings if the near-ring is a S-near-ring.  
 
THEOREM 8.3.11: Let Z2L be a near loop near of the S-loop L over Z2. Let L be a 
power associative loop. Then the near loop ring Z2L in general is not a power 
associative near-ring.  
 
Proof: Every element in Z2L need not generate a subgroup.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.27: Let N be a non-associative loop near-ring. We say N is a 
additively power associative loop near-ring if every element under ‘+’ of N generates 

 
139 
a group. The near-ring N is said to be a multiplicatively power associative loop near-
ring if every element different from 0 generates a group under product. A loop near-
ring N is said to be power associative near-ring if  
 
1. Every element n ∈ N under '+'  generates a group.  
2. Every element n ∈ N \ {0} under ‘×’ or ‘.’ generates a group.  
 
THEOREM 8.3.12: A loop near-ring N is a power associative near-ring then  
 
1. N is an additively power associative near-ring.  
2. N is multiplicatively a power associative near-ring.  
 
Proof: Straightforward by the very definitions.  
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache power associative near-ring Smarandache 
additively power associative near-ring and Smarandache multiplicatively power 
associative near-ring. Before we go for Smarandache notions it is important to 
observe that if N is not a loop near-ring but a non-associative near-ring then the 
concept “additively power associative” has no meaning. So while defining the concept 
of power associative for non-associative near-ring we define only just power 
associative; likewise even in case of near loop rings we define only power associative. 
Only for loop near-ring when we talk of Smarandache concepts we may talk of the 
notion of additively power associative.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.28: Let N be a non-associative near-ring. We say N is power 
associative if every element of N \ {0} generates a group with respect to.   
 
DEFINITION 8.3.29: Let N be a non-associative seminear-ring, we say N is a power 
associative seminear-ring if every element in N generates a semigroup under 
multiplication.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.30: Let N be a non-associative seminear-ring we say N is a 
Smarandache power associative (S-power asoociative) if (N, .) has a proper subset P 
where P is a S-subgroupoid of N and P is power associative i.e. every element p ∈ P 
generates a semigroup.  
 
It is important to note that even if (N, ‘+’, ‘.’) is a S-seminear-ring which is still non-
associative it may be the case (N, .) has no proper S-subgroupoids so the non-
associative seminear-ring may fail to become S-power associative.  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.31: Let (N, +, .) be a S-non-associative near-ring we say N is 
Smarandache power associative (S-power associative) if (N, .) has a proper subset 
which has a S-subgroupoid P such that every element p ∈ P is power associative i.e., 
every element in p generates a semigroup.  
 
Now the four definitions of power associative for non-associative near-rings, non-
associative seminear-rings S-NA-near-rings and S-NA-seminear-rings can be made on 
similar lines for “diassociative”.  
 

 
140 
Thus we will say a non-associative near-ring (seminear-ring) is diassociative if every 
pair of elements generates a group (semigroup). This notion is modified to S-NA-
near-rings and S-NA seminear-rings in an analogous way.  
 
We stop at this stage and propose problems for the reader to solve and obtain class of 
such near-rings as this is the first time such type of study has been carried out for S-
near-ring and S-seminear-ring which are non-associative. We give examples and a 
class of Smarandache right alternative near-ring (S-right alternative near-rings) (left 
alternative near-rings) and Smarandache WIP near-rings (S-WIP near-rings).  
 
DEFINITION 8.3.32: Let (N, +, .) be a non-associative near-ring (or a seminear-ring) 
N is said to be Smarandache NA WIP-seminear-ring (S-NA-WIP seminear-ring); if N 
has S-subgroup P (S-subgroupoid) such that every set of x, y, z ∈ P satisfies (xy) z = e 
imply x (yz) = e. 
 
Similar Smarandache notions can be defined for non-associative near-rings and non-
associative seminear-rings like right (left) alternative, Bol, moufang etc.  
 
PROBLEMS: 
 
1. What is the order of the smallest loop near-ring? 
2. Can a near loop ring be of order less than 25? 
3. Give examples of S-non-associative seminear-ring which is S-Moufang seminear-
ring.

8.4 Smarandache loop seminear-rings and Smarandache groupoid 
seminear-rings.  
 
In this section we introduce two new classes of non-associative seminear-rings which 
is define as Smarandache loop seminear-rings and Smarandache groupoid seminear-
rings. We know the class of loop seminear-rings is a generalization of group 
seminear-rings and loop near-rings. In fact groupoid seminear-rings happens to be 
most generalized class of non-associative seminear-rings which contains all these 
classes of seminear-rings. We are more interested in the study of their Smarandache 
nature. The concept of classical identities plays a vital role when the structure under 
study happens to be non-associative. With the advent of a new class of loops of even 
order and new class of groupoids of all order built using integers we are able to give 
examples which are concrete.  
 
One of the major drawbacks in the study of near-rings or any algebraic structure is the 
lack of concrete examples. Unless we have concrete examples it becomes difficult to 
make the subject or that algebraic structure profoundly attractive to many researchers. 
For instance, the research in ring theory or group theory or semigroup theory are 
carried out by more researchers when compared to the theory of loop, theory of 
groupoid. So in this section we introduce the Smarandache analogue of these concepts 
and try our level best to illustrate them whenever possible with examples.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.1: Let (N, +, .) be a non-empty set, N endowed with two binary 
operation ‘+’ and ‘.’ satisfying the following conditions.  
 
1. (N, +) is a semigroup.  
2. (N, .) is a groupoid. 
3. (a + b).c = a.c + b.c for a, b, c ∈ N.  
 
(N, +, .) is defined as a non-associative seminear-ring (NA seminear-ring).  
 
But one of the major draw backs is that we do not have several examples of these 
seminear-rings; so it has become difficult to give examples using Zp alone or Z alone 
or any of the known sets. Thus to obtain examples of non-associative seminear-rings 
we define loop seminear ring and groupoid seminear rings which has been defined in 
chapter 3.  
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache NA seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.2: Let N be a non-empty set. Define two binary operations ‘+’ and ‘.’ 
satisfying the following conditions  
 
1. (N, +) is a S-semigroup.  
2. (N, .) is a S-groupoid.  
3. (a + b).c = a.c + b.c for all a, b, c ∈ N then we call N a Smarandache NA 
seminear-ring of level I (S-NA seminear-ring of level I).  
 
Now we define S-NA seminear-ring of level II.

DEFINITION 8.4.3: Let (N, +, .) be a non-associative seminear-ring we say N is a 
Smarandache NA seminear-ring of level II (S-NA-seminear-ring of level II). If N has a 
proper subset P ⊂ N where (P, +, .) is a non-associative near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.4: Let (N, +, .) be a NA near-ring. N is said to be a Smarandache 
pseudo NA seminear-ring (S-pseudo NA-seminear-ring), if N has a proper subset P 
such that P is a non-associative seminear-ring under the operations of N.  
 
Now still we have a level III and level IV definition of Smarandache NA seminear-
rings.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.5: Let N be a NA-seminear-ring. We say N is a Smarandache NA 
seminear-ring of level III (S-NA-seminear-ring III); if N has a proper subset P where 
P is an associative seminear-ring.  
 
Finally we define Smarandache seminear-ring of level IV and obtain the possible and 
probable relation between the four levels of S-NA seminear-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.6: Let (N, +, .) be a NA seminear-ring we say N is a Smarandache 
NA seminear-ring of level IV (S-NA-seminear-ring of level IV) if N has a proper 
subset P such that (P, +, .) is an associative near-ring.  
 
THEOREM 8.4.1: Let (N, +, .) be a S-NA seminear-ring IV then (N, +, .) is a S-NA 
seminear-ring III.  
 
Proof: Follows directly by the very definitions of level III and level IV, S-NA 
seminear-rings.  
 
It is left as an exercise for the reader to construct a S.NA seminear-ring of level III 
which is not a S-NA-semiring of level IV. Thus we see the class of S-NA seminear-
rings of level IV is strictly contained in the class of S-NA seminear-rings of level III.  
 
THEOREM 8.4.2: Let (N, +, .) be a S.NA seminear-ring IV then (N, +, .) is a S-NA 
seminear-ring II.  
 
Proof: Obvious from the fact the class of all associative near-rings is contained in the 
class of non-associative near-rings (as for example we have every group is a loop and 
not vice versa).  
 
Thus we see the class of SA seminear-ring IV is strictly contained in the class of S-
NA seminear-ring II. It is easily seen that a S-NA seminear-ring II can in general 
never be a S-NA seminear-ring IV.  
 
Now we proceed on to define concepts like S-subseminear-ring S-ideal etc.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.7: Let (N, +, .) be a NA seminear-ring we say a proper subset S of N 
is called a Smarandache subseminear-ring I (II or III or IV) (S-subseminear-ring Ior 
II or III or IV), if (S, +, .) is a S-NA seminear-ring I (II or III or IV respectively).  
 
From this we have the following.  

 
143 
 
THEOREM 8.4.3: Let (N, +, .) be a NA-seminear-ring, if N has a S-NA subseminear-
ring I (II or III or IV) then N is a S-NA seminear-ring I (II or III or IV).  
 
Proof: Follows from the very definition and the proof is straightforward.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.8: Let (N, +, .) be a NA seminear-ring. A non-empty subset I of N is 
called a Smarandache left ideal I (S-left ideal I) in N if  
 
1. (I, +) is a S-subsemigroup of (N, +). 
2. n (n1 + i) + nn1 ∈ I for each i ∈ I and n, n1 ∈ N.  
 
If IN ⊂ I then I is called the Smarandache ideal I (S-ideal I) of N.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.9: Let (N, +, .) be a NA seminear-ring. We call a nonempty subset I of 
N to be a Smarandache left ideal II (S-left ideal II) of N if  
 
1. (I, +) is a S-subsemigroup.  
2. n (n1 + I) + nn1 ∈ I for all n1, n ∈ P ⊂ N (where P is a non-associative 
near-ring) and i ∈ I.  
 
I is called a Smarandache ideal II (S-ideal II) if IP ⊂ I.  
 
Now we define Smarandache left ideal III and IV by replacing P in the definition by 
an associative seminear-ring or by an associative near-ring respectively. The reader is 
advised to obtain relations between S-ideals I, II, III and IV whenever they exist and 
obtain some interesting results in this direction.  
 
Now we give examples so that the reader is made to understand the concept in a better 
way.  
 
Example 8.4.1: Let Z6 = {0, 1, 2, …, 5}. Define ‘×’ and ‘.’ on Z6 by; ‘×’ is the usual 
multiplication modulo 6 and ‘.’ is defined by a.b = a for all a, b ∈ Z6. Let G be a 
groupoid with 1. The groupoid near-ring Z6G is a S-NA near-ring III as Z6 ⊂ Z6G.  
 
THEOREM 8.4.4: Let N be a seminear-ring and G any groupoid with 1 the groupoid 
seminear-ring NG is a S-NA seminear-ring III.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very construction; we see N ⊂ Na and N is a seminear-ring 
which is associative so NG is a S-NA seminear-ring III.  
 
Example 8.4.2: Let N be any near-ring and G a groupoid with 1. The groupoid near-
ring NG is a S-NA seminear-ring IV clearly from the fact N ⊆ NG.  
 
THEOREM 8.4.5: Let N be a near-ring and G any groupoid with 1. The groupoid near-
ring is a S-NA seminear-ring IV.  
 
Proof: Straightforward by the very definition.  
 

 
144 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache bipotent seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.10: Let N be a seminear-ring. We say N is Smarandache left bipotent 
II (S-left bipotent II) if Pa = Pa2 where P is a non-associative near-ring in N i.e. P ⊂  
N and (P, +, .) is a near-ring. Smarandache left bipotent III (S-left bipotent III) if Pa 
= Pa2 where P is an associative seminear-ring. Smarandache left bipotent IV (S-left 
bipotent IV) if Pa = Pa2 where P is an associative near-ring. Now we have N to be a 
Smarandache left bipotent I (S-left bipotent I) if N is a S-NA seminear-ring with Na = 
Na2. 
 
Similarly we define Smarandache s-seminear-ring in the following.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.11: Let (N, +, .) be a NA seminear-ring we say N is a Smarandache s-
seminear-ring I (S-s-seminear-ring I) if a ∈ Na where N is a S-NA near-ring I.  
 
N is said to be Smarandache s-seminear-ring II (S-s-seminear-ring II), if a ∈ Pa for 
each a ∈ N where P is a non-associative near-ring contained in P.  
 
N is said to be a Smarandache s-seminear-ring III (IV) (S-s-seminear-ring III (IV)) if 
a ∈ Pa, P is associative seminear-ring (associative near-ring). We see that if N is a S-
s-seminear-ring II III or IV then it is a S-seminear-ring.  
 
The proof of the next theorem is straightforward and left for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 8.4.6: Let N be a NA seminear-ring. If N is a Smarandache s-seminear-
ring II, III or IV then N is a S-NA s-seminear-ring.  
 
Now for the seminear ring N to be S-s-seminear-ring I we need N to be S-seminear-
ring. Hence above theorem has no relevance in case of S-NA seminear-ring I.  
 
Obtain interesting interrelations between S-bipotent and S-s-seminear-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.12: A seminear-ring N is said to be Smarandache regular I (S-
regular I) if for each a ∈ N there exists a x ∈S (where S is a proper subset of N and S 
is a S-subseminear-ring of N) such that a = axa.  
 
We define Smarandache regular seminear-ring II (III or IV) (S-regular seminear-ring 
II (III or IV)) by stating for each a ∈ N their exist x ∈ S; S a non-associative near-
ring (S an associative seminear-ring or S an associative near-ring) such that a = axa.  
 
All results related with this concept can be derived for S-seminear-rings. The 
following important conclusion is formulated as the theorem.  
 
THEOREM 8.4.7: Let N be a NA-seminear-ring, if N is S-regular II III or IV then 
clearly N is a S-seminear-ring.  
 
Proof: It is straightforward and hence left for the reader to prove.  
 

 
145 
DEFINITION 8.4.13: Let N be a NA seminear-ring. N is said to have Smarandache 
insertion of factors property II, III or IV (S-IFP-II,III or IV for short) if for a, b ∈ N 
we have a.b = 0 implies anb = 0, for all n ∈ P;  where P ⊂ N and P is a non-
associative seminear-ring. S-IFP-III if P is an associative seminear-ring and S-IFP-
IV if P is an associative near-ring.  
 
The following theorem is left as an exercise for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 8.4.8: Let N be a NA seminear-ring if N satisfies a S-IFP II (III or IV) then 
N is a S-NA IFP seminear-ring II (III or IV).  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.14: Let N and N1 be any two S seminear-rings; we say a map θ from 
N to N1 is a S-seminear-ring homomorphism I: If θ (x + y) = θ(x) + θ(y) and θ (xy) = 
θ(x). θ(y) for all x, y ∈ N. θ from N to N1 is a S-seminear-ring homomorphism II if θ 
(x + y) = θ(x) + θ(y), θ (xy) = θ(x)θ(y), where θ is a near-ring homomorphism from P 
to P1 where P ⊂ N is a non-associative near-ring and P1 ⊂ N1 is a non-associative 
near-ring contained in N1; θ need not be even defined on  whole of N or N1. θ from N 
to N1 is said to be S-seminear-ring homomorphism III if θ : P → P1 is a seminear-ring 
homomorphism where P ⊂ N and P1 ⊂ N1 are associative seminear-rings properly 
contained in N and N1 respectively. θ need not be defined entirely on N. θ from N to 
N1 is a S-seminear-ring homomorphism IV if θ : P → P1 is a near-ring 
homomorphism from P to P1 where P and P1 are proper subsets of N and N1 
respectively and they are associative near-rings.  
 
Now S-isomorphism I, II, III and IV can be defined as in the case of other algebraic 
structures. The uniqueness about S-homomorphism is the map need not be defined on 
the entire seminear-ring, if it is sectionally well defined on a substructure it is enough. 
Further we see that two NA seminear-rings can be S-isomorphic even without their 
cardinality being equal. Yet the Smarandache property always allows us for such 
identifications or to get isomorphism without being really identical.  
 
Thus it is enough if a substructure happens to be identical, Smarandache notions 
declare them to be Smarandache identical.  
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache N-subsemigroup.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.15: Let N be a NA seminear-ring we say A ⊂ N, A a S-subsemigroup 
to be a Smarandache N-(right) subsemigroup I (II or III or IV) if  
 
1. NA ⊂ A (AN ⊂ A) where N is a S-seminear-ring I.  
2. A ⊂ N is said to be S-(right) N-subsemigroup II if PA ⊂ A (AP ⊂ A) (where P 
⊂ N, P is a NA near-ring).  
3. A ⊂ N is said to be a S-(right) N-subsemigroup III if PA ⊂ A (AP ⊂ A) (where 
P is an associative seminear-ring).  
4. A ⊂ N is said to be a S-(right) N-subsemigroup IV if PA ⊂ A (AP ⊂ A) if P is 
an associative near-ring.  
 
The following theorem is direct.  
 

 
146 
THEOREM 8.4.9: If N is a seminear-ring having a S-right N-subsemigroup (I, II, III or 
IV) then N is a S-seminear-ring (I II III or IV) respectively.  
 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader to prove.  
 
At this juncture the author leaves it open for the reader to obtain interesting and 
innovative inter relative results about this concept.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.16: A non-associative seminear-ring N is said to be Smarandache 
irreducible (Smarandache simple) (S-irreducible or S-simple) if it contains only the 
trivial S-N-subsemigroups (S-ideals).  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.17: A S-left ideal B of a N.A seminear-ring N is called Smarandache 
essential (S-essential) if B ∩ K ≠ {0} for every non-zero S-N-subsemigroup K of N.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.18: An element x in N is said to be Smarandache singular (S-
singular) if there exists a nonzero S-strictly essential left ideal A of N such that Ax = 
{0}.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.19: An element x of a NA seminear-ring of N is said to be 
Smarandache central (S-central) if xy = yx for every y ∈ P; P ⊂ N and P is a non-
associative near-ring or P is an associative seminear-ring or P is an associative near-
ring.  
 
In view of this we have the following theorem:  
 
THEOREM 8.4.10: Let N be a NA seminear-ring if x ∈ N is S-central then N is a S-
seminear-ring of one of the types.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove as the result is straightforward.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.20: A nonzero NA seminear –ring N is said to be Smarandache 
subdirectly irreducible (S-subdirectly irreducible) if the intersection of all nonzero S-
ideals of N is non-zero.  
 
Throughout this section by NL we denote the loop seminear-ring of a loop L over a 
seminear-ring N, N need not be even non-associative we take N to be only an 
associative seminear-ring but we see by all means the loop seminear-ring NL happens 
to be only a non-associative seminear-ring. We take only loops to be from the new 
class of loops in Ln, defined in chapter one.  
 
We define the generalized class of non-associative seminear-ring namely groupoid 
seminear-rings which we denote by NG; here N is a seminear-ring and G is a 
groupiod. We will discuss only the groupoids from the new class of groupoids 
mentioned in the chapter one. Before we enumerate these properties we define S-
idempotents, S-units and S-zero divisors in NA seminear-rings. We do not demand 
the seminear-ring to be S-seminear-ring. Even if we have defined those earlier we 
recall it so that it will be used by the reader in finding S-zero divisors, S-units, S-
idempotents etc in case of the groupoid seminear-ring NG and the loop seminear-ring 
NL.  

 
147 
 
DEFINITION 8.4.21: Let N be a seminear-ring not necessarily associative. We say a, b 
∈ N is a Smarandache zero divisor (S-zero divisor) if a.b = 0 and there exists x, y ∈ N 
\ {a, b, 0}; x ≠ y with  
 
 
1. ax = 0 or  xa = 0,  
 
2. by = 0 or  yb = 0 and  
 
3. xy ≠ 0 or  
yx ≠ 0.  
 
THEOREM 8.4.11: If x, y ∈ N is a S-zero divisor then it is a zero divisor.  
 
Proof: Direct by the very definition.  
 
The reader is requested to construct an example of a zero divisor in a non-associative 
near-ring N which is not a S-zero divisor.  
 
Example 8.4.3: Let N = {0, 1} be a near-ring and G be a groupoid given by the 
following table:

Does the groupoid near-ring Z2G have zero divisors? 
 
DEFINITION 8.4.22: Let N be a non-associative near-ring. We say an element 1 ≠ x ∈ 
N is said to be Smarandache unit (S-unit) in N if there exists y ∈ N with xy = 1. There 
exists a, b ∈ N \ {x, y, 1} such that  
 
i. 
xa = y (or ax = y) or  
ii. 
yb = x (or by = x) and  
iii. 
ab = 1.  
 
Clearly it can be proved every S-unit is a unit and not conversely.  
 
Does the group seminear-ring Z2G have S-units? 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache idempotents (S-idempotents).  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.23: Let N be a non-associative seminear-ring. An element 0 ≠ x ∈ N 
is a S-idempotent of N if  
 
1. x2 = x. 
2. There exists a y ∈ S \ {x} such that  

 
148 
i. 
y2 = x and  
ii. 
xy = y (yx = y) or xy = x (yx = x).  
 
‘or’ in the mutually exclusive sense.  
 
The study of the existence of S-idempotents in seminear-rings happens to be an 
interesting problem as the notion of central idempotents is used to define 
decomposition of S-seminear-rings IV.  
 
THEOREM 8.4.12: Let N be a S-NA seminear-ring IV. If P ⊂ N be the near-ring and e 
∈ P is an idempotent of P then we get pierce decomposition which we choose to call 
as Smarandache pierce decomposition (S-pierce decompostition) of N. i.e. every p ∈ 
P ⊂ N has a decomposition of the form p = (p – pe) + pe. 
 
Proof: Straightforward.  
 
The S-pierce decomposition of a NA seminear-ring, N is defined only when N is a S-
seminear-ring of level IV and e is a nontrivial idempotent in P, P ⊂ N; P a near-ring 
contained in N. Several results in this direction are left for the reader to develop. We 
end this section by introducing Smarandache identities like Bruck, Bol, Moufang, 
WIP and alternative (left) right for the seminear-ring. We give definition for one of 
the identity, the definition for all other identities can be analogously defined in a 
similar way. We define only for Moufang identity, it is stated in a similar way for Bol, 
WIP alternative etc.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.24: Let N be a seminear-ring. We say N is a Smarandache Moufang 
seminear-ring I (S-Moufang seminear-ring I) if N is a S-seminear-ring of level I and 
N is itself a Moufang seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 8.4.25: Let N be a seminear-ring we say N is a Smarandache Moufang 
seminear-ring of level II (S-Moufang seminear-ring of level II) if for all x, y z ∈ P, (P 
⊂ N where P is a non-associative near-ring) we have (xy) (zx) = (x (yz)) x . 
 
We see S-Moufang seminear-ring cannot be defined in case of S-seminear-ring of 
level of III and IV in an analogous way. Thus we do not define S-Moufang seminear-
ring III or IV. Now in a very similar way level I and II Smarandache Bol, WIP, 
alternative seminear-rings are defined.  
 
Example 8.4.4: Let Z2 = {0, 1} be the near-field and G be a groupoid given by the 
following table:  
.

We declare 1.g = g.1 = g for all g ∈ G. Is Z2G S-right alternative or S-left alternative?  
 
Example 8.4.5: Z9 = {0, 1, 2, …, 8} define ‘×’ multiplication modulo 9. a.b = a for all 
a, b ∈ Z9 {Z9, ‘×’, ‘.’} is a seminear-ring and G be a groupoid given by the following 
table:

Z9G is a non-associative seminear-ring. Clearly e.gi = gi.e = gi serves as the identity.  
 
Now Z9 is a S-NA seminear-ring III. Obtain S-units, S-zero divisors; S-idempotents 
and compare them with units, zero divisors and units.  
 
Example 8.4.6: Let Z8 = {0, 1, 2, …, 7} be a seminear-ring under ‘×’ and ‘.’. L5(3) be 
a loop of order 6. Let Z8L5(3) be the loop seminear-ring. Z8L5 (3) is a NA seminear-
ring. It is a S-seminear-ring III. Obtain S-ideals and S-subsemigroups in them.

8.5 New notions on S-NA-near-rings and S-NA seminear-rings  
 
In this section we introduce several concepts in S-NA-near-rings and S-NA seminear-
rings, like Smarandache quasi non-associative near-ring (seminear-ring) S-quasi N-
subgroups, Smarandache quasi N-subsemigroups Smarandache quasi ideals etc and 
concepts like Smarandache quasi bipotent elements and several analogous properties 
done in case of near-rings. Finally study of Smarandache SNP rings of three levels are 
introduced and this section concludes with the concept of Smarandache quasi regular 
elements in non-associative near-ring. The concept of Smarandache Jacobson radical 
is also introduced and it is left for the reader to develop.  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.1: Let N be a non-associative near-ring we say N is a Smarandache 
quasi non-associative near-ring (S-quasi non-associative near-ring) if N has a proper 
subset which is a ring under the operations of N.  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.2: Let N be a non-associative seminear-ring we say N is a 
Smarandache 
quasi 
non-associative 
seminear-ring 
(S-quasi 
non-associative 
seminear-ring) if N has a proper subset P such that P is a semiring.  
 
Example 8.5.1: Let N = Z8 × Z12 be the S-mixed direct product of a ring and a 
seminear-ring where Z8 is the ring of integers modulo 8 and Z12 is a seminear-ring 
under the operation ‘×’ and ‘.’. G be any groupoid with unit. NG is the groupoid 
seminear-ring which is a S-quasi non-associative near-ring.  
 
Example 8.5.2: Let N = Zo × Z8 (where Zo = Z+ ∪ {0} is a semiring and Z8 is a 
seminear-ring) be the S-mixed direct product of a semiring and a seminear-ring. 
Clearly NG is a S-quasi seminear-ring where G is any groupoid with identity. Thus 
the concept of S-mixed direct product has helped us to construct non-trivial and non-
abstract examples of such structures. Now for these S-quasi near-rings and S-quasi 
seminear-rings we can define in an analogous way the concept of S-quasi ideals, S-
quasi N-subsemigroup and S-quasi N-subgroup.  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.3: Let (N, +, .) be a S-quasi seminear-ring. We call a non-empty 
subset I to be a Smarandache quasi left ideal (S-quasi left ideals) in N if  
 
a. (I, +) is a S-semigroup.  
b. n (n1 + i) + nn1 ∈ I for each i ∈ I and n, n1 ∈ P; P a semiring in N. 
We say I is a S-quasi ideal if IP ⊂ I.  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.4: Let (N, +, .) be a S-quasi near-ring. We say a non-empty subset I

DEFINITION 8.5.5: Let N be a S-quasi near-ring (S-quasi seminear-ring). We say N is

ring (P ⊂ N and P is a semiring) for every a in N.  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.6: Let N be a S-quasi near-ring (S-quasi seminear-ring) N is said to 
be a Smarandache quasi s-near-ring (S-quasi s-near-ring) (Smarandache quasi s-
seminear-ring, in short, S-quasi s-seminear-ring) if a ∈ Pa for each a in N where P is 
a proper subset N which is a ring (P ⊂ N and P is a semiring).  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.7: Let N be a S-quasi near-ring (S-quasi near-ring) N is said to be 
Smarandache quasi regular (S-quasi regular) if for each a in N there exists x in P; P 
⊂ N, P a ring (P ⊂ N and P a semiring) such that a = a(xa) = (ax)a.  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.8: A S-quasi near-ring (Smarandache quasi seminear-ring) N is 
called Smarandache quasi irreducible (S-quasi irreducible) (Smarandache quasi 
simple) if it contains only the trivial S-quasi N-subgroups (S quasi N-subsemigroups).  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.9: Let N be a S-quasi near-ring (S-quasi seminear-ring) an element x 
is said to be quasi central if xy = yx for all y ∈ R; R ⊂ N is a ring (or R ⊂ N and R is 
a semiring).  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.10: Let N be a S-quasi near-ring (or S-quasi seminear-ring) N is said 
to be Smarandache quasi subdirectly irreducible (S-quasi subdirectly irreducible) if 
the intersection of all nonzero S-quasi ideals of N is nonzero.  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.11: Let N be a S-quasi near-ring (S-quasi seminear-ring) N is said to 
have Smarandache quasi insertion of factors property (S-quasi IFP) if a, b ∈ N, ab = 
0 implies arb = 0 where r ∈ R, R ⊂ N and R is a ring (or r ∈ R, R ⊂ N, R is a 
semiring).  
 
Note: We can take a (nb) or (an) b in all cases it should vanish that is anb = 0.  
 
Now we define the concept of Smarandache quasi divisibility and Smarandache 
divisibility.  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.12: Let N be a non-associative S-near-ring we say N is Smarandache 
weakly divisible (S-weakly divisble) if for all x, y ∈ N there exists a z ∈ P; P ⊂ N 
where P is an associative ring or P is a near-field such that xz = y or zx = y.  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.13: Let N be a non-associative S-seminear-ring we say N is 
Smarandache weakly divisible (S-weakly divisible) if for all x, y ∈ N there exists z ∈ 
P, P ⊂ N where P is an associative seminear-ring such that xz = y or zx = y.  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.14: Let N be a S-quasi near-ring (S-quasi seminear-ring). We say N 
is Smarandache quasi weakly divisible (S-quasi weakly divisible) if for all x, y ∈ N 
there exists z ∈ R; R a ring R ⊂ N (R a semiring R ⊂ N) such that xz = y or yz = x.  
 

 
152 
DEFINITION 8.5.15: Let N be a S-near-ring I (or S-seminear-rings). We say N is 
Smarandache strongly prime (S-strongly prime) I if for each a ∈ N \ {0} there exists a 
finite S-semigroup F such that a(Fx) ≠ 0 for all x ∈ N \ {0}.  
 
In case N is S-seminear-ring II (III or IV) we say N is a Smarandache strong prime II 
(III or IV) (S-strong prime II (III or IV)) if for each a ∈ N \ {0} there exists a finite S-
semigroup F such that a Fx ≠ 0 for all x ∈ P \ {0}, P ⊂ N; P is a associative 
seminear-ring / P is a associative near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.16: Let N be a non-associative right near-ring and A an S-ideal or a 
S-left ideal of N. We define three properties as follows.  
 
a. 
A is Smarandache equiprime (S-equiprime) if for any a, x, y ∈ N such 
that a(nx) – a(ny) ∈ A for all n ∈ N or (an) x – (an) y ∈ Y we have a ∈ A 
or x – y ∈ A.  
 
b. 
A is Smarandache strongly semiprime (S-strongly semiprime) if for each 
a finite subset F of N such that if x, y ∈ N and  
 
(af) x – (af) y ∈ A or  
a (fx) – a(fy) ∈ A or  
(af) x – a (fy) ∈A or  
a (fx) – (af) y ∈ A  
 
for all f ∈ F then x – y ∈ A.  
 
c. 
A is Smarandache completely equiprime (S-completely equiprime) if a ∈ 
N \ A and ax – ay ∈ A imply x – y ∈ A.  
 
The study of properties in S-non associative near-rings has validity when the non 
associative identity plays a role in the definition.  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.17: Let S be a non-empty subset of a S-right near-ring N which is 
non-associative. Define left and right Smarandache polar subsets (S-polar subsets) of

Suppose SPL (N) is the set of S-left polar subsets of N and SPR(N) is the set of S-right 
polar subsets of N one need to test whether SPL(N) and SPR(N) are complete bounded 
lattices.  
 
Several of the results which are discussed in chapter 5 can verbatim be proved in case 
of non-associative near-ring. Hence to avoid repetition we have not recalled them.  

 
153 
 
DEFINITION 8.5.18: Let P be a seminear pseudo ring (SNP-ring) we say P is a 
Smarandache SNP-ring I (S-SNP-ring I) if P has a proper subset T ⊂ P such that T is 
a seminear-ring. Smarandache SNP-ring II (S-SNP-ring II) if P has a proper subset R 
⊂ P such that R is a near-ring. Smarandache SNP-ring III (S-SNP-ring III) if P has a 
proper W ⊂ P such (W, ⊕, ) is a semiring. Thus we have 3 levels of S-SNP rings. A 
Smarandache SNP subring (S-SNP subring) is defined as a proper subset U of P such 
that (U, ⊕, ) is a S-SNP-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.19: Let (P, ⊕, ) be a SNP-ring. A proper subset I of P is called a 
Smarandache SNP- ideal (S-SNP-ideal) if   
 
1. for all p, q ∈ I, p ⊕  q ∈ I. 
2. 0 ∈ I. 
3. For all p ∈ I and r ∈ P we have p  r or r  p ∈ I. 
4. I is a S-SNP-ring. 
 
DEFINITION 8.5.20: Let (R, ⊕, ) be a quasi SNP-ring. R is said to be a 
Smarandache quasi SNP-rings (S-quasi SNP-ring) if and only if R is a S-SNP-ring. 
 
DEFINITION 8.5.21: Let (R, ⊕, ) and (R1, ⊕, ) be any two S-SNP-ring, we say a 
map φ is a Smarandache SNP-homomorphism I (II or III) (S-SNP homomorphism I, II 
or III) if φ: S to S1 where S ⊂ R and S1 ⊂ R1 are seminear-ring (or near-ring or 
semiring) respectively and φ is a seminear-ring homomorphism from S to S1
  (or near-
ring homomorphism from S to S1 or a semiring homomorphism from S to S1). φ need 
not be defined on the entire set R or R1 it is sufficient if it is well defined on S to S1.  
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache right quasi regular element. We just 
recall that an element x ∈ R, R a ring is said to be right quasi regular if there exist y 
∈ R such that x o y = x + y – xy = 0 and left quasi regular if there exist y1 ∈ R such 
that y1 o x = 0 = y1 + x – y1x.  
 
Quasi regular if it is right and left quasi regular simultaneously. We say an element x 
∈ R is Smarandache right quasi regular (S-right quasi regular) if there exist y and z 
∈ R such that x o y = x + y – xy = 0, x o z = x + z – xz = 0 but y o z = y + z – yz ≠ 0 
and z o y = y + z – zx ≠ 0.  
 
Similarly we define Smarandache left quasi regular (S-left quasi regular) and x will 
be Smarandache quasi regular (S-quasi regular) if it is simultaneously S-right quasi 
regular and S-left quasi regular.  
 
The study of the quasi regular concept happens to be an interesting study in case of 
near-rings and seminear-rings. We leave the reader to obtain results and define S-
quasi regular elements in non-associative near-rings and seminear-rings; as the 
definition of S-quasi regularity does not involve any associative or non-associative 
elements. This study is a routine and the reader is expected to obtain some interesting 
results about them.  
 

 
154 
If we define S-non-associative ring to have a substructure which is a non-associative 
ring then we have several interesting results.  
 
THEOREM 8.5.1: Let N be a S-near-ring having a proper subset P of N to be a 
commutative ring with unit and of characteristic 0. L any loop of finite order. Then 
the near loop ring NL has a right quasi regular element x = Σ αi mi (mi ∈ L) αi ∈ P ⊂ 
N is right quasi regular then Σαi ≠ 1.  
 
Proof: Let y = Σ βi hj, βi ∈ P and hj ∈ L be the right quasi inverse of x then x + y – xy 
= 0 that is Σαi mi + Σβjhj – (xy) = 0. Equating the coefficients of the like terms and 
adding these coefficients we get Σ αi + Σβj - Σ αi Σ βj = 0 or Σ αi = Σ βj(Σ αi – 1). 
Now if Σ αi = 1 then Σ αi = 0 a contradiction. Hence Σ αI ≠ 0.   
 
Example 8.5.3: Let N = R × Zm be a near-ring, where (Zm , +, .) is a right near-ring 
and R the field of reals. Clearly N is a near-ring which is a S-right near-ring III. L be a 
loop given by the following table:  
 
. 
e a b c d 
e e a b c d 
a a e c d b 
b b d a e c 
c c b d a e 
d d c e b a 
 
Clearly NL is a near loop ring ZL ⊂ NL is a loop ring. Take e + b ∈ ZL; (e + b) o (e + 
c) = e + b + e + c – (e + b) (e + c) = 0 so e + c is the right quasi inverse of e + b. 
Clearly e + d is a left quasi inverse of e + b. Note that e + d ≠ e + c as d and c are 
distinct elements in L. Thus we see in near loops rings the left quasi inverse and right 
quasi inverse of an element need not in general be the same.  
 
THEOREM 8.5.2: Let N = Z2 × Z15 where Z2 is the prime field of characterize two and 
Z15 is a near-ring. Let L be any loop. NL be the near loop ring. If x ∈ Z2 L × {0} ⊂ (Z2 
× Z15); L is right quasi regular then |supp x| is an even number. 
 
Proof: The proof is easily obtained by simple calculations.  
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache Jacobson radical of a near loop ring.  
 
DEFINITION 8.5.22: Let N = N1 × N2 where N1 is a field of characterize zero and N2 is 
any near-ring. NL be the near loop ring of the loop L over the near-ring N.  
We define SJ (P) to be the Smarandache Jacobson radical (S-Jacobson radical) of NL 
if P ⊂ NL is a non-associative ring and J(P) denotes the usual Jacobson radical of the 
non-associative ring P.  
 
Example 8.5.4: Let N = Z × Z18 be the mixed direct product of the ring Z and the 
near-ring Z18 L any finite loop, NL the near loop ring of the loop L over the near-ring 
N. Clearly ZL ⊂ NL and ZL is a non-associative ring. If x = Σ αi hi ∈ ZL such that Σ 

 
155 
αi ≠ 0 then x ∉ SJ (ZL). It is left for the reader the verify, as the conclusion derived is 
straightforward.  
 
Example 8.5.5: Let L be any finite loop. N = Z9 × Z7 be S-mixed direct product of the 
near-ring Z9 and the prime field of characterize 7, Z7 , N is S-near-ring. NL is the near 
loop ring of the loop L over the near-ring N. If x ∈ S (J (Z7L)) such that x = Σ αi mi 
and Σ αi ≠ 0 (mod 7) then x ∉ S(J (Z7 L)).  
 
Using these two examples several interesting results can be generalized in case of 
loop rings. NL where N has subsets which are fields of characteristic 0 or 
characteristic p or Z.

FUZZY NEAR-RINGS AND 
SMARANDACHE FUZZY NEAR-
RINGS 
 
 
This chapter has three sections. In the first section we just recall all the definitions 
about fuzzy ideals and other known fuzzy concepts in near-rings. In the second 
section we give five new types of fuzzy near-rings which are formed in an 
unconventional way. In the final section we introduce the concept of Smarandache 
fuzzy near-rings, ideals and roots.  
 
The concept of fuzzy subset was introduced by Zadeh L.A. [105]. Later several 
authors has developed it to fuzzy near-rings like [1, 25, 40, 46, 89, 94, 95, 98]. Till 
date there are only about a dozen papers in fuzzy near-rings. Here we introduce and 
study these with reference to Smarandache fuzzy near-rings we give the basic 
definitions needed to define this concept.  
 
 
9.1 Basic notions on fuzzy near-rings 
 
In this section we just recall the basic known and available fuzzy notions about near-
rings. To the best of our knowledge we have only a very few papers on fuzzy near-
ring that too mainly dealing with fuzzy ideals.   
 
DEFINITION 9.1.1: Let X be a nonempty set. A mapping µ: X → [0, 1] is called a fuzzy 
subset of X.  
 
DEFINITION 9.1.2: Let σ and θ be two fuzzy subsets of N. We define the product of 
these fuzzy subsets (denoted by σ o θ) as follows.

(σ o θ)(x) = 0, (otherwise) . 
 
DEFINITION 9.1.3: Let X and Y be any nonempty sets and f, a function of X into Y. Let 
µ and σ be fuzzy subsets of X and Y respectively. Then f(µ), the image of µ, under f, is 
a fuzzy subset of Y defined by

and f –1(σ) the pre image of σ under f is a fuzzy subset of X defined by (f –1(σ)) (x) = 
σ(f(x)) for all x ∈ X. 
 

 
158 
Notation: Let µ and σ be two fuzzy subsets of N then we write µ ⊆ σ if µ (x) ⊆ σ(x) 
for all x ∈ N.  
 
DEFINITION 9.1.4: Let µ be a non-empty fuzzy subset of a near-ring N (that is µ(x) ≠ 0 
for some x ∈ N) then µ is said to be a fuzzy ideal of N if it satisfies the following 
conditions:  
 
a. µ (x + y) ≥ min {µ (x), µ (y)}.  
b. µ (-x) = µ (x). 
c. µ (x) = µ (y + x – y). 
d. µ (xy) ≥ µ (x) and  
e. µ {x (y + i) – xy } ≥ µ (i) for all x, y, i ∈ N.  
 
1. If µ is a fuzzy ideal of N then µ (x + y) = µ (y + x)  
2. If µ is a fuzzy ideal of N then µ (0) ≥ µ (x) for all x ∈ N. The above two statements 
can be easily verified for if we put z = x + y, then µ (x + y) = µ (z) = µ (-x + z + 
x) since µ is a fuzzy ideal µ (–x + x + y + x) = µ (y + x) (since z = x + y).  
 
Likewise for the second statement µ (0) = µ (x – x) ≥ min {µ (x), µ (-x)} = µ(x)  since 
µ is a fuzzy ideal (since µ (-x) = µ (x) by the very definition of fuzzy ideal).

THEOREM [25]: Let N be a near-ring and λI, the characteristic function on a subset I 
of N. Then λI is a fuzzy ideal of N if and only if I is an ideal of N.  
 
DEFINITION [25]: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of X. Then the set µk of all t ∈ [0, 1] is 
defined by µt = {x ∈ N / µ (x) ≥ t} is called the level subset of t for the near-ring N.  
 
DEFINITION [25]: Let N be a near-ring and µ be a fuzzy ideal of N. Then the level 
subset µt of N for all t ∈ [0, t], t ≤ µ(0) is an ideal of N if and only if µ is a fuzzy ideal 
of N.  
 
DEFINITION [25]: A fuzzy ideal µ of N is called fuzzy prime if for any two fuzzy ideals 
σ and θ of N σ oθ ⊆ µ implies σ ⊆ µ or θ ⊆ µ.  
 
Now we use the concept of fuzziness in Γ-near-rings as given by [1, 72].  
 
THEOREM [72]: If µ is a fuzzy ideal of a near-ring N and a ∈ N then µ (x) ≥ µ(a) for 
all x ∈ 〈 a〉.  
 
Proof: Please refer [1, 72].

DEFINITION [72]: Let µ and σ be two fuzzy subsets of M. Then the product of fuzzy 
subset ( σ o τ)(x) = sup {min (σ (y), τ (z))} if x is expressible as a product x = yz 
where y, z ∈ M and (σ o τ) (x) = 0 otherwise.  
 
DEFINITION [72]: A fuzzy ideal µ of N is said to have fuzzy IFP if µ (a n b) ≥ µ(ab) for 
all a, b, n ∈ N.  
 
DEFINITION [72]: Let µ be a fuzzy ideal of N, µ has fuzzy IFP if and only if µk is a IFP 
ideal of N for all 0 ≤ k ≤ 1.  
 
DEFINITION [72]: N has strong IFP if and only if every fuzzy ideal of N has fuzzy IFP.  
 
THEOREM [72]: If µ is a fuzzy IFP-ideal of N then Nµ = {x ∈ N / µ (x) = µ(0)} is an 
IFP ideal of N.  
 
Proof: We have µ (0) ≥ µ (x) for all x ∈ N; write t = µ (0). Now Nµ = µt and by 
definitions µt has IFP. Therefore Nµ is an IFP ideal of N.  
 
Notation: Let µ be a fuzzy ideal of N. For any s ∈ [0, 1] define βs : N → [0, 1] by

Since βs depends on µ, we also denote βs by µβs.  
 
Results:  
 
1. βs (x) ≤ s for all x ∈ N. 
2. βs is a fuzzy ideal of N. 
3. If µ (0) = t, then s ≥ t if and only if µt = (βs)t.  
 
The proof of the above 3 statements are left as an exercise for the reader to prove.  
 
We can still equivalently define as a definition or prove it as a theorem.  
 
DEFINITION [75]: µ is a fuzzy IFP ideal of N if and only if βs is a fuzzy IFP ideal for 
all s ∈ [0, 1].  
 
Result: A fuzzy ideal µ has IFP if and only if N(βs) has IFP for all s ∈ [0, 1].  
 
The above result is assigned as an exercise for the reader to prove.  
 
DEFINITION [75]: Let µ : M→ [0, 1]. µ is said to be a fuzzy ideal of M if it satisfies 
the following conditions:  
 
1. µ (x + y) ≥ min {µ (x), µ (y)}. 
2. µ (-x) = µ (x). 
3. µ (x) = µ (y + x – y).

4. µ (x α y) ≥ µ (x) and  
5. µ {(x α (y + z) – x α y} ≥ µ(z) for all x, y, z ∈ M and α ∈ Γ.  
 
The following result is left as an exercise for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 9.1.1: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of M. Then the level subsets µt = {x ∈ M / 
µ(x) ≥ t}, t ∈ imµ, are ideals of M if and only if µ is a fuzzy ideal of M.  
 
All results true in case of fuzzy ideals of N are true in case of fuzzy ideals of M with 
some minor modifications. The following result can be proved by routine application 
of definitions.  
 
THEOREM 9.1.2: Let M and M1 be two Γ-near-rings, h : M → M1 be an Γ-
epimorphism and µ, σ be fuzzy ideals of M and M1 respectively then  
 
1. h (h-1 (σ)) = σ. 
2. h-1 (h (µ)) ⊇ µ and  
3. h-1 (h (µ)) = µ if µ is constant on ker h.  
 
DEFINITION [72]: A fuzzy ideal µ of M is said to be a fuzzy prime ideal of M if µ is not 
a constant function; and for any two fuzzy ideals σ and Γ of M, σ o Γ ⊆ µ,  implies 
either σ ⊂ µ or Γ ⊂ µ.  
 
Using these definitions it can be proved.  
 
THEOREM [72]: If µ is a fuzzy prime ideal of M then Mµ = {x ∈ M / µ (x) = µ(0)} is a 
prime ideal of M.

Then µ is a fuzzy prime ideal of M if I is a prime ideal of M.  
 
Proof: Using the fact µ is a non-constant fuzzy ideal of M we can prove the result as a

DEFINITION [72]: Let I be an ideal of M. Then λI is a fuzzy prime ideal of M if and

9.2 Some special classes of fuzzy near-rings 
 
In this section the author solely introduces the concept of fuzzy complex near-rings, 
fuzzy near matrix ring, fuzzy polynomial near-ring, special fuzzy near-ring and fuzzy 
non-associative complex near-rings and studies them.  
 
All these concepts are far from the conventional way of defining them. Hence we in 
this section define these five types of fuzzy near-rings and study some of its 
interesting properties.  
 
DEFINITION 9.2.1: Let Pn×n denote the set of all n × n matrices with entries form [0, 1] 
i.e. Pn×n = {(aij) / aij ∈ [0, 1]} for any two matrices A, B ∈ Pn×n define ⊕ as follows:

where aij.bij = aij for all aij ∈ A and bij ∈ B. Clearly (Pn×n, ☼) is a semigroup. Thus (A 
⊕ B) ☼ C = A ☼ C ⊕ B ☼ C. Hence (Pn×n, ⊕, ☼) is a near-ring, which we call as 
the fuzzy near matrix ring.  
 
THEOREM 9.2.1: The fuzzy matrix near-ring is a commutative near-ring.  
 
Proof: Straightforward.  
 

 
163 
THEOREM 9.2.2: The fuzzy matrix near-ring is not an abelian near-ring.  
 
Proof: For A, B ∈ Pn×n we have A ☼ B ≠ B ☼ A in general.  
 
THEOREM 9.2.3: In {Pn×n, ⊕, ☼} we have In×n ≠ A where In×n is the matrix with 
diagonal elements 1 and rest 0.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
DEFINITION 9.2.2: Let {Pn×n, ⊕, ☼} be a fuzzy near matrix ring we say a subset I of 
Pnxn is a fuzzy left ideal of Pnxn if  
 
1. (I, +) is a normal subgroup of Pnxn.  
2. n (n1 + i) + nr n1 ∈ I for each i ∈ I and nr, n, n1 ∈ N where nr denotes the unique 
right inverse of n.  
 
All properties enjoyed by near-rings can be defined and will be true with appropriate 
modifications.  
 
Next we proceed on to define the concept of fuzzy complex near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 9.2.3: Let V = {a + ib / a, b ∈ [0,1]} define on V the operation called 
addition denoted by ⊕ as follows  
 
For a + ib, a1 + ib1 ∈ V, a + ib ⊕ a1 + ib1 = a + a1 + i (b + b1) where a ⊕ a1 = a + 
a1 if a + a1 < 1 and a + a1 = a + a1 – 1 if a + a1 ≥ 1 where '+' is the usual addition of 
numbers. Clearly (V, ⊕) is a group. Define ☼ on V by (a + ib) ☼ (a1 + ib1) = a + ib 
for all a + ib, a1 + ib1 ∈ V. (V, ☼) is a semigroup. It is easily verified. (V, ⊕, ☼) is a 
near-ring, which we call as the fuzzy complex near-ring.  
 
Further P = {a / a ∈ [0,1]} and C = {ib / b ∈ [0 1]} are fuzzy complex subnear rings 
of (V, ⊕, ☼).  
 
PROPOSITION 9.2.1: V has non-trivial idempotent.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 9.2.4: Let {V, ⊕, ☼} be a fuzzy complex near-ring. Every nontrivial fuzzy 
subgroup of N is a fuzzy right ideal of V.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the fact that if N is a fuzzy subgroup of V then NV ⊆ N.  
 
It is an open question. Does V have nontrivial fuzzy left ideals and ideals. The reader 
is requested to develop new and analogous notions and definitions about these 
concepts.  
 
Now a natural question would be can we have the concept of fuzzy non-associative 
complex near-ring; to this end we define a fuzzy non-associative complex near-ring.  
 

 
164 
DEFINITION 9.2.4: Let W = {a + ib / a, b ∈ [0, 1] called the set of fuzzy complex 
numbers}. Define on W two binary operations ⊕ and ☼ as follows: 
  
(W, ⊕) is a commutative loop where for a + ib,  c + id ∈ W define a + ib ⊕ c + id = a 
~c + i ( b ~ d) where ‘~’ is the difference between a and b. Clearly (W, ⊕) is a 
commutative loop.  
 
Define ☼ on W by (a + ib) ☼ (c + id) = a + ib for all a + ib, c + id ∈ W. (W, ⊕, ☼) 
is called the fuzzy complex non-associative near-ring. ([0, 1], ⊕, ☼) ⊆ (W, ⊕, ☼) is a 
fuzzy non-associative subnear-ring.  
 
Obtain interesting properties about these non-associative fuzzy complex near-rings.  
 
Now we proceed on to define fuzzy polynomial near-rings.   
 
DEFINITION 9.2.5:  Let R be the set of reals. The fuzzy polynomial near-ring R[x[0, 1]] 
consists of elements of the form

Define ☼ on R [x[0 1]] by p(x) ☼ q(x) = p(x) for p(x), q(x) ∈ R [x[0, 1]]. Clearly {R[x[0, 
1]], +, ☼} is called the fuzzy right polynomial near-ring. x0 = 1 by definition.  
 
DEFINITION 9.2.6: Let {R [x[0, 1]], +, ☼} be a fuzzy polynomial near-ring. For any

 (pn ≠ 0) deg p(x) = sn. The maximal 
degree of any polynomial p(x) can take is 1. Now it is important to note that as in the 
case polynomial rings we cannot say deg [p(x).q(x)] = deg p(x) + deg q(x).  
 
But we have always in fuzzy polynomial near-ring.  
 
 
deg (p(x) q(x)) = deg p(x)  for  
 
p(x), q(x) ∈ R [x[0, 1]]  
 
as this degree for fuzzy polynomial near-rings is a fuzzy degree we shall denote them 
by f(deg (p(x)).  
 
DEFINITION 9.2.8: Let p(x) ∈ [R [x[0, 1]]- p(x) is said to have a root α if p(α) = 0.  
 
Example 9.2.2: Let p(x) = 
2 – x1/2 be a fuzzy polynomial in R {x[0, 1]]. The root of 
p(x) is 2 for p(2) = 
2 – 21/2 = 0.  
 
But as in case of root of polynomial of degree n has n and only n roots which is the 
fundamental theorem on algebra; we in case of fuzzy polynomial near-rings cannot 
say the number of roots in a nice mathematical terminology that is itself fuzzy.  
 
A study of these fuzzy polynomial near-rings is left open for any interested 
researchers. We proceed on to define fuzzy polynomial near-rings when the number 
of variables is more than one x and y.  
 
DEFINITION 9.2.9: Let R be the reals x, y be two variables we first assume xy = yx. 
Define the fuzzy polynomial near-ring.

DEFINITION 9.2.10: Let {R [x[0, 1], y[0, 1]] ⊕ ‘.’} be a fuzzy polynomial near-ring in the 
variable x and y.

the variables x and y. A symmetric fuzzy polynomial is a homogenous polynomial of

For example p (x, y) = 3x1/2 y2/3 + 3x2/3 y1/2. p (x, y) = xr + yr r ∈ [0, 1].  
 
p(x, y) = xr + yr + xsyt + ytss where s + t = 1. s, t, r ∈ [0, 1]. We have like other 
polynomials we can extend the fuzzy polynomials to any number of variables say X1, 
X2, …, Xn. under the assumption XiXj = XjXi and denote it by R [X1
[0, 1], X2
[0, 1], … 
Xn
[0, 1]] called the fuzzy polynomial near-ring in n variables. The reader is advised to 
develop new results on these fuzzy polynomial near-rings.  
 
We have introduced the concept of complex near-ring and the non-associative 
complex near-ring now we just define yet another new notion called fuzzy non-
associative near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 9.2.12: Let {W, ⊕, ☼} be the fuzzy non-associative complex near-ring. 
Let x be an indeterminate. We define the fuzzy non-associative polynomial near-ring 
as follows 
 
W [x] = {Σ pi xi / pi ∈ W}; we say p(x), q(x) ∈ W[x] are equal if and only if every 
coefficient of same power of x is equal i.e. if p(x) = p0 + p1x + … + pnxn and q(x) = q0 
+ q1x + … + qnxn. p(x) = q(x) if and only if pi = qi. for i = 1, 2, …, n. Addition is 
performed as follows p(x) ⊕ q(x) = p0 ⊕ q0 + … + (pn ⊕ qn) xn where ⊕ is the 
operation on W. For p(x), q(x) in W[x] define p(x) ☼ q(x) = p(x). Clearly {W (x), ⊕, 
☼} is a fuzzy non-associative complex polynomial near-ring.  
Now take Zo = Z+ ∪ {0}. Let p: Zo → W be defined by p(0) = 0, p(x) = x
1  for 0 ≠ x ∈ 
Z.  
 
Clearly p(z) is a fuzzy non-associative subnear-ring of W. Thus p is a fuzzy non-
associative subnear-ring.  Let G = Zo × Zo. Define a map p0 : G → W[x] by  
 
p(0, 0) = 0.  
p(x, y) = 
y
1
x
1 +
, x ≠ 0, y ≠ 0.  
p(x, 0) = x
1 ;  
p(0, y) = y
1 .  
 
Then the map p is a fuzzy non-associative complex subnear-ring of G.  
 
Several interesting research in this direction is thrown open for the reader.  
 
Now we proceed on to define a special class of fuzzy near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 9.2.13: Let P = [0, 1] the interval from 0 to 1. Define ⊕ and ☼ on P as 
follows. For a, b ∈ P define a ⊕ b = a + b if a + b < 1, a ⊕ b = 0 if a + b = 1 and a 
⊕ b = a + b –1 if a + b > 1. Thus ⊕ acts as modulo 1. Define ☼ on a, b ∈ P = [0, 1] 
by a ☼ b = a; clearly (a ⊕ b) ☼ c = a☼ c + b☼ c = a ⊕ b. Clearly (P, ⊕) is a group 

 
167 
and (P, ☼) is a semigroup. Hence (P, ⊕, ☼) is a right near-ring. We call {P, ⊕, ☼} 
the special fuzzy right near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 9.2.14: Let (P, ⊕, ☼) be a fuzzy near-ring. P0 = {p ∈ P / p.0 = 0} is 
called the fuzzy zero symmetric part and Pc = {n ∈ P / n.0 = n} is called the fuzzy 
constant part.   
 
THEOREM 9.2.5: The special fuzzy right near-ring {P, ⊕, ☼} has no fuzzy invertible 
elements.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
Let S = {r/p, 0 / 1 < r < p} is a fuzzy subnear-ring or to be more specific if S = {0, ¼, 
½, ¾}; S is a fuzzy subnear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 9.2.15: A fuzzy subnear-ring N of P is called fuzzy invariant if NP ⊆ N 
and PN ⊆ N we call a fuzzy subnear-ring N of P to be a fuzzy right invariant if NP ⊂ 
N.  
 
The following theorem is left as an exercise to the reader.  
 
THEOREM 9.2.6: Every fuzzy subnear-ring N of P is fuzzy right invariant.  
 
DEFINITION 9.2.16: The set P = {0, 1} with two binary operations ⊕ and ☼ is called 
fuzzy right seminear-ring if {P, ⊕} and {P, ☼} are right seminear-ring.  
 
All results can be easily extended in case of fuzzy seminear-ring.  
 
Example 9.2.3: Let {P, ⊕, ☼} be the fuzzy semi-near-ring. Define ⊕ as p ⊕ q if p + q 
< 1 and p ⊕ q = 0 if p + q ≥ 1. Then (P, ⊕) is a semigroup. Define ☼ as p ☼ q = p for 
all p, q ∈ P. Clearly {P, ⊕, ☼} is a special fuzzy semi-near-ring.

9.3 Smarandache fuzzy near-rings  
 
In this section we just introduce the notion of Smarandache fuzzy near-rings in a very 
unconventional way. We further introduce the Smarandache concepts to the fuzzy 
near-rings introduced in section 9.2 Finally we define Smarandache roots for 
Smarandache polynomial near-ring and leave a vast stretch of research for the reader.  
 
DEFINITION 9.3.1: Let N be a near-ring, let µ be a non-empty fuzzy subset of a near-
ring. If µ is a fuzzy ideal of the near-ring N then we call N a Smarandache fuzzy near-
ring (S-fuzzy near-ring) related to µ and denote it by N
µ
. 
 
Every fuzzy subset of a near-ring need not in general give a S-fuzzy near-ring. Also 
we can define S-fuzzy near-ring in any way one likes. We call this definition as the S-
fuzzy near-ring of level I.  
 
DEFINITION 9.3.2: The characteristic function λ on a near-ring is a S-fuzzy near-ring 
related to λ. This S-fuzzy near-ring is unique and we call this as the Smarandache 
fuzzy characteristic near-ring (S-fuzzy characteristic near-ring).  
 
THEOREM 9.3.1: Every near-ring N has a S-fuzzy characteristic (function) near-ring.  
 
Proof: Straightforward.  
 
THEOREM 9.3.2: Let N be a near-ring. N a S-fuzzy near-ring related to µ (µ a fuzzy 
ideal of N) then the level subsets µt , t ∈ [0, t], t ≤ µ (0) are S-fuzzy near-rings.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
DEFINITION 9.3.3: A S-fuzzy near-ring associated with µ is said to have Smarandache 
fuzzy IFP (S-fuzzy IFP) if and only if µ (a n b) ≥ µ (ab) for all a, b, n ∈ N.  
 
DEFINITION 9.3.4: Let N be a S-fuzzy near-ring associated with µ. µN has fuzzy IFP if 
and only if µk is a S-fuzzy near-ring for all 1 ≤ µ ≤ 1.  
 
DEFINITION 9.3.5: N is a Smarandache strong fuzzy IFP (S-strong fuzzy IFP) if and 
only if every S-fuzzy near-ring is a S-fuzzy IFP near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 9.3.6: N
µ
 is S-fuzzy IFP near-ring if and only if βs is a S-fuzzy IFP near-
ring for all s ∈ [0, 1] where

DEFINITION 9.3.7: A S-fuzzy near-ring N
µ
 is said to be Smarandache fuzzy prime (S-
fuzzy prime) if µ is not a constant function and for any N
σ
N
τ
 S-fuzzy near-rings σ o 
T ⊆ µ implies either σ ⊂ µ or T ⊂ µ.  
 
The author has only introduced just the concept of S-fuzzy near-ring. It is left for the 
reader to do research in this direction and develop the concept of S-fuzzy near-ring as 
such notion is very new and has a lot of scope for any innovative researcher.  
 
Now we proceed on to define a new type of S-fuzzy near-rings using the concepts 
defined in section 9.2. 
 
DEFINITION 9.3.8: Let {Pn×n , ⊕, ☼)} be a fuzzy near matrix ring we call {Pn×n, ⊕, ☼} 
a Smarandache fuzzy matrix near-ring (S-fuzzy matrix near-ring) if P has a subset S, 
S ⊂ P such that {S, ⊕, ☼} is a near-field.  
 
DEFINITION 9.3.9: The fuzzy complex near-ring {V, ⊕, ☼} is called a Smarandache 
fuzzy complex near-ring (S-fuzzy complex near-ring) if V has a proper subset R such 
that {R, ⊕, ☼} is a near-field.  
 
DEFINITION 9.3.10: Let {W, ⊕, ☼} be a non-associative fuzzy complex near-ring, we 
say {W, ⊕, ☼} is a Smarandache non-associative fuzzy complex near-ring (S-non-
associative fuzzy complex near-ring) if {W, ⊕, ☼} has a non-associative fuzzy 
complex near division ring.  
 
DEFINITION 9.3.11: Let R [x[0, 1]] be the fuzzy polynomial near-ring. We say          R 
[x[0, 1]] is a Smarandache fuzzy polynomial near-ring (S-fuzzy polynomial near-ring) 
if R [x[0 1]] has a proper subset T which is a near-field.  
 
DEFINITION 9.3.12: Let R [x[0, 1]] be a S-fuzzy polynomial near-ring we say a 
polynomial f(x) in T, T a near-field,  has a Smarandache root (S-root) if f(α) = 0 for 
some α ∈ T.  
 
Thus we see sometimes a polynomial which has roots may not in general have 
Smarandache roots.  
 
It is left for the reader to construct examples and counter examples to prove the above 
statements.

SUGGESTED PROBLEMS  
 
 
This chapter suggests 145 problems on near-rings, seminear-rings, S-near-rings and S-
seminear-rings and their generalizations. The problems mainly are connected with 
group near-rings, semigroup near-rings, group seminear-rings and semigroup 
seminear-rings and their Smarandache analogues which can always be formulated 
once the concepts are mastered. The main motivation is that the study of this type is 
very meagre or absent. But this study is significant as group-rings and semigroup 
rings are very widely studied. The reader should try to study these concepts so that 
one can get several examples of both commutative and non-commutative near-rings 
and seminear-rings using varied types of groups and semigroups. 
 
Thus this study will lead to a multifold research on the four concepts of semigroup 
near-rings, group near-rings, group seminear-rings and semigroup seminear-rings and 
mainly their Smarandache analogue. 
   
The study of non-associative near-rings and seminear-rings leads to the concept of 
studying famous identities like Moufang, Bol, Bruck, WIP etc. Here also the existence 
of a class of non-associative near-ring or seminear-ring from the natural integers or in 
a natural way in unknown to the author. We can get classes of non-associative 
seminear-rings using loops and groupoids. By using the natural class of loops and 
groupoids described in Chapter I the researcher will certainly get classes of both non-
associative near-rings and seminear-rings.  
 
Finally the study of S-near-rings, S-seminear-rings both associative and non-
associative is very recent (2002). Thus this book gives a list of definitions about S-
seminear-rings. The book does not completely deal with all analogous properties in 
case of Smarandache notions. Several Smarandache problems are given for the 
researchers to solve. The set of suggested problems in this book is an added feature.

Definition:  
 
Generally, in any human field, a Smarandache Structure on a set A  means a 
weak structure W on A such that there exists a proper subset B ⊂ A which is 
embedded with a stronger structure S.  
 
These types of structures occur in our everyday's life, that's why we study them 
in this book.  
 
Thus, as a particular case:  
 
A Near-Ring  is a non-empty set N together with two binary operations '+' and '.' 
such that (N, +) is a group (not necessarily abelian), (N, .) is a semigroup. For all 
a, b, c ∈ N we have (a + b) . c = a . c  + b . c. 
 
A Near-Field is a non-empty set P together with two binary operations '+' and '.' 
such that (P, +) is a group (not necessarily abelian), (P \ {0}, .) is a group. For all 
a, b, c ∈ P we have (a + b) . c = a . c  + b . c. 
 
A Smarandache Near-ring is a near-ring N which has a proper subset P ⊂ N, 
where P is a near-field (with respect to the same binary operations on N).
