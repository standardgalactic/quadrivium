Preface
Whether you're just beginning your use of Avid Media Composer or you've been using  
it for some time, I believe this book contains a great deal of useful, time-saving, and  
frustration-reducing information for users at all experience levels. Further, I believe  
this book fills a particular gap in the Avid Media Composer publications that are  
currently available.
Because the features and abilities of Avid Media Composer are so broad, encompassing 
editing, sound design, color correction, and visual effects, I decided to focus this book 
primarily on the core story-telling needs we have every day; essentially, getting footage  
into the system, editing, and audio mixing.
I first began learning Avid Media Composer in 1994 through trial and error. Nonlinear  
editing and the Internet were still in their infancy, and there weren't any books on Avid  
Media Composer. So, I did my best to learn by reading the manual. My frustrations came  
when I'd read about a procedure or tool in the manual, but it didn't include a definition of  
it or context for when it would be useful. So, in addition to providing the step-by-step 
instructions, as cookbooks published by Packt Publishing promise, I've included many 
definitions of industry and Media Composer-specific terms, explanations of why tools  
and functions behave as they do, and situations when they would be helpful.  
In many ways, this is one of the books I wish I had had all those years ago.
I'd also like to mention that some incredibly knowledgeable people have helped me by 
reviewing this book's content while I was writing it: Michael Phillips, Oliver Peters, and Roger 
Shufflebottom. These very generous gentlemen are talented professionals whom you may 
find yourself meeting, consulting, or working with in the future. I encourage you to read their 
biographies, which are included in this book, and you'll see how fortunate I was to have them 
on the team.
Lastly, I truly hope you find this book to be helpful.

What this book covers
Chapter 1, Getting Assets into Your Media Composer Project, gets you thinking about 
organization, provides you with some common workflows, and gives you some tips to  
hopefully make your work easier and/or more productive.
Chapter 2, Customizing Your Work Environment, has a goal to show you some great features 
to help you work more comfortably, swiftly, and efficiently.
Chapter 3, Polishing Gems, explains that there are many useful features, gems if you will, 
that go underutilized. This chapter shines and polishes a few of them up by revealing some 
functions' hidden abilities, explaining their behavior, and/or giving you a few new ideas about 
how you might use them.
Chapter 4, Creating Split Edits, examines several methods to create a Split Edit, which is also 
known as an L Cut, Prelap, Postlap, or more simply, a Split.
Chapter 5, Maintaining and Regaining Sync, focuses on giving you a solid understanding of 
why Avid Media Composer works the way it does regarding sync, how you can be in complete 
control of staying in sync when using any of the editing modes (without Sync Locks enabled), 
what Sync Locks do and how they work, and what to do if you find yourself out of sync.
Chapter 6, Managing Your Media Files, has a goal to take some of the mystery out of dealing 
with media files, using the Media Tool, and helping you through some common media 
management situations.
Chapter 7, Mono and Stereo Audio Mixing, centers on many of the common audio mixing and 
effects tasks and challenges when working on a mono or stereo project.
Chapter 8, Editing with Group Clips and MultiCamera Mode, covers several methods to sync 
all the footage from different cameras used in a multiple-camera production, and how to edit 
with this footage in an efficient way using the features that Media Composer provides.
Chapter 9, Output Tips and Tricks,  includes topics for creating bars and tone; adjusting your 
sequence to accommodate bars, tone, and slate; an overview of exporting still images and 
QuickTime movies; and familiarizing yourself with the Timecode Burn-In effect.
Chapter 10, Time Savers in the Title Tool is not present in the book but is available as a free 
download from the following link: http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/

In addition to this book, you will need Avid Media Composer software, running on either a Mac 
or a PC. You can download a 30-day free trial of Avid Media Composer at Avid.com. While 
this book focuses on Avid Media Composer Version 6, because Avid has done a great job 
of preserving the majority of functionalities as the software has evolved, a great deal of the 
information will still be useful to those using other releases of the software.
Who this book is for
This book is intended as an additional resource for Avid Media Composer users ranging from 
those just beginning through intermediate users looking for a deeper understanding of the 
functionality of the software, tips, and tricks.

information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.
Code words in text are shown as follows: "Project settings are located inside the Project 
folder along with the bins and folders that you created."
New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen,

Introduction
You've created your project, and now comes the sometimes time-consuming task of acquiring 
your assets. In this chapter, I'll get you thinking about organization, provide you with some 
common workflows, and give you some tips to hopefully make your work easier and/or  
more productive.
A strategy for project organization at the 
desktop level
Some words to the wise to help you avoid some common pitfalls.
How to do it...
Following are the steps for organizing the project at the desktop level:
1.	 Determine a location for a folder that will hold items relating to your project that will 
not require being moved.
2.	 Create a folder and name it something that is clear and concise, for example, either 
[Project Name] Materials or [Project Name] Assets.
3.	 Inside that main folder, create additional folders for Avid Project Backups, files 
you will link to using the Avid Media Access (AMA) feature, Music, Sound Effects, 
Imports_Stills, Imports_Motion Graphics, Photoshop Masters, Fonts, 
After Effects Projects, and any others you think you'll need.

How it works...
By keeping everything organized and in a consistent location, you will have a much easier  
time keeping track of assets and changes to assets. Further, backing up, moving, archiving,  
or re-importing the assets will be easier.
The trick is to remember to copy assets into this folder before putting them to use in any 
way within your project. For example, copy music and sound effects from a CD to this folder, 
then import the audio file that's in the folder (rather than directly off the CD) into a Media 
Composer, or copy into this folder any fonts that you download before adding them to your 
operating system.
Understanding Media Creation settings
It's important to spend some time setting up your Media Creation settings. Essentially Media 
Creation settings allow you to set defaults, which will help ensure that the media files you 
create (for example, render files, imports, and so on) are stored where you want them and are 
of the resolution you need. Plus, it will save you time making selections in various dialog boxes 
and tools throughout the workday.
Getting ready
In your Project Window select the Format tab. Select the format of the media that you will be 
capturing, importing, and/or rendering. Media Composer will remember your Media Creation 
settings for each format that you configure. So, for example, if you're mixing SD and HD 
footage, you'll configure your Media Creation settings for each. Once your preferences are set 
in the Media Creation tool for each format, Media Composer will automatically switch to your 
customized settings whenever the format itself is switched.
How to do it...
The following steps will guide you through using the Media Creation Tool:
1.	 Go to the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
2.	 Select Media Creation.
3.	 Proceed section by section to set defaults for the resolution of the media that you 
create, as well as for the destination for that media. See the following How it works... 
section for details.

How it works...
The settings are separated by tabs, described as follows:
Drive filtering and indexing
f
f
Filter Network Drives Based on Resolution: Selecting this will not allow media files 
to be placed on any network drives that Media Composer feels will not be able to 
reliably capture or playback files of a particular resolution. For example, you open 
your Capture Tool and set the resolution to 1:1. Then when you go to select a drive  
to store your media files on, you may see that one is grayed out and not selectable.  
If you then change your resolution to 3:1, you may find that it is now selectable as a 
storage drive.
f
f
Filter Out System Drive: Selecting this will not allow the media files to be stored  
on the same drive that your operating system is installed on.
f
f
Filter Out Launch Drive: Selecting this will not allow the media files to be stored  
on the same drive that your Media Composer software is installed on.
Video resolution
Under each tab you can select a default resolution. You are not locked into this resolution. 
Tools and dialog windows will still allow you to override this default whenever you want.
Apply to All: If you'd like to set a specific resolution and have it applied to all the different 
media type tabs, rather than having to do it one by one, simply click on the Apply to  
All button.
The benefit of breaking the media types into categories, such as Capture, Render, and 
Import, is that you can then set different defaults for each. For example, on a project with 
many hours of taped footage, you might elect to capture all of your footage at a low resolution 
in order to increase how much media will fit onto your drive(s). This will mean that when the 
project is creatively finished, you will go through a second process to recapture just the video 
portions that are being used at a much higher resolution, a process frequently called the Up-
Res, so that the image quality will be higher. You may prefer to not have to go through a similar 
process for all of the titles, still images, and motion graphics, so you could elect to set the 
default for these media types at the level where you need them to be for the final master (for 
example, 1:1).
Video drive/Audio drive
Under each tab, you can select a default location for the media types to be stored. You are not 
locked into this. Various tools and dialog windows will still allow you to override this default 
when desired.

This selection is helpful for ensuring files go where required, and it allows you to send render 
files (known in Avid terminology as Precompute files) to a specific drive if required  
by your facility.
Apply to All: If you want the storage drive to be the same for all the different media type tabs, 
rather than having to do it one by one, simply click on the Apply to All button.
Media type
Changing this is only possible for SD video, as HD will always be in the MXF format. Media 
Creation settings will default to the file format called Material Exchange Format (MXF). You 
should not change this unless you are in the unique situation where you are generating media 
on one workstation that will have to be used on a much older workstation that can only play 
the Open Media Framework (OMF) file format.
Mixing frame rates
Yes, it's possible to mix footage with different frame rates. However, at the time of writing, the 
Media Composer only allows each Project to be at one frame rate. So, here's one method to 
make the mixing of frames rates possible.
Getting ready
You will create two separate projects, each at the required frame rate. Be sure to label 
them accordingly to avoid confusion. For example, one project would be named [Project 
Title]29-97 (project names cannot contain a period) and the other would be named 
[Project Title] 24p.
How to do it...
The following are the steps to mix footage with different frame rates:
1.	 Capture and/or import your video into the corresponding projects based on the 
frame rates.
2.	 Decide which project will be the main/primary project that you will actually work 
within to edit and craft your movie. Most likely, this will be the project that contains 
the majority of your footage or matches the final delivery format that is required.
3.	 In your main project, ensure that no bins are currently selected in the Project Window.
4.	 Go to the File menu and select Open Bin…. (Alternatively, you will find the Open Bin... 
selection under the Project Window's Fast Menu as well as in the menu that will 
appear when you right-click in the Project Window.)

5.	 In the dialog window, navigate to the project that's at the other frame rate and 
contains the bin file that you want to open.
6.	 Select the bin and either double-click on it or click on the Open button in the  
dialog window.
7.	
The bin will open in your Project and you can access the contents.
8.	 Once the bin is open, it will be inside a folder created by Media Composer labeled 
Other Bins. This is short for other projects' bins. It means that the bin file does  
not reside inside the same folder as your Project's bin files.
At this point you can elect to begin editing right from those bins, or you may elect to copy the 
clips into a bin that does reside in your Project folder. See the next There's more... section for 
two methods of copying clips, called Duplicating and Cloning.
There's more...
There are two methods you can use to copy the clips (making a Duplicate or a Clone), each 
with a unique behavior. Whether you Duplicate or Clone a clip, you will never create any new 
media files, but will simply create an additional clip that refers (or you could say points) to the 
media file(s). Media Composer calls this reference a link and would say that the clip is linked 
to the media file(s).
f
f
Duplicating a clip: Each clip acts independently of the other. For example, one clip 
could be named Horse and contain several Markers while the Duplicated clip could 
be named White Horse Runs and have no Markers. Making changes to the name, 
adding/removing I/O marks, and adding/removing Markers to one Duplicated clip 
does not have any affect on the other. Further, the creation date of a Duplicated clip 
will reflect the new date and time it was created.
f
f
Cloning a clip: Cloned clips are able to communicate to their cloned brethren. For 
example, if you change the name of one Cloned clip, the other's name will also 
change. The same is true for adding and removing Markers as well as In and Out 
points. The creation date for all Cloned clips will be the same (the original date).
Duplicating clips
The following are the steps for duplicating clips:
1.	 Select the clips you want to Duplicate.
2.	 Go to the Edit menu.
3.	 Select Duplicate. Alternatively, you could right-click on one of the selected clips  
and choose Duplicate from the Contextual menu, or use the keyboard shortcut  
cmd + D (Mac) or Ctrl + D (PC).
4.	 New clips will be created and will have .copy added to the end of their names.

Chapter 1

5.	 Create a new bin by clicking on the New Bin button in your Project Window, or go to 
the File menu and select New Bin.
6.	 Move the clips that you just created to the new bin.
7.	
If you no longer want to have the borrowed bin appear in the Other Bins folder, 
select the borrowed bin and either press the Delete key or right-click and select 
Delete Selected Bins from the Contextual menu. It's helpful to note that you are not 
actually permanently deleting the bin file, but rather just telling Media Composer that 
you no longer want to use it. The bin is still intact inside the other project's folder. For 
emphasis, this only applies to bins that are inside the Other Bins folder. Deleting a 
bin created within the currently open Project will place it into the Trash.
Cloning clips
The steps for Cloning the clips are as follows:
1.	 Create a new bin by clicking on the New Bin button in your Project Window,  
or go to the File menu and select New Bin.
2.	 Select the clips you want to Clone.
3.	 Press and hold the Alt/option key while you drag the selected clips to the new bin.
4.	 New clips will be created in the desired bin when you release the mouse button. 
These clips will not have .copy added to them.
5.	 If you no longer want to have the borrowed bin appear in the Other Bins folder, 
select it and either press the Delete key or right-click and select Delete Selected 
Bins from the Contextual menu. It's helpful to note that you are not actually deleting 
the bin file, but rather just telling Media Composer that you no longer want to use it. 
The bin is still intact inside the other Project's folder.
Sequences will never be Cloned
On a related topic, you can use either of the methods mentioned previously on a sequence. 
Both of the methods will produce a Duplicate of the sequence. In other words, both of the 
methods will make a sequence with the word .Copy added to it, and no matter which method 
you used to create that sequence, it will never, ever, communicate with another sequence 
in any way. They will always be totally independent. The changes made to one sequence will 
never be replicated in another.
Motion Adapters
Note that when you edit mixed frame rate clips into your Sequence, they are automatically 
adjusted. You'll see a small green dot on the clip that indicates that it contains what Avid calls 
a Motion Adaptor. The method used to adjust the image (for example, Blended Interpolated 
or Both Fields) can be changed by promoting the clip to a Timewarp effect. The Motion 
Adaptor is applied only to the video and preserves the original duration of the clip; further,  
the audio is not altered in any way.

Tape capture tip: Adding Markers while 
Capturing
This simple feature allows you to accomplish multiple tasks at the same time. As you capture 
material off tape, you can simultaneously add Markers to help you locate the takes you like 
and the takes that the members of the creative team like. For example, while Capturing and 
watching the footage with your director, you might use red Markers for what you deem to be 
useful takes and yellow Markers for the ones that the director likes.
Getting ready
This tip works when you're actively Capturing from the tape (the red light is blinking). Note that 
this tip does not work when Batch Capturing.
How to do it...
The steps that follow indicate how to add a Marker while Capturing:
1.	 Open the Capture Tool by going to Tools menu | Capture Tool.
2.	 Begin the Capture from tape (the red light is blinking).
3.	 While the capture is in progress, press any of the keys F3 or F5 through F12 on your 
keyboard. F3 or F5 = Red Marker, F6 = Green, F7 = Blue, F8 = Cyan, F9 = Magenta, 
F10 = Yellow, F11 = Black, and F12 = White.
4.	 See the There's more... section of this recipe for details.
How it works...
When the Capture Tool is active, it takes control of your F keys. Whatever you've  
mapped there for editing is replaced with several different functions, including the  
ability to add Markers.
There's more...
You can even add notes inside a Marker while capturing.
Adding notes in a marker during capture
1.	 While the capture is in progress, add a Marker using one of the F keys mentioned in 
the previous How to do it... section.
2.	 Press the Tab key to tell Media Composer you want to add a comment to that Marker 
(rather than naming the clip).
3.	 Type your comment.

4.	 Press the F4 key to tell the Capture Tool that the Marker entry is completed.  
This will return the Capture Tool to its previous behavior of allowing you  
to name and comment on Master Clips and Subclips.
5.	 The markers will be visible once the capture is finished and the bin is saved.
Tape capture tip: Making Subclips while 
Capturing
While Capturing a long Master Clip, you have the ability to divide it into Subclips at the same 
time, which will save you time since you won't have to perform the Subclipping and labelling in 
a separate step. For example, you have a tape of an interview with the President of the United 
States and you need to get it into your Media Composer immediately. You can begin capturing 
from the start of the tape and by using the tip that follows in the next recipe, you'll also be 
able to create Subclips of each question and answer.
Note that this tip produces different types of subclip behavior depending on whether you are 
in a film Project or a video Project. If you set up your Project as a film project (for example, 16 
mm or 35 mm) when you first created it, then the Subclips will be locked in their duration and 
cannot be trimmed longer in the Sequence. This is intentional in order to protect vital Key 
Code/Key Number information that is specific to film projects.
Getting ready
This tip works while you're actively capturing from the tape (the red light is blinking). Note that 
this tip does not work when Batch Capturing.
How to do it...
The steps that follow help us make Subclips while capturing:
1.	 Begin capturing (red light is blinking).
2.	 Press the F1 key when you want to begin a new Subclip. If you want to update the 
location for the beginning of that Subclip to a later point, press the F1 key again. You 
can update the In point at any time. It is not locked in until the F2 key is pressed.
3.	 Begin typing to name the Subclip, if you want to.
4.	 You, optionally, can also press the Tab key to move the cursor into the Comment Entry 
Box and begin typing to add a comment.
5.	 Press the F2 key to end the Subclip. If you want to update the location for the end 
of that Subclip to a later point, then press the F2 key again. You can update the Out 
point at any time. It is not locked in until the F1 key is pressed again.
6.	 Press the F1 key to begin a new Subclip and repeat the preceding steps.

14
How it works...
During this process, you are creating one Master Clip that will refer to, point to, or, as Avid 
says, link to the media file(s) of video and/or audio. The Subclips do not create new media 
files; they are just shorter references to, or subsections of, the longer Master Clip.
Logging clips tip: Logging from the keyboard
This is a quick tip to aid in the faster logging of Master Clips from a tape during the Batch 
Capture process.
You may be aware that when the Capture Tool is selected and is in Capture Mode, that 
pressing the F4 button will begin the Capture from the tape. Many are not aware that when 
the Capture Tool is in Log Mode, the F4 key will send the logged clip into your designated bin. 
Further, this button can be mapped to wherever you prefer on your keyboard.
How to do it...
The following steps indicate how to log from the keyboard:
1.	 Open or create a bin.
2.	 Open the Tools menu | Capture Tool.
3.	 In the Capture Tool there is a pull-down menu labeled as Bin. From that menu, select 
the bin where you'd like your logged clips to be placed.
4.	 At the top of the Capture Tool, change the tool's mode from Capture to Log. To do 
this, click on the button near the Trash Can icon that says CAP so that it reads LOG 
and displays a pencil icon.
5.	 Log clips using the keyboard. You can control the following features using the 
keyboard keys:


Control the deck with the J, K, and L keys


Mark the start and end of your Master Clips with the I and O, or E and R keys


Use the Tab key to navigate to the name and comment entry boxes


Select/deselect the V1, V2, A1, A2, A3, and A4 keys using the 7, 8, 9, 0, -, 
and = keys respectively
6.	 Use the F4 key to log a clip into your selected bin.

Logging clips tip: Keeping the Capture Tool 
active after logging a clip
This is a quick tip to help with logging Master Clips from tape during the Batch Capture process.
When you are logging, once the clip is sent to the bin, the bin becomes active. This allows 
you to immediately begin naming the clip in the bin. However, what if you already named the 
clip in the Capture Tool, or are in a hurry to log, and plan on naming the clips more precisely 
later? In such cases, you may prefer that the Capture Tool always stays selected, so that 
you can log the clip to the bin and quickly return to shuttling the tape and logging more clips 
without having to select the Capture Tool again. The following setting will allow that.

Quickly calculating total duration of clips  
(or any items in a bin)
After logging many clips you'll Batch Capture them. However, it's helpful to know the 
total duration of all the clips added together so you can make sure that your drive can 
accommodate that amount of media.
How to do it...
Below are the steps to calculate the total duration of selected clips:
1.	 Select all the clips that you want to calculate the duration for. Methods include Shift + 
clicking to select a range of clips, or going to the Edit menu and choosing the Select-
All command.
2.	 Right-click on one of the selected Master Clips.
3.	 From the menu select Get Bin Info.
4.	 The Console window will open.

5.	 There will be an entry in the Console that reads Total duration of selected items:. 
The duration is displayed as Hours:Minutes:Seconds:Frames (refer to the  
screenshot below).
There's more...
This is also useful for calculating the total duration of multiple sequences (for example, if your 
movie or TV program is still divided into separate sequences for each act).
Combining available drive space and/or 
controlling where media is stored
The Capture Tool has a feature that lets you create a Drive Group that designates more  
than one drive for Media Composer to be used for media storage. This is helpful in the 
following situations:
f
f
You want to make sure that the media files go to the drive(s) that you want when one 
becomes full, rather than Media Composer simply selecting the drive that happens to 
have the most free space
f
f
You have a large amount of media to capture but there is not one single drive that 
has enough space
f

Making a Drive Group is especially helpful when you want to leave the Capture 
process unattended

Making sure your Batch Capture continues 
without you
You've logged many clips and are ready to begin Batch Capturing. You'd like to start the 
capture process and then run out for lunch. You just need to make sure that if the drive you've 
selected becomes full before capturing all the clips' media, that Media Composer won't stop 
and wait for you to tell it which drive to switch to. Further, you want to make sure that, if it has 
trouble capturing a clip, it will try a couple of times and then move on, rather than stopping on 
that one clip and waiting for you to tell it what to do.
How to do it...
Following are the steps to make sure your Batch Capture continues without you:
1.	 Open the Capture Settings by either of the following methods:


From the Project Window select Settings tab | Capture Settings


Right-click on the Capture Tool and select Capture Settings…
2.	 In the Capture Settings window, click on the tab labeled as Batch.
3.	 Enable the selection labeled Switch to emptiest drive if current drive is full.
4.	 Enable the selection labeled Log errors to the console and continue capturing.
There's more...
As an added measure and for more control, you may also want to create what Avid calls a 
Drive Group as discussed in the Combining available drive space and/or controlling where 
media is stored recipe.
Modifying clips before capture
There will come a time when something needs to be changed before a clip is  
captured (modifying clips after they have been captured is covered in the next section).  
The following are the typical issues:
f

How to do it...
Below are the steps to modify clips before capture:
1.	 Select the clips. Some methods include Shift + clicking to select a range of clips or 
going to the Edit menu and choosing the Select-All command.
2.	 Open the Modify window by using either of the following methods:


From the Clip menu, select Modify


Right-click on any of the selected Master Clips and choose Modify
3.	 In the Modify window, click on the pull-down menu.
4.	 In order to change the:


Type of Timecode, choose Set Timecode Drop/Non-Drop


Tape association, choose Set Source


Add or remove tracks, choose Set Tracks
Modifying clips after capture: Adding tracks
It's possible that you don't discover that you need additional tracks off the tape until after  
the capture is completed. You'll find that once a clip is captured, some modifications, such  
as setting tracks, are not possible without a little extra work called Unlinking.
Before we go through the process, an overview will be helpful. Unlinking is temporarily 
breaking the connection (in Avid terminology, the Link) between the clips and their media 
files. After Unlinking, you'll modify the clips to add the tracks you want. Then, you'll Relink the 
clips to the existing media. After the Relink, you'll capture the media that's missing.
How to do it...
Here are the steps to modify clips (adding tracks) after capture:
1.	 Select the clips. Some methods include Shift + clicking to select a range  
of clips, or going to the Edit menu and choosing the Select-All command.

of the previous ones, then in the Batch Capture dialog window, deselect the option 
that says Offline media only. For example, you realize that you need to recapture the 
video at a different resolution.
Deselecting this option deletes the existing media before it 
recaptures the new media.

Modifying clips after capture: Deleting 
tracks
It's possible you don't discover that you have tracks that you don't need until after the capture 
is completed. In this case you'll want to:
f
f
Delete the unnecessary media to free up the drive space and ensure that you don't 
have orphan media files that are not linked to any clips.
f
f
Modify the clips so they no longer refer to media files that don't exist (since you 
deleted them). This will help avoid confusion during the editing process.
Before we get into the specifics, here is an overview of the process. First you're going to use 
the Media Tool to delete the specific media files that you don't need. Then you'll find that 
once a clip has been captured, some modifications, such as setting tracks, are not possible 
without a little extra work called Unlinking. This temporarily breaks the connection (in Avid 
terminology, the Link) between the clips and their media files. After Unlinking, you'll modify  
the clips to remove the unnecessary tracks, and, finally, you'll relink  
the clips to the media that remains.
How to do it...
The following are the steps to modify clips (deleting tracks) after capture:
1.	 First, you're going to determine where the media files have been stored. Select the 
bin that contains all of your clips in order to make it active.
2.	 Change the bin display to Text View from the Bin Display menu at the bottom-left of 
the Bin window.
3.	 Open the Bin Column Selection window using any of the following methods:


In the Clip menu, choose Columns


Right-click in the bin and select Choose Columns


Right-click in the Column Headings section at the top of the bin and select 
Choose Columns from that menu
4.	 The Bin Column Selection window opens. From the list of possible columns of 
information types, select Drive and click on OK.
5.	 Take note of the media drive(s) your clips are referring to.
6.	 Open the Media Tool by going to the Tools menu and selecting Media Tool.
7.	
In the Media Drives column of the Media Tool, select only the media drive(s) that 
your clips are referencing (those listed in the Drive column in your bin).

8.	 Click on the button labeled as Current Project, since you'd generally want to display 
media that belongs only to the currently open project and no other. If you did want 
to display media from other projects, you can Shift + click to select the additional 
project names.
9.	 Select the Master Clips checkbox. Note that in the end, you'll still be looking at media 
files. It's just that they will be displayed in a more familiar way, as Master Clips.
10.	 Deselect both the check boxes for Precompute Clips and Media Files and 
click on OK.
11.	 A window will open titled Media Tool. This window has all the features of a bin.
12.	Arrange your Bin window and the Media Tool window so you can see both of them  
at the same time.
13.	The next few steps are going to ensure that only the correct clips become selected in 
the Media Tool. Start by selecting the clips in your bin.
14.	 Go to the Bin Fast Menu at the bottom-left corner of the bin and choose Select 
Media Relatives. Note that the clips in your Media Tool have become selected.
15.	 Click on the top title portion of the Media Tool so that it is selected/active. Make sure 
that when you select the Media Tool, you don't mistakenly deselect the clips.
16.	 Press the Delete key on your keyboard.
17.	 The Delete Media dialog window will open.
18.	Enable the check box for each track of media you want to permanently delete and 
click on OK.
19.	Another dialog window will open. If you are positive that you want to permanently 
delete the media files you've selected, click on OK.
20.	Close the Media Tool.
21.	 The unnecessary media is now deleted, but you are left with clips in your bin that are 
still looking for that media even though it isn't there or, in other words, is Offline. This 
can be very confusing during editing, so the next set of steps will fix that. If the clips 
have become unselected in your bin, be sure to select them before continuing.
22.	In order to modify the clips, we have to temporarily break the connection (the Link) 
between the clip(s) and the media file(s), which is called Unlinking. To do this, press 
and hold the Shift key and the cmd/Ctrl key at the same time (this changes the 
Relink menu selection to Unlink).
23.	Select the Unlink command by either:


Selecting Clip menu | Unlink

Right-clicking on any of the selected Master Clips and choosing Modify
26.	In the Modify window, click on the pull-down menu and choose Set Tracks.
27.	 Deselect the tracks that no longer have media to link to, since you just deleted it. In 
other words, make sure only the tracks that still have media available on the drive(s) 
are selected. Click on OK.
28.	If the clips have become unselected, be sure to select them.
29.	Open the Relink window by either:


Selecting Clip menu | Relink…


Right-clicking on any of the selected Master Clips and choosing Relink…
30.	Relink the clips. Additional information on Relinking is available in the Avid Media 
Composer Help.
Capturing and editing at the same time
If you're in a hurry, it's possible to edit the clip(s) being captured into the Sequence at the 
same time that you capture from the tape.
How to do it...
Here are the steps to capture and edit at the same time:
Create a new sequence or load an existing sequence into the Timeline Window.
1.	 In the case of an existing sequence, clear any existing In and/or Out Marks.
2.	 Place the blue Position Indicator where you'd like to begin adding the clips.
3.	 Open the Capture Tool using any of these methods:

Disable this feature in the Capture Settings
Preparing to use AMA (Avid Media Access): 
Getting the plug-ins
AMA allows you to almost immediately begin editing with file-based video, without first having 
to go through another process, such as Transcoding or Importing. Essentially, you point Media 
Composer directly to the native files, and because of AMA programming/architecture, it 
recognizes them and links to them. However, Media Composer needs to be given the ability to 
recognize the files first. This is done by installing free plug-ins for each camera and/or video 
format (note that the QuickTime AMA plug-in is an exception and is installed by default). Using 
plug-ins means that they can be updated at any time independently from the Media Composer 
program, and, as new video formats are created, their AMA plug-ins can be made available by 
the manufacturer at the same time.

AMA (Avid Media Access) linking
AMA allows you to almost immediately begin editing with file-based video formats, such as P2, 
XDCAM, QuickTime, RED, and others, without first having to endure the very time-consuming 
Import or Transcode process before editing.
Before undertaking a project using the AMA feature, it is highly recommended 
that you perform a small-scale test of the process to familiarize yourself with 
the options and results. Ideally, you would be able to perform your small-scale 
test prior to receiving the mission-critical files and prior to the intensity of 
working under a deadline.
Avid provides helpful AMA user guides for the different video formats. You'll find them on the

Getting ready
First, perform the steps as detailed earlier in the Preparing to use AMA (Avid Media Access): 
Getting the plug-ins recipe.
How to do it...
Following are the steps to link to files with AMA:
1.	 Configure your AMA Settings by going to the Project Window, selecting the Settings 
tab, and then double-clicking on AMA settings.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Getting Assets into Your Media Composer Project
28
2.	 In the Bins tab, you may select how Media Composer will react when it automatically 
detects that you've mounted a volume (for example, a P2 card or a removable drive). 
This also becomes the action that Media Composer will perform when you manually 
AMA link to a volume, and in the Bin Selection dialog window that will open during the 
AMA linking process, you select Bin(s) Based On Current AMA Settings.


To use active bin, in this case, you would first select an open bin inside your 
Project before mounting or manually linking to the volume through AMA


Create a new bin:
i.	
Default bin naming convention: The bin that's automatically 
created will have the name of the Project (with an incrementing 
number added for each new bin).
ii.	
Volume name: The bin that's automatically created will have the 
name of the card or drive.
iii.	 Specify bin name: The bin that's automatically created will have 
the text that you type into the entry box
3.	 Some video formats provide multiple files with varying compression. In the Quality 
tab, you may select which files the AMA process will initially link to. Note that the files 
that are linked to can be changed later, and this is discussed in the later recipe titled  
Changing the link between different resolutions of media.
4.	 Link Options sets a default for how to treat the audio tracks (for example, mono 
or stereo). Note that this can be changed later by selecting the clips and using the 
Modify command from the Clip menu.
5.	 Click on the OK button to close the AMA Settings window.
6.	 You're now ready to begin the AMA linking process. The following steps cover linking 
to files that have been copied off a camera card. You will see this referred to as 
linking to a Virtual Volume. If you want to link to the files directly off of the camera 
card, see the There's more... section that follows this section for details. The following 
steps presume that:


You have copied the files off the original camera card and organized them  
in a fashion as discussed at the beginning of this chapter, in the recipe titled 
A strategy for project organization at the desktop level.


The original file and folder structure on the card has been kept perfectly 
intact during the copy process to a drive. In other words, there are no 
differences between the contents of the card and the copy on the drive.  
Note that this is very important and is something you should discuss with  
the production team prior to shooting.


You have chosen to allow Media Composer to make a new bin when it 
creates the AMA link, rather than selecting a current bin.
7.	
From the File menu, select Link to AMA Volume.
8.	 The browser window will open.
9.	 Browse to the location of your files keeping the following in mind:


XDCAM files: Select one folder above the Clip folder


XDCAM EX files: Select one folder above the BPAV folder


P2 files: Select one folder above the Contents folder


RED files: Navigate to the root directory


GFCAM files: Navigate to the root directory


QuickTime files: Navigate to the folder that contains the files
10.	 Click on OK.
11.	 A dialog window may open (usually when Media Composer detects multiple 
folders within a directory that contains media) and ask you how you would like to 
have the bin created.


Bin(s) based on current AMA setting: This is the default selection. Use this 
if you want the bin to follow your AMA settings.


Single bin named: This method allows you to override your AMA settings for 
this moment and set a specific name.


Single bin based on selected folder: If you made a main folder named 
AMA Media, and then placed the contents of three different P2 cards 
inside it (each card having its own folder) and named each P2 card's folder 
as card_1, card_2, and card_3, Media Composer would make just one 
bin named AMA Media, and the clips from card_1, card_2, and card_3 
would all be placed within it.


Bin(s) based on subfolders: If you made a main folder named AMA Media, 
then placed the contents of three different P2 cards inside (each card having 
its own folder) and named each P2 card's folder as card_1, card_2, and 
card_3, Media Composer would make three separate bins. The bins would 
be named card_1, card_2, and card_3.

Linking to files on a camera card
If you choose to work directly off the camera card rather than copy and organize your files, as 
discussed earlier in this chapter in the A strategy for project organization at the desktop level 
recipe, then follow the next set of steps:
1.	 Launch Avid Media Composer.
2.	 Insert the card into the card reader attached to your system.
3.	 When the card is recognized by the computer and is mounted, Media 
Composer will scan the volume (the card).
4.	 A bin will be created and named based on your AMA settings. 
5.	 Media Composer will grab the clip data from the card and create Master Clips.  
Then, it will link the Master Clips to their media files.
6.	 After successfully linking, each Master Clip will display a chain link icon attached to it.
Changing the link between different resolutions of media
If your media type provides you with versions of the files at different resolutions, you may want 
to switch linking from one resolution to another. For example, you've initially linked to the low-
resolution version of the media for editing, and now you'd like to change the link to the high-
resolution version for finishing.
1.	 Select the clips in your bin.
2.	 Right-click on the selected clips.
3.	 Choose Modify AMA Resolutions... from the menu.
4.	 The AMA Resolutions Quality window opens.
5.	 Select the video quality that you want for your video.
6.	 Click on OK.
Having trouble with AMA? 
You can get more information from the AMA plug-in Log File.
A note from Avid technology:
The Avid system creates an AMA plug-in log file when you link clips. The log file 
records errors and information about the clips. If you experience any problems 
while you link clips or if you receive an error message, check the AMA log file to get 
more information about the error (for example, a corrupt file or a bad filename).

The Getting the AMA file's image to display as desired recipe in this chapter
Getting the AMA file's image to display as 
desired 
If you link to media using the AMA process and the clip does not match the aspect ratio and 
frame size set in your Format tab, then Media Composer will allow you to change the way it is 
displayed at any time.
An important note from Avid technology:
If you are working in an Interplay environment, do not change the Reformat 
attribute from the Stretch setting. If you use a different setting, and you then  
use 'Interplay Transcode' or 'Send to Playback,' the results might not be what  
you expect.
How to do it...
Below are the steps to display the AMA file's image as desired:
1.	 Set your bin to be displayed in Text View from the Bin Display menu in the  
lower left of your bin.
2.	 You're going to display the Reformat column. Start by going to the Bin menu  
and selecting Choose Columns.
3.	 In the Bin Column Selection window choose Reformat.
4.	 Click on OK to close the window.
5.	 Select the clip(s) in your bin for which you want to Reformat the display.
6.	 In the Reformat column of the selected clip(s), click to reveal, and also choose,  
the alternate display options. If multiple clips are selected, you can change the 
Reformat setting for one of the selected clips and have that setting applied to  
all of the selected clips.

7.	
Note that if you loaded the clip into the Source Window, you will see the Reformat 
display change occur. Whatever you set here will be applied to the clip when it 
is edited into your sequence. However, if you have already edited the clip into a 
sequence, the version in the sequence will continue to display in the manner that it 
was set in when it was first edited into the sequence. This is to prevent changes being 
applied to the sequences that are considered complete and ready to export or master 
to tape. If you want to update all the instances of the clip in your sequence to use the 
new Reformat setting, this can be done without having to re-edit the clip(s). Follow 
the next set of steps:
8.	 Select the sequence(s) in the bin.
9.	 Right-click on the selected sequence(s).
10.	 Choose Refresh Sequence.
11.	 From the submenu select Reformatting Options. See the next section for details.
How it works...
Below are the Reformat options that are available along with the explanation of each.
f
f
Stretch: If the Project is set to display 4:3, then a 16:9 image will be stretched 
vertically. If the Project is set to display 16:9, then a 4:3 image will be stretched 
horizontally.
f
f
Pillarbox/Letterbox: This feature scales the image as large as possible within the 
currently set aspect ratio that you've set for your Project's display. If the Project is 
set to display 4:3, then a 16:9 image will be letterboxed (black bars on the top and 
bottom). If the Project is set to display 16:9, then a 4:3 image will be Pillarboxed 
(black columns on the left and right-hand side of the screen).

Center Crop: No scaling occurs in this option. If the project is set to display 4:3, then 
a 16:9 image will have the left and right hand side portions of the image cropped. 
If the project is set to display 16:9, then a 4:3 image will have the top and bottom 
portions cropped. 
f
f
Center Keep Size: If the image is larger, when it is centered in the window, portions 
of the image on all the sides may be cropped. If the image is smaller, then its native

Consolidating (copying) AMA Master Clips
Consolidating is Avid Media Composer's method of making copies of media files.
Consolidating (copying) is a process done by using the Media Composer 
software. It is not done by simply copying the files at the desktop level.
The Consolidation process specified in this recipe can be used either before you have begun 
to edit or at any stage during editing. What you'll be doing is making copies of your AMA files 
in their entirety. When completed, your Master Clips will link to the copied media (in the Avid 
MediaFiles folder) and Media Composer will create new clips that will link to the AMA media 
files. (For the clips that link to the AMA media, Media Composer will put an extension on them 
that says .old.) If you've already begun to edit, the sequence will link to the copied media 
rather than the AMA media.
Before consolidating all of your files, it is highly recommended that you 
perform a small-scale test of the process to familiarize yourself with additional 
options and results. The steps below focus on only one specific result. Ideally, 
you would be able to perform your small-scale test prior to receiving the 
mission-critical files and prior to the intensity of working under a deadline.
The AMA linking feature can be very processor intensive, and Avid 
recommends that users Consolidate the media into what they refer to as the 
Managed Media environment (which means the Avid MediaFiles folder) 
as soon as is practical, in order to take advantage of faster processing and a 
linking architecture that is more mature and robust than AMA.
Some formats cannot be Consolidated (copied) using their original Codec, and 
Media Composer will alert you that they will also need to have their Codec 
changed during the copy process. This is referred to as Transcoding. Ideally, 
you would transcode your Master Clips prior to doing any editing, though there 
is a process available in case you have already started to edit. Information on 
this is available in the Transcoding AMA Master Clips before beginning to edit 
and Transcoding AMA Master Clips after editing has begun recipes.
If you want to Consolidate only the shorter portions of media that are being 
used by a sequence or subclips, rather than the entire Master Clip media, see 
the recipe titled Consolidating an AMA sequence or subclips.

Getting ready
If your media type provides you with versions of the files at different resolutions, you may  
want to switch linking from one resolution to another. For example, you've initially linked  
to the low-resolution version of the media for editing and now you'd like to change the link  
to the high-resolution version for Consolidating. If this applies to you, then follow the next  
set of steps; otherwise, proceed to the How to do it… section:
1.	 Select the clips in your bin.
2.	 Right-click on the selected clips.
3.	 Choose Modify AMA Resolutions... from the menu.
4.	 The AMA Resolutions Quality window opens.
5.	 Select the video quality that you want for your video.
6.	 Click on OK.
How to do it...
The following are the steps for consolidating the media clips:
1.	 Select the clips in the bin.
2.	 From the Clip menu select Consolidate/Transcode.
3.	 In the top-left of the Consolidate/Transcode window, select Consolidate.
4.	 In the Video/Data region of the window, select the drive (also known as the target 
drive) that you want the copied files to be stored on.
5.	 Do not enable the selection that says Delete media files when done. In the case of 
AMA linked media files, they will not be deleted even if this is selected. Further, Media 
Composer will not create a Master Clip that links to the AMA media as it should.
6.	 Click on the Consolidate button.
7.	
The Copying Media Files dialog window opens.
8.	 Select the second option that reads Relink Master Clips to media on target drive. 
This option also includes some helpful text that reads Selected Master Clips will be 
relinked to the new media on the target drive. Master Clips with a .old extension 
will be created and linked to the original media. In this case, the original media 
refers to the AMA linked files.
9.	 Click on OK and the Consolidate (copy) process begins.

The Consolidating an AMA Sequence or Subclips recipe in this chapter
Transcoding AMA Master Clips before 
beginning to edit
Some formats cannot be Consolidated (copied) using their original codec. Media  
Composer will alert you that they will also need to have their codec changed during the  
copy process, or you may wish to change the codec when you copy the media. This is  
referred to as Transcoding.
Before you Transcode all of your files, it is highly recommended that you perform a small 
test of the process to familiarize yourself with any additional options and results. Additional 
options include, but are not limited to, Debayer Settings (found in the Media Creation 
settings) for RED footage, which also need to be configured. Ideally, it is best if you are able 
to perform your small-scale test prior to receiving the mission-critical files and prior to the 
intensity of working under a deadline.
As the title of this recipe suggests, the next set of steps would be used before 
editing and will focus on only one specific result. If you have already begun to 
edit, see the Transcoding AMA Master Clips after editing has begun recipe.
Getting ready
If your media type provides you with versions of the files at different resolutions, you may want 
to switch linking from one resolution to another. For example, you've initially linked to the low-
resolution version of the media for editing and now you'd like to change the link to the high-
resolution version for Transcoding. If this applies to you, then perform the following steps, or, if 
this does not apply to you, then proceed to the paragraph that follows these steps:
1.	 Select the clips in your bin.
2.	 Right-click on the selected clips.
3.	 Choose Modify AMA Resolutions... from the menu.
4.	 The AMA Resolutions Quality window opens.
5.	 Select the video quality that you want for your video.
6.	 Click on OK.

If you are Transcoding Standard Definition video to High Definition or vice versa, then you'll 
want to ensure the highest quality result using the next set of steps. If this does not apply to 
you, then proceed to the How to do it... section.
1.	 From the Project window, select the Settings tab and double-click on Render Settings.
2.	 Select the Image Interpolation pull-down menu.
3.	 Select Advanced (Polyphase).
4.	 Click on OK.
How to do it…
Below are the steps to Transcode AMA linked media before editing:
1.	 In the Project window select the Format tab.
2.	 Select the Project Type and Aspect Ratio.
Avid states: New clips created through the Transcode operation are 
in the Project Format. When you Transcode a clip across formats, for 
example if you Transcode a 16:9 clip in a 4:3 project, the Reformat bin 
setting determines how the clip is conformed to the new format.
For details on the Reformat option, see the recipe Getting the AMA file's 
image to display as desired.
3.	 Select the clips in the bin.
4.	 Clip menu | Consolidate/Transcode.
5.	 In the top-left of the Consolidate/Transcode window, select Transcode.
6.	 In the Video/Data region of the window, select the drive where you want  
the copied media files to be stored.
7.	
Select the video resolution that you want the copied media files to become.
8.	 Click on the Transcode button to begin the process.
Transcoding is not magic
Transcoding cannot increase the quality of the image. For example, if 
your footage came from a MiniDV tape (the resolution is DV25) and you 
transcoded it to a resolution of 1:1 (uncompressed), the new file will take 
up more space on your hard drive but will not look any better. On the other 
hand, if you transcoded to 20:1, then the file will be compressed and the 
image quality will be reduced.

The Transcoding an AMA sequence recipe
Transcoding AMA Master Clips after editing 
has begun
Before Transcoding all of your files after editing has begun, it is a very good idea to perform a 
small-scale test of the process to familiarize yourself with any additional options and results. 
Additional options include, but are not limited to, Debayer settings (found in the Media 
Creation settings) for RED footage, which also need to be configured. Ideally, you would  
be able to perform your small-scale test before receiving the mission-critical files and  
prior to the intensity and pressure of working under a deadline.
When you Transcode Master Clips, Media Composer automatically makes new Master Clips 
(with the .new extension), and those new clips will not link to a sequence that was created  
from them automatically. So, you'll have to make the sequence link to the new Master  
Clips with a process called Relinking.
Getting ready

2.	 Open the bin containing your sequence.
3.	 Select all the .new Transcoded files in all of the open bins.

6.	 In the Relink window, enable the selection that says Selected items in ALL  
open bins.
7.	
At the bottom of the window, make sure to enable the check box that says Create 
new sequence and click on OK.
8.	 At the completion of this process, a new sequence will be created with the text 
Relinked at the end. This sequence is now linked to the Transcoded clips. If you 
load the sequence into the Timeline, you'll see that the clip names will also have  
the .new extension on them.
Consolidating an AMA sequence or subclips
Before consolidating a sequence, it is very highly recommended that you perform a small test 
of the process on an unimportant sequence to familiarize yourself with additional options 
and results. Additional options include, but are not limited to, Debayer settings (found in the 
Media Creation settings) for RED footage, which also need to be configured. The steps of this 
recipe focus on only one specific result.
Consolidating a sequence or subclips simply means you'll be making copies of only the 
portions of media files that are being referred to by your sequence or by the subclips. 
Essentially, Media Composer will take each shot used in the sequence, or each subclip, and 
make a brand new Master Clip for it. 
You'll have the option to add handles. Handles are additional media added to the head and 
tail (beginning and end) of the new Master Clips that are not currently being used/seen/heard 
in the sequence or subclips. Handles are helpful in case, after Consolidating, you need to do 
some trimming within a sequence or need to add a transition effect like a dissolve. 
You'll also have the option to delete the original media after the Consolidate (copy) process 
is completed. Deleting the original source media would be helpful with a sequence if you had 
completed all of your editing and wanted to save drive space, or with subclips, if before you 
began editing you only wanted to keep portions of Master Clips. On the other hand, one use 
of not deleting the original media would be if you wanted to give a coworker a copy of your 
sequence or a portion of a clip to work with.
Getting ready
Before consolidating a sequence, it is always a very smart idea to make a backup copy of 
the sequence and place it into its own well-labeled bin (for example, My Movie Before 
Consolidate). This extra version will not only protect you in case you make an error, but 
will help keep your project organized for future reference (not to mention bring you additional 
peace of mind).

How to do it...
Here are the steps to consolidate an AMA sequence or subclips:
1.	 Select the sequence or the subclips.
2.	 Clip menu | Consolidate/Transcode (you may also right-click on the selected 
Sequence or Subclips).
3.	 The Consolidate/Transcode window will open.
4.	 In the upper left-hand corner of the window, select Consolidate.
5.	 In the Video/Data region of the window, select the drive where you want the copied 
files to be stored.
6.	 In the Handle Length entry box, enter the number of frames you want added to the 
head and tail of each new Master Clip.
7.	
If you are Consolidating a sequence, be sure to select the Create new sequence 
check box. Even though I suggested earlier that you make a backup copy manually 
prior to the consolidate process, this provides an additional layer of protection.
8.	 For the Delete original media files when done choice, my instruction here will be 
to not select this check box. In other words, I am instructing you to not delete the 
original media files after Media Composer has completed making copies of just the 
portions of media that are being used by your sequence or subclips. If you do indeed 
want to delete the original media, then you would select this option.
9.	 Click on the Consolidate button at the bottom of the window.
10.	 The consolidate process will begin.
11.	 On Completion of the process you will have the following:


Master Clips that have the extension .new added to them. The duration of 
each Master Clip will be only whatever it is in the sequence or subclip, plus 
the added duration of the handles.


A new sequence with the addition of .Consolidated at the end. This 
sequence is linked to the .new clips.


Your original sequence will remain linked to the original Master Clips that you 
edited from.

In the case of subclips, Media Composer creates new Master Clips that are 
the total duration (including handles) as well the as new subclips that are the 
duration of the original subclips.

Transcoding an AMA sequence
Before Transcoding a sequence, it is recommended that you carry out a small test of the 
process to familiarize yourself with additional options and results. These additional options 
include, but are not limited to, Debayer settings (found in the Media Creation settings) 
for RED footage, which also need to be configured. The steps that follow focus on only one 
specific result. Ideally, you would be able to perform your small-scale test prior to receiving the 
mission-critical files and prior to the intensity of working under a deadline.
Some formats cannot be Consolidated (copied) using their original codec, and Media 
Composer will alert you that they will also need to have their codec (also known as resolution) 
changed during the copy process. This is referred to as Transcoding.
Transcoding a sequence simply means that you'll be making copies of only the portions of 
the media files that are being referred to by your sequence. (Essentially, Media Composer will 
take each shot used in the sequence and make a brand new Master Clip for it.) Further, as it 
generates new media files, it will also be changing the media files' codec.
Unlike Consolidating, Transcoding does not offer the option to delete the original media files 
after it has completed the Transcoding process.
Getting ready
Before Transcoding a sequence, it is a very wise idea to first make a backup copy and place  
it in its own well-labeled bin (for example, My Movie Before Transcode). This extra 
version protects you in case you make an error, and will help to keep your project organized  
for future reference.
How to do it…
The steps to Transcode an AMA linked sequence are as follows:
1.	 First, review the information presented earlier in this chapter, in the Transcoding AMA 
Master Clips before beginning to edit recipe.
2.	 In the Project Window select the Format tab.
3.	 Select the Project Type and Aspect Ratio.
Important note from Avid Technology:
New clips created through the Transcode operation are in the project format. When 
you transcode a clip across formats, for example if you transcode a 16:9 clip in a 
4:3 project, the Reformat bin setting determines how the clip is conformed to the 
new format.

to display as desired recipe.
4.	 Select the sequence in the bin.
5.	 Clip menu | Consolidate/Transcode (you may also right-click on the sequence).
6.	 In the top left of the Consolidate/Transcode window, select Transcode.
7.	
In the Video/Data region of the window, select the drive you want the copied files  
to be stored.
8.	 In the Handle Length entry box, enter the number of frames you want added to the 
head and tail of each new Master Clip.
9.	 Be sure to select the Create new sequence check box. Even though I suggested 
earlier that you make a backup copy manually prior to the Transcode process, this 
provides an additional layer of protection.
10.	 Click on the Transcode button at the bottom of the window.
11.	 The Transcode process begins.
12.	On completion of the process you will have the following:


 Master Clips that have the extension .new added to them. The duration of 
each clip will be whatever it is in the sequence plus the added duration of 
the handles.


A new sequence with the addition of .Transcoded at the end. This 
sequence is linked to the .new clips.


Your original sequence will remain linked to the original Master Clips that you 
edited from.
Importing stills and video files such as 
QuickTime 
We're often given still images in formats such as .jpg, .gif, .png, or even as a layered 
Photoshop file, all of which can be imported into Avid Media Composer. Further, there will 
be instances when you'll need to import a QuickTime file rather than AMA link to it. For 
example, you've been given a motion graphic that contains an Alpha Channel (transparency 
information) that is meant to be composited on top of video. AMA linking will not recognize  
the Alpha Channel, so you must import it. Another example is regarding Broadcast Wave 
Format (BWF) files. AMA should never be used with BWF files as the Timecode will be 
incorrect and offers no control over Pull-up and Pull-down Sample Rates. See Avid Media 
Composer Help for additional information. The search term is BWF.

What does Avid Media Composer mean when it uses the term Import? In Media Composer, 
Import means that new media is created during the import process. The format of the media 
created is dictated by the settings in your Project Window's Format tab. The resolution is 
dictated in your Media Creation settings. For comparison, Adobe After Effects also uses the 
term import, except that in its case it is only pointing (linking) to the file rather than making 
new media as Media Composer does.
If you want to animate within a still image (often referred to as The Ken 
Burns Effect), you will most likely not want to import the image since that 
restricts the image size to that of your current format, which would mean 
having to scale the image up in order to pan and tilt across it. Scaling up 
reduces the quality of the image. If you are looking to create the Ken Burns 
Effect, then you'll want to check Avid Media Composer Help regarding the 
Avid Pan & Zoom effect. If you have the Boris Continuum Complete (BCC) 
effects package installed on your system, I also suggest checking out the 
BCC Pan & Zoom effect. You may also want to investigate other plug-ins 
available for this effect from the Marketplace menu.
Getting ready
Organize your files. Some suggestions are in the A strategy for Project organization at the 
desktop level recipe, earlier in this chapter.
How to do it...
Here are the steps to import video and still image files.
1.	 Project Window | Format tab.
2.	 In the Format tab set the Project Type, Aspect Ratio, Color Space, and Raster 
Dimensions for the media you'll create during the import.
3.	 Open the Media Creation settings using any of these methods:


Tools menu | Media Creation


cmd/Ctrl + 5


Project Window | Settings tab, and then double-click on Media Creation
4.	 In the Media Creation window select the Import tab.
5.	 Set the Video Resolution for the media you'll create during the import.
6.	 Set the drive where you want the media that you create to be stored.
7.	
Click on OK to close the Media Creation window.

8.	 Open your Import Settings by selecting the Project Window | Settings tab, and then 
double-clicking on Import Settings.
9.	 In the Import Settings window, click on the Image tab.
10.	 In the Image tab, you'll select the appropriate options for your situation. A brief 
explanation of these options is in the There's more… section that follows this  
recipe of steps.
11.	 Click on the OK button to close the Import Settings window.
12.	You can now import with one of the two following methods:


Method 1: Drag the file(s) from their location on a drive directly into a bin. All 
the settings you previously set will dictate how the media will be created and 
on which drive the media will be stored. Once you drop the files into the bin, 
both the Master Clips and media will be created. Layered Photoshop files  
will open an additional dialog window. Those options are discussed after  
the There's more… section that follows this recipe.


Method 2: Select an open bin. Then, either right-click within the bin  
and select Import from the Contextual menu or go to the File menu  
and select Import.
13.	The following steps relate to using Method 2 for import.
14.	 Be aware that when using Method 2, note that in the Select Files To Import window 
you will have the ability to do the following:


Click on the Options button to access the Import Settings


Set the resolution for the media you'll create during the import


Set the drive where you want the media you create to be stored
15.	In the Select Files To Import window, navigate to the file(s) you want to 
import.
16.	 Select the file(s).
17.	 Click on the Open button.

Image size adjustment
This selection relates to how the image will be scaled during the import:
f
f
Image sized for current format: This means that the file is the same frame size  
as the video format you are using. In other words:


648 x 486 square pixels for an NTSC SD 4 x 3 project


864 x 486 square pixels for an NTSC SD 16 x 9 project


1920 x 1080 for a 1080 HD project


1280 x 720 for a 720 HD project
f
f
Crop/Pad for DV scan line difference: If your SD project is the full raster of 720 x 
486 and you import an image sized for DV (720 x 480), then Media Composer will 
add in (pad) the six missing lines. On the other hand, if your project is DV and your 
graphic is 720 x 486, then Media Composer will remove (crop) the extra six lines.  
By either padding or cropping, it means that your image will not be subtly distorted.
f
f
Do not resize smaller images: Images smaller than your video format will not be 
resized and will appear in the center of the frame. Images with an Alpha channel 
will have a transparent area surrounding them while those without will have black 
surrounding them.
f
f
Resize image to fit format raster: Whether larger or smaller, the image will be 
scaled to fit within your video format's size. If your image is longer horizontally, then 
it will be scaled until it reaches the left and right edges of the frame. If your image is 
longer vertically, then it will be scaled until it reaches the top and bottom edges of the 
frame. Any remaining areas will be filled with black. Note that if your release of Media 
Composer is not allowing this to work within a 16 x 9 SD project, the workaround is to 
switch to an HD format, import, and then switch back.
File Pixel to Video Mapping
This section relates to how the luminance (brightness) and the chrominance will be 
interpreted during the import:
f
f
Computer RGB (0 - 255): Choose this if your file came from a computer graphics 
application such as Photoshop, After Effects, or Apple Motion. Selecting this option 
tells Media Composer to adjust the image during the import so it fits properly into the 
broadcast levels. Specifically, the darkest value in the graphic is mapped to the level 
of video black for your video format and the brightest value is mapped to the level of 
video white. All other values are adjusted proportionately.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Getting Assets into Your Media Composer Project
46
f
f
Computer RGB, dither image colors: This is used in the same situation as Computer 
RGB, except it performs one extra operation on the graphics file. If the file has fine 
gradients and you notice there is banding in the final imported image, try this. The 
extra operation it performs adds some noise (dithering) that may help  
to reduce or hide the banding.
f
f
601 SD or 709 HD (16 - 235): Choose this only if your file is already at the proper 
broadcast levels for your video format. For files created in other applications, such  
as Photoshop or After Effects, this will be infrequent. However, good examples of  
files that are already at broadcast levels include the SMPTE Color Bars file that 
Avid provides inside the Test_Patterns folder, and video files such as P2 that  
can be imported.
Additional selections
The following are the additional selections within the Import dialog window:
f
f
Frame Import Duration: When you import a still image, you can tell Media Composer 
how long you'd like the duration of the Master Clip to be. Media Composer will only 
create a frame or two (which Avid calls a Slide) of actual media, so you can set any 
duration you like without worrying that the media will take up a lot of drive space. This 
simply instructs Media Composer to refer to the "slide" over and over again for the 
duration that you specify.
f
f
Autodetect Sequentially-Numbered Files: Choose this option if you are given 
a folder containing many files where each represents one frame (for example, 
of an animation). They'll be numbered in order (sequentially). During import you 
would select only the first file in the folder (not all the files). Media Composer will 
then automatically look for file number two, then file number three, and so on 
(autodetection). When the import is completed, Media Composer will have assembled 
all the files (frames) into one single Master Clip.
Be sure to leave this option deselected if you are not importing 
sequentially-numbered files for the purpose of assembling them 
into a single Master Clip upon import.
f
f
Field Ordering in File: This is not to be confused with Field Dominance; these 
options only apply to interlaced video formats. If your video format is progressive, 
these options will not be displayed. Before you can know what to select here, it's 
pretty helpful to know what the native field order is for different video formats:


NTSC is Even (Lower Field First)


HD is Odd (Upper Field First)


PAL is Odd (Upper Field First)


PAL DV is Even (Lower Field First)

Chapter 1
47
With that knowledge, the details on the Field Order import selections, which follow, 
will be more useful:


Ordered for current format: Use this for still images without fields, and for 
importing still images and video files with fields that match the field order of 
your video format. For example, the video file is NTSC and your project format 
is NTSC, or your video file is HD and the project is HD.


Odd (Upper Field First): Choose this option if there is a mismatch between 
the graphic file's field order and the video format of your project. Specifically, 
the file is a format with Odd field order and the project's video format has 
Even field order.


Even (Lower Field First): Choose this option if there is a mismatch between 
the graphic file's field order and the video format of your project. Specifically, 
the file is a format with Even field order and the project's video format has 
Odd field order.
f
f
Alpha Channel: The Alpha Channel is grayscale and is used to define the opaque and 
transparent areas.


Invert on Import (white = opaque): This is the most common setting choice 
you'll make and is used when you get a graphic from a designer who has 
used After Effects, Photoshop, or similar applications to create it. This takes 
the grayscale Alpha Channel information in the file and inverts it to conform 
to how Avid Media Composer likes it (black is opaque).


Do not invert (black = opaque): You'll rarely use this. However, if a designer's 
application happens to create the graphic file with the Alpha Channel the 
way that Media Composer likes it (black = opaque), then this is the choice 
you'd make.


Ignore: The Alpha Channel information is discarded during import, and the 
file that is created will be opaque rather than a Real Time Matte Key.
Layered Photoshop files
When you import a Photoshop file with two or more layers, Media Composer will give you an 
additional dialog window with the following options:
f
f
Sequence of Layers: Media Composer brings in each individual layer as a separate 
Master Clip. It also assembles each Master Clip (layer) into a completed sequence 
just as in the Photoshop file.
Media Composer will not recognize Layer Styles (for example, Drop 
Shadow, Bevel, and so on). If you have applied Layer Styles, you'll want 
to first duplicate your Photoshop file (as a backup version). Then, within 
that duplicate, you will need to merge all the layer effects into the layers 
themselves before importing into Media Composer.

Flattened Image: All the layers in the graphic file are married together into one single 
Master Clip.
f
f
Select Layers: This feature allows you to choose just the layers you want from the file. 
Each layer will become a separate Master Clip. Naming the layers in your graphic file

5.	 This is an optional step: adjust Import Settings as discussed in the Adjusting audio  
levels before editing, Adjusting audio pan settings before editing, and Setting  
stereo-audio tracks recipes.
6.	 You can now import with one of the following two methods:


Method 1: Drag the file(s) from their location on a drive directly into a bin. 
All the settings you previously configured will dictate how the Master Clip will 
be set (for example, level adjustment and/or stereo tracks) and on which 
drive the media will be stored. Once you drop the files into the bin, both the 
Master Clips and media will be created.


Method 2: Select an open bin. Then, either right-click and select Import from 
the Contextual menu or go to the File menu and select Import.
7.	
The following steps relate to using Method 2 to import.
When using Method 2 note that in the Select Files To Import window, you have the 
ability to do the following:


Click on the Options button to access the Import Settings


Set the drive where you want to store the media you will be creating


Set the Resolution for the video media that you may create during the import
8.	 In the Select Files To Import window, navigate to the file(s) you want to import.

Adjusting audio levels before editing
There will be times when a Master Clip's audio levels are too loud (as is very often the case 
with imported audio) or too low, and you want to adjust the level setting before playing it in the 
Source Window or editing it into your sequence. There are three methods available. The steps 
that follow present one method, and the other two can be found in the There's more... section. 
None of the methods make any changes to the actual media file(s). Each method just applies 
a setting for the Master Clip that can be adjusted at any time, including in the sequence.

How to do it... 
This method is a fast and simple way to adjust one or more clips in a bin:
1.	 Import or capture clips into a bin.
2.	 Select the clip(s) you want to adjust.
3.	 Clip menu | Apply Gain.
4.	 The Apply Clip Gain window opens.
5.	 Enter the value that you want to be applied.
6.	 Click on OK.

The following are two additional methods to adjust audio levels before editing clips  
into the sequence:
Using Import settings
This is particularly helpful when importing music and sound effects, as they generally  
come in very loud. I find that adjusting to a level of -14 is a good starting point, as it  
can always be adjusted later:
1.	 Open the Import settings: Project Window | Settings tab | double-click on Import.
2.	 Select the Audio tab.
3.	 Enable/check the setting that says Apply attenuation/gain effect on Import.
4.	 In the entry box, type in the level value that you want to be applied. 
5.	 If you want this setting to be applied only to audio coming from a CD rather than 
from all the audio files, check the box that says CD Only. Since I organize my files as 
discussed in the recipe titled A strategy for project organization at the desktop level, I 
leave this selection disabled/unchecked.
6.	 Now, when you import an audio file (or a video file containing audio), this level setting 
will automatically be applied.
Using the Audio Mix tool
This method only affects one clip at a time:
1.	 Open the Audio Mixer tool from the Tools menu.
2.	 Set the Audio Mixer to Clip Volume and Pan mode, which is abbreviated simply as 
Clip. This is done by clicking on the Audio Mixer Mode button in the upper right-hand 
corner of the Audio Mixer tool.

3.	 Load a Master Clip into the Source Window.
4.	 With the Source Window active, the level adjustment you make to the Master Clip 
using the Audio Mixer will be applied before you edit it into your sequence.
Adjusting audio pan settings before editing 
This is particularly helpful when you have a mono clip (for example, a voice over) or separate 
mics on each channel of a multitrack clip (for example, an interviewer on channel one and 
the interview subject on channel two). In these instances, there's no need to edit the audio 
onto two tracks to make it play out of both the left and right speakers (channels). Instead you 
can set the clip to split the one signal out to both the left and right channel, so you only have 
to edit it onto one track. This panning operation goes by several names (center pan, mid, or 
mono), but it all means the same thing.
One thing to be aware of is that when you center pan a clip, the audio level will be reduced by 
about 3 dB due to the nature of how Media Composer deals with how we perceive audio levels 
when panned (called the Pan Law). So, depending on your situation, you may find that after 
setting a clip to mid you will need to increase the level by 3 dB in order to return it to its level 
prior to being center panned.
There are three methods available to center pan a clip depending on your needs. This recipe 
presents one method, and the other two can be found in the There's more... section. None 
of the methods make any alterations to the actual media file(s). This is just a setting that is 
applied to the Master Clip that can be adjusted at any time, including in the sequence.
How to do it...
This method is a fast and simple way to adjust one or more clips in a bin to center pan.  
It's also important to note that this method will affect all the tracks in a Master Clip.
1.	 Import or capture your audio file(s) into a bin.
2.	 Select the clip(s) you want to adjust.
3.	 Go to the Clip menu and select Center Pan.
4.	 A confirmation window opens.
5.	 Click on OK.

Setting stereo-audio tracks
In Avid Media Composer, you can have Master Clips that are interpreted by the software  
as mono, stereo, 5.1 surround, and 7.1 surround. Each type can only be edited onto  
matching tracks in your sequence. For example, a stereo Master Clip can only be edited  
onto a stereo track.
There are three methods available, depending on your situation and needs. The recipe will 
present one method and you'll find two alternative methods in the There's more... section.
How to do it...
This method is used on one or more clips in a bin:
1.	 Import or capture your clip(s) that contains audio tracks into a bin.
2.	 Select the clip(s) you want to effect.
3.	 Go to the Clip menu | Modify.... (You may also right-click on the selected clips and 
choose Modify....)
4.	 The Modify dialog window opens.

Introduction
It's a demanding work day in the editor's chair, and the more comfortably, swiftly, and 
efficiently you can get through it, the better. In this section the goal is not only to show you 
some great features built into the software and how to make them work, but also to get you 
thinking about how you work and how you might use these features, so that you can have 
more time to be creative.
www.it-ebooks.info

Customizing Your Work Environment
56
Settings overview
There is a great deal of customizability in Avid Media Composer; much of it can be achieved 
through various settings. The following discussions provide a helpful overview.
Types of settings
Media Composer has three types of settings as follows:
f
f
User Settings: These apply to modifications you make and are stored as part of your 
unique User Profile settings in the Avid Users folder. User settings include things 
such as customized keyboards, render settings, Timeline Views, Bin Views, and more. 
User Settings are entirely separate from Projects, which allows you to use them along 
with any Project and at any workstation. We will see more information on User Profile 
Settings later in this chapter.
f
f
Project Settings: Project Settings are located inside the Project folder along with 
the bins and folders that you created. Changes made to Project Settings affect it and 
any other editor(s) who work with that Project. Project Settings include information 
about the video format, audio configuration (for example, sample rate), video display, 
and more.
f
f
Site Settings: The word "site" in this case means your computer workstation and/or 
associated hardware such as tape decks connected to that system. Site Settings are 
useful for making specific settings available to all new projects and new users. For 
emphasis, Site Settings will only be put into effect when a new Project or a new User 
Profile is created. When Media Composer creates a new Project or new User, it first 
looks at the Site Settings file before loading any Project and User Settings that 
are not in that file. This can be a real time saver for things that are used over and over 
again, for example custom Export Settings, Deck Configuration Settings, Safe Color 
settings, Interplay settings, and more. Information on customizing Site Settings will  
be covered later in this chapter.
Duplicating settings to create alternate versions
Settings can be duplicated and then customized, so you can have alternate versions available 
when you need them.
One thing to be aware of is that when you display your settings (Project Window | Settings 
tab), the selections within the Project window's Fast Menu (the hamburger-looking icon in the 
top-left corner of the Project Window) will be different from when the Project Window is set 
to display bins. If the menu is set to display only the active settings, rather than all settings, it 
can often cause confusion when you duplicate settings as they will not be visible immediately. 
For emphasis, make sure that when you're duplicating settings that the Project Window's Fast 
Menu is set to display all settings.

Chapter 2
57
To duplicate a setting, perform the following steps:
1.	 Go to Project window | Settings tab.
2.	 Click on a setting to select it.
3.	 Use any of these methods to duplicate the setting:


Select Edit menu | Duplicate


Press cmd/Ctrl + D


Right-click on a setting and select Duplicate
Naming settings
Start by hovering your cursor over the setting name. As you slowly move your cursor to the 
right, you'll see it change from the hand icon to the arrow icon, which will allow you to click into 
that entry cell and type in.
Activating alternate settings
When there are multiple settings available, only one can be active at a time. It's the one with 
the check mark that Media Composer pays attention to. You can change which alternate 
setting is enabled by clicking just to the left of it. This will move the check mark and make 
that setting active. There are two notable exceptions to this, however. Custom Bin Views and 
custom Timeline Views can only be activated using the Bin View Menu located at the bottom 
of every bin or the Timeline View Menu located at the bottom of the Timeline Window.
Alternate settings ideas
The following are some useful alternate settings to get you started:
f
f
Keyboard: You could create several keyboard layouts, each customized for a specific 
task (for example, editing, capturing, multicamera editing, audio mixing, and so on). 
My suggestion is to start with your personalized editing keyboard that already has 
your customized mappings for various functions, Workspaces, Timeline Views, and 
so on. Then duplicate that keyboard, rename it, and make the specific (most likely 
minor) changes you want for the new task.
f
f
Grid: You may find that it's faster to preset a couple of different grid display settings 
and then switch between them by moving the check mark than having to reconfigure 
it each time. For example, I have several different grid displays for different aspect 
ratios along with varying combinations of Safe Title, Safe Action, and assorted 
grid lines displayed. More information on grid settings can be found in Chapter 3, 
Polishing Gems.

f
f
Import: You may find that it's faster to preset a couple of different common Import 
settings and then switch between them by moving the check mark than having to 
reconfigure it. This is especially helpful if you use the drag-and-drop import method.
f
f
Composer: Composer settings allow you to customize such settings as Always 
Display Two Rows of Data above the Source and Record windows, Undo Only 
Record Side Events, enable Single Mark Editing, and make some choices for when 
you're editing in MultiCam Mode or in Stereo 3D, and to control the behavior of the 
Fast Forward and Rewind functions.
Deleting settings and two warnings
Deleting a setting is as easy as selecting it, and performing either of the methods below:
f
f
Press the Delete key.
f
f
Right-click on it and select Delete.
The following are some warnings and some good news about deleting settings:
f
f
Warning number one: The setting will instantly be deleted. Media Composer will not 
give you an additional dialog box when deleting a setting, which would allow you to 
cancel the operation.
f
f
Warning number two: Once a setting is deleted, it can not be brought back by using 
the Undo command. Instead, you would have to rebuild it all over again.
f
f
Good news: You cannot delete an active setting, so you'll never be left without a 
keyboard setting, for example. Further, this would be a good time to point out that you 
should save some backup copies of your User Settings in case you mistakenly delete 
something or if they become corrupted.
Restoring a setting back to default
The following is useful if/when you've made modifications to a setting and if you want to revert 
back to the default selections later, as they were when Media Composer was first installed. 
Perform the following steps to restore a setting back to default:
1.	 Go to Project window | Settings tab.
2.	 Select a setting.
3.	 You may then do either of the following:


Go to Special menu | Restore To Default


Right-click on the setting and select Restore To Default
4.	 A dialog box will open, which will allow you to simply restore the setting, or to save 
your customized version of the setting as well as provide you with a restored version.

Creating Site Settings
More information about the Site Settings is included in the discussion titled Settings overview. 
Next we'll cover how to make them:
1.	 Open a Project that contains one or more settings you want to use as Site Setting(s).
2.	 Access User and Project settings via Project Window | Settings tab.
3.	 Open Site Settings. From the Special menu, select Site Settings.
4.	 The Site Settings window will open.
5.	 In your Settings list, select one or more settings.
6.	 Drag-and-drop the selected setting(s) into the Site Settings window to copy them.
7.	
Close the Site Settings window.
User Profile Settings – transferring to 
another workstation
User Profile Settings ("User Settings" for short) are several files that are collected together 
in a folder (location detailed ahead). When I talk about backing up your User Settings in a 
moment, it's important to understand that I'm talking about backing up the entire folder, not 
simply the contents of that folder. Further, it's important to note that you should not rename 
the User Profile Settings folder. Media Composer requires that the folder name and 
some of the files inside be named identically.
Your User Settings should be backed up in a few locations so that you can easily access them 
during the workday. User Settings are notorious for becoming corrupt and then causing any 
number of strange, unpredictable, and decidedly unpleasant behaviors. Having a backup of 
your personal User Settings means you can easily replace the bad ones if/when you have to,  
and quickly get back to editing.
Transferring your User Settings between workstations and between platforms is possible,  
which saves you a lot of time not having to rebuild your custom keyboard, Timeline Views,  
Bin Views, and so on. If you are transferring User Settings created with the same version 
of Media Composer which is installed on the destination system you will be using, then 
all you have to do is copy them into the appropriate location (see below). However, if your 
User Settings were created on a different version of Media Composer than what is installed 
on the new system you will be using, then it's not recommended to simply copy your User 
Settings folder over. Because of differences in the platforms and across the different 
versions of software, simply copying User Settings between platforms and/or versions can 
cause very odd and quite objectionable behaviors while editing. So, Avid provides a very 
simple procedure, detailed below.

It should also be noted that Avid recommends that if/when possible, it 
is best to create brand new, fresh User Settings rather than using the 
import process explained next.
Getting ready
First, it's crucial to know where User Settings are located. They can be found at the locations, 
as explained below:
Macintosh: Users | Shared | Avid Media Composer (or Avid Symphony) | Avid 
Users. Your User Settings will be based on the following:
f
f
If you're the only user on that system and have not created any additional  
User Settings, then your settings will be the folder immediately inside the Avid 
Users folder
f
f
If you're one of several editors who use that workstation, then your settings will be 
inside the folder with the logged-in user's name
Windows XP: Documents and Settings | All Users | Shared Documents | Avid 
Media Composer (or Avid Symphony) | Avid Users. Your user settings will be based  
on the following:
f
f
If you're the only user on that system and have not created any additional  
User Settings, then your settings will be the folder immediately inside the Avid 
Users folder
f
f
If you're one of several editors who use that workstation, then your settings will  
be inside the folder with the logged-in user's name
Windows 7 / Windows Vista: Users | Public | Public Documents | Avid Media 
Composer (or Avid Symphony) | Avid Users. Your user settings will be based on  
the following:
f
f
If you're the only user on that system and have not created any additional  
User Settings, then your settings will be the folder immediately inside the Avid 
Users folder
f
f
If you're one of several editors who use that workstation, then your settings will  
be inside the folder with the logged-in user's name

How to do it...
Now that you have some background information about User Settings and know where they 
reside, let's go through the import process. Perform the following steps:
1.	 Make your previously saved, original User Settings (the ones you want to import) 
accessible. So, download them from your cloud storage (for example, iCloud, 
DropBox, etc.), mount your flash drive, or insert your CD.
2.	 Go to the Project Window and select the Settings tab.
3.	 Directly below the Settings tab is the User Profile selection drop-down menu, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 From the User Profile Selection Menu, choose Import User or User Profile.
5.	 The Select User Directory window opens.
6.	 Navigate to your original User Settings folder (on your flash drive, or maybe you've 
copied them to the desktop).
7.	
Select your original User Settings folder.
8.	 Click on the Choose button at the bottom of the Select User Directory window.
9.	 Media Composer will then create a brand new User Settings Profile and place it within 
the workstation's currently logged-in user's User Settings folder.

Interface settings
Interface settings are not a difficult area to experiment with on your own, but I wanted to  
make sure to mention them so you'll check them out, as they've changed a bit over the  
last several releases.
Further, if you happen to be using a version of Media Composer released before version 6, 
there is a programming bug to be aware of—if you set your interface brightness to its lightest/
brightest level, then you may find that the columns in your Effect Palette display as black.  
The fix for this is simply to set your interface brightness to one level darker.
How to do it...
To customize Interface settings, perform the following steps:
1.	 Go to the Project window, select the Settings tab, and double-click on Interface.
2.	 Modify the settings as desired. You can test them out before committing to them by 
clicking on the Apply button.
3.	 See earlier in this chapter for more information about duplicating, deleting, restoring, 
and naming settings. If you have multiple Interface settings by default, or if you have 
created more, then only one of them will have a small check mark just to the left of it. 
The one with the check mark is the one that is active and is telling Media Composer 
how to look. You can change which alternate setting is active by clicking to the left of 
it. This will move the check mark and put that setting into action.
Font size adjustment
As computer screens have increased in resolution, icons and fonts have decreased in size. 
Personally, I find that the default font sizes are too small in most of Media Composer's 
windows and tools (even for some with younger eyes than mine).
As of this writing, it's possible to change the font display only at the following locations:
f
f
The Project Window
f
f
The Composer Window (also known as the Source/Record Window)
f
f
Timeline Views
f
f
Bins (also see the section titled Additional Bin Font Programming later in  
this chapter)
f
f
The Effect Editor window (for this, see the section titled Effect Editor font  
size later in this chapter)

63
How to do it...
To adjust font size, perform the following steps:
1.	 Select the Project Window, Composer Window (also known as the Source/Record 
Window), Timeline Window, or a bin to make it active.
2.	 Go to the Edit menu and select Set Font.
3.	 The Set Font box opens.
4.	 Select a font style and/or type in a font size.
5.	 Click on the OK button.
There's more...
The following are two additional tips regarding font size:
Additional bin font programming
At the time of writing, the feature I will mention here is currently not working in Version 6, but 
does work in earlier releases. I'm including it for those who may be using earlier releases of 
Media Composer, and in the hope that it will be returned in future versions.
Whenever you change the font style and/or size in a bin you are also telling Media Composer 
to repeat that choice for all the bins you create from that point on. This is helpful because 
when you create a new Project you can set the first bin as you prefer and know that the many 
new bins you'll create from that point on will have the attributes you like.
Effect Editor font size
There's not much flexibility with font size in the Effect Editor window, but it is possible  
to enlarge it a bit. Perform the following steps to do so:
1.	 Go to the Project window, click on the Settings tab, and double-click on  
Effect Editor.
2.	 Enable/check the selection that says Large Text.
3.	 Click on OK.

Creating Bin Views
Bin Views are customized displays of information you can access when a bin is placed into 
Text View. These customized Bin Views are available to any bin (and the Media Tool)  
by using the Bin View menu at the bottom of each bin window (see the following screenshot).
In addition to the columns of information that Media Composer comes with, you can create as 
many custom columns of information as you like (for example, best performance, shot type, 
quality, and so on).
After the basic recipe for creating a Bin View, there is information on creating custom columns 
and changing an existing Bin View in the There's more… section.
How to do it...
Perform the following steps to create Bin Views:
1.	 Open a bin.
2.	 Place the bin into Text View from the display menu in the lower-left corner of the bin 
window (it's the menu right next to the Fast Menu).

3.	 Open the Bin Column Selection Window by one of these methods:


Right-click in an open area of the bin and select Choose Columns from the 
contextual menu


Go to the Bin menu and select Choose Columns
4.	 The Bin Column Selection Window opens.
5.	 Select and/or Deselect to set the information you would like to have displayed.
6.	 Click on the OK button.
7.	
Arrange the columns by clicking onto the column heading (for example, Name, 
Creation Date, Tracks) and dragging the column to the left or right. When you reach 
the desired position, release the mouse button.
8.	 Click on the Bin View Menu at the bottom of the bin.
The text in the Bin View Menu will be displayed in italics to let you 
know that changes to the current Bin View have not been saved.
9.	 Select Save As.
10.	 The View Name dialog box opens.
11.	 Enter a name.
12.	Click on OK.
13.	Notice that the name of your Bin View appears in the Bin View Menu and is  
not in italics.
There's more...
Closely related to creating Bin Views is creating custom columns where you can insert 
information that is helpful to you (for example, shot type, director's notes, and so on).  
Next, along with creating custom columns, we'll also cover changing an existing Bin View.
Creating a custom column
To create a custom column, perform the following steps:
1.	 Set the bin to Text View using the display menu in the lower-left corner of the  
bin window (it's the menu right next to the Fast Menu).
2.	 Create an open area in the columns by clicking onto any column heading  
(for example, Name, Creation Date, Tracks) and dragging that column by a short 
distance to the right (making the column that you're moving just slightly overlap the one 
to its right). When you release the mouse button, you'll see the selected column push 
the other columns over to the right. Repeat this process until you have an open area.

3.	 Place your cursor in the open column heading name area that you just created  
(the row at the top of the bin that includes other headings such as Name and so on).
4.	 Click the mouse button to create the text entry box, and type the column  
heading's name.
5.	 When you've completed typing, you can do either of the following:


Hit Enter or Return


Click the mouse's cursor in an open area of the bin
6.	 If you need to make a correction to a custom column heading, then press the  
option/Alt key when you click your cursor in the column heading name region.
7.	
Now that you have created a custom column, you can add text in the cells by  
clicking within that column when your cursor is across from a Clip or Sequence.
Changing an existing Bin View
You can add columns of information and rearrange the columns at any time. You remove a 
column from being displayed by selecting its column heading name and pressing the Delete 
key. Deleting columns of information that come standard with Media Composer will simply 
hide them and no data will actually be erased. Deleting custom columns of information that 
you created will open a second dialog box where you can choose to either permanently delete 
the column and all the information that has been entered into it, or to simply hide it from view. 
Hidden custom columns can be selected in the Bin Column Selection Window at any time. 
You'll find them in the bottom portion of the list.
Also be aware that whenever you make a change to an existing Bin View, its name in the Bin 
View Menu will appear in italics to indicate that any changes you've made have not yet been 
saved. You then have the option of either saving the Bin View as a new one, or updating the 
existing one. To save it as a new Bin View, perform the following steps:
1.	 Click on the Bin View Menu at the bottom of the bin.
2.	 Select Save As and the View Name dialog box opens.
3.	 Enter a name.
4.	 Click on OK. Notice that the name of your Bin View appears in the Bin View Menu  
and is not in italics.
To update an existing Bin View, perform the following steps:
1.	 Press and hold the option/Alt key.
2.	 Click on the Bin View Menu at the bottom of the bin. A list of existing Bin Views  
will appear that includes the word Replace before each of them.
3.	 Select the one that you want to update/replace.

Creating Timeline Views
Creating Timeline Views is one of the easiest things you can do to make your workday more 
efficient. Timeline Views allow you to create a library of different ways you like to have your 
Timeline displayed for various tasks. Timeline Views can be customized with the following:

Settings found in the Timeline Window Fast Menu (hamburger-looking icon) in the 
lower-left corner of the Timeline Window. The settings there include things such 
as track color and the ability to enable/disable features such as Dupe Detection, 
Waveform Display, Clip Color display, and more.
Creating custom Timeline Views is very easy. After the recipe, there will be some ideas and 
tips for Timeline Views in the There's more… section.
How to do it...

3.	 Click on the View Menu at the bottom of the Timeline Window.
4.	 Select the Save As option.
5.	 The View Name dialog box opens.
6.	 Type in a name.
7.	
Click on OK.
There's more...
Next we'll take a look at some additional topics that will help you get more out of using 
Timeline Views.
Default Timeline View
Media Composer provides an easy way to get back to its preset default (you'll find it as the 
very first selection in the Timeline Window's Fast Menu, labeled as Default Setup). Further, 
you may want to consider creating your own Timeline View that you prefer to be your own 
personal default, so that you can access it quickly.
Updating Timeline Views
After making a change to a Timeline View, Media Composer adds a .1 at the end of the name 
and makes the name display in italics. There are two ways to save the updated view without 
creating an entirely new one, as follows:
f
f
From the View Menu select Save As. In the View Menu dialog box erase the .1 that 
was added. When you press the OK button, another dialog box will ask you to either 
cancel or confirm the update.
f
f
Hold down the option/Alt key. When you click on the View Menu, you'll see that each 
selection now includes the word Replace before it. Select the appropriate Timeline 
View to update. Another dialog box will ask you to either cancel or confirm the update.
Offline warning
I suggest that within all the different Timeline Views that you create, you should include the 
Offline warning color display. Perform the following steps:
1.	 Go to the Timeline View Fast Menu and select Clip Color.
2.	 The Clip Color dialog box opens.
3.	 Enable/check the selection at the top labeled as Offline.
4.	 Click on the OK button.
5.	 As long as the active Timeline View includes the Offline color being enabled, any  
time you have offline clips in your sequence they will be displayed as bright red  
and easy to detect.

Timeline background color
At the time of writing, this feature is currently not working in version 6. However, I'm including it 
for anyone using an earlier release, as well as in the hope that it will be returned in the future.
The default Timeline Window has a gray background color. You can actually set it to be 
whatever you prefer. My personal choice is to make the Timeline Window's background black. 
I like the higher contrast and find it easier on my eyes over a long workday. To change the 
Timeline Window's background color, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start with doing one of the following:


Deselect/turn off all the Track Selectors in the Timeline Window.


Clear the Timeline Window from displaying any sequence. Above the Record 
Monitor, where you see the name of your sequence, there is actually a menu 
(Avid calls it the Record Monitor Clip Name Menu). Click there and choose 
Clear Monitor.
2.	 Go to the Timeline Window's Fast Menu and select Background Color (note that if 
any tracks are enabled, this selection will read as Track Color).
3.	 Select a color from the palette (also see the More color selections section ahead).
Switch Timeline Views from the keyboard
When you map Timeline Views to the keyboard or interface (note that mapping buttons and 
menu selections are discussed in more detail later in this chapter), Media Composer assigns 
whatever happens to be the first Timeline View in your settings list as Timeline View #1, the 
second in the list as Timeline View #2, and so on. Perform the following steps:
1.	 Go to the Project Window and click on the Settings tab.
2.	 Locate your Timeline Views.
3.	 Update each Timeline View name by placing a number before it (for example, 1. 
Audio Mixing, 2. Effect Editing, and so on). While this is not technically necessary, it 
will make your life a bit easier when mapping them and will keep them from shifting 
position if you change the name in the future.
4.	 Open your Keyboard settings by double-clicking on them in the settings list.
5.	 Open the Command Palette by selecting the Tools menu and then choosing 
Command Palette.
6.	 In the lower-left corner of the Command Palette, enable the selection that says 
Button To Button Reassignment.
7.	
Select the tab labeled as More.
8.	 Now you can drag-and-drop the "T1" through "T8" buttons onto the keyboard.

When selecting colors for your Timeline tracks or background, you can expand your choices 
beyond what the Media Composer palette gives you. Perform the following steps:
1.	 Hold down option/Alt.
2.	 Go to the Timeline Window's Fast Menu and select Track Color or  
Background Color.
3.	 The Media Composer color palette appears.

Customizing Workspaces
Prior to Media Composer Version 6, the software included both Workspaces and Toolsets. 
They accomplished the same thing, but were set up by the user in different ways. In version 
6, the old Workspaces feature and the Toolsets feature were essentially combined and simply 
named as Workspaces. With that out of the way, let's discuss what they are.
Workspaces are a task-focused feature which you create so that, with just a visit to a menu 
or a quick push of a button you can instantly reveal the tools and windows you need for a 
particular type of work. For example, you go to Windows | Workspaces | Audio Editing. After 
selecting Audio Editing, your Source/Record window instantly reduces in size, the timeline 
expands taller, the Audio Tool opens, the Audio Mixer opens, and the Audio Suite opens. 
Not only do these windows change size and the tools open, but they are then placed on your 
screen(s) exactly where you like them. Again, this all happens because you set it up that way.

Chapter 2
71
By default, Media Composer provides you with some Workspaces that have been pre-named 
and waiting for you to set them up. You can also create your own Workspaces.
More time-saving features related to Workspaces are discussed after this. See the Creating 
Bin Layouts, Linking Bin Layouts with Workspaces, and Mapping Workspaces and Bin  
Layouts recipes.
How to do it...
To customize Workspaces, perform the following steps:
1.	 Go to Windows menu | Workspaces.
2.	 From the submenu, do either of the following:


Select an existing Workspace


Select the New Work Space command
3.	 Once a Workspace is selected or created, it is activated and is said to be the  
"current" Workspace. The currently active Workspace will have a check mark  
next to it in the menu.
4.	 Customize the work environment to your needs and taste. Open the tools you want to 
help you perform a specific task. Arrange and resize the tools, the Timeline Window 
and the Source/Record window exactly as you'd like them, including placing tools 
into tabbed sets.
5.	 Once your tools and interface windows (Bin Layouts are discussed in the next section) 
are arranged as you like, you'll make Media Composer remember that Workspace 
layout. Go to Windows menu | Workspaces | Save Current. You must do this step or 
the Workspace layout will not be saved. Remember to select Save Current.
6.	 Once the Workspace is saved, you may move and close interface windows and 
tools as needed without actually updating the layout. Because you don't save those 
changes, the next time you select that Workspace it will return to its previously saved 
configuration. If you make changes and you do indeed want to update the currently 
active Workspace, then select Windows menu | Workspaces | Save Current. If you 
find yourself updating your Workspaces frequently, you may find it convenient to map  
the Save Current menu selection to a button in the interface or on the keyboard.  
See the Mapping buttons and menu selections recipe later in this chapter for  
more information.

To get you thinking more about how you might customize Workspaces, the following is an 
additional example:

Workspace example
If your currently active Workspace is named "Effects Editing" and you want to customize it, 
then you'd open the Effect Palette and the Effect Editor from the Tools menu. You might 
resize the Source/Record window so that it only displays the Record Monitor*. This is 
accomplished by grabbing the right edge of the Source/Record window (a small, black, 
horizontal arrow will appear) and dragging it to the left-hand side until the Source window 
disappears. Once you have only the Record Monitor* showing, you might grab the lower-right 
corner of it (a small, black, diagonal arrow will appear) and drag diagonally to make it larger 
or smaller. Resize and reposition your Timeline window, Project window, and the Effect 
Editor and Effect Palette windows. With everything as you like it you'd then select Windows | 
Workspaces | Save Current.
*When in Effect Mode, the Record Monitor technically becomes the "Effect Monitor," just in 
case you see it referred to like that in any Media Composer documentation.

Creating Bin Layouts
Bin Layouts made their debut in Media Composer version 6. Like Workspaces, they are a task-
focused feature that, with just a visit to a menu or a push of a button, allow you to instantly 
reveal the bins you want and to have them arranged just as you've saved them, including in 
tabbed sets.
Bin Layouts can be activated independently of Workspaces, or they can be activated 
automatically at the same time you activate a Workspace. Avid refers to this as linking.  
That feature is covered in the Linking Bin Layouts with Workspaces and Mapping Workspaces 
and Bin Layouts recipes.
An important note is that Bin Layouts are not saved as part of your User Settings. They are 
actually specific to a particular Project. See the There's more… section in this recipe for 
additional information on this.
How to do it...
To create Bin Layouts, perform the following steps:
1.	 Go to Windows menu | Bin Layout.

2.	 From the submenu, do one of the following:


Select an existing Bin Layout


Select the New Bin Layout command
3.	 Once a Bin Layout is selected or created, it is activated and is said to be the "current" 
Bin Layout. The currently active Bin Layout will have a check mark next to it in the 
menu.
4.	 Open the bins you want to help you perform a specific task. Arrange and 
resize them, including placing bins into tabbed sets and arrange them on your 
screen(s) as needed.
5.	 Once your bins are arranged as you like, you'll make Media Composer remember that 
layout. Go to Windows menu | Bin Layout | Save Current.
6.	 Once the Bin Layout is saved, you may move and close them as needed without 
actually updating the Layout. Because if you don't save those changes, the next time 
you select that Bin layout it will return to its previously saved configuration. If you 
make changes and you do indeed want to update the currently active Bin Layout, 
then go to Windows menu | Bin Layout | Save Current. If you find yourself updating 
your Bin Layouts frequently, you may find it convenient to map the Save Current 
menu selection to a button in the interface or on the keyboard. See the Mapping 
buttons and menu selections recipe later in this chapter for more information.
At the time of writing, if a new bin is opened and the current Bin View 
is not saved to include this bin, then the bin will close if/when that 
Bin View is reselected (either manually or because that Bin View is 
linked to a Workspace). Further, if a bin that is included in a Bin View is 
deleted and the layout has not been resaved, then you may get an error 
message when that Bin View is reactivated.
There's more...
For easier access, you can map your Bin Layouts to buttons in the interface and/or on the 
keyboard. Further, you can link them to one or more Workspaces so that they become active 
when that Workspace is activated. This is covered in the Linking Bin Layouts with Workspaces 
and Mapping Workspaces and Bin Layouts recipes later in this chapter.
However, since Bin Layouts are Project-specific settings, rather than part of your User Profile 
Settings, the question arises—what happens if you map a Bin Layout to a button and/or link it 
to a Workspace and use those settings with another Project?

Here's an example. While in a Project called "Wisconsin" you created a Bin Layout for  
three bins@ one for music, one for sound effects, and one for voiceover. You named this  
Bin Layout "Music+SFX+VO". You wanted to use this Bin Layout frequently, so you mapped  
it to a button on your Timeline Toolbar and you linked it to your Audio Editing Workspace.  
While in the "Wisconsin" project, the button appears on the Timeline Toolbar with a line  
below the abbreviation.
A month later, the "Wisconsin" project gets completed and you begin working on another 
project called "California". When working on the "California" project, you use your previously 
saved User Settings that include the button mapping and linking you did in the "Wisconsin" 
project for the Bin Layout called "Music+SFX+VO". Since that Bin Layout doesn't exist in the 
"California" Project, when you activate the Audio Editing Workspace, no bins open and, in  
the Timeline Toolbar, the mapped button's abbreviation is now italicized and no longer  
has a line beneath it.
If you want that Bin Layout to be activated while in the "California" project, then do  
the following:
1.	 Create a new Bin Layout and name it exactly as it was named when it was originally 
mapped and/or linked. In this example, it would be named "Music+SFX+VO". You 
must pay particular attention to spaces, symbols, and uppercase/lowercase letters.  
If the name is not identical in all respects, then it will not work. If it is named 
identically, then the text appearing on the button it is mapped to will not be  
italicized and will have a line underneath the abbreviation.
2.	 While that Bin Layout is active, create and/or open the bins you want associated  
with it. There do not have to be the same number of bins as before, nor do the  
names have to be the same as before.
3.	 Arrange the bins as needed for that Bin Layout.
4.	 Save the Bin layout by selecting Windows | Bin Layout | Save Current.
Linking Bin Layouts with Workspaces
There are three things you can do to make using Workspaces and Bin Layouts even faster 
and more useful. The first is linking a Bin Layout with a Workspace so that when you select/
activate a Workspace, the linked Bin Layout simultaneously becomes active too, saving you 
time having to activate it separately. We'll cover that in this recipe. Immediately following 
this recipe are discussions about linking other settings with Workspaces, and mapping 
Workspaces and Bin Layouts to your keyboard and/or interface.

How to do it…
To link Bin Layouts with Workspaces, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start with one of the following:


Go to Windows | Workspaces and select the Workspace you want to link 
with a Bin Layout. Once it is activated (a check mark will appear next to it in 
the menu), then go to the Workspaces and select Properties.


Go to the Project Window, click on the Settings tab, and then go to 
Workspaces. Double-click to open the Workspace you want to link  
with a Bin Layout.
2.	 The Workspace View Setting dialog box will open.
3.	 From the Bin Layout Menu, select the name of the Bin Layout you want to link with 
that Workspace.
4.	 Click on OK to close the Workspace View Setting dialog box.
Linking other settings with Workspaces
When you select/activate a Workspace, it is possible to have other settings in addition to Bin 
Layouts simultaneously becoming active (discussed in the previous recipe), saving you time 
and frustration having to activate them one at a time. The following are two examples:
f
f
Example one – audio mixing: You go to the Windows | Workspaces and select 
Audio Editing. Instantly, several tools open and the interface windows adjust 
themselves to your preset (the method to accomplish this is discussed in the earlier 
section about Workspaces). But the really cool thing is that the Timeline View also 
simultaneously switches to your preferred display setup because you linked it.
f
f
Example two – color correction: You go to Windows | Workspaces and select 
Color Correction. Instantly, tools open, the interface windows adjust themselves to 
your preset, the interface color changes from light gray to black, and the Timeline 
View simultaneously switches to your desired display. Once again, this is all possible 
because you linked these settings to be activated together.
For the following steps, I'll be referring to example two (color correction). More information on 
duplicating, naming, and activating settings can be found at the beginning of this chapter.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Customizing Your Work Environment
76
How to do it…
We'll begin the process by customizing the interface. Perform the following steps:
1.	 For the Interface settings, go to the Project window, click on the Settings tab,  
and select Interface.
2.	 Duplicate the current Interface setting.
3.	 Name the new Interface setting as "CC1". Note that you can name settings with any 
name you'd like, this is simply an example.
4.	 Activate the new "CC1" Interface setting by placing the check mark next to it.
5.	 Open the new "CC1" Interface setting and set the interface brightness to its darkest 
setting (black). You may also make any other changes to that setting that you'd like 
(for example, highlight color).
6.	 Click on OK to close the Interface setting. Note that you may want to re-activate 
the previous light gray Interface setting so you can see the changes occur when 
you activate the Color Correction Workspace. Further, you'll need to repeat the 
full process outlined here to link your light gray interface to your Source/Record 
Workspace. If you do not do this, then the black interface will remain activated when 
you switch back to the Source/Record Workspace.
7.	
Now we'll customize a Timeline View. Go to the Project window, click on the Settings 
tab, and select a Timeline View. Duplicate the existing Timeline View that you want  
to link with a Workspace. One method to duplicate is to go to the Edit menu and  
select Duplicate.
8.	 In this example, name the duplicated Timeline View as "CC1". Note that when typing 
identical names for multiple settings, pay attention to spaces and uppercase/
lowercase letters. The naming has to be identical for the linking to work. To ensure 
that the names are identical, you could copy the name from one setting and paste it 
for the other setting(s). Further, you may want to repeat the full process outlined here 
to link a different Timeline View to your Source/Record Workspace. If you do not do 
this, then the CC1 Timeline View will remain activated when you switch back to the 
Source/Record Workspace.
9.	 To link the Interface and Timeline View settings to a Workspace, start with one  
of the following:


Go to the Windows | Workspaces and select the Workspace you want to link 
with other settings. In this example you would select the Color Correction 
Workspace. Once it is activated (a check mark will appear next to it in the 
menu), then go to Windows | Workspaces | Properties.


Go to the Project window, click on the Settings tab, and scroll to Workspaces. 
Double-click to open the Workspace you want to link with other settings. In this 
example you would open the Color Correction Workspace.

10.	 The Workspace View Setting dialog box will open.
11.	 Enable the setting labeled as Link to named settings.
12.	In the text entry box, type in the name of the setting(s) you want to link with  
that Workspace. In this example you'd type in CC1. Note when typing the name  
for the setting(s) to link to, pay attention to spaces and uppercase/lowercase  
letters. The naming has to be identical for the linking to work. To ensure that the 
name is identical, you could copy the name from one setting and paste it into this  
text entry box.
13.	Click on OK to close the dialog box.
14.	 You'll need to repeat this process for the other Workspaces in order to link your  
other desired Interface settings and Timeline Views to them. If you do not do this, 
then the "CC1" Interface setting and Timeline View will remain activated when you 
switch back to another Workspace. Note that you can link any User Settings that you 
like (for example, keyboard); Interface and Timeline Views were used here simply as  
an example.
15.	Optionally, you can map Workspaces to buttons in the interface or on the keyboard  
for added speed and convenience. See the Mapping Workspaces and Bin Layouts  
and Mapping buttons and menu selections recipes later in this chapter.
Mapping Workspaces and Bin Layouts
You'll find that mapping your Workspaces and Bin Layouts to buttons in the interface or 
buttons on the keyboard will speed up your work and save you some frustration.
The engineers for Avid Media Composer Version 6 have implemented a new method for 
mapping Workspaces and Bin Layouts. In the Command Palette, there is now a new tab  
labeled as Workspaces, which provides you with 12 buttons to which either Workspaces 
or Bin Layouts can be assigned. It's important to note that the only way to map custom 
Workspaces and Bin Layouts is to use these buttons. You can not use the traditional  
Command Palette + "Menu to Button Reassignment" mapping method (discussed in the 
Mapping buttons and menu selections recipe in this chapter) with custom Workspaces or 
Bin Layouts. However, the original six Workspaces still do work with the traditional Command 
Palette + "Menu to Button Reassignment" mapping method. This is good news if you have 
more than 12 of these that you'd like to map. The original six Workspaces that can be mapped 
with the traditional method are—Audio Editing, Color Correction, Source/Record Editing, 
Full Screen Playback, Effects Editing, and Capture.

2.	 Open the Command Palette by clicking on Tools menu | Command Palette.
3.	 Select the Workspace tab.
4.	 Using the menu that appears next to a button, assign a Workspace or Bin Layout  
to that button. In the menu, Workspaces are above the dividing line and Bin Layouts 
are below it.
5.	 In the lower-left corner of the Command Palette, enable Button to Button 
Reassignment.
6.	 Drag-and-drop the desired button(s) from the Command Palette to one or more 
buttons in your interface or on the keyboard.

How to do it...
This recipe will focus on mapping buttons; see the There's more… section for details on 
mapping menu selections. To map buttons perform the following steps:
1.	 Start with one or more of the following:


Open the keyboard settings by going to the Project window, clicking on the 
Settings tab, and double-clicking on Keyboard


Open the mouse settings by going to the Project window, clicking on the 
Settings tab, and double-clicking on Mouse


Open the Fast Menu Tool Palette by clicking on it, and then drag the palette 
up or down to "tear it off" and keep it open for mapping and resizing
2.	 Open the Command Palette by clicking on Tools menu | Command Palette.
3.	 Enable Button to Button Reassignment in the lower-left corner of the palette window.
4.	 Locate a button function from any of the tabbed sections.
5.	 Drag-and-drop a button function to the button location of your choice in the interface, 
on the keyboard, or on the mouse. If there is already a function there, then what you 
map will replace it. Remember that you can map to both the top level and the shift 
level of the keyboard.
See the There's more... section for additional information and see the Settings overview 
discussion for more information about activating, naming, duplicating, deleting, and  
restoring settings.

There's more…
The method for mapping a menu selection to a button is slightly different than simply mapping 
a button function. The details for mapping menu selections are presented below. After that 
you'll also find some useful tips along with some ideas on keyboard mapping.
Mapping menu items using the command palette
Perform the following steps:
1.	 Start with one or more of the following:


Open the keyboard settings by going to the Project window, clicking on the 
Settings tab, and double-clicking on Keyboard


Open the mouse settings by going to the Project window, clicking on the 
Settings tab, and double-clicking on Mouse


Open the Fast Menu Tool Palette by clicking on it, and then dragging the 
palette up or down to "tear it off" and keep it open for mapping and resizing
2.	 Open the Command Palette by clicking on Tools menu | Command Palette.
3.	 Enable Menu to Button Reassignment in the lower-right of the palette window.
4.	 Click on the button you want to place a menu item onto in order to select it. Notice 
when you click the cursor on a button that the cursor's icon has changed to look  
like a tiny menu. If there is already a function there, then what you map will replace  
it. For emphasis, you must first select a button so Media Composer knows where  
you want to place the menu item. Remember that you can map to both the top level 
and the shift level of the keyboard.
5.	 Once a button is selected, it will be highlighted.
6.	 Go to the necessary menu.
7.	
Select the menu item you want to map.
8.	 When the menu item is chosen, it will be mapped to the button. You'll then see on the 
button either an abbreviation of the menu item or, in the case of some tools, you may 
see an icon.
See the section in this chapter titled Keyboard mapping ideas. Also see the discussion in this

Erasing a button
If you want to remove a Media Composer function from a button, then you can use the Blank 
button function found in the Other tab of the Command Palette. Note that you can not use 
the Undo command to reverse this action. Instead you'll have to remap the function that was 
there originally.
Moving a button
When the Command Palette is open and the Button to Button Reassignment selection  
is enabled, you can move a button from one location to another within a button region  
(for example, below the Source and Record Window, on the keyboard, on the Timeline  
Toolbar, or on the Fast Menu Tool Palette) and it will swap positions with the button  
function that is already there.
Copying a button
When the Command Palette is open and the Button to Button Reassignment selection is 
enabled, and when you move a button from one button region of the interface to another, it  
will be copied. For example, moving an existing button function from below your Source 
window to your Timeline Toolbar will copy it.
Keyboard mapping ideas
Are you worried that you'll mess up your keyboard? See the discussions of duplicating 
settings, activating alternate settings, and restoring settings to default at the beginning  
of this chapter in the section called Settings overview to put your mind at ease.
Are you wondering where to start mapping? Start with the "F" keys. Be aware that if you're 
operating a PC, then the F1 key is not available for mapping. It's reserved for the Help system 
of the Windows OS.
My suggestion is to start slowly, only mapping one or two things every day or so, rather than 
to make a lot of changes all at once. Give yourself time to get used to having a function or 
tool at your fingertips in a particular location. Let your mapping grow and change as you need 
it and evaluate it. Be attentive for the first few days with new mappings and assess whether 
the position of a function is working as well as it could for you. Don't be afraid to experiment 
in finding just the right location(s). Also, don't worry about replacing default button functions, 
because once you have a function in a comfortable spot, it won't take long before it's 
embedded in your memory.

Mnemonic devices: This is just a fancy way of saying to place a tool or a function 
onto a button that helps remind you what is mapped there. For example, the following 
are some of mine:


Shift + T: Enable Transition Manipulation


Shift + R: Render At Position / Render In to Out


Shift + I: Start the Import process


Shift + E: Enter Effect Mode


Shift + A: Open the Audio Mix Tool
f
f
Move the default JKL Functions: If you use your right hand for the mouse and 
use your left hand for the keyboard, then you may find it helpful to move the Play 
Reverse, Pause, and Play Forward functions from their default locations (J, K, and L) 
to wherever you feel is the best fit for you. I, along with many other Media Composer 
editors, have moved those functions onto the S, D, and F keys. The advantages of 
doing this are as follows:


Mark In and Mark Out are already available above on the E and R keys.


The pinkie on your left hand is close to the Shift, Ctrl, option/Alt, and 
Command keys.


The Space bar is really easy to hit with your thumb to perform a loop 
playback when in Trim Mode.


Faster/easier to type since your left hand is already in place on the keyboard, 
so you don't have to shift position.


If you're wondering what I did with the default functions that are on the S, D, 
and F keys, I placed them on the Shift level. For example, if I want to clear an 
In Mark, I press Shift + D.

More Detail and Less Detail: Zooming in and out in the Timeline is something we do 
dozens of times a day. The keyboard shortcuts for these are found in the Timeline 
Window's Fast Menu (the hamburger-looking icon) in the lower-left corner of the 
Timeline Window. However, it is even better using the menu to button mapping to 
make these functions a one button push operation. Some popular locations on the

Understanding Track Sensitivity
The results you get when using several functions depends on which tracks are enabled/
selected in the Timeline window and how the transitions are constructed (i.e. straight cuts 
or split edits/"L-Cuts"). I call this Track Sensitivity. The functions that have this programming 
behavior are as follows:
f
f
Fast Forward & Rewind
f
f
Mark Clip
f
f
Go to Previous Edit and Go to Next Edit
How to do it...
Let's use the Fast Forward function to present the basic steps, and to point out the 
differences in the results, depending on what Track Selectors are enabled. In this example 
recipe, it's important to understand that we have several different segments (shots) in the 
sequence that have been placed on tracks V1, A1, and A2, and that the transition between 
each shot is a split edit (in other words, the cuts between shots are not straight, but are 
instead staggered. This is frequently referred to as an L cut). Follow these steps:
1.	 On the Record Track Selector Panel, enable only the V1 Track Selector.
2.	 Place the blue Position Indicator line at the beginning of the sequence.
3.	 Click on the Fast Forward function and notice that the Position Indicator jumps  
to the next transition (cut) on the V1 track.
4.	 Click on the Fast Forward button a second time. Again, it jumps to the next transition 
on the V1 track.
5.	 Now, along with the V1 Track Selector, also, enable the A1 and A2 Track Selectors.  
In other words, enable all the Track Selectors.
6.	 Place the Position Indicator at the beginning of the sequence.
7.	
Click on the Fast Forward function. Notice that the Position Indicator does not jump 
to the next transition on the video track. Instead, it has jumped farther down the 
sequence. Potentially, it has even jumped to the very end of the sequence.
How it works...
Whenever you use Mark Clip, Fast Forward/Rewind, or Go to Previous/Next Edit, Media 
Composer is always looking for edit points (transitions) to pay attention to. When you have  
two or more tracks enabled, Media Composer is looking for the transitions that exist at the 
same time on all the tracks that are enabled.

Below is a comparison of two situations, using the Mark Clip function as an example.
In the first example, you have only the Video track enabled and you park your Position Indicator 
(blue line) within the segment you want to mark, as shown in the following screenshot:
When you click on the Mark Clip button, you can imagine that Media Composer sends out 
radar (metaphorically, of course) in both directions from the Position Indicator, as shown  
in the following screenshot:

88
On the selected track, when it detects a transition to the left-hand side, it places the Mark In, 
and when it detects a transition to the right-hand side, it places the Mark Out. Refer to the 
following screenshot:
That's easy enough. But what happens when there are multiple tracks enabled? In these 
cases, the metaphorical radar is looking for transitions that occur at the same time on all  
the tracks that are enabled.
In this second example, let's look at the same Sequence as earlier, but let's enable V1, A1,  
and A2, as shown in the following screenshot:

89
When you click on the Mark Clip button, Media Composer sends out its radar in both 
directions from the Position Indicator, as shown in the following screenshot:
When it detects a simultaneous transition on all the selected tracks to the left-hand side,  
it places the Mark In and when it detects a simultaneous transition on all the selected tracks 
to the right-hand side, it places the Mark Out as shown in the following screenshot:
Fast Forward/Rewind and Go to Next/Previous Edit pay attention to the Track Selectors  
and transitions in the same way as Mark Clip, except the radar is sent out in just one 
direction (either to the left or to the right).

There's more...
You can tell these functions not to pay attention when multiple tracks are enabled. In other 
words, you can make Media Composer ignore the Track Selectors. If you do this, then the 
radar pays attention to every transition on every track. This can be accomplished in different 
ways, depending on the function, and is discussed below.
Fast Forward/Rewind
These are the two methods that allow you to alter the default behavior:
f
f
Method 1: Press the option/Alt key while using either Fast Forward or Rewind.  
Now the Position Indicator stops at every edit point (transition)  
on every track no matter what tracks are enabled.
f
f
Method 2: Make Fast Forward and Rewind always ignore the Track Selectors  
(and save yourself the need of pressing the option or the Alt key). Go to the Project 
Window | Settings tab | Composer settings | FF/REW tab, and then enable the 
selection that says Ignore Track Selectors.
Mark Clip and Go to Previous/Next Edit
Below are the two methods that allow you to alter the default behavior:
f
f
Method 1: Press the option/Alt key when using the Go To Previous/Next Edit or 
Mark Clip functions. Using option/Alt key along with Go to Previous/Next Edit 
makes the Position Indicator stop at every edit point (transition) on every track. 
Using option/Alt key along with Mark Clip will mark the duration based on the two 
closest transitions from the Position Indicator on any track. This is useful enough 
that I have both Mark Clip as well as option/Alt + Mark Clip (see Method 2) mapped 
to my keyboard.
f
f
Method 2: Unlike Fast Forward/Rewind, there isn't a setting to change the way Mark 
Clip and Go to Previous/Next Edit behave, but all is not lost. If you'd rather not hold 
down the option/Alt key with these functions, you can add the option/Alt modifier 
right to the button, so it becomes a one button-push operation. I'll use the Go to 
Previous/Next Edit function in their default locations on the A and S keys for the 
example of how to do this below.
Follow these steps:
1.	 Open your Keyboard settings by clicking on the Project Window | Settings tab | 
Keyboard.
2.	 Open the Command Palette by clicking on Tools menu | Command Palette.
3.	 Enable the Button to Button Reassignment selection in the lower left side of the 
Command Palette.

4.	 On the Command Palette, select the tab labeled as Other.
5.	 In the first column of buttons on the Command Palette you'll see a button labeled 
Add Option Key (on Mac) or Add Alt Key (on PC).
6.	 Drag-and-drop the Add Option Key function or the Add Alt Key function right onto the 
Go to Previous Edit button on your keyboard (if it's still in its default location, it's on 
the letter A key).
7.	
After adding this, get out your magnifying glass. If you look closely, you'll see a  
very small black dot has appeared just below the arrow symbol to indicate that  
the option/Alt modifier has been added.
8.	 Repeat step 6 for the Go to Next Edit button.
Snapping actions for the Position Indicator 
and in Segment Mode
With just a couple of keyboard shortcuts, you can make your Position Indicator snap right  
to the transition you want, and in the exact position you need, exactly on the head frame  
(first frame) or on the tail frame (last frame).. Plus, the convenient thing is that Media 
Composer uses the same keyboard shortcuts for segments when you're moving them around.
How to do it...
Let's begin by making the Position Indicator or a segment Snap to Head. Follow these steps:
1.	 Press and hold the cmd (on Mac) or Ctrl (on PC) keys.
2.	 To make the Position Indicator snap, drag it forward or backward in the sequence, or 
click the cursor near a transition, to make the Position Indicator snap to the Head 
Frame (first frame) of a segment.
3.	 To make a segment snap, do the following: Select a segment with either Segment 
Mode arrow (red or yellow). Now, when dragging segments, holding the cmd or Ctrl 
key makes the beginning (left-hand side, or head) of the segment snap to transitions 
that exist on any track.
4.	 Next we'll make the Position Indicator or a segment Snap to Tail.
5.	 Press and hold the keys cmd + option/Ctrl + Alt.
6.	 Drag the Position Indicator forward or backward in the sequence, or click  
the cursor near a transition, to make the Position Indicator snap to the 
Tail Frame (last frame) of a segment.
7.	
Select a segment with either Segment Mode arrow. Now, when dragging segments,  
holding cmd + option/Ctrl + Alt makes the end (right-hand side, or tail) of the 
segment snap to transitions that exist on any track.

There's more...
Below are two additional keyboard shortcuts that apply only when you're using Segment 
Mode, along with some helpful details about snapping with the Position Indicator and  
placing Marks.
Additional Segment Mode shortcuts
Press the cmd + Shift keys (on Mac) simultaneously or Ctrl + Shift keys (on Windows) 
simultaneously – this is useful when you want to move segment(s) from one track to another 
without getting out of sync. This keyboard shortcut will lock (constrain) segments into their 
current place in time on the Timeline when you move them up or down to another track. It 
should be noted that, at the time of writing, when you use this keyboard shortcut and move a 
segment, you will hear an alert sound. This is actually telling you that you have either enabled 
or disabled what Avid refers to as Four Frame Display. Using this keyboard shortcut was how 
Four Frame Display was enabled and disabled in the past. Now that it has been programmed 
to constrain segments to moving only up or down, it has become a bit of an annoyance. I'm 
sure that the enable/disable programming will be removed in a future release.
Press option (on Mac) or Alt (on Windows) – this keyboard shortcut actually doesn't control 
snapping, but since it has to do with moving segments, it made sense to include it here. Press 
the option key or Alt key while moving segments (and moving slowly) to ensure that you are 
moving just one frame at a time, regardless of the level of detail (how zoomed in or out you 
are) in the Timeline window.
Details about snapping
When you have snapped the Position Indicator line to the head of a segment, Media 
Composer will display a rather small, white, for lack of a better term I'll call it a bracket symbol, 
in the lower left-hand side corner of the Record Monitor. When you've snapped to the tail, the 
bracket symbol will be displayed in the lower right-hand side corner of the Record Monitor. 
Refer to the following screenshot:

Paying attention to where you place the Position Indictor is important as you edit. Notice 
that when you zoom in (using More Detail or the Scale Bar) to take a very close look at the 
Position Indicator, you'll see that the blue line isn't one single line at all. This is because the 
Position Indicator parks on, and designates, one frame. It's actually made of two lines. The 
solid line of the Position Indicator is on the left-hand side (the head) of the frame and the 
dotted line is on the right-hand side (the tail) of the frame. When you set a Mark In, it's placed 
on the head side, and when you set a Mark Out, it's placed on the tail side. The following 
screenshot shows that just one frame has been marked:
Enabling and disabling all Track Selectors 
from the keyboard
There will be a variety of instances when enabling or disabling all the Track Selectors will be 
necessary or helpful. One example is when you have many tracks and before you make an 
edit, you have to scroll up or down to check the status (enabled or disabled) of the hidden 
tracks. However, with the help of the next simple recipe, you can enable/disable all the tracks 
(even the ones you can't see).

How to do it...
Follow these steps:
1.	 Select the Source Window, Record Window, or the Timeline Window.
2.	 Use one of these keyboard shortcuts found in the Edit Menu:


Press cmd and A keys (on Mac) or Ctrl + A keys (on Windows) simultaneously 
to select all tracks


Press the A key along with Shift and Cmd (on Mac), or Shift and Ctrl  
(on Windows) to deselect all tracks
There's more...
Media Composer also allows you to map all 24 video Track Selectors and all 24 audio Track 
Selectors to the keyboard. You'll find them in Tools menu | Command Palette | Tracks tab 
(see the Mapping buttons and menu selections recipe in Chapter 2, Customizing your Work 
Environment for more information if you are unfamiliar with mapping). However, by default, 
Media Composer lets you enable or disable Track Selectors from the keyboard for a small 
number of tracks. Here is the default Track Selector keyboard mapping: V2 on the 7 key, V1  
on the 8 key, A1 on the 9 key, A2 on the 0 key, A3 on the – key, and A4 on the = key.
Enabling and disabling Track Selectors 
using the Shift key plus drag method
There will be times when you want to enable or disable a series of adjacent Track Selectors. 
Some examples would be enabling or disabling all the video tracks or all the audio tracks, or 
perhaps you have 10 audio tracks that are disabled and you want to enable only A5, A6, A7, 
and A8. This recipe of steps is a fast way to enable or disable a number of adjacent tracks in 
one quick swiping movement with your cursor.
How to do it...
Follow these steps:
1.	 Press and hold the Shift key.
2.	 Click and hold the mouse button down on any Track Selector on either the Source 
side or the Record side of the Track Selector Panel.

3.	 Quickly drag the cursor either up or down over the Track Selectors.

If the initial click on a Track Selector disables it (turns it off), then as you 
drag, it will only disable the ones that is enabled


If the initial click on a Track Selector enables it (turns it on), then as you  
drag, it will only enable the ones that are disabled
How it works...
To demonstrate how this works, let's say I have eight video tracks in my Sequence. Currently 
enabled are V1, V3, V5, and V7. To quickly disable all of my video tracks with this method, 
I would hold down the Shift key, then I'd click and hold down the mouse button on the V1 
Track Selector. Finally, I would quickly drag the cursor upward across the other video Track 
Selectors. The result: all the video tracks would be disabled.
Enabling and disabling Track Selectors 
using the Lasso
There will be instances when you would like to reverse the status (enabled or disabled) of one 
or more Track Selectors. One example would be if all the video and audio Track Selectors were 
enabled and you needed to quickly disable all of the video Track Selectors. See the How it 
works... section for another example.
How to do it...
Follow these steps:
1.	 Click and hold the mouse button down in an area of the Timeline window (not within 
the tracks of the sequence) that is either above or below the Track Selectors for 
either the Source side or the Record side.
2.	 Drag the cursor across the Track Selectors. Note that you will see a ghosted box  
(the Lasso), and that you do not have to surround the Track Selectors with the  
Lasso. You only have to make the Lasso come into contact with a Track Selector.
3.	 Release the mouse button.

How it works...
Here is another example to illustrate how lassoing within the Track Selector Panel could be 
useful: I have four video tracks and six audio tracks in my Sequence. All the video tracks are 
enabled (turned on) and all the audio tracks are disabled. To quickly flip this around, I would 
click the cursor in the Timeline window above the video Track Selectors and hold down the 
mouse button. Then I would drag down across all the video and audio Track Selectors to 
create the Lasso. When I release the mouse button, all the video tracks would be  
turned off and all the audio tracks would be turned on.
Note that for anyone familiar with, or currently using, earlier releases of Avid Media Composer, 
in the past you could press the Ctrl key, which allowed you to lasso inside the Track Selector 
Panel (for example, lassoing over just V1, A1, and A2). At the time of writing, that is not 
currently available due to changes in programming that affected the Ctrl key.
Replace Edit: How and why
By default, you can find Replace Edit in the Fast Menu Tool Palette (the Fast Menu that, by 
default, is between the Splice In and Overwrite buttons as well as in the Timeline Toolbar), 
and in the Command Palette (Tools menu | Command Palette | Edit tab).
I often call Replace Edit the mysterious blue arrow, because so many don't know what it does 
and avoid using it. This is too bad because Replace Edit is a very useful tool that allows you to 
quickly replace existing segments (shots) in your Sequence as well as to sync a specific frame 
of video to a specific frame of audio (or vice versa).
Since I call it the mysterious blue arrow, which sounds like the name of a cartoon super hero, 
let me first explain its two super powers, which are as follows:
f
f
You don't have to Mark In or Out in either the Source Window or the Record Window 
when you use it. Replace Edit knows how much to edit into the Sequence based on 
the duration of the segment that's already in the Sequence.
f
f
It is always syncing whatever frame your Position Indicator is parked on in the 
Source Window to the spot where your Position Indicator is parked in the Sequence.
If this seems confusing, don't worry. After I go through the general steps, I'll also give you 
some specific examples.

How to do it...
When using Replace Edit, you can replace video only, audio only, or video and audio at the 
same time. It's simply a matter of what Track Selectors you've enabled.
As an example, this is a simple set of steps for replacing only a video segment. Additional 
information is in the There's more section that comes after these basic steps:
1.	 Load the desired shot into the Source Window.
2.	 In the Source Window, place the Position Indicator on the first frame of video you 
want to place into the Sequence. You do not need to Mark In or Mark Out.
3.	 In the Sequence, park the Position Indicator on the first frame of the segment (shot) 
you want to replace. You do not need to Mark In or Mark Out.
4.	 Patch the Source Video Track Selector to the Sequence video track that contains the 
shot you want to replace.
5.	 On the Source Track Selector Panel, enable the video track.
6.	 On the Record/Timeline Track Selector Panel, enable only the video track.
7.	
Click on Replace Edit.
There's more...
Let's take a look at another way to use Replace Edit, and two applications of Replace Edit:
In and Out Marks work too
In addition to using existing transitions (edit points) in the Timeline window to determine the 
duration of video and/or audio to edit into the sequence, Replace Edit will also pay attention 
to a duration that you set in the Sequence using Mark In and Mark Out.
Syncing example with Replace Edit
You have edited a music track into your Sequence and have edited images on top of it. At one 
point in the music, there is a loud drum beat and you decide to replace the existing shot at 
that point in the Sequence with video of a hammer hitting a nail. Specifically, you want the 
frame when the hammer hits the nail to sync with the loud drum beat. Below are the steps to 
accomplish this:
1.	 In the Source Window, park the Position Indicator on the frame where the hammer 
first comes into contact with the nail. Mark In and Mark Out are not required.
2.	 In the Sequence, park the Position Indicator on the loud drum beat. Mark In and 
Mark Out are not required. If it helps you, an option is to display the audio waveform 
so you can see the exact location of the loud drum beat.

3.	 Patch the Source Video Track Selector to the Sequence video track that contains the 
shot you want to replace.
4.	 Enable the Video Track Selector for the Source.
5.	 Enable only the Video Track Selector for the Record side.
6.	 Press Replace Edit.
7.	
The result is that the previous shot is replaced and the image of the hammer hitting 
the nail occurs at the same moment as the drum beat.
Fast montage creation
Here's a classic tip that is great when you want shots placed at precise intervals. One example 
of this would be having your shots change on the beat of the music.
Since Replace Edit uses existing transitions (edit points) to determine how much video and/
or audio to place into the Sequence, what you're going to do first is to quickly create a series of 
transitions on an empty video track, and then use Replace Edit to swap the Filler for video.
Follow these steps:
1.	 First you need to map the Add Edit function to a convenient button on the keyboard. 
You can find Add Edit by going to Tools menu | Command Palette | Edit tab (see the 
Mapping buttons and menu selections recipe in Chapter 2, Customizing Your Work 
Environment if you need information about how to map this).
2.	 Edit the music into your sequence.
3.	 If you do not already have an empty video track, then create one by going to Clip 
menu | New Video Track.
4.	 Enable only the Track Selector for the empty video track.
5.	 Play your sequence.
6.	 Now you're going to tap to the beat of the music. As the music plays, tap the Add Edit 
function you mapped on the keyboard. Note that the edits you create will not appear 
until playback has stopped.
7.	
After stopping the playback, you'll have a series of transitions in the video track that 
correspond to the beats in the music. If you missed a beat by a frame or two, the 
transition can be double-roller trimmed to adjust its position at any time, even if 
there's only Filler on the track.
8.	 You can now use Replace Edit to replace the segments of Filler between each Add 
Edit with video.

Sync Point Editing: How and why
Sync Point Editing is an extra ability you temporarily give to the Overwrite edit function when 
you need it. After using it, you turn this ability off. Sync Point Editing allows you to perform an 
Overwrite edit and at the same time tell Media Composer to sync a specific frame of audio 
and/or video in the Source Window with a specific frame of audio or video in the Sequence. 
You use the Position Indicators in the Source window and in the Timeline window to 
establish the sync point.
Getting ready
For this example, imagine that you have edited a documentary about boxing and you now want 
to add in a sound effect of a punch to enhance the knockout blow. You have imported a clip of 
punch sound effects off of a CD, and the clip contains 12 different punch sounds. Some are 
louder and more forceful than others, so you'll have a choice to make. Further, you want the 
sound effect to sync with the moment the champion boxer hits the challenger.
How to do it...
Follow these steps:
1.	 Load the sound effect clip into the Source Window.
2.	 Determine the specific punch sound effect that you like.
3.	 Mark In and Mark Out around the entire desired sound effect.
4.	 While still in the Source Window, park your Position Indicator on the very first 
frame of the punch sound effect. See the There's more section for some options on 
accomplishing this.
5.	 In the Sequence, park your Position Indicator on the video frame you want to sync 
the audio to. In this example, I would park it on the first frame that the champion's 
glove makes contact with the challenger's jaw.
6.	 Patch the Source audio tracks to your desired Sequence audio tracks.
7.	
On the Source side, enable the necessary Audio Track Selector(s).
8.	 On the Record side of the Track Panel, enable only the necessary Audio Ttack 
Selector(s).

9.	 Now you need to tell Media Composer that when you make the Overwrite edit to pay 
attention to the frame that the Position Indicator is parked on in the Source Window 
and to place that frame where the Position Indicator is parked in the Sequence. 
To do this, we'll give the Overwrite edit function the Sync Point Editing ability by 
following either of these methods:


Method one: Right-click in either the Source Window or the Record Window 
(it doesn't matter which). From the contextual menu that appears, select 
Sync Point Editing. Once you have done this, take a close look at the 
Overwrite button. You will see that the arrow icon has become a bit smaller 
and, more noticeably, an orange light has turned on below it.


Method two: Start by clicking anywhere in the Composer Window (also 
known as the Source/Record Window) to make it active. Then, go to the 
Special menu | Sync Point Editing. Once you have done this, take a close 
look at the Overwrite button. You will see that the arrow icon has become a 
bit smaller and, more noticeably, an orange light has turned on below it.
10.	 Press the Overwrite button (which has the orange light now turned on) to make  
the edit.
11.	 Once you have completed the edit, you'll want to turn off the Sync Point Editing 
feature. If you use this a lot, consider mapping it from the Special menu to a 
convenient button on the keyboard. See the Mapping buttons and menu selections 
recipe in Chapter 2, Customizing your Work Environment for more information on  
how to do this.

Seeing source material in the Timeline 
Window
By default, the Timeline Window displays the sequence that's loaded in Record Window. 
However, it's possible to have the Timeline Window display what's loaded in the Source 
Window. Being able to do this is useful when you have loaded a sequence into the Source 
Window (when you're editing a portion of one sequence into another) and need to see  
the transitions, or when you want to see the audio waveform for what's loaded in the  
Source Window.
To do this, you use the Toggle Source/Record in Timeline function, which is found by default 
in the bottom left-hand side of the Timeline Window next to the Video Quality Menu. It's an 
icon that resembles the Source and Record Windows, where one window of the icon is dark 
and the other is light, as shown in the following screenshot:
When you click on it to enable it, the button will turn green. You'll also see that the Position 
Indicator line in the Timeline window turns green to remind you that you're looking at material 
in your Source window.
It's important to know that when the Toggle Source/Record in Timeline function is enabled, 
the Track Selector Panel is reversed. This means that the Source Track Selector buttons 
are now on the right-hand side and the Record/Timeline Track Selector buttons are now on 
the left-hand side. Media Composer will let you make edits while the Toggle Source/Record 
button in Timeline function is enabled and the Track Selector Panel is reversed. Personally, 
I find that disabling Toggle Source/Record in Timeline, and switching back to the standard 
Timeline display, avoids confusion when making the edit.

How to do it…
This example is for how to display the audio waveform for material in the Source window. 
Follow these steps:
1.	 Before enabling the Toggle Source/Record in Timeline function, turn the  
Audio Waveform display on for all tracks or for individual tracks using either  
of these methods:


For all tracks, go to Timeline Window | Fast Menu | Audio Data | Waveform.


For specific tracks, open the Track Control Panel with the small arrow 
located just to the right-hand side of the Timecode display in the upper  
left of the Timeline window. Once it's open, you'll see that each track has  
a variety of small buttons and menus next to it. The one you want to enable 
is the one furthest to the left-hand side in the panel that looks like a 
miniature waveform.
2.	 Once the waveform is displayed, enable the Toggle Source/Record in Timeline 
function, as described previously.
Clipboard tips
First, what is the Clipboard? The Clipboard is Media Composer's memory bank. When certain 
operations are performed (discussed in just a moment), it places information temporarily into 
the Clipboard. When the information in the Clipboard is displayed in either the Source Window 
or the Record Window, it is also placed as a selection in that window's Clip Name Menu above 
it. For emphasis, I want to repeat that the information is only stored there temporarily. In order  
to preserve it for long-term, future use, you must make a Sub-Sequence of it and place it in the  
a bin.
What does the Copy to Clipboard icon look like? In Version 3 of the software, it was updated 
to look like a paper document with its corner folded over placed on top of another document, 
also with its corner folded over, as shown in the following screenshot:
Personally, I think the Clipboard is one of the most useful features and is largely underused  
by many editors. First, I'll take you through how it is used in its default configuration and  
then I'll give you an alternative that I think is better (at least for me, in the way that I use  
the Clipboard).

How to do it…
In this example, we'll use the Clipboard in its default configuration. See the There's more 
section for more tips to make the Clipboard even more useful.
1.	 Load a sequence into the Timeline window.
2.	 Enable only the tracks of the Sequence that you want to copy to the Clipboard.
3.	 Mark In and Mark Out around the region of the Sequence you want to copy to  
the Clipboard.
4.	 Next, press the Copy to Clipboard button, which is located by default in one  
of these locations:


Under Record Monitor, on the far right-hand side of the button bar


On the Fast Menu Tool Palette


On the letter C on the keyboard
5.	 Now you must retrieve the material you've copied to the Clipboard using one  
of these methods:


From above the Source Window, select the Clip Name Menu and then  
choose Clipboard Contents.


From above the Record Window, select the Clip Name Menu and then  
choose Clipboard Contents.


Use the Clipboard Contents button as follows: First, make either the 
Source Window or the Record Window active (whichever window is active 
determines where the Clipboard contents will be displayed). Then press 
the Clipboard Contents button. This button can be found in Tools menu | 
Command Palette | Edit tab.
See the Mapping buttons and menu selections recipe in Chapter 2, Creating Your Work 
Environment for more information if you are unfamiliar with mapping.

Let's now see how to make the Clipboard a more efficient tool, how you can use it along with

Making Copy To Clipboard faster and more efficient

Method 1 is to press option and click on Copy to Clipboard, or press Alt and and click 
on Copy to Clipboard. When you do this, whatever material you have decided to copy 
to the Clipboard will instantly be loaded into the Source Window.

f
f
Method 2 is to make Copy to Clipboard instantly load whatever has been copied into 
the Source Window by default (without having to press the option or Alt key). You do 
this by adding the option or Alt modifier right to whichever Copy to Clipboard buttons 
for which you'd like it to become a one-button push operation. Here's an example of 
how to modify the Copy to Clipboard button that's on the keyboard:
i.	
Open your Keyboard settings by going to Project Window | Settings tab 
| Keyboard.
ii.	
Open the Command Palette by going to the Tools menu and selecting 
Command Palette.
iii.	 Enable the Button to Button Reassignment selection in the lower of the 
Command Palette.
iv.	 On the Command Palette, select the tab labeled as Other.
v.	
In the first column of buttons on the Command Palette, you'll see a 
button labeled Add Option key (Mac) or Add Alt Key (PC).
vi.	 Drag-and-drop the Add Option/Alt Key function right onto the Copy to  
Clipboard button on your keyboard (if it's still in its default location, it's 
on the letter C).
vii.	 If you look very closely, you'll see a small black dot has appeared on the 
button to indicate that the option/Alt modifier has been added.
Using Copy to Clipboard with Lift and Extract
f
f
option/Alt + Lift
f
f
option/Alt + Extract
Every time you Lift or Extract, that material is also saved to the Clipboard. If you want to Lift or 
Extract and also have that material become instantly available in the Source Window, then all 
you have to do is press the option/Alt key when you perform either of those edits.
Examples of using Copy To Clipboard
Example one is the ability to patch to another track: Media Composer does allow you to Copy 
and Paste. However, there is a limitation that you can only Paste onto the same track you 
copied from. If you're making a video effect that requires you to copy some video from V1  
and place it on V2, then Copy to Clipboard allows you to easily copy it and then to patch  
it to the required track.
Example two is the ability to move sections of the Sequence: Sometimes using Segment 
Mode to move sections of the sequence is not convenient because the distance is far, 
because the section you're moving has split edits at one end (or both), or because the section 
you want to move includes only portions of segments. Rather than having to make a Sub-
Sequence first, you can option/Alt + Lift or option/Alt + Extract a marked section out of the 
sequence. This not only performs the Lift or Extract but also immediately places that material 
into the Source Window, ready for you to relocate.

Example three is using it as a method to plug holes of silence: Frequently there will be areas 
in the dialog track that only contain Filler. The problem is that Filler is totally silent compared 
to the natural background sound that's included with the dialog. You want the dialog track 
to flow without any dropouts of silence. The solution is to fill those silent holes of Filler with 
some ambience. Very often the ambience you need will already be available in the Sequence 
at some point where the speaker has paused. If this is the case, you can copy that ambience 
to the Clipboard and then quickly Overwrite the silent Filler.
Using the Match Frame function 
The icon for Match Frame is the same one used for Master Clips. By default, the Match 
Frame function can be found under the Source Window as well as in the Fast Menu Tool 
Palette in the Timeline Toolbar.
Getting Ready
The most common mistake I see made is when people want to use Match Frame to match 
back from the Timeline window (as we will be doing in the example recipe in a moment) they 
mistakenly click on the Match Frame button that's under the Source Window. Instead, to 
Match Frame from the Timeline window, either use the Match Frame button found in the Fast 
Menu Tool Palette or you can map it to a convenient location under the Record Monitor, on 
the Timeline Toolbar, or on your keyboard. 
See the Mapping buttons and menu selections recipe in Chapter 2, Customizing Your Work 
Environment for more information if you are unfamiliar with mapping.
How to do it…
The following recipe of steps demonstrates the default behavior of Match Frame when it is 
used on a sequence that is loaded into the Record Monitor/Timeline window. See the There's 
more section for additional methods of using Match Frame.
1.	 Place the Position Indicator over a segment in the sequence.
2.	 Enable the Track Selector for the segment you want to match back to, and make sure 
that Track Selector is also the uppermost selector that is enabled. For emphasis, Match 
Frame pays attention only to the top-most Track Selector that is enabled.
3.	 Click on the Match Frame function that is on the Fast Menu Tool Palette, or which 
you have mapped underneath the Record Monitor, onto the Timeline Toolbar, and/
or onto your keyboard.
4.	 The source clip will then be loaded into your Source monitor. For example, if you 
originally edited that shot into your sequence from a Subclip, then the Subclip  
will be loaded.

Next, we'll examine the programming of Match Frame in more depth.
Using it with the Record Monitor or the Timeline – when the Record Monitor or Timeline is 
active, Match Frame will load the clip your Position Indicator is parked on into the Source 
Window. Be aware of the following:
f
f
You must enable the track that contains the clip you want to use Match Frame  
with (I'll call that the target track).
f
f
Make sure that no other video Track Selector that's above your target track is 
enabled. In other words, your target track must be the top-most enabled track.
f
f
When Match Frame loads the clip into the Source Window, by default it erases  
any previous Marks that may have been placed in the clip and places a Mark In  
on the matching frame. In a moment there will be a tip on this topic.
Using it with the Source Window; using Match Frame on items loaded into the Source 
Window will do the following:
f
f
Subclip: When used on a Subclip that's loaded in the Source Window, Match Frame 
will take you back to the original Master Clip. Michael Phillips (who helped technically 
review this book) further relates that track selection is also observed if the Subclip is 
an AutoSync clip, where the video and audio have come from two different sources. 
This means that since the video is from one clip and the audio is from another, if the 
video track is enabled, then you'll be matched back to the original video-only clip. If 
you need to match back to the original audio-only clip, then you'll need to deselect 
the Video Track Selector.
f
f
Motion Effect Clip: When you use this on a Freeze Frame, Slo-Mo, or Fast-Mo clip, 
Match Frame will take you back to the Master Clip or Subclip used to create it.
When Match Frame loads the clip into the Source Window, by default it erases any 
previous Marks in the clip and places a Mark In on the matching frame. See the 
following for a tip on this topic.
Next, here are some very useful tips when using Match Frame:
f
f
option/Alt: Press option/Alt and click on Match Frame to retain the Marks that were 
most recently placed in the clip rather than have them erased and a new Mark In 
placed on the matching frame.
f
f
Match Frame Track: When you use Match Frame from the Timeline Window, you 
must enable the track that contains the clip you want to use Match Frame with  
(I'll call that the target track) and you have to be sure that no other Track Selector 
that's above your target track is enabled. In other words, your target track must be 
the top-most enabled track. This can be a bit frustrating if you have to keep turning 
tracks on and off. Instead you can Match Frame from any track, whether it's enabled 
or not, by:

First, park the Position Indicator on the clip to which you want to Match 
Frame back (just as we normally do). Then right-click on the Track Selector 
button for the track that contains your target clip. From the contextual menu 
that appears, select Match Frame track.


Press option/Alt when you use Match Frame Track to retain the marks that 
were most recently placed in the clip rather than have them erased and  
have a new Mark In placed on the matching frame.
Using the Reverse Match Frame function
Reverse Match Frame allows you to search the Sequence for a specific frame  
of source material on whatever Timeline tracks have their Track Selectors enabled. 
Remember, it is only searching for one frame, not an entire shot, and it pays attention  
to which tracks are enabled.
This function has recently been improved. In the past, it searched the audio tracks and  
only track V1. It will now search all video tracks, if they are enabled.
Getting Ready
Reverse Match Frame can be found in Tools menu | Command Palette | Other tab. You 
would map it either under the Source Window or onto the keyboard (for use when the 
Source Window is active). See Mapping buttons and menu selections recipe in Chapter 2, 
Customizing Your Work Environment for more information if you are unfamiliar with mapping.
How to do it...
1.	 In the Timeline, enable the Track Selectors for the track(s) you want Reverse Match 
Frame to search. Optionally, go to Edit menu | Select All.
2.	 Load a clip into the Source Window.
3.	 In the Source Window, park the Position Indicator onto the frame you want Reverse 
Match Frame to search for.
4.	 In the Source Window, enable the Track Selector(s) for the track(s) you want Reverse 
Match Frame to use for the search. Optionally, go to Edit | Select All.
5.	 If you've used that frame multiple times, then each time you press the Reverse 
Match Frame button, the Position Indicator will jump to each instance of that  
frame in the Sequence.

Setting clip colors in a bin
Note that you can also set different colors for segments (clips) in the Sequence. You'll find the 
details on that in the recipe that follows this one.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to set Clips Colors in a bin:
1.	 Put your bin into Text View. Notice the column of squares to the left side of the clip's 
name. These are the color swatches.
2.	 Select the clips and/or sequences.
3.	 Once selected, set the color with one of the following methods:


Right-click on the color swatch of one of the selected items and make  
a selection from the palette


Go to the Edit menu, and select Clip Color, and make a selection from  
the palette
4.	 In the Timeline Window, to display the colors you've assigned to the clips in the bin. 
Go to Timeline Window Fast Menu (the hamburger-looking icon in the bottom left 
side of the Timeline Window) | Clip Color | Source.
Setting clip colors in the Timeline Window
Note that Avid refers to the shots in your sequence as both clips and segments. So, don't let 
that cause you any confusion.
How to do it...
1.	 In order to set clip colors in the Timeline Window, you must first enable their display. 
Go to the Timeline Window Fast Menu (the hamburger-looking icon in the bottom 
left-hand side of the Timeline Window) | Clip Color | Timeline Local.
2.	 Select a clip in the Sequence by using either of the Segment Mode Arrow tools (it 
doesn't matter which one you use). To select multiple segments, hold down the Shift 
key as you make selections. Alternatively, you can also select segments by lassoing 
left to right around one or more of them, or you can use the Select Left, Select 
Right, or Select In/Out functions.

There's more...
So, what might you use Clip Color for? Here are a few possibilities:
f
f
Stock Footage: Typically, a stock footage company will initially provide you with clips 
that have a watermark of some sort on the image. Frequently, the Watermark is a 
timecode window or some other overlay that prevents you from using the footage 
without properly licensing and paying for it. At the finishing stage, you've got to order 
replacement footage (without the watermark) for the portions you've actually used. 
Once you have that, then the watermarked shots need to be replaced with the non-
watermarked versions. Using clip color is a great way to make sure you can easily and 
quickly locate all the stock footage in your Sequence. Personally, in the bin, I label all 
stock footage clips as orange. Then, when I need to see what non-watermarked clips I 
need to order, or which ones need to be Overwritten, all I have to do is display Source 
Clip Color in the Timeline window.
f
f
Camera Angles: When editing with Group Clips/MultiCam, you can color each 
camera angle's Master Clip with a different color. For example, camera A is rose, 
camera B is green, camera C is blue, and camera X is yellow. Then, when you display 
Source Clip Color, as you switch cameras in the Sequence, the colors will indicate 
which angle you've switched to. Further, it helps you to later analyze the Sequence to 
get an idea of where, and in what proportions, you've used the different angles.
f
f
Characters: When editing a scene, you can code each character's Master Clip with a 
different color. When you display Source Clip Color, this can help you to analyze the 
sequence to get an idea of which characters visually dominate the scene.
f
f
Areas For Attention: You can quickly lasso left to right around a large group of 
segments in the Sequence and then use Local Clip Color to label all of them. This 
can be helpful in marking a section that you need to return to in the future.
f
f
Easily locate segments in a sequence that are a different frame rate or format from 
your Project Settings. For example, if your project is 29.97 fps, enable the Mixed 
Rates checkbox so that clips at frame rates other than 29.97 will be highlighted;  
or if your Project is set as High Definition (HD), then enable the SD/HD checkbox  
and any Standard Definition (SD) material in your sequence will be highlighted.

Creating a Split Edit with Asymmetric Trimming 
Introduction
Typically, when we first cut together a sequence, all the transitions (cuts) between shots are 
straight. What this means is that both the image and sound from each segment (shot) cut 
to the next shot at the same time. However, much of the time we don't want straight cuts. 
Instead, very often you'll want the picture and audio from a shot to cut at different times. 
Sometimes, you'll want the picture to change to the next shot before its audio does, and  
vice versa. You'll frequently hear these types of cuts referred to as an L cut, a Prelap, a 
Postlap, a Split Edit or, more simply, a Split.
This book focuses on providing recipes – specific procedures that can be detailed in  
a step-by-step fashion. However, there is a large amount of important and/or helpful 
supporting information and additional editing methods/techniques that do not fall into 
the step-by step-format. Therefore, I've placed a good deal of useful information into the 
appendices. Appendix B, Details on Trimming, Slipping, Sliding, and Segment Mode includes

In my opinion, Trimming is the most powerful editing function in Media Composer. 
Unfortunately, many do not take advantage of everything that Trimming can do for them.  
So, I hope that the topics in Appendix B, Details on Trimming, Slipping, Sliding, and Segment 
Mode, those in this chapter, along with the discussion of using and/or re-mapping the default 
JKL functions (see the Keyboard mapping ideas section in the Mapping buttons and menu 
selections recipe in Chapter 2, Customizing Your Work Environment), and the discussion of 
staying in sync (see Chapter 5, Maintaining and Regaining Sync), will help you to get the most 
out of Trimming and get you working faster and more intuitively.
Creating a Split Edit with Double Roller or 
Overwrite Trim
Generally, when we first assemble a sequence, all the transitions between shots are straight. 
In other words, both the picture and audio cut at the same time from shot to shot. However,  
a good deal of the time we do not want straight cuts. Instead, very often we want the video 
to cut to the next shot before cutting to the audio that belongs with it. An example of this is in 
the top screenshot (see below) where the video cuts to RICK before we hear the audio from 
RICK's shot. And of course, the opposite is also true; sometimes we want the audio from a 
shot to be heard before we cut to the video that belongs with it. An example of this is in the 
bottom screenshot below:

There are several different methods you can use to create Split Edits which are discussed in 
this chapter. I encourage you to familiarize yourself with all three methods as you may prefer 
one over another, and you may find that one method works better in a particular situation.
Getting ready
In this example, we'll use Double Roller Trim or Overwrite Trim to create a Split Edit. In order 
to give this some context, the steps below relate to a dialog scene with two characters, MIKE 
and RICK. The first shot (the A-side shot) is a closeup of MIKE. He says, "Hey Rick! I hear 
you've started playing tennis. How is it going?". Then, in the second shot (the B-side shot), 
RICK replies, "I think I should have started when I was younger!"
How to do it...
1.	 The first step is to adjust the pacing between the two shots (see the next screenshot 
labeled as A). Essentially, you'll determine how quickly you want RICK to respond to 
MIKE's question. To do this, you'll have to adjust each shot separately, one at a time. 
Use Single Roller Trim on the A-side shot (the shot of MIKE) to adjust only the A-side 
after MIKE says the word "going." Then use Single Roller Trim on the B-side shot 
(the shot of RICK) to adjust how quickly you want him to respond to MIKE's question. 
Maybe you have a long pause because you want RICK to appear that he's thinking of 
an answer, or maybe you want him to respond quickly because it will be funnier.

2.	 Once you've established the pacing between the two shots (see the screenshot below 
labeled as B), you'll change the video from cutting at the same time as the audio. In 
other words, you'll be creating the Split Edit. In this example, I've decided to cut to 
RICK's reaction just before MIKE asks "How is it going?" To do this, use one of the 
following methods:


Double Roller Trim (screenshot C): Enter Double Roller Trim for the video only 
(one quick method is to lasso just the video transition). Trim the video to either 
the left or the right to create the Split Edit. In the example of the MIKE and 
RICK scene, since I want to see RICK's reaction at the same time that MIKE 
says, "How is it going?", I would trim to the left, so that the video cuts to RICK 
just before MIKE's line.


Overwrite Trim (screenshot D): You could accomplish the same result with 
Overwrite Trim, which is the red Trim icon in the Smart Tool. If you used this, 
then you'd want to have the red Trim Roller on the B-side (RICK's shot) as you 
extended it to the left.

There's more...
One advantage to using Double Roller Trim (the previous screenshot C) is that you can use 
JKL Trimming on the keyboard to adjust the position of the cut.

Creating a Split Edit with the Extend 
function
By default, you'll find the Extend function below the Record Monitor and in the Fast Menu 
Tool Palette. It can also be mapped from the Command Palette (Tools menu | Command 
Palette | Trim tab). The icon looks like the following:
In many instances Media Composer offers two or more methods for getting something done. 
This provides you with choices, depending on your preference or the needs of a particular 
situation. This is the case with Extend. The end result of using the Extend function is identical 
to using Double Roller Trim or Overwrite Trim. One of the benefits of using Extend is that if 
it's mapped to the keyboard, then all the operations required to use it can be done using the 
keyboard without even entering Trim Mode.
Getting Ready
You'll find it helpful to read the previous Creating a Split Edit with Double Roller or Overwrite 
Trim recipe, if you haven't already, because I'll be using the same scene between MIKE and 
RICK for this example too. This will help you to see that you can accomplish the same results 
with different methods.

How to do it…
1.	 The first step is to adjust the pacing between the two shots. Essentially, adjust how 
quickly you want RICK to respond to MIKE's question. You will Trim and/or Extract to 
adjust this.
2.	 Once you've established the pacing between the two shots, you'll change the video 
from cutting at the same time as the audio. In other words, you'll be creating the Split 
Edit. In this example, I'll do just as I did in the previous recipe's example and cut to 
RICK's reaction just before MIKE asks, "How is it going?" However, this time I'll use 
the Extend function.
3.	 Enable only the V1 Track Selector.
4.	 Place a Mark In just before MIKE says the word "How" (see the next screenshot). 
Placing the Mark In is the key to this feature. You might think of the Mark In as facing 
the transition you want to extend to that specific spot. When using a Mark In, the shot 
on the right-hand side of the transition will be extended to the left. On the other hand, 
if you wanted to extend a shot to the right, then you'd use a Mark Out. It's helpful to 
note that this function is programmed to only pay attention to one Mark placed in the 
Timeline Window. If you happen to have both a Mark In and a Mark Out placed, the 
programming tells it to pay attention only to the Mark In.
5.	 Click the Extend button. My silly (but hopefully helpful) analogy is that the moment 
you press the Extend button, the Mark In (or Mark Out, if that's what you've set) is 
transformed into a powerful magnet that pulls the transition to that spot, with the 
result being that one shot is made longer and the other is made shorter.

Creating a Split Edit with Asymmetric 
Trimming
This recipe will be covering only the essential steps for creating a Split Edit. If it's confusing 
in any way, Asymmetric Trimming is explained in much more detail in Chapter 5, Maintaining 
and Regaining Sync. Further, this recipe will be using the Shift + click method to configure 
the Trim Rollers, which is discussed in the Using and configuring the Trimming tools recipe in 
Appendix B, Details on Trimming, Slipping, Sliding, and Segment Mode.
Getting ready 
For this example, you're editing a documentary about auto racing. The first shot (the A-side 
shot) is of our interview subject, famous race car driver, Teddy Orlando. He says, "I've been 
racing for 10 years now and I never get tired of it. I absolutely love the feeling of speed."  
Then, the second shot (the B-side shot) is footage of Teddy's race car loudly speeding  
around the track.
You make the creative decision to have the video and audio of the race car occur at the same 
time that Teddy says, "I absolutely love the feeling of speed." 
How to do it...
1.	 Start by using Overwrite/Lift Segment Mode (red arrow) to place the audio from the 
race car footage onto a separate track as pictured in the next screenshot.
2.	 Enter Trim Mode so that you have Double Roller Trim at the transition between 
TEDDY ORLANDO and the RACE CAR footage, as shown in the following screenshot:

3.	 Now you'll use the Shift + click method to configure the Trim Rollers (this method 
is detailed in the Using and configuring the Trimming tools recipe in Appendix B, 
Details on Trimming, Slipping, Sliding, and Segment Mode). Follow the steps below. 
Remember, the goal is to have the video and audio from the B-side (RACE CAR shot) 
overlap the audio of TEDDY saying, "I absolutely love the feeling of speed."
4.	 Press and hold the Shift key, then click to remove the following rollers:


On V1, remove the B-side roller


On A1, remove the A-side roller


On A2, remove the B-side roller
5.	 You will now have an Asymmetric Trim configuration that looks like the  
following screenshot:
6.	 Trim in one of the following ways:


If you were to grab and drag the rollers in the Timeline window (see the next 
screenshot), in this example, you might choose to grab the A-side roller on 
the V1 track and then drag it to the left. This would shorten the video of 
TEDDY as well as the Filler on tracks A1 and A2. Note that before you click-
and-drag, make sure that the cursor icon's little piece of film extending out 
from it points to the same side as the Trim Roller you're going to grab (in this 
case, that would be to the left-hand side).


If you wanted to use another Trimming method like JKL, the Trim keys, or 
the numeric key pad, you must first indicate to Media Composer which roller 
is the leader. You do this simply by clicking on it. However, before you click, 
make sure that the cursor icon's little piece of film extending out from it 
points to the same side as the Trim Roller you are clicking on (see the next 
screenshot). Once you have clicked on it, you can then Trim. In this example, 
I'd most likely click on one of the A-side rollers on either track V1 or A2, and 
then trim to the left using the J key. This would shorten the video of TEDDY 
as well as the Filler on tracks A1 and A2.

Introduction
In this chapter, the goal is to give you a solid understanding of why the Avid Media Composer 
system works the way it does with regard to sync, how you can be in complete control of 
staying in sync when using any of the editing modes without Sync Locks enabled, what Sync 
Locks do and how they work, and what to do if you find yourself out of sync.

This introduction itself will cover two topics:
f
f
Understanding Filler
f
f
The core concepts of Sync
First, understanding what Filler is will help you to stay in sync. In this chapter, we'll go over 
all the different methods in which you can add Filler to your sequence, including at the end. 
However, let's begin by discussing what Filler is and why Avid Media Composer uses it.
Avid Media Composer is a blend of editing methods, concepts, and terminology, many of 
which come from film and videotape editing. Filler is a concept from film editing. However, 
in film editing, it isn't called Filler, it's called Slug or Leader. Essentially, Filler is a spacer 
that keeps all the tracks of picture and sound exactly the same length (or duration) and, 
consequently, keeps them in sync. Just like Slug in film editing, Filler occupies space in your 
sequence just like any other segment (shot) does. A good analogy is that Filler is a segment 
of black video or a segment of silent audio. Understanding that Filler is a segment just like all 
the other segments of picture and sound in your sequence will help a great deal  
in understanding the behavior of the editing tools in Media Composer.
So you can see what film editing looks like, below is an image of what is called a flatbed,  
film-editing machine made by a company called Steenbeck. Each of the silver platters holds  
a roll of film (the picture rolls go on the top two platters and the sound rolls go on the lower 
two platters). The source rolls would be on the left-hand side and the take-up rolls on the  
right-hand side.

rolls loaded. Note that each roll is just like a track in Avid Media Composer.

Before getting into the specific methods of staying in sync when using the various editing 
tools in Media Composer, which are discussed in the sections that follow, I feel it's important 
to provide you with some fundamental information that will help you understand the 
programming of the software and ultimately to stay in sync. I'll be referring to these concepts a 
good deal in this chapter. I think of these as the core concepts of sync, which are as follows:
1.	 Yellow-colored tools (Splice, Extract, Ripple Trim) always change the duration  
of a track by either adding or removing material. Also, depending on how it's  
used, the yellow Extract/Splice-In Segment Mode tool may also affect the  
duration of a track. Additionally, even though it's not yellow, there is a function  
called Top and Tail that performs an extraction as part of its programming, so  
it also affects the duration of a track. The important thing to note is that any  
function or tool that can change the duration of a track has the capability of  
placing your tracks out of sync. The behavior of adding and removing material  
from a track is discussed in more detail in Point #5, below.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Maintaining and Regaining Sync
124
2.	 Red-colored tools (Overwrite, Lift, Overwrite Trim, and the Lift/Overwrite Segment 
Mode tool) do not change a track's overall duration (the only exception to this is if  
you Overwrite material at the very end of a sequence). Here are some details:


Overwrite edits and when extending segments with Overwrite Trim do not 
add to a track's duration because they place the new material on top of the 
previous material. No additional duration is added to the track.


Lift: The duration of the track is unchanged by removing material and 
simultaneously replacing it with an equal amount of Filler.


Overwrite Trim: I feel it should be renamed to Overwrite/Lift Trim because 
when you use it to remove material, it also leaves behind an equal amount  
of Filler, so the overall duration of the track remains unchanged.


Double-Roller Trim (also known as Dual-Roller Trim): While it is not red, this 
function will not push material downstream out of sync. Double-Roller Trim 
does not add to a track's duration, because as you extend one segment, 
it places the new material on top of the other segment. In actuality, no 
additional duration is added to the track, because as one segment gets 
longer, the other gets shorter by an equal amount.


Extend: Although this function is not colored red, it can not push material 
downstream out of sync. The Extend function does not add to a track's 
duration, because as you extend one segment, it places the new material 
on top of the other segment. No additional duration is added to the track, 
because as one segment gets longer, the other gets shorter by an equal 
amount. Essentially, the Extend function is performing a Double-Roller  
Trim without actually being in Trim Mode.
3.	 This is a particularly important concept: As long as you perform the same  
duration- changing editing operation on all the tracks (which means that you're 
affecting all the tracks by an equal duration), you will stay in sync. In other words:


If you add material to one or more tracks using Splice (yellow) or Ripple Trim 
(yellow), then you must add an equal amount/duration of material to all the 
other tracks to maintain sync


If you remove material from one or more tracks using Extract (yellow) or 
Ripple Trim (yellow), then you must remove an equal amount/duration  
of material from all the other tracks to maintain sync

4.	 Filler occupies space in the sequence just like any other segment (shot) does. You 
can think of Filler as a segment of black video or a segment of silent audio. Filler 
was discussed in more detail earlier in the Introduction section of this chapter,  
which covers understanding and adding Filler.
5.	 It is said that editing is the final rewrite of a film. That analogy applies not only to 
telling the story but also to the way the sequence behaves during editing as well. 
This is because tracks react to adding and removing material in the same way that a 
sentence does when you add or remove letters and words:


Example 1, Splicing: I type the sentence "I went beach this afternoon". I then 
notice that between the words "went" and "beach" I forgot to type the words 
"to the". When I insert the words "to the" into the sentence, the words "this 
afternoon" are pushed down to the right and the sentence becomes longer. 
This is exactly the same as when I Splice (yellow) material into a track or 
Ripple Trim (yellow) a segment making it longer.


Example 2, Extracting: I type the sentence "I drove down the steep and 
winding road". I then decide that I no longer want to include the words "steep 
and". So I highlight those words and press Delete. The result is that the 
words "winding road" move to the left and the sentence becomes shorter. 
This is exactly the same as when I Extract (yellow) material from a track or 
Ripple Trim (yellow) a segment making it shorter.


Example 3, Overwriting: My intention is to type the name of one of the 
southern states in the U.S. Due to my poor typing skills, I misspell this state 
as Mississibbi. I then notice my error; the two b's should instead be p's. I 
then highlight just the two b's and type "pp". The b's are replaced with an 
equal amount of letters, so the word does not get any longer. This is exactly 
what happens when you Overwrite (red).


Example 4, Lifting: Lifting does not really have an exact analogy that 
corresponds with typing. Since both performing a Lift (red) and removing 
material with Overwrite Trim (red) replaces the material it removes with 
an equal amount of Filler, the closest example I can come up with is that I 
mistype the sentence "I caught thebball". I then notice that I forgot a space 
between the word "the" and the word "ball", and that I mistakenly typed the 
letter "b" twice. If I delete the first letter "b" and then also add in the space 
between "the" and "ball", I have removed something and the sentence 
remains the same length. Essentially, what takes me two steps in this 
example, Lift does in just one.

Adding Filler within a sequence with Splice 
or Overwrite
In this recipe, we will see how the programming of Avid Media Composer allows you to edit 
Filler at the beginning of a Sequence, or anywhere between segments of video or audio. 
However, it does not allow you to Splice or Overwrite Filler at the end of a Sequence  
(don't worry, Avid gave us a way around that, and it's discussed in the recipe that  
follows this one).
How to do it...
1.	 Go to the Clip Name Menu above the Source Window.
2.	 From the Clip Name Menu select Load Filler.
3.	 By default, Media Composer gives you 2 minutes of Filler. Mark In and Mark  
Out for the duration you would like to edit into your sequence.
4.	 Enable the Source and Timeline Track Selectors as needed.
5.	 Splice or Overwrite the selected duration of Filler into your sequence.
There's more...
Very frequently the engineers at Avid provide us with multiple methods to accomplish a task, 
and this is the case with adding Filler at the beginning of a sequence.
Additional method for adding Filler at the beginning of a 
sequence
While you can add Filler at the beginning of a sequence with Splice or Overwrite, Media 
Composer also has a command called Add Filler at Start. By default, the current duration 
it adds is 30 seconds (in earlier releases it was 1 second). However, this duration can be 
customized to whatever you'd like. For those of you working in broadcast television in the  
U.S., you may find it useful to customize the duration to 00;01;29;28 so you can quickly add 
Filler at the beginning of a sequence in order to accommodate the Color Bars, Tone, Slate, 
and Countdown necessary prior to making an output. The path to customize the Add Filler  
at Start duration is Project Window | Settings tab | Timeline settings | Edit tab | Start 
Filler Duration Entry Box.
Here are two methods to access the Add Filler at Start command:

Method 1: Clip menu | Add Filler at Start

The Adding Filler at the end of a sequence recipe
Adding Filler at the end of a sequence
Media Composer does not allow you to Splice or Overwrite Filler at the end of a sequence, 
but all is not lost. We'll look at two methods you can use. The recipe will look at using 
Trimming to add Filler at the end of a sequence, and the There's more... section will provide a 
second method that uses the Title Tool.
How to do it...
1.	 Add a new video or audio track (whichever you prefer) if you do not already have one 
that is empty at the very end of your sequence.
2.	 Enable only the Track Selector for the track that is empty at the end of the sequence.
3.	 If you have Sync Locks enabled, then disable all of them (or at least disable it for the 
track that is empty at the end).
4.	 Go to the end of the sequence.
5.	 Make sure that the Position Indicator is parked at the end of the sequence and not 
all the way to the right-hand side and actually parked off the sequence. You may need 
to move the Position Indicator back one or two frames from the very end.
6.	 Use the Add Edit function to put a cut in the Filler of the enabled track.
7.	
Enter Trim Mode.
8.	 Enable Ripple Trim (yellow trim) on the A-Side (left-hand side) of the cut you placed 
in the Filler.
9.	 Trim the Filler, to make it longer by extending it to the right.
There's more
Here's another approach to adding Filler at the end of a sequence that uses the Title Tool.
1.	 Open the Title Tool by going to Tools menu | Title Tool.
2.	 If presented with a dialog window, select Title Tool (not Marquee). If needed, you can 
regain the dialog window by going to Project Window | Settings tab | Marquee Title 
| Create New Title Using | Ask Me.

3.	 In the lower left-hand side of the Title Tool, you'll see a button with a bright green 
letter V on it. This tells Media Composer to make titles with a transparent background 
so that the video will show through. Click that button to disable this. Now you'll see 
that the background is a solid color rather than the video, and that the default color 
is black (if needed, this can be changed by clicking on the black color swatch labeled 
as Bg found next to the V button).
4.	 Go to the File menu and select Save.
5.	 A dialog window will open where you will name the title, select the bin that the Title 
Clip will be placed into, select the drive where the media it creates will be stored, and 
select the resolution of the media that it will create.
6.	 Click Save.
7.	
Close the Title Tool if it's no longer needed.
8.	 Edit a portion of the title at the end of your sequence.
9.	 Later, if you need additional Filler at the end, you can either:


Trim the black title to make it longer


Splice in some Filler prior to the black title
Sync Break Indicators: Understanding them 
and making your own
If you are editing without your Sync Locks enabled, it is possible to knock one or more tracks 
out of sync with the others. Sync Locks are discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
When the tracks no longer align or sync properly, if the video and audio come from the same 
clip (or have been AutoSynced), then Media Composer will display what Avid calls Sync Break 
Indicators. These are the small white or black numbers (depending on the color of your 
tracks) that appear in the segments (shots) when they are out of alignment. Media Composer 
is able to determine sync breaks because it's programmed to compare a segment's clip 
source data and timecode across tracks. If the segments on the different tracks come from 
the same clip and the timecode numbers align, then they are in sync. If they don't align, then 
that means the timecode numbers do not match and Media Composer can easily calculate 
the amount of frames for which they are out of sync.
For example, let's imagine that I'm working without the Sync Locks enabled and I'm editing a 
dialog scene of a movie in which I have only one video track and one audio track. If I Trim the 
first shot in my video track 30 frames longer without also trimming the audio track 30 frames 
longer, then this will extend the video segment and push the video segments that follow it 
down to the right, making them out of sync (out of alignment) with their audio segment mates. 
The result will be that the actors speaking in my movie will appear as if they are starring in a

In this example, the Sync Break Indicators in the video track would read as -30 while those 
in the audio track would read as 30. The Sync Break Indicators are actually telling you how 
to fix the sync break. Negative values in Media Composer indicate movement to the left and 
positive numbers indicate movement to the right. So what Media Composer is telling you in 
this example is:
f
f
In order to get the out of sync segments on the video track back in sync with those  
on the audio track, you need to move them 30 frames to the left
f
f
In order to get the out of sync segments on the audio track back in sync with those  
on the video track, you need to move them 30 frames to the right
To regain sync in this example, whichever track you choose to edit is up to you, but it has to be 
edited independently of the other without Sync Locks enabled. For example, if I were to edit 
the video track to regain sync, I could use any of these methods:
f
f
Use Ripple Trim (yellow) to trim the video segment that exists just before where the 
sync break occurs 30 frames shorter; this is my preferred method
f
f
Extract (yellow) 30 frames from any video segment that exists before the sync break 
occurs
f
f
Place all the video segments that are out of sync into Lift/Overwrite Segment Mode 
(red) and move them 30 frames to the left
The topic of regaining sync is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
Getting ready
In this recipe of steps, we'll discuss making your own Sync Break Indicators. This can be 
helpful because there will be many times when you'll place video and audio from different 
clips into alignment with each other. For example, you might have some music with a loud 
cymbal crash and you have placed video of two boxers in sync with it, so that the knockout 
punch happens at the same time as the cymbal crash. This would be a sync relationship that  
you created from different source clips, and Media Composer will not show Sync Break 
Indicators if they get moved out of sync. However, you can create your own visual sync 
reference using Markers.
Before we start the steps of this recipe, here's an overview of what you'll be doing. You'll 
be adding a Marker at the same location on all the video and audio tracks. That way if the 
segments get knocked out of sync, you'll be alerted, because visually the Markers will no 
longer line up and you'll also have an indication of how much out of sync you are.
Another helpful piece of information before we get into the recipe is that Markers are 
programmed to be placed only onto the uppermost track that is enabled, even if the  
lower tracks are enabled. With that in mind, here's a relatively easy way to add Markers  
as a sync reference.

How to do it...
1.	 Park the Position Indicator in a spot where it crosses all the video and/or audio 
segments onto which you'd like to place Markers.
2.	 Enable all the Track Selectors for the video and/or audio tracks onto which you'd like 
Markers to be placed.
3.	 The Add Marker button can be found by default in the Fast Menu Tool Palette 
between the Splice and Overwrite buttons underneath the Source and Record 
monitors. The icon for Add Marker is a bright, red oval.
4.	 Add a Marker to the uppermost enabled track.
5.	 Disable the track that just received a Marker.
6.	 Do not move the Position Indicator line.
7.	
Repeat steps 4, 5, and 6 until Markers have been added at the same location  
on all the tracks you want them to be on.
Splicing and Extracting: Methods for staying 
in sync without Sync Locks
When you are editing in Source/Record mode you have four main editing functions available. 
Two functions place material into the sequence (Splice and Overwrite) and two functions 
remove material from the sequence (Extract and Lift). As discussed in the Introduction 
section of this chapter, the functions that affect the duration of a track are colored yellow, 
specifically Splice and Extract.
As long as you affect all the tracks in your sequence when using Splice or Extract, you will 
stay in sync. However, there is a particular situation that can sometimes confuse people so  
we are going to focus on that.
Below is a screenshot of an example editing situation:

reaction shot.
f
f
You want to accomplish this in as few steps as possible.

If you haven't already read the Introduction section of this chapter, which includes an overview 
of what I call the core concepts of sync, then you may find it helpful.
How to do it...
Follow these steps:
1.	 In the Source Window, Mark In and Mark Out around the material that you want  
to add into the sequence.
2.	 In the sequence, place a Mark In between the segments (shots) where you want  
to insert the reaction shot video.

3.	 For the Source Track Selectors, enable only the Video Track Selector  
(see the screenshot below).
4.	 For the Sequence Track Selectors, enable all the Track Selectors  
(see the screenshot below).
5.	 Splice the material into the sequence. In the screenshot below, we see the  
result of Splicing in the video from shot 11B/2:

This maintains sync because:

f
By enabling all the Sequence Track Selectors, you have instructed Media Composer 
to record on all of those tracks.
f
f
The video track in the sequence is recording a duration of video because the Video 
Track Selector for the Source is enabled. In other words, the Source video track is 
sending its video and the Sequence video track is recording that video.
f
f
The audio tracks in the sequence are recording a duration of Filler because the 
Audio track selectors for the Source are not enabled. In other words, the Source 
audio tracks are not sending their audio but the Sequence audio tracks are recording 
something. Specifically, they're recording Filler.

As discussed in the Introduction section in this chapter, which is about understanding 
and adding Filler, Filler is a segment that occupies space, just like all the other 
segments of picture or sound in your sequence.
f
f
As discussed in the Introduction section of this chapter explaining the core concepts 
of Sync, since all the tracks in the sequence are receiving (recording) the same 
duration of material, everything remains in sync.
Segment Mode: Methods for staying in sync
On the left-hand side of the Timeline Window, and included as part of the Smart Tool, you'll 
find the red arrow that points to the right as well as the yellow arrow that points to the right. 
Together these two features are called Segment Mode. This is because they are a separate 
mode of operation. The red arrow is the Lift/Overwrite Segment tool. As its name tells us, 
it contains both of those editing abilities. The good news is that this tool can never alter the 
material that is downstream of the edit points causing them to go out of sync. This is because:
f
f
At the original location from which the segment(s) is removed, it performs a Lift that 
leaves an equal duration of Filler behind
f
f
At the new location where the segment(s) is placed, it performs an Overwrite that 
replaces (covers up) the material that was previously there
Then we have the yellow Extract/Splice-In Segment tool. As its name suggests, it contains 
both abilities:
f
f
At the original location from which the segment(s) is removed, it performs  
an Extraction
f
f
At the new location where the segment(s) is placed, it performs a Splice
As discussed in the Introduction section of this chapter regarding the core concepts of Sync:
f
f
Yellow functions have the ability to add or remove material on a track and change  
its duration

f
As long as you affect all the tracks in your sequence equally when using Splice or 
Extract, you will stay in sync

So, you can imagine that in some situations this makes it hard to stay in sync using the yellow 
Extract/Splice-In Segment tool when moving one or more segments without also moving an 
equal duration of the segment(s) on the other tracks, as shown in the following screenshot:
In the example screenshot above, this happened because the segment labeled as MIKE (with 
a duration of 90 frames) was Extracted from its original location and Spliced into its new 
location within the segment labeled as STAN. The Splice operation pushed the material that 
follows it down to the right, causing it to become out of sync with its audio.
The result would have been even more damaging had the MIKE video segment been moved 
from its original location on track V1 (upper image of the screenshot below) and placed onto 
track V2 (lower image of the screenshot below). In that instance:
f
f
The MIKE segment would be Extracted from V1, causing all of the segments 
downstream of it on that track to shift to the left

Getting ready
If you haven't already read the Introduction section of this chapter, which includes an overview 
of the core concepts of Sync, you may find it helpful.
How to do it...
The sync issues described above can be avoided in the following way when using the yellow 
Extract/Splice-In Segment tool:
1.	 Enable Sync Locks for all the tracks (circled in the following screenshot). Sync Locks 
are discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
2.	 Enable the setting that will make the yellow Extract/Splice-In Segment tool respond 
to the Sync Locks. The path to enable this setting is Project Window | Settings tab | 
Timeline settings | Edit tab, and enable the setting that says Segment Drag  
Sync Locks.
After implementing the steps we just covered, and then repeating the two previous editing 
examples, we get the following results:

The top screenshot below shows the result of moving the MIKE segment to the left on the 
V1 track and into the middle of the STAN segment. The bottom screenshot below shows the 
result of moving the MIKE segment onto track V2 as well as into the middle  
of the STAN segment:
How it works...
Because Sync Locks are enabled and because you have enabled the setting that makes the 
yellow Extract/Splice-In Segment tool respond to the Sync Locks, sync has been maintained 
by adding an equal duration of Filler to all the tracks.

Using the option/Alt + Add Edit method to 
stay in sync in Trim Mode
When you use the Add Edit function it places a cut in a track wherever the Position Indicator 
is parked and, by default, it's programmed to place the cut onto any track that has its Track 
Selector enabled. However, if you hold the option/Alt key when you use Add Edit, it will do  
the following:
f
f
In Source/Record Mode, it places the cut(s) only in Filler. In other words, it will not 
cut segments of video or audio. Additionally, it will place cuts on a Filler track even  
if its track selector is not enabled.
f
f
In Trim Mode, it will do everything it does when used in Source/Record Mode but, 
the great part is that in Trim Mode, all the cuts you make will also automatically 
become enabled for Trimming. Because the option/Alt + Add Edit function only 
relates to Filler, there may be instances where you'll have to then manually configure 
the Trim Rollers on the tracks containing video or audio segments. So be sure to 
read these related sections:

video tracks and audio tracks in the sequence. The shot we want to Trim is of MIKE, as shown 
in the following screenshot:

Furthermore for this example, we are working in an area near the beginning of the sequence 
and are zoomed in, so we can't see very far down to the right to know what's happening on the 
other tracks (see the screenshot below).
We decide that we want to only extend the video of the MIKE shot on track V1. While a straight 
cut would be much easier to deal with, to further complicate the situation, the transition we want 
to Trim (between the MIKE and CAROLYN segments) is a Split Edit:
How to do it...
To address the situation described previously, here are the steps:
1.	 Enter Trim Mode at the transition on the V1 and A1 tracks only. The method I use 
most frequently is to lasso. Lassoing is discussed in the Using and Configuring the 
Trimming Tools section in Appendix B, Details on Trimming, Slipping, Sliding, and 
Segment Mode.
2.	 Select the A-Side for Trimming.
3.	 Perform the option/Alt + Add Edit. The results of steps 1, 2, and 3 are pictured in the  
following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 5
139
4.	 Because there is an audio segment on track A2 and because option/Alt + Add Edit 
only places cuts in Filler, no cut has been made in the audio segment of MIKE and 
no Trim Roller has been enabled on that track. In this particular instance, I make 
the decision that I want to also extend the audio on track A2. So I manually add and 
configure the Trim Roller onto the A-Side of Mike's audio segment, using the Shift-
Click method discussed in the Using and configuring the Trimming tools section in 
Appendix B. The result is pictured in the following screenshot:
5.	 Extend the video on track V1 by trimming it to the right.

140
How it works...
Sync is maintained because as you trim the video on V1 to make it longer, all the other tracks 
are also extended. This is because the Filler is being extended too. Because all the tracks are 
receiving an equal duration of material, they all stay in sync. For emphasis, sync is maintained 
because an equal amount of material is added to all the tracks.

The Using the option/Alt + Add Edit method to stay in sync recipe of this chapter
Asymmetric Trimming is the "King of Trim". While Asymmetric Trimming is an indispensable 
feature, it can sometimes be a challenging concept. However, it is well worth your time and 
effort to understand it and to master it.
First, what does Asymmetric Trimming mean? Simply, it means trimming in opposite 
directions at the same time. While this might sound strange, what Asymmetric Trimming is 
doing is shortening or lengthening the tracks by the same duration. However, instead of the 
Trim Rollers all moving in the same direction, they move in opposite directions.
A-Side/B-Side Asymmetric Trimming will be the method you'll find yourself using the majority 
of the time, and once mastered, will greatly speed up your work because:
f
f
You'll be able to easily contend with a Timeline that has numerous tracks
f
f
You'll be able to accomplish various, sometimes complicated, edits in less steps
f
f
You'll be able to always maintain sync while trimming
We'll examine two situations as examples for when and how you might use A-Side/B-Side 
Asymmetric Trimming. The first will be presented next and the other will be in the There's 
more... section of this recipe.

Getting ready
In this example, we'll take a look at using Asymmetric Trimming to make a change to a 
sequence with three video tracks and six audio tracks. Here is a screenshot of the example 
before we do any editing:
Our goals in this situation are:
f
f
To extend (lengthen) the STAN video segment on V1, because we want a longer 
pause before the actor (JOE) in the next shot speaks
f
f
To not extend the dialog on A1, because another actor who is off-camera speaks and 
we don't want to hear them
f
f
To not alter the segment of JOE in any way
f
f
To not extend the stereo sound effect on A3 and A4
f

To stay in sync on all the tracks
How to do it...
1.	 Enable all the Track Selectors.
2.	 Park the Position Indicator near the transition of the STAN and JOE shots.
3.	 Enter Trim Mode on all the tracks (by default, you'll be placed into the Double-Roller 
Trim configuration).

4.	 Use the Shift+Click method (discussed in the Using and configuring the trimming 
tools recipe in Appendix B, Details on Trimming, Slipping, Sliding, and Segment 
Mode) to select or de-select Trim Rollers as needed (detailed in a moment). Just take 
it slow, track by track. For each track, ask yourself which segment (shot) you want to 
affect. Then configure the Trim Roller on that track so that it's touching the shot that 
you want to trim. At first, this conversation you have with yourself will take some time, 
but the more often you do it, you'll find that your internal dialog will move along very 
quickly. Let's go through it together: 


V3, V2, and V1: De-select the Trim Rollers on the B-Side (the right-hand 
side) of the transition. In other words, you should have Trim Rollers only  
on the A-Side.


A1: De-select the Trim Roller on the A-Side (left-hand side) of the transition.


A2: De-select the Trim Roller on the B-Side of the transition.


A3 and A4: De-select the Trim Rollers on the A-Side of the transition.


A5 and A6: De-select the Trim Rollers on the B-Side of the transition.

5.	 Hover the cursor over one of the A-Side Trim Rollers on any of the tracks. Make sure 
that the icon for the cursor also indicates the A-Side by having the piece of film that 
extends out from it pointing to the left (see the previous screenshot).
6.	 With the cursor being displayed as described in step 5, click-and-drag it to the right. 
The material on tracks V1, V2, V3, A2, A5, and A6 will be extended to the right while 
the material on tracks A1, A3, and A4 will be extended to the left.
Also see the There's more... section below for a tip on using Asymmetric Trimming along with 
trim methods other than dragging.
Here's a screenshot of the completed trim:
How it works...
The Trim Rollers are moving in opposite directions, but they are performing the same 
operation on all the tracks, in this case that's adding the same duration of material. 
Specifically, the trimming on track V1 is extending (adding) to the video while the trimming 
on the other tracks is extending Filler. For emphasis, sync is maintained because an equal 
amount of material is added to all the tracks.

In this second example, we'll take a look at using Asymmetric Trimming to create a  
Split Edit. Asymmetric Trimming can be used to create a Split Edit in a dramatic scene,  
to get two characters' dialog to overlap (for example, during an argument). However, my 
example will be a fictitious documentary about film editors Chris Innis and Bob Murawski,  
who received Academy Awards for Best Editing of The Hurt Locker, directed by Kathryn 
Bigelow. Here is a screenshot of the editing example before we do any editing:

Mode) to select or de-select Trim Rollers as needed (detailed in a moment). Just take 
it slow, track by track. For each track ask yourself which segment (shot) you want to 
affect. Then configure the Trim Roller on that track so that it's touching the shot that 
you want to trim. Let's go through it together: 


V1: De-select the Trim Roller on the B-Side of the transition (the right-hand 
side). In other words, you should place the Trim Roller only on the A-Side.


A1: De-select the Trim Roller on the A-Side (left-hand side) of the transition.


A2: De-select the Trim Roller on the B-Side of the transition. Below 
is a screenshot of what the sequence looks like after completing the 
configuration just covered.
3.	 Hover the cursor over the Trim Roller on the A-Side of the video track. Make sure 
that the icon for the cursor also indicates the A-Side by having the piece of film that 
extends out from it pointing to the left-hand side (see the previous screenshot).
4.	 With the cursor being displayed as described in step 3, click-and-drag it to the left. 
The material on tracks V1 and A2 will be shortened to the left-hand side while the 
material on track A1 will be shortened to the right-hand side.

Here's a screenshot of the completed trim:
The Trim Rollers are moving in opposite directions, but they are performing the same 
operation on all the tracks, removing the same duration of material. Specifically, the trimming 
on tracks V1 and A2 is removing (shortening) the video and Filler, while the trimming on A1 
is removing Filler. For emphasis, sync is maintained because an equal amount of material is 
removed from all the tracks.
Asymmetric Trimming type 2: Two Heads/
Two Tails
Editor and fellow ACI Paul Petschek assisted me with this example, as well as reminded 
me that this is an editing capability that was inspired by another editing application called 
Lightworks. This relatively new addition to the trimming programming in Avid Media Composer 
is useful in some specific situations. You may not use it every week but when you need it, 
you'll have it in your bag of tricks. Its most frequent use would come when editing a montage 
of video that sits on top of a bed of music and/or voiceover, as is often found in music videos, 
television commercials, and film trailers.

How to do it...
1.	 Enter Trim Mode at the head of the FLOWER shot. This will place you into  
Double-Roller Trim, as pictured in the following screenshot:
2.	 Use the Shift+Click method (discussed in the Using and configuring the trimming 
tools recipe in Appendix B, Details on Trimming, Slipping, Sliding, and Segment 
Mode) to de-select the B-Side (right-hand side) Trim Roller and then to also add a 
Trim Roller to the tail of FLOWER. You've now configured a Two Tails Asymmetric 
Trim, as pictured in the following screenshot:

3.	 Hover your cursor over the Trim Roller on the A-Side which is on the tail of the shot 
labeled as BLOSSOM. Make sure that the icon for the cursor also indicates the A-Side, 
by having the piece of film that extends out from it pointing to the left-hand side.
4.	 With the cursor being displayed as described in step 3, click-and-drag it to the left. 
Go slowly and you'll see that as the BLOSSOM shot gets shorter (which moves the 
FLOWER shot earlier/left), the tail of the FLOWER shot gets longer by an equal 
amount, at the same time. See the There's more section for a tip on how to  
perform Asymmetric Trimming while using a trim method other than dragging.
5.	 The result, displayed in the screenshot below, is that the FLOWER segment was 
moved earlier in the sequence so that its transition syncs with the start of the  
loud music, the FLOWER segment was lengthened from its tail, and the LILY  
shot was not altered:
How it works...
The Trim Rollers are moving in opposite directions on the same track. Sync is maintained 
because as material is removed from one segment (BLOSSOM), an equal amount is added 
to another (FLOWER). For emphasis, sync is maintained because the duration of the track 
remains the same, so it doesn't affect the position of any segments that are downstream  
(to the right-hand side) of the edit.

Alternate method
Here is an alternate method that does not use Two Heads/Two Tails Asymmetric Trimming to 
achieve the same result as in the previous recipe:
1.	 Park the Position Indicator on the first frame of the loud music (as pictured 
previously).
2.	 Enable the red Lift/Overwrite Segment Mode tool.
3.	 Select the FLOWER segment.
4.	 Hold down the cmd/Ctrl key.
5.	 Drag the FLOWER segment to the left. Because you're holding the cmd/Ctrl key, the 
head of the segment will snap to the Position Indicator. Release the mouse to place 
the FLOWER segment.
6.	 Enter Trim Mode at the transition that now exists at the tail of the FLOWER segment 
and the head of the Filler. This will place you into Double-Roller Trim, as pictured in 
the following screenshot:
7.	
Drag the Trim Rollers to the right, which will lengthen the FLOWER shot and shorten/
remove the Filler. Note that Media Composer has a nice feature that automatically 
stops the trim when it encounters a transition.

This is a very useful feature that can be used after exiting from any trim configuration. 
However, this trick is especially helpful when you've just performed a multitrack, Asymmetric 
Trim and want to re-enter Trim Mode to make additional adjustments. The steps to do this are 
as follows:
1.	 Hold down the option/Alt key.
2.	 Do one of the following:


Press the Trim Mode button on the keyboard (by default on the letter U)


Click on the Trim Mode button in the interface (for example, on the 
Composer Window below the Splice and Overwrite buttons)
Asymmetric Trimming with methods other than dragging
When Asymmetric Trimming, if you wanted to use another trimming method (that is JKL, the 
trim keys, or the numeric keypad), you must first indicate to Media Composer which roller is 
the "leader", so that you can know in which direction to instruct Media Composer to trim. You 
do this simply by clicking on a Trim Roller once. However, before you click, make sure that the 
cursor icon's little piece of film extending out from it points to the same side as the Trim Roller 
you are clicking on. For example, to designate a Trim Roller that is on the A-Side (left-hand 
side) as the leader, the cursor icon's piece of film needs to extend/point to the left-hand side 
before you click. Once you have clicked on it once, you can then trim it using any trim method.

Opening up the sequence using Splice with 
Sync Locks enabled
In the previous sections of this chapter, we've learned a lot about staying in sync without using 
Sync Locks, so that you can choose to use them or not. Personally, I like using Sync Locks as 
I find that not only do they protect me from making silly mistakes when I'm in a hurry or tired, 
but also in many cases allow me to perform various edits in less steps, essentially by reducing 
the number of tracks that I have to enable to make a Splice, an Extract, or a Ripple Trim.
This recipe, and several that follow it, discuss performing various editing operations while 
Sync Locks are enabled. However, before we get into the recipes themselves, let's get familiar 
with Sync Locks and their behavior:
f
f
Sync Locks are the black, diagonal lines (I call them hash marks) that appear when 
you click in the narrow Sync Lock Column that is immediately to the right-hand side 
of the Timeline Track Selectors, as pictured below. Note that in earlier releases 
of Media Composer, the Sync Lock Column was placed between the Source and 
Record Track Selectors.
f
f
Sync Locks work when they are enabled for two or more tracks. In other words, 
enabling the Sync Lock on just one track does nothing.
f
f
Sync Locks can be enabled for any combination of tracks that you need. However, in 
general, you'll find that you'll have them enabled for all the tracks.
f
f
You can enable or disable the Sync Locks for all the tracks by clicking in the Sync 
Lock Column next to the Timecode Track Selector (see the previous screenshot). Avid 
calls this the Sync Lock All Button. You may have to double-click it to get this to work.

f
f
Sync Locks will respond when you Splice, Extract, and Ripple Trim.
f
f
Sync Locks will respond to the yellow Extract/Splice-In Segment Mode tool only  
if the Segment Drag Sync Locks setting is enabled. The path to enable this setting  
is Project Window | Settings tab | Timeline settings | Edit tab and enable the 
setting that says Segment Drag Sync Locks. This setting and its behavior were 
discussed in more detail earlier inthis chapter, in the Segment Mode: Methods  
for staying in sync recipe.
f
f
Sync Locks maintain sync by ensuring that the same duration-changing operation  
is performed on all the tracks.
f
f
When performing a Trim, Sync Locks are programmed only to be able to adjust Filler. 
In other words, when trimming, Sync Locks will not affect segments of video or audio.
Getting ready
Now that you've read the previous introduction and you're a bit more familiar with Sync Locks, 
let's examine what they do and how we can open up the sequence when using  
Splice with Sync Locks enabled.
In this situation let's imagine the following:
f
f
You're editing a scene of a comedy television program
f
f
Loaded in the Source Window is a clip that contains one video track and two  
audio tracks
f
f
Loaded in the Timeline Window is a sequence that contains one video  
track and four audio tracks (see the screenshot below)

The goals in this example are the following:
f
f
You want to add only the video from the source Clip into the sequence, between the 
shots 11F/3 and 11Z/8 (see the previous screenshot). The video you want to add is 
a close-up shot of one actor's shocked reaction to another actor's line of dialog. You 
don't want the source Audio because you can hear the director talking.
f
f
You want to push the other segments (shots) in the sequence down, so that you can 
later add in the sound of the audience laughing underneath the video of the shocked 
reaction shot that you will be splicing in.
How to do it…
1.	 Enable Sync Locks for all the tracks by clicking the Sync Lock All Button (found in 
the Sync Lock Column next to the Timecode Track Selector button) if they are not  
all already enabled.
2.	 On the Source Track Selectors enable only the video.
3.	 On the Record Track Selectors enable only the video. Note that if the other tracks 
were enabled, it's okay as the final result would be the same. I'm just doing this to 
better demonstrate what Sync Locks will do.
4.	 In the Source Window, Mark In and Mark Out around the video that you want  
to edit into the sequence.
5.	 In the sequence, place a Mark In at the location where you want to Splice in  
the video.
6.	 Press the Splice button to make the edit. The result is pictured in the following

How it works...
Without Sync Locks enabled this edit would place you out of sync, because you would be 
adding a duration of video without adding an equal amount of material to the other tracks. 
However, with Sync Locks enabled, Media Composer ensures that you are adding an equal 
duration of material to the other Sync-Locked tracks. It accomplishes this by adding an equal 
duration of Filler. The Introduction section of this chapter includes an overview of the core 
concepts of Sync, if you'd like some additional discussion on this topic.
Extracting with Sync Locks enabled
If you haven't already read the introduction to the previous Opening up the sequence using 
Splice with Sync Locks enabled recipe, then you may find it helpful as it includes an overview 
of Sync Locks as well.
This recipe presents a situation where Sync Locks will save us some steps because we won't 
have to reconfigure the Track Selectors from whatever configuration they happen to be set at  
a particular moment.
Getting ready
The situation in this example is the following:
f
f
Loaded in the Timeline Window is a sequence that contains one video track and four 
audio tracks.
f
f
The last edit was Lifting out some music on track A4, so that happens to be the only 
track that's enabled at the moment. Refer to the following screenshot:

How to do it…
The goal in this example is to Extract a pause in the dialog of shot 11F/3 (see the previous 
screenshot). Note that this will, of course, create a jump cut in the video and that issue will  
be corrected by covering it with a reaction shot at a later time.
1.	 Enable Sync Locks for all the tracks by clicking the Sync Lock All Button  
(found in the Sync Lock Column next to the Timecode Track Selector) if they  
are not all already enabled.
2.	 Mark In and Mark Out in the sequence around the audio that you want to  
extract. In this example, it would be the pause in the dialog in shot 11F/3  
(see the previous screenshot).
3.	 Press Extract to make the edit. The result is pictured in the following screenshot:
How it works...
Without Sync Locks enabled, this edit would place you out of sync because you would be 
removing a duration of audio without removing an equal duration from the other tracks. 
However, with Sync Locks enabled, Media Composer ensures that you are removing an equal 
duration of material from the other tracks. It accomplishes this by extracting material from all 
the sync locked tracks even though the Track Selectors on those other tracks are not enabled. 
Additional details about sync can be found in the Introduction section of this chapter, which 
includes an overview of the core concepts of Sync.

Extending using Ripple Trim with Sync 
Locks enabled
You may find it helpful to review the introduction to the earlier Opening up the sequence using 
Splice with Sync Locks enabled recipe as it includes an overview of Sync Locks.
In this recipe, let's imagine that, as assumed earlier in the chapter, you're editing a scene  
of a comedy television program.
Getting ready
The goals in this example are that:
f
f
You want to extend only the video of segment 64B/18 (pictured in the next 
screenshot). It's a close-up shot of one actor's shocked reaction to another  
actor's line of dialog.
f
f
You want to push the other segments (shots) in the sequence down, so that you can 
later add in the sound of the audience laughing underneath the video of the shocked 
reaction shot.
How to do it…
1.	 Enable Sync Locks for all the tracks (by clicking on the Sync Lock All Button found  
in the Sync Lock Column next to the Timecode Track Selector) if they all are not 
already enabled.
2.	 Enter Trim Mode at the transition for the segment (shot) that you want to extend.  
In this example it's the transition between segments 64B/18 and 64A/11 (see the 
following screenshot).
3.	 Select the segment that you want to extend. In this example I've selected the  
A-Side (segment 64B/18), as pictured in the following screenshot:

Previously you had extended only the video for segment 64B/18 (a close-up shot of

tracks A1 and A2). Later you plan to add some audience laughter to cover the silent 
region of Filler.
f
f
You've watched the timing of shots 64B/18 and 64A/11 and you feel that 64B/18  
is lasting a bit too long before cutting to 64A/11. So you want to shorten the video.
How to do it…
1.	 Enable Sync Locks for all the tracks by clicking the Sync Lock All Button (found  
in the Sync Lock Column next to the Timecode Track Selector) if they all are not 
already enabled.
2.	 Enter Trim Mode at the transition for the segment (shot) that you want to shorten.
3.	 Select the segment that you want to shorten. In this example I've selected the  
A-Side, which is labeled as shot 64B/18 (see the next screenshot):

4.	 Using your preferred method of trimming, shorten the segment. In this example, 
we would trim to the left in order to shorten the video. The result is pictured in the 
following screenshot:

Without Sync Locks enabled, this edit would place you out of sync because you would be 
removing a duration of video without also removing an equal duration from the other tracks. 
However, with Sync Locks enabled, Media Composer makes sure that you're removing an 
equal duration of material from the other tracks. It accomplishes this by removing an equal 
duration of Filler from all the sync-locked tracks even though the Track Selectors on those 
tracks are not enabled.
As a reminder, Sync Locks are programmed only to be able to adjust Filler. In other words, when 
trimming, Sync Locks will not affect segments of video or audio. If/When you have no Filler on a 
track while shortening, Media Composer will stop you from trimming any further. At such a time 
you'll have to enable and manually configure the Trim Rollers on the necessary tracks.

Getting back in sync
You may make an edit that causes your tracks to go out of sync with one another, and you may 
not notice it until much later, after making many other edits.
This recipe addresses the situation when the Sync Break Indicators begin at a point in the 
sequence and then continue on down to the end. For emphasis, unlike a sync break caused 
by a Slip or Slide, where the Sync Break Indictors are isolated to one segment or one area, in 
this instance, the Sync Break Indicators ripple down to the very end of the sequence.
The solution to a sync break problem caused by adding or removing material to one or more 
tracks without also adding or removing the same duration of material to all the other tracks 
is corrected by doing the opposite to those same tracks. In other words, if you added material 
to a track and that caused the tracks to become out of sync, then you must remove material 
from that track to regain sync (and vice versa).
While any of the duration-changing operations (Ripple Trim, Extract, or Splice-In) will work to 
solve a sync break issue like this, my preferred method is to use Ripple Trim. So, that is what 
I'll be using in the steps of the recipe in a moment. Also see the There's more... section for 
additional discussion on this topic.

How to do it...
1.	 Become the Sherlock Holmes of the editing room. Examine the sequence from left to 
right (from start to end). Take note of where the Sync Break Indicators first appear. 
Also make note if the sync break value is consistent or changes. If the sync break 
value changes, then possibly multiple edits were made that broke the sync between 
the video and the audio. In this example, I see two different sync break values. On the 
video track, the first is -14, and further down the sequence, I see a value of 20.
2.	 If enabled, turn off Sync Locks for the tracks that are out of sync.
3.	 Begin repairing the sync break problem at the first (leftmost/closest to the beginning) 
edit in the sequence. This is because just as the offending edit ripples down, so will 
the corrective edit.
4.	 In the previous example screenshot, the first sync break is 14 frames out of sync. To 
correct this, you can choose to trim either the video or the audio segment, it doesn't 
matter which. For this example, I choose to trim the video.
5.	 Enter Trim Mode at the transition prior to where the sync break first appears.
6.	 Select either the A-Side or B-Side segment. It doesn't matter which you select, since 
after repairing the sync problem, you'll refine the transition aesthetically. For this 
example I've chosen the A-Side, as pictured in the following screenshot:

Chapter 5
163
7.	
The Sync Break Indicator on the video track says -14. This is actually telling me how 
to fix the sync break by moving the video track 14 frames to the left. So I trim the 
segment labeled as SAM to be shorter by 14 frames. The result is pictured in the 
following screenshot:
8.	 Having corrected this, I see that it has repaired sync for several other segments 
downstream. However, I now see that there is another sync break that ripples down 
to the end of the sequence. Without realizing it, I must have made two separate edits 
that broke sync. So now I set about repairing that problem.
9.	 The Sync Break Indicators tell me that I'm 34 frames out of sync. As earlier, I decide 
to use Ripple Trim on the video track to tackle the problem. While I could have 
selected either the KATE or LEAH shot to be trimmed, I've selected the KATE shot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Maintaining and Regaining Sync
164
10.	 To correct this, I trim 34 frames to the right. The result is pictured in the  
following screenshot:
11.	 If there were more sync break problems, I would work my way down the sequence 
(moving from left to right), repeating the process detailed above.
12.	Once you've regained sync in your sequence, return to the edit points that you 
adjusted in order to regain sync. Review them to make sure that they work 
aesthetically. If they don't, then you'll make any necessary corrections.
There's more
The following are some additional methods to consider if/when you find that you're out of sync:
Method one: Undo (cmd/Ctrl + Z)
Especially for new users, I encourage after making an edit that you immediately review it.  
This way if there is a problem, not only will you catch it (and undo it), but also you'll be able  
to easily make a connection between the cause and the result, and learn from it.

Chapter 5
165
Method two: Slip/Slide
If you notice that the Sync Break Indicators are isolated to one segment or one area and do 
not ripple down to the end of the sequence, then this indicates that either a Slip or Slide has 
occurred to place them out of sync. Whatever you did that got you out of sync, you'll use the 
same operation (Slip or Slide) to correct the sync problem. Here's an example for correcting  
a segment that has been slipped out of sync:
f
f
I'm editing a dialog scene of a movie in which I have only one video track and one 
audio track.
f
f
Imagine that Sync Break Indicators for just one segment on the video track are 
displayed as -30, while the ones on the audio track are displayed as 30. The Sync 
Break Indicators are actually telling you how to fix the sync break. Negative values 
in Media Composer indicate movement to the left and positive numbers indicate 
movement to the right. So to correct this:
Enter Trim Mode and configure Slipping for either the video segment or the audio 
segment, but not both. In this example, I make the choice to slip just the video 
segment. In this example, the video segment displays -30. This indicates that  
I need to slip 30 frames to the left in order to regain sync with the audio segment.

Managing Your Media Files
168
Introduction
The goal of this chapter is to take some of the mystery out of dealing with media files and take 
you through some common situations. Before we dive in, here are some important and/or 
helpful things to be aware of:
1.	 The topics covered, and recipes of steps provided in this chapter, are geared towards 
those using local media drives for storage, for example, the internal hard drive, fixed 
hard drive(s), and/or a relatively small, local RAID.
2.	 Those working at a facility with Avid Unity, Avid ISIS, Avid Interplay, or another shared 
storage solution must consult with their facility's technical administrators or lead 
assistant editors before carrying out any media management functions in a shared 
storage environment. Failing to do so can cause inadvertent loss of media and/or 
employment.
3.	 Before Consolidating or Transcoding clips or sequences, it is highly recommended 
that you perform a small-scale test of the process to familiarize yourself with 
additional options and results. Ideally, you would be able to perform your small-scale 
test prior to receiving the mission-critical files and prior to the pressure and intensity 
of working under a deadline.
4.	 I suggest you take a moment to read Appendix B, Details on Trimming, Slipping, 
Sliding, and Segment Mode since it covers helpful information about how clips and 
media files work together. Understanding this relationship is crucial to understanding 
what happens during processes, such as Consolidating, Transcoding, Decomposing, 
and Sample Rate conversion.
5.	 It's important to distinguish this topic from copying/duplicating clips using the 
Duplicate command method (from the Edit menu) or using the option/Alt + drag to 
a different bin method (which Avid calls "Cloning."). In those instances, you are only 
making a duplicate of the clip information that links to (refers to) the media, but not 
the media itself. The topic of copying/duplicating versus Cloning clips is discussed in 
the Mixing frame rates recipe in Chapter 1, Getting Assets into Your Media Composer 
Project (see the There's more... section).
6.	 Every time you create media files by Capturing, Importing, Rendering, Consolidating, 
or Transcoding, they become associated with the Project that was open when they 
were created. In other words, they get a stamp on them that says I belong to 'Project 
X'. This knowledge will become helpful when we discuss copying media files, as well 
as using the Media Tool, in this chapter.

Chapter 6

7.	
To perform the tasks of moving, copying, and Consolidating media files, we use a 
function called Consolidate/Transcode (found in the Clip menu). First, let's demystify 
those terms.
Consolidate, in the context of Avid Media Composer, is essentially just a fancy word 
for copy. You can instruct Media Composer to do some other things in addition to 
copying media files, but at its core, that's all the Consolidate function does: make 
copies. Note that you may only Consolidate files supported by Media Composer's 
Codec library. RED files are an example of files that can not be Consolidated directly 
without first Transcoding them.
Transcode is making a copy too, but with an additional process applied. When you 
Transcode a clip's video media file, during the copy process, you are also changing  
its compression/codec. I'll discuss this in more detail in the Transcode section.
Moving media files
Please review items 1, 2, and 3 in the Introduction section of this chapter.
There are a few common reasons you may find yourself in need of moving media files:
f
f
You've captured, imported, Consolidated, or rendered media files onto the wrong hard 
drive or partition (for example, a drive that belongs to another editor or project)
f
f
A drive is failing and you need to get the media onto a healthy drive
f
f
You may want to take a copy of all your media, or just a specific portion of it, outside 
of your editing room to be edited with a laptop system on set, in a client's office, or on 
an airplane
f
f
A drive or partition is getting very full and you want to create space to give the Media 
Database files room to increase in file size
It is not possible to simply pick up a bundle of ones and zeros and move them from one 
location to another in the same way that you'd move a chair from one room to another. So, in 
this recipe are the steps to accomplish moving media files and then following that you'll find  
an explanation of what's actually happening in the How it works section.
Getting ready
You may want to do one or more of the following:

Check available hard drive/partition space. One way to do this is to use the Hardware

Determine where media resides. Select a bin (or the Media Tool window, discussed 
later in this chapter) by going to the Bin menu, choose Columns, select the Drive 
column, and click OK. Then:


Within a bin (in other words: not using the Media Tool), to display render 
files (also know as Precompute files) that are linked to (being used by) a 
sequence, select a bin containing a sequence(s), then go to the Bin menu, 
Set Bin Display, and enable Rendered Effects. For emphasis, only media 
files that are linked to, and being used by, the sequence(s) in the bin will be 
displayed. Later in this chapter is a discussion of determining (and deleting) 
unused media using the Media Tool. It should also be noted that media can 
be moved using the Media Tool as well. Again, the Media Tool is discussed 
later in this chapter.


Within a bin (in other words, not using the Media Tool), to display media 
files (captured, consolidated, imported, or AMA linked) that are linked to 
(being used by) a sequence, select an open bin containing a sequence(s), 
then go to the Bin menu, Set Bin Display, and enable Show Reference 
Clips. For emphasis, only clips and media files that are linked to, and being 
used by, the sequence(s) in the bin will be displayed. Later in this chapter is 
a discussion of determining (and deleting) unused media using the Media 
Tool. It should also be noted that media can be moved using the Media Tool 
as well. Again, the Media Tool is discussed later in this chapter.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to move media files:
1.	 In a bin, select the clips whose media files you want to move. If you've chosen to 
display render files, then you could select them if you wanted/needed to. Note that  
an alternative to selecting clips and/or render files in a bin is to instead use the 
Media Tool. The Media Tool is discussed later in this chapter.
2.	 With the clips and/or render files selected, go to Clip menu | Consolidate/
Transcode. The Consolidate/Transcode dialog window will open.

3.	 Select the following:


In the upper left-hand side corner, select Consolidate.


Under the heading Target Drives, enable the checkbox for Video, Audio,  
and Data on same drive (it will most likely be enabled by default).


In the Video/Data list box, select the destination drive/partition you want  
to move the media file(s) onto.


Enable the checkbox for Delete original media files when done. This is 
the key to moving the media files, rather than copying them. This will be 
discussed in the How it works section later.
4.	 In the bottom right corner of the dialog window, click the Consolidate button to  
begin the process. Depending on the number of files, and the size of those files,  
this process may take some time.
5.	 If for any reason you need to stop the process (for example, it's taking a long time and 
you realize you better get back to editing and do the media moving later), you can do 
this at any time by pressing cmd/Ctrl + the period(.) key. This will stop the process 
for the media file currently being copied. Any previously copied media will remain 
intact on the destination drive you selected. When you return to this task later, follow 
the steps above with the addition of enabling one more checkbox: Skip media files 
already on target drive. This will prevent copying files that are already copied and 
making the process take longer than necessary.
How it works...
Since we can't move digital files in the same way that we move an object from one location  
to another, we instead copy the files, delete the originals, and then Relink the Master Clips  
to the copied media. Let's follow one Master Clip (named PATTY) and its media files on  
their journey being moved from drive A to drive B. The next picture is a simplified illustration  
of the following:

There are three media files, because one of them is the video, one of them is track 1

The final image (below) shows that once the media files have been copied onto drive B, the 
original media files are deleted from drive A. Additionally, we see that the PATTY Master Clip 
has been relinked to the media on drive B. The final result is that the same Master Clip now 
links to media on drive B. The magic trick is now complete; the media files have been moved.
Copying a borrowed clip's media
Please review items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the Introduction section of this chapter.
There are a couple of common reasons you may find yourself in need of copying media files, 
which will be the focus in this recipe section and the recipe that follows it.
The focus of this first recipe is that you've borrowed a clip from another project and you want 
to permanently have a copy that is associated with your currently active project.

Getting ready
It's important to emphasize that when you borrow a Clip, what you are doing is creating a  
copy of just the Clip that links (refers) to the actual picture and audio media files. You are  
not creating new media. Further, the media you are linking to is still associated with the 
project in which it was originally created. 
While you can definitely edit with a clip borrowed from another project, there are a couple  
of potential drawbacks if you do not have control over the other project's media:
f
f
If you borrowed a clip from your workmate's project and she doesn't know you're using 
it, she may delete the media. If she deleted the media files, then you'd still have the 
clip but, unfortunately, it would not be linked to any media. In other words, the media 
would be Offline.
f
f
If you had to move your workstation (computer and external hard drives) to another 
location and if you didn't have your own copy of the media on your own drive, then 
when you relocated (without your workmate's media drive) the clip would be Offline.
So, those are two examples why you may want/need to make a copy of the media so that it  
is associated with your project, and you have control over it. However, before you can perform 
the copying, you have to perform the borrowing. There are two methods to borrow clips 
presented, which are as follows:
Let's take a look at the first method of borrowing a clip through opening a bin from  
another project:
1.	 Create a new bin or open an existing bin. This will be the bin you'll eventually  
copy your borrowed clip(s) into.
2.	 Select the Project Window to make it active (but do not select any bins).
3.	 Go to the File menu and choose Open Bin.
4.	 Navigate to the Project folder that contains the bin (which holds the clip) you  
want to open/borrow.
5.	 Select the bin you want to open/borrow.
6.	 Click the Open button.
7.	
The bin will open. Furthermore, the bin will reside inside a folder that Media 
Composer creates in your Project Window called Other Bins. The italics remind  
you that these bin files are not part of your project (meaning inside your project's 
folder). To discontinue borrowing a bin(s), select them and press the Delete key.  
In this instance, you are not actually deleting the bin file. You're simply telling Media 
Composer that you no longer want to borrow it. For emphasis, the original file is okay 
and continues to reside in the other project's folder.

Chapter 6
175
8.	 Select the clip(s) you want to borrow. Then go to the Edit menu | Duplicate. This 
creates a duplicate of the clip(s). Note that the difference between a Duplicated clip 
and a Cloned clip is discussed in the Mixing frame rates recipe in Chapter 1, Getting 
Assets into Your Media Composer Project (see the There's more... section).
9.	 Move the duplicates into the bin discussed in step 1.
10.	 Close the bin which you borrowed. Optional: in the Project Window, check the Other 
Bins folder, select the bin, and press the Delete key to discontinue borrowing it.
Now let's look at the second method of borrowing a clip from another project by using the 
Media Tool: 
1.	 Create a new bin or open an existing bin. This will be the bin you'll eventually copy 
your borrowed clip(s) into.
2.	 Open the Media Tool by going to the Tools menu | Media Tool.
3.	 In the Media Tool dialog window, select the following:


In the Media Drives display region, select the drive where the media  
resides. If you're not sure, then you can select them all by clicking the  
All Drives button.


In the Projects display region, select the name of the project from which you 
want to borrow a clip(s).


Of the three checkboxes, select only the one labeled Master Clips and click 
on OK. The Media Tool window will open. It looks and behaves just like a bin.
4.	 Drag-and-drop the clip(s) from the Media Tool into the bin discussed in step 1.  
There is no need to press any keys on the keyboard when you do this because  
Media Composer will automatically create a Clone of the Master Clip. Pretty cool, huh?
5.	 Close the Media Tool window.
How to do it...
1.	 Borrow a clip(s) by following either one of the methods found previously in the Getting 
ready section.
2.	 In the bin that you opened or created, and just Duplicated or Cloned a clip(s) into:


Set the bin to Text display.


Then, display the columns for Drive and Project. Do this by selecting the bin, 
then going to the Bin Menu and select Choose Columns, then in the Column 
Selection Dialog Window select Drive and Project, and then click OK.


Rearrange the columns to make sure you can see the Drive and  
Project columns.
www.it-ebooks.info

Managing Your Media Files
176
3.	 Notice that the Project column displays the name of the project from which you've 
borrowed the clip(s). This is telling you which project the media is associated with.  
In other words, which project the media belongs to.
4.	 Select the clip(s) you borrowed.
5.	 Go to Clip menu | Consolidate/Transcode.
6.	 In the Consolidate/Transcode dialog window, select the following:


In the upper left corner, select Consolidate.


Under the heading Target Drives, enable the checkbox for Video, audio  
and data on same drive (it will probably be enabled by default).


In the Video/Data list box, select the destination drive/partition you want  
to place the new media file(s) onto.


Disable (uncheck) the checkbox for Delete original media files when done. 
This is the key to copying the media files. For emphasis, make sure to 
deselect the checkbox for Delete original media files when done.


Skip media files already on the target drive checkbox – if the original 
media you are copying resides on the same drive you want to place the  
copy, then you must deselect this checkbox in order for the copy to occur.
7.	
In the bottom right corner of the dialog window, click the Consolidate button to go to 
the next phase of the process.
8.	 The Copying Media Files dialog window will open.
9.	 Select the first option that reads, Keep Master Clips linked to media on the original 
drive. This makes sure that the original clip(s) stay linked to their original media and 
that you'll get a new Master Clip linked to its own, separate media.
10.	 Click the OK button.
11.	 Depending on the number of files, and the size of those files, this process may  
take some time.
12.	If for any reason you need to stop the process (for example, it's taking a long time and 
you realize you better get back to editing and do the media copying later), you can do 
this at any time by pressing cmd/Ctrl + the period(.) key. This will stop the process for 
the media file currently being copied. Any previously copied media will remain intact 
on the target drive you selected. Note that if you are copying to a different drive than 
the original media resides, then when you return to this task later, follow the previous 
steps as well as enable one additional checkbox: Skip media files already on target 
drive. This will prevent copying files that are already copied and making the process 
take longer than necessary.

Chapter 6
177
13.	When the copy process is completed, every clip and the media that goes with it will 
have been duplicated. All the new clips will be at the top of the bin.
14.	 Take note of the clip name(s). You'll see that Media Composer has added .new to the 
end (so, they are frequently referred to as Dot New Clips).
15.	Take note of the Project column. You'll see that the .new clip(s) are associated with 
your project.
16.	 Delete the clips that you borrowed so that you do not mistakenly edit with them. For 
emphasis, delete only the clip(s) but not the actual media files. To do this, continue 
with the following steps.
17.	 Select the original clips that you Duplicated or Cloned from the other project (these 
will not have the .new at the end of their names).
18.	Press the Delete key.
19.	The Delete dialog window will open.
20.	Select only the checkbox that says Delete Master Clips. For emphasis, do not select 
any checkboxes that relate to media files.
21.	 Click the OK button.
22.	Rest easy; all that is deleted in this instance is the Master Clip (the information that 
links/refers to the media). The media is untouched and nothing has been altered in 
the other project from which you originally borrowed the clip(s).
How it works...
For emphasis, this procedure works because you disabled the checkbox for Delete original 
media files when done. This is the key to copying the media files, rather than relocating them 
to another drive.
Sharing clips/backing-up clips
Please review items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the Introduction section of this chapter.
For this second recipe in this topic of actually copying media files (the previous one is the first 
recipe), the situation is as follows: you are not in a shared media situation (for example, Avid 
Unity, ISIS, or Interplay) and your workmate brings in a fixed hard drive and asks you to give 
them a copy of one or two entire shots (we'll cover making copies of/Consolidating Subclips 
later in this chapter). Or, similarly, you want to make a back-up copy of your media files onto 
another drive.

How to do it…
1.	 In a bin, select the clip(s) that you want to share or back up.
2.	 In the previous Copying a borrowed clip's media recipe, follow only steps 5  
through 14. 
3.	 If:


If you are backing up the media files onto another drive, then you are done. 
The media files could be Relinked to in the future, and/or Master Clips could 
be created by using the second method (using the Media Tool) discussed in 
the previous Copying a borrowed clip's media recipe Getting Ready section.  
If you'd like to make a back-up bin as well, then follow steps 4 through 10.


If you are giving copies to a workmate, follow the next additional steps, 
which will provide them with a bin. Sure, they could make Clones of the 
clips themselves using the Media Tool as discussed in the previous recipe's 
(Copying a borrowed clip's media recipe) Getting Ready section, but giving 
them a bin is a nice gesture.
4.	 Select the bin that contains the .new clips you created.
5.	 Go to the File menu | Save Bin Copy As….
6.	 The Save As dialog window will open.
7.	
Name the bin.
8.	 Navigate to the drive you want to place the bin file copy (most likely the drive onto 
which you just placed the media).
9.	 Click the Save button.
10.	 On their drive they now have the media as well as a copy of the bin that they can then 
associate with their project.
How it works...
Let's follow one Master Clip (named PATTY) and its media files that are on drive A along their 
journey being copied onto drive B. The next picture is a simplified illustration of he following:

Consolidating Subclips
Please review items 1, 2, and 3 in the Introduction section of this chapter.
There are two common reasons why you may want to Consolidate Subclips:
f
f
Situation 1: Reduce media (copying only portions you want and then deleting original 
media) – an example of this situation would be: you have ingested a very long 
duration of video and audio to create one Master Clip (for example, you captured 
a complete movie from a tape). Let's pretend that this single Master Clip is 90 
minutes long. During the review process, you went through and created subclips of 
the portions you wanted to use. You've added up the duration of all the Subclips and 
they total just 30 minutes. This means that you have 60 minutes of media that you 
do not want to use and it is taking up valuable hard drive space. By Consolidating 
(copying) just the media that is being referenced by the Subclips (which makes brand 
new Master Clips for just those portions) and then deleting the original 90-minute 
long Master Clip media, you will be able to have the portions you want to use as well 
as free up the drive space.
f
f
Situation 2: Share media (copying only portions you want and not deleting original 
media) – as an example, similar to the previous situation, you have a single 
90-minute long Master Clip of a movie from which you are editing a trailer. Your 
workmate has been tasked with creating a short interview segment with the star of 
the film. He has come to you because he needs a bit of footage from the film to help 
make his project more interesting. He doesn't need or want the entire film, he only 
needs a few key shots (plus giving him a copy of the entire film would take a lot more 
time and drive space). He has brought his hard drive with him and connected it to 
your computer. In this situation you would make Subclips of the portions he wants, 
then you'd Consolidate (copy) them in order to make brand new Master Clips and 
media for him. Further, in this situation, you would not want to delete the original 
90-minute long Master Clip media because you're using it.
Getting ready
f
f
Make your Subclips
f
f
Decide whether you want/need to delete the original media after the copies have 
been created
How to do it...
1.	 Select the Subclips.
2.	 Go to the Clip menu | Consolidate/Transcode.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 6
183
3.	 The Consolidate/Transcode dialog window will open.
4.	 In the Consolidate/Transcode dialog window, select the following:
i.	
In the upper left-hand side corner, select Consolidate.
ii.	
Under the heading Target Drives, enable the checkbox for Video, audio 
and data on same drive (it will most likely be enabled by default).
iii.	 In the Video/Data list box, select the destination drive/partition you 
want to place the new media file(s) onto.
iv.	 In the Handle length entry box, enter a value. This will instruct Media 
Composer to make the new Master Clips longer than the original 
Subclips. For example, you have a Subclip that is 10 seconds long. You 
enter a duration of 60 frames for the handle. This will add 60 frames 
to the head (beginning) of the new Master Clip as well as 60 frames to 
the tail of the new Master Clip. So, in a 30-fps project, the total duration 
of the new Master Clip will be 14 seconds. Adding handle ensures that 
you have some additional material at the head and tail, just in case you 
made your Subclips slightly inaccurate.
You may enter a value of zero if you want. However, be aware that Media 
Composer is programmed to always make both a new Master Clip and a 
new Subclip, even if no additional handle has been added. So, if you set 
the handle duration to 0, this would produce a new Master Clip and a new 
Subclip that are the exact same duration. In this situation you may want 
to edit only with the new Master Clips because using the newly created 
Subclips may cause some confusion. The confusion would arise because a 
Subclip normally refers back to a longer Master Clip; and Match Framing 
from one of these Subclips back to the Master Clip could be confusing since 
they would be the exact same length. There is an exception to this, however. 
If, prior to Consolidating, you have renamed the Subclips, added comments, 
and descriptions to each, the Consolidate function will keep that information 
(metadata) on the .new Subclips but not on the .new Master Clips. 
Therefore, you may want to continue editing with the .new Subclips.
v.	
Now comes the all-important checkbox, the one that says Delete 
original media files when done. Stop, and determine your needs.
vi.	 If you are in situation 1 (reducing media) as described previously in 
the introduction to this section, then you will select this checkbox. For 
emphasis, this will delete the original media files once the copies (the new 
Master Clips) have been created. You will end up with media only for the 
portion that the Subclips referenced (plus any handle you added).
www.it-ebooks.info

184
vii.	 If you are in situation 2 (sharing media) as described previously, then 
you will not select this checkbox. For emphasis, this will not delete the 
original media files once the copies (the new Master Clips) have been 
created. You will end up with new Master Clips and media in addition to 
the originals.
viii.	 Skip media files already on the target drive checkbox – if the original 
media you are copying resides on the same drive you want to place the 
copy, then you must deselect this checkbox in order for the copy to occur.
5.	 In the bottom right-hand corner of the dialog window, click the Consolidate button to 
begin the process.
6.	 Depending on the number of files, and the size of those files, this process may  
take some time.
7.	
When the process is completed:


All the new clips will be at the top of the bin, and will have .new added to  
the end of their name.


For each Subclip you selected, Media Composer is programmed to give you 
a new Master Clip and a new Subclip. The duration of each new Master 
Clip is the duration of the original Subclip, plus the duration of any handles 
you added. The new Subclip is the same duration as the original Subclip. 
Presumably, this would be of use if you set very long handles.
8.	 If you are giving copies to a workmate, who has brought you his/her hard drive, 
then you may want to follow the next additional steps that will provide them with a 
bin. Sure, they could make Clones of the clips themselves using the Media Tool as 
discussed earlier in this chapter (Copying a borrowed clip's media, in the Getting 
ready section), but giving them a bin is a nice gesture.
9.	 Select the bin that contains the .new clips you created.
10.	 Go to the File menu | Save Bin Copy As….
11.	 The Save As dialog window will open.
12.	Name the bin.
13.	Navigate to the drive you want to place the bin file copy (most likely the drive you just 
placed the media).
14.	 Click the Save button.
15.	On their drive they now have the media as well as a copy of the bin that they can then 
associate with their project.

How it works...
Let's follow two Subclips, named Fire Ball and Big Punch, and the media files that reside

In this example, the Subclips are consolidated without deleting the original media, and the 
handle length is set to 60 frames. The final image (next) shows:

Two sets of media files are copied onto drive B. One set is for the Fire Ball shot

Media Composer creates new Subclips, named Fire Ball.new and Big  
Punch.new. 
f
f
The new Master Clips are the duration of the original Subclips, plus the 60 frames

Consolidating Sequences
Please review items 1, 2, and 3 in the Introduction section to this chapter.
Two common reasons why you may want to Consolidate a sequence:
f
f
Situation 1: Reduce media (copying and then deleting original media) – one 
example of this would be saving a copy of the low resolution version of a sequence 
and deleting the original media in order to clear space on the hard drives for the 
high resolution media you'll be creating during the finishing stages of the project 
(frequently referred to as the up-res). Doing this provides you with a sequence 
at the original, lower resolution that you can use to compare with the new, high 
resolution version to ensure that the correct material has been recaptured at high 
resolution. This is not a safeguard against anything regarding Avid Media Composer 
but rather against decks that don't cue up properly during the recapture/up-res (as 
I've had happen with DVCAM decks) or against human error (for example, a source 
has been incorrectly labeled). Performing the additional steps of a Transcode after 
Consolidating may free up additional hard drive space. So, you may also want to 
review the Transcoding sequences for archiving or before up-res recipe (immediately 
follows this topic in this chapter) to decide if also performing a Transcode is a useful 
addition/alternative to the Consolidate process. 
f
f
Situation 2: Share media – (copying and not deleting original media) – one example 
of this situation would be: you are not in a shared media situation (for example, using 
Avid Unity, ISIS or Interplay). You are editing a film and a workmate has been tasked 
with creating some titles and effects for one scene. She needs a copy of only that 
scene so she can use it as a reference while working in another edit bay. She has 
brought her hard drive with her and connected it to your computer. In this situation, 
you would make a Sub-Sequence of the scene she wants, then you'd Consolidate 
(copy) the Sub-Sequence's media in order to make brand new Master Clips of just 
the portions of media that are required to make her Sub-Sequence play. Further,  
in this situation, you would not want to delete the original media because you're  
using it. Lastly, you must also provide her with a bin containing the Consolidated  
Sub-Sequence.
What does consolidating a sequence do?
f
f
Media Composer makes a brand new Master Clip for each and every segment (shot) 
that is in the sequence (additionally, if a shot was edited from a Subclip or a Group 
Clip, Media Composer will also create one of these). Each new Master Clip will have 
.new added to the end of the name (which is why they are frequently referred to as 
dot new clips).
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Managing Your Media Files
188
f
f
The new Master Clips' durations are only as long as what exists in the sequence, 
plus any handle you decide to add. Handle is additional material at the head 
(beginning) and tail of each Master Clip that doesn't appear in the Consolidated 
sequence. It is there only if you later need to Trim a Segment longer or need to add 
a transition effect, such as a dissolve. For emphasis, after Consolidating a sequence 
the Segments (shots) can only be trimmed as long as the handle duration.
f
f
Once you make a Consolidated version of a sequence, it will link to the .new Master 
Clips that are created (which are shorter than the originals). This is one reason it is 
important to make a duplicate of your sequence before you Consolidate, Transcode, 
or Decompose it.
Getting ready
f
f
Before you Consolidate (or Transcode, or Decompose) a sequence, it is highly 
recommended that you make a duplicate of it and place it in its own well-labeled bin 
(for example, My Movie Before Consolidate). This extra version will not only protect 
you in case you make an error, but also will help to keep your project organized for 
future reference.
f
f
Before Consolidating, Transcoding, or Decomposing sequences: I highly encourage 
you to perform a small-scale test of the process with some clips that are for testing 
purposes only in order to familiarize yourself with the workflow, additional options, 
and final results.
f
f
Decide whether you want/need to delete the original media after the Consolidated 
copies have been created.
How to do it...
1.	 Create a new bin by doing the following:


If you are in a situation similar to situation 1 (discussed previously), this 
new bin will become the location of the duplicated sequence you create in 
step 2 (which will eventually be Consolidated). Duplicating the sequence 
and placing it in this bin protects the original and provides an extra back-up 
version that will not only help you in case you make an error but also will help 
to keep your project organized for future reference. You would label the bin 
along the lines of My Movie Consolidated.


If you are in a situation similar to situation 2 (discussed previously), this 
new bin will be where you place the Sub-Sequence you create before 
Consolidating. When the Consolidate is completed, you must provide your 
workmate with a copy of this bin on their hard drive. You would label the bin 
along the lines of Consolidated Sequence For My Workmate.

2.	 Create the duplicate by doing the following:


If you are in a situation similar to situation 1, then you will duplicate  
the entire sequence and place it into the bin you created in step 1.  
One method to duplicate a sequence is: select the sequence, then  
go to Edit menu | Duplicate.


If you are in a situation similar to situation 2, then you will create a  
Sub-Sequence. One method to create a Sub-Sequence is:
i.	
Load the complete, original sequence into the Timeline Window.
ii.	
Enable the tracks you want/need to be included in the  
Sub-Sequence (for example, V2, V1, A1, and A2).
iii.	 Place a Mark In and a Mark Out around the portion of the 
original sequence that you want to isolate as a Sub-Sequence.
iv.	 Hold down the option/Alt key, then, click inside the Record 
Window and continue to hold down the mouse button. Then,  
as you continue to hold down the option/Alt key and the mouse 
button, drag-and-drop the Sub-Sequence you are creating into 
the bin that you made in step 1.
3.	 For an additional layer of protection, close all other bins except the bin you created in 
step 1. This will ensure you don't mistakenly Consolidate the wrong sequence when 
you're tired at 4 o'clock in the morning.
4.	 Select the sequence you placed into the new bin from step 1.
5.	 Go to the Clip menu | Consolidate/Transcode.
6.	 The Consolidate/Transcode dialog window will open.
7.	
In the Consolidate/Transcode dialog window, select the following:
i.	
In the upper left-hand corner, select Consolidate.
ii.	
Under the heading Target Drives, enable the checkbox for Video, audio 
and data on same drive (it will most likely be enabled by default).
iii.	 In the Video/Data list box, select the destination drive/partition you 
want to place the new media files onto.
iv.	 In the Handle length entry box, enter a value. This will instruct Media 
Composer to make the new Master Clips and media for each segment 
(shot) in the sequence longer than the current durations of the 
segments. For example, one of the segments (shots) is 10 seconds 
long. You enter a duration of 60 frames for the handle length. This will 
add 60 frames to the head (beginning) of the new Master Clip as well 
as 60 frames to the tail of the new Master Clip. So, in a 30-fps project, 
the total duration of the new Master Clip will be 14 seconds. Adding 
handle ensures that you have some additional material at the head and 
tail of each segment, just in case you need to trim a shot longer or add a 
transition effect (for example, a dissolve).

v.	
Be sure to enable/check the box for Create new Sequence (note that 
some previous versions of Media Composer do not have this selection). 
Even though you manually created a duplicate earlier, this is yet one 
more layer of protection for you.
vi.	 The Delete original media files when done checkbox is very important. 
Stop, and determine your needs:


If you are in a situation similar to situation 1 (reducing media, 
as described previoulsy), then you will select this checkbox. For 
emphasis, this will delete the original media files once the copies 
(the new Master Clips and media) have been created. You will 
end up with Master Clips and media only for the portion that each 
Segment (shot) referenced (plus any handle you added). The original 
media will be deleted and will be offline.


If you are in a situation similar to situation 2 (sharing media, 
described previously), then you will not select this checkbox. For 
emphasis, this will not delete the original media files once the copies 
(the new Master Clips and media) have been created. You will end up 
with new Master Clips and media in addition to the originals.
vii.	
 Skip media files already on the target drive checkbox – if the original 
media you are Consolidating (copying) resides on the same drive you 
want to place the copy, then you must de-select this checkbox in order 
for the copy to occur.
8.	 In the bottom right-hand corner of the dialog window, click the Consolidate button to 
begin the process.
9.	 Depending on the number of files, and the size of those files, this process may  
take some time. When the process is completed:


All the new Master Clips will be at the top of the bin, and will have .new 
added to the end of their name. Because of this, these are frequently 
referred to as the dot new clips.


You will have two sequences in the bin. One of them is the original that 
continues to link to the original Master Clips and media (of course if you 
deleted the media as in situation 1, then the media will be Offline). The 
new sequence was created by Media Composer because you enabled the 
Create new Sequence checkbox in step 7. The new sequence will have 
.Consolidated added to the end of the name. This sequence links to  
the .new Master Clips and media.
10.	 Follow one of these options:

If you are clearing hard drive space of unneeded media (as in situation 1), 
you may want to review the later sections in this chapter on using the Media 
tool and methods of locking and deleting media.

If you are in a situation similar to situation 2 (giving copy to a workmate who 
has brought you his/her hard drive), then you must follow the next additional 
steps in order to provide them with a bin containing the Consolidated 
sequence that links to the Consolidated .new Master Clips and media.  
To do this:
i.	
Select the bin that contains the .new clips and the .Consolidated 
sequence.
ii.	
Go to the File menu | Save Bin Copy As….
iii.	 The Save As dialog window will open.
iv.	 Name the bin.
v.	
Navigate to the drive onto which you want to place the bin file copy  
(most likely the drive you just placed the media onto).
vi.	 Click the Save button.
vii.	 The final result is that on your workmate's drive is the media as well as  
a copy of the sequence bin that they will then need to associate with 
their project.
How it works...
Remember, as discussed at the beginning of this section, Media Composer makes a brand 
new Master Clip for each and every segment (shot) that is in the sequence, and that the new 
Master Clips' durations are only as long as what exists in the Sequence, plus any handle you 
decide to add. Further, making a backup of the original Sequence is important because once 
you make a Consolidated version of a Sequence, it will link to the ".new" Master Clips that are 
created (which are shorter than the originals).
Transcoding Sequences for archiving or 
before up-res
Please review items 1, 2, and 3 in the Introduction section of this chapter.
Before you Transcode (or Consolidate, or Decompose) a sequence, it is highly recommended 
that you first duplicate it and place the duplicate into its own well-labeled bin (for example, My 
Movie Before Transcode). This extra version is a protection in case you make an error, and it 
will help to keep your project organized.

Common reasons why you may want or need to Transcode a sequence:
f
f
Situation 1 – archiving after finishing:
You have previously Decomposed the sequence (which made .new Master Clips for 
each segment in the sequence). You have already gone through the up-res process 
and recaptured the video at a high resolution (for example, 1:1). You have finished 
all of the final outputs. The project is officially completed, but you foresee a possible 
need in the future to have access to the project still in sequence form (for example, 
to make elements for the Internet, such as a teaser, a trailer, and so on). However, 
you feel that archiving the project at its present high resolution is not necessary, 
and you'd prefer to compress the video (to Transcode it) to a lower resolution. The 
resolution you select depends on your needs. It could be compressed a great deal in 
order to take up minimal hard drive space (for example, 15:1s or DNxHD36). While 
the image quality would be degraded because of the high compression, possibly 
you only need it in this form for reference purposes. On the other hand, you might 
compress it to a resolution that keeps the image quality acceptable for use as DVD 
extras or for the Internet while also reducing the hard drive storage required (for 
example, 3:1 or DNxHD145).
f
f
Situation 2 – Consolidating and Transcoding to create a reference sequence:


Note that Transcoding a Consolidated sequence is an additional step you  
may choose to perform in order to free up additional hard drive space,  
but it is not required.


You are about to begin the finishing stage of the project where you'll be 
recapturing the video at a higher resolution (see situation 1 in the previous 
Consolidating sequences recipe).


In addition to Consolidating the sequence, you want to further compress  
the video to free up additional hard drive space.


Note that the Transcoding dialog window does not have any options to delete 
the original media after the Transcoded copies are created. If you want to 
free up drive space, then you will perform the media deletion manually.
f
f
Situation 3: You have a sequence of mixed Standard Definition (SD) video and High 
Definition (HD) video. You need the sequence to be a consistent format throughout 
in order to output it. In other words, you need it to be entirely SD or entirely HD. This 
situation will be covered in the next Transcoding sequences of mixed SD and HD 
video recipe.

What does Transcoding a sequence do?
f
f
When you Transcode a sequence, Media Composer makes a brand new Master Clip 
for each and every Segment (shot) that is in the sequence (also see important note 
that follows). The new Master Clips' durations are only as long as what exists in the 
sequence, plus any handle you decide to add. Handle is additional material at the 
head (beginning) and tail of each Master Clip that doesn't appear in the Transcoded 
sequence. It is there only if you later need to trim a segment longer or need to add a 
transition effect, such as a dissolve.
f
f
Transcoding changes the compression scheme of the video – in other words, 
it changes the codec (method used to compress a video file for storage and to 
decompress it for playback). Transcoding can not increase the quality of the image. 
For example, if your footage came from a MiniDV tape (the resolution is DV25) and 
you Transcoded to a resolution of 1:1 (uncompressed), then the new file will take up 
more space on your hard drive but will not increase the quality to make it look any 
better. On the other hand, if you Transcoded to a resolution of 15:1s, then the file will 
be compressed further. So, along with a reduction in file size, the image quality will 
be reduced as well. Here's another example: transcoding SD video to HD does not 
increase the image quality. It is simply putting that image into the HD format. On the 
flip side, Transcoding HD video to SD will indeed reduce the quality of the image as it 
places it into that format.
f
f
The Transcoding dialog window does not have any options to delete the original 
media after the Transcoded copies are created. If you want to free up drive space, 
then you will do that manually.
Note a new behavior – Transcoding clips of a different frame rate will now 
take on all the attributes of the current project's frame rate, losing any 
history to what it was before the Transcode. This is something to consider 
if an EDL is needed for the original material or you ever wanted to link back 
to the original files. Don't worry, you will be presented with a dialog box 
alerting you that the Transcode will no longer allow the clip(s) to recapture, 
relink, and so on, to its original frame rate.
Also, unlike Consolidate, Transcode will only make new Master Clips 
for the video by default. In other words, it does not make Master Clips 
that include audio by default. There is a workaround for this, described in 
step 13 of this recipe. However, this workaround will only apply to video 
and audio that originally came from the same clip and were cut into the 
sequence together (for example, an actor speaking dialog). For emphasis, 
the workaround will not affect audio-only clips (for example, music, sound 
effects, or dialog edited into the sequence without the video that was 
originally paired with it).

Getting ready
Please review items 1, 2, and 3 in the Introduction section of this chapter.
Make a duplicate of your sequence as discussed previously.
Note which situation you are in:
f
f
Situation 1: Transcoding a Decomposed Sequence from high resolution to a lower 
resolution for archiving. This presumes the following:


You Decomposed your sequence (which created .new Master Clips).


You have already recaptured the video for the .new clips at high resolution 
for example, 1:1).


You have fully completed all the necessary outputs and masters and now 
want to archive the sequence at a lower resolution.
f
f
Situation 2: Consolidating then Transcoding a sequence to create a reference 
sequence. Reminder: the goal of the process covered here is to further reduce the 
amount of media stored on the hard drive(s). Transcoding a Consolidated sequence  
is an additional step you may choose to perform in order to free up additional hard 
drive space, but it is not required.
f
f
If you are in situation 1, then proceed to step 1 of this recipe.
f
f
If you are in situation 2, then:


First, you will need to Consolidate your sequence. Follow all the  
steps for situation 1 in the earlier recipe of this chapter titled,  
Consolidating sequences.


Once completed, you will have a Consolidated sequence, but the video will be 
at the original resolution. If you want to further reduce the hard drive space 
required for the media, then you would follow the next Transcoding steps.
How to do it...
1.	 Create a new bin. This new bin will be the place where you put a duplicate of 
the sequence you will create in a moment (which will eventually be Transcoded). 
Duplicating the sequence and placing it in this bin protects the original and provides 
an extra back-up version that will not only help you in case you make an error but 
also will help to keep your project organized for future reference. Depending on your 
situation, you would label the bin along the lines of My Final High Resolution Movie 
Transcoded, or My Consolidated Movie Transcoded.
2.	 Create the duplicate of the high resolution or Consolidated sequence: select the 
sequence, then go to the Edit menu | Duplicate.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 6
195
3.	 Place the duplicated sequence into the bin from step 1.
4.	 This is an optional step: For an additional layer of protection, close all other bins 
except the bin you created in step 1. This will ensure you don't mistakenly Transcode 
the wrong sequence when you're tired at the end of the day.
5.	 Go to the Project Window | Format tab.
6.	 In the Format tab, select the Project Type and Aspect Ratio. Avid states that, new 
clips created through the Transcode operation are in the project format. When you 
Transcode a clip across formats, for example, if you transcode a 16:9 clip in a 4:3 
project, the Reformat bin setting determines how the clip is conformed to the new 
format. For details on the Reformat option, see the Getting The AMA file's image to 
display as described recipe in Chapter 1, Getting Assets into your Media Composer 
Project (this applies to non-AMA'd files as well).
7.	
Select the duplicated sequence you placed into the new bin from step 1.
8.	 Go to the Clip Menu | Consolidate/Transcode.
9.	 The Consolidate/Transcode dialog window will open.
10.	 In the Consolidate/Transcode dialog window, select the following:


In the upper left-hand corner, select Transcode.


Under the heading Target Drives, enable the checkbox for Video, audio and 
data on same drive (it will most likely be enabled by default).


In the Video/Data list box, select the destination drive/partition you want to 
place the new media files onto.


In the Handle length entry box, enter a value. If you enter a value that is 
equal to or longer than the handle length you set when you Decomposed or 
Consolidated the sequence, then the new, Transcoded Master Clips will be 
the same duration as those. Setting a shorter handle length here will create 
new, Transcoded Master Clips that are shorter than the Decomposed or 
Consolidated versions.


Be sure to enable/check the box for Create new Sequence (note that some 
previous versions of Media Composer do not have this selection). Even 
though you manually created a duplicate earlier, this is yet one more layer  
of protection for you.


Enable/check the box for Convert Video.


Target Video Resolution menu: select the resolution you want to Transcode 
the files to.


Include reformatted clips already at target resolution checkbox – Avid 
states, "Select this option if you want to include reformatted clips in the 
sequence that are already at the target video resolution. Your Avid editing 
application does not normally Transcode clips in a sequence that are 
already at the target video resolution. However, you might want to include 
Reformatted clips at the target resolution to preserve the Reformatting."

11.	 Convert Audio Sample Rate checkbox and menu – selecting this is optional.


Not selecting this checkbox – this produces new Master Clips and media 
for each segment (shot) in the sequence. However, they will be video only 
Master Clips. The audio will still play in the sequence because the audio is 
supplied by the original Master Clips and media. The possible problem with 
this is that if you ever needed to Match Frame back to one of the Master 
Clips, the clip loaded into your Source Window would be either Video Only or 
Audio Only.


Selecting this checkbox – if you want/need to have the new Master Clips 
include both the video and audio that originally came from the same clip and 
which were cut into the sequence together (for example, an actor speaking 
dialog), then you must select this checkbox. Even if you select the existing 
sample rate of the audio, it will still work. However, this will not affect other 
audio in the sequence (for example, music, sound effects, or dialog edited 
into the sequence without the video that was originally paired with it). For 
emphasis, new Master Clips for these type of audio elements (music, sound 
effects, and so on). will not be created. The audio will still play in the sequence 
because the audio is supplied by the original Master Clips and media.
12.	In the bottom right-hand corner of the dialog window, click the Transcode button to 
begin the process.
13.	Depending on the number of files, and the size of those files, this process 
may take some time. When the process is completed:


All the newly created .new Master Clips will be at the top of the bin.


You will have two sequences in the bin. Depending on your situation, one of 
them is either the high resolution sequence or the Consolidated sequence, 
which continues to link to its original Master Clips and media. The new 
sequence was created by Media Composer because you enabled the Create 
new Sequence checkbox. The new sequence will have .Transcoded added 
to the end of the name.
14.	 You now have two sets of Master Clips: those at higher resolution and those at a 
lower resolution (the Transcoded clips). At this point, you will want to delete the higher 
resolution media. Before you do this, I highly suggest locking the Transcoded clips 
and media to make them difficult to delete by mistake. To do this, follow these steps:
15.	Make a new bin. Name it something like Lock All This Stuff.
16.	 Duplicate the Transcoded sequence.
17.	 Place the duplicated sequence into the Lock All This Stuff bin.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6
197
18.	Select the Lock All This Stuff bin to make it active.
19.	Go to Bin menu | Set Bin Display…..
20.	Enable these two checkboxes: Rendered Effects and Show Reference Clips.
21.	 Click OK. In the Lock All This Stuff bin, you will now see all the 
Master Clips and render files (also known as Precomputes) that are linked to the 
sequence. In other words, these are the elements that make that sequence play.
22.	Select everything in the bin (cmd/Ctrl + A).
23.	Go to Clip menu | Lock Bin Selection. This will lock the clips and media in order to 
make them difficult to delete.
24.	 You can choose to display the Lock column to see what elements are locked or 
unlocked. To do this, begin by setting the bin to Text View. Then, go to Bin menu | 
Choose Columns. The Choose Columns dialog window opens. Select Lock and  
then click OK.
25.	Since you are clearing hard drive space of unneeded media (the higher resolution 
media), you would then delete it. You may want to review the later sections in this 
chapter on using the Media Tool and methods of deleting media.
Transcoding Sequences of mixed SD  
and HD video
Before Consolidating, Transcoding, or Decomposing sequences, I recommend that you 
perform a small test of the process, using unimportant clips to familiarize yourself with the 
workflow, additional options, and final results.
Before you Consolidate (or Transcode, or Decompose), a sequence I highly recommend that 
you make a duplicate of it and place it in its own well-labeled bin (for example, My Movie 
Before Transcode). This extra version is a protection in case you make an error, and will 
help to keep your project organized.
When you have a sequence of mixed Standard Definition (SD) video and High Definition (HD) 
video, you need the sequence to be a consistent format throughout in order to output it. In 
other words, it must be entirely SD or entirely HD.
What does Transcoding a sequence do? A discussion of this, along with some important  
notes, can be found in the introduction of the previous Transcoding sequences for archiving  
or before up-res recipe.

Getting ready…
Note that Transcoding only changes the video format and/or resolution of the media. It does 
not alter the aspect ratio.
f
f
When you are in an SD project with an aspect ratio of 4 x 3 (also know as 1.33:1), 
and outputting to SD at the same aspect ratio, then you'll most likely want to adjust 
any segments (shots) that are 16 x 9 (also known as 1.77:1), so that they will display 
in the proper aspect ratio. One method to accomplish this is to use a Reformat effect: 
Tools menu | Effect Palette | Reformat category | 16:9 Letterbox. Place this effect 
on each segment that should display as 16 x 9.
f
f
When you are in a HD project, or an SD project that has an aspect ratio of 16 x 9 
(1.77:1), and outputting to the 16 x 9 aspect ratio, generally you want to adjust the 
segments that are 4 x 3 (1.33:1) in order to have them display in the correct aspect 
ratio. One way to do this is to apply a Reformat effect: Tools menu | Effect Palette | 
Reformat category | 4:3 Sidebar.
How to do it...
1.	 Create a new bin. This new bin will be the place where you put a duplicate of the 
sequence you will create in step 2 (which will eventually be Transcoded). Duplicating 
the sequence and placing it in this bin protects the original and provides an extra 
back-up version that will not only help you in case you make an error but also will help 
to keep your project organized for future reference. Label the bin along the lines of 
My Movie Transcoded for Output on [insert date].
2.	 Create the duplicate of the mixed SD/HD sequence. Select the sequence, then go to 
Edit menu | Duplicate.
3.	 Place the duplicated sequence into the bin from step 1.
4.	 This is an optional step: For an additional layer of protection, close all other bins 
except the bin you created in step 1. This will ensure you don't mistakenly Transcode 
the wrong sequence when you're tired or distracted.
5.	 First, determine the resolutions of the media in that sequence:
i.	
Select the My Movie Transcoded for Output bin to make it active.
ii.	
Go to Bin menu | Set Bin Display....

iii.	 Enable these two checkboxes:


Rendered Effects


Show Reference Clips
iv.	 Click OK. In the My Movie Transcoded for Output bin, you will now see 
all the Master Clips and render files (also known as Precomputes) that 
are linked to the sequence. In other words, these are the elements that 
make that sequence play.
v.	
Now you'll determine the resolution of those clips. Go to Bin menu | 
Choose Columns | select Video | Click OK.
vi.	 Make note of the resolutions of the SD clips and the HD clips.
vii.	 Now that you've noted the resolutions, hide the Reference Clips by going 
to Bin menu | Set Bin Display.... Then, de-select the Rendered Effects 
and Show Reference Clips checkboxes and click OK.
6.	 Next you'll set the format (SD or HD) of the Transcoded clips that you will be creating. 
Go to Project Window | Format tab.
7.	
In the Format tab, select the Project Type and Aspect Ratio you are outputting to 
(SD or HD). Avid states, "New clips created through the Transcode operation are in 
the project format. When you transcode a clip across formats, for example, if you 
transcode a 16:9 clip in a 4:3 project, the Reformat bin setting determines how the 
clip is conformed to the new format". For details on the Reformat option, see the 
Getting the AMA file's image to display as desired recipe in Chapter 1, Getting Assets 
into Your Media Composer Project (this applies to non-AMA linked files as well).
8.	 Next, you'll ensure that the highest quality Transcode process is used:
i.	
Go to Project Window | Settings tab | Render Settings.
ii.	
The Render Settings dialog window opens.
iii.	 You will see the heading labeled as Image Interpolation.
iv.	 From the Image Interpolation pull-down menu, select Advanced 
(Polyphase).
v.	
Click OK.
9.	 Select the duplicated sequence you placed into the new bin from step 1.

10.	 Go to Clip menu | Consolidate/Transcode.
11.	 In the Consolidate/Transcode dialog window, select the following:
i.	
In the upper left-hand corner, select Transcode.
ii.	
Under the heading Target Drives, enable the checkbox for Video, audio 
and data on same drive (it will most likely be enabled by default).
iii.	 In the Video/Data list box, select the destination drive/partition you 
want to place the new media files onto.
iv.	 In the Handle length entry box, enter a value. This will instruct Media 
Composer to make new Transcoded Master Clips that are longer than 
the original segments (shots) in the sequence. For example, you have a 
segment that is 10 seconds long. You enter a duration of 60 frames for 
the handle. This will add 60 frames to the head (beginning) of the new 
Master Clip as well as 60 frames to the tail of the new Master Clip. So, 
in a 30-fps project, the total duration of the new Master Clip will be 14 
seconds. Adding handle ensures that you have some additional material 
at the head and tail, just in case you need to later trim a segment longer 
or add a transition effect (for example, a dissolve).
v.	
Be sure to enable/check the box for Create new Sequence (note that 
some previous versions of Media Composer do not have this selection). 
Even though you manually created a duplicate earlier, this is yet one 
more layer of protection for you.
vi.	 Enable/check the box for Convert Video.
vii.	 Target Video Resolution menu: Select the resolution you want to 
Transcode the mismatched files to. For example, in an example 
sequence, the SD clips are at 1:1 while my HD clips are at DNxHD 220:


If I want to Transcode the SD to HD then, in this example, I would 
select DNxHD 220.


If I want to Transcode the HD to SD then, in this example, I would 
verify that the project type (Project Window | Format tab) was set to 
SD and I would select 1:1.
viii.	 Include reformatted clips already at target resolution checkbox – Avid 
states, "Select this option if you want to include Reformatted clips in 
the sequence that are already at the target video resolution. Your Avid 
editing application does not normally Transcode clips in a sequence  
that are already at the target video resolution. However, you might  
want to include Reformatted clips at the target resolution to preserve  
the Reformatting."

12.	Convert Audio Sample Rate checkbox and menu – this next step is optional, and I'll 
explain the results:


Not selecting this checkbox – this produces new Master Clips and media 
for each segment (shot) in the sequence. However, they will be video only 
Master Clips. The audio will still play in the sequence because the audio is 
supplied by the original Master Clips and media. The possible problem with 
this is that if you ever needed to Match Frame back to one of the Master 
Clips, the clip loaded into your Source Window would be either Video Only  
or Audio Only.


Selecting this checkbox – if you want/need to have the new Master Clips 
include both the video and audio that originally came from the same clip and 
which were cut into the sequence together (for example, an actor speaking 
dialog), then you must select this checkbox. Even if you select the existing 
Sample Rate of the audio, it will still work. However, this will not affect other 
audio in the sequence (for example, music, sound effects, or dialog edited 
into the sequence without the video that was originally paired with it). For 
emphasis, new Master Clips for these type of audio elements (music,  
sound effects, and so on.) will not be created. The audio will still play in  
the sequence because the audio is supplied by the original Master Clips  
and media.
13.	In the bottom right-hand corner of the dialog window, click the Transcode button to 
begin the process.
14.	 Depending on the number of files, and the size of those files, this process 
may take some time. When the process is completed:


All the newly created .new Master Clips will be at the top of the bin.


You will have two sequences in the bin. One of them is the mixed format 
sequence that continues to link to the original SD and HD Master Clips and 
media. The new sequence was created by Media Composer because you 
enabled the Create new Sequence checkbox. The new Sequence will have 
.Transcoded added to the end of the name. This is the sequence that is 
now at one consistent format.
Changing the Sample Rate of clips in a bin 
before editing them into your Sequence
When you have audio with a Sample Rate that differs from what is set in the Audio Project 
settings (Project Window | Settings tab| Audio Project), Media Composer will actually allow 
it to be played. How great, you say. Well, it's great until you have to output your sequence to 
tape. When you output to a tape, the Sample Rate of all the audio elements must be the same  
(just in the same way that the video has to be all SD or all HD).

If you have imported audio at a Sample Rate that does not match the Sample Rate set for 
your project, this recipe will show you how to change the Sample Rate of clips in a bin before 
editing them into your sequence. It is advisable to correct the Sample Rate before editing 
clips into your sequence rather than after. If you have already edited mismatched audio into 
your sequence, then you will want to refer to the recipe that follows this one which is titled, 
Changing the mismatched audio that has been edited into your sequence.
Getting ready
It will be helpful to see the sample rate of a clip's audio in the bin:
1.	 Place the bin into Text View.
2.	 Go to Bin menu | Choose Columns | select Audio SR | Click OK.
Here are two things that may be helpful in the Audio Project settings located at: Project 
Window | Settings tab | Audio Project.
f
f
If you are not already aware, check the Project Sample Rate. The Project Sample Rate 
will appear in the top right-hand side of the dialog window. The default setting is 48 
kHz (frequently abbreviated as 48K).
f
f
Make sure that you can see which segments (shots) in your sequence are not at 
the sample rate of your project. There is a selection that reads Show Mismatched 
Sample Rates as Different Color. This should be set to Yes. More on this is next.
To see the segments in the sequence with mismatched sample rates, do one or both  
of the following:
f
f
Display the Audio Waveform in the Timeline Window. One method to do this is: 
Timeline Window Fast Menu (hamburger) in the bottom left-hand corner of the 
Timeline Window | Audio Data | Waveform (note that previous releases referred to 
this as Sample Plot). Audio that is the same as the Project Sample Rate will display 
the waveforms as black. Audio that is not at the Project Sample Rate will display the 
waveforms as light gray.
f
f
Display text that reveals the Sample Rate of the audio. To do this: Timeline Window 
Fast Menu (hamburger) in the bottom left-hand corner of Timeline Window | Clip 
Text | Clip Resolutions.
f
f
You may need to make the audio tracks wider to better/easier see the waveforms 
and/or the Sample Rate text. One method to do this: enable the tracks, then use 
cmd/Ctrl + L to make the track(s) wider, and cmd/Ctrl + K to make them narrower.

How to do it...
1.	 Select the clip(s) in the bin.
2.	 Go to Clip menu | Change Sample Rate.
3.	 The Change Sample Rate dialog window opens.
4.	 From the Sample Rate pull-down menu, select the Sample Rate to convert  
the clip(s) into.
5.	 Set the Quality to High.
6.	 Delete Original Media checkbox:
f
f
If unselected (not checked):


This will create a new Audio Only Master Clip linked to its own media  
(at the new Sample Rate).


If there is video with the Master Clip, then the video and new audio  
will be in separate Master Clips.


The new clip will have .new added to the end of its name.


If you have edited the original (incorrect Sample Rate) clip into the sequence, 
the instance(s) of it in the sequence will not be changed. You would need to 
manually re-edit the .new clip into the sequence where and as required.
f
f
If selected (checked):


New audio media will be created at the new Sample Rate and the old media 
(at the incorrect sample rate) will then be deleted. Media Composer will 
then link the Master Clip to the new audio media. If there is video with 
the Master Clip, then this will keep the video and audio together in one, 
single Master Clip. Further, if you have edited the clip into the sequence, 
the instance(s) in the sequence will also be changed because the sequence 
links to the Master Clip, which in turn links to the new media.
There's more...
In the Audio Project settings (Project Window | Settings tab | Audio Project) you will 
also see a menu for Audio File Format. The default setting is PCM, which will create a 
.mxf file, which will exist in the same folder as the video. On the other hand, the alternate 
selections of AIFF-C and WAVE create .omf files, which will reside in a separate folder (OMFI 
MediaFiles) from the .mxf media.

Changing the mismatched audio that has 
been edited into your Sequence
It is best if you can change the sample rate of mismatched clips before you edit them into  
your sequence, as covered in the previous recipe. However, if you weren't able to do that,  
the solution is given in the following sections.
Getting ready
Please refer to the Getting ready section of the previous Changing the sample rate of clips  
in a bin before editing them into your sequence recipe.
How to do it...
1.	 Create a new bin. This new bin will be the place where you put a duplicate of the 
sequence you will create in step 2 (which will eventually have the mismatched audio 
clips converted). Duplicating the sequence and placing it in this bin protects the 
original and provides an extra back-up version that will not only help you in case you 
make an error but also will help to keep your project organized for future reference. 
Label the bin along the lines of My Movie With Sample Rate Converted for Output 
on [insert date].
2.	 Create the duplicate of the mixed sample rate sequence: Select the sequence, then 
go to Edit menu | Duplicate.
3.	 Place the duplicated sequence into the bin from step 1.
4.	 This step is optional. For an additional layer of protection, close all other bins except 
the bin you created in step 1. This will ensure you don't mistakenly convert the wrong 
sequence when you're tired or distracted.
5.	 Select the duplicated sequence.
6.	 Go to Clip menu | Change Sample Rate….
7.	
The Change Sample Rate dialog window opens.
8.	 From the Sample Rate pull-down menu, select the sample rate you need to convert 
the mismatched clip(s) into.
9.	 Set the Quality to High.
10.	 Delete original media checkbox – in both cases detailed in steps 11 and 12, Media 
Composer creates new Audio Only Master Clips in their entirety. In other words, it 
does not create the Master Clip(s) only for the duration that is used in the sequence. 
For example, you have a song that is 3 minutes long. You edited only 20 seconds of 
that song into your sequence. Media Composer will create the new Master Clip for 
the full 3 minute duration of the song.

11.	 If the Delete original media checkbox is unselected:


This will create new Audio Only Master Clips linked to their own media  
(at the new sample rate)


If there is video with the original Master Clip, then the video and new audio 
will now be in separate Master Clips


The new clips will have .new added to the end of their names


The result – the original sequence remains linked to mismatched Sample 
Rate clips (which are still online and will play), while the new/converted 
sequence links to the new clips at the converted Sample Rate
12.	If the Delete original media checkbox is selected:


This is important: Choosing this with a sequence selected will delete the 
mismatched audio from the original Master Clips. This would make the 
video and audio (that previously were married together in one clip) into 
separate Master Clips. This is very likely undesirable, especially if you  
need to continue to edit. Instead, you would most likely want to select  
this only when changing the Sample Rate of the clips in the bin. See the 
previous Changing the sample rate of clips in a bin before or after editing 
them into your sequence recipe.


This will create new Audio Only Master Clips linked to their own media  
(at the new sample rate).


The old media (at the incorrect sample rate) will be deleted.


The new clips will have .new added to the end of their names.


The result – the original sequence remains linked to mismatched Sample 
Rate clips (which are now offline and will not play), while the new/converted 
sequence links to the new Audio Only clips at the converted Sample Rate.
How it works...
Remember that this creates new audio-only Master Clips that are at the converted Sample 
Rate. This affects what clips the sequence is linking to, and is why it is important to make a 
duplicate of the sequence as discussed in the previous step numbers 1 and 2.

Prevent editing with audio that does not 
match the Project's Sample Rate
While mixing clips with different audio Sample Rates is generally infrequent, it can occur  
(for example, when borrowing a clip from another project). This recipe will alert you to this 
issue before you've edited a mismatched clip into your sequence.
How to do it...
1.	 Go to Project Window | Settings tab | Double-click the Audio Project settings.
2.	 The Audio Project settings dialog window will open.
3.	 Set Convert Sample Rates When Playing to Never.
4.	 Close the Audio Project settings dialog window.
How it works...
By default, Media Composer is set to play audio that is not at the Project Sample Rate (Project 
Window | Settings tab | Audio Project | Convert Sample Rates When Playing | Always). By 
turning this feature off, if/when you load a clip into your Source Window with a mismatched 
sample rate, then you will not be able to hear the audio play. That's a pretty good sign that 
something is not as it should be. This will cause you to investigate to see if the audio is either 
Offline or at the incorrect Sample Rate. This way you can catch it and change the Sample 
Rate before editing it into your sequence (discussed earlier in this chapter in the recipe titled 
Changing the sample rate of clips in a bin before editing them into your sequence).
Setting the Media Tool display
In this recipe, we'll discuss opening the Media Tool and determining what gets displayed in 
the Media Tool window, and how it is displayed.
In the sections that follow this one, we'll discuss using the Media Tool for various tasks (for 
example, deleting unused media, deleting media for specific tracks of a clip, moving media 
from one drive to another, and so on.)
How to do it...
1.	 To open the Media Tool display dialog, go to Tools menu | Media Tool.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 6
207
2.	 The Media Tool display dialog window opens. Let's discuss each section:


Media drive(s) display region: This displays all the drives and/or partitions 
that Media Composer can see. You tell Media Composer to look at specific 
drives by using Shift+Click method, or you can quickly tell it to look at all the 
drives by clicking the All Drives button.


Project(s) display region: Every time you create media files by capturing 
from tape, importing, rendering, Consolidating, or Transcoding, they become 
associated with the project that was open when they were created. In other 
words, they get a stamp on them that says I belong to 'Project X. In this 
way, you can have media from many different projects together in the same 
Avid MediaFiles (or OMFI MediaFiles) folder and still be able to deal 
with them individually when needed. You can tell Media Composer to look 
at specific projects' media by using Shift+Click method; or to tell it to look at 
only the media that is associated with the currently open project by clicking 
the Current Project button; or to tell it to look at all the different projects' 
media by clicking the All Projects button.
3.	 Now let's talk about the three checkboxes. However, let's talk about them in  
reverse order:


Media Files: This will display all the types of media no matter how it was 
created (captured, imported, rendered, and so on), and it will display each 
individual media file just as it exists in your Avid MediaFiles (or OMFI 
MediaFiles) folder. This means that the names of the files are those 
created by Media Composer, and generally consist of numbers and letters 
that only make sense to a computer. So, this display may not be the most 
helpful or the one you'll use most often. To further illuminate how Media 
Composer works, it's helpful to know that one Master Clip can (and often 
does) link to (refer to) more than one media file. For example, in my bin, I 
have a Master Clip of an actor speaking with one video track and two audio 
tracks. That means that one Master Clip links to three separate media files: 
one video file, and two audio files. For emphasis, this selection will display 
each individual media file.


Precompute Clips: This is Avid's term for what we've come to simply call 
Render files. In Media Composer, Precomputes are created whenever you 
render an effect, create a motion effect, or create a title.


Master Clips: This places your media into a display that's easier for you 
to deal with. For emphasis, this is media displayed as Master Clips. This 
displays clips created by capturing, importing, consolidating, or transcoding.

4.	 Once you have configured the Media Tool display dialog window as you need, then 
click OK.
5.	 The Media Tool window will open. It looks and behaves just like a bin.
6.	 You can adjust what is displayed in the Media Tool window by first going to the  
Media Tool Fast Menu (hamburger-looking) in the bottom left side of the window. 
Then, from the menu, select Set Media Display, which will open the Media Tool 
display dialog window.
How it works... 
The way Media Composer works with managed media files (meaning files not linked by AMA) is 
that it places them in a specific folder called Avid MediaFiles and/or OMFI MediaFiles. 
That means that media from multiple projects may be all mixed together. Along with the media 
files are two database files. The two files are labeled msmFMID.pmr and msmMMOB.mdb. The 
msm refers to a component of the Media Composer application called Media Stream Manager. 
These two files are a crucial component for Media Composer to keep track of media files and 
to keep media linked to clips and sequences.
Advantages of the Media Tool:
f
f
Because the Media Tool works just like a bin, you can Sort and Sift media based  
on criteria, such as what drive it's located on, what resolution it is, its Sample Rate,  
its creation date, what Project it is associated with, and so on.
f
f
You can move media from one drive to another, using the Consolidate function  
(see later in this chapter).
f
f
You can delete specific file types. For example, if you wanted to delete only the A3 
and A4 media files from a clip, you can do this when using the Media Tool (see later).
f
f
You can locate all the media files associated with a particular project without having 
to go bin by bin in your project. This makes it easier to delete or move all the media at 
the conclusion of a project and avoid leaving extraneous, useless media files taking 
up space on your drives, as often happens with Precompute files (Render files).
f
f
You can also use the Media tool to borrow a clip from another project (see later in 
this chapter).
Borrowing a clip from another Project
There will be times when you want to use clips that are already in use by another project  
(for example, music, graphics, and so on). This recipe will take you through that process.

How to do it…
Please review items 1, 2, and 3 in the Introduction section of this chapter.
1.	 Open the Media Tool and go to Tools menu | Media Tool.
2.	 Configure the Media Tool to display only Master Clips from the Project(s) you want to 
borrow from. This topic is discussed in more detail in the previous Setting the Media 
tool display recipe.
3.	 Simply drag a Master Clip(s) from the Media Tool window into any open bin. There is 
no need to hold down any keys on the keyboard. Media Composer will automatically 
create a Clone of the clip (the difference between a Duplicated clip and a Cloned clip 
is discussed in the Mixing frame rates in Chapter 1, Getting Assets into Your Media 
Composer Project, in the There's more... section).
4.	 If you need to make a copy of the media so that it will be permanently associated with 
your project, rather than the project from which it was borrowed, then see the Copying 
a borrowed clip's media recipe, earlier in this chapter.
How to determine where media files are 
stored and how to move them
Before you Consolidate or Transcode clips, I highly recommend that you perform a test of 
the process with some unimportant clips to familiarize yourself with the workflow, additional 
options, and final results.
Please note that the topics covered, and recipes of steps provided, are geared toward those 
using local media drives for storage, for example, the internal hard drive, fixed hard drive(s), 
and/or a relatively small, local RAID. Note that those working at a facility with Avid Unity, Avid 
ISIS, Avid Interplay, or another shared storage solution must consult with their facility's technical 
administrators or lead assistant editors before carrying out any media management functions in 
a shared storage environment. Failing to do so can cause inadvertent loss of media.
Getting ready
In this example situation, the Media Tool window is already open and you have configured  
it to display the following (details on this can be found earlier in the Setting the Media tool 
display recipe):

The steps in the recipe will be using the Sort feature, and Sifting will be covered in the  
There's more... section. Before you can use the Sort and Sift features, you need to display  
the column(s) of information you need, for example, Clip name, Tape name (source), Video 
(video resolution), Drive location, Sample Rate, Creation date, and so on. To do this, follow 
these steps:
1.	 With the Media Tool window active, go to Bin menu | Choose Columns.
2.	 In the Choose Columns dialog window, select one or more columns of information 
that you need. In this example situation, your goal is to move media files from one 
drive onto another because you have mistakenly placed some clips onto a drive 
named Cat and they need to be moved off of that drive and onto a drive named  
Dog. So, displaying the Drive column will be helpful.
3.	 Click OK.
How to do it...
Now that you have prepared by following the Getting ready section, you can now Sort any 
column that is displayed (the There's more... section will cover Sifting). Sorting places data  
in a column in alpha-numeric order. In this example, we will display the Drive column.
1.	 In the Media Tool window, select the Column Header at very top of the column, so 
that the column becomes highlighted (for example, select where it says Drive, Video, 
Creation Date, and so on).
2.	 Right-click on the Column Header.
3.	 From the menu that appears, select either Sort Ascending or Sort 
Descending.
4.	 Once Sorted, it will be easier to select only the clips you want.
There's more...
Below are the steps to use the Sift feature as well as a discussion of another use of the Sort 
and Sift features. 
Using the Sift feature
Sifting allows you to isolate the display to only what you need to see. This is accomplished by 
telling Media Composer to display only the clips that match a specific attribute (or criteria), 
such as Clip name, Source name, Video resolution, Drive location, Sample Rate, Creation 
date, and so on.
1.	 With the Media Tool window set as discussed in the Getting ready section, go to  
Bin menu | Custom Sift….
2.	 The Custom Sift dialog window opens.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 6
211
3.	 You will now tell Media Composer to restrict the display to only the clips that meet the 
attributes/criteria that you dictate:


Criterion menu: Choose from Contains, Begins With, or Matches exactly.


Text to Find: Type in the word or number to look for (for example, drive name, 
video resolution, and so on).


Column or Range to Search menu: Only the columns that are currently 
displayed will appear in the list. Select a specific column in order to make 
Media Composer pay attention only to that column.
4.	 In this example, I have mistakenly placed some clips onto a drive called Cat, so in 
the Custom Sift dialog window, I do the following: I select Contains, I type in the word 
cat, and I select the Drive column.
5.	 Click the Apply button to see if the Sift criteria produces the results you expect/need. 
If not, then you can update the criteria and again press Apply.
6.	 If the display is as you need it to be, then click OK.
7.	
Note that the name of the Media Tool window has changed. It now includes the word 
Sifted in parentheses. This reminds you that you are not seeing all of the clips in the 
Media Tool. To return to seeing everything, go to Bin menu | Show Unsifted.
8.	 Scroll through the Media Tool window and verify that the display is indeed including 
only the clips you are concerned with.
9.	 Now that the display is restricted to only the media files (both Master Clips and 
Precomputes) that are on the incorrect drive (in this example, the Cat drive), you can 
select all of them (cmd/Ctrl + A) and Consolidate them. See the Moving media files 
recipe for the steps to use the Consolidate function to move the media file(s) from 
one drive to another.
Isolating video of a specific resolution
First, some background/context for you. It is common when working on large projects to 
bring the video into the system at a low resolution (to save drive space and/or to make it 
easier on the computer to play the media). Then, once the creative process is completed, 
the low resolution media is deleted and only the portions of media used by the sequence are 
recaptured at a higher resolution (for example, 1:1) and all the effects are re-rendered at the 
higher resolution as well.
Just as common, is bringing in some video at low resolution and some video at the finishing 
resolution. For example, I might capture 100 hours of documentary footage at low resolution 
(20:1), but import all my graphic elements (stills and animations) at 1:1. This way, when I 
reach the finishing stage of the project, all the graphic elements are already at high resolution 
and set to go. In this instance, I would only want to delete the video at the low resolution 
(20:1) to clear drive space to accommodate the high resolution media that I'll be capturing in 
the near future.

You can now see that using the Sort and/or Sift features would prove useful in the situation 
just described because you are able to utilize the Video column that displays the video 
resolution of the clips in your Project.
Deleting specific media files from clips  
(for example, just the A3 and A4 files)
Please review points 1, 2, and 3 in the Introduction section of this chapter.
Here's an example situation to put the steps in context:
f
f
You have ingested several long clips that contain a video track and four audio tracks 
(A1, A2, A3, and A4)
f
f
You realize that the audio on tracks A3 and A4 of each clip is unusable due to poor 
quality or is simply silent
Here is an overview of the goals in this example:
f
f
First, delete the audio files only for tracks A3 and A4.
f
f
Second, modify the Master Clips so that they do not link to (refer to) media that 
is now Offline. Modifying the Master Clips after deleting the media is to avoid 
confusion. If you (or the editor you're working for) play a clip that has A3 and A4 
tracks, but can't hear anything on those tracks, you would wonder if something is 
wrong (for example, media not captured, media corrupted, media mistakenly deleted, 
and so on), and possibly waste time dealing with a non-existent issue.
How to do it…
1.	 Close all bins except the bin containing the clips whose A3 and A4 media you  
want to delete.
2.	 Set the bin to Text View.
3.	 Go to Bin menu | Choose Columns.
4.	 The Choose Columns dialog window opens.
5.	 Select Offline and Tracks.
6.	 Click OK, then make sure you can see the Offline and Tracks columns in 
your bin.
7.	
Open the Media Tool display dialog window by going to Tools menu | Media Tool.
8.	 The Media Tool display dialog window opens.
9.	 Configure the Media Tool to display only Master Clips from the Current Project.  
This topic is discussed in the earlier Setting the Media tool display recipe,  
in this chapter.

10.	 The next steps assume that:


The bin with the clips to be modified is open; and the Offline and Tracks 
Columns are displayed and easily visible


The Media Tool window is open, displaying the media as Master Clips
11.	 In the next steps, you will locate the specific clips within the Media Tool window 
whose A3 and A4 media files will be deleted.
12.	In the bin, select the clips to be modified.
13.	Go to Bin menu | Select Media Relatives. This will locate and select the clips in the 
Media Tool display window.
14.	 Very carefully, click on the heading of the Media Tool window. You don't want to 
mistakenly click inside the Media Tool window and change the selections that have 
been made. Look in the Media Tool window. You'll see that the clips are selected  
(you may need to scroll up or down in the window to locate the highlighted clips).
15.	With the Media Tool window active, and the clips selected, press Delete.
16.	 The Delete Media dialog window opens.
17.	 Here you can select which specific media files to delete. In this example, I 
want only the checkboxes for A3 and A4 to be selected. For emphasis, tracks V1, A1, 
and A2 should not be selected.
18.	Stop and verify that you have selected the correct tracks' media to delete. In this 
example, the only two checkboxes that should be selected are for A3 and A4.  
Click OK.
19.	A verification dialog window will open. If you are sure that you do indeed want to 
delete the media files you indicated, then click on the Delete button.
20.	Close the Media Tool window.
21.	 Look at the clips in the bin. Look in the Offline column. Notice that the media is 
Offline for the A3 and A4 media you just deleted. Look in the Tracks column.  
Notice that the clips still refer to all the tracks, even though the media has been 
deleted. The next set of steps will take you through the clip modification process. 
Before we go through the steps, here's an overview of what you're going to do.  
First, you will Unlink the clips from the remaining media. Then you will use the  
Modify feature on the Master Clips to remove the unneeded tracks (in this  
example, tracks A3 and A4). And the last thing you'll do is Relink the Master  
Clips back to the remaining media. Now let's do all of that step by step.
22.	First, you will Unlink the clips. Start by selecting the clips you want to modify. Then, 
hold down the Shift + cmd keys (Mac) or the Shift + Ctrl keys (PC). While holding 
down the keys go to Clip menu | Unlink (if you don't hold down the correct keys, 
then the Unlink command will not appear and will instead read as Relink). Unlinking 
the clips from the media will cause them to become Offline. But because they are 
unlinked, they can now be modified.

23.	The clips you're modifying should still be selected in the bin. If for any reason they are 
not, then re-select them.
24.	 Go to Clip menu | Modify....
25.	The Modify dialog window will open.
26.	From the pull-down menu at the top of the Modify dialog window select Set 
Tracks.
27.	 Select the checkboxes only for the tracks whose media still exists. In this example, 
the selected checkboxes would be V1, A1, and A2. For emphasis, in this example, 
tracks A3 through A16 and D are not selected.
28.	Click OK. The clips have now been modified. All that's left is to Relink the clips to the 
remaining media files. The next steps will take you through that process.
29.	The clips you're modifying should still be selected in the bin. If for any reason they are 
not, then re-select them.
30.	Go to Clip menu| Relink.
31.	 The Relink dialog window will open. Configure as necessary, though the default 
setting will generally be fine. Once configured, click OK. More information on 
Relinking is available in the Media Composer Help.
32.	The clips relink and now link to (refer to) only the media that remains Online.
Deleting unused media files: Just Master 
Clips, just Precomputes, or both
Throughout the editing process, we create a good deal of media files by capturing off of 
tape, importing files, Consolidating, or Transcoding files linked by AMA, and of course by 
rendering effects. It is likely that you will want to determine what media is being used by your 
sequence(s) and what is not, so that you can delete it. This will not only free up drive space 
but also in some instances may even improve the performance of the system because the 
Media Composer software will have fewer media files to keep track of.
Deleting unused Precomputes is something you may want to do every few weeks. Deleting 
unused clips is generally something you'd do in the very late stages of a project in order to 
make room on the drives for some new footage that has arrived.
When deleting media, slow down, take your time, think things through, eliminate distractions, 
and don't do it when you're tired.

Getting ready
Before you dive into all the steps, I think it will be helpful to have a general overview of what is 
going to happen:
f
f
Create duplicates: You'll place duplicates of all sequences and clips that link to (refer 
to) media that you do want to keep (in other words, the items that link to media you 
do not want to delete) into one common bin.
f
f
Locking: As an additional layer of protection, before deleting unused media from a 
project, it is advisable to lock all critical and any as yet unused clips/media files that 
you feel you might want to use in the future. So, with all the sequences and clips 
that link to media that you want to keep all in one common bin, you will go through a 
locking process where you'll use the Media Tool and tell Media Composer to select 
this media and then lock it.
f
f
Deleting: With all the sequences and clips that link to media that you want to keep all 
in one common bin, you will go through a multi-step deleting process where you'll use 
the Media Tool and tell Media Composer to select the media that is not being linked 
to by these sequences and clips (in other words, the media that is not being used by 
those specific sequences and clips), and then delete it.
How to do it…
Be very careful. The process detailed in the recipe will have you reference only specific 
sequences and clips in your project. This means that, in the end, all media files that are not 
referenced by (also known as linked to) these specific sequences and clips will be deleted.
1.	 Create a new bin. Name the bin along the lines of Media Not To Delete. This will be 
where you're going to place duplicates of:


Any sequence that links to (refers to) media that you want to keep. This 
includes any other versions of a sequence that may link to different clips 
and/or Precomputes (renders).


Clips you haven't used in the sequence yet, but want to protect from being 
deleted. Examples of these would be music, sound effects, voiceover, 
alternate performances, and any other clips you haven't edited into your 
sequence yet, but feel you might want to use in the future.
2.	 Go though each and every bin in your project and examine the Master Clips.
3.	 For each clip you haven't yet used in a sequence, but want to keep for future  
use, you will do the following: select the clip(s). Then go to Edit menu | Duplicate.  
Place the duplicate clips into the Media Not To Delete bin you created in step 1.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Managing Your Media Files
216
4.	 Go through each and every sequence bin in your project and examine the sequences. 
Determine if any of them are using media that should be saved (not deleted). These 
might be previous versions and/or alternate versions of your movie.
5.	 For each and every sequence whose media you want to save, you will do the 
following: select the sequence(s). Then go to Edit menu | Duplicate. Place the 
duplicate sequences into the Media Not To Delete bin you created in step 1.
6.	 Now you should have duplicates of all the clips and sequences that link to media 
that you want to keep in one common bin which you named along the lines of Media 
Not To Delete. The next thing you'll do is a few steps to lock the media that the clips 
link to, and then you'll go through some more steps to lock all the media that the 
sequence(s) link to (which will include Precomputes).
7.	
Now you will lock all the clips (you can display the Lock column to see what elements 
are locked or unlocked). Start by selecting all the clips and sequences in the 
Media Not To Delete bin (Edit menu | Select All). Next go to Clip menu | Lock Bin 
Selection. Note that for clips, this locks both the clips and the media files they link to. 
However, for sequences, it locks only the sequence, but not the media it links to. We'll 
do that in the next set of steps, using the Media Tool.
8.	 Keep the Media Not To Delete bin open, but close all other bins. This will 
help to avoid confusion.
9.	 Open the Media Tool dialog window by going to Tools Menu | Media Tool.
10.	 Set the Media Tool to display:


Media from all drives


Media only for your Current Project


The goal here is to lock and protect both Precompute media files and Master 
Clip media files at the same time, so select both of these checkboxes


See the Setting the Media tool display recipe for addition details, if you need 
them


Click OK to open the Media Tool window
11.	 You may find it helpful to place the Media Not To Delete bin on one computer monitor 
and the Media Tool window on the other.
12.	Now you'll lock just the media that is being referenced by the clips and sequences in 
your Media Not To Delete bin. To do this, follow the next steps.
13.	In the Media Not To Delete bin, select everything. You can do this by going to Edit 
menu | Select All.
14.	 With everything selected, you'll now ask Media Composer to select all the  
media files in the Media Tool that link to (refer to) the selected clips and  
sequences in the Media Not To Delete bin.

217
15.	With the clips and sequences in the Media Not To Delete bin still selected, and with 
the Media Not To Delete bin being the active bin, go to the Media Not To Delete 
bin's Fast Menu (hamburger) in the bottom left-hand corner. From the Fast Menu, 
choose the option that reads Select Media Relatives. The result is that all the media 
files that are linked to those sequences and clips will become selected in the Media 
Tool window.
16.	 The next goal is to lock all the selected media files in the Media Tool window. To 
do this, select the very top of the Media Tool window (where the name Media Tool 
appears), making sure you don't mistakenly click inside the Media Tool window and 
mistakenly deselect the highlighted media. Next; with the Media Tool window now 
active, and all the media files still selected, go to Clip menu | Lock Bin Selection. 
The result is that all of your selected media is now locked. If you try to delete it, Media 
Composer will tell you that it's locked with the message, Locked selections can't  
be deleted.
17.	 Close the Media Tool window so that we can reset the display in order to begin  
the deleting phase.
18.	Open the Media Tool dialog window: Tools menu | Media Tool.
19.	Set the Media Tool to display:


Media from all drives or specific drives, depending on your situation  
and needs


Media only for your Current Project
20.	Now decide what you want to delete:


If you want to delete only unused Precompute media files (renders), then 
select only the checkbox for Precompute Files


If you want to delete only unused Master Clip media files (for example, 
captured clips, imported clips, Consolidated clips, Transcoded clips), then 
select only the checkbox for Master Clips


If you want to delete both Precompute media files and Master Clip media 
files at the same time, in one step, then select both checkboxes


See the Setting the Media Tool display recipe that is earlier in this chapter for 
addition details, if you need them


Click OK to open the Media Tool window
21.	 You may find it helpful to place the Media Not To Delete bin on one computer monitor 
and the Media Tool window on the other.
22.	Now you'll go through some steps (23 through 26) to select the media that's not 
being referenced by the clips and sequences in your Media Not To Delete bin.
23.	In the Media Not To Delete bin, select everything. You can do this by going  
to Edit menu | Select All.
www.it-ebooks.info

Managing Your Media Files
218
24.	 With everything selected, then in step 25 you will ask Media Composer to select all 
the media files in the Media Tool window that do link to (refer to), and are being used 
by, the selected clips and sequences in the Media Not To Delete bin.
25.	With the clips and sequences in the Media Not To Delete bin still selected, and with 
the Media Not To Delete bin being the active bin. Go to the Media Not To Delete 
bin's Fast Menu (hamburger) in the bottom left-hand corner. Then, from the Fast 
Menu, choose the option that reads Select Media Relatives. The result is that all the 
media files that are linked to those sequences and clips will become selected in the 
Media Tool window. These are the files you do not want to delete. Therefore, now we'll 
tell Media Composer to select the opposite in the following steps.
26.	Select the very top of the Media Tool window (where the name Media appears), 
making sure you don't mistakenly click inside the Media Tool window and deselect 
the highlighted media.
27.	 With the Media Tool window now active, and all the media files still selected, go to 
the Media Tool window's Fast Menu (hamburger) in the bottom left-hand corner. 
From the Fast Menu, choose the option that reads Reverse Selection. The result is 
that all the unused (not linked to) media is selected.
28.	With the Media Tool window still active, press the Delete key on the keyboard.
29.	The Delete Media dialog window will open.
30.	Review the active checkboxes in the dialog window.
31.	 Click the OK button.
32.	A verification dialog window will open.
33.	If you do indeed want to delete the selected media files, then click the  
Delete button.
34.	Depending on the number of files being deleted, this may take some time while the 
files are deleted and the Media Database files are updated.
Locking Clips and Sequences
Very often you will want to lock Clips and Sequences in order to make them more  
difficult to delete.
When you lock a clip in a bin, you are locking both the clip itself as well as the media it links 
to. Locking clips and media is not foolproof. Clips and media can be unlocked from within 
Media Composer as easily as they are locked. Additionally, someone who is determined can 
also very easily unlock media files at the Finder level without Media Composer even running.

When you lock a sequence in a bin, you are locking only the sequence itself. The media a 
sequence links to is not locked when the sequence is locked. See the Deleting Unused Media 
Files: Just Master Clips, just Precomputes, or both recipe that is earlier in this chapter for a 
discussion of how to lock the media files that a sequence is linked to.
It's also important to point out that locking a sequence in a bin does not prevent it from being 
edited. In other words, it will remain fully editable even though it's locked in a bin. How to 
make a sequence less easily editable is discussed in the recipe that follows this one.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the clips and/or sequences.
2.	 Go to Clip menu | Lock Bin Selection. Notice that in the Clip menu, right below the  
Lock Bin Selection choice, is the choice to Unlock Bin Selection.
3.	 You can display the Lock column to see what elements are locked or unlocked.  
To do this:
i.	
Set the bin to Text View.
ii.	
Go to Bin menu | Choose Columns.
iii.	 The Choose Columns dialog window opens.
iv.	 Select Lock.
v.	
Click OK.
Locking sequences to make them less  
easily editable
It's important to make sure to communicate with others in your workgroup so they know a 
sequence has been locked and can't be edited, and ensure that they know how to unlock it 
if they need to. Not everyone knows about locking tracks in sequences and this may cause 
confusion in a workgroup. 
There are two methods you can use to lock tracks in a sequence so that it is more difficult 
to perform an edit on those tracks. The first method will be presented in the How to do it... 
section, and the second will be in the There's more... section.
How to do it…
1.	 Load the sequence into the Timeline Window.
2.	 Using the Track Selectors, select the tracks you want to lock by enabling them.  
Only the enabled tracks will eventually become locked.

3.	 With the Timeline Window still active, go to Clip menu | Lock Tracks. Notice that in 
the Clip menu, right below the Lock Tracks choice, is Unlock Tracks.
4.	 Result – in the Timeline Window there is now a small lock icon where the Sync Lock 
icon normally resides. If you attempt to make an edit (for example, Spice, Lift, etc). 
on the locked tracks, then Media Composer will display a window telling you that it 
Cannot edit a read-only track. You will also find that you are unable to enter Trim or 
Segment Modes on locked tracks.
There's more...
Here's an alternate method for locking tracks.
1.	 Load the sequence into the Timeline Window.
2.	 Right-click on the Track Selector for the one track you want to lock.
3.	 Right-clicking will cause a Contextual menu to appear.
4.	 From the Contextual menu, select Lock Track. Notice that in the menu, right 
below the Lock Track choice, is Unlock Track.
5.	 You must perform this operation on each track you want to lock.

Introduction
Avid Media Composer offers a great deal of audio manipulation capabilities, including volume 
adjustment, pan adjustment, equalization (EQ), both segment-based, and track-based effects 
(for example, reverb) and, now in Version 6, the capability to mix in 5.1 and 7.1 surround 
sound. This chapter will focus on many of the common audio mixing and effects tasks  
and challenges when working in a mono or stereo project.
f
f
As Media Composer evolves, so does the terminology. At the time of writing, here  
are the audio related terminology changes to be aware of:


Sample Plot display has been renamed Waveform display


Energy Plot display has been removed


Auto Gain (short for Automation Gain) has been renamed Volume Automation
f
f
At the time of writing, Media Composer provides 24 mono audio tracks, 24 stereo 
tracks, 24 Surround Sound Tracks, or any combination of them.
f
f
At the time of writing, Media Composer provides the ability to hear any 16 of the 
displayed 24 tracks. In Avid ProTools lingo, they'd say that there are 24 tracks and 
16 Voices. For most of us, 16 tracks are enough. For those that need to output more, 
they can perform an Audio Mixdown function (also known as Bouncing Tracks in the 
audio mixing world). Audio Mixdown is a selection from the Special Menu.
The smallest unit of time in Media Composer is essentially one frame (though in a 35-mm 
Film Project, it is possible to slip sync by 1/4 frame). Other applications created for the 
specific purpose of audio mixing (for example, Avid ProTools) can make adjustments at  
the Sample level (for example, 1/48,000th of a second).
The organization of your Sequence is important. It is advisable to keep specific audio 
elements on specific tracks. For example, track A1 might be the designated track for the 
narrator of your film, and that is all that will ever be placed on that track. Separating audio 
elements onto specific tracks will make it easier to adjust levels, apply EQ, send the audio 
off to another mixer who is using ProTools, create Master Outputs with split tracks, generate 
EDLs, and so on.

Chapter 7
223
Most productions will relate to you what elements should be placed on which track(s).  
If not, you should devise your own layout. Below is a written example of a track layout  
for a documentary, using only mono tracks (note that you can have both mono and stereo 
tracks in the same Sequence).
f
f
A1 is for Narrator Voice Over and whenever the Host appears on camera. It takes  
only one track because it is panned to the center (also known as mid or mono)  
so that the sound comes out of both the left and right speakers.
f
f
A2 and A3 are for Interview Subjects. Again each track would be mono and panned 
to the center. There are two tracks in this example to allow for creating overlapping 
dialog of multiple Subjects, if required, or so that the Interviewer can be on A2 and 
the Subject on A3.
f
f
A4, A5, A6, A7, A8 are for B-roll audio and sound effects. This provides room for 
multiple mono (one track) and stereo elements (two tracks).
f
f
A9 and A10 are reserved for music. A9 is the left channel and A10 is the right 
channel of the stereo music.
Understanding the Track Control Panel and 
Keyframe Selection Tool
Becoming familiar with the locations of these tools and features will help with the discussions 
of using them, which are covered later in this chapter.

How to do it...
Open the Track Control Panel by either of these methods:
f
f
Timeline Window Fast Menu (hamburger) in the bottom-left corner of the Timeline 
Window | Track Control Panel
f
f
Click the Track Control Panel disclosure triangle found in the top-left of the Timeline 
Window, next to the Timecode display (see letter A in the previous screenshot)
How it works...
Now we'll take a look at the features in the previous screenshot:
f
f
B – 5 Real Time Audio Suite (RTAS) buttons: The RTAS Plug-Ins are placed here.  
In addition, clicking on the buttons opens the RTAS Tool.
f
f
C – Active/Inactive Button (with Outline): I think of these as the power button for 
each track, especially since that's the icon the designers chose.


Making a track Inactive is different than Muting it (see letter F). When you 
make a track Inactive, it means that there is less work for the computer to do 
because it will not have to process the RTAS Plug-Ins, Volume Automation, 
Pan Automation, or Real Time (unrendered) EQ effects on the track. 


Making a track Inactive can be a convenient method of muting a track  
when the track is narrow and it is difficult to click on the actual Mute Button 
(see letter F).


The outline indicates that the track will be monitored during certain audio 
scrubbing processes. One example of this would be when you are playing in 
reverse at 60 fps, using the J key. The software allows only 2 of these types 
of tracks. So you can have either 2 Mono tracks or 1 Stereo track that has 
the Active/Inactive Button with the outline.


You can designate a track to be monitored (that is, to have the outline) by 
option/Alt + Clicking on the Active/Inactive Button. An example when 
this would be helpful is when you are using the JKL keys to shuttle around 
your Sequence. It may be that A1 and A2 (dialog) are the tracks with the 
outlined Active/Inactive Button, but you don't want to hear that as you 
shuttle quickly down the Timeline. Instead, it may be more helpful for you to 
hear tracks A7 and A8 (music) when you are shuttling forward at 90 fps or 
in reverse at 60 fps, and so on. So, in this example, you would option/Alt + 
Click on the Active/Inactive Buttons for tracks A7 and A8.


Media Composer Version 6 provides 24 audio tracks. Please refer to the 
Introduction section of this chapter for additional details.
f
f
D – Active/Inactive Button (Without Outline): See letter C for details.
f
f
E – Display Menu: This allows you to display Clip Gain, Volume Automation, and/or 
Pan Automation on a track by track basis.

Chapter 7
225
f
f
F – Solo and Mute buttons: Multiple tracks can be set to Solo or to Mute. Soloing a 
track is essentially isolating it from the others. An example where using Solo would be 
helpful is if you had 12 audio tracks, but for a moment you wanted to hear only the 
dialog on A1 along with the sound effect on A5. Muting is simply stopping the audio 
from being heard. Any RTAS Plug-Ins, Volume Automation, Pan Automation, or Real 
Time EQ effects are still being processed. To lighten the processing burden on the 
computer, you can make the track Inactive (see letter C).
f
f
G – Keyframe Selection Tool: This is enabled by default, but it may be disabled 
to avoid accidentally adjusting a keyframe value when using the Smart Tool. For 
emphasis, it must be enabled in order to be able to manually adjust and/or remove 
keyframes using the cursor.
f
f
H – Waveform Display Button: This allows you to display the Waveforms on a track 
by track basis.
Understanding the Audio Mixer Tool – Clip 
Mode
It's important to note that the Audio Mixer Tool has three different modes, each allowing 
different capabilities and functionality. The different modes are toggled using the Audio  
Mixer Mode Button (see letter I in the next screenshot). Two of the modes, Clip and  
Volume Automation (Auto), are discussed in this chapter.
Here's a screenshot of the Audio Mixer Tool – Clip Mode:

How to do it...
1.	 Open the Audio Mixer with any of these methods: 
i.	
Tools Menu | Audio Mixer.
ii.	
Windows | Workspaces | Audio Editing.
iii.	 Consider mapping the Audio Mixer menu selection to a convenient 
location on your keyboard. For example, I've placed this on Shift + A. 
More information on mapping buttons and menu selections can be 
found in the Mapping buttons and menu selections recipe in Chapter 2, 
Customizing Your Work Environment.
2.	 Click the Audio Mixer Mode button (letter I in the previous screenshot) so that it 
displays the text Clip.
How it works...
Later in this chapter we'll cover using the Audio Mixer when set to Clip Mode, but first let's 
examine the features in the previous screenshot:
f
f
A (Sequence Mix Format): Informs Media Composer how the Sequence should be 
processed by the software. Selections are: Stereo, 5.1 and 7.1. Avid states, "When 
you select a surround sound format, the Avid editing application displays the 
appropriate pan tools to use when you edit your sequence. Setting the surround 
sound format determines in which format you can mix your audio".
f
f
B (Monitor Mix): Instructs Media Composer how the Sequence should be played 
back (monitored) in your edit suite. Selections include: Mono, Stereo, 5.1, and 
7.1. See the Avid Help for additional details. The search term is Surround 
Monitoring. For example:


If you are working on a Sequence that is in the 5.1 Surround Sound format 
and your edit suite is equipped to monitor all six channels, then you would 
set this to the appropriate 5.1 monitoring setting


If you are working on a Sequence that is in the 5.1 Surround Sound format, 
but happen to be in an edit suite with only the ability to monitor 2 stereo 
channels, then in order to be able to hear all the channels you would need

C (Audio Loop Play): You can make adjustments while Media Composer loops. To do 
this, Mark In/Out for a portion of a Segment, one Segment, or multiple Segments. 
Then press the Audio Loop Play button. Make adjustments during the loop. Note 
that the changes will not be applied until the loop cycles back to the beginning. For 
this reason, you may find that selections of short durations work the best. Stop the 
looping playback by clicking the Audio Loop Play button. Any adjustments made 
during the audio looping will be applied.

D (Render Effect): If you have applied an AudioSuite Plug-In Effect or an EQ Effect 
and rendered it, then adjusting the volume level or pan will require you to re-render 
the effect. You can use any method to perform the render; this button is provided  
as a convenience.
f
f
E (Audio Mixer Fast Menu): Provides various functions, depending on the mode 
setting (Clip, Auto, or Live). Some of these selections are covered later in this 
chapter, in the sections that discuss using the Audio Mixer in Clip Mode and 
Automation Mode (Auto).
f
f
F (Bypass): Avid states, "Lets you temporarily turn off any Clip Volume or volume 
automation effects. This button functions the same as the Bypass panel in the 
Effects tab in the Audio Project Settings dialog box. (this control does not appear  
in Live Mix mode)".
f
f
G (Mix Pane Size Toggle): Allows you to toggle how many mixer channels are 
displayed. You can toggle between 4, 8, and 16.
f
f
H (Mix Pane Display Toggle): Toggles through the display of different mixer channels. 
For example, if you have chosen to display only 4 channels in the Audio Mixer, but 
your Sequence has 12 audio tracks. You can click this button to toggle between 
displaying channels 1 through 4, then channels 5 through 8, and then channels 9 
through 12.

I (Audio Mixer Mode Button):


Clip: Allows audio level and pan adjustment on a Segment basis. More 
information about using the Audio Mixer when in Clip Mode is included  
in this chapter.


Auto (short for Volume Automation): Allows audio level and pan adjustment 
within a Segment by using keyframes. Further, keyframes can be added 
manually as well as recorded in Real Time. More information about using  
the Audio Mixer when in Auto Mode is included in this chapter.


Live: Avid states, "Lets you temporarily override any existing volume and pan 
automation settings. You can use the controls on the Audio Mixer tool or use 
an external controller to change volume and pan settings without modifying 
the existing volume and pan automation settings". I'll add that these 
temporary adjustments can also be made permanent by using selections 
from the Audio Mixer Fast Menu when in Live Mode. I do not cover 
using this mode, but additional information is available in the Avid Media 
Composer Help. The search term is Live Mix Mode.

J (Pan Knob): It may take a bit of getting used to using the knob. Your instinct may be 
to click on it and move your mouse up and down, but this will be frustrating. Instead, 
move your mouse left and right. Further, when a Pan Knob is selected, you can also 
type in a value to enter the pan value (be aware though, at the time of writing, the 
value does not appear as you type it). After typing in the value, you must press the 
Return or Enter key. Some helpful values are:


-100: Panned 100 percent to the Left Channel


0: Center Panned, which is indicated as Mid


100: Panned 100 percent to the Right Channel
f
f
K (Group Button): Note that in previous releases, this was referred to as the Gang 
button. Enable this for two or more channels. When channels are Grouped together, 
you will be able to adjust one slider and have the other Grouped slider(s) also be 
adjusted by the same amount.
f
f
L (Stereo Link): Avid states, "For stereo sequences, it links the two pan controls 
so that when you move one Pan Location cursor, the other moves in a parallel 
direction". Essentially, when you pan one channel more to the left or right, the  
other channel moves in the same direction, by the same amount.
f
f
M (Stereo Mirror): This is only available by first enabling Stereo Link. Avid States, 
"For stereo sequences, it links the two pan controls so that when you move one Pan 
Location cursor, the other moves in a mirrored direction—for example, if you drag 
the Pan Location cursor to the left, the corresponding cursor in the second X/Y grid 
moves to the right." Essentially, when you pan one channel more to the left or right, 
the other channel moves in the opposite direction, by the same amount.
f
f
N (Solo and Mute buttons): You can Solo or Mute multiple channels/tracks. Soloing 
a track is essentially for isolating it from the others. An example where using Solo 
would be helpful is if you had 12 audio tracks, but for a moment you wanted to 
hear only the dialog on A1 along with the sound effect on A5. Muting is simply 
stopping the audio from being heard; any RTAS Plug-Ins, Volume Automation, Pan 
Automation, or Real Time (unrendered) EQ effects are still being processed. To 
lighten the processing burden on the computer, you can make the track Inactive  
(see the previous Understanding the Track Control panel and Keyframe Selection

Understanding the Audio Tool

In addition to evaluating a sound mix subjectively, we have to also evaluate it technically. The

How it works...
Now lets take a closer look at the display and features of the Audio Tool.
f
f
The measurement scale on the left-hand side is digital and uses the decibel scale, 
which is written as dB.
f
f
The measurement scale on the right references the analog Volume Units scale, 
which is written as VU.
f
f
On the digital scale, the highest value is zero. Audio above this level is clipped, 
and this is very undesirable as digital clipping causes distortion, making it sound 
terrible. On the VU scale, clipping occurs at approximately 20 VU. After doing some 
mathematical calculations, it works out that -20 dB on the digital scale equates  
to 0 VU on the analog scale. This is what Avid has set as the default, but it can  
be changed as needed (more on that in the next couple of bullet points).
f
f
We mix so that generally the loudest average (also known as Peak Average) is 
around -20 dB/0 VU. However, it is generally allowed to have momentary peaks 
(called Transient Peaks) that can be louder. An example of a Transient Peak would 
be a single hand-clap, or a single drumbeat. It is generally allowed to have Transient 
Peaks extend as much as 6 dB higher. You'll see on the digital scale that the first 
value indicated above -20 dB is -14 dB, which is a difference of 6 dB. Also notice 
that the next level indicated above -14 dB is -8 dB, which again is a difference of 
6 dB. As this information is only a general guide, it is a good idea to check with the 
broadcaster you are delivering to for the exact specifications that they require.
f
f
The relationship of -20 dB to 0 VU is not a hard and fast rule. On some productions, 
you may be asked to mix to a level of -14 dB (or some other level such as -18 dB). 
Generally, this is because you are outputting to an analog deck (for example, Beta-SP). 
When you are instructed to mix to a level such as -14 dB, you'll find it helpful to adjust 
the VU meter so that 0 VU equates to -14 dB (or any other value dictated). How to 
adjust this (what is referred to as the Reference Level) will be covered just a bit later in 
this section (see the discussion of the Peak Hold Menu | "Set Reference Level").
f
f
There is a grey button in the upper-left corner, labeled as RP. This is the Reset  
Peak button and its purpose is explained along with Infinite Hold just a few bullet 
points down.
There is what appears to be a grey button in the upper-right corner, labeled as PH (which 
stands for Peak Hold). When you click on it, you'll discover that it's not actually a button  
but a menu. Let's cover a few of the menu selections from the Peak Hold Menu:
f
f
Input Settings: Opens the Audio Project Settings and reveals the Input Tab. Audio 
Project Settings can also be found here: Project Window | Settings Tab | Audio 
Project. The selections available here depend on what type of audio configuration 
you have with your system as well as what external hardware you are using.

Chapter 7
233
f
f
Output Settings: As with Input Settings, the selections available in Output Settings 
depend on what type of audio configuration you have with your system as well 
as what external hardware you are using. Take note of what Avid calls the Mix 
Mode Selection Button. When you click on it, you can toggle the output type. On 
software-only systems, it will toggle between Stereo and Mono. On systems with Avid 
hardware, there will be an additional option to send each track in your sequence out 
separately. This is called Direct Out. More information about Direct Out can be found 
in this chapter in the section that covers Audio Project Settings.
f
f
Peak Hold: This is the default setting. This allows the peak loudness value to be 
displayed on the meter for an extra moment or two so that it is easier for us to see 
the peaks.
f
f
Infinite Hold: This displays a horizontal line at the loudest/peak level. Because  
the line does not disappear automatically, they call it Infinite Hold. Since this holds  
a value on the meter, you will want to clear it when evaluating another portion of  
your film or capturing different footage. To do this, simply click the grey RP (Reset 
Peaks) button in the top-left corner. Infinite Hold can be useful in a variety of 
situations. Here are several:


If you are having trouble noting the peak level value shown when the setting 
is Peak Hold, you can set it to Infinite Hold.


If you'd like to watch a portion of your film and at the same time get 
information about audio peaks, this will allow you to concentrate on the film 
and then, after playback has ended, see the peak value.


During capture, it's often common to leave that process unattended. If you 
use Infinite Hold, you can be aware of the peak audio value that occurred 
while capturing, and if it was too high. 
f
f
Play Calibration Tone: This plays out a reference tone, on all channels, at the 
value that is set in the Set Reference Level dialog (see next bullet point). This is a 
very useful feature for calibrating the devices, such as decks and mixers, that are 
connected to the editing system. It's also very useful for troubleshooting situations 
when you are unable to hear audio in your edit bay. This way you can send out a 
constant and uniform audio signal from your Avid system without having to loop a 
section of your Sequence. To stop the playback of the Calibration Tone, simply click 
anywhere on the Audio Tool.
f
f
Set Reference Level: This allows you to enter an alternate value other than the 
default of -20 dB. This ensures that your digital value properly equates with 0 VU.
f
f
Set Calibration Tone: By default, Media Composer properly sets your Reference 
Level as the value for the Calibration Tone.

f
f
Create Tone Media: Opens a dialog window allowing you to create a Master Clip  
of tone:


dB level defaults to the Reference Level Setting.


Frequency of the tone: The default is 1000 Hertz (written as 1000 Hz).  
This is also referred to as a 1 kilohertz tone (1 kHz), and you'll hear people 
use a shorthand term as well and call it simply a 1 K tone. It can be adjusted 
if/when required.


Tone Media Length: This defaults to the commonly used 60 seconds (1 
minute) that is used along with Color Bars, but you can set this to whatever 
length you need. Media Composer will not create media for the duration you 
set. It actually just creates one frame of media and tells the Master Clip 
to refer to that one frame over and over for the duration you specify. This is 
great because it is able to create the clip very quickly as well as take up a 
very small amount of space on the hard drive.


Number of Tracks: A nice convenience feature if you have to have tone on 
multiple tracks for a stereo output or a direct output (meaning each track 
in your Sequence goes out separately). This creates a Master Clip with the 
designated number of tracks so that when it comes time to edit it into the 
Sequence you can accomplish it with one edit rather than two or more.
Understanding Clip Gain and Pan versus 
Volume and Pan Automation
While the title of this section sounds complicated, this section is simply about understanding 
that the Clip setting of the Audio Mixer affects Segments in their entirety, while the Auto setting 
allows you to place keyframes within a Segment to affect portions of a segment differently.
You may find it helpful to first review the previous sections in this chapter that provide an 
overview of the Audio Mixer.
How to do it...
1.	 Open the Audio Mixer with any of the following methods:

How it works...
Before covering these features in more depth, later in this chapter, I think it will be helpful 
to provide an overview of the differences between Clip Gain and Clip Pan versus Volume 
Automation and Pan Automation (referred to as Automation Gain and Automation Pan  
prior to Version 6).
f
f
When the Audio Mix Tool is set to Clip (short for Clip Gain), the tool affects audio 
segments in their entirety. In other words it can only affect the level and pan for 
whole Segments; it can not affect only a portion of a Segment. Here, the software 
designers are using the term Clip and Segment interchangeably. This may help you 
remember what the Clip setting is programmed to do.
f
f
You can divide a Segment into multiple, separate segments (that is, sections) using 
the Add Edit function. Then, each Segment's Level or Pan can be adjusted differently 
from the other(s). To smooth the transition of the Level or Pan from one Segment 
to another, you can add a dissolve. The longer the dissolve is, the longer (and more 
subtle) the level or pan change will be. This is discussed later in this chapter in the 
the Using Clip Mode with Dissolves to smooth Level and Pan adjustments recipe.
f
f
Volume Automation and Pan Automation allow you to add keyframes and essentially 
graph changes of volume or pan within a single segment. In other words, with Volume 
and Pan Automation you do not have to cut a segment into separate segments (that 
is, sections) in order to affect different portions of it.
f
f
New in Avid Media Composer Version 6, you do not have to display the Volume or Pan 
Automation in order to add keyframes manually to a segment when using the level 
sliders or pan knobs. In other words, moving a slider or pan knob when in Auto mode 
will add a keyframe. While convenient, it also means that you will need to be more 
aware of the Clip/Auto setting of your Audio Mixer. For emphasis, if you want to add 
a keyframe by pressing the Add Keyframe button, then you must have Volume or Pan 
Automation displayed in the Timeline. While this new programming is an interesting 
addition to the capabilities of the system, my instinct tells me that most will still want 
to display these the majority of the time, so that they can both see and adjust the 
keyframes.
f
f
When you manually change the level or pan with the Audio Mixer set to Clip, it 
means that you will first make the adjustment and then, in a second step, play the 
adjusted region to evaluate it.
f
f
When you manually add keyframes into the Sequence, and manually adjust them,  
it means that you will first make an adjustment and then, in a second step, play  
the adjusted region to evaluate it.
f
f
When the Audio Mix Tool is set to Auto, it is possible to record your volume and  
pan adjustments in Real Time. In other words, you can make the changes while  
the Sequence plays in Real Time and hear those changes occurring in Real Time. 
This is discussed in the the Real Time Volume and Pan adjustment recipe.

f
f
You can display any combination of Waveforms, Clip Gain, and Volume Automation 
in the Timeline at the same time. Or, you can display any combination of Waveforms, 
Clip Gain, and Pan Automation in the Timeline at the same time. In other words, you 
can not display Volume and Pan Automation at the same time. For emphasis, Volume 
Automation and Pan Automation changes (that is, using keyframes) can be applied to 
the same Segment, however, only one or the other can be displayed at a time.
f
f
Adjustments made when the Audio Mixer is set to Clip are entirely separate 
from adjustments made with keyframes. Here are two examples where this is 
advantageous:


Example 1 (Low Audio): In this example, I have a segment of audio that 
is very low, so I use Clip Gain to raise it up +12dB (the highest it will go). 
However, even after doing this, the audio is still too low. I can then use 
Volume Automation (keyrames) to raise that Segment (or a portion of that 
Segment) up as much as an additional +12dB. In other words, Clip Gain and 
Volume Automation are cumulative and I can raise a Segment's level up by 
as much as +24dB in total.


Example 2 (Quick Overall Change): In my sequence, I have a long duration 
of music which I spent a good deal of time adjusting with many keyframes 
to make it louder in some portions and quieter in others. Then later, without 
my Timeline set to display the keyframes, I decide that I want to keep the 
volume keyframing as it is, but change the overall level of the music without 
having to switch the Timeline View and go through the other steps necessary 
to adjust the multiple keyframes. In this instance, I can use the Audio Mixer 
set to Clip to affect the overall level of the music without changing (or even 
having to display) the volume keyframes. Details on using the Audio Mixer 
set to Clip Mode begins with the Clip Mode level and Pan Adjustments 
recipe.
Understanding Audio Project Settings
Each time you create a new Project, Media Composer sets the Audio Project Settings to 
default values. However, you can adjust these settings if necessary.
How to do it...
Use either of these methods to access your Audio Project Settings:
f
f
Go to Project Window | Settings tab and double-click the Audio Project settings to  
open them.
f
f
Go to Tools Menu | Audio Tool. Click the PH button in the top-right corner to reveal 
the Peak Hold Menu and select Input Settings.

237
How it works...
Once you have opened the Audio Project Settings, you'll be presented with a window that has 
several sections (or tabs), that each offer various options.
In the tab labeled as Main, here are some options to be aware of:
f
f
The Sample Rate of your Project: The default is 48 kHz. This dictates the Sample 
Rate of audio when it is captured or imported as well as played during output.
f
f
Convert Sample Rates When Playing: By default, Media Composer is set to play any 
audio that is not at the Project Sample Rate (the setting is Always). This is a handy 
feature until you have to output your Sequence to tape. When you output to a tape, 
the Sample Rate of all the audio elements must be the same (just in the same way 
that the video has to be all SD or all HD). This is discussed in Chapter 6 > “Changing 
Audio Sample Rate for Clips & Sequences.” 
f
f
Show Mismatched Sample Rates as Different Color: The default setting is Yes. 
When you display the Audio Waveforms in the Sequence, audio that is at the same 
Sample Rate as the Audio Project Sample Rate setting will display as black. Audio 
that is not at the Audio Project Sample Rate will display as light grey.
In the tab labeled as Input, you can relate to the software where (what connection) the audio 
signal is coming from:
f
f
The selections available here depend on what type of audio configuration you have 
with your system as well as what external hardware you are using. See the Avid 
Media Composer Help for additional information.
f
f
Input Source: Allows you to select the available input sources, for example, Host-
1394 ( also known as Firewire), XLR, RCA, SDI, AES/EBU, and so on.
In the tab labeled as Output, you can instruct how Media Composer will send the audio signal 
out of your system:
f
f
The selections available here depend on what type of audio configuration you have 
with your system as well as what external hardware you are using. See the Avid 
Media Composer Help for additional information.
f
f
Output Gain: Allows you to raise or lower the overall (also known as global) output  
of your system if required.
f
f
Mix Mode Selection Button: When you click on it, you can toggle the output method, 
or as Avid puts it, "How your system interprets audio values during playback." On 
software-only systems, it will toggle between Stereo and Mono. On systems with 
hardware, there will be an additional option called Direct Out. This will send each 
track in your sequence out separately to the available output channels on the 
deck. By default it is set as a one-to-one relationship, but you can use the Channel 
Assignment Menu to set up whatever is required. The following is an example:
www.it-ebooks.info

Mono and Stereo Audio Mixing
238
In my Sequence, I have eight tracks:
f
f
A1: Narrator / Host on Camera
f
f
A2: Interview Subjects
f
f
A3: B-Roll audio (also known as Natural Sound or Nats)
f
f
A4, A5, and A6: Sound effects
f
f
A7 and A8: Stereo Music
I am outputting to a tape format with only 4 available channels. If my goal is to create a 
Master Tape with the different audio elements split onto different channels, Direct Out allows 
me to assign specific tracks from my Sequence to specific channels on the deck. In this 
situation, I would assign (also known as patch) in the following way:
f
f
A1 and A2 output to Channel 1
f
f
A3, A4, A5, and A6 output to Channel 2
f
f
A7 output to Channel 3
f
f
A8 output to Channel 4
The end result on the Master Tape is that I have the audio for the Narrator, Host, and 
Interview Subjects separate from the audio of the B-Roll and Sound Effects, and I keep the 
music in true stereo. This way if/when there is the need to repurpose the film, there will be 
greater flexibility. One example of this would be if I sold my English language documentary to a 
television station in Italy. Because all the dialog is separate from the other elements it will be 
easy to dub the film into Italian. Eccellente, eh?
Performing audio scrubbing: digital type 
scrubbing
Media Composer provides two types of audio scrubbing. One is a digital sounding scrub that 
might be described as staccato sounding (which is discussed in this recipe). The other is a 
more analogue sounding scrub that might be described as sounding like audio tape being 
rocked back and forth over the play-head on a tape machine (discussed in the recipe that 
follows this one).

How to do it...
1.	 Enable the Digital Scrubbing feature by either of these methods:
i.	
Press and hold the Shift key.
ii.	
Enable Caps Lock.
2.	 Scrub the audio by any of these methods:
i.	
Moving the blue Position Indicator.
ii.	
Use the Step Forward and Step Backward functions on the keyboard. 
By default, these are located on the 1, 2, 3, and 4 keys. The 1 and 2 
keys are 8 or 10 frames at a time (depending on Project Format), while 
the 3 and 4 keys are 1 frame at a time.
iii.	 Use the Step Forward and Step Backward functions below the Source 
and Record Windows.
3.	 Adjust the Digital Scrub Type: By default, Digital Audio Scrub is set to Fast Scrub 
which smoothes out the playback of the scrubbing while also making it possible to 
scrub at nearly real time speed. If you'd like to have it slow down for a bit of additional 
precision then deselect the Fast Scrub feature which is found here: Project Window 
| Settings Tab | Timeline Settings | Display Tab | Use Fast Scrub.

The more analogue sounding scrub (as opposed to digital scrub, discussed previoulsy) might 
be described as sounding like audio tape being rocked back and forth over the play-head on  
a tape machine.
How to do it...
1.	 Press and hold down the Pause Key. By default, this function is located on the K key.
2.	 While continuing to press the K key, do any of the following:
i.	
Press and hold the J or the L key to scrub slowly either backward  
or forward.
ii.	
Tap the J or L key quickly/momentarily to scrub one frame at a  
time either backward or forward.

How it works…
The multiple abilities of JKL are discussed in the Moving around: Methods and tips recipe  
in Appendix A, Additional Tips, Tricks, and Explanations.
Displaying Audio Waveforms ( also known as 
Sample Plot)
Note that in earlier releases of Media Composer, Audio Waveforms were referred to as 
Sample Plot and that the display-type called Energy Plot has been removed.
It is also helpful to know that if you have audio with mismatched Sample Rates (meaning that 
a Clip's audio does not match the Project's Sample Rate as set in the Audio Project Settings), 
that those waveforms will be displayed as light grey, rather than black. There is more 
information about this in Chapter 6, Changing Audio Sample Rate for Clips & Sequences. 
In this recipe, we'll cover the two methods available for displaying the Audio Waveforms in 
the Timeline, and in the There's more... section, we'll see how it's possible to display Audio 
Waveforms for Source Material.
How to do it...
This is the first method to display waveforms in the timeline. This method displays the audio 
waveform for all tracks, while the second method allows the waveforms to be displayed only 
on selected tracks.
1.	 Go to Timeline Window Fast Menu (hamburger-looking icon) in the bottom-left corner 
of the Timeline Window.
2.	 From the Fast Menu, select Audio Data.
3.	 From the Sub-Menu, select Waveform.
Alternatively, here's a second method to display waveforms in the timeline. This method allows 
the waveforms to be displayed only on selected tracks.
1.	 Open the Track Control Panel using one of these methods:
i.	
Timeline Window Fast Menu (hamburger) in the bottom-left corner of 
the Timeline Window | Track Control Panel.
ii.	
Click the Track Control Panel disclosure triangle found in the top-left 
of the Timeline Window, next to the Timecode display (see the next 
screenshot):

Chapter 7
241
2.	 This reveals the Audio Waveform Display button for each individual track (see the 
next screenshot). Click this button to display or hide the waveform for a track.
How it works…
Media Composer has to both calculate as well as draw the waveform display, so it may slow 
down the responsiveness of your system. This is why the per track display is a welcome 
addition. The more waveforms that must be drawn on screen, the more work for the computer, 
and the longer it will take. One method to reduce the redraw time is to zoom-in on the 
timeline, using the More Detail function or by using the Focus function (located, by default, 
on the letter H on the keyboard). See the There's more... section below for more related tips.
There's more...
There will be times when it is helpful to see the waveforms of material that is loaded into your 
Source Window, and there are a variety of helpful tips that relate to audio waveform display. 
We'll take a look at them below.

Displaying Waveforms for Source Material
Many users aren't aware that you can display the material that's loaded into your Source 
Window in the Timeline Window. Let's take a look at how easy it really is:
1.	 Load a Clip or Sequence containing audio into the Source Window.
2.	 Enable the Audio Waveform Display, using either method in the recipe of steps 
described earlier.
3.	 Step 4 will tell you how to switch the Timeline from displaying the Sequence that is 
loaded into the Record Monitor to instead displaying whatever (Clip or Sequence) 
has been loaded into the Source Monitor. To do this:
4.	 Click the Toggle Source/Record In Timeline button found in the bottom-left corner of 
the Timeline window, and next to the Video Quality Menu (see the next screenshot):
5.	 Notice that when you are viewing Source Material in the Timeline Window, Media 
Composer changes the color of the Position Indicator in the Timeline to green and 
that the icon for Toggle Source/Record in Timeline is also green. Additionally, the 
Track Selectors swap sides. In other words, while viewing Source Material in the 
Timeline, the Source Track Selectors will then be on the right and the Sequence 
Track Selectors will be on the left.
Tips When Displaying Waveforms
f
f
The keyboard shortcut to make selected tracks wider or narrower is: cmd/Ctrl + L, 
and cmd/Ctrl + K, respectively (also located in the Edit Menu).

f
f
Add one more key to the shortcut above and you will instead make the Waveform 
Display bigger or smaller on the selected tracks. The shortcut to make the waveform 
display larger or smaller is: option/Alt + cmd/Ctrl + L, and option/Alt + cmd/Ctrl + K, 
respectively.
f
f
Show Marked Waveforms: By default, Media Composer will draw the waveforms for 
the entire duration of the Sequence, which can sometimes take a while. However, you 
can restrict it to drawing waveforms within a specific region by enabling this setting 
and then using a Mark In and Mark Out to define a shorter duration for the waveform 
display. For emphasis, no waveforms will be displayed unless you have placed both a 
Mark In and a Mark Out to define a region where the waveforms should be displayed. 
The setting to enable this feature is found here: Project Window | Settings Tab | 
Timeline Settings | Display Tab | Show Marked Waveforms.
f
f
While the Waveforms are actually being drawn, if it is taking too long to draw them 
because you have a long Sequence and/or many audio tracks, you can stop the 
drawing process with the keyboard shortcut cmd/Ctrl + the period key.
f
f
Track Color: You may find that when you are using the Waveform display, Clip Gain 
display and/or the Volume/Pan Automation display that you'd like to change the 
color of the track(s) to better see the display. You can do this by enabling the tracks 
you'd like to change, then going to: Timeline Window Fast Menu (hamburger) in the 
bottom-left corner of the Timeline Window, and then selecting Track Color. Here's 
an extra tip: if you hold down the option/Alt key while you select a color from the 
swatches, then you will open the color-picker window associated with your operating 
system (Mac or PC). This will give you a much wider selection of colors and brightness 
levels to choose from. For example, I sometimes like my tracks bright white.

Displaying Clip Gain, Volume Automation, 
and Pan Automation in the Timeline
In this recipe, we'll cover:

Why you want/need to display Volume/Pan Automation and Clip Gain
f
f
Two methods to display Clip Gain and Volume Automation
f
f
The only method to display Pan Automation (due to the addition of 5.1 and 7.1 
surround sound capabilities in Version 6)
Getting ready
First it is important to know why you would display Volume/Pan Automation and Clip Gain:
f
f
Displaying Volume Automation and Pan Automation is required in order to be able to 
manually add keyframes, and manually adjust keyframes in Media Composer Version 
5 and earlier. However:


New in Avid Media Composer Version 6, you do not have to display the 
Volume or Pan Automation in order to add keyframes to a Segment when 
using the Audio Mixer's level sliders or pan knobs. While this is convenient, 
it also means that you will need to be more aware of the Clip/Auto setting 
of your Audio Mixer. For emphasis, if you want to add a keyframe by 
pressing the Add Keyframe button, then you still must have Volume or Pan 
Automation displayed in the Timeline. While this new programming is an 
interesting addition to the capabilities of the system, my instinct tells me that 
most will still want to display these the majority of the time, so that they can 
both see and adjust the keyframes.


If you are recording volume and/or pan changes in Real Time, then you do 
not have to have Volume or Pan Automation displayed (though you will most 
likely find it quite helpful). It's also helpful to know that Volume Automation 
and Pan Automation can not be displayed at the same time. For emphasis, 
you can certainly apply volume and pan changes to the same Segment  
using Automation keyframes, it's just that you can not display them at  
the same time.

f
f
Displaying Clip Gain provides a helpful visual cue and/or reference so that you can 
see which segments, and how much those segments, have been adjusted using 
this method. Media Composer does this by displaying a black, horizontal line within 
segments that have been adjusted. For emphasis, the black, horizontal line will 
not appear within a segment unless it has been adjusted. This is a change from 
previous releases when the black line would appear immediately (at 0 VU), even if 
no adjustment had been made. It's also important to note that, even though there is 
a black line that you can see, you are not able to grab that line with your cursor and 
move it up or down in the Timeline; it is currently a display only.
How to do it...
There are two methods to display Clip Gain and Volume Automation, and one method to 
display Pan Automation.
This first method will allow you to display Clip Gain and/or Volume Automation for all tracks:
1.	 Go to Timeline Window Fast Menu (hamburger) in the bottom-left corner of the 
Timeline Window.
2.	 From the Fast Menu, select Audio Data.
3.	 From the Sub-Menu, select Clip Gain, Volume Automation, or Pan Automation.
4.	 Repeat this process to display additional audio data (for example, waveforms).  
Note that Volume Automation and Pan Automation can not be displayed at  
the same time.
This second method is the only way to display Pan Automation. It also allows Clip Gain  
and Volume Automation, or Pan Automation, to be displayed only on selected tracks.
1.	 Open the Track Control Panel using one of these methods:


Timeline Window Fast Menu (hamburger) in the bottom-left corner of the 
Timeline Window | Track Control Panel.

2.	 This reveals a menu for each individual track, allowing you to customize the display 
on a track by track basis (see the next screenshot):
Clip Mode Level and Pan Adjustments
In the next several recipes, we'll be covering using Clip Mode with Dissolves to make Level 
and Pan adjustments, setting a common level to multiple segments simultaneously, and 
adjusting multiple segments simultaneously by a uniform amount. Once you understand these 
three things, then all the other available options from the Audio Mixer Fast Menu will make 
perfect sense.
First, let's open the Audio Mixer and get it set to Clip Mode:
How to do it...
1.	 Open the Audio Mixer with any of these methods:


Tools Menu | Audio Mixer


Windows | Workspaces | Audio Editing


Consider mapping the Audio Mixer menu selection to a convenient 
location on your keyboard. For example, I've placed this on Shift + A. More 
information on mapping buttons and menu selections can be found in the 
Mapping buttons and menu selections recipe in Chapter 2, Customizing  
Your Work Environment.
2.	 Click the Audio Mixer Mode button so that it displays the text Clip.

How it works...
Following is some information that you will find helpful as you begin to use the Audio Mixer's 
various functions as discussed in the several recipes later in this chapter.
f
f
When the Audio Mix Tool is set to Clip (short for Clip Gain), the tool affects audio 
segments in their entirety. In other words, it can only affect the level and pan for 
whole segments; it can not affect only a portion of a Segment. Here, the software 
designers are using the term Clip and Segment interchangeably. This may help you 
remember what the Clip setting is programmed to do. We'll use a simple method, 
using dissolves, (detailed later in this chapter) to make it seem as if we have changed 
the level or pan within a segment and still used the Audio Mixer set to Clip Mode.
f
f
For some operations (discussed below) found in the Audio Mixer's Fast Menu, when 
there is no Mark In and/or Mark Out, then you will be affecting all the segments on 
the selected track(s). Avid refers to this as affecting the tracks Globally.
f
f
For some operations provided in the Audio Mixer Fast Menu (discussed later), when 
you place a Mark In and/or a Mark Out, you are defining a range of segments to 
affect. Any segment that comes into contact with the Mark In and/or Mark Out (even 
if by only one frame), along with all the segments in between, will be affected. This 
leads some people to feel that they have to Mark In and Mark Out very precisely. 
Actually the opposite is true. This programming allows you to place your Mark In and 
Mark Out very roughly, only having to make sure that they are placed somewhere 
within the first segment you want to affect and somewhere within the last segment 
you want to affect. In the next screenshot, I would be affecting the Reilly Segment in 
its entirety through the Kate Segment in its entirety:

f
f
For some operations provided in the Audio Mixer Fast Menu (discussed later),  
you can place only a Mark In and affect just the segments on the selected track(s) 
from the Mark In to the end of the Sequence.
f
f
For some operations provided in the Audio Mixer Fast Menu (discussed later), you 
can place only a Mark Out and affect just the segments on the selected track(s)  
from the beginning of the Sequence to the Mark Out.
Using Clip Mode with Dissolves to smooth 
Level and Pan adjustments
While the Audio Mixer can only affect segments in their entirety, you can divide a Segment 
into multiple, separate segments (that is, sections) using the Add Edit function. Then, each 
Segment's Level or Pan can be adjusted differently from the other(s). To smooth the transition 
of the Level or Pan from one Segment to another, you can add a dissolve. The longer the 
dissolve is, the longer (and more subtle) the level or pan change will be.
How to do it...
1.	 Open the Audio Mixer Tool: Tools Menu | Audio Mixer.
2.	 Set the Audio Mixer Mode to Clip.
3.	 Enable the track(s) you want to affect.
4.	 Place the blue Position Indicator at the spot you want to divide a segment(s).
5.	 Press the Add Edit function. The Add Edit function's icon looks like the letter H 
turned on its side. By default, you'll find the Add Edit function in these locations:
i.	
Under the Record Monitor, in the top row of buttons, on the right-hand 
side.
ii.	
In the Fast Menu Tool Palette found between the yellow Splice arrow 
and the red Overwrite arrow.
iii.	 In the Command Palette: Tools Menu | Command Palette | Edit Tab.
6.	 After dividing a segment of video or audio (but not Filler) you will of course see the 
cut, and you'll also notice a small, white equals symbol, which tells you two things:


There is no break in Timecode. This is why Avid refers to this as a "Match 
Frame Edit."


The white color tells you that there is no difference in level or pan between 
the segments. If/When there is a difference, the equals sign will be red. 
You can not remove a Match Frame edit if there is a difference between 
adjacent Segments. In other words, you can not remove a Match Frame edit 
when the equals symbol is red. See the There's more... section below for 
information on how to remove white Match Frame edits.

Chapter 7
249
7.	
Place your blue Position Indicator onto the segment you want to adjust.
8.	 Use the Audio Mixer Tool in Clip Mode to adjust the level and/or pan.
9.	 Play the region you've adjusted to evaluate it.
10.	 Add a dissolve where you placed your Add Edit, using the Quick Transition function, 
to smooth the transition in level and/or pan. By default, you can find the Quick 
Transition function in these locations:
i.	
Back Slash Key, just above the Return key.
ii.	
On the Timeline Tool Bar (by default it's the fifth button from the left).
iii.	 In the Fast Menu Tool Palette found between the yellow Splice arrow 
and the red Overwrite arrow. It will be the first button on the top row.
iv.	 Command Palette: Tool Menu | Command Palette | FX Tab.
How it works…
Remember that you are still affecting individual segments. The key is that there is no 
interruption or break in the flow of the actual content. Further, it's helpful to realize that you can 
trim a transition point early or later to adjust the position of the Pan and/or Volume change.
Added Trivia: The equals symbol comes from editing film when using a Workprint. It would 
be written at a cut-point on the Workprint very boldly, using a grease pencil. The equals 
symbol was used to communicate to the person conforming the film negative (known as the 
Conformer, or Negative Matcher) that a particular cut in the Workprint was an Unintended 
Splice and that they should not pay attention to it when cutting-up the negative.
There's more...
Removing Match Frame Edits – you can remove Match Frame Edits as long as the equals 
symbol at the cut point is white (not red). White indicates that there is no difference between 
the segments (for example, volume levels must be the same). Note that there will not be an 
equals symbol displayed when Add Edits (cuts) are placed in Filler. To remove Match Frame 
Edits, use either of the following methods:
Remove Match Frame Edits In Source/Record Mode
1.	 Enable the Track Selectors for the track(s) that contain Match Frame Edits you  
want to remove.
2.	 Mark In/Out to affect only a portion of Match Frame edits. Without Marks, you  
will be affecting all the white Match Frame Edits (and those in Filler) on the  
enabled track(s).

3.	 Do one of the following:
i.	
Clip Menu | Remove Match Frame Edits.
ii.	
Right-Click in the Timeline and select Remove Match Frame Edits from 
the contextual menu.
Remove Match Frame Edits In Trim Mode
Note that this method only works when the Trim Rollers are either Single (A-Side or B-Side), or 
Double/Dual (on both the A-Side and B-Side simultaneously). In other words, it does not work 
if you are in Slip or Slide.
1.	 Enter Trim Mode on a track(s) at a white Match Frame Edit or at a cut-point on a 
Filler track.
2.	 Press the Delete key.
3.	 Note that you will remain in Trim Mode. If there are no transitions with Trim Rollers 
on them, then the two monitors will display only black. Nothing is broken. Simply exit 
Trim Mode and notice that the Match Frame Edits have been removed.
Clip Mode: Setting a common Level or Pan to 
multiple segments
Overview example: imagine that you have many segments of narration (also known as Voice 
Over) on track A1. You edited them all in without making any changes to the original level they 
were recorded at. You recently added some music, ambience, and other sound effects and 
you have just adjusted one segment of Voice Over to mix better with the other audio elements. 
Now you want to make all the other Voice Over segments the same level as the one you just 
adjusted (rather than have to adjust them one by one).
How to do it...
This set of steps presumes that you have already adjusted one segment in your Sequence to 
a particular level and now want to make other segments on that same track to be the same 
level, as in the earlier Overview example.
1.	 Enable the Track Selectors for the track(s) you want to affect. In the situation 
described earlier, you would enable just track A1.

Chapter 7
251
2.	 This step is optional: Mark In and Mark Out around a portion of the segments in 
order to define a region of segments to affect. If you do not have marks, then you 
will affect all the segments on the selected track(s) from beginning to end (that is, 
global). Details on using Marks to define a range/region of Segments to affect is 
above in Clip Mode Level and Pan Adjustments.
3.	 Place your blue Position Indicator on the segment that you have already adjusted. 
You can think of this segment as the guide segment, because you're going to tell 
other segments to be at the same level (or pan) setting as that one.
4.	 Go to the Fast Menu (hamburger-looking icon) located in the top row of buttons on 
the Audio Mixer Tool.
5.	 Select Set Level On Track (or Set Pan On Track) to set other segments to the same 
level (or pan value) as the guide segment you are parked on.
How it works...
Remember these things:
f
f
For the active (enabled) track(s), the Segment that your blue Position Indicator is 
parked on is the guide Segment, and will tell the other Segments on that track(s) to 
be the same level (or pan) setting as that one.
f
f
If you have no Mark In or Mark Out, then the command will affect all the Segments 
on the enabled track(s) Globally; and you can isolate portions of the track by using 
Mark In, Mark Out, or both.
Clip Mode: Adjusting multiple segments by a 
uniform amount
Overview example: imagine that you have many segments of dialog on tracks A1 and A2. 
You edited them all in before adding other audio elements (for example, music). You have 
meticulously adjusted each segment of dialog to what you felt at the time was just the  
perfect level. Later, you added some music, ambience, and other sound effects and  
now realize the following:
f
f
The various levels you set for the dialog segments are still perfect in relation 
to each other (meaning that all the actors are at an even level, one actor is not 
disproportionately louder or quieter than another)
f
f
Now that you've added the other audio elements (music, and so on.), you need  
to adjust the dialog segments a bit louder without losing the relationship between 
them which you've already established

Manually adding and adjusting Volume and 
Pan Automation keyframes 
Before reading this recipe, you may find it helpful to first read the previous sections in this 
chapter that discuss the topics of the Audio Mixer Tool, Clip Gain & Pan vs. Volume & Pan 
Automation, Displaying Clip Gain, Volume Automation and Pan Automation in the Timeline, 
and Clip Mode Level & Pan Adjustments.
In this recipe, we'll discuss how to manually add keyframes in order to adjust Volume levels

Getting ready
The following points will be helpful when you want to make adjustments using keyframes:
f
f
Displaying Volume Automation and Pan Automation is required in order to be able 
to manually add keyframes (for example, clicking the Add Keyframe button), and 
manually adjust keyframes in Media Composer Version 5 and earlier.
f
f
Now in Avid Media Composer Version 6, you do not have to display the Volume or Pan 
Automation in order to add keyframes to a Segment when using the Audio Mixer's 
level sliders or pan knobs. This means that you will need to be more aware of the 
Clip/Auto setting of your Audio Mixer. For emphasis, if you want to add a keyframe 
by pressing the Add Keyframe button, then you still must have Volume or Pan 
Automation displayed in the Timeline.
f
f
In order to manually adjust or remove/delete keyframes, the Keyframe Selection 
Tool must be enabled (it is enabled by default). This button is located on the left-hand 
side of the Timeline Window, at the bottom of what Avid calls the Timeline Palette 
(see the white arrow in the next screenshot). If this button is not enabled, then you 
will not be able to use the cursor as described later.
f
f
You can not display Volume and Pan Automation at the same time. For emphasis, 
Volume Automation and Pan Automation changes (that is, using keyframes) can  
be applied to the same Segment, however, only one or the other can be displayed  
at a time.
f
f
When you are manually adjusting volume level keyframes in the Timeline, using the 
cursor (the hand icon), the dB level will appear in the same location as the Timeline 
View Menu (see the next screenshot):

f
f
Manually adding keyframes into the Timeline, and manually adjusting them, means 
that you will first make an adjustment and then, in a second step, play the adjusted 
region to evaluate it.
f
f
When the Audio Mix Tool is set to Auto, it is possible to record your volume and pan 
adjustments in real time. In other words, you can make the changes in real time and 
hear those changes occurring in real time. This is discussed in this chapter, in the 
Real Time Volume and Pan Adjustment recipe.
How to do it...
Let's take a look at how to manually add keyframes for Volume and Pan Automation. Media 
Composer Version 6 provides two methods for adding keyframes manually.
1.	 Open the Audio Mixer: Tools Menu | Audio Mixer.
2.	 Set the Audio Mixer to the Automation (Auto) setting, rather than the Clip or  
Live setting.
3.	 Enable the Track Selector(s) for the tracks to which you want to add keyframes.
4.	 Add a keyframe with either one of these methods:


Method 1 (without Volume or Pan Automation displayed): Make an 
adjustment using the Level Slider(s) and/or Pan Knobs. Even though  
Volume or Pan Automation is not displayed, in Version 6, you will still  
be adding a keyframe.


Method 2 (with Volume or Pan Automation displayed): You can now:
i.	
First, press the Add Keyframe button on the keyboard (by default on the 
Apostrophe key). Note that if your tracks are very narrow, this may not 
work. To make the tracks wider, use the keyboard shortcut cmd/Ctrl + L. 
To make them narrower the shortcut is cmd/Ctrl + K.
ii.	
Next, make an adjustment using either the Level Slider(s) and/or Pan 
Knob(s) on the Audio Mixer, or by grabbing the keyframes with your 
cursor and moving them manually.
Removing/Deleting Volume and Pan 
Automation Keyframes 
Media Composer provides two methods to remove/delete keyframes. The How to do it... 
section will present one method and the second method will be discussed in the There's

Follow these steps:
1.	 Make sure that the Keyframe Selection Tool is enabled (it is enabled by default). This 
button is located on the left-hand side of the Timeline Window, at the bottom of what 
Avid calls the Timeline Palette (see the white arrow in the next screenshot). If this 
button is not enabled, then you will not be able to use the cursor as described later.
2.	 Enable the Track Selector(s) for the track(s) from which you want to remove a single 
keyframe or multiple keyframes.
3.	 This is an an optional step: Mark In and Mark Out around a portion of one or more 
segments in order to define a range (or you could call it a region) of keyframes 
to remove. If you do not have In/Out Marks, then you will only be affecting one 
keyframe at a time on any enabled track.
4.	 Park your cursor arrow over a single keyframe so that the Hand Icon appears (see the 
next screenshot). You do not have to click on the keyframe, only to park your cursor 
over it to make the Hand Icon appear. This is important because if you do not see the 
hand icon, then Media Composer will think you want to delete the entire track itself, 
rather than just a keyframe(s) on that track(s).

Real Time Volume and Pan Adjustment 
When you make adjustments to pan or volume level using the Audio Mixer set to Clip Mode, 
or by manually adding and adjusting keyframes, you do not get instant feedback about how 
well that adjustment sounds. In other words, you first make an adjustment and then, in a 
second step, you go back and play the section you just adjusted in order to listen to it and 
evaluate it.
However, using the method discussed in this recipe, you'll be able to make level and pan 
adjustments while Avid Media Composer is actually playing, and you'll also be able to hear  
the result of those adjustments immediately in Real Time. Additionally, while you're making 
those adjustments, Media Composer is recording them as keyframes and you can adjust  
them after the recording is completed if you need to.
This recipe will be covering how to use the Media Composer software to accomplish Real 
Time Volume and Pan Adjustment. However, it's also good to know that it's possible to  
attach certain hardware mixers (for example, Avid's Command 8 mixer) that allow you to  
make adjustments, by physically moving faders on the attached mixer, and have those 
adjustments translated into keyframes and applied to your Sequence in Real Time.
How to do it...
1.	 Open the Audio Mixer: Tools Menu | Audio Mixer.
2.	 Set the Audio Mixer to Automation Mode (Auto), rather than Clip Mode or  
Live Mode. An overview of the Audio Mixer can be found in the previous 
Understanding the Audio Mixer Tool – Auto Mode recipe.
3.	 Display Volume or Pan Automation. While this is not required to record volume  
level and pan adjustments in Real Time, I think you'll find it helpful.
4.	 Enter a value in the Preroll entry box (for example, 5 = 5 seconds). This tells  
Media Composer an amount of time to back up and play before actually beginning 
the recording process. This will give you some time to move your cursor from the 
Record Button to a level slider or pan knob, and to get your bearings before needing 
to make adjustments.
5.	 This step is optional: Enter a value in the Postroll entry box. This tells Media 
Composer an amount of time to continue to play after the recording process  
has actually stopped. This only applies if there is a Mark Out in the Sequence  
(Marks are discussed in more detail in the How it works... section).

6.	 Determine the area you want to perform Volume or Pan Automation recording. To do 
this, you can do any of the following:


Have no Mark In or Mark Out placed in your Sequence: If there are no 
marks, then Media Composer will consider wherever your blue Position 
Indicator is placed to be the spot where you want to begin recording. In  
this situation, you will have to manually stop the recording process 
(discussed later in this recipe).


Place only a Mark In: Just as with placing no marks, you will have to manually 
stop the recording process. Placing a Mark In tells Media Composer exactly 
where you want to begin recording, as well as protects any keyframes that 
already exist before the Mark In from being accidentally recorded over and 
also, marks that spot to make it easy to repeat the recording process, if the 
first attempt didn't produce a good result.


Place only a Mark Out: This tells Media Composer exactly where to stop the 
recording process, as well as protects any keyframes that already exist after 
the Mark Out from being accidentally recorded over.


Mark a Region: Place both a Mark In and a Mark Out to define a specific 
region for recording.
7.	
Click the Record button to begin the recording process. The Record button 
(with a red dot in the center) is in the top, left corner of the Audio Mixer.
8.	 The Record button will blink red to tell you when the recording process is  
in progress.
9.	 You can manually stop the recording process at any time by:


Clicking the Record button – This stops the recording process and keeps  
any keyframes you recorded during that pass.


Clicking the Trash Can Icon (Avid calls it the Cancel button) – If during the 
recording process you want to stop and also have Media Composer throw 
away the keyframes that were recorded during that pass, you can click the 
Trash Can Icon.
How it works…
During the recording process, Media Composer creates many keyframes as you adjust the 
pan knobs and/or the volume sliders. You may need to zoom in on the Timeline (for example, 
using More Detail) to actually see all the keyframes.

Second, Mark In/Out around a region of keyframes you would like to reduce.


Third, go to the Fast Menu (hamburger) at the top of the Audio Mixer.


Lastly, select Filter Volume Automation or Filter Pan Automation, 
depending on your situation. Each time you select either of these from the 
Fast Menu, approximately 10 percent of the keyframes are removed and the 
graphing is simplified. Repeat this as many times as desired. Once the graph 
reaches its most simple form, then no more keyframes will be removed.
Creating Stereo, 5.1 and 7.1 ("Multichannel") 
Tracks in a Sequence
Before we dive into the recipes, let's go over some information about the differences between 
Mono tracks and Stereo tracks in a Sequence:
f
f
At the time of writing, Media Composer provides up to 24 audio tracks in a Sequence 
and provides the ability to hear any 16 of the displayed 24 tracks. In Avid ProTools 
lingo, they'd say that there are 24 tracks and 16 Voices. For most of us, 16 tracks are 
enough. For those that need to output more, they can perform an Audio Mixdown 
(also known as Bouncing Tracks in the audio mixing world). Audio Mixdown is a 
selection from the Special Menu.
f
f
Avid refers to Clips and Tracks that are Stereo, 5.1 and 7.1 as being Multichannel.
f
f
Clips and their Audio Tracks can be Mono, Stereo, 5.1 Surround Sound, or 7.1 
Surround Sound. A recipe a bit later in this chapter discusses how to create 
Multichannel Clips.

You can have any combination of track-types in a Sequence.

Only Mono elements can be edited onto Mono tracks, Stereo elements onto Stereo 
tracks, and so on.

In Version 6, Media Composer relates the track type with an icon or text placed  
on the Audio Track Selector (see the next screenshot):
Now that you have an overview of Multichannel tracks, let's look at the two methods to create 
Multichannel tracks in a Sequence.
How to do it...
This is the first method you can add a Multichannel track to a Sequence:
1.	 Create a new Sequence, or load an existing Sequence into the Timeline Window.
2.	 Go to Clip Menu.
3.	 Select New Audio Track.
4.	 From the Submenu, select Mono, Stereo, 5.1 Surround, or 7.1 Surround.
You can also add a Multichannel track to a Sequence this way:
1.	 Create a new Sequence, or load an existing Sequence into the Timeline Window.
2.	 Right-click in the Timeline Window.
3.	 Select New Audio Track.
4.	 From the Submenu, select Mono, Stereo, 5.1 Surround, or 7.1 Surround.

Converting a multichannel track into mono 
tracks in a Sequence
First, it's important to note that you can convert a Multichannel track into separate mono 
tracks, but you can not do the reverse.
You can convert a Multichannel track(s) into separate mono tracks in two ways. The first 
method allows you to convert specific tracks, individually, while the second method will 
convert all the tracks in the Sequence.
How to do it...
This first method will let you convert individual Multichannel tracks into separate Mono tracks.
1.	 Duplicate the Sequence(s) before converting tracks. To do this, first select the 
Sequence(s) in the bin. Then go to Edit Menu | Duplicate. Lastly, amend the 
Sequence name(s) to indicate which is Multichannnel and which is Mono.
2.	 Make sure the correct Sequence is loaded in the Record Monitor/Timeline  
(that is, the one that is to have a Multichannel track converted to mono tracks).
3.	 In the Timeline, right-click on the Track Selector of the Multichannel track you want 
to convert.
4.	 From the Contextual Menu that appears, select Split Track To Mono.
This second method is a fast way to convert all of the Multichannel tracks in a Sequence(s) 
into separate Mono tracks:
1.	 In a bin, select the Sequence(s) for which you want to have all the Multichannel 
tracks converted into individual Mono tracks.
2.	 Go to: Clip Menu | Split All Tracks To Mono.
3.	 Media Composer will automatically create a duplicate Sequence and convert 
all Multichannel tracks to individual Mono tracks.
4.	 Amend the Sequence name(s) to indicate which are Multichannnel and which are 
Mono.

Making Multichannel Clips  
(Stereo, 5.1 and 7.1)
A Clip can have all its audio tracks as separate Mono tracks, or you can have a clip with two 
or more audio tracks interpreted by Media Composer as Stereo, 5.1 Surround Sound, or 
7.1 Surround Sound. With regard to Stereo Clips, the benefit is rather than have two mono 
channels (Left and Right) take up two tracks in the Sequence, you can have the Stereo 
pair take up just one track. In Sequences with many Stereo elements (for example, music, 
ambiance, layers of sound effects, and so on) this means that if you treat them as one Stereo 
track, rather than two mono tracks, you'll have more space available. Further, you may find 
that adjusting volume level is faster and easier as well.
As I mentioned, at the beginning of this chapter, my discussions in this book will be focusing 
on Mono and Stereo Clips and Tracks, though in this instance the same methods used to 
make Stereo Clips can also be used to make 5.1 and 7.1 Surround Sound clips.
The recipe itself will present how to convert Mono Clips into Multichannel Clips after they 
have been Captured or Imported. In the There's more... section we'll take look at how to 
instruct Media Composer to make Clips Multichannel during the Capture and/or Import.
Getting ready
If you haven't already read the previous Creating Stereo, 5.1 and 7.1 ("Multichannel") Tracks In 
A Sequence recipe, you may find it helpful either before or after reading this section.
How to do it...
Here we'll focus on making Mono Clips into Multichannel Clips after they have been 
Captured or Imported. Note that Clips can be modified at any time to be either mono  
or multichannel:
1.	 Import or Capture your file(s) into a bin.
2.	 Select the clip(s) you want to affect.
3.	 Go to: Clip Menu | Modify (you may also right-click on the selected clips and  
choose Modify).
4.	 The Modify dialog window opens.
5.	 From the pull-down menu, select Set Multichannel Audio.
6.	 From the menu below the tracks, configure how you want the audio tracks to be 
interpreted by Media Composer.
7.	
Click OK.
8.	 This step is optional: Display the Track Formats column in the bin to indicate which 
clips are Stereo, 5.1 Surround, or 7.1 Surround.

The recipe focused on how to convert Clips after they have been Captured or Imported.  
Now we'll take a look at how to have Clips automatically configured to the Mutlichannel  
setting that you prefer during the Import or Capture process.
Making Multichannel Clips During Import
1.	 Open the Import Settings: Project Window | Settings tab and double-click  
Import settings.
2.	 Select the Audio tab.
3.	 In the section labeled Multichannel Audio, click the button labeled Edit.
4.	 The Set Multichannel Audio dialog window opens.
5.	 From the menu below the tracks, select how you want the audio tracks to  
be interpreted by Media Composer during import.
6.	 Click OK. Now when you import clips containing audio, they will automatically be 
configured as you've just set.
7.	
This step is optional: Display the Track Formats column in the bin to indicate which 
clips are Stereo, 5.1 Surround, or 7.1 Surround.
Making Multichannel Clips During Capture
1.	 Open the Capture Tool.
2.	 From the Audio Channel Grouping menu below the audio track selectors, select 
how you want the audio tracks to be interpreted by Media Composer. Now when you 
capture clips containing audio they will automatically be configured as you've just set.
3.	 This step is optional: Display the Track Formats column in the bin to indicate which 
clips are Stereo, 5.1 Surround, or 7.1 Surround.
Using AudioSuite Plug-ins
The AudioSuite provides plug-in effects that are applied to individual Segments, and they must 
be rendered in order to play. On the other hand, RTAS Plug-In effects (discussed later in this 
chapter) are applied to audio tracks and they affect every Segment on that track. Additionally, 
they do not require rendering.
While the AudioSuite Plug-Ins are definitely useful, they have one potential drawback in that 
they are not easily combined (you must perform an Audio Mixdown found in the Special 
Menu and apply the second effect to the newly created Master Clip), whereas you can place 
as many as five RTAS plug-ins on a track.

How to do it…
Now that you have an overview of the AudioSuite Window, let's take a look at how to apply, 
adjust, and modify the AudioSuite plug-in effects.
1.	 Enable the Track Selector(s) in the Timeline for the track(s) you want to place an 
AudioSuite Plug-In onto.
2.	 Place your blue Position Indicator over the Segment(s) you want to affect.
3.	 Open the AudioSuite: Tools Menu | AudioSuite.
4.	 Select a Plug-In from the Plug-In Selection Menu. By default this pull-down menu 
will say None.
5.	 After selecting a plug-in from the list, it will be applied to the Segment on each 
enabled track.
6.	 Access the Plug-In's controls. Click the large, purplish icon that resembles a three-
pronged electrical socket. This will open the parameters window. Note that each plug-
in will have its own unique interface and parameters.
7.	
Click the Preview Button to test the effect before rendering. Note that some plug-ins 
are too complex to fully preview their effects, so you will need to render to test the 
complete effect.
8.	 This step is optional: While the Preview is in progress you can use the Bypass button 
to hear the Segment with or without the effect applied.
9.	 Click the Render button to create the media with the effect baked in to allow it to 
playback in real time.
10.	 To later modify an AudioSuite effect that has already been applied to a Segment you 
will take the following steps: 
i.	
First, enable the Track Selector(s) in the Timeline for the track(s) that 
contain an AudioSuite Plug-In you want to modify. 
ii.	
Second, place your blue Position Indicator over the Segment(s) you 
want to affect. Next, open the AudioSuite Window: Tools Menu | 
AudioSuite. 
iii.	 Now you can access the Plug-In's controls by clicking the large, purplish 
icon that resembles a three-pronged electrical socket, which will open 
the parameters window.

Removing AudioSuite plug-ins
There are three methods available to remove AudioSuite plug-ins. The recipe will focus on one 
method, while the There's more... section will provide two additional methods.

AudioSuite Plug-In that you want to remove.
2.	 Park the blue Position Indicator on the Segment(s) with AudioSuite Plug-in to  
be removed.
3.	 Click the Remove Effect button (which resembles the octagonal Stop sign in the U.S 
with a Slash through it). By default, the Remove Effect button can be found  
in these locations:


In the Fast Menu Tool Palette, located between the yellow Splice arrow and 
the red Overwrite arrow

Now, let's discuss two additional methods to remove AudioSuite plug-ins. The first uses the 
AudioSuite window, while the second uses Segment Mode.
Using The AudioSuite Window to remove effects
This method is best used to remove multiple effects.
1.	 Open the AudioSuite: Tools Menu | AudioSuite.
2.	 Enable a Track Selector(s) in the Timeline or select a track from the AudioSuite 
Window's Track Selection Menu.
3.	 Go to: Fast Menu (hamburger) at the top of the AudioSuite Window.
4.	 Select Remove AudioSuite Plug-Ins On Enabled Tracks. Note that without placing 
a Mark In and Mark Out, you will be removing all the plug-ins on the track from 
beginning to end (that is, Global).

Using Segment Mode to remove effects
This method is good for removing either single effects or multiple effects:
1.	 Enable either the Lift/Overwrite (red) or the Extract/Splice-In (yellow)  
Segment Mode Arrow. It doesn't matter which you enable; it's just being  
used as a way to make a selection.
2.	 Select one or more Segments containing AudioSuite Plug-Ins. Multiple Segments 
can be selected by using the Shift key.
3.	 Once the Segment(s) are selected, press the Delete key.
Saving and Applying AudioSuite Templates
If you're going to be using a particular effect frequently, or if you want to save a particular 
combination of settings before experimenting with alternate adjustments, you can save a 
template of the effect in a bin for use at any time in the future.
How to do it…
1.	 Click and hold on the Effect Icon located in the top-left corner of the AudioSuite 
window. The icon is a smaller version of the purplish icon that resembles a three-
pronged electrical socket.
2.	 Drag that icon to any open bin and release the mouse button.
3.	 To later apply the effect, simply drag-and-drop it from the bin onto a 
Segment(s).
4.	 Render the effect. Note that you may have to first open the AudioSuite in order 
to launch the software components that process the AudioSuite effects. The 
components are part of what is called the Digidesign Audio Engine (DAE). You can 
render the effect using any method you like, including:


Clicking the Render Effect Button (located, by default on the Timeline  
Tool Bar)


Right-clicking in the Timeline and selecting either Render at Position  
or Render In/Out


If the AudioSuite is open, you may use the Render button there
Using Real Time Audio Suite (RTAS) Plug-Ins
The RTAS plug-in effects are different from the AudioSuite plug-ins in three ways. First, as 
their name implies, they do not require rendering. Secondly, the RTAS plug-ins affect entire 
tracks, rather than individual Segments. And lastly, you can apply up to five RTAS effects to  
a track at one time.

3.	 In the RTAS Tool, select a Track from the pull-down menu. Note that RTAS 
are applied just one track at a time.
4.	 Select an Insert to place the Plug-In (that is, a though e). As a reminder, the 
RTAS plug-in effects are processed in order from a to e and you may get different 
results depending on the order of effects.
5.	 From the Select Plug-In pull-down menu, choose an effect category, and then a 
specific effect from that category's submenu. 
6.	 Once the plug-in is applied, the parameter controls window for that effect will  
open and you may make adjustments. The adjustments are immediately applied,  
and you can play the Sequence with or without the RTAS Tool open.
7.	
To later modify a RTAS plug-in, you can follow either of these methods: 


Method 1: First, open the RTAS Tool. Second, select a Track from the  
Pull-down menu. Third, select the insert containing the effect you want to 
modify. Lastly, once the insert is selected, the parameter controls window  
for that effect will open and you will be able to make modifications.


Method 2: First, open the Track Control Panel to reveal the five RTAS  
plug-in Insert buttons. Second, click on the Insert button containing the 
plug-in you want to modify. After clicking on the Insert button, the RTAS  
Tool will open and the controls for that plug-in will be displayed.

2.	 In the RTAS Tool, Select a Track from the pull-down menu.
3.	 Select an insert (that is, a though e).
4.	 From the Select Plug-In pull-down menu, choose No Insert.
This second method will let you remove all of the RTAS effects from a track in one step:
5.	 Right-click on an Audio Track Selector and choose RTAS Effects.
6.	 From the Submenu, select Remove All.
Saving and Applying RTAS Effect Templates
If you'd like to save a particular RTAS effect for later use, or if you want to save a particular 
combination of settings before experimenting with alternate adjustments, you can save a 
template of the effect.
How to do it…
There are two methods available to save an RTAS Effect Template. The first method utilizes 
the RTAS Tool.
1.	 In the RTAS Tool, on the top-right side, you will see a small, purplish icon that 
resembles a three-pronged electrical socket. This is the Save Effect icon.  
Click-and-hold onto that icon.
2.	 As you hold down the mouse button, move your cursor over to any open bin. 
3.	 Once you're over a bin, you'll see that your arrow cursor icon has changed to a hand 
icon. You can now release the mouse button to drop the Effect Template into the bin.
4.	 The Template can be applied directly from the bin using the same methods discussed 
above in the There's more... section of the Applying RTAS Plug-ins from the Effect 
Palette recipe.
The second method available to save a RTAS Effect Template is directly from a RTAS Insert 
button in the Track Control Panel.
1.	 Open the Track Control Panel to reveal the five RTAS Insert buttons using either of 
these methods:


Go to Timeline Window Fast Menu (hamburger) in the bottom-left corner of 
the Timeline Window | Track Control Panel


Click the small, black disclosure triangle found in the top-left of the Timeline 
Window, next to the Timecode display
2.	 Click-and-hold on any of the five RTAS Insert buttons that contains an effect.

3.	 As you hold the mouse button down, move your cursor over to any open bin. 
4.	 Once you're over a bin, you'll see that your arrow cursor icon has changed to a  
hand icon. You can now release the mouse button to drop the Effect Template  
into the bin.
Copying RTAS Effects between Tracks
Rather than first having to make an RTAS Effect Template (as discussed earlier), and then 
apply that template to another track, it is possible to copy a RTAS effect and place it onto 
another track directly.
How to do it…
1.	 You must open the Track Control Panel to reveal the five RTAS Insert buttons.  
You can do this using either of these methods:


Go to Timeline Window Fast Menu (hamburger) in the bottom-left corner  
of the Timeline Window | Track Control Panel

Introduction
In the past, the most common use of shooting with multiple cameras was during the taping 
of television shows (for example, sitcoms and variety shows), sporting events, and concerts 
in order to capture different angles and shots of the same event at the same time. Now that 
cameras have become less expensive and smaller, more and more productions are shot using 
multiple cameras. Just a few examples include documentaries, music videos, and reality 
television shows.

Editing with Group Clips and MultiCamera Mode
278
For an editor, having more creative choices is always welcomed. However, the issues that 
come up are how do we sync up all the different cameras, and how do we edit with footage 
from multiple cameras in an efficient way? That's what we'll cover within this chapter. Also, be 
aware that there is additional information about Multicamera editing available in Appendix C, 
Helpful Details about MultiCamera Editing.
Media Composer helps us to edit with footage from multiple cameras by allowing us to create 
a single clip that refers to many Master Clips. This single clip is referred to as a Group Clip, 
and the process of making a Group Clip is referred to as Grouping.
Before you create the Group Clips, you have to have a way to sync the different cameras' 
footage together. In the beginning of this chapter, we'll look at three ways in which you can sync 
source clips (Master Clips and/or Subclips) in order to create Group Clips (and/or MultiGroup 
Clips if all your clips share common Timecode, and that timecode is sequential). The three 
methods presented are some of the more common methods, but not the only methods. 
We'll start with the easiest and fastest method and progress to the one which is a bit more 
challenging and definitely more time consuming.
Syncing and Grouping clips with common 
timecode
This is syncing and Grouping method number one of three presented in this chapter. It refers 
to syncing and creating Group Clips (also known as Grouping) when all the footage shares the 
exact same timecode. This is frequently referred to as Common or Jam-Synced timecode.
This is the fastest and easiest method as long as the production prepared properly before 
shooting. See Appendix C, Helpful Details about MultiCamera Editing and the There's more  
section for additional details.
Getting ready
For this recipe, we'll use the example of a narrative television show (commonly a situation 
comedy) that was shot with four cameras: A, B, C, and D. In actuality, in television, the fourth 
camera is generally labeled as X, which I presume is to avoid confusion between cameras 
B and D during a live production when the Director tells the Technical Director (in the UK 
referred to as the Vision Switcher) which camera to switch to.

This recipe presumes that:
f
f
All the cameras shared common timecode.
f
f
All the footage is of the same frame rate.
f
f
Each camera's Master Clips have been placed into their own separate bins during 
the capture process. In other words, you have four bins for your footage, one for 
camera A, one for camera B, and so on. While this is not required, it is good for 
organization.
f
f
Each Clip has been named in some consistent fashion to reference which camera 
recorded it. Examples of labeling might be:


18A/1 (meaning: Scene 18, Camera A/Take 1)


18/1_A (meaning: Scene 18/Take 1 – Camera A)


18/A (meaning: for an interview, Question 18/Camera A)
How to do it...
This recipe refers to the situation presented in the Getting ready section:
1.	 Create a new bin for each scene. This bin will be where you'll place copies of your 
Master Clips of all the footage for that scene, and also create the Group Clips. Name 
the bin along the lines of Scene 18 Group Clips.
2.	 Open the individual bins of footage for each camera.
3.	 Copy the clips (using your preferred method) into the bin you made in step 1. I choose 
to use the Clone method, since I find it to be a faster process, and I don't like having 
.copy added to the end of a Duplicated clip. To Clone a clip, you will option/Alt + 
Drag it into the Scene 18 Groups bin. More information on the differences between 
Duplicating and Cloning clips can be found in the Mixing frame rates recipe in 
Chapter 1, Getting Assets into Your Media Composer Project.
4.	 Repeat the copying process for all the different cameras' clips from Scene 18, placing 
them all into the Scene 18 Groups bin.

5.	 A suggested option is to perform a sort of the Name column to quickly place the clips 
into sets of clips that will be grouped together (see the next screenshot), and also to 
place them in alphabetical order. To sort a column, one method is to right-click on the 
column header (in this case the word Name). A contextual menu will be displayed, 
and you can select Sort Ascending (A to Z) or Sort Descending (Z to A). The result of 
my ascending-sort of the clips is seen in the next screenshot:
Having the clips in take order and alphabetical order will make it easier to figure 
out which clips need to be grouped together, since all the clips from Take 1 will be 
together, Take 2 will be together, and so on. Further, it can be helpful when you get to 
the editing stage and are viewing multiple angles simultaneously in either the Quad 
Split or 9 Split display because the clips are initially displayed in the same order in 
which they were grouped (for example, Camera A, then Camera B, and so on).

6.	 There are two choices listed in this step:


If you are creating Group Clips individually (one at a time), then move on to 
step 7.


If you are working on a situation comedy television program, or a similar 
type of production, where multiple takes of each scene were recorded 
sequentially, then follow the next steps to create a MultiGroup Clip as well 
as individual Group Clips all in one step:
i.	
Select all the clips in the bin that are to be MultiGrouped.
ii.	
Go to Bin menu | MultiGroup.
iii.	 A dialog window will open.
iv.	 In the top section titled Sync Clips Using, select Source 
Timecode and click OK.
v.	
Media Composer will then create one MultiGroup Clip, as 
well as the individual Group Clips that are contained within 
the MultiGroup Clip. For example, if you had four takes for 
Scene 18, then Media Composer would create one MultiGroup 
Clip that contains takes 1 through 4, as well as an individual 
Group Clip for Take 1, an individual Group Clip for Take 2, 
and so on. This gives you the flexibility to edit with either the 
MultiGroup Clip, or the individual Group Clips. The benefits of 
the MultiGroup Clip are that all the footage for that scene is 
available in one clip, and that you can jump from take to take 
in the Source Window using the Fast Forward and Rewind 
buttons.
vi.	 Rename the MultiGroup Clip to reflect its contents. In this 
example, I'd rename it 18/1,2,3,4. This completes the 
Grouping process. 
7.	
Select the clips to be grouped together (for example, in this example, we would first 
select only clips 18/1_A, 18/1_B, 18/1_C, and 18/1_D).
8.	 Go to Bin Menu | Group Clips (or use the keyboard shortcut Shift + cmd/Ctrl + G). A 
dialog window will open.
9.	 In the top section titled Sync Clips Using, select Source Timecode and click OK.
10.	 Media Composer creates a Group Clip and places it at the top of the bin.
11.	 Repeat steps 7 through 10 for any and all additional takes.
12.	Rename the Group Clips. By default, the Group Clip gets its name from the first clip 
in the Group, and it gets appended with .Grp.01. I prefer to have the name of the 
Group Clip be simplified to 18/1, 18/2, and so on.

There's more...
You should explain to the producers that a small bit of preparation can (and will) save a lot of 
time in the editing process; and as we all know, time is equal to money. During production, if 
the camera team can do the following, it will save a good deal of time for the editorial team:
f
f
The cameras should be set to generate Timecode based on the time of day (rather 
than the setting which is called Record Run). This is often referred to as TOD or Free 
Run Timecode. 
f
f
Make sure that all the cameras or decks are forced to record using the exact same 
timecode. This is often referred to as Jam-Syncing. This can be done by either 
feeding (supplying) the same timecode from a single timecode generator to all the 
cameras or decks (as is often the case in studio productions), or cameras can be 
Jam-Synced with one camera acting as the main camera which tells the others what 
their timecode should be (this is sometimes referred to as the cameras being master 
and slaves). With regard to cameras in the field, this timecode syncing process can 
usually be done without having to keep all the cameras connected together with 
cables. Instead, they can be synced at the beginning of the shooting day. As there is 
the possibility that the timecode will drift from camera-to-camera throughout the day, 
it is advisable to re-sync the cameras several times each shoot day.
f
f
If at all possible, make sure the camera operators start and stop recording at 
approximately the same time. In the scheme of things, Tape and/or SSD card space 
is cheap. Assure the camera team that it's okay that they continue recording while 
they are repositioning, recomposing, and focusing. It will save a good deal of time and 
frustration in post production if they do not frequently stop and start recording during 
an event. For emphasis, in a perfect situation, all the camera operators will stop 
and start at about the same time for each take. If there will be very long takes, then 
it may be necessary to stagger the starting and stopping of each camera (or deck), 
so that none of the event goes unrecorded. But again, the operators should record 
continuously until directed to stop.

Syncing and Grouping Clips with common 
reference points
This is syncing and Grouping method number two of three that are presented in this chapter. 
If it is not possible to have all the cameras record the exact same timecode (as discussed 
in the previous recipe), then the next best thing is to make sure that all the cameras share 
a common sync reference point (for example, a Clapper Slate), and making sure that the 
camera operators recorded each take continuously (meaning that all the camera operators 
started and stopped recording at approximately the same time for each take).
The best case in this situation would be that the production team used a Clapper Slate (or a 
utility on an iPad or similar device) to provide a common sync reference point. This recipe will 
use the example of four cameras where:
f
f
All the cameras began recording at approximately the same time.
f
f
Once recording, all the camera operators pointed their cameras to a Camera 
Assistant holding a Clapper Slate.
f
f
Once the camera operators had framed up a good, clear image of the slate, the 
Camera Assistant clapped the slate (banged the top portion down onto the bottom 
portion), providing both a visual and an audible sync reference point for use in  
post production.
f
f
All the cameras recorded continuously for each take until instructed to stop.
f
f
Each Camera's Master Clips have been placed into their own separate bins during 
the capture process. In other words, you have four bins for your footage, one for 
Camera A, one for Camera B, and so on.

Each Clip has been named in some consistent fashion to reference which camera 
recorded it. Examples of labeling might be:

How to do it...
Now that you have performed steps as directed in the previous Getting ready section, we 
can now begin the syncing and Grouping process. The following steps presume that you have 
placed Duplicates or Clones of all the clips you want to Sync and Group into a common bin. 
1.	 An optional step is to enable Waveform Display: Timeline Window Fast Menu 
(bottom-left corner of the Timeline Window) | Audio Data | Waveforms.
2.	 Another optional step is to display Source material in the Timeline Window by 
enabling the Toggle Source/Record In Timeline function. This is located, by default, 
in the bottom-left corner of the Timeline window and next to the Video Quality Menu. 
When you are viewing Source Material in the Timeline Window, Media Composer 
changes the color of the Position Indicator in the Timeline to green and the icon for 
Toggle Source/Record In Timeline will also be green.
3.	 A third optional step is to enable Digital Scrubbing by pressing the Caps Lock key, 
and make sure that it is active. Now when you move your Position Indictor, you will 
hear audio as well. This will allow you to hear the Clapper Slate being clapped.
4.	 Load the first Master Clip or Subclip into the Source Window (for example, in this 
example, we would load shot 18/1_A).
5.	 Locate the general area where the slate is clapped together.
6.	 Move one frame at a time by using the Step Forward and Step Backward functions 
(by default located on the 3 and 4 keys), to find the exact point when the slate is 
clapped. In other words, the exact point when the top portion of the slate first makes 
contact with the bottom portion.
7.	
Place a Mark In on the clip at the point described in step 6.
8.	 You have now created a sync reference for Media Composer. Repeat steps 4, 5, 6, 
and 7 for the remaining clips to be grouped together. In this example, we'd repeat the 
process on shots 18/1_B, 18/1_C, and 18/1_D.
9.	 Now that all the clips to be Grouped have a Mark In at the exact same point when 
the slate was clapped together: Select all the clips to be Grouped. In this example, we 
select four clips: 18/1_A, 18/1_B, 18/1_C, and 18/1_D.
10.	 Go to Bin Menu | Group Clips (or use the keyboard shortcut Shift + cmd/Ctrl + G). A 
dialog window will open.
11.	 In the top section titled Sync Clips Using, select Inpoints. Click on OK.
12.	Media Composer creates a Group Clip and places it at the top of the bin.
13.	Repeat the previous steps for any and all additional takes.
14.	 The last optional step is to rename the Group Clips. By default, the Group Clip gets 
its name from the first clip in the Group, and it gets appended with .Grp.01. I prefer 
to have the name of the Group Clip be simplified to 18/1, 18/2, and so on.

Creating a syncing Sequence for syncing 
and grouping clips
This is syncing and Grouping method number three of three that are presented in this chapter.
This manual syncing method may be the solution for you if:
f
f
The footage does not share common timecode
f
f
There is no visible sync reference (for example, a Clapper Slate, someone setting down 
a glass, and so on) within the video for one or more of the multiple camera angles
f
f
All the cameras recorded the same audio (this is the crucial, key requirement to use 
this method)
f
f
Possibly (because this is not a requirement to use this method), you had a camera 
operator(s) that started and stopped recording multiple times within a take
Getting ready
First, you will want to map the Match Frame function to at least one of these locations:
f
f
Below the Record Monitor
f
f
On the Timeline Toolbar
f
f
On the keyboard
Details on mapping buttons can be found in the Mapping buttons and menu selections recipe 
in Chapter 2, Customizing Your Work Environment.
Let's start by taking a look at the key concepts of this method, which relies on using the 
Match Frame function. When you use the Match Frame function from the Sequence, then 
Media Composer will do the following:
f
f
Load the Source Clip into the Source Window.
f
f
Whatever frame you are positioned upon in the Sequence will be the same frame that 
you will be positioned upon in the Source Window (that's why it's called the Match 
Frame function).
f
f
Media Composer will automatically place a Mark In on the matched-frame in the 
Source Window.
f
f
Any location/common sync point within synced clips in the Sequence can be used 
when using this method. It does not have to be the beginning or end.

f
f
The Grouping function can (and will) be instructed to pay attention to the Mark In 
points on the clips as sync reference points.
f
f
If a camera operator(s) started and stopped multiple times (each at different times) 
within a take, you will have to create multiple Group Clips for each common section 
of the take.
Next, it will be helpful to look at an overview of the workflow: 
1.	 Create a sequence with the clips you want to sync.
2.	 Stack the clips to be synced onto different tracks and visually align the waveforms of 
the clips in the Sequence.
3.	 Use the Match Frame function on all the clips to establish a common sync point on 
each source clip (Master Clip or Subclip).
4.	 Group the Clips.
5.	 An optional step is to use the Syncing Sequence as a guide and add in the Group Clips.
6.	 Note that once you get familiar with the essential aspects of this recipe/process, you 
will undoubtedly make adjustments that better suit your specific needs.
Lastly, before we get to the recipe of steps, I want to point out that to help illustrate the 
process, I will reference a fictitious sit-down interview where:
f
f
There were four cameras during production:


Camera A: Interviewer


Camera B: Interview Subject 1 (President Barack Obama)


Camera C: Interview Subject 2 (First Lady Michelle Obama)


Camera D: Roams between a two-Shot of the Interview Subjects and a  
Wide-Shot that includes both the Interviewer and the Subjects
f
f
All the cameras recorded the same audio on at least one channel.
f
f
There is no common timecode or a Clapper Slate to help with the syncing/Grouping.
f
f
The camera operators were conscientious, and made sure to stop and start their 
cameras at approximately the same times for each interview question. Note that in 
a real situation, the camera operators would more likely let their cameras record for 
multiple questions and for many minutes at a time. I'm just using this scenario to help 
illustrate the process. 
f
f
Each Camera's Master Clips have been placed into their own separate bins during 
the capture process. In other words: You have four bins for your footage, one for 
Camera A, one for Camera B, and so on.
f
f
You have labeled the Master Clips for each question and answer in the following 
fashion: Q1A (meaning: Question 1, Camera A), Q1B, Q1C, and Q1D. Of course then, 
the second question and answer Master Clips would be labeled as Q2A, Q2B, Q2C, 
and Q2D.

How to do it…
Now we'll go through the process of syncing and then Grouping the footage:
1.	 Please take a moment to:


Review the information in the Getting ready section


Then, begin by following steps 1 through 5 in the earlier recipe titled Syncing 
and Grouping clips with common timecode
2.	 At this point you will have Duplicates or Clones of your clips all together in a common 
bin. With the bin active, create a new Sequence: Clip Menu | New Sequence. Name 
it something along the lines of Scene 18 Syncing, or Obamas Interview Syncing.
3.	 Enable Waveform Display: Timeline Window Fast Menu (bottom-left corner of the 
Timeline Window) | Audio Data | Waveforms.
4.	 An optional step is to enable Digital Scrubbing. Press the Caps Lock key, and make 
sure that it is active. Now when you move your Position Indictor in either the Source 
Window or within the Sequence, you will hear audio as well.
5.	 Load the first clip into the Source Window. In this example, I'd load clip Q1A.
6.	 Locate the beginning of a word that you know has been recorded by all the cameras. 
In this example, let's pretend that our Interviewer begins by saying, "Welcome viewers. 
I'm fortunate today to be speaking with President Barack Obama and the First Lady, 
Michelle Obama." The letter "P" in President is a good clear sound that you can use 
as a reference (see the tip box at the end of this recipe for additional details). So, 
place a Mark In just a tiny bit before the interviewer says the "P" in President. Don't 
worry about being overly precise. 
7.	
Edit this clip into the Syncing Sequence, making sure that you include the audio that 
is common to all of the clips. In this example, we would edit clip Q1A onto tracks V1 
and A1.
8.	 An optional step is to trim the Head (the beginning) of the segment longer, so that the 
entire clip is represented in the Sequence (this depends on your preferred method for 
aligning the segments, which is covered in step 16).
9.	 Load the next clip into the Source Window. In this example, we would load clip Q1B. 
Just as we did before, with clip Q1A, we'll place a Mark In just a tiny bit before the 
Interviewer says the P in President.
10.	 In the Sequence, place a Mark In just a bit before the Interviewer says the "P" in 
President.
11.	 Edit the Source clip into the Syncing Sequence, making sure that you include the 
audio that is common to all of the clips. In this example, I would edit clip Q1B onto 
tracks V2 and A2.

12.	An optional step is to trim the Head (the beginning) of the segment longer, so that the 
entire clip is represented in the Sequence (this depends on your preferred method for 
aligning the segments, which is covered in step 16).
13.	Repeat steps 9 through 12 for all of the remaining clips that you want to sync. In this 
example, we would repeat this process on clips Q1C and Q1D. We would edit clip 
Q1C onto tracks V3 and A3, and clip Q1D onto V4 and A4. Note that once you are 
familiar with this method/recipe, you may very well find that you really only need to 
edit the audio tracks into the Sequence, depending on your needs.
14.	 At this point, you should have the following:


All the clips to be synced have been edited into the Sequence, and very 
roughly aligned. In this example, we used the letter "P" in "President" as the 
guide for roughly syncing the clips.


The Waveforms displayed on all tracks.
15.	Suggested options:


Make the audio tracks wider. One method to do this is to enable just the 
Track Selectors for the audio tracks. In this example, we'd enable just A1, 
A2, A3, and A4. Then, use the keyboard shortcut cmd/Ctrl + L as many 
times as you like to increase their width. Note that this command is located 
within the Edit Menu, and that you can reduce the width of the track(s) with 
cmd/Ctrl + K. 


Make the Waveform Display larger or smaller as needed to make it easier to 
see them and to eventually align them visually. Enable the Track Selector(s) 
for whichever track's waveform you want to adjust. Then add one more key 
to the shortcut mentioned earlier. The key you'll add is option/Alt. So, for 
example, the final keyboard shortcut to adjust the Waveform Display larger 
would be option/Alt + cmd/Ctrl + L.
16.	 Now it's just a matter of adjusting the segments so that all of the waveforms align as 
best as possible. You may need to zoom in (Avid calls this More Detail) to get a more 
precise look at the Waveform). To accomplish the alignment you could use any of the 
following methods:


Method 1: Enable the Link Selection Toggle function (located above the 
Smart Tool on the left-hand side of the Timeline Window). Next, use the red 
Lift/Overwrite Segment Mode to select one set of segments (for example, 
Q1B that is on tracks V2 and A2). Then use the Trim keys on the keyboard 
(by default located on the keys M, comma, period, and forward slash) to 
nudge that set of segments left or right to place them into alignment with 
the Q1A segments, by using the Waveform Display as your visual guide. You 
would then repeat this process for all the other segments in the Sequence.



Method 2: Note that this method uses Slipping, so you would need to 
have some handle at the Head and Tail of the segments in the Sequence, 
otherwise you will not be able to Slip with this method and Media Composer 
will give you some sort of alert sound (for example, Beep, or Bonk). Place 
your blue Position Indicator at a point in one of the segments that you want 
to use as the syncing guide. For example, you would first place the position 
indicator on track A1, exactly where the Interviewer first says the letter "P" in 
the word President, or the "B" in Barack. Next, enable only the track selectors 
for the segments you want to Slip. In this example, it would be segment Q1B 
(so we would enable only tracks V2 and A2). Lastly, use the Trim Keys on 
the keyboard to Slip the segments into alignment with the Q1A segments by 
using the Waveform Display as your visual guide. You would then repeat this 
process for all the other segments in the Sequence. More information about 
this method of Slipping can be found in Appendix B, Details on Trimming, 
Slipping, Sliding, and Segment Mode.


Method 3: Use Slipping or Sliding in Trim Mode to adjust the segments into 
alignment. More information about Slipping and Sliding in Trim Mode can 
be found in Appendix B, Details on Trimming, Slipping, Sliding, and Segment 
Mode. Note that, just as with Method 2, to use Slipping, you would need to 
have some handle at the Head and Tail of the segments in the Sequence, 
otherwise you will not be able to Slip and Media Composer may give you 
some sort of alert sound (for example, Beep, or Bonk).
17.	 Now that all the segments are in alignment, the next phase will be to use the Match 
Frame function to set a sync reference (a Mark In) in all the source clips, using the 
steps that follow. Make sure that in the following steps you use the Match Frame 
function that you previously mapped below your Record Monitor, onto the Timeline 
Toolbar, or onto the keyboard.
18.	Park the blue Position Indicator at any location in the Sequence where it comes into 
contact with all the clips you want to Group together. Once you have selected this 
location in the Sequence, do not move the Position Indicator. For emphasis, do not 
move the blue Position Indicator until all the clips have gone through the Match 
Frame process detailed in the next steps.
19.	Enable all the Audio tracks, as well as Disable all the video tracks. In this example the 
only tracks enabled would be A1, A2, A3, and A4.
20.	It's helpful to know that the Match Frame function only pays attention to the 
uppermost track that is enabled. So in this example, even though multiple tracks are 
enabled, it will initially pay attention only to Track A1.
21.	 Click the Match Frame button that you previously mapped below the Record 
Monitor, onto the Timeline Toolbar, or onto the keyboard. Details on mapping 
buttons can be found in Chapter 2, Customizing Your Work Environment.

290
22.	Now that you have clicked the Match Frame function, the source clip (in this 
example, clip Q1A) is loaded into the Source Window and Media Composer has 
placed a Mark In on that frame. You have accomplished what is necessary for that 
clip. Now return to your Sequence in the Timeline Window. 
23.	Deselect the Track Selector for Track A1. This will make Track A2 the upper-most 
track that is enabled.
24.	 Click the Match Frame button.
25.	Now that you have clicked the Match Frame function, the source clip (in this 
example, clip Q1B) is loaded into the Source Window and Media Composer has 
placed a Mark In on that frame. You have accomplished what is necessary for clip 
Q1B. Now return to the Timeline Window.
26.	Repeat steps 23, 24, and 25 for the remaining clips that need to be Grouped. In this 
example, I would deselect Track A2, and then Match Frame. Then I would deselect 
Track A3, and then Match Frame.
27.	 Now all the source clips (in this example, Q1A, Q1B, Q1C, and Q1D) have a Mark In 
at a common location. The next phase is to use them to create a new Group Clip.
28.	In the bin, select all the clips to be Grouped.
29.	Go to Bin Menu | Group Clips (or use the keyboard shortcut Shift + cmd/Ctrl + G).
30.	A dialog window will open. In the top section titled Sync Clips Using, select Inpoints, 
then click OK. Media Composer then creates a Group Clip and places it at the top of 
the bin.
31.	 An optional step is to rename the Group Clips. By default, the Group Clip gets its 
name from the first clip in the Group, and it gets appended with .Grp.01. I prefer to 
have the name of the Group Clip be simplified to 18/1 or Q1, and so on.
There's more...
Here we'll discuss syncing footage with starts and stops, as well as creating a Sequence that 
will help you be aware of where the cameras stopped and started.
Syncing Staggered Start and Stop Footage
The steps in the previous recipe presume that all the camera operators started and stopped 
recording at roughly the same time. However, many times you will have a camera operator(s) 
that stops and starts recording while the others are continuously recording. In that case, it 
will be helpful to use the Syncing Sequence as a map where you can place all the clips in sync 
and see the portions/sections of time when all the cameras were recording at the same time, 
and where an operator stopped and started.
Once all the Segments are in sync within the Sequence, you would create a Group Clip for 
each portion/section of time where all the cameras were recording at the same time, using 
the Match Frame method detailed earlier.

Once you have a Group Clip for each section, follow these steps to create a Sequence that 
contains the Group Clips, which I refer to as a Group Clip Map.
1.	 Duplicate the Syncing Sequence (select it, then go to: Edit Menu | Duplicate).
2.	 Rename the Sequence along the lines of Scene 18 Group Clip Map.
3.	 Use the Replace Edit function along with Source Timecode (displayed above the 
Source Window as well as the Record Window) to replace the Segments in the 
Sequence with the Group Clips. Details on using the Replace Edit function can be 
found in the Replace edit: How and why recipe in Chapter 3, Polishing Gems.
4.	 Duplicate the Group Clip Map Sequence you just created. That will be the one that 
you will use to actually edit with. Duplicating it makes sure you have an unedited 
back-up copy if you ever needed to refer to the unedited original in the future.
Software Help
If you're in this type of situation frequently, then you may want to investigate an application 
called PluralEyes, or any other similar syncing application(s).
Plosives as sync references
Words that you'll find easier to use as sync references will contain the 
hard sounds of consonants such as B, D, G (as in the word Game), K, P, 
and T. In phonetics, the sounds these letters produce are called plosives.
Using the Group Clip Menu
Whenever you load a Group Clip into the Source Window, an additional menu will appear 
above it. Its icon is very similar to that of a Group Clip (see the next screenshot). 
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Editing with Group Clips and MultiCamera Mode
292
From the menu, you can select what elements from the contents of the Group Clip (the 
Master Clips and/or Subclips) are being referenced (that is, played and/or edited into the 
Sequence). For example, let's say I have a Group Clip from Scene 23, take number 7, which is 
made up of four Master Clips named 23/7_A, 23/7_B, 23/7_C, and 23/7_D; and that each 
of these Master Clips has two audio tracks (that is, A1 and A2). In this instance, the Group 
Clip Menu would display as in the next screenshot (note that the check Marks tell you what 
source is active):
What this allows you to do is choose which clip's video you want to see or edit into the Sequence 
as well as which clip's audio you want to hear or edit into the Sequence. In this way, you can mix 
things if you need to. In other words, it's possible to play or edit with video from Camera B, but 
play or edit with the A1 audio from Camera C, and the A2 audio from Camera D. 
How to do it…
While you can mix and match the video and audio from different source clips when editing 
with a Group Clip, what if instead you want to make sure that when you select (also known 
as Switch to) a different camera that the audio that belongs with that video is also selected? 
That's easy: 
1.	 Go to Group Clip Menu.
2.	 Select Audio Follow Video (it's at the very top of the drop-down menu).
3.	 Note that the Group Clip Menu icon will turn bright green to indicate that Audio 
Follow Video is enabled.

4.	 From the Group Clip Menu, select a different video source. Note that the audio tracks 
from that source will automatically be selected for you.
5.	 See the next There's more... section for more information on changing camera angles 
(that is, Switching to different clips).
How it works…
The Audio Follow Video feature is particularly helpful when the clips that are grouped 
together contain very different audio and you want to keep the video and audio paired 
together. For example, let's say that you're editing with a Group Clip from an American Football 
game where Camera A is one of the coaches shouting, Camera B is the Quarterback yelling 
the count, Camera C is a close-up of a fan cheering, and Camera D is a close-up of another 
fan jeering.
There's more...
Another method to Switch from one clip's video to another within a Group Clip is to use the 
functions called Previous in Group, and Next in Group. By default, these functions are already 
mapped to the Up Arrow and Down Arrow on your keyboard. You can also map them to any 
location you like, using the Command Palette: Tools menu | Command Palette | MCam Tab. 
Details on mapping buttons and menu items can be found in the Mapping buttons and menu 
selections recipe in Chapter 2, Customizing Your Work Environment.
Using the Multicamera display and methods 
of switching camera angles
In the previous section, we discussed Switching camera angles (that is, changing to different 
clips within the Group Clip) by using the Group Clip Menu. While the Group Clip Menu is 
certainly useful, there are faster methods to switch to the different video angles which we'll 
cover in this section. Further, we'll also discuss the MultiCamera Display, which is referred to 
as the Quad Split when four clips are shown at the same time, or 9 Split when nine clips are 
shown at the same time.
How to do it…
This recipe will first take you through mapping the necessary functions and then will present 
the various methods to Switch camera angles.
1.	 First, you'll map the necessary functions to a convenient location(s). Go to Tools 
menu | Command Palette | MCam tab.
www.it-ebooks.info

Editing with Group Clips and MultiCamera Mode
294
2.	 In the bottom-left corner of the Command Palette, enable Button to Button 
Reassignment.
3.	 Drag-and-drop the Quad Split display function to a convenient button location below 
your Source Monitor.
4.	 Drag-and-drop the Nine Split display function to a button below your Source Monitor.
5.	 Close the Command Palette. Details on mapping buttons and menu items can be 
found in the Mapping buttons and menu selections in Chapter 2, Customizing Your 
Work Environment.
6.	 Now that you've mapped the Quad Split and Nine Split display functions to  
buttons below your Source Window, let's look at several methods to Switch  
the active camera:
i.	
Method 1: Using the Cursor, first, enable either Quad Split or Nine Split 
display by clicking on the button you mapped in the previous steps. You 
can then select which camera angle is active by simply clicking your 
cursor directly on the image you want to be active. When you make a 
camera's video active, you'll see a green line appear under that camera's 
display.
ii.	
Method 2: Previous in Group and Next in Group – by default, these 
functions are already mapped to the up arrow and down arrow on your 
keyboard. This method can be used in the following cases:


If you're still only displaying one clip at a time in the Source Window 
(Avid calls this as Full Monitor Display).


If you've enabled either Quad Split or Nine Split display – when a 
camera's video is active, you'll see a green line appear under that 
camera's display.
iii.	 Method 3 – Numeric Keypad. This feature only works when:


You are in MultiCamera Mode (Special Menu | MultiCamera 
Mode). MultiCamera Mode is covered later in this chapter


You are using the numeric keypad


You are playing in Real Time
7.	
If you are using Method 3, then the numeric keypad will activate the camera  
angles as follows:

First, it's important to remember that all we've done in the previous steps is to display and/or 
edit with a Group Clip. We were not in MultiCamera Mode. MultiCamera Mode will provide 
you with additional editing capabilities, but is not required in order to edit with a Group Clip. 
MultiCamera Mode editing is covered a bit later in this chapter.
Now let's take a closer look at the behaviors of the Quad Split and Nine Split Display function.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Editing with Group Clips and MultiCamera Mode
296
How Split display affects Multicamera Mode
Later you may want to use MultiCamera Mode for editing. It's helpful to know that, by default, 
whichever Split display you used last tells Media Composer how you'd like your display to 
be when you use MultiCamera Mode. For example, let's say I'm not in MultiCamera Mode 
and then I enable the Nine Split display for a minute, and then I turn it off, so that I'm back 
to viewing only one camera angle at a time (Avid calls this Full Monitor Display). Well, Media 
Composer remembers that, and later in the day when I do enable MultiCamera Mode editing, 
the display will be Nine Split. If you haven't set a preference, then it will default to the Quad 
Split display.
If you map Quad Split and Nine Split below the Record Monitor, onto the Timeline Toolbar, 
and/or onto the keyboard, then you will get three behaviors with one button-push:
f
f
Enables MultiCamera Mode
f
f
Enables the selected Split Display type that you clicked/pressed
f
f
While you are using MultiCamera Mode, you can press the Split Display buttons to 
toggle between the display types
Also see the the MultiCamera Mode Settings recipe for more information on settings which 
control the Split Display in the Source Window as well as on your Client Monitor (if you have 
one connected to your system).
Setting-Up The MultiCamera (Quad Split and Nine Split) Displays
We have discussed using the Quad Split, and Nine Split displays. But how do you know what 
camera angle (clip) is shown in each of the 4 or 9 camera angle display regions?
Situation 1 – Sorting before Grouping
The clips are placed into the different MultiCamera display regions based on their order in 
the bin. So, rather than letting the order be random, if prior to Grouping the Master Clips and/
or Subclips together into a Group Clip, you first performed a Sort on the Name Column in the 
bin, so that all the clips were in alpha-numeric order before you Grouped them, then the clips 
will already be in a logical order for you in the MultiCamera display regions. Specifically, when 
a Group Clip is shown in the Quad Split display or Nine Split display, the clips are placed in 
order from left to right, and from top to bottom, essentially in the same order that those in the 
West read a book.
For example, let's say that before you grouped four Master Clips together, you first perform 
a Sort on the Name Column in the bin (for Scene 23, Take 7, cameras A, B, C, and D). The 
result of the Sort would be that the Master Clips in your bin are then in the following order:
f
f
23/7_A
f
f
23/7_B
f
f
23/7_C
f
f
23/7_D

Chapter 8
297
Now, after the four clips are made into a Group Clip, and then shown in the Quad Split 
display: the first clip in the Group (23/7_A) is placed in the top-left display region, the second 
clip is in the top-right display region, the third in the lower-left, and the fourth (23/7_D) in the 
lower-right. The result would look like this: 
Situation 2 – Customizing the Order
The different clips' (camera angles') positions can be customized by pressing the cmd/Ctrl 
key. When you press the cmd/Ctrl key, you'll see that below each of the MultiCamera display 
regions, a label will appear, telling you the name of the clip that is being displayed in that 
region. That display is also a menu (Avid calls this the Multi-Angle View Menu). So, while 
holding down cmd/Ctrl, just click your cursor on the menu-display (actually, you can click 
anywhere in the display region) and select a different clip/angle from the drop-down menu 
that appears.
It's important to remember that even though we just discussed Quad Split and Nine Split 
displays, all we've done in the previous steps is to display and/or edit with a Group Clip. We 
were not in MultiCamera Mode. MultiCamera Mode will provide you with additional editing 
capabilities, but is not required in order to edit with a Group Clip. MultiCamera Mode editing 
is covered a bit later in this chapter.

four or nine camera angles (clips within a Group Clip)? For this situation, Avid provides a 
feature called Swap Cam Bank.
How to do it…
First, you'll map the Swap Cam Bank function to a convenient location(s).
1.	 Go to Tools menu | Command Palette | MCam tab.
2.	 In the bottom-left corner of the Command Palette, enable Button to Button 
Reassignment.
3.	 Drag-and-drop the Swap Cam Bank function to a convenient button location below 
your Source Monitor. Note that you could also map this onto your keyboard. A 
discussion of keyboard mapping is in Chapter 2, Customizing Your Work Environment.
4.	 Close the Command Palette.
5.	 Load a Group Clip with more than four or nine angles/clips within it into the  
Source Window.
6.	 Enable either the Quad Split or 9 Split Display.
7.	
Do one of the following methods to use the Swap Cam Bank feature:


Click on the Swap Cam Bank button. This will work whether you are using 
MultiCamera Mode or not. However, if you are in MultiCamera Mode, 
this function will have to be mapped to your keyboard, under the Record 
Monitor, or in the Timeline Toolbar.


Right-click with the mouse while in MultiCamera Mode. For emphasis,  
you must be using MultiCamera Mode in order to Swap Cam Banks  
with the mouse.

How it works...
No matter how many clips you may have Grouped together, the Swap Cam Bank function only 
toggles back and forth. Here are some examples:
f
f
Example 1: You have eight clips in one Group Clip (for ease of discussion, let's call 
the clips 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). You load that Group Clip into the Source Window 
and you set the display to Quad Split (showing just four of the clips at the same time). 
Initially, you would be viewing clips 1, 2, 3, and 4. Then when you clicked the Swap 
Cam Bank button, you would see clips 5, 6, 7, and 8. When you press the Swap Cam 
Bank button a second time, the display will toggle back to displaying the first four (1, 
2, 3, and 4).
f
f
Example 2: You have 10 clips in one Group Clip, (for ease of discussion, they're 
named 1 through 10). You load the Group Clip into the Source Window and you set 
the display to Quad Split (showing just four of the clips at the same time). Initially, 
you would be viewing clips 1, 2, 3, and 4. Then when you clicked the Swap Cam Bank 
button, you would see clips 5, 6, 7, and 8. When you press the Swap Cam Bank 
button a second time, the display will toggle back to displaying the first four (1, 2, 3, 
and 4). To see camera angles 9 and 10, you could do any of the following:


Use 9 Split Display.


Make a selection from the Group Clip Menu.


Use the Previous in Group/Next in Group functions (mapped to the up and 
down arrow keys by default).


Press and hold the cmd/Ctrl key to reveal the Display Region Labels 
(Avid calls this the Multi-Angle View Menu). Click in a display to show the 
Selection Menu, and then select a clip to be displayed.
Editing with a Group Clip – not using 
MultiCamera Mode
When a Group Clip has been edited into your Sequence, Media Composer helps you 
differentiate a Group Clip from other types of source clips in your Sequence by placing (G) 
after the clip's name.
It is possible to edit with a Group Clip without using MultiCamera Mode. We'll discuss that in 
this recipe and later in this chapter, we'll examine editing with MultiCamera Mode.

Editing with Group Clips and MultiCamera Mode
300
How to do it...
First, select what you'd like to edit into the Sequence (Steps 1 through 4).
1.	 Load a Group Clip into the Source Window.
2.	 Select the video angle you'd like to edit into the Sequence to start out with. For 
example, possibly you'd prefer to start with the Wide Shot/Master Shot. Honestly, 
this is an option and is not required because you can quickly and easily change 
angles/shots at any time after it has been edited into the Sequence (covered in the 
steps later). To select the video, you could:


Make a selection from the Group Clip Menu that's above the  
Source Window.


Use the Previous in Group/Next in Group functions (mapped by default on 
the up and down arrow keys).


If you are in Quad Split or 9 Split Display, click on one of the camera angle's 
display regions to activate it. A green line appears below the active camera 
angle.


Press one of the MultiCamera Angle Buttons (also known as the M keys) on 
the keyboard (see the There's more... section later for details).
3.	 From the Group Clip Menu, select which audio sources you want to edit into the 
Sequence. An option is to enable the Audio Follow Video feature (discussed earlier in 
this chapter in the Using the Group Clip menu recipe).
4.	 Edit all of, or a portion of, the Group Clip into your Sequence.
5.	 Now that you've edited a Group Clip into the Sequence, the following steps will 
take you through the basic editing process. See the There's more... section later for 
additional techniques.
6.	 In your Sequence, place the blue Position Indicator where you'd like to change to 
(Switch to) another camera angle.
7.	
Enable the tracks you'd like to affect. For example, if you want to Switch only the 
video, then enable only the Video Track Selector. If you want to affect both audio and 
video tracks, then enable the appropriate Track Selectors (for example, V1 and A1).
8.	 Click the Add Edit function, as shown in the following screenshot:

9.	 The Add Edit function icon looks like the letter H on its side, as seen in the previous 
screenshot. It is located by default:


In Tools Menu | Command Palette | Edit tab (consider mapping this to a 
convenient location on your keyboard since you'll be using it a lot with Group 
Clips/MultiCamera Mode)


In the Fast Menu Tool Palette


Below the Record Monitor, first row of buttons, on the right side


On the Timeline Toolbar, towards the center of the row
10.	 Now that you've created a cut using the Add Edit function, and your blue Position 
Indicator is placed over the shot you want to change, then you can switch the video 
by one of the following methods:


Make a selection from the Group Clip Menu that appears above the Record 
Monitor. For emphasis, when your blue Position Indicator is placed on a 
Group Clip in the Sequence, a Group Clip Menu will become available above 
the Record Monitor.


Use the Previous in Group/Next in Group functions which are mapped to 
the arrow keys on the keyboard by default.


Right-click on the Video Segment in the Sequence and make a selection 
from the menu that appears.


Press one of the MultiCamera Angle Buttons on the keyboard (also known 
as the M keys). You do not have to be in MultiCamera Mode, or even in 
Quad Split or Nine Split Display in order to use these buttons. See the 
There's more... section later for additional details about the M keys.
11.	 If you want to Switch the audio, you can do any of the following:


Make a selection from the Group Clip Menu that appears above the  
Record Monitor.


Right-click on an Audio Segment in the Sequence and make a selection 
from the menu that appears.


Option: is to enable the Audio Follow Video feature from the Group Clip 
Menu above the Record Monitor. The Group Clip Menu will turn green 
to indicate that this feature is enabled. If enabled, when you switch video 
angles (using any method except the right-click menu), then the audio that 
comes from that video's source clip will also be switched automatically.

How it works...
While not as fast as editing in Real Time with MultiCamera Mode, the methods described 
earlier are still wonderfully fast. It's also helpful to keep in mind that:
f
f
You can combine portions of different Group Clips to form a complete scene.
f
f
All standard editing methods and techniques are still available when you're editing 
with a Group Clip. However, you get the added advantage of having multiple camera 
angles (clips) available to switch to whenever you like.
f
f
You can use audio from one angle/clip with video from another.
f
f
You can adjust when the camera angles switch by trimming the cut-point (using 
Double-Roller Trim).

The following is another method of editing with Group Clips, how to remove unwanted edit 
points in a Group Clip, methods to remove Match Frame Edits, some valuable information 
about the MultiCamera Angle keys (also known as the M Keys), and a tip about color coding 
your clips.
Premapping Edit Points (also known as Transitions)
Rather than placing cut-points one at a time, you can place a series of cut points in Real Time 
and then go back in a second pass to switch the camera angles and/or to adjust the cut-
points. Here are the steps: 
1.	 In order to use this technique, the Add Edit function must be mapped to your 
keyboard. The Add Edit function can be found at: Tools Menu | Command Palette | 
Edit tab. Details on mapping buttons can be found in the Mapping buttons and menu 
selections recipe in Chapter 2, Customizing Your Work Environment.
2.	 Edit a Group Clip into your Sequence.
3.	 Enable the Video and/or Audio Track Selectors for the tracks you want to edit in 
the Sequence. For example, you might have four camera angles of a person giving 
a speech that are within a Group Clip, but are using just one audio track because 
it was a direct feed from the sound system. Therefore, in that instance, you would 
enable only the Video Track Selector.
4.	 Since you will already have a general idea of the different camera angles within the 
Group Clip (for example, Wide Shot, Close-up, Profile, Audience Reaction, and so 
on), you can make the decisions about where you think you'd like to switch angles 
(premapping), using the next steps.
5.	 Play the Sequence.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 8
303
6.	 As the Sequence plays, any time you feel is a good point to switch camera angles, 
simply press the Add Edit function that you mapped to your keyboard. Note that you  
will not see the cuts you made until after you've stopped the playback. Don't worry  
that you may have made a cut in the wrong place. You can adjust that position later, 
using Double-Roller Trim. Also, see the next section for information on removing 
unwanted cuts.
7.	
Stop the playback. All the cuts (Add Edits) will now appear.
8.	 Use whatever technique (detailed earlier in the recipe steps) that you like to change 
the video angle and/or audio source.
Removing unwanted edit points
Here are two methods for removing transitions/edit points: 
f
f
Method 1: Enter Trim Mode at the cut-point (transition) that you want to remove. By 
default, you will be placed into the Double-Roller Trim configuration. This is exactly 
what you want. Use your mouse/cursor to drag the Double-Roller Trim Rollers until 
they come into contact with another transition. Avid Media Composer's programming 
will automatically stop the trim from progressing beyond that point. So, you could 
do this with your eyes closed! After you release the mouse button and then grab the 
Trim Rollers a second time, then you could continue to trim further if you like. You 
can also use the Play Reverse, Pause, and Play Forward functions (by default on the 
J, K, and L keys) while in Trim Mode. Note that the programming in earlier releases 
may be different with regard to JKL Trimming and transitions. In earlier releases, you 
might find that the programming tells Media Composer to stop a Double-Roller Trim 
1 frame before contacting a transition.
f
f
Method 2: If the transition is what Avid calls a Match Frame Edit (with a white  
equals symbol appearing on it), then you will find a discussion about removing these  
in the Using Clip Mode with dissolves to make level And pan adjustments recipe in 
Chapter 7, Mono and Stero Audio Mixing (specifically, see step 6, as well as the  
There's more section).
Details about the MultiCamera Angle Keys (The M Keys)
Following is some useful information about using the MultiCamera Angle keys.
f
f
By default, they are mapped on the following keys:


F9: MultiCamera Angle 1 (M1) 


F10: M2


F11: M3




Shift key + F11: M7


Shift key + F12: M8
f
f
You can map the M keys anywhere you like. The M keys can be found at Tools 
Menu | Command Palette | MCam tab. For example, I have a separate keyboard 
mapping for when I'm editing with Group Clips/MultiCamera Mode (see Chapter 2, 
Customizing Your Work Environment for more information on alternate settings and 
keyboard mapping). I've chosen to place the MultiCamera Angle functions onto the F 
keys; and because I'm on a Mac I can also use the F1 key (on a PC the F1 key cannot 
be customized because it's reserved by the operating system for Help). I make it easy 
for myself to remember what M function is mapped where by placing M1 onto the F1 
key, M2 onto the F2 key, and so on.
f
f
The MultiCamera Angle function does not switch the audio. The exception to this 
would be if you have the Audio Follow Video feature enabled.
f
f
You can use the M keys when you're not in MultiCamera Mode. Further, you do not 
even have to be using the Quad Split or 9 Split Displays. M1 will be the first clip/
angle within the Group Clip, M2 would be the second clip, and so on. This is one 
reason performing a Sort on the Name Column before Grouping the Clips is helpful. 
More details on this topic are earlier in this chapter within the Syncing and grouping 
clips with common reference points recipe.
f
f
You do not have to use the Add Edit function before using any of the M keys. When 
you press an M key, it makes a cut as well as switches the camera angle.
f
f
The M keys correspond to activating the Quad Split and 9 Split Displays as follows:

Color Coding Clips/Camera Angles
If you'd like to be able to have a very quick visual reference of what camera angles you're 
using in your Sequence, you can color code the clips. For example, let's say we are editing a 
scene with three characters. The camera angles are:
f
f
Master Shot of all three characters
f
f
Close-Up of KATIE
f
f
Close-Up of LEAH
f
f
Close-Up of SAMANTHA
We can choose to color code the Master Shot as green, KATIE as purple, LEAH as pink, and 
SAMANTHA as yellow. Here's how to make it all work:
1.	 In Media Composer Version 6, the programmers have displayed the Color Column in 
the bin by default and placed it to the left of the Name Column. In earlier releases, 
you can choose to display the Color Column from Bin Menu | Choose Columns.
2.	 Right-click on the small color swatch next to a clip's name and select a color from the 
palette that appears. In earlier releases, you will left-click within the Color Column.
3.	 In all releases of Media Composer, you may also color code a clip by select it/them 
and then going to Edit Menu | Set Clip Color.
4.	 Repeat steps 2 or 3 for additional clips if needed.
5.	 Though you have color coded the clips in the bin, these colors will not be visible in the 
Timeline unless you choose to have them displayed, using the next steps.
6.	 Go to Timeline Window Fast Menu (the hamburger-looking icon in the bottom-left of 
the Timeline Window) | Clip Color and then enable the option Source Color.
7.	
An optional step is to save a Timeline View with Clip Color enabled. More information 
about Timeline Views is in Chapter 2, Customizing Your Work Environment.
MultiCamera Mode Editing
MultiCamera Mode editing (MultiCam for short) provides additional editing features that 
are not available when simply editing with a Group Clip. To be clear, you can still use all the 
features and editing techniques discussed previously in this chapter while in MultiCamera 
Mode, however you get more. Specifically, you get the ability to switch camera angles in 
real time! This is accomplished by using the MultiCamera Angle Keys (also known as the 
M Keys) on the keyboard. See the previous There's more... section for the Details about the 
MultiCamera Angle keys.

Editing with Group Clips and MultiCamera Mode

Getting ready We'll get ready by first setting up the Split Display. See the previous Using The 
MultiCamera display and methods of switching camera angles and Swap Cam Bank: Toggling 
the MultiCamera display recipes for more information on this topic. 
Also see the next MultiCamera mode settings recipe for more information on settings which 
control the Split Display in the Source Window as well as on your Client Monitor (if you have 
one connected to your system).
f
f
Method 1: By default, before you enter MultiCamera Mode, whichever Split display 
you used last tells Media Composer how you'd like your display to be when you 
use MultiCamera Mode. For example, let's say I'm not in MultiCamera Mode and 
then I enable the Nine Split display for a minute, and then I turn it off, so that 
I'm back to viewing only one camera angle at a time (Avid calls this Full Monitor 
Display). Well, Media Composer remembers that, and later in the day when I do 
enable MultiCamera Mode editing the display will be Nine Split. If you haven't set a 
preference, then it will default to the Quad Split display. 
f
f
Method 2: If you map Quad Split and 9 Split below the Record Monitor, onto the 
Timeline Toolbar, or onto the keyboard, then you will get these three behaviors:


Enables MultiCamera Mode


Enables the selected Split Display type you clicked/pressed


While you are using MultiCamera Mode, you can press the Split Display 
buttons to change the display type
How to do it...
Here we'll go through the process of editing Group Clips in real time, using MultiCamera Mode:
1.	 First, select what you'd like to edit into the Sequence; so start by loading a Group Clip 
into the Source Window.
2.	 Select the video angle you'd like to edit into the Sequence to start out with. For 
example, possibly you'd prefer to start with the Wide Shot/Master Shot. Honestly, this 
is an option and is not required because you can quickly and easily change angles/
shots at any time after it has been edited into the Sequence. To select the video, you 
could use one of the following options:


Make a selection from the Group Clip Menu that's above the Source Window.


Use the Previous in Group/Next in Group functions (mapped by default on 
the up and down arrow keys).


If you are in Quad Split or 9 Split Display, click on one of the camera  
angle's display regions to activate it. A green line appears below the  
active camera angle.



Press one of the MultiCamera Angle Buttons (also known as the M keys) on 
the keyboard.
3.	 From the Group Clip Menu, select which audio sources you want to edit into the 
Sequence. Optionally, you can enable the Audio Follow Video feature (discussed 
earlier in this chapter in the Using the Group Clip menu recipe).
4.	 Edit all of, or a portion of, the Group Clip into your Sequence.
5.	 Place your blue Position Indicator over the Group Clip in your Sequence wherever 
you'd like to begin editing it.
6.	 Make sure that the Video Track Selector is enabled. The Audio Track Selector(s) can 
also be enabled if you want to simultaneously affect the audio as well. An example for 
doing this would be when the audio from each camera angle is different and you're 
using the Audio Follow Video feature. See the earlier Using the Group Clip menu 
recipe for details.
7.	
Enter MultiCamera Mode using any of these methods:


Go to Special Menu | MultiCamera Mode.


Use the keyboard shortcut Shift + cmd/Ctrl + M.


If you have mapped the Quad Split and/or 9 Split Display function(s)  
below the Record Monitor, on the Timeline Toolbar, or on the keyboard, 
then when you click/press one of these buttons, then two things will happen:  
You will enable MultiCamera Mode, and the display type you selected will  
be activated.
8.	 After entering MultiCamera Mode, the following will have occurred:


Media Composer instantly and automatically gangs (locks) the Sequence and 
the Multiple Camera Angle Window (also known as the Source Window) 
into sync with one another. You'll see that when you move the blue Position 
Indicator that all the displays are in sync and move together.


No buttons will appear under the Multiple Camera Angle Window (also 
known as the Source Window). This is a useful visual reminder what editing 
mode you're in. This is especially helpful if, when you're not in MultiCamera 
Mode, you also have the Source Window set to one of the Split displays as 
well. It's also helpful to know that in releases of Media Composer before 
Version 6 if you click in the non-button, gray area below the Multiple Camera 
Angle Window, then you will be taken out of MultiCamera Mode. In Version 
6, this is not available. So, in order to exit Multicamera Mode, you can either 
go to the Special Menu | MultiCamera Mode, or use the shortcut Shift + 
cmd/Ctrl + M.

9.	 To edit in MultiCamera Mode, you can use any of the four methods:


Method 1 (Non-Real Time): First, move the blue Position Indicator to a 
point in the Sequence where you'd like to switch camera angles. Then click 
your cursor in the Multiple Camera Angle Window onto one of the different 
camera angles. A green line will appear below the active camera and you'll 
see that Media Composer placed a cut in the Sequence as well as switched 
the camera angle for you.


Method 2 (Real Time): First, place your blue Position Indicator over the 
Group Clip in your Sequence wherever you'd like to begin editing it. Second, 
play the Sequence. Then, while the Sequence is playing, press any of the M 
keys mapped to your keyboard. See the previous There's more... section for 
the recipe titled Details about the MultiCamera Angle keys (the M keys) for 
more information. You will see the image change in your Record Monitor 
and you'll see the green line update in the Multiple Camera Angle Window. 
However, you will not see the actual cut-points appear in the Sequence until 
after the playback has stopped.


Method 3 (Real Time – Numeric Keypad): This feature only works when you 
are in MultiCamera Mode, and you are playing in Real Time. The numeric 
keypad will activate the camera angles as seen in the following screenshot:

Method 4 (Non-Real Time): While in MultiCamera Mode, you can still use 
all the methods discussed earlier in this chapter in the Editing with a Group 
Clip: Not using MultiCamera mode recipe. Note that this includes using the 
M Keys that you mapped to the keyboard. For emphasis, you do not have to 
be playing in Real Time in order to use the M Keys. 
How it works...

f
f
The display type in the Source Window when you are in MultiCamera Mode.

editing system.
How to do it...
Here's how to access and customize the MultiCam settings:
1.	 Go to Project Window | Settings tab | Composer Settings | MultiCam tab.
2.	 From the Split Mode Play menu, you can:


Leave it set to the default setting of Quad or Nine Split. More information 
about Quad or Nine Split display is earlier in this chapter in the the Using the 
MultiCamera display and methods of switching camera angles recipe.


Select Fullscreen. Fullscreen will display only for the active camera.
3.	 From the MultiCam Mode Client Monitor menu, you can:


Leave it set to the default setting of Quad or Nine Split. An example of when 
this is useful would be when you're working with the director and he/she 
wants to tell you which camera angles to switch to. You will still be able to 
see the Sequence as normal in the Record Monitor.


Select Linecut. Selecting this will display the Sequence.

Creating accurate Color Bars and Tone
First, it's helpful to understand what Color Bars and Tone are for. The goal when mastering 
is to make sure that the image and sound meet broadcast standards, and that you do as 
much as possible so that your program is viewed and heard outside of your facility just as 
you created it. In order to do this, we all agree to use a common reference for picture and a 
common reference for audio. This way, when your film or program is broadcast or duplicated, 
if there are any deviations from these agreed upon reference values on the Master Tape or 
Master Digital File, then adjustments can be made, so that the image and audio remain 
within broadcast specifications as well as are consistent to the levels they were when 
mastered at your facility.
Before mastering, we start by using Color Bars and Tone to calibrate the equipment in our 
edit bay/facility. We'd use Color Bars to properly calibrate the external NTSC, PAL, and/or 
HD monitor that is connected to the editing system; and we'd use Tone to calibrate the audio 
signal as it leaves the editing system and makes its way through all the different devices in 
our editing bay. For example, you'd play a 0VU (zero Volume Units) tone out of your Media 
Composer (see the Understanding the Audio Tool recipe in Chapter 7, Mono and Stereo A 
udio Mixing) in order to adjust the mixing board's input and output to 0VU, and then from  
the mixing board the signal would flow to a deck, which would also be adjusted to receive  
the signal at 0VU.
There are different types of Color Bars for both PAL and NTSC. We'll focus on the commonly 
used Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) Color Bars which are 
used in North America, though the concepts will be the same even if you're using PAL.
Keeping things simple, Color Bars obviously contain different colors in them, but they also 
contain varying levels of brightness. In professional lingo, we refer to color as Chrominance 
(Chroma, for short) and brightness as Luminance (Luma, for short). We analyze the Chroma 
and Luma values using devices called Oscilloscopes (Scopes, for short). A Waveform Monitor 
oscilloscope is used to analyze the Luminance values of the video signal and a Vectorscope  
is used to analyze the Chrominance.
With regard to tone, we set it so that its analogue value is 0VU. On the digital side of  
things, 0VU can be set to equate to any digital value. However, a very common digital  
setting is -20dB. There is some additional discussion about this in the Understanding  
the Audio Tool recipe in Chapter 7, Mono and Stereo Audio Mixing.
Now that you've gotten a brief introduction to Bars and Tone, let's get to making them  
(and making them properly).

Getting ready
Before we get to the actual recipe, it is important to do the following:
f
f
Set the proper format for your Color Bars. Go to: Project Window | Format tab.
f
f
Set the desired resolution for your Color Bars (for example, 1:1). Go to: Tools Menu 
|Media Creation | Import Tab.
f
f
This step is optional. Make a new bin. Name it Bars and Tone.
How to do it...
You can certainly create bars and tone in whichever order you like, but let's start with the less 
complicated procedure first. So, let's begin by creating tone.
1.	 Click on the menu button next to the Audio Meters in the Timeline Toolbar. Note that 
there is an alternate method to open the Create Tone Media dialog window in the 
There's more... section.
2.	 From the menu, select Create Tone Media. A dialog window will open:

314
3.	 In the Create Tone Media dialog window, customize the following based on your 
needs (frequently, the default values will be appropriate):


Tone media level in dB: The default is -20 dB. If you've mixed to a different 
level (for example, -14 dB) then you would enter the appropriate value here.


Tone media frequency in Hz: The default is 1000 Hz (also known as 1 
Kilohertz, or commonly referred to as 1K). This is the standard reference 
tone. However, you may be asked to include tone at a different frequency.  
If so, you can enter the required value here.


Tone media length in seconds: The default is 60 seconds. Note that Media 
Composer doesn't actually create media for the duration you specify. It 
actually just creates one frame of it and then refers to that one frame over 
and over for the duration you set for the Master Clip. This allows the creation 
to go very quickly, and for the media file to take up a very small amount of 
space on your hard drive.
4.	 Set the Number of Tracks you'd like from the pull-down menu. The default is 1, 
though you may need more. A common example would be if you were outputting in 
stereo, then you'd want two tracks of tone. This will save you time when editing it into 
your sequence since it will be one edit rather than two.
5.	 Target Bin: Select the bin you'd like place the Master Clip for the tone.
6.	 Target Drive: Select the drive where you'd like to place the media that will be created.
7.	
Click OK. Very quickly the tone media and Master clip will be created.
8.	 Next will be the process to import Color Bars properly. The next steps apply to using 
NTSC, SMPTE Color Bars.
9.	 Select the open bin into which you'd like to import the Color Bars in order to make  
it active.
10.	 Go to File Menu | Import (or right-click inside the bin and select Import from the 
menu that appears).
11.	 Navigate into the folder that contains the Media Composer application.
12.	Inside the folder that contains the Media Composer application, you will see several 
folders. The one you want to navigate to next is the Supporting Files folder.
13.	Inside the Supporting Files folder, navigate inside the Test_Patterns folder.
14.	 Inside the Test Patterns folder, you will see the following four folders:


HD_720 (for 1280 x 720 raster)


HD_1080 (for 1920 x 1080 raster)


SD_NTSC (for Standard Definition in the NTSC Standard)


SD_PAL (for Standard Definition in the PAL Standard)

15.	Navigate inside of the appropriate folder (listed in step 14) for your situation/needs. 
For the remainder of this recipe's steps, I'll navigate inside the HD_1080 folder as  
an example.
16.	 After navigating into the appropriate folder, and before you select a file, perform the 
next steps.
17.	 In the dialog window, use the pull-down menu to select the hard drive you want the 
media you'll be creating to be placed when the file is imported.
18.	In the dialog window, select the resolution for the media you'll be creating. It should 
already be set, if you followed the steps in the Getting ready section. However, you 
can double-check it here, or select a different resolution.
19.	The next step is crucial to correctly importing the file.
20.	Click on the Options button. This will open the Import Settings dialog window.
21.	 Click on the Image tab, if it is not already displayed.
22.	Set the following:


Image Size Adjustment: In the Getting ready section, I had you make sure 
to set the correct format for your project. Since the file you will import should 
be the same dimensions as the format you've set, then enable the choice 
labeled as Image sized for current format.


Field Ordering In File: Since the file is a graphic file, with no separate fields, 
then enable the choice labeled as Ordered for current format.


File Pixel to Video Mapping: The file you're going to import is already at 
broadcast levels (as opposed to RGB levels which are used in graphics), 
so you'll enable the choice labeled as 601 SD or 709 HD (16 - 235). For 
emphasis, this is a very important part of the recipe that ensures that the 
Chroma and Luma levels are correct when the file is imported. For details, 
see the How it works... section after this recipe.


Alpha Channel: This relates to any transparency information that may be 
in a file. The Color Bars file you'll be importing does not have an Alpha 
Channel, so it honestly doesn't matter which selection you make here. 
However, if it makes you feel more comfortable, feel free to select Ignore.


Frame Import Duration: The default is 60 seconds, but you can enter any 
value you like. Just as when creating tone, Media Composer doesn't actually 
create media for the duration you specify. It actually just creates one frame 
of it and then refers to that one frame over and over for the duration you set 
for the Master Clip. This allows the creation to go very quickly, and for the 
media file to take up a very small amount of space on your hard drive.
23.	Click the OK button to close the Import Settings dialog window.
24.	 Now you're ready to select the file you'd like to import. In my example, we would select 
SMPTE_Bars.tif.

25.	To start the import, you can do one of the following:


Double-click on the file you want to import


Select the file, then click the "Open" button in the bottom-right of the  
dialog window
26.	The Color Bars will then quickly be imported into your selected bin.
How it works...
While the audio tone is generated by Media Composer, the Color Bars are created by 
importing a special file which Avid provides for us. The file is special because it is not at the 
Chroma and Luma levels used in the graphics field (referred to as RGB). Instead, this file's 
Chroma and Luma values are at television broadcast standards. Technically, these standards 
are referred to as ITU-R BT.601 for SD video and ITU-R BT.709 for HD video. I mention these 
two standards because you see the numbers 601 and 709 in the Import Settings dialog 
window, and it explains where those numbers come from.
There's more...
The following is an additional method to create tone, along with some helpful supporting 
information.
Accessing the Create Tone Media Dialog Window
There is an alternate method for opening the Create Tone Media dialog window from the  
one presented in the recipe of steps: 
1.	 Open the Audio Tool: Tools Menu | Audio Tool.
2.	 Click on the button labeled as PH. Avid calls this the Peak Hold Menu.
3.	 From the menu, select Create Tone Media.
The Test Pattern Files
Inside the Test_Patterns folder there are some test patterns in the .pct file format. These 
files are 8 bit. The files inside the folders are in the .tif file format (.tif) and are 16 bit.

Color Bars I and Q Blocks
Avid states that, if you must have I and Q blocks correct in a sequence, do one of the following: 
f
f
Record SMPTE bars from a signal generator.

f
Use the Video Output tool to generate SMPTE bars, and record them to tape using 
the controls on the deck. Then, capture them back into the system from the tape.
Methods for setting Sequence Timecode
These topics are presented within the context of adding Color Bars and Tone at the beginning 
of your Sequence prior to output. However:
f
f
You can change Timecode values and/or types (that is, Drop Frame or Non-Drop 
Frame) whenever you need.
f
f
Note that it is okay to first add the Filler to accommodate the Color Bars, Tone,  
and Slate, and then to change the Timecode. I'm simply showing you to change  
the Timecode first because this is my personal preference.
f
f
See the There's more... section after the recipe of steps for discussion of other 
methods and situations for setting Sequence Timecode.
Before we get into the recipe of steps, let's start with some helpful background information. 
When mastering in a professional situation, we must:
f
f
Make sure that the very first frame of the content (for example, film, TV show, 
commercial, and so on) is placed precisely in the Sequence, so that its Timecode 
value is on the hour frame exactly. For example, in the U.S., we would typically make 
sure that the very first frame of the content in our Sequence is at 01;00;00;00 (or 
any other hour value as is required). Other countries may use different values (for 
example, content typically begins at 10:00:00:00 in the UK).
f
f
Add Filler at the beginning of the Sequence to accommodate the Color Bars and 
Tone, Slate, and any other elements required (for example, a countdown clock) 
before the content begins. Adding Filler is discussed in the following the Adding Filler 
for Color Bars, Tone, and Slate recipe.

For television broadcast in the U.S. (and other countries that use the NTSC standard), 
we use a type of Timecode that is referred to as Drop Frame Timecode (as opposed 
to Non-Drop Frame Timecode). For anyone unfamiliar with these two types of 
Timecode, I'll avoid the technical reason for the two types and simply relate that Drop 
Frame Timecode is temporally accurate. In other words, it does correspond to clock 
time: 1 hour of Drop-Frame Timecode equals 1 hour of time on a clock. On the other 
hand, Non-Drop Frame Timecode is not temporally accurate. In other words, it does 
not sync with regular clock time. Here's an example:


Start playing a Sequence (or tape) beginning at 01:00:00:00 in Non-Drop 
Frame Timecode at the exact same time as you start a stop-watch.


When the Sequence (or tape) shows that it has played for 1 hour (reaching 
the Timecode value of 02:00:00:00) stop both the Sequence and the stop 
watch at the same time.


What you'll find is that while the Sequence time indicates that 1 hour has 
passed, that the stop watch indicates, correctly, that 01:00:03:18 (1 hour, 
0 minutes, 3 seconds, and 18 frames) of time has gone by. So you see Non-
Drop Frame Timecode is not clock accurate, which is why those countries 
that use the NTSC standard use Drop Frame Timecode, which is clock 
accurate for television broadcast purposes. Note that for a great explanation 
of the technical reason why Drop Frame Timecode was implemented, and 
what the math involved is, I recommend the book Nonlinear, 4th edition, 
Michael Rubin, Paperback.
Now that you have a bit of background on Drop Frame versus Non-Drop Frame Timecode, 
a logical question that needs to be answered is how do I know which type of Timecode is on 
a tape or that my Sequence is using? The answer is simple: Look at the symbol (referred to 
as the separator) that appears between the numbers. When looking at the Timecode of a 
tape while it's in a tape deck, if all of the separator symbols between the numbers are colons 
(:), then the Timecode type is Non-Drop Frame. If you see that any separator deviates from 
this in any way, then the Timecode type is Drop Frame. Here's just one example of various 
deviations you might encounter: If you paused a tape in a deck and saw that the Timecode 
was 06:11:18.04, then you'd know that the Timecode type was Drop Frame. Did you notice 
that between the numbers 18 and 04 there wasn't a colon, but instead it was only a period? 
That is the deviation that indicates Drop Frame Timecode. However, Media Composer makes 
it much easier to tell which type of Timecode your Sequence is using:
f
f
Non-Drop Frame Timecode will have colons (:) as separators between all  
the numbers
f
f
Drop Frame Timecode will have semi-colons (;) as separators between all  
the numbers

Getting ready
The context of this recipe of steps is that you are changing the starting Timecode value to 
make room for the Bars, Tone, and Slate; and that your content needs to begin at the even 
hour position, as is required in professional situations. See the discussion earlier for details 
on Timecode.
Note that this recipe of steps applies to Media Composer Version 5.x and later. Prior to Version 
5.x, you would use one of the following methods:

f
Click on the Record Monitor to make it active, then go to the File Menu and select 
Get Clip Info
f
f
Click on the Record Monitor to make it active, then use the shortcut cmd/Ctrl + I
How to do it…
There are two methods available for changing the starting Timecode value and/or the 
Timecode type. The following is one method and later, in the There's more... section,  
you will find the other.
1.	 Load the Sequence into the Timeline.
2.	 Right-click on the Record Monitor.
3.	 From the menu that appears, select Sequence Report.
4.	 The Sequence Report dialog window will open. In the Starting TC entry box, you can 
do the following:


If the Timecode type (Drop Frame or Non-Drop Frame) is already set to 
the type you need, then to change the Timecode value, all you have to 
do is highlight the current entry value and type the new numbers. Media 
Composer will take care of adding the separator symbols for you.


If all you need to do is to change the Timecode type (but not the value),  
you do not need to change every separator symbol. All you have to do is 
place your cursor anywhere in the Starting TC entry box and then type  
either a colon or a semi-colon. Media Composer will change all the 
separators for you.
5.	 Note that this example is based on a Sequence that was already set to use Drop 
Frame Timecode. Additionally, after setting the new starting Timecode value, you 
would add 1 minute and 30 seconds of Filler at the beginning of the Sequence, into 
which you would later place the Color Bars, Tone, and Slate (adding FIller for bars, 
tone and slate is covered in the recipe that follows this one).

6.	 In the Starting TC entry box, I enter 00583000. Media Composer automatically adds 
the separator symbols for me and the result is 00;58;30;00.
7.	
Click the Apply Changes button.
8.	 This next step will seem strange and counter-intuitive. However, to complete the 
process, you will then click on the Cancel button.
9.	 You have now successfully changed the starting Timecode value and/or the 
Timecode type.
There's more...
Following are some additional tips regarding Sequence timecode.
Changing Timecode in the Bin
Rather than have to load a Sequence into the Timeline Window in order to modify the starting 
Timecode value, you can do it directly in a Bin.
1.	  Make sure that the Start column is displayed.
2.	 To change the starting Timecode value, highlight the existing numbers and then 
simply type in the new numbers. Media Composer will add the separator symbols  
for you.
3.	 To change the Timecode type (Drop Frame or Non-Drop Frame), highlight any one 
of the separators and enter the separator type that you need. Media Composer will 
change all the other separator symbols for you.
Setting a default starting Timecode value and type
Since I'm in the U.S. and work primarily in television (which uses Drop Frame Timecode at all 
times), I set my default starting Timecode for all new Sequences to 01;00;00;00 (one hour 
straight up); and I set the Timecode type to Drop Frame (semi-colon as the separators). To set 
the default Starting timecode for each new Sequence you make:
1.	 Go to Project Window | Settings tab | General.
2.	 Double-click the General settings to open the dialog window.
3.	 Enter the default starting Timecode value and/or type that you require.
4.	 Click the OK button.
5.	 Now each time you create a new Sequence, it will begin with the value and Timecode 
type you have set. For emphasis, this only affects new Sequences; it does not affect 
existing sequences.

The Adding Filler for Color Bars, Tone, and Slate recipe
Adding Filler for Color Bars, Tone, and Slate
While editing we generally do not have any additional material at the beginning of the 
Sequence, and we have the Timecode value of the first frame set to 01;00;00;00 (in the 
U.S.) or 10:00:00:00 (in the UK). It is very common to first add Filler to the beginning of the 
Sequence and then to add the Color Bars, Tone, and Slate into that region.
Getting ready
If you have not already read the previous Methods For Setting Sequence Timecode recipe, 
then you may find it helpful prior to reading this section if you are unfamiliar with that process.
This discussion presumes these two things:
f
f
You are using the NTSC broadcast standard (which uses Drop Frame Timecode), 
as discussed in the previous section. If you are not, then make adjustments to the 
recipe of steps as required.
f
f
You have already changed the starting Timecode value of your Sequence to 
00;58;30;00 as discussed in the previous Methods For Setting Sequence

How to do it…
There are several methods you could use to add Filler at the beginning of your Sequence. 
However, I will present two of the more straightforward methods. The recipe of steps will 
present one method and we will see the other in the There's more... section.
1.	 Load your Sequence into the Timeline Window.
2.	 Do one of the following:


Enable all video and audio tracks


Enable the Sync Locks for all tracks

322
3.	 Go to the Clip Name Menu above your Source Monitor (see the next screenshot):
4.	 From the Clip Name Menu, select Load Filler. Media Composer will then load 2 
minutes of Filler.
5.	 Place a Mark In at the beginning.
6.	 Using the Numeric Keypad, type in a + (plus symbol), and you'll see an entry box 
appear. Note that for those on a laptop, without an extended keyboard, press the Ctrl 
key twice in quick succession and the entry box will appear.
7.	
Now type in the amount of Filler you want to add. In this example, I'm going to type 
in a very specific value that compensates for Drop Frame Timecode, which will save 
me some work later (though I'll touch on that too in step 12, in case you choose 
not use this specific value). I will now type in the numbers 12927. Media Composer 
automatically adds the separators for me and the result is +1:29:27 (1 minute, 29 
seconds, and 27 frames).
8.	 Press the Enter key. The blue Position Indicator moves forward.
9.	 Place a Mark Out. You will have marked a duration of 1:29:28 (1 minute, 29 
seconds, and 28 frames).
10.	 Go to the very beginning of your Sequence.
11.	 Splice the Filler into the Sequence.

12.	In this example, we're using Drop Frame Timecode and the Sequence was previously 
set to begin at 00;58;30;00. Therefore, after Splicing in the Filler, the result will be 
the following:


You now have Filler at the beginning, ready for you to add Bars, Tone, and 
Slate.


The Content in your Sequence has been pushed down and now begins at 
precisely 01;00;00;00, as it should (see the Methods For Setting Sequence 
Timecode recipe for more information).


Note that if, after adding the Filler, for any reason your content does not 
begin precisely at 01;00;00;00, then you can use Trim Mode (specifically, 
yellow Ripple Trim) to add or remove Filler until the first frame of your 
content does properly start at 01;00;00;00. When you trim, make sure that 
you are either trimming all the tracks, or that you have enabled Sync Locks 
for all tracks.
There's more...
You can instruct Media Composer to add Filler at the beginning of the Sequence by either:
f
f
Clip Menu | Add Filler at Start
f
f
Right-click in the Timeline Window | Add Filler at Start
A nice benefit of using this method is that it will maintain the starting Timecode value for 
the first frame of the Sequence. For example, when I'm editing, I will have no Filler at the 
beginning of my Sequence and the starting Timecode will be set to 01;00;00;00. When I add 
Filler at the beginning, using the Add Filler at Start method, the content is pushed down by 
the Filler and Media Composer automatically compensates and keeps my content beginning 
at 01;00;00;00. Nice, huh? Further, I instruct Media Composer to add exactly the amount of 
Filler I need for my Bars, Tone, and Slate. I do this by adjusting the default amount of Filler 
that Media Composer adds. By default, the Add Filler at Start feature adds 30 seconds of 
Filler. However, you can set whatever amount you'd like it to add by following these steps:
1.	 Go to Project Window | Settings tab | Timeline settings | Edit tab.
2.	 In the Start Filler Duration entry box, you can enter whatever value you want. For 
example, if you're using Drop Frame Timecode, then you might set the value to 
00:01:29:28 to get the results I described in the previous recipe.

Exporting a still image
It's pretty common to have to export still images for use on the web, use in print materials, or 
to manipulate in another application (for example, Photoshop) and then to import the altered 
frame back into your project and edit it into your Sequence.
How to do it…
Here is how to export a still image:
1.	 In either the Source Window or Record Window, pause on the frame you want  
to export.
2.	 Enable the video track for the source clip or Sequence where the image resides  
(for example, V2).
3.	 To begin the Export process, you can use any of the following methods:


Right-click on Source Monitor and select Export


Right-click on the Record Monitor and select Export


Go to File Menu | Export
4.	 The Export As… dialog window will open. Enter a name for the file you will  
be exporting.
5.	 From the pull-down menu, select where you'd like the file to be placed when  
it's created (for example, Desktop).
6.	 Click on the Options button. The Export Settings dialog window will open.
7.	
From the Export As pull-down menu, select Graphic.
8.	 From the Graphic Format pull-down menu, Select your preference from the list of 
available formats. I particularly like that one of the choices is Photoshop.
9.	 Click the Format Options button to customize the quality of the exported file (this is 
available only for some formats, for example, JPEG).
10.	 From the Width x Height menu, select the setting that correctly reflects your format.
11.	 In the Color Levels section:


If you are exporting the file for use in print or on the web, then select RGB


If you are exporting the file to be manipulated in another application and 
later re-imported into your project, then select 609/701
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 9
325
12.	In the File Field Order section, Avid states:


This defines which field is the upper field during export. For 23.976p, 
29.97p, 24p, 25p, 50p, and 59.94p projects, these options do not appear, 
and all fields are automatically exported as progressive (still) frames.


Use Odd (Upper Field First) if you are in a PAL project. Field 1 becomes the 
upper field (its lines become the odd-numbered lines) in the frame. Field 2's 
lines become the even-numbered lines. There is an exception to this. If your 
footage is PAL DV, then you will select Even (lower field first).


Use Even (Lower Field First) if you are in an NTSC project. Field 1 becomes 
the lower field (its lines become the even-numbered lines) in the frame. Field 
2's lines become the odd-numbered lines.


Use Single Field if you want the output file to consist of only Field 1. For 
example, with SD video, your Avid editing application resizes the single field 
of 243 lines for NTSC (288 lines for PAL) to fit the frame as specified in the 
width and height selection.
13.	Once you have set all the necessary options, click the Save button. This will close the 
Export Settings dialog window and take you back to the Export As… dialog window.
14.	  In the bottom-right of the Export As… dialog window, click the Save button.
15.	Your single image will be exported.
Exporting multiple still images using 
Markers
It is possible to place Markers (previously called Locators in earlier releases) into your Source 
clip and/or your Sequence and then instruct Media Composer to export the images where the 
Markers have been placed. One example where this might be useful is if you've gone through 
your movie with the Producer or Director and used Markers to select many frames which they 
would like to give to the website designer to use. Rather than have to export all of the images 
one at a time, you can do them all at the same time. 
How to do it…
Here we'll export multiple still images using Markers.
1.	 In either the Source Window or Record Window/Sequence, place Markers on the 
images you want to export.
2.	 Follow steps 2 through 12 in the previous Exporting A Still Image recipe.

3.	 While still displaying the Export Settings dialog window, enable the choices for both:


Sequential Files


Markers Only
4.	 Once you have set all the necessary options discussed in the Exporting A Still Image 
recipe, click the Save button. This will close the Export Settings dialog window and 
take you back to the Export As… dialog window.
5.	 In the bottom-right of the Export As… dialog window, click the Save button.
6.	 All images with a Marker will be exported.
How it works...
If you do not select the Markers Only option, then all frames that exist (or just those between 
a Mark In and a Mark Out, depending on your situation and Export Settings) will be exported. 
This creates what is often referred to as an Image Sequence. An Image Sequence is another 
method that you can use to provide images for use/manipulation in another application.
Exporting a QuickTime Reference Movie
Exporting to the QuickTime file format has become a very common way to get your content 
out of Media Composer and into another application (for example, for DVD encoding, for use 
as a reference with ProTools, to upload to the web, and so on).
There are a few things to be aware of when exporting a QuickTime Reference Movie out of 
Media Composer:
f
f
QuickTime Reference is not the same as a QuickTime Movie. A QuickTime reference 
is a very small file that simply points (refers) to the Avid Media Composer media 
files from your project. It allows you to fool another application (for example, a 
compression application like QuickTime Pro, Sorenson Squeeze, or Adobe Media 
Encoder) into thinking that it's looking at a QuickTime file, so that you can then 
resize it and/or encode/compress it as you need. QuickTime Reference is convenient 
because they are created very quickly. However, they can not be shared with 
someone whose computer is not able to also reference your Avid Media Composer 
media files. For emphasis, if you have to send a QuickTime file to someone, then it 
needs to be what is referred to as Self Contained, meaning that the QuickTime file 
is a standalone file whose media is totally separate and independent from the Avid 
media files. To make a Self-Contained QuickTime file, you will select QuickTime Movie. 
This is discussed in the recipe that follows this one.

Many Avid Media Composer editors report having better success in exporting 
QuickTime movies by first creating a Video Mixdown within Media Composer 
(found in the Special Menu), editing the file that is created into the Sequence, and 
then exporting only the mixdown track (and audio if desired) by using either of the 
methods listed (depending on your needs and preferences):


Video resolution set to Same As Source, which creates a Self Contained 
QuickTime movie


QuickTime Reference
f
f
Be aware of the following:


You can not create a QuickTime Reference if any of the media in the 
Sequence is linked through AMA (Avid Media Access).  An export set  
to Same As Source or a Video Mixdown will be required.


You can not perform a Same As Source export with Long-GOP video  
formats (for example, HDV, AVCHD, XDCAM-HD). You will need to first  
perform a Video Mixdown.
Suggestion: Before exporting a long Sequence, or a long selection from a 
Master Clip, perform what I refer to as a Small Scale Test. For example, rather 
than exporting your entire 25 minute short film as a Self Contained QuickTime 
file (which will take quite a long time), and then discover that the aspect ratio 
is not displaying correctly, or that the color levels are incorrect (or some other 
negative issue), I suggest you export a 5 to 10 second portion. This will export 
much faster and allow you to review it and make sure that all the settings are 
producing the results you want. Once you have the settings as they need to 
be, then you can export your content in its entirety.
How to do it…
Now we'll export a QuickTime Reference movie.
1.	 This is a recommended step, but it is not mandatory. If you have decided not to 
first perform a Video Mixdown (from the Special Menu) and then edit the resulting 
file into the Sequence before exporting (as mentioned earlier), then follow these 
additional steps.
i.	
First, enable all the tracks (cmd/Ctrl + A).
ii.	
Second, place a Mark In at the very beginning of the Sequence and a 
Mark Out at the very end. 
iii.	 Third, go to Clip Menu | Expert Render In/Out (you can also right-
click in the Timeline Window to access Expert Render In/Out). This 
rendering step will help the export process to go faster.

2.	 Follow one of these options:


If you want to export only a portion of your content (for example, movie, TV 
show, and so on), then place a Mark In and a Mark Out around the portion 
you want (discussed in step 9 will be how you tell Media Composer to pay 
attention, or not, to those Marks).


If you want to export only certain tracks of your content (for example, video 
but not audio, or video along with specific audio tracks, and so on), then 
enable only the tracks you want to export. (discussed in step 9 is how you tell 
Media Composer to pay attention, or not, to only the enabled tracks).
3.	 To begin the Export process, you can use any of these methods:
i.	
Right-click on the Source Monitor and select Export.
ii.	
Right-click on the Record Monitor and select Export.
iii.	 With the Source or Record Monitor active, go to File Menu | Export.
iv.	 In a Bin, select one or more Clips and/or Sequences that you want to 
export. Then go to File Menu | Export. Note that you can also right-click 
and select Export from the menu. Just be sure that when you right-click 
that you do so on one of the selected items.
4.	 The Export As… dialog window will open.
5.	 Enter a name for the file you will be exporting.
6.	 From the pull-down menu, select where you'd like the file to be placed when it's 
created (for example, Desktop).
7.	
Click on the Options button.  The Export Settings dialog window will open.
8.	 From the Export As: pull-down menu, select QuickTime Reference.
9.	 Some of the following settings are suggested only (you may need to make 
modifications, depending on your specific situation and requirements). You can 
consult Avid Media Composer Help for additional details:
f
f
Use Marks: Select this if you want Media Composer to export only the material that 
is between the In and Out Marks in your Clip or Sequence. If you do not enable this 
selection, then the entire Clip or Sequence will be exported.
f
f
Use Enabled Tracks: Select this if you want Media Composer to export only the 
material from specific tracks in a Clip or Sequence. If you do not enable this selection, 
then all the tracks in the Clip or Sequence will be exported. If you have performed a 
Video Mixdown, and edited the mixdown into your Sequence, then you will want to 
select this option, as well as to enable only the Track Selector for the track on which 
the Video Mixdown exists (along with any audio tracks you require).

selected, the exported movie uses the machine and drive share name of the media 
drive in the QuickTime reference movie instead of a drive letter. Select this option 
when the media files referenced by the movie are accessed remotely over the 
network. If the media files are stored on the same drive as the QuickTime reference 
movie, you do not need to select this option. When this option is deselected, you 
cannot select Add Shares for Media Drives".

selected, your Avid editing application creates a new drive share for referenced media 
files stored on unshared network drives. The drive share is hidden, so other users do 
not see the shared drive when browsing your computer. You do not need to select this 
option when media is stored on the same drive as the QuickTime reference movie."
f
f
Use Avid Codecs: Avid states, "Deselect this option when you are working in a 
cooperative environment where one or more non-Avid systems also have access 
to the media. Select this option if the non-Avid systems have the Avid DV Codec 
installed".
f
f
Color Levels: This is a very important setting. 


If you are exporting the file for use only on a computer (for example, the web, 
or a PowerPoint presentation), then you would select RGB.


If you are exporting in order to use the QuickTime file in another application 
(for example, After Effects), with the final goal being to create a new file 
that will be imported back into your project, or as a broadcast master, then 
select 601/709. Further, if you are exporting in order to use the file for DVD 
encoding (for example, using Adobe Media Encoder), in order to  you will 
want to use the 601/709 setting.

application Sorenson Squeeze defaults to expecting the file you give to  
it to be RGB. However, you can adjust this in the encoding parameters  
to tell it that the file is at broadcast levels (16-235).

How it works...
The following are details about some selections which are available when creating a 
QuickTime Reference Movie:
f
f
Defaults Menu: You have two choices. Avid states the following:


Fast Draft – When this option is selected, export is faster. This option 
automatically selects Flatten Video Tracks and Fill Spaces with Black, and 
automatically deselects Render All Video Effects and Premix Audio Tracks.


Digital Mastering – When this option is selected, your Avid editing 
application renders all video effects and premixes audio tracks before 
exporting the file. This option automatically selects Flatten Video Tracks,  
Fill Spaces with Black, Render All Video Effects, and Premix Audio Tracks.
f
f
Flatten Video Tracks: Avid states the following: "When this option is selected, your 
Avid editing application exports the composition as one video track. When this option 
is deselected, your Avid editing application generates one QuickTime video track for 
each video track in the composition, and you cannot select Fill Spaces with Black. 
Because most third-party applications do not understand multiple QuickTime video 
tracks, it is a good idea to select this option. This option is automatically selected if 
you select Fast Draft Defaults and Digital Mastering Defaults".
f
f
Fill Spaces with Black: Avid states the following: "When this option is selected, your 
Avid editing application fills blank spaces in video tracks [Filler] with black in the 
QuickTime reference movie. Because QuickTime reference movies do not recognize 
blank spaces, it is a good idea to select this option. When this option is deselected, a 
QuickTime reference movie might interpret spaces in the video track as gray or as the 
background of the player. This option is automatically selected if you select Fast Draft 
Defaults and Digital Mastering Defaults".
f
f
Render All Video Effects:" When this option is selected, Media Composer renders all 
unrendered video effects, including matte keys and titles, before the export begins. 
When this option is deselected, your Avid editing application ignores any unrendered 
effects. This option is automatically selected if you select Digital Mastering Defaults".
Exporting a QuickTime Movie

f
f
The introduction to the previous Exporting a QuickTime Reference Movie recipe  
as it contains helpful information
f
f
The previous information box that discusses performing a small scale test before 
exporting an entire sequence
How to do it…
Now that you have reviewed the information mentioned in the Getting ready section,  
let's export a Self Contained QuickTime movie.
1.	 Follow steps 1 through 7 in the previous Exporting a QuickTime Reference  
Movie recipe.
2.	 From the Export As: pull-down menu, select QuickTime Movie (not Quick  
Time Reference).
3.	 Some of the following settings are suggestions only, based on selecting the Same as 
Source option. You can consult Avid Media Composer Help for additional details.
f
f
Same as Source: This is the fastest and easiest selection to make, and it maintains 
the same video quality you have in your Sequence. Avid states: "When you select 
this option, your Avid editing application copies the media files directly with no 
resolution change. This method is fast and creates output that uses the same quality 
as your source files. This is the best method to use if you plan to process the video 
with another application," such as Adobe Media Encoder, After Effects, and so on. 
Be aware that you can not perform a Same As Source export with Long-GOP video 
formats (for example, HDV, AVCHD, XDCAM-HD). You will need to first perform a Video 
Mixdown. This is discussed in the Exporting a QuickTime reference movie recipe.
f
f
Use Marks: Select this if you want Media Composer to export only the material 
between the In and Out Marks in your Clip or Sequence. If you do not enable this 
selection, then the entire Clip or Sequence will be exported.
f
f
Use Enabled Tracks: Select this if you want Media Composer to export only the 
material from specific tracks in a Clip or Sequence. If you do not enable this selection, 
then all the tracks in the Clip or Sequence will be exported.
f
f
Video and Audio/Video Only/Audio Only: This allows you to select what elements to 
export.

f
f
Use Avid Codecs: Avid states, "Deselect the Use Avid Codec sub-option when you 
are working in a cooperative environment where one or more non-Avid systems also 
have access to the media. [I add: Only select this if the other non-Avid systems have 
the Avid codecs installed] – if you export DV media from a 24p or 23.976 project 
using Same as Source, you must use the Avid DV Codec to ensure the QuickTime 
movies retain all of the progressive information. If you do not use the Avid DV Codec, 
your Avid editing application treats movies as interlaced sources when you re-import 
them".
f
f
Custom: Selecting this will reveal more options. A large Format Options button will 
appear. When you click on the Format Options button, then QuickTime's Movie 
Settings dialog window will open. Avid states, "When you select this option, your Avid 
editing application decompresses the files, processes them, and compresses the 
files at the requested resolution and audio format. This method is slower and often 
loses quality. Use this option only if you have to directly export a clip or sequence in 
a particular file format." For more information about these settings, see Avid Media 
Composer Help. The search string is QuickTime Movie Settings.
f
f
Video Format: This will only be displayed if you have selected Custom. Avid states, 
"Width x Height: Defines the size of the clip. You can type in values or select from the 
predefined values in the Fast Menu. The values in the Fast menu suggest a typical 
use for each size, for example, 320 x 240 (Internet video, large). The Size to Fit sub-
option sizes to fit the specified width and height. The Crop/Pad sub-option instructs 
your Avid editing application not to scale or resize the frames. If necessary, it adds 
black lines to the top and bottom of the frame to achieve the correct size".
f
f
File Field Order: This will only be displayed if you have selected Custom. Avid states, 
"File Field Order: Defines which field is the upper field during export. For 23.976p, 
29.97p, 24p, 25p, 50p, and 59.94p projects, these options do not appear, and all 
fields are automatically exported as progressive (still) frames". Refer to the following:.


Use the Odd (Upper Field First) sub-option if you are in a PAL project. Field 
1 becomes the upper field (its lines become the odd-numbered lines) in 
the frame. Field 2's lines become the even-numbered lines. There is an 
exception to this. If your footage is PAL DV, then you will select Even  
(Lower Field First).


Use the Even (Lower Field First) sub-option if you are in an NTSC project. 
Field 1 becomes the lower field (its lines become the even-numbered lines) 
in the frame. Field 2's lines become the odd-numbered lines.


Use the Single Field sub-option if you want the output file to consist of only 
Field 1. In this case, your Avid editing application resizes the single field of 
243 lines for NTSC (288 lines for PAL) to fit the frame as specified in the 
width and height selection."

f
Audio Format: Avid states, "If you select Direct Out as your audio format, you should 
select Same as Source for your export option for media that includes surround sound 
audio. This allows you to export the track assignments in your source sequence 
accurately".
f
f
Color Levels: This is a very important setting. If you are exporting for use only on a 
computer (for example, the web, or a PowerPoint presentation) then you would select 
RGB. If you are exporting in order to use the QuickTime file in another application 
(for example, After Effects), with the final goal being to create a new file that will be 
imported back into your project, or as a broadcast master, then select 601/709. 
Further, if you are exporting to then use the file for DVD encoding (for example, using 
Adobe Media Encoder), then you will want to use the 601/709 setting.


Exceptions to the above: If you are using Apple's application called 
Compressor, then you will export as RGB since that is the setting Compressor 
is programmed to expect. Also note that the application Sorenson Squeeze 
defaults to expecting the file you give to it to be RGB. However, you can 
adjust this in the encoding parameters to tell it that the file is at broadcast 
levels (16 - 235).


Performing a small test on 5 to 10 seconds of your Sequence, as discussed 
in the earlier information box, is advisable to ensure proper levels before 
exporting the entire Sequence.
f
f
Display Aspect Ratio: Generally Native dimensions will produce the results you 
want. Avid states, "Defines an image size for the video you want to export: Native,  
4:3, or 16:9. This lets you control the display format without modifying the source  
file". Also refer to the following:.


If you are exporting NTSC or PAL anamorphic material that needs to be seen  
as 16:9, then you will want to select the 16:9 option. Note that if you have 
any problems obtaining the proper display, you may also have to specify  
the Size settings within the QuickTime dialog window to a 16:9 frame  
size (see Custom settings earlier for more information).


This option creates metadata (information that is stored with the QuickTime 
movie). Some applications, such as the QuickTime Player, can interpret this 
metadata and scale the image at display time.


This option is useful for the Same as Source option because that option 
also preserves the original format. When you select Same as Source, the 
selections in the Display Aspect Ratio area are based on the resolution of 
the media you are exporting and the project type (NTSC or PAL).


When you select Custom, your Avid editing application calculates the Display 
Aspect Ratio selections from the values you enter for Width x Height in the 
Video Format tab.

Using the Timecode Burn-In effect
It is very common to have to supply an output of your content with a Timecode overlay 
(commonly referred to as a Timecode Burn-In) for reasons such as:
f
f
Provide a visual Timecode reference (or other data, for example, film edgecode) for  
a visual effects artist, music composer, sound designer, sound mixer, or film negative 
conformer
f
f
To indicate the version and/or date of the output, who is receiving the output, and/or 
to place a copyright notice
For this recipe, we'll be using the relatively new Timecode Burn-In effect found in the 
Generator category of the Effects Palette. Not only does it play in Real Time (and if rendering 
is required, it will render much faster than a Non-Real Time effect), but it has multiple displays 
and a great deal of customizability.
How to do it...
This simple recipe of steps will tell you how to create what Avid calls an Effect Template.  
Once customized and saved, you can then re-apply it at any time in the future and have all 
your customizations already configured, which saves you time and trouble.
Additional details about the Timecode Burn-In effect can be found in the There's more... 
section as well as in the Avid Media Composer Help by using the search string timecode 
burn-in.
1.	 This step is optional. Create a new bin specifically for holding Effect Templates.
2.	 In your Sequence, create a new, empty video track: Clip Menu | New Video Track  
(or use the shortcut cmd/Ctrl + Y).

3.	 Make sure that the Video Monitor is moved up to the empty track that you created 
(see the next screenshot).
4.	 Open the Effect Palette: Tools Menu | Effect Palette (or use the shortcut  
Cmd/Ctrl + 8). 
5.	 Select the category in the left column called Generator. All the effects in the 
Generator category will then be displayed in the right-hand column.
6.	 In the right-hand column, select the Timecode Burn-In effect.
7.	
Apply the Timecode Burn-In effect to the empty track you just created. One 
method to apply the effect is to drag-and-drop it.
8.	 Customize the effect as required. See the There's more... section for an overview  
of some of the features available.

Overview of Features
Here are some of the Timecode Burn-in effect features:

f
When you place it/apply it into your Sequence, it automatically (instantly) accesses 
all the information (that is, metadata) about it such as Sequence Timecode, Source 
Timecodes, KeyKode, clip names, and so on

Four information displays; this is very helpful. Here's just one example: When making 
a film, it is often necessary to simultaneously display Sequence Timecode, Film 
KeyKode, Video Source Timecode, and Audio Source Timecode.

The other Timecode Burn-In effect
Depending on what version of Media Composer you are using, you may have two different 
Timecode Burn-In effects available in the Effects Palette. The one discussed in the recipe 
earlier is far superior to the other.
The other timecode effect can be found in the Illusion FX category. This is an older effect 
which does not play in Real Time. In other words, it has to be rendered. That is not its only 
negative trait; it also has only one display, and very few parameters available.

The Find Bin function is found by default below the Source and Record Windows in the far 
left of their button bars (below the Rewind button on both Source and Record Windows).
The Find Bin function has two default abilities: 
f
f
Record Window/Timeline: When you click the Find Bin function below the Record 
Window (or from the keyboard when either the Record Window or Timeline Window 
is active), then Media Composer will display the bin in which the currently loaded 
Sequence is stored. This is helpful when the Sequence Bin might be hidden under 
other windows, or when you might be working on several Sequences at the same 
time, which reside in different Bins.

On the Source Window: When you click the Find Bin function below the Source 
Window (or from the keyboard when then Source Window is active), then Media 
Composer will display the bin in which the loaded source Clip is stored. This is quite  
a valuable feature, and the information later will explain two methods of using it.
The context
First, an explanation of the situation and the goal: 
In your Sequence, you have a shot of a white cat that you liked last week, but now you'd like to 
change it to a shot of an orange cat. Your documentary project is large and has 150 bins in it. 
You have one bin that's filled with many shots of cats, including the white one that's currently 
in the Sequence as well as the orange one that you have in mind. The goal is to be able to 
locate and open the bin of all the cats as quickly and easily as possible.
Method 1: Using the Source Window
This is a multi-step process that uses two functions.
1.	 From the Record Window/Timeline, use the Match Frame function to load the clip 
of the white cat into the Source Window (see the Using the Match Frame function 
recipe in Chapter 3, Polishing Gems).
2.	  Now that the clip (white cat) is loaded in the Source Window, press the Find Bin 
function on the Source Window button bar.
3.	 The Bin that holds the Clip of the white cat will be displayed (even if it's closed, Media 
Composer will open it) and the clip of the white cat will be highlighted. Now you know 
which Clip you've already used, and you can now locate the new footage you want to 
use (orange cat).
Method 2: Directly from the Timeline
This is a process that only uses the Find Bin function:
1.	 Enable the track that contains the clip you want to use Find Bin with (I'll call that 
the Target Track). In this example, it would be the track that contains the white cat. 
Also, make sure that no other video track selector that's above your Target Track is 
enabled. In other words, your Target Track must be the top-most enabled track.
2.	 On the Record Window/Timeline, use option/Alt + Find Bin.
3.	 The bin that holds the clip of the white cat will open and the clip of the white cat will 
be highlighted.

There's more...
If you want to make Method 2, described earlier, to work by pressing/clicking just one button, 
you can do this by adding the option/Alt modifier directly to the Find Bin button:
1.	 Open the Command Palette: Tools | Command Palette.
2.	 Enable the Button to Button Reassignment selection in the lower-left of the 
Command Palette.
3.	 On the Command Palette, select the tab labeled as Other.
4.	 In the first column of buttons on the Command Palette, you'll see a button labeled 
Add Option Key (Mac) or Add Alt Key (PC).
5.	 Drag-and-drop the Add Option/Alt Key function right onto the Find Bin button under 
the Record Monitor.
6.	 If you look very closely, you'll see a small black dot has appeared on the button to 
indicate that the option/Alt modifier has been added.
7.	
This is an optional step. First, map the Find Bin function to your keyboard. Then 
include the Add Option/Alt Key function with it.
Moving around: Methods and tips
Media Composer provides a variety of methods to help you move around Clips and 
Sequences, as well as to locate specific Timecode points. Reading the Understanding Track 
Sensitivity and Snapping actions for the Position Indicator line and in Segment Mode recipes 
in Chapter 3, Polishing Gems will also be helpful along with this information.
Play Reverse, Pause, and Play Forward (also known as JKL or 
Three-Button Play)
By default these functions are placed on the J, K, and L keys. The Play Reverse, Pause, and 
Play Forward functions can be used not only while editing, but when trimming too. When you 
become accustomed to using them while trimming, you'll find yourself working even faster and 
more intuitively. So, I highly encourage you to give them a try when trimming and to also check 
out the section titled Keyboard mapping ideas in the Mapping buttons and menu selections 
recipe in Chapter 2, Customizing Your Work Environment for a discussion on a particularly 
popular remapping choice for these.
It's also helpful to be aware that when you're capturing from tape, and the Capture Tool is 
active, you can use these functions to control the tape deck. This not only makes the process 
easier but, since you're not using the Capture Tool's deck shuttle control, it's healthier for your 
wrist too.

Here are all the things you can do when editing or trimming with Play Reverse, Pause, and 
Play Forward. Note that Capture Tool will not go one frame at a time as described later. 
Instead you could use the Step Forward One Frame button.
f
f
Press Play Forward or Play Reverse:


One time – plays/trims at the frame rate of your project (for example, 25 fps 
or 30 fps).


Two times in quick succession (for example, tap, tap) – plays/trims at two 
times (2x) the frame rate of your project (for example, 50 fps or 60 fps).


Three times in quick succession – plays/trims at three times (3x) the frame 
rate of your project.


Four times in quick succession – audio is intentionally muted. It plays/trims 
at five times (5x) the frame rate of your project.


Five times in quick succession – audio is intentionally muted. It plays/trims 
at eight times (8x) the frame rate of your project.
f
f
Press Pause at the same time as pressing either Play Forward or Play Reverse. If 
you're using these functions in their default positions, then you would be holding 
down both the K and J keys or both the K and L keys. This will play back or trim at 8 
fps in NTSC projects, 6 fps in PAL projects, and 6 fps in 24-p projects. The sound will 
have a quality similar to when analogue audio tape is scrubbed across a play head.
f
f
One Frame at a time – first, press and hold down the Pause button. Then quickly tap 
either the Play Reverse key or the Play Forward key. If you're using these functions in 
their default positions, then you would be holding down the K key and quickly tapping 
either the J key or the L key.
Fast Forward and Rewind
When you're editing, these functions are programmed to take you from one edit point 
(transition) to another. See the Understanding Track Sensitivity recipe in Chapter 3,  
Polishing Gems for important information about how this function is programmed  
and how to control its behavior.
f
f
Fast Forward and Rewind will jump you from one key frame to the next when you're 
in Effect Mode, and either the Effect Editor window or the Key Frame Position Bar 
below the Effect Monitor (also known as the Record Monitor) is active.
f
f
Stops at the Head Frame (first frame) of a clip by default. You can adjust this 
behavior by going to: Project Window | Settings tab | Composer | FF/REW.
f
f
Will stop at Markers if this behavior is enabled. Enable this by going to: Project 
Window | Settings tab | Composer | FF/REW.

Go to Previous/Next Edit
These functions are placed on the A and S keys by default. They are designed to take you 
from one edit point (transition) to the next and to also place you into Trim Mode. See the 
Understanding Track Sensitivity recipe in Chapter 3, Polishing Gems for important information 
on how this function is programmed and how to control its behavior.
Home and End (also known as Go To Start and Go To End)
You'll find these functions on your extended keyboard above the arrow keys. Further, if you're 
on a Mac, then they're just to the right of the Delete key, and if you're on a PC then they're just 
to the right of the Backspace key. 
These functions are mentioned not so much because they will quickly take you to the 
beginning or end of whatever is loaded in your Source Window or Timeline, but because 
they can be mapped wherever you want. Being able to map them is especially helpful for 
anyone without an extended keyboard, like those editing on a laptop in the field. You can find 
these functions here: Tools menu | Command Palette | Move tab. More information about 
mapping can be found in the Mapping buttons and menu selections recipe in Chapter 2, 
Customizing Your Work Environment.
Frame Offset – Jumping Forward or Backward by Typing
A Frame Offset is simply a way to tell Media Composer to move the Position Indicator (the 
blue line) a specific number of minutes, seconds, and/or frames forward (later in time) or 
backward (earlier in time).
First, let's get familiar with entering numeric values:
f
f
In order for this feature to work properly, it is important to make sure that timecode  
is displayed in the Tracking Information Menu above the Source and Record 
Monitors. Further, if you have both Tracking Information Menus displayed above 
each monitor (enabled in Project Window | Settings tab | Composer Settings | 
Window Tab | Always Display Two Rows of Data), make sure that the menu on  
top is displaying timecode.
f
f
When using the numeric keypad on an extended keyboard, the moment you begin 
typing a white entry box will appear in whichever window is active (Source or Record). 
For emphasis, you don't have to do anything other than begin entering numbers  
on the numeric keypad. When you're finished typing, press the Enter key on the 
numeric keypad.
f
f
When using a laptop (which doesn't have a numeric keypad) you first tap the Ctrl key 
two times in quick succession (tap, tap) in order to make the white entry box appear. 
When you're finished typing, press the Return key (Mac)/Enter key (PC).
f
f
You must type either a minus or a plus symbol before any numbers, otherwise Media 
Composer thinks you are entering a Timecode value (entering a timecode number is 
discussed in the section immediately following this one).
www.it-ebooks.info

Additional Tips, Tricks, and Explanations
344
f
f
Type a minus symbol before any numbers to move the Blue Line to the left of its 
current position (moving it to an earlier point in time).
f
f
Type a plus symbol before any numbers to move the Blue Line to the right of its 
current position (moving it to a later point in time).
f
f
You do not have to type a colon between the numbers. Media Composer will add 
them for you automatically as you type.
Now, let's focus on performing the Frame Offset:
f
f
The way you type is identical to the format for timecode. In other words, 
Hours:Minutes:Seconds:Frames. For example, to move the Position Indicator 
forward by 2 seconds and 15 frames in a NTSC 30-fps project, you would type +215. 
Then you'd press the Enter key. Another example is to move the Position Indicator 
backward by 20 frames, you would type -20, and then press the Enter key.
f
f
To make Media Composer always calculate in terms of frames (for values over 99 
frames), rather than seconds and frames, type a lower case letter f. For emphasis, 
do not type a capital letter F or it won't work. For example, if you were in a NTSC  
30-fps project and wanted to move forward 200 frames, you would type in +200f.  
If you didn't type the lower case letter f, then you would only go forward by 2 seconds 
(only 60 frames).
f
f
When Marking In and Out – when you use this feature along with marking in and 
out, be aware that the first frame you are parked on is included in your selection. 
For example, when you place your Mark In, this tells Media Composer that you want 
that frame as part of your selection. Then you type +20, enter (moving forward 20 
frames), and then you place the Mark Out. The result is that you have told Media 
Composer you wanted the first frame and then to add 20 more. If you look at your 
Center Duration display, you'll see that the total selection you've made is 21 frames. 
If, in the previous example, you wanted to select exactly 20 frames, you could have 
either made the adjustment when typing by entering +19, or before placing your 
Mark Out you could have used the Step Backward 1 Frame function to move back 
one frame.
f
f
Numeric Keypad Memory – a nice feature is that the numeric keypad remembers 
whatever value you've typed in until a new value is entered. For example, let's say you 
wanted to place shots exactly 2 seconds apart. First, type in +200 and hit the Enter 
key. When you want to move forward again by 2 seconds, simply hit the Enter key.
Timecode
You can make the Position Indicator jump to a specific timecode point in either the Source 
Window or Record Window/Timeline. If the timecode number exists, the Position Indicator 
will jump to it. If it does not exist, then the Position Indicator will not move and you may hear 
an alert sound from your computer (for example, bonk).

Appendix A
345
If you're not familiar with entering numeric values, please see the section above titled Frame 
Offset – Jumping Forward or Backward by Typing which includes a helpful overview of how to 
enter numeric values.
Type fewer numbers tips – for this example, let's say you have loaded a very long Master 
Clip into the Source Window. First, you glance at the Tracking Information Menu above the 
Source Window and you see that you are currently parked in the Master Clip at 02:01:11:18. 
Then, you look at your script notes and see that the producer has indicated that the shot she 
wants is at 02:09:00:00. Rather than having to type all those numbers, you could reduce it to 
pressing just three keys: 
f
f
You do not need to type the 02 value for the hours since you're already parked in that 
timecode region.
f
f
Since the minutes value begins with a zero, you can ignore it and type just a 9 value.
f
f
You do not need to type two zeroes for the seconds value. Instead, you can press 
once on the decimal key on the numeric keypad or the period key on the main 
keyboard. When you do this, you will be given two zeroes with just the one-button 
push.
f
f
Press the decimal key or the period key a second time to type two more zeroes for the 
frames value.
f
f
Pressing Enter would be button press number 4.
Step Forward and Step Backward by Frames
These functions will move you forward or backward by a set number of frames. By default, 
these functions are found in these locations and work as follows:
f
f
1 key and 2 key in the top-left of the main keyboard – moves 1/3rd the number of 
frames of the frame rate of your project. Specifically, in a 24-fps project, you'll move 
eight frames, while in a 30-fps project, you'll move 10 frames.
f
f
3 key and 4 key – moves one frame at a time.
f
f
Left Arrow key and Right Arrow key – Moves one frame at a time.
Step Forward and Step Backward by Fields
When you are stepping through interlaced video, Media Composer only shows you Field 1. 
However, when you play the video and watch it on your NTSC or PAL broadcast monitor  
(which displays both fields), you may see a dropout (a flaw) in the image every now and  
then. So, how do you verify there is a dropout on Field 2 if you can only see Field 1 when 
using the Step Forward/Backward by Frames function? Well, Media Composer does allow 
you to step through the video one field at a time.

You can find these functions here: Tools menu | Command Palette | Move tab.
f
f
Since the function pertains to fields in interlaced video, this feature is not available  
if your video format is progressive.
f
f
It is very helpful to make sure that timecode is displayed in the Tracking Information 
Menu above the Source or Record Monitors. As you step forward or backward by one 
field, watch the Frames region of the timecode. You'll notice that the value changes 
every two clicks of the Step Forward/Backward by Fields function. When you see 
the number change, you are on Field #1 and when the number does not change, you 
are on Field #2.
f
f
You should see a small, white number 2 in the top-right corner of the image area in 
the Source or Record window when you are on Field 2. My current experience is that 
this number only appears intermittently, which is most likely a small bug (error) in the 
programming that will be fixed in later releases.
f
f
Make sure that you have returned to viewing Field 1 before going back to editing, 
otherwise as you navigate, you will be viewing Field 2 when you move the Position 
Indicator (blue line) forward or backward.
f
f
When you are in Effect Mode and are using interlaced video the Step Forward/
Backward by Frames function will actually move you by Fields.
Getting more use from the Grid
This useful feature is often overlooked, so I wanted to make sure you know that it exists, and 
mention a few of its useful features.
The Grid is displayed in either the Source Window or Record Window by using the Grid 
button found in the Fast Menu Tool Palette or on the Effect Editor Window. To map the  
Grid button to a custom location, it can be found in the Tools menu | Command Palette | FX 
tab. See  the Mapping buttons and menu selections recipe in Chapter 2, Customizing Your  
Work Environment for more information if you are unfamiliar with mapping.
The Grid Setting is found in the Project Window | Settings Tab | Grid:
f
f
Coordinates | Scale Mode – allows you to display a grid that reflects a different 
aspect ratio than the one you are currently viewing. For example, let's say you're 
working with a Project Aspect Ratio of 16:9 but have to make sure to place titles 
and graphics, so that they will also be seen properly when the film or TV program is 
reformatted to show only the center 4:3 area of the image (also known as Center 
Cut or Center Extraction). In this example, you would select 4:3 Inside 16:9 Monitor. 
When you don't need this, be sure to set it back to Normal.
f
f
Coordinates | Fields Increments Entry Box – changing the value in the Fields box 
will increase or decrease the number of Tick Marks and the number of Points (a grid 
of dots). Tick Marks and Points are enabled in the grid's Display tab.

f
Display tab | Safe Title – the innermost of the two rectangles represents 80 percent 
of the image. For broadcast delivery, titles must not sit outside this area. They may 
be right on it, as is often the case when you place a speaker's name on screen (also 
known as Lower Thirds or Chyrons).
f
f
Display tab | Safe Action – this area is also called the Broadcast Safe Area. It's the 
outermost of the two rectangles and represents 90 percent of the image. While we 
can see the entire image, viewers at home are guaranteed to see only the image 
that's inside the Safe Action area. As an aside, when you're outputting for the 
Internet (a QuickTime movie, for example), the entire image (not just the Safe  
Action area) is output.
f
f
Display tab | Color – you can change the color of the Grid from the default setting of 
white to one of several other choices. I've settled on green as I find that it shows up 
well on both light and dark backgrounds.
f
f
Display tab | Axes – will display the X and Y axes. This is helpful for positioning video 
elements when creating effects.
f
f
Display tab | Tick Marks and Points (a grid of dots) – helpful for positioning video 
elements when creating effects. You can increase or decrease the number of Tick 
Marks and the number of Points by using the Coordinates | Fields Increments entry 
box. In addition, Roger Shufflebottom (one of the technical reviewers of this book) 
relates that when Points, Tick Marks, and Axes are displayed, then when you are  
in Effect Mode some effects (for example, Picture In Picture) will snap to them.
f
f
Duplicate Grid settings – you can have multiple Grid settings. See the the Settings 
overview recipe in Chapter 2, Customizing Your Work Environment for more 
information on duplicating, naming, restoring and activating settings.
cmd/Ctrl + L and K: Several uses
These keyboard shortcuts relate to selections found in the Edit Menu and are for enlarging 
and reducing several displays. cmd/Ctrl + L makes sense and is easy to remember because it 
makes things Larger. cmd/Ctrl + K well, if you speak German, then Cmd/Ctrl + K makes sense 
as well, because in German the word for smaller is Kleinere. For those of us that don't speak 
German, you'll notice that the letter K is to the left of the letter L on the QWERTY keyboard.
These keyboard shortcuts will do different things, depending on which window is active when 
you use them:
f
f
Bin Window – when a bin is in either Frame View or Script View, using these 
shortcuts will enlarge/reduce the size of the thumbnail image for the clip.
f
f
Timeline – will enlarge or reduce the height of tracks that have their Track Selectors 
enabled (on either the Source side or the Record/Timeline side). More information 
on Track Height is given later.

f
f
Record Window or Source Window – the purpose for the shortcuts here are  
to Enlarge/Reduce (zoom in/out) the display image. This is useful in the Effect 
Monitor (also known as the Record Monitor) when creating various video effects  
(for example, enlarging is helpful when Corner Pinning). Sometimes users find 
themselves enlarging or reducing the display image by mistake when they mean  
to use these keyboard shortcuts to enlarge/reduce the width of their timeline  
tracks and don't realize that the Record or Source window is selected instead.  
More information on this is given next.
Enlarge/reduce display image tips:
Following are a few tips that will come in handy while enlarging or reducing the display image: 
f
f
When enlarged or reduced, a small white number will appear in the upper-right corner 
to indicate the zoom level (for example, 2x, or 50 percent).The normal display will not 
have any number appearing. So, do not be confused when you see 1x. This is relating 
that there is a 1:1 (one- to-one) relationship between the pixels in the video and the 
pixels on the computer monitor. This actually makes the image larger, and the entire 
image is not seen.
f
f
When the image is enlarged, you can reposition it by first pressing, and holding, 
option + cmd (Mac) or Alt + Ctrl (PC). This will change your arrow cursor into a hand 
cursor. Then, at the same time you press the keys, hold down the left mouse button 
and you can then drag the image around to reposition it.
f
f
You can quickly return to a normal display size with the shortcut option + cmd + L 
(Mac) or Alt + Ctrl + L (PC).
More on track height:
Let's take a look at couple of options to adjust the track height: 
f
f
You can also adjust the track height dynamically using the option/Alt key. Press and 
hold option/Alt (if Alt does not work, try the Ctrl key), then place your cursor between 
two Track Selectors. The resize icon will appear (a black line with arrows pointing up 
and down). You will be adjusting the height for the track which is above the resize 
icon. Hold down the mouse button and drag up or down to resize the track.
f
f
cmd/Ctrl + K and L adjusts track height, but of you add option/Alt: option/Alt + cmd/
Ctrl + K or option/Alt + cmd/Ctrl +L, then you will be adjusting the height of the 
Waveform, if it is displayed.

Ways to lock clips: 


Select the clip(s) and go to Clip menu | Lock or Unlock; or select the clip(s) 
and right-click on the selected clip(s), and select Lock or Unlock.


When a clip is locked, you can not easily delete the clip or the media files 
that it links to. Notice that I didn't say that it's impossible to delete the clip or 
the linked media files. First, it's obvious from the Unlock selection that clips 
and media can be unlocked from inside of Media Composer. But what's not 
obvious is that media files can be unlocked at the Operating System Level 
even when Media Composer isn't running.


Trimming terminology
Before we get into Trimming, it will be helpful to be familiar with a couple of terms. So, in this 
section, we'll discuss A-Side and B-Side as well as the concept of HANDLE.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Details on Trimming, Slipping, Sliding, and Segment Mode
352
A-Side/B-Side
When you are editing (for example, using Splice and Lift, and so on), the Composer Window 
displays two monitors. The Source Monitor is on the left-hand side and the Record Monitor is 
on the right-hand side.
However, when you are Trimming shots longer or shorter (we'll talk about Slipping and Sliding 
later), monitors of the Composer Window change their display. The left monitor is displaying 
the tail frame (the last frame) of the shot on the left-hand side of the transition (the cut), while 
the right monitor is displaying the head frame (the first frame) of the shot on the right-hand 
side of the cut. However, we need a more generic and succinct way to describe them. So, we 
refer to the shot on the left-hand side of the transition as the A-side shot and the shot on 
the right-hand side, as you guessed it, the B-side shot. You may also hear people refer to the 
A-side shot as the outgoing shot and the B-side as the incoming shot. I'll be sticking with the 
terms A-side and B-side.
Handle
Handle is the material that was not edited into the Sequence, but is still available in the clip.
­
Handle gets revealed when you trim a Segment longer (of course, once it's revealed it's no 
longer Handle). On the other hand, when you trim a Segment shorter you are creating Handle. 
Further, Handle also comes into play whenever you apply a transition effect (for example, a 
dissolve). The transition effect uses the material in the Handle to do its job creating the effect.

Trimming icons and colors
With the introduction of the Smart Tool in Media Composer 5, there are more things to be 
aware of. Here's an overview of what the Trim Rollers and the colors indicate.
f
f
Single Roller: When you have just one roller, at a transition on a track, it means that 
you are trimming just one side of the transition on that track. In other words, you are 
only trimming just the A-side or just the B-side shot at the transition on that track (see 
the previous Trimming terminology section).
f
f
Double Rollers: When there are two rollers side by side at a transition it means that 
you are affecting both shots on either side of the transition at the same time. In other 
words, you are trimming both the A-side and the B-side, adding material to one shot 
(extending it) while simultaneously removing the exact same amount of material from 
the other (shortening it).
f
f
Yellow: Yellow tools indicate that they have the power to change duration of tracks. 
For example, Splice adds material to the track, which lengthens it, and pushes other 
segments down the Timeline to the right. Extract removes material from the track, 
which shortens it, and the remaining material on the track then moves to the left. 
When trimming with a single roller which is yellow, Avid refers to this as a Ripple 
Trim. For those that have used the software prior to the Smart Tool, the behavior of 
yellow, single roller trimming is identical to single roller trimming in the past. When 
you're adding material to a segment (a shot) with the yellow Ripple Trim, shots to the 
right-hand side of it are pushed down the timeline to the right. When you're removing 
material from a segment, shots to the right of it are pulled up the Timeline to the left.
f
f
Red: Red tools indicate that they do not change the duration of tracks. For example, 
Overwrite places new material into the Timeline on top of whatever was there. It's 
not adding additional material, it's simply replacing it. So, the duration of the track 
remains the same. Lift removes material from the Timeline, and it maintains the 
duration of that track by leaving behind an equal amount of Filler. When trimming 
with a single roller which is red, Avid refers to this as an Overwrite Trim. I quibble with 
this name a bit as I think it should be called Overwrite-Lift Trim. When you're adding 
material to a segment (a shot) with the red Overwrite Trim, the adjacent segment 
that's in the path of the trim is actually overwritten. In other words, material from the 
segment you're extending (adding to) is replacing the adjacent shot's material. Note 
that when you're extending a segment with the red Trim Roller, the result is identical 
to using Double Roller Trim. On the other hand, when you're removing material 
from a segment (shortening it), the red Trim Roller leaves Filler behind in order to 
maintain the duration of that track (just like when you perform a Lift).
f
f
Purple: Whenever you have two Trim Rollers on a track, they will be purple. Purple 
rollers will appear when you are in Double Roller Trim, Slipping, and Sliding.

How Trimming works
To be concise, the way that editing works with Media Composer (and other nonlinear editing 
applications) is that rather than make permanently destructive changes to the actual picture 
and audio files (the media), it instead makes changes to the references to the media. 
However, let me give you some detail.
Let's start at the beginning. A clip (for example, Master Clip) in your bin is not actually the 
picture and/or audio file. It's just a reference to it. The classic analogy (most likely given to  
me by Greg Staten many years ago) is this:
In a time before computers, libraries used a card catalog to help you locate books. These  
were filing cabinets which held small, paper index cards.

Appendix B
355
The cards contained helpful information about a book such as the author, publication date, 
number of pages, a short synopsis, and so on. It also contained the all-important Dewey 
Decimal System number that was assigned to that book, so you could locate it in the 
expansive library. Obviously, that small card was not the book. Its purpose was to point you 
to the book. Well, that's similar to how clips and media work together too. A clip is a small 
collection of information that points to (in Avid terminology, links to) the media:
Now let's turn to Sequences. A sequence is really just a collection of references. Each shot 
(known in Avid terminology as a Segment) is a reference that tells Media Composer what 
image to show and/or what audio to play from a media file when you press play.
My analogy is this: the media are like books and the Segments in the Sequence are like 
reading assignments for Media Composer. The reading assignment of each Segment can  
be lengthened or shortened (trimmed) with no affect on the actual book (the media).

Enabling and configuring the Trimming Tools
Media Composer provides editors with multiple ways to do things so you can have flexibility, 
depending on your personal preference or on what will work best at a particular moment. In 
this section we'll cover the different ways to enable the Trim tools (also known as Trim Mode) 
as well as the different methods for selecting (configuring) what to trim.
Methods for entering Trim Mode
There are four methods to enter Trim Mode:
f
f
Method 1 is to park the Position Indictor (the blue line) near the transition of the 
shot(s) you want to trim, enable the Track Selector(s) for the track(s) you want to trim, 
then click/press the Trim Mode button. By default, the Trim Mode button can be 
found in the following locations:


On the Composer Window (also known as the Source/Record Window), 
underneath the Splice and Overwrite buttons


On the far left-hand side of the Timeline Toolbar


Mapped to the keyboard on the letter U


Some of the trim tools can be found on the Smart Tool. More information 
about Trimming and the using the Smart Tool is later in this appendix
f
f
Method 2 is to use the Go To Previous and Go To Next Edit functions. By default, 
these are mapped to the A and S keys on the keyboard. See the the Understanding 
Track Sensitivity recipe in Chapter 3, Polishing Gems for more information on  
using them.
f
f
Method 3 is to Lasso. Lassoing to select segments and lassoing to enter Slip or Slide 
mode are discussed in sections later in this appendix. Right now we're focusing on 
lassoing single transitions on one or more tracks. This is done by clicking and holding 
the mouse button in the Timeline Window (the area outside the actual tracks) and 
then drawing a selection box (the lasso) around the transition(s) you want to trim. 
If you're not already in Trim Mode when you lasso, then it will be activated, which 
makes it a really great, fast way to get into Trim Mode. Following are some examples 
of lassoing to get into Trim Mode. The last example (lassoing inside the Timeline) is 
particularly helpful.

Single transition: The next image attempts to illustrate clicking in the 
Timeline Window, holding down the mouse button, and drawing the 
selection box (the lasso) around just one transition. It's important to note 
that the lasso must totally surround the transition in order to select it and 
enter into Trim Mode.


Multiple transitions: The next image attempts to illustrate clicking in the 
Timeline Window, holding down the mouse button, and drawing the lasso 
box around multiple transitions. Note that even Split Edits can be lassoed 
and trimmed.



Lasso inside the Timeline. When you have many tracks in your Sequence, 
there's a pretty good chance that you won't have easy access to the Timeline 
Window background area in order to click and make a lasso. Even so, it's 
still possible to lasso. All you have to do is press and hold the option/Alt key 
as you click inside the Timeline tracks and lasso the transition(s) you want.
f
f
Method 4 is to return to the last used Trim roller configuration. This is a very useful 
feature, especially when you've just performed a multi-track Asymmetric trim 
(discussed in Chapter 4, Creating Split Edits which covers making Split Edits as well 
as in Chapter 5, Maintaining and Regaining Sync. After exiting Trim Mode, you can 
re-enter Trim Mode and have the Trim Rollers placed into the very last configuration 
you used. To do this:
i.	
Press and hold option/Alt.
ii.	
Do one of the following:


Press the Trim Mode button on the keyboard (by default on the letter U)


Click on the Trim Mode button in the interface (for example, on the 
Composer Window, below the Splice and Overwrite buttons)

Configuring the Trim Rollers
Once you're in Trim Mode, the next thing you have to do is tell Media Composer exactly what 
you want to trim on each track by configuring the Trim Rollers. Here's how:
f
f
Clicking on the Composer Window:


A-Side Monitor (left window): When you're in Trim Mode and hover your 
cursor over the A-Side monitor, you'll see that the cursor icon has changed 
from an arrow to what looks a bit like a film canister (it's actually the Trim 
Roller icon) with a piece of film extending out from it. Since the cursor is 
hovering over the A-Side monitor (the left of the two monitors) the piece of 
film extends out to the left-hand side. If you click at this time, then you'll see 
that the Trim Roller(s) in the Timeline have been placed onto the A-Side 
(left-hand side) shot at the transition. This is known as a Ripple Trim.


B-Side Monitor (right window): Just like A-Side earlier, except that you'll be 
hovering over the B-Side monitor and the piece of film in the icon extends out 
to the right. Clicking the mouse at this time will configure the Trim Rollers 
onto the B-Side (right-hand side) shot at the transition. Again, this is known 
as a Ripple Trim and you'll see that the Trim Rollers are yellow.


Between the A-Side and B-Side Monitors: Rather than hovering your cursor 
over the A or B-Side Monitor, you'll place it in a region between the two. When 
the cursor is in this region, it will display two pieces of film, each extending 
out in both directions. Clicking the mouse at this time will configure the Trim 
Rollers in the Timeline onto both the A-Side and the B-Side shots at the 
transition. This is called Double Roller Trim or Dual Roller Trim.
f
f
Clicking on the Trim Counters: When you're in Trim Mode, you'll see two purple boxes 
right below the monitor screens. These will display how much you have trimmed 
for the A-Side and/or the B-Side shot at the transition. You can also click on these 
displays as a way to configure the Trim Rollers in the Timeline.
f
f
P, [, and ] keys: – By default, Avid has mapped the Trim Roller configuration buttons 
to the following three keys: P, [, and ]. Pressing the P key will configure the Trim 
Rollers onto the A-Side. The [ key will place them on both the A-Side and B-Side 
(Double Rollers). The ] key will configure the Trim Rollers onto the B-Side.
f
f
Cycle Trim – in the Command Palette (Tools menu | Command Palette | Trim 
tab), you'll find the Cycle Trim function that lets you press this one button to shuffle 
through the different configurations. When you're in Trim Mode, each time you press 
it, it switches to the next configuration, cycling through them. Information on mapping 
this to the keyboard can be found in the Mapping buttons and menu selections 
recipe in Chapter 2, Customizing Your Work Environment.

f
f
Shift + click to add or remove Trim Rollers: – This technique allows you to manually 
configure any trimming setup you want, and is essential to be able to perform the 
highly useful Asymmetric Trim (discussed in Chapters 4, Creating Split Edits and 
Chapter 5, Maintaining and Regaining Sync). It's very important to pay attention to 
the cursor icon in the Timeline when Shift-Clicking. The direction the piece of film 
extends indicates which side of the transition you are over. The following are two 
images to help describe the Shift + click feature:
In the image on the left, Shift + click at this moment would add a Trim Roller on the A-Side 
(left-hand side) of the transition. In the image on the right, Shift + click at this moment would 
remove the Trim Roller on the B-Side.
Trimming methods
Media Composer provides you with multiple methods to perform a trim to give you flexibility, 
depending on your personal preference, or for what will work best at a particular moment.
f
f
Trim Keys (Interface) – the Trim Keys can be accessed on the interface when in Trim 
Mode (see the next screenshot). The only caution here is not to click on the Step 
Forward/Reverse keys by mistake, since they do not trim and will exit you from Trim 
Mode. You can, however, use Fast Forward and Rewind to jump from transition to 
transition and remain in Trim Mode.

Appendix B
361
f
f
Trim Keys (Keyboard) – found on the keyboard in the bottom-right corner. By default, 
they are on the keys M, comma, period, and forward slash. It's important to note that 
the Trim Keys on the keyboard also have a function even when you're not in Trim 
Mode. Specifically, they Slip segments (discussed in this appendix in the section 
titled Slipping Outside of Trim Mode).
f
f
Numeric Keypad – you can type in a specific number of seconds and frames (or feet 
and frames if you're in a film project) that you'd like to trim. When you do this, the two 
purple trim counter displays will be replaced by a value entry box. The important thing 
to know here is that Media Composer needs to know which direction you want the Trim 
Roller(s) to trim. To instruct it to trim to the left, you type a minus sign before entering 
a numeric value and pressing the Enter key. To trim to the right, type a plus sign before 
entering a numeric value and pressing the Enter key. Here are two examples:
In the image on the left, the Trim Rollers are on the A-Side (left-hand side) shot of the 
transition. To make this shot longer by 48 frames, using the numeric keypad, you'd type in 
+48, then press the Enter key. The + tells Media Composer to trim to the right (in a positive 
direction). In the image on the right, the Trim Rollers are on the B-Side shot of the transition. 
To make this shot longer by 60 frames, using the numeric keypad, you'd type in –60, then 
press the Enter key. The – tells Media Composer to trim to the left (in a negative direction). 
What can be confusing is that the plus and minus signs are not telling Media Composer to 
add or subtract. They are instead telling it which direction to perform the trim.

362
A bonus feature of using the Numeric Key Pad is that after you have used it to make a trim, 
the value you entered remains in its memory. So, if you want to trim by that same amount  
in the future, just press the Enter key. The value remains in the memory until you type in a 
new value.
f
f
JKL Trimming – also referred to as Three Button Trimming or Dynamic Trimming. This is 
one of the most (if not the most) useful editing features. If you haven't used it before, 
give it a try. The more you use it, the more comfortable with it you'll become. And once 
you're comfortable with it, you'll find yourself trimming faster and more intuitively than 
ever. For more information on all that JKL can do, see the Moving Around: Methods and 
tips section in Appendix A, Additional Tips, Tricks, and Explanations. For a discussion on 
remapping the JKL functions, see the Mapping buttons and menu selections recipe in 
Chapter 2, Customizing Your Work Environment.
f
f
Dragging in the Timeline – you can click to grab the Trim Rollers directly in the 
Timeline and drag left or right in order to perform a trim. The addition of the Smart 
Tool increased these abilities (more information about the Smart Tool is later in this 
appendix). The one issue to be aware of when grabbing Trim Rollers is making sure 
that you are indeed grabbing the roller and not mistakenly instructing Media Composer 
to change the Trim Roller configuration to the opposite side. The key to this is to pay 
attention and make sure that the Trim Roller in the Timeline and your cursor's trim icon 
indicate the same side of the transition. Following are two examples:
Screenshot on the left: If the goal is to trim the A-Side (left-hand side) shot at the transition, 
then the picture on the left is correct. It's correct because the cursor icon has its little piece of 
film extending out of it pointing to the left (facing to the A-Side) while it's hovering over a Trim 
Roller in the Timeline which is also on the A-Side. In this situation, clicking and holding the 
mouse button and then dragging will indeed trim the A-Side shot. 
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Appendix B
363
Screenshot on the left: If the goal is to trim the A-Side shot at the transition, then the picture 
on the right is not correct. It's incorrect because the Trim Rollers in the Timeline are on the 
A-Side, but the cursor icon has its little piece of film extending out of it pointing to the B-Side. 
Clicking the mouse button in this situation would tell Media Composer to move the Trim 
Rollers to the B-Side.
The exception to the previous rule is Double Roller Trim. In this case, it doesn't matter which 
direction your cursor's piece of film extends when you grab. In other words, when you're in 
Double Roller Trim, you can grab the rollers when the cursor icon faces either direction. Why? 
The reason it doesn't display a Double Roller icon is that when you're using the Shift + click 
method to configure the Trim Rollers, you need the cursor icon to display as either A-Side or 
B-Side (the Shift + click method is discussed earlier in this appendix in the the Enabling and 
configuring the Trim tools recipe).
f
f
Trim while Looping – when you enter Trim Mode, the Play button automatically 
transforms into the Play Loop function wherever it's located (for example, on the 
Space bar). What's sometimes useful is that when you are looping the transition you 
can also trim. To be clear, you must have pressed the Play Loop button and the loop 
must be in progress for the following abilities to work:


Use the Trim Keys on the keyboard (by default on the M, comma, period, and 
forward slash keys) – while the loop is in progress, tap any of the Trim Keys 
on the keyboard as many times as you like. For example, to trim three frames 
to the right while the looping is in progress, you'd tap the period key three 
times in quick succession (tap, tap, tap). It may take a moment for the trim to 
actually take effect, so you may need to let the loop complete its cycle to see 
the result. This is a particularly useful ability when you need to trim just one 
or two frames at a time.


Mark In or Mark Out – while the loop is in progress, press either the  
Mark In or Mark Out button on the keyboard (it doesn't matter which)  
and the segment will be trimmed to the point at which you pressed the  
In or Out Mark.
f
f
Isolate the Loop – when using the Play Loop trimming tricks previously, you may 
find it helpful to change the loop from playing both the A-Side and the B-Side to only 
playing one or the other side. While the loop is in progress, press the Go To Mark In 
button on the keyboard (by default on the letter Q key). The loop will then occur only 
on the A-Side. While it's looping just the A-Side, if you press the Go To Mark In button 
(Q key) a second time, the loop will return to looping both sides. The same behavior 
is true for the Go To Mark Out button (by default on the letter W key), except that it 
loops only the B-Side of the transition.

Monitoring during Trimming
When you're Double Roller trimming, Slipping, or Sliding, there is a simple method to tell 
Media Composer what you want to hear, or to focus on visually, as you're trimming. This is 
done with what Avid calls the Trim Monitors. These are the green lights below the purple trim 
counters. The arrow in the next screenshot points to the green monitor light for the A-Side, 
while the light on the B-Side is off and is colored gray.
When you're in Double Roller Trim Mode, all you have to do is momentarily hover (don't click) 
your cursor over either the A-Side Trim Monitor (the left monitor displaying the image) or over 
the B-Side Trim Monitor. Notice that if you move your cursor back and forth across the two 
that the green monitor light will change as well.
f
f
Example 1: You're in Double Roller Trim Mode on track A2. On the A-Side (left-hand 
side) of the transition is audio and on the B-Side is Filler, which of course is silent. In 
this case I'd want to have the green monitor light on the A-Side, so that as I trimmed 
in real time, using JKL, I could hear the audio at the same time.
f
f
Example 2: When Slipping a shot, you can choose to monitor either the Head Frame 
(the first frame) of the shot or the Tail Frame by momentarily hovering your cursor 
over one or the other to set the green monitor light. Then, as you trim in real time 
using JKL, you'll also see the selected image update in real time. Also note that if you 
have a third Client Monitor (a PAL or NTSC monitor) attached to your editing system, 
then the image you have selected for monitoring is also displayed there.

Slipping with Trim Mode
Slipping is part of the trimming set of features. It is used for shifting a shot's contents to 
reveal earlier or later material. It has a brother, called Sliding and it has a cousin that can also 
Slip a shot, except it does it without being in Trim Mode. All of this is covered in this appendix, 
but let's begin with Slipping.
Slipping allows you to adjust a shot in your Sequence to reveal earlier or later material from its 
source clip without changing the shot's duration. First, here's what Slipping a video segment 
(the FRANKY segment), along with the audio that belongs with it, looks like in the following 
screenshot:
After the list of steps to perform a Slip, below, you will find an example that illustrates what 
Slipping is doing.
Method 1 is a very fast way to enter Slip Mode (also known as Slipping) and methods 2, 3, 
4, and 5 are important to know in case you need to Slip the first or last Segment (shot) in a 
Sequence where lassoing may not work.

f
f
Method 1: Lasso while in Trim Mode or Source/Record Mode:


In this instance, you'll be lassoing a very specific direction (see earlier 
in  the Enabling and configuring the Trimming Tools recipe for details on 
lassoing). You'll lasso from right to left entirely around a Segment in order 
to tell Media Composer that you want to Slip it. You can lasso around just a 
video Segment, or just the audio segment(s), or you can lasso both the video 
and the audio that goes with it if the two need to stay in sync. It's important 
to note that while Media Composer will allow you to lasso from right to left 
around multiple Segments that are next to each other, here I am talking 
about lassoing only one segment and any others that belong with it (for 
example, a video segment and the audio that belongs with it, as with the 
FRANKY shot in the next screenshot):
f
f
Method 2: Double-click while already in Trim Mode:
i.	
Enter Trim Mode at any transition.
ii.	
For the Segment (shot) you want to Slip, place the cursor at one of its 
transitions, either the head or the tail. For emphasis, you will be placing 
your cursor either on an existing Trim Roller or in the location where a 
Trim Roller would appear if it were there (see the next screenshot).
iii.	 Pay close attention to the cursor icon. Make sure that the little piece of 
film that extends from the roller is facing the Segment you want to Slip. 
In the next screenshot, I want to Slip the shot of FRANKY. So, before I 
double-click, I've made sure that the cursor icon's piece of film extends 
towards the shot of FRANKY:

Appendix B
367
iv.	 When the cursor's icon is facing the Segment that you want to Slip, then 
double-click, in order to enter Slip Mode.
v.	
If you need to select an additional segment(s) in order to stay in sync 
(for example, you've initially entered Slip Mode on the video segment, 
but now want to include the audio segment that belongs with it), you can 
either Shift + double-click on the audio segment(s) as you did with the 
video segment or you can enable the required Track Selector(s).
f
f
Method 3: Shift + click to configure the Trim Rollers while already in Trim Mode. The 
Shift + click method to configure the Trim Rollers is explained earlier in this appendix 
in the Enabling and configuring the trimming tools recipe.
f
f
Method 4: Using Segment Mode:
i.	
Enable either Overwrite/Lift Segment Mode (red arrow) or Extract/
Splice-In Segment Mode (yellow arrow). It doesn't matter which one as 
this is just being used to make a selection.
ii.	
Select the video Segment you want to Slip. If there is audio that belongs 
with that video, then Shift + select that Segment(s) as well. Note that 
you can slip audio and video separately if/when needed.
iii.	 With the Segment(s) selected, press/click the Trim Mode button on 
the keyboard or on the interface and you will be placed into the Slip 
configuration of trimming.
f
f
Method 5: While you are in Trim Mode, right-click on a Segment and, from the menu 
that appears, choose Select Slip Trim.
Now let's take a closer look at the configuration of the Trim Rollers as well as the display that 
is presented to us when we're Slipping in Trim Mode.

368
The Rollers – frequently, people will describe Slipping as when the Trim Rollers are on the 
inside of the segment. Rather than saying that the rollers are on the inside, I prefer to point 
out that the rollers are touching only that segment. The idea here is that whatever shot the 
Trim Rollers are touching is the shot that is being affected. This will become even more 
apparent when I talk about Sliding just a bit later.
The Four Image Display – when you're Slipping a video segment Media Composer will  
display four images. 
In the screenshot below, we are Slipping the FRANKY Segment, and the the images in the 
display are the following: 
f
f
A is the last frame in the ARTIE segment
f
f
B is the first frame in the segment you're Slipping (the FRANKY segment)
f
f
C is the last frame in the segment you're Slipping

D is the first frame in the BANDIT segment

What's happening – first, when you slip, you are not changing the duration of the shot that 
is in your Sequence. What you are doing, however, is shifting (Slipping) what images and/or 
audio is referenced (played) from the original Master Clip during that same amount of time. 
The following screenshots will take you through an example.
The following screenshot illustrates all the frames that are within a Master Clip of a ball 
rolling across the floor.

In the screenshot above, I've grabbed the Trim Roller and dragged a bit to the left. During the 
Slipping process, Media Composer displays a ghosted outline of the segment. Often this is 
confusing. What that ghosted outline is telling you is that it is looking (referring) to earlier or later 
material within its original Master Clip. In this instance, as I Slip to the left, the ghosted outline 
is telling me that it is looking at earlier material from its Master Clip.

The previous screenshot shows the result of Slipping the shot to the left, revealing earlier 
frames from the Master Clip. For emphasis, the duration of the FRANKY shot has not 
changed, but now we see earlier frames from the Master Clip.
Slipping outside of Trim Mode 
Slipping allows you to adjust a shot in your Sequence to reveal earlier or later material from  
its source clip without changing the shot's duration.
The previous section discussed Slipping a shot in Trim Mode and, as usual, the helpful 
engineers at Avid have programmed Media Composer to be able to Slip a shot in more than 
one way. This second method also provides you with a syncing ability that's not inherently 
available with Slipping in Trim Mode.
While you will not be in Trim Mode, you will be using the Trim Keys on the keyboard.  
For emphasis, this feature only works when using the Trim Keys on the keyboard when  
not in Trim Mode.
The "how" part is very easy, and the steps are below. After the steps, are an explanation,  
and an example that will provide some context for you:
1.	 Park the Position Indicator (the blue line) on a Segment.
2.	 Enable only the track(s) you want to Slip.
3.	 Press any of the Trim Keys on the keyboard to Slip the segment(s). By default, you'll 
find the Trim Keys on the M, comma, period, and forward slash keys.
Remember that Slipping allows you to adjust a shot in your Sequence to reveal earlier or later 
material from its source clip without changing the shot's duration.
Imagine that the Segment you're Slipping is a window that reveals the selected frames from 
the Master Clip behind it (see the following screenshot). When you Slip a segment using the 
Trim Keys, it's as if the window is locked in place and you're shifting the Master Clip left or 
right behind it.

When you shift (Slip) the shot to the right, all the frames within it are shifted to the right, and 
the result is that the frame at the Head (beginning) of the shot will come from an earlier part 
of the Source Clip. In the previous screenshot, we can see frames 6, 7, 8, and 9 through the 
window. If we shifted the numbered frames to the right, then it would reveal frames 2, 3, 4, 
and 5.
When you shift (Slip) the Segment to the left, the result is that the frame at the Tail (end) of 
the Segment will come from a later part of the Source Clip. In the previous screenshot, we 
can see frames 6, 7, 8, and 9 through the window. If we shifted the numbered frames to the 
left, then it could reveal frames 11, 12, 13, and 14.
This is often confusing since this behavior is the opposite of when you're Slipping a shot  
using Trim Mode.
How to do it…
Let's take a look at a specific example where Slipping outside of Trim Mode is very helpful. In 
the example provided in a moment, you could achieve the same result by Slipping with Trim 
Mode. However, it would involve a bit more work on your part using at least one Marker, and 
who wants extra work, right? In the particular situation that I'll be describing, the Slipping 
outside of Trim Mode method would be the most direct path to the objective and also 
showcases the syncing ability that's not inherently available when Slipping in Trim Mode.
Here is the situation: You are editing a commercial for a company that makes tools. The ad 
features close-up shots of various tools (a drill, a saw, a hammer, and so on) that are being 
used in a workshop. Along with the images, you've edited in some upbeat music.
At one spot in the commercial, you notice that there is a loud drum beat (arrow A in the next 
screenshot), and about half a second later in the video the hammer strikes a nail (arrow "B" 
in the next screenshot). You think that it would work well if the hammer struck the nail at the 
same time as the drum beat. You decide to Slip the video segment of the hammer (without 
using Trim Mode) to sync with the drum beat.

1.	 Park the Position Indicator at the point where the drum beat occurs (arrow A in the 
screenshot above).
2.	 Enable only the V1 Track Selector (since you only want to slip the video).
3.	 Watch the image in the Record Monitor. You are seeing whatever frame is occurring 
where the Position Indicator (blue line) is placed.
4.	 Press the Trim One Frame Left key (by default on the comma key) several times. 
Keep tapping it until the image of the hammer hitting the nail appears in the Record 
Monitor and syncs with the drum beat.
5.	 You have now shifted (Slipped) the video segment to the left. In the Sequence, the 
shot of the hammer hitting the nail remains the same duration, but it now starts and 
ends on later frames from the Master Clip than it did before the Slip.
Sliding in Trim Mode
Like Slipping, Sliding is part of the trimming set of features. Sliding allows you to move one  
or more segments (shots) earlier or later in the Sequence. In other words, Sliding let's you 
move one or more shots to the left or to the right in the Sequence.
After the list of steps, there is an example to illustrate what Sliding is doing and how it  
might be used.

There are four methods available to enable Sliding (also known as Slide Mode). Let's take a 
look at each:
f
f
Method 1 is to Lasso while in Trim Mode or Source/Record Mode:


First, if you're unfamiliar Lassoing, it is discussed in more detail in this 
appendix in the Enabling and configuring the trimming tools recipe.


In this instance, you'll be pressing both the Shift key + option/Alt key at the 
same time as lassoing a very specific direction: from right to left around a 
Segments(s). You can lasso around just a video segment, or just the audio 
segment(s), or you can lasso both the video and the audio that goes with it/
them if they need to stay in sync. The next screenshots show Shift + option/
Alt + lassoing the SAMMY video segment and then the resulting Slide 
configuration of the Trim Rollers after lassoing.

f
f
Method 2: While already in Trim Mode, here are the steps:
i.	
Enter Trim Mode at any transition.
ii.	
For the Segment (shot) you want to Slide, place the cursor at one of its 
transitions, either the head or the tail (see the next screenshot). For 
emphasis, place the cursor either where a Trim Roller already exists, or 
where it would appear if one was there.
iii.	 Pay close attention to the cursor icon. Make sure that the little piece of 
film that extends from the roller is facing the Segment you want to Slide. 
In the next screenshot, the Trim Roller icon is set up for the KATIE shot.
iv.	 When the cursor's icon is facing the Segment you want to Slide, then 
double-click. This will initially place you into Slip Mode (also known  
as Slipping).
v.	
Without changing the position of your cursor, double-click again.  
This will place you into Slide Mode (also known as Sliding).
vi.	 If you need to select an additional segment(s) in order to stay in sync, for 
example, you've initially entered Slide Mode on the video segment but 
now want to include the audio segment(s) that belongs with it, you can 
either Shift + double-click as you did with the first Segment, or you can 
enable the required Track Selectors.
f
f
Method 3 is to perform Shift + click method to configure the Trim Rollers while 
already in Trim Mode:


The Shift + click method to configure the Trim Rollers is explained earlier  
in this appendix in the Enabling and configuring the trimming tools recipe
f
f
Method 4: While you are in Trim Mode, right-click on a Segment and, from the menu 
that appears, choose Select Slide Trim.

376
Now that you know how to enable Sliding, let's take a closer look at the Trim Rollers and the 
Four Image Display when Sliding.
The Rollers – frequently, people will describe Sliding as when the Trim Rollers are on the 
outside of the segment (see the next screenshot). Rather than saying that the rollers are on 
the outside, I prefer to point out that the rollers are touching the adjacent segments. The idea 
here is that whatever shots the Trim Rollers are touching are the shots that are being made 
longer or shorter while the shot(s) between the rollers get shifted (Slid) either to the left or to 
the right. When you Slide, it's as if the shot(s) between the rollers are on a moving conveyor 
belt. For emphasis, in the next screenshot, we can see that the Trim Rollers are touching 
the Segments (shots) labeled as MIKE and SAMMY. Therefore, the Segments that we will be 
Sliding are labeled as LEAH and KATIE.
The Four Image Display (see the next screenshot) – when you're Sliding a video segment(s), 
Media Composer will display four images. In the next screenshot, I've set up to Slide two 
shots, the LEAH and KATIE shots. The four images in the display are the following:
f
f
A is the last frame of the Mike shot
f
f
B is the first frame of the Leah shot
f
f
C is the last frame of the Katie shot
f
f
D is the first frame of the Sammy shot
As you're Sliding, it will be images A and D that will change, since those are the shots that are 
being trimmed.

Appendix B
377
What's happening – First, when you Slide, you are not changing the duration of the shot(s) 
that you are moving in your Sequence (in this example, LEAH and KATIE). What you are doing, 
however, is lengthening and shortening the adjacent shots (MIKE and SAMMY). The next 
screenshot will take you through an example:
The previous screenshot illustrates a situation where there is a distinct drum beat in the 
music (arrow A). Arrow B points to the transition between shots that we'd like to have occur at 
the same time as the drum beat. After more closely examining the Sequence, we decide that 
we want to slide not just the LEAH shot, but also the KATIE shot that comes right after it.
Here are the steps:
1.	 Press Shift + option/Alt and lasso from right to left around both the LEAH and KATIE 
video segments.
2.	 Use the Trim Keys (or any trimming method you prefer) to shift (Slide) the LEAH and 
KATIE segments to the left until the transition syncs with the drum beat.
3.	 The next screenshot shows the LEAH and KATIE shots after they have been shifted 
(Slid) to the left (earlier in the Sequence). The arrows show that the transition and the 
drum beat now occur at the same time. The results to the shots are as follows:


Shot A (MIKE) is now shorter


Shots B and C (LEAH and KATIE) are the same duration, but now occur 
earlier in the Sequence

Shot D (SAMMY) is now longer
Trimming and effects
There is a feature that tells Media Composer to compute and display an effect (for example, a 
dissolve or a Picture-in-Picture) whenever the Position Indicator is placed on it. This feature is 
called Render On-The-Fly, and is found in two locations.
The first location it can be found is: Special menu | Render On-The-Fly. When you're in 
Source/Record Mode, this feature is enabled by default. This is why when you place the 
Position Indicator on a dissolve (or another effect) that you can see it.
The second location you'll find Render On-The-Fly is in your Trim Settings: Project Window | 
Settings tab | Trim settings | Features tab. Here you'll notice that this feature is disabled by 
default. This is because it can often be frustrating to have to deal with seeing an effect (for 
example, a dissolve) when you're attempting to trim a shot. However, what if you're trimming 
a layered video effect you've constructed that includes multiple video tracks? In that case, 
there's a good likelihood that being able to see what is happening in the video layers as you 
trim would be helpful. So, now you know where to enable that feature when you need it.
Smart Tool overview
At its most basic, the Smart Tool is a palette of tools that can be enabled/disabled 
individually, just like you're used to doing with the Red and Yellow Segment Mode Arrows. 
However, its real power is providing the ability to enable two or more individual tools 
simultaneously, which provides access to them in the Timeline simultaneously. What's nice 
is that with the addition of the Smart Tool, the engineers didn't remove the original methods 
from the software and simply gave us more options.

Mapped to locations of your choice using the Command Palette. The Smart Tools 
have their own tab on the Command Palette.
Smart Tool – enabling one or more functions on the Smart Tool essentially tells Media 
Composer that those are the functions you like to use. Then you can enable/disable them  
all simultaneously by:
f
f
Clicking on the Left Edge of the Smart Tool (labeled above as Smart Tool Toggle).
f

After enabling the Smart Tool, you are provided access to multiple tools (of your 
choosing) based on where you place your cursor in the Timeline, allowing you to 
potentially work faster. The next sections discuss using both the Trim functions and 
the Segment Mode functions with the Smart Tool.

Link Selection and Smart Tool functions
Link Selection allows you to select one segment or transition and have those that are related 
become selected at the same time. By default, you can enable/disable Link Selection from 
the keyboard with Shift + L. Link Selection allows you to select multiple transitions and 
segments when:
f
f
The segments come from the same clip.
f
f
The related segments overlap by at least one frame.
f
f
The Link Selection Toggle is enabled.
f
f
Press the option/Alt key – if you'd prefer to work with Link Selection disabled, you 
may still get the Linking behavior whenever you want by using option/Alt + Clicking. 
The opposite is also true: if you've enabled Link Selection, and you want to select a 
segment or transition without also selecting all that are associated with it, then you 
can use option/Alt + Clicking.
Navigating the Timeline when using Smart Tool
When any of the functions within the Smart Tool are active, you can no longer click inside 
the Timeline in order to move the Position Indicator (the blue line) since the cursor is 
transformed into an active tool. Instead, Media Composer provides you with several places 
that you can click and/or drag to update your location:
f
f
Timecode track at the bottom of the Timeline (see the screenshot at the beginning  
of this section)
f
f
The Ruler (which also displays Timecode) that runs along the top of the Timeline 
Window, directly below all the buttons on the Timeline Toolbar (see the screenshot  
at the beginning of this section)
f
f
The position bar that is directly below the Record Monitor
Disabling the Smart Tool
There are several ways that you can disable (exit) the Smart Tool, which will then disable all 
the functions within it.
f
f
Clicking the left edge of the Smart Tool palette (labeled in the previous screenshot  
as Smart Tool Toggle).

f
f
You can instruct Media Composer to disable the Smart Tool whenever you click onto 
either the Timecode Track at the bottom of the Timeline or on the Ruler at the top of 
the Timeline Window (see the screenshot at the beginning of this section), which is a 
behavior that many long-time Media Composer editors have become accustomed to. 
To do this: Project Window | Settings tab | Timeline Settings | Edit tab, and select 
the option that states Clicking the TC Track or Ruler Disables Smart Tools.
Using the Trim functions in the Smart Tool
You can enable as many of the functions in the Smart Tool that you like. When you enable 
multiple functions, then you can then access them directly in the Timeline, simply based on 
where you place your cursor. This saves you time from having to turn functions on or off. Let's 
start by focusing on using just the trimming functions.
1.	 Within the Smart Tool, enable both the red Overwrite Trim function as well as the 
yellow Ripple Trim function. Note that enabling a function(s) within the Smart Tool 
also enables the Smart Tool itself. Use any of the methods described in the Smart tool 
overview recipe to disable and/or re-enable the Smart Tool as a whole at any time.
2.	 When multiple Smart Tool functions are enabled, you access them right in the 
Timeline based on where you place your cursor. Remember, in this example, we're 
discussing only the red Overwrite Trim function and the yellow Ripple Trim function, 
though you can have any combination of functions enabled that you like.


Placing the cursor near a transition, on either the A-Side or B-Side, towards 
the top half of the segment indicates red Overwrite Trim (discussed earlier 
in this appendix in the Trimming icons and colors section).


Placing the cursor near a transition, on either the A-Side or B-Side, towards 
the bottom-half of the segment indicates yellow Ripple Trim.


Placing the cursor exactly over the transition will display a white icon of one 
Trim Roller with the film extending out from it in both directions. This icon 
indicates Double-Roller Trim.


Once you have displayed the tool you want (Overwrite Trim, Ripple Trim,  
or Double-Roller Trim), then click the mouse to engage it.
Notice that the Smart Tool palette reminds you where to position your cursor in the Timeline 
by placing the red tools above the yellow tools.

Using Segment Mode with the Smart Tool
While it is possible to have as many of the Smart Tool functions enabled as you like at any 
time, here we'll focus on just enabling the Segment Mode functions. And, just as with the 
Smart Tool trimming functions (discussed earlier), once the Segment Mode functions are 
enabled, they can be accessed in the Timeline, based on where you place your cursor. Let's 
take a closer look:
f
f
Within the Smart Tool, enable both the red Lift/Overwrite Segment Mode as well as 
the yellow Extract/Splice In Segment Mode. Note that enabling a function(s) within 
the Smart Tool also enables the Smart Tool itself. Use any of the methods described 
in the the Smart tool overview section to disable and/or re-enable the Smart Tool as 
a whole at any time.
f
f
When multiple Smart Tool functions are enabled, you access them directly in  
the Timeline based on where you place your cursor. Remember, in this example, 
we're discussing only the red Lift/Overwrite Segment Mode and the yellow  
Extract/Splice - In Segment Mode, though you can have any combination of 
functions enabled that you like.


Placing your cursor in the upper portion of a segment displays the Red Arrow, 
while placing it in the lower portion displays the Yellow Arrow (notice that the 
Smart Tool palette reminds you where to position your cursor in the Timeline 
by placing the red tools above the yellow tools)


Once you have displayed the tool you want (red arrow or yellow arrow), then 
click the mouse to engage it


There are additional Segment Mode tips next.
Nine Segment Mode Tips
The following are a variety of tips that will help you get more out of using Segment Mode.
Sync Locks
By default, Extract/Splice In Segment Mode does not pay attention to the Sync Locks. 
However, you can force it to. Go to Project Window | Settings Tab | Timeline Settings | 
Edit Tab | Segment Drag Sync Locks. There is a discussion of this in the Segment Mode: 
Methods for staying in sync recipe in Chapter 5, Maintaining and Regaining Sync.

Appendix B
383
Snapping
There are two methods available to make segments snap in a specific manner. The default 
method uses keyboard shortcuts which are discussed in the Snapping Actions for the Position 
Indicator and in Segment Mode recipe in Chapter 3, Polishing Gems. The second method 
involves this setting: Project Window | Settings Tab | Timeline Settings | Edit Tab | Default 
Snap-To Edit.
When the Default Snap-To Edit setting is enabled:
f
f
The Head (left side) of the segment(s) you're moving will automatically snap to 
transitions, Mark In or Mark Out, and the Position Indicator (blue line)
f
f
Press the option/Alt key to make the Tail (right side) of the segment(s) you're  
moving snap
f
f
Note that the Position Indicator will also snap, so you'll need to navigate using  
JKL, the Step Forward/Backward keys, or within the position bar below the  
Record Monitor
Selecting Methods
Media Composer provides several ways for you to select Segments:
f
f
Shift + Click – if you're already in Segment Mode, you can add (or remove)  
segments from your selection by pressing and holding the Shift key and then  
clicking on a segment.
f
f
Select Left, Select Right, Select Between In/Out Marks – by default, you'll find 
these functions on your Timeline Toolbar. They can also be mapped anywhere  
you'd like. They can be found in the Tools menu | Command Palette | Edit tab,  
and you'll find them in the fourth column. To use one of these three functions,  
you must do the following:


Step 1: Enable the track(s) on which you want to select segments.


Step 2: You will use one of these, depending on your situation. To use Select 
Left or Select Right, for this step you will park your Position Indicator on 
the first segment you want to select. To use Select In/Out, then you'll place 
Marks that include the segments you want to select. The marks do not have 
to totally surround the segments you want to select. In other words, the 
marks only need to be partially within the segments you want to select.


Step 3: Once you have prepared as discussed in step 2, then press the 
required function (Select Left, Select Right, or Select In/Out).

f
Lassoing – you can select segments and place them into Segment Mode by Lassoing 
around them in a very specific way. Lasso entirely around them, moving your cursor 
from left to right. Lassoing is discussed and pictured in more detail as it relates to 
Trimming earlier in this chapter. See the Enabling and configuring the trimming tools 
recipe (and don't miss the portion that discusses lassoing inside the Timeline with 
the option/Alt key).
Moving Segments
It is important to note that in versions of Media Composer, up to and including version 6.0, 
if you are trying to move multiple segments, then all the segments have to be touching each 
other; and this includes any Filler that may be between two Segments. In other words, all the 
Segments must be adjacent to one another. If you attempt to move multiple Segments that 
do not all touch each other, then they will not move, and you may get a system alert sound 
(for example, Beep). Note, however, that for those using Version 6.5 or later, you can move 
Segments that are not touching each other when you use the red Lift/Overwrite Segment 
Mode arrow. For emphasis, this is new programming that only applies to Version 6.5 and later.
Exiting Segment Mode
Just as there are multiple ways to enable Segment Mode, there are several ways to disable  
it. You'll find that you'll use some methods more than others, but it's helpful to be familiar  
with all of them:
f
f
Click on either the red and/or yellow segment arrow to toggle it off.
f
f
You can map the Segment Mode Arrows from the Command Palette to any location 
on the keyboard or interface that you like.
f
f
Click the left edge of the Smart Tool palette.
f
f
By default, you can enable/disable the Smart Tool by using Shift + Tab.
f
f
You can map the Smart Tool Toggle button from the Command Palette: Tools menu 
| Command Palette | Smart Tools tab.
f
f
You can instruct Media Composer to disable the Smart Tool whenever you click onto 
either the Timecode Track at the bottom of the Timeline or on the Ruler at the top of 
the Timeline Window. To do this, Project Window | Settings tab | Timeline Settings 
| Edit tab and select the option that reads: Clicking the TC Track or Ruler Disables 
Smart Tools.

Segment Mode Track Placement
If you have selected both video and audio segments, and if you have multiple tracks in your 
timeline, it is possible to move segments not only horizontally but vertically as well. Whichever 
element, video or audio, that you want to move vertically should be the last thing selected 
before moving them. The entire selection will move horizontally and the last element selected 
will also move vertically.
For example, you have three video tracks and six audio tracks in your Sequence. You'd like to 
move a shot that has video and two tracks of audio to a later position in the Sequence, and 
at the same time move the shot's audio from tracks A1 and A2 to tracks A3 and A4. Here are 
the steps:
1.	 Select the video segment and its related audio segments in order to place them into 
Segment Mode using any method described earlier in the Selecting Methods recipe.
2.	 Select and hold down the mouse button on either of the audio segments (the video 
segment also remains selected).
3.	 As you move the segments horizontally, simultaneously move the audio segments 
vertically to tracks A3 and A4.
Link Selection
Link Selection allows you to select one segment or transition and have other segments 
that are related become selected simultaneously. By default, you can enable/disable Link 
Selection from the keyboard with Shift + L.
Link Selection allows you to select multiple segments (and transitions) when:
f
f
The segments come from the same clip.
f
f
The related segments overlap by at least one frame.
f
f
The Link Selection Toggle is enabled.
f
f
You press the option/Alt key – if you'd prefer to work with Link Selection disabled, 
you may still get that behavior whenever you want by using option/Alt + Clicking. 
The opposite is also true: if you've enabled Link Selection, and you want to select a 
segment without selecting the others that are associated with it, then you can use 
option/Alt + Clicking.

Setting a Preference
When you lasso to select segments, or when you use the Select Left/Right/Between Marks 
buttons, by default you will be placed into the Extract/Splice In Segment Mode (yellow 
arrow). However, you can change that, if you prefer, by going to Project Window | Settings tab 
| Timeline Settings | Edit tab | Default Segment Tool | Segment Overwrite.
One at A Time
Prior to the introduction of the Smart Tool, it was only possible to have one Segment Mode 
arrow enabled at a time. If you prefer this behavior, you can tell Media Composer to do this by 
going to Project Window | Settings tab | Timeline Settings | Edit tab | Only One Segment 
Tool Can Be Enabled At A Time.

Group Clips and MultiCamera Mode editing are especially useful in any situation where 
footage from multiple cameras is recorded at the same time and/or shares a common sync 
reference. For example:
f
f
Music Videos: Even though you may have shot your music video with just one 
camera, all the different angles and locations in the footage still have at least one 
common sync reference: the song. Professional music video shoots will also use a 
timecode reference tied along with the music track to aid with syncing footage.
f
f
Small Shoots: This relates to shoots with two or three cameras, such as an interview, 
a lecture, or a presentation. It’s always preferred to have all the cameras share the 
exact same timecode (referred to as Common Timecode) and that the cameras be 
exactly synced together (frequently referred to as Jam Synced). Unfortunately, this 
may not always be possible (due to the capability, or in this case the incapability, of 
the cameras being used). However, you can still provide a common sync reference 
point for all the cameras by using a Clapper Slate (see screenshot and discussion 
later in the Overview: Syncing Methods recipe).
f
f
Large Shoots: This relates to shoots of various kinds with multiple cameras, covering 
a large expanse, and/or not necessarily recording the same image and audio at 
the same time, yet all the footage needs to be synced (Grouped) together. In these 
instances, using a Clapper Slate is most likely not practical and you would want to 
make sure that all the cameras (or decks, if you’re feeding the signal to a control 
truck or control room) are jam-synced together so that they share identical timecode. 
Some examples would be:


A music concert where one camera records the singer, another camera the 
drummer, another camera the entire band, another camera the audience, 
and so on


An American Football game where one camera records the Quarterback, 
another camera a coach, another camera the fans in the stadium, and so on


A studio production like a situation comedy (for example, The Big Bang 
Theory), a talk show (for example, The Ellen DeGeneres Show or The Graham 
Norton Show), or a court show (for example, Judge Judy)
Definition of a Group Clip
First, I think it’s good to know that you can edit with a Group Clip without using MultiCamera 
Mode. MultiCamera Mode editing gives you some additional editing abilities, but is not 
required to edit a Group Clip.

A Group Clip is a single clip that you create from multiple Master Clips and/or Subclips. 
During the process of creating Group Clips (referred to as Grouping), you instruct Avid Media 
Composer how to sync the clips. Examples of syncing methods include a common Mark In 
point on all the clips, or matching timecode on all the clips.
A Group Clip is able to Link to (you could also say point to, or refer to) up to 99 Master Clips 
and/or Subclips at one time. For example, let’s say you’re editing a sit-down interview with 
one Interviewer and two people being interviewed (the Subjects) which was shot with four 
cameras, and the recording was continuous on all the cameras for the entire duration of a 
45-minute interview. Each of the four cameras would produce one Master Clip (each about 
45-minutes long) which you would then combine into a single Group Clip. In the end, that  
one single Group Clip would link to/refer to all four Master Clips (camera angles) at the  
same time:
f
f
Camera A: Interviewer
f
f
Camera B: Interview Subject 1
f
f
Camera C: Interview Subject 2
f
f
Camera D: Roams between a Two-Shot of the Interview Subjects and a Wide-Shot  
that includes both the Interviewer and the Subjects
The benefits of editing with Group Clips include:
f
f
Having all the different camera angles contained in one clip means that it will only 
have to occupy one video track in your Timeline (the alternative is discussed later  
in the Editing multiple camera angles without Group Clips recipe)
f
f
You can quickly and easily change video angles from one to another, and/or from  
one audio source to another (the various methods are discussed in the chapter  
about Group Clips and MultiCamera Mode)
The duration of the Group Clip is dictated by the longest clip in the Group. That means that 
while editing, if you change to (also known as Switch to) one of the camera angles (that is, 
Master Clips) at a point in time when that clip does not have any video (for example, at the 
beginning or end of a Group Clip), Media Composer will display black.
The icon for a Group Clip is a square that is divided into four parts. This symbol is inspired  
by the four-image display, known as the Quad Display which is frequently used when editing 
with Group Clips. This icon is pictured in the next screenshot:

Definition of a MultiGroupClip
A MultiGroup Clip is one clip that contains two or more Group Clips. You could say it’s a 
Group of Group Clips. As a matter of fact, if you look at a MultiGroup Clip while it’s loaded 
in the Source Monitor (using the Toggle Source/Record In Timeline function), then you’ll 
actually be able to see the individual Group Clips that are within it.
While you might think that you would first create the separate Group Clips and then, in a 
second operation, instruct them to be MultiGrouped together, that is actually not the case. 
Instead, like Group Clips, MultiGroup Clips are created from Master Clips and/or Subclips. 
Further, they can only be correctly created from Master Clips and/or Subclips that have 
sequential timecode. Avid states, “The MultiGroup function is designed primarily for situation 
comedies and similar productions that record multiple takes sequentially on the same source 
tapes. MultiGrouping does not provide any benefit when you edit with clips that do not share 
common timecode or were not recorded sequentially, and might even cause the wrong clips to 
be grouped together.”
The icon for a MultiGroup Clip looks like the icon for a regular Group Clip, however, you will 
also see a small Plus Symbol on the left of it. Honestly, the plus symbol is so small that it 
looks like a dot when it’s viewed at normal size. See the next screenshot:
Definition of MultiCamera Mode
As mentioned earlier, it’s good to know that you can edit with a Group Clip without using 
MultiCamera Mode. In other words, it is not required to use MultiCamera Mode to edit  
a Group Clip. However, MultiCamera Mode editing gives you some additional abilities  
which include:
f
f
Two methods that allow you to switch to (cut to) a specific camera angle by using  
the keyboard.
f
f
Being able to Switch camera angles while you are playing your Sequence. In other 
words, you are able to switch from one camera angle to another in Real Time, in a 
way that is very similar to switching cameras during a live production.

Appendix C
391
Overview: Syncing Methods
When you create Group Clips, you have to tell Media Composer how the multiple clips 
should be synced together. The chapter on editing with Group Clips and MultiCamera Mode 
will discuss the specifics of syncing and Grouping clips that all share the same timecode 
(frequently referred to as Common or Jam-Synced timecode), as well as syncing and  
Grouping clips that may not share the same timecode, but do have a common reference  
point (for example, a Clapper Slate or the same audio).
Since syncing multiple clips that all share the exact same timecode is relatively easy, I thought 
an overview of two other methods of syncing clips so that they can then be used to create 
Group Clips would be helpful.
Clapper Slate
Screenshot of Clapper Slate:
Using a Clapper Slate during production works like this. You would begin recording with  
all the cameras, making sure that they can all see the Clapper Slate. You would then Clap  
(also known as, Mark) with the Slate. The slate being clapped (that is, the two parts of the 
slate being banged together) provides both a visual and an audible common sync reference 
point when recorded by all the cameras at the same time. This is then used during editing  
to sync up the footage from the various cameras. If you’re really in a bind, and don’t have  
a Clapper Slate, you could position your hands parallel to the ground, one above the other, 
and clap your hands to provide a common sync reference point.

Once the cameras are recording, if at all possible, it is advisable not to stop them 
independently of each other. In other words, the most desirable thing is to have the cameras 
start and stop recording at roughly the same time. This will make the syncing process a great 
deal easier and faster. If this is not possible, it’s not the end of the world. It just means that 
there will be some additional work required. This additional work is introduced later in the 
Audio Waveform Display recipe.
Audio Waveform Display
Multiple cameras can also be synced by aligning their audio waveforms (presuming they all 
recorded the same audio, of course). The chapter on editing with Group Clips discusses how 
to do this manually by visually aligning the waveform displays. If you do a lot of MultiCamera 
editing with footage that does not have common (jam-synced) timecode, or even a common 
sync reference point (for example, a Clapper Slate), then you may want to investigate a 
Third-Party application called PluralEyes. It also syncs multiple cameras by analyzing the 
waveforms, but it potentially does it much faster than the manual method covered in the 
chapter. While I have not personally used this software, I have heard positive things about it, 
and it could be a big time-saver if you’re in this situation frequently.
Editing multiple camera angles without 
Group Clips 
Just for purposes of comparison, let’s examine how we would have to edit without the benefit 
of Group Clips. Let’s use our previous example of a sit-down interview with one Interviewer 
and two people being interviewed:
f
f
Camera A: Interviewer
f
f
Camera B: Interview Subject 1
f
f
Camera C: Interview Subject 2
f
f
Camera D: Roams between a two-Shot of the Interview Subjects and a Wide-Shot that 
includes both the Interviewer and the Subjects
Without the ability to create Group Clips, you would have at least four video tracks; and you’d 
have at least two audio tracks (presuming the interviewer was recorded on one audio channel, 
while both subjects were recorded together on a different channel). Likely you’d have at least 
three audio tracks in this situation (each person recorded on a different audio channel), and 
possibly a fourth that was recorded with all the cameras’ audio channels mixed into one (as 
a safety/reference). In the Sequence, the video would be stacked onto different tracks and 
placed in sync with each other. You might configure the stacked clips like this (depending on 
your own preferences):

While editing like this is not impossible (there are a couple of different methods you might 
use, though I won’t bother you with detailing them), it is a great deal slower and more 
cumbersome than using Group Clips, whether you’re using MultiCamera Mode or not.
MultipleCamera Editing Resolutions
In the past (in the days before High Definition video) it was necessary to use specific, 
optimized video compressions (resolutions) in order to be able to play multiple Standard 
Definition (SD) video clips at the same time in the Quad Split and Nine Split displays (which 
are frequently used when editing Group Clips and when using MultiCamera Mode). These SD 
resolutions were denoted with the letter m following them, for example, 4:1m. Today, with the 
improvements in both hardware and software, using the m resolution is not mandatory with 
Group Clips/MultiCamera Mode. However, using it will provide increased performance. Avid 
states that you will see the best real-time playback performance when you play [SD] material 
that was recorded at 10:1 m, 4:1 m, or 1:1 resolutions. Further, you can certainly edit Group 
Clips comprised of HD video. However, since the amount of data for each frame of HD is so 
much more than SD, there are some issues and features to be aware of, which are discussed 
in the next section.
Understanding System Performance with 
Group Clips and MultiCamera Mode
Playing multiple video clips at the same time requires a lot of processing work from the 
computer. So, when editing with higher resolution video (for example, HD), you may see that the 
system drops frames (stutters) during playback. In addition to using a lower resolution of video 
to improve playback performance, you can also temporarily decrease the quality of the video 
playback by using the Video Quality Menu (located in the bottom left of the Timeline Window).
When you’re using MultiCamera Mode and you change the Video Quality Menu to a different 
setting, Media Composer will remember that setting each time you enable MultiCamera 
Mode during your current editing session. For example, let’s say you’re editing your Sequence 
not using MultiCamera Mode and the Video Quality Menu is set to Full Quality (green). 
Then you come to a portion of your Sequence that has some Group Clips, so you enter 
MultiCamera Mode while you edit that section. At this point, the Video Quality Menu is still 
set to Full Quality and you experience some dropped frames (stuttering) during playback. So, 
while still in MultiCamera Mode, you set the video Quality Menu to Draft Quality (yellow/
green) to get smooth playback. Later, when you leave MultiCamera Mode, the Video Quality 
will automatically shift to Full Quality again; and then later, when you re-enter MultiCamera 
Mode it will automatically shift to Draft Quality for you.

Lastly, when you have finished editing a MultiCamera Sequence and you are happy with all 
the edits you made, meaning that you are at the point in your project that you feel 100 % 
comfortable locking-in (in other words, committing to) the camera-angle-choices you’ve made, 
then you can use a feature called Commit MultiCam Edits. This changes all the Group Clips 
in your Sequence into regular clips. Doing this accomplishes the following:
f
f
Lessens the processing burden on the computer. Avid states,”You can remove the 
grouped clips in a sequence and replace each of them with its selected clip. This 
might be useful if you experience poor performance with a very complex MultiCamera 
sequence on a slower system, for example, a sequence that uses many MultiCamera 
clips and many effects or color corrections.” The result is that each Segment will 
reference only the original Master Clip, rather than the Group Clip. While you will no 
longer be able to switch to the other angles/cameras, you will be able to continue to 
edit with these clips (for example, Trim them longer or shorter).
f
f
Ensures that only the video and/or audio media that is actually used in the Sequence 
is placed into an AAF file export that also includes embedded media. If you do not 
Commit MultiCam Edits, then all of the media from every clip in the Group Clips 
is included in the AAF file, and the file becomes needlessly very large. If you’re 
unfamiliar with exporting AAF files, they are frequently used as a way to transfer 
audio files and Sequence data over to the audio mixing application called ProTools.
How to do it…
This recipe of steps will take you through the process of using the Commit MultiCam  
Edits command.
1.	 In the bin, right-click on the Sequence.
2.	 A menu will appear. Select Commit MultiCam Edits (it’s in the middle of the  
menu list).
3.	 Media Composer will then display a dialog window telling you that you will lose all 
the references to the alternate angles, and that it will also create a duplicate of the 
Sequence, so that you’ll have the original as a backup. Click the OK button.
4.	 The new Sequence, with the Group Clips removed, is created and appears at the  
top of the bin. Media Composer adds .NoGroups to the end of its name.
5.	 If all went well, then Media Composer will display a dialog window informing you  
that All MultiCam Groups were modified in the selected Sequence.
6.	 Click the OK button to close the dialog window.
