Preface 
This book is intended as an introductory text for Engineering and Applied Science Students to 
the Medical Applications of Electronics. A course has been offered for many years in Cardiff 
in this arena both in this College and its predecessor institution. A new group, the Medical 
Systems Engineering Research Unit, was established following the reorganisation of the 
College. Restructuring and review of our course material and placing the responsibility for 
teaching this course within the new group led to a search for new material. Whilst we found a 
number of available texts which were suitable for aspects of our new course, we found a need 
for a text which would encompass a wide scope of material which would be of benefit to 
students completing their degree programmes and contemplating professional involvement in 
Medical Electronics. 
Medical Electronics is a broad field. Whilst much of the material which an entrant to medical 
applications must acquire is the conventional basis of electronics covered by any student of 
'electronics, there are areas of special emphasis. Many of these arise from areas which are 
increasingly inaccessible to students who necessarily specialise at an early stage in their 
education. 
The nee~ for diversity is reflected in the educational background and experience of the 
authors. Amongst us is a Medical Practitioner who is also a Mechanical Engineer, a Physicist 
who now works as a Software Engineer, an Electronics Engineer who made the same move, 
and another Electronics Engineer with some experimental experience in Orthopaedics. 
The material which this book attempts to cover starts with an Introduction which hopefully 
provides some perspective in the subject area. The following chapter provides an introduction 
to human anatomy and physiology. The approach taken here is necessarily simplified: it is our 
intention to provide an adequate grounding for the material in the following chapters both in 
its basic science and the nomenclature which may be unfamiliar to readers with only 
elementary biological knowledge. 
Chapter Three describes the Physics employed in diagnostic techniques. This encompasses 
basic radiation physics, magnetic resonance and the nature and generation of ultrasound. 
Chapter 4 discusses the form of some of the basic electronic elements used in Medical 
Applications. We describe the specialised techniques which are employed and characterise 
the signals which are likely to be encountered. Special emphasis is attached to issues of 
patient safety, although these are covered in greater depth in Chapter 8. 
The mathematical background for image processing is covered in Chapter 5. This material has 
been separated from our description of representative diagnostic imaging technologies pre- 
sented in Chapter 6. This latter Chapter includes material supplied by Toshiba Medical 
Systems, whose assistance we gratefully acknowledge.

Chapter 7 contains background material concerning computers, their architecture, application 
to data acquisition and connection to networks. It also covers some aspects of the application 
of Databases and Expert Systems to Medicine which have long been expected to play central 
roles in patient care. The increasing capacity of systems together with their continuing cost 
reductions mean that their introduction is now becoming a reality. The introductory parts of 
this Chapter will be familiar to many engineers: we have included it to ensure that this book 
shall have a wide enough sphere of interest. 
Finally, Chapter 8 examines aspects of patient safety which are of concern to engineers. This 
area is a particularly difficult one in which to be specific as it is intimately entwined with 
changing legislation. We seek to present here principles and what we believe to be good 
practice: these must form the basis of any competent engineer's activity. 
This book has been some time in gestation. We wish to acknowledge the patience of our 
families, without whom no doubt the task would have been completed more quickly. We have 
been assisted too in no small measure by students and researchers in the Medical Systems 
Engineering Research Unit who have provided both constructive criticisms and help by 
checking manuscripts.

Introduction 
This book is concerned with describing the application of technological methods to medical 
diagnosis and therapy. It is instructive to review its development through recorded history. It 
is apparent that the fastest advances in the application of technology to medicine have 
occurred in the 20th Century and with an increasing pace. The following paragraphs touch on 
some events in this chain. We should recall that systematic technological assistance has only 
recently been widely applied to medicine through engineering. An understanding of the 
pathology which technology often helps to identify has largely been developed hand in hand 
with its application. In these paragraphs, we identify a number of the technologically based 
systems which are described more fully in the succeeding chapters: their descriptions here are 
necessarily rather terse. 
Medicine arose as a Scientific discipline in ancient times. Bernal (1957) notes that by the time 
of the establishment of the Greek civilisation, physicians were a notable professional group 
whose activities were essential to the affluent, partly as a result of their unhealthy lifestyle. 
They had by the 3rd Century BC distinguished between sensory and motor nervous functions. 
In the same era the Hippocratic Oath, or the code of conduct for physicians was written: it 
remains today as an ethical basis for much of medical practice. 
Spectacles are first described in mid 14th Century Italy. Whilst optical glass had been used for 
a long period, the quality of glass used by the ancients was too flawed to be of use for eyesight 
correction. The continuing development of spectacle lenses led by about 1600 to the develop- 
ment of the first telescopes. By the Renaissance period in the early 15th Century, medicine 
was becoming more formalised. Anatomical knowledge progressively improved, and al- 
though the topics of pathology and physiology were recognised, they had advanced little from 
the time of Galen in Second Century Greece. Modern scientific medicine based on biological 
science has largely developed since the mid 19th Century work by Pasteur and others. Bernal 
(1957) notes that they provided the theories which led to an understanding of epidemiology 
and to rational descriptions of nervous function. 
The practical development of a thermometer suitable for measurement of body temperature 
dates back to 1625. Whilst internal sounds from the body have been observed by physicians 
since the time of the Romans, the stethoscope dates back to the 19th Century, in a form 
reasonably similar to the present. 
Whilst crafted artificial replacements for severed limbs have been in use for many centuries, 
the development of both implanted prosthesis and functional artificial limbs is recent.

Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
The measurement of the electrical signals carried by our nervous system (known as 
Biopotentials) dates from the early years of the 20th Century with the first measurements of 
the Electrocardiograph. By the 1940s paper chart recordings of the detected waveforms could 
be made. The same era saw the development of the use of Electrosurgery, which employs 
resistive heating either to make delicate incisions or to cauterise a wound. By the 1960s, 
electrical stimulation of the heart was employed, firstly in the defibrillator either to restart or 
resynchronise a failing heart, and secondly in miniaturised pacemakers which could be used 
in the long term to bypass physical damage to parts of the heart. Electricity has also been 
applied, perhaps more controversially, since the 1940s in Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) 
to attempt to mitigate the effects of a number of psychiatric conditions. 
Apart from sensing signals generated by the body, clinical medicine has been greatly ad- 
vanced by the use of imaging techniques. These afford the possibility of viewing structures of 
the body which are otherwise inaccessible. They may either operate on a scale which is 
characterised by the transfer of chemicals or on a structural level, perhaps to examine the 
fracture of a bone. 
X rays have been applied to diagnosis since soon after their discovery by Rtntgen in 1895. 
The source of diagnostic radiation was the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) which produced 
penetrating photons which could be viewed on a photographic emulsion. The early days of the 
20th Century saw the first use of ionising radiation in Radiotherapy for the treatment of 
cancerous conditions. A failure to appreciate the full extent of its dangers led to the premature 
deaths of many of its early proponents. Early medical images were recorded using the 
ancestors of the familiar X ray films. However, since the 1970s, acquisition of radiographic 
data using electronic means has become progressively more commonplace. The newer 
technique affords the possibility of processing the image to 'improve' aspects of it, or enable 
its registration with other images taken at another time to.view the. progress of a condition. 
A major technique for the visualisation of anatomical structures and the metabolism has been 
the use of radionuclides introduced into the body. The technology, known as Nuclear Medi- 
cine, has been used since about 1948 when radioactive iodine was first used to help examine 
the thyroid. Theresolution available from nuclear medicine has progressively increased with 
increasing miniaturisation of the photomultiplier tubes used in its detectors and improve- 
merits to collimators. 
Computerised Tomography has developed from its initial application as a medical diagnostic 
technique in 1972. It had an earlier history when many aspects of the technique were 
demonstrated although without medical application. The use of computerised tomography 
has been one of the signal events in the development of medical imaging, enabling views of 
internal structures of a quality hitherto impossible. The technique has been refined somewhat 
from its inception in terms of degree: the time to obtain an image has significantly been 
accelerated and thereby provided commensurate reductions in patient radiation dose. Process- 
ing of the images obtained has also moved forward dramatically enabling three dimensional 
images to be obtained and presented with an illusion of perspective. 
Much of the work in image processing in general owes its origins to fields outside of 
medicine. The mathematics developed for image analysis of astronomical data has been 
applied to contribute to a number of aspects of medical image processing. In order to be of 
reasonably general use~ images should ideally provide representations of the systems which 
they examine in terms which are accessible to a non-specialist. The early projection X ray

images are characterised by information accumulated from the summation of absorption of 
radiation along the paths of all rays. The resulting image dor not represent the morphology of 
a single plane or structure but instead is a complex picture of all the contributing layers. This 
requires a high degree of skill to interpret. Image processing may help in ways such as 
clarifying the data of interest, removing movement artefacts and providing machine recogni- 
tion of certain structures. These functions enable the extension of the application of medical 
imaging to the quantification of problems such as the stroke volume of the heart so that its 
operation may be properly assessed whilst minimising the use of invasive techniques. 
Another technique which has been applied to medicine in the recent past and with increasing 
success is ultrasonic diagnosis. This arose from two fields. The first was the application of 
sonar in the Second World War to submarine location. Also developed during the War was 
Radar: this relies on very a similar mathematical basis to obtain images by what is essentially 
the reflection of a portion of the energy from a source back to a detector. The development of 
signal processing for radar has been one of the major e~ly inputs into the development of 
medical ultrasonic diagnosis systems. A significant difference in difficulty of analysis of their 
respective signals is due to the much greater non-uniformity of the medium through which 
ultrasound is passed. Ultrasound diagnostic systems are now in widespread use, particularly 
in applications such as gynaecology in which the hazards due to ionising radiation present an 
unacceptable risk for their routine use. Gynaecologieal screening by ultrasound is undertaken 
now routinely in many countries: although doubts about its absolute safety have been 
expressed, no causative links to ailments have yet been established. 
Ultrasound also provides a suitable mechanism for use with Doppler techniques, again 
borrowed substantially from radar, to measure the velocities of blood or structures. Doppler 
ultrasonic examinations provide a safe non-invasive means for the measurement of cardiovas- 
cular function which previously required the use of much more hazardous techniques includ- 
ing catheterisation. 
Since the early 1980s there has been a rapid introduction of the medical application of 
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The physical phenomenon was first described in 1946, 
and was able to determine the concentrations of certain chemicals in samples. In the applica- 
tion in medicine it is able to provide three dimensional discrimination of the positions of 
concentrations of the nuclei of atoms which have characteristic spins: in particular the 
location of hydrogen nuclei may be recognised. The information obtained by NMR is called 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or MRI, in its medical application. The images provide an 
excellent resolution and discrimination between many corporeal structures. They are obtained 
without known deleterious effects in most cases, although the equipment required to obtain 
MRI images costs significantly more than that required for other image acquisition mecha- 
nisms, known as modalities. 
The development of electronics, and particularly that of computers has made possible many 
of the technologies which we shall examine. 
Firstly, computers are the central elements involved in processing signals in many cases, and 
particularly those obtained from images. The special nature of the processing required to 
obtain the image improvements required and the consequential flexibility in their application 
mean that the complexity of the algorithms for processing would be excessive unless software 
was used for managing the process. Medical image processing frequently requires that 
different views may need to be synthesised in the examination of a condition relating to each

particular patient. The exact form of the views may be difficult to predict, so computers 
provide the ideal platform for their analysis. 
Secondly the increasing use of computers in medical applications has led to an ever increasing 
capability to retain medical data. This may be used to facilitate health care planning and to 
provide for a reliable storage of patient related data which may be readily recovered. They 
also provide the ability to communicate data using standardised mechanisms which we may 
expect will increasingly allow data to be acquired in one location and viewed at another. 
Finally computers have potential for providing us with systems which mimic the diagnostic 
processes employed by physicians. Pilot systems which can provide some diagnostic assist- 
ance have been tried for a number of years in certain areas both within and outside medicine. 
They are particularly prevalent in manufacturing industry where they may be employed to 
assist in the design process and to control the flow of goods through factories. Clearly such 
systems are limited in their scope by the complexity of their programming. We should also not 
forget that humans undertake certain tasks particularly well, such as pattern recognition of 
faces as a result of possibly innate training. 
We should end this overview of the application of technology to medicine by considering two 
things. 
1. When we contemplate applying a technological solution to a problem, will it benefit the 
patient? The benefit may either be direct in terms of an immediate improvement in the 
patient's condition, or one which facilitates action as a result of time saving. A computer 
may, in some circumstances, undertake a task either much more quickly, or more reliably 
than a human. On the other hand, there are many cases when the computer's instructions 
have not been formulated in a manner which enable it to handle the task at all. 
2. Will the application provide a global benefit, or is it likely to result in some other 
detrimental effect? In cases where technology is used without considering all its effects, it 
frequently transpires that the task could have been undertaken more simply. Much more 
seriously, the problem may be reflected by placing excessive reliance on a technological 
solution in an inappropriate manner. We must be particularly confident when we hand a 
safety critical task to a machine that we retain a sufficient view and knowledge of the 
problem in order to take appropriate action should unforeseen circumstances arise. In other 
words we should not always be excessively comforted by the reliability of the apparatus to 
lull us into a false sense of security.

Anatomy and Physiology 
2.1. Introduction 
Before proceeding to the various anatomical levels that can be found in the human body, it 
would be useful to have some simple definitions. The definition of anatomy is the study of 
structures that make up the human body and how they relate to each other, for example, how 
does the skeletal structure relate to the muscular structure, or how does the cardiovascular 
structure relate to the respiratory structure? 
The definition for physiology is the study of the function of body structures, for example, how 
do the neural impulses transmit down a nerve and affect the structuring at the end of the nerve. 
In understanding these interactions, the application of electronics to monitor these systems 
will be more readily understood. 
To describe the location of particular parts of the body, anatomists have defined the anatomi- 
cal position. This is shown in Figure 2.1. 
Figure 2.1 Anatomical position 

6 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
2.2. Anatomical Terminology 
There is standardised terminology to describe positions of various parts of the body from the 
midline. These are shown in Figure 2.2. When the body is in the 'anatomical position', it can 
be further described with relation to body regions. The main regions of the body are the axial, 
consisting of the head and neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis; the appendicular, which includes 
the upper extremities- shoulders, upper arms, forearms, wrists and hands; and the lower 
Figure 2.2 Standard body positions 

Anatomy and Physiology 7 
extremities - hips, thighs, lower legs, ankles and feet. These are shown in Figure 2.3. Further 
subdivision in order to identify specific areas of the body can be carried out by considering 
various planes. These are shown in Figure 2.4. The midsagital plane divides the left and fight 
sides of the body lengthwise along the midline. If the symmetrical plane is placed off centre 
and separates the body into asymmetrical left and fight sections it is called the sagital plane. If 
you face the side of the body and make a lengthwise cut at right angles to the midsagital plane 
you would make a frontal (coronal) plane, which divides the body into asymmetrical anterior 
and postorior sections. A transverse plane divides the body horizontally into upper (superior) 
and lower (inferior) sections. An understanding of these terminologies is important, as it is the 
common language for locating parts in the human body. Without these definitions, confusion 
would arise in describing the relationship between one body part and another. 
Figure 2.3a Regions of the body 

8 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
2.3. Structural Level of the Human Body 
The cell is assumed to be the basic living unit of structure of all organisms. Also, all living 
things are made up of one or more cells. Life is thought not to exist before the formation of a 
cellular structure. 
Figure 2.5 is an example of a human cell. Although a very complex structure, it can be broken 
down into a number of components that interact with each other in order to perform specific 
functions required for life. In the centre of the cell is the nucleus. This is considered to be the 
control area that interacts with various parts of the cell body in order to maintain the cell's 
existence. The nucleus is bathed in a fluid called the cytoplasm. This is the factory of the cell 
and it is where components are manufactured on the instruction of the nucleus via chemical 
messengers, again to maintain the cellular function and existence. 
Figure 2.3b Regions of the body 

Anatomy and Physiology 9 
The cell has to communicate with its environment. This is done via the plasma membrane, 
which lines the whole cell. Messengers in the form of molecules can be transmitted across this 
membrane, as it is permeable to specific molecules of various shapes and sizes. Movement of 
these messengers across the membrane is achieved by two mechanisms. 
1. Simple diffusion: molecules pass through the membrane from high to low concentrations. 
2. Active diffusion: basic fuel for the human body is adenosine tfiphosphate (ATP). This fuel 
acts on a pump that pushes molecules from a low concentration to a high concentration. 
Figure 2.4 Body planes 

10 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Figure 2.5 Schematic of human cell 
When many similar cells combine to perform a specific function, they are called tissues. 
Examples of human tissue are epithelial, connective, muscle and nervous. It is important to 
stress that the difference between tissues is that the cells combine to perform a specific 
function associated with each tissue. 
Epithelial tissues line all body surfaces, cavities and tubes. Their function is to act as an 
interface between various body compartments. They are involved with a wide range of 
activities, such as absorption, secretion and protection. For example, the epithelial lining of 
the small intestine is primarily involved in the absorption of products of digestion, but the 
epithelium also protects it from noxious intestinal contents by secreting a surface coating. 
Connective tissue is the term applied to the basic type of tissue which provides structural 
support for other tissue. Connective tissue can be thought of as a spider's web that holds 
together other body tissues. Within this connective tissue web, various cells that fight the 
bacteria which invade the body can be found. Similarly, fat is also stored in connective tissue. 
An organ is an amalgamation of two or more kinds of tissue that work together to perform a 
specific function. An example is found in the stomach; epithelial tissue lines its cavity and 
helps to protect it. Smooth muscle churns up food, breaks it down into smaller pieces and 
mixes it with digestive juices. Nervous tissue transmits nerve impulses that initiate the muscle 
contractions, whilst connective tissue holds all the tissues together. 
The next structural level of the body is called systems. The system is a group of organs that 
work together to perform a certain function. All body systems work together in order that the 
whole body is in harmony with itself. Listed in Table 2.1 are the body systems and their major 
functions. Systems that are often monitored in order to analyse the well-being of the body 
include those associated with respiratory, skeletal, nervous and cardiovascular.

12 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
2.4. Muscular System 
The function of muscle is to allow movement and to produce body heat. In order to achieve 
this, muscle tissue must be able to contract and stretch. Contraction occurs via a stimulus from 
the nervous system. There are three types of muscle tissue; smooth, cardiac and skeletal. 
Skeletal muscle by definition is muscle which is involved in the movement of the skeleton. It 
is also called striated muscle as the fibres, which are made up of many cells, are composed of 
alternating light and dark stripes, or striations. Skeletal muscle can be contracted without 
conscious control, for example in sudden involuntary movement. 
Most muscle is in a partially contracted state (tonus). This enables some parts of the body to 
be kept in a semi-rigid position, i.e. to keep the head erect and to aid the return of blood to the 
heart. Skeletal muscle is composed of cells that have specialised functions. They are called 
muscle fibres, due to their appearance as a long cylindrical shape plus numerous nuclei. Their 
lengths range from 0.1 cm to 30 cm with a diameter from 0.01 cm to 0.001 cm. Within these 
Figure 2.6 Gross to molecular structure of muscle 

Anatomy and Physiology 
13 
Figure 2. 7 Motor end plate 
muscle fibres are even smaller fibres called myofibrils. These myofibrils are made up of thick 
and thin threads called myofilaments. The thick myofilaments are called myocin and the thin 
myofilaments are called actin. Figure 2.6 shows a progression from the gross to the molecular 
structure of muscle. 
Control of muscle is achieved via the nervous system. Nerves are attached to muscle via a 
junction called the motor end plate. Shown in Figure 2.7 is a diagrammatic representation of 
a motor end plate. 
2.4.1. Mechanism of Contraction of Muscle 
Muscle has an all or none phenomenon. In order for it to contract it has to receive a stimulus 
of a certain threshold. Below this threshold muscle will not contract; above this threshold 
muscle will contract but the intensity of contraction will not be greater than that produced by 
the threshold stimulus. 
The mechanism of contraction can be explained with reference to Figure 2.8. A nerve impulse 
travels down the nerve to the motor end plate. Calcium diffuses into the end of the nerve. This 
releases a neuro transmitter called acetylcholine, a neural transmitter. Acetylcholine travels

Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
across the small gap between the end of the nerve and the muscle membrane. Once the 
acetylcholine reaches the membrane, the permeability of the muscle to sodium (Na § and 
potassium (K § ions increases. Both ions are positively charged. However, there is a differ- 
ence between permeabilities for the two ions. Na § enters the fibre at a faster rate than the K § 
ions leave the fibre. This results in a positive charge inside the fibre. This change in charge 
initiates the contraction of the muscle fibre. 
The mechanism of contraction involves the actin and myocin filaments which, in a relaxed 
muscle, are held together by small cross bridges. The introduction of calcium breaks these 
cross bridges and allows the actin to move using ATP as a fuel. Relaxation of muscle occurs 
via the opposite mechanism. The calcium breaks free from the actin and myocin and enables 
the cross bridges to reform. Recently there has been a new theory of muscle contraction. This 
suggests that the myocin filaments rotate and interact with the actin filaments, similar to a 
corkscrew action, with contacts via the cross bridges. The rotation causes the contraction of 
the muscle. 
2.4.2. Types of Muscle Contraction 
Muscle has several types of contraction. These include twitch, isotonic and isometric and 
tetanus. 
Twitch: This is a momentary contraction of muscle in response to a single stimulus. It is the 
simplest type of recordable muscle contraction. 
Isotonic~ometric: In this case a muscle contracts, becoming shorter. This results in the 
force or tension remaining constant as the muscle moves. For example, when you lift a 
weight, your muscles contract and move your arm, which pulls the weight. In contrast an 
isometric contraction occurs when muscle develops tension but the muscle fibres remain the 
same length. This is illustrated by pulling against an immovable object. 
Tetanus: This results when muscle receives a stimulus at a rapid rate. It does not have time to 
relax before each contraction. An example of this type of contraction is seen in lock-jaw, 
where the muscle cannot relax due to the rate of nervous stimulus it is receiving. 
Myograms: During contraction the electrical potential generated within the fibres can be 
recorded via external electrodes. The resulting electrical activity can be plotted on a chart. 
These myograms can be used to analyse various muscle contractions, both normal and 
abnormal. 
2.4.3. Smooth Muscle 
Smooth muscle tissue is so called because it does not have striations and therefore appears 
smooth under a microscope. It is also called involuntary because it is controlled by the 
autonomic nervous system. Unlike skeletal muscle, it is not attached to bone. It is found 
within various systems within the human body, for example the circulatory, the digestive and 
respiratory. Its main difference from skeletal muscle is that its contraction and relaxation are 
slower. Also, it has a rhythmic action which makes it ideal for the gastro-intestinal system. 
The rhythmic action pushes food along the stomach and intestines.

2.4.4. Cardiac Muscle 
Cardiac muscle, as the name implies, is found only in the heart. Under a microscope the fibres 
have a similar appearance to skeletal muscle. However, the fibres are attached to each other 
via a specialised junction called an 'intercalated disc'. The main difference between skeletal 
and cardiac muscle is that cardiac muscle has the ability to contract rhythmically on its own 
without the need for external stimulation. This of course is of high priority in order that the 
heart may pump for 24 hours/day. When cardiac muscle is stimulated via a motor end plate 
calcium ions influx into the muscle fibres. This results in contraction of the cardiac muscle. 
The intercalated discs help synchronise the contraction of the fibres. Without this synchroni- 
sation the heart fibres may contract independently, thus greatly reducing the effectiveness of 
the muscle in pumping the blood around the body. 
2.4.5. Muscle Mechanics 
Movement of the skeletal structure is achieved via muscle. Skeletal muscles are classified 
according to the types of movement that they can perform. For simplicity, there are basically 
two types of muscle action - flexion and extension. Examples of flexion and extension are 
seen in Figure 2.9. The overall muscular system of the human body can be seen in Figures 
2.10 and 2.11. 
Extension / 
Figure 2.9 Flexion and extension 
Most body movement, even to perform such simple functions as extension or flexion, 
involves complex interactions of several muscles or muscle groups. This may involve one 
muscle antagonising another in order to achieve a specific function. The production of 
movement of the skeletal system involves four mechanisms - agonist, antagonist, synogists 
and fixators. 
Agonist is a muscle that is primarily responsible for producing a movement. An antagonist 
opposes the movement of the prime mover. The specific contraction or relaxation of the 
antagonist working in co-operation with the agonist helps to produce smooth movements. 
The synogist groups of muscles complement the action of the prime mover. The fixator 
muscles provide a stable base for the action of a prime mover- for example muscles that 
steady the proximal end of an arm, while the actual movement takes place in the hand.

All four of these muscle groups work together with an overall objective of producing smooth 
movement of the skeletal structure. 
Muscle is usually attached to a bone by a tendon - this is a thick cord of connective tissue 
comprising collagen fibres. When muscle contracts, one bone remains stationary, whilst the 
bone at the other end of the muscle moves. The end of the muscle that is attached to the bone 
that remains stationary is commonly called 'the origin', whilst the other attachment to the 
moving bone is called 'the insertion'. 
2.5. Skeletal System 
The adult skeleton consists of 206 different bones. However, it is common to find an 
individual with an extra rib or an additional bone in the hands or feet. Shown in Figure 2.12 is 
the adult human skeleton. Bone is a composite material consisting of different substances 
interconnected in such a way as to produce a material with outstanding mechanical properties. 
It consists of a matrix of an organic material, collagen, and a crystalline salts, called 
hydroxyapetite. 
There are two types of bone- cortical (or compact) and cancellous (trabecullar). Cortical 
bone is a hard dense material visible on the bone's surface. Due to its appearance it is often 
called compact bone. Cancellous bone exists within the shell of the cortical bone (Figure 
2.13). Cancellous bone is often referred to as spongy bone, as it consists of widely spaced 
interconnecting fibre columns called trabecullar. The centre of a long bone is filled with 
marrow, and this area is called the medullary cavity. It has an important role in producing 
blood cells during childhood. The two ends of a human long bone are called the 'epiphysis', 
while the mid region is referred to as the 'diaphysis'.

Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Articulation of the skeletal systems occurs via joints. These joints are classified according to 
their movement. In hinge joints, as the name implies, movement occurs similar to that on 
hinges of the lid of a box. For pivot joints, the best example is the skull rotating on a peg, 
attached to the vertebra. Finally there are ball and socket joints, a typical example of which is 
found in the hip, in which the head of the femur articulates with the socket of the assetablum. 
Most major joints are encapsulated and lubricated by synovial fluid. A typical example is the 
hip joint shown in Figure 2.14. 
Figure 2.14 Hip joint 
2.6. The Nervous System 
2.6.1. Anatomy 
The human body reacts to a number of stimuli, both internally and externally. For example, if 
the hand touches a flame from a cooker, the response would be to pull the hand away as 
quickly as possible. The mechanism to achieve this response is controlled via the nervous 
system. Impulses travel from the tips of the fingers along nerves to the brain. The information 
is processed and the response organised. This results in the hand being pulled away from the 
flame using the muscular system. 
The nervous system is also responsible in regulating the internal organs of the body. This is in 
order that homeostasis can be achieved with minimal disturbance to body function. The 
signals that travel along the nervous system result from electrical impulses and neuro 
transmitters that communicate with another body tissue, for example muscle. 
For convenience, the nervous system is split into two sections, but it is important to stress that 
both these networks communicate with each other in order to achieve an overall steady state 
for the body. The two systems are termed Central and Peripheral. 
The central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord and can be thought of as 
a central processing component of the overall nervous system. 
The peripheral nervous system consists of nerve cells and their fibres that emerge from the 
brain and spinal cord and communicate with the rest of the body. There are two types of nerve 
cells within the peripheral system - the afferent, or sensory nerves, which carry nerve 
impulses from the sensory receptors in the body to the central nervous system; and the 

Anatomy and Physiology 21 
Figure 2.15 Human brain 
efferent, or motor nerve cells which convey information away from the central nervous 
system to the effectors. These include muscles and body organs. 
The highest centre of the nervous system is the brain. It has four major sub-divisions; the 
brain stem, the cerebellum, cerebrum and the diencephalon. The location in the brain of these 
various divisions is seen in Figure 2.15. Each is concerned with a specific function of the 
human body. The brain stem relays messages between the spinal cord and the brain. It helps 
control the heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and is involved with hearing, taste and 
other senses. The cerebellum is concerned with co-ordination for skeletal muscle movement. 
The cerebrum concentrates on voluntary movements, and co-ordinates mental activity. The 
diencephalon connects the mid brain with the cerebral hemispheres. Within its area it has the 
control of all sensory information, except smell, and relays this information to the cerebrum. 
Other areas within the diencephalon control the autonomic nervous system, regulate body 
heat, water balance, sleep/wake patterns, food intake and behavioural responses associated 
with emotions. 
The human brain is mostly water; about 75% in the adult. It has a consistency similar to that of 
set jelly. The brain is protected by the skull. It floats in a solution called the cerebrospinal fluid 
and is encased in three layers of tissue called the cranial meninges - the inflammation of 
which is termed meningitis. The brain is very well protected from the injury that could be 
caused by chemical compounds. Substances can only enter the brain via the blood brain 
barrier. The capillaries within the brain have walls that are highly impermeable and therefore 
prevent toxic substances causing damage to the brain. Without this protection the delicate 
neurons could easily be damaged. 
The brain is connected to the spinal cord via the brain stem. The spinal cord extends from the 
skull to the lumbar region of the human back. Presented in Figure 2.16 is the,distribution of 
the nerves from the spinal cord. Similar to the brain, the spinal cord is bathed in cerebrospinal 
fluid. The cord and the cerebrospinal fluid is contained within a ringed sheath called the 
duramatter. All these structures are contained within the vertebral column. 

22 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
The vertebral column is made up of individual vertebra that are separated from each other by 
annular intervertebral discs. These discs have similar consistency to rubber and act as shock 
absorbers for the vertebral column. Each vertebra has a canal from which the spinal nerve can 
leave the spinal column and become a peripheral nerve. Figure 2.17 illustrates the function of 
Figure 2.16 Human spinal cord 

Anatomy and Physiology 23 
Figure 2.17 Human peripheral nerve 
Derived from Carola et al., 1990 
a peripheral nerve. It transmits sensory information to the spinal cord, from which informa- 
tion can either be transmitted to the higher nervous system, the brain, for interpretation and 
action, or can be acted on directly within the spinal cord and the information sent back down 
the ventral route to initiate the response. This latter action is best illustrated by the simple 
reflex arc, illustrated in Figure 2.18. 
If the spinal cord is injured, the resulting disability is related to the level of the injury. Injuries 
of the spinal cord nearer the brain result in larger loss of function compared to injuries lower 
down the cord. Illustrated in Figure 2.19 are two types of paralysis that can occur due to 
transection of the cord. 
Paraplegia is the loss of motor and sensory functions in the legs. This results if the cord is 
injured in the thoracic or upper lumbar region. Quadriplegia involves paralysis of all four 
limbs and occurs from injury at the cervical region. Hemiplegia results in the paralysis of the 
upper and lower limbs on one side of the body. This occurs due to the rupture of an artery 
within the brain. Due to the architecture of the connections between the fight and left hand 
side of the brain, damage to the fight hand side of the brain would result in hemiplegia in the 
opposite side. 
2.6.2. Neurons 
The nervous system contains over one hundred billion nerve cells, or Neurons. They are 
specialised cells which enable the transmission of impulses from one part of the body to 
another via the central nervous system. 
Neurons have two properties; excitability, or the ability to respond to stimuli; and conductiv- 
ity, the ability to conduct a signal. A neuron is shown diagrammatically in Figure 2.20. 

24 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Figure 2.19 Types of paralysis due to transection of the spinal cord 

Anatomy and Physiology 25 
Figure 2.20 Neuron 
Dendrites conduct information towards the cell body. The axon transmits the information 
away from the cell body to another nerve body tissue. Some axons have a sheath which is 
called myelin. The myelin sheath is segmented and interrupted at regular intervals by gaps 
called neurofibral nodes. The gaps have an important function in the transmission of impulses 
along the axon. This is achieved via neurotransmitters. Unmyelinated nerve fibres can be 
found in the peripheral nervous system. Unlike the myelinated fibres they tend to conduct at a 
slower speed. 
2.6.3. Physiology of Neurons 
Neurons transmit information via electrical pulses. Similar to all other body cells, transmis- 
sion depends upon the difference in potential across the membrane of the cell wall. With 
reference to Figure 2.21, a resting neuron, is said to be polarised, meaning that the inside of 
the axon is negatively charged with relation to its outside environment. The difference in the 
electrical charge is called the potential difference. Normally the resting membrane potential is 
-70 mV. This is due to the unequal distribution of potassium ions within the axon and sodium 
ions outside the axon membrane. There are more positively charged ions outside compared to 
within the axon. 
Figure 2.22 shows the sodium/potassium pump that is found in the axon membrane. This 
pump is powered by ATP and transports three sodium ions out of the cell for every two 
potassium ions that enter the cell. 
In addition to the pump the axon membrane is selectively permeable to sodium/potassium 
through voltage gates, known as open ion channels. These come into operation when the 
concentration of sodium or potassium becomes so high on either side that the channels open 
up to re-establish the distribution of the ions in the neuron at its resting state (-70 mV). 

26 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Figure 2.21 Ions associated with neuron 
Derived from Carola et al., 1990 
2.6.4. The Mechanism of Nerve Impulses 
The process of conduction differs slightly between unmyelinated and myelinated fibres. For 
unmyelinated fibres the stimulus has to be strong enough to initiate conduction. The opening 
of ion channels starts the process called depolarisation. 
Once an area of the axon is depolarised it stimulates the adjacent area and the action potential 
travels down the axon. After depolarisation the original balance of sodium on the outside of 
the axon and potassium inside is re-stored by the action of the sodium/potassium pumps. The 
membrane is now re-polarised. 
There is a finite period whereby it is impossible to stimulate the axon in order to generate an 
action potential. This is called the refractory period and can last anything from 0.5 to 1 ms. A 
minimum stimulus is necessary to initiate an action potential. An increase in the intensity of 
the stimulus does not increase the strength of the impulse. This is called an all or none 
principle. In myelinated fibres the passage of the impulse is speeded up. This is because the 
myelin sheath around the axon acts as an insulator and the impulses jump from one neurofibral 
node to another. The speed of conduction in unmyelinated fibres ranged from 0.7 to 2.3 
metres/second, compared with 120 metres/second in myelinated fibres.

2.6.5. The Autonomic Nervous System 
A continuation of the nervous system is the Autonomic nervous system, which is responsible 
in maintaining the body's homeostasis without conscious effort. The autonomic nervous 
system is divided into sympathetic and para-sympathetic. The responsibility of each of these 
divisions is shown in Tables 2.2 and 2.3. The best example involving the autonomic nervous 
system is the 'Flight or fight' reaction. Most people have experienced this in the form of fear. 
The body automatically sets itself up for two responses - either to 'confront' the stimuli, or 
run away. The decision on which to do is analysed on a conscious level. It is obvious from 
looking at the roles of these divisions that the homeostasis of the body would be extremely 
difficult, if not impossible, to achieve without this important system. Failure of any of these 
effects would be a life threatening condition,

2.7. The Cardio-Vascular System 
The centre of the cardio-vascular system is the heart. The heart can be considered as a four 
chambered pump. It receives oxygen deficient blood from the body; sends it to get a fresh 
supply of oxygen from the lungs; then pumps this oxygen rich blood back round the body. It 
has approximately 70 beats per minute and 100,000 per day. Over 70 years the human heart 
pumps 2.5 billion times. Its size is that approximately of the clenched fist of its owner and it 
weighs anything between 200 and 400 grams, depending upon the sex of the individual. It is 
located in the centre of the chest, with two thirds of its body to the left of the mid line. 
Heart muscle is of a special variety, termed cardiac. Due to the inter-collated discs, the cells 
act together in order to beat synchronously to achieve the aim of pumping the blood around 
the body. The physiology of the action potential within the cells is similar to that of the nerves. 
The anatomical structure of the heart is shown in Figure 2.23. De-oxygenated blood returns 
from the body via the veins into the right atrium. The right atrium contracts, sending the blood 
into the fight ventricle. The one-way valve enables the blood, on the contraction of the fight 
ventricle, to be expelled to the lungs, where it is oxygenated (pulmonary system). The 
returning oxygenated blood is fed into the left atrium, and then into the left ventricle. On 
contraction of the left ventricle, again via a one-way valve, the blood is sent to the various 
parts of the body via blood vessels (Figure 2.24). The systemic/pulmonary cardiac cycle is 
shown in Figure 2.25. The whole cycle is repeated 70 times per minute. 
The contraction of the cardiac muscle is initiated by a built-in pacemaker that is independent 
of the central nervous system. With reference to Figure 2.26, the specialised nervous tissue in 
the right atrium is called the sino atrial node; it is responsible for initiating contraction. The 

Anatomy and Physiology 29 
Figure 2.23 Human heart 
Right ventdcle 
signals are passed down various nervous pathways to the atrio-ventricular node. This causes 
the two atria to contract. The nervous signal then travels down the atrio-ventricular bundles to 
initiate the contraction of the ventricles. The transmission of the various impulses along these 
pathways gives off an electrical signal. It is the measurement of these signals that produce the 
electro-cardiograph (ECG)(Figure 2.27). 
The P region of the electro-cardiograph represents atrial contraction. The ventricular contrac- 
tions are represented by the QRS wave, whilst the T waveform is ventricular relaxation. 
Typical times for the duration of the various complexes are shown in Table 2.4. Recording of 
these signals is obtained by placing electrodes on various parts of the body. These are shown 
in Figure 2.28. Other than their own specialised cells to conduct the nerve impulses, the heart 
receives other nerve signals. These come mainly from the sympathetic and para-sympathetic 
autonomic nervous system. The sympathetic system, when stimulated, tends to speed up the 
heart, while the parasympathetic system tends to slow the heart rate down. If for some reason 
the mechanism for transmitting the nervous signals from the atrium to the ventricles is 
disrupted, then the heart must be paced externally. This can be achieved by an electronic 
device called the pacemaker. This device feeds an electrical current via a wire into the fight 
ventricle. This passes an impulse at a rate of approximately seventy per minute.

2.7.1. Measurement of Blood Pressure 
When the heart contracts, it circulates blood throughout the body. The pressure of the blood 
against the wall is defined as the blood pressure. Its unit of measurement is millimetres of 
mercury (mmHg). When the ventricles contract, the pressure of the blood entering the arterial 
system is termed systolic. The diastolic pressure corresponds to the relaxation of the ventricle. 
The difference between these two pressures is termed the blood pressure (systolic/diastolic). 
A normal young adult's blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg. If the blood pressure is considerably 
higher then the patient is termed to be hypertensive. Blood pressure varies with age. The 
systolic pressure of a new-born baby may only be 40, but for a 60 year old man it could be 140 
mmHg. Causes of abnormal rises in blood pressure are numerous. Blood pressure rises 
temporarily during exercise or stressful conditions and a systolic reading of 200 mmHg would 
not be considered abnormal under these circumstances. 
2.8. Respiratory System 
The body requires a constant supply of oxygen in order to live. The respiratory system 
delivers oxygen to various tissues and removes metabolic waste from these tissues via the 
blood. The respiratory tract is shown in Figure 2.29. 
Breathing requires the continual work of the muscles in the chest wall. Contraction of the 
diaphragm and external intercostal muscles expands the lungs' volume and air enters the 
lungs. For expiration, the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm relax, allowing the 
lung volume to contract. This is accompanied by the contraction of abdominal muscles and 
the elasticity of the lungs. 
We return to a discussion of measurement of cardio-vascular function and the control of 
certain of its disorders in Chapter 4. 

Anatomy and Physiology 35

2.8.1. Volumes of Air in the Lung 
With reference to Figure 2.30, pulmonary ventilation can be broken down into various 
volumes and capacities. These measurements are obtained using a respirometer. During 
normal breathing at rest, both men and women inhale and exhale about 0.5 litre with each 
breath- this is termed the tidal volume. 
The composition of respiratory gases entering and leaving the lungs is shown in Table 2.5.

2.8.2. Diffusion of Gases 
The terminal branches in the lung are called the alveoli. Next to the alveoli are small 
capillaries. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported across the alveoli membrane wall. 
Various factors affect the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide across the alveoli capillary 
membrane. These include the partial pressure from either side of the membrane, the surface 
area, the thickness of the membrane, and solubility and size of the molecules. 

Anatomy and Physiology 
37 
Figure 2.30 Various pulmonary volumes and capacities 
Derived from Carola et al., 1990 
The inspired oxygen transfers across the alveoli membrane to the red blood cells in the 
capillaries. Oxygen attaches itself to the haemoglobin, whilst carbon dioxide is released from 
the haemoglobin and travels in the reverse direction to the alveoli. The carbon dioxide is then 
expired as waste through the respiratory system. Similarly, at the tissue, the oxygen is released 
from the red blood cells and is transported across the tissue membrane to the tissue. Carbon 
dioxide travels in the opposite direction. 
The transportation of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the red blood cells depends upon the 
concentration of a protein called haemoglobin. Haemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen 
and therefore is a necessary component in the transfer of oxygen around the human body. 
2.8.3. The Control of Breathing 
The rate and depth of breathing can be controlled consciously but generally it is regulated via 
involuntary nerve impulses. This involuntary process is mediated via the medullary area of 
the central nervous system.

Physics 
3.1. The nature of ionising radiation 
Ionising radiation is the term used to describe highly energetic particles or waves which when 
they collide with atoms cause the target atoms to receive significant kinetic energy. This 
energy may cause inelastic collisions when the target atom absorbs a proportion of the energy 
and is placed into a higher energy state. Alternatively the incident energy may be divided 
between the source and the target, in which both are displ~ with energies whose sum is the 
total incident energy. The specific mechanism which occurs is dependent on the nature of the 
incident radiation, the target and the incident energy level. Ionising radiation is produced by 
one of several phenomena. 
1. Cosmic radiation, which is mainly due to extra-terrestrial nuclear reactions. The nuclear 
processes which take place in the sun and the stars result in a small but measurable flux of 
high energy radiation which reaches and in some cases traverses the earth. This radiation is 
found (UNSC, 1982) to give rise to somewhat more than one tenth of our annual natural 
background radiation dose. 
2. Nuclear decay of unstable elements on the earth. There are rocks in the earth's crust 
containing unstable elements which undergo nuclear decay. This process gives rise to a 
small amount of nuclear radiation, but as part of the decay, certain of the child products are 
also radioactive, and these in turn give rise to radiation. In particular, there are significant 
doses due to the decay of radon-222 and radon-220 through absorption through the lungs. 
Radon is locally concentrated owing to the types of subsoil and building material used. 
3. Artificial production of ionising radiation from high energy sources. If an energetic 
electron collides with an atom, it may give up its energy inelasticaUy and produce high 
energy photons, some of which are in the X ray region. 
3.1.1. Sources of X rays 
A medical X ray tube (Figure 3.1) is built from a vacuum tube with a heated cathode which 
emits electrons. These are accelerated by a high electric potential (of up to around 300 kV) 
towards a target anode. The anode is built from a metal with a high atomic number to provide 
the best efficiency of conversion of the incident electron energy into photons. Nonetheless the 
typical efficiency is only about 0.7%. With typical tube currents of 10 to 500 mA, instantane- 
ous input powers up to 100 kW may be used. As a result, there is a significant problem of

anode heating. To reduce this problem, the anode is normally rotated at high speed (about 
3600 rpm), and is normally made with a metal which has a high melting point. Frequently the 
anode target layer is relatively thin and is backed by copper to improve thermal conduction. In 
spite of these precautions, localiseA temperatures on the anode may reach around 2500"C. 
A typical tube is about 8-10 cm in diameter and 15-20 cm in length.

Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Figure 3.2 shows a simplified schematic for an X ray power circuit. In practice, the tube is 
driven in modem sets from sophisticated supplies. In some forms of radiography which are 
outlined in Chapter 6 X ray pulses are used over a prolonged period to obtain images. 
Frequently these require pulse durations of milliseconds, it is crucial in most of these cases 
that the high voltage power supply is stable to ensure that radiation of the required spectrum is 
produced. 
3.1.1.1. X Ray Spectra 
The spectral emission of an X ray tube is shown in Figure 3.3.

~ 
Incident Energy 
Figure 3.3 Form of X ray spectrum 
The radiation emitted by an X ray tube is primarily due to Bremsstrahlung - the effect of the 
deceleration of the high energy electron beam by the target material of the X ray tube. The 
incident electrons collide with the nuclei in the target, and some result in inelastic collisions in 
which a photon is emitted. The peak photon energy is controlled by the peak excitation 
potential used to drive the tube. For a thin target, the radiant photon energy is of a uniform 
distribution. 
When a thick target is used, as is normally the case for diagnostic applications, the incident 
electrons may undergo a number of collisions in order to lose their energy. Collisions may 
therefore take place throughout the depth of the target anode. Through the thickness of the 
target, there is a progressive reduction of the mean incident energy. The result would then be 
a spectrum decreasing linearly from zero to the peak energy. However, the target material also 
absorbs a proportion of the generated X rays, preferentially at the low energy end of the 
spectrum. There are also strong spectral lines produced in the X ray spectrum as a result of the 
displacement of inner shell electrons by incident electrons. The form of the resultant spectrum 
is as shown in Figure 3.3. 
Protection against the low energy components of this spectrum may be enhanced by the use of 
filters. These are used when the low energy components would not penetrate the area of

interest adequately, and therefore simply cause potential problems due to an unnecessary 
radiation dose. Low energy components may of course be used alone when they are adequate 
to pass through small volumes of tissue in applications such as mammography. The filtered 
spectrum is shown in Figure 3.4. 
3.1.2. Radioactive decay 
The nuclei of large atoms tend to be unstable and susceptible to decay by one of several 
mechanisms. 
1. Beta emission, in which an electron is emitted from the nucleus of the atom, approximately 
retaining the atomic weight of the atom, but incrementing the atomic number. 
2. Alpha emission is due to the release of the nucleus of a helium atom from the decaying 
nucleus. Alpha particles are released with energies in the range 4-8 MeV, but readily lose 
their energy in collisions with other matter. 
3. Neutrons are emitted when a nucleus reduces its mass, but does not change its atomic 
number. Neutrons are emitted either spontaneously or as a result of an unstable atom 
absorbing a colliding neutron and then splitting into two much smaller parts together with 
the release of further neutrons. 
4. Gamma radiation is the emission of high energy photons from unstable atomic nuclei. This 
occurs frequently following either of the previously mentioned forms of decay, which 
often leave the resulting atomic nucleus in a metastable state. 
Radioactive decay is a probabilistic process: at any time there is a constant probability that 
any atom will spontaneously decay by one of these processes. The decay is not immediate, 
since there is an energy well which must be traversed before it may take place: the probability 
of the decay event taking place is related to the depth of the well. Thus for a population of N 
atoms the radioactivity Q is given by 

42 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Q -- -~N = dN/dt 
(1) 
The decay constant is related to the 'half-life' of the nuclide by: 
r)6 = (In 2)/~, 
(2) 
Radioactive decomposition of large nuclei takes place in a series of steps. For example, both 
uranium and radium are present in the earth's crust in significant quantifies. They decay 
through a series of energy reducing steps until they ultimately become lead. 
3.2. Physics of radiation absorption, types of collision 
There are several characteristic modes of collision between ionising radiation and matter: the 
mechanism depends on the form and energy of the radiation, and the matter on which it is 
incident. For our purposes, the following are the most significant. 
1. The Photoelectric Effect, in which an incident photon gives up all its energy to a planetary 
electron. The electron is then emitted from the atom with the kinetic energy it received 
from the incident photon less the energy used to remove the electron from the atomic 
nucleus. Clearly this process can only occur when the incident photon energy is greater 
than the electron's binding energy. The probability of this interaction decreases as the 
photon energy increases. 
The result of the electron loss is to ionise the atom, and if one of the inner shell electrons is 
removed, to leave the atom in an excited state. The atom leaves the excited state when an 
electron descends from an outer orbit to replace the vacancy, and a photon may be emitted, 
again having X ray energy. The photoelectric effect is the predominant means of absorp- 
tion of ionising radiation when the incident photon energy is low. 
2. The Compton Effect occurs when an incident electron collides with a free electron. The 
free electron receives part of the energy of the incident photon, and a photon of longer 
wavelength is scattered. This effect is responsible for the production of lower energy 
photons which are detected in nuclear medicine systems (see Chapter 6). Their reduced 
energy means that they may subsequently be recognised by the detection system and 
largely eliminated from the resulting image. 
3. Pair Production occurs when a highly energetic photon interacts with an atomic nucleus. 
Its energy is converted into the mass and kinetic energy of a pair of positive and negative 
electrons. This process may only occur once the incident energy exceeds the mass equiva- 
lent of two electrons (i.e. 2mc 2 - 1.02 MeV). 
4. Neutron Collisions result in a wide range of recoil phenomena: in the simplest case, the 
target atomic nucleus receives some kinetic energy from the incident neutron, which is 
itself deflected with a reduced energy. Other forms of collision take place, including the 
capture of incident neutrons leaving the atom in an excited state from which it must relax 
by further emission of energy. 
For a fuller description of these effects, the reader is referred to specialist texts, such as 
Greening (1981). 

Physics 43 
3.3. Radiation Measurement and Dosimetry 
3.3.1. Dosimetric Units 
We must firstly consider what is meant by radiation dose. Ionising radiation incident on 
matter interacts with it, possibly by one of the means outlined above. In doing so, it releases at 
least part of its energy to the matter. 
As a simple measure, we may look at the rate of arrival of radiation incident on a sphere of 
cross section da. Thefluence is 
r 
= dN/da 
where dN is the number of incident photons or particles, and the fluence rate is ~ = d~/dt. 
The unit of this measurement is therefore m-2s -l. If the energy carried by the particles is now 
considered, the energy fluence rate may be derived comparatively in units of Wm -2. The 
spectral intensity of the incident radiation is dependent on a number of factors: it is often 
important to be able to assess the spectral distribution of the incident radiation. 
The unit of decay activity of radionuclides was the Curie, which became standardised at 
3.7• 101~ -l. This is approximately the disintegration rate of a gram of radium. As the SI unit 
of rate is s -l, this unit has now been superseded by the Bequerel (Bq) with unit s -l when 
applied to radioactive decay. 
The unit of absorbed dose, being the amount of energy absorbed by unit mass of material, was 
originally the Rad, or 100 erg g-l (10-2 j kg-l) of absorbed energy. This has now also been 
superseded by the SI unit the Gray (Gy), which is defined as 1 J kg -m. 
Another unit of interest relates to exposure to ionising photon radiation. This measure 
quantifies the ionisation of air as a result of incident energy. The Roentgen (R) is defined as 
2.58 • 10 -4 C kg -l. 
The term 'Dose Equivalent' is used to denote a weighted measure of radiation dose: the 
weighting factor is derived from the stopping power in water for that type and energy of 
radiation. This measure is normally expressed in the unit Sievert (Sv) which has the same 
dimensions as the Gray, but is given a special name to denote its different basis. 
The "Effective Dose Equivalent' is the measure used to denote dose equivalent when it has 
been adjusted to take account of the differing susceptibilities of different corporal organs to 
radiation. The Effective Dose Equivalent is defined as: 
He = ~ wrHT 
(3) 
The weighting factors employed here vary between 0.25 for the gonads to 0.03 for bone 
surface, and 0.3 for the bulk of body tissue. 
3.3.2 Outline of Major Dosimetric Methods 
A wide range of methods exists for the measurement of radiation dose. They include 
fundamental methods which rely on calorimetric measurement and measurement of ionisa- 
tion: these are required as standards for the assessment of other techniques. Scintillation 
counters, which also help to r 
the received radiation, are described in Section 6.3. 

44 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
However, in practical terms, two main methods outlined below are used in monitoring 
individual exposures to radiation. In addition, as a basic protection, it is frequently wise to 
have available radiation counters when dealing with radioactive materials as they provide real 
time readings of the level of radiation present. 
3.3.2.1. Thermoluminescence 
Many crystalline materials when irradiated store electron energy in traps. These are energy 
wells from which the electron must be excited in order for it to return via the conduction band 
to a rest potential. The return of the electron to the rest state from the conduction band is 
accompanied by the release of a photon which may be detected by a photomultiplier. The 
trapping and thermoluminescent release processes are shown in Figure 3.5. If the trap state is 
sufficiently deep, the probability of the electron escaping spontaneously may be sufficiently 
low for the material to retain the electron in the excited state for a long period: it can be 
released by heating the material and observing the total light output. Various materials are 
used, but they should ideally have similar atomic number components to that of tissue if the 
radiation absorption characteristics are to have similar energy dependencies. The materials 
are used either in a powder form in capsules or alternatively embedded in a plastic matrix.

3.3.2.2. Film Badge 
The photographic film badge is a familiar and rough and readily portable transducer for the 
measurement of radiation dose. The film is blackened by incident radiation, although unfortu- 
nately its energy response does not closely match that of tissue. The badge holder therefore 
contains various metal filters which provide a degree of discrimination between different 
types of and energies of incident radiation. The badges worn by radiation workers are 
typically swapped and read out on a monthly basis to provide a continuing record of their 
exposure to radiation. 

Physics 45 
3.4. Outline of the Appfication of Radiation in Medicine 
- Radiology, Radiotherapy 
Ionising radiation is used in medicine in two main applications. As the radiation is in some 
cases very energetic it is able to pass through body tissue with limited absorption. The 
differential absorption of radiation in different types of tissue makes it possible to obtain 
images of the internal structures of the body by looking at the remaining radiation if a beam of 
X or gamma radiation is shone through a region of the body. Absorbed doses (see section 
3.3.1) from diagnostic investigations are typically around 0.1 mSv. 
Additionally, radioactive substances may be injected into the body as 'labels' in biochemical 
materials which are designed to localise themselves to particular organs or parts of organs. 
The radiation emitted from the decay of these materials may be examined externally to derive 
an image of the organ's condition. As ionising radiation presents a significant risk of causing 
biological damage to tissue, if large doses of radiation may be administered to specific areas 
of body tissue it is possible to destroy cancerous tissue selectively and without the risks 
entailed with surgery. The doses involved in radiotherapy are much higher, being typically 
localised doses of tens of Gy delivered in smaller doses of a few Gy at intervals of several 
days. 
3.5. Physics of NMR 
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is a physical effect which has become increasingly used in 
medical imaging since the 1970s. This section provides a simple outline of the physics of the 
NMR process. An overview of the instrumentation which is used to obtain images from this 
process is presented in Chapter 4. 
In essence we will find that images using NMR are effectively maps of the concentration of 
hydrogen atoms. The images obtained are of high resolution. The display is derived from 
details of a subject's morphology based on factors different from those examined when 
conventional radiological studies are made. The examination technique has fewer apparent 
inherent dangers than does the use of ionising radiation, but has the serious drawback of the 
high capital cost of the equipment used to obtain images. 
3.5.1. Precessional Motion 
Probably the easiest point to start an understanding of NMR is by looking at the motion of a 
spinning particle in a field. Consider a child's spinning top. If it is placed spinning so that one 
end of its axis is pivoted, then the mass of the top acts with the earth's gravitational field and 
the reaction of the pivot to form a couple which tends to rotate the spinning angular 
momentum vector downwards (Figure 3.6). Since however angular momentum is conserved, 
a couple is produced which causes the top to make a precessional motion about its pivot. 
Expressing this in mathematical notation, and using the symbols from the diagram (note that 
bold type refers to vector quantities), a torque is caused by gravity acting on the mass of the 
top: 
1: = r x mg 
(4) 

46 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Figure 3.6 Forces acting on a gyroscope 
Here the symbol • is the vector cross product. This torque acts on the gyroscope whose 
angular momentum is L to modify it, so that: 
= dL~t 
(5) 
,[ 
In a short time t the angular momentum of the gyroscope is modified by a small amount AL 
acting perpendicularly to L. The precessional angular velocity of the gyroscope, which is the 
rate at which its axis rotates about the z co-ordinate, may now be derived: 
~% = A~A t 
(6) 
Since we are looking at a small change in AL << L, the small angle A~ is 
AL 
xAt 
A~ =- L sin e = Lsin e 
(7) 
and the precessional velocity from equation 6 above is 
~op = A"7 = Lsine 
(8) 

Physics 47 
Substituting for z from equation 4, we obtain an expression for the magnitude of the angular 
velocity of the precessional motion: 
tot, = mgr~ 
(9) 
This tells us that the precessional angular velocity is proportional to the force due to the field 
(mg) and inversely proportional to the body's angular momentum. 
The NMR phenomenon is analogous. A spinning charge (in the simplest case a proton, the 
nucleus of a hydrogen atom) if placed in a magnetic field precesses about the field. The spin 
vector representing angular momentum may be either directed with or against the magnetic 
field: the two directions possible with hydrogen represent two different energy states. Evalu- 
ation of the concentration of hydrogen is undertaken by stimulating a proportion of the nuclei 
into the higher energy state with a radio frequency electromagnetic pulse and then examining 
the energy released as they decay into the lower state. The following paragraphs provide a 
mathematical statement of the effect so that it may be quantified. 
Firstly, a rotating charge has a magnetic moment : 
m=yI 
(10) 
in which m is the magnetic moment, and I the angular momentum, and l/yis the gyromagnetic 
ratio. In classical physics, y is el2m where 9 is the charge and m the mass of the particle. 
If the rotating charge is placed in a magnetic field of strength B, the field causes a torque which 
makes the particle's magnetic moment and, as a result, also its momentum vector, precess 
about the direction of the field. The rate of change of the particle's momentum then is given by 
dI/~t = m• 
(11) 
Now substitute in equation 10 to yield 
dm~t = u215 B 
(12) 
In the steady state, the precession continues indefinitely with an angular velocity given by 
to = -yB 
(13) 
This expression has the same form as that of the expression which we derived for a spinning 
top. In this case the precessional velocity is proportional to the strength of the applied 
magnetic field. 
We now may briefly extend our view to include a quantum mechanical description of the 
motion. In this view, energy states and angular momentum are discrete rather than a con- 
tinuum of values. In the case of a hydrogen nucleus, the permitted values of the spin quantum 
numbers are +~, representing spin vectors with and against the magnetic field. The respective 
energy states are 
E=• 
(14) 
where h is 2gh and h is Plank's constant. The separation of the levels is 
Ae = valal 
(15) 
These expressions describe the precession of the momentum vector in terms of a fixed system 
of 'Laboratory Co-ordinates'. We could instead describe the equations in terms of some other 

48 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
set of co-ordinates. It will turn out to be easier to understand the origin of the later expressions 
and visualise the processes if we transform equation 12, which is known as the Larmor 
Equation, into a rotating co-ordinate system. 
As a first step, consider a vector A which is fixed in a co-ordinate system which is rotating 
with angular frequency r c. This is shown pictorial form in Figure 3.7. In time &, its end point 
is displaced by an amount 8A, so that in terms of the fixed co-ordinate system 
8A = (o~St)A sin 0 = (r215 
(16) 
and the velocity of A in the fixed system is 
lim (SA/&) =dA/dt =(COcXA) 
(17) 
&--,0 
If now A is not fixed in the rotating system, but is itself moving at a velocity DA/Dt, its 
velocity in the laboratory co-ordinate system is 
dA/dt- DA/Dt +(COcXA )

Note that the newly introduced notation of the form DA/Dt refers to a separate differentiation 
operation. Using the form of expression shown in equation 18, we may rewrite the precessional 
motion as 
dm/dt = Dm/Dt + (co • 
and now substituting this result into equation. 12 we obtain 
Dm/Dt = 7 m xB-(co xm) 
= 3' m xB +m xco 
(19) 
(20) 
(21) 
(22) 
This expression demonstrates that in a rotating co-ordinate system, the body is subjected to an 
apparent magnetic field given by (BappfB+oYy), and that the apparent rotational velocity is 
decreased by the velocity of rotation of the co-ordinate system. We may now remove terms 
which become constant in the rotating reference frame. 
3.5.2. Resonant Motion 
We now apply a circularly polarised magnetic field B l in a plane normal to the steady field B z 
and view this from within the rotating co-ordinate system. Note that we may decompose a 
circularly polarised field into two counter-rotating sinusoidal fields of the same frequency. If 
the additional field B 1 rotates at the same frequency as the new co-ordinate system, the 
spinning particle experiences an apparent field in the sense of B z which is denoted Bap p. It 
would be seen to precess (by an observer in the rotating system) about the resultant of B 1 and 
Bap p, namely Bre s. These fields are shown schematically in Figure 3.8.

Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Br~ reduces to B I when B z = Bap p. The magnetic moment m then rotates around B 1, becoming 
parallel and antiparallel to B r In this condition, the precession frequency 
COp =-u 
=~o, 
(23) 
has the same frequency as the natural oscillation of precession of the particle's magnetic 
moment (the Lannor frequency). This is a forced resonance condition, in which the frequency 
of resonance is proportional to the applied field B,. 
3.5.3. Relaxation Processes 
Forcing energy is delivered as a pulse of electromagnetic radiation with energy in the resonant 
frequency region. Once forced into a resonance condition, the energy acquired by magnetic 
dipoles requires a time to allow it to be given up to the surrounding material. The resonant 
effect is then observed by examining the release of that energy to the surrounding material as 
the nuclear spin returns to alignment along the B B axis. Firstly we see from the diagram that 
the magnetisation M rotates in the resonant condition about the forcing function B 1. For a 
field strength of around 10 -I T, the precessional rate is in the order of 10 6 rad s -1. This means 
that it is necessary to administer pulses in the order of 1 ~ts duration. 
We have so far described the resonance phenomenon from the viewpoint of a single spinning 
particle. We now describe the system in terms of the net magnetisation M which is the sum 
~nt i over all nuclei in a unit volume. 
The first form of decay process to observe is the spin-lattice relaxation time T 1. This is the 
process in which the stimulated nuclei (normally in our cases protons) release their excess 
energy to the lattice so that the system returns to a thermodynamic balance. The relaxation 
process of the magnetisation M is described by 
dM_ (Mo-.M) 
dt 
T 1 
or M o - M = Mo e(-t/r~ ) 
(24) 
and M 0 the equilibrium magnetisafion. This relaxation time is about 2 seconds for water, but 
values are typically in the range between 10 -4 and l if t s. The relaxation processes use a 
number of different physical mechanisms by which energy is tr~sferred to the lattice from 
the resonating nuclei: see Lerski (1985) for a description of various physical models. 
In addition to this effect, the spins of neighbouring nuclei may interact. A precessing nucleus 
produces a local field disturbance = 10 -4 T in its nearest neighbour in water causing a 
dephasing of protons in - 10 -4 s owing to their frequency differences. The spin-spin interac- 
tion time is commonly denoted T 2. 
These relaxation processes effectively limit the rate at which an image may be acquired using 
NMR and its spectral resolution. T 1 means that having stimulated one region, the signal from 
that area must decay before another area may be stimulated in order to determine its proton 
population. 

Physics 51 
3.6. Ultrasound 
Sound is the perception of pressure fluctuations travelling through a medium; its waves are 
transmitted as a series of compressions and rarefactions. There are a number of ways in which 
this pressure fluctuation can be transmitted which give rise to three classes of wave which are 
outlined below. 
Ultrasound is defined as sound above the range of hearing of the human ear. This is usually 
taken to be 20 kHz although the appreciation of sound above 16 kHz is exceptional. Figure 3.9 
gives an indication of the classification of sound and some natural and manmade phenomena 
and uses.

3.6.1. Longitudinal or Pressure Waves 
In a Longitudinal wave the particles of the transmission medium move with respect to their 
rest position. The particle movement causes a series of compressions and rarefactions. The 
wave front travels in the same direction as the particle motion. The particle movement and 
subsequent compressions cause corresponding changes in the local density and optical 
refractive index of the material of the medium. 
3.6.2. Shear or Transverse Waves 
In shear waves, the wave front moves at right angles to the particle motion. Shear waves are 
often produced when a longitudinal wave meets a boundary at an oblique angle. 
3.6.3. Surface, Rayleigh or Lamb Waves 
Rayleigh or Lamb waves occur at the surface of materials and only penetrate a few wave- 
lengths deep. These waves occur only in solids. Some semiconductor filters have been 
developed which rely on the properties of surface waves travelling in crystalline materials. 
For medical applications we need only consider longitudinal waves as both Imaging and 
Doppler techniques rely on the propagation of longitudinal waves. Shear waves can propagate 
in fluids: however, they are not intentionally produced. 

52 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
3.7. Physics of Ultrasound 
3.7.1. Velocity of the Propagating Wave 
The velocity (c) of a longitudinal wave travelling through a fluid medium is given by the ratio 
of its bulk modulus to its density. 
c = ~p 
(25) 
/ 
where 
K - bulk modulus 
p = density 
3.7.2. Characteristic Acoustic Impedance 
The relationship between particle pressure and the particle velocity is analogous to Ohm's 
law. Pressure and velocity correspond to voltage and current respectively. The acoustic 
impedance is therefore a quantity analogous to impedance in electrical circuits. It is related to 
particle pressure and velocity by the following equation: 
p = Z v 
(26) 
where 
p= particle pressure 
v= particle velocity 
Z= acoustic impedance 
Acoustic impedance can be expressed as a complex quantity in the manner of electrical 
impexlance. However for most practical medical applications it can be considered in a simple 
form. The characteristic acoustic impedance of a material is the product of the density and the 
speed of sound in the medium: 
Z = pc 
(27) 
where p = density in kg m -3. 
Hence, materials with high densities have high acoustic impedances. For instance steel has a 
higher acoustic impedance than persl~x. The following table shows materials with similar 
and dissimilar acoustic impedances. 
Similar Z 
Iron - Steel 
Water- Oil 
Fat- Muscle 
Dissimilar Z 
Water - Air 
Steel - Fat 

Physics 53 
The dimensions of the acoustic impedance are kg m -2 s -l. Most materials found in the human 
body or used in transducers have acoustic impedances of the order of 106 kg m -2 s-I; 
therefore, the commonly expressed unit of acoustic impedance is the Rayle. One Rayle is

3.7.3. Acoustic Intensity 
Consider a particle vibrating with Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) in a lossless medium. The 
total energy of the particle (eros/) is the sum of its potential and kinetic energies. If the 
medium is lossless the total energy is constant. The total energy of the particle when at zero 
displacement from its resting position is given by its kinetic energy: 
1 
etota I = -~ m %2 
(28) 
where 
v o = velocity when at zero displacement 
m = particle mass 
The total mass of particles contained within unit volume is given by the density of the medium 
(p). Therefore the total energy of the particles in unit volume is given by 
E~ = 2p %2 
(29) 
The intensity (/) of a wave can be defined as the energy passing through unit area in unit time. 
The wave velocity is the rate at which this particle energy passes through the medium. 
Therefore in unit time a unit area will travel a distance of c metres, defining a volume c. As the 
total energy per unit volume is Eyuv, the energy passing through unit area in unit time will be 
given by

This equation's dimensions are: I = m s -1 x kg m -3 x m 2 s -2 = kg s -3. 
The units of intensity are watts per square metre, which is equivalent to kg s -3. 
(31) 
3.7.4. Reflection 
If a longitudinal wave travelling through a medium meets an interface with a different 
medium, reflection or transmission of the wave will occur. The laws of geometric reflection 
can be applied as long as the wavelength of the ultrasound is small compared to the 
dimensions of the interface. If this is so the reflection is said to be 'specula'. However, if this 
condition does not apply then scattering occurs. This will be considered in section 3.7.7. 
Consider a wave travelling through a medium and impinging upon an interface at an angle 0 i 
(Figure 3.11), a portion of the wave will be reflected at an angle 0, equal to the angle of 
incidence. Some of the wave is transmitted at an angle 0 t given by Snell's law.

For a particular interface, as the angle of incidence increases, the angle of transmission also 
increases until the point of total internal reflection is reached. Total internal reflection occurs 
when the angle of the transmitted wave is equal to ~/2. Therefore from equation (32) the 
incident angle for total reflection to occur is given by:

3.7.4.1. Pressure Relationship 
The particle pressure at an interface must be continuous. Therefore the sum of the particle 
pressure on one side is equal to that on the other or 
Pi + Pr = Pt 
(34) 
Consider a wave with particle velocity v i impinging upon an interface at an angle 0 r The 
velocity either side of the interface is also continuous and therefore. 
v i cosOi - v r cosO r = v t cosO t 
(35) 
As the particle velocity is a vector, the reflected velocity is negative (in the opposite direction) 
with respect to the incident wave. 
Recalling equation (26) equations (34) and (35) can now be combined 
Pi//z, COSei-P~//z, cosO r = ~ 
cose, 
(36) 
P,/Pi is known as the pressure reflectivity and P/Pi is known as the pressure transmittivity. 
Equation (36)can be solved to yield:

These equations are often shortened by assuming the incidence to be normal so all the cosine 
terms are 1. Therefore equations (37) and (38) reduce tO:

There will therefore be no reflection at an interface between two materials if their acoustic 
impedances are equal.

Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Consider an ultrasound wave travelling from medium 1 to medium 2 with acoustic imped- 
ances Z 1 and Z, z respectively. If Z I > Z 2 the reflected wave will be ~: radians out of phase with 
the incident wave. However, if Z ! < Z 2 the reflected wave will be in phase with the incident 
wave. 
3.7.4.2. Intensity Relationship 
The preceding equations define the transmission of a pressure wave across a boundary. By 
following the derivation for obtaining pressure expressions we may arrive at equations which 
define the intensity of waves at a boundary. Recall equation (31) which may be substituted 
into equations (37) and (38) to describe the wave intensity.

where Ir/l i is known as the intensity reflectivity and It/l i is known as the intensity 
transmittivity. These equations are often simplified by assuming normal incidence so equat- 
ing all the cosine terms to 1. Therefore equation (40) becomes:

(41) 
Hence, the degree of transmission or reflection of the pressure or the intensity of an acoustic 
wave incident on a boundary between two materials is related to their acoustic impedances. 
Recalling the table of material pairs with similar and dissimilar acoustic impedances, clearly 
there will be minimal transmission and almost total reflection between the dissimilar materi- 
als. Conversely negligible reflection and almost total transmission occurs between similar 
materials.

3.7.4.3. Transmission Through Thin Layers 
The preceding analysis determined equations relating the intensity of a wave incident on an 
interface to the acoustic impedance of the two materials. The transmission of ultrasound 
through a thin layer is given by the following equation. It is a special case and will be 
considered as it has important implications for transducer design and practical application of 
ultrasound in medicine (Hill 1986). 
T =

Where T is the transmission and h is the thickness of the thin layer with impedance Z 2 
between media Z l and Z 3. 
There are three situations when this equation can be simplified. 
1. 
If ~ >> Z 2 and Z 3 >> Z 2 then the right hand side of the denominator will be large and 

Physics 
57 
therefore the transmission of ultrasound through the thin layer will be negligible. This 
situation occurs when there is a layer of air trapped between an ultrasound transducer 
and a patient. 
2. 
If cos 2 2~ ~-2 = 1 i.e. when t 2 = nZ 2 where n = 1,2,3, 4,5, 6 .... then 
r=

(z, + 
In this instance the thickness of the thin layer is chosen such that transmission through it is 
independent of its acoustic properties. This is known as a half wave matching layer.

If the impedance of the second material can be chosen such that it is equal to Z 2 = ~
)
 
then the transmission through the layer can be total. This situation is known as a quarter wave 
matching layer. 
Both quarter and half wave matching layers are used in ultrasonics (section 3.9.3); however, 
the properties of these layers depend on the wavelength in the second medium and therefore 
as the wavelength changes with frequency they are frequency, specific. 
3.7.5. Attenuation 
So far we have referred to the conducting medium for ultrasonic propagation as lossless. 
However, in all practical situations the intensity of a wave diminishes with its passage. The 
reduction in the intensity or pressure of a wave passing through a medium in the x direction is 
referred to as the attenuation of the medium. The reduction in the wave can be attributed to a 
number of effects: namely reflection, wave mode conversion (longitudinal to shear), beam 
spreading, scattering and absorption. Attenuation varies with frequency as both scattering and 
absorption are frequency dependent. 
The attenuation of a medium is expressed in terms of dB cm -l at a particular frequency. 
Attenuation can be determined for the pressure or intensity of a wave. The intensity attenua- 
tion coefficient is given by 
AI = 10 log 
12 
(43) 
and the pressure attenuation coefficient by 
A, = 20 log&

In each case x is the displacement between the points 1 and 2 where intensity and pressure 
II,P I and 12,P 2 were measured. 

58 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
3.7.6. Absorption 
An ultrasonic wave travelling through a medium is absorbed when wave energy is dissipated 
as heat. Absorption occurs when the pressure and density changes within the medium caused 
by the travelling wave become out of phase. When this happens wave energy is lost to the 
medium. The fluctuations become out of phase with the density changes as the stress with the 
medium causes the flow of energy to other forms. In section 3.7.3 we derived an expression 
for the intensity of a wave travelling through a lossless medium by considering the energy of 
a particle to be composed entirely of potential and kinetic energy. 
In a real medium, the total wave energy is shared between a number of forms which include 
molecular vibration and structural energy. During the compression cycle of the longitudinal 
wave, mechanical potential energy is transferred to other forms. During the rarefaction of the 
medium the energy transfer reverses and the energy is returned to the wave. The energy 
transfer is referred to as a relaxation process. 
The relaxation process takes a finite amount of time, known as the relaxation time (the inverse 
of which is known as the relaxation frequency). If the wave is at low frequency then the 
energy transfer can be complete~. However, as the frequency increases, the energy transfer 
becomes out of phase with the wave, energy is lost and absorption occurs. The absorption 
increases with frequency reaching a maximum at the relaxation frequency. At frequencies 
above the relaxation frequency the absorption decreases as there is insufficient time for the 
initial energy transfer to take place. 
Figure 3.12a shows the variation of absorption with frequency for a single relaxation process. 
If one considers two relaxation processes with different relaxation frequencies, one would 
find that, generally, the higher frequency process would cause greater absorption. This 
situation is depicted in Figure 3.12b.

Physics 59 
In biological materials there is a large number of different relaxation processes, each of which 
has a characteristic differing relaxation frequency. Therefore, the absorption characteristic of 
tissue increases approximately linearly with frequency and is attributable to the summation of 
absorption from a large number of relaxation processes. 
3.7.7. Scattering 
If a wave with wavelength Z impinges upon a boundary whose dimensions are large compared 
to the wavelength, then specular reflection will occur. However, if the obstacle is smaller than 
the wavelength or of comparable size the laws of geometric reflection will not apply. In this 
instance, the wave is said to scattered using one of two different processes, Rayleigh and 
Stochastic. 
1. The Rayleigh region is when the dimensions of the scattering object are very much less 
than the wavelength of the incident ultrasound. In the Rayleigh region incident ultrasound 
is scattered equally in all directions. The relationship determining the degree of scattering 
is the same as that derived for light. See, for example, Longhurst (1967). 
Scattering = 
o= 
2. If the dimensions of the scatterer are similar to the wavelength of the incident ultrasound 
then the scattering is stochastic. In this region there is a square law relationship between 
the degree of scattering and frequency. 
The ratio of the incident ultrasonic intensity to the power scattered at a particular angle is 
known as the scattering cross section. If S I is the power of the scattered ultrasound and I I is the 
intensity of the incident ultrasound then or, the scattering cross section, is given by 
sl 
0t -~ -"-- 
I1 
In Doppler blood flow detection and in medical imaging the majority of the detected signal 
originates from scattered ultrasound. Therefore the variation of scattering with angle is of 
importance. The ratio of the intensity of the ultrasound scattered at a particular angle to the 
intensity of the incident ultrasound is the differential scattering cross section (the scattering 
cross section at a particular angle). Of most importance in medical imaging and Doppler 
blood flow studies is the scattering cross section at 180 ~ which corresponds to ultrasound 
transmitted directly back to the source as this determines the signal detected by the system. 
3.7.8. Attenuation in Biological Tissues 
The attenuation in biological materials has been measured both in vivo and in vitro. Tests are 
conducted at a given temperature, pressure and frequency. The standard values determined 
may find some clinical importance: for example, attenuation in tumour tissue is different from 
attenuation in breast tissue. However, attenuation by tissue is not at present used routinely in 
clinical situations. The attenuation of various tissues is represented in Figure 3.13. These 
values are important when designing any ultrasound system as they determine the strength of 
the echoes received from a certain depth in either ultrasonic imaging or Doppler studies.

3.8. The Doppler Effect 
3.8.1. Introduction 
The Doppler effect was first derived in 1845 by the German physicist C.J. Doppler (1803- 
1853). He noted that there was a change in the detected frequency when a source of sound 
moved relative to an observer. 
The Doppler effect will have been noticed by readers as the world we live in is full of 
examples of the slight change in the sound detected from a moving object. For example, when 
an ambulance with a siren or a motor bike passes, the note we hear is affected by the velocity 
of the source. 
The sounds we hear are characterised by their frequencies. When a sound is emitted from a 
moving source the apparent frequency a stationary observer detects is affected. The apparent 
frequency will increase if the velocity of an emitter is positive, towards the detector, con- 
versely the frequency will be lowered if the velocity is negative (the sign of the frequency 
shift is therefore dependent on the sign of the velocity). This is why the effect is most 
noticeable when the source passes us, as the velocity becomes negative and the Doppler shift 
suddenly changes from being positive to negative. The magnitude of the Doppler effect 
depends on the magnitude of the velocity. 
The Doppler effect has been used for many years for military and commercial Radar allowing 
the velocity and the position of an aeroplane to be determined. In medicine, Doppler 
techniques have been substantially developed for blood flow studies enabling determination 
of blood flow velocity, detection of turbulence associated with pathological disturbances and 
the detection of foetal heart beats. 
3.8.2. Derivation Of Doppler Equations 
3.8.2.1. Stationary Detector Moving Source 
Figure 3.14 is a diagrammatic representation of the effect of the moving source. If the velocity 
is away from the detector then the apparent wavelength is increased. Conversely movement 
towards the detector shortens the apparent wavelength and increases the frequency. 
Think of an object emitting sound moving directly away from an observer and at constant 
velocity. Then the apparent wavelength detected by the observer will be elongated by the 
distance that the source moves while that wave is being emitted.

This is the Doppler equation for a moving source, the sign of the denominator is positive for 
movement away from the detector and negative for movement towards the detector. 
3.8.2.2. Special case for v<<c 
If the velocity of the source v is small compared with the velocity of the wave in the medium, 
then equation (52) can be simplified by using a series expansion.

In Doppler analysis of blood flow v << c as the velocity of sound is approximately 1500 ms -l in 
most soft tissues and the blood flow velocity is in the range 0 to 5 ms -l. 
The Doppler shift is therefore directly proportional to the source frequency, the source 
velocity and inversely proportional to the speed of sound in the medium of interest. 

Physics 63 
3.8.2.3. Moving Detector and Stationary Source 
Consider a stationary source emitting sound waves and a detector moving with velocity v in a 
straight line towards the source as depicted in Figure 3.15. The wavelength in this situation 
stays constant and the apparent velocity increases causing the detector to cross a greater 
number of wave crests leading to a consequently increased frequency. Hence the frequency 
increases by the extra number of waves received in time At.

64 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Figure 3.16 Velocity vector 
When considering Doppler shifts caused by moving interfaces, the vector component of the 
velocity has to be considered. Therefore, only the component of the scattering object's 
velocity acting along the axis of the ultrasound wave is considered (see Figure 3.16a). If a 
scatterer is moving at a angle ~ to the ultrasound beam then the component of the velocity 
acting along the axis is given by vcosO. 
Normally, the ultrasound probe consists of a transmitting transducer and a separate receiving 
transducer. These two transducers necessarily make different angles to the velocity vector of 
the scatterer (see Figure 3.16b). 
3.8.3. Doppler Blood Flow Studies 
In Doppler blood flow studies ultrasound is scattered from a moving object back to a 
transmitting transducer as depicted in Figure 3.17. 
Ultrasound is transmitted from a stationary source and scattered back from a moving scatterer. 
Therefore there are two Doppler shifts: 
9 The first shift occurs as the ultrasound strikes the moving scatterer, the situation is that of 
a stationary source and a moving detector. 

Physics 65 
Figure 3.17 Doppler flow measurement 
The second frequency shift occurs as the ultrasound is scattered back, this situation is that 
of a stationary detector and a moving source. 
This can perhaps be appreciated if you consider the radar detection of an aeroplane's velocity. 
If a radar signal is transmitted from the ground, the frequency detected by the plane's radar 
operator will be shifted due to the plane's velocity (the first Doppler shift). The radar signal 
reflected back to the ground will neither be that originally transmitted nor that detected on the 
plane but rather a further shifted signal (the second Doppler shift). 
Consider the situation where an object moves towards the ultrasound probe. The first Doppler 
shift will be given by equation (64).

3.9. Generation and Detection of Ultrasound 
Ultrasound is defined as acoustic vibration above the range of human hearing. As the 
frequency lies between 20 kHz and 20 MHz there is a variety of methods of generation and 
detection. At low frequencies ultrasound may be generated by sper 
loud speakers and 
sirens. At higher frequencies however, these mechanisms become difficult, and piezo electric 
and magneto strictive transducers are used. 
In medical application with frequencies between I and 12 MHz piezo electric transducers are 
used for both generation and detection of ultrasound. 

Physics 
67 
3.9.1. Piezo Electric Materials 
When a piezo electric material is stressed a potential difference is produced. Conversely when 
a potential is applied a stress is produced within the material. These two phenomena are 
exploited respectively in the detection and generation of ultrasound. Figure 3.19 demonstrates 
how a piezo electric material may be used to generate and detect ultrasound. 
Piezo electric properties are due to thc chemical morphology of the material. In a piezo 
electric material the constituent molecules are electrically polarised i.e. one end of the 
molecule is electrically negative and the other end positive. The polarisation is due to the 
unequal sharing of electrons within the molecule. For example when fluorine combines with 
other elements to form a molecule the fluorine has a strong attraction for electrons and

therefore is electro negative with respect to the rest of the molecule. Electrically polarised 
molecules are referred to as dipoles In naturally occurring materials the electrical dipoles are 
normally randomly arranged and the material therefore exhibits weak piezo electric properties. 
3.9.1.1. Electro Mechanical Properties of Piezo Electric Elements 
The characteristics of piezo electric materials are classified by a number of coefficients. 
The eleetromeehanieal coupling factor (k 2) is the ratio of the mechanical energy converted to 
electrical energy to the total mechanical energy input to the material. 
Conversely the factor may be defined as the ratio of electrical energy converted to mechanical 
energy to the total electrical energy input to the material. 
k2 = energy eonv.erted 
(73)

The ratio of the electrical potential developed by a piezo electric element in response to an 
applied mechanical stress is denoted by the coefficient g known as the piezo electric voltage 
constant.

When a piezo electric element is subjected to a force a charge is developed, the coefficient d is 
defined as the ratio of the charge produced to the applied force and is referred to as the piezo 
electric charge constant. Alternatively d may be defined as the resultant deformation due to an 
applied potential. 
d = charge produced 
(75) 
applied force 
The value of g should be high for a piezo electric element used in a receiving mode. Generally 
it is desirable for transducer materials to have high values of k 2, d and g. 
A transducer element exhibits piezo electric behaviour in three dimensions. The coefficients 
k 2, d and g can be expressed in terms of the relationship between quantities applied in the 
same or different planes. For instance k 2 is expressed for thickness mode vibrations as k2r or 
k233 where the subscripts refer to the 3rd plane of the element or the thickness. Alternatively 
k231 refers to the coupling of energy between the third and first plane of the transducer 
element.

The constants d, g and k 2 vary with temperature. A material's piezo electric properties 
disappear at the Curie Point, and are not constant with time. In addition a piezo electric 
element may become depolarised by high stresses and high alternating fields. 
3.9.1.2. Types of Piezo Electric Materials 
There are naturally occurring piezo electric materials such as quartz which display piezo 
electric properties when cut along a particular plane to obtain domain alignment. Quartz has 
been used for many years as a piezo electric material in transducers. Some biological 
materials, such as bone, are weakly piezo electric. However, the majority of piezo electric 
materials used in ultrasonic transducers are manmade. There are three types of manmade 
piezo electric material: crystalline, ceramic and polymer. 
Crystalline materials such lithium niobate are grown in solution and are, therefore, difficult to 
produce and shape by machining. Ceramic materials such as lead zirconium titanate (PZT) 
and Polymer materials such as polyvinyl diflouride (PVDF) are heated close to a maten'al 
dependent temperature known as the Curie Point or Temperature. When heated above this 
temperature the piezo electric domains disappear, reappearing when thematerial temperature 
falls. If the material temperature is close to the Curie Point the domains can move and 
therefore a potential may be applied to attain domain alignment as the material is cooled. 
Polymer materials are stretched to increase their piezo electric properties. 
Ceramic materials have high piezoelectric coefficients when compared to polymer materials. 
However, the acoustic impedance of ceramic materials (approximately 30 Rayle) is an order 
of magnitude greater than that of soft body tissues (fat approximately 1.5 Rayle). Ceramic 
materials produce high mechanical and electrical responses when used as either generators or 
detectors of ultrasound. However they suffer from poor transmission of ultrasound through 
the tissue-transducer interface. Polymer materials have an acoustic impedance well matched 
to the acoustic impedance of body tissues but have low piezo electric coupling factors (k2). 
To produce a material with good piezo electric properties and low acoustic impedance some 
further transducer materials have been developed which are called copolymers. These consist 
of powdered piezo electric ceramic within a polymer material. 
3.9.1.3. Transducer Properties 
In medical applications transducer elements are formed from discs of the piezo electric 
material (Figure 3.20). When a piezo electric element is excited it can vibrate in three 
dimensions. The required vibration for an ultrasonic transducer in a medical application is in 
thickness mode, that is vibrating along the x axis in Figure 3,20. The disc is supported around 
its rim and polarised along the x axis. 
When a transducer is excited ultrasound is emitted from both faces of the disc. Part of the 
energy arriving at the front face is reflected back into the transducer element. This reflected 
signal is itself partially reflected by the rear face and returned in the original direction of the 
wave. Some of the energy arriving at the front face will therefore have travelled a distance 
equal to twice the disc thickness. If this extra trip distance is equal to one wavelength, 
constructive interference takes place. 
The frequency which results from that wavelength is the natural or resonant frequency of the 
disc. The disc may resonate at odd multiples of this frequency giving rise to harmonics. There 

70 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Figure 3.20 Mounting crystals 
is therefore a number of resonant frequencies of a transducer disc. However, the strength of 
the resonance decreases with increasing frequency. The transducer element exhibits resonant 
behaviour both when transmitting and receiving ultrasound. 
The quality of resonance of any system can be described in terms of the width of its half 
energy amplitude (-3 riB) (see Figure 3.21). This factor is termed the Quality or Q of the 
resonance and is defined as: 
Q = fu'ppe~-~lo~,,~,. 
(76) 
A high Q system is by definition of narrow bandwidth. 
The resonance of a transducer element is restricted by losses in the material. Crystalline and 
ceramic materials have low internal losses and therefore resonate strongly. In contrast 
polymer materials have high losses and a weak resonance and, therefore, exhibit a broad 
frequency response with low Q. 
3.9.2. Transducers' Characteristics 
Transducer characteristics can be damped (to reduce their Q) by backing the disc with an 
energy absorbing material with an acoustic impedance similar to that of the transducer 
element. In practice the Q of a transducer can be reduced most easily by backing the element 
with the same material as the active element but in an un-polarised form, or with tungsten

loaded epoxy resin. The energy transmitted through the rear surface of the transducer is then 
dissipated in the backing. High Q transducers are constructed with air backing which 
deliberately provides poor coupling. 
3.9.2.1. Transducer Fields 
The acoustic field produced by a transducer depends on the designed frequency, the active 
element diameter and shape. The calculation of a transducer's acoustic field is achieved by 
modelling the surface of the piezo electric crystal as a series of infinitely small piston 
generators. The field pattern is then calculated by determining the interference between the 
waves generated by each piston. This method of calculating the transducer field is referred to 
as Huygen's Method. 
The acoustic field produced by a transducer is complicated. Two forms of approximation are 
used to provide simplified working models. Close to the transducer, the Fresnel approxima- 
tion provides the better estimates of the field, whereas at greater distances, the Fraunhofer 
approximation is employed. The intensity calculated using the Fresnel approximation in the 
vicinity of a transducer of diameter D is an oscillatory pattern over a region of approximately 
the transducer 's dimensions. At depths of D2/4~, the oscillatory pattern gives way to a region 
of uniformly divergent intensity. At a distance of Xnear given by 

72 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Xnear = D2/7~ 
(77) 
the half power width of the beam equals the transducer diameter. Whilst the Fresnel model is 
valid at all depths, the analysis required to obtain it is more complex, so at greater depths the 
Fraunhofer approximation is appropriate. In this case the width of the beam is defined by xZID 
(where x is the distance from the transducer face), which effectively limits the lateral 
resolution of the transducer. An analytic treatment of these models is provided by Macovski 
(1983). 
Figure 3.22 shows the characteristic field shape produced by a disc transducer when transmit- 
ting continuously. The field can be considered as consisting of two regions, the near field and 
the far field. Figure 3.22 shows these two regions. The limit of the near field can be defined as

the distance from the transducer face when the 3 dB beam width is equal to the diameter of the 
transducer. The pulsed field distribution is represented schematically in Figure 3.22. It differs 
from the continuous field as the pressure distribution is approximately uniform in the near 
field. 
In medical applications transducers are designed to perform in the near field region which is 
up to the point where the field rapidly diverges. Therefore, the maximum depth of scan is 
effectively controlled by the degradation of the lateral resolution which is related to the disc 
diameter and operating frequency. 
3.9.3. Basic Transducer Design 
The basic design of an ultrasonic transducer is shown in Figure 3.23. 
1. The choice of piezo electric material was described in section 3.9.1. 
2. The electrodes which connect to the transducer are thin layers of either gold or aluminium. 
The layers are deposited by evaporating metallic wire in a vacuum. The piezo electric 
material is masked to ensure that the desired regions only are coated with the metal. The 
thickness of the layer is minimised to reduce interference with the emitted ultrasound. 
3. The choice of backing material is dependent on the required use. For Doppler applications 
a mismatched backing allows the disc to resonate at its natural frequency: this maximises 
the output power at this specific frequency. In this instance almost no ultrasound is 
transmitted through the backing so the majority of energy produced is transmitted usefully 
through the front face of the transducer. Doppler signals have a narrow bandwidth 
compared to the response of the transducers at high frequencies and so the transducer 
design can utilise a high Q resonant response. 
Figure 3.23 Transducer design 

74 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
For imaging purposes the backing material is chosen to match the impedance of the 
transducer material. To avoid an excessive reflected pulse being returned by the rear face 
of the transducer and thus prolonging the emitted wave, the backing should provide high 
attenuation. The backing is loaded with tungsten powder. 
4. Thickness mode vibrations at the desired frequency are obtained by choosing the element 
thickness to be half the wavelength at the resonant frequency. 
5. For medical imaging purposes the object is required to be within the near field of the 
transducer since the field spreads after this point and therefore reduces the lateral resolu- 
tion. Therefore having chosen the operating frequency and the required depth of field the 
disc diameter can be determined from equation (77). 
6. The proportion of acoustic power transmitted from the active element to the tissue depends 
on the acoustic impedance match of the patient to the transducer element. Recalling the 
result for the transmission of sound through a thin layer in section 3.7.4.3, total transmis- 
sion can be achieved if the impedance of a layer one quarter of a wavelength thick is 
chosen so that its acoustic impedance is equal to: 
where Z l, 7_~ and Z 3 are the acoustic impedances of the transducer element, matching layer 
and patient respectively. 
Therefore the acoustic impedance of a transducer element can be matched to that of the 
body and total transmission achieved. However, thickness of the layer will only equate to 
one quarter of the wavelength at a particular frequency. Therefore, although useful, 
matching layers tend to reinforce the narrow bandwidth characteristics of ceramic trans- 
ducers. 
7. The electrical impedance of the transducer element can be matched further to reduce the Q 
of the resonance and therefore increase the transducer bandwidth. This is achieved by 
using a shunt inductor to match the impedance of the transducer disc at its resonant 
frequency. The capacitance of the transducer disc can be determined from its thickness, the 
dielectric constant of the piezo electric material and the electrode area. The inductor 
required to match this at resonance is given by the following equation. 
1 
1 
L= 
where f is the resonant frequency of the transducer and C is the capacitance of the 
transducer. 
The impedance of the transducer may be matched to that of the receiving amplifier by a 
transformer. 
8. The transducer housing protects the relatively fragile transducer element and provides 
electrical screening. The housing may also be shaped so that reflections from the back 
surface are not directed back to the piezo electric element.

4.2. Measurement Systems 
The following sections are a brief introduction to the application of electronic measurement 
systems used in medical applications. This material is provided here only as a brief summary' 
the interested reader is referred to dedicated texts on these systems for a more thorough 
insight into current practice.

4.2.1. Transducer 
A transducer is the functional element that converts one form of energy to another. A 
physiological measurement instrument may consist of a multitude of transducers and elec- 
tronic circuits to process their signals. Transducers convert a parameter from one form of 
energy to another form which is amenable to measurement. For example pressure measure- 
ment transducers consist of a membrane which converts a pressure difference into movement 
or strain, which in turn is transformed into a varying resistance by a strain gauge. The 
resultant varying resistance can be incorporated in a circuit to enable measurement of relative 
pressure. There is a vast and ever increasing number of transducers available to the engineer: 
many employ semi conductor technology. Examples of transducers are: piezo electric crystal, 
strain gauge, and photo diode. 

Physiological Instrumentation 
77 
4.2.2. Front End Circuits 
Signals originating from transducers often require conditioning before they can be analysed. 
Many transducers require excitation, as is the case with strain gauges, or incorporation within 
a circuit so that their characteristics may be analysed. The function of front end circuits then is 
to provide excitation of the primary transducer and to condition the detected signal. Signal 
conditioning may include pre-amplification and filtering. 
4.2.3. Isolation 
Modern physiological instrumentation is designed to rigorous safety standards to provide 
patient protection from the instrument or other inter connected instruments. Therefore there is 
a requirement to isolate the transducer and front end circuits from the rest of the equipment, to 
reduce the possibility of dangerous currents and voltages coming into contact with the patient. 
The isolation also serves to protect the patient from instrument faults. Isolation is provided as 
close to the patient as possible so that most circuits are separated: this reduces the demands on 
the power supply for the isolated section and the complexity of the isolation. 
4.2.4. Intermediate Circuits 
Intermediate circuits provide signal conditioning, filtering, amplification and analysis. For 
example the return signal from a Doppler blood flow detector is amplified in front end 
circuits, further amplified and filtered in the intermediate circuits. The signal is then modu- 
lated and the frequency deviation detected using either a zero crossing detector or phase 
locked loop. Thus the intermediate circuits provide signal conditioning, transformation and 
detection. 
In modern medical equipment signal transformation and detection is often done digitally. 
Increasingly the detected signal is intensively processed to extract the information which 
represents the required measurement. 
4.2.5. Backend Circuits 
Backend circuits provide analysis, display and interpretation. Traditionally the most common 
form of display was a paper chart recorder, although this has largely been replaced by Cathode 
Ray Tube (CRT) displays. However, most equipment manufactured within the last decade has 
incorporated computer generated displays and there is now a move from CRTs to Liquid 
Crystal Display (LCD) technology. 
4.2.6. Future Developments 
The future may see computerised physiological measurement instrumentation developed that 
is part of an 'Expert System'. That is a system which mimics the decisions and experience of 
a skilled physician, which may well 'make decisions' to alter treatment and implement them. 
Chapter 7 provides a further description of their application in medicine. 
4.2.7. Amplification 
Elsewhere in this chapter, we quantify the signal levels seen when measuring biopotentials 
such as in either Electrocardiography (ECG) or Electroencephalography (EEG) measurement 

78 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
systems. The signals involved were between a few V and several mV. The impedance required 
of the measurement system had to be sufficiently high as not to degrade the signals of interest. 
The bandwidth of the signals in which we were interested was, however, limited. 
The system gain required in order to drive either a CRT display or the motors used in a paper 
recorder must generate several volts from a relatively low impedance source. Gains of 
between 103 and 106 are therefore required. More exacting is the source impedance require- 
ment which must be coupled with the need to provide safe isolation of the signals. The input 
impedance of the amplifiers may need to be between 106 and 109f~. This level of impedance 
coupled with the need to measure very low bandwidth signals leads to the use of either 
MOSFET or chopper stabilised amplifiers. 
The main problem associated with high gain directly coupled amplifiers is that they are 
inherently liable to amplify equally both the required signal and any instabilities that may be 
present in their first stage. The instabilities are primarily due to the effects of thermal drift of 
their first stage components. As an alternative to DC coupling, chopper stabilised amplifiers 
are used in which the signal to be amplified is sampled at the chopper's frequency, and the 
sampled frequency is itself multiplied by an AC coupled amplifier which does not feed 
forward the drift from each stage of the amplifier. An outline of the chopping process is shown 
in Figure 4.3 below.

4.2.8. Filtering 
The signals obtained from biopotential measurements are frequently very specific in their 
form and of limited bandwidth. Whilst the DC component itself carries no information and is 
of little interest, we are often interested in low frequency signals. Additionally, the source 
impedance, as we noted in the last section is often high and the leads connecting small signals 
between the patient and measurement apparatus are necessarily long. They are therefore 
susceptible to both capacitive and magnetic pickup of electrical noise. A major source of 
electrical noise is often the power supply at a frequency of 50 or 60 Hz. There are also noise 
sources operating at radio frequency, such as electro surgical apparatus, communication 
equipment and radiated noise from switching equipment including power supplies. 
Filters used in modem circuits almost always rely on the use of operational amplifiers as 
active components. The use of amplifiers obviates the need for the use of inductors, so that 
accurate filtering characteristics may be obtained with RC circuits which do not suffer from 

Physiological Instrumentation 
79 
manufacturing difficulties. They also typically have low output impedances from each 
filtering stage which permits their use in tandem without coupling between separate filtering 
elements. 
Unwanted signals may be removed from the required information to a large extent by 
selectively amplifying only the frequencies in which we are interested. Filters, however, vary 
in their types and complexity. Simple filters remove eitherhigh frequencies, low frequencies 
or pass only a range of frequencies, as illustrated in Figure 4.4: they are termed low pass, high 
pass and ban@ass filters respectively. 
The slope of a filter's characteristic attenuation as a function of frequency is controlled by the 
order of the filtering process. High order filters, whilst they provide sharp cut off, suffer from 
uneven transmission characteristics in their pass band.

80 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Filters may either be implemented as analogue circuits or they can be built using digital 
components which analyse the frequency components of a digitised signal directly in the 
frequency domain and produce the desired cut off characteristic. The output of a digital filter 
may require to be reconstructed into its analogue form for later display. 
4.2.9. Differentiation and Integration 
Certain signals may require to be interpreted by either differentiation to examine their rate of 
change or be integrated, for instance to reduce certain noise characteristics. Both of these 
functions may be undertaken by analogue electronic circuits. 
The integration process uses a circuit of the form shown in Figure 4.5. In this circuit the 
integrating element is effectively the capacitor. The capacitor is charged by the current which 
is fed through the resistor. The amplifier's inverting input is a virtual earth, so the current 
flowing through the resistor in this configuration is independent of the voltage across the 
capacitor. The errors in this circuit are due to several factors. Firstly, the amplifier has a finite 
bias current which discharges the capacitor. Secondly, the capacitor has a leakage current, and 
finally there is a dependence on the amplifier's thermal drift which is exhibited as a change in 
its input offset voltage. The input offset voltage is the voltage required between its input 
terminals to maintain a zero output voltage.

4,2.10. Analogue to Digital and Digital to Analogue Converters 
Analogue to Digital conveners accept an input signal usually in the form of voltage and 
produce a digital output which represents the analogue signal. These converters are either 
single integrated circuits or hybrid circuits. However, their implementation is independent of 
their circuit configuration. 

Physiological Instrumentation 81 
A conversion process must be undertaken if signals are either to be stored or processed by 
computers. The representation of signals in a digital form also permits their transmission 
through systems in which there would otherwise be serious concern about signal distortion or 
deterioration. This is particularly important in a medical environment as we frequently 
require to provide electrical isolation between measurement and processing circuits for 
patient safety. The normal forms of coupling circuit are either transformer or optically based. 
Transformer based circuits are normally difficult to build with adequate accuracy and are 
therefore expensive. Optical coupling methods do not readily lend themselves to the direct 
transmission of analogue signals as their transfer characteristics are normally far from linear. 
Both of these isolation methods may be used to transfer digital information where either non- 
linearity or the introduction of noise do not immediately compromise the signal accuracy. 
The inverse conversion process clearly does not present us with these problems as it simply 
requires us to restore a digital representation of a signal into its analogue form. 
4.2.10.1. Sampling Frequency or the Nyquist Rate 
Several major factors characterise the digitisation process. Firstly, we note that if a signal is to 
be completely eharaeterised by sampling, then the sampling must be carried out at a rate 
which is sufficient not to cause the loss of information. This rate, called the Nyquist Rate, is 
twice the maximum frequency contained in the signal. If sampling is carried out at a lower 
rate, then the sampled signal contains information derived from signals at above the fre- 
quency for which the sampling Was valid, and permits them to be represented in effect as 
lower frequency signals. If the sampled signal's frequency spectrum is then analysed for its 
frequency components, it may reasonably contain only frequencies up to half the value of its 
Nyquist Frequency. The components of the signal at higher frequencies will still be repre- 
sented there as energy, though their energy will falsely be indicated as lying within the 
permitted band. This error process is known as Aliasing. A mathematical presentation of the 
sampling process is given by Bracewell (1986). 
4.2.10.2. Quantisation Error 
A further error in the sampling process is in converting the sampled signal from its analogue 
samples into the numbers required for representation in a digital form. Any converter has a 
limited precision and a limited range of voltages which it may represent. When you specify an 
analogue to digital converter for use in an application, you will firstly need to note the voltage 
range of the signal in which you are interested and match this, possibly by using amplifiers, to 
the available converters. Secondly, you will be conc~m~ to ensure that the conversion of the 
signal to a digital form does not lose required information. Clearly there is little purpose in 
attempting to discriminate between signal levels which am separated by less than the noise 
level in the signal you are measuring. However, conventional converters normally provide for 
conversions on a linear scale so the precision of measurement is greater for large signals than 
smaller ones. You will require a conversion process that caters adequately in terms of the 
precision of all signals in which you are interested. To achieve an adequate dynamic range for 
the conversion process may require you to use additional circuits which alter the gain of a 
preamplification stage and provide separate indication of the scale factor employed separately 
to a data acquisition process. In all cases, the 'quantisation error' introduced by the digitisation 
process is equivalent to the voltage represented by half of the least significant bit of the 
converter. 

82 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
4.2.10.3. Types of Converter 
Several types of circuit exist for both digital to analogue and analogue to digital conversion. 
Digital to analogue converters are normally relatively simple devices in which each bit of the 
digital signal is used to control whether a reference voltage is applied to a resistor. The value 
of the resistor is chosen to correspond with the magnitude of the bit with which it is 
concerned: the current which flows in each resistor is therefore dependent on the applied 
digital signal. The currents may therefore be summed and amplified by an operational 
amplifier to generate a voltage which represents the number presented to the converter. The 
performance of the converter is controlled by the precision of the components used, and in 
particular their susceptibilities to thermal drift. The speed of the conversion process is 
controlled by the device's switching time, the settling time of the amplifier to an impulse and 
the capacitance of its input stage. 
Analogue to digital conveners come in a greater variety, depending on their application. A 
simple way to build a converter is to use a digital to analogue converter, a clock and control 
logic. This is shown in Figure 4.6. The major drawback in this case is that the conversion time 
is controlled by the clock rate, whose period must be greater than the converter's settling time 
times the precision of the conversion process. There are several variants on this arrangement 
which at the expense of additional circuit complexity accelerate the conversion time from that 
obtained by the simple process. The most straightforward of these uses the successive 
approximation technique in which attempts are made to estimate the magnitude of the 
analogue signal starting at the most significant bit of the converter. Each bit of the converter in 
turn is tested and the output is compared with the analogue signal. The bit is left set after the 
test if the generated signal remains below the level of the analogue signal. This conversion 
process can be carried out at each level at approximately the settling time of the converter, 
yielding a total conversion time of 
Setting time • number of levels 
To obtain very high conversion rates it is possible to convert all bits in parallel using high 
speed precision comparators together with a precision resistor network. The arrangement is 
shown in Figure 4.6. Whilst this method allows for the conversion of signals at many MHz, its 
complexity increases quickly with additional precision and places ever greater demands on 
component accuracy. 
4.3. Transducers 
4.3.1. Types of Transducers 
The most useful form of transducer is one which converts energy to an electrical signal as this 
can be readily used and processed. Thus a thermocouple is more useful in instrumentation 
than a mercury in glass thermometer as the signal it produces is electrical and can be readily 
interfaced to other circuits for interpretation, display and recording. 
Some transducers are used in a rather indirect manner. For example a displacement measure- 
ment transducer maybe used to measure pressure. In this case a membrane is exposed to a 
pressure difference and its deformation is measured by a potentiometer.

Some measurements are made by active intervention to obtain a signal. As an example 
injecting a small quantity of ice cold saline into the blood stream enables measurement of 
flow in the circulation system. Monitoring the temperature change at a point downstream 
determines the flow rate. 

84 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Transducers vary greatly in complexity. Modern transducers may be complicated semi- 
conductor devices which respond to chemical changes. Transducers should be designed to 
offer high reliability if their performance is safety critical. 
4.3.2. Desired Attributes of a Measurement System 
1. The amount of energy removed from a system by a measurement should be small. All 
systems are changed when a measurement is performed. A thermometer needs a finite 
amount of energy, in the form of heat, to function. 
2. The system should be sensitive only to the desired signal. For example, ECG measure- 
ments should be sensitive to contractions of the heart and not to those of other muscles. 
3. The measurement should be minimally invasive: the transducer should cause as little 
damage as possible. 
4.4. Biopotentials 
As we saw in Chapter 2, the depolarisation of muscles and nerves, which respectively cause 
contraction and the passage of information, is associated with the movement of chemicals 
across a semi-permeable membrane. This ionic movement causes the generation of an action 
potential. If two electrodes are placed near to an excitable cell then when the ceU is 
depolarised a potential is developed between the two electrodes. Biopotential recording 
effectively measures the potential produced by cell depolarisation or the electrical activity of 
nerves and muscles. Essentially, cell membrane depolarisation is identical in nerves and 
muscles. The amplitude of the response is far greater in muscles: it is in the order of 1000 
times greater from heart muscle contraction than through a neural nerve impulse. 
The measurement of muscle contraction through the measurement of potential changes is 
called Electromyography (EMG), the measurement of the contraction of the heart, which can 
be viewed as a special type of muscle, is called Electrocardiography (ECG) and the measure- 
ment of nerve activity within the brain is termed Electroencephalography (EEG). 
4.4.1. Biopotential Recording Systems 
A block diagram of a typical biopotential recording system is shown in Figure 4.7. 
To perform a biopotential recording, electrodes or leads are attached to the patient and then 
connected to a high gain differential amplifier with good common mode rejection. The 
resulting signal is then displayed. The system also incorporates low pass filtering of the 
signals and perhaps notch filtering at the mains supply frequency. As biopotential recording 
necessitates that a low impedance connection is made to the patient, patient safety has to be 
assured. This is achieved by isolating the pre-amplifier stages. 
We are surrounded by power lines and equipment operating from a mains supply. This is 
particularly true in hospitals where much equipment is gathered together. Power lines operate 
typically at levels of hundreds of volts. The patient standing in a room in Figure 4.8 is 
capacitively coupled to the power lines. A biopotential measurement, such as an ECG, is then 
susceptible to a significant signal due to this coupling. As the biopotential is of the order of 
ImV the capacitive interference may completely mask the biopotential signal. Early

measurement systems were employed only in screened rooms in hospitals, and the recording 
equipment was battery operated. Now differential amplifiers which reject common mode 
signals facilitate this type of measurement in the presence of large interference signals. 
Capacitive coupling of the power lines causes a signal at the first electrode which with respect 
to the common ground will be approximately the same as the signal at the second electrode. 
The differential amplifier amplifies the difference between the signals at the two electrodes. 
The ECG signal measured at one electrode is out of phase with the potential measured at the 
other electrode and therefore the difference signal is amplified. Hence the noise and power 
supply coupling arc common to both electrodes and are therefore rejected. The ECG signal is 
different at the electrodes and therefore amplified. The ratio of the amplification of the 
required differential signal to the amplification of common mode signal is termed the 
common mode rejection ratio. For biopotential recording a high common mode rejection ratio 
is required. The common mode rejection ratio for biopotential recording apparatus is nor- 
madly between 80 and 120 dB for ECG and EEG measurements. The impedance of the 
amplifier must be large so that the biopotential is developed across the input of the amplifier 
and not across the patient electrode interface. The input impedance is typically in excess of 5 M.Q.

Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
The amplifier shown in the Figure 4.8 is referred to ground: this used to be a common 
configuration. As ground referenced equipment incorporates a conduction path to ground, the 
patient is at risk of electric shock in the event of a fault from the biopotential amplifier, other 
medical instrumentation or from ancillary equipment such as lighting and radios. Therefore 
modern biopotential amplifiers are constructed with isolated differential input sections and 
earth-free patient connections. 
The leads from biopotential measurement equipment form a loop which potentially generates 
a current in the presence of a varying magnetic field. To reduce this effect the leads to a 
biopotential recording machine are twisted and screened. 
A patient's skin resistance can vary between 10(~ and 2 Mf~, depending on its condition. The 
resistance of thick are.as of skin, like the soles of the feet, is higher than the resistance of upper 
parts of the body. Skin resistance is highly affected by moisture and, if the patient perspires, 
the resistance at the point of measurement will decrease drastically. The change in skin 
resistance with perspiration is made use of in the lie detector, where sudden changes in 
perspiration cause a drop in resistance, which is an indication of the patient's stress. Addition- 
ally, the patient's skin contains mineral salts. Therefore, to maintain a standardised low 
impeMance interface with the patient, electrodes with a metal salt solution are used. This 
ensures that the skin is moist and the resistance stable and low. The metal salt sets up an 
ionically stable interface. If bare copper wires were used oxygen would be liberated at the 
electrode. With a silver chloride electrode, a balance redox reaction is maintained between 
chlorine and silver ions. 
The epidermis is a semi-permeable membrane, so if a silver chloride electrode is placed upon 
the skin, chloride and silver ions can permeate the membrane. Thus a potential difference may 
be develope~ across the epidermis. Therefore, to prevent this happening, a patient's skin is 
prepared by rubbing it with an abrasive compound to strip the surface and stop a potential 
being set up across the semi-permeable membrane. A schematic of an electrode is shown in 
Figure 4.9. Any movement of the electrode on the skin potentially causes signals to be 
generated. Therefore, the electrode is designed to maintain an even flat contact under which 
no movement will take place. 
Figure 4.9 Biopotential electrodes 

Physiological Instrumentation 
87 
In addition to the electrodes described above, implantable electrodes are sometimes used. 
These employ a needle with electrodes mounted at its tip. The skin's resistance is broken and 
therefore the amplitude of the signal received is larger than that from surface electrodes. The 
use of transcutaneous needle electrodes also allows measurement near to the desired excitable 
cell. For instance, if a signal is required to be detected from a muscle fibre in the biceps the 
needle electrode can be placed in that muscle group. Surface electrodes detect an average 
signal originating from a large volume of the patient whilst needle electrodes record from a 
specific small volume around the needle tip. 
4.4.2. ECG 
The assessment of the functional behaviour of the heart by measurement of the potentials 
associated with cardiac muscle contraction is perhaps the most widely recognised biopotential 
recording. 
The human heart can be considered as a large muscle whose beating is simply muscular 
contraction. Therefore contractions of the heart cause a potential to be developed. The 
measurement of the potential produced by cardiac muscle is called electrocardiology. 
The depolarising field in the heart is a vector which alters its direction and magnitude through 
the cardiac cycle. The placement of the electrodes on the surface of a patient determines the 
view which will be obtained of that vector as a function of time. The most commonly used 
electrode placement scheme is shown in Figure 4.10. Here the differential potential is 
measured between the fight and left ann, between the right ann and the left leg and between 
left arm and left leg. These three measurements are referred to as leads I, II, HI respectively. 
This measurement lead placement was developed by Einthoven who stated that through 
measurement of lead I and lead II the signal seen at lead HI could be calculated. This is the 
most basic form of ECG lead placement: from this the various features of the heart's 
depolarisation can be calculated. Clinically there is a range of lead placement schemes which 
incorporate limb leads and chest leads. 
The heart consists of four chambers as we saw in Chapter 2, two atria and two ventricles. The 
atria contract together to force blood into the ventricles and then the ventricles contract. 
A typical ECG trace is shown in Figure 4.11; the peaks and troughs of the waveform are 
labelled in accordance with normal medical practice. The first positive peak, the P wave,

originates from the depolarisation of the atria. Following this there is a negative wave caused 
by the repolarisation of the atria. However, this waveform is usually masked by the depolari- 
sation of the ventricles shown as the Q R S complex in Figure 4.11. The repolarisation of the 
ventricles causes the positive wave labelled T. 
Therefore the ECG waveform shows the clinician the electrical waveforms associated with 
the contraction of the atria and ventricles. From an ECG a clinician may determine the relative 
timing of the contractions of the atria and the ventricles and assess the relative amplitude of 
the atrial and ventricular depolarisation and repolarisation. This information may allow the 
identification of mild heart block. Following a heart attack a patient's ECG shows changes as 
the timing and shape of the waveform are dependent on the transmission of the waveform 
through the muscle tissue. This changes with ischaemic muscle damage associated with heart 
attacks. 
4.4.3. EMG 
ECG measurement is the recording of the potential produced by cardiac muscle. Electromy- 
ography is the recording of the electrical activity of muscle: therefore ECG measurement is a 
type of EMG recording. EMG measurements are taken with essentially the same apparatus as 
is used for ECG measurement. However, in the majority of cases the signals received are 
smaller than those obtained in ECG recording as fewer muscle fibres are involved. The size of 
an EMG signal is directly related to the number of muscle fibres excited. 
Clinically EMG is used to determine the function of muscle groups following trauma. It may 
also be used to assess muscle function following suspected neurological damage. EMG 
signals are larger than the signals associated with nerve depolarisation. EMG is therefore used 
to detect the arrival of motor nerve information, that is sensing the contraction of a muscle 
group following its excitation (see section 4.4.5.3). 

Physiological Instrumentation 
89 
4.4.4. EEG 
Electroencephalography or EEG is the measurement of neural activity within the brain. Each 
neurone in the brain receives and transmits information through the depolarisation of its cell 
body sending an action potential along the nerve fibre. Within the human brain there is 
continuous activity and therefore continuous depolarisation and re-polarisation of neurones. 
This results in the continuous generation of electrical signals. These signals can be detected 
by electrodes placed on the scalp (see Figure 4.12). The measurement can be performed with 
instrumentation similar to that used for ECG measurement but with higher gain and common 
mode rejection. Signals are much smaller than ECG signals with an approximate amplitude of 
2 ~tV. Usually surface electrodes are used of similar construction to ECG electrodes, with the 
metal-electrolyte interface being silver / silver chloride. During operations, needle electrodes 
may be implanted into various parts of the brain. This has allowed researchers to quantify 
which parts of the brain control which bodily functions. 
We are continuously thinking and, therefore, EEG signals appear much like electrical noise. 
In certain circumstances, the brain waves or EEG signal may have characteristics which can 
be identified. If a person is relaxed with the eyes closed lying in a prone position, the brain 
waves form into a regular low frequency amplitude modulated wave form characterised as an 
'Alpha wave' (see Figure 4.12). This occurs more readily in men than in women. The 
bandwidth of the signals is approximately 10 Hz. 'Beta waves' are classified as waveforms 
between 18 and 30 Hz. EEG is used in studying patterns of brain action during sleep to enable 
the quantification of a patient's sleep into classes such as rapid eye movement (R 
approximately 30 second bursts of 8-12 Hz) and 'deep sleep' (frequencies of less than 4 Hz). 
During operations brain activity measured by EEG has been used to detect low oxygen and 
high carbon dioxide levels. Signals may also be recorded from electrodes implanted in the 
brain to assess the level of damage to a particular region. 
A clinical use of EEG is in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Epilepsy is usually suffered by people 
during puberty or adolescence and may be triggered by fever or flashing lights. The EEG 
signals recorded during a fit are of higher frequency than normal. During an epileptic fit, EEG 
can be used to categorise the seizure as grand-mal or petit-real as the characteristic EEG 
patterns in each case are different.

Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
4.4.5. Evoked Response Potentials 
If you are sitting in a dark room, and suddenly there is a flash of light, then a signal is sent to 
the sensory cortex of your brain along the optic nerve. If your EEG is recorded then a small 
impulse is recorded, corresponding to the sensory cortex receiving the optical stimulation 
signal. In this instance the EEG electrodes are placed over the part of the skull above the 
visual cortex. This maximises the signal received from this area. However, much of the signal 
recorded is due to other stimuli and impossible to distinguish from the specific visual 
stimulus. However, if the light in the room flashed a number of times, and each time the EEG 
waveform was recorded, averaging the recorded waveform would diminish signals uncorrelated 
with the visual event. In this way, if a patient experiences a visual stimulation and the EEG is 
measured, background interference or neural activity can be removed to leave a signal 
corresponding to the receipt by the visual cortex of the signal along the optic nerve from the 
eye. The resulting signal is called a visually evoked response potential. 
The EEG signal needs to be captured after triggering by the flash or visual signal. The visual 
signal may be a simple light flash, a change of pattern on a checkerboard display or a complex 
video picture. Usually more than 64 individual signals need to be averaged to obtain an adequate 
display. However, to discriminate the signal properly, about 200 or 300 visual signals need to 
be applied. To avoid cyclic events in the activity of the brain becoming correlated with the 
sensory signal, the signal is applied with a random time spacing between impulses. 
Visual evoked response potentials have been used to try to determine the way in which the 
visual cortex processes information. However, the most common application of visual evoked 
response potentials is in the assessment of the reception of visual signals when patients are 
either unto-operative or unable to communicate. Visually evoked responses are therefore 
used to assess babies' sight. Visually evoked response potentials may help to distinguish 
between physical disability and malingering. 
During brain surgery the optic nerve may be stimulated by flashing a light into the patient's 
eye by mounting LEDs to the patient's eye lid. The signals are recorded from inside the brain 
using needle electrodes. If the surgeon cuts close to the optic nerve, the nerve shocks and 
stops transmitting signals and therefore the EEG signal disappears. The surgeon then knows 
that the cut is close to the optic nerve. 
4.4.5.1. Auditory Evoked Response Potentials 
In the same manner that a patient's visual sensory system may be stimulated with a flash, a 
patient's aural system may be stimulated with a noise. The patient is either stimulated with a 
click or a tone burst (a sine wave of finite duration). The patient's brain activity is recorded 
using an EEG and, as with the visual sensory system, a number of EEG waveforms are 
recorded correlated with tone bursts or clicks. 
The auditory signal may be applied to the patient using either earphones, headphones or 
loudspeakers. Due to the amplitude of the EEG signals (approximately 2 ~tV) loudspeakers 
are sometimes preferred. Owing to their greater separation from the point of measurement, 
they produce less electromagnetically induced coupling from the moving coil into the 
biopotential recording apparatus than do headphones. As with visual evoked response potentials, 
auditory evoked response potentials are used to assess industrial injury claims and suspected 
malingerers. They are also useful if the patient is too young or too psychologically impaired to 
communicate. 

Physiological Instrumentation 
91 
4.4.5.2. Sumato Sensory Evoked Response Potentials 
The third main sensory system that we have after sight and sound is our peripheral nervous 
system. The nerves are concentrated in areas such as our hands and feet. They respond to pain, 
pressure and temperature. If they are stimulated a signal is passed from a peripheral nerve to 
our spinal column and hence to our brain. Therefore, if a patient's limb is excited and the EEG 
measured an impulse may be obtained in the same manner as for visual and auditory response 
potentials. However, the sumato sensory response potentials signals may be recorded at many 
places along the route. If, for example, a patient's hand is stimulated, the sensory nervous 
signal may be detected at points on the patient's forearm, shoulder and where the nerve enters 
the spine, as well as being detected in the EEG waveform. Sumato sensory evoked response 
potentials can be used to determine the extent of sensory sensation that a patient has in a limb 
or other part of the body. This may be particularly useful following a trauma such as a motor 
cycle accident, where the patient's nervous system may be shocked so that it blocks all 
signals. The patient may then be unable to feel anything from a hand or arm. Using sumato 
sensory response potentials the integrity in the nerve pathway can be assessed. 
4.4.5.3. Measurement of Peripheral Nerve Velocity 
The nerves which control the movement of a limb are called motor nerves. The nerve 
travelling down next to the ulna (one of the bones in the forearm) is called the ulna nerve. This 
nerve may be stimulated at a point close to the elbow as the nerve is close to the surface (see 
Figure 4.13). Using electrodes of essentially the same type as those used for ECG measure- 
merits, a current may be passed between the two electrodes through the patient. This excites

the nerve by depolarising its membrane and causing an action potential to be transmitted. The 
action potential travels along the nerve to a synapse, a junction between the nerve and muscle, 
in the thumb. An EMG then measures the electrical signal associated with the contraction of 
the muscle in the thumb. The time between nerve excitation and the muscle response as 
determined by the EMG is recorded as the latency. If the point of excitation is moved towards 
the wrist and the nerve excited again and the latency recorded as before, the difference 
between the two latencies corresponds to the time it takes for the nerve impulse to travel the 
distance between the two excitation points. In this way the peripheral nerve velocity can be 
measured. Measurement of peripheral nerve velocity may be useful in determining the extent 
of nervous damage following trauma. 
4.4.5.4. Excitation of Nerves or Muscles 
As we saw in Chapter 2, nerves and muscles are excitable cells. This means that their 
membranes' permeability changes if they are excited beyond a certain threshold. In a nerve, if 
a membrane is excited, then an action potential travels through the nerve and transmits 
information from one point to another. In a muscle, the travelling action potential causes a 
release of chemicals, which cause the contraction of the muscle. However, in both cases, the 
progression of information or the contraction of muscle is initiated by a change in membrane 
permeability. Change in membrane permeability can be measured using ECG, EMG or EEG 
methods as it is associated with a change in potential difference. Likewise, if a current passes 
through the semi-permeable membrane of a nerve or muscle, then an action potential can be 
generated. Thus the passage of current through the nervous tissue such as a muscle or a nerve, 
stimulates the tissue. Nerves and muscles may be electrically stimulated by placing electrodes 
on the skin and passing a current between them. The patient's skin is usually prepared in the 
same manner as for ECG electrodes and the electrodes are essentially the same as for that 
measurement. Electrical excitation of nerves and muscles can be extremely painful for the 
patient. 
The duration of the nerve impulse is small. Potentials of up to 200 V may be used to generate 
the required current. Constant current sources are used rather than constant voltage as it is the 
passage of current through the nerve which causes its depolarisation. As with measurement of 
EMG or recording from peripheral nerves, needle electrodes may be used for stimulation. A 
small area, a particular nerve or muscle fibre group may be excited more accurately than with 
a surface electrode. 
When recording or stimulating, surface electrodes pick up an average signal from a large 
tissue area, corresponding to a large group of nerves or muscles, whereas needle electrodes 
either excite or record from a small area or group of fibres. 
4.4.5.5. Electrical Activity of the Heart 
The heart is essentially a large muscular bag, which beats continually to pump blood around 
our bodies. The heart consists of four chambers. The two atria contract simultaneously, as do 
the two ventricles. The rate at which a heart beats is determined by the Sino Atrial node or SA 
node. A depolarisation pulse originating here spreads through both atria, causing contraction, 
and then spreads on to the AV node or Atrio Ventricular node. Depolarisation passing through 
the atria does not spread to the ventricles except by the pathway through the AV node. When 
the depolarisation pulse reaches the AV node it is delayed before passing to stimulate the 
ventricles. This allows ventricles maximally to fill with blood from the atria. The pulses then 

Physiological Instrumentation 
93 
spread through the ventricles, causing their depolarisation and subsequent contraction. Thus 
the atria and the ventricles contract in a co-ordinated fashion. The rate at which the SA node 
stimulates the atria is determined by the para-sympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems 
as described in Chapter 2. 
The SA node is the heart's natural pacemaker as it determines the rate at which the heart beats. 
Heart block is the condition where the electrical connection between the atria and the 
ventricles has been damaged, so that depolarisation does not spread to the ventricles. In this 
instance, the atria beat at a rate determined by the SA node and governed by the body's 
sympathetic and para-sympathetic systems. However, the ventricular contraction is uncoordi- 
nated with the contraction of atria. The ventricles then beat at a rate of around about 40 beats 
per minute. Even though this beating is uncoordinated with the atrial contraction, the 
ventricular contraction is sufficient to supply a life sustaining flow of blood throughout the 
patient's body. However, the patient will have very little energy and may faint and lose 
consciousness. 
4.4.6. Pacemakers 
A pacemaker is a device which takes over the timing control of the ventricular contraction 
from the body's natural system to ensure a rate fast enough to allow an active life for the 
patient. Pacemakers basically consist of a battery, a timing device and electrodes. The battery 
must be capable of supplying enough current to stimulate or excite the muscles in the 
ventricles and perhaps the atria for a number of years. As the heart beats approximately 70 
times per minute, the battery life must be able to provide stimulation of 70 x 60 x 24 x 365 x 
the number of years it will survive. Therefore, the requirements for the battery are quite strict. 
Battery life is expected to be in the range of 3 - 10 years. Usually 4 to 6 volt pulses are used to 
excite the heart with a duration of between 1.5 and 2.5 milliseconds. The electrical connection 
is made from the pacemaker to the patient's heart by leads. These must be rigorously designed 
as they must withstand a large number of contractions which result in flexing throughout their 
lifetime. The electrodes are either implanted in the heart or stitched to the surface of the heart. 
As a temporary measure, electrodes may be floated into the ventricles of the heart in the same 
way as a catheter is introduced during blood pressure measurement. The pacemaker itself is 
situated underneath muscle in the chest. The devices are about half the size of an audio 
cassette. 
The third main block of a pacemaker is the timing device, which regulates when or if the 
patient's heart is excited. The first type of pacemaker was based around an asynchronous 
mode timer (see Figure 4.14). This constantly excites the patient's heart at a rate determined 
by the surgeon, but is approximately 70 beats per minute. The units are a simple design and 
therefore basic and cheap, but they suffered from an intrinsic problem. Since the ventricles 
sometimes spontaneously contract, if the pacemaker excites ventricles after their contraction, 
the patient's heart could fibrillate. 
Ventricular Fibrillation is a mode of contraction in which the ventricles continue to be excited 
but in an uncoordinated fashion, causing the heart to flutter rather than to pump. In this state 
the patient receives no blood flow and therefore is in danger of dying. Once the patient's heart 
is in ventricular fibrillation, a large signal is required to depolarise the whole of the ventricles 
simultaneously to synchronise their depolarisation. Asynchronous mode pacemakers were 
associated with heart attacks due to the competition between the pacemaker and the natural, 
spontaneous contraction of the ventricles themselves. 

94 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Figure 4.14 Pacemakers 
The battery life of a pacemaker may be monitored non-invasively. Asynchronous pacemakers 
were designed so that their rate would drop as the battery level fell. For example, when the 
batteries were fully charged the rate of the pacemaker may have been 70.9 beats per minute, 
whereas two to three years later, when the battery power dropped, it may have dropped to 
70.1. In this way the patient's general practitioner could monitor the battery life of the 
pacemaker non-invasively during a normal clinic. 
A more sophisticated type of pacemaker is the Demand Mode pacemaker (see Figure 4.14). 
This type incorporates detection circuitry. Either separate leads, or those used to excite the 
ventricles, determine whether the ventricles have contracted. The pacemaker excites the 
patient's heart if the heart itself has not spontaneously contracted after a predetermined 
period. Therefore, the demand mode pacemaker ensures a minimum heart rate but will not 
excite the patient's ventricles following a spontaneous contraction. 
The third and most sophisticated type of pacemaker is the Atrial Synchronisation pacemaker 
(see Figure 4.14). In this type of pacemaker, separate electrodes are used to detect the 

Physiological Instrumentation 
95 
contraction of the atria. The pacemaker introduces a small delay which models the delay in a 
healthy heart by the atrio ventricular node and then excites the ventricles. As with the demand 
mode pacemaker, the ventricles are not excited if spontaneous contraction occurs. However, 
in normal operation, contraction of the ventricles is synchronised with the contraction of the 
atria to ensure an efficient beating process. Since the excitation of the ventricles is determined 
by atrial contraction, itself controlled by the SA node, the body's own natural pacemaker, an 
atrial synchronisation pacemaker ensures that the patient's heart rate responds to the demands 
of the body. Thus if the patient is exercising, the body releases chemicals which cause the 
heart rate to rise. The rising rate of atrial contraction causes a corresponding rising rate of 
ventricular contraction, so a patient may lead a normal active life. 
Both the demand mode pacemaker and the atrial synchronised pacemaker offer improved 
performance and reduce the likelihood of patients suffering from ventricular fibrillation due 
to mistimed excitation pulses. However, both these types of pacemaker can suffer in the 
presence of noise. The reader will be aware that in the entrance to many libraries and some 
shops there are signs saying that people wearing pacemakers should contact the staff before 
entering the building. This is to avoid interference from electrical equipment disturbing the 
natural function of the pacemaker. Microwave ovens are another source of electrical interfer- 
ence which may disrupt pacemakers. 
The most advanced pacemakers sense the level of background interference and, if this is high, 
they fall back to an asynchronous mode operation, returning to their atrial synchronisation or 
demand mode when the noise level has dropped. 
4.5. Blood Pressure Measurement 
4.5.1. Medical Aspects of Blood Pressure Measurement 
The measurement of blood pressure is one of the checks that your doctor routinely performs. 
Problems with the cardio-vascular system are often mirrored by abnormal blood pressure 
readings. More specifically malfunction of the heart can be directly diagnosed from blood 
pressure measurement. In the hospital environment blood pressure is monitored during 
operations and continuously recorded in intensive care units. Measurements of blood pressure 
within the heart may provide information about the integrity of the heart valves. 
The normal resting patient will have a heart rate of approximately 70 beats per minute. Each 
stroke ejects about 70 r 3 of blood from the left ventricle into the aorta (main artery leaving 
the left ventricle). At the hiatus of each stroke the pressure within the arteries reaches a 
maximum and then declines during the rest of the cardiac cycle. The peak blood pressure is 
referred to as systolic whilst the minimum value is the diastolic. The normal patient will have 
a systolic blood pressure of approximately 120 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of 
approximately 80 mm Hg. 
The body's circulation can be divided into two circuits: the Systemic circuit and the Pulmo- 
nary circuit. The pressure in the systemic circuit is high as the blood leaves the heart however, 
having passed through the body the pressure in major veins is as little as 4 mm Hg. The 
pulmonary circuit operates at relatively low pressure as the function of the lungs is to 
exchange oxygen. Pulmonary circuit pressure has a systolic peak of 25 mm Hg and a diastolic 
value of 10 mm Hg. Therefore blood pressure is pulseatile and dependent on the point of 

96 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
measurement. Clinically the doctor is interested in the systolic and diastolic reading and also 
the average pressure. 
The heart rate is not directly related to the blood pressure as the impedance offered by the 
body is not constant. For example a sudden fright like finding that your alarm clock has 
broken on the morning of an exam will have a physiological effect known as the 'fight or 
flight' response. Following a sudden excitement the blood vessels near the skin's surface 
contract, therefore, reducing the flow of blood and minimising the blood loss from a superfi- 
cial wound. Blood is also diverted from circulating round the stomach and intestines and 
instead lies in enlarged arteries and veins. The composition of the blood also changes, 
increasing the clotting speed, with corresponding viscosity changes. Therefore, the blood 
pressure increases regardless of any change in the heart rate. Using the analogy of relating the 
blood pressure to voltage and the flow rate to current and the circulation system to impedance. 
The blood pressure is clearly dependent on the heart rate, the flow rate and the impedance 
characteristics of the circulation system. 
4.5.2. Sphygmomanometer Blood Pressure Measurement 
The Sphygmomanometer is the most common method of blood pressure measurement. As it 
is non invasive it can be performed by your General Practitioner. 
The measurement is performed by wrapping an inflatable cuff around a patient's upper arm. 
The cuff consists of a bag contained within a cloth sleeve and can be secured by a tie or velcro 
strap. The cuff is connected to a hand bulb pump and a mercury manometer. When the cuff is 
inflated, the pressure increases and the tissues in the patient's upper arm become compressed 
occluding blood flow in the brachial artery (see Figure 2.24a). The physician listens to the 
flow of blood at a point below the bag with a stethoscope. The pressure in the cuff is increased 
above the point where the blood stops flowing in the artery. 
Cuff pressure greater than diastolic and systolic. 
Therefore, there is no blood flow during the cardiac 
cycle. 
Cuff pressure greater than diastolic but less than 
systolic pressure. Therefore, blood flows during 
the systolic part of the cycle. 
Cuff pressure greater than diastolic and less than 
systolic pressure. Therefore, there is some blood 
flow during the entire cardiac cycle. However, 
there is still noise associated with turbulence. 
Cuff pressure less than systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure. Blood flows continuously. 
Figure 4.15 Sphygmomanometer cuff 

Physiological Instrumentation 
97 
The physician then gradually releases the pressure in the cuff; at a point when the pressure is 
equal to the systolic blood pressure blood begins to flow again. At this pressure blood squirts 
through the compressed artery during the systolic part of the cardiac cycle, but at the diastolic 
part of the cycle the artery closes again and no blood flows. Therefore, the artery opens and 
closes causing a characteristic knocking noise known as Korotkoff's sounds. At the point 
when these noises begin the clinician notes the manometer pressure as being equal to the 
systolic pressure. 
The pressure within the cuff is then further reduced and consequently the artery remains open 
for an increasing portion of the cardiac cycle. When the cuff pressure is equal to the diastolic 
pressure the artery remains open during the whole cycle and the noises stop. The physician 
will record this cuff pressure as the diastolic pressure. 
This method of measuring blood pressure suffers from several drawbacks. 
9 The measurement is subjective, that is to say it is dependent on the opinion of the clinician 
when the Korotkoff's sounds begin and end. 
9 The fidelity of the stethoscope used and of the hearing of the clinician directly control the 
measurement accuracy. 
The sphygmomanometer is therefore a relatively inaccurate subjective measurement of blood 
pressure. However, it is non invasive, easy to perform and the instrumentation required is 
cheap. This is the type of blood pressure measurement performed in the front line of medical 
practice, the fault finding level. Measurements with greater accuracy require invasive tech- 
niques. 
There is a number of different methods of determining the point at which blood begins to flow 
again other than detecting the Korotkoff sounds. As before, pressure in a cuff cuts off the 
blood flow. As pressure is decreased the blood flow resumes when the cuff pressure is 
approximately equal to the systolic pressure. This flow may be detected by a Doppler 
ultrasound blood flow detector (see Section 3.9.3). The Doppler device produces an audible 
output which is proportional to the blood flow velocity. 
A transducer may be used to measure vibrations in the cuff which recommence as the cuff 
pressure approximately equals the systolic blood pressure. The vibration in the cuff reaches a 
maximum at a point when the pressure in the cuff is equal to the average blood pressure, and 
decreases and disappears when the cuff pressure is equal to the diastolic pressure. 
Instruments which perform non invasive measurement of blood pressure have been devel- 
oped which use both the vibration principle and the detection of Korotkoff's sounds. In both 
cases the cuff is automatically inflated and the vibration signal detected by transducer located 
in the cuff. These machines provide measurements of the systolic, average and diastolic blood 
pressures. However, these machines perform badly in the presence of other vibration signals. 
4.5.3. Invasive Measurement of Blood Pressure. 
Invasive blood pressure measurement allows more accurate blood pressure measurement, 
dynamic measurement and measurement of pressure at specific points in the circulation 
system. 

98 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
4.5.3.1. Catheter Measurement 
Invasive measurement of blood pressure is routinely performed using a catheter transducer. 
An incision is made in the patient and a catheter is introduced into the circulation system. A 
catheter is an open ended tube used to couple the pressure inside the patient to an external 
transducer: in other circumstances catheters may be used for drug infusion or drainage. 
The catheter may be introduced into either the arterial or the venous system depending on the 
point at which the measurement is to be performed. The most common points of incision are 
in the neck, arm or groin, as these sites have large veins and arteries which are close to the 
skin's surface. 
The catheter is filled with saline solution and connected to an external pressure transducer 
(see Figure 4.16). The saline filled catheter transmits the pressure at the catheter tip to the 
external transducer. The housing of the pressure transducer allows the catheter to be regularly 
flushed with saline solution to prevent blood from clotting at the open end of the robe (clots in 
the circulation system can obstruct blood flow and cause brain damage or damage to lung 
function). The transducer housing also allows the connection of a reference pressure source to 
allow for calibration of the transducer. 
Once introduced into a blood vesselthe catheter can be fed along the vein or artery reaching 
deep locations in the circulation system such as the heart or major arteries. Therefore the 
catheter tube has to be very compliant to bend around the structures within the body. The 
requirement for compliance contradicts the tube's primary function of transmitting pressure 
to the external transducer. If the robe is flexible and compliant then the pressure changes 
which are being measured may extend the tube and consequently be distorted when they 
arrive at the transducer. A further problem with catheters is that foreign matter or bubbles 
Figure 4.16 Catheter blood pressure transducer 

Physiological Instrumentation 
99 
within the tube may also degrade performance. Bubbles within the catheter compress when 
pressure increases and distort the pressure measured at the transducer. These factors limit the 
dynamic performance (i.e. bandwidth) of the catheter tube blood pressure measuring system. 
The bandwidth of such a system may be as little as 12 Hz. 
However, the catheter system is relatively cheap, and the transducer is reusable and robust. 
4.5.3.2. Catheter Tip Transducer 
Another type of invasive blood pressure measuring system is the catheter tip blood pressure 
transducer. In this instance the transducer is mounted at the tip of a tube inserted into the 
patient and therefore directly measures the blood pressure at that point. The dynamic perform- 
anee of this system depends on the transdueer's bandwidth which may extend to as much as 1 
kHz. Hence this kind of measurement is preferred when measuring the wide bandwidth 
signals found in the aorta and within the heart, particularly if associated with valve abnormali- 
ties. The intravenous tip transducer may be a little less compliant than the catheter system. 
However, its major drawbacks are price and operating life. The design requirements to 
provide an ultra miniature transducer make this kind of instrument expensive and it is easily 
damaged both in normal use and accidentally. The transdueer's performance is also degraded 
by repeated sterilisation at high temperature. 
4.5.4. Design of Blood Pressure Transducers 
The type of transducer most commonly used in both catheter tube and intravenous blood 
pressure measurement systems is the strain gauge transducer. 
4.5.4.1. Strain Gauge Pressure Transducers 
If a wire is stretched the resistance measured between its ends increases due to a number of 
factors. The diameter of the wire decreases, the length of the wire increases and the resistivity 
increases. These three factors are related to the resistance of a wire by the equation given 
below. 
R = p/ 
A 
where A is the cross sectional area, I is the length of the conductor and p is the resistivity of 
the conductor. 
In most strain gauges the changes in dimension are the dominant reason for the measured 
change in the resistance of a wire under tension. For small strains (those with changes of 
dimension of about 2%) the change of resistance with strain is approximately linear. If a wire 
is connected between two points monitoring the resistance of the wire correlates with the 
strain it experiences. This type of strain gauge is referred to as an un-bonded strain gauge and 
is uncommon in transducers today. 
A bonded strain gauge consists of a plastic substrate upon which a layer of conducting 
material has been laid. The conducting material is laid out to maximise the length of the 
conductor in the direction of the required measurement. The bonded strmn gauge may be 
glued to a material such as a block of steel. Any strain experienced by the block will be passed 
on to the bonded element. Bonded strain gauges can be fabricated from a variety of materials. 

100 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
The temperature dependence of resistivity is possibly a limitation in the application of certain 
strain gauge transducers. 
In a pressure transducer a membrane separates the fluid under test from a fluid at a reference 
pressure (normally air at atmospheric pressure); if the pressure of the test fluid exceeds that of 
the reference fluid then the membrane distorts in the manner shown in the Figure 4.17a. There 
is therefore a strain in the membrane proportional to the membrane's displacement and thus 
the pressure difference. 
Figure 4.17 Transducer diaphragm 
Strain gauges are mounted directly to the reverse side of the membrane. The resistance change 
measured will be extremely small and so gauges are incorporated in a Wheatstone bridge 
circuit. To maximise the sensitivity of the transducer and also to reduce the effect of 
temperature changes four strain gauges are used in a full bridge configuration. The transducer 
mounted in the centre of the diaphragm (see Figure 4.17b) experiences tension during 
membrane distortion and the gauges at the rim experience compression. This may at first 
seem rather surprising that the rim gauges will experience compression but if the situation is 
examined closely as in Figure 4.17e, then the membrane at this point can be considered as a 
beam under load and the situation understood. 
Both catheter tip transducers and the comparatively large transducers used for catheter blood 
pressure measurement are constructed from a flexible diaphragm mounted with a swain bridge. 
There are other types of pressure transducer which use other physical properties such as the 
piezo electric effect, capacitive sensing of membrane displacement and optical fibre tech- 
niques. 

Physiological Instrumentation 
101 
4.5.4.2. Safety of Blood Pressure Transducers 
Blood pressure transducers are electrically hazardous as they penetrate the skin and therefore 
form a low impedance connection to the patient. The most susceptible organ to electrical 
accidents is the heart; this is measured directly by blood pressure transducers. The fluid filled 
catheter method establishes a conducting path to the heart and the intravenous transducer 
actually incorporates an electrical circuit within the patient's heart. On the other hand, the 
optical method may be completely isolated. For this reason optical transducer methods for 
blood pressure measurement may become popular. 
4.5.5. Measurement of Blood Pressure within the Heart 
(the Swan Ganz Catheter) 
In certain clinical conditions such as heart valve failure it is necessary to measure the blood 
pressure within the heart. This is achieved by introducing a catheter transducer into a vein or 
artery and feeding the catheter up against the flow. The patient is examined radiologically to 
determine the position of the catheter. If the catheter is introduced into an artery then it enters 
the left hand side of the heart. If the pressure transducer is introduced into a vein then it enters 
the right hand side of the heart. 
4.5.5.1. Heart Catheterisation 
To catheterise the fight hand side of the heart a catheter is introduced into a vein and fed 
against the direction of blood flow. The position of the catheter is monitored by X rays as it is 
radio opaque. The transducer emerges at the entrance to the fight atrium, and a pressure 
measurement may be taken at this point (see Figure 4.18). The transducer can then be pushed 
through and into the atrium where again a pressure measurement may be performed. Careful 
manipulation may then position the catheter in the ventricle and the pressure can likewise be 
measured at this point. The catheter cannot be manipulated into the pulmonary artery and so 
to take measurements there a balloon is inflated close to the end of the catheter which is 
Figure 4.18 Heart catheterisation 

102 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
carried by the blood flow through the pulmonary valve and into the artery. Once in the artery 
the balloon is deflated and the pulmonary artery pressure taken, With the catheter in this 
position it is also possible indirectly to measure the pressure within the left atrium. This is 
achieved by reinflating the balloon at the end of the catheter until blood flow in the artery 
stops. If there is no flow then the pressure within the pulmonary artery equals the pressure in 
the left ventricle as there is effectively a closed path. 
This special process is performed using a Swan Ganz catheter. In special care wards patients 
are intensively monitored. Therefore patients are catheterised and the blood pressure within 
their hearts is continuously monitored. In addition the flow rate through the heart can be 
assessed by thermal dilution. This method comprises injecting a small quantity of ice cold 
saline solution into the heart and monitoring the length of time for this temperature fluctuation 
to be passed to a further part of the circulation system. 
4.5.6. Measurement of Oxygen in the Blood 
The function of the cardio-vascular system is to pass blood through the lungs so that 
haemoglobin can combine with oxygen, which can then be carried around the body. The 
measurement of the amount of oxygen in medal blood is a direct measure of the performance 
of the cardio-vascular system in general. There are two clinically used methods of measuring 
the amount of oxygen in the blood: one relies on an optical measurement procedure, the other 
on a chemical reaction. 
4.5.6.1. The Oximeter 
Beer's Law relates the absorption of fight passing through a solution to the concentration of 
the solution, the optical path length and the absorption coefficient. If the concentration of a 
solution is doubled, the absorption doubles and likewise an increase in the path length causes 
a corresponding increase in the absorption. This relationship is exploited in oximeters to 
measure the amount of oxygen in blood. 
The active cells in blood which carry oxygen to tissue are haemoglobin. The spectral 
characteristic, the strength of absorption at a particular frequency, of haemoglobin changes 
when it is combined with oxygen. The spectral characteristics of oxygenated and deoxygen- 
ated haemoglobin are shown in Figure 4.19. The characteristic absorption functions cross at 
the isobestic point. At this point, the absorption of haemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin are 
equal - this wavelength is 803 nm. The spectral absorption characteristics of blood account for 
the difference in the appearance of arterial and venous blood. Arterial blood (predominantly 
oxyhaemoglobin) is red whilst venous return (haemoglobin) is blue. 
The oximeter determines the percentage oxygenation of haemoglobin as defined below. 
Oxyhaemoglobin 
P02 = Oxyhaemoglobin + haemoglobin 
A sample of arterial blood taken from the patient is placed in a cuvette. A cuvette is a small 
rectangular glass vessel with known optical properties. The measurement is performed by 
measuring the absorption at two wavelengths, namely at the isobestic point and at 605 nm. As 
the path length (the dimensions of the cuvette) and the absorption coefficient are known the

r 
measurement at 803 nm allows the calculation of the total concentration of haemoglobin in 
the sample. When this is combined with a measurement at 605 nm equations can be solved to 
yield the percentage of oxygenated haemoglobin. 
The advantage of this method of measuring the percentage saturation or the percentage 
oxygenated haemoglobin is that it is relatively easy to perform. The disadvantage is that a 
sample of blood has to be removed from the patient to perform the measurement. This means 
that it is relatively slow. 
4.5.6.2. Oxygen Association 
Oxygen in the blood is hold there in two states: 
1. Physically dissolved in the fluid. 
2. Combined with haemoglobin. 
Figure 4.20 shows the oxygen dissociation graph for blood. It shows on the abscissa the 
percentage of oxygen combined with haemoglobin whilst the ordinate shows the total oxygen 
in the blood. Initially the graph is relatively linear however, once the percentage of combined 
haemoglobin exceeds 80%, the graph levels off and a large increase in total oxygen correlates 
with a small change in percentage oxygenation. For instance, the 20% increase in the total 
oxygen from 8 Pa to I0 Pa on the graph is equivalent to a 2% change in the percentage 
oxygenation. Therefore, when using an oximeter, the percentage haemoglobin is a good judge 
of the amount of haemoglobin which is combined with oxygen. However, it does not directly

reflect the amount of oxygen in the blood; a small change, say from 98 to 96% in the 
haemoglobin concentration, can mask a change of 20% of the total oxygen within the blood. 
A further problem is that some diseases or conditions cause a change in blood pH. This affects 
the oxygen dissociation curve, shifting it to the left or fight, as shown in Figure 4.20. In these 
instances the relationship between the percentage oxygenation of the blood or the percentage 
oxyhaemoglobin to total oxygen in the blood is altered. Therefore, an oximeter measurement 
of blood oxygenation gives a good indication level of combined oxygen in the blood but not 
an accurate reading of the total oxygen present. Normally, the anaesthetist will expect a 
reading above 90% for the percentage saturation. 
A further point of interest is that blood is composed of haemoglobin and abnormal haemo- 
globin, which has different spectral properties to normal haemoglobin. This may render the 
calculation of percentage oxygenation inaccurate. An oximeter measurement may also be 
disturbed if the patient is suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning, as this will alter the 
spectral characteristics of the blood. 
4.5.6.3. The Pulse Oximeter 
Oximeters rely on taking samples of blood, and placing them in external containers so that 
optical characteristics can be determined. This method is therefore slow and quite difficult to 
perform during an operation. The pulse oximeter uses essentially the same theory as the 
oximeter, but is a non-invasive measurement which can give a continuous reading of the 
percentage oxygenation of the haemoglobin. 
A pulse oximeter takes a reading of the absorption for two wavelengths of light, as before, but 
through a portion of the patient's body containing arterial blood. The portions of the patient's 
body normally chosen are the oar lobe or the finger. A spring clip containing an optical source 
and detector is fastened around the patient's finger or ear lobe. The absorption through the 

Physiological Instrumentation 105 
patient is then dependent upon both the oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin within 
the ear or finger, the tissues within the ear or finger and the skin, and in addition, the 
absorption of venous blood in the pathway. The light source emits pulses of light at both 
frequencies of light used in the measurement. A reading is also taken when the light source is 
off to determine the background noise or 'dark reading'. The pulses are emitted continually 
and so the absorption is continuously monitored. Due to the pulsing of the arterial blood, 
absorption is not constant with time as shown in Figure 4.21. The relationship between the 
pulseatile component of the absorption and the percentage saturation of haemoglobin has 
been empirically determined. The pulse oximeter, therefore, performs a continuous in-vivo 
measurement of blood oxygen saturation. However, it suffers from the same limitations as the 
oximeter. 
Measurements performed by oximeters can also be widely affected by electrical interference. 
If a surgeon uses a diathermy in the operating theatre, then the pulse oximeter reading may be 
disrupted. 
Figure 4.21 Tissue absorption 
4.5.6.4. New Developments in Pulse Oximetry 
To overcome the interference which pulse oximeters experience from other electrical equip- 
ment in the operating theatre, pulse oximeters are being built with the optical source and 
detector housed in a screened instrument ease and the light fed to the patient by an optical 
fibre. A further modification to increase the accuracy of the calculation for measuring 
oxygenation is to include more than two wavelengths of light for measurement.

Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
4.5.6.5. Chemical Measurement of Blood, Gas Content 
The chemical oxygen sensor shown in Figure 4.22 can be used to measure the level of oxygen 
in a sample of blood or gas. The cell consists of two electrodes in a solution and a semi- 
permeable membrane. One of the electrodes is a silver / silver chloride electrode, whilst the 
other is platinum. The electrolyte within the cell is potassium chloride. The bottom of the cell 
is a semi-permeable membrane. There are two chemical reactions which can take place within 
the cell: one is silver combining with chlorine to form silver chloride and the other is oxygen 
combining with water to form hydroxyl ions. 
02 + 2H20+4e- --->40H- 
Ag + Cl- .-.-> AgCl + e- 
(1) 
The platinum electrode acts as a catalyst. The second reaction is oxygen dependent. For the 
water to dissociate to hydroxyl ions, oxygen needs to be present. The cell is operated by 
applying a potential of between 0.2 and 0.6 volts between the two electrodes. Initially, as the 
voltage is increased, the current increases between the two electrodes. However, it reaches a 
point when there is no increase in current with increased voltage. At this point the current that 
flows from,one electrode to the other is dependent on the rate of the reaction and therefore the 
amount of oxygen entering the cell. The Clark Cell has specially designed permeable 
membranes to allow measurement of oxygen in blood. The reaction rate in the cell is 
determined by the amount of oxygen crossing the semi-permeable membrane from the blood. 
The resulting current in the cell is proportional to the amount of oxygen in the blood. 
Figure 4.22 Chemical oxygen measurement 

Physiological Instrumentation 107 
This cell measures the total amount of oxygen in blood. The dissolved oxygen and that 
combined with both normal and abnormal haemoglobin are measured. However, the cell 
cannot be used non-invasively. Either a sample of blood must be removed from the patient 
and placed on the semi-permeable membrane, or the cell itself must be miniaturised so that it 
may be inserted into the patient. 
However, a cell has been designed using the same procedure as the Clark electrode for non- 
invasive blood oxygen measurement. This cell is placed on the patient's skin and the skin is 
heated. Heating the skin increases peripheral medal circulation and opens the capillary 
pathways. Therefore, using a semi-permeable membrane especially designed for skin contact, 
the rate of the reaction is controlled by oxygen diffusing through the patient's skin from the 
medal circulation into the cell. In this way the cell earl be used to measure in-vivo oxygen 
concentration of blood. 
4,5.6.6. Gaseous Oxygen Measurement 
A further measurement of the eardio-vaseular system can be obtained by measuring the 
oxygen inhaled and exhaled by the patient. Oxygen is a paramagnetic substance. Therefore, 
the presence of oxygen increases a magnetic field. Diamagnetic materials experience a force 
in a non-uniform field. The gaseous-pararnagnetic oxygen analyser uses these two phenom- 
ena to measure the amount of oxygen in a sample of air. 
The instrument is fabricated with two dumb-bells containing nitrogen, a diamagnetic sub- 
stance, within a magnetic field (see Figure 4.23). The dumb-bells are suspended from a wire 
so that the magnetic field causes a torque, twisting the wires attached to the dumb-bells. At a 
point there is a stable position reached when the torque acting on the dumb-bells due to the 
magnetic field equals the torque exerted through twisting the wire. If the magnetic field were 
increased then the dumb-bells would rotate further. 
Figure 4.23 Paramagnetic oxygen analyser 

108 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
The instrument is calibrated by filling the chamber full of inert gas and marking the displace- 
ment of the dumb-bells. If the chamber is then completely filled with oxygen, the magnetic 
field increases and the dumb-bells rotate further. This new position is noted. There is a linear 
relationship between the dumb-bell rotation between the first point measured with inert gas 
and the second point, measured with 100% ox:/gen filling the cavity. The amount of oxygen in 
the gas can be determined. The measurement is practically performed in a similar way to a 
spot galvanometer, in that a minute mirror is placed in between the two dumb-bells at the 
point of intersection with the wire. A light is shone onto the mirror and reflected onto a screen. 
The position of the reflection corresponding to zero oxygen concentration in the chamber and 
100% oxygen in the chamber are marked as being 0 and 100% oxygen. Then the position of 
the reflection between these two marks can be related to the percentage in the sample. 
Modern gaseous oxygen analysers incorporate a coil of wire around both dumb-bells so that 
when a current passes through the wire, an equal and opposite force to the magnetic torque 
due to the diamagnetic nitrogen is produced. In this way the current can be varied through the 
coils to maintain zero displacement of the dumb-bells. Hence, a graph of current through the 
dumb-bells to maintain zero position against oxygen concentration can be used to calibrate 
the device. The gaseous oxygen analyser malfunctions in the presence of significant concen- 
trations of other paramagnetic gases, such as carbon dioxide.

Imaging Fundamentals 
and Mathematics 
5.1. Purpose of Imaging 
Medical images are used to obtain information about internal body organs or the skeleton to 
determine a patient's physical state. An image may show damage to organs that cannot be 
externally visualised. The dangers or stress to a patient by use of a non-invasive imaging 
technique may be greatly less than those of an invasive operation. The latter may also be slow 
and disturb the physical state which it is intended to evaluate. 
A variety of imaging modalities is used. They use variously photon, ultrasonic, thermal and 
electrical impedance methods to obtain characteristics of the body being examined. These 
characteristics are evaluated and transformed into a form of picture which indirectly yields 
information about that patient's pathology. 
In principle an image is a representation of some object. Its nature is indirect, and its form is 
different from the original incarnation. Generally the images we use in medical applications 
are represented in two dimensions. From examining this representation we may evaluate 
certain of the characteristics shown in the image to see how they are derived or to see how 
they deviate from the normal. 
Images are thus used to examine unusual growth, which may be cancerous, to examine bone 
structures which may have been physically damaged, or to look for damage to blood vessels 
or brain tissue. The visual representation which the image affords may enable a diagnosis of 
the patient's condition and enable its correction. 
This chapter provides a brief overview of imaging technology which is treated more thor- 
oughly in Chapter 6. Our main purpose for now is to introduce the common mathematical 
background used. This includes a basic formulation of image acquisition which leads on to the 
methods used to restore and enhance images. For a more thorough treatment of the math- 
ematical background to the signal analysis and image processing covered in this chapter, the 
reader is referred to specialist texts such as Bracewell (1986) and Gonzalez (1992). 

110 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
5.1.1. Overview of Imaging Modalities 
The various imaging technologies have very different physical characteristics. Sound waves 
are transmitted reasonably well through tissue. Their velocity is around 1500 ms -l. At this 
velocity it is reasonable to be able to separate structures within a body by their differential 
depths. Echoes return in times of up to about 0.1 ms. The hazard from ultrasound energy is 
believed to be very low at the energies normally used in clinical diagnosis. The resolution of 
ultrasound is primarily limited by the aperture of the ultrasonic probe, diffraction and thus the 
wavelength of the sound employed. 
On the other hand various high energy photon beams maybe used, such as X radiation. These 
are of an energy which does not permit their focusing, and the velocities are such that pulse 
echo techniques are not feasible. Unlike ultrasound, however, X rays are transmitted through 
gaseous spaces, such as in the lungs, and may be used for general thoracic examination. The 
image formed by X rays is a result of the differential absorption of the radiation in different 
tissues. The effects of diffraction do not directly limit the resolution of X ray imaging. 
As an alternative to using ionising radiation in this fashion, a patient may be given a small 
amount of radioactive material bonded to a biochemical reagent. 'Nuclear Medicine' studies 
observe the external radiation produced to help examine, amongst other things, the manner in 
which the reagent is transferred about the body. This can provide useful diagnostic informa- 
tion of a rather different nature. 
X radiation is in principle dangerous. It is generally accepted that there is a risk involved with 
any exposure to radiation. The risk is normally considered as a stochastic risk with the levels 
of dose used in imaging. These are likely to cause a number of deaths in a significant 
population of individuals each of whom receive the exposure. Therefore before any image is 
obtained, it should be established that the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of damage 
due to the examination. We looked at the absorption of radiation in Chapter 3: its safety is 
further considered in Chapter 8. 
Finally, we can also look at the use of NMR scanners. Used in a medical environment, they are 
normally known as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners, and obtain a map of the 
distribution of hydrogen nuclei to provide yet another viewpoint. Other physical parameters 
are examined in various other imaging systems which are outside the scope of this book. 
Please refer to the Bibliography for details of literature which may help you. 
5.2. Mathematical Background 
The mathematical treatment in the following sections is largely based on two dimensional 
models. This should not be surprising as the form of image we are dealing with is a two 
dimensional entity. The objects of concern of course are solid (three dimensional) structures, 
but in the main, the forms of imaging used in medicine Obtain two dimensional views. 
5.2.1. Linearity 
The imaging systems we will discuss will to the first approximation be assumed to be linear. 
A linear system is one which obeys the superposition principle: 
y)} + 

Imaging Fundamentals and Mathematics Ill 
where S is the system function, and the Is are the input functions which are shown in a two 
dimensional form. 
The response of this sort of system may be analysed in terms of its impulse response. The 
impulse or Dirac Delta function is defined to have a volume of unity: 
(2) 
This function is defined to have a vanishingly small width so that its value is zero at all points 
except (x,y). The function is used in the analysis of systems owing to two important proper- 
ties. Firstly, it may be used for selection, and secondly as it contains equal power at all 
frequencies it may be used to characterise a system's frequency response. For mathematical 
convenience, its shape is defined as that of a Gaussian probability distribution function whose 
form is shown in Figure 5.1. For a further discussion of this function, please refer to 
Bracewell (1986). 
Figure 5.1 Shape of the two dimensional Gaussian Probability function. 
The output at a point from a two dimensional system is given by 
g2 (X2)Y2 ) = S{gl (Xi)Yl )} 
(3) 
in which g l is the input, and S is the system transfer function which will be considered in more 
detail later. We use the delta function's selection property over the system in an operation 
which reorganises equation 3 to obtain

g2 (x2, Y2)= f ~ g, ({, rl)S{8(x, - {, y, - rl)}d{drl

where { and rl are dummy variables of integration. Within the integral in (4) is the system 
response to a two dimensional delta function. This may be more simply expressed in a 
different notational form as 
S{8(xi-~,Yl-rl)} = h(x2 -~,Y2 -11)= h(x2,y2;~,rl) 
(5) 
or the point spread function. This assumes that the system response is space invariant, or in 
other words that S is independent of the values of (x,y). We may now rewrite the system 
equation as 
g2 (x2, Y2 ) = f ~ gl (~, ll)h(x2, Y2 ;~, ll~J~dll 
(6) 
woo 
which is a two dimensional convolution function. 
g2 = gl * h 
(7) 
We consider convolution in section 5.2.5 below. Physically, this equation tells us that the input 
function is blurred by the system impulse response h. This suggests that we may be able to 
remove the distortions introduced by the imaging system if we can characterise the system's 
impulse response to facilitate the generation of better quality images. Unfortunately, the 
problem will not turn out to be quite so straightforward when we look at image restoration in 
section 5.3.2 below. Before doing that we must revise the mathematics to be used and clarify 
its terminology. 
5.2.2. Fourier Transform 
The Fourier Transform enables a function which is defined in terms of time or space to be 
specified as a function of frequency. In simpler language, for an image this means that the 
picture which we see may be expressed instead in terms of a spatial frequency function. As is

the case with processing time varying electronic signals, the transformed frequency function 
is the spectrum of the image in space. The high frequency components therefore represent the 
fine detail, whereas the lower frequency components contribute the overall structure. The 
Fourier Transform is given by 
(8) 
Note that we use the symbol i to represent -f~ throughout this book. 
For example, consider the function rect (X), which is of value A for X > x -20 and 0 otherwise. 
Its Fourier Transform is

The symbols ~ and ~-l are defined as the Fourier Transform and Inverse Transform operators 
respectively. 
Fourier Transforms of functions exist only in certain circumstances. Fortunately the restric- 
tions are not too severe in the cases in which we are interested. The function g(x) may be 
transformed if is integrable over its whole domain, it is not infinitely discontinuous and it has 
a finite number of discontinuities. This statement of the conditions for the existence of the 
transform is rather formal: it is better developed in specialist texts, such as Bracewell to which 
the interested reader is referred. If a function can be transformed into the frequency domain, 
its inverse transform must exist. 
The definition of the Fourier Transform pair may be extended to encompass functions of two 
dimensions: 
G(u, ,)= ~{(x, y)} = j" j' g(x, y)e-2"i(~+vY)dxdy 
(10) 
--(m 
and the inverse transform is 
(ll 
y)= 
{G(.,,)} = j" j" 

114 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
These are unsurprisingly the forms which we will most frequently encounter when processing 
images represented in two dimensions. 
5.2.3. Discrete Fourier Transform 
When we wish to process images or other signaJs by digital computer, we encounter problems 
relating to the nature of their storage which is obviously discrete rather than continuous in 
nature. This leads to two problems. The first is that we have to sample the image data, and the 
second is that the sampled data becomes a function of a discrete rather than continuous 
variable. This second problem leads to quantisation noise. 
We sample a continuous functionf(x) N times at discrete intervals to form a sequence 
{f(xo),f(x o +Ax),f(x o +2Ax) ..... f(x o +[N- I]Ax)} 
(12) 
which may be considered as the function 
= 
+ 
in which x has the values O, I, 2 ..... 
N-I and A~ is the sampling interval. 
The sampling process is often described by a sampling function, denoted by the shah symbol 
IIl, which is defined as 
= 
#) 
(14) 
Using this notation the functionf(x) is sampled: 
m(x)f(x) = Z f(n)8(x- n ) 
(15) 
When sampling, the sampling frequency must be at least twice the maximum signal fre- 
quency. This is described by Nyquist's Theorem. If this condition is not correctly observed, 
the periodicity of the discrete Fourier Transform (equations 16, 17 below) leads to incorrect 
distribution of power in the calculated spectrum, causing aliasing. 
The discrete Fourier Transform is then 
F(u)=N-IZf(x)e

(17)

In these expressions, u/N is analogous to frequency measured in cycles per sampling interval 
(see for example Bracewell). 
Again, this transform pair may be expressed in two dimensions:

2~(_~+_~ 
u=0 v=0 
for values of x = 0, 1, 2,..., M- 1, and y = 0, 1, 2,.., N- 1. 
In the case of images, these transforms are often quoted as pairs in a square form, so that N=M 
and they become symmetric. Equations 18 and 19 may then be rewritten: 
N-I N-I

The placement of the constant multiplicative factors N -1 is arbitrary. 
(21) 
5.2.4. Computation 
The single dimension formulae, equations 16 and 17 above, require in the order of/9 .2 complex 
multiplications and additions for their evaluation. This number may be significantly reduced 
by avoiding the repetition of calculations. A method of reduction of the number of calcula- 
tions is shown in very brief outline here to endeavour to standardise on the terminology used 
in the description of the imaging process. For a derivation of the method, known either as the 
Fast Fourier Transform, or the Cooley-Tukey algorithm, see for instance Bracewell. The 
Fourier Transform off(n), given in equation 16 may now be rewritten as 
N-I 
F(u)= Xf(n)W~r u 
.where Wlv =e -(~) 
(22) 
n=0 
and a similar expression may be written for the inverse transform. Equation 22 may now be 
split into even and odd parts: 
F(u)- ~f(2m)W2N'u + ~.~f(2m+ l)W~ 2''+')" 
(23) 
m=O 
m=0 
Note that this approach is applicable if N is a power of 2 when the algorithm provides a 
significant speed improvement. In practice it may be necessary to extend the size of the 
transformed matrix to meet this condition. 
When we sprit the transform into these two components we may also reorganise it into two 
functions f~ and f2 representing the even and odd parts respectively. But 

116 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
since these factors represent the phase. So 
F(u)= ~_..,f,(m)W~+W~ 
Ef,(m)W ~ 
m=0 
m=0 
and 
F(u+N//2)- FI(u)-W~F2(u), foru=0,1 .... ,N//2-1 
(24) 
(25) 
Here F ! and F 2 are the N/2 point discrete transforms for thefl and f2 sequences respectively. 
These last two calculations require (N/2) 2 complex multiplications each. The second terms 
require a further NI2 complex multiplications. This method thus reduces the number of 
required operations by a factor of 2 for large values of N. 
This same process may now be continued. If the total number of points is a power of two, then 
it may be carried on iteratively until one point transforms are calculated. Thus for v points, the 
calculation may be carried out v = log 2 N times, and the total number of complex muliplications 
reduced to (N/2)log2N. 
This process may be extended to cover transformations in two dimensions. 
5.2.5. Convolution 
We will encounter Convolution frequently in the processing of images. The convolution 
operation provides the basis for the description of the formation of an image. A full descrip- 
tion of the mathematical background is beyond the scope of this book: for a clear introduction, 
the reader should look elsewhere, such as Bracewell. 
The convolution of two functions of x is defined as 
h(x)=~_f(u)g(x-u)du, 
(26) 
which is more simply expressed by the notation 
h(x) = f(x) * g(x) 
(27) 
u is a dummy variable of integration. An example of convolution is shown in Figure 5.3. 
5.3. Imaging Theory 
In this section we look at the basis of the composition of an image. The relationship between 
an object and an image was previously briefly outlined. This may now be explored in more 
detail to see how to present the image in such a way as to reduce noise, highlight desired 
aspects and to remove any artefacts introduced by the imaging system. This is again presented 
in theoretical terms without direct reference to any specific imaging modality: the technology 
is described in Chapter 6.

5.3.1. System Transfer Function 
An image provides us with a representation of an object. Let the object in space bef and its 
image g. The image is created by the imaging system as a representation of the object. If the 
transformation is perfect, thenf=g. However, real imaging systems never achieve perfection, 
so we are concerned with the changes introduced. These are in the simplest cases two 
dimensional representations of solid objects in the manner of a photograph of a solid object. 
The simplified general relationship between the object and image is 
(28) 
This is the convolution of the objectfand a function of the imaging system, h. This function in 

118 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
this case is taken to be space invariant, or independent of the values of x and y. This may be 
expressed in the frequency domain as 
G(u, v) = H(u, v)F(u, v) 
(29) 
where H is called the transfer function. In optical terminology H is called the optical transfer 
function, whose magnitude is called the modulation transfer function. Rather in the manner of 
an amplifier of an electronic signal, the transfer function defines the frequency response of the 
system. For the system to transfer the finest details of the object to the image, the transfer 
function should have sufficient bandwidth not to cause deterioration. 
When we are going to use computer enhancements of images, it is necessary to sample and 
digitise the image. For a discrete (or sampled) image, this relationship may be written as 
= ~ h ij(x, y)f(x, y)dxdy 
gi,j 
(30) 
If we also assume that the object was itself digital, then we may write 
N 
N 
gi,j ---" 
Z Z h i,j,k,lf 
i,j 
(31) 
k=l t=! 
which indicates the potential amount of calculation required to restore an image in the real 
space domain. 
Now consider equation 29 in a discrete form, and rearrange it as the inverse transform. 
N-l N-I 
<32) 
u:0 v:0 
We have attempted in this equation to recover the objectf from the image G and the system 
transfer function H. It should be clear that equation 32 indicates the danger of attempting 
directly to recover the best interpretation of the object from the image by simple deconvolution. 
We can clarify this point after introducing a noise term in the next equation. 
The system noise may be represented by introducing a further term n into the description of 
the image and object relationship. The noise term describes the variability between different 
images obtained from the same object using the same imaging system. 
-- ~~ h(x, y)f(x, y)dxdy+ n(x, y) 
(33) 
g(x, Y) 
This equation does not have a unique solution. Rather, we may only achieve a best fit 
relationship between image and object. If we apply the same technique as in equation 32 to 
obtain a solution, there would probably be regions of H which are close to zero. These could 
easily coincide with regions in which the numerator was non-zero, allowing the 'improved' 
image to become dominated by noise. 
We now express equation 33 in rather different terms. Let us consider instead that thefterm is 
an ideal image. Then the degraded image 
y) = 
y)] + 
y) 
(34) 
This equation rather more clearly describes the operation of obtaining an image as a two stage 
process whereby the ideal image f is processed by the degradation operation H and 

Imaging Fundamentals and Mathematics 119 
subsequently by the additive noise term n to produce a degraded image g. 
In our following analysis, we are going to assume that the degradation process is linear, 
homogeneous and space invariant. Then if we simplify by assuming that the noise is zero, 
recall equation 1: 
H[klf,(x,y)+k2f2(x,y)]f k, H[fl(x,y)]+k2H[f2(x,y)] 
(35) 
The noise free solution to the system described by equation 34 is space invariant if 
g(x- oc, y-~3) = H[f(x-cL, y-~3)] 
(36) 
for any oc and [3. 
These expressions form the basis of the description of the image recovery process which we 
describe in the following section. 
5.3.2. Image Restoration 
Image Restoration is the process of recovering or improving an image that is in some sense 
degraded. The physical system which obtained the image we have already observed will have 
a limited bandwidth and thus will reduce the image's fine detail. It will also introduce noise to 
the image. It is our purpose in the first place to attempt to obtain an image which is the best 
estimate of the object from which it was obtained. Expressed in slightly different terms, recall 
the degradation model outlined in the previous section: we will be seeking to obtain from the 
degraded image a best estimate of the ideal image. 
Returning to equation 4, the non-degraded image may be described in terms of its convolution 
with the two dimensional impulse function: 
oo 
Using the noiseless description of the system given in equation 34 above we may substitute 
forf 
g(x,y)= H[f(x,y)]= H 
(a,~)8(x- a,y- 13)dad~ 
(38) 
As the sysmm is linear, it is additive and homogeneous, so 
g(x, y)= f f f(o~,~3)n[8(x-o~, 
y-~)]dca:If3 
(39) 
We may define the term 
h(x, cx, y,~) = H[8(x -eL, y- 13)] 
(40) 
which is called the system impulse response. This may be substituted in equation 38 to form 
g(x, y) = f f f(cL,[3)h(x,o~, 
y,[3)dou1[3 
(41) 

120 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Equation 41 is known as the Fredholm Integral which states that if the system impulse 
response is known, then the response to any inputf(cz,~) may be calculated. Alternatively, this 
says that the system impulse response completely characterises a system. 
If the system is space invariant, then equation 41 reduces to the convolution integral: 
g(x, y) = ~ ~ f(ot, 
~)h(x 
- oc, y - [3) dad~ 
(42) 
In a discrete form, equation 42 may be written as 
M-IN-i 
g(x,y)--" ZZf(m,n)h(x-m,y-n) 
(43) 
m ffi O n ffi O 
This may be expressed more compactly in a matrix representation in which H is the 
degredation operator introduced in equation 34 
g=nf 
(44) 
where g and f are column vectors formed by stacking the rows of the mx n functions g(x,y), 
f(x,y). H is a matrix of dimension MN • MN. 
We now reintroduce the noise term n from equation 33 to the equation, again in a vector form 
(of the same dimension as g): 
g=Hf+n 
A 
and the best estimate image f is defined by multiplying by the inverse operator H- 1 
A 
f = H- lg = H- 1Hf +H- in 
(45) 
or more simply, the best estimate image depends on the idealised image f, and the noise term 
n which may have been multiplied by components of the inverse system transfer function 
H-I, so 
A 
f = f + H-In 
(46) 
We should also note here that the matrix H -1 may not exist. 
Clearly another way has to be found to recover the image other than by direct deconvolution. 
In the first place it is rational to try to minimise the effect of noise by using the standard 
method of least squares. Then 
which is defined as 
I'-" 11 '-/'- 
where 
the T operator transposes the matrix.

f = H-{g 
(51) 
Which is unfortunately the result previously obtained in equation 32 that caused noise 
amplification and was therefore of no use. 
This problem may be resolved by using a modified technique, which instead of attempting to 
recover the image itself, seeks to find a best modified form of the image. 
We will seek to minimise a function of the form Q 
under the constraints imposed in 
equation 47. Q is a linear operator which operates on f. Applying the constraint, we may write 
a function 
i{o,{l'+ -H

Here we have substituted ~ =1/r for clarity. Now if ~ is set to zero, this equation reverts to the

A 
The operator Q may be selected now to enable values of f to be obtained which are not 
dominated by noise in parts of the spectrum. This technique is explored in more detail by 
Gonzalez (1992). 
5.4. Image Processing 
The following sections outline several forms of 'improvement' which are undertaken to 
clarify aspects of images. This treatment is far from exhaustive: the interested reader is 
referred to specialised texts on image processing, such as Gonzalez (1992). 
5.4.1. Enhancement 
An image is enhanced to draw out certain characteristics that would otherwise be unclear. It is 
therefore different in principle from restoration, and is involved with the image itself rather 

122 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
than the manner in which it was produced. The sorts of enhancement discussed here involve 
filtering and contrast enhancement which are used to alter the emphasis on particular image 
features. In a medical context these improvements are undertaken to improve the diagnostic 
features of the image. 
The methods are therefore not general: the particular form of enhancement that is indicated 
for a form of problem is likely to be specific to that problem and imaging modality. The major 
groups of methods employed are those which operate in the Spatial and Frequency domains 
respectively. 
The first forms of spatial enhancement methods are those which operate on points in the 
image. These transform the grey level of points. This may be desirable for several reasons. 
The first is that the dynamic range of the image information exceeds that of the display 
medium. For example, there may be an image with components distributed over a range of 
10 6, to be shown on an 8 bit display. This form of image may be displayed with greater clarity 
by logarithmic compression of its dynamic range. On the other hand, an image may show its 
features better if much of the grey scale information is hidden by altering the display 
characteristics so that it displays only a limited dynamic range, perhaps only two bits. The 
threshold level for this transition needs to be selected to give the best view of the desired 
features. 
A more general form of point image manipulation is to use a histogram method. Here the 
starting point is to obtain the distribution densities in the image of each discrete grey level. 
Transformations may be undertaken either to shift the overall distribution or to modify the 
image brightness. Alternatively the density distribution function may be expanded or con- 
tracted in order to modify the resulting image contrast. 
Techniques are also employed to modify the whole image in order to equalise the histogram of 
its grey scale, to make it fit a defined pattern, or to modify selectively different areas of an 
image according to different recipes. These all have characteristics which lend themselves to 
particular situations. 
The other aspect of spatial processing of concern involves undertaking transforms based on 
the properties of an area rather than single points individually. These processing techniques 
use filters which may be used either to smooth out transitions (low pass filters) or to enhance 
contrast (high pass filters). If the filters are matrices populated by numbers used to multiply 
the points in the image's matrix, and they are defined symmetrically about their centre, they in 
effect carry out the convolution operation directly. These filters are linear in operation. 
Other spatial filters may be defined which are not linear. An example is the median filter. This 
examines points in a neighbourhood, and sets their values to those of the median value in the 
set of those points. For example the filter would select a group of nine points (a 3 x 3 array), 
and set their values in ascending order. The value found for the middle element- the fifth - is 
used to replace the value of the pixel. This technique quickly removes high noise peaks in an 
image as they have values which are excluded from being the median value. It has the distinct 
advantage over smoothing filters, which carry out a low-pass filtering operation, that it does 
not directly affect edge sharpness and thus lose detail. 
Filtering may also be carried out in the frequency domain. These may be defined either as 
ideal filters, or to have a particular cut off shape. Frequency domain filtering is attractive 
either when it is desired to match a spectrum exactly, or when the image data are already held 
in the frequency domain for other reasons. 

Imaging Fundamentals and Mathematics 
123 
5.4.2. Resolution 
The resolution of an image is defined as the ability to enable two points to be distinguished. It 
is therefore specified as the maximum spatial frequency in the object which may be recog- 
nised in the image. This is clearly a function of frequency and contrast. 
The primary factor which influences the resolution of X ray images is therefore the sampling 
frequency. For tomographic scanners this is due to the number of samples taken when rotating 
the imaging system around the patient. In gamma camera or other scintillation counter 
systems, the size and number of sampling points defines the resolution. For a formal definition 
of the term 'resolution', see for example Longhurst (1967). 
Thus for a tomographic image, the resolution is traded against the total X ray dose given to the 
patient. The more samples taken, the greater the overall dose given, but the better the spatial 
frequency information. 
5.4.3. Blur Removal 
It is possible to remove some of the movement artefacts from digitally stored images which 
are likely when the image sampling time extends beyond a period of about a tenth of a second. 
It is likely that many medical images suffer from such artefacts: certain of the more modern 
imaging equipment is able to assist in their removal. 
5.4.4. Image Analysis 
A further topic to be considered is image analysis. The term relates to the examination of the 
image to identify its structural components. The image may be segmented, by examining it to 
locate edges and thus other geometric shapes. These are the building blocks used subsequently 
for recognition of the structures in images. This morphological analysis is able to detect 
structures such as text characters in images from an assemblage of pictorial regions. 
The analysis of regions requires the application of Knowledge Based System techniques. 
Image structures require to be compared with known structural forms. In a medical applica- 
tion, we should know which structure we are looking for, but it may be desirable to use an 
automatic system to attempt to quantify some aspect of the information stored in an image. In 
many areas of image analysis the objective is to make a ready and quick assessment of a 
pattern. In medical analysis, rather the reverse is the case, as it may be desirable to isolate the 
unrecognised or abnormal so that it may be enhanced and more clearly displayed. 
A serious limitation remains that the recognition of features is difficult when applied to noisy 
images. Improving the signal to noise ratio of medical images is difficult. Increased exposure 
is required to obtain an improvement potentially leading to the use of greater doses than would 
otherwise be required. This brings in the ethical question about when to undertake radiologi- 
cal examination (see Chapter 8). Lengthening the duration of exposure is likely to increase 
movement artefacts potentially obliterating the improvement obtained in the physical image 
signal to noise ratio. 
Some recent imaging equipment uses these techniques to recognise structures, such as the 
chambers of the heart so that the stroke volume may be measured by imaging technology 
rather than using an invasive technique. 

6 
Imaging Technology 
The purpose of this chapter is to introduce a number of the currently used methods of 
obtaining medical images. The list is far from exhaustive, but is intended to provide a basis of 
the techniques used. 
We intend to show from the range of these techniques that although none is a panacea, that 
each provides characteristic information which can assist a clinician in certain types of 
diagnosis. Examination for certain conditions may well require the application of more than 
one method. Sometimes it may be of use to attempt to construct single images derived from a 
combination of different modalities in order to build up a clearly recognisable picture of a 
particular pathology. 
All the techniques outlined in this chapter are progressively being refined by the computer 
systems which are integrated with them. Manufacturers are now offering both standard 
network interfaces to enable remote access to the image data and optical disc storage to permit 
cost effective long term storage of digital images. 
6.1. Projection X Radiography 
The simplest, earliest developed and most frequently used form of medical imaging is by the 
use of projection X radiography. X rays are shone through the area of the patient under study, 
taking care to avoid exposure beyond the bounds of interest and to use the energy of X 
radiation which best shows the aspects of the patient being studied. In the simplest routine 
forms of processing, a latent image is formed on an X ray film which is subsequently 
developed and fixed to make the image visible. We outline the technique in Section 6.1.1 
together with its technological descendant which uses digital image acquisition to enable 
images to be processed. 
Projection X radiographs are either made directly by effectively comparing the absorption of 
tissues, or may be enhanced by the administration of a radiopaque dye which is localised in 
either tissues or fluids. Plate 1 (p. 133) shows the sort of apparatus used to obtain these images. 
6.1.1. Film Characteristics 
An ordinary photographic film which is sensitive to visible light is made from a series of 
layers coated onto a cellulose medium. On the active side of the film there is, from the outside 
in, a protective coating, a light sensitive emulsion, and a layer to assist the emulsion to adhere 

Imaging Technology 125 
to the cellulose. The reverse of the cellulose has a backing layer whose purpose is to reduce 
curling. The film emulsion is made of a colloidal suspension of silver halide crystals in a 
gelatine medium. These are of an extremely small particulate size. Each grain may individu- 
ally be blackened as a result of the absorption of light as energised grains may be chemically 
reduced by the subsequent action of film developer to silver. Any grains which are not 
chemically reduced are purged of their silver halide by the action of a fixing agent which thus 
prevents further blackening. (Note that a reverse or positive image may be directly obtained 
by instead purging the film of silver, and then reducing all remaining silver halide to silver.) 
The action of light on silver halide is to move electrons into trapping sites in the crystal from 
which they may be removed by the reducing action of the developer. 
The sensitivity of this sort of film to light is largely controlled by the grain size. Larger grains 
are more likely to have been sufficiently activated to enable them to be reduced, so the film is 
more sensitive to light, but has a poorer resolution as a result. These faster films also have a 
shorter region between being fully exposed and clear: they therefore have a higher contrast. 
A film has the characteristic typically where there is a 'fog level', or maximum transparency 
which sets the lower limit of its sensitivity. Its blackening response to increasing fight 
increases logarithmically to a shoulder, beyond which it is saturated. The slope of the 
logarithmic region is the contrast of the film. These characteristics are shown in Figure 6.1. 
An X ray film differs from the description above because of the limited absorption probability 
of X ray photons by the silver halide emulsion. Unlike a visible film, X ray cellulose film 
bases are coated on both sides with the silver halide emulsion. This increases sensitivity at the 
price of some loss of film resolution. However, the system is not limited by film resolution, 
Density 
Fog level

Figure 6.1 Photographic film characteristics 

126 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
and it is desirable to maximise film sensitivity, as it is not usual to enlarge shadow X 
radiographs significantly. The resolution of the film is in fact limited by the mean free path of 
the secondary particles produced as a result of the incidence of X rays on the film. These have 
mean free path lengths of between 10 and 100 ~tm, whereas the thickness of the film emulsion 
is around 20 ~m and the base thickness about 200 ~m. The emulsion thickness therefore 
effectively limits the spread of the secondary radiation, so direct emulsions have good 
resolution characteristics where a relatively high dose may be tolerated. 
As an alternative to these direct emulsion films, there are films which are used in conjunction 
with fluorescent screens. The phosphor is made of particles of sizes of about 10 ~tm diameter 
in a layer between 70 and 300 ~tm thickness. X ray photons incident on the phosphor produce 
secondary visible photons, but these are released in a variety of directions causing a loss of 
resolution. There are configurations in which either one or two phosphors are used to assist in 
dose reduction: there is a trade off between dose and resolution. 
6.1.2. Dose Considerations 
The required dose in projection X radiography where film is used as the receptor is controlled 
by the sensitivity of the film and the need to ensure that an adequate signal is available to 
obtain the required signal to noise ratio. The X ray spectrum used is chosen to obtain 
satisfactory differential absorption in the range of different tissues encountered for a parficu= 
lar image type. 
It will be seen below that the spectrum incident on the patient is dependent on the tube 
excitation potential, the target (anode) material and the form of filtering used between the 
tube and patient. In broad terms low energy radiation is more readily absorbed than higher 
energies. Therefore when looking through greater depths of tissue, the use of higher energy 
beams is indicated. The use of low energy components is simply damaging as their energy is 
released to the tissue without contributing to forming an image. 
The power for an X ray tube is best derived from a stabilised power supply. This means that 
the spectrum produced is controlled. The energy spectrum of the tube is characterised by a 
peak emission determined by the instantaneous excitation voltage, and a low end defined by 
absorption of the radiation by the material through which it passes. This is normally control- 
led by the use of filters which absorb components below a certain energy. There are normally 
other significant peaks in energy emission due to characteristic radiation of k shell electrons 
from the target material. 
The radiation dose received by a patient during this form of radiography is typically between 
1 and 10 mGy. The actual dose delivered is very variable, as it depends on the nature of the 
examination undertaken, and therefore on the type of equipment employed. Perhaps more 
surprisingly the dose for a given type of examination appears to vary between different 
hospitals undertaking the same examination. The guidance to the Medical Physicist should be 
to take whatever steps are necessary to minimise the dose received to a level compatible with 
an acceptable level of image noise. Doses should be consistently 'As Low as Reasonably 
Achievable' (ALARA) when proper quality control measures are in place and the radiological 
apparatus is correctly set up. (See, for instance, Carmichael, 1988).

6.1.3. Attenuation of Beam by Tissue 
The photons in an X ray beam passed through a patient are either transmitted, scattered or 
absorbed. The removal of photons from the beam by scattering and absorption may be 
expressed as 
~V -- -Ia2VzS~" 
(1) 
where AN represents the number of photons lost from a population of N incident photons over 
a distance ~. The absorption coefficient is I~. We may integrate and solve equation 1 to obtain 
the loss through a body of thickness x: 
No~, -- N/~e -~ 
(2) 
Instead of looking at the number of photons directly, we may instead use the intensity of the 
beam and expand the absorption coefficient to take account of its spatial variation and 
dependence on incident photon energy. Equation 2 becomes 
in which 10(~) is the incident intensity, and is a function of the photon energy E. 
(3) 
These expressions represent the total absorption of the beam. Photons may release their 
energy in either a single collision or a series of events. Now we may consider the mechanisms 
which give rise to the removal of the photons. This treatment builds on the material we 
presented in Chapter 3 which describes the forms of collision process undertaken by ionising 
radiation. 
Firstly, photons are removed by Rayleigh Scattering. The wavelength of lower energy 
components of a diagnostic X ray beam is in the same order as the atomic diameter. As a result 
these components may be diffracted at effectively random angles owing to the lack of 
structural coherence in tissue. 
At higher energies, the photoelectric effect predominates. Photons incident with tissue may 
give up their energy to tightly bound electrons which recoil in the tissue. They are in turn 
displaced by neighbouring electrons which release fluorescent radiation. This effect varies as 
the third power of the atomic number. There are significant peaks in absorption which depend 
on the ionisation energies of each electron band: the most pronounced is the k shell absorption 
edge. This energy is below the region of interest for most biological materials, although it will 
be seen to be significant in the spectrum of X rays produced by diagnostic sets. 
The third scattering mechanism which is of concern is Compton Scattering. This is the effect 
whereby a free electron receives kinetic energy from an incident photon and is displaced. The 
photon therefore loses energy, but in the region of interest, only a small percentage. The 
scattered photons may thus be detected as coming from a different direction. This effect must 
be countered to avoid loss of image contrast. 
Figure 6.2 shows the relative contributions of each of these absorption mechanisms in water 
as a function of incident photon energy. 
Differentiation of the various forms of bodily tissues is normally the result of the differing 
absorption coefficients for those materials. The proportion of calcium with its higher atomic 
weight accounts for the larger absorption coefficient for bone than other forms of tissue. The

coefficients tend towards common values at higher energy levels once Compton Scattering 
predominates. These are plotted in Figure 6.3. 
6.1.4. Scatter and Image Contrast 
X ray image contrast is affected by scatter. Photons passing through a patient are transmitted, 
absorbed and scattered (as described in section 6.1.3). The receptor is sensitive to those 
photons which are not absorbed. Reducing the number of received scattered photons may be 
partially achieved by collimating the X ray beam immediately in front of the receptor to 
constrain the range of angles of incidence of photons which will be counted by the receptor. 
Before proceeding, we define the ideal image contrast. This is, in the absence of noise, 
C = --~-- 
(4) 
I 
where 7 is the mean background intensity and ~ the local intensity variation. 
With X rays the scattering process is caused by the interaction of photons with atoms. The 
scatter probability is a function of both the type of material and the photon energy. Generally 
higher energy photons are less likely to be scattered, and low energy photons are more likely

Figure 6.3 Absorption coefficients for tissue as function of energy 
to be absorbed completely, either by the photoelectric effect or multiple scattering. The 
effective X ray dose is normally higher as a result of the use of low energy X rays than high 
energy beams. 
Two measures may be taken to mitigate the effects of scatter. Firstly, it is normal practice to 
place a collimating screen in front of a film. When digital radiology is performed, as 
described in section 6.1.6, with certain forms of image receptor it is usual to scan the object 
with X rays. This means that a properly collimated beam maybe recorded with the effects of 
scatter considerably reduced. 
Another major restraint on image quality is due to source noise. In the case of a communica- 
tions system, the signal frequencies typically range up to around 1GHz. With X ray systems, 
we are measuring photons which are released from their source by quantum mechanical 
processes. Their energies therefore spread with a distribution of energies defined by a Poisson 
distribution. The thermal noise in a system is shown by Bleaney (1976) to be 4kTB, where k is 
Boltzmann's constant, T absolute temperature, and B the bandwidth of measurement. The 
noise energy time 1/B is therefore 4kZ The energy carried by a photon is hv, so for a 
population of N photons, the signal to noise ratio is 
Nhv 
SNR = ~ Nh~'V + 4kT 
(5) 

130 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
The term ~r 
is the standard deviation in photon energy. With X ray frequencies, v, of 
around I019 Hz, the ratio 4kT/hv is 2.5 • 10 -6, so the signal to noise ratio is dominated by 
quantum noise and is proportional to ~/N. 
The effect of this quantum noise is to introduce what is known as an image mottle to X ray 
images. Clearly it is reduced by increasing the X ray dose used to obtain the image. 
The other main limitation of image quality to be considered here is that due to scatter. 
Recalling equation 4, if we take account of the degradation of the image contrast due to 
scatter, this may be expressed as 
ct, 
c 
(6) 
c,= 
i+h/1 ' 
Here, C, is the resultant contrast, degraded by the effect of the additional intensity I s of 
scattered photons to the transmitted flux I r In terms of the image signal to noise ratio equation 
4 may be expressed (see Macovski, 1983) 
cnN 
_

(7) 
where T I is the detector efficiency. This contrast loss will occur unless steps can be taken to 
mitigate its effects. One method is to collimate radiation ahead of the receptor: this is 
described in section 6.1.5 below. The other is to attempt to discriminate the energy levels of 
incident radiation, as the Compton scattered radiation has a lower energy than that of source 
photons. This latter technique is only practicable for monochromatic sources. 
6.1.5. Beam Collimation 
The output of a diagnostic X ray tube is controlled either by a gate to constrain its spread or by 
a collimator to produce a parallel beam. As the resultant image contrast and hence its 
resolution depends significantly on the amount of received scatter, the beam is passed through 
a collimator, or grid, in front of the receptor. 
The grid (shown in Figure 6.4) is made of strips of lead, separated by another material. For 
application with low energy beams, this is normally cotton, whereas with high energy beams, 
aluminium is used. 
The grid may be left stationary, but will then cause the display of the grid lines. Alternatively 
it may be moved in some form of reciprocating motion. The grid chosen is dependent on the 
application. Densities of 80 to 150 lines cm -l are employed. Moving grids with a line density 
of 30 cm -l and a cotton or paper interspace are used where minimising the dose is crucial. 
A further alternative method is to reduce the X ray source to produce a line of radiation which 
traverses the patient, and to provide a pair of slits above the receptor which track the rotation 
of the beam of X rays. The slits have to be moved at different velocities, but this arrangement 
may significantly reduce the effect of scatter on image quality. Its disadvantages are its 
mechanical complexity and the time taken to scan the area of interest which can lead to 
differential movement artefacts.

6.1.6. Image Construction 
The description given above primarily refers to the use of X radiographs taken with a film 
receptor. Instead this may be replaced with a real time detector which enables the image to be 
recorded and then processed by a computer. Clearly this makes possible image enhancement 
but at a cost of significantly more expensive apparatus. (Image enhancement can be carried 
out using film as an intermediate recording medium so that enhancement and manipulation 
are undertaken off line.) 
Early forms of fluoroscopic system used a phosphor coated screen in place of the film to 
enable direct viewing by the radiologist. This represents a radiation hazard for the operator 
who over a period receives a significant dose. This apparatus has poor performance in terms 
of its signal to noise ratio if the patient dose is to be kept within reasonable bounds. 
More modern real time methods use image intensifiers. These use a fluorescent screen in 
close contact with a photocathode. This cathode is inside a vacuum tube with an excitation 
potential of around 25 kV. The system has a series of interfaces. 
1. The X ray phosphor has an efficiency of somewhat less than unity, so not all X ray photon 
energy is converted into visible photons. 
2. However, on average each X ray photon absorbed produces an equivalent of around 1000 
visible photons. 
3. The photocathode has an efficiency of about 10% in conversion of visible photons into 
electrons. 
4. The output phosphor converts each excited electron into about 1000 visible photons. 
The system overall produces around 105 visible photons for each five received X ray photons. 
This gain is necessary to compensate for the sensitivity of the eye if observed directly: 

132 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
alternatively this system lends itself well to being coupled to a video camera so that the image 
may be recorded, displayed, and if necessary enhanced. The form of an image intensifier used 
for radiology is shown in Figure 6.5.

As discussed so far, digital image acquisition would offer little more than film. Images could 
be processed and potentially analysed to obtain some degree of automation of search. Having 
image information stored in a digital fashion and able to be processed affords several 
significant advantages. 
Firstly, consider an image of 1024 pixels square. If it is recorded at a resolution of 8 bits, then 
it would require 1MB of storage. Images typically require examination in the immediate 
aftermath of being obtained, and potentially some further examination in the following period 
of days. In some cases it is desirable to be able to compare images obtained over a period of 
months or years to be able to observe the progression of a condition. In any event, there is a 
common legal requirement to retain images for around a ten year period in common with 
other recorded medical diagnostic information. This quantity of information is sufficient to 
cause serious problems with its management and retrieval. Current magnetic disc technology 
will store around 1-10 GB on a single disc volume, and high density tapes a comparable 
amount. A hospital may require to store image data amounting to around 1000 GB in a year. 
Potentially, digital media could reduce the space requirements for this storage as well as 
providing a more manageable means of access. 
The imago quality depends also on the uniformity of illumination provided by the X ray 
source and the spatial response of the detection system. These problems may be addressed by 
standardising the system spatial response in the image processing system. Furthermore, the 
use of digital systems permits the acquisition of a series of images over a period of months: 
the images may be compared with one another having used rubber sheet mapping to obtain the 
best correspondence between separately obtained images. 

Imaging Technology 133 
From the clinical viewpoint, digital radiology provides superior features. Apart from being 
able to improve images by filtering, noise reduction and edge enhancement, it makes possible 
other modes of imaging. The most significant involve taking two images in slightly different 
ways, but in register so that their differences may be examined. The removal of common 
information by subtraction means that an image is built which is devoid of the obscuring 
detail of the anatomy not under examination. Thus although there is an inevitable increase in 
noise as the images are obtained in the region where quantum mottle is significant, the result 
is a much clearer view of the desired clinical information. 
The major technique employed is known as Digital Subtraction Angiography. Here, an image 
of the region of interest of the patient is obtained, followed seconds later by taking a further 
image after the administration and perfusion of a radiopaque dye. Subtracting the first image 
from the second yields a view of the major blood vessels without the obstructing detail 
otherwise presented by other anatomical features. An obvious limitation with this technique is 
that the period between snapshots is sufficient time for movement to occur and thus reduce the 
quality of the image obtained. Imaging of blood vessels can indicate a number of clinical 
conditions, such as narrowing or obstruction, aneurysms (the weakening of the wall of a 
vessel which is a frequent prelude to its rupture) and displacement of the vessel due to a 
growth. Plate 1 is a picture of an X ray tube and detection system used in digital subtraction 
angiography and a peripheral image obtained is shown in Plate 2. 
As a further alternative to this 'temporal' subtraction, it is possible to discriminate between 
different tissue types, as we noted in Figure 6.3 above, by the use of different X ray energies. 
This technique, known as 'energy' subtraction, enables views to be obtained of one form, 
perhaps all bone, or all soft tissue, affording images perhaps of calcification in blood vessels 
Plate 1 X Ray table used for fluoroscopic examination 

134 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
which would be too subtle to view without subtraction (see Brody, 1983). The technique 
employs deriving scanned images in which the scan lines are switched between alternately 
high and low energy X ray beams. The scan and switching speeds are sufficiently high to 
minimise any movement artefacts. 
These techniques complement the use of tomographic scans, described in section 6.2, as they 
afford good images of blood vessel structures. 
Plate 2 Peripheral image obtained using Digital Subtraction Angiography 
6.2. Computerised Tomography 
Tomography is the technique of providing a visualisation of a section. It enables a view to be 
obtained of the spatial distribution of structures including their depth. By taking views 
through a patient, tomographic techniques make possible a view of the plane through which 
the radiation was shone. The image then is as if the patient had been cut right through so that 
a picture is obtained looking perpendicularly onto the cut. 
Tomographic techniques were first implemented using moving sources and films. They were 
swung around the region of interest and thus blurred components other than those about 
which they rotated. This made possible a much clearer view of certain structures, but the 
images do not have improved contrast over projection X radiographs. These Motion Tomographs 
also suffer from exposing the whole area of the patient under study to a significant radiation 
dose. If more than one area is under consideration, the movement prevents multiple examina- 
tions taking place simultaneously, so requiring further exposure. 
In Computerised Tomography (CT), the source and detector are rotated around the patient. 
The detector measures the amount of radiation absorbed in each rotational direction. The 
information is used to reconstruct a sectional image of the plane which was exposed to 
radiation. Clearly the more sectional images that are obtained the greater the radiation dose. 

Imaging Technology 135 
Doses due to tomographic examination are significantly higher than those of conventional 
shadow X radiographs, the examination technique is slower and requires expensive appara- 
tus. It is therefore not used as an examination technique unless the additional clinical 
information indicates its requirement. 
6.2.1. Technological Outline 
In the earliest generation of apparatus used to obtain computer tomography images, the source 
and detector were mechanically moved around the patient. Scanning was by stepping them in 
concert in a single plane across the patient, then rotating through a small angle and repeating 
the procedure. The source was a finely collimated beam of X rays. This procedure is clearly 
lengthy: scans to produce a single section took typically four minutes, which clearly requires 
that the patient be held in a single position if movement artefacts were not to degrade the 
image seriously. 
Subsequent generations of scanners have reduced the requirement for mechanical movement, 
firstly by employing groups of detectors which received a fan shaped planar beam of X rays. 
Clearly a technique in which either the beam is spread out, and is potentially non-uniform, or 
one which relies on a number of different detectors requires that it shall be stabilised to ensure 
that the system response is uniform. 
The current generation of equipment employs a rotating source which emits a fan shaped 
beam of X rays through the patient towards a circular an~y of detectors. This arrangement, if 
there is some overspill of the beam, permits the sensitivity of each detector to be compared 
with others and hence standardised during the scan. These scanners are capable of completing 
a section scan in around 2 s. The resolution of the scan is maximised by shifting the diameter 
of rotation of the X ray source according to the diameter of the section of the patient of 
interest. Apart from obtaining a scan in a single slice, modern equipment also permits the use 
of helical scanning: circular and helical scanning methods are contrasted in Plate 3. 
Plate 3 Circular and helical scanning methods 

136 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Webb (1990) describes a further scanner which used a static source which worked by being 
swept about an annular target to produce the X ray beam. This is quoted as being able to 
complete a scan in better than 0.1 s and thus able to freeze cardiac motion. 
6.2.2. Image Restoration 
Two main methods exist for the restoration of images obtained by tomographic sectioning. 
The fLrst is an iterative method, which involves estimating an initial image and then progres- 
sively improving it by comparison with the data obtained. The method requires relatively 
large amounts of memory to hold its control arrays and is not simply described in an analytic 
fashion. The other is derived from analysis of the imaging mathematics in the frequency 
domain. We present a feasible method for a frequency domain image restoration technique 
from tomographic data. This assumes a simple geometry for the scanner which uses a single 
collimated X ray beam. 
Practical scanners require rather different assumptions about their geometry, since, in prac- 
tice, modem machines use fan beam geometries. 
6.2.3. Fourier Methods 
Recall that the form of information which is obtained is a series of samples of the absorption 
of radiation summed through the thickness of the body. They are measured in groups found by 
stepped movement across the patient. As a first step we consider the form of this projection in 
purely mathematical terms. The absorption is modelled by a two dimensional function ~x,y), 
and its projection, for simplicity in the direction of the x-axis, is 
g(y) = f f(x, y)dx 
(8) 
d 
which is a set of line integrals in the x direction. This projection is shown in Figure 6.6. The 
Fourier transform of the function f(x,y) is given by 
F(u, v) = ~ f (x, y)e-2Xifux+vy)d~y 
(9) 
In the direction of spatial frequency u = 0, equation 9 may be rewritten 
F(O, v) = ~ f (x, y)e-2r~vYdxdy 
= ~[~ f (x, y)dx] e-2r~vYdY 
(10) 
= ~{g(y)} 
which is the one dimensional Fourier Transform of g(y). 
This gives us the relationship between the one dimensional Fourier Transform of the projec- 
tion g(y) and a particular projection of the transform of the two dimensional functionf(x,y). 
This is known as the Central Slice Theorem. 
We may generalise the projection of the image by taking transforms for each projection as the 
imaging system is rotated. In this case the radial projection density function is 
ffi fff(x,y)5(xcosO+ ysin0- R)dxdy

R = x cos 0 + y sin 0 
As it will be more convenient to model the system in polar co-ordinates, we may write the 
Fourier Transform off(x,y) in polar co-ordinates too. The Fourier Transform in equation 9 is 
then 
F(u,v) = F(p,[3)

u = p cos[3 and v = p sin [3. This substitution may be inserted in equation 9

dimensional Fourier Transform of its projection. The set of Transforms of projections at 
angles 13 may threrefore be used to recreate the polar form of the Fourier Transform of the two 
dimensional function f(x,y). 
We are now in a position to apply this model to the problem of reconstructing a tomographic 
image which can be obtained as a set of projections. We start from a simplified statement of 
Beer's Law which is an expression of the absorption of X radiation: 
l(x) = 1o e-ta 
where I is the intensity at a point, I 0 the incident intensity and IX the absorption coefficient. So 
along the linear track of a beam, the intensity is given by: 
Ir (x')= Ir o(x')e -~'(x'y)dy' 
(16) 
where the beam is directed along the path y' at an angle ~, and Ir is the incident intensity. 
Note that the mark (') indicates the variables associated with the path. We need to calculate the 
function Ix(x,y) which is the spatial absorption function, and will become our image. Its 
representation in the frequency domain is (conventionally) M which may be calculated using 
the theorems developed above from the set of projections. 
Note that these expressions assume that all measured radiation has passed along the required 
direction. This is a simplification in which scatter has been ignored, or eliminated fron, 
detected beam and that the beam itself is monochromatic (ie. of a single energy).

6.2.4. Applications 
Computerised Tomography has been applied to a variety of diagnostic imaging applications. 
The main area, however, is in determining the extent of cancerous growth since it affords a 
much higher resolution than projection radiography. The resolution is a result of its ability to 
discriminate between small changes in absorption coefficient, It. The spatial resolution of 
current systems is around 0.4 mm for high contrasts and about 2 mm when the contrast is 
around 0.5%. 
An example of the information which may be obtained from a tomographic scan is shown in 
Plate 4. The use of helical scanning here has enabled data to be collected through a volume of 
Plate 4 Helical scan of a lung

the patient and then reconstructed to form an image with the illusion of depth. The plate 
demonstrates the volume affected by cancerous growth hopefully enabling treatment to be 
adequately planned. 
The advantage of higher resolution imaging in these circumstances should be obvious: the 
greater accuracy of determining the extent of a carcinoma enables its more complete removal 
by radiotherapy whilst minimising collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue. 
6.3. Gamma Camera 
6.3.1. System Outline 
A Gamma Camera is used to assist in diagnosing conditions which may be examined by the 
absorption of labelled materials by organs. Instead of using an external radiation source which 
is differentially absorbed by materials with varying absorption characteristics (which are 
largely controlled by the atomic weights of their components), the radiation source is injected 
into the patient. The source is tagged onto a suitable biochemical reagent which has properties 
which give it particular affinity to organs whose structure is to be examined. Therefore the 
emitted photon energy is chosen to be in a band where it is relatively little absorbed, but 
instead is transmitted. This means that the energy used is normally somewhat higher than is 
used for projection radiography. It must nevertheless be lower than the energy region which 
would cause Compton Scattering in tissue. A commercial gamma camera may be expected to 
be sensitive to energy over the range 50 to 400 keV. 
Unlike X ray examinations, nuclear medicine studies are particularly effective at providing 
differentiation between relatively uniform masses of tissue. Tagged materials are also particu- 
larly suitable for studying the movements of fluids in the body, either within blood vessels or 
to observe their uptake in organs. Similarly, nuclear medicine imaging is suitable for examin- 
ing moving structures in the body. 
The active nuclide is chosen as one with a short half life, and the reagent of a form which will 
be excreted reasonably readily. These choices minimise the residual dose of radiation which is 
retained by the patient once the examination has been completed. The choice of indicating 
materials is discussed below. 
The system in outline is shown in Figure 6.7. 
6.3.2. Image Receptor 
Image reception for Gamma Cameras (or the Anger Camera) is by a scintillating crystal, 
usually sodium iodide (NaI) which is fronted by a lead collimator. The collimator consists of 
a matrix of small holes organised in the fashion of a honeycomb to reduce the range of angles 
of incidence of high energy photons which meet the scintillating crystal. This is done to 
reduce the number of scattered photons which are detected so as to improve the spatial 
accuracy of the detecting system. The scintillating crystal converts the high energy photons 
into a number of visible photons. The number produced is proportional to the energy of the 
incident photon as it clearly does not release all its energy in a single collision producing a 
lower energy photon.

The visible photons arc collected by an array of photomultipliers so that they may subse- 
quently be counted. A photomultiplier is a vacuum device whose photo cathode is excited to 
release electrons when a photon is incident by the photoelectric effect. The released electron 
is accelerated by a large electric field towards a cathode, but is interrupted on the way by a 
number of grids. Its collision with each grid causes the grid to release further electrons. The 
spectral response of the photocathode is matched to the spectral output of the scintillating 
material. The purpose of this system is to make it possible to count the arrival of single high 
energy photons which would without the cascade effect of the photomultiplicr produce 
amounts of charge too small to measure. 
The output of each photomultiplier could be examined to look at the strength of each pulse 
received to measure the energy of each incident photon. Only those events which arose from 
the arrival of photons within the expected range of energies would then be significant for the 
measurement. The spatial resolution of the instrument depends on the y photons arriving as 
single events so that their location may be determined by looking at the relationship between 
the signals produced by each photomultiplier in the receiving array. 
In order to construct an image, an array of photomultipliers is used, arranged packed together 
over a disc. Their outputs are coupled together in order to ascertain the position of the incident 
photon on the scintillator. Overall the camera is typically about 400 mm in diameter and 300 
mm in length. A modem camera may contain 107 photomultiplier tubes and have a resolution 
of about 3.5 mm. 
The event position is determined electronically by examining the outputs of the set of 
photomultiplicrs, using a network of resistors. An estimate of the x and y co-ordinates where 
the event took place is obtained by averaging

In these expressions, the terms x i and yj are the co-ordinates of the centres of the 
photomultipliers, and the n i and nj terms their respective counts. A spatial resolution of around 
1000 points may be obtained with a resistor network for an array of only 19 photomultipliers. 
This provides a resolution of around 1 cm which is significantly worse than the resolution of 
projection radiography. The collimating system effectively controls the resolution of this 
imaging system. In crude terms this is given by the diameter D of the minimum sized object 
which may be discriminated as 
D = d(h + L)I h 
(24) 
where h is the length of the collimator's holes, d their diameter, and H the distance between 
the source and collimator. This indicates that using small hole sizes and placing the collimator 
close to the source both improve resolution. Hole sizes for 400 mm diameter Gamma 
Cameras are in the range 2 -3 mm diameter. 
Other forms of Gamma Camera are in use. They use either circular array of detectors or pairs 
of receptors which enable the collection of depth information from nuclear medicine exami- 
nations. 
6.3.3. Isotope Choice 
As was mentioned previously, the isotope used in nuclear medicine has to produce photons of 
a suitable energy. These should normally be of somewhat greater than 100 keV so that they 
are not absorbed to the same degree as would be lower energy photons, and do not suffer from 
Compton scattering to the extent that would photons of significantly higher energies. Further, 
it is obviously desirable to choose an isotope which has a half life of only a few hours so that 
the exposure the patient receives does not significantly exceed the period of examination. 
Equally the isotope when it decays should not be significantly active in its new form before it 
has been thoroughly voided, and it should not cause significant toxic effects. Owing to the 
desire for short isotope lifetimes, any materials must be able to be made in a laboratory close 
to where the patient will be examined. The isotopes used are therefore the immediate 
offspring of longer lived nuclides which may be chemically separated. 
The commonest nuclide used in nuclear medicine is 99Tcm (technetium) which is able to bind 
to a range of biological reagents. Its decay reaction is 
99M~ 13- "~99Tcm-*99Tc + Y 
This means that the parent, Mo (molybdenum) decays by the loss of a nuclear electron ([3 
decay) to produce a metastable form of Tc, which loses its recoil energy as a y. The first decay 
takes place with a half life of 66 hours, and the second with one of six hours. The Mo source 
itself is produced either as a by-product of the fission of uranium or by thermal neutron 
capture with a lighter isotope of Mo. 
The patient dose as a result of a nuclear medicine investigation is very much dependent on the 
nuclide used. Its half life clearly determines how long it may remain active, but the result of 

Imaging Technology 143 
the dose received also depends on how much it is localised on one organ as a result of the 
tagged material being taken up by that organ, and then the rate at which that material is 
metabolised and excreted. Typical doses are in the range 0.1 to 2 mGy; thyroid doses of up to 
500 mGy are likely when radioactive iodine is used. 
6.4. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
MR scanning affords the possibility of scanning volumes of the body in order to map the 
density of hydrogen nuclei. A map of protons in the more loosely bound water molecules in 
tissue can give a good view of the structure of the tissue. The images produced by NMR are of 
very good contrast and high resolution. The apparatus permits the generation of sectional 
images in the same manner as CT, but without the attendant dangers of ionising radiation. The 
physical basis of the magnetic resonance phenomenon was outlined in Chapter 3 above. 
NMR spectroscopy is carried out using a very strong magnetic field. This in itself is not 
known to be particularly hazardous (see the exceptions below), although the field strength is 
sufficient to exert very strong forces on any ferro magnetic materials, such as surgical 
implements, metallic body implants, watches or the like. These may be dangerously acceler- 
ated in the room used for examination, and must be carefully excluded at all times. 
There is also a danger from the field in that it could generate an induced emf in the blood 
stream as a result of the passage of ionic material in the blood which is in the fight sort of 
range to induce depolarisation voltages in the heart. The danger of the static field is, however, 
less than that of sudden removal of the field. There are similar hazards as a result of its sudden 
removal during an emergency shutdown causing a massive rate of change of flux. The 
apparatus must be designed to prevent its shutdown from occurring too quickly even on 
power outage. 
The magnetic field is of sufficient strength for it to require to employ superconducting 
magnets in circumstances where field strengths of greater than 0.3 T are required (compare 
with the strength of the earth's field at about 50 ttT). At the higher fields then the supercon- 
ducting magnet requires to be maintained at liquid helium temperatures (4 K). This causes 
significant problems in the design of the magnet so that it may produce a sufficiently accurate 
field over the volume required for medical measurements whilst at the same time retaining its 
thermal insulation to ensure that the helium remains liquid. 
6.4.1. Image Creation 
The creation of an image from information derived from the NMR effect depends upon 
determining the spatial distribution of resonating particles. As we have seen, the resonant 
frequency is dependent on the strength of the magnetic field B which is used to line up the 
precession of momentum. If we vary the strength of that field over the region of interest, then 
particles in the region will have different resonant frequencies. A stimulating impulse which 
transmits magnetic energy to them of the resonant frequency causes members of the popula- 
tion to resonate. The decay of their resonance may then be measured by the use of a magnetic 
sensor (a coil). 
Recall from Chapter 3 that resonating nuclei decay from their coherent resonance condition in 
a time. This is due to their resonant energy being either returned to the lattice or exchanged 

144 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
with other nuclei. These two processes were characterised by the relaxation times T~ and T 2 
respectively. 
If we wish to excite a group of nuclei experiencing a magnetic field B into a resonance 
condition, then they can be made to precess about the field if excited by a rotating field at their 
resonant frequency. The fastest manner to sweep through a sample of material in order to 
locate the concentration of resonating nuclei is to provide a short burst of energy at their 
resonant frequency. The Fourier Transform of a square impulse was shown in Chapter 5 to be 
the sinc function. Owing to the symmetry of the transform and its inverse, this is the shape of 
the envelope function required to modulate the carrier frequency if we are to obtain a simple 
pulse of energy at the resonant frequency without sidebands. Unfortunately the sinc function 
itself is of infinite bandwidth, but it may be adequately approximated within the bandwidth of 
our measurement system by truncation. The distorting effect of the bandwidth limitation may 
be ameliorated by the use of a damping function. 
We now require to select components of our sample. We do this by imposing a gradient in the 
magnetic field in the direction of the main magnetic field. An outline of the apparatus and 
conventional directions we use is shown in Figure 6.9. This gradient means that each plane 
normal to the gradient has a different resonant frequency. The excitation pulse contains 
frequencies mainly in a small band: these then excite the set of planes with resonant 
frequencies in that range. The gradient field and its effect on the frequency of resonance are 
shown in Figure 6.8. 
B,f 
Figure 6.8 Gradient fields used to select region for excitation. 
The next step is to attempt to differentiate between resonating nuclei in the slice normal to the 
z-axis. This may be done by removing the z-gradient and instead imposing a gradient in 
another direction. For instance the application of a gradient along the x-axis enables the 
selection of nuclei which received energy from the previous excitation pulse. Their frequen- 
cies of resonance are selected by the resulting field including the new gradient. The spectrum 
of frequencies of resonance detected then represents the individual projections. This is 
analogous to the procedure we discussed earlier (in section 6.2.3) when we used a Fourier 
method to reconstruct a tomographic image.

6.4.2. Application of MRI 
The use of magnetic resonance scanners in medical diagnosis is limited substantially by their 
cost. The systems require intrinsically expensive apparatus and high performance computers 
to create images. Owing to their size and weight they may require to be sited in special rooms 
which can tolerate the high mechanical loads imposed. They do, however, provide images of 
a previously unobtainable quality as they rely on a physical process which is not accessible to 
other imaging modalities. Plate 5 is a picture of a currently available commercial scanning 
system. 
The scanners inherently obtain three dimensional image data. This may be presented as a 
longitudinal section through the body, as in plate 6 which shows a sectional view through the 
brain. A view with simulated perspective may also be obtained, as in Plate 7 which should be 
contrasted with the image obtained from the helical computerised tomography scan shown in 
Plate 4. Finally a view may be obtained by processing to provide a surface map of the brain to 
assist in surgical planning as shown in Plate 8. 
Image processing coupled with MRI scanners may be used to recognisc anatomical features, 
such as cardiac structures, and then track their movement. This enables both cardiac stroke 
volume to be measured and other anatomical details such as the cardiac wall thickness to be 
monitored.

6.5. Ultrasound Imaging 
Ultrasound provides in its simplest form the means to obtain a limited amount of structural 
information without exotic technology and with a good degree of patient and operator safety. 
The following sections describe firstly the simplest application of the technology which 
underlies most of the systems employed. We go on to present a description of the systems 
which employ more sophisticated technology to enable the production of images which may 
be more readily interpreted. 
Whilst there are some doubts about the routine use of ultrasonic imaging in pregnancy, the 
present evidence of hazard is disputed. The technique would appear to be inherently reason- 
ably safe: we explore the safety of ultrasound further in Chapter 8. 
6.5.1. A-SCAN 
The A-scan is the simplest form of ultrasonic scanner. It is a pulse echo or Time of Hight 
(TOF) imaging system, in that the time for a signal emitted from a transducer to return is 
related to the distance it has travelled. 
Figure 6.10 Transducer object reflection 
In Figure 6.10 an ultrasonic pulse is transmitted by the transducer into medium 1. It travels 
until reaching medium 2 whereupon part of the wave is reflected and the remainder transmit- 
ted. The reflected wave travels back through the medium and is detected by the transducer. 
Therefore a return echo from the medium arrives time t after the pulse is generated corre- 
sponding to the pulse having travelled distance 2d (there and back). In an imaging situation d 
is not known, but can be calculated if the velocity of the propagating wave is known. 
Therefore assuming the velocity of the medium is v then a returning echo t seconds after pulse 
emission corresponds to an interface located vtl2 metres away from the transducer. 
A schematic of a basic A-scan system is shown in Figure 6.11. Pulses are produced at a rate 
(the Pulse Repetition Frequency, PRF) determined by the impulse generator. The pulses are 
then amplified and excite the transducer. The excitation signal is usually an impulse of 
between 200 V and 300 V. One transducer may be used for both signal generation and 
detection or alternatively two separate transducers may be used. The return signals are 
amplified, filtered, conditioned and then displayed. The dynamic range of the signal following 
amplification may be as high as 100 dB. The return echoes are displayed on an oscilloscope

6.5.1.1. The pulse repetition frequency 
The PRF determines the rate at which pulses are emitted from the transducer. For a maximum 
display intensity this rate should be as high as possible. 
In Figure 6.12 a pulse is transmitted at time zero, causing reflections which will be received 
from the interfaces situated near to the transducer almost immediately and further reflections 
from distant interfaces up to time t seconds later. The echo at t 2 is the echo from the farthest 
interface. Therefore if a second pulse were emitted by the transducer before t 2 then the 
transducer would detect echoes associated with the first pulse whilst also receiving echoes 
from the second pulse. These late echoes from the first pulse would be highly attenuated 
owing to the distances travelled but could be mistaken for weakly reflecting interfaces near to 
the transducer. Therefore for unambiguous detection a second pulse must not be emitted until 
all possible echoes have been received from the furthest possible interface. This sets a limit to 
the maximum pulse repetition frequency 
IJ 
PFR  = 2-7 
where v is the wave velocity in the medium and d is the furthest reflecting interface. 
6.5.1.2. Swept gain control 
When an echo returns from a distant interface it is considerably smaller than an echo returning 
from an interface closer to the transducer. This is due to the attenuation of the wave by the 
tissue through which the pulse travelled. To compensate for this tissue attenuation the gain of

the system is varied. Pulses entering the transducer from interfaces close to the transducer are 
attenuated with respect to pulses entering from a greater depth. Figure 6.13 demonstrates the 
principle. This method of accounting for the tissue attenuation is referred to as a Swept Gain 
function. Swept Gain also helps reduce the likelihood of echoes from an earlier pulse whose 
return time was greater than t 2 being observed, as the system gain is reduced to below the 
level at which they may be detectable. The swept gain function has a dead time in which no 
echoes are displayed. This obscures echoes which originate from interfaces close to the probe 
or from the previous pulse. Generally, reflection from close to the probe (due to skin and 
subcutaneous fat layers) is of no interest. The swept gain section decreases the dynamic range 
of the detected signal between approximately 100 dB and 50 dB. 
6.5.1.3. Display 
The cathode ray tube used for A-scan display has its time base calibrated in tissue depth. Basic 
A-scan systems display the return echoes with no signal processing or detection. However, 
the majority of scanners also provide half and full wave rectified and smoothed displays. The 
three methods of display are depicted in Figure 6.14. The full wave rectified display simpli- 
fies interpretation of the data while observation in all three modes may be required to separate 
multiple echo signals.

6.5.1.4. Imaging problems 
Ultrasound imaging systems rely on the assumption that the time of flight is directly related to 
the depth of the reflecting interface in a straight line from the probe and that the tissue 
propagates ultrasound uniformly. However, the ultrasonic velocity is not constant in the body 
as the differing tissues have different material properties. In addition ultrasound may return to 
the transducer from an interface off the axis of the beam following multiple reflections. 

152 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
1. If an ultrasonic pulse (see Figure 6.15a) is reflected from an interface away from the 
transducer, the pulse suffers a second reflection back towards the transducer. Calculation 
of the depth of the interface from the time of flight will indicate an interface at a greater 
depth than the first interface. 
Figure 6.15 Problems in A-scan imaging 

Imaging Technology 153 
2. If an ultrasound pulse is reflected from an interface which is stepped at an angle to the 
beam, due to the finite width of the ultrasonic beam an elongated pulse will be detected. 
This will make detection of the depth of the interface uncertain (see Figure 6.15b). 
3. An ultrasonic probe could be positioned on the patient's tissue above a pair of strongly 
reflecting interfaces one behind the other. A pulse travels to the first interface and a 
proportion is reflected back to the transducer. The transmitted wave continues and is 
reflected by the second interface. The echo from the second interface partially reflects off 
the first interface and back to the second interface. This process may continue with the 
pulse bouncing back and forth between the two interfaces. At each reflection a proportion 
of the ultrasound is transmitted back to the transducer and is detected. The A-scan will 
therefore detect a series of echoes from the two interfaces (see Figure 6.15c). 
4. A pulse travelling through a refracting medium is bent. If it then impinges upon a strongly 
reflecting interface the returning echo is once again refracted and returns to the transducer. 
The depth of the interface calculated from the time of flight will indicate an interface at a 
depth equal to the trip distance but along the axis of the ultrasound beam (see Figure 6.15d). 
5. If as depicted in Figure 6.16 there is a region of high attenuation preceding an interface, 
then echoes from beyond that region will appear weaker than normal. Alternatively if there 
is a region of low attenuation preceding an interface then echoes from beyond that region 
may appear stronger than normal. In both these situations the body has non uniform 
attenuation which alters the relative size of the echoes (see Figure 6.15e). 
6.5.1.5. Axial resolution 
The axial resolution of an ultrasound scanner defines its ability to differentiate between two 
reflectors on the same axis but separated by a displacement d. Clearly this is largely 
determined by the bandwidth of the transducer, its excitation signal and the detection 
circuitry. 
Figure 6.16 shows the theoretical response of two transducers in both time and frequency 
domains. Transducer (a) is a high Q lightly damped transducer, its time domain response 
shows considerable ringing (continuing oscillations). The response of transducer (b) is wide 
bandwidth and highly damped with a low Q. Figure 6.16 shows the signal received when the 
two transducers are used to detect two reflectors. The highly damped transducer will be able 
to differentiate between the two reflectors at a closer separation than the lightly damped 
transducer. This example demonstrates that for pulse echo imaging the axial resolution is 
dependent on the time domain response of the transducers used. The excitation pulse must 
also have a wide bandwidth to elicit the optimal response from the transducer. Typically the 
excitation pulse is in the order of 100 ns wide. 
6.5.1.6. Interpretation 
The A-scan produces images of all the reflecting structures within the ultrasound beam. If a 
number of interfaces are close together it may be difficult to separate them. The human body 
is a very complicated structure and therefore considerable skill and experience is required to 
interpret the scan. In instances where the expected composition of the body is not known the 
scan may be almost impossible to interpret. 

154 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
6.5.1.7. Modem uses 
The A-scan has been largely replaced by the B-scan. However, there is a number of areas 
where structures are simple enough to be interpreted. 
1. The eye 
The A-scan still finds application in ophthalmology as the eye is a simple structure and 
therefore the A-scan can be interpreted. An A-sear= probe is placed on the end of a 
water-filled tube in contact with the eye (see Figure 6.17). The scan is then performed to 
detect foreign bodies within the optical cavity. 
2. The mid line of the brain 
Following a trauma or perhaps with no prior symptoms, a patient may develop bleeding 
within the skull. The brain is divided in two along the mid sagital plane (see Figure 6.17),

which is referred to as the mid line of the brain. In a case of internal bleeding the build up 
of pressure on one side may cause the mid line to become displaced. This displacement can 
be detected using an A-scan. In this situation again the object under test has a simple 
internal structure as the mass of the brain will appear to be homogeneous. 
Away from the medical field the A-scan is used extensively in Non Destructive Testing 
(NDT), for detecting cracks in uniform materials such as steel and in quality assurance in 
detecting the dimensions of materials. In both of these applications the A-scan device is ideal, 
as the structures are simple and therefore the echo display is easy to interpret. 
6.5.2. B-scan 
B-scan imaging systems essentially consist of an A-scan device which is physically swept 
across the patient's skin. At each position an A-scan is performed, the amplitude of the 
reflection from the various interfaces within the patient is then used to modulate the bright- 
ness of a line on an x-y display. Each separate line is formed by a different A-scan. In this way 
a picture of a section through the patient is developed allowing the shape of the internal 
organs to be reeognised. 
In Figure 6.18 the ultrasound probe is used to transmit a pulse. The resulting echoes from the 
interfaces shown are full wave rectified and used to determine the brightness of the display 
along one line. The ultrasound probe is then moved to scan along the adjacent line and the 
echoes are again used to determine the brightness. 
A schematic of a basic B-scanning system is shown in Figure 6.19. 
The system essentially consists of an A-scan system with the addition of" 
9 position information from the probe. 

156 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Figure 6.18 B-scan image formation 
9 a range compression section. 
9 a display section which combines the position information and the echo signal to form a 
line on the display. 
The position of the probe is determined and fed to the display section where the echo from 
each position is used to generate the x-y display. The detected echo signal following the swept 
gain section has a dynamic range of approximately 50 dB (the ratio of the weakest to the 
strongest echo). The CRT has a dynamic range of approximately 20 dB, hence the echo signal 
is compressed to allow display. This is achieved by using a non linear amplifier, whose gain is 
decreased as the signal amplitude increases. This may be implemented with a logarithmic 
amplifier. 
6.5.2.1. Movement Artefact 
The first B-scan systems developed produced a picture over approximately five minutes; 
during this time the internal organs of the patient and the patient himself may not have 
remained still. Therefore the images obtained were considerably distorted. However, the 
scanning rate of B-scan systems has improved to the extent that the picture may be updated 30 
times a second allowing clear flicker free images and imaging of moving structures. 
The rate at which a B-scan can be performed is determined by the depth to which the scan is 
required. In the A-scan the pulse repetition frequency was limited by the depth of the scan as 
a second pulse could not be generated until all the echoes from the first scan had returned. In 
the B-scan the scanner has to wait for the echo to return from the deepest organ of interest 
before scanning the adjacent line. The entire image must be updated 30 times a second for 
flicker free imaging. Therefore, the pulse repetition frequency is fixed for a given depth and 

Imaging Technology 157 
Figure 6.19 Schematic of B-scan system 
the time for capture of the whole image is also fixed. These two fixed relationships determine 
the number of lines which make up the B-scan image. Hence 
d 
time for one line scan =- 
v 
where d is the depth of the deepest organ of interest and v is the velocity of the wave in the 
tissue. 
Therefore the number of lines which make up one scan is given by vlR • d where R is the 
screen refresh rate. 
6.5.2.2. Sector Scan, Transitional Scan 
There are two forms of scan: the sector scan and the transitional scan (see Figure 6.20). 
In a sector scan the transducer is rotated or rocked about an axis to obtain a sequence of A- 
scan lines at differing angles. The sector scan is probably the most common type of scan. The 
rotating motion is easily achieved and a large internal area of patient can be examined from a 
small surface area in a signal position. Sector scanning also avoids possible problems with 
scanning through a non uniform area of the patient's body as the picture is effectively 
obtained through a single point. 

158 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
In the transitional scan the transducer is moved in a line to produce a rectangular shaped 
picture. The picture is easier to interpret, but access to a larger area of patient is required and 
this makes transitional scanning relatively clumsy. 
If the ultrasound beam meets an interface at an angle the ultrasound may be reflected at an 
angle away from the transducer. In this instance no signal will return to the scanner and 
consequently the interface will not be imaged. This situation can occur with both sector and 
transitional scanning. To overcome this systems have been developed that perform both 
translation and sector scans or a series of sector scans at different translation positions. In this 
way the interface is imaged from two different angles reducing the possibility of reflections 
not reaching the probe. With scanners of this kind the image is developed as the summation of 
the echoes from different angles relating to the same patient position. 
Figure 6.20 Sector/transitional scan 
6.5.2.3. Transducers for B-mode imaging 
1. Fixed focus transducers 
The lateral resolution of a transducer can be improved by focusing the transducer. This can 
be achieved by either using a curved transducer substrate or using an acoustic lens. The 
two situations are depicted in Figure 6.21. Transducers fabricated in this way do not have a 
focal point as such, but are focused over a region referred to as the focal zone. However, 
the lateral resolution beyond the focal zone deteriorates rapidly. 

Imaging Technology 159 
Figure 6.21 Transducer focussing 
2. Linear Array Transducers 
Early transducers for B-mode scanning were moved manually and the position information 
fed to the display section. Subsequently transducers were moved by motors. However, 
transducer development has advanced to make physical movement of the transducer 
unnecessary. 
A linear array transducer is shown in Figure 6.22, which comprises approximately 150 
different transducer elements. A group of approximately 10 elements are excited simulta- 
neously and function as a single transducer. These elements are then used as a group to 
detect the reflected echoes. Following this an adjacent set of transducer elements are 
excited to perform the scan for the following line. In this way a translation scan can be 
performed. If the linear array transducer is formed on a curved substrate then by following 
the same procedure a sector scan can be performed. See Figure 6.22.

The substrate upon which a linear array transducer is fabricated is curved in the plane 
orthogonal to that of the scan to allow a degree of focusing. 
3. Phased array transducers 
A phased array transducer consists of a series of transducer elements as in the linear array 
each of which can be fired separately. If the excitation signal were fed to all elements at the 
same time the transducer would behave as a single large transducer. However, the excita- 
tion signal is delayed in a carefully chosen manner to achieve transducer focusing and 
beam steering. 
Figure 6.23a shows the excitation pulses reaching transducer elements and the subsequent 
emitted ultrasonic pulse waveform. In Figure 6.23b the pulse is steered to the fight by 
using a linearly incremented delay between each transducer element. Similarly in Figure 
6.23c the transducer element delay is configured to produce a beam which is focused to a 
depth d. Figure 6.23d shows a combination of b and c producing a focused beam directed at 
an angle. 
The phased array can also be focused and steered to be maximally sensitive to echoes 
returning from a particular angle: this situation is demonstrated in Figure 6.24. The delay 
of the received echo from each element is adjusted so thata wave entering the transducer 
from the required angle will experience constructive interference while a wave entering 
the transducer at normal incidence will experience destructive interference 
Using a phased array the ultrasonic beam can be steered through a range of angles to 
produce a sector scan and can be focused at any range of interest. 
Electronic focusing of an ultrasonic transducer is effective in one plane only and so the 
transducer is formed from a curved crystal to produce fixed depth focusing in the other plane.

6.6. Doppler Ultrasound 
6.6.1. Introduction 
In section 3.8 we saw that when ultrasound was scattered by a moving object or interface its 
frequency was altered. The change in the frequency was directly proportional to the velocity 
of the scatterer, acting along the axis of the ultrasound beam. The equation defining the 
frequency shift was: 
fd = :J:2"fsV cos 0 
c 
This principle is made use of in the Doppler blood flow meter. When an ultrasound beam is 
incident on a blood vessel a proportion is scattered back along the incident path towards the 
emitting transducer. A Doppler flow meter detects the frequency variations in back scattered 
ultrasound and produces a proportional output. Doppler flow meters are used to assess the 
integrity of the circulation system. There is a variety of other medical devices which employ 
the Doppler principle, namely the foetal heart rate monitor, foetal motion and breathing 
detector and blood pressure measurement. 
6.6.2. The Origin of the Scatter Signal 
Blood has three main constituents, platelets, leukocytes and erythrocytes which are sus- 
pended within plasma. Initially it was thought that incident ultrasound was scattered by the 
individual cells within the plasma. However, models treating cells as individual scatterers 
failed to predict the scatter observed. More recent theories consider the scatter to originate 
from variations in the compressibility and density of blood due to pressure fluctuations during 
the cardiac cycle. 
6.6.3. Continuous Wave Doppler Instrument 
The first and probably the most commonly used Doppler device is the continuous wave flow 
meter shown below in Figure 6.25. 
The oscillator produces a sine wave of the required frequency which is amplified and fed to 
the transducer. The transducer is driven by the amplifier at approximately 10 volts, in sharp 
contrast to the hundreds of volts used to excite transducers in imaging applications. In the 
continuous wave flow meters the signal is continuously transmitted and so high peak levels 
are not required to produce the required signal power. 
As the ultrasound signal is continuously transmitted a separate transducer is used to detect 
scatter. The received signal is then fed to a high frequency amplifier and demodulated. The 
demodulated signal is then either detected aurally by the operator or its frequency variations 
are detected and displayed. 
The continuous wave flow meter detects frequency shifts from any moving scatterer or 
interface in the ultrasonic beam. Therefore, frequency shifts are detected from the relative 
movement of the probe and the patient and from moving interfaces within the body such as 
organ or blood vessel walls.

6.6.3.1. Transducer operating frequency 
Doppler transducers are designed to resonate. The piezo electric element within the trans- 
ducer is air backed allowing an un-damped high Q response. The Doppler probe consists of 
both transmitting and receiving transducers, which may be fabricated on the same piezo 
electric element. 
The Doppler shift is directly proportional to the ultrasound carrier frequency. Therefore, to 
obtain a maximised frequency shift, it would be advantageous to use a high transmission 
frequency. Unfortunately the attenuation of ultrasound increases with increasing frequency, 
although the amount of scatter from the blood increases with frequency to the fourth power. 
Hence, when determining the ultrasound frequency for a particular application these three 
factors must be considered. Figure 6.26 indicates the application for a range of frequencies of 
ultrasound and operating depth.

To obtain a degree of range discrimination the acoustic fields of the transmitting and receiving 
transducers overlap at the intended scanning depth. The transducers are focused for this 
depth. This reduces the interference from moving interfaces outside the intended region.

Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
6.6.3.2. Demodulation Techniques 
The back scattered Doppler signal is centred at the frequency of the transmitted ultrasound 
(sometimes referred to as the carrier frequency). It is possible to detect the Doppler frequency 
variations by processing signals directly at this frequency. The system required is simplified if 
the signal is modulated to a lower frequency. All commercially available Doppler flow meters 
mix the Doppler signal with another high frequency to obtain a lower frequency shift signal. 
The Doppler signal at the carrier frequency contains information about the velocity of the 
scatterers and their direction. The Doppler shift is either positive or negative equating to flow 
towards or away from the ultrasound probe. In some Doppler imaging situations it is 
advantageous to determine the direction of flow. Doppler demodulation techniques can be 
considered as either preserving or destroying this directional information. 
6.6.4. Modulation 
Multiplication of a signal by a sinusoid shifts the original message by the frequency of the 
sinusoid: the process is known as amplitude modulation. Amplitude modulation can be 
explained by examining the resulting spectra. 
If we define a signal g(t) such that 
g(t) ~ G(o~) 
The multiplication of g(t) by e im~ is equivalent to a frequency shift of COo. Hence: 
g(t)e iwot ~ G(oo-eo o) 
The modulating signal cos COot in exponential notation is: 
1 (eiCOot e-iO~ot 
COSO)ot = ~ 
* 
) 
so multiplying, we obtain 
g(t)cosO~ot = l(g(t)ei| 
+ g(t)e -i=~ 
then 
g(t)coscOot e-~ l(G(m+ O~o)+ G(o~- O)o) ) 
Hence multiplication of g(t) by cos mo produces a scaled copy of the message signal centred at 
co :!: co o- For a fuller explanation, see, for instance, Lathi (1983). 
6.6.5. Non Directional Demodulators 
The simplest form of signal demodulation is direct multiplication with the oscillator signal. 
This form of modulation shifts the signal by the carrier signal producing a copy of the signal 
centred about the axis. This produces a low frequency copy of the signal. However, this 
method of demodulation loses the directional information as the demodulated signal is 
composed of both forward and reverse flow information. 

Imaging Technology 165 
6.6.6. Directional Demodulators 
The three commonly used demodulation methods which preserve directional information are 
quadrature, side band and heterodyne. 
1. In quadrature demodulation the back scattered signal is fed to two demodulators. One 
demodulator is also fed with the carrier signal whilst the other is fed with the carrier signal 
phase shifted by 90 ~ This process produces two demodulated channels referred to as the in 
phase and quadrature channels respectively. Each channel contains forward and reverse 
flow information. 
2. In side band demodulation the back scattered signal is fed to two sections each of which 
contains a filter and a demodulator. In one section the signal is filtered by a high pass filter 
centred at the carrier frequency and then demodulated by the carrier. In the other section 
the signal is fed to a low pass filter centred at the carrier frequency and then demodulated. 
This produces two channels one of which contains the forward flow information with the 
other containing the reverse flow information. 
3. The heterodyne demodulator multiplies the back scattered signal by a sine wave of lower 
frequency than the carder. This produces a copy of the Doppler signal situated at the 
difference frequency between the carrier and the demodulation frequency. For instance if 
the demodulator signal is 20 kHz lower than the carrier then the Doppler signal will be 
centred at 20 kHz. The signal is at a convenient low frequency for detection. 
6.6.7. Detection Techniques 
Following demodulation the Doppler waveform is detected to determine the frequency 
information. The simplest method of achieving uses a zero crossing detector. 
The zero crossing detector relates the number of times the Doppler signal crosses the zero line 
to the instantaneous frequency. In a Doppler system there is significant noise. The zero 
crossing detector therefore is set to detect crossings of a threshold level above zero, so that no 
crossings are detected when there is no received Doppler signal. 
The Doppler signal originates from a number of scatterers moving with a range of velocities; 
hence the zero crossing detector produces an output which is effectively the RMS value of the 
Doppler frequency at any instant. The performance of zero crossing detectors is poor in the 
high noise environments encountered by Doppler flow meters. 
Developments in computer hardware have made real time computation of the frequency 
spectra of the Doppler signal possible. The Doppler back scattered signal is transformed to the 
frequency domain using a Fast Fourier Transform (section 5.2.2). This method of detection 
allows the contribution from all scatter to be displayed rather than the average or RMS value 
of the waveform. The computation is performed by computer or specialised Digital Signal 
Processing hardware. The three co-ordinates which need to be simultaneously displayed are 
time, frequency and spectral amplitude. The display x axis correlates with time and the y axis 
with frequency: the spectral amplitude is displayed as the brightness or the colour of the co- 
ordinate.

Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
6.6.8. Pulsed Wave Instrument 
Using a Continuous Wave or Doppler flow meter the blood flow from a vessel located behind 
another vessel moving interface cannot easily be studied. Despite the discrimination provided 
by the transducer configuration the Doppler signal from unintended scatter cannot be sepa- 
rated from the desired target. This severely limits the range of application of Doppler flow 
meters. To overcome this the pulsed Doppler flow meter has been developed. 
Pulsed Doppler flow meters use both the ideas of ultrasonic pulse echo imaging and the 
Doppler flow meter. A signal is transmitted in a short burst. Signals originating from the 
required tissue depth are selected by their time of flight. The return signal is then demodu- 
lated and detected. 
The pulsed Doppler flow meter provides information about the blood velocity from a defined 
depth. This is achieved by transmitting a pulsed signal rather than a continuous wave. A 
schematic of a pulsed Doppler flow meter is shown below in Figure 6.27. The meter basically 
combines the A-scan and the continuous wave flow meter. 
Gated sine waves are generated and following amplification are fed to the transmitting 
transducer. The sine wave pulse is emitted and travels through the tissue. As the pulse travels 
ultrasound is reflected back to the receiving transducer. The received ultrasound is frequency 
shifted if the interface or scatterer moves relative to the probe.

The signal received time t after the emission of the pulse originates from a tissue at a depth 
defined in section 6.5.1. Time t after the emission of the pulse the gated sine wave is fed to the 
demodulator. Therefore the signal originating from the required depth of tissue is demodu- 
lated. The output of the demodulator is zero except when the demodulator pulse is received. 
Therefore the demodulator output represents the Doppler signal from the required tissue 
depth after t seconds. The output of the demodulator is fed to a sample and hold circuit, which 
maintains the level until the next pulse is transmitted to the demodulator. In this way the 
output of the sample and hold amplifier is updateA at the pulse repetition frequency. 
The frequency variations of the demodulated wave are detected using the methods described 
for continuous wave insmunents. 
6.6.9. The RangeVelocity Ambiguity Function 
The pulsed Doppler flow meter effectively samples the velocity of blood at the pulse 
repetition frequency. The Doppler waveform obtained has a frequency content determined by 
the velocity of the blood. The Nyquist Sampling Theorem states that the sampling rate must 
be a minimum of twice the maximum frequency component of the sampled signal. Therefore, 
the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) must be twice the maximum frequency of the Doppler 
waveform (i.e. the sample and hold amplifier output). 
The maximum frequency that can be unambiguously determined is equal to half the PRF 
therefore 
PRF = 4fsVC~

6.6.10. The Duplex Doppler Scanner 
The Duplex Doppler scanner combines a B-scan system with a pulsed Doppler flow meter. 
Clinically the operator is able to view a section of a patient using the B-scan system. If a blood 
vessel is identified for investigation, the operator can set the co-ordinates from the B-scan 
image to perform a Doppler A-scan. A Duplex Scanning System is shown in Figure 6.28. The 
pulsed Doppler investigation may be performed with the same transducer as the B-scan. 
However, this necessitates that the B-scan is interrupted for the duration of this investigation. 
Therefore modern systems have separate B-scan and Doppler transducers as shown. Both are 
phased arrays which can be directed and focused within the patient.

Computing 
Computers and microprocessors are increasingly embedded in medical apparatus. Their use 
ranges from their appearance in data acquisition systems used in Intensive Therapy Units to 
Computer Based Patient Record systems used in primary care. We will examine some of the 
technical aspects of this use and look at the impact it will increasingly place on requirements 
for data security and archiving. 
The desire to automate simple or repetitive tasks is natural. If technology is available which 
can undertake tasks in a reliable manner without tiring, the need for tea breaks or complaint, 
then why not use it? Automation clearly presents opportunities, and as technological develop- 
ment proceeds, the incorporation of microprocessors into equipment where previously there 
was specialised hardware becomes economically attractive. 
This simplistic view can lead to problems. It may be attractive if you are a manufacturer of 
microprocessors to maximise the scope of their use. However, the ability to obtain and record 
information should not imply that it is either worthwhile or desirable. When patient records 
are obtained, it is desirable to retain the information for a period of perhaps several years to 
ensure that any need to reinterpret the data can be met subsequently. The tendency with paper 
records obtained manually is to seek only that information required on a fairly short term 
basis. Computers may afford the means to record vastly more data, such as continuously 
monitoring a patient's ECG and other physiological data. It is worth questioning how fine the 
detail of retained information should be. 
Another aspect of computerised data handling relates to data security. Increasingly, and for 
good reasons, computers are connected to networks. Their connectivity means that there is a 
finite risk of the confidential data they hold on a patient being subjected to unauthorised 
access. This might come about either by deliberate and malicious attempts to access the data, 
or by inadvertent disclosure by an authorised computer user. Malicious access can largely be 
prevented by adequate system design: unfortunately many popular systems at present in use 
offer no data protection. The problem of inadvertent disclosure is potentially more difficult to 
avoid, since it requires understanding of the nature of both the information held and of any 
computer network's capability by users of private data.

Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
7.1. Classification of Computers 
Computers have traditionally been classified into different types, such as minicomputers, 
mainframes and Personal Computers (PCs). The distinction between these types is to a large 
degree blurred. Possibly a better differentiation relates to machine cost. The purpose of 
classification is to enable the description of the machines' performance in the broadest sense. 
The following sections of this chapter examine facilities which are appropriate to some 
machine types but not necessarily others. 
For our purposes, we consider a mainframe computer as one which affords a wide range of 
facilities for concurrent data processing and management. It would be able readily to connect 
to networks probably without seriously compromising the machine's performance. The 
machine would be expected to be able to hold large databases and provide proper control of 
their access. This sort of machine would normally not be appropriate to undertake real time 
data acquisition. Most of all, mainframe machines are expecte~ to be expensive: this may 
make their purchaser feel good. 
Personal computers have for a number of years been based on microprocessors. The Intel 
architecture has dominated the market since it was adopted by IBM for their machines in the 
early 1980s. Rivals exist based on the Motorola 68000 series of microprocessor. If we 
disregard for now their relative merits, the striking shared characteristics are simple operation 
and cost effective processing. As the machines are targeted at the cheapest market sector, they 
are rather weak in the sort of facilities used by technical programmers. They are, however, 
viable for use by an individual, often costing little more than the hardware needed just to 
access a mainframe class computer. On their own, their data protection facilities range from 
non-existent to minimal, effectively precluding their use with highly confidential data. One 
should of course bear in mind that the security of a computer system is unlikely to be any 
better than the lock on the door which prevents it being stolen! 
Somewhere in between these classifications reside minicomputers and personal workstations. 
If these may be separately identified, they offer more sophisticated facilities than PCs, 
particularly in aspects of data integrity and security. The software development facilities are 
typically much more advanced for reasons which should become apparent. Either minicom- 
puters or PCs are likely to be found in roles involving real time data acquisition, where the 
data gathering function is likely to be handled by a dedicated microprocessor in most 
commercially developed apparatus. 
7.2. Outline of Computer Architecture 
The architectural description of a computer is used to define the machine's structure. It 
presents a rather different view of the machine from its simple classification. The description 
comprises definitions of the machine's interfaces at a number of points of interest. Taking a 
view of the whole system, it must encompass both the machine's hardware and software. The 
definition is likely to be modular, with each component taking in a different aspect of the 
machine of defining its interfaces with different degrees of complexity. 
For example, from the viewpoint of a programmer who wishes to provide support for new 
interface hardware, the starting point would probably be the machine's instruction set. This 
defines the operations that the processor may perform under program control. This program- 

Computing 171 
mer will need to know technical details such as how the machine's address space is laid out 
and how to access device registers. If the new hardware is to be usable, it may need to be 
accessed by other programs, so a thorough description of interfacing the machine's input and 
output to the operating system is also required. 
A different example would be of a programmer who required to define an application which 
was required to search for items in a database. This programmer would be concerned with the 
format and sequence of data exchange requests to ensure that the database was properly 
updated and could remain consistent. 
Neither of these activities should in principle require a knowledge of the implementation of 
the underlying hardware and software. They both require details at an appropriate level of the 
machine's interfaces and control mechanisms. The following sections are intended to clarify 
the nature of this sort of description in a manner appropriate for the major applications of 
computers in medicine. 
Another viewpoint in the classification of types of computer system uses a modular descrip- 
tion of a machine. However, in this analysis we do not examine the machine's components: 
instead our task is to split it into a number of levels of abstraction or complexity. For instance, 
an electronics engineer may view a computer in terms of the logic gates from which it is 
constructed. A FORTRAN programmer would see little at that level, but may well know about 
the machine's overall performance and the usefulness of its program libraries. Another 
equally valid view of a system would be of its capacity to undertake the sort of transactions 
required to support a seat reservation system. These various viewpoints (the list is not 
exhaustive) regard computing systems in terms of 'levels of interpreter' (Figure 7.1) as they 
are task oriented, rather than specifically technology based.

172 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
7.2.1. Hardware 
The hardware of a computer for our purposes comprises its electronic circuits. A typical 
structural overview of a simple computer, such as a PC or a minicomputer, is shown in Figure 
7.2. In this level of description, all of the input output controllers and the processor are 
regarded as simple hardware functions. In fact in many cases they may themselves be 
constructed from components which themselves contain further microprocessors. The proces- 
sor itself may be built from simple logic sub circuits which must be programmed in order to 
function with the computer's defined instruction set. 
The components we have identified in Figure 7.2 are outlined in the following sections.

7.2.1.1. Processor 
The processor, or CPU, executes instructions. This is the central component of the computer 
which arbitrates and co-ordinates the operation of all other components. The instructions 
which the processor can undertake define its primary characteristics. They are received by the 
processor as binary encoded patterns in a sequence to control the operation of the machine. A 
programmer who requires to use the machine's instructions directly will normally do so 
through mnemonic representations of the instructions. 

Computing 173 
The complexity of function of computer instructions is something which has varied over the 
years owing to the changing benefits of the increasing density of electronic circuits which 
may be built. In other words, the degree of integration, or the complexity of circuit which 
could be laid down on a single silicon device has rapidly increased. However, optimal design 
strategies for a given level of technology do not always follow on from those of an earlier 
generation in a straightforward evolutionary manner as constraints are lifted. For instance, by 
the late 1960s, it was usual for a computer instruction set to contain a fairly wide range of 
operations which were aimed at simplifying the task of generating machine instructions from 
programs written in high level languages, such as FORTRAN. This approach to instruction set 
design leads to the need to decode separately each instruction, and imposes high costs for 
developing sufficient logic using small scale circuits. This problem may be overcome by the 
use of micro programmed machines which are in essence built from very simple, but fast and 
flexible logic machines with limited capabilities. They are enhanced to provide the intended 
level of architectural support by the use of a 'Micro program' in very fast access memory 
local to the processor. This sort of approach was commonly used in the computers developed 
in the decade from the mid 1970s. This approach is known as the Complex Instruction Set 
(CISC). 
An alternative is to develop a computer without an internal micro program. Instructions are 
directly enacted by the machine's logic in a single machine cycle. This means that the area of 
the processor is used entirely for supporting its real instructions without the overhead of 
control and decoding logic for another level of architecture. This is known as Reduced 
Instruction Set fRISC) architecture. The machine's performance for single instructions is 
therefore optimised at the loss of sophistication of the instruction set. The result is that more 
work has to be undertaken by high level language compilers in optimising the code they 
generate: it nevertheless typically contains more instructions than CISC, but performance 
with the same generation of electronic technology is nowadays generally better. 
7.2.1.2. Memory 
The computer's memory is nowadays made from Random Access Memory chips. At the time 
of writing, most semiconductor manufacturers supply devices which can store a maximum of 
4 Mbits of data which is addressable in eight bit units. This packing density has quadrupled 
every three years for the past 20 since silicon memories generally replaced magnetic core 
memories on computers. 
The memory devices are accessed by the processor via its interconnect (see section 7.2.1.3). 
The amount of data read by the CPU in a single request depends on the nature of the machine. 
Typically however, computer designers ensure that data are moved in larger units than the 
program strictly requested, since most programs are highly loealised in their memory ac- 
cesses. The time taken to move eight bits of data would certainly be as long as that required to 
access the typical 32bit width of common computer interconnects. 
The memory chips are therefore interfaced to the interconnect via their own controller which 
is responsible for managing a degree of error checking and ensuring that data are presented to 
the computer in the correct sequence and observe the mechanisms required by the interconnect. 
Most modem computers, including PCs, define their memory in several levels. The most 
expensive, and fastest memory is logically closest to the processor where it may be accessed 
with the minimum overhead. This memory is normally accessible by the computer in about 

174 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
one processor clock cycle. It is not normally therefore accessed via the interconnect. This is 
known as 'cache' memory which relies again on the localisation of both instructions and data. 
It is copied from the main memory when an access request cannot be directly satisfied: 
copying of the cache's contents back to the main memory is clone differently on different 
machines. Typically programs read much more data (and instructions) than they write data 
(by about a factor of ten), so processing delays are not apparent when data are returned to 
main memory from the cache. 
The time to access main memory is typically several times slower than that of the cache, but if 
the cache size is adequate for the application, then 'hit rates' (the probability of locating data 
in cache rather than having to look in main memory) of around 95% may be expected. This 
strategy both ensures that the cost of memory may be minimised by purchasing only a small 
quantity of the highest cost memory, but it also favourably impacts on the cost of the 
computer's interconnect which would otherwise have to carry much higher traffic between 
processor and memory. 
7.2.1.3. Interconnect 
The computer requires a pathway to enable data and control information to be transferred 
between its various components. The form of the pathway varies between simple busses on 
PCs and most minicomputers to larger switching structures with multiple paths and redundant 
structures on mainframes. Clearly the more sophisticated structures cost much more to 
implement. 
Of primary interest here are bus interconnects. These provide the ability to send and receive 
data and addresses. They are normally multiplexed (i.e. shared by switching between activi- 
ties) on a demand basis. A device which requires to send information to another on the bus 
must first obtain bus ownership from the master (normally interface electronics in the 
processor). When it has been granted ownership it is permitted to use the bus for a period. 
Some busses require that a device shall relinquish ownership after a predefined period to 
prevent a single device from dominating its bandwidth. 
Having obtained the bus, the device then must indicate where the data are to be sent to or 
received from by asserting the address of the other device on the bus. Some busses have 
sufficient lines to permit this operation in parallel with data transfer, others do not. The 
responding device is then required to enact the read or write request and acknowledge via the 
bus protocol that it has done so. 
Data may be sent to the processor via one of several mechanisms. In the simplest case, all 
major actions are taken by the processor which addresses the required device to examine its 
status. If it is ready for data transfer, then the processor may move the data it desires to the 
device's output register. If not, it may loop until the device is ready. This procedure is clearly 
wasteful of the processor's time if it is able to undertake another task at that time instead of 
waiting. 
An alternative is to allow the device to provide notification of its status change to the 
processor as soon as it happens, and without the processor constantly having to monitor it 
through instructions. In this case, the device asserts an 'interrupt' line: the processor may then 
'grant' the interrupt at a convenient point in its instruction stream. The device identifies itself 
typically if this mechanism is used by placing an address on the bus to tell the processor where 
to find an 'interrupt service routine'. The service routine is entered by the processor only once 

Computing 175 
its previous state has been saved. This routine permits the processor to examine the device and 
undertake a few simple tasks such as noting the change of device state and moving the 
transferred data before it resumes its previous operation from its saved state. 
Many machines permit a further level of sophistication which is necessary for devices which 
need to transfer large amounts of data to or from memory quickly and with a minimum 
overhead on the processor. These might be discs or network devices. The use of Autonomous 
Input and Output, or Direct Memory Access (DMA), permits that transfer of a block of data 
for each interrupt to the processor. The device which performs DMA must be more sophisti- 
cated than one which performs its operations entirely under processor control. It must be able 
to move data to or from the set of memory locations defined by the processor in sequence and 
must obtain bus bandwidth in the correct manner to avoid disturbance to the machine's overall 
performance. The processor having started a DMA operation, normally passes responsibility 
for its completion to the device. The device interrupts the processor on completion when it 
provides information again about its status. 
7.2.1.4 Disc Drive 
Computer discs provide bulk storage for data. Most current discs use magnetic media for 
storage of data as it provides a means for reasonably stable non-volatile data storage, at a high 
density. Most modern high density discs are built from a set of platters coated with a magnetic 
oxide film which rotate at high speed inside a dust free environment. Information is read from 
and written to the surface by recording heads mounted on a swivelling arm which permits the 
heads to fly at around 0.2 gm above the disc surface. (Compare this with the thickness of a 
human hair at around 40 gm.) 
The size and number of the platters depends both on the age of the disc technology and its 
intended purpose. At the time of writing, the most advanced technology drives are being built 
for PCs. They have the highest data packing densities and occupy the smallest space. The 
leading edge producers for these are moving away from constructing disc platters of 3.5 
inches in diameter to around 1.5 inches, and accompanying this with a change in platter 
material from aluminium to glass, owing to the latter's lower ductility. 
In the more sophisticated market of mainframe discs where higher standards of availability 
are required, current discs are of 5.25 diameter platter, rotate at 5400 r.p.m, and store about 
3.5 GB of data. Quoting figures like these quickly dates any book! However, the points in 
principle to note concern how data are accessed on the media and the causes of delay in 
locating data. The impact of disc access should be understood in regard to the later discus- 
sions about filing systems and databases. 
A disc is normally divided into a number of 'sectors' which store data. Each sector contains 
both the user data block and information which is used only by the disc's control electronics to 
validate the data. Sectors are arranged in circular 'tracks' around the disc. A set of tracks 
vertically but not laterally separated is called a 'cylinder', so the number of tracks comprising 
a cylinder depends on the number of recording surfaces. Data are stored then in sectors which 
are themselves stored on tracks on a particular surface. Many computers now distance the 
central processor from this knowledge of the disc's layout by referring only to a 'logical' disc 
whose sectors are numbered in sequence from 0 to the disc capacity. The sector size is 
dependent on the machine's organisation, but is typically between 512 and 4096 bytes. 

176 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Access to data on disc when we know its location requires both rotation of the disc and 
movement of the recording head. The rotational movement, the 'latency', depends on the 
speed of rotation of the disc spindle: for a typical disc drive which rotates at 3600 r.p.m., this 
is 8.3 ms on average (half the rotational period). The time to move the head is controlled by 
the amount the head has to move, its inertial moment, and the dynamics of its actuating 
system. The time to settle on a track is therefore very varied, but current systems exhibit times 
of around 10 ms. Not surprisingly this time is reduced with reductions in disc dimensions, 
although the fine settling time is adversely affected by increasing storage density. 
The result of these factors is that the performance of a disc in terms of its data rate is more 
controlled by its physical movement than by the inherent data rate which the recording head 
may sustain. Most operating systems support files which are diseontiguous (see section 
7.2.6). The result is that when reading a file, a number of movements will occur. Whilst the 
read/write rates supported by the disc head may be greater than 2 MBs -~, few systems can 
achieve data rates of half that value in practice owing to file fragmentation. 
The performance of a disc system may also be significantly affected by providing two forms 
of improvement in the control electronics. Firstly, we may take advantage of locality of data, 
whereby adjacent sectors frequently need to be read. The simplest method is to provide some 
local storage on the disc controller which makes it possible to read data on either side of the 
sector requested, and possibly the whole of a track. The data are retained by the controller 
until a request arrives for the additionally read sector, but may then be returned to the 
requester without the mechanical delays described above. Secondly, the movement of the disc 
head may be optimised to take advantage of the reduced seek time required when its 
movement is minimised. In this case the control electronics re-order read and write requests to 
optimise disc head movement. Any practical system which provides this speed up, which can 
improve throughput by around 30%, has to be sufficiently capable to prevent excessive 
deterioration in performance seen by requests for data away from areas of high request 
density. 
The other commonly encountered disc technology uses flexible media. Since the mid 1970s a 
number of physical disc sizes have been used with increasing densities of storage, and 
significant performance and reliability improvements. A plastic disc is used which is coated 
with a magnetic oxide film: the read/write head contacts the surface of the disc. Clearly if the 
media may be exposed to dirt and temperature fluctuations, there is plenty of scope for 
misalignments and other errors, so the recording density is many orders of magnitude worse 
than that of a hard disc drive. To avoid excessive abrasion, the rotational rate of floppy disc 
drives is also kept small, and the resulting data rate is much smaller than that of a hard drive. 
However, floppy discs can be useful cheap data interchange media, even if their capacity 
remains irritatingly too low to be of use for other purposes. 
7.2.1.5. Parallel Port 
The description of the interconnect above should give some idea of the complications of using 
it directly for input and output. Ultimately, it is obviously the means by which data are moved 
to and from the computer's memory or disc. The complications of using it directly, and the 
chaos caused by its misuse mean that it is almost always necessary to provide separate 
interface devices which access the interconnect on behalf of the user. Furthermore a well 
specified interface may provide a user view of the computer which is convenient and can be 
reproduced when other underlying busses are employed. 

Computing 177 
The purpose of the parallel port on a computer is to provide this independence of the bus 
protocols and architecture. The parallel port provided on most PCs is intended normally to 
enable the connection of a printer. The port is therefore able to read and write data in eight bit 
units in parallel. It has control and status lines which make both the user and the computer 
aware of the port's status and enable flow control to be implemented. 
7.2.1.6. Serial Port 
Serial ports are frequently provided on computers to enable data transfer on a pair, or more 
often two pairs of wires. Data bits are transmitted and received in sequence either at a 
predefined rate or alongside a clocking signal. This form of communication originated in 
essence long before electronic computers with telegraphy. This section is intended to outline 
the mechanisms used in respect of the computer: a later section looks at more details 
regarding access to public data networks which use similar facilities. 
The computer's serial port provides the facility to convert information presented in a parallel 
form on the Interconnect into the serial bit stream used externally. This form of connection is 
suitable when data must be transferred over longer distances than can readily be handled by 
the output stages of logic chips. As this is a frequent requirement a range of support devices is 
available to provide the required functionality. 
Serial data are frequently transferred in characters, of typically eight bits in length, with self 
framing information provided by start and stop delimiters. This mechanism, known as 
asynchronous data transfer, is suitable when small amounts of data are to be transferred or 
when the data require immediate interpretation, such as when a computer uses keyboard input 
to update an editor's screen continuously. 
An alternative scheme is to transfer messages of greater length (normally between 128 and 
4096 bytes) without separation between the bytes. In this case, synchronous data transfer, the 
data frame is delimited with header and trailer patterns. The bit timing is defined by separate 
clock pulses which are exchanged between the two parties transferring data. 
In either of the above cases, the connection of the serial port to the outside world is somewhat 
more complicated than it has been represented so far. The port's interface is presented as a 
number of connections which obey the rules of one of the standards such as RS-232 or RS- 
423. These define a number of 'circuits' each of which carries certain signals, such as 
received data, transmitted data and perhaps clocks. There are also circuits for exchanging 
information about the state of the interface which may be used for flow control or managing 
connections. The interface standards define the requirements for the signals' timing and 
voltage levels, hopefully to enable devices supplied by different manufacturers to communi- 
cate. Unfortunately some of the earlier standards in this area leave something to be desired as 
they have sufficient scope for interpretation that not all compliant devices will invariably 
connect. The topic of network connection and standards is covered in more detail in section 7.4. 
7.2.2. Operating System 
Computer hardware in itself is next to useless. To perform functions on behalf of its user it 
must have programs loaded and running. If it is to communicate the results of its work to the 
outside world, it must undertake input and output. The earliest computers had hardware which 
supported the minimum of in-built functionality for this communication. The program which 
undertook the initial loading of programs required to be entered manually via switches. 

178 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Frequently after the user program was loaded, it needed to contain all of the instructions 
required to control the hardware to generate output. Fairly early in their development, this sort 
of function was standardised for each developed machine. The repetitive tasks of ensuring 
that the machine's hardware was properly controlled was delegated to a supervisory program 
which had the responsibility for loading programs and scheduling work. This idea has 
progressed so that now Operating Systems provide many of the common functions used on 
computers avoiding the need for their constant redevelopment. Operating Systems them- 
selves are to some extent standardised, so that the user application may be run on very 
different hardware without change as the System provides a sufficient interfacing layer to 
obscure the underlying distinctions. 
Having taken on the role of isolating the user's applications from the underlying hardware 
mechanisms, the Operating System may be placed in a supervisory role where it is the 
guardian of the machine's resources. This has the effect of ensuring that the machine's 
hardware resources are effectively used and fairly shareat between concurrently running 
applications. The System grants the user program ordered access to Input and Output devices, 
seeking to ensure that the requirements of different users do not conflict. It similarly allocates 
memory in a manner which should ensure that the operating system's own integrity is not 
compromised and that other applications' data are not inadvertently or maliciously accessed. 
A goal of the operating system of a complex computer should be to ensure that the machine's 
resources are used in a manner which maximises their use by applications. This is the 
scheduling function which is discussed in more detail in section 7.2.5. 
7.2.3. Input and Output Mechanisms 
Control of input and output is one of the major functions of an operating system. It is essential 
that the system supervises this function for two crucial reasons. Firstly, it is the duty of the 
operating system to allocate the computer's memory resources. Since an input output device 
must be able to move data to any part of the machine's memory, the transfer must be 
undertaken by a component of the operating system. Secondly, and of equal importance, the 
provision of an interface to the input and output facilities of the computer by the operating 
system means that the details of data transfer may be largely obscured from the user. The 
transfer may be directed to a genetic device, rather than to a specific location. This means that 
programs may be used in differing environments without modification to take account of 
trivial differences in configuration. 
7.2.4. Protection 
If the supervisory functions of a computer operating system are to be relied upon, then they 
must be able to control how the resources of the machine are accessed and allocated. User 
programs, if they are to behave properly need to able to verify that the data areas which they 
access are those intended. 
A common scheme which provides the ability to support these functions is to implement in 
the computer's hardware a differentiation between two or more 'levels of access'. The inner 
mode, often known as 'kernel mode', is able to undertake the machine's full instruction set, 
and is normally defined by the operating system to have controlling access to the machine's 
memory and other resources. The outermost mode (frequently called the 'user mode') is 
restricted in the memory accesses it makes to those which were permitted by kernel mode 

Computing 179 
code. It is also unable to undertake the hardware instructions which change the machine's 
state, and particularly those which directly alter the access mode. 
By defining a hierarchy of access, the operating system may ensure that only permitted 
accesses are made to memory, and that those which were not are handled appropriately by the 
operating system. 
This sort of scheme must be implemented on any usable multi user or multi tasking system, 
since otherwise the failure of one application is able to affect other applications detrimentally. 
It is not implemented on MS-DOS since the system architecture owes its origins to early 
microprocessor technology which did not contain adequate facilities for its support. 
7.2.5. Scheduling 
In multi tasking and multi user systems, the operating system is responsible for deciding how 
to order work. In these systems, separate tasks are normally referred to as processes. At any 
time a number of processes is likely to be waiting for the completion of an Input or Output 
request. This can either be because it is waiting for user response to a previous operation, or 
perhaps the relatively low speed of disc access (several 10s of milliseconds to access data) by 
comparison with the machine's instruction speed (perhaps around 10 million per second). The 
function of ensuring that both the processor and input/output resource utilisation are maxim- 
ised is handled by the operating system's scheduler. Apart from the goal of seeking to 
maximise utilisation, a system will normally be designed to ensure that the variation in 
response time seen by different processes is minimised. 
Several methods of work scheduling are in common use. The simplest allows a process to use 
the CPU either until it is blocked by the need to wait for input or output, or until it has used a 
quantum of processor time. When one of these conditions is met, the blocked task is placed at 
the end of the worklist, and the context used by the processor is switched to the next process 
in the list of eligible tasks. The time quantum is chosen to achieve a balance between the 
overhead of switching between tasks and ensuring that all tasks in the worklist receive some 
attention within a reasonable period. 
This scheme may be enhanced by assigning priorities to the computer's processes. The 
machine will then activate the highest priority available task. In some systems, the priority is 
dynamically controlled. Processes receive a boost to their priority when certain events occur, 
such as the completion of input. Such a process is statistically most likely to require a small 
amount of service before again blocking through undertaking further input. This strategy 
therefore can help achieve increased input/output rates with fairly little detriment to the 
computational performance. 
Scheduling of work in a computer also takes place at the level in the machine of interrupt 
service. This form of scheduling is largely controlled by hardware events which require time 
critical service to avoid data loss owing to a further event occurring which causes overwriting. 
7.2.6 Filing Systems 
Computer disc systems are intended to store large amounts of data. The data are normally 
organised into units of files which may contain sets of related items, such as a document (this 
chapter is one such), or an executable program. For a modern computer to be usable, there is 
likely to be a very large number of files stored on any given disc volume. To make the 

180 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
individual files reasonably accessible they are listed in directories by their name. Most 
systems permit directories to be defined within other directories (they are sub-directories). 
This overall strategy permits an ordered definition of the data held on the computer's filing 
system so that the data required by a user may readily be accessed via a logical path. This 
section describes in outline the organisation of one form of filing system, so that the use of 
individual files may subsequently be contrasted with the description of a database given in 
section 7.5. 
Start by picturing a special file on a disc which is expected by the operating system to start at 
a particular block on the disc. (If the system is to be reasonably reliable it will probably keep 
a back up copy of this information at another location in case of localised disc failure.) The 
special file contains information about the location of every file held on the disc. The 
information points to the starting location of the files, and the length of information held from 
the starting location. 
The first few blocks of our special file, called the 'volume index' themselves point to the files 
used by the system to control the disc volume. The two most important components are the 
description of the index itself and the pointer to the top level directory on the disc. Directories 
are special files which contain the names of all the files which users have grouped together, 
including the names of sub&rectories. Together with each filename must be a pointer to the 
descriptive block within the index volume for the file being described. 
We need one further aspect of information. In order to allocate blocks from the discs 
reasonably efficiently, the disc index points to a file called the bitmap which has one bit for 
each allocatable block on the volume. Bits are set to indicate that the corresponding block is 
occupied and cleared when the block is released. 
As files in this sort of system come and go, the disc space fragments. Perhaps the first 
available group of blocks in the volume may be insufficient to accommodate a new file, or 
otherwise it could be extended at some later point in its lifetime. In either event, there is a 
possibility that some files will not allocate as a contiguous group of blocks. In this case, the 
index file needs to contain more than one pointer to a file extent: each of these file extent 
pointers clearly has to indicate the number of associated blocks starting from the first block in 
a group. 
7.3. Data Acquisition 
Computers are routinely used for data recording. They provide the flexibility to obtain and 
manage received data in a manner which permits its subsequent retrieval, examination and 
interpretation. The data may be obtained from physiological measurements or perhaps from 
image acquisition. In either case the data require to be transmitted to the computer in a manner 
in which it has been set up to expect. It ultimately must be sent to the computer in digital form. 
The conversion of physiological data into a digital form was discussed previously in Chapter 4. 
In that chapter, we discussed several electronic means for conversion and the system require- 
ments for data precision and sampling rate. When we specify a computer to carry out the data 
acquisition and processing functions, we must additionally bear in mind its performance 
constraints. Apart from figures which quote the simple bandwidth of the electronic compo- 
nents in the computer which receive the data, we must be aware of the rate at which the 
computer's processor may accept interrupts. Each data transaction involving moving a block 

Computing 181 
of data to and from memory typically requires around 1000 machine code instructions. A 
machine which is capable of processing a million instructions per second (slow by modern 
standards.) would therefore do nothing else but receive data if interrupts occurred 1000 times 
per second. However, even this transaction rate is well in advance of its real capacity, since 
when its data rate saturates, its service time for interrupts would progressively increase to a 
level which would not be sustainable. It would clearly also expect to undertake some other 
processing and to move the acquired data to secure backing store, further loading the 
processor. A machine offering that performance level would thus be doing little else if it 
required to receive more than 100 interrupts per second. 
7.4. Computer Networks 
A computer network enables connected computers to exchange information. As there is a 
wide variety of computing equipment on the market, equipment from different suppliers who 
employ various standards for their data must use common standards for communication if any 
data exchange is to be meaningful. Without this apparent chaos, there would be insufficient 
diversity of supply to promote technical development. Network standardisation, whilst it 
necessarily relies on using a lowest common denominator of the facilities available on the 
participating computers, is however enabling rather than restrictive in its nature. 
Computer networks have developed rapidly from their inception in the late 1960s. Initially 
they provided facilities for the connection of numbers of the same sort of computer, thus

Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
avoiding the nee~ to convert between different data types and interpretation. This form of 
network was particularly useful in assisting the avoidance of excessive local loads. Problems 
came about with the development of new computer architectures and operating systems 
which did not readily fit into those networks. Heterogeneous networks followed a few years 
later and led to international collaboration in the definition firstly of a model for partitioning 
network function and subsequently the individual standards used for communication. 
Modern networks provide the user the ability to share and exchange data with other users of 
the network, to send and receive electronic mail messages, and to access the facilities of 
remote computers. The model for communication was developed under the auspices of the 
International Standards Organisation (ISO), and published in 1978, as its seven layer model 
for open systems communication, shown in Figure 7.3. The layering defined by the model is 
intended to separate conceptual levels of functionality so that services can be logically 
grouped. 
Each layer in the network model uses the services of the layer below it, and provides services 
to the one immediately above it. Corresponding levels on communicating computers are said 
to be in 'Virtual' communication with each other. This architecture means that there is a good 
degree of decoupling between layers so that the model is able to accommodate technical 
change in layers readily without the effects being felt outside the scope of the modified layer. 
In an introductory text, the aspects of computer networks that are of primary interest relate to 
the technology and performance of the lowest layers of the network model which physically 
communicate with one another, and the high level facilities offered in the Application Layer 
of the model. 
7.4.1. Low Level Protocols 
Reference is frequently made to Local Area Networks, to distinguish them from Wide Area 
Networks. Apart from obvious differences in physical extent, the technological distinctions 
relate to the speed and reliability of communication. The designer of a local network should 
expect that at any time a significant number of the participating computers will require to 
communicate with each other. They should therefore be configured in a manner which makes 
communication straightforward. For instance, they should expect to have buffers available to 
receive any anticipated messages, and obviate the need for low level flow control. The 
network should be designed to have low error rates to avoid the need for the frequent 
exchange of supervisory messages. 
Wide area networks on the other hand are likely to facilitate communication between 
machines whose contacts are sporadic. The connection bandwidth is typically much lower, so 
the conditions are set for needing flow control. The greater distances used increase the scope 
for noise to interfere with the data. There is therefore a much greater requirement for a low 
level error correction mechanism. 
The networks described below are representative of their types. The discussion here is not 
intended to be exhaustive, but indicative of the levels of performance and relative cost of the 
different technologies. More detailed introductory texts are Black (1989) and Tanenbaum 
(1989). 

Computing 183 
7.4.1.1. X25 Networks 
X25 is the name of the set of recommendations defined by the CCITT (Comit~ Consultatif 
International T~l~graphique et T~l~phonique) to enable communication via a public network. 
The definition arose from prototype networks which used serial data links and was promoted 
by the international telephone authorities to assist their participation in this market place. The 
low level of communication uses frames which carry messages, channel information to 
identify the particular information and a checksum to ensure reasonably reliable transfer of 
data. At the higher levels, X25 uses 'Virtual Connections' which support communication 
between participating processes on separate computers. The term 'Virtual Communication' is 
used to describe the circumstance when communication takes place between machines or 
services which do not have a dedicated electrical path connecting them. 
Messages are routed through the network in a manner which is not visible to the user 
application. The protocol merely guarantees that information will be delivered in the order in 
which it was sent and within a specified time. 
The speed of an X25 network is largely controlled by the data rate supported by the network 
lines used (within the performance limitations of the connected computers). Early public X25 
networks used signalling rates of 480 or 9600 bit s -1. More recent networks operate at speeds 
of up to around 2 Mbit s -l. 
7.4.1.2. Ethemet 
The first version of Ethernet was developed by the Xerox Corporation in 1970. It provides for 
communication via a coaxial cable, with a signalling rate of 10 Mbit s -l. All participating 
computers are connected to the network and are required to send information in 'datagram' 
frames which include the addresses of both sending and receiving computers. Receiving 
computers are required to accept only messages addressed to them. 
A transmitting computer may send its data when it senses that the network is not in use. It 
must check that the information on the network corresponds with what it is sending to check 
whether another machine is attempting to transmit another message at the same time. It must 
dearly examine the network for a period corresponding to the maximum delay which a signal 
could experience in traversing the network. If its signal collides with a message originating 
from another computer, then the signal it sees on the network differs from that which it is 
currently attempting to transmit. It must then cease transmission: the other transmitter will 
also detect that its own signal is not appearing correctly on the network, and will also stop 
transmitting. Both intended senders then wait for randomly chosen intervals before sensing 
the network afresh to see if they can transmit their message. This strategy seeks to reduce the 
likelihood of a further collision once the transmission attempt is repeated. 
The throughput of Ethernet may be expected to be up to around 60% line utilisation, 
representing around 600 KB s -l. Between any two computers this figure is likely to be 
somewhat less owing to the performance limitations of the major components involved: the 
interface to the network, the processor and very probably the disc system. As a broad rule of 
thumb, maximum network performance is related to the instruction rate of the processor. Over 
many years of development of networks, and from the products of several manufacturers, a 
network throughput of 1 bit per second is obtainable from each instruction per second of 
processor performance. 

184 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
7.4.1.3. Fibre Optic Networks- FDDI 
Instead of using copper as a transmission medium, light signals may be sent along optical 
fibres. These afford higher transmission rates without making for significantly greater diffi- 
culties with impedance matching which are increasingly apparent with high frequency 
circuits. 
The FDDI (Fibre Distributed Data Interface) standard defines a network which complies with 
the ISO model (shown in Figure 7.3) and achieves a 100 Mbit s -l data signalling rate. The 
standard specifics that the network, which has a maximum circumference of 200 kin, is 
connected as a dual concentric ring. The two rings permit data to rotate in counter rotating 
directions, and are preferably dually connected to each participating computer. This strategy 
is designed to provide for resilience of the network against persistent transmission failure as 
the network is able to reconfigure itself dynamically and automatically. 
Access to the network is obtained by the use of a token. A computer which receives a special 
message, the token, is permitted to transmit data on the network. When it has finished 
transmitting, it must retransmit the token on the network, allowing another machine to 
transmit. Holders of the token arc permitted to hold the token only for a time up to a 
configured limit. This ensures that the network's bandwidth may not be dominated by a single 
computer. 
The current cost of installation of and connection to an FDDI network exceeds ten times that 
of Ethemet. This reduces the scope of its application to areas such as interconnecting hubs 
between other local networks. The cost penalty may be expected to reduce if fibre networks 
become more widely accepted and can take advantage of scale economies in the manufacture 
of their components. A serious present difficulty is in producing interface components which 
are capable of keeping step with the data signalling rate employed by the network to monitor 
the presentation of addresses and resignal received data. 
7.4.2. Appfication Protocols 
The Application Level protocols provide services which are accessed directly by users. They 
make use of the network via the services provided by the Presentation Layer which enables 
application services to define the format of messages to be exchanged via the network so that 
they may be mutually interpreted. The arrival and commercial acceptance of these standards 
has been a long time coming. From the initial publication of the Reference Model in 1978 
agreement on the file transfer standard took until 1987 and Electronic Mail 1988. Of necessity 
comprehensive implementations and use take some further time. 
7.4.2.1. File Transfer 
The ISO file transfer service is known as the FTAM (File Transfer, Access and Management) 
protocol. It defines a rich range of facilities to enable the transfer of information between 
computer filestores. The core of its mechanism is its definition of an idealised filestore model. 
Each party to a filestore must represent exchanged data using Presentation Layer services in 
terms of this model. The protocol, in concert with lower layer network mechanisms enables 
files to be located and securely copied through the network. 
The purpose of this service is to facilitate communication between machines which employ 
very different conventions for the storage of their data. The problem which it does not address 

Computing 185 
is how to define the meaning associated with data exchanged between networked computers. 
The transfer of text information is straightforward and was possible with the forerunners of 
FTAM: the requirement for interpreting the transferred information does not stretch the 
ability of different systems. FTAM adequately addresses the issues of how to move data 
between computers and preserve its semantic content. However the problem remains that 
other applications, such as image storage, may not be standardised sufficiently between 
manufacturers to make this sort of information exchange worthwhile. 
7.4.2.2. Electronic Mail 
Electronic messaging via computer networks is becoming increasingly popular. The use of 
computer mail has arrived in a standardised form rather late in the day as there has been a 
proliferation of mail mechanisms from a variety of sources pushed on by a perceived need in 
advance of the completion of internationally agreed standards. 
The ISO standard is known as MOTIS (Message Oriented Text Interchange System), which 
was derived from the earlier CCITr X.400 mailing standard. The development of the two 
standards was merged in 1988 and made properly compliant with the ISO network Reference 
Model. 
MOTIS permits a user to send a message either to another user or group of users with the 
assurance that the message will be delivered. There are mechanisms which are designed to 
ensure that a message which fails to be correctly transmitted to its end point is not lost, but the 
fact is reported to its originator. 
Electronic mail, whilst requiring very high implementation costs, provides an excellent 
means for communicating messages between people who would otherwise need to meet or 
telephone. The messages may be recorded and take advantage of being computer generated 
and stored. Electronic mail may then be useful in transferring results obtained via computer 
data logging, or perhaps images with a low probability of transcription error. 
Delivery of electronic mail is assisted by the use of an electronic directory service whose 
function includes building lists of known names for users rather than cryptic usernames 
beloved of computer installations. This service has further benefits in terms of assistance in 
supporting mailing lists to groups of users and validating the source of messages so that the 
mail network's security and integrity may be guaranteed. 
7.5. Databases 
Databases are simply a computerised method of storing and retrieving data. Typically they 
permit the creation, modification and deletion of data along with facilities for viewing the 
data in many different formats. A database differs from a program with embedded data in that 
the data is independent of the program which accesses and manipulates the data. This 
independence provides many benefits as a number of different programs that use the data can 
be written and modified without interfering with other users. Additional indices are com- 
monly added to a database to improve access time. Very primitive systems use simple files for 
storing data; however, this form of storage does not provide a means of defining relationships 
between sets of data. Consequently a variety of different types of database have been 
developed which address the problem of forming such associations. 

186 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
In developing Database Management Systems (DBMS) the ANSI/SPARC 3 level architecture 
has proved to be a particularly useful model. In this model three levels are described. The 
lowest level is the internal schema which dictates how the data are physically stored. 
Naturally the programmer does not wish to get involved with such implementation detail, so 
the next level is described by a 'conceptual schema'. The conceptual schema provides a 
logical description of all the data stored in the database. Finally there is the external schema 
which is the interface the user will see, where the data are carefully presented and limited to 
that required by the user. Each level is appropriate to different users of the database and each 
level has its own Data Description Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).

7.5.1. Why use Databases in Medicine? 
A clinician receives large quantifies of information over very short periods of time. Conse- 
quently effective means of storing and updating data are required. These data may be stored in 
a database for a number of different reasons: 
s Medical Audit 
9 Access time 
9 Data Security 
The most obvious reason for storing data is to provide a medical history so that new decisions 
can be made in the light of previous information. Given the problems of storing and accessing 
very large quantifies of data this reason alone suggests computerised systems would be 
advantageous. However, the medical profession is constantly seeking to improve care so 
'medical audits' are performed. Such an audit necessitates reviewing patients with particular 
complaints and assessing the effectiveness of the treatment given. Gathering a statistically 
significant quantity of data for such groups is an immense task as the clinician has to wade 
through the paper based records held in many hospitals. By using a database sorting and 
reproducing information relevant to the audit can be done in minutes rather than weeks. 
Furthermore a database can produce a rudimentary report which summarises the information 
stored within it, thus improving productivity. 
A related problem is that of accessing records for day-to-day usage. Records may have to be 
transported from ward to ward and hospital to hospital. Once in an electronic form properly 
implemented local or wide area networks make data transfer an easy task. On a rather more 
mundane level stand-alone machines, for instance in a GP practice, allow both access to 
records and printing of standardised forms. Prescriptions are an obvious example of where 
clear, unambiguous forms are required. As consultation times drop below ten minutes per 
patient small savings in time, due to automated procedures, become significant. 
Duplicated information is another danger waiting to catch the unwary. One way of dealing 
with the problem of waiting for records is to produce a new set of records. However, this 
causes the duplication of information which at best is inefficient and at worst permits people 
to update one set of records but not the second set. Such activities cause inconsistencies in the 
data stored unless meticulous attention is paid to monitoring all the records on a patient. 
Computer systems offer a means of ensuring that duplication is minimised if not eliminated. 
Data integrity refers to the problem of ensuring that data is consistent across a database. 
Assuming that a system has been devised which allows efficient and fast access to any 
patient's records, attention must now be paid to how those records are made secure. Arguably 

Computing 187 
an open filing cabinet, or set of filing cabinets, containing the hospital records on a ward 
would provide fast access to patient records. However, such a system does not provide an 
effective means of ensuring security. A properly implemented multi-level computer security 
system can control access to records and log who has accessed which records and when. 
Finally financial audit must be mentioned. Depending on government policy clinicians may 
be paid by the patient or by a set of regulations on payment for goals achieved. In either case 
detailed reports are quickly produced from a computerised system. When government policy 
is in a state of flux the ability to produce reports from a database that were not relevant in the 
past, but are now required, becomes imperative. The paper based alternative is to work 
through all previous medical records one by one. 
7.5.2. Database Architecture 
7.5.2.1. Flat File 
The simplest way of storing data is simply to place those data in a file and search the file when 
the information is required. This method does not, in itself, hold information on how the data 
are structured. For example if a patient has a patient number, name, diagnosis number and 
diagnosis description then a single file could hold a list of such patients. Should the diagnosis 
number for a particular condition change, then all the patient records with that diagnosis 
number must be modified. Alternatively two files could be kept one with patient number, 
name and diagnosis number, the second with diagnosis number and description. This avoids 
the modification problem and will reduce duplicated information by storing the relationship 
between diagnosis number and diagnosis description only once. If this method is used then 
the program must be carefully designed to manipulate correctly the files so that the structure 
of the information is maintained. Other problems will then arise if more fields are added to the 
file as the original program may not be designed to cope with such additions. 
7.5.2.2. Hierarchical Databases 
Hierarchical databases impose some structure on the data; in particular a link is defined which 
connects one datum to multiple data. This type of structure is termed a parent/child relation- 
ship. The example given below shows a consultant, the 'parent', linked to patients and to 
medical teams, 'children'. So there are two parent/child relationships.

Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
This form of structure is very effective, since each high level record has links with many 
lower level records. Problems arise when structures are not strictly hierarchical, for example 
if a patient is looked after by many consultants or if members of a team work for more than 
one consultant. Such relationships require a more complex structure. 
7.5.2.3. Network Databases 
A network database permits a more general structure than the hierarchical database. In this 
ease a 'parent' can have many 'children' and a 'child' can have zero or more parents. 
Consequently a network of connections is created.

Such a database can be quite complex and hard to visualise, largely due to the existence of 
both data and connections. These connections (links) are also present in the hierarchical 
database but not in such a general form.

7.5.2.4. Relational Databases 
Relational databases are based on Set Theory. Relations can be likened to tables. Each table 
stores information, the columns represent attributes and the rows a particular record called a 
tuple. The ordering of rows and columns is not specified, each row must be uniquely 
identifiable and each column has an identifier. Consequently any data item, called an atom, 
can be extracted by specifying the tuple and attribute. Extra attributes can be added later as the 
ordering of columns is not specified. Additional columns do not affect use of the database, 
except with regard to space consumed. Structure is imposed on the system by matching 
attributes in one table with attributes in another thus defining a link. The unique identifier 
specifying a row is known as the primary key of that relation, whereas an attribute that refers 
to data held in another table is known as a foreign key. Consequently both data and links are 
stored in one format, the relation. The following three relations Patient, Consultant and Social 
Worker illustrate how a relational database is represented. Each table has a set of attributes 
consisting of Title, Name, Number and additional attributes, where required, to link the 
relations. In this ease Patient has the attributes CNo and SNo to indicate which Consultant and 
Social Worker is involved with a particular patient.

7.5.2.5. Distributed Databases 
There are a number of different ways of forming a database over a network. The following 
diagrams detail the notation used: 
Figure Z 7 Network symbols 

190 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Centralised database 
The centralised DBMS is placed on one system which users log onto either locally or 
remotely. This type of system is typical of mainframes where cheap terminals are used and 
specialist staff control the main computer. See Figure 7.8 
Figure Z8 Centralised database 
Figure 7.9 Client/Server architecture 

Computing 191 
Client/Server architecture 
Control of the database is centralised on the server; however, the user interface is processed 
by the client computer. Client/Server architectures are of particular interest as they permit the 
use of cheap 'intelligent terminals' for local processing (Figure 7.9). The key advantage is that 
complex graphical interfaces can be controlled by the local processor as it is a local task 
whereas the database is controlled centrally by the server. This configuration is conducive to 
data integrity. 
Distributed Database 
The distributed database is held on two or more systems over a network; however, it is all part 
of one logical database. Such databases are particularly useful for multiple site usage; for 
example if a number of hospitals are linked forming a complete database, with each hospital 
holding local patients on its local database. As hospitals normally only access the records of 
local patients there is very little network traffic between hospitals. The main disadvantage of 
such a system is that duplicate data are often stored so that each site does not have to access 
the other site on a frequent basis. This duplication leads to data integrity problems if a site 
does not respond properly. 
Figure Z 10 Distributed database 
Federated database 
At present there are many different databases available and clinicians would like to be able to 
access all of them with a common interface without worrying about where they are. The 
federated database is a collection of inhomogenous databases under different operating 
systems with a global database manger controlling the overall system. This collection of 
databases should appear to be one database to the user. There are considerable technical 
difficulties which frequently lead to facilities degenerating to the lowest common denomina- 
tor. Careful costing of maintenance problems and interfacing software is advisable before 
assuming that existing disparate systems can be combined, as opposed to creating a new all 
encompassing distributed database designed for the task. See Figure 7.11. 

192 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Figure 7.11 Federated database 
7.5.3. Database Design 
Databases must be carefully designed to ensure that data are not duplicated and can be 
efficiently accessed. As databases, particularly relational databases, are now becoming in- 
creasingly common an understanding of how they are designed is important. The following 
three subsections detail some of the key tools used to design a database. 
7.5.3.1. Functional Dependency 
Functional dependency is a key concept in database design. The underlying idea is that a 
record should only store dam that are related to one concept. If multiple relations exist within 
a record then duplication of information is very likely. In order to facilitate design functional 
dependency diagrams are used to show which attributes are functionally dependent on other 
attributes. An example of this would be a relation PATIENT where the attributes are name, 
number and consultant. In this case the patient number is unique and therefore specifies a 
particular consultant, for that patient. Consultant is said to be functionally dependent on 
patient number. 
PATIENT.number ~ PATIENT.Consultant 
Patient number functionaUy determines Consultant 
A functional dependency diagram of the consultant, patient, social worker database depicted 
in the relational database section would be as shown in Figure 7.12. 
Note that each relation has its own functional dependency diagram. 
In any relation an attribute that can be used as the unique identifier for that relation is known 
as a candidate key. One of the candidate keys will be chosen as the primary key. A well- 
designed database will ensure that the only functional dependencies will be direct functional 
dependencies on a candidate key (all arrows will go only from candidate keys to other 
attributes).

7.5.3.2. Normalisation of Relational Databases 
A database can be expressed in a standardised form. These standard forms, termed normal 
forms, are designed to alleviate problems that may arise within a database. The process of 
converting a database to a normal form is known as normalisation. First normal form requires 
that each attribute of a tuple should be atomic. A typical situation is the patient/consultant 
problem.

Second normal form states that the database is in first normal form and that all attributes that 
are not candidate keys will depend fully on the primary key.

194 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
As names of vegetables have nothing to do with the primary key (Patient) they should be 
listed in a separate table (relation). 
Third normal form is the highest normal form commonly used during database design. For 
our purposes third normal form (3NF) will be treated as if it is identical to Boyce Codd 
Normal Form (BCNF). Strictly speaking the BCNF and 3HF are not equivalent but the 
difference is very small. Third normal form states that the database is in second normal form 
and that non-key attributes are not transitively dependent on the primary key. An alternate 
way of expressing this, BCHF, is that every determinant must be a candidate key. A determi- 
nant is an attribute which determines the value of another attribute.

In this case although the Patient uniquely determines the age of the consultant, it only does so 
because Patient determines the Consultant and Consultant determines the Consultant's age. 
This relationship is known as a transitive dependency. 
7.5.3.3. Entity Relationship Diagrams 
Normalisation and functional dependency diagrams start from listing the attributes and 
producing appropriate diagrams, a bottom up approach. Entity relationship diagrams start by 
expficitly illustrating the relationship between entities. An entity is a self-contained object. By 
using this approach the designer can draft a design using a top down approach. Entities and 
relationships are drawn first and attributes may be added later. 
Square boxes represent entities which are relations in a relational database. Diamonds 
represent relationships. Relationships are further specified by using I and M. So where one 
consultant has many patients a 1 is placed next to Consultant and M is placed next to Patient. 
According to this notation M means zero or more. Optional and mandatory relationships are 
also denoted by using O and l next to the appropriate entity/relationship link. Clearly a patient

may or may not have a social worker, consequently the relationship is optional, denoted by an 
O. However, it is mandatory that a patient has a consultant; this is denoted by a I. Attributes 
can also be placed on the diagram as shown in Figure 7.14. 
The primary key will usually be underlined if attributes are placed on an entity relationship 
diagram.

7.5.4. Medical Databases 
General practice databases have become very widespread in the last decade. With the advent 
of cheap microcomputers medical records can be stored and accessed cheaply and effectively. 
Basic records can be kept on such systems such as storing patient details and a simple history. 
As cheap and readily available databases increase in size, images such as X-ray prints, may 
also bo stored. 
Typical services provided by medical databases are" 
9 Individual and family registration details 
9 Appointments 
9 Patient recall & preventative health screening 
9 MeAical history summaries 
9 Prescriptions 
9 Formulary 
9 Practice reports 
9 Financial audit reports 
9 Searches on data for medical audit 
9 Links to hospital laboratories & databases 
Spann 1990 and Rodnick 1990 discuss the merits of computers in family practice in the USA. 
Interestingly Rodnick suggests that a computerisod system slows the GP down because of the 
time taken to enter records. Despite this statement computers are used in Britain to quickly 
produce clear prescriptions and automatically generate medical records along with statistics. 
Clearly the way software is implemented for ease and speed of use will strongly affect the 
usage of databases. 
Hospitals cover a much greater variety of problems. One of the most significant areas is 
medical audit. Various databases are now used which store information primarily for audit or 
research purposes. Typically an historical record is kept listing some or all of the following: 
signs, symptoms, prognosis, procedures, findings and diagnosis. For example Ellis B.W et al 
1987 discuss the use of databases in surgical audit, McCoUum P.T et al 1990 apply a database 
to vascular surgery. Naturally a database is only as good as the data which are stored within it 

196 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Barrie (Barrie 1992) looks at how the quality of a database is compromised due to inaccurate 
or incomplete data. Feedback on the use of the database is emphasised as a means of ensuring 
the database is consistent. 
Databases are not solely used for medical audit, nursing staff also use these systems for 
assisting them in 'care-planning' (Hoy 1990). The key advantage here is that a clear unam- 
biguous plan is stored and becomes readily available to the data user. Information flow rather 
than statistics is the major factor in its use. Real-time systems are also used to collect and 
summarise data. Such systems transport data to a convenient point and convert it into a 
readable format. Examples of this can be found in Intensive Care (Fumai et al 1991) and 
Neurophysiology (Krieger 1991). 
Financial services must also be considered as governments or insurance companies may 
require information from the hospital or general practitioner in order to make payments. 
Annis et al 1989 details how a database can be used to assist the finance section of the 
hospital, thus allowing money to stay with the patient rather than be directed to support 
services. 
As databases continue to expand and images are stored and shared, attention must be paid to 
the type of networks that will be used and storage requirements. Allen (Allen et al 1992) 
discusses the problems of such networks and how to transport and store the large quantifies of 
data involved. 
The aforementioned uses of a medical database are by no means exhaustive; whatever system 
is required it is well to consider that a poorly implemented system is worse than no system at 
all. A database has an advantage over existing paper records because clear, accurate, up-to- 
date, reliable data are available, if this is not true then the database becomes expensive and 
useless. Great care must therefore be taken to specify what is required (Olagunju 1989). 
7.6. Clinical Expert Systems 
Expert systems are gradually being introduced into medicine and consequently clinicians 
need to be aware of the characteristics of this new technology. If the computer can success- 
fully provide the information normally given by an expert then it deserves the title 'expert 
system'. This section looks at how the clinician approaches diagnosis and how the computer 
attempts to mimic this behaviour. Knowledge representation is a particularly important issue 
for these systems and a description is given of the three key methods used today. Finally an 
outline is given of the practical considerations associated with introducing an expert system. 
7.6.1. Medical Reasoning 
There are four main approaches to diagnosis (Williams 1982) none of which are used 
exclusively. They are exhaustive diagnosis, gestalt, algorithmic and hypothetico-deductive. 
An exhaustive approach covers all possible contingencies: in practice this is impractical as the 
number of unlikely but possible causes can be very large. In addition the tests required would 
be expensive and the time taken to check all possibilities prohibitive. The gestalt approach is 
one where an impression is received by the clinician from the combination of all the data at 
once rather than concentrating on any one aspect. Typically the demeanour, pallor and 
circumstance of the patient combined with the observed symptoms may as a whole be 

Computing 197 
associated with a particular condition. Alternatively the algorithmic approach ignores the 
overall picture and concentrates on answers to particular queries. This method is a 'flow- 
chart' approach (Armstrong et al 1992) to diagnosing a problem, which allows little insight. 
Lastly the hypothetico-deductive approach is based on drawing together a number of hypoth- 
eses which are then proved or disproved by confirmatory tests. 
All these approaches are used in normal medical diagnosis, with the exact combination 
depending on the experience and temperament of the clinician. During diagnosis reasoning 
would start with asking the patient questions and performing a clinical examination. Nor- 
mally four or five active hypotheses will be considered during this time, possibly more 
amongst less experienced clinicians. Observations are then interpreted in the light of the 
active hypotheses to determine which, if any, can be reconciled with the patient's condition. 
Further tests then allow the clinician to identify the particular problem. It should be noted that 
the original hypotheses may have been determined by an algorithmic or gestalt approach. 
Transferring this knowledge to an expert system poses a number of problems. The probability 
of a sign indicating a particular problem may not be known except in very simple cases. In 
many cases a combination of problems exists, particularly in the elderly, so assigning accurate 
probabilities is impossible. Even if accurate probability factors exist, the clinician may not 
know all the information required, particularly if a sign is difficult to detect. Assuming that the 
appropriate facts and probabilities are known there is no guarantee that the experts who 
programmed the computer have incorporated all the rules that they know let alone all those 
that exist. Finally the model of the human body on which the rules are based may be 
inaccurate, incomplete or both, either due to lack of information or disagreement amongst the 
experts. Despite these problems a body of knowledge does exist and clinicians do diagnose 
illnesses, so an expert system should be able to capture some of this expertise. 
7.6.2. Expert Systems 
Expert systems are intended to supplement the role of an expert giving advice. For example if 
a GP requires information on a specialist area he may approach a consultant who, in this case, 
is the expert. Typically an expert system should not only answer a problem but also give 
reasons and be able to demonstrate how the conclusion was reached. Naturally the questions 
asked by the system should follow an intelligent line of enquiry, otherwise the expert systew 
degenerates into an exhaustive search of a database. If such a system is to be of benefit its 
interface must comply with its users' normal linguistic conventions and it should also be able 
to deal with symbolic concepts. Understanding and acting on concepts fulfils one of the 
criteria for Artificial Intelligence (AI). An expert system is one form of AI according to this 
definition. 
There are many possible roles for these systems in medicine, diagnosis, therapy, financial 
audit, medical audit, teaching, research, and biological and medical engineering. As diagnos- 
tic aids they can assist the clinician in identifying the patient's condition, particularly where 
unusual problems occur (King 1990). As a therapeutic aid the system can give appropriate 
advice taking into consideration interactions between drugs, sensitivities of the patient and 
the latest information. Financial and medical audits have been covered in section 7.5.4 and are 
equally applicable to expert systems. Such systems can be given hypothetical cases or can be 
queried about real cases, in either event this can be very useful for teaching a student (Ferreira 
1990). Once a large quantity of data has been acquired new hypotheses can be tested and 
conclusions drawn. This provides one obvious approach to supporting research in medicine. 

198 Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Finally in biological and medical engineering a system which can automatically acquire and 
act upon data received from sensors attached to a patient can potentially enhance the power of 
existing monitoring systems. A variety of problems must be overcome before these systems 
can be realised. 
When developing an expert system a few key areas must be addressed, namely how the 
knowledge is acquired and represented, how knowledge can be inferred from known informa- 
tion, how the information can be combined in a 'fuzzy' world and how the results can be 
expressed efficiently and effectively to the clinician. The remainder of this section on medical 
expert systems looks at knowledge representation as a way of characterising the systems 
currently available. 
Three main types of knowledge representation are commonly used; production systems, 
semantic networks and frames. These representations are not mutually exclusive and will 
often be combined with each other and a normal database. Work is continuing on how best to 
combine various models (Ramoni et al 1992) 
7.6.2.1. Production Systems 
A production system combines rulesand facts with a knowledge processor. By matching rules 
and facts new facts are produced which can then be matched with further rules. The section of 
the system that deals with processing this information is known as the inference engine. 
Typically the 'inference engine' will match rules and facts and then decide which has the 
highest priority and consequently which shall be triggered first. The rules are expressed as 
Boolean logic statements (i.e. conjunction, disjunction, negation, implication). Two methods 
can be used to find a solution in this system, forward chaining and backward chaining. 
Forward chaining starts from the facts and produces new facts by combining with rules. This 
process continues until all possible solutions have been found. Alternatively backward 
chaining starts with all rules (or facts) which can produce the solution. If some of the facts 
within a rule are unknown then this becomes a sub-goal. Backward chaining is generally 
preferred as the search space is normally much smaller than that searched in forward 
chaining.

Computing 199 
Perfect rules rarely exist in the real world so uncertainty factors can be associated with a rule 
or a fact (Henkind 1988). These rules can be combined using numerical or pseudo-numerical 
techniques. Bayes' theorem forms a strong basis for a production system however the pseudo- 
numerical techniques are more common, the most well known of which was developed for 
MYCIN (Shortcliffe 1976). If the computer were infinitely fast with infinite storage capacity 
an exhaustive search of all possibilities would be feasible, however this is not so in practice. 
Two other approaches are used, namely activation criteria and metalevel rules. Activation 
criteria define a set of conditions which the rules and facts must fulfil if they are to be 
considered, whereas metalevel rules dictate how other rules are used. By using one or both of 
these methods the production system may produce a reasonable solution without the time 
penalty of performing an exhaustive search. 
7.6.2.2. Semantic Networks 
Semantic networks store knowledge by describing binary relations between entities, so 'x is a 
part of y' and 'the femur is attached to the tibia' are shown in Figure 7.16. 
Relation is

is attached to 
x

Figure Z 16 Semantic network 
By adding more relations (oriented arcs) and entities (nodes) a graph is produced which is 
known as a semantic network. These networks form a simple and well-defined method of 
storing knowledge. Consequently it is an excellent way of representing knowledge. Unlike 
the production system, data acquisition is separated from the diagnosis in a semantic network. 
No diagnostic hypothesis is assumed, instead the system accepts or rejects states of the 
network. Consequently observations validate pathophysiological conditions which validate 
possible diseases which validate the treatment. Confidence factors can be placed on the 
relations so that a certainty factor for the results can be determined. 
7.6.2.3. Frames 
Frames store knowledge within data structures, each element of the data structure is called an 
attribute, property or slot. Slot is the normal term in AI applications. These slots hold 
information including other frames if appropriate. Each slot can have a default value or a 
value inherited from the slot of another frame. Procedures can be called as required or be 
automatically triggered by a particular event. These triggered procedures are known as 
'demons'. An example of frame based storage of information is given in Figure 7.17 where 
two frames are depicted, Patient and Ward. 
A brief review of intelligent systems has been written by Kulikowsld 1988. Further general 
information can be found in Feischi 1984, Barr 1986 and Rich 1991.

As information systems become an integral part of the working environment an appreciation 
of the problems posed by security, in various forms, is required (Lane 1985, Denning 1982). 
Physical security refers to damage to the medium on which information is stored. Data 
security covers the security problems associated with transferring, modifying or deleting data. 
In addition data integrity and privacy are two key problems. Data integrity involves the 
consistency of the data; privacy deals with an individual's rights. 
7.7.1. Physical Security 
Physical security covers both natural disasters such as fires, earthquakes and man made ones. 
Man made problems can be further categorised into accidents and deliberate damage. Acci- 
dents may be caused by incompetence, negligence or 'just' curiosity. However, more serious 
problems occur when damage is deliberate or data are stolen. A variety of methods can be 
used to safeguard data, the simplest of which involves having a safe area for the computer. 
Fire detectors and appropriate extinguishers are a straightforward method for dealing with 
one of the most common natural disasters. Training and well-designed systems alleviate many 
of the accidental man made problems. Finally any system must have an efficient mechanism 
for keeping backup copies, preferably off site. Taking these simple precautions provides a 
high degree of physical security. 
7.7.2. Data Security 
Data security covers areas such as unauthorised searches, information transfer, inference of 
private information, deletion or modification of data and unauthorised access using false 
identification. A simple expedient is to have a physical lock on the computer and on the room. 
Locked cabinets can store discs or tapes to prevent access to data as well as providing some 
physical security. Assuming the user has access to the system then the system should be able 
to limit how the data are transferred. If the user can transfer data to an unprotected file without 
any record of the transaction then it is effectively useless at preventing the authorised user 
from abusing the data. A more subtle form of abuse involves statistical databases which are 
designed to give general statistical information, not personal information. By putting careful 
conditions on a request it may be possible to identify personal information, for example 'How 
many 24 year old men, admitted on 13/6/91 to a medical ward in Cardiff, blood type A+ve 
have AIDS?'. This method of abuse is accomplished by inferring information, consequently 
inference control may be necessary. 

Computing 201 
In order to limit information to only the appropriate people they must be identified. Usually 
this is done using a password system although other techniques are available, such as security 
cards like the banking cash card combined with a Personal Identification Number. In some 
cases sensitive data must pass through channels which are not secure. Encryption can be used 
to protect such data although this doesn't prevent deletion. Modification can be detected by 
using standard data error detection methods such as Cyclic Redundancy Checking. 
7.7.3. Data Integrity 
Data integrity refers to the consistency of a set of data. There are two types of integrity: 'entity 
integrity' and 'referential integrity'. Entity integrity means that each data record is uniquely 
identifiable. Referential integrity states that a referenced record must exist. In practice a 
system should ensure that no conflicting data are stored, all data are up-to-date and deletions 
and modifications are automatically dealt with in such a way as to maintain the integrity of the 
system. Some modern database management systems are designed to cope with integrity 
constraints; however, not all do. 
7.7.4. Implementation Considerations 
This section summarises some practical considerations for the user. Obviously the safeguards 
listed earlier should be checked and if relevant implemented. If a password system is used, the 
system manager should decide if the password should be updated regularly with meaningless 
passwords, or if a permanent, easy to remember, password should be used. The former method 
can provide a high degree of security but if the user continually forgets the password or ends 
up writing it on the computer then a simple password is more effective. The 'choice of 
password' problem highlights another issue, namely that the system should be easy to use. If 
a system is awkward then people will either refuse to use it or will find ways to bypass the 
system. A typical example of the ease of use problem is the practical outcome of using a single 
level security system as opposed to a multilevel security system. For instance if a nurse must 
collect information from a system for which a consultant must provide the password, 
inevitably the nurse will discover the password as the consultant will not be willing to collect 
data for nurses or stand over them as they query the system. Backups are frequently 
highlighted as an important method of safeguarding data and yet are rarely used properly on 
small systems. This problem is caused by inefficient or time consuming backup procedures: if 
the data are important a satisfactory backup system is necessary. FinaUy the clinician must 
decide who will require the data and where. If a large number of users may eventually want to 
use the system on different sites then thought must be given to purchasing an expandable 
networked system. 
7.7.5. Data Protection and the Law 
Data protection legislation has become an important international issue. Such legislation is 
designed to prevent the abuse of personal data and to satisfy the requirements of international 
conventions such as the Council of Europe Convention. Both these points have become 
important because of the widespread use of databases and the requirements for importing and 
exporting data. If the Council of Europe Convention is not ratified by a country then the 
transfer of data to and from the non-complying country will become difficult as complying 
countries will refuse to deal with its computer bureaux. Typical conditions are that all 
personal data should be registered and none of these data should be used, disclosed or 

202 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
exported except as registered. Data users and computer bureaux must register and the data 
subject is permitted access to their records and may correct or erase the records if applicable. 
The following principles are typical. 
9 Data must be obtained and processed fairly and lawfully. 
9 Data shall only be held and disclosed for lawful purposes. 
9 Data can only be used in a manner compatible with the stated purposes. 
9 Data must be relevant, adequate (not excessive) for the stated purpose. 
9 Data must be accurate and up-to-date. 
9 Information must only be held for as long as it is necessary. 
9 An individual must be informed if information is stored and have access without undue 
cost or delay (Deletion or Correction may follow) 
9 Appropriate security measures must be taken. 
These principles can only be upheld if information is stored on data users. Such registration 
may include the following details 
9 Name and description of data user. 
9 Description of purpose and type of data. 
9 Source of data. 
9 Recipient of data. 
9 Countries to which the data may be exported. 
9 An address for the data subject to apply for information. 
Various exemptions may exist depending on the country, particularly in the medical arena. 
Physical or mental health data may be exempt from subject access or the access may be via a 
censor such as the subject's doctor. If the data are used for research and the subject is not 
identified in the results then subject access may be denied. In medical emergencies the data 
may be disclosed despite protective legislation against disclosure. If the data are available by 
law or are stored in backup files then they may be totally exempt from additional legal 
restraints. In all cases the data users must check the legal situation as it pertains to them, as 
both national and international law changes and new precedents are set. 
7.8. Practical Considerations 
When a clinician designs, specifies or chooses a system the following points should be 
considered; user friendliness, reliability, conciseness, how well proven the system is, whether 
a significant improvement will be realised, cost effectiveness, fail-safe features and specialist 
computer staff requirements (Smith 1990). 
The first five points determine whether or not the system will be used. The system must be 
user friendly otherwise most clinicians will not start using it. If the system is not reliable, or is 
too verbose then the clinician will not be willing to spend time on it. If the system does not 

Computing 203 
have a proven track record most clinicians will be concerned about the learning period 
associated with a new product which may prove to be useless. Lastly there is no point in using 
any system if it introduces new problems without resolving any old problems. 
Our final three points cover economics and safety. Cost effectiveness must be taken into 
account, including capital cost and running costs. In addition attention must be paid to the 
economic assumptions of decisions made by a computer system. For instance MRI scans for 
all out-patients would detect problems very early on but prove to be impractical economically. 
The system should also fail-safe so, for example, an error in 1% of cases will cost money not 
lives. Finally, costs involving employing computer specialists and external consultants or 
running training courses and tutorials should be built into an assessment of a system.

Hospital Safety 
8.1. Electrical Safety 
If we receive an electric shock there are basically two effects which occur. Firstly our nervous 
system may be excited, and secondly, we may suffer severe burns due to the resistive heating 
effect of the passage of current through our bodies. The stimulation of our nervous system 
may cause us injury through excitation of our muscles. However, as the heart is essentially a 
muscle, its stimulation represents the greatest risk through electrocution. 
8.1.1. Levels of Electric Shock 
Some individuals can sense currents as low as 100 I~ externally applied at 50 Hz. However, 
other subjects may not be able to sense currents less than 0.5 mA. The threshold of feeling 
level for DC currents varies between 2 and 10 mA. These values tell us two things, that the 
threshold of feeling is an individual characteristic and that the body is more sensitive to AC 
signals than to DC signals. There is also a difference in the sensitivity of men and women to 
electric currents; women are generally more susceptible. 
After the tingle, or threshold of feeling, the next level of electric shock is the 'let go' 
threshold. If you grasp a live conductor the muscles in your arm and hand are excited and 
contract. This causes you to grip the conductor more tightly whilst being electrocute~. At 
relatively low current levels you are able to overcome the current and still have voluntary 
control of your muscles. The approximate level above which most males cannot let go of a 
conducting object is 10 mA at 50 Hz. The level for women at this frequency is approximately 
6 mA. At current levels above this limit there is severe pain and ligament damage may ensue. 
However, this level of electrocution is not life threatening unless the sufferer is in a hazardous 
situation. Perhaps a man is electrocuted on a ladder. In this instance a sudden muscle 
contraction may cause him to fall some distance. At a higher current still, the muscle 
contraction may be so violent as to cause fractures. 
If the level of current flowing lies between 18 and 20 mA then there is potential for chest 
paralysis. If someone is electrocute~ between points on the fight hand and the fight elbow, 
obviously this will not occur. If, however, a current passes across the chest of the patient then 
the muscles which control breathing may become frozen in the contracted state and therefore 
unable to function. Chest paralysis is extremely painful and sufferers soon become fatigued as 
they are unable to maintain an adequate supply of air. 

Hospital Safety 205 
If the current which passes across a subject's chest is greater than 22 mA but less than 75 mA, 
the normal beating rhythm of the heart may be disrupted. At currents greater than 75 mA but 
less than 400 mA, ventricular fibrillation may result. This occurs when the normal co- 
ordinated beating of the heart becomes disturbed and the heart quivers or shakes and no 
functional beating takes place. With currents greater than this level, the heart suffers sustained 
contraction, i.e. both ventricles and atria may contract and remain contracted. This is strangely 
less dangerous than ventricular fibrillation as, following removal of the stimulation, the heart 
starts beating in a co-ordinated fashion as the whole heart is simultaneously returned to its 
normal state. In ventricular fibrillation, each section of the heart beats in an uncoordinated 
fashion and the heart therefore requires an external stimulus to regain its coordination. 
If a current greater than 10 A passes through the patient then, irrespective of nervous system 
damage, there will be serious burns due to the heating effect of the current. Accidents of this 
nature usually occur where high power cables or lines are used for industrial purposes. 
8.1.2. Physical Differences in Electrocution 
As we have already stated, men and women tend to have different thresholds for the 
physiological effects of electrocution. However, individuals within the same sex also have 
different thresholds. These depend to some extent on body weight and build. The skin 
resistance of a patient varies significantly with sweating and, therefore, a patient or a subject 
who touches a live cable with moist hands will receive a greater current than a patient with 
perfectly dry hands. However, While you are being electrocuted, you sweat. This itself 
reduces the skin's resistance and tends to increase the current flowing. 
The path of the shock current through the sufferer's body determines the muscle groups and 
nerves affected. Obviously if a patient is electrocuted between two points on one side of the 
body, such that the current does not flow across their chest, the likelihood of serious injury to 
their heart or chest is reduced; whereas a current flow across the chest is potentially the most 
dangerous. 
The duration of the current flow through the sufferer is related to the level of damage inflicted 
by the equation 
116 
Imin ="~" 
(1) 
Equation 1 is empirical and expresses the length of time or the minimum current which cause 
ventricular fibrillation. The minimum current for ventricular fibrillation is inversely propor- 
tional to the square root of time. 
Figure 8.1 shows a graph of the threshold of feeling against frequency, it represents the 
frequency response of nervous tissue to alternating current. The effect of the current on the 
nervous tissue diminishes at frequencies below 10 Hz and at frequencies above 200 Hz. 
Unfortunately, the effect is maximum at approximately 50 Hz; in Europe and America the 
frequency chosen for domestic electricity supply is between 50 and 60 Hz, which correlates 
with the worst frequency for electric shock.

8.1.3. Types of Electric Shock 
An external electric shock is termed a macro shock. Potential danger to cardiac function exists 
with currents of greater than 10 mA. There are various situations which may result in a patient 
receiving a macro shock. Figure 8.3 shows two possible conditions in which a patient may 
receive a macro shock. In Figure 8.3a the live wire comes directly into contact with a patient 
connected lead. In Figure 8.3b the combination of a break in the ground connection and a live 
wire coming loose and touching the casing would cause macro shock if the patient touched 
the case. 
An electric shock applied directly to the heart is termed a micro shock. Micro shocks almost 
exclusively occur in the clinical environment and involve equipment which is directly 
connected to the heart. For instance, if a patient's blood pressure is being monitored with a 
catheter transducer located in the heart, then there is the potential for micro shock. The 
threshold current of life threatening danger to cardiac function is as low as 50 IxA for micro 
shock. 
Increasing levels of micro shock cause various levels of disruption. The first level occurs 
when the natural rhythm of the heart becomes disturbed. Following this, there is pump failure, 
when the heart no longer supplies the blood flow required for the patient, thereafter ventricu- 
far fibrillation occurs. Obviously, patient data which determines these effects is sparse. 
However, a certain amount of this work has been conducted during heart operations. When a 
surgeon operates on a patient's heart, the heart is given a measured electric shock to elicit 

Hospital Safety 207 
ventricular fibrillation, and facilitate work. Researchers have therefore been able to identify 
current thresholds relating to rhythm disturbance and ventricular fibrillation. The work has 
also been backed up by significant animal experimentation. A rhythm disturbance can be 
caused by a current as low as 80 IxA, while 600 I~A may cause ventricular fibrillation. The 
fight atrium, where the sino-atrial node is situated, is the most susceptible part of the heart to 
electric shock. 
Figure 8.2 Macro shock possibilities 
The threshold for feeling electric shock depends on the individual and circumstances, but lies 
between 100 and 500 I~A. A danger of causing micro shock exists below the level of 
perception of the medical staff carrying out an investigation. Capacitive coupling from the 
live parts of an instrument can cause a current to flow to ground. This current is referred to as 
leakage cm'rent. Typical electronic instruments designed for industrial use may have leakage 
currents which although unnoticed by their users are above the levels which cause ventricular 
fibrillation if applied directly to the heart. Leakage currents are a major source of micro 
shock. The levels of leakage current which are permissible in medical equipment are strictly 
controlled. Any equipment brought in to a hospital from outside therefore represents a micro 
shock risk. In Figure 8.3a a patient with a cardiac catheter reaches to touch a mains powered 
radio. The radio designed for non medical use has a potentially dangerous leakage current 
which flows through the patient and to ground through the cardiac catheter. 

208 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
The mains distribution system in hospitals uses three wires. The AC power is applied to two 
conductors, the live and neutral, whilst the third is connected to ground. The ground wire is 
commonly connected to metal screens within the instrument or to its case. If a live wire 
becomes loose and contacts such a screen the earth wire serves to carry fault current safely to 
ground and causes the circuit to fuse. The earth wire also carries leakage current due to 
capacitive coupling between the earthed screens in the instrument and its live parts. In the 
event of the earth conductor either in the power cord or the distribution system becoming 
broken this leakage current can no longer flow. A patient touching the faulty instrument case, 
as in Figure 8.3a, would therefore provide a path to ground for this current. In most cases this 
Figure 8.3 Micro shock si~tions 

Hospital Safety 209 
would not be noticed; however, if the patient has a cardiac catheter then the path to ground 
may be through the patient's heart. In this instance micro shock results. 
The distribution system in older hospitals may have evolved rather than been designed. It is 
possible that separate power sockets in one room are connected to different earth points. 
These earth points may have different potentials. A patient connected to equipment with 
different earths receives a current flow owing to the potential difference. This is depicted in 
Figure 8.3b where the patient is simultaneously undergoing ECG measurement and heart 
catheterisation. 
To minimise the risk of micro shock the majority of medical equipment used in intensive care 
areas incorporates isolated circuits, isolated power supplies, and earth free patient connec- 
tions. 
Patients during operations and in intensive care may require high concentrations of oxygen 
and other potentially explosive gases. These gases may build up in a fault condition and can 
be ignited by sparks from electrical equipment. 
8.1.4. Isolated Power Supplies 
The low thresholds for micro shock make the design of electrical equipment for clinical use 
difficult. Power supplies produced for industrial equipment have leakage currents in excess of 
those permitted for medical equipment. To construct equipment with leakage current levels 
acceptable in the medical environment it is necessary to use isolated power supplies whose 
primary and secondary windings are separated by an earthed screen (seeFigure 8.4). The

equipment must be constructed such that the capacitive coupling between the primary power 
supply parts and the secondary circuit and its connections is minimised. With careful design 
the leakage current from such a power supply can be reduced to below 25 IJA. However, stray 
capacitance and hence leakage current can not be entirely eliminated. 
8.1.5. Isolation Amplifiers 
Isolation amplifiers allow two sections of a circuit at different potentials to be connected with 
a minimised leakage current flowing between them. In medical applications isolation amplifi- 
ers are used to protect the patient from both leakage currents and currents arising from fault 
conditions. They normally consist of a high impedance input section whichmust be followed 
by a low leakage barrier. This in turn is followed by a low impedance output, represented in 
Figure 8.5. There are three methods of transferring information from the input to the output 
via a low leakage barrier. They are transformer coupling, optical coupling and capacitive 
coupling. In medical applications capacitive barrier isolation amplifiers are not generally 
used.

Figure 8.5 Isolation amplifiers 
8.1.5.1. Transformer Isolation 
The differential signal (see Figure 8.6) applied to the input of the amplifier is modulated and 
transmitted through the transformer. In the output section the signal is demodulated and 
amplified. Isolators fabricated in this way often incorporate feedback of the modulated signal 
to the input section via a second transformer winding to help correct for non-linear perform- 
ance. A variety of modulation schemes is used including amplitude modulation.

8.1.5.2. Optical Isolation 
The barrier section is constructed using an optical source and detector. A Light Emitting 
Diode (LED) is used to transmit light to a photo diode used as a detector. The non-linear 
output characteristics and poor temperature stability of LEDs cause problems in the design of 
these devices. Similar modulation techniques to those used for transformer coupled amplifiers 
are employed (see Figure 8.7). 
Both transformer and optically coupled isolation amplifiers incorporate a transformer wind- 
ing to transmit power to the input section of the barrier. The device may also provide isolated 
power for pre-amplification stages. Isolated DC to DC converters are also used to supply 
isolated power to primary transducer circuits. 
Isolation amplifiers must provide isolation up to approximately 5 kV before bre~down. The 
input stage of a isolated amplifier used in a bioelectronic recording system typically has a 
common mode rejection ratio of 120 dB.

8.1.6. Residual Current circuit breakers 
In normal operation the current flowing down the live wire is equal to the return cmrent 
flowing down the neutral wire. Discrepancies may be due to leakage currents. In fault 
conditions the current from the live wire may flow to ground through an alternative route. The 
current in the neutral conductor is then significantly less. Residual current circuit breakers 
sense the difference between the current flowing through the live and neutral wires of the 
supply and interrupt the supply if it exceeds a pre-determined limit. 
Practical residual current detectors are built with a small symmetrical transformer placed in 
the live and neutral fines as shown in Figure 8.8. The live and neutral are wound in opposing 
directions. The flux produced by the respective coils cancels when the currents balance, so a 
sense coil measures no induced voltage. However, if the current in the neutral wire is different 

212 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
Figure 8.8 Residual current circuit breaker 
from that flowing along the live wire then a net flux is induced and a voltage is produceA in the 
sensing coil. If this induced voltage exceeds a pre-set limit a relay is switched to disable the 
supply. Residual current circuit breakers may be set to sense current differences of approxi- 
mately 2 mA to protect against macro shock. 
8.1.7. Electrical Safety Standards 
Europe, Britain and America have standards for the electrical safety of medical equipment 
which specify acceptable levels of leakage current for a variety of grades of medical equip- 
ment. Equipment which is to be used in conjunction with instruments which are directly 
connected to the heart or equipment which makes a low impedance connection to the patient 
is classified as requiring higher levels of patient safety then equipment with high functional 
resistance at the point of application to the patient. It is important in all circumstances to 
design commercial and experimental research medical equipment to the safety standards in 
force in the intended country of use. Adherence to these standards ensures a minimum 
standard of safe operation is maintained. Failure to design to the safety standards may be 
evidence of negligence if the equipment should at any stage prove faulty or dangerous. 
8.2. Radiation hazards 
Dangers from radiation come from a number of sources. Around 20% of our normal dose of 
radiation comes from previously absorbed radioactive materials. As some materials localise 
in particular organs in the body these may be especially dangerous. Most of the remaining 
dose normally comes from background radiation, although in developed countries a signifi- 
cant proportion of this, when averaged through the population, comes from medical sources. 

Hospital Safety 213 
Additionally there is a risk of serious exposure of populations from radioactive accidents, 
although the authors of a UN report felt unable to make a rationally based assessment of the 
overall risk owing to a lack of data (UNSC, 1982). Biological damage is classified into two 
categories (in the same United Nations report): 
1. Somatic effects, which apply directly to the irradiated individual, and cause tissue damage. 
The hazard from this source depends on the affecte~ region of the body and the age of the 
individual (younger people are at greater risk owing to their higher rate of cell renewal). 
2. Genetic effects which cause either gene mutation or chromosomal aberrations. The former 
are heritable alterations of the genetic material, which may either be dominant mutations 
causing effects on the immediate next generation, or recessive mutations, which may not 
express themselves for several generations to come. 
Chromosomal aberrations result in a severely disrupted chromosomal make-up which may 
lead to very severe abnormalities. 
A more accessible description (than is contained in the United Nations report) of biological 
effects of radiation, precautions, and legal requirements for radiation protection is given in 
'An Introduction to Radiation Protection'by A.Martin and A.B.Harbison (Chapman and Hall, 
1979). 
The somatic effect of radiation causes different forms of damage according to the absorbed 
dose. A dose of about 3 Gray causes death in 50% of individuals within 30 days of exposure. 
Death at this dose level is due to depletion of white blood cells resulting in a reduced 
resistance to infection. When proper medical attention can be given this cause of death may be 
significantly reduced. At significantly higher doses the survival time reduces to typically 
around 3-5 days. Death is due to serious loss of cells in the lining of the intestine, which is in 
turn followed by severe bacterial invasion. This is called gastrointestinal death. 
In both these cases, the damage caused is roughly proportional to the dose absorbed. At lower 
level, the damage is termed stochastic since a probability of radiation induced damage can 
only realistically be calculated for a population. The primary form is carcinoma inducing, 
where signs of damage may become apparent many years after the exposure. A dose of 1 mSv 
given to each of a population of 1 million people gives rise to around 13 fatal cancers. The 
normal incidence of cancers in a population of this size per year is around 2000. 
8.2.1. Basic precautions 
The major consideration when dealing with ionising radiation must always be to consider 
whether the risks involved in its use may outweigh any possible benefits. There must be a 
clear strategy to minimise any exposures to radiation: this may be by using shielding, keeping 
a good distance and minimising the duration of any exposure. In the case of medical 
exposures particularly, it may be possible to reduce the exposure of organs not under 
investigation by using addition shielding and restricting the width of the beam. Sensitive 
areas of the body should be particularly avoided, such as the gonads, as should exposure of 
children and pregnant women. 
When a source is used with a restricted beam, it should be ensured that the radiation which 
escapes the working area is minimised by shielding and distance: the subsequent movement 
of the source may require to be restricted so that it may not be used inadvertently in an 

214 
Introduction to Medical Electronics Applications 
unprotected direction. Particular care should be taken of workers in radiology as they are 
likely to be exposed to radiation much more frequently than are their patients. 
8.2.2. Legal requirements 
Regulations for the use of radiation are not the same in all countries: there is increasing 
uniformity in the European Community as certain of the Euratom codes of practice are 
adopted. The major legislation in the UK is the Health and Safety at Work Act (1974) which 
defines responsibilities for safety. The statutory body which supervises the enactment of this 
legislation, the Health and Safety Executive, has drawn up appropriate regulations regarding 
the designation of types of facility in relation to their risk of causing exposure. 
The UK National Radiological Protection Board is responsible for the acquisition of knowl- 
edge in the field of radiation safety and providing services to assist in that end. 
Both of these topics are covered in greater detail in Martin and Harbison: anyone requiring to 
use ionising radiation should however become fully conversant with their appropriate legal codes. 
8.3. Ultrasound safety 
Although ultrasound is widely regarded as being harmless, it is possible to weld materials 
using ultrasound and to destroy kidney stones in sire. It would be more accurate to say that the 
risk to patients of diagnostic ultrasound at the intensities currently used is minimal. 
The passage of ultrasound through tissue causes heating as its wave energy is converted to 
thermal energy through relaxation processes. The heating effect of ultrasound is used for 
some therapeutic applications. In Doppler or echo imaging systems this process is unwanted. 
In sensitive tissues, such as the brain, the heating effect of ultrasound could be dangerous. 
However, the intensifies used in current diagnostic equipment are such that the heating effect 
is negligible. 
As ultrasound travels through tissue, the density compaction and rarefaction caused may 
reach energy levels after which cavitation occurs. It most probably would occur in continuous 
fields of high intensity possibly caused by standing waves. A number of mechanisms which 
are potentially damaging have been identified, and studies have been undertaken into the 
possible systemic effects of damage due to diagnostic ultrasound. They are not believed to 
occur at energy levels below 100 mW cm -2 (see Evans, 1989).
