Preface to the Second Edition 
The first edition of this book had been written with the special aim to provide the 
necessary information for an understanding of the deformation and scission of chain 
molecules and its role in polymer fracture. In this field there had been an intense ac-
tivity in the sixties and early seventies. The new results from spectroscopical (ESR, 
IR) and fracture mechanics methods reported in the first edition had complemented 
in a very successful way the conventional interpretations of fracture behavior. The 
extremely friendly reception of this book by the polymer community has shown 
that the subject was timely chosen and that the treatment had satisfied a need. 
In view of the importance of a molecular interpretation of fracture phenomena 
and of the continued demand for this book which still is the only one of its kind, a 
second edition has become necessary. 
The aims of the second edition will be similar to those of the first: it will be at-
tempted to reference and evaluate completely the literature on stress-induced chain 
scission, now up to 1985/86. References on other subjects such as morphology, vis-
coelasticity, plastiC deformation and fracture mechanics, where the treatment was 
never meant to be exhaustive, have remained selective, but they have been updated. 
Some sections where major progress has been achieved during 1978 to 1985 
will be revised (such as those on impact fracture, on the failure of pipe materials and 
on crazing) or newly written (that on crack healing). Smaller additions to the text 
will be introduced by the phrase "In recent years", which refers to the time interval 
from 1978 to 1986 and permits to identify information not available at the time of 
the first publication of this book. 
As far as possible, the author has tried to consider the many constructive com-
ments which he had received from his colleagues in the past few years. Unfortunate-
ly, some ofthese suggestions would have gone much beyond the intentions of 
author and publisher to bring out the principal mechanisms and the role of molec-
ular chains in polymer fracture. A certain abstration therefore, has become absolute-
ly necessary. Thus a detailed treatment of the anelastic and plastic deformation of 
polymers and of the influence of processing parameters would have meant to at 
least double the volume of this book. Nevertheless, in view of the undeniable impor-
tance of these parameters an increased attention has been given to them this time. 
Undoubtedly the manuscript still contains points which should have been 
treated more extensively; the author apologizes in advance for any inconsistencies 
and omissions. He hopes again that the special viewpoint of this book will be useful 

in the study of the different aspects of fracture of polymers, from rapid crack prop-
agation to long time loading and fatigue, from crazing to rupture of highly oriented 
fibres.

Preface to the First Edition 
This book on "Polymer Fracture" might as well have been called "Kinetic Theory 
of Polymer Fracture". The term "kinetic theory", however, needs some de-
finition or, at least, some explanation. A kinetic theory deals with and particu-
larly considers the effect of the existence and discrete size, of the motion and of 
the physical properties of molecules on the macroscopic behavior of an ensemble, 
gaseous or other. A kinetic theory of strength does have to consider additional 
aspects such as elastic and anelastic deformations, chemical and physical reactions, 
and the sequence and distribution of different disintegration steps. 
In the last fifteen years considerable progress has been made in the latter do-
mains. The deformation and rupture of molecular chains, crystals, and morphologi-
cal structures have been intensively investigated. The understanding of the effect of 
those processes on the strength of polymeric materials has especially been furthered 
by the development and applicatiQn of spectroscopical methods (ESR, IR) and of 
the tools offracture mechanics. It is the aim of this book to relate the conventional 
and successful statistical, parametrical, and continuum mechanical treatment of 
fracture phenomena to new results on the behavior of highly stressed molecular 
chains. 
The ultimate deformation of chains, the kinetics of the mechanical formation 
of free radicals and of their reactions, the initiation and propagation of crazes and 
cracks, and the interpretation of fracture toughness and energy release rates in 
terms of molecular parameters will be discussed. Although the prime interest had 
been given to these subjects it was not possible to cover the literature completely. 
The author apologizes in advance for all intentional and unintentional omissions 
that will have occurred. In any event this book draws on the existing literature on 
morphology, viscoelasticity, deformation and fracture of high polymers. It is hoped 
that it forms a useful supplement of such monographs in view of a molecular inter-
pretation of polymer fracture.

Deformation and Fracture of High Polymers, 
Definition and Scope of Treatment 
The importance of a thorough understanding of the deformation behavior and the 
strength of polymeric engineering materials need not be emphasized. It is obvious 
to anyone who wants to use polymers as load bearing, weather-resisting, or deform-
able components or who wants to grind or degrade them. "Strength" and "frac-
ture" of a sample are the positive and negative aspects of one and the same phenom-
enon, namely that of stress-biased material disintegration. The final step of such 
disintegration manifests itself as macroscopic failure of the component under use, 
be it a water pipe, a glass fiber reinforced oil tank, or a plastic grocery bag. The 
preceding intermediate steps - nonlinear deformation, envirorunental attack, and 
crack initiation and growth - are often less obvious, although they cause and/or 
constitute the damage developed within a loaded sample. 
Efforts of fracture research are directed, therefore, towards three goals: 
1. To understand the cause and development of a failure and to assess the im-
portance of anyone process contributing to a failure or delaying it 
2. To see whether, how, and with what effect the most damaging process can 
be controlled or even eliminated, and how the strength-determining material prop-
erties can be improved 
3. With the first two goals only partly attainable, one would like to have know-
ledge of the endurance limit of a part in terms of stress or strain level, environment, 
number of loading cycles, or of loading time. 
The first goal is equivalent to the ability to predict the material response under 
all kinds of foreseeable conditions of mechanical, thermal, or environmental attack, 
to characterize the constantly changing state of the material, and to know at any 
moment which conditions of attack are critical for the state the material just at-
tained. To achieve this goal in all generality is hardly poSSible, in view of the com-
plexity involved in characterizing polymeric structures, let alone their deformation. 
A conclusive discussion of those two subjects and of their interrelation with and 
dependency on other aspects of polymer science could perhaps be achieved in the 
framework of a polymer science encyclopedia [1, 2] and partially in specialized text-
books on the viscoelastic [3,4], mechanica1.[S], and physical [6-8] behavior of 
polymers. Although the first goal cannot be achieved in all generality, the literature 
on fracture (cf. textbooks [9-12] and, recently, [46-48]) deals extenSively and 
successfully with interpretations of the fracture eveRt which focus on just those 
processes which accountfor the most obvious changes of sample morphology during 
fracture development.

1. Deformation and Fracture of High Polymers, Definition and Scope of Treatment 
The previous statements on the goals of fracture research are well illustrated 
by the fracture patterns of rigid polyvinylchloride (PVC) shown in Figures 
1.1-1.3. The samples, water pipes internally pressurized, fractured in a brittle man-
ner when the circumferential stress level was high, in a partially ductile manner 
and only after prolonged times at medium stresses, and through thermal crack 
growth (creep crazing) after very long times at low stress levels. The three processes 
leading to pipe failure in these three cases are respectively the rapid extension of a 
flaw, the flow of matter, and the thermally activated growth of a flaw. In all three 
cases the volume element within which the fracture is initiated is finite, consequent-
ly nonhomogeneous deformation must have occurred locally. Later Chapters deal 
with the nature and interpretation of such heterogeneous deformation of a sup-
posedly homogeneous material.

ternally pressurized water pipe

development of a creep craze (from [13]) 
One also understands the importance of the first goal with respect to achieving 
the second. In the described example of pressurized PVC pipes it was known that in 
the medium time range the performance of a pipe was limited by its creep behavior. 
One would wish, therefore, to decrease the creep rate by increasing the rigidity of 
the material; in doing so, however, one would facilitate crack propagation and, 
possibly, craze initiation and thus reduce the permissible stress levels at short and 
very long times of application.

The third goal, the knowledge of the endurance limit of a part in terms of stress 
or strain level, is generally directly attainable within a certain experimental region. 
Figure 1.4 summarizes, for instance, the test results on PVC pipes at temperatures 
between 20 and 60°C, circumferential stresses between 10 and 50 MN/m2 and a 
range of times to fracture of 0.3 to 104 h. Such representations, which in nongraphi-

pressurized PVC water pipes at different 
stresses and temperatures (after (131) 
cal form can be extended to interrelations between more than three parameters, 
form an important basis of our understanding of material behavior within the multi-
dimensional space covered by the parameters investigated. Material selection and 
optimization of its properties through parameter variation become possible to the 
extent the mathematical framework of parameter-property coefficients holds. With 
regard to fracture this means that one would like to define a fracture criterion in 
terms of the relevant structural and environmental parameters. 
A good example for the occurrence of unpredicted events is offered by the. 
behavior of polyethylene (PE) pipes - and of other semicrystalline materials -
under constant circumferential stress; they showed a rapid drop of sustained stresses 
after long loading times (Fig. 1.5). With PE - as with PVC - an initial time range is 
observed where the times to failure are only a weak function of stress. Depending 
on the temperature, the failure mode is either brittle (Fig. 1.1) or ductile (Fig. 1.2 
and 1.6). Both materials are also comparable insofar as the thermally activated 
growth of a creep crack (Fig. 1.3, 1.7, and 1.8) can be held responsible for the fail-

ure of a pipe after long times of service. Both materials are different insofar, as one 
finds in PE - but practically not in PVC - that the kinetics of creep crack develop-
ment differs markedly from that of ductile failure (Fig. 1.5). This finding only under-
lines that it is necessary to deal directly with the physical nature of material defect 
development in order to predict reliably material behavior - especially for new ap-
plications - and/or improve properties through additional components or modified 
production. 
In this monograph we wish to discuss the physical nature of defect develop-
ment, and we will focus on linear thermoplastic and elastomeric polymers (Table 1.1.). 
We recognize that these materials cover a wide range of properties, although they 
are composed of molecules which exhibit a number of similarities: they are pre-
dominantly linear, flexible, highly anisotropic (nonextended) chains having molecu-
lar weights between 20000 and more than 1000000. Figure 1.9 gives a represen-

tation of a (polyamide 6) chain showing the nonextended conj(Jrmation, an 
arbitrary division into segments, and - in the insert - the primary bonds forming 
the backbone chain. The relative sizes of the atoms and the proportion of volume 
occupied by them within the chain is illustrated by the Stuart model of a polyamide 
segment (Fig. 1.10). In actual size this segment has an extended length of 1.97 nm. 
If such a segment could be stressed in the chain axis direction, the bending and 
stretching of primary bonds would result in a chain stiffness of about 200 GN/m2 
[15], whereas the intermolecular attraction of segments through the much weaker 
van der Waal's forces entails a stiffness of "only" 3 to 8 GN/m2 in a direction per-
pendicular to the chain axis. The fact that polymer molecules are long, anisotropic, 
and flexible chains accounts for the characteristic properties of polymeric solids,

lUlmely the anisotropy of macroscopic properties, the microscopic heterogeneity 
and the nonlinearity and strong time-dependency of polymer response to mechanical 
excitation. 
All solid plastics, from rubbery networks to rigid glasslike bodies, are aggregates 
of such molecular chains, which cohere through physical (temporary) or chemical 
(permanent) "cross-links". The wide variety of the macroscopic mechanical properties 
of these materials is caused by differences in aggregation (crystallinity or super-
structure) and in molecular parameters, as for instance by differences in chain 
structure, intermolecular segmental attraction, segment mobility, molecular weight 
(distribution), or cross-link density. Unfortunately these parameters are not fixed 
values attached to a molecular species or a polymeric body, but depend on polymer 
processing and on environmental conditions. In fact by simply changing the time or 
temperature scale of the mechanical excitation of one and the same polymer a wide 
range of responses will be obtained: from that of a brittle glass to that of a highly 
viscous liquid. This general behavior is depicted in a time-temperature diagram, 
given by Retting [22] for hard PVC (Fig. 1.11). Within the relatively small tempera-
ture interval from a to 100 °c (rapid loading) or -100 to +60 °c (creep) the indi-
cated changes from glass to rubber, from - macroscopically - brittle to highly duc-

tile deformation and fracture are observed. The changes in the type of response of a 
given aggregate of chains clearly indicate that different deformation processes must 
be dominant in different regions of the time-temperature regime. 
In discussing the physical nature of defect development it is necessary to char-
acterize the molecular and microscopic structure and to specify which form of local 
deformation eventually leads to a disintegration of the polymeric solid or to a local-
ized heterogeneous deformation and to crack initiation. In previously proposed 
kinetic theories quite different processes were held responsible for the development 
of macroscopic failure. Viscous flow (within cotton fibers) was suggested by Busse 
and his colleagues [23] to determine the fatigue life of these fibers. The "slippage" 
of secondary bonds and the net decrease of the number of bonds was considered by 
Tobolsky and Eyring [24] for the two cases where repair of bonds under stress is pos-
sible or impossible. A model involving two independent networks was discussed by 
Stuart and Anderson [25] who argued that only fracture within the first network with 
unsymmetrical potential barriers between broken and unbroken states contributes to 
failure of glasses. A theory of co"elated Brownian motion of groups of atoms (Viel-
fachplatzwechsel) proposed by Holzmtiller [26] is based on Boltzmann statistics of 
phonon energy distribution where the phonons are the independent statistical units. 
Local rupture at chain ends had been suggested by Spurlin [27] to explain the depen-
dence of the ease of failure on the number of ends of cellulose molecules. The loss of 
entanglements or the partial disentanglement of a network may also be cited here 
since it constitutes a weakening mechanism that influences deformation and failure 
[3,6]. 
In 1945 Flory [28] stated that the tensile strength of a (cross-linked) rubber 
appears to be a linear function of the percentage of the chains permanently oriented 
by stretching. This implies that macroscopic failure is caused by breakage of chains 
at/or between cross-links. This idea that the breaking of primary chemical bonds 
plays a decisive role in fracture was later further developed by Zhurkov [29] and 
Bueche [30]. Bueche, and Halpin [32,33] and Smith [34], had been concerned with 
the strength of rubbery polymers, and found that the time-temperature dependence 
of the ultimate properties could be explained by the deformation behavior and the 
finite extensibility of molecular strands. Prevorsek and Lyons [35] emphasized that 
the random thermal motion of chain segments leads to nucleation and growth of 
voids without breakage of any load-carrying bonds. The lifetime of a sample then is 
determined by the time it takes one flaw to grow to a critical size. Niklas and Kausch 
[13] discussed the effect of the dissociation of dipole associates on the strength of PVc. 
To the molecular processes specified above one has to add the unspecified ones: 
internal destruction, damage, or crack formation probability. In analogy to the 
molecular description of deformation used by Blasenbreyand Pechhold [38] all of 
these molecular processes can be referred to the four physical rearrangements that 
can occur between neighboring chain segments with parallel chain axes: change of 
conformation (segment rotation, gauche-trans transformation), cavitation, slip, and 
chain scission. In Figure 1.12 these rearrangements of segment pairs are shown. Of 
these chain scission and - to some extent - cavitation and slip are potentially 
detrimental to the load-bearing capacity of a polymer network. Conformational 
changes on the other hand appear to be "conservative" processes, which by them-

selves will modify and delay but never generate any progress in the development 
of a fracture process. 
Here it seems to be necessary to say a word about the meaning of the terms 
fracture, rupture, and failure as they will be used within this text. Andrews [9] says, 
"Fracture is the creation of new surfaces within a body ... The term rupture may 
10 

1. Deformation and Fracture of High Polymers, Definition and Scope of Treatment 
be regarded as truly synonymous but not the term failure since the latter indicates 
only that some change has taken place in the body (generally an engineering com-
ponent of some kind) which renders it unsuitable for its intended use. Fracture is 
only one of many possible modes of failure". We will supplement this definition 
by saying that as a result of the creation of new surfaces either holes have to open 
up or formerly connected parts of the fractured specimen have to become detached 
from each other. 
In mathematical terms we may define a fracture process as one by which the 
sum of the degrees of connectedness of the parts of a sample or a structural element 
is increased by at least one. This definition includes the piercing of films and tubes, 
but excludes minute damages as caused by crazing or chain scission. 
The term fracture process is meant to describe the whole development of a 
fracture from its initiation through crack growth and propagation to completion 
of the fracture. In contrast to thermal or environmental degradation and failure 
the fracture process is understood as stress-biased material disintegration. It carries 
on if and only if a driving force exists, which has literally to be a force. Forces, how-
ever, will give rise to deformations. This means that fracture initiation will always 
be preceeded by specimen deformation. 
From Figure 1.12 it could be concluded that, in the absence of flow, chain scis-
sion and chain strength determine the mechanical properties of polymers. In fact, 
there are a number of observations which at first glance support this assumption: 
-
sample strength is a function of molecular weight; with increasing number n of 
chain atoms, a saturated linear hydrocarbon will tum from gas to liquid (n ~ 5) 
and to solid (n ~ 18); the solid will attain technically useful strength (10 MN/m2 ) 
if n is around 2000; with increasing molecular weight and chain orientation that 
strength may still be increased 50-fold (see Figs. 1.13 to 1.15 and Refs. [19,27, 
28,36,37,41,42,49]), 
-
the mechanical loading and rupture of virtually all natural and synthetic polymers 
leads to the scission of molecular chains and the formation of free radicals [39]; 
-
the strength and the hardness of solids increase with volume concentration of 
primary bonds [40]; 
-
in a number of uniaxial tensile fracture experiments the energy of activation of 
sample fracture coincided with the activation energy for main chain bond 
scission [39]. 
The observation that sample strength increases with molecular weight and chain 
orientation is illustrated by Figures 1.13 and 1.14. In low molecular weight material 
chain slip occurs readily, so that the sample strength depends solely on the strength 
of intermolecular attraction. Noticeable macroscopic strength is only obtained once 
the molecular weight is sufficient to permit physical cross-links through entanglements 
or chain folds between several chains [36, 37). In the case ofPMMA (Fig. 1.13) a 
gradual increase in flexural strength is observed in the molecular weight range of 
30000 to 150000. 
The increase in strength is much more rapid for the semi-crystalline PA6 (Fig. 1.14). 
In the range of molecular weights between 1.5 and 3 x 104 , fiber strength increases 
with molecular weight, whereas at still higher molecular weights the effect of the 
increasing number of defects introduced in processing such a fiber, tends to outweigh

the effect of the decreasing number of chain ends (Fig. 1.14, Curve 1). It is also indicat-
ed in Figure 1.14 (Curves I-IV) that the realization of high strength through a high 
degree of orientation (e.g., obtained at higher drawing temperatures Td ) requires high 
molecular weights [41,42]. The effects of crystal structure and molecular weight on 
macroscopic tensile strength are shown by Curves V and VI [43]. This simple diagram 
already shows that multiple interrelations between strength and molecular, morpho-
logical and processing parameters exist. 
Also the data of Table 1 do not support a simple relation between the strength 
values of individual chains and of the solids formed thereof. Young's moduli of bulk 
specimens are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding chain 
moduli, bulk strengths at room temperature are two to three orders of magnitude 
smaller than chain strengths. The critical stress, which is the fracture stress at that 
temperature where fracture changes from ductile to brittle, i.e., at a temperature well 
below the glass transition temperature, is also one to two orders of magnitude smaller 
than the corresponding chain strength. The tensile strengths observed at different 
morphological levels are indicated in Figure 1.15. 
In the cited monographs [2-10] very little has been said about the details of how 
molecular destruction processes effect ultimate properties. In the years 1965 to 1975, 
however, considerable progress has been made in precisely this area, in the investi-
gation of the deformation, strength, and scission of chain molecules. Part of the prog-
ress achieved by Russian scientists working in this area has been covered by the book 
of Regel, Slutsker, and Tomashevskii [11] which is available in Russian; meanwhile an

Rcferences for Chapter 1 
English translation of a newer Russian text on this subject has appeared, the book by 
Kuksenko and Tamush [46]. 
With these words of introduction we are in a position better to define the scope 
of this book. The central theme is the behavior of chain molecules under conditions 
of extreme mechanical excitation and the likely role of chain scission in the initia-
tion and development of macroscopic fracture. We will study the structure and de-
formation of solid polymers (Chapter 2) in an attempt to define the conditions 
under which elastic straining of chains occurs. We will then discuss existing non-
morphologic fracture theories (Chapter 3) in view of our central theme. The mo-
lecular description of fracture begins with a brief account of the strength of primary 
bonds (Chapter 4) and of the thermomechanical excitation and scission of chain 
segments (Chapter 5). The study of free radicals formed as a consequence of stress-
induced chain scission (Chapters 6-8) constitutes the main part of this volume. It 
is the only part of this book where a comprehensive coverage of the existing litera-
ture has been attempted. In Chapter 9 the role of molecular chains in heterogeneous 
fracture will be analyzed. For this purpose a brief introduction is given into the me-
chanics of fracture (stress analysis of cracks in elastic and elastic-plastic materials, slow 
crack propagation). The fracture mechanical functions critical energy release rate 
GIc and fracture toughness KIc are interpreted from a noncontinuum viewpoint. The 
same approach is applied to the phenomenon of crazing. A discussion of molecular 
and morphological aspects of crack propagation and of possible failure criteria con-
cludes that section. A final chapter is devoted to the new area of crack healing. 
As mentioned in the introduction, a kinetic theory of fracture deals with and 
particularly considers the existence and discrete size, the motion, and the response 
of molecules or their parts in a stressed sample. It thus requires a molecular de-
scription of polymer structure and deformation. Such a description is available in 
the cited books [1-12], [20] or papers [15, 38]. In Chapter 2 only a very brief 
summary is offered which is not meant to be self-supporting or complete.

I. Elements of the Superstructure of Solid Polymers 
A. Amorphous Regions 
The basic structural elements of high polymer solids are the chain molecules. The 
large variety of their chemical structures and their flexibility permit widely differ-
ent modes of organization and mechanical interaction, thus giving rise to a variety of 
deformation mechanisms and fracture patterns. At this point the characteristic ele-
ments of structure and superstructure of amorphous and semicrystalline polymers 
will be introduced. The interrelations between chain parameters (structure and regu-
larity), crystal or superstructural parameters (degree of crystallinity, lattice structure, 
nucleation, growth kinetics, and defects of crystals), and external parameters are ex-
tensively discussed in the literature and are not the principal object of this book [see 
Ref. 1-3, 107, for an introduction and for further references]: 
If no regular organization within a solid aggregate of chains becomes apparent 
one speaks of an amorphous state. In the last two decades the interpretation of chain 
conformation in the amorphous state of solid high polymers has been subject to lively 
discussions and careful studies [4-12,100-104,108-125,212]. Until about 1960 the 
general view prevailed that the chain molecules in isotropic, noncrystalline polymers

which are used in this monograph. The abbreviations are in accordance with the international 
standards proposed by ASTM, DIN, and ISO.

I. Elements of the Superstructure of Solid Polymers 
as in many rubbers, glassy polymers such as PS*), PVC, PMMA, PC, or quenched 
"semicrystalline" polymers such as PCTFE, PTFE, PETP have a random confor-
mation which is described by the random coil or spaghetti model. In this model it is 
assumed that the presence of long chain molecules does significantly affect the close 
range order observed in low molecular weight amorphous substances and that strong 
intermolecular orientation correlations do not appear. In the seventies, the concept 
that intermolecular correlation does occur in high molecular weight glassy polymers 
had found some support which was thought to derive from a comparison of segment 
volume and amorphous density, electron microscopic observation of structural ele-
ments, calorimetric investigations, from a discussion of crystallisation kinetics, and 
a study of network orientation. Thus, Hosemann, Pechhold, and Yeh [9-12] propose 
that amorphous states and defect-rich, originally ordered states are commensurable. 
They thus retain elements of anisotropic close range order. Their amorphous state is 
not principally but only gradually different from a well ordered state. Figure 2.1 shows 
model representations of the various interpretations of the nature of the amorphous 
state. 
On the other hand Flory [7, 8, 213] summarized his extended observations on poly-
mers in solution, rubbery networks, and amorphous one- and two-phase materials in fa-
vor of the' random coil structure of chains in the bulk. Also Kirste, Schelten, Fischer, Be-

(planar)"orientation of the segment axes but a non-random distribution of their lateral distances, 
i.e. a close range order 
noit and their associates [4-6,115-116,118-120] studied the structure of amorphous 
polymers using scattering techniques such as neutron", X-ray and light-scattering. The 
results they obtained do not indicate the existence of strong intermolecular orientation 
correlations in conventional polymer melts and glasses. For example, the neutron 
scattering of mixtures of protonated and deuterated molecules in the low- and high-
angle region is in excellent agreement with the scattering of unperturbed chains cal-
culated on the basis of the rotational isomeric state theory by Y oon and Flory [117 -
121]. Thus, it will be considered in this monograph that the random coil model is 
correct and that Figure 2.1 a gives the most appropriate representation of theamor-

phous state. Nevertheless, some weak intennolecular orientation correlations may 
exist as shown for paraffm melts by various authors [113-115] employing depolar-
ized lightscattering and several other techniques. Occasionally, the effect of annealing 
on the mechanical properties of glassy polymers has been rationalized in tenns of in-
creasing anisotropic close range order. However, depolarized light-scattering experiments 
perfonned by Detterunaier and Kausch [125] have demonstrated that appreciable in-
tennolecular orientation correlations do not exist in PC nor are created by annealing 
samples below Tg. 
In the following discussion ordered structural elements are to be characterized. 
In doing so one should keep in mind that for the interpretation of ordered structures 
in real polymer solids one finds a situation somewhat inverse to the interpretation of 
the amorphous state, i.e. one should keep in mind that in any real polymer well order-
ed regions are of limited size and finite degree of perfection. 
B. Crystallites 
From the beginning of polymer science it had been known that native as well as 
synthetic high polymers crystallize [14a]. Analysis of x-ray diffraction patterns has 
revealed the lattice structure and unit cell dimensions of high polymer crystallites. 
Up to 1957 it was believed that the crystallites are of the fringe micelle type. A 
typical micelle was supposed to bundle some tens of hundreds of different molecules 
which - after leaving the micelle and passing through amorphous regions - would 
at random join other micelles. In 1957 Fischer [15], Keller [16], and Till [17] in-
dependently from each other discovered and proposed that high polymers fonn single 
crystal lamellae within which chain folding occurs. Figure 2.3 a shows an electron 
micrograph of a stack ofPE single crystals [18] grown from dilute solution and 
Figure 2.3 b the arrangement of the chain molecules in such lamellar crystals. Here 
the PE chain is folded - with adjacent reentry of the chain after each fold - within 
the (1l0) plane of the ortho-rhombic PE crystal. The unit cell dimensions have been 
determined [19] to be 
a =0.74nm 
b = 0.493 run 
c = 0.353 nm (chain axis direction). 
The largest of the lozenge-shaped single crystals shown has an edge length of 
4700 nm and a thickness of about 10 to 15 nm (originally the crystal seems to 
have been a hollow pyramid which became flattened during preparation). Lamellar 
crystals - including extended chain crystals - of various degrees of perfection and 
size are the product of crystallization from solution or from the melt under appro-
priate conditions. The extreme mechanical anisotropy of the chain molecules is 
reflected by that of their crystallites. For example the elastic response of PE single 
crystals in the three axis directions differs by two orders of magnitude. From the 
shifts in equatorial reflections of the X-ray patterns Sakurada et al. [20] have de-
tennined the elastic moduli to be: 
Ea = 3.1 GN/m2 
Ee = 240 GN/m2 .

It should be noted that these values may depend on the experimental method 
used for their determination [56]. Further information on crystal structure, crystal-
lization kinetics and melting is found in the general [2,3, 107] and specific references 
[56,57,126-131] of this Chapter. 
c. Superstructure 
At this point the superstructure or morphology of unfilled solid polymers is reviewed 
with a desire to identify and define elements of their heterogeneity. Heterogeneities 
can evidently arise from phase separation in copolymers or blends. Structural inhomo-
geneities can also be due to particularities of the polymerization and/or proceSSing 
technique as is the case with globular structures and variations in cross-link density. 
However, the most important features of polymer superstructure certainly arise from 
the tendancy of many linear macromolecules to crystallize and to form polycrystal. 
line aggregates. 
1. Spherulitic Structure 
Spherulites are the most common type of organized superstructure found in semi-
crystalline polymers. In a simplified manner a spherulite can be viewed as an aggregate 
of twisted crystal lamellae (Fig. 2.4). The radially symmetric growth of such lamellae 
from several adjacent nuclei leads to the typical spherulitic structure shown in Figure 
2.5. Spheruli!es are the largest and dominant feature of-melt crystallized specimens. 
Their size has a strong influence on sample strength, coarsely spherulitic material 
being ratherfragile [129-130]. This influence and the means to control spherulite 
size through nucleation agents will be discussed in SectIon 9 III. 
In the seventies it was discussed [91,92, 100] whether and to what extent the 
lamellar crystals of a solid semicrystalline polymer show the same regularly folded 
structure as solution grown single crystals. Schelten et al. [91] concluded that the 
results of the small-angle neutron scattering of deuterated PE molecules (PED) in a

protonated PE host (PEH) are incompatible with a regularly folded morphology. Yoon 
and Flory [92] supported Schelten's conclusions. They compared the intensity distri-
butions calculated for several morphological models with the experimental scattering 
data [91 ]. In their model they recognized the parallel arrangement of stems within the 
crystalline layers, the existence of an interfacial region which contains the folded sec-
tions interconnecting two stems of the same crystalline layer, and an amorphous region. 
The best fit with the experimental data could be obtained by Yoon and Flory [92] 
for a model where 70% of the stems forming a given crystalline layer were connected 
with each other by i"egular, non-adjacent re-entry of the chains from the interfacial 
layer (switchboard model). The remaining portion (30%) of stems. was connected to 
the amorphous region and, subsequently, to the adjacent crystalline layer. In a recent 
series of papers the same authors [214, 215] have developed a lattice theory to de-
scribe in detail the transition from perfect crystalline order to an is~tropic amorphous 
state. Assuming infinite molecular weight (absence of chain ends) the authors find 
that of all the chains emanating from a crystal 70% undergo reversal without proceed-
ing beyond the third lattice layer (which corresponds to an interphase thickness of 
1-1.2 nm). The fraction of chains that become engaged in adjacent folds should be 
0.2 or less for most semicrystalline polymers. For PP however, the probability for 
adjacent reentry seems to be close to zero [213]. After extended analysis of the avail-
able data, Fischer et al. [100, 126, 127] stated that the radii of gyration (of quenched 
PE, of PEO crystallized by slow cooling, and of isothermally crystallized isotactic PP) 
were only slightly affected by crystallisation or annealing even though drastic changes 
of the long spacing (12-25 nm) had occurred. On this basis Fischer [126-127] ad-

2. Structure and Deformation 
vanced a "solidification-model of crystallization" which excludes large scale diffusion-
al motion of chain segments during crystallization. 
A different situation may arise if the crystallization growth rate becomes com-
parable or lower than the rate of conformational rearrangement in the melt. In fact, 
Guenet and Picot [128] studied the chain conformation in isotactic polystyrene and 
observed large crystallized sequences in samples of relatively low molecular weight 
and at high crystallization temperatures. 
The boundaries between spherulites resemble grain boundaries; these grain bound-
ary zones are enriched in low molecular weight material, impurities, chain ends, and 
defects. The deformation and strength of such a "composite" structure naturally 
depend on the compliances of all of its components. In such a composite large com-
pliances (small constants of elasticity) have to be assigned to the cohesion acroSS grain 
boundaries and across lamellar fold surfaces. The cohesion between chains within a 
crystal lamella is much stronger than the intercrystalline interaction; this renders a 
certain stability to the lamellar elements in sample deformation. The deformation 
behavior of such a non-oriented semicrystalline polymer will, therefore, depend much 
more on the nature of the secondary forces between the structural elements than on 
the length or strength of the chain molecules. 
2. Oriented Lamellar Structures 
Oriented lamellar structures are obtained through cold or hot drawing of semicrystal-
line polymers and by spinning from solutions or gels. These structures comprise those 
found in synthetic fibers known and used for a long time [20,35, 132-135], the shish-
kebab or row-nucleated structures [2, 3, 36, 136-139] and the springy or hard-elastic 
polymers [46-51,105]. 
The morphology of fibers is extensively discussed in the literature (see for instance 
141). The essential feature of many fibers is their microfibrillar, sandwichlike structure. 
The role of this microfibrillar structure in fiber deformation and fracture will be dis-
cussed in more detail in Section B and in Chapters 7 and 8. In Figure 2.6 models of 
a

l. Elements of the Superstructure of Solid Polymers 
such micro fibrils are shown. The very high degree of chain orientation in the crystal-
line but also in the amorphous regions of the microfibrils should be noted. Compre-
hensive reviews on these microfibers within fibers, especially of their dimensions as 
a function of fiber formation technique, have been given by Tucker and George [35-
36]. According to them the transverse dimensions of these microfibers are of the order 
of 0.8 to 20 nm in various celluloses, and between 7 and 50 nm in most thermoplastic 
fibers; microfiber lengths are given as 18 to 1000 nm [35]. 
For a study of the effect of chain length and strength obviously structures which 
contain a high degree of oriented chains are more promising than others. Among the 
most widely investigated ones are the semicrystalline fibers. Their deformation and 
fracture behavior will be discussed in connection with the electron spin resonance 
investigations of chain scission especially observed in these fibers. 
Fibrous crystals or shish-kebabs have first been observed in the late fifties, sub-
sequently they have been studied intensively, especially by Keller [136], Lindenmeyer 
[137] and Pennings [138-139]. They are readily grown in supercooled, stirred or agi-
tated solutions and are characterized by strings of platelets which are nucleated by 
and growing on the fibrous backbones previously formed within the solution (Fig. 
2.7): In 1976 Zwijnenburg and Pennings [37] report on a technique to obtain PE mac-
rocrystals of virtually infinite length. There, a seed crystal and - subsequently - the 
growing crystalline PE fiber is pulled under steady-state conditions from a flowing 
solution. The diameter of the obtained fiber, an agglomeration of shish-kebab fibrils, 
varied between 10 and 40 Jim [37]. These fibers may already be considered as belong-
ing to the ultra-high modulus polymers, where an extremely high degree of orientation, 
stiffness.and strength has been obtained [143-154]. 
In the seventies it had been discovered that by controlled drawing and annealing 
treatment of a number of fiber forming thermoplastics a highly crystalline morphol-
ogy with "springy" or hard elastic response could be obtained [46-51, 105, 140]. 
Springy behavior, the characteristics of which will be discussed in the next section, 
has been found so far in PP, POM, PE, PMP, PES, and even in PA 66 [47,105]. The 
morphology is proposed to consist of stacks of flat, highly regular, c-axis oriented 
(folded) chain lamellae with the lamellae interconnected by amorphous chains [46-
51,105,140].

2. Structure and Deformation 
3. Ultra-high Modulus Polymers 
During the past decade several techniques to obtain ultra-high modulus fibers have 
been developed [143-144]. Porter et al. [40,41,43,44], Takayanagi et al. [38, 145], 
and Capaccio and Ward [143,146,153] employed the solid state extrusion of thermo-
plastic polymers involving very high pressl1re (up to 5 kbar = 0.5 GN/m2), tempera-
tures between 30 and about 250°C, and an extensional flow field. In the case ofPE 
such a treatment led to a new high-pressure, high-temperature phase of hexagonal 
symmetry at a high level of chain extension. In analogy to the extended-chain crys-
tals observed by e.g. Anderson [45] in the fracture surfaces of low-molecular weight 
PE the term extended-chain crystals is being used for pressure crystallized PE also. 
Weeks and Porter found that highly oriented strands of such material (Mw = 58000) 
have an exceptional stiffness of 70 GN/m2 at room temperature which is comparable 
to that of E-glass [40]. In addition a good tensile strength of 500 MN/m2 is reported 
[41]. Lupton and Regester [39] worked with ultrahigh-molecular-weight (UHMW) 
HDPE with Mw between 2 and 3 . 106 g/moland obtained a stiffness of 2 to 3 GN/m2 
and a strength of 33-39 MN/m2, but an excellent tensile-impact resistance of 300 to 
600 kJ/m2. Capaccio and Ward [93-98, 146, 153] prepared ultra oriented polymers 
(PE, PP, POM) by means of cold drawing and hydrostatic extrusion. A fibrillar struc-
ture seemed to be retained in those samples. With increasing draw ratio the morphol-
ogy would be characterized primarily by a continuum of oriented material in which 
a statistical distribution of chain ends would constitute the only discontinuities. Thus 
an increasingly smaller fraction of the material would show the conventional morphol-
ogy comprising crystals and oriented amorphous chains, including tie molecules, in 
series. 
For linear polyethylene Capaccio [146] finds that the fiber elastic modulus (be-
tween 5 and 60 GPa) is a unique function of draw ratio (A = 1.0 to 40). He proposes a 
network superstructure in which entanglements and crystalline regions provide the 
junction points. Arridge and Barham propose for cold drawn PE in the module range 
of 4 to 90 GPa a fiber composite model [147]. Ultrasonic measurements of the elas-
tic constants [148] and X-ray studies of the annealing behavior of ultra-oriented 
HDPE [149] permit to characterize the physical network structure even further. 
The pressure crystallization of polymide 6, the morphology of the ensuing ma-
terial and its fracture properties have been extenSively investigated by Gogolewski 
et al. [150] and are discussed in Section 9 III A. 
A recent review by Ohta [144] on the processing of ultra-high tenacity fibers 
treats six different flexible polymers with strength values ranging from 1 GPa (PP at 
A = 28) to 1.7 GPa (PA 6, draw ratio not indicated), 3.2 GPa (Kevlar® , commercial 
fiber), and 4.3 GPa (PE at A = 35). 
A drastically enhanced effective drawability of high molecular weight polyethyl-
ene can be obtained by spinning or casting from semidilute solutions [151, 152, 154]. 
Smith, Lemstra and Booij have argued that a relatively low entanglement density is 
present within a semi dilute solution. Quenching of such a solution transfonns it into 
a gel and fixes the entanglement network. Spinning (at 120°C) of such a gel permits. 
to attain draw ratios up to 72. 
The structure, deformation, and fracture of high strength fibers from rigid rod 
molecules (such as Kevlar®) will be discussed in Chapter 8.

I. Elements of the Superstructure of Solid Polymers 
4. Globular Aggregates 
Some submicroscopic structural features have been observed in amorphous and semi-
crystalline polymers, which are due to particularities of the polymerization technique. 
As an example some fi~rous or globular structures are shown (Fig. 2.8) which had 
been observed by Wristers [21] after the initial phase of polymerization of a poly-
olefine. 
These structures are obtained after polymerization in gaseous or liquid environ-
ment and at low or high efficiency of various Ti-, V-, Cr-, or AI-based catalysts. In Fig-
ure 2.8 electron micrographs of such nascent polymer structures are reproduced [21]. 
Polypropylene at low catalyst efficiency is formed in globules of 0.5 J..lm diameter (a), 
at high catalyst efficiency fibers several J..lm long are observed (b); the fiber diameter 
is closely correlated with the lateral face dimension of the primary catalyst crystal 
and varies between 0.37 and 2 J..lm for TiCh-crystal breadths of between 5 and 50 nm. 
Polyethylene samples prepared with TiCI4 -AI(i-Buh or other colloidal catalysts show 
less regular surface structures (c). 
In the course of the bulk polymerization of lactams it was observed [22] that the 
resultant polymers precipitated in the form of spherulites. Other examples are the fi-
brous, globular, or star-shaped aggregates existing in PVC [23-26] which have sizes

of between 10 and about 500 nm. In good solvents the largest aggregates disintegrate 
into single molecules but only at temperatures higher than 200 °c [25]. 
Whereas the above globular superstructures can fairly unambigously be identified 
and related to the polymerization technique, there are others which can only be seen 
26

I. Elements of the Superstructure of Solid Polymers 
by specific methods and where an explanation is not obvious. From the evaluation of 
SAXS curves Reichenbach et al. [155-156] derive a superstructure in PVC which 
changes with the degree of polymerization. They infer a tetrahedral arrangement of 
1.2 nm small PVC parti<;:les at 1 % conversion which turns into the hexagonal arrange-
ment of 7.8 nm globules at a conversion of 8.9%. The latter should form the globules 
of 0.1 to 1 JJ.m generally visible by electron microscopy [24, 155]. 
Grosskurth [157-159], Kampf and Orth [160], and Schwarz [161] have made 
the interesting observation that ion etching of oriented PS, SAN, PMMA, PC, PETP, 
and PP led to a globular surface structure which was unambigously related to the 
degree and the direction of orientation (Fig. 2.9). 
The question arose whether in this case ion-etching had revealed a preexisting 
morphology or whether it had created a surface structure. If the globular structures 
existed in the solid polymer it should be possible to trace these structures by other, 
very sensitive means (light scattering for instance). Pursuing this interesting problem 
further Grosskurth et al. [162] made the following observations: 
-
a polystyrene sample which in light scattering had proven to be "absolutely clean", 
i.e. free from density fluctuations other than thermal fluctuations [125], did not 
show any systematic globular structures after prolonged oxygen etching (only in 
some surface areas traces were observed which might well have been caused by the 
polishing procedure); 
-
in isotropic PMMA which was free from molecular orientation and internal tensions 
a very weak, grain boundary-like network with grain sizes of between 300 and 500 
nm was obtained [159]; 
-
in non-oriented PC a certain globular structure was observed on ionetched surfaces 
[162]; the characteristic distances between boundaries (150 to 300 nrn) were some-
what larger than the correlation lengths inferred from light scattering (90 to 140 nm 
of unetched bulk samples [125, 181]); in oriented PC globular and row structures 
appeared; 
-
globulit structures have also been seen by transmission electron microscopy in highly 
oriented Os04-stained ultramicrotome PS slices not subjected to ion etching [159]; 
Recently, Neppert et al. [163] studied the sputtering mechanisms in the ion etch-
ing of isotropic and oriented semi crystalline and amorphous polymers (pS, PC, PE; 
PMMA); they also observed highly excavated as well as weakly modulated sample 
surfaces; they related these structures to the fact that target sputtering yields depend 
on the angle of .incidence of the ions (and thus on local surface curvature), on chain 
orientation, on the gradient of the chemical potential JJ. and on secondary fluxes of 
ejected atoms. They state that chains at the surface cut during ion etching would 
relax and diffuse. The effect of this directed surface diffusion is to roughen the sur-
face into rows which are subsequently modulated by the incoming ions [163]. 
According to the latter hypothesis, the strong dependence of chain relaxation 
and diffusion on the structure of the network and on its frozen-in anisotropy would 
explain the excellent correlation between the degree of sample orientation and the 
characteristic surface features. This correlation has been verified by Grosskurth [157-
159] for a large variety of molecular and processing parameters of PS and PMMA. 
27 

2. Structure and Deformation 
5. Block Copolymers and Blends 
A much more distinct structure is found in the large group of multi-phase polymeric 
systems formed by the block copolymers, graft copolymers, random copolymers, and 
poly-blends. This group of polymers has received increasing attention (e.g. [27-29, 
164-167]) because of their improved, controllable, "tailor-made" properties which 
have made them excellent engineering materials. Their superstructure is determined 
by the relative weight, sequential order, and limited miscibility or even incompat-
ibility 
of the covalently connected molecular segments of hard (glassy , thermoplastic) and 
soft (elastomeric, rubbery) chains as within the (two- or three-) block copolymers 
and random copolymers 
of the (two) phases grafted onto each other within graft-copolymers or 
of the molecules mixted together in poly-blends. 
The variety of ensuing multi-phase structures cannot be discussed here in any de-
tail; it ranges from the extremely ordered hexagonal patterns of spherical domains of 
one phase embedded within the continuous phase (mostly of the dominant component) 
to the partial phase separation of solution-cast poly-blends occurring only after heat 
treatment [27-29]. In Figure 2.10 an electron micrograph of the morphology of a 
butadience styrene diblock copolymer is reproduced [31]. At 17% by weight the sty-
rene forms the discrete phase of spherical or cylindrical aggregates in a continuous 
butadiene phase. Owing to the homogeneity of block lengths the aggregates are ar-
ranged in highly regular lattices. The sizes of the aggregates correspond very well to 
the volume occupied by the styrene blocks. The spherical or cylindrical aggregates 
must be larger than one diameter of the coil formed by the PS segment and must be 
smaller than two such diameters to permit phase separation while maintaining material 
continuity [28-30].

I. Elements of the Superstructure of Solid Polymers 
In view of their interesting properties and their large technical importance block 
copolymers and blends have been extensively discussed in the literature. At this point 
be cited the "classical" books by Bucknall [164], Manson and Sperling [28], and Paul 
and Newman [165]. Aspects of the thermodynamics and miscibility were treated by 
Lipatov [168] and Prud'homme [169], advances in the theory of polymeric alloys were 
reviewed by Noolandi [170). 
A rather intimate combination of two polymers in network form are the inter-
penetrating polymer networks (IPN). They are dermed as a material containing two 
polymers, each in network form, one of which is generally synthesized in the presence 
of the other. The lPN's can be distinguished from simple polymer blends, blocks or 
grafts in that they swell, but do not dissolve in solvents and that creep and flow are 
suppressed [171-173]. A monograph on their structure, behavior and application 
has been publishers recently by L. H. Sperling [171]. 
With respect to another interesting area, the structures of liquid crystallike poly-
mers, the reader is referred to the following pertinent references [174]. 
D. Characterization 
The experimental methods available to determine or characterize the structure of poly-
mer chains or of their aggregates are discussed in the general references of Chapter 1, 
by Hoffmann et al. [175] and Kiimpf [176], and in [177]. In addition specific informa-
tion on X-ray diffraction [178], neutron scattering [179, 182], electron- and light-scat-
tering [4, 52, 53,180-182], optical and electron microscopy [3, 14b], thermal [3, 54] 
and viscoelastic behavior [14c, 55-57], and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tech-
nique [180, 182] can be obtained from the references indicated. In his book [183] 
Koenig describes how these methods can be employed to analyse the chemical mi-
crostructure of polymer chains (composition, stereo regularity, crosslinks , branches). 
Recent progress and new methods to characterize the solid state are discussed in two 
volumes of the Advances in Polymer Science, edited by Kausch and Zachmann [184]: 
Synchrotron radiation, solid state 13C-NMR (including the magic angle spinning tech-
nique), deuteron-NMR, quantitative electron microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy. 
Electron spin resonance (ESR) and infrared absorption (IR) techniques will be 
introduced in Chapters 6 and 8 respectively. Except for the microscopic methods all 
of the mentioned techniques provide an average information, an information to which 
all structural elements within the active volume of an investigated sample contribute 
according to their individual response, concentration, and position. Any macroscopic 
information which is not solely taken as such but is used to characterize an inhomo-
geneous solid generally involves elemental response functions and orientation distri-
butions which are not completely known. For this reason a certain ambiguity is in-
troduced into the deconvolution of such experimental data. This leaves some room 
for individual interpretations as to the concentration and nature of structural elements. 
This ambiguity has been inherent in the discussion of the existence or non-existence 
of close range order in amorphous polymers and of the nature and distributions of 
defects within crystallites. Of even more concern for the structural interpretation of 
mechanical properties is the fact that the nature of the connecting members be!ween 
29 

2. Structure and Deformation 
structural elements is much less well known than the nature of the latter. This is true 
on all levels: for the arrangement and interaction of non-ordered chain segments, for 
the fold surfaces of lamellar crystals and the connections between them, for the amor-
phous regions between crystallites in fibers or unoriented polycrystaUine samples and 
for the boundaries of microfibrils or spherulites. This will be further illustrated in the 
next section. 
II. Deformation 
A. Phenomenology 
The deformation of the complex structures described in the last section involves a 
number of different phenomena ranging from a linear elastic to a highly viscous re-
sponse. 
In the following three sections will be outlined the characteristic deformation be-
havior of the various structures treated above. The molecular mechanisms and the 
principal laws of deformation will be indicated. They will be more extensively treated 
in Chapters 8 to 10. For any general information concerning the deformation of single 
crystals [3, 57,141,185], amorphous [1,188], semicrystalline [188], or oriented po-
lymers [132, 133], ultra-drawn fibers [143], elastomers [186], and toughened plastics 
[28, 164-166, 187] or interpenetrating networks [171] the reader is also referred to 
the indicated literature. 
1. Thermoplastic Polymers 
The characteristic quasi-static uniaxial-deformation behavior of different thermoplastic 
polymers in the non-rubbery temperature region is shown in Figure 2.11. The stress-
strain curve a) is that of a brittle polymer (polystyrene at room temperature) charac-
terized by its very limited extensibility and the steep and monotone increase of stress 
with strain. Curve b) represents a hard elastic polymer, lamellar polypropylene film 
[58], which combines strong elastic behavior with good extensibility at a high stress 
level and almost complete recovery (within a period of days). Curve c) is that of a 
ductile polymer. The initial monotone increase of the engineering stress generally is 
less steep than that of a brittle polymer, i.e. the secant modulus is smaller. The engi-
neering stress a reaches a maximum at the yield point (Streckgrenze) which marks the 
beginning of the so-called cold drawing, a notable reduction in cross-section of the 
strained specimen. If the stress-strain curve extends considerably beyond the yield 
point one speaks of a tough polymer; the shape of the curve depends on the strain 
hardening behavior of the polymer and on the tendency to neck formation. Curve d) 
is characteristic for soft polymers, e.g. for thermoplastics at a temperature close to 
their glass transition temperature or plasticised polymers, which do not yet show rub-
ber elastic behavior. 
As indicated earlier the different stress-strain curves are not characteristic for 
particular, chemically defined species of polymers but for the physical state of a 
30 

II. Deformation 
polymeric solid. If the environmental parameters are chosen accordingly transitions 
from one type of behavior (e.g. brittle, curve a) to another (e.g. ductile, curve c) 
will be observed. These phenomenological aspects of polymer deformation are dis-
cussed in detail in [14], [52-53], [55-57], and in the general references of Chap-
ter 1. A decrease of rate of strain or an increase of temperature generally tend to 
increase the ductility and to shift the type of response from that of curve a) towards 
that of curves c) and d). At small strains (between zero and less than one per cent) 
the uniaxial stress a and the strain € are essentially linearly related (Hooke's law): 
a =E· € 
(2.1) 
Even at these small deformations the apparent Young's modulus E is a function 
of the rate of strain. This shows that E is not solely determined by the energy elastic 
deformation of bond angles, bond lengths, and intermolecular distances but also 
involves time-dependent displacements of atoms and small atom-groups. In the fol-
lowing region (1 to about 5% of strain) stress and strain are no longer proportional 
to each other, structural and conformational rearrangements occur that are me-
chanically although not thermodynamically reversible, one speaks of an elastic (vis-
coelastic in the narrow sense) or paraelastic behavior. Beyond the yield point large 
scale reorientation of chains and lamellar crystals begins, a process generally termed 
plastic deformation. A true plastic deformation can be understood as the transfor-
mation from one equilibrium state to another equilibrium state without the creation 
of frozen-in tensions. The latter point is particularly important in view of the fact

2. Structure and Deformation 
that the average post-yield deformation is brought about largely by mechanically 
reversible anelastic conformational changes of the molecules and not by flow of 
molecules past each other. Unless a state of equilibrium had been established through 
proper annealing treatment highly drawn samples may retract considerably. Within 
the context of this book emphasis should be placed, however, not so much on the 
processes leading to or accompanying molecular reorientation - which is basically 
a reinforcing effect - but on the damaging processes of chain scission, void forma-
tion, and flow. The latter processes gradually occur in the strain region from just 
before the yield point up to final fracture. Among the damaging processes one has 
also to include the phenomenon of normal stress yielding or crazing of glassy poly-
mers which will be discussed in Chapter 9. 
In oriented fibers generally a slightly non-linear anelastic deformation up to brittle 
fracture is observed, shish-kebabs seem to deform by transformation of lamellar into 
fibrillar material [217]. Ultra-high modulus filaments (ofPE) show a strongly strain-
rate dependent yield point. At strain rates of € > 3 . 10-3 S-1, however, the PE fila-
ments break in a brittle manner at stresses of up to 1.2 GPa [190]. This subject, the 
fracture of oriented or ultra-drawn fibers will be resumed in Chapter 8. 
2. Elastomers 
At the time of this writing it is exactly 50 years since Kuhn [191] presented his fa-
mous concept on the conformation of chain-like molecules. The representation of 
a chain by statistical links Kuhn had applied for the first time, has established the 
theoretical basis in such different fields as rubber elasticity, flow- and stress-mduced 
optical anisotropy or, as already discussed in Section A, of the structure of amor-
phous polymers. Kuhn [191, 192], Guth and Mark [193], and Meyer and Ferri [194] 
also realized that the elastic response of an ideally flexible chain depends on the change 
of entropy accompanying its elongation and not on the change of internal energy. 
Application of the Gauss approximation of chain-end distances to a rubbery net-
work (which is then called a "Gaussian Network") yields the following relation be-
tween uniaxial stress 0, extension ratio A and shear modulus G: 
0= G{A-1/A2). 
(2.2) 
The shear modulus G is proportional to the absolute temperature T, Boltzmann 
constant k, and the number N of sub chains between cross-links. For polymer chains 
of number average molecular weight M which are subsequently cross-linked, one ob-
tains: 
G = NkT = pRT(1-2Me/M)/Me 
(2.3) 
where Me is the number-average molecular weight of the sub chains and p is the 
polymer density. 
The stress-strain curve as given by Eq. (2.2) is plotted in Figure 2.12 using a value 
of G of 0.4 MPa; it is compared with the experimental data of Treloar [59]. The 
Gaussian approximation, which breaks down at higher strains, has been refmed in

several ways to account for this discrepancy [see for instance the general references 
59,186,195]. In Chapter 5 it will be necessary to analyze in particular the elastic 
behavior of flexible chains at very high elongations where one has to expect notable 
energy-elastic contributions to the axial chain stresses (and thus to stress-induced 
chain scission). 
3. Phenomenological Theory of Viscoelasticity 
A purely elastic deformation is mechanically completely reversible and does not in-
volve chain scission or creep. A real rubber or thermoplastic polymer, however, like 
any viscoelastic solid, shows on a molecular scale energy and entropy elastic defor-
mation accompanied by viscous flow. Thus it shows stress relaxation at constant 
strain, creep at constant load, and energy dissipation in dynamic excitation. Rep-
resentation of the macroscopic mechanical response of viscoelastic solids - even in a 
strain region where no large-scale reorientation occurs - requires, therefore, the use 
of damped elastic elements consisting of springs (modulus G) and rate sensitive damp-
ing elements (dashpots characterized by a viscosity 1/). The simplest elements are the 
Maxwell element with spring (G) and dashpot (1/) in series and the Voigt (Kelvin) 
element with spring G and dashpot 1/ in parallel. The Maxwell element has a relax-
33 

2. Structure and Deformation 
ation time T = 'T//G, the Voigt-Kelvin element has the same relaxation time which here 
more precisely is called retardation time. The phenomenological theory of viscoelas-
ticity [55] describes the mechanical response of a body in terms of a distribution of 
basic viscoelastic elements primarily characterized by their relaxation times Tj. If the 
spectra of the molecular relaxation times, H (lnT), are known, then the viscoelastic 
modulus functions are, in principle, derivable therefrom [14c, 14d, 55]. The time-
dependent stress relaxation modulus in shear G(t) becomes in terms of a continuous 
spectrum of relaxation times: 
+00 
G(t) = Ge + f H exp( -tIT) dinT 
(2.4) 
where Ge is the modulus at infinite times which - in the case of a solid - is sup-
posedly larger than zero. The dynamic modulus functions are conveniently treated 
as complex quantities consisting of a (recoverable) storage and an (irrecoverable) loss 
component; the ratio ofloss (e.g. Gil) and storage component (G') is called the loss 
tangent or loss factor, i.e. tan [) = Gil /G'. The phenomenological theory of viscoelas-
ticity is based on a linear system of differential equations, i.e. on the linear additivity 
of the effects of mechanical history. It should be emphasized that the aim of that 
theory is not so much to derive the form of the relaxation time spectra from de-
tailed structural considerations but rather to utilize the response functions obtained 
in one experiment, e.g. creep, to predict the response of the same material under 
different excitations, e.g. dynamic loading [14, 55]. The general application of this 
approach is restricted to the linear range of response, i.e. to strains smaller than 0.5% 
[196-200]. Beyond that limit strain-softening occurs. Thus, Koppelmann et al. 
[198] and Rahaman et al. [199], observed a small decrease ofG', an increase in Gil 
and in the activation volume for creep for PMMA, PEMA, PnBM, and PA 66. In fact, 
Wendorff [201] and Jansson [202] associate with the deviation from a linear behav-
ior the appearance of the first defects. In a formal manner the theory of viscoelastic-
ity has been extended into the non-linear range [14d], it has also been adapted to 
account for limited changes in the structure and/or of the orientation of the stressed 
system [14e]. In the context of this book use will be made of the established results 
of the phenomenological theory as well as of the "molecular theory" of viscoelasticity 
[55-57], particularly of the molecular friction coefficient introduced in it. 
B. Molecular Description 
A kinetic theory of fracture intends to interrelate the motion and response of mole-
cules to the ultimate properties of a stressed sample. A kinetic theory, therefore, 
entails a molecular description of the deformation of the microscopically hetero-
geneous and anisotropic aggregates of chains to such an extent that critical defor-
mation processes can be identified. The macroscopic deformation of any aggregate 
potentially involves the deformation, displacement, and/or reorientation of so dif-
ferent substructural elements as bond vectors, chain segments or crystal lamellae. 
The molecular origin of observed deformation mechanisms have been elucidated 
34 

II. Deformation 
by various spectroscopic methods - including mechanical relaxation spectroscopy -
and by the previously listed tools which characterize the morphology. They are 
supplemented by dynamic scattering and diffraction techniques [52, 53]. 
The following molecular description of the uniaxial straining of unoriented 
semicrystalline polyethylene characterizes the ductile deformation of fiber-forming 
spherulitic thermoplastics and may serve to illustrate the large variety of deforma-
tion mechanisms involved. At small strains of less than one per cent one observes 
the anisotropic elastic response of the (orthorhombic) PE crystallites [57] and of 
the amorphous material [53]. At the same time those anelastic deformations of 
CH2-groups and chain segments occur that characterize the low temperature (3-, 'Y-, 
and o-relaxation mechanisms [10, 56]. At larger strains (1 to 5 per cent) additional 
chain segments change their relative position and conformational changes are ini-
tiated (bond rotation). A detailed study on the behavior of the chains within amor-
phous regions had been carried out by Petraccone et al. [53]. In crystalline regions 
subjected to strains of this order, dislocations and dislocation networks are generated 
(in lamellar crystals observed by means of moire patterns). Depending on environ-
mental parameters and the type of the dislocations their movement leads to crystal 
plastic deformation through twinning or slip or to a phase transformation from the 
orthorhombic to a monoclinic unit cell. An extensive review on the deformation 
behavior of polymer single crystals has been given by Sauer et al. [57] and in the book 
of Wunderlich [3]; a detailed account of the contribution of the various structural 
elements and defects to the deformation of semicrystalline polymers is found in the 
literature in a large number of papers of which only a few have been cited here [47-
62]. Although the above mentioned effects lead to a non-linear stress-strain response, 
the initially present substructure is still maintained. Such a deformation is called non-
disruptive. 
Still larger stresses cause a destruction of the substructure, involving reorienta-
tion of chain segments and oflamellar crystals (crystal rotation, chain tilt and slip), 
opening-up of voids, and the first breakages of chains take place. These processes 
account for the ductile deformation. At this stage the mechanical energy input is 
largely dissipated as heat as shown in later Chapters. Since the deformation proceeds 
at an almost constant level of engineering stress it has generally been termed plastic 
deformation - although on a molecular basis it does not correspond to the plastic 
deformation of metals. The initial post-yield deformation of PE is predominantly 
not brought about by mechanically irreversible flow. In a strain region of up to 
about 50 per cent the lamellar crystals slip and/or orient their a-axes perpendicular 
to the draw direction. The coaxes (chain axes) assume a preferred angle of 35 to 40° 
with respect to the draw direction. The latter orientation, however, is reversible and 
changes into a random distribution if external stresses are removed [61]. In a strain 
region of between 100 and 400 per cent an increasing c-axis orientation in the draw 
direction is observed. In tIus strain region the polymer undergoes the important 
transition from a spherulitic to a fibrillar structure. According to Peterlin [62] micro-
fibrils with lateral dimensions of 20 to 40 nm are formed which contain nearly un-
modified blocks of folded chains broken away from crystal lamellae but still inter-
connected by unfolded sections of tie molecules. A model of the fibrillar structure 
of a highly drawn fiber is shown in Fig. 2.6. The originally random distribution of 
35 

2. Structure and Deformation 
chain segments and crystal blocks has become highly oriented. The load carrying 
capability of such a structure is - as will be studied in considerable detail - many 
times larger than that of the unoriented, spherulitic sample. 
The principle mechanism pennitting the large defonnation of the springy or hard-
elastic semi-crystalline polymers is the "adhesive fracture" between contacting lamellar 
crystals and their bending. The retractive forces are provided by stretched intercon-
necting fibrils and, as pointed out by G6ritz [50, 140] and Wool [203], by the adhe-
sive free energy. 
A specific mechanism during large deformation of elastomers, to which attention 
must be drawn at this point is the strain-induced crystallization [59, 186,204]. The 
basic deformation behavior of elastomeric networks will be discussed in relation with 
that of a single chain. Excellent general introductions into rubber elasticity are given 
by Treloar [59] and Eirich [186]. 
Most of the above results have been obtained by analysis of X-ray diffraction 
patterns. In recent years considerable additional information on the behavior of in-
dividual chain segments or whole chains has become available through neutron 
scattering studies [179,182], Fourier transfonn infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy [180, 
206] and fluorescence spectroscopy [180, 207]. Thus, it results from recent SANS 
studies that on the scale of the radius of gyration the molecular coils in an isotropic 
amorphous polymer (PMMA) defonn affinely if the polymer is stretched below or 
above T g to between 60 and 170% [205]. Detailed infonnation on a segmental level, 
e.g. on rotational transitions between isomers during the plastic defonnation has be-
come available through the FTIR technique [206]; its results will be discussed and used 
in Chapters 7 and 8. 
The described molecular defonnation processes affect the macroscopic fracture 
behavior of a given high polymer. The relative magnitudes of the different defonna-
tion modes completely detennine: 
the level of stress and strain to be attained in non disruptive defonnation 
the volume density of elastically stored energy 
the rates of energy dissipation and local heating 
chain elongation, network reorientation and possible strain hardening 
chain sciSSion, void formation, and other fonns of structural weakening. 
III. Model Representation of Deformation 
For the interpretation of the complex mechanical response of a highly anisotropic 
polymeric network it is indispensable to have a simplifying model representation 
of the arrangement and interaction of the structural elements and of their deforma-
tion. Such model representations will be useful in the further investigations which 
necessarily focus on some aspects while averaging or neglecting a large number of 
others. In this section one would like to characterize the assumptions made on the 
geometry and mode of interaction of structural elements in basic theories of the 
deformation of a composite body. These theories had been developed to account 
for the behavior at small strains. They can be extended into theories of strength if 
36 

III. Model Representation of Deformation 
and only iffailure criteria are introduced which become effective within the range 
of validity of the particular deformation theory. 
There is a large body of literature on the purely elastic interaction of non-pris-
matic structural elements within a deformed "composite" solid (e.g. 63-70); this 
literature also forms part of the theoretical foundation of the behavior of viscoelastic 
composite solids. While not generally discussing these foundations three groups of 
model descriptions of multi-phase materials will be singled out: 
those of Voigt [63], Reuss [64], or Takayanagi [71] which assume a homogeneous 
distribution of strain or stress, 
the calculations of Kerner [65], Hashin [66], van der Poel [67], or Uemura et al. 
[72] which minimize the elastic energy of a system containing assumedly spheri-
cal inclusions, and 
the empirically modified models of Eilers [68], Guth [69], Mooney [70], and 
Nielsen [73] which are based on the original calculations of Einstein [74], where 
the disturbances of an elastic field in the vicinity of - and caused by - completely 
rigid, spherical inclusions is considered. 
It is to be investigated which chain properties are effectively recognized by 
these groups of model descriptions of polymer deformation. One knows that the 
semicrystalline samples discussed previously are polycrystalline solids containing 
dispersed amorphous regions with frequently ill-defined boundaries and equally ill-
defined interaction between amorphous and crystalline regions. In a direct approach 
Takayanagi [63] represented semicrystalline polymers by "diagrams" (Fig. 2.13) in-
volving straight boundaries and conditions of plane stress or strain. He obtained a 
meaningful interpretation of the relative contributions of crystalline and amorphous 
phases to the complex moduli of these materials. The Takayanagi approach can well 
accomodate information on the deformation behavior of individual crystalline [57] 
or amorphous regions [53] that becomes available from other sources. In the analysis 
of e.g. the response of a fiber to dynamic loading through a Takayanagi diagram the 
nature of chain segment orientation is considered in detail but likely distributions 
of chain length and axial chain stresses do not enter the model. 
The two-shell model of Kerner [65] conforms to the conditions of the second 
group of models. The dilatation of a spherical inclusion surrounded by a homo-
geneous medium is derived subject to the condition that displacements and tractions 
at the surface of the inclusion are continuous. The homogeneous medium is supposed 
to have the elas~ic properties of the composite as a whole. The model interrelates

2. Structure and Deformation 
shear (Gi) and compressive (Ki) moduli (or Poisson's ratios Vi) of an arbitrary num-
ber of isotropic elements with the macroscopic moduli Gc and Kc. 
In the case of isotropic inclusions of an elastic shear modulus Gf comparable to 
that of the matrix, Gm , Eq. (2.5) describes the variation of the complex shear 
modulus, Gt, of the composite as a function of the volume content Vf of the dis-
crete phase: 
Gt = (1 - Vf) G:':t + (a + Vf) Gf 
G:':t (1 +aVr)G:':t +a(l-Vf)Gf 
(2.5) 
The quantity a is derived from the Poisson's ratio vm as: 
(2.6) 
As will be noted no molecular anisotropies and no effects due to size and size 
distribution of the particles of the discrete phase are recognized. Through 
E* = 2(1 + v)G* Eq. (2.5) can be used to predict also the complex tensile modulus. 
A good example for the applicability of Eq. (2.5) is furnished by the experimental 
data obtained by Dickie et al. [75]. For the dynamic tensile modulus of a physical 
mixture (polymer blend) of 75% by weight polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA, con-
tinuous phase) and 25% butylacrylate (PBA, discrete phase) within experimental 
error correspondence of calculated and measured data was obtained (Fig. 2.l4, 
solid curves). A copolymer of equal volumetric composition, where 25% by volume 
of the elastomeric butylacrylate had been grafted onto PMMA, yielded the experi-
mental data points shown. In the region between the glass transition temperatures 
of the PBA (-20°C) and of the PMMA (at these conditions 160°C) a difference 
between the response of the mixture and of the graft copolymer can be observed. 
This difference can be related to the existence of the primary bonds which connect 
matrix and inclusion and which lead to frozen-in stresses. 
A three-shell model of a two-phase solid was proposed by van der Poel ([67], 
Fig. 2.15). An interior sphere representing a hard component (Gf, Kf, Vf) is sur-
rounded by a soft shell (Ga , Ka , Va), and by a continuum, for which the elastic 
moduli G and K are being calculated in terms of the mentioned elastic constants 
and of the volume concentration (Vf ) of the hard component. The condition of

mechanical equilibrium under shear and hydrostatic pressure leads to an explicit 
expression for K and to a complicated determinant for G which has to be solved 
numerically and for each individual system. The van der Poel approach had yielded 
the best results in describing the elasticity of elastomers highly filled (up to 50 vol.%) 
with mineral fillers (see e.g. [77]). Again no orientation distributions or physical an-
isotropies of the constituent particles enter the model. 
As mentioned frequently the mechanical and optical response of molecules -
and of their crystallites - is highly anisotropic. Depending on the property under 
consideration the carriers of the molecular anisotropy are the bond vectors (infra· 
red dichroism), chain segments (optical and mechanical anisotropy), or the end-to-
end vectors of chains (rubber elastic properties). For the representation of the ensu-
ing macroscopic anisotropies one has to recognize, therefore, the molecular aniso-
tropy and the orientation distribution of the anisotropic molecular units (Fig. 1.9.). 
Since these are essentially one-dimensional elements their distribution and orienta-
tion behavior can be treated as that of rods; such a model had been used successfully 
to explain the optical anisotropy [78], and the anisotropies of thermal conductivity 
[79], thermal expansion or linear compressibility [80], and Young's modulus [59, 
65,80,81] of rubbers and oriented thermoplastics. The rod models focus on the 
large anisotropies which exhibit properties such as the polarizability or the retractive 
elastic forces; only two components of such a property, namely that in chain axis 
direction and that perpendicular to it enter the model as independent parameters. 
For example the macroscopic elastic response of an aggregate of randomly, 
partly, or well oriented chains can be represented by that of a corresponding dis-
tribution of one-dimensional finite elements (Fig. 2.16) if the following conditions 
are fulfilled: 
external forces P cause a homogeneous local strain which determines the axial 
stress t/I ({), <p, t) of a chain segment 
forces between chains are not transferred by shear or bending moments 
the state of stress at any arbitrary point A is given as the integral over all the 
traction forces exerted by the chain segments intersecting the surface of a volume 
element enclosing the point A [82].

A, and orientation distribution p was derived by Hsiao [82] as a special case of the 
Voigt-model employing a homogeneous distribution of strain: 
(2.7) 
Here the summation convention of repeated indices is used. The Si are the com-
ponents of the unit vector in the principal axis directions and w the solid angle. Into 
this model only one molecular elastic component enters: the axial chain modulus. 
Any interactions by shear or in a direction perpendicular to the chain axes cannot 
be accounted for. It should only be applied, therefore, if these interactions can be 
meaningfully neglected. 
A much more general representation of either different or differently oriented 
molecular domains can be achieved, of course, through three-dimensional elements. 
In the case of transverse symmetry the molecular elements must be characterized 
by 5 elastic constants (compliances), the orientation of one or two axes, and the 
condition of stress and strain at the boundary of an element. Voigt [63] based his 
calculations on the assumption that there be no discontinous change of strain at 
any boundary; Reuss [64] made the assumption of homogeneous stress. Following 
either Voigt or Reuss the space averaging over the elastic constants Cijrnn or elastic 
compliances Sijrnn of the molecular domains leads to the upper or lower bound res-
pectively of the macroscopic moduli [83]. For an affinely deforming aggregate of 
such elements Ward [84] and later Kausch [85] have calculated the macroscopic 
elastic moduli as a function of domain orientation. The calculated curves for the 
change of the elastic moduli with draw ratio are particularly characterized by the 
rate of change and by the extent of change ultimately attained. If only reorienta-
tion of otherwise unchanged molecular domains occurs in drawing, the properties 
of a "completely" oriented sample must correspond to the properties of the mole-
cular domains. In Figure 2.17 the calculated changes of Young's modulus in the direc-
tion of draw as a function of draw ratio and domain anisotropy are represented in

comparison to experimental data [13, 85]. The findings of Ward and Kausch may 
be summarized by saying: 
the orientation behavior of amorphous thermoplastics (PS, PMMA, PVC) could 
be represented by the affme deformation of domains (cf. also [205]) 
the observed data for PS, PMMA, and PVC were in agreement with the assump-
tion of homogeneous stress at the boundaries of the orienting domains, the data 
for PC were better in agreement with a condition of homogeneous strain 
the orienting molecular domains have comparatively small elastic anisotropies 
(S3333/s1111-values ranging from 0.5 to 1), the axial compliances being more 
than an order of magnitude larger than those of the chains; this indicates that 
the domains are not equivalent to chains, micro-crystallites, or fringe micelles; 
if such domains do have a physical significance in amorphous polymers then they 
must be considered to be sections or aggregates of chain segments with a stiffness 
about twice as large as that of the sample as a whole [13] 
- the concept of affinely orienting lamellae in semicrystalline polymers is only a 
crude approximation [13, 87-89, 106]. 
The mathematical representation of the elastic behavior of oriented hetero-
geneous solids can be somewhat improved through a more appropriate choice of the 
boundary conditions such as proposed by Hashin and Shtrikman [66] and Stern-
stein and Lederle [86]. In the case of lamellar polymers the formalisms developed 
for reinforced materials are quite useful [87, 88,147]. An extensive review on the 
experimental characterization of the anisotropic and non-linear viscoelastic behavior 
of solid polymers and of their model interpretation had been given by Hadley and 
Ward [89]. In order to describe polymer microstructure and deformation models will 
generally be used which are based on the rotational isometric state theory (see IA and 
C and [117-121,214-216]). Some other concepts such as the theory of paracrys-
tals [9, 90] and the meander model [10,11] have also been proposed. They will briefly 
he presented here although it seems that in the context of this book they do not offer 
additional insight.

2. Structure and Deformation 
The theory of paracrystals recognized that chain molecules form three-dimen-
sionallattices and establish a certain long range order between members of the same 
lattice while postulating at the same time that in a real solid the lattice will be dis-
torted. The degree of lattice distortion is measured by the variation in length that 
the three distance vectors ai between corresponding lattice points encounter if moved 
in the three lattice directions. If the dimensionless relative mean fluctuations gik of 
the distance vectors Ilj are all zero the structure is crystalline and if all gik > 0.1 it 
is amorphous. The gik provide a quantitative measure of the colloidal structure of 
micro heterogeneous solids. If for instance g13 and g23 are large compared with the 
other gik we deal with the nematic state (segments parallel but at random distances), 
if g31 and g32 are large compared with the other gik we have a smectic state where 
the segments arrange in layers [9]. The relative paracrystalline distance fluctuation 
was shown to be inversely related to the maximum number of network planes within 
one micro domain [9]. The gik are obtained from line profile measurements in small 
angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). 
Hosemann's schematic representation of a two-dimensional paracrystalline lattice 
is given in Figure 2.18. If we interpret a superstructure (e.g. the fibrillar structure 
shown in Fig. 2.6) in terms of paracrystals rather than crystals we arrive at the 
very same size and orientation distribution of the scattering elements - be they 
crystallites or paracrystals. The differences in interpretation become apparent, how-
ever, if intercrystalline rearrangements in annealing, during deformation, or after 
irradiation are discussed [9]. 
The general concept that there are only gradual differences between the more 
or less ordered regions of polymers is also employed by Pechhold and his co-workers 
in their quantitative microstructural theory (Kinkenmodell) of deformation [10,208-
211]. Pechhold recognizes that chain molecules exist in energetically different states 
of rotational isomers between which - cooperative and mostly rapid - transitions 
can be accomplished. He bases his quantitative thermodynamical calculations on kink 
isomers, which show only a small departure from the extended planar chain and are 
most likely to form bundles ([11], Fig. 2.1 c). The neighbouring chains within such 
bundle form various pairs of segments (cf. Fig. 1.12) which have different volumes, 
axial lengths and interaction energies. The concentration of kinks determines the 
axial extension of the bundle. In the partition function of a bundle of chains all these 
quantities enter; the partition function relates, therefore, the kink concentration with 
bundle geometry and internal and free energy of the isomers. Consequently the 
elastic compliances of a transversely isotropic bundle of chains could be determined 
as a function of kink concentration, kink block size, width of kink steps, and tem-
perature [10, 11,208-211]. The anelastic and plastic deformation may be inter-
preted in terms of successive dislocation motion and slip of bundle surface areas. 
The kink model offers in principle a molecular description of polymer structure. Again 
there are only gradual differences between ordered and non-ordered regions. Pechhold 
estimates that an apparently perfect PE-crystallite may contain up to 4 kinks per 
1000 CH2 -groups whereas in a melt-like structure this concentration is about 200 in 
1000. Although this concentration is so large as to annihilate all close and long range 
order some logical principles should govern the space filling through chain molecules. 
Pechhold generated appropriate patterns, the honeycomb- and the meander model

pology in which a melt bundle can tightly superfold, in order to fill densely 3-dimen-

is an arrangement of meander cubes [208-211] which are shown in Figure 2.19. In

fertilized the efforts to study the structure of amorphous rc:lgions. 
The close geometrical description of the arrangement of chain molecules within 
bundles offered by the kink-model have been used by Kroner and Anthony [14g, 
99] to develop a quantitative non-linear deformation theory based on the structure 
defect "disclination". The meander model, then, is reduced to a particular arrange-
ment of disclinations. 
With regard to the elucidation of phenomena occurring during crack propaga-
tion in polymers it is generally not necessary to consider intracrystalline processes in 
detail. If, however, the intracrystalline segments of tie molecules are concerned then 
one has to be aware of the fact that the intermolecular interaction determines what 
forces can be transmitted onto these chain segments and whether or not these forces 
are large enough to cause chain scission. 
Thus far model representations of polymer deformation have been discussed. 
Each of those could be converted into a model representing the fracture behavior 
if it were possible to formulate an adequate fracture criterion within the range of 
validity of these models. Having dealt with deformation the fracture criteria to be 
formulated would have to involve finite extensibility, critical load, or limited volume 
concentration of stored or dissipated energy. Dealing with fracture one will find 
that strain, stress, and energy are not sufficient as variables and that one will have 
to add at least two new dimensions: time and structural discontinuity. This will be 
explained in the following Chapter.

the thermal diffusivity a = A/Cpp of oriented polyethylenes that the intrinsic anisotropy 
Ai of the orienting, partly crystalline lamellar clusters increases with the degree of crystal-
linity (Ai = 7 to 26, linear extrapolation yields Ai = 2 for the fully amorphous and Ai = 50 
for a completely crystalline cluster); the average degree of orientation of the lamellae, 
< cos2,9 >, as determined from thermal measurements agrees very well with X-ray data; 
the observed increase of orientation with draw ratio is more rapid than it would be in 
affine deformation.

I. I ntrod uction 
Test specimens loaded under laboratory conditions, but also regular engineering com-
ponents fracturing in service, provide many different data which lend themselves to 
evaluation of the fracture process. These data are, for instance, the time to onset 
and completion of fracture, details of the fracture pattern (ductile or brittle frac-
ture, appearance of the breaking specimen and of the fracture surface), crack dynam-
ics, and change in physical or chemical properties. Naturally the most straight-
forward evaluation of a test or a set of data is the direct correlation of the property 
of interest (e.g., time under stress) to the environmental parameter(s) of interest 
(e.g., stress and temperature). In Figure 1.4 a set of data with just these variables has 
been plotted (PVC pipes under internal pressure). If one uses such a plot a number 
of questions arise: 
what is the statistical significance of an individual data point 
what are the failure conditions and how do they depend on external parameters 
and material properties 
what is the likely cause of failure 
what conclusions can be drawn with respect to extrapolating the set of curves 
into hitherto non-accessible regions of time, pressure, or temperature? 
51 

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
The first of these points will be commented upon subsequently in connection 
with an interpretation of the statistical variability of fracture events. To answer 
this and the second question the highly developed tools of statistical analysis (e.g., 
1-2) are available; their application forms a backbone of industrial quality control 
and material design. Understandably, the complex input (mechanical, thermal, and 
environmental attack) acting upon a complex system (e. g., a highly structured 
polymer) has a complex, non-deterministic output. The determination and evaluation 
of only a small number of different data will necessarily reveal only a partial aspect 
of the fracture process. For this reason the questions as to cause and kinetics of 
fracture development can rarely be answered unambiguously. Any mathematical 
inte"elations established between variables (e.g., time and stress) are valid for ex-
trapolation only if the basis does not change. 
In this chapter an overview of conceptually different fracture theories is pre-
sented which have in common that they do not make explicite reference to the 
characteristic properties of the molecular chains, their configurational and super-
molecular order and their thermal and mechanical interaction. This will be seen 
to apply to the classical failure criteria and general continuum mechanical models. 
Rate process fracture theories take into consideration the viscoelastic behavior of 
polymeric materials but do not derive their fracture criteria from detailed mor-
phological analysis. These basic theories are invaluable, however, to elucidate 
statistical, non-morphological, or continuum mechanical aspects of the fracture 
process. 
II. Statistical Aspects 
Experimentally determined quantities (observables) such as strength, time to frac-
ture, or concentration of free radicals show a wide scatter of values; they are sto-
chastic variables. As an extreme example of a stochastic variable in Figure 3.1 the 
service lives t of 500 HDPE-tubes under identical test conditions are plotted in the 
form of a histogram [3]. The distribution shown can be represented by a logarithmic 
normal distribution (Fig. 3.2) with a mean oflg tlh equal to 2.3937 and a variance 
of s = 0.3043. The expectation value of the time to fracture of a specimen subject 
to the test condition employed is the time which corresponds to the mean value of 
the (logarithmic) distribution, here 247.6 h. The actually determined values of t 
evidently scatter widely around this expectation value. Nevertheless even such a 
distribution can be characterized by testing just a few randomly selected specimens. 
For a normally distributed observable any three random values cover on the average 
a range of 1.69 s - which contains in 86% of all cases the mean value of the (in-
finite) distribution also [3]. This extreme example has been chosen to emphasize the 
meaning of stochastic variables with which one is dealing subsequently. It was also 
intended to show the significance of small samples - containing 3 to 10 members 
- which are generally used in practice to establish correlations between stochastic 
variables and environmental or material parameters. At this point we are not going 
to talk further about the statistical reduction of such a set of data. Here we are in-
terested in the information which may be drawn from such a statistical analysis.

From a statistical standpoint, the variability of a material property, e.g., frac-
ture strength, is explained by referring to one or more of the following three ar-
guments: 
1. The beginning of fracture is a statistical event, the occurrence of which is de-
scribed by probability laws. 
2. Apparently identical specimens of a set are inherently different, e.g., they contain a 
large number of flaws of different size or severeness and the most severe of these 
flaws determines the fracture strength. 
3. The load to which a sample is subjected until it fractures activates a large 
number of molecular processes. The uncertainty of the cumulative event, e.g., mac-
S3 

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
roscopic failure, then results from the uncertainty of the molceular events and the 
mode of correlation of these events. 
The first argument (fracture is a statistical event) would lead to the following 
general equation for the rate of change of the number N of members belonging to 
one ensemble: 
dN/dt=-NK 
(3.1) 
where K may be a function of N, stress, stress history, temperature, or other en-
vironmental parameters. For a number N of statistically equal, independent and 
separately loaded units the rate function Kin Eq. (3.1) is independent of N, but 
generally a function of time. Equation (3.1) is readily solved with respect to the 
number N(t) of surviving units: 
N(t) = Noexp [ - ~ K(r) dr ] 
(3.2) 
where No is their initial number. The fraction of units broken after some time tb 
is obviously 1 - N(tb)/No and the cumulative distribution function of lifetimes, 
Q(tb), therefore is: 
Q(tb) = 1 - exp [_£b K(r) dr ] . 
(3.3) 
The average lifetime, < tb >, is solely determined by K and becomes for constant K: 
1 
00 
< tb > = -
f tNoK exp (-Kt) dt = K- 1 . 
No 0 
(3.4) 
It may be noted that in this case the life expectancy of a surviving unit is at any 
time independent of Nand t. This is equivalent to the assumption that the residual 
strength is equal to the initial strength, i.e., that no aging or deterioration has taken 
place in the stressed sample. The rate K of failure occurrence can be determined 
experimentally from the scatter of tb [4]. Using this assumption Kawabata and 
Blatz [5] developed a simple stochastic theory of creep failure. They argued that the 
first moments of tb for an ensemble of ruptured specimens should reveal whether 
or not K is independent of time. If K depends only on initial load and is independent 
of N the equation 
K = (m!/< tgt »l/m 
(3.5) 
should hold for any m, that is for any order of moments of tb. An investigation of 
the variability of fracture times in the special case of a rubber vulcanizate gave ex-
cellent agreement with the assumption of a time-independent K as used in Eq. (3.4). 
The same conclusion was drawn by Narisawa et al. [82] from the exponential de-
crease ofN(t) with t of imiaxially stressed PA 6 monofilaments. The general indepen-
dence of K from time seems to be doubtful, however, especially if the samples are 
exposed to accelerating environments [87]. 
54 

II. Statistical Aspects 
In other experiments Kawabata et al. [6] investigated the failure statistics of 
carbon-filled styrene butadien rubber (SBR). They arrived at the conclusion that 
either the coefficient relating stress and rate of failure is increasing with time or 
that several local fracture events must be independently initiated before the rubber 
specimen breaks. The best fit of their theory with experiments was obtained for a 
critical number of 3 to 4 microscopic fracture events as nucleus for unstable crack 
formation. For the asymmetric distribution of times-to-fracture shown in Figure 3.2 
the relation Eq. (3.5) is also not valid for higher orders of m (m equal to or larger 
than two). This means either that the probability density K for pipe failure is smaller 
for specimens having a longer service life or that K is a function of loading time. In 
the first case it must be assumed that from the beginning the specimens had not 
been statistically identical, in the second that they underwent structural changes 
affecting K. The first assumption seems to be valid for pipe failure through creep 
crack development. The investigations of Stockmayer [83] recently have shown that 
nature and location of material inhomogeneities largely determine the creep lives 
tb of LDPE pipes. Morphological parameters thus account for more than half of 
< tl > [84]. The conclusion that structural differences exist and affect K must be 
drawn for other materials as well which exhibit a log-normal distribution of tb values 
[3, 83-85]. These aspects will have to be discussed in later sections in terms of 
detailed structural models of the failing specimens. 
Without reference to any such models and based purely on statistical considera~ 
tions, Coleman and Marquardt developed their important theory of breaking kinetics 
of fibers (reviewed in ref. 7). They especially investigated the distribution of life-
times of fibers under constant or periodic load and the effects of fiber length, rate 
of loading, and bundle size on the strength of filaments or bundles thereof (Figs. 
3.3 and 3.4). Two statistical effects should be noted: the lower strength of a bundle 
as compared with that of a monofilament (due to the accelerating increase in failure 
probability K after rupture of the first filament within a bundle) and the increase of 
strength with loading rate here derived from the reduced time each filament spends 
at each load level. The authors [8] determined the average tensile strengths of 
IS-denier 66 nylon monofils and that of an infinite bundle; the strength values are 
plotted as a function ofloading rate in Figure 3.3. 
In recent years, the evaluation of the statistical aspects of fracture has been greatly 
furthered by Phoenix [88-91]. He extends the breaking kinetics of bundles to random 
variation in fiber strength and imperfect fiber migration, obtains the asymptotic dis-
tribution for the time to failure oflarge bundles, and applies his model to the break-
down of fibrous materials (twisted yams and cables, unidirectional composites). In 
the latter approach he partitioned the fibrous composite into a series of m short sec-
tions called "bundles" each containing n fiber elements oflength Lt, where Lt was to 
correspond to the effective stress transfer length (see Chapter 5 for definition). Thus, 
the composite is modelled as a weakest-link arrangement of its m independent bundles; 
it has a total length mL and a volume mnL. Phoenix assumed that single fiber lifetimes 
could be described by a Weibull distribution with shape parameter {3. As an example, 
it may be cited that the lifetime distribution for a Kevlar 49/epoxy vessel is quite well 
represented by this approach.

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
The above considerations on the influence of specimen geometry and fluctuation 
of material properties play an important role in the transformation of laboratory re-
sults into real-life expectation value·s. The statistical implications of such transforma-
tions and the models used are discussed by Juillard et Mozzo [92]. 
The large scatter of strength values and the dependency on sample geometry has 
also been explained by introducing the concept of flaws of different degrees of sever-
ity. This means substituting one statistical variable (e.g., underlying strength) for 
another one (e.g., macroscopic strength or time to failure). Even though such a sub-
stitution leaves the nature of the microscopic defects out of consideration, it still 
allows one to obtain, from statistical analysis, some information on the size, number, 
location, and severity of these defects (or flaws). The term flaw needs some delibera-
tion. First, a flaw can be considered as an ellipsoidaUy shaped void which may act as 
a stress concentrator and as the eventual cause of instability and failure. Secondly, it 
should also be understood as a weak region containing molecular irregularities. When 
being stressed the weak region may fail, leading to a void, a craze, and/or a propagat-
ing crack and macroscopic failure. Following Epstein's statistical theory of extreme

values [9] the strength of a material volume element depends on the "severeness" of 
the most critical flaw being present within that volume element. The macroscopic 
strength distribution g(L, x) of fibers of different length L but uniform cross section 
can then be expressed as 
x 
g(L, x) = Lnof(x) [1 - J f(y)dy]LnO-l 
(3.6) 
where no is the number of flaws per unit length of fiber and f(x) the underlying 
strength distribution. For f(x) being a Gaussian distribution with mean J.l and 
variance v, the most probable strength, a*, depends on Lno as shown by the solid 
line (theory) in Figure 3.4. Also plotted are the experimental data of Levin and Savi-

ckij [10]. Even though it appears as if the experimental data would be fitted by 
the theoretical curve in the range of 103 < Lno < 106 , some caution is required. 
If indeed the inherent distribution of flaws is a Gaussian distribution, then the 
decrease of a*(Lno) with L and the variance of a(Lno) are both related to v and 
n(= Lno) in a known manner and subject to proof. A proof is also possible for other 
underlying distributions. For the data of Levin and Savickij [10] neither a Gaussian 
distribution of x, nor a Laplacian, nor a Weibull distribution describes a*(Lno) and 
v(Lno) simultaneously [11]. As a result of this analysis one may conclude that 
either the underlying distribution f(x) is truncated at the left-hand side (small values 
of x), or the variance of a is much larger than to be expected from the number of 
flaws. The truncation at small strength values could be caused by a multi-step crack 
initiation process which would require a certain time. The effect of sample volume 
on strength was also not in agreement with extreme value statistics for viscose fila-
ments, carbon fibers, and cotton yarn [12]. Fedors and Landel [13] obtained a 
doubly exponential distribution of strength values for eight SPR gum vulcanizates. 
Such a distribution derives, for example, from an underlying exponential distribu-
tion of flaw cross sections [14]. Here the volume effect was not studied. 
When dealing with underlying distributions it should be recognized that dif-
ferent regions (core, surface) of a (seemingly) homogeneous specimen may have 
different underlying distributions. Evidence of this behavior was for instance found 
in polyamide fibers [15] and LDPE pipes [84]. Depending on processing conditions 
volume-related and surface-related breakages with quite different stress-lifetime 
characteristics could be distinguished. At this point the many attempts to determine 
underlying distributions are not discussed any further but reference is made to the 
publications on this subject [11-17]. If any conclusion may be attempted from 
statistical investigations of uniaxial failure of thermoplastics it is that the underlying 
57

distribution, f(x), of natural flaws could be a Laplacian distribution possibly skewed 
at the left-hand side (small values of x). Moreover, it appears unlikely that a deter-
ministic view may be adopted associating a particular flaw with a particular strength 
(or time to failure) but rather necessary to allow for the uncertainty of multistep 
flaw growth. 
The third statistical argument (fracture as the result of a large number of molecu-
lar processes) is very old. Its application to polymers definitely was stimulated from 
many sides including fracture and fatigue of metals [4] or glasses [17] and the ther-
modynamics of reactions [19]. The interpretation offracture as a sequence of in-
dividual steps will be mainly used in the following. It necessitates a consideration 
of the correlation of such steps and of the final failure criterion. 
The discussion of the three different statistical arguments can be summarized 
by saying that in the first case (fracture as a statistical event) a property (probability 
of fracture) is attached to the material body as a whole. In the second case one 
flaw, i.e., one micro-heterogeneity (out of many), within the body is considered 
to dominate failure; in the third case many events interact, influence, and determine 
each other. The very same lines of thought used here to explain the variability of 
strength,for example, are found in the continuum mechanics, fracture mechanics, 
and molecular approach to theories of strength, respectively. 
III. Continuum and Fracture Mechanics Approach 
A. Classical Failure Criteria 
In classical continuum mechanics homogeneous isotropic materials are taken into 
consideration. Failure criteria are established on the basis that there is indeed one 
strategic material property such as uniaxial tensile strength, shear strength, elastic 
or total extensibility, or energy storage capability that determines the failure of 
the stressed sample. If, in establishing such criteria, all environmental parameters 
(e.g., temperature T, strain rate, E, or surrounding medium) are taken to be con-
stant, then failure has to be expected whenever the components of multiaxial stress 
- usually the three principal stresses ai, a2, and a3 are considered - combine in 
such a way that the strategic quantity reaches a critical value C. For different Tor 
e C may assume different values. The condition f(al' a2, a3) = C(T, e) represents 
a two-dimensional "failure surface" in three-dimensional stress space. The stable 
states of stress form a continuous body bounded by the failure surface against the 
unstable stress points. 
It has already been indicated that failure in polymeric materials may occur in 
a number of phenomenologically different ways, e.g., as brittle fracture through 
propagating cracks, as ductile fracture through plastic deformation following shear 
yielding, or as quasi-brittle fracture after normal-stress yielding (crazing). It had 
correctly been anticipated that these different phenomena respond differently to 
the magnitude and the state of stress. This means that for different fracture phe-
nomena separate failure surfaces exist which may overlap and penetrate each other. 
These facts are extensively investigated and discussed in the monographs by Ward [20] 
and Bardenheier [93] and in the general literature (e.g., 21-34). 
58 

III. Continuum and Fracture Mechanics Approach 
The cfilssical criteria were conceived to describe the failure of isotropic, elastic-
plastic solids. The physical content of the six principal criteria is in brief the follow-
ing: 
1. The maximum principle stress theory (Rankine's theory) states that the largest 
principle stress component, a3, in the material determines failure regardless of the 
value of normal or shearing stresses. The stability criterion is formulated as 
(3.7) 
In this case a* is considered a basic material property which can be determined 
from, for example, a tension test. In stress space the surface of failure according to 
the maximum stress theory is a cube. A modified form of this theory allows for a 
larger critical value a* if one of the stresses is compressive. Then the surface of failure 
is a cube again, but with the center displaced from origin. 
2. The maximum efilstic strain theory (St. Venant's theory) states that incep-
tion of failure is due if the largest local strain, E3, within the material exceeds some-
where a critical value E*. The failure criterion, therefore, is derived as 
(3.8) 
where E is the isotropic Young's modulus and IJ Poisson's ratio. The term in square 
brackets thus has to be smaller than an equivalent stress, a*. 
3. The theory of total elastic energy of deformation was first proposed by Bel-
trami. Since under high hydrostatic pressure large amounts of elastic energy may be 
stored without causing either fracture or permanent deformation, the elastic energy 
as such seems to have no significance as a limiting condition. 
4. Theory of constant elastic strain energy of distortion (Huber, v. Mises, Hen-
cky). The consideration of the poor significance of the elastically stored energy in 
hydrostatic compression or tension led to the idea of subtracting the "hydrostatic" 
part of the energy from the total amount of elastically stored energy. Thus, it is 
assumed that only the energy of distortion, W, determines the criticality of a state 
of stress. For small deformations one obtains: 
(3.9) 
5. If a limiting octahedral shearing stress, 7*, is postulated as a failure criterion 
the same mathematical expression as in Eq. (3.9) is obtained with 
9(7*)2 = 2(a*)2. 
(3.10) 
In this case the limiting condition of small deformations does not pertain. 
6. The Coulomb yield criterion states that the critical stress, 7*, for shear de-
formation to occur in any plane increases linearly with the pressure, an, applied 
normally to that plane: 
(3.11 ) 
Here the material constant 70 is given by the cohesion of the material and f.1 is 
a "coefficient of friction". If friction is neglected the Tresca yield criterion is ob-
tained. 
59 

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
The above failure (or stability) criteria do not explicitly contain time as a 
variable. One may apply them to rate sensitive materials, however, if one recognizes 
that 0* and r* will depend on stress history. The classical approach of Eyring and 
other rate theories will be discussed in Section IV of this chapter. The limits of the 
applicability of the classical criteria and of their extension to anisotropic materials 
are analyzed by Ward [20] and Bardenheier [93]. Numerous papers (e.g., 21-28) 
and review articles [29-34] have appeared which concern the geometry of failure 
surfaces of polymeric materials. Multiaxial failure experiments on elastomers which 
seem to corroborate the St. Venant criterion have been carried out [21] by Gent 
and Undley on endbonded penny-shaped samples of a natural rubber gum vulca-
nizate, by Ko on polyurethan rubber, by Oberth and Bruenner on castable elastomers 
containing solid inclusions, and by Urn [22] on tubular samples of polyurethane 
and of a butadiene/acrylic acid copolymer. Figure 3.5 depicts Lim's data and a 
failure envelope for v = 0.37 resulting from the St. Venant criterion .

Of the other theories, the Huber-v. Mises-Hencky criterion and the Coulomb 
yield criterion have received the most experimental support. The failure surface in 
the stress space described by Eq. (3.9) is a cylinder with its axis along the space 
diagonal. Traces of this cylinder with the (u 1, u2)-plane are ellipses symmetric with 
respect to the point of origin. One such ellipse is shown in Figure 3.5. The failure sur-
face corresponding to the Coulomb criterion is a cone. Its traces with the (Ul,U2)-
plane are also ellipses but displaced with regard to the origin. Elliptic traces seem 
to form the best available failure criterion in the biaxial yielding experiments with 
tubular specimens ofPMMA [23, 33], PVC [26,27], PC [27] and ofPS, PE, PP, PA, 
ABS, and CAB [33]. In the case of multi axial fracture without yielding (Trenn-
bruch) elliptic and parabolic traces are obtained which pertain to a cone or a para-
60 

III. Continuum and Fracture Mechanics Approach 
boloide in stress space [30,33]. In any event there is no strict distinction between 
the form of failure surfaces describing failure through flow and the form of the sur-
faces referring to failure through material separation (brittle fracture). This indicates 
that in these isotropic polymers the initiation of failure was strongly influenced by 
shear stresses irrespective of the ultimate material behavior. 
The careful and comprehensive analysis meanwhile carried out by Bardenheier 
[93] in terms of various stress potentials for brittle and ductile fracture of more than 
a dozen polymers has essentially confirmed the above results. 
For obvious reasons there is a strong interest in the deformation and fracture 
behavior of plastics under large hydrostatic pressures [31-32]. One should expect-
and one observes - that the rigidity of a polymer increases with pressure. Sauer et al. 
[32] report that a pressure of 3.5 kbar raises the initial Young's moduli of amorphous 
thermoplastics (PC, PI, PSU, PVC, CA) by a factor of 1.2 to 1.9, that of crystalline 
polymers by 1.4 (POM) to 7.5 (PUR). Despite the increased rigidity, ductile fracture 
occurs. The effects are not yet understood in all generality. Following the two major 
review articles on this subject by Radcliffe [31] and Sauer and Pae [32] the Coulomb 
criterion corresponds best to most pressure-yield experiments. In the case of PTFE 
and PC with their nonlinear increase of yield strength with hydrostatic pressure 
(an = p) even the conside-ration of a second-order term of p appeared to be necessary 
[32]. Whereas the application of pressure restricts the cold drawing of many ductile 
polymers, it enables yielding of normally brittle polymers, e.g., ofPS at room tem-
perature at a pressure of 2 to 3 kbar, and ofPSU and polyimides at 3 to 7 kbar [32]. 
In this chapter no molecular .interpretations of fracture phenomena are given. 
The above discussion has already shown, however, that a consideration of the three-
dimensional state of stress is not sufficient to elucidate the possible role of chain 
scission or disentanglement in failure of polymers. This is particularly true if the 
phenomenon of crazing ("normal stress yielding") is included. Before investigating 
the molecular aspects, however, in the later chapters, the presentation of general, 
non-molecular fracture theories should be continued. 
B. Fracture Mechanics 
Real solids are inhomogeneous. Even if they are one-phase materials they will con-
tain defects, voids, inclusions, flaws, cracks, and/or other inhomogeneities which 
are able to distort an otherwise homogeneous stress field. A continuum mechanical 
approach that analyzes these (singular) stress-strain fields in the vicinity of flaws 
or cracks and derives its criteria of crack stability from an energy balance considera-
tion is the fracture mechanics approach. Griffith [35] was the first to find wide 
acclaim for his considerations of the energetic changes occurring as a consequence 
of the widening of a crack (of length 2a). He equated the resulting decrease dU of 
elastic energy stored within a stressed specimen with the surface energy 'YcdA 
necessary to enlarge the crack by an infinitesimal area dA:

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
For a plate containing an elliptical hole and stressed at right angles to the major 
axis a, he obtained the stability criterion 
(3.13) 
The size of the largest material defect together with the material constants 
modulus of elasticity (E) and surface work parameter ('Yc), thus, supposedly deter-
mine the strength of the material, Le., that macroscopic value a* of uniaxial stress 
at which irreversible crack propagation begins. Equation (3.13) gives a mathematical 
form to the earlier used concept that flaw size (or severity) determines the inherent 
strength of a sample. It also explains that the actually observed macroscopic strength 
is much smaller than the theoretical strength of flawless specimens. 
The application of fracture mechanics to viscoelastic media is caught between 
the limitations that are brough about by the deviation from infinitesimal strain con-
dition, by molecular anisotropy, local concentration of strains, and the time depen-
dency of stress and strain functions. It has been notably successful in investigations 
of crack propagation. The analytical extension of Griffith's work to linearly vis-
coelastic materials has been reviewed by Williams [36], Knauss [37], and Nikitin [94]. 
In Chapter 9 a more detailed account on the application of fracture mechanics to 
crack propagation is given. There the morphological aspects and the effect of time-
dependent plastic deformation, craze initiation and growth, and chain scission on the 
energy of cohesive fracture of high polymers will be considered. 
At this point attention will be drawn to an application of the Griffith approach 
to the effect of matrix orientation on strength. Such an interpretation has been 
forwarded by Mikitishin et al. [79] and Stemstein et al. [80]. These authors suggest 
that during the orientation process a rotation, elongation, and widening of possible 
defects takes place. The change of shape and orientation changes the effect of these 
flaws as stress concentrators. They become less dangerous in a direction parallel to 
the draw direction (z) and more critical in the perpendicular direction (x). If only 
the increase in length of (elliptical) voids which are oriented parallel to the draw 
direction is considered, the lateral strength ax is derived from Eq. (3.13) as: 
(3.14) 
where A is the draw ratio. Stemstein et al. [80] have made comprehensive calcula-
tions in two dimensions of the flaw-rotation and widening effect on axial and lateral 
strength for a statistical distribution of flaw orientations and various flaw geometries. 
They compare their predictions of the lateral strength of polystyrene with the ex-
perimental data of Retting [81]. For moderate molecular weights and draw ratios 
up to 1.5 they find a correspondence to within 20%. For higher molecular weights 
and larger draw ratios the discrepancies are above 70%. 
If a crack travels at the interface of an adhesive joint one observes an adhesive 
debonding rather than cohesive failure. Except for minor differences in boundary 
condition the analgy to the fracture mechanical treatment of cohesive failure is 
complete [38-40] and the normal debonding stress a: is obtained as: 
(3.13a) 
62 

III. Continuum and Fracture Mechanics Approach 
The interpretation of 'Ya and E is rather involved. These quantities not only 
depend on the static surface free energies and elastic moduli of the interacting 
(polymeric) materials but also on the work of deformation which the adhesive layer 
undergoes in debonding and on the surface activity of a possible third phase having 
access to the debonded area [40]. 
C. Continuous Viscoelastic Models 
Under the heading of this section belongs the very fruitful model of a common 
"failure envelope" proposed by Smith [41]. It is based on a consideration of the 
viscoelastic behavior of continuous high polymer bodies, i.e., on the concept that a 
reduction according to the time-temperature superposition principle of the environ-. 
mental parameters stress, strain-rate, and temperature should lead to corresponding 
molecular states. If a fracture criterion refers indeed to unique limits of molecular 
load-carrying capability, for example, then the plotting of reduced stress at break 
versus strain at break for different experimental conditions should lead to one master 
curve, the failure envelope (Fig. 3.6). For a large number of natural and synthetic 
rubbers and vulcanizates under similar modes of mechanical excitation, this concept 
was found to hold. It thus generally allows the extrapolation of the ultimate behavior 
into unknown regimes of time, strain-rate, or temperature. An excellent review on

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
the uniaxial rupture of elastomers has been given by Fedors [Ill]. This model, 
however, does not allow prediction of the shape of the fracture envelope or the con-
version of data obtained under different modes of excitation (uniaxial, equal biaxial, 
or other multiaxialloading). 
An argument to resolve the discrepancy between the failure envelopes obtained 
for different modes of straining is indicated by the work of Blatz, Sharda, and 
Tschoegl [42]. These authors have proposed a generalized strain energy function 
as constitutive equation of multiaxial deformation. They incorporated more of the 
nonlinear behavior in the constitutive relation between the strain energy density and 
the strain. They were then able to describe simultaneously by four material con-
stants the stress-strain curves of natural rubber and of styrene-butadiene rubber in 
simple tension, simple compression or equibiaxial tension, pure shear, and simple 
shear. 
The continuous viscoelastic models discussed in this section make use of the 
theory of rubber elasticity and of the time-temperature superposition principle. 
They implicitly very well recognize the molecular origin of the viscoelastic behavior 
of a material - but explicitly they do not refer to noncontinuous quantities such 
as the discrete size, structure, and arrangement of molecules, the anisotropy of 
molecular properties, or the distribution of molecular stresses or stored strain energy. 
If individual molecular events or discontinuities of stress or strain are either not 
discernible or not of particular importance, a representation of a solid as a contin-
uum is quite adequate. 
IV. Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
A. Overview 
As opposed to the continuum mechanical theories, "molecular" rate process theo-
ries of fracture recognize the presence of discrete particles or elements forming 
the material body. Rate process theories intend to relate in a straightforward man-
ner breakage, displacement, and reformation of these elements to deformation, 
defect development, and fracture of the structured material. 
All theories to be described subsequently have in common the assumption that 
macroscopic failure is a rate process, that the basic fracture events are controlled by 
thermally activated breakages of secondary and/or primary bonds, and that the accu-
mulation of these events leads to crack formation and/or to breakdown of the loaded 
sample. The basic events referred to in this Section are dermed in a general manner 
and not experimentally related to particular morphological changes. The "morpho-
logical" theories based on the physical evidence of molecular damage obtained from 
spectroscopy and X-ray scattering methods will be discussed in Chapters 7 and 8. A 
third approach considers the role of cracks and craze initiation and is treated in 
Chapter 9. In the following some non-morphological fracture theories will be 
presented which concern respectively the calculation of the time to failure as a func-
64 

IV. Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
tion of flow or damage accumulation (Sections B-D), the determination of sample 
strength (E-F) and time to failure (G-J) as a function of molecular weight or con-
centration of primary bonds. 
One of the early applications of the theory given by Glasstone, Laidler, and 
Eyring [43] was the prediction of the flow and diffusion behavior of liquids. From 
the original concept of flow, the thermally activated jump of molecules across an 
energy barrier, various fracture theories of solids have emerged. Thus Tobolsky and 
Eyring [44] considered the general decrease of secondary bonds. A more general 
approach, the rule of cumulative damage [95-98], does not explicitely specify the nature 
of the damage incured during loading but tries to account for the influence of load 
history on sample strength. The importance of primary bonds for static strength had 
been deduced very early from the dependences of sample strength on molecular weight 
[99-103] and on volume concentration of primary bonds [70, 71]. Later Zhurkov 
[45-47] and Bueche [48-50] took up this idea and developed their kinetic theories 
based on the breakage of primary bonds. The Russian school has established and re-
viewed a considerable amount of experimental data on the effect of time and tem-
perature on the fracture behavior of polymers of different composition and structure 
and under various environments [51, 53,104]. 
Following the earlier works of Eyring, Zhurkov, and Bueche, these and other 
authors have continued to develop different aspects of the kinetic theory of frac-
ture. Particularly in the USSR fracture data have been interpreted in terms of the 
failure of regular, nonmorphological model lattices (e.g., 54-58). Gubanov et al. 
[54], Bartenev [55], and Perepelkin [56] focussed on the potential energy of inter-
action between adjacent members of a polymer chain, Mikitishin et al. [57] on the 
defects introduced into the lattice by chain ends, and Dobrodumov [58] on the 
increase of the load and - consequently - of the rate of scission of bonds adjacent 
to a broken bond. 
Hsiao and Kausch [59-61] studied the effect of orientation-<iependent local 
strain on the total rate of chain scission. HolzmUller [62], Bartenev et al. [63], and 
Salganik [64] analyzed the amount of thermal energy and the direction of relative 
motion imparted by statistically fluctuating phonons to adjacent segments. Dif-
ferent statistical aspects of the accumulation of molecular defects were treated by 
Orlovet al. [65], Goikhman [66], and Gotlib [67] who simulated the isolated pro-
duction, growth, interaction, and coalescence of defects. An energy probability 
theory was forwarded by Valanis [68] who combined the role of strain energy den-
sity, the stochastic nature of fracture, and the fracture hypothesis of Zhurkov. 
Whereas all of the above theories [54-68] refer in one way or another to the 
thermally activated breakage of one kind of molecular bonds as primary fracture 
event, the Bueche-Halpin theory for the tensile strength of gum elastomers [69] 
employs the idea that the viscoelastic straining of rubber fIlaments together with 
the degree of their ultimate elongation determine the kinetics of crack propagation 
in an elastomeric solid. 
In the following the characteristic aspects of these generalized, nonmorphological 
rate process fracture theories are to be discussed, Le. the nature of the basic fracture 
events, their distribution in space and time, the law of the accumulation of these 
events, and resulting fracture criteria. 
65 

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
B. Eyring's Theory of Flow 
Flow of a liquid, melt, or solid is the result of a stress-biased thermodynamically 
irreversible displacement of molecules past each other. A molecule in thermal 
equilibrium with its surroundings is in thermal motion, which in the case of a liquid 
or solid is predominantly a vibration around a temporary equilibrium position. The 
amplitude of vibration is constantly changing. Eyring [43] postulated that a displace-
ment ( or jump) of a molecule from an initial to a neighboring equilibrium position 
may occur if the thermal energy of the molecule is sufficient to reach the "activated" 
stage, i.e., the top of the energy barrier separating the initial and the final equilibrium 
positions. The rate of decay of activated states towards the final position was ob-
tained by him as 
kT 
ko = " h exp (-uo/kT) exp t:..s/k. 
(3.15) 
Here" is the transmission constant which indicates how many of the activated 
complexes actually disintegrate, k is Boltzmann's, h Planck's, and R the gas con-
stant, T is absolute temperature, Uo the height of the potential barrier, and t:..s the 
difference in entropy between ground state and activated state (the quantities u 
and s in small letters refer to one particle, the capital quantities to a mole of them). 
In the absence of external forces initial and final equilibrium states are assumed to 
hav~ the same potential energy. Then the rates of flow of particles across the divid-
ing potential barrier are the same in the forward and backward directions. Under 
the influence of external forces, however, local stress fields are generated. A particle 
thermally activated to move in the direction of, say, stress '11 by a distance A/2 then 
gains an amount of energy w: 
w = '11 A qf2 
(3.16) 
where q is the average cross section occupied by the particle normal to the direction 
of motion. A particle moving in the -'11 direction will loose the same amount of 
energy. The first particle, therefore, needs less thermal energy to reach the activated 
state than the second particle. Consequently the rates of flow of particles across an 
energy barrier in opposite directions are biased by the local stress: 
k} = ko exp (w/kT) 
k2 = ko exp (-w/kT). 
The net flow rate, therefore, is: 
K = k} - k2 = 2 ko sinh (w/kT). 
(3.17) 
(3.18) 
(3.19) 
It should be noted very carefully that w is equal to the product of local stress 
times an activation volume; this is the volume drawn up by particle cross section 
and step width in the process of activation. Activation volume and activation energy 
necessarily must refer to one and the same activation process. 
66 

IV. Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
C. Tobolsky-Eyring 
The concept of slipping of secondary bonds was applied by Tobolsky and Eyring 
in 1943 to the breaking of polymeric threads under - uniaxial - load [44]. The 
rate of decrease of the number N of such bonds per unit area under constant uniaxial 
stress '110 is obtained from Eqs. (3.1) and (3.19): 
-! dN = 2 ko sinh ('110>"/2 NkT). 
N dt 
(3.20) 
For large values of stress the flow of bonds takes place almost exclusively as 
breakage and not as reformation. In that case one may use Eq. (3.17) instead of 
(3.19). If one substitutes there '110>../2 NkT by y one obtains a solution in terms of 
the exponential integral-Ei(-y): 
.. 
-Ei(-y) = f dy'exp(-y')/y' =kotb' 
(3.21) 
YO 
The lower limit of integration isyo = '110>../2 NokT = w/kT. Equation (3.21) 
offers an implicit relation between the expectation value of the time to fracture of 
the thread, tb, the rate of flow of unstressed secondary bonds, ko, and the stress 
'110 acting on the No initial bonds. With w ~ kT the exponential integral may be 
approximated by: 
-Ei(-y) = [(exp - y)/y](1- l/y). 
(3.22) 
Within the range of validity of this approximation the logarithm of lifetime, 
log tb, is almost linearly related to w, i.e., to the applied stress. Exactly this behavior 
is exhibited by a large number of stressed metals, ceramics, or polymers. Together 
with Eyring's original interpretation this has laid the foundations of the kinetic theory 
of fracture, to which - as indicated above - subsequently a large number of research-
ers have contributed. 
D. Rule of Cumulative Damage 
The above concept of Tobolsky and Eyring can be considered as a specific form of 
the more general rule of cumulative damage. This rule stipulates that fracture of a 
specimen occurs if the time- and stress-dependent "damage" D(t) has accumulated 
to unity: 
D(t,a) = j dt'/tb(a[t']). 
o 
(3.23) 
This relation was originally formulated by Bailey [59] in order to compare the 
fracture behavior of plate glas subjected to different load histories (constant stress, 
constant rate of stressing, load cycles of different amplitude). An exactly analogous 
concept has been applied by Miner [96] to cyclic fatigue. He used the ratio of the 
67 

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
number of cycles nCo) spent at stress amplitude 0 to the endurance limit Nb(o) at 
that stress as integration variable in Eq. (3.23) (Miner's rule). 
It should be mentioned, however, that according to this hypothesis a certain 
load element o(t) L\t creates the same damage whether it occurs in the beginning or 
at the end of the specimen life. Thus, no stress concentration through crack growth 
or defect interaction is foreseen in this model. This, however, is contrary to experi-
ence. The apparent confirmations of the linear rule of cumulative defects (LRCD) 
concern practically always increasing stress histories (in fatigue or in tension, see 
[95-98]. Such a behavior is readily explained by the fact that "the damage" devel-
opes mainly in "the last moment". To give a quantitative example, McKenna and 
Penn [98] have measured the time to fracture, tb, ofPMMA under constant and

tb = to exp -ro/RT 
(3.24) 
with to = 7.78' 109 s 
and r/RT = 0.25 MPa- 1 at 297 K. 
The rate of damage formation, O(t), is then defined as:

For decreasing loads the LRCD underestimates the service life and leads to over-
design. For statistically varying loads notable derivations are also observed [97, 98]. 
The same is true for the smaller exponential arguments which are often obtained 
(see Chapter 8). 
E. Early Theories of the Molecular Weight Dependence of Strength 
The fact that the static strength of polymer samples depends on their molecular weight 
had been noticed rather early ([99-102], a comprehensive review of the literature up 
to 1946 has been given by Haward [103]). Working with polyvinylchloride-acetate 
copolymer fractions Douglas and Stoops [99] and with cullulose acetate fractions 
Sookne and Harris [100] found that sample strength Ub increased with number aver-
age molecular weight Mn according to 
(3.30) 
but independent ofMw/Mn. Spurlin [101] concluded from this independence that the 
chain ends may be the weak spots of the structure giving rise to slip of adjacent mole-
cules. 
Referring to the work of Bueche [105] some authors [106,107] recently proposed 
an apparently morphological entanglement network model (Fig. 3.8). In their calcu-
69 

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
lations it was assumed that the ideal strength of an isotropic entanglement network is 
given by the force nfb it takes to break those (n) chain segments which intersect a unit 
area oriented perpendicularly to the stress axis: 
(3.31) 
Fig. 3.8. Bueche's model of the strength of an ideal network of crosslinked chains 
• Whereas nand fb have been quite correctly estimated, it has completely been 
neglected that the chain segments in an isotropic polymer matrix have a statistically 
coiled conformation. Thus, before being loaded by a force of the order of fb a chain 
segment of molecular weight Me would have to be stretched by the natural draw 
ratio. This point had already been underlined by Flory in 1945 [102] and by Taylor 
and Darin [108] who indicated that only the (elastomer) chains oriented at less than 
a very small angle to the direction of stress at the instant of breaking can be highly 
elastically stressed. This is also true for thermoplastic polymers. This means that the 
physical network of entanglements must be heavily deformed before forces of the 
order of fb cim be supported. The energy of plastic deformation diSSipated in this 
process should (at least implicitely) enter Eq. (3.31). In order to predict reliably the 
ideal brittle strength of a polymer, it is therefore necessary to know the critical con-
ditions for the onset of large deformations, to identifY their limits (for instance in 
terms of the natural draw ratio Anat), and to ascertain the role of the entanglement 
network. This will be attempted in the final chapters. 
F. Effect of Volume Concentration of Primary Bonds 
At this point one would like to check further arguments that the existence (and vol-
ume concentration) of the strong primary bonds determines the rigidity and strength 
of (polymeric) solids. Holliday et al. [70] have looked under this aspect on the degree 
of connectivity CN (average number of main network bonds per chain atom, e.g., 2 in 
hydrocarbon chains, 3 in graphite, and 4 in diamond) and on the relative volume den-
sity of main bonds NCR (which here is density times number of network atoms in 
the repeat unit divided by molecular weight of a repeat unit). The term NCR varies 
70 

IV. Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
between less than 0.01 for bulky polymeric chains and 0.58 for diamond. The bulk 
moduli, Young's moduli, hardness values, and cubical coefficients of thermal expan-
sion of the more than 50 organic and inorganic polymers investigated at room tem-
perature exhibit a strong correlation with NCR. In Figure 3.9 the best fit curves 
drawn by Holliday for Young's modulus and Brinell hardness values BHN are repro-
duced (the actual NCR values - except for those of the graphitelike structures -
fall into a narrow band along the curves having a width of ± 0.05). The nearly iden-
tical shapes of the upper portions of both curves suggest that hardness (compressive 
yield strength) and elastic modulus depend in the same way on the concentration of 
primary bonds. In fact for the points on the curve with NCR> 0.08 (mostly organic 
thermosetting resins or inorganic polymers) the ratio of BNH value and E has a con-
stant value of 0.0625. 
For values of NCR < 0.08 (thermoplastic materials) the correlation between 
mechanical properties and bond density is much less pronounced although the steep 
slopes of the shown curves tend to make the scatter of the actual data points less 
apparent. The main reason for the lack of good correlation certainly is the fact that 
in high polymer solids the stiffness and strength can be utilized only to that extent 
permitted by intermolecular attraction and segment orientation (cf. Table 1.1 for 
the differences in elastic moduli of chains, highly oriented fibers, and isotropic 
solids; in section E below and in Chapter 5 the role of orientation and intermolecular 
attraction on chain strain is discussed in detail).

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
In order to investigate the effect of the density of main chain bonds on the 
mechanical properties it is necessary to select experimental conditions such that 
comparable mechanical excitation of said bonds does indeed take place. According 
to Vincent [71] commensurable reference temperatures to measure a critical tensile 
strength are the brittle point temperatures, where brittle failure changes to a ductile 
failure. As indicated in Figure 3.10 he has related the number of backbone bonds per 
unit area (Le., sample density times length of repeat unit over weight of repeat unit) 
to the critical tensile strength ()f (isotropic) polymers. A linear relationship exists 
between critical sample strength and bond packing density which does not seem to 
depend on the chemical nature of the bond. From the slope of the straight line the 
critical strength (in MN/m2) of the isotropic polymers is obtained as 36.8 times 
the number of backbone bonds per nm2. In highly oriented textile fibers this figure 
is much larger and amounts to between 100 and 250; in aromatic polyamide fibers 
(Kevlar 49) it reaches about 650. This should be compared with the theoretical 
value for fully oriented chains of infinite length which is about 3000, since the axial 
load to break a molecular chain of anyone of the species listed in Figure 3.9 is of 
the order of 3 nN. 
In other words, in isotropic thermoplastics at the point of brittle failure only 
a minute fraction - less than 1 % - of all main chain bonds is fully strained. Under 
these conditions, onset of unstable crack propagation is determined by the mag-
nitude of intermolecular attraction. Reinterpreting Vincent's data one must say that 
it is not the number of backbone bonds per unit area and their accumulated strength

which determine macroscopic strength but the level of intermolecular forces; the 
latter benefit from a closer packing (see also [112, 113] and Chapter 10). 
G. Zhurkov, Bueche 
Independently from each other Zhurkovet al. [45-47] in the USSR and Bueche 
[48-50] in the USA reactivated the idea that in fracture of polymers - and also of 
metals for that matter - the breakage of primary (chemical) bonds plays an im-
portant role. They found that the time to fracture under uniaxial stress ao of Zn, 
AI, and for example, PMMA and PS below their glass transition temperatures could 
be expressed by an exponential relationship involving three kinetic parameters: 
(3.32) 
The three parameters were - based on the available data - interpreted as energy 
for activation of bond scission (Uo), as the inverse of molecular oscillation frequen-
cy (to), and as a structure sensitive parameter 'Y. In Figure 3.11 experimental data and 
the theoretical curves according to Eq. (3.32) are reproduced. 
Equation (3.32) can be considered as a general expression of the kinetic nature 
of material disintegration. A closer discussion of the meaning of the molecular os-
cillation frequency, of the structure-sensitive parameter 'Y, and also of the acti vation

energy term is necessary in view of the molecular structure and of the sequence of 
molecular processes [87, 109, 110]. It should already be indicated, however, that the 
energy term Uo is not a priori identical with the thermal dissociation energy [87,109]. 
In the following section it will be discussed in more detail to what extent the 
orientation distribution of chain segments, the ensuing distribution of axial chain 
stresses, and the gradual accumulation of defects through successive breakage of 
chains can be held responsible for a discrepancy between actual and theoretical 
strength. 
73 

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
H. Hsiao-Kausch 
In the fracture theory of Hsiao-Kausch [60, 61) the state of orientation of a polymeric 
solid is explicitly recognized. The theory combines the kinetic concept of Zhurkov or 
Bueche and the theory of deformation of anisotropic solids developed by Hsiao [59] 
for a model made up of rodlike elastic elements. The fracture theory is based on the 
simplifying assumption that the mechanical properties of the anisotropic solid are 
predominantly determined by the state of orientation and the properties of the (one-
dimensional) elastic elements. The intermolecular interaction is neglected. In Chapter 2 
the mathematical model (Fig. 2.12) has been described and the constitutive stress-
strain relations (Eq. (2.5)) have been derived. The kinetic aspects are introduced into this 
model through the assumption that the rodlike elastic elements can undergo breakage, 
that the probability of failure of an element is determined by the axial stress acting 
upon that element, and that an immediate redistribution of the load carried up to 
then by the breaking element occurs. Again the model is characterized by the fact 
that it distinguishes between the macroscopic state of stress ( a) and the microscopic 
(axial) stress 'It of an element. The axial stress of a one-dimensional elastic element 
deformed in a homogeneous strain field €mn is determined by its axial elongation: 
(3.33) 
The summation convention for repeated indices is used. E is the modulus of 
elasticity of the elastic elements, and sm , Sn are components of the unit vector in 
the direction of orientation identified by {} and cp (SI = sin {} cos cp, S2 = sin {} sin cp, 
s3 = cos {}). For uniaxial stress, a33 = ao, and transverse symmetry about the 
33-axis Eq. (3.33) becomes: 
(3.34) 
where v is Poisson ratio € 11 I € 33' 
In a partially or nonoriented system, the microscopic axial stresses are larger 
than ao by a factor of up to E/Ex where Ex is the longitudinal modulus of elasticity 
of the subvolume containing the elastic element. If all subvolumes of a sample behave 
identically, then Ex is the longitudinal modulus of the (partially) oriented sample. 
Naturally the largest axial stresses are experienced by those elements oriented in 
the direction of uniaxial stress. In a completely oriented system E and Ex are equal 
by definition, and macroscopic and microscopic stress (in the direction of orienta-
tion) are equal also. 
As stated above it is then first assumed in accordance with Zhurkov's kinetic 
considerations that elements break and secondly thatthe orientation-dependent 
rate of breakage of elements is given by Eq. (3.17) as 
_ d f ({), t) = k ({}) = ko exp (13'1t/RT) 
fdt 
(3.35) 
where 13 is the activation volume for breakage of the elastic elements in question 
and f = N({}, t)/N({}, 0) the fraction of unbroken elements. 
74 

IV. Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
Thirdly it is assumed that after breakage of an element mechanical equilibrium 
is established within the affected sub volume and that strain e33 increases. This means 
that the elastic elements of all orientations take over an appropriate share of the 
load carried previously by the broken element to balance the load acting on the 
boundaries of the sub volume. It has been shown in Chapter 2 that the stress tensor 
acting on a small volume element of the elastic network can be calculated once the 
orientation distribution function, p, is known 
where dn is the infinitesimal solid angle. 
In uniaxial stressing, mechanical equilibrium within the elastic network is 
established if

(3.38) 
The system of Eqs.(3.35), (3.37), and (3.38) has been evaluated for a complete-
ly oriented and an unoriented network under constant uniaxial stress ao. The case 
of a completely oriented network is that treated by Tobolsky and Eyring. All ele-
ments are thought to be subjected to the same stress 'I' which increases inversely 
proportional to the decreasing number of unbroken elements. Breakdown of the 
sub volume occurs with breakage of the last element within the subvolume, i.e., 
after f has reached zero. The time to breakdown of the subvolume, tb, is taken from 
Eqs. (3.20), (3.21), and (3.35) as 
(3.39) 
where '1'0 is the initial stress carried by elements of orientation I? = O. 
In the case of random network orientation the system of Eqs. (3.35), (3.37), 
and (3.38) cannot be solved analytically. An approximation method has been pro-
posed, however [60]. Without repeating details of the method it may be said that 
the changes of f for a time interval A t as calculated from Eq. (3.35) are being fed 
back into Eqs. (3.3 7) and (3.38) giving the corresponding changes of ell (t) and 
e33(t), whlch in turn determine the changes of 'I'(t). The iterative integration of 
Eqs. (3.35), (3.37), and (J.38) can be carried out numerically. 
Two results of these calculations seem to be of interest with respect to the 
effect of network orientation on defect accumulation and strength: that the range 
of orientation angles within which elements break preferentially is narrow and that 
the increase in strength resulting from improved uniaxial orientation is limited. The 
first effect is illustrated in Figure 3.12 for a randomly oriented network where the 
initial distribution p = 1/2 7T, of elements is independent of I? Elements oriented 
in the direction of uniaxial stress (cos I? = 1) experience the largest initial stress 
('1'0)' and they break preferentially. The angular distribution of f (cos I?, TIME) is

shown for three different stages of defect development, namely after f (1, TIME) 
has dropped to 0.5 and zero, respectively, and for the point of impending network 
failure - where the numerical calculations had been terminated because breakage 
of the remaining elements occurred at too high a rate. For ease of comparison the 
time scale is given in terms of TIME where 
TIME = t/tz = kot exp(I3'1to/RT) 
(3.40) 
and tz the time to failure according to Zhurkov's Eq. (3.32). It should be noted 
that more than one-half of the loading period has to pass before one-half of the 
most heavily stressed elements is broken. More than 90% of the loading period has 
to elapse before all elements within a small angular section are broken. At this 
second stage the majority of all elements is still unbroken. The step from the second 
to the third stage of defect accumulation is rather short « 6% of loading time) and 
from there to network failure practically negligible. It should also be noted that 
TIME (failure) of a randomly oriented network composed of successively breaking 
interacting elements is only somewhat smaller than the time given by the empirical 
Eq. (3.32) where TIME (failure) for a stress 'Ito is unity; on the other hand it is 
larger than RT/I3'1t, the value predicted by the exponential integral (Eq. (3.22)) for 
a completely oriented network loaded to such an extent that again the elements 
experience the same initial stress 'Ito. 
The numerical calculations according to the above model resulted in an estimate 
of the time to failure of arbitrarily oriented networks under constant load: 
ko tb = -[Ei (-I3'1to/RT)]C 
(3.41 ) 
where C is a slowly varying correction term the limits of which are expressed by: 
1 ~ C ~ 1 + 0.63I3'1to/RT. 
76 
(3.42) 

IV. Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
The lower limit refers to completely oriented, the upper to randomly oriented 
networks. With C being determined it has become possible to compare Eqs. (3.32) 
and (3.41) and to express the structure sensitive kinetic parameter 'Y in terms of 
the element properties. In the range of validity of Eq. (3.22) one obtains for a fully 
oriented network:

The term in parentheses is an orientation-dependent and minor kinetic contri-
bution derived from the assumption of successive failure of many elements (in the 
technically relevant range of fJwo values from 40 to 200 kJ/mole the term in paren-
theses assumes values between 1.17 and 1.0). If the nature of the breaking elements 
is not changed during sample treatment or fracture development, then fJ can be con-
sidered to be constant. The major effect on 'Y is derived from the local stress con-
centration wo/uo which here is equal to the stiffness ratio E/El\. This theory essen-
tially predicts, therefore, that the increase in strength is equal to the increase in 
stiffness; it is based on the presumption that the elements break indeed at a critical 
local strain (kinetic version of st. Venant's criterion of maximum strain). A different 
interpretation of the strength of oriented samples which is based on the rotation of 
flaws has been presented in an earlier section of this chapter. 
In Figure 3.13 the experimental data obtained by Regel and Leksovskii [75] 
for the lifetimes of partially oriented PAN fibers are compared with theoretical 
curves derived from Eq. (3.41). It should be emphasized that the gain in strength

amounts to a factor of 'II 0 I Go = 5. Similar values of between 2 and 5 for the increase 
in strength with orientation have been reported for PE, PP, PS, PVC, PMMA, or PA 
[51, 54). It should be pointed out that the rather limited increase in stiffness in 
77 

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
these experiments indicates that the orienting "elements" are not simply highly ex-
tended chain segments but larger molecular domains of limited anisotropy. This 
does not preclude the possibility that breakage of an element is essentially identical 
to breakage of the most highly stressed chain molecule(s). This will be the case if 
the breaking chain(s) carry practically the total load of an element or initiate its 
breakage. 
A comparison of different reaction rate models was made by Henderson et al. 
[76] who found that the bond rupture theories (Tobolsky-Eyring, Zhurkov-Bueche) 
gave better agreement with fracture data on filled poly butadiene and filled and un-
filled PVC than the bond slippage hypothesis. Primary uncertainties exist, however, 
with respect to a repair reaction and to the temperature dependence of (j and 'Y. The 
question of the true meaning of the activation volumes (j and 'Y, of the stress ratio 
'lJ!o/uo, and of the role of chain stretching and chain scission in macroscopic frac-
ture will be resumed in Chapters 7 to 9. 
J. Gotlib, Dobrodumov et al. 
In none of the previously treated molecular fracture theories (B - H) allowance has 
been made for possible stress concentration in the neighborhood of a breaking 
element. The first ruptures in a large ensemble of initially equally stressed molecules 
certainly will occur at random within the stressed volume. The breakage and retrac-
tion of a particular element must lead, however, preferentially to an increase in 
axial stresses of those elements to which it is coupled (through secondary forces). 
The probability density for rupture of those elements will, therefore, be slightly 
higher than that for others. But the higher probability density applies only to the 
small number of elements in the vicinity of the existing fracture points. So the (in-
tegrated) probability for rupture of one of these elements is initially smaller than 
the probability for rupture of one of the large number of chains hitherto not af-
fected by a ruptured element. The rupture events, therefore, will continue for some 
time to occur at random [67]. With their growing number, chances are increasing 
that rupture events occur in an immediate vicinity of each other thereby forming 
the nucleus of a crack and enhancing the fracture probability of neighboring 
elements. 
Whenever the random accumulation of defects in one site has grown to such 
a size that subsequent fractures will preferentially occur at that site, one has reached 
the end of the phase of fracture initiation and the beginning of (thermal) crack 
growth 
In Figure 3.14 a computer simulation by Dobrodumov et al. of the fracture 
development within a regular model lattice is shown [58]. The authors have taken 
the ratio of the elastic constants in and perpendicular to the direction of orientation 
as 10: 1 and an element fracture probability as given by Eq. (3.32). The distribution 
of local stresses was determined by a numerical iteration procedure. It is readily ob-
served that for small loads ((j'lJ!o/RT = 5) a large number of isolated defects appear 
before (from the accidental accumulation of a few defect pOints) a "crack" starts 
growing. At higher loads ((j'lJ!o/RT = 20) a smaller number of defect points initiate

a crack and very little damage is done to the remainder of the plane during fracture 
initiation. These results are qualitatively similar to those of Hsiao and Kausch shown 
in Figure 3.l2 From these studies the authors [57, 67] conclude that in polymers 
only weak stress concentration on a molecular scale can exist (axial stresses adjacent 
to a site comprisingj defects should be larger by a factor ofWthan the stress further 
away). It should be noted that this model - as the previous one - strictly operates 
with elastic elements and with their rupture as the only way to relieve local stress. 
The application of these models, therefore, seems to be restricted to the brittle frac-
ture of organic glasses or to other systems not involving large anelastic or plastic 
deformation in fracture initiation. 
K. Bueche-Halpin 
The limited viscoelastic extensibility of rubber strands determines according to the 
theory of Bueche and Halpin [69] the fracture of elastomers. The authors assume

that a large number of filaments at the tip of a growing crack have to be strained 
successively to their critical elongation Ac. The sample will fracture at a gross strain 
Ab after q filaments have been broken in a time tb = qt'. The values Ab and Ac are 
connected through the creep function of the material and the stress concentration 
factor. The theory allows one to calculate the elongation at break, Ab, from the 
knowledge of the creep function. It does not take into consideration any change 
of stress concentration with growing crack length or the decrease of t', the time 
necessary to fracture one filament, with continuing creep of the sample. It is as-
sumed that all filaments will have to be stretched from practically zero elongation 
to Ac. That will, in the first place, affect any numerical values of q which may be 
calculated from fitting experimental failure envelopes. A group of q filaments 
subject to the statistical condition that fracture of one filament may start once 
the fracture of the preceding one is completed has an average lifetime, < tb >, of 
qt' and a Poisson distribution of tb: 
(3.45) 
The same concept of filament deformation was independently employed by 
Bartenev et al. [77] to the opening and growth of crazes (silver cracks) in PMMA. 
The molecular theories treated in this chapter have considered the thermally 
activated breakage of elements or filaments as a source of crack initiation and 
macroscopic failure. It is the purpose of the following chapters to investigate the 
mechanical strength of primary bonds and of molecular chains and to study the 
occurrence of chain breakages. With that information available it will be possible 
to resume the discussion on the nature of the "elements" used in molecular theories 
of fracture.

In the last chapter, in the section on molecular theories of fracture, almost through-
out an Arrhenius equation has been used to describe the activation of element break-
age. The energy of activation, Uo, frequently turned out to be equal to (or was 
assumed to be equal to) the dissociation energy of the weakest main chain bond. 
Before further analyzing the kinetics of element - and possibly chain - breakage 
a definition of the mechanical strength of a bond and of a chain have to be given. 
In order to do this basic results of quantum chemistry [1, 2] are recalled in this 
chapter which concern the "strengths" of intramolecular bonds and factors in-
fluencing the binding potential such as electronic excitation or ionization. 
A. Atomic Orbitals 
Covalent chemical bonds between atoms of the same or a different species rely on 
the interaction of the outermost - or valence - electrons. Even though one speaks 
of electrons one should rather think of electron clouds, Le. of electronic density 
distributions. The radial and angular distribution of the electron density is described 
by "one electron" wave functions '11 - also called atomic orbitals - which are 
derived as a solution of the quantum mechanical Schr6dingerequation: 
85 

4. Strength of Primary Bonds 
( - ~ 
V 2 + V) '11 = E'I1. 
81T mr 
(4.1) 
Here h is Planck's constant, mr the reduced mass of an electron with charge e, 
V the Nabla operator, and E the energy eigenvalue of an electron moving within a 
potential V. The term in brackets constitutes the Hamiltonian operator H. 
The Schrodinger equation has a solution only for certain discrete energy values 
E. Different values of E mean different forms of the electronic density distributions 
which are characterized by the principal quantum number n, the angular quantum 
number Q and the magnetic quantum number m. 
For the simplest atomic system, the hydrogen atom, whieh consists of one pro-
ton and one electron the potential V is _e2 /r. In this case energy levels are obtained, 
which are degenerate, i.e. the energy levels for different I and m coincide. The cor-
responding wave functions, however, do depend on the three quantum numbers n, I 
and m. It should be noted that the radial distribution, R(r), and the angular distribu-
tion S(8, cp) may be separated: 
(4.2) 
The quantum numbers are subject to the condition that 
Q = 0, 1, 2 ... n-l 
m=0,±I,±2 .. . ±Q. 
It is customary to denote the atomic orbitals by the spectroscopical terms s, 
p, d ... if Q is 0, 1, 2 ... respectively. 
The fIrst few wave functions for a hydrogen-like atom with a charge of + Ze of 
the nucleus then have the following form: 
Is RlO(r) = (Z/ao)3/2 2 exp (-Zr/ao) 
2s R20(r) = (Z/ao)3/2 (2 - Zr/ao) (exp - Zr/2ao) (1/2 Vf> 
2p R21 (r) = (Z/ao)3/2 (Zr/2ao V6) exp (-Zr/2ao) 
and 
s 
Soo (8, cp) = 1/2.;ir 
px 
Six (8, cp) = (0/2 .;ir) cos cp sin 8 
py 
Sty (8, cp) = (../3/2.;ir) sin cp sin 8 
pz 
SIz (8,cp) =(0/2 Vir) cos8. 
(4.3) 
(4.4) 
(4.5) 
(4.6) 
(4.7a) 
(4.7b) 
(4.7c) 
Here ao is the radius of the fIrst Bohr orbit in hydrogen (0.529 . 10-10 m). 
According to the Pauli exclusion principle every atomic orbital may be occupied 
by one or two electrons which in the latter case have to have their spins aligned 
antiparallel to each other (paired electron spins). 
For many-electron atoms an exact analytical solution of the Schrodinger 
equation (Eq. 4.1) is not possible. Nevertheless atomic orbitals may be obtained 
86 

I. Covalent Bonds 
by an iterative procedure, which starts by placing the appropriate number of elec-
trons on hydrogen-like one-electron orbitals. With the potential obtained from such 
a charge distribution a better approximation of the first orbital can be calculated 
which in turn is considered in the recalculation of the second orbital and so on until 
no further corrections become necessary. Again these orbitals are denoted by 1 s, 
2s, 2p, 3d if the quantum numbers nand Q are 1 and 0, 2 and 0, 2 and 1, 3 and 2 
and so on. 
In a many-electron atom - as for instance Li - one finds a particular electron 
in any of the accessible orbitals (1 s, 2s) and in any of the two possible states of 
spin (ms = + 1/2 or -1/2). Since electrons are indistinguishable the energy of the 
atom must not be affected by interchanging the coordinates of any pair of elec-
trons. The wave function belonging to one eigenvalue E will have to encompass, 
therefore, all terms resulting from an interchange of electron numbering. 
In the case of Li the ground state has the wave function: 
ISQ(l) ls~(l) 2sQ(l) 
'1'= 
(Slater's determinant) 
(4.8a) 
2s Q (3) 
or 
'I' = Is Q (1) ls~ (2) 2s Q (3) - Is Q (2) Is~ (1) 2s a (3) + ... 
(4.8b) 
Each of the six terms of the fully written determinant (4 .8b) contains an orbital 
and a spin function for each of the three electrons. The spin function Q (1) may 
denote that the electron 1 has a spin quantum number ms = + 1/2, ~ (1) corresponds 
to m = -1/2. 
B. Hybridization 
It can easily be shown that an atom with one electron in each of the 2s-, 2px-, 
2py-, and 2pz-orbitals has a total charge density distribution which is completely 
spherical, i.e. independent of e and cp. The s- and p-atomic orbitals are not the only 
functions that lead to a spherical distribution of the total charge. A large number 
of suitable linear combinations of the s- and p-orbitals do have the same property. 
These linear combinations are called hybrid orbitals or hybrids. Depending on the 
number and kind of atomic orbitals used in hybridization the hybrids are denoted 
as sp, Sp2, Sp3 , dsp3 etc. The four normalized and orthogonal Sp3 -hybrids (of a 
C-atom) have the form: 
(4.9a) 
(4.9b) 
(4.9c) 
87 

4. Strength of Primary Bonds 
(4.9d) 
The individual hybrid is, of course, non-spherical, i.e. the electron density dis-
tribution has a characteristic shape. In this particular case the directions of maximum 
electron density point into the corners of a regular tetrahedron. 
The electronic energy of a C-atom with electrons in hybrid orbitals is higher 
than that of the ground state. In carbon the ground state will be formed by two elec-
trons in each of the lowest orbitals: 1 S2 2s2 2p2. Hybridization involves the change 
from pyramidal orbitals (p3) to tetragonal ones (sp3); it requires, that three p-or-
bitals be occupied. The first step is, therefore, that one electron be promoted from 
2s to 2p which necessitates an energy of promotion. The effect of promotion and 
hybridization is, however, that four rather than two electrons are available for bond-
ing. The gain in binding energy of the two additional C-H bonds (90 to 100 kcal/mol 
per C-H bond) more than balances the energy expended for promotion and hybrid-
ization. 
c. Molecular Orbitals 
Within the limited scope of this book a mere terminology of molecular orbital theory 
can be supplied - intended only for the discussion of bond energies. Rigorous quan-
tum mechanical calculations for any molecule being more complex than the hydrogen 
molecule are not feasible. Therefore, approximate methods for calculation of the 
orbitals of the bonding electrons have been developed [1,2]. The two most impor-
tant ones are the molecular orbital (MO) method relating to the work of Hund, Mulli-
ken, and Hiickel [la] and the bond orbital method, the Heitler-Landon-Slater-
Pauling (HSLP) method [1 b]. In the MO approach electrons are placed in one-
electron-wave functions which belong to the molecule as a whole with each nucleus 
in its proper configuration. In its crudest form these wave functions are obtained as 
a linear combination of the atomic orbitals (LCAO) of all atoms forming the molecule 
[2a]. 
In bond orbital theory the wave functions of the molecule are derived from the 
wave functions associated with the different bonds of a molecule, i.e. from the bond 
orbitals. In the LCBO model the molecular orbitals are a linear combination of bond 
orbitals which in turn are a combination of the atomic orbitals or hybrids forming 
the bond in question [2b]. In the HLSP-method the many-electron wave functions 
are a sum of product functions which contain a Heitler and London type of factor 
(space function and spin function) for each bond of the molecule. 
Bond orbital and molecular orbital approach lead to the common conclusion 
that bonding will occur only at directions where the atomic orbitals have large values 
and only if the atoms are close enough to each other so that the atomic orbitals 
overlap, i.e. if the "electron clouds" partly penetrate each other. 
A covalent bond is associated with an electron pair and hence subject to the 
quantum mechanical phenomenon of electron exchange: in a molecule A-B the 
electron from A may also be found near the nucleus of atom B and vice versa. It is 
88 

II. Bond Energies 
this additional exchange energy term which significantly deepens the interatomic 
potential and leads to a distinct potential minimum - prerequisite for a stable 
binding. Thus a bond can be formed if a bonding molecular orbital exists and if 
it is occupied by an electron or an electron pair. In the ground energy state of a 
molecule paired electrons occupy the molecular orbitals with the lowest energy. 
D. Multiple Bonds 
So far multiple bonds between atoms of the same or a different species such as carbon, 
nitrogen, and oxygen have not been explicitly discussed). At this point attention 
should be drawn to the fact that the two (or three) molecular orbitals involved in 
forming a double ( or triple) bond are usually not of the same kind· but of different 
character. In ethylene (H2 C =CH2) all six atoms lie in one plane. Therefore, one 
may take three Sp2 -hybrid orbitals of each C-atom to form the four C-H bonds 
and the one axially symmetric C-C bond, the a bond. 
The two remaining pz orbitals are combined into the so called (molecular) 1T 
bond orbital. Since the pz orbitals are directed perpendicular to the 1T bond which 
they are forming their overlap is smaller than that of orbitals forming a a bond. 
Also the regions of maximum overlap are not in the xy plane between the C-atoms 
but rather above and below this plane. Because of this orientation of the pz orbitals 
the interaction between conjugated 1T bonds is so strong that in fact it leads to a 
delocalization of the 1T electrons. In view of the geometry of the 1T bond it is easily 
realized that rotation of a group around multiple bonds is forbidden [Ie]. 
II. Bond Energies 
A. Electronic Energy and Heat of Formation 
The term bond energy requires a definition. The potential energy-scheme of an ar-
bitrary bond A-B in a polyatomic molecule given in Figure 4.1 serves to illustrate 
this point. As pOinted out previously one has to take into account that in poly-
electronic atoms the valency state of the atom may lie above the respective ground 
state. If this is the case no binding can occur between two atoms in their ground 
states; if they encounter each other their potential energy will rise. At some inter-
atomic distance the potential energy of the system will approach the energy of the 
atoms in their valency states (Fig. 4.1, dashed line) and a transition to the binding 
state can occur. The intrinsic binding energy (wahre Bindungsenergie) E is, therefore, 
the difference between the energy of the molecular ground state and that of the 
valency states at infinite interatomic distance. The energy of dissociation D is smaller 
than E, namely by the zero point energy (Nullpunktsenergie) h 11/2 of vibration 
and by the sum P of energies of promotion, hybridization, and polar and steric 
rearrangements necessary to attain the valency state. The difference between zero 
point energy and the maximum of the potential energy curve is the activation

energy Vo of bond dissociation. In diatomic molecules Vo and D generally have the 
same value and represent the bond energy. 
In molecules with three or more atoms the assignment of a specific increment 
of energy- to a particular bond is complicated by the presence of the above mentioned 
energy term P for promotion and electron reorganization, by the occurrence of delo· 
calized electrons, and by the fact that the dissociation energies of successively broken, 
initially identical bonds are different. The latter statement may be illustrated by the 
disintegration of CH4 using the energy values given by Stuart [S]. It must be assumed 
that the four hydrogen atoms in CH4 are equivalent, all C-H bonds are formed by 
hydrogen 1 s orbitals and carbon 2 Sp3 orbitals. Abstraction of the first hydrogen atom 
requires an energy of 42S.8 kJ/mol (101.7 kcal/mol) and changes the methane atom 
into the methyl radical CH3 . From symmetry considerations confirmed by ESR in-
vestigations it has been concluded [4] that the methyl radical is planar, with the un-
paired electron undoubtedly in a 2 p orbital of the C"atom. The bond character of the 
C-H bonds remaining in what now is the methyl radical has changed, therefore, from 
the tetrahedral configuration of Sp3 hybrid orbitals into the planar one of Sp2 hybrids. 
The dissociation energy of one of these C-H bonds is 477.3 kJ/mol (114 kcal/mol). 
The third hydrogen has a dissociation energy of 418.7 (100 kcal/mol), the fourth of 
341.2 kJ Imol (81.5 kcal/mol). It should be mentioned at this point that the litera-
ture data on the energies of the different C-H bonds vary slightly (cf. for instance 
[IS-17]), they do agree, however, on the total energy gained in forming CH4 from 
its constituent atoms, i.e. 1663 kJ/mol (397.2 kcal/rriol), the average C-H bond energy 
is, therefore, 41S.7 kJ/mol (99.3 kcal/mol) [S].1t is this average from the energy of 
formation of the molecule which is sometimes simply termed bond energy (mittlere 
Bindungsenergie) . 
The bond energies of saturated and unsaturated homologues of hydrocarbons 
may be treated in some detail since they will give us some understanding of the cor-
relation of bond energies in polyolefins. In saturated hydrocarbons with localized 
electrons it is reasonable to equate the energy of a bond with the energy of the 
90

electrons forming that particular bond. Theoretically the electronic energy of a 
molecule may be calculated using any of the mentioned approximations, for in-
stance the LCBO method [2b, 6]. In that case the molecular orbitals for the 2N a-
electrons of a hydrocarbon with N bonds may be written as a linear combination of 
N bond orbitals <Pi:

Following the treatment of Brown [6] it is assumed that the Coulomb integral, 
Hmm , of an orbital <Pm depends only on the type of bond in which it resides, thus 
all C-H bond orbitals will be assigned the same value a of the Coulomb integral. 
The term is one half of the binding energy of an isolated C-H bond. The resonance 
integral, Hmn , will be assumed to be zero unless m and n denote adjacent bonds. In 
that case Hmn still depends on the type of neighboring bonds. In Table 4.1 the as-
signments of Brown for the bond interaction parameters in saturated hydrocarbons 
are listed.

In Table 4.2 and 4.3 the electronic energies of a few hydrocarbons and of their 
radicals are given in terms of Brown's parameters. It will be noted that to a zeroth 
approximation (S = 0) the total electronic energy E of a molecule or a radical is given 
by the sum of the energie& of the corresponding number of isolated C-C and C-H-
bonds. In the first approximation also the energetic interactions of neighboring 
bonds are considered (terms to the first power of S as listed in Tables 4.2 and 4.3) 
and higher powers of S are neglected. Such terms would be necessary, however, 
to account for the effect of third neighbors within the molecule. That effect is 
clearly revealed by analysis of thermochemical data [7]. 
If it were possible to determine the numerical values of the bond interaction 
parameters by simply using molecular geometry and atomic constants one would 
have a direct and independent way to calculate bond energies. So far, however, it 
has proven very cumbersome to derive the explicit values of the bond energy para-
meters a, h, 'Y, 8 2 , T/2 , and S directly and sufficiently correctly from molecular 
wave functions. Usually thermochemical data are employed to obtain the electronic 
energy of a molecule. For example the electronic energy E of a hydrocarbon can be

calculated from the enth31pies Ha of atomization of hydrogen, L of sublimation 
of graphite, and LlHf of formation of the hydrocarbon from H2 and Cn : 
E(CnH2n+2) = - n L(C) - (n + l)Ha + LlHf - W. 
(4.16) 
The term W accounts for the fact that the minimum of a binding potential is by 
the zero point vibrational energy (1/2 hv) lower than the corresponding dissociation 
energy (Fig. 4.1). Since the relevant fre<plencies are of the order of 2.5 . 1013 s-l 
(C-C skeleton) and 9 . 1013 S-l (C-H) the zero point vibrational energies range 
between 5 kJ/mol and 18 kJ/mol. 
A quantitative analysis of the quantum mechanical calculations through ther-
mochemical data will be attempted, although considerable uncertainties exist. These 
are caused by the limitations of the used first order approximation, the lack of con-
sideration of steric interaction of atoms, and of the difficulties to determine W. The 
analysis is firstly based on the fact that the differences between the electronic 
energies of the listed hydrocarbons and their radicals can be expressed by only four 
quantities Fj : 
Fl = -2a + 1282 Sr 
F2 = 4(1-82) Sr 
F3 = -4(1 - 282 + 112) Sr 
F4 = -2a - 2 hr + 24112 Sr. 
(4.17) 
(4.18) 
(4.19) 
(4.20) 
Brown [6] determined F2 to be 15.5 kJ/mol (from the radical dissociation 
energies listed in Table 4.3) and F 3 to be -6.7 kJ Imol (from the energy differences 
found for 5 pairs of isomers listed in Table 4.3). 
Since these difference values are not so much affected by the systematic un-
certainties mentioned above they will be adopted here along with the value of 
300 kJ Imol for F 4; F 4 is the electronic energy of a C-C bond interacting solely 
with C-C bonds as in (CH3hC-C(CH3h. Further the standard values (at 
298.15 K and 1 bar) L = 717.2 kJ/mol and Ha = 436.2 kJ/mol [7] and a Ll Hf (CH4) = 
= -75 kJ/mol have been used [6]. The zero point vibrational energy of the 9 vibra-
tional modes of the -C-H and H-C-H bonds of methane is estimated at 100 kJ/mol. 
The total electronic energy of methane then is derived from Eq. (4.16) as E (CH4) 
= -1765 kJ/mol. From Eqs. (4.17) and (4.18) it follows that 6.2 < Sr < 8.4 kJ/mol. 
Employing E (CH4), F 2, F 3, and F 4 as given above and a value of 
Sr = 
6.5 kJ Imol 
a = -200 kJ/mol 
hI' = 
55 kJ/mol

one obtains 
On the basis of these values the electronic energies of the hydrocarbons have 
been determined and listed as Etheor in Table 4.2. For comparison the thermo-
chemically determined enthalpies of formation are referenced as Eexp + W. The 
latter values are consistently larger than Etheor although the difference decreases 
rather than to increase with the number of vibrational modes available to a molecule.

4. Strength of Primary Bonds 
The treatment may be extended to deal with the energy of alkyl radicals if one 
assumes that the single unpaired electron on the "radicalized" carbon atom occupies 
of 2 p1T molecular orbital and does not change the interaction of other electrons on 
other orbitals. As mentioned earlier this assumption is in accord with ESR-investi-
gations [4]. In electronic terms the dissociation energy D of a bond Rl - R2 can 
then be formulated as 
(4.21) 
In Table 4.3 the electronic energy of hydrocarbon radicals and R-H dissociation 
energies are listed together with thermo chemically determined values. The difference 
values of electronic and thermochemical data are in correspondence with each other. 
The absolute value of F 1 = D(R-H) + 1/2 hv(R-H) can be calculated from Eq. 
(4.17) to be 431 kJ/mol; since D(R-H) for tertiary carbon atoms is 381 kJ/mol a 
contribution of 50 kJ/mol must be assigned to the zero point vibrations. This con-
tribution is certainly too high by ~30 kJ/mol. The discrepancies between cal-
culated and measured dissociation energies of C-C bonds, however, lie between 0 
and 6 kJ/mol for the bonds covered by Tables 4.2 and 4.3. The experimentally 
determined dissociation energies of small molecular groups are listed in the upper 
and left hand side of Table 4.4 [after van Krevelen, 9]. For these molecular frag-
ments the activation energy of bond rupture and the dissociation energy are assumed 
to correspond. In the lower right hand side we have listed the dissociation energies 
obtained for sp2 and sp3 bonds by Stepan'yan et al. [10]. In their semi-empirical 
approach the authors calculate the bond dissociation energies RI-R2 byextrapo-
lation from those of the series of compounds R-X, X representing F, H, Cl, Br, 
and I. Additional data on the energy of chemical bonds especially, concerning halogen-
and nitrogen-containing groups are given in [16]. Judging the available experimental 
and theoretical determinations of bond energies of chain molecules it must be stated 
that still considerable differences with respect to the depth of the binding potentials 
for main chain bonds exist. 
Before leaving the subject of bond energies one should briefly discuss the mean-
ing of the term bond strength. In quantum chemistry the term bond strength, or 
more explicitly the bonding strength of atomic orbitals, refers to the excentricity 
of a (hybrid or nonhybrid atomic) orbital and is measured by the maximum 
angular intensity of the wave function as compared with the spherically symmetrical 
s-orbital [1]. So the strength of an sp3 hybrid is WI (8 = 54° 44'; cp = 45°)1 ( 411T ) 1/2 = 2. 
Other hybrids of interest have the following bond strengths: the (pyramidal) p3 
. 
hybrid 1. 732, the (plane triangular) Sp2 hybrid 1.991, and the (linear) sp hybrid 
1.932. 
Throughout our further discussions, however, the term bond strength will have a 
more technical meaning, i.e. that of the force required to break the bond (cf. Chap-
ter 5). 
B. Binding Energy of Excited States and Radicalized Chains 
In as much as the covalent binding force between any two atoms rests on the electron 
density distribution between (and around) these atoms any change of the electron 
96 

II. Bond Energies 
distribution necessarily affects the bond strength. Since the states of different elec-
tronic energy of a molecule are states of different electron distribution they are also 
states of different interatornal forces. 
This is also true, of course, for molecular ions, i.e. for molecules where one or 
more electrons have been removed completely. As already seen for methane the 
character of a bond and its energy are also affected through the radicalization of the 
atom group to which it belongs. 
1. Electronic Excitation 
The electronic excitation of a polymeric network chain can be caused by elec-
tromagnetic (light, UV, 'Y) or particle irradiation. The transfer of energy from the 
impinging particle or quantum of radiation to the electron requires that sufficient 
energy is available to reach an excited state and that an interaction mechanism exists. 
In the case of visible light a photon of, say, a wavelength of 330 nm has enough 
energy to break a C-C bond. However, the photon will not be absorbed by alkanes 
and there are no electronic states of that or a smaller energy which could be ex-
cited. To be effective a photon has to be absorbed and to interact with a binding 
electron. This interaction occurs either directly or indirectly through the mechanisms 
of energy transfer by exciton diffusion, single step transfer or absorption of fluores-
cence light emitted by the same or another (impurity) molecule [11]. The nature 
and sequence of these important processes which determine the photochemical 
stability - or instability - of polymers will not be treated here in detail. One is 
interested, however, to know the levels of energy where the excitation of electrons 
- or the ionization of molecules - begins and to know the changes of binding energy 
caused by excitation - or ionization - respectively.

4. Strength of Primary Bonds 
The potential curves of different excited states of the C2 -molecule illustrate the 
effect of electronic excitation on bond energies (Fig. 4.2). We would like to point 
out that the dissociation energies of the different molecular states shown range from 
350 to 119 kJ/mol (84 to 28 kcal/mol). These dissociation energies are generally 
smaller than the energy differences caused by the electronic excitation. The excited 
states of the (many-electron) C-atoms are denoted in the usual manner as S, P, D. 
Since two excited atoms may combine in a number of ways there are more than one 
molecular state corresponding to any two atomic states. 
Transitions from the ground state of a molecule to an excited state usually occur 
from a bonding orbital (a or 1T electron) or a non-binding orbital (n electron) to an 
antibonding a* or 1T* orbital. In Table 4.5 are listed the electronic transitions for 
some common high polymers as given by [13]. If an electronic excitation of a net-
work chain occurs, it leads to decreased bond energies. This will reduce the mechanical 
stability of a loaded polymeric network and thus contribute to chain scission, frac-
ture initiation or facilitated crack propagation. It is readily seen from Table 4.5,

however, that the energy values of the lowest lying excited states are larger than 
that of any C-C bond. One does not expect, therefore, that the recombination of 
any chain radicals will lead to energy quanta which are large enough to cause elec-
tronic excitation of the reacting radicals or of neighboring molecules. (This is different, 
though, if additional reactions with oxygen are involved; this aspect, the chemilumi-
nescence, will be treated in Chapter 8). 
2. Ionization 
The complete removal of an electron from a molecule, i.e. the ionization, requires 
more energy than electron excitation and has an even stronger effect on the dissocia-
tion energy. In Table 4.6 the dissociation and ionization potentials of the first few 
hydrocarbons have been collected from various sources. It is assumed that ioniza-
tion is first accomplished through removal of the least bound electron from the 
highest occupied orbital and also that this orbital embraces the whole molecule.

4. Strength of Primary Bonds 
The dissociation energies D(RI - Ri) in the last column of Table 4.6 can be cal-
culated from the ionization energies according to the relation 
(4.22) 
The values derived in that (indirect) way are given in parenthesis because of the 
ambiguities that are still involved in obtaining the ionization potentials from elec-
tron impact or photo ionization efficiency measurements. For the molecules listed 
here it is clearly apparent that the dissociation energies of the positive molecular 
ions are much smaller than those of the non-ionized molecule. (It should be noted 
that the dissociation energies of excited states are not necessarily always s11Ulller 
than those of the corresponding ground states. But in the organic compounds here of 
interest dissociation energies are reduced by electron removal.) 
It has been emphasized here that the ionization should lead to a positive molec-
ular or radical ion because the electronic energy of negative ions may be quite dif-
ferent. These differences are not expected and not explained in molecular orbital 
theory. If no electron repulsion term is explicitely introduced then the same amount 
of energy will be predicted for the removal of an electron and for placing an electron 
onto such an orbital. These differences can be quite considerable. For H2 the state 
H+ + H- lies above the state H + H by an amount of 12.8 eV (l230 kJjmol). The 
energy difference between Rt + R2" and RI + R2 is given by I(R1) -E' (R2) where 
E' (R2) is the electron affinity of R2 (i.e. the energy which is released when the 
atom or radical R2 combines with an electron to form a negative ion). As is illustrated 
by Table 4.7 the electron affinities of saturated hydrocarbons are of the order of 
1 eV (96 kJjmol) or less, the differences between I(R) and E(R) are of the order 
of 7 eV (672 kJjmol) or more. The dissociation of a hydi-ocarbon molecule R1- R2 
into the two radicalions Ri and Ri generally requires an amount of 672 kJjmol 
or more in addition to the energy required for homolytic scission into the radicals 
RI and R2. Homolytic chain scission, therefore, is a much more probable mode of 
molecular disintegration (of saturated hydrocarbons) than ionic dissociation. 
3. Radicalization 
The removal of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon leads to the formation of a 
radical. Its electron distribution differs from the original one near the radical

II. Bond Energies 
C atom. In saturated hydrocarbons the 4 Sp3 hybrid orbitals change to 3 Sp2 hy-
brids. The radical free electron is considered to be located in a completely separated 
'IT eigenfunction which has no interaction with the a-system. The strength of a bond 
connecting a C atom with the radicalized C atom, C, is now mainly determined by the 
interaction of an Sp2 with an Sp3 hybrid. The energy of a bond formed by an over-
lap of an Sp3 hybrid and an Sp2 hybrid is not smaller than that formed by two sp3 
hybrids. This is concluded from the dissociation energies of the C-C bonds in 
RCH2-CH2R (337 kJ/mol) and RCH2-C6 Hs (381 kJ/mol). The assumption that 
replacing Sp3 orbitals by Sp2 orbitals in bonds will not reduce the bond energy per 
se is further supported by the observation that the bond energy of the C(sp2)-H 
bond in H2C=CH2 is the same as the value of the C(sp3)-H bond in H3C-CH3 
(436 kJ/mol). The increased energy of dissociation of the C(sp2)-H bond in the 
methyl radical (477 kJ/mol) leads to a similar conclusion. 
The C-C bonds in Q position to the carbon carrying a free electron are, there-
fore, slightly stronger than the same bonds in the original molecule. The C-C bonds 
in P position, however, are adversely affected by the described electronic reorgani-
zation. In thermal or mechanical degradation they are found to break preferentially. 
Reactions involving the scission of a radicalized carbon backbone chain lead to the 
formation of a double bond: 
R1-CHX-CH2-CX-CH2-R2 ~ R1-CHX + CH2=CX-CH2-R2·

a reaction correspondingly. Thus one obtains for the reaction n-C3H7 -+ C2H4 + CH3 
an activation energy of 106.8 kJ/mol and for the reaction n-C4H9 -+ C2HS + C2H4 an 
activation energy of 95 kJ/mol [18]. The enthalpy values of the different states ob-
served in the scission of radicalized PE chains are indicated in Figure 4.3. Kagiya [14] 
has derived a number of activation energies, D, mostly for vinyl polymers. He uses 
the assumption that D is equal to the heat of polymerization, Q, and the activation 
energy Ep of the propagation reaction: 
D =Q+ Ep. 
(4.23) 
His values are reported in Table 4.8. Again it must be mentioned that a stress-
induced scission reaction may require an energy of activation which is considerably 
larger than the listed values of D.

The only experimental indication of the weakening of radicalized chains so far 
know to the author of this book are the studies of Tomaskevskii et al. [19]. They 
report that the tensile strength (at 77 K) of PE-, PP- and PA6-fibers decreases with 
increasing number of (x-ray produced) free radicals (of a concentration of up to 
1020 cm-3). For these materials weakening coefficients of 1.5, 4 and 5.10-20 MPa 
cm3 per radical have been determined. As the authors indicate the latter two coef-
ficients may possibly be too high because of unaccounted radiation damage. This 
means that the normally observed radical concentrations of up to 1018 spins/cm3 
reduce by their pure presence the strength of a PA6-fiber by up to 0.05 MPa - a 
rather insignificant amount (see also 8IC2). 
III. Form of Binding Potential 
In Figure 4.1 it was qualitatively indicated how the potential energy of two bonded 
atoms changes with their interatomal distance r. Knowledge of the exact form of 
the interatomal potential could - in principle - be obtained from a calculation of the 
102 

References for Chapter 4 
total electronic energy E of a molecule as a function of r. For polyatomic molecules, 
however, E(r) cannot be calculated by any of the mentioned approximation methods 
with reasonable accuracy. So the potential functions are described by empirical, 
phenomenological functions. These functions will, of course, necessarily utilize 
those molecular constants which are otherwise obtainable, e.g. bond length (ro), bond 
stretching force constant, and dissociation energy D. One of these functions is the 
Morse potential function which has the virtue to lead to a solvable Schrodinger 
Equation: 
v = D exp [-2a(r - ro)] - 2D exp [-a(r - ro)]. 
(4.24) 
The Morse constant a can be expressed through force constant and anharmonici-
ty constant x of the oscillator formed by the bond atoms. The Morse function yields 
the energy eigenvalues of an anharmonic oscillator which are correct within a size· 
able range of amplitudes (in the case of H2 for 0.4 < r/ro < 1.6). For large r, how-
ever, V becomes progressively too small [8b].

A chain molecule as part of a thennoplastic body is in thermal contact with other 
chains and constantly in thermal motion. The atoms vibrate and take part in the more 
or less hindered rotations of groups and even of chain segments. With no external 
forces acting all molecular entities try to approach - and fluctuate around - the most 
probable conformation attainable to them. The action of external forces causes - or 
maintains - displacements of the chain from those positions and evokes retractive 
forces. Let us consider a chain or a bundle of chains in thennal contact with the sur-
rounding and at constant volume. The condition of thermodynamic stability of such 
a system is that the free energy 
F= U - TS 
(5.1) 
assume a minimum. The differential changes of the free energy of the system are 
given by the changes of its internal energy U and its entropy S. Under isothermal con-
ditions one has: 
dF=dU- TdS. 
(5.2) 
An increase of U can be effected by heat dQ flowing into the system from the 
outside or by mechanical work dW done onto the system. The change of entropy 
may be split up into a portion -deS which is equal to dQ/T and into the internal 
entropy production diS caused by irreversible processes as for instance by stress 
relaxation or generation of heat through friction: 
105 

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
(5.3) 
From Eq. (5.3) one derives the force facting upon a chain with end-to-end 
distance r as: 
(aw) 
(aF) 
(ais) 
f= 
"'3'f"" 
V.T = ar V,T + T Tr V,T 
(5.4) 
The uniaxial force on a relaxing chain molecule depends, therefore, on the 
changes of internal energy and entropy associated with a change of its end-to-end 
distance and on the entropy production term (which is always positive). These three 
different force contributions will be examined in the following. 
A. Entropy Elastic Deformation 
The kinetic theory of rubber elasticity was essentially developed between 1930 
and 1943. A detailed description of the development of this theory and its present 
state is given by e.g. the classical treatises of Flory [1] or Treloar [2]. The necessary 
conditions for the occurrence of rubberlike elastic behavior are the presence of a 
long chain molecule possessing internal flexibility (freely rotating links) and the 
absence of strong secondary bonds acting between a segment and surrounding seg-
ments of the same or other chains. The stress-strain relation for a single finite chain 
then is derived from the distribution of chain conformations. Following the treat-
ment of Treloar it will briefly be recalled which chain properties enter the stress-
strain relations and what levels of force are attainded. 
First the conformations of certain idealized chains are considered. For the cl1llin 
of n eqUilllinks of length Q joined entirely at random (Le. neglecting valence angles 
and hindrances to internal rotation) the probability distribution p(x, y, z) to find 
a chain end at a point (x, y, z) - if the other end is fixed at the origin - is obtained 
as a Gaussian distribution: 
(5.5) 
The only parameter, b, is the inverse of the most probable chain end separation 
and is under the above conditions ..J3/2nQ2 . The extended length of the chain is, of 
course, equal to nQ, whereas the average chain end separation (the "root-mean-
square length".Jf'2 equals Q Vn. 
More realistic is the model of the statistically kinked cl1llin with valence angles 
and hindrances to internal rotation. Here the mean square length is derived as: 
~ = nQ2 1 + cos Q 
• 1 + a 
l-cOSQ I-a 
(5.6) 
where Q is the semi-angle of the cone of bond rotation and a is the mean value of 
cos cp, cp being the angle of bond rotation counted with respect to the trans-con-
formation. The (limit for infinite chain lengths of the) ratio r2/nQ2 is called the char-
106 

I. Stress-Strain Curve of a Single Chain 
acteristic ratio. If the rotation of a bond is considered to be independent of the po-
sition of other bonds and free within its cone of rotation then a is zero. 
A given (hydrocarbon) chain can be treated as a statistically kinked chain with 
valence angles and also as freely jointed chain. The root-mean-square lengths and 
extended lengths of both models correspond to each other then and only then 
when a random link of appropriate length has been used. This "equivalent random 
link" of length Qr is rather short and contains only a few chain atoms. For paraffin-
type chains Treloar obtained a length Qr of 0.377 nm, for cis-polyisoprene 0.352 nm. 
These equivalent random links are about two times smaller than the (shortest) seg-
ment lengths necessary to form a fold of 1800 • 
The entropy S of a single chain is according to Eq. (5.5) and the Boltzmann 
relation 
(5.7) 
where C 1 is a constant. An important aspect of the entropy of a chain is - in the 
words of Treloar [2a] -: "A chain does not possess an entropy by the mere fact 
of having a specified conformation, but only on the virtue of the large number of 
conformations accessible to it under specified conditions of restraint". If these 
conditions consist only in the location of the end-points of the chain at specified 
positions, then the appropriate expression for the entropy is Eq. (5.7). In the 
presence of external hindrances to bond rotation the entropy of a chain is not given 
by Eq. (5.7) since p(x, y, z) must then be corrected for the number of inaccessible 
states. 
The retractive force f acting between the chain ends - and in the direction of 
the line joining them - is derived from Eqs. (5.2), (5.4) and (5.7). If one considers 
a reversible deformation and postulates that all conformational states posses the 
same internal energy U so that U does not depend on conformation then 
(5.8) 
The random coil in thermal equilibrium behaves as a spring (of length zero) 
with a spring constant 2 kT b2 • The level of force exerted by such a spring with its 
ends separated by the most probable distance r = lib is fairly small. For a hydro-
carbon chain of molecular weight 14'000 with an extended length of 125.5 nm 
and a most probable chain end distance of 7 nm, this force is 17 . 10-13 N which 
corresponds to a force per cross-section of the chain, flq, of 10 MN/m2 
(l08 dyn/cm2). As one should expect this "chain stress" is very close to the 
modulus G = NkT of a rubber network having chains of exactly this length between 
crosslink points and for which Gis 17.5 MN/m2. 
. 
The Gaussian theory considers the number of possible conformations of a chain 
having a specified end-to-end distance. A more accurate non-Gaussian statistical 
treatment of the freely jointed chain is based on the distribution of sin 8 1 , i.e. of the 
angle between the direction of a random link and of the end-to-end vector. From 
the probability of finding nl links in the range ~81 , n2 in ~82 and so on, the 
entropy of a single chain is derived [2b] as 
107

where C2 is a constant and 13 the so-called inverse Langevin function .2"-1 (r/m). 
Using (5.2) and (5.4) one obtains 
f= (~T) .2"-1 (r/nQ) 
(5.10) 
which can be expanded into

It is of special interest to note that this stress-strain relation can also be derived 
from a consideration of the potential energy of the statistical links in a unidirectional 
force field. James and Guth [3] and Flory [1] have used the fact that an amount of 
work of f . Q (1 - cos ei) must be performed to rotate a link from a position of 
e = 0 to e = ei ; if the orientational energy -fQ cos ei is distributed according to 
Boltzmann statistics then the mean extension of a link in the direction of force is 
Zi = Q.2"(fQ/kT) 
(5.12) 
and the mean total chain end-to-end distance is 
r = nZi = nQ.2" (fQ/kT) 
(5.13) 
which by inversion directly yields Eq. (5.10). It should be pointed out that so far this 
result has been derived without introducing - or permitting - any internal or 
external hindrances to rotation of a link. The absence of external hindrances also 
means that in longitudinal extension or contraction of the chain or of parts thereof 
no frictional forces are encountered. The forces exerted by the chain ends are solely 
the consequence of the imbalance of exchange of momentum between the chain 
and its surrounding. 
If a hydrocarbon chain behaves as described by Eq. (5.13) and if such a chain 
were to reach a breaking force (of, say, 17· 10-10 N) at room temperature then 
fQ/kT must exceed 150. For an argument that large the Langevin function is equal 
to I-kT/fQ andfis: 
f= nkT/(nQ - r). 
(5.14) 
In the chosen example of a hydrocarbon chain of 125.5 nm extended length, 
breaking stresses will only be reached if r is larger than 124.7 nm. In other words only 
2 of the 333 random links of 0.377 nm length may point in a direction perpendic-
ular to the chain end-to-end vector while all the remaining ones then have to be 
fully aligned. Even at this extreme elongation the Langevin function gives a good 
approximation of the stress-strain behavior of the randomly kinked chain. This 
108 

I. Stress-Strain Curve of a Single Chain 
becomes evident by comparison with the so called exact solution of Treloar [2c] 
which is purely based on geometrical (and combinatorial) considerations and from 
which one derives for extreme elongations: 
f= -kT dJ2n p/dr = -kT/r + (n-2) kT/(nQ-r). 
(5.15) 
The force-elongation relations (5.8), (5.10), and (5.15) have been derived under 
the condition that all conformational states have the same internal energy, that all 
states are accessible, and that transitions between different states are easily accom-
plished. No chain molecule - and especially not within a solid - does fully comply 
with the above conditions. For one thing there are the intramolecular interactions 
(between nearest and second nearest atoms of one chain) which cause the potential 
energy of the chain to be a function of the angle of rotation with distinct relative 
minima in more than one position. All this is well known and documented (e.g. 1-5) 
and will not be discussed here. The direct or indirect consequences with respect to 
the retractive forces between (PE or PA) chain ends are the following: 
-
the internal energy of (in-plane) trans-conformations is lower than that of (out-
of plane) gauche-conformations 
-
the probability td find a conformation with internal energy ~U is weighted by 
the Boltzmann factor exp (-~U/kT) 
-
the average end-to-end distance increases with a according to Eq. (5.6), the 
length Q of the equivalent random link also grows in proportion to (l +a)/{l -a), 
while the number n of random links in a chain of finite length decreases 
the force between chain ends at their most probable distance (r = lib) is in-
versely proportional to r and thus also to the square root of the characteristic 
ratio, the force is the smaller the larger the characteristic ratio is. 
The characteristic ratio of PE at room temperature is - according to Abe 
et al. [4] - 8.0 as compared to a value of 2 calculated under neglect of hindrances 
to bond rotation. The force between PE chain ends, therefore, is by a factor of 2 
smaller if the effect of the potential energy on chain conformation is taken into 
consideration. For polyamide chains the detailed calculations of Flory and Williams 
[5] led to characteristic ratios of 6.08 (PA 6) and 6.10 (P A 66) in excellent agree-
ment with the experimental value of 5.95 for PA 66 found by Saunders [6]. The 
calculated force between PA chain ends, then, will be smaller by a factor of about 
1.7. 
A second cause to invalidate Eq. (5.7) are strong intermolecular interactions 
between chain segments which do have the effect that only a restricted number of 
conformational states are accessible to a chain segment, that transitions between 
different states may not be independent from each other, and that energy is required 
to activate these (cooperative) transitions. In recent years considerable progress has 
been made to apply the methods of statistical thermodynamics also to systems 
subject to the above restrictions in order to derive the distribution of conformational 
disorder and to explain e.g. the stress-strain behavior or the melting and crystallisation 
of chain molecules [4-8,60-63]. With respect to chain loading one is interested in 
the entropy changes associated with the elongation of a highly extended chain. In 
the following ~S will be calculated for PE and PA chain segments of 3 to 6 nm length.

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
It is convenient to start with Pechhold's [7] treatment of the polyethylene 
molecule. He derived the partition function of the rotational isomers of a chain 
with n independent C-C bonds. The chain is allowed to rotate around its C-C 
bonds, it will, therefore, encounter three minima of potential energy of which the 
absolute minimum belongs to the extended trans-conformation (t). Two relative 
minima at an angle ± 1200 out of plane allow two gauche-conformations (g,g) 
with a conformational energy of + LlU. The kink-isomers are the subclass of the 
rotational isomers where only n/2 of the bonds - and no adjacent ones - may have 
a g or g position. For kink isomers entropy, internal energy, and free energy as a 
function of the average concentration x of gauche-conformations are derived [7] 
as: 
x = exp (-LlU/kT) 1[1 + 2 exp (-LlU/kT)] 
S = - 0.5 nk Qn (1 - 2x) + nx LlU/T 
U = nx LlU 
F = 0.5 nkT Qn (1 - 2x). 
(5.16) 
(5.17) 
(5.18) 
(5.19) 
The group of kink isomers still comprises chains with quite different deviations 
from a planar zig-zag conformation, the simplest of those kinks being ttgtgttt 
(2gl kink), tgttgt (2g2 kink), tgtgtgt (3g2 kink). Each kink causes a contraction 
in longitudinal direction which is a multiple & of..j2J3 Q with Q the length of a C-C 
bond (Pechhold accordingly denotes a kink containing q gauche positions and 
causing a contraction & as a qg Llz-kink). A chain with n C-C bonds and mj qgi-
kinks has a projected length in z-direction of (n - imj) ..j2J3 Q. Vice versa a pro-
jected length corresponding to that of n C-C bonds can be realized as well by an 
extended chain with n C-C bonds, by a chain with n + 1 bonds containing a 2gl 
kink, by chains with n + 2 bonds containing either two 2gl kinks or a 2g2 kink or 
by other appropriate combinations. The statistical weight of each conformation is 
given by the number of ways that conformation can be realized and by the Boltz-
mann factor of its conformational energy. The by far leading term in the partition 
function for a given r is always that listing the number of possible conformations 
of chains containing only 2gl kinks. The number of ways of arranging Dg/2 pairs of 
g and g bonds on n/2 available positions clearly is

In Table 5.1 the statistical weights of PE chains with a gauche-concentration of 
up to 20% are given according to Eq. (5.20). Also listed are the statistical weights 
of 6 PA chains subject to the condition that the two gauche positions of anyone 
gtgt kink are confined to the (six) C-C bonds of one monomeric unit and that the 
carbonamide group adheres to a trans-planar conformation [5]. As potential energy 
Ll U of a gauche position the "preferred value of 0.5 kcallmol" [5] has been used. 
The change of Qn Z (n, i) with r is essentially the same as the change of the 
complete partition function (which accounts for mgi-kinks of all types). One can cal-

culate, therefore, from the data of Table 5.1 the entropy elastic contribution to the 
retractive force as - kT ~Qn (Z)j ~r. The energy elastic contribution, fe, derives 
here from the change of conformational energy and is ~ng~Uj~r. For the chosen 
examples of a PE chain with 40 C-C bonds, a 6 PA chain of 6 monomer units and 
gauche energies ~U of 0.5 and 0.75 kcaljmol one obtains the force contributions 
listed in Table 5.2. For comparison the forces derived for the statistically kinked 
chain according to the Langevin and the "exact" approximation are also given. It 
is immediately apparent that in kink isomers the energy-elastic contribution fe is 
of the same order of magnitude - and opposite sign - as the entropy-elastic force. 
The molecular stresses, qr, are obtained by dividing the axial forces f through the 
molecular cross-section q, whereas the elastic moduli are understood as: 
E=r~fjMq. 
(5.21) 
This investigation may be summarized by saying that the retractive forces ex-
perienced by highly extended chain segments at room temperature due to confor-
mational changes are small in comparison to the ultimate forces that can be carried 
by a chain. External hindrances to segment rotation have not been treated here. At 
present is suffices to state that they will only further diminish the -already - small 
entropy elastic forces. 
B. Energy Elastic Chain Deformation 
So far the energy-elastic deformation of the (assumedly rigid) chain skeleton has 
not been considered. In response to axial forces the chain skeleton will deform,

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
however, through hindered rotation, bending, and stretching of main chain bonds 
[12]. In Table 5.3 the stiffnesses characterizing these individual modes of defonna-
tion and their combination in a loaded chain are listed. The C-C bond bending and 
stretching moduli have been calculated from the corresponding force constants. The 
modulus for the hindered rotation of a kinked chain is derived from the rotational 
potential of CH2 groups and the associated axial chain elongation as formulated 
by Pechhold [7] who used an intramolecular rotational barrier of 2 kcal/mol above 
gauche energy. The resulting modulus is a function of the angle of rotation and 
ranges between 4 and 7 GN/m2 in good agreement with a value of Bowden [10] 
of 5.7 GN/m2. In axial stretching the hindered rotation of gauche bonds contributes 
to axial elongation, the chain stiffness thus decreases with the concentration of gauche 
bonds. 
Longitudinal chain moduli, defined as in Eq. (5.21), have been determined 
theoretically and experimentally in a number of ways: 
through calculation from spectroscopically determined bond bending and stretch-
ing constants 
from the Raman shifts of extended chain hydrocarbons 
from x-ray observations of load-induced changes of the unit cell dimensions in 
highly oriented polymers. 
These methods, their results, and the arguments to explain a certain disagreement 
between the numerical results have been reviewed by e.g. Sauer and Woodward [9]. 
More recently the direct calculation of the total (electronic) energy (of a PE chain) 
with changing atomic geometry has been attempted by Boudreaux [11]. In his self-
consistent field molecular orbital (SCF - MO) calculations he searched for "that 
set of numbers which, when used as coefficients of the assigned atomic orbitals, 
produces an approximation to the wave function which minimizes the total energy". 
Hahn et al. [14] presently investigate a model based on the elastic interaction of 
essentially rigid Sp3 valence tetrapods (shell-model). The values of PE and PP chain 
moduli thus obtained by different researchers are represented in Figure 5.1. For PE 
some preference has been given in this book to the value of Ec = 290 GNm-2 mea-
sured by Strobl and Eckel [58], which has recently been confinned by Kobayashi 
et al. [58]. 
From Table 5.3 it is apparent that the weakest mode of skeleton deformation 
(4.7 GN/m2) is that derived from the hindered rotation of (non-extended) bonds 
whereas a fully extended chain segment has a 50 times larger stiffness. The elastic 
modulus of a partially extended kinked chain, then, is: 
lIE = ~ xi/Ei 
i 
(5.22) 
where the Ei are the stiffnesses of the individual (trans-planar, kinked, or helical) 
segments of a chain and the Xi are the corresponding (volume) fractions. 
One is now in a position to determine the change of the free energy F of a 
partly extended chain as a function of the end-to-end distance r. As an example 
the quasi-static defonnation of PE segments will be treated within the frame of 
the bond-bending and stretching model. The minimum free energy of a segment 
containing n C-C bonds and nk 2g1 kinks is attained at an end-to-end distance

r = (n - nk)../213 a. This minimum free energy is equal to nk ~U-RT Qn Z. From 
the statistical weight of the (n, nk) conformations of PE segments with n = 40 
(Table 5.1) the minimum free energy values have been calculated. They are indicated 
in Figure 5.2 at the appropriate chain-end distances. If the chain ends are axially dis-
placed from these equilibrium positions energy elastic forces arise which have an 
unsymmetric potential. In stretching completely extended sections the trans bonds 
are deformed in the plane of the zig-zag chain according to the chain modulus Estr • 
The gauche bonds are performing a hindered rotation out of the zig-zag plane 
(Brot). The stretching modulus E of the kinked segment then is derived from 
Eq. (5.22). The chain is the stiffer the fewer gauche bonds it contains. Employing 
the rotation potential mentioned above [7] and an extended chain modulus of 
200 GN/m2 the tensile sections of the free energy curves have been calculated. The 
presence of only 5 kinks softens the chain segment quite noticeably (E decreases 
to 9.5 GN/m2). 
The axial compression of an extended chain differs in so far as the trans bonds 
now aquire the freedom to perform a hindered rotation out of the zig-zag plane. 
This freedom is not exercised in tension because it would be energetically less 
favorable than bond bending and stretching. The axial compression modulus of a 
zig-zag chain is essentially determined by the hindered rotation mode of deforma-
tion, it corresponds to the extension modules of a highly kinked chain (nk = n/4) 
and has been taken to be 5 GN/m2 •

_ For each conformational state an asymmetric parabola is obtained. In quasi-
static straining an individual, kinked chain will tend to assume that state of minimum 
free energy accessible to it. Transitions between different conformational states will 
occur (solid line in Fig. 5.2). The transition to a more extended conformation will 
cause an immediate release of axial stress for the chain segment in question - and 
thus constitute a thermodynamically irreversible process. Macroscopically the step-
wise and uncorrelated release of stress in a large number of chains is felt as stress 
relaxation. The random thermal motion of chain atoms and the existence of ex-
ternal hindrances to bond rotation are the reason that the deformation potentials 
of individual chain segments deviate from each other and from the solid line - as 
arbitrarily indicated by the heavy dashed line. The deformation potential shown 
in Figure 5.2 essentially represents also that of other (planar) zig-zag chains such 
as PA 6 or 66 which have the same kind and concentration of gauche bonds and 
about the same length. Recent model calculations are found in refs. [69,70]. 
c. Non-Equilibrium Response 
The stress-induced conformational transitions of a kinked chain as represented by 
the solid line in Figure S.2 are thermodynamically irreversible, internal energy is 
converted into heat. At this point one is interested in the time-constant of the tran-
sition process: if it is small compared to the time within which chain stretching is 
accomplished then the stress-strain curve will not deviate very much from the solid 
line, if the time constant is extremely large then transitions may be considered to 
116 

II. Axial Mechanical Excitation of Chains 
be impossible, the chains deform energy-elastically. In the intermediate region of 
time constants, however, the largest stresses of not fully extended chains will depend 
on the rate at which stress releasing conformational transitions take place. A detailed 
discussion of this effect requires a consideration of the geometry and interaction 
of molecular chains, of the principles of irreversible thermodynamics [15], and analy-
sis of the potential of the secondary or van der Waal's bonds between segments 
[16,69-71]. It leads to a description of the anelastic deformation of polymers 
which is not intended in this book. Nevertheless one is still interested in some in-
formation with respect to the rate of stress relieving transitions between different 
kink-isomers. Since any transitions leading to the motion of just a single kink gene-
rally do not cause any axial chain elongation one has at least to consider the simul-
taneous activation and annihilation of two kinks. Such process involves the rotation 
of four gauche bonds and the rotational translation of the segment between the 
kinks, the energy of activation can be estimated to be 8 kcal/mol for the rotation 
of gauche bonds [7] and 0.5 to 1.2 kcal per mol of rotating CH2 groups to overcome 
the intermolecular barriers [17, 18]. A tgtg ttg tgt-kink requires, therefore, an acti-
vation energy of 11 to 15.2 kcal/mol to transform into the all-trans conformation. 
One may assume that in stress-free PE chains such transformations do occur with 
a rate of at least 1 S-1 at a temperature somewhat below the melting point, i.e. at 
400 K. One may then calculate the rate of this process at 300 K from Eq. (3.22) 
as 0.0018 s-1. If the chain is strained the activation energy for segment rotation 
only decreases and the rate of stress relieving transitions increases [19]. With such 
a time-scale one may consider stress-induced rotational transitions as being easily 
accomplished before a chain segment reaches elastic energies sufficient for chain 
scission at room temperature, i.e. more than 25 kcal/mol (see also [70, 71 D. 
It remains the entropy production term in Eq. (5.4) to be discussed. Under 
the conditions of this section - quasi-static axial loading of the ends of a segment 
and determination of the ensuing retractive forces - this term is essentially zero. 
II. Axial Mechanical Excitation of Chains 
A. Secondary or van der Waal's Bonds 
In Section A the stress-strain behavior of a single chain segment loaded pointwise at 
its ends has been discussed. In (uncross-linked) thermoplastic polymers, however, 
large axial forces cannot be applied pointwise to a main chain bond but only be 
built up gradually along the chain through - the much weaker - intermolecular 
forces. The forces between molecules are a superposition of the close range (nucle-
onic) repulsiop. and the (electronic) van der Waal's attraction, which includes elec-
trostatic forces between ions, dipoles or quadrupoles, induction forces due to polari-
zation of atoms and molecules, and the generally most important quantum-chemical 
dispersion forces. The van der Waal's attraction is the cause of the solidification and 
crystallization of high polymers, it is theoretically quite well understood and has 
been treated in detail by Langbein [16]. With reference to this work and the general 
references in Chapter 1 it can be stated that the secondary forces are not saturated 
117 

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
and are nondirectional, i.e. not confmed to precise locations of the neighbor atoms 
at e.g. tetrahedral bond angles. To the extent that these assumptions are valid the 
potential of the intermolecular forces acting on a chain or segment can be replaced 
by the sum of the interaction potentials of all appropriate pairs of atoms. The pair 
potentials contain an attractive term - which is theoretically derivable and decreases 
with the 6th power of the interatomic distance [16] and a repulsive term for which 
only semi-empirical expressions can be given. The total energy of intermolecular 
interaction, i.e. the cohesive energy of a solid then is to be understood as the sum of 
the pair interactions. In thermodynamic equilibrium a chain segment attains a position 
such that the free energy of interaction is a minimum. If a chain segment is displaced 
with respect to this position the free energy is raised and retractive forces arise. Such 
axial displacements are realized in quasi-static pulling a chain segment which is part 
of a crystal lamella against the crystal lattice or of extended chains against a glassy 
matrix. Dynamic chain stretching occurs in the shear deformation of molecules in 
solution or the melt. In the following it will be discussed which level of axial chain 
stress can be attained in these cases, that is in the loading of primary bonds through 
secondary or van der Waal's forces. 
B. Static Displacements of Chains Against Crystal Lattices 
The first investigations of the loading of chains displaced with respect to their 
equilibrium positions within a crystal lattice have been carried out by Chevychelov 
[20]. He used a continuum approach, i.e. replaced the string of discrete chain atoms 
by a continuous mass distribution. Each mass point experiences a periodic repulsive 
crystal potential if displaced from its equilibrium position. Later Kausch and Lang-
bein [21] and Kausch and Becht [22] extended these calculations to treat the static 
and dynamic interaction of chains of discrete atoms with arbitrary periodic poten-
tials. 
The model used in these investigations is represented by Figure 5.3. It consists 
of a tie molecule (t) which forms part of a crystal lamella (c), leaves it perpendicular-
ly to the crystal fold surface, (I), extends straightly through an amorphous region 
(a) and enters the adjacent crystallite of which it forms a part. The crystal boundaries

are assumed to be ideally sharp. No interaction between the tie chain and the amor-
phous material outside of the crystallite is taken into account. 
A tie molecule thus embedded in two different crystalline layers is streched if 
the crystal lamellae are separated by macroscopic stresses. Because of the large elastic 
modulus of the chain molecule very high axial stresses are exerted onto the chain 
if it experiences the same strain as its amorphous vicinity. This high axial stress 
tends to pull the tie molecule against the intracrystalline potential and out of the 
crystal lamella. 
In the following calculations the assumedly rigid solid is represented by an 
interaction potential the depth of which corresponds to two times the average 
(lateral) cohesive energy U with which the chain segments are bound within lamellar 
crystals or amorphous regions. Upon axial displacement in z-direction (chain axis) 
a chain will rotate and translate along a temperature-dependent minimum energy 
path. For polyethylene (PE) Lindenmeyer [17] has given the maximum potential 
energy to be overcome by a CH2 group in twisted translation as .1Utt = 500 cal/mol 
at room temperature. The potential energy of a CH2 group within the amorphous 
phase can be determined from the difference of the enthalpies of crystalline and 
amorphous PE at absolute zero temperature, Ham, 0 - Her, 0 = 661 cal/mol [23]. 
It should also be taken into account that the internal energy of a partly oriented 
PE may be smaller than that of an amorphous one. The energy difference will be 
comparable to the enthalpy difference (Ham - Hdef), which was estimated by 
Fischer and Hinrichsen [24] to be 140 cal/mol. As function of its z-position within 
an otherwise undisturbed crystal a CH2 group would encounter a potential energy 
as shown in Figure 5.4. 
Each point along a tie chain is characterized by its distance z from the crystal • 
boundary, where z refers to the unstressed situation. The displacement of the molec-
ular point z under stress is denoted by u = u (z) and the crystal potential per unit 
length by V(u). The axial stress, s, acting along the chain decreases with increasing

to 1.372 nN. For any force larger than So no static equilibrium can be established 
within a defect-free crystallite. It should be noted that this force which pulls out of 
the crystal a chain of full crystal length is 15.8 times larger than the force" v d 
which is necessary to pullout a single monomer unit. If the tension So is divided 
by the chain cross-section (0.1824 nm2 ) one arrives at the maximum axial stress 
which a perfect PE crystallite is able to exert on a tie molecule: 7.5 GN/m2 . As can 
be seen from Figure 5.5, the maximum mechanical excitation of a chain penetrates 
about 5 nm into the crystallite. At a distance of 6 nm from the crystal boundary it 
is smaller than the average thermal amplitude at room temperature, which is about 
0.008nm. 
Kausch and Langbein [21] extended the above calculations to various boundary 
conditions at the lower stress end, -Z, of the chain. If the chain terminates at -Z 
or continues into the adjacent amorphous region, it experiences no or only very weak 
axial forces. This case is covered by putting A < vI". If, on the other hand, a stressed 
tie-chain folds back at -Z, any axial displacement there implies a deformation of 
the fold. Such a deformation entails a considerable distortion of the crystal lattice 
and requires strong axial forces. In this case the integration constant A generally 
becomes larger than vI". After having derived the equations necessary for describing 
the elastic interaction between a chain and a crystal - represented by one unique 
potential- for arbitrary boundary conditions the authors [21] took into account 
also the fact that in a crystal containing hydrogen bonds -like that of 6-polyamide-
the intermolecular interaction differs in different crystal regions. It is much stronger 
at the sites of C=O and N-H chain groups than it is at the sites of CH2 groups. The 
problem of calculating the elastic displacement of a continuous chain passing through 
alternating regions of strong and weak attraction can be solved through alternate 
application of appropriate boundary conditions. In this case the boundary condition 
is that chain displacement and chain tension are continuous at all points Zj where 
the potential changes from weak attraction (v = VI) to strong attraction (v = V2)

or vice versa (refer to Fig. 5.6 for notation). Here it was assumed that the difference 
between the cohesive energies Ucoh of PA (18.4 kcal/mol) and PE (6.3 kcal/mol) is 
caused by the presence of hydrogen bonds between the carbonamide groups of 
neighboring molecules within the grid planes of the (monoclinic) P A crystallites. 
This excess energy contributes to the intermolecular potential v2 acting between 
carbonamide groups. The potential V2 thus is (12.1 + 0.50) kcal/mol, which is 
equivalent to 0.369 nN. 
Chain tension and displacement of a 6-PA tie molecule within a 6-PA crystal 
are shown in Figure 5.7. The strong attractive effect of the hydrogen bonds results 
in a rapid drop of chain tension at the position of the carbonamide groups. The de-
crease of both tension and displacement is much more rapid than in the case of PE. 
At a distance of 2.1 nm from the crystal boundary the displacement has already 
dropped to the average level of thermal vibration at room temperature. With the 
crystal boundary positioned - as shown in Figure 5.7 - at the end of a (-CH2-)s 
segment the maximum chain tension is So = 3.94 nN. This tension is only 1.7 times 
the force necessary to remove one carbonamide group from the crystal, i.e. 59% 
of the maximum chain tension is expended to break the hydrogen bonds of the 
first CONH group. It should be noted that the value of So depends upon the geometric 
arrangement of the atoms at the crystal boundary. With a carbonamide group at the 
crystal boundary the maximum tension So is about 20% smaller than in the case 
where the crystal boundary runs through the middle of the (-CH2 -)s segment [21]. 
If So is divided by the molecular cross section (0.176 nm2) a stress of 22.4 GN/m2 
is obtained, which may be termed the static strength of a perfect (monoclinic) 
6-PA crystal. 
The above strength values have been derived for the interaction between a periodic 
potential and a continuous elastic chain. Kausch and Langbein [21] have shown, how· 
ever, that there are only insignificant changes if the model using a continuous chain 
is replaced by the more accurate one using a string of discrete atoms. 
In the preceding calculations a lattice potential had been used which did not 
depend on the applied axial chain stress. Evidently, this condition is not quite cor-
rect since each stressed chain will pull on its nearest neighbors which will in turn 
releave part of the stress by displacement with respect to the second nearest neigh-

bors - and so on. Meanwhile, Gibson et al. [48] have analyzed this problem using 
shear lag theory and finite elements. They find that the factors influencing stress 
transfer between the ties and the surrounding crystal are the following: 
- The ratio of the crystal shear and tensile moduli (G/E) 
- The ratio of the tie radius (ro) to the lamellar crystal thickness (Q) 
- The proportion of ties spanning the interface (p). 
Their calculations for PE crystals show a lateral stress-decay half width of the or-
der of the tie radius (-Q.2 nm) whereas the axial chain stress decays to one half with-
in about 3 nm. Gibson et al. [48] show that in view of the rather rapid lateral stress 
decay the Kausch approach (Eq. 5.28), shear lag theory, and finite element analysis 
of the three-dimensional problem practically coincide. They also note that in view 
of the chain displacement within the crystal the effective stiffness of ties will be only 
about 0.25-0.7 of the crystal stiffness in most cases. 
Crystal defects have been intensively studied for a long time by Reneker et al. 
He introduced in 1962 the point dislocations created by "double occupancy" of a 
lattice site [49]. In a recent publication, the structure and energy of other crystallo-
graphic defects such as dispirations, disclinations and chain twist are treated [50]. 
The total excess energy of a dislocation in a PE crystal is given as 27.7 kcal/mol-1 
of which 14.2 kcal/mol- 1 are intramolecular excess energy. 
c. Thermally Activated Displacements of Chains Against Crystal Lattices 
As stated repeatedly crystal and chain are in thermal motion; the chain atoms, there-
fore, vibrate around the new equilibrium positions z + u given e.g. by Eq. (5.28). 
123 

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
The effect of the correlated or uncorrelated motion of the chain atoms on the inter-
molecular potential energy can be calculated if the dispersion of vibrational ampli-
tudes along the chain is known [22]. A chain subjected to maximum tension So 
is not resistant to translation. Even the smallest thermal vibration will cause further 
displacement of the chain and a decrease in axial tension at the boundary. The point 
of maximum tension will rapidly propagate into the crystallite (Fig. 5.8). The "dis-

location" is fully developed once the displacement at the crystal boundary, ua, has 
reached the value of the chain repeat unit length d. The energy W d of the defect in-
troduced into the crystal by displacement of the atoms of one chain is easily calcu-
lated as the sum of the potential energies of the chain atoms and of the elastic chain 
energy. Both are a function of external tension. In Figure 5.9 the dislocation energy 
has been plotted as a function of displacement Ua and tension sa at the crystal bound-
ary. The energy of a completed defect (displacement of the chain by d) in PE amounts 
to 32.85 kcal/mol. This value is in very good agreement with the 27.7 kcal/mol calcu-
lated by Reneker et al. [50]. At tensions smaller than So the displacements ua are 
smaller than d/2, the defect energy is smaller than Wd(SO), and the defect has a stable 
position. At displacements larger than d/2 the system becomes unstable since the 
chain tension decreases with increasing displacement ua . 
As shown in Figure 5.9, transitions between the stable and the unstable state 
can be caused by thermal activation. The required activation energy Ud is given by 
(5.30) 
In Table 5.4 the activation energies required for translation of CH2 -CH2 seg-
ments are listed for various displacements Ua and tensions sa. One observes that 
at chain tensions which are as little as 4% less than the maximum tension still an 
activation energy for chain translation of 9.8 kcal/mol is required. One may safely

state, therefore, that even under consideration of longitudinal chain vibrations 
chain translation will occur at chain tensions close to the specified values. 
D. Chain Displacements Against Randomly Distributed Forces 
The rupture of chains in amorphous matrices or in solution clearly indicates that 
large axial forces can also be reached in the absence of periodic potentials. Again 
forces derive from the displacement of chains or of parts thereof with respect to 
the surrounding matrix. If one divides a non-extended chain into small sections of 
identical projected lengths one will obtain sections of quite different conformation. 
As well the sectional chain moduli Ei as - most probably - the interaction poten-
tials Vi = -Wi . ~2 /2 will vary from section to section. To obtain the axial displace-
ment of an arbitrary sequence of chain sections an interpolation given by Kausch 
and Langbein [21] may be used who have found that the changes of chain stress a 
and displacement u within a heterogeneous matrix are interpolated by an exponen-
tiallaw: 
u = Uo exp 'Y z/L 
(5.31) 
(5.32) 
The chain stress at Z = 0 is derived from Eq. (5.24) replacing the chain elasticity 
constant K by the elastic constant of a series of elastic elements 
(5.33) 
The above equation shows quantitatively that large chain stresses will only be 
obtained if the interaction force constants Wi are of about the same order they are 
in a crystal and if the elastic moduli of the chain sections are large throughout. One 
"weak" section will greatly enhance average displacement and reduce the stress. It 
should also be mentioned that it is not the chain length L and the absolute number 
n of interaction sites which raise the chain stress but the intensity of the interaction 
forces per unit chain length. 
As an example of the static excitation of a chain under these conditions a nearly 
extended chain of end-to-end distance L embedded in a glassy matrix may be con-
sidered. If the matrix (index m) and the chain (no index) were homogeneously 
strained in chain axis direction they would experience the following stresses: 
and 
a = €mL/~4/Ei' 
126 
(5.34) 
(5.35) 

II. Axial Mechanical Excitation of Chains 
Due to the different elastic response the free chain would have to act against 
the lattice potential until chain stress and lattice interaction were in equilibrium at 
any point of the chain. This interaction can be described by identically the same 
mathematical formalism developed above. Since the chain ends are assumed to be 
free they cannot bear any axial stresses. This condition will exactly be met if one 
superimposes the hypothetical stress a (Eq. 5.35) by a compressive stress according 
to Eq. (5.33) where 
(5.36) 
The largest stresses will be found in the center section of the strained chain and 
here the superposition yields: 
Em L 
a(L/2) = L L.j£. [1 - exp (-'Y/2)]. 
I 
I 
(5.37) 
The distribution of axial stresses along the chain is characterized by the two 
stress-free chain ends, two terminal sections of length Lh where the stress increases 
with a rate determined by 'Y/L, and a central chain segment subjected to the maximum 
stress given by Eq. (5.37). The continuous straining of a chain segment through in-
teraction with (harmonic) lattice potentials - as required for the terminal sections -
is limited to a section of finite length because the largest displacement u may not 
exceed the range of validity of the intermolecular potential which is of the order 
of 0.1 nm. For breaking stresses of 20 GN/m2 to be reached under such a condition 
the constant 'Y/L must be larger than 0.7 nm- 1 and the average chain modulus at 
these loads must be that of a fully extended chain; since the displacements of PE 
and 6 P A chains within their rigid crystal lamellae led to 'Y /L-values of 0.4 nm -1 and 
1.55 nm- 1 respectively [22] one is forced to the conclusion that the displacements 
of extended chains within the less tightly packed random aggregates of misaligned 
chains can only lead to smaller than the above values of 'Y/L. If chain scission were 
to occur under the above static conditions it would require a sufficiently stable 
physical crosslinking of the (then non-extended) terminal chain sections to the 
matrix through folds, kinks or entanglements. 
E. Dynamic loading of a chain 
So far the quasi-static interaction between a chain and a surrounding matrix has 
been investigated. It has been indicated that the level of axial forces to be obtained 
in that manner is limited by the occurrence of chain slip. In dynamic loading these 
force levels can be exceeded if frictional forces or forces of inertia become effective. 
If the chain displacement does not occur in static equilibrium and not through 
a single thermally excited step then the translation will not occur reversibly along 
a path of least energy but will require more energy than in the previous cases. The 
rate-dependent energy expended per unit distance of forced translation of a chain 
segment i is equivalent to a frictional shearing force Ti. The response of chains to 
127 

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
shearing forces in solution has extensively been investigated and discussed [2S). A 
number of different molecular theories of the viscoelastic behavior of polymer chains 
in solution have been developed. These predict a relation between e.g. molecular 
weight M (or degree of polymerisation P), solvent viscosity 1/s, intrinsic viscosity 
[1/) ::: lim (1/ - 1/s)/ C1/s, molecular friction coefficient ~ 0, and mean square end -to-end 
distance r~. Following the bead spring model of Rouse [2S) one obtains 
(S.38) 
The quantity ~o represents the frictional force encountered by each monomeric 
unit within the chain which is moved with unit velocity through its surrounding. 
The sectional force fi' therefore, is: 
(S.39) 
In the case of additivity of all sectional forces and in a homogeneous elongation 
strain field one obtains the following distribution of axial stress 1/1 within a chain of 
length L: 
(S.40) 
The largest stresses are encountered in the middle (z::: 0) and amount to 
(S.41) 
Equation (S.41) predicts that for a given system (~o , Lmon , Mo) axial stresses 
are proportional to strain rate and square of molecular weight. Chain rupture occurs 
if 1/Imax reaches or exceeds the chain strength 1/Ib resulting in chain halving. 
In a series of intriguing experiments Keller et aI. [SI-S4) have recently studied 
the conformation of flexible molecular coils in solution subjected to elongational 
flow. Observing the birefringence of the volume element in the center of a cross-slot 
device they showed for the first time that as a function of the rate € of elongational 
strain there is a rapid transition from a coiled conformation to a fully extended one 
at a critical strain rate Ec (coil-stretch tranSition). For an atactic polystyrene of 
Mw ::: 4 . 106 in decalin the €c is of the order of 104 S-1 . For this material the authors 
verified that the critical strain rate descreased with polymer molecular weight M ac-
cording to: 
fc - M-l.S. 
(The exponent of 1.5 is expected from the theory of Zimm for a non-free draining 
coil [S3)). Lower solvent viscosities would increase the critical strain rate. 
If the strain rate of the solution is increased beyond €c the fully extended chains 
become energy-elastically loaded, and they break at a second critical value, if, of 
strain rate (for the above PS at about 1.8' 104 S-I). From Eq. S.41 it can be antic-
ipated that 
128 

III. Deexcitation of Chains 
and precisely this result was obtained by Keller et al. [52, 53] for PS in decalin. By 
molecular weight analysis after accumulation of many chain scission events the au-
thors were also able to state that under these circumstances chain scission occurs in 
the center: chains are being halved. They estimate [53] that this occurs at axial forces 
of 
Ff = 6 . 10-9 N/chain, 
the strength of a C-C bond in the PS main chain as calculated from a Morse potential 
function; since the calculations refer to the static strength (at absolute zero) the value 
of Ff is somewhat higher than the 4 nN given later for dynamic chain scission. Com-
paring PEO and PS chains of equal length at equivalent viscosities Keller found that 
€f (PEO) is 3 times that for PS, the smoother PEO-chain geometry makes the mole-
cwe more "slippery" [54] (see also [71] for the dynamics of stretched chains). 
In a similar attempt to identify the origin of drag reduction Merrill et al. [55] 
have studied the flow of dilute solutions through a sudden contraction. They first ad-
vanced the interesting hypothesis of intramolecwar entanglements in order to explain 
apparently random scission along PS chains [ 5 5a]. In a later paper [5 5b ] they confirm, 
however, chain halving; they point out that the width of the lower molecular weight 
peak in the ensuing distribution will be widened because of the finite probabilities 
for scission of the non-midpoint bonds. In turbwent flows chains break after they 
have been extended and aligned with the flow (see also Nguyen and Kausch [72]). 
In the above cases of a coil in a strained solution it has to be retained that the 
coil-stretch transition is relatively sharp, no partly extended chains corresponding to 
the Langevin region are observed. This is certainly due to the fact that intramolecular 
rotation is achieved in a time which is short compared to 7 = 1/ €c. (This does not 
mean, however, that relaxation from the extended state is equally fast. In fact, Kel-
ler and Odell [52] found that chain contraction against the frictional contact of the 
surrounding liquid is about 50 times slower than chain extenSion.) 
If a solution is circulated repeatedly through the degrading device at a given strain 
rate chain degradation will stop after all chains longer than the limiting value M(oo) 
have been broken: 
The Eqs. (5.41), (5.38), and (5.6) together predict that [1/] € M(oo) is constant 
for a given polymer/solvent system. Kadim [26] obtained for a 0.5 to 1 % solution of 
PIB in decalin [1/] 7 M(oo) = 1.34 kJ/mol. He employed shear rates between 25 and 
700 S-1. Abdel-Alim et al. [27] report on a relation of 7°.41 M(oo) = const. for a 2% 
solution of polyacrylamide in water subjected to shear rates of between 3000 and 
100000 S-1. 
Within more concentrated solutions the physical-chemical behavior of long 
chains (size and interpenetration of molecular coils, kinetics of entanglement forma-
tion) seems to be much more important than the rheological behavior characterized 
by f ° and €. A striking demonstration of this fact was given by Breitenbach, Rigler 
129 

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
and Wolf [28], who prepared solutions of 3.6 to 14.2% by weight of polystyrene 
in cyclohexane. These systems showed a concentration-dependent phase separation 
at a temperature Ttr between 26.4 and 29.4 °c. Shearing these solutions at a rate 
of 600 s-1 and at temperatures slightly above T tr they observed a dramatic increase 
in the rate of degradation when approaching Ttr . At Ttr + 11.6 K no noticeable 
degradation occurred within 20 h. At Tr + 0.6 K a 13% decrease of the limiting vis-
cosity [17] was measured after one hour already. Within 20 h a reduction of the molec-
ular weight from ~ 7 . lOs g/mol to 1.6 . lOs could be achieved. 
A related subject of growing interest is the ultrasonic degradation of polymers 
in solution. In their recent review Basedow and Ebert [29] summarize that ultrasonic 
chain scission is the result of cavitation, i.e. of the nucleation, growth and collapse 
of (gas-fIlled) bubbles. Chain scission occurs in the convergent flow fIelds in the vi-
cinity of collapsing bubbles and through the ensuing shock waves. The properties of 
the solvent do not seem to be of particular importance, but the presence of nuclei 
to initiate cavitation and a minimum intensity of the ultrasonic field (environ 4 W /cm2 ) 
are necessary conditions. Owing to the nature of the degradation process, i.e. to the 
shear loading of chains, the rates of degradation decrease with decreasing molecular 
weight (degree of polymerization) and become infInitely small at a so-called limiting 
molecular weight. For polystyrene in tetrahydrofuran degraded 88 h at 20 kHz 
Basedow and Ebert cite one limiting molecular weight of 24000 g/mol and a newer 
value of 15000 g/mol. In a quite recent publication Sheth et al. [39] report for the 
same system the appearance of appreciable amounts of polymer material at molecular 
weight of 1000 g/mol or lower in the gel permeation curve of the degraded sample. 
They indicate that the limiting degree of polymerization depends on the initial 
molecular weight distribution and is either much lower than previously reported 
or perhaps non-existent. 
The stresses encountered by a chain displaced with respect to a solid matrix can 
also be described utilizing the concept of the monomeric friction coefficient ~ 0 [25]. 
The implications of such an assumption are discussed in detail by Ferry [25] who 
also lists the numerical values of the monomeric friction coefficients for many high 
polymers. Naturally the coefficients strongly depend on temperature. But even if 
compared at corresponding temperature, e.g. at the individual glass transition tem-
peratures, the monomeric friction coefficients vary with the physical and chemical 
chain structure by 10 orders of magnitude. In the upper region one fInds the 
1740 Ns/m for Polymethylacrylate, the 19.5 Ns/m for Polyvinyl acetate, and the 
11.2 Ns/m for Polyvinyl chloride, each at the respective glass transition temperature 
[25]. This means that a PVC segment pulled at 80°C through a PVC matrix at a 
rate of 0.005 nm/s encounters a shearing force of 0.056 nN per monomeric unit. 
At lower temperatures the molecular friction coefficient increases essentially in pro-
portion to the intensity of the relaxation time spectrum H(r), the increase being 
about one to two orders of magnitude with every 10 K temperature difference [25]. 
If a PVC segment has a length of 2 L = 10 nm and is part of a PVC matrix strained 
at a rate of 0.001/ s at the glass transition temperature it experiences at the center 
an axial force of magnitude 1.1 nN. This force is about as large as that statically 
transferred upon extended PE chains by PE crystallites at room temperature. It 
may be repeated that the above estimate on the level of axial forces is based on the 
130 

III. Deexcitation of Chains 
assumption that in sample straining an extended chain segment is subjected to shear-
ing forces determined by the monomeric friction coefficients to and that the seg-
ment does not relieve axial stresses through conformational changes. Using the same 
assumptions one expects forces up to 206 nN for PMMA and up to 0.01 nN for PS 
each at the respective glass transition temperature and a strain rate of O.OOI/s. 
This estimate shows that in dynamic straining of glassy polymers very large 
axial forces can be transferred onto extended chain segments if the straining occurs 
at a temperature not higher than the glass transition temperature (PMMA) or some 
10K (PVC) to 20 K (PS) lower than that. These forces are sufficient to cause chain 
breakage. 
A loading mechanism not to be investigated in detail'in the con text of this mono-
graph is the straining of chain molecules through forces of inertia, e.g. through prop-
agating stress waves. Brittle thermoplastic materials (pS, SAN, PMMA) behave 
"classically" at velocities of uniaxial straining below 3 m/s or strain rates below 
50 S-1 [30]. In this region increase the strength properties and decrease the elonga-
tion with increasing strain rate. At strain rates between 50 and 66 S-1 a transition 
to stress wave-initiated fracture was observed which was accompanied by a tenfold 
reduction of the apparent load-carrying capability [30]. Skelton et al. [40] studied 
PA 6, PETP, and aromatic polyamide (Nomex). At ambient temperatures and in 
the range of loading rates between 0.01 and 140 S-1 *ese fibers also behaved clas-
sically. At -67°C and -196°C a decrease in strength with loading rate was observed 
at a loading rate of 30 S-I. 
III. Deexcitation of Chains 
The mechanisms of deexcitation of stressed chains have been discussed en passant 
while investigating bond strength and chain loading. These mechanisms are chain 
slip with respect to a surrounding matrix (enthalpy relaxation), change of chain con-
formation (entropy relaxation), or chain rupture. 
The retraction of a stressed chain through slippage leads to an exponential stress 
relaxation 
1/1 = 1/10 exp (-tIT). 
(5.42) 
If the slippage is adequately described by the monomeric friction coefficient 
to the relaxation time T will be given by: 
(5.43) 
where q is the chain cross-section. For a PVC chain at the glass transition temperature 
one obtains a relaxation time of 0.05 s. 
The effect of a change of conformation on the elastic chain energy had been 
demonstrated in Figure 5.1. The annihilation of 4 gauche conformations within a 
PE segment of 5 nm length corresponds to an increase in length of the segment of 
131 

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
0.25 nm. This increase of 5% will reduce the axial elastic forces acting on the chain 
by 0.05 E, i.e. by:::: 10 GN/m2 • In static straining this will correspond to complete 
unloading since the largest elastically transmitted forces yielded axial stresses of 
only up to 7.5 GN/m2 . The stress-biased change of chain conformation will lead, 
therefore, to a considerable reduction of axial stresses. The rate of conformational 
changes - even of high T g polymers and in a stress-free state - is sufficiently large 
and it will be further increased under stress [19, 31]. 
Conformational changes under stress have been observed repeatedly (e.g. 41-45). 
Gafurov and Nowak [41] studied the IR absorption of PE fibers in the range of 
1200 to 1400 cm- 1 . The extinctions offour bands (at 1370, 1350, 1305, and 
1270 cm- 1) observed there and related to the (wagging) vibrations of methylene 
groups in gauche conformations decreased with strain. The authors estimated that 
at 4% sample strain (which corresponded to much larger amorphous strains) the 
number of gauche isomers in the amorphous regions was decreased by 20%. 
Zhurkov et a1. [42] derived the degree of chain orientation from the dichroism 
of "deformed-IR bands" of PETP (cf. Chapter 8 I B and Fig~; they observed 
that for highly stressed segments an initial orientation with cos2e = 0.75 had turned 
into practically complete orientation (cos2e ~ 1.0). The problems posed by an ap-
plication of this method are discussed in detail by Read et a1. [43]. Bouriot [44] 
deduced from IR measurements a reversible cis-trans transformation of the ethylene 
glycol segment in PETP fibers under the effect of tensile stresses. In polyamide 66 
he observed a reversible increase of free (non-associated) NH groups and an increase 
in the average chain orientation with chain tension. 
Conformational changes due to straining of highly uniaxially oriented PETP 
films have been reported by Sikka et al. [45]. These changes have been inferred from 
a comparison of the IR spectrum of unloaded and loaded PETP films. Employing a 
highly sensitive Fourier Transform IR spectrometer Sikka noticed frequency shifts 
and splittings of the absorption bands in the subtraction spectra (stressed PETP IR 
spectrum minus unstressed PETP IR spectrum). At a stress of the order of 20% of 
the breaking stress those IR bands were affected which are assigned to the gauche 
conformations of the C-O bond next to the C-C bond. These conformations are 
most likely to exist in the amorphous regions of the highly uniaxially oriented semi-
crystalline polymer. In recent years numerous FTIR studies have amply confirmed 
stress-induced gauche-trans transitions in PETP and PBTP [64-68]. 
The third mechanism of releaSing axial stresses is the breakage of a chain through 
homolytic bond scission, ionic decomposition or degrading chemical reactions. 
It is assumed that chain scission is a thermo-mechanically activated process. A 
chain segment containing nc weakest bonds of energy Uo, and carrying at its ends 
a constant stress 1/10 will, on the average, break after time Tc. One refers to I/Ic as the 
time-dependent strength of a chain segment: 
(5.44) 
The quantities Wo and {3 have been defined as bond vibration frequency and 
activation volume for bond scission respectively [32]. A 5 nm PA 6 segment, for 
instance, at room temperature, has an instantaneous strength of 20 GN/m2 (taking 
Uo = 188 kJ/mol, Wo = 1012 S-I, nc = 12, Tc = 4 s, (3 = 5.53 . 10-6 m3/mol). If in 
132 

III. Deexcitation of Chains 
straining a segment, a stress of 20 GN/m2 is maintained for a period of 4 s the seg-
ment has a probability of failure of 1 - l/e = 63%. A stress of 20 GN/m2 is equivalent 
to a force of ~ 4 nN acting on a chain in the direction of its axis. For PE Boudreaux 
[11] has calculated breaking forces of 3.3. nN/ chain. In view of the different interpre-
tations found in the literature concerning the significance of wo, {3, and even Uo the 
assumptions made in deriving Eq. (5.44) will briefly be discussed. 
A chain in thermal contact with its surrounding can be represented by a system 
of coupled oscillators. The degree of excitation of individual oscillators (modes of 
vibration) is statistically changing. In the absence of external mechanical forces 
chain scission at a C-C bond will occur whenever an oscillator representing a C-C 
stretch vibration becomes excited beyond a critical level, Uo, the "strength" of the 
C-C bond. In Figure 4.1 the potential energy scheme was given illustrating different 
states of vibrational energy, the bond strength Uo, and the dissociation energy D. 
One is interested in the rate of dissociation events of oscillators activated beyond 
Uo· 
To evaluate this problem it will be assumed that Boltzmann statistics can be 
applied to the system of, say, s oscillators representing the C-C stretch vibrations 
within a volume element of the polymer. The fraction of energy states in which this 
system s will have a total energy level Er = re is proportional to the degeneracy gr 
of the energy level Er and the Boltzmann factor exp (-Er/RT). (e is the - constant-
spacing between oscillator energy levels). The partition function, therefore, will be 
given by: 
Qt = ~ gr exp (-Er/RT). 
(5.45) 
r 
The number of states in which at least one oscillator has an energy Ej ;;:;. Uo is 
given by Qa : 
Qa = ~ & exp [-(Er + Uo)/RT]. 
(5.46) 
r 
For thermodynamic equilibrium within the volume element comprising s os-
cillators the fraction K+ of activated states, i.e. states with Ej ;;:;. Uo, is given by: 
(5.47) 
This can be approximated [331 if r ~ 1 by: 
(5.48) 
where gm is the degeneracy of the most probably energy level. Expressing gm by 
the entropy S according to: 
one obtains 
K+ = exp(-Uo/RT) exp ~S/R 
(5.49) 
(5.50) 
133 

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
which is identical with the relation Qn K+ = - Ll p+ IRT. The rate of dissociation, 
kb' then follows from K+ [34]: 
kT 
+ 
kT 
kb = K h K = K h exp (-Vo/RT) exp LlS/R 
(5.51) 
where K is the transmission constant which indicates how many of the activated 
complexes actually disintegrate. By combining all front factors and exp LlS/R one 
may rewrite this equation as: 
kb = Wo exp (-Vo/RT). 
(5.52) 
The quantity Wo is proportional to T; this dependency is generally negligible 
against the T-dependency caused by the exponential term. 
The rate kc for the breakage of one out of nc equal and independent bonds is 
nc times the rate kb for the breakage of an individual bond. If the bonds are not 
independent it will mean that more than one oscillator has to acquire enough vi-
brational energy for dissociation. Depending on the coupling such a cooperative 
region may count some 5 or more oscillators [35]. In this case an experimentally 
determined term Vo stands for the total vibrational energy required by all (coupled) 
atoms which are involved in one chain rupture event. This could mean that the poten-
tial barrier between neighboring sites of an uncoupled atom is much less than Vo. 
This meaning of Vo has to be kept in mind if the numerical value Vo is being com-
pared with other activation energies. 
Another problem in connection with Vo arises from the fact that in a kinetic 
experiment such as the determination of the rate of chain scission one derives the 
bond strength Vo, that is the maximum of the potential barrier (cf. Pig. 4.1). In 
calorimetric measurements the reaction enthalpy (dissociation energy D) is deter-
mined. 
By application of external forces the free energy of the activated state is changed 
with respect to the ground state. One may say that Ll p+ has to be replaced by 
Ll P+ + Ll Pext ' The term Ll Pext will be some function f of the stress 1/1 which is act-
ing on the molecular chain along its axis; Equation (5.52) then becomes: 
k = n w exp _ Vo + f(l/I) 
ceO 
RT' 
(5.53) 
The form of f is subject to discussion [35-37]. Linear and quadratic relation-
ships have been proposed. A linear relationship follows if one assumes that the force 
acting on a particular chain is not changed by the displacement of the chain under 
action of the force (comparable to a dead weight loading). The correction term f (1/1) 
will be quadratic in 1/1 if the stored elastic energy within a small chain section to 
either side of the point of chain scission is thOUght to be responsible for the rate 
of chain fracture. Prom the Morse potential one obtains a difference of square root 
expressions which, however, results in an almost linear relationship between force and 
activation energy in the force region of interest [36]. The effect of a linear stress 
potential on the intramolecular binding energy is shown in Pigure 5.10.

bond 
Some information concerning the form of f( 1/1) and the relation between molec-
ular stress 1/1 and macroscopic stress a has been obtained by Zhurkov, Vettegren 
et al. [37, 32]. These authors have studied the effect of macroscopic stress a on in-
frared absorption of oriented polymers. The frequencies of skeleton vibrations of 
polymer molecules show the effect of external axial forces on molecular binding 
force-constants. The shift and change of shape of suitable infrared absorption bands 
should reveal, therefore, the intensity and distribution of actual molecular stresses 
1/1. Experiments carried out with polypropylene and polyamide 6 have shown that 
for a stressed sample the maximum of the investigated absorption band decreases 
slightly and shifts towards lower frequencies [37, 32]. In addition a low frequency 
tail of the absorption band appears. In agreement with existing structural models 
the authors interpreted their results in assigning the shifted symmetrical part of the 
absorption band to the crystalline phase of the sample, the low frequency tail to 
the amorphous phase. The shift of the symmetrical part of the absorption band, 
~ V8 , turned out to be linear with macroscopic stress in all performed experiments: 
(5.54) 
Following a theory of Bernstein [38] the shift of the stretching frequency of 
a bond can be related to a shift in dissociation energy D of the same bond: 
(5.55) 
135 

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
Since ~ vs ~ 1'0 one may substitute 1'5 -
v~ by ~ vs . 2 vo. A consequence of 
this condition is that also (1'5 -
v~) is proportional to G. The choice of v or 1'2 in 
Eq. (5.54) only affects Q, not the power of G. If one further· assumes that the activa-
tion energy Vo is changed by a similar amount as Do one obtains: 
21'0 
Va = Vo - -c-
Q G. 
(5.56) 
In order to derive the form of f( I/J) the relation between G and I/J for oriented 
crystalline phases has to be established. According to experimental and theoretical 
evidence it is assumed that a condition of homogeneous stress exists within the 
crystalline layers of a regular sandwich structure and that I/J is proportional to G. 
Equation (5.56) thus yields that the activation energy for scission of an oriented 
chain molecule is linearly decreased by stresses acting upon this molecule. Equation 
(5.53) with (5.56) may be written as: 
kc = nc Wo exp [(-Vo + (j I/J)/RT] 
(5.57) 
which is equivalent to Eq. (5.44). It is believed that the rate of fracture of chains 
all subjected to the same local stress I/J can correctly be described by Eq. (5.57). 
There are other treatments of coupled anharmonic oscillators [56, 57]. It seems, 
however, as if the boundary conditions chosen in the first model [56] are incom-
patible with the situation of overstressed chains_ The skeleton atoms within such 
chains are in rapid vibration and it has to be born in mind that mechanical stresses 
and thermal motion contribute to the bond scission energy_ For PA6 at room tem-
perature an activation energy of 188 kJ/mol- 1 is observed to which the term (ji/J con-
tributes 111 kJ/moI- 1 (see also Chapter 7)_ The remaining 77 kJ/mor l are coming 
from the fluctuating thermal energy (this is more than 60 times the average thermal 
energy per degree of freedom at that temperature). Just before scis~on of a PA6 seg-
ment at a stress of 20 GN/m-2 the segment, which has an axial stiffness of 200 
GlfU-2 , is evidently strained by 10%. An instant later one bond is subject to a con-
centration of fluctuating thermal energy. That bond deforms by notable amounts 
(in PE for instance by the 35% bond fracture strain indicated by Boudreaux [11]). As 
discussed in detail by Kausch [22] and Melker [57] the yielding of one bond is ac-
companied by an in-phase motion of the adjacent bonds in outward direction. Thus, 
it may be retained that in a stretched PA6 segment in the instant of rupture all main 
chain bonds except the failing one are equally strained by - 10%; segment strains of 
- 35% will not be supported. 
On the basis of the foregoing considerations the response of two chains of dif-
ferent conformation to axial stresses has been evaluated in Figure 5.11. An extended 
chain segment (L = Lo) stretches elastically up to the time-dependent fracture stress. 
The calculations have been carried out employing a modulus of elasticity for the 
polyamide 6 chain of 200 GN/m2 • As indicated in Table 5.3 it is still open to dis-
cussion whether this value can be unambiguously accepted. The times to fracture 
have been calculated from Eq. (5.57) for a segment comprising 12 bonds of low 
strength (Vo = 188 kJ /mol). The partially extended chain (L = 1.1 Lo) contains 
136

initially four kinks (8 gauche bonds). It responds in region A (Fig. 5.11) mostly by 
the hindered rotation of its gauche bonds, which, in this region, accounts for 90% 
of the axial deformation. The resulting combined modulus amounts to 22 GN/m2 . 
If geometrically possible a transition to the fully extended conformation will occur 
in region B. Region C represents the energy elastic straining of the then extended 
chain segment oflength 1.1 Lo. 
The degradation of chains through ionic decomposition or chemical reactions 
under stress will be discussed where appropriate in the following chapters.

scission in both solvents showed a weak negative activation energy which could only be 
partially accounted for by a change in solvent viscosity with temperature. Below the 0-
temperature in dekalin solutions an abrupt decrease in chain scission was recorded after phase 
separation. Formation of interchain aggregates below the O-point gave rise to a transient 
topological network. These physical crossJinks prevented the macromolecule from being ful-
ly stretched under flow and exerted a protective effect by lowering the local axial stress act-
ing on the chain. Secondly the authors investigated the effect of the form of the flow field 
(laminar or turbulent regime) on the degradation. They found that chain scission in laminar 
flow was appreciable only for exceptionally large molecules (Mw > 107 g mol-I) in a 
viscous solvent; otherwise it was provoked by the onset of turbulence in flow.

The action of axial tensile forces on a molecular bond RI-R2 results in a decrease 
of the apparent binding energy of the bond and thus in an increase of the probability 
for bond scission. If the reduction of the apparent binding energy is sizeable the 
mechanical action may be considered as the main cause of chain destruction. In as 
much as the scission of a chain molecule into organic radicals and the resulting ap-
pearance of unpaired free electrons is governed by mechanical forces a study of 
radical formation and of radical reactions will reveal information on the forces acting 
on a chain at a molecular level. The method of investigating free radicals by para-
magnetic resonance techniques has been highly developed during the last thirty years 
[1,2]. Since then it was successfully applied to elucidate the mechanism of the for-
mation of free radicals in chemical reactions and under irradiation of visible and 
ultraviolet light, of x- and '}'-rays, and of particles [1.3]. Also the value of the spec-
troscopic splitting factor g, the magnetic surrounding of the unpaired free electron 
spin, and the structure of the free radical have been studied. In all these cases the free 
electron spin acts as a probe, which, at least temporarily, is attached to a certain 
molecule, takes part in the motion of the molecule, and interacts with the surround-
ing magnetic field. 
In investigations of the deformation and fracture of high polymer solids [4-73] by 
electron paramagnetic resonance techniques (EPR) similar experimental problems 
arise as during the above mentioned applications of EPR: 
1. Interpretation of the form of the observed spectra, i.e. determination of the 
position of the free electron within the molecule. 
141 

6. Identification of ESR Spectra of Mechanically Formed Free Radicals 
2. Measurement of spectrum intensity, i.e. deterqrination of the number of free 
electrons. 
3. Observation of the changes displayed by the EPR signal and elucidation of the 
nature and kinetics of radical reactions. 
From these primary data, information is sought to obtain with respect to the 
deformation behavior of chain molecules, their scission and their role in fracture 
initiation. 
In the following a brief description of EPR spectroscopy will be given in order 
to provide an understanding of the main experimental technique which is used in 
these investigations. Subsequently reactions, identification, and concentration of 
mechanically formed free radicals will be discussed. 
II. EPR Technique 
A. Principles 
The EPR spectroscopy of free electrons is based on the paramagnetism of free electron 
spins. For this reason one also speaks of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. 
Electrons on fully occupied molecular orbitals generally do not give rise to a magnetic 
moment since - according to the Pauli principle - pairwise spins compensate each 
other. If, however, a bond is broken through homolytic scission, then free radicals 
with impaired electron spins are formed which are detectable. A free electron has the 
magnetic moment J1 given by 
J1 = g[3s 
(6.1) 
where g is the spectroscopic splitting factor, [3 is the Bohr magneton, and s is the 
spin vector. In a magnetic field H the spin may assume one of two positions (spin 
quantum numbers m being either + 1/2 or - 1/2). The energy difference between 
these two states is 
.1E = g[3H. 
(6.2) 
The populations of the two energy levels at equilibrium are given by Boltzmann 
statistics which indicate that more of the free electrons will normally reside in the 
- 1/2 "ground state". However, when electromagnetic energy of an appropriate 
(microwave) frequency v is supplied, an electron can be "pumped" to the higher 
+ 1/2 state. The resonance condition is fulfilled when hv is just equal to the energy 
difference between the two levels: 
.1 E = h v = g[3 Hres 
(6.3) 
where h is Planck's constant. In resonance, microwave energy is absorbed by the 
resonating sample if the upper energy level is constantly depopulated by thermal 
interaction between the spins and the molecular lattice. Generally the microwave 
142 

II. EPR Technique 
frequency employed by commercially available ESR spectrometers is fixed (at about 
9.5 GHz) and the magnetic field is swept through the resonance (at about 3200 Oe). 
B_ Hyperfine Structure of ESR Spectra 
Since the "free" electrons are attached to molecules, they will sense not only the 
presence of the applied external magnetic field but will show magnetic interactions 
with nuclei of surrounding atoms which have a magnetic moment. These interactions 
give rise to the "splitting" that can be used to identify particular radicals. Equa-
tion (6.3) is accordingly transformed into 
n 
Hres = hv/g(3 -
~ (Ai + Bi) mli· 
(6.4) 
i=1 
Here mn is the spin quantum number of the interacting nucleus i, Ai the iso-
tropic part of the magnetic coupling between radical electron and nucleus i, and 
Bi the anisotropic part which depends on the orientation of the radical within the 
external magnetic field. 
For the important class of hydrocarbon radicals, B is different from zero only for 
the a-protons, i.e. for the nuclei of hydrogen atoms directly bound to the radical 
C atom. In well ordered systems (highly oriented polymers, single crystals) these 
radicals do have a strongly orientation dependent hyperfme structure. 
In the Simplest case of no interaction (A = 0, B = 0) there will be one line with 
its center at Hres. If only one proton interacts isotropically (B = 0) with the radical 
electron then the spectrum will show two lines displaced from Hres by ±A. If two 
equivalent nuclei interact with the electron then mI can assume the values + 1, 0, 
and -1 so that a triplet of lines appears with distances of -A, 0, and +A from the 
center respectively. Since the state with mI = 0 appears twice as often as the other 
ones the individual resonance lines have intensities as 1: 2: 1. It may generally be said 
that n equivalent protons give rise to a spectrum with (n + 1) lines which show an 
intensity distribution given by the binomial coefficients of exponent n. For illustra-
tion Figure 6.1 shows the spectra of alkyl radicals -CH2-CH-CH2 - in highly 
(3 
(3 
oriented polyethylene monofilaments which were produced by irradiation with fast 
electrons [37]. In one orientation (fiber axis parallel to H, upper spectrum) the total 
splitting parameter (A + B) of the a-protons is just equal to the isotropic parameter 
of the 4 equivalent (3-protons. Therefore, a spectrum is observed which might be 
caused by 5 equivalent protons, i.e. a sextet with intensities 1 : 5 : 10 : 10 : 5 : 1 (some 
background including the small center line belongs to a second radical present within 
the sample). In the case of a perpendicular arrangement of fiber axis and magnetic 
field the spectrum shown in the lower portion of Figure 6.1 is observed. Now the 
Q- and (3-protons have different splitting parameters and a quintet of lines appears 
due to 4 equivalent (3-protons with each quintet line split into a doublet by the 
a-proton. In all 10 lines result with intensity ratios of 1: 1 :4:4:6:6:4:4: 1: 1:. Again 
the small background of a superimposed second spectrum is observed. The orienta-

tion dependency of the hyperfine structure of hydrocarbon radicals offers the op-
portunity to study the orientation of radical carrying chains. 
c. Number of Spins 
In most spectrometers lines are recorded which are the ftrst derivative of the energy 
absorption peaks with respect to the magnetic fteld Bo. It is the plot of these ftrst 
derivates that is usually called the ESR spectrum. 
The total microwave energy absorption can be obtained by double integration 
of the ESR spectrum. In the absence of saturation effects the total power absorbed, 
1(00), depends upon the number of spins No, the intensity of the oscillating magnetic 
(microwave) field HI, and the frequency v according to 
(6.5) 
To calculate absolute intensities of spins usually comparison of the unknown 
intensity No is made with a standard sample with a known concentration Ns of spins 
[l]. Frequently a solution of the stable free radicall ,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl 
(DPPH) in benzene is used as standard radical. If the "unknown" spectrum is sym-
144 

III. Reactions and Means of Identification 
metrical and narrow and the experimental conditions (sample size and shape, con-
ditions of spectrometer operation) are the same in both cases the relation 
(6.6) 
is valid where Ns and Is (00) refer to the standard sample. If lines of identical shape 
and width are compared it is sufficient to measure the peak height h of the first 
derivative. The numbers Nl and N2 of unpaired electrons causing these peak heights 
are then related by: 
(6.7) 
For most cases of stress induced free radical formation this relation has been 
used for evaluation of time-dependent intensities. 
The number of free radicals necessary for detectable peak heights depends on 
the line shape and the effective volume of the spectrometer cavity. At the time 
covered by the referenced investigations (1960-1976) the lower limit of detectabili-
ty of polymer radicals in the solid state can be given as 1013 spins/ cm3 . 
It may be mentioned that the number of free radicals present in a liquid or at 
the surface of a solid can also be determined by a non-spectroscopic method. This 
method exploits the color changes associated with the consumption of free radicals 
from a test solution e.g. of DPPH [39]. It should be emphasized again that great 
caution must be exercised in comparing absolute values of free radical concentra-
tions obtained from differently shaped samples and/or in different cavities. Accord-
ing to general experience deviations of up to a factor of 2 must be expected. 
III. Reactions and Means of Identification 
The assignment of the specific peaks to specific types of free radicals is not always 
obvious; it sometimes involves highly intriguing techniques and the knowledge of 
related spectra and of chemical reactions to be expected [64, 67]. The main obstacles 
to be overcome are the broad line widths of resonance lines from solid specimens 
and the high rate of many radical reactions. It is evident that a large line width often 
prevents an effective resolution of nuclear hyperfine structure. The so-called 
"5 + 4 line" spectrum of mechanically destroyed methacrylic polymers [4] is an 
example of a spectrum which had only been identified after comparison with the 
16-line-spectrum of an aqueous solution of the polymerization radical of methacrylic 
acid. Thus it was learned that the former spectrum is the unresolved form of the latter 
and has to be assigned t,6 the same radical [40]. 
The difficulties in identifying an observed spectrum are well illustrated by the 
spectrum of 6 polyamide shown in Figure 6.2. It was obtained after stretching a fiber 
sample at room temperature in the ESR cavity by an automatic servo-control system 
to the point of radical detection, then scanning the magnetic field from 3071 to 
3571 Oersted (mean, 3321 Oe) at 9.433 GHz and a time constant of 0.5 second.

6. Identification of ESR Spectra of Mechanically Formed Free Radicals 
Fig. 6.2. Apparent 5-line spectrum 
as obtained after stretching of a 
bundle of 6 polyamide fibers at 
room temperature in an ESR cavity. 
This apparent 5-line spectrum is obtained, under exclusion of oxygen, when highly 
stressed fibers or finely ground or milled material are investigated at room tempera-
ture [41]. A similar spectrum is observed after 'Y or electron irradiation of PA 6 
[42,43]. Two different interpretations of this 5-line spectrum have been given. Graves 
and Ormerod [42] suggested that an apparent quartet coming from the radical 
-CH2 -CO-NH-CH-CH2 - (radical I) is superimposed by a singlet which may be 
due to -CH2 -CHO-NH-CH2 - (II). Kashiwagi [43] deduced, after comparison with 
radicals from polyurea and succinamide, that the apparent 5-line spectrum from 
6 polyamide and the 6-line spectra from 610, 66 and 57 polyamides are a triplet of 
doublets stemming from the radical I. It is, therefore, generally concluded that the 
radicals observed at room temperature in mechanically degraded polyamide material 
are mainly of type I, superimposed to a varying degree by a component of type II. 
The radicals I are secondary chain radicals which can only have been produced by 
the reaction of a hydrogen from a methylene group with an other - a primary -
radical. Since the secondary radicals are reaction products they give no direct in-
formation on the nature and location of the primary process of mechanical degrada-
tion of the above solids. 
The appearance of free radicals in the process of mechanical degradation reveals 
conclusively that under the action of local mechanical forces main chains have been 
broken and that the breakage of a main chain bond has led to the formation of a 
chain end free radical at either side of the broken bond. Knowledge of these facts 
can already be employed to study the relation between environmental parameters 
and the rate of chain scission. The kinetics of chain scission and its possible role in 
fracture initiation is investigated in detail in Chapters 7 and 8. Apart from the inten-
sity which gives a quantitative measure of chain scission the form of free radical 
spectra has been used to determine the location of primary and secondary radicals 
within the molecule [64] and within morphological units (within crystals, on crys-
tal surfaces, in amorphous regions). 
If degradation and ESR investigation of a sample are carried out at liquid nitrogen 
temperature, the rate of radical reactions is slowed down sufficiently and a direct 
observation of the primary radicals produced by mechanical degradation becomes 
146 

IV. Assignment of Spectra 
possible. In a thorough investigation Zakrevskii, Tomashevskii, and Baptizmanskii 
[10] have cleared up the scheme of radical reactions for 6 polyamide (caprolactam, 
capron). At 77 K they observed a complex spectrum showing the hyperfine struc-
ture of a sextet superimposed on a triplet. From the distance between the different 
lines of the sextet (splitting) and their intensity ratios the above authors established 
the presence of the radical R-CH2 -CH2 (III). This radical will form after rupture 
of any of the bonds 1 to 6 in the caprolactam unit: 
If the superimposed sextet is subtracted from the original spectrum a triplet 
remains which must be due to a scission product of the above molecule. The ex-
clusive breakage of bonds 3 and 4 can be ruled out immediately since it would only 
lead to radicals of type III. Breakage of bonds 6 and 7 was eliminated after compari-
son with capron deuterated in the imino groups; breakage of bond 1 would not lead 
to a radical with a triplet spectrum. After inspection of all other possibilities, in-
cluding secondary radicals, there remain as likely scission points only the bonds 
2 and 5. After having studied 0: and € methyl substituted caprolactam the authors 
[10] finally were able to state that in a stressed 6 polyamide molecule both the bonds 
2 and 5 do break and with equal probability. The rupture of a PA 6 molecule, there-
fore, leads to three primary radicals: 
-CH2-CH2 (III, 50%), -NH-CH2 (IV, 25%) and -CO-CH2 (V, 25%). 
Upon slowly rising the temperature from 77 K radical III begins to disappear 
leaving at 120 K only IV and V. At higher temperatures IV and V are gradually trans-
formed into I which prevails above 240 K. Within the experimental limits mentioned 
above with respect to cOmparing the absolute numbers of radicals of different species 
there seems to be no loss of radicals during conversion of III, N, and V into radical!. 
In the following Sections and Tables the experimental conditions are reported 
which were employed during mechanical production and ESR investigation of free 
radicals. The assignments of primary and/or secondary radicals are given. For a dis-
cussion of the nature and kinetics of possible transfer reactions the reader is referred 
to the comprehensive reviews of Rimby et al. [2] and of Sohma et al. [64] and to the 
work of BartoS' and TiIlo [73]. Special problems in view of polymer morphology and 
of the reduction of chain strengths will be treated in Chapters 7 and 8. 
IV. Assignment of Spectra 
A. Free Radicals in Ground High Polymers 
The appearance of macroradicals in mechanically destroyed polymers was first shown 
in 1959 [4-6]. Since then, fairly systematically natural and synthetic organic ma-
terials have been investigated with respect to formation of free radicals in mechanical 
147 

6. Identification of ESR Spectra of Mechanically Formed Free Radicals 
degradation (see for instance the monograph by Ranby and Rabek [2] and the review 
papers by Butyagin et al. [7], Kausch [8], and Sohmaetal. [641). Owing to the original-
ly limited sensitivity of ESR-spectrometers, the first experiments have been carried 
out with crushed polymers which have a high ratio of fracture surface to volume and, 
therefore, a comparatively large ESR signal. 
The experimental equipment is described by various authors (referenced in 2). 
Grinding, milling, cutting or crushing of the polymer sample is done in vibration mills 
or mortars, under inert atmosphere, in vacuo, or in liquid nitrogen. Magnetic drills 
have been reported by which the shavings or grindings are produced within a sealed 
glass tube immediately at the ESR-cavity. Most equipment used in these experiments 
allows for a control of the gaseous environment and for temperature control from 
liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) to above room temperature. 
In Table 6.1 the presently available details of sample preparation (crushing tech-
nique, temperature, environment), the treatment of the crushed sample, the tem-
peratures at which the ESR-spectra were taken, and the assignments of the observed 
spectra to primary and/or secondary free radicals are listed for 39 different homopoly-
mers. As opposed to the numerous studies on homopolymers, little work has been 
done on random or block copolymers: Lazar and SZQCS [28] investigated random, 
block, and graft copolymers of methylmethacrylate (MMA) and styrene (S). They 
found in a degraded mixture of equal parts MMA and S homopolymers equal concen-
trations of MMA and S radicals. In a random copolymer (MMA: S = 1 : 1) the styrene 
radical prevailed clearly. DeVries et al. [33] had investigated a ground styrene-buta-
diene block copolymer. By comparison with the ESR signals of ground pure BR and 
PS they concluded that grinding of the block copolymer leads preferentially to rup-
ture within the butadiene phase. 
The common result of practically all of the reported ESR work [4-36] on com-
minuted polymers is that the mechanical action leads to the severance of a main 
chain bond and to the formation of chain end radicals as primary radicals. The only 
exception to this rule are the substituted polydimethylsiloxanes (No. 32 to 35) where 
there is a strong indication that the Si-O bond decomposes by an ionic mechanism 
rather than by homolytic bond scission [36]. In no case free radicals are produced 
by a mechanical stripping off of sidegroups or -atoms from the main chain. For this 
to occur stresses are required which simply cannot be transmitted onto the relatively 
small sidegroups present in the materials listed in Table 6.1. In fact the attempted 
degradation of low molecular weight compounds (paraffins, ethanol, benzene) with 
a molecular weight equal to or larger than that of those sidegroups failed, although 
mechanical means identical to those used successfully for macromolecules had been 
employed [13, 14, 62]. 
The recent claims of Sakaguchi et al. [74], to have traced ionic fracture products 
in solid PP through ion transfer to tetracyano ethylene (TeNE), seem as yet to be 
inconclusive. 
B. Free Radicals in Tensile Specimens 
Mechanical degradation which leads to formation of free radicals can be achieved 
in various ways but generally two types of samples are being used in experiment: 
148 

IV. Assignment of Spectra 
powders of finely ground polymers as discussed above or uniaxially stressed fibers, 
monofilaments, or strips of films. In samples of the first type all molecular fracture 
processes are completed before the ESR investigation begins. These samples can 
primarily be used to obtain information on the nature and absolute number of free 
radicals present within the degraded polymer. 
Samples of the second type, tensile specimens, are in principle suitable for study-
ing the time-dependent formation of free radicals and their effect on strength and on 
other macroscopic properties. It can be said a priori that the free radical intensities 
of tensile specimens - be it before or after rupture - will be very much lower than 
the intensities found in fmely ground polymers with fracture surfaces of several 
thousand cm2/g. Even with the increased sensitivity of presently available ESR spec-
trometers the investigation of stressed samples is limited to a few with favourable 
properties. The only experiments leading to a successfull investigation of time-
dependent formation of free radicals were carried out with highly oriented, semi-
crystalline fibers like 6 and 66 polyamide, polyoxamides, polyethylene, polyethylene 
terephthalate, natural silk Kevlar®, or with preoriented rubbers (natural rubber, poly-
chloroprene) near liquid nitrogen temperatures. 
In Table 6.2 experimental conditions and types of radicals observed are listed. 
The experimental equipment necessary for stressing fibers within the resonant 
cavity has been extensively reviewed by Rimby et al. [2]. It is quite more elaborate 
than that for investigating powders, although the requirements for controlled tem-
perature and atmosphere are nearly the same. Lever systems or servo-controlled 
electric or hydraulic loading systems have been reported [29,37,44,46] through 
which programmed load or strain functions can be applied to bundles of fibers (or 
other tensile specimens) in the resonant cavity. The technique today applied through-
out had been developed by Becht [46] in Darmstadt, the principle is shown in Figure 
6.3. The stretching of the tensile specimens necessarily has to be carried out in that 
suspension

Fig. 6.3. Device of straining fiber bun-
dles within the resonant cavity as origi-
nally developed by Becht (46); the ten-
sile specimens consist of several thousand 
filaments; within the metal sleeves these 
maments are glued to each other and to 
the metal sleeve by an epoxy resin; after 
curing about 40% of the fibers outside 
the sleeves are removed in order to as-
sure a homogeneous stress application 
to the remaining fibers which traverse the 
resonant cavity (courtesy Deutsches 
Kunststoffinstitut, Darmstadt)

6. Identification of ESR Spectra of Mechanically Formed Free Radicals 
temperature regime within which free radical spectra can be well observed. For 
thermoplastic fibers this meant 200 to 320 K; for pre oriented rubbers ambient tem-
peratures of93 to 123 K were necessary. At these temperatures the primary free rad-
icals are sufficiently mobile to react rapidly with atom groups of the same or other 
chain molecules, with absorbed gases, or with additives or impurities acting as rad-
ical traps. For this reason the observed free radicals listed in Table 6-.2 are secondary 
radicals - with the only exception of the highly stable primary radical of poly-p-
(hydroxyethoxy) benzoic acid (PEOB) studied by Nagamura and Takayanagi [60]. 
The secondary radicals - if sufficiently resolved - have been assigned to either 
peroxy radicals (R-O-O), main chain radicals (R-CH-R), stabilizers or unknown 
impurities [55,62], or deliberately added radical traps as, for instance chloranyl 
[61,75].

Historically, the first ESR experiments with mechanically produced free radicals 
have been made in the Ioffe-Institute in Leningrad in 1959 [1] with ground or milled 
polymers, the samples being investigated after completion of the fracture process. 
To elucidate the effect of structural or environmental parameters on the kinetics of 
stress-induced free radical formation it is necessary to study - by ESR - highly 
stressed chains during the loading process. As outlined in Chapter 5 a notable energy 
elastic straining of a chain can only be achieved if the chain cannot relieve stresses 
internally by a change of conformation or externally by slippage against the field 
exerting the uniaxial forces. Vice versa the mechanical scission of a chain must be 
taken as an indication that at the time of chain rupture axial stresses l/I equal to the 
chain strength l/I c had not only been reached but also maintained during the average 
lifetime period T c of the chain segment. 
165 

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
In view of the fact that the slippage of chains, microfibrils, or fibrils reduces or 
prevents the mechanical scission of chains, highly oriented thermoplastic fibers with 
little potential for plastic deformation are the most suitable objects for a study of 
chain scission kinetics. ESR investigations using fibers of polyamide 6, 66, and 12, 
PE, PP, PETP and of other materials have been carried out in a limited number of 
laboratories, at first in the USSR, later in the USA, Germany, Great Britain, and 
Japan (see Table 6.2). Practically all researchers worked with highly oriented mono-
filaments, stacks of strips, or mostly with commercial yarns made up of a few hun-
dred filaments each having a diameter of about 20 Mm. As discussed in Chapter 2 the 
filaments consist of fibrils and these in turn of microfibrils with a diameter of 20 
to 40 nm. The experimental set-up allowing uniaxial straining of these samples under 
controlled atmosphere and directly within the ESR cavity has been described and 
referenced in Chapter 6, Section IV B. It has also been seen that the primary radicals 
formed in tensile straining can - with one exception - be assigned to the breakage 
of main chains. In the following discussion, concentrations of secondary - rather 
than of primary - radicals are usually analyzed. It can be understood that the con-
version factor from the number of primary radicals to the number of secondary radi-
cals is constant. Whether it is close to unity will have to be discussed later in more 
detail. 
If a semicrystalline microfibril is subjected to stresses, the resulting deformation 
will be non-homogeneous at the molecular level. The bulk of the deformation will 
be born by the amorphous regions. As discussed in Chapter 5 the largest stresses are 
transferred upon extended chain segments which share the strain impartyd onto an 
amorphous region. The stress induced scission of chains must, therefore, be ex-
pected to occur within the amorphous regions. 
Becht and Fischer [2] have demonstrated directly that free radicals are formed· 
in the amorphous regions. These authors observed that polycaprolactam samples 
swollen in methacrylic acid did not show in subsequent stressing the usual ESR 
spectrum of the polyamide radical but the polymerization radical of the methacrylic 
acid. Based on the logical assumption that only amorphous regions had been swollen 
it was proved, therefore, that free radicals had formed in the amorphous regions 
only. Verma et al. [3] reached at the same repeatedly confirmed conclusion studying 
irradiation-produced radicals in semicrystalline polymers. Those radicals had been 
created under 'Y-irradiation within the whole volume of a PA 66 film i.e. as well with-
in amorphous as within crystalline regions. At room temperature Verma observed -
depending on sample orientation within the ESR cavity - a three, four, or six line 
spectrum. He assigned the pronounced anisotropy of the spectrum to the fact that 
the majority of the remaining radicals is located in the well oriented crystalline blocks. 
If the free radicals were introduced into the same material by stretching, no conspi-
cuous anisotropy of the ESR spectrum could be observed. In this case the radicals 
were obviously located in sites showing rather small local chain orientation. In 
terms of fiber morphology the chain scission events must have taken place, there-
fore, in the amorphous regions between the crystal lamellae within the microfibrils, 
at microfibril surfaces, or in interfibrillar regions (Fig. 2.6). The question of the loca-
tion of chain scission points will be touched upon repeatedly within this chapter. 
At first the phenomenology of free radical production in preoriented yarns will 
be discussed taking 6 and 66 polyamide as examples. In constant load rate tests a 
166 

" I. Radical Formation in Thermoplastics 
very steep increase in concentration of fairly stable secondary radicals is observed 
in a strain regime of between 8% and rupture strain (16 to 25%) which corresponds 
to a stress regime of between 500 and 900 MN/m2 (Fig. 7.1). Load rate tests are a 
suitable means to demonstrate the effect of mechanical action on radical formation 
and accumulation, but they are not sufficient to discriminate between the simulta-
neous effects of stress, strain, and time on the rate of radical formation. From con-
stant load tests it was learned that, under constant load, the rate of radical forma-
tion decreases quite rapidly whereas the amount of radicals formed in virgin samples 
reaches a constant equilibrium value (Fig. 7.2). If a sample is strained repeatedly to 
a strain level e 1 then free radicals will be formed, i.e. chains will break, only during 
the first straining cycle. If, however, in subsequent straining the level el is exceeded, 
more chains will be seen to break. In a step-strain test the radical popUlation increases 
stepwise (Figs. 7.3 and 7.4).

In the first paper on this subject [7] Kausch and Becht gave a detailed discussion 
of the notable fact that within each strain step the radical concentration increases 
concurrently with a decrease of the macroscopic tensile stress. The conclusion was 
drawn that the local molecular stresses are unevenly distributed. They are not simply 
a constant multiple of the macroscopic stresses. The chain segments breaking to-
wards the end of a strain interval quite obviously do not participate in the macro-

lifetime by two orders of magnitude and virtually stops the chain scission process). 
It was furthermore concluded that the microfibrils do not unload through slippage 
and that the lateral rigidity of the crystal blocks within the sandwich·structured 
microfibrils must be large enough so as to permit the build-up of large stress concen-
trations. If the lateral rigidity of the crystal blocks were insufficient the fibril would 
break up into subrnicrofibrils. This situation is schematically shown by Figure 7.5. The

central diagram represents the alledged submicrofibrillar structure within an un-
stressed microfibril. If the crystal blocks break up while being strained the tensile stresses 
in every part of the structure will equilibrate and be equal to the external stress 
(right hand side). The external stresses are, as one knows from Chapters 1 and 5 al-
ways much smaller than the chain strength. If, however, the layered structure is also 
preserved at large strains stresses proportional to local strain and tensile modulus Ej 
of the amorphous subregions can be exerted (left hand side of Fig. 7.5). This means 
that within a subregion with large Ej correspondingly large - although locally well 
confined - stresses €aEj - can be reached. For this reason the left hand side model 
is proposed to describe the mechanical response of an axially strained microfibril. 
The observed fact that chains break even after (20 minutes of) stress relaxation 
not only demands the integrity of the crystal blocks but also an intimate and per-
sistent lateral cohesion between microfibrils within a fibril and between fibrils within 
a filament. 
That such an intimate cohesion does exist had been concluded by Gezalow et al. 
[8] from the uniformity of stress induced long period changes. In his recent PhD 
thesis Frank [55] convincingly demonstrated that almost up to fracture the macro-
scopic tensile strains (between 16 and 52%) applied to PA 6 and 66 filaments always 
corresponded within experimental error to the microfibrillar tensile strains calculated 
from long period changes. Thus, it can be taken for granted that at room tempera-
ture the stress-strain behavior of PA 6 and 66 fibers described in this Section reflects 
exactly the stress-strain behavior of the microfibrils. The stress-transfer lengths of 
the microfibrils (cf. Chapter 5) obviously must be short compared to their length. 
It must also be concluded that stress relaxation at constant fiber elongation takes 
place within the microfibrils. The continued rupture of chains indicates that the 
axial strains of the rnicrofibrils are maintained during such stress relaxation. Those 
strains, however, can only be maintained if large scale slip of microfibrils or fibrils 
does not occur. 
In the described experiments with P A 6 fibers the cause of stress relaxation must 
obviously be sought within the microfibrils. Following the model shown on the left 
hand side of Figure 7.5 decrease of a (t) at constant microfibril elongation can be 
caused. 
-
either by the gradual and fairly general decrease of the relaxation moduli Ej of 
practically all amorphous regions within the microfibril 
or by the preferential and large decrease of the Ej of just a few amorphous regions, 
accompanied by their large deformation and by the retraction of others. 
The previously discussed intimate lateral cohesion and the X-ray results [8, 55] 
indicate that stress relaxation occurs through a more or less homogeneous decrease 
of all relaxation moduli. Evidently, the situation will be entirely different if the load-
ing is done at elevated temperatures, at say 100 to 150 DC, where microfibrillar slip 
is well discernible [56]. 
The following statements will serve, therefore, as the basis for a mathematical 
analysis of the (static) chain scission experiments such as step-strain or small loading 
rate tests at sufficiently low temperatures: 
stress relaxation or creep is not caused by slippage of fibrils or microfibrils; 
-
chain scission occurs in tie-segments, i.e. in those segments of a chain molecule 
170 

I. Radical Formation in Thermoplastics 
which connect two different crystal blocks traversing in a fairly extended con-
formation the amorphous region in-between (e.g. Fig. 5.2); most frequently tie-
segments interconnect adjacent crystal blocks within a microfibril, but also more 
distant or interfibrillar ties have to be considered; 
eventually breaking tie-segments are solidly held, most probably by the crystal 
blocks; although the clamping extends over 2 to 5 nm the tie-segments are,treated 
as if they had a well defined end-to-end distance Lo and contour length L; 
chain scission occurs if the axial chain stress V; reaches chain strength V; c; 
the large value of molecular stress concentration (ratio of V; to a of the order of 
50) follows from the fact that individual (highly rigid and nearly extended) chains 
are subjected to the comparatively large strains of the intra- or interfibrillar amor-
phous regions they span. 
At this point only the results of the mathematical analysis with respect to the 
kinetics of the formation of free radicals are presented. A discussion of the possible 
role of chain scission in fracture will be resumed in Chapter 8. 
The analysis concerns the general case of fairly extended tie-segments of contour 
length 4, end-to-end distance Lo, and elastic modulus Ek. Each segment spans an 
arbitrary number nai of amorphous regions (width La) and nci = na - 1 of crystalline 
regions (width Lc). If it is assumed that within a strained amorphous region a chain 
is at first fully extended and only thereafter strained elastically then energy elastic 
chain stresses V;i will only be built up in "taut" chains whose contour length 4 is 
smaller than La (1 + €a): 
V;i = Ek -
(1 + €a) - 1 +

At a given average axial microfibril strain € the stresses V;i are largest for tie-
segments interconnecting adjacent crystal blocks (Lo = La). The third term in Eq. 
(7.1) then disappears. If the tie-segments extend over several sandwich layers and 
crystal blocks of the same or different microfibrils the first term in Eq. (7.1) be-
comes small. In that case the average tensile strain € determines the stress level V;i' 
It is important to point out again that in this analysis no loading of interfibrillar 
tie-segments through shear strains (slippage between microfibrils) will be considered. 
At a degree of crystallinity of 50% € is by a factor of (2-E/Ec) smaller than €a, where 
E and Ec designate the relaxation modulus of the microfibril as a whole and that of 
the crystalline regions. 
The mathematical analysis of the free radical production curves airnes at a deter-
mination of the distribution NO(4/Lo) and of the kinetic parameters Vo, wo, and 
(3. It can be carried out taking into consideration only tie-segments between adjacent 
crystal blocks (Lo = La). If only long interfibrillar tie-segments were present the 
resulting distribution N~ (4/Lo) would be narrower and approximately obtainable

also assumes a homogeneous distribution of amorphous strains within a microfibril. 
Consideration of a non-homogeneous distribution of strains €ai would again result 
in narrowing NO(4/La). From Eqs. (5.57) and (7.1) one obtains straight forwardly 
the expectation value of the number of broken chains or formed free radicals:

where Wb = Wo exp (-Vo/RT). 
Through a numerical iteration procedure, a distribution of LilLo can be deter-
mined [7] in such a way that Eq. (7.2) describes the experimental points (e.g. those 
radical concentrations shown in Fig. 7.4). The length distribution of the intrafibrillar 
tie-segments obtained in that case is shown in Figure 7.6, it ranges from L/Lo = 1.06 
to 1.18. If the same experimental radical concentration points were to derive from 
the rupture of fairly long interfibrillar tie-segments then their relative lengths must 
have a distribution of L/Lo between 0.97 (!) and 1.05. Since a given distribution of 
segment lengths is essentially reflected by the step heights of radical equilibrium 
concentrations a histogram of these step heights serves to characterize the apparent 
segment length distribution without introducing any assumptions on the nature of 
the tie-segments. In Figure 7.7 histograms from step strain tests carried out at dif-
ferent temperatures are reproduced. 
The distribution of relative tie-segment lengths has been determined by several 
authors [3-7,10,11,13,27,55-60], forPA 6 they all find relative lengths between 
0.96 and 1.4 with a maximum around 1.16-1.18. Especially noteworthy in this re-
spect are the observations of Zhizhenkov et al. [60] since they obtain their distribu-
tion curves from an analysis of the NMR signal of strained PA 6 fibers. The authors 
observe that the area Cm under the narrow component of their NMR spectra, which 
corresponds to the "mobile fraction" of amorphous chains, increases with tempera-
ture and decreases with fiber strain. They state that the transition from a partly to 
a fully extended segment (cf. Fig. 5.1) is equivalent to the transition from a mobile 
to an immobile state. Thus, they derive from the variation ofCm with strain the 
original tie-chain length distribution function for their PA 6 fibers [60]. Interest-
ingly enough this distribution function shows a maximum at LILo = 1.16. The total

number of overloaded tie-chains within an amorphous region is indicated by 
Zhizhenkov and Egorov as being (as a function of fiber treatment) between 3 and 
10% of the number of stems that theoretically could intersect the same region [60]. 
The association of the observed free radical distributions with apparent chain 
length distributions requires the smallest number of additional assumptions. If it 
were to be assumed that the microfibrils contained a monodisperse distribution of 
relative segment lengths (e.g. L/Lo = 1.0) it were also necessary to assume that 
the amorphous strains are unevenly distributed throughout the fiber 
the molecular extensibility is comparable to the amorphous strains, i.e. reaches 25 
to 35% 
there is a rapid strain hardening of an amorphous region after breakage of the 
tie molecules (otherwise collapse of that region would lead to complete stress 
relaxation in the whole microfibril). 
Particularly the latter two conditions seemed to be unrealistic. So the early 
proponents [3-7] were led to their interpretation that a fiber contains tie chains of 
different conformations ("tautness"). 
A third interpretation of step-strain data was advanced by Crist et al. [9]. 
They suggested that there is an uneven distribution of strains due to differences in 
the lengths of the many thousand filaments strained simultaneously in any of the 
above experiments. The uneven-length effect undoubtedly broadens the observed 
distributions of relative chain lengths. But the premature breakages of individual 
filaments, and the formation of their fracture surfaces, cannot account for the num-
ber of free radicals formed. To further disprove this contention Hassell and DeVries 
examined the free radicals formed in straining of highly oriented bulk nylon 66 
banding material [10]. They obtained quite similar and even slightly wider histograms 
in straining bulk strip material than bundles of nylon 66 fibers. It is only at a level of 
deformation close to the rupture strain that a difference between the straining of a 
single fiber and of a bundle thereof becomes noticeable. This has recently been shown 
directly by Frank and Wendorff [61]; their stress-strain curves of single fibers and of 
multi-filaments of PA 6 coincided up to amorphous strains of 25%, i.e. well beyond 
the strain of 20% at which radicals appeared for the first time (see Fig. 8.15). 
173 

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
Convincing evidence against the assumption that segment length distributions 
are macroscopic artefacts was also derived from step-temperature tests carried out by 
Johnsen and Klinkenberg [11] which will be discussed in Section C. 
B. Effect of Strain Rate on Radical Production 
Local molecular stresses can partly be relieved by slip or uncoiling of molecules. In 
thermoplastics the relaxation times governing those viscoelastic deformations at room 
temperature are of the order of milliseconds to minutes, i.e. smaller or comparable 
to the duration of the mechanical excitation. Rapid loading, then, can bring more 
non extended chain segments to high stresses and eventually to chain scission than 
slow loading during the same strain interval. But their number should be small. On 
the other hand, the higher rigidity of a rapidly loaded viscoelastic body leads to a 
decrease of the strain at fracture and, therefore, also to decrease of the largest strain, 
Ea, imposed on the amorphous regions. 
The effect of strain rate on chain scission of rigidly clamped segments follows 
from Eq. (7.2). The higher the loading rate the smaller the time t necessary to reach 
a certain strain, the shorter also the time interval a stressed chain spends at the stress 
level a (t) and the smaller the probability for chain scission at that level [7]. In 
Figure 7.8 the decay curves of polyamide 6 segments of monodisperse contour 
lengths L = 1.09 Lo have been plotted. At 20% amorphous strain Ea a segment of 
length L will assumedly have a fully extended conformation and experience a chain 
strain of 10%. At this strain level chain scission becomes noticeable at small strain 
rates (0.1 . 10-6 s-I). At larger strain rates an equivalent decay is observed later. 
For the given system an increase of strain rate by a factor of 10 will shift the decay 
curve to higher strain values by .1.Ea = 0.9%. 
The effect of a change of strain rate in the course of a tensile experiment can 
be predicted from Figure 7.8. An instantaneous increase in strain rate is equivalent

I. Radical Formation in Thermoplastics 
to changing from a certain level of depletion (e.g. 40% at point A) to a level where 
the depletion at that rate should have been much lower (6% at B). In other words a 
fraction of 34% of those chains which are supposed to scission beyond B are already 
gone. Consequently the rate of chain scission following an increase in strain rate 
should be reduced. This has been quantitatively verified by Klinkenberg [13]. 
Gaur [52] found that [R·] was a unique function of fa for strain rates up to 
20 . 10-3 S-I; at 80· 10-3 S-1 ,however, a decrease in [R·] was observed which 
corresponded to a strain retardation of 1 to 2%. These findings agree within experi-
mental error with the careful analysis of Klinkenberg [13]. Only a few other experi-
ments are known where the concentration of free radicals as a function of strain rate 
has been investigated [14-16]. In Figure 7.9 the total number of spins at fracture of 
a 6 polyamide fiber sample is shown to increase in the range of clamp displacement 
rates between I and 10 . 10-3 cm/s. Above 20 . 10-3 cm/s (which corresponds to a 
strain rate of 1.43 . 10-3 S-I) a drop in free radical production is indicated [14]. 
The total rate effect seems to be not very large, however. For the present experiment, 
it did not exceed 50%. Similar values have been reported [16] from an investigation 
of the cold drawing of polycarbonate [15]. Here the total concentration of free radi-
cals obtained increased by 140% with strain rates varying from 0.017 s-1 to 1.7 S-1 
(Fig. 7.10). The effect of strain rate on the formation of free radicals in polychloro-
prene will be discussed in Section II A.

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
In all of these cases the variation of free radical concentration seems to reflect 
more the changes of material response than the kinetics of decay of stressed chains. 
The effect of strain rate on radical production in comminution (grinding, milling) 
would be very difficult to determine and no results have been reported. 
c. Effect of Temperature 
1. Apparent Energy of Bond Scission 
It is presumed that the stress-induced scission of chain molecules is achieved through 
the cooperative action of mechanical forces (lowering the bond's binding potential 
barrier) and of statistically fluctuating thermal vibrations supplying the remaining 
increment of energy which is necessary to split the loaded bond. It is also believed 
that Eq. (5.57) provides an adequate description of how mechanical and thermal 
energy affect the rate Ie.: of the thermo-mechanical chain scission process. If this 
presumption is correct, the lack of thermal vibrational energy should increase the 
stability of a stressed bond. Vice versa an increase in thermal energy should make 
previously stable bonds reach the critical level of excitation and should break them. 
It is of interest to quantitatively analyze this aspect of interaction of thermal and 
mechanical energy terms in the scission kinetics of 6-polyamide chains. 
The largest energy available to one RCONHCH2-CH2R' bond within a time 
period of l/kb is (Eq. 5.57 for ne = 1): 
(7.3) 
Using as before a value of Wo equal to 1012 S-1, a value of (j of 5.53· 10-6 
m3/mol, and a rate kb = I/Tb = 1/48 S-1 the thermal term in Eq. (7.3) has, at a 
temperature of 20°C, a value of 77 .2 kJ /mol. The stress term (j l/I must reach, there-
fore, a value of 110.8 kJ /mol before U (T) is larger than the Uo of PA 6 and bond 
rupture at room temperature can occur. At 200 K the thermal term has decreased 
to 52.7 kJ /mol. In order to provide a total energy of 188 kJ /mol, the mechanical 
term must now reach 135.3 before bond breakage will occur within 48 s. For a 
cho.in segment containing ne weak bonds the rate of scission, 1 /Te , employed in the 
above calculations will be I/Te = nc/Tb. 
If one assumes that neither (j nor Uo depend on temperature, one has to conclude 
that at 200 K it is possible to raise the molecular stress to a level which is 17% higher 
than the largest molecular stress attainable at room temperature. In other words, a 
polyamide fiber highly strained at 200 K will quite stable contain many bonds with 
(j l/I values between 110 and 135 kJ /mol. Those bonds will break, of course, if the 
temperature is raised to room temperature provided that no other means of stress 
relaxation (slip, uncoiling) become available to the strained chain segment. 
The search for chain scission events during an upward temperature scan can be 
called a critical experiment for the validity of both the kinetic equation (Equation 
5.57) and the morphological model (Fig. 7.5). These investigations have been carried 
out in the Deutsches Kunststoff-Institut in Darmstadt. Following earlier experiments

206, 227, 248, 269 and 290 K. These tests showed the same stepwise increase of 
radical concentration and a relaxing stress as reported earlier by them [6, 7, 11, 17] 
and other authors [3, 4, 10, 14] and as described in Section A. The result of a step-
temperature experiment is shown in Figure 7.11. Whereas the stress relaxation is

appears to be very similar in both experiments. The authors [11] established that 
the final radical concentration [R (T, E)] practically did not depend on the way T 
and E were attained. Their experiment has proven the contention made earlier about 
the kinetics of thermomechanical chain scission. It has also proven that the highly 
loaded chains do show in the region T < 260 K essentially no slip or anelastic defor-
mation during the time they are held at the high load, despite the considerable 
amount of overall stress relaxation. A slight loss of stressed chains becomes apparent 
at T>270 K. 
The equivalence of thermal and mechanical action on a given network of chains 
is further illustrated by calculating the relative length Lito of those intrafibrillar 
chains which are just about to break. One considers that condition to be fulfilled 
if the ljJ (L), calculated from Eq. (7.1) for La = Lo and introduced into Eq. (7.3), 
yields Uo:

of critically loaded chain segments, but subject to the condition that no chain slip 
occurs simultaneously. Under this condition the following equivalence between in-
cremental changes of sample strain and temperature is obtafued from Eq. (7.4): 
.:le= _ (1- x).:lT [LRQnwo/ke _{ (1 + Uo - RTQnwo/ke) ~ -I}. 
(1 - xE/Ee) 
Lo (j Ek 
(j Ek 
Lo 
. d(E/Ee)/dT ]. 
(7.5) 
1 - xE/Ee 
The two terms in the square brackets refer respectively to the change of chain 
strength and of strain distribution with temperature. Using the kinetic parameters 
employed in evaluating Eq. (7.3) for PA 6 chains, values of Ee = 25 GN/m2 and of 
Ek = 200 GN/m2 as previously, and an estimated temperature coefficient d(E/Ee)dT 
of -0.8· 10- 3 K- 1 one obtains at a temperature of -20°C the following quantita-
tive evaluation of Eq. (7.5): 
.:le = - [0.12 . 10-3 L/Lo + 0.48· 10- 3 (1.1 L/Lo -1)] .:l T. 
(7.6) 
This means that for a critically loaded PA 6 chain segment with L/Lo = 1.1 a 
temperature increase of 10K can be compensated by a decrease of strain of only 
0.23%. The result of this calculation agrees fairly well with the average value of 
0.3%/10 K derivable from the experiments of Johnsen and Klinkenberg [11]. For 
preoriented PA 6 fibers they observed that at -60°C a sample strain of 14.6% led 
to the same number of (1017 ) free radicals as a strain of 12.2% at +20 °C. 
The loading of possibly present long interfibrillar tie-segments is essentially 
determined by 1 + e rather than 1 + ea. Accordingly in Eq. (7 .5) the first term in 
square brackets and a front factor equal to .:l T must be retained. For P A 6 this leads to a 
.:le equal to -0.24 . 10-3 .:IT L/Lo, i.e. to 0.26%/10 K at L/Lo = 1.1. This compari-
son does not permit, therefore, to rule out the existence of interfibrillar tie-segments. 
2. Rate of Bond Scission 
A rate of bond scission can be defined in terms of time as d [R ]/dt or in terms of 
strain as d[R]/de. The relation between the two rate expressions is defined by the 
identity

which has to be taken at constant € and T at corresponding sample strains el.

I. Radical Formation in Thermoplastics 
In the absence of plastic flow (chain scission at strains of 10 to 30%) the rate 
can be derived numerically from Eq. (7.2); since the rate will depend on the shape 
of the tie-segment length distribution, No (Li), no general analytical function can 
be given for d[R]/de. The effect, however, of a change of € on d[R]/de is the same 
as that illustrated by Figure 7.8. The effect of the strain el at which the rate of bond 
scission is determined, depends on the shape of the segment length distribution, i.e. 
on the number ~N(L/Lo) of chains having a relative length L/Lo suitable to be 
broken by an increment ~e of sample strain:

(7.8) 
In Figures 7.6 and 7.7 typical segment length distributions are given. 
A change of temperature will affect the rate of radical production in three ways. 
Firstly the number N of highly extended chains will decrease if thermally activated 
slip becomes possible. Secondly the activation energy VeT) decreases with increasing 
temperature. Thirdly the sample modulus E and the crystalline modulus Ec are af-
fected by temperature. 
If in a region of sufficiently low temperatures chain slip can be excluded i.e. if 
~/ 
is constant with T the temperature affects solely the width ~ (L/Lo) of the 
dL Lo 
chain segment population which is critically loaded by a strain increase: 
~(L/Lo) 
(1 - xE/Ec)/(l - x) 
~e 
[1 + (Vo - RTQnwo/kc)/l3Ek] . 
(7.9) 
Employing the same values as used in the evaluation of Eq. (7.3) one arrives at 
~(L/Lo) = 1. 7 ~e at 20 DC and at ~(L/Lo) = 1.6 ~e at -60 DC. This means for 
example that a given distribution of segments with relative lengths L/Lo between 
1.1 and 1.3 break at room temperature within the strain interval from 12 to 13.5%. 
At a temperature of -60 DC sample strains of between 13.5 and 15.1 % are required. 
A completely different chain loading mechanism prevails during the plastic de-
formation of polymers at strains of between 30 and several hundred per cent. In that 
case a chain will rupture as a consequence of the frictional forces encountered by 
the chain itself or by other morphological units in the dynamic shearing (cf. Chap-
ter 5 II E). The obtainable axial chain stresses are proportional to the molecular or 
fibrillar friction coefficients and to the strain rate e. The number of critically loaded 
chains will reflect, therefore, the strong increase of the friction coefficient with de-
creasing temperature. Davis et al. [19] strained sheets of high molecular weight poly-
ethylene in air and observed the formation of peroxy radicals. At a level of true strain 
Qn Q/Qo of e.g. 1.1 - which corresponds to a conventional strain of 200% - the con-
centration of the peroxy radicals increased from 5 . 1014 cm- 3 at 294 K to 
1016 cm- 3 at 160 K. The rate of radical accumulation, d[R]/d Qn(Q/Qo), revealed 
two transition regions, one between 180 and 200 K and another beginning at 250 K. 
179 

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
The low temperature transition was assigned to the transition of amorphous PE to the 
glassy state, the other to slippage of chains within crystal lamellae [19]. 
The formation of free radicals during plastic deformation has also been reported 
for PP, PETP and PA 6 [62], PC [15], PVDC [63] and PVC [64]. Detection in the 
latter two materials was made by indirect methods: by respectively a radical scav-
enger method based on chloranyl [63] and through the initiation of free radical po-
lymerization of vinyl monomers in contact with deformed PVC [64]. 
3. Concentration at Break 
The increase of temperature has a fourfold effect on the number of free radicals ob-
served at the point of macroscopic fracture. Firstly as seen previously the bond 
strength is decreased and thus chain scission at a given molecular stress is facilitated. 
Secondly the decrease in intermolecular attraction and the increase in molecular 
mobility lead to more rapid relaxation of molecular stresses. For the same reason 
- thirdly - the density of stored elastic energy at a given strain level is decreased 
which will in turn affect crack stability and propagation. Fourthly, the increased 
reactivity of the free radicals may lead to an increased discrepancy between the con-
centrations of radicals formed and of radicals observed at the point of failure. 
Whenever possible the fourth point has been taken into consideration and radical 
concentrations have been corrected for losses due to recombination or other decay 
reactions of the (secondary) radicals under consideration. In the case of 6 polyamide 
fibers [5, 11, 17, 18] the radical decay is a second order recombination reaction with 
the rate constant depending on type, location, and mobility of the radicals (see Sec-
tion III below). 
In Figure 7.12 the concentration of free radicals at fracture of 6 polyamide 
fibers is shown as observed and also corrected for radical decay during and after sample 
fracture (18). The indicated decrease of the radical concentration at break towards

lower temperatures was well confirmed by Johnsen and Klinkenberg [11] who ex-
tended their measurements to -67°C. At that temperature they obtained a concen-
tration which was by a factor of 8 smaller than that at room temperature. 
180 

I. Radical Formation in Thermoplastics 
The first three of the initially mentioned temperature effects can be better un-
derstood if one makes use of the segment length distribution model. If, in fact, at 
low temperatures the changing bond strength is the only temperature dependent para-
meter then a chain length distribution derived at about -25°C should exactly in-
clude the (narrower) distributions at still lower temperatures. Vice versa from one 
measured step-strain free-radical curve all narrower ones must be predictable. John-
sen and Klinkenberg [11, 13] have confirmed that the chain length distributions 
obtained at temperatures between -67 and -25°C are derived from one and the 
same "master" distribution which is skewed to a different extent at the right hand 
side. At higher temperatures (-4 and 17°C) discrepancies between the apparent dis-
tributions and the master distribution are observed. They are interpreted as indica-
tion of structural changes leading to a relaxation of some overstressed chains. These 
chains may, however, break at a later stage of the loading process [11, 13,65]. The 
relaxation and slip effect is stronger at higher temperatures and at 50°C it clearly 
outweighs the effect of diminished bond strength, i.e. the total number of broken 
bonds at fracture decreases. Beyond 50 °c most of the chain segments belonging to 
the master distribution escape chain scission because the crystal blocks are no longer 
able to exert and maintain large enough molecular stresses. At this point it may re-
main open which mechanisms are responSible for the stress relieving structural 
changes. 
In the above sections were discussed the scission of tie chains in highly oriented 
fibers. Judging from the absence of any scale effect the molecular fracture events 
are evenly distributed throughout the amorphous volume of the stressed sample. 
Those "volume" concentrations of 1015 to 1018 spins/cm3 accounted for almost 
the total radical intensity whereas the final fracture surfaces (with estimated radical 
populations of 1012 to 1013 spins/cm2) did not noticeably contribute towards the 
total number of radicals observed in tensile straining of the fiber samples. This is 
different if the mechanical degradation is achieved through milling, grinding and/or 
cutting. In all these techniques comminution is achieved through failure of virgin 
material resulting from the application of multiaxial stress particularly involving 
compressive components. In impact loading of platelike or granular samples com-
pressive waves may be generated. Upon reflection on boundaries or discontinuities, 
compressive waves become dilational waves giving rise to tensile fracture. All forces 
combine to overcome the cohesive forces and to create new surface area. Those chains 
which break in this process are either intersecting weak cross-sections and/or are con-
tained in shear zones along a suitable direction. It must be assumed, therefore, that 
chains are broken preferentially - but not exclusively - in the zones of new surface. 
The surface concentration of free radicals in ground polymers has been deter-
mined by different investigators [20-23]. As to be expected the mobility of the 
chains within the degrading material strongly effects the obtainable radical concen-
trations. Backman and DeVries [21,22] sliced 66 PA, PP, and PE in a nitrogen at-
mosphere and transferred the slices within less than 0.5 s into liquid nitrogen and 
determined the number of free radicals by ESR. The degradation temperature was 
varied between -20°C and 90°C. The authors observed a rapid decrease of surface 
concentrations at the respective glass transitions (Fig. 7.l3). It should be noted that 
the rate of decay of the radicals formed also increases beyond T g' but that this loss

of radicals amounts to less than 30% [18]. From the level of the low temperature 
radical concentrations it can be concluded that the average fracture plane breaks be-
tween 5 and 10% of all chains intersecting the plane. Pazonyi et al. [22] investigated 
polyviny1chloride with differing contents of plasticizer (30, 40, 50, and 60% respec-
tively of dioctylphthalate, DOP). They estimated that cutting at 30°C led to the 
scission of (128, 105, 55 and 34% respectively of all) chains intersecting an ideally 
sharp fracture plane. They also investigated low and high density polyethylene and 
found 1.39 and 1.17 . 1015 spins/cm2 which means they had to cut 120 and 104% 
respectively of the intersecting chains. If one realizes that even a "sharp fracture 
plane" is in reality a strongly deformed surface zone of a depth of 1 JIm or more the 
above "cutting ratios" are absolutely reasonable. Pazonyi et al. did their cutting in an 
ethanolic solution of diphenyl picryl hydrazyl the color change of which was used as 
a measure for the number of free radicals formed. The unusually large molecular cut-
ting ratios given by Pazonyi et al. and their discrepancy with the values cited earlier 
are noted and discussed by Salloum and Eckert [23]. They point out that reactions 
of DPPH with ethanol and with polymer surfaces not containing free radicals may 
take place thus accounting for the excessively high radical numbers determined by 
Pazonyi. Salloum and Eckert drilled PE, Nylon, and PP in a solution of DPPH in 
benzene. They obtained 0.1-2 (PE), 0.5-4 (6 PA) and 7_9.1013 spins/cm2 (PP) 
respectively. The first two values are in agreement with the results of Backman and 
DeVries, the latter is not. 
Both laboratories [20-22] conclude that free radicals are formed within a sur-
face layer of finite thickness. From a study of oxygen diffusion rates and of the con-
version of the original ESR signal from secondary 6 nylon radicals to that of peroxy 
radicals Backman and DeVries determine that 50% of all "damage" occurred within 
a layer of less than 0.6 JIm from the surface. The remaining 50% of chain radicals 
were found in a depth of up to 3 pm from the surface. Considering the morphology 
of the degraded polymers, the mechanics of the comminution process, and the mo-
182 

I. Radical Formation in Thermoplastics 
bility of the primary formed free radicals the spatial distribution of the secondary 
radicals can be understood. In this case the pull out and breakage of individual PA 
chains appears unlikely in view of the crystal strength. As we have discussed in Chap-
ter 5, a 6 PA chain embedded within a crystallite with more than 1.7 nm of its length 
will rather break than be pulled away from the crystallite. The pull out of whole 
micro/ibrils from a fracture surface very probably will occur and will be accompanied 
by breakage of interfibrillar tie chains thus introducing damage within a surface layer 
of up to 1 /J.ITI depth. Even more important will be the heavy plastic deformation of 
the material ahead of a growing fracture surface. The propagation of free radicals 
certainly contributes to deepen the layer of apparent damage. The layer depths ob-
served in these experiments do coincide, however, very well with the lower limits of 
particle sizes obtainable in mechanical degradation [24] indicating, that the damage 
may indeed be introduced mechanically up to the observed depths. 
This phenomenon, namely the chain breaking efficiency of a plane fracture 
event, has been further investigated by Wool et al. [66]. They microtomed atactic 
polystyrene in 1- and 2-J.lm slices and measured the ensuing decrease in viscosity av-
erage molecular weight. From their results they concluded that each molecular coil 
with Mn larger than the critical entanglement molecular weight Mer which intersects 
the (ideally sharp) fracture plane is cut ~ times. From their model they obtained av-
erage ~-values of between 5 at + 80°C, 14.45 at room temperature, and 22 at 
- 100°C. They assume that a PS molecule having an Mn of 450,000 occupies a 
sphere of diameter D = 60 nm. Any given area Ao will be intersected by chain seg-
ments belonging to ND such spheres. The number of these chain segments is Nseg = 
Ao/q. It is easily verified (cf. Tab. 9.2) that Nseg = 16 ND (450,000). It follows that 
at room temperature the total number of chain cuts (~ . ND ) is comparable to the 
total number of chain segments intersecting an ideal plane. At lower temperatures 
it will be larger. In view of the fact that the chain scission events do occur within a 
material volume several 10 to 100 coil diameters deep, it is quite conceivable that the 
total number of chain scission events is 5 to 20 times larger than the number of coils 
intersecting an ideal reference plane. 
D. Effect of Sample Treatment 
The effect of heat treatment on structure, fracture strength and chain scission has 
been very extensively investigated by Statton, Park and DeVries [25-27] and by 
Lloyd [5]. With respect to our understanding of chain breakages in annealed fibers 
the follOwing morphological changes seem to be particularly noteworthy. Relaxed 
heat treatments result in [25]: 
1. Increases of the degree of crystallinity, perfection of crystallites, density, chain 
folding, Young's modulus, and intensity of the fluid-like component of the NMR-
signal. 
2. Decreases of sample length (shrinkage), breaking strength, sonic modulus, and T g. 
The changes are the more intense the higher the annealing temperature. Tension 
during annealing tends to modify or reduce the above listed effects. Relaxed and 
tension annealing do, however, increase the long period.

The morphological changes certainly have a bearing on the molecular stress dis-
tribution and chain breakage. In Figure 7.14 the histogram from an ESR step-strain 
test is reproduced which was obtained from a tension-free annealed polyamide sample 
at 199°C [27]. The histogram is broader, indicating a less homogeneous distribution 
of molecular strains, and it is shifted towards higher strains by about two to four 
per cent of strain. This may be seen from Figure 7.15 where the chain length distri-
bution of the annealed sample is compared with that of an unannealed reference 
sample. The used probability plot had been calculated under the assumption that 
the histogram in Figure 7.14 represents a normal distribution of chain lengths skewed 
at the right hand side.

I. Radical Formation in Thermoplastics 
The observed conformatio,nal changes in slack annealing have been interpreted 
[25-27] as an increase in relative length of (the formerly) extended tie chain seg-
men ts due to defect migration out of the crystal blocks. The number of regular 
chain folds also increases. Shrinkage of the yarn appears to be governed by the num-
ber of folds introduced. The structural changes occurring during annealing are me-
chanically stable and not simply reverted under tensile stress. In Figure 7.16 a model 
representation of the conformational changes in annealing are given [4, 5]. Because 
of defect migration one obtains in tension annealing a relaxation of local molecular 
strains and thus a larger number of extended chain segments. On the basis of this 
experimental evidence Statton has constructed a string model of slack annealed, 
tension annealed, and reference fibers which is shown in Figure 7,17 [28]. The effect 
of the annealing process on the total number of free radicals formed in subsequent 
straining at room temperature and on fracture strength is shown in Figures 7.18 and 
7.19 . The annealing at maximum tension (11.7% elongation) does lead to a smaller 
number of spins at fracture and may be explained by the breakage of chains during 
tension annealing. Intermediate positive annealing strains (not shown in Fig. 7.18 )

do slightly increase the number of spins. The opposite effects of annealing tempera-
ture and of constraint of the sample during annealing on the homogeneity of the 
chain length distribution are shown in Figure 7.20. These effects are discussed in 
more detail in Chapter 8. 
II. Free Radicals in Stressed Rubbers 
A_ Preorientation, Ductility, and Chain Scission 
In Section I we have discussed the stress-induced chain scission of thermoplastic 
polymers. As we have seen chain scission could occur whenever the intermolecular 
forces acting on tightly embedded sections of extended (tie) molecules were strong 
enough to resist segment slip during deformation in such a manner as to give rise to 
axial forces equal to or larger than the mechanical strength of the molecular chain. 
Exactly the same considerations apply to chain scission in elastomers which are in 
a temperature region below T g. Andrews, Reed, and Natarajan [29-31] have studied 
under these aspects the deformation behavior of sulphur cured natural rubber (cis-
polyisoprene), dicumyl peroxide-cured natural rubber, and polychloroprene. They 
observed that (see Fig. 7.21) in the temperature region I from glass transition (200K) 
to 160 K the deformation behavior of natural rubber was very similar to that of a 
thermoplastic polymer, with a clearly discernible yield point and a yield stress which

increased with decreasing temperature [31, 67]. Following a transition region there 
was a narrow temperature band (II) between 150 and 130 K within which brittle 
fracture occurred at strains of less than 5%. For still lower temperatures - and only 
for these temperatures - the authors [29-31] made the very interesting observation 
that the deformation behavior was determined by the state or orientation of the 
stressed network. Unoriented rubber specimens behaved brittle just as they do within 
the temperature band above. A second group of samples was prepared by first pre-
187 

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
orienting them at room temperature by uniaxial straining to 100 to 200%, and then 
cooling them down to 90 to 130 K (region III). These samples showed a ductile de-
formation behavior (Fig. 7.21). In this case the ductile low temperature deformation 
was accompanied by microvoiding in narrow striations, the formation of detectable 
amounts of free radicals, and by absorption of environmental gases within the micro-
voids. These gases expanded upon warming of the deformed specimens and gave rise 
to a peculiar foaming effect. The observed free radical spectra of sulphur-cured poly-
isoprene have been assigned to allyl main chain radicals stemming from the scission 
of the (weakest) bond located between the two a-methylene groups. These radicals 
appeared together with a contribution of possibly RS radicals. The spectra of di-
cumyl peroxide-cured polyisoprene and polychloroprene were assigned to secondary 
peroxy radicals ROO. The concentration of free radicals (in polychloroprene) varied 
with strain rate and yielded a maximum of 6 . 1016 spins/g at a strain rate of 0.01 S-1 
[31 ]. 
Taking all these observations together, the following model of the deformation 
behavior of elastomers below their glass transition temperature is proposed: In region I 
intermolecular attraction is sufficiently strong to permit energy elastic deformation 
of chain segments. Gradually at first, and exclusively beyond the yield point, slip and 
reorientation of chain segments occur. Chain scission is negligible because chains will 
rather slip than break. In temperature region II where brittle fracture occurs irrespec-
tively of the state of preorientation the intermolecular attraction seems to be just 
large enough to permit the axial loading of chain segments up to their breaking stress. 
In the absence of local strain hardening the largest crack initiated within the speci-
men during deformation to the 55% level will rapidly expand and prevent the growth 
of any other crack nuclei. As discussed for thermoplastics, the formation of essen-
tially one plane of fracture is hardly sufficient to produce a detectable amount of 
free radicals. Unoriented rubber specimens (sampl~s frozen in the relaxed state) show 
the same brittle behavior also in temperature region III (90 to 130 K). Specimen pre-
oriented by extensions of 100 to 200%, however, obviously have gained the property 
of local strain hardening. The nature of this effect can only be speculated on and 
probably is related to the build up of partially oriented microfibrils within the pre-
oriented elastomers. The result of local strain hardening is that the flaws and defects 
which are still present develop into. a system of interconnected microvoids and ex-
tended fibrils forming the large and clearly visible striations. Environmental gases are 
adsorbed to the newly formed surfaces. Since the microfibrils are strong enough to 
carry the load transferred upon them the strained sample will not break but more 
and more defects will develop into crazes and striations. The largest number of stri-
ations appears at medium extension rates (0.01 S-1 in polychloroprene). The large 
local deformation (up to more than 100% strain) which is found throughout the total 
volume of the sample together with the strong intermolecular attraction between differ-
ent chain segments leads to a large axial excitation - and breakage - of those chain seg-
ments which play the role of tie molecules. As the discussed results show, the spin 
concentration at break of elastomers in temperature region III is comparable to that ob-
tained from 6 polyamide. In case of a large preorientation of 300% (in polychloro-
prene) a ductile deformation behavior and the formation of free radicals are observed 
[31]. The deformation is macroscopically homogeneous. No striations or crazes are 
188

visible indicating that the strain hardening is more effective than at lesser preorien-
tations. The growth of microvoids obviously is stopped before they coalesce and 
form crazes. The absence of large scale gas adsorption and of foaming upon subse-
quent heating together with differences in the observed ESR spectrum support this 
view [31]. 
Brown, DeVries, and Williams duplicated these experiments and extended them 
to Hycar 1043, an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber [32] and to Silastic E RTV, a silicone 
elastomer [33]. They confirmed for these polymers the above described effect of pre-
strain on the stress-strain behavior at low temperatures (118 to 193 K) the formation 
of free radicals with increasing sample strain, and the effect of strain rate on radical 
concentration with a maximum at a rate of 9' 10-4 S-I. For these polymers they 
did not observe, however, the three temperature zones mentioned above which are 
characterized by distinctly different types of mechanical response. They also propose 
that during preorientation numerous regions of higher strength and degree of orien-
tation are created which later serve to arrest developing microcracks before those 
can attain a critical size. The fact that for the latter two polymers [32, 33] only one 
region of ductile and one region of brittle fracture were observed may be attributed 
to different physical and chemical properties of those networks (configuration, cross-
link density, glass transition temperature). Some of these structural parameters will 
be studied in the following section. 
B. Cross-Link Density, Impurities, Fillers 
We have seen above that in low temperature ductile deformation of rubbers a large 
number of chain segments break which indicates that the local axial stresses exceed 
the strengths of the chain segments. We have shown earlier that the stresses required 
for bond breakage are more than two orders of magnitude larger than those applied 
macroscopically to deform the rubber specimens. The appearance of free radicals, 
therefore, indicates the highly inhomogeneous distribution of local stresses. The 
radical intensity gives an account of the number N of segments which have been 
stressed beyond their strength; N will depend, therefore, on all parameters which 
raise the local stresses like cross-link density or content of reinforcing fillers, which 
decrease the bond strength like presence of hetero-groups in the main chain, or which 
affect the number of observed radicals through radical reactions. 
Andrews and Reed [31] observed an increase in radical intensity with increasing 
cross-link density of sulphur cured natural rubber (Fig. 7.22) using the pre orienta-
tion-technique described above. This observation is wen in keeping with the fact that 
tensile stresses of identically strained rubbery specimens increase with increasing 
cross-link density i.e. decreasing chain length between cross-links. The effect of im-
purities on the concentration of formed free radicals although clearly demonstrated 
by the data of Figure 7.22 is not fully understood. In the absence of conspicuous 
radical reactions or a direct effect on bond strengths it is believed that the impurities 
constitute stress raising inhomogeneitie~J31]. .

radicals at fracture at 100 to 
120 K (after Andrews and 
Reed [311). 
It is not always necessary to prestrain rubbers to induce the development of a 
large number of microcracks distributed throughout the bulk of the rubber sample. 
Wilde et al. [34,35] have shown that certain granular fillers can promote bond rup-
ture during sample fracture. Again the studies were by necessity conducted at tem-
peratures below 210 K where the radicals were sufficiently stable. Fillers in elasto-
mers are commonly used for a variety of reasons. In any case the presence of such 
fillers increases the complexity of the micromechanics of deformation and fracture. 
The presence of the filler results in very non-homogeneous localized stress fields 
ranging from levels of high strain concentration to complete separation between the 
matrix and filler (dewetting). The filler particles may serve as crack arrestors and/or 
initiators and thereby alter the fracture strength, resilience, and/or toughness. Wilde 
studied four systems all filled to approximately 50% by weight. These were: 
1. 29 J.lffi glass beads in EPDM, 
2. silane treated 15 J.lffi glass bead fIlled polyisoprene, 
3. NaCI filled polyisoprene and 
4. HiSil 233 (silica) filled polyisoprene. 
The first system provided very weak interaction between filler and matrix, the 
last very strong interaction, and the other two demonstrated intermediate filler-
matrix interaction. All systems were tested in temperature region I (170 to 200 K), 
a region within which an unfilled rubber without preorientation produces no free 
radicals in tensile straining. Three of the four filled systems, however, behaved dif-
ferently. It was found that the untreated glass filled elastomer fractured with no 
detectable production of free radicals, fracture in the rubbers filled with silane 
treated glass and NaCI produced easily detectable concentrations of radicals 
(3.21 . 1014 spins/cm3 ). The HiSil system produced at some temperatures and 
190

strain rates, up to an order of magnitude more radicals than NaCl or treated glass 
(7.86· 1014 spins/cm3 ). In his PhD thesis Wilde [35] details a rather comprehensive 
comparison of scanning electron microscope photographs with the ESR results. The 
photographs indicate that at room temperature dewetting started to occur in the 
untreated glass system at strains of less than 10 to 20%, in the treated glass beads 
and NaCI systems it occurred at strains of between 50 and 100%, and in the HiSil 
system at strains greater than 200%. Scanning electron micrographs of the fracture 
surfaces at all temperatures between 150 and 300 K revealed the same findings and 
showed 1. that untreated glass beads were sitting essentially loose in the "smooth" 
vacuoles or voids on the fracture surface, 2. that treated glass surfaces and NaCI 
behaved similar to untreated glass except that here the vacuoles were not so smooth 
and that there was material adhering to the filler particles, and 3. that the HiSil 
particles were embedded in the matrix at the fracture surface with the rubber ad-
hering completely to the particle surfaces. 
A slightly different two-phase system with strong bonds at phase boundaries 
is that obtained from triblock copolymers such as styrene-butadiene. As discussed 
in Chapter 2 such a copolymer molecule is composed of rigid (styrene) end blocks 
joined by elastomeric (butadiene) center blocks. The styrene blocks aggregate to 
form small domains which act as cross-links leading to a rubberlike elasticity of the 
block copolymer at ambient temperatures but to the possibility of plastic deforma-
tion at high temperatures. For an understanding of the fracture behavior of these 
systems it would be useful to identify in which of the phases molecular rupture 
most often occurs. The direct means of accomplishing this goal would be to frac-
ture the material and analyze the hyperfine structure of the resulting ESR spectra. 
In the temperature range between liquid nitrogen and room temperature, however, 
tensile straining does not lead to sufficiently observable accumulations of free radicals. 
As a consequence, De Vries, Roylance, and Williams [36] adapted the less conclusive 
but more straight-forward method of comparing the spectrum of styrene-butadiene 
block copolymers (SBS) with those of styrene and butadiene alone. These studies 
were done on grindings to accumulate large amounts of fracture surface and at liquid 
nitrogen temperatures. The low temperature made the radicals more stable and hope-
fully "froze" the primary radicals. Comparison of the spectra of the three materials 
showed that the spectrum in the SBS contained all the lines of the butadiene radical 
but not of the styrene radical. The radical of the SBS system was, therefore, assigned 
to the butadiene phase. Unfortunately the study leaves open the questions as to 
whether or not the radical formed by grinding at low temperatures is the same as 
that presumably formed under normal conditions at room temperature and whether 
the observed radical is the primary radical or a secondary one. 
Taking together the experimentally observed effects ofthe five parameters im-
purity content, degree of cross-linking, ease of crystallite formation, strength of 
filler-matrix adhesion, and presence of different phases on the nature and intensity of 
free radicals formed we derive at the following conclusions. All five parameters tend 
to increase the apparent cross-link density and decrease the extensibility of chain 
segments between cross-links. They thus enhance the forces acting at a given strain 
and also the ultimate forces that can be transmitted onto chain segments. Both con-
ditions are necessary before chain stresses can exceed chain strengths. Furthermore 
191 

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
all five parameters increase the number of actual or potential defect sites and cause 
a better spatial distribution of chain scission events. If chains fail they will always 
be located in the amorphous or more flexible regions of the (hetero-phase) elasto-
mers. 
III. Mechanically Relevant Radical Reactions 
In Sections I and II of this Chapter primary and secondary free radicals have been 
treated as micro probes which characterize occurrence and molecular environment 
of chain breakages. As shown in Chapter 6 the primary mechano-radicals are always 
chain end radicals which are mostly unstable. At a rate depending on temperature 
these radicals will transfer the free electrons and thus "convert" to secondary ra-
dicals. This reaction and also subsequent conversion and decay reactions including 
recombination are relevant with respect to an interpretation of the fracture process 
in two ways. Firstly these reactions interfere with a determination of the concentra-
tion and molecular environment of the original chain scission points. Secondly they 
change the physical properties of other network chains through the introduction of 
unpaired electrons and the formation of crosslinks [67). For a discussion of spectro-
scopic details and of the stability and conformation of the free radicals the reader 
is referred to the comprehensive monograph of Ranby and Rabek [37] and to the 
review articles of Campbell [38] and of Sohma et al. [39]. In the following the me-
chanically relevant aspects of radical transfer and decay are reported. 
A. Transfer Reactions 
At this point the geometrical aspect of transfer reactions is to be investigated. Through 
breakage of an elastically strained chain the primary radicals are formed at either side 
of the breakage site. Because of the axial chain stresses the new chain end radicals 
rapidly retract from each other. They are thus being prevented from recombination. 
The primary radicals then convert to secondary ones mostly by transfer of a hydrogen 
atom (see Table 6.1). If hydrogen transfer occurs along one and the same chain no 
effect on the physical network properties is to be foreseen. If, however, a hydrogen 
is abstracted from a neighboring chain the radical is transferred to a mid-chain posi-
tion at a hitherto uneffected chain segment. There is strong evidence for the occur-
rence of both processes, the radical migration along a chain [39] and the hydrogen 
hopping accross chains [40]. The hydrogen hopping process was demonstrated by 
Dole et al. [40] who had molecular deuterium gas, D2, diffuse into irradiated poly-
ethylene; D2 was then converted to HD by the following reactions: 
R + D2 ---+ RID + D 
b + R'H--R' 
+HD. 
Although in this experiment a gaseous tracer had been used it is believed that 
hydrogen abstraction from a hydrocarbon chain proceeds in the same manner. In 
192 

III. Mechanically Relevant Radical Reactions 
view of the mobility of the chain end radical the hydrogen abstraction seems to be 
a logical vehicle for the transfer of a free electron to a central position within another 
chain segment. 
The radical migration along a chain was found by Sohma et al. [39] to give the 
only plausible explanation for his observation that in PE and PMMA chain end radicals 
convert to a near-end radical:

Sohma indicates that also in these polymers radical migration along the chain 
and successive hydrogen abstraction are both important mechanisms of radical migra-
tion. 
Transfer reactions are, of course, influenced by the presence of impurities or 
additives which are active as radical acceptors or radical scavengers. Their mechanical 
relevance lies in the fact that they reduce or prevent transfer of free radicals to cen-
tral chain positions, radical recombination, and/or cross-linking. The latter aspect is 
discussed in Chapter 8. For a review of radical reactions with H2, D2, O2, S02, NO 
and N02, NH3 , H2 S, and various halogens the reader is referred to the works of 
Campbell [38] and of Rtmby and Rabek [37], the latter being especially concerned 
with the reactions of oxygen in its different forms (triplet and singlet molecular 
oxygen, atomic oxygen). 
B. Recombination and Decay 
The normal decay of macro radicals by recombination in the solid phase is a second 
order reaction [5, 11, 17-18, 37-39,41-43] 
[R(t)] = [Ro]/(l + k [Ro]t). 
(7.10) 
The decay rate term kRo depends - as expected - on temperature: for unloaded 
fibers under He atmosphere values of 0.0014 S-1 (75°C) and 0.Q11O S-1 (100 DC) 
have been determined (18). This value ties in with the 0.001 S-1 measured at 50 
an'! 60°C under N2 [11,41]. It should be noted that the recombination reaction 
193 

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
is slowed down by the application of tensile forces as for instance during the pre-
fracture loading period: under near maximum tensile stress the decay rate terms 
were only 0.00035 S-1 (75°C) and 0.00075 S-1 (l00 0c) respectively [18]. The 
kinetics of decay is also affected by conversion reactions (e.g. of alkyl into allyl 
radicals) or catalytic effects [37]. 
The effect of the mobility of the radical site on the recombination rate has been 
clearly shown by the pressure [44-46] and temperature dependence [41-43,47-49] 
of radical decay in e.g. PE, PP, PA 6,66, and 12, and PPO. The decay curves offree 
radical populations in (irradiated) polymers as a function of increasing temperature 
reveal a number of plateaus each corresponding to radicals trapped in a particular 
morphological site. A transition from one plateau to the next indicates that one 
species of the trapped free radicals has become sufficiently mobile for recombination 
(chemically identical radicals in crystalline and amorphous regions may differ in steric 
configuration which also effects the rate of recombination [37,42,47]). The transi-
tions are hence associated with the corresponding mechanical 'Y,~, and a dispersions 
[41-43]. 
As already indicated earlier apparent steps in those radical concentration curves 
which are obtained by straining fibers by equal increments at different temperatures 
[11, 19], are not solely related to dispersion regions of the modulus but reflect de-
tails of the relative segment length distribution as well. 
For chemically different radical species generally different decay constants with 
different activation energies are observed. Tino et al. [42] determined for the central 
polyamide radical-NH-CH-CH2- in the temperature region of 15 to 50°C an 
activation energy for decay of 10 kcal/mol, for the chain end radical-CONH-CH2 
a value of 5.2 kcal/mol. 
Studies of the effect of hydrostatic pressure on free radical decay have the aim 
of elucidating the mobility and the distance of migration. A series of experiments 
has been carried out at the Polymer Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences in 
Bratislava. The rate constants of free radical decay decrease exponentially with in-
creasing pressure [44-46]. At low temperatures the rate constant varies only slightly 
with pressure. The retarding effect becomes stronger at higher temperatures; the 
closer the decay temperature to the glass transition temperature T g the more pro-
nounced the stabilizing effect of pressure. Of course the pressure effect shows a 
saturation once the pressure is so large as to inhibit the molecular motion in question, 
8 kb for the a relaxation in PE and PV AC at 80-11 0 ° C [44], 15 kb for the a relaxa-
tion in 6 PA [44J. 
Another mechanical effect, the formation of additional cross-links in rubber 
vulcanizates stressed at low temperatures, has been investigated by Kusano et al. [67] . 
They point out that free· radicals are formed in NR stressed at -195°C; these radi-
cals begin to react at T > _40°C and apparently prefer a cross-linking reaction to a 
reaction with oxygen. An interesting technique to study the inverse phenomenon, 
the weakening of a network by breakage of cross-links, has been indicated by Huang 
and Aklonis [68] who used the photo-induced scission of disulfide linkages.

III. Mechanically Relevant Radical Reactions 
c. Anomalous Decay 
Sohma et al. [39] investigated the thermal decay of mechano-radicals. They observed 
for PE, PP, and PTFE an increase in the concentration of free radicals while increas-
ing the temperature from 77 to 170 K. They termed this behavior which is not found 
for irradiation-produced radicals, anomalous. The anomalous increase is enhanced by 
excess triboelectric charges of the sawed samples and by the presence of oxygen [39]. 
On the basis of their extensive investigations the authors advance a mechanism for 
the creation of free radicals through heat treatment at the rather low temperatures 
of 77 to 170 K. They postulate the formation of (spectroscopically neutral) carb-
anions during the degradation process at 77 K, here illustrated for PP: 
-CH2-(CH3)CH + e-
~ -CH2-(CH3)CH-
t 
(carbanions, no ESR spectrum) 
.j, 
-(CH3)CH-CH2 + e-
--t -(CH3)CH-CH2". 
During the "heat" treatment (100-173 K) the carbanions react with O2 to form 
spectroscopically active peroxy radicals. The released electrons leak to the ground: 
-CH2-(CH3)CH-
+ O2 
~ -CH2-(CH3)HCOO + e-
-(CH3)CH-CH2" 
+ O2 
~ -(CH3)CH-H2COO + e-. 
D. Radical and Electron Trapping Sites 
Mechanically relevant information has been obtained from an analysis of radical 
trapping sites. Thus it has been concluded in previous sections of this chapter that 
it is the amorphous regions of a semicrystalline polymer where mechano-radicals 
are formed. Apart from that changes in sample morphology during mechanical work-
ing have been investigated by ESR technique. Kusumoto, Takayanagi et al. [50-51] 
studied PE and PP films by successively removing the amorphous material through 
nitric acid etching. They then analyzed the ESR spectra obtained by r irradiation 
of the so treated films. Thus they were able to correlate the octet observed in PP with 
radicals trapped at defect sites within the crystallites, the nonet with radicals in the 
amorphous fold surfaces. The latter are especially effective radical trapping sites. 
The authors analyzed the effect of quenching, annealing, and cold-drawing on the 
mosaic-block structure of their films. 
From a change in line shape parameter of the PE sextet spectrum and of the 
temperature dependence of radical recombination rates the authors determined the 
increase in unoriented material content during mechanical fatigue [51). For the 
study of the surfaces of as-grown and annealed PE single crystals Kusumoto et al. 
[52] also employed the spin-probe method. 
The ESR technique has permitted to identify initial rupture points in mechanical-
ly degraded copolymers. As already discussed in Chapter 6 Lazar and SZQCS [53] 
195 

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
investigated random, 15lock and graft copolymers of methylmethacrylate and styrene 
(see 6 IV A). 
By comparing the reactions of mechano-radicals in ball-milled PP with those 
of "'Y-radicals" Kurokawa et al. [54] concluded that the mechano-radicals were pro-
duced and trapped on the fresh surfaces created by the breaking-up of solid poly-
propylene. 
A quite interesting mechanism influencing polymer strength has recently been 
advanced by Zakrevskii et al. [69]. They propose the tunneling of an electron from 
a highly strained chain to an electron-trap. The chain thus becomes ionized and its 
rupture (into a radical and a radical ion) is, therefore, facilitated. The electronic 
properties of polymers and their influence on mechanical degradation still deserve 
more attention. Some aspects will be discussed in 9 III E.

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
Section II B of Chapter 2 gave a description of the uniaxial deformation behavior 
of an unoriented thermoplastic polymer. It was indicated that - depending on 
experimental and material parameters - failure could occur at any of the different 
stages of a tensile loading process: 
as brittle fracture due to crack initiation and propagation during anelastic de-
formation 
as a consequence of plastic flow after necking or homogeneous yielding 
as ultimate failure following plastic deformation with strain hardening. 
It is useful, therefore, to distinguish between brittle strength, yield strength, 
and ultimate strength of a polymer. 
Quite obviously the role of chain loading and scission within the three strength 
determining mechanisms will be quite different. It has been stated repeatedly 
throughout this book that the load carrying capabilities of chain molecules are uti-
lized most effectively if chain orientation and intermolecular attraction permit 
the gradual accumulation of large axial chain stresses and oppose slip and 
void formation. It is for this reason that highly oriented polymer fibers are the most 
suitable objects to study chain loading and scission. In Chapter 7 the experimental 
observations concerning the formation of mechano-radicals and of their conversion 
have been reported. With respect to the phenomenology there is little disagree-
ment in the literature. In the first section of this chapter the possible effects of 
chain scission and of radical reactions on ultimate strength will be discussed, which 
is a more controversical subject. 
The second section concerns unoriented polymers and failure mechanisms, which 
are homogeneous on a macroscopic scale. Thus the conditions of impact loading 
(large loading rates), creep (constant load), yielding, necking, and drawing (constant 
strain rate), and fatigue (intermittent or cyclic loading) will be investigated. Elasto-
mers also belong to the group of unoriented polymers although their failure may 
occur after considerable elongation and orientation. 
The chapter closes with a discussion of chain scission caused or assisted by the 
simultaneous action of stress and aggressive environment. 
I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
A. Underlying Problems 
The undisputed fact of the rupture of chains in large numbers during mechanical 
action [1] is, in itself: neither proof nor even indication that macroscopic stress relaxa-
tion, deformation and fracture are a consequence of the breakage of chains. As was 
pointed out by Kausch and Becht [2] the observed total number of broken chains 
is much too small to account (by virtue of their load carrying capability) for the 
measured reductions in macroscopic stress. As shown in Figure 7.4 the stress relaxa-
tion within a strain step (of 0.65%) amounts to 60 to 100 MN/m2 . The load having 
been carried by the 0.7 . 1017 chain segments broken during such strain step, how-
ever, is calculated to be 2.4 MN/m2 if the tie-segments had traversed just one amor-

phous region; it is n . 2.4 MN/m2 if they had spanned n such regions. For these and 
most of the following calculations a sandwich-type model of the fiber structure will 
be used such as represented in Figure 7.5 I. In the case of n = 1 the macroscopic stress 
relaxation obviously has an intensity 25 to 40 times larger than the decrease of the 
accumulated moleculilr stresses derived from the number of the observed chain 
scission events. However, here also one must say that this discrepancy in itself is 
neither proof nor even indication that macroscopic stress relaxation, deformation 
and fracture are not a consequence of the breakage of chains. 
A basic problem of microstructural fracture theories involving chain scission 
is clearly an elucidation of this descrepancy. Such a clarification can only be at-
tempted by widening the scope and by including other experimental observations. 
Three principal questions must be raised before supporting or discarding a chain 
scission fracture hypothesis: 
Does the number of chain scission events observed by anyone method corre-
spond to the number of chains actually breaking? 
Does chain scission effect the mechanical properties of a polymer network in an 
indirect way, e.g. through the release of stored elastic energy or ensuing radical 
reactions? 
-
At what point and why does the phase of spatially homogeneous defect devel-
opment turn into local crack growth? Is chain scission a necessary or an acci-
dental precursor to mechanical instability? 
The discussion of the underlying problem of the nature of the primary molec-
ular processes of damage, their interaction and possible propagation has been initiated 
and constantly stimulated through the various detailed studies carried out in the 
A. F. loffe Physico technical Institute in Leningrad by S. N. Zhurkov and his col-
leagues [3-33,383-396]. The individual problems attacked concern 
-
investigation of the loading of chain segments before chain scission by IR tech-
nique [4-16,383-385] 
determination of the absolute numbers [16-18] of chain scission events using 
ESR [19-21] and IR [22-26] spectroscopy 
formation of microcracks studied by SAXS [27-29] and electron microscopy 
[393-395] 
kinetics of thermal, mechanical and molecular degradation [30-33,386-388] 
analysis of the structure, mechanical behavior and fatigue under various environ-
mental conditions in view of the foregoing considerations. These are reviewed in 
[3] and will be discussed later in this Section. 
A general remark must be made concerning the comparison and transfer of 
results obtained from different specimens (e.g. films or fibers), methods (e.g. IR or 
ESR), or laboratories. Whereas reliltive data such as the effect of time, temperature 
or stress on the behavior of one specimen (in one spectrometer at one laboratory) 
are generally in good agreement inconsistencies still persist with respect to absolute 
figures and to the possible structural and/or chemical identity of different specimens. 
The following discussion of the fracture work and of fracture theories involving 
chain scission will be centered around the three principal questions raised earlier 
even though they will not always be answered.

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
B. Loading of Chains before Scission 
To date two methods have been employed for the determination of the distribution 
N (1Ji) of (large) axial chain stresses: 
the indirect method of observing the formation of free radicals after a lowering 
of chain strengths through increasing temperatures 
the direct method of evaluating the stress-induced shift of infrared (IR) absorp-
tion bands. 
~he indirect method of obtaining stress-distributions is based on the fact that 
the strength of a chain segment decreases with increasing temperature. During an 
upward temperature scan, therefore, those chain segments will be broken successive-
ly whose strength IJib(T) becomes smaller than their axial load. The method has 
been discussed in Section ICI of Chapter 7 for groups of chain segments with dif-
ferent relative lengths L/Lo. The ensuing relative length distribution N (L/Lo) can 
easily be transformed into a stress distribution N [1Ji (L/Lo)] with the aid of 
Eq. (7.1). 
This indirect method has a rather restricted applicability. It is limited to a tem-
perature region T < T 1 where interfibrillar slip is still negligible and to molecular 
stresses IJi > IJib (T 1)' Furthermore the method does not permit the solution of a 
problem inherent to all ESR measurements; namely to determine whether the abso-
lute concentration of broken bonds is equal to one half the observed concentration 
of free radicals or whether it is (much) larger. 
To overcome this difficulty Zhurkov and his collaborators began in 1965 to 
study by an independant method, the IR technique, the effect of axial stress on 
molecular chains [4-16]. Subsequently similar [35, 37-40] infra-red studies were 
carried out in the USA. All these investigations are based on the fact that frequency 
and intensity of skeletal or backbone vibrations of chain segments respond to a 
superimposed deformation of the vibrating skeleton. In polypropylene for example 
C-C stretch vibration modes have been assigned [16, 36,41, 42] to the parallel 
dichroic bands (Fig. 8.1) at 1326, 1168, 1045,975,842,456, and 398 cm- l . All 
of these bands have been found to be stress sensitive [36]. The stress effect manifests 
itself as a shift of the frequency of maximum absorption and in the occurrence of a 
"tail" at longer wavelengths (Fig. 8.2). 
The mechanisms of the distortion of IR absorption bands of stressed polymers 
have been discussed especially by Gubanov [7-9], Kosobukin [13], Vettegren and 
Novak [15] and Wool [36]. There is a general agreement that the distorted IR absorp-
tion band profile D(v) can be related to a large number of separate oscillators with 
strongly overlapping absorption bands whose maxima are shifted by different amounts. 
The possible causes of the frequency shift of an individual stressed oscillator have 
been considered to be the quasielastic deformation of the harmonic oscillator (re-
duction of force constant under stress), the elastic increase of bond angles, changes 
of segments conformation, and the creation of defects. For small deformations one 
predicts [4-16,36], that for the first three mechanisms there is a quite linear change 
of frequency with molecular stress 1Ji:

Wool and Boy.d [221] have calculated values of 0/ for different vibrations of trio 
methyl octane (TMO) which can be considered as a model substance for a helical 
isotactic PP molecule. They conclude that application of an axial force on the termi-
nal C atoms results in considerable torsion, bending, and bond stretching, the average 
ratios of l::!.C/>/C/> : l::!.OI() : l::!.R/R being 9 : 2.4 : 1. Only anharmonic oscillators gave the 
negative frequency shift which is experimentally observed. The effect of stress and 
temperature on the nature of the frequency shifting (in PP) was further studied by 
Bretzlaff and Wool [222 a]. They found that the only way to interpret the asymmet-
ric wing on a stressed IR band was through the assumption of a distribution of "over-
stresses". These results were also supported by FTIR and Raman Studies of stressed 
ultraoriented polyethylene [222d]. They found that the Raman active C-C-stretching 
modes at 1030 cm-1 and 1160 cm-1 shifted with calculated frequency shifts using 
the anharmonic Morse potential function. The observed magnitudes of the frequency 
shifts for the CH2 rocking, bending, wagging and stretching modes were also in agree-
ment with their calculations. From the potential energy function of the polyethylene 
chain Ec was determined as 267 GPa (which is in reasonably good agreement with 
the value of 290 GPa used in this monograph). Wool also showed [222 e] that the 
fracture stress of PE should be 45.5 GPa with an activation energy of about 112 kJ / 
mol. 
As discussed previously molecular stresses are a function of molecular strains 
which depend on sample morphology and chain orientation. Any real sample, there-
fore, contains a variety of differently stressed oscillators. The profile of the deformed 
band, D(v}, representing such a system of oscillators can be expressed by a convolu-
tion integral: 
00 
D(v) = f F(n}U(v - n} dn. 
(8.2) 
203 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
Here F (n) is the distribution of stressed oscillators, U (v) the shape of the nor· 
malized undeformed band, and n an integration variable. The distribution F (v) can 
be obtained by deconvolution and transformed into a molecular stress distribution 
by Eq. (8.1). 
As already indicated and shown in Figure 8.2 the distribution of molecular 
stresses in semicrystalline polymers contains a peak of apparently homogeneously 
stressed chain segments - related to the crystalline regions - and a tail of very dif-
ferently stressed chains - related to highly stressed tie segments. For a regular sand-
wich structure of crystalline regions having a modulus Ec and a chain axis orientation 
described by cos () one observes a frequency shift .lv of the crystalline peak: 
(8.3) 
Thus, the experimental frequency shifting coefficient, a, depends on orientation, 
temperature, morphology, deformation rate and incident beam polarization [222c]. 
As shown in Fig. 8.3 quite different a values have been observed for identical bands 
in different polypropylene samples [36]. 
The 1168 cm -1 band of the same polymer has an even larger stress sensitivity of 
10 cm- 1 per GPa [15]. For the 930 cm-1 band ofPA 6 a values of 2.2 [15, 16] and 
3.7 cm- 1 /GPa [223] have been reported; for the 974 cm-1 band ofPETP a ranged 
from 3.6-6 [15, 16] to 8.4 cm- 1 /GPa [223]. For the latter band depending on sample 
treatment Mocherla and Statton find stress sensitivity values of 12 to 20 cm-1 per 
GN/m2 [40]. More recently both authors [16,223] have obtained a stress sensitivi-
ty value of 8 cm-1 per GN/m2 at 1350 cm-1 for polyacrylonitrile. 
In the tail region of the "stressed 975 cm -1 band" of PP frequency shifts of up 
to 35 cm-1 are discernible which correspond to molecular stresses up to 12 GN/m2 . 
Although the significance and dynamics of "stressed-IR" investigations are not yet 
understood in full detail a number of interesting observations have been made:

the straining of preoriented (PE, PP, PETP) samples initially leads to the expected 
decrease of gauche-isomers [178, 223-225]; 
overstressed segments begin to appear (in PETP) at a stage of further sample de-
formation where the rate of gauche-trans transitions diminishes considerably [223];

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
the integrated area of a deformed band (975 cm- 1 PP) remained constant with 
a increasing from 0 to 700 MN/m2 [5] indicating that no new oscillators had been 
created under stress; 
the area fraction in that band related to overstressed segments increased with 
stress to 15% at a = 400 MN/m2 and 18% at 490 MN/m2 [12]; for the 1170 cm-1 
band an area fraction of 6% was reported [16] together with 4% [223] and 15% 
[16] for PETP (976 cm-1), and 7% for PA 6 (930 cm-1), all at a stress of 
500 MN/m2; 
it is interesting to note that the segment density l/q L for PP segments of 5 nm 
length amounts to 56 . 1019 segments per cm3 of which 15% or 8.5' 10 19 
segments/cm3 would be overstressed at a = 400 MN/m2 ; 
at a constant stress level this tail area is directly proportional to the content of 
non-crystalline material, i.e. the overloaded segments seem to be contained in 
the amorphous regions [5]; 
the tail regions of the deformed bands (930 cm- I PA 6; 970 cm- I PETP; 
975 cm- 1 PP) show fairly well defined limits at the lower frequency end corre-
sponding to fairly well defined limits of sustained molecular stress 1/1; these limits 
are determined [6, 15, 16] to be 11-13 GN/m2 in PP, 15-20 GN/m2 in PETP 
(lavsan), 8 GN/m2 in PAN and 16 to 20 GN/m2 in PA 6; 
with some samples [12, 24, 25] these limits are already reached at moderate 
macroscopic stresses smaller than 50% of sample strength; in other samples the 
limits are only attained at a stress level close to the breaking stresses [16]; 
more recently Vettegren et aI. [384,385] advanced an extremely interestingdilaton 
theory: the overstressed bonds are found in those regions which are temporarily 
expanded by fluctuating thermal energy. 
Figure 8.4 reproduces the results of Vettegren et al. [16] on the maximum stresses 
on molecular segments for three morphologically different samples each of PP 
and PETP; the - non-specified - morphological differences do not seem to effect 
the limiting stress value; in samples a) the largest molecular stress concentration

I~ 
(l/Im/a) is larger than in b) or c) but in all three samples it is apparently extremely 
homogeneous as indicated by the fact that the maximum value of l/I m is only 
reached at the maximum of a; this behavior ties in with the observation [5] that 
the deformation of a band (975 cm -1 PP) of a highly drawn sample (X = 10) is 
much less than that of a sample drawn to X = 5; 
the observed molecular stress limit is also a function of temperature; in PETP 
Zhurkov et aI. [6] determined a decrease from 22 GN/m2 at 100 K to 15 GN/m2 
at 400 K (on the basis that the observed molecular stress limits correspond to the 
chain strengths l/Ib and using WO/kb = 48 . 1012 S-l as for PA 6 segments one 
derives an activation volume of 11.7 . 10-6 m3/mol and an activation energy 
Uo = 316 kl/mol for the PETP segments); from later experiments Vettegren 
et aI. [16] obtained activation volums of 13.2 . 10-6 m3/mol for PETP, 
15.0' 10-6 m3/mol for PA 6 and 15.6 . 10-6 m3/mol for PP; 
the dichroism of a band permits the determination of the average degree of orien-
tation (cos2 8) of loaded chain segments; Zhurkov et al. [5] found for a PETP 
with cos2 8 = 0.75 that the most highly stressed segments approached cos2 8 = 
= 1, i.e. complete uniaxial orientation (Fig. 8.5); 
the distribution of molecular stresses in PP varies during deformation (creep) 
and stress relaxation as indicated by the different time dependent intensity 
changes of fixed frequencies in the deformed part of the spectrum (dynamic 
polarized IR studies [6, 35]) 
creep deformation tends to increase the highly loaded chain area of the 975 cm- 1 
band in PP at the expense of intermediately stressed segments [6, 35] further 
supporting the hypothesis that the band deformation is indeed due to a shift of 
frequencies and not to a creation of new oscillators

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
stress relaxation after shock loading of highly oriented PP showed an initial 10 
to 70 s period of fast decay at practically constant degree of crystal orientation 
[35] as evidenced by the absorption of the 899 cm- 1 band which is a highly 
dichroic, crystalline or "helix" band [43]; at later times a "steady state" relaxa-
tion takes place which is accompanied by a decrease of absorption of the 
899 cm- 1 band indicating a decrease of crystallinity or of helical regularity 
[35]; 
in shock loading PP (e.g. up to a strain of 10.5% in less than 0.1 s) the largest 
absorption at 955 cm- 1 is observed after t = 69 s when considerable stress re-
laxation has occurred whereas in ramp loading at a rate of 10%/min the largest 
absorption is attained at the maximum of stress at 10.5% strain; the largest 
increase in intensity at 955 cm- 1 is (3.2 times) larger in shock loading than in 
ramp loading [38]; the molecular stress transfer in this highly o·riented PP, there-
fore, is a viscoelastic process involving the deformation of the amorphous regions 
and the resistance to uncoiling of helices; Wool [39] has carried out a detailed 
experimental and computational analysis of stress relaxation, dynamic IR be-
havior and bond rupture; he concluded that different stress sensitivity values 
for crystalline regions (2.1 cm- 1 per GN/m2 ) and individual chains (8 cm- 1 
per GN/cm2 ) should be employed, that the most highly stressed chains 
(952 cm- 1 ) relax first thus contributing to the increase in intensity at higher 
frequencies (e.g. 955 and 960 cm- 1), and that bond scission will be negligible 
if its activation energy Uo is equal to or larger than 121 kJ/mol (29 kcal/mol); 
with Uo = 105 kJ/mol very little chain scission occurs (affecting IR tail inten-
sities by less than 0.3%), with 84 kJ/mol the majority and with Uo = 63 kJ/mol 
(15 kcal/mol) all of the overloaded chains are expected to break; in his PP 
material chain scission did not seem to contribute measurably to the relaxation 
phenomena, this argument was backed by the observation that the absorption 
bands characteristic for chain-end groups remained constant within 0.5% [39]; 
on the other hand in the PP material of Vettegren et al. [16] stress relaxation 
at 100°C was accompanied by the measurable appearance of chain-end groups. 
The dynamic IR behavior ofPETP has been investigated by Mocherla et al. [40). 
Apart from the already discussed stress effects the authors observed the existence of 
an initial region of small stresses (up to 70 MN/m2) within which stress effects (on 
the 973 cm- 1 band ofPETP) were absent. They concluded from extended studies 
of differently heat-treated films that this initial region coincides with the range of 
elastic response of the sample; obviously small elastic stresses are predominantly 
transmitted by secondary forces not giving rise to axial distortion of the chains. 
Summarizing the above results from this important method one may say that in 
(highly) oriented samples a fraction of some 4 to 18% of the amorphous chain seg-
ments supports chain stresses .l/I which are up to twenty times larger than the average 
sample stress o. There are upper limits of molecular stress which in the case of poly-
amide 6 seem to be given by the chain strength (21 GN/m2 ). On the other hand the 
upper limit of molecular stresses in the highly, uniaxially oriented polypropylene 
material of Wool is due to the inception of a distortion of helical chain conforma-
tions and of crystal lamellae. In that case no bond breakages could be traced. 
207 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
In loading their oriented PP films Zhurkov, Vettegren et al. [6-16] observed, 
however, that an initially present concentration of 1-10 .1018 carbonyl groups 
per cm3 increased [24]. They found this increase and the formation of other end 
groups (see below) related to the decrease of the number of overloaded chains [16]. 
The Russian authors concluded from the equality of the activation energies of ther-
mal and mechanical destruction of their PP films (29 kcal/mol) with that of end-
group accumulation (30 kcal/mol) that the kinetics of all three processes is con-
trolled by the same molecular process, the thermomechanical scission of chain seg-
ments. According to the calculations of Wool, chain scission should practically never 
occur in PP if Uo is equal to 29 kcal/mol. Those calculations, however, most prob-
ably refer to a constant temperature in the network of loaded and overloaded 
chains. Consideration of the large strain energy release at chain breakage would lead 
to the adjustment that local temperatures T are higher than the ambient temperature 
To and that the effective chain strengths, l/Ib(T), are smaller than l/Ib(To). It seems 
likely, therefore, that the phenomenological observations do not contradict each 
other especially taking into account possible structural differences of the PP samples 
of the laboratories. 
The upper limits of molecular stresses deduced for PETP (15-20 GN/m2) and 
PAN (8 GN/m2) were also related to chain breakage by the Russian authors [16]. 
With these materials, however, no comparable results on scission products (end groups, 
free radicals) have been reported. It must be concluded, therefore, that in these cases 
as with the PP material of Wool the upper stress limit seems to derive from the limit-
ed resistance of the crystal lamellae against distortion and break-up. 
The latter conclusion is supported by the investigations of Becht and Kausch 
[44-48] concerning the deformation of highly oriented semicrystalline fibers. In a 
regular sandwich structure critical axial forces can be exerted onto tie segments if, 
and only if, the crystal lamellae can withstand stresses up to the chain strength. Other-
wise crystal disintegration would precede chain scission. Using the spin probe tech-
nique, calorimetry and molecular weight measurements Becht [44-47] demon-
strated the strain effect on crystal integrity. He irradiated samples of highly oriented 
6 PA, 12 PA, PP, PETP, and PE by I-Mev electrons at liquid nitrogen temperature. 
Subsequently, all samples were heated to their glass-transition-temperature (or 
above) for at least 5 minutes; thus, all radicals in the amorphous phase disap-
peared, and radicals remained within the crystallites only. These samples were then 
strained within the cavity of an ESR spectrometer at room temperature. 
The rate-determining steps of the radical-decay reactions in these cases are trans-
fer reactions and oxygen diffusion. They are both very strongly correlated with the 
mobility of the radical-carrying molecular segments with respect to their surroundings, 
i.e., the crystal lattice. An increase in these rate constants, therefore, is a measure of 
an increase in mobility, which may be due to a decrease in intermolecular attraction 
and/or to the introduction of new crystal defects. 
In Figure 8.6, the concentration of free radicals is plotted versus a reduced time 
Ko~t, where Ko is the rate of radical decay at zero strain and ~t is the time elapsed 
from the inception of sample straining. It should be noted that in PE, PP, PETP, and 
12 PA, the application of sample strain has a twofold result: an immediate and ir-
reversible decrease of the (crystalline) radical popUlation and a stress-dependent re-

versible increase in the rate of decay. In 6 PA neither of these two effects can be 
observed, It was concluded from this experiment that in strained 6 PA, the tie mole-
cules fail before axial chain stresses are reached which are sufficient to distort the 
crystal lamellae. In PE, PP, PETP, and 12 PA, however, forces can be transmitted 
which clearly affect the crystal lamellae. It is logical to assume that these forces are 
primarily transmitted by the tie segments. One would have to conclude that the 
axial load bearing capability of microfibrils of PE, PP, PETP and 12 PA is limited 
through the beginning crystal distortion. Thus chain strengths are not fully utilized 
in these polymers. 
Still another combination of chain and crystal properties seems to exist in the 
PE films used by Vettegren et al. [15-18] for their end-group studies. Under stress 
vinyl, methyl, and oxygen-containing end groups formed readily and in large con-
centrations while no stress effects on IR bands were reported. 
C. Spatially Homogeneously Distributed Chain Scissions 
1. As Analyzed by I R Technique 
The scission of molecular chains generally leads to highly reactive chain end 
radicals and eventually to the formation of new end groups (cf. Chapters 6 and 7). 
Unless oxygen is excluded the following end groups are formed most frequently: 
methyl, aldehyde, ester, carbonyl, carboxyl, or vinyl groups. All of these groups 
have characteristic IR absorption bands (Table 8.1). Based on this consideration Zhur-
kov and his collaborators quantitatively investigated the build-up of new groups in 
loaded polymer films (16-18,22-26]. They employed a double beam technique 
the principle of which is illustrated in Figure 8.7. The optical densities D = Qn 10/1 
ofa stressed (0) and an unstressed reference film (r) are compared:

With the advent of computer aided IR spectroscopy the difference spectroscopy 
(be it in transmission, reflexion, or dispersion) has gained considerably through the 
ease of manipulation and the increased sensitivity [226-230]. Nevertheless, in inter-
preting the lines appearing positively or negatively in a difference spectrum some par-
ticularities of method or sample must be taken into consideration. Thus, the limited 
signal/noise ratio and differences in sample thickness and homogeneity, and in the 
physical state (orientation, phase separation) cause and influence the obtained dif-
ference spectrum even if the chemical composition of the compared samples is iden-
tical [227 -230]. Figure 8.8 shows one of the first difference spectra recorded by 
Zhurkov et a1. [17, 18] from a polyethylene film ruptured at room temperature. The 
spectra have been evaluated with respect to the kinetics of accumulation of new groups. 
It must be underlined that Zhurkov and his collaborators interpreted the appearance

of these new groups to be the direct result of chain scission, each chain scission event 
giving initially rise to two free radicals and subsequently to two new "end" groups. 
However, since some of these groups are formed by a chain of radical reactions with 
oxygen no quantitative transformation is guaranteed. A chain-end radical which 
transforms into a peroxy radical could easily react with a neighboring segment: 
. 
. 
R CHX + O2 ---* R CHXOO 
R CHXOO + R'CH2 R" ---* R CHXOOH + R'CH R 
(formation of a polymer 
hydroperoxide) 
(propagation reaction) 
It is well documented [208 b] that the latter free radical continues the reaction 
chain multiplying the number of newly formed, oxygen-containing groups which are 
not indicative of a primary chain scission event. The same is true for some stress-ac-
tivated ozone reactions which could give rise to the formation of oxygen-containing 
groups and which do not involve primary chain scission. This mechanism has recently 
been studied by Zaikov et al. [356], it will be discussed in Section 8 III B 1. It follows 
from these observations that the kinetics of accumulation and the concentration of 
"IR-groups" will, to a certain extent, be influenced by the nature and kinetics of the 
multiplication reaction. This should be kept in mind in the following discussion; it 
may explain some of the discrepancies which exist with respect to the concentra-
tions of defects at fracture determined by different methods (see Section C2 and 
Table 8.3). 
Subjecting uniaxially oriented films to uniaxial loads Zhurkov et al. [16-18, 
22-26] measured by such a technique the accumulation of aldehyde groups in high 
pressure and low pressure polyethylene and in polypropylene after predetermined 
loading intervals. Typical results are reproduced in Figure 8.9. The concentration 
C(t) of aldehyde-end groups increased with loading time according to a first-order 
kinetic equation: 
C(t) = C* (l-exp-Kt)

with rate constant K and apparent concentration C* of mechanically excitable -

only slightly on temperature and stress (changes from 1 to 4· 1019 cm-3 for stres-
ses between 180 and 500 MN/m2 at temperatures between -70°C and +20 0c) 
whereas the rate "constants" K varied by several orders of magnitude (Fig_ 8_10). 
The authors noted that the rate constant K for accumulation of end groups was 
governed by an effective, stress-dependent activation energy E* which is plotted in

The activation energies EA and activation volumes (X* for the three polymer 
films investigated are listed in Table 8.2 together with the preexponential factorsKo. 
In these experiments the authors also observed that the concentration of end 
groups at break for a series of specimens did not depend on stress, temperature, or 
type of loading (Fig. 8.12). The apparent "critical concentration" of all newly formed 
end groups in PE-HD amounted to 3.9.10+19 cm- 3 or to ~ 2· 10+19 bond ruptures 
per cm3 . Vettegren et al. [70,383] estimate that in a surface layer of 1 ~m thick-
ness the concentration of end groups may even be higher by a factor of 20 to 60. 
For polypropylene they derived concentrations of 6· 1019 cm-3 broken bonds in 
the surface layer - as compared to 0.25 - 0.40· 1019 cm-3 reported by Zhurkov 
et al. [17, 18] for the interior of the film. The latter value should be compared with 
the number of overloaded 5 nm segments. In Section I B a concentration of 
8.5· 1019 cm- 3 overloaded segments had been determined from the area of the 
tail region of the "stressed IR band". Such a comparison indicates that of

roscopic fracture. In another study on PP [25) a concentration of broken bonds 
of 3 . 1019 cm- 3 is reported, i.e. a fraction of 35% of the overloaded bonds is broken 
throughout the total volume of the sample. In the latter case wholesale destruction 
of the polymer must have occurred since on the average each molecule in a (mono-
disperse) Mn = 50000 g/mol sample would have been broken 2.5 times. In the for-
mer case the effect is ten times smaller, but Mn is still reduced to 40000 g/mol and 
Mw to 43750 g/mol. The fracture criterion derived for the three polymer ftlms on 
the basis of the kinetics of thermal and mechanical destruction and of end-group 
formation was that of a critical concentration of newly broken chains [16-18). In 
later publications this model has been varied and enlarged. Thus it was proposed 
[384-388) that the overstressed bonds are due to density fluctuations (dilatons) ex-
tending over hundreds and thousands of atoms. When these regions disintegrate they 
should give rise to "fracture-nucleating" submicrocracks. 
The IR-technique has also been applied to polymer stress effects by other labo-
ratories particularly in the USA [231-237) and in Germany [228). Whereas it was 
generally qualitatively confirmed that in stressed ftlms new groups, especially car-
bonyl and vinyl groups, do appear, none of the laboratories was able to repeat the 
detailed kinetic analysis. In view of the fact that the detection of an intensity dif-
ference requires for most bands about 1019 new groups [238-240), one realizes that 
for stress induced defects the IR technique operates at the limits of detectability -
especially if chain scission is accompanied by structural changes. In the following 
the absolute number of chain scission events and its effect on fracture progress will 
have to be discussed. 
. 
2. Final Concentration of Chain Scission Events as Determined by Different 
Techniques 
The breakage of a highly stressed chain can potentially be traced in several ways: 
-
through the formed free radicals 
after radical reaction through new end-groups 
-
through the ensuing molecular weight reduction 
-
through the energy irreversibly dispersed in (repeated) mechanical loading.

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
If the number of breaking chain segments is as large as indicated by the IR 
group analysis arid if each segment breaks at the limiting stress value derived from 
the analysis ofdeformed-IR bands then the accumulated molecular stresses would 
be comparable within an order of magnitude to the applied macroscopic stress. 
In that case it must be assumed that apart from conformational rearrangements and 
chain slippage chain scission events noticeably influence observed stress-strain curves. 
So far the PP material from Leningrad is the only polymer which has lent itself suc-
cessfully to both of the above mentioned IR analysis. In the cited literature [4-33] 
there is no reference to an attempt to explain stress-strain or stress-time data of this 
PP material on the basis of its end group-formation kinetics. 
As discussed frequently within this text stress-relaxation data can not and must 
not be related solely to chain scission [2-52]. Attempts have been forwarded, how-
ever, to explain the stress-strain curves of polyamide-6 [49-51] and PEOB fibers 
[52] on the basis of free radical production kinetics. In these models the concept 
was employed that tie segments show a distribution of relative lengths. The (taut-
ness) distribution, N(L/Lo), was assumed to remain unchanged in a wide time-tem-
perature regime. As detailed in Chapter 5, a tie-chain segment will respond to a strain 
fa predominantly rubber-elastically if fa < (L-Lo)/Lo, it will break if fa> (1 + l/Jb/ 
Ek)L/Lo - 1, and it will respond energy-elastically in the intermediate region where 
it happens to be fully extended and subcritically loaded. From these considerations 
a homogeneous four-phase model can be derived (Fig. 8.13). It is based on the assump-
tion that a highly oriented semi-crystalline fiber can be represented by crystalline 
and amorphous regions in series with the latter consisting of three fractions, i.e. of 
the fully extended segments, of the non-extended tie-c,hains, and of the remaining 
matrix (folds, ciliae, broken chains). Once the strain-dependent widths of the frac-
tions are obtained from a relative segment length distribution and appropriate moduli 
are assigned to the individual phases a stress-strain curve can be constructed. Such a 
procedure was proposed in 1971 by DeVries and Williams [49]. It has been executed 
by lloyd [50] and by Klinkenberg [51] for PA 6 fibers and by Nagamura et al. [52]

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
for PEOB multi-filaments. The calculated stress-strain curves can be made to fit the 
stress-strain response of virgin material; they contain as possible sources of uncer-
tainty the choice of the "elastic" moduli and of the number and distribution of tie-
segment lengths, i.e. ofN(L/Lo). The choice of the form ofN(L/Lo) determines 
which number of segment lengths is assigned to the fraction of non-extended chain 
segments by way of extrapolation. Lloyd [50] and Nagamura et al. [52] have chosen 
a normal distribution to represent N(L/Lo). 
A fit of observed and calculated stress-strain curves of first and second stretching 
cycles was obtained if the calculated number of radicals formed (or of chains broken) 
was taken as considerably larger than the observed number. Nagamura et al. [52] 
report a factor fc of 40 for PEOB fibers, Klinkenberg [51] of 20 for PA 6 fibers. 
If one wishes to explain such a discrepancy while maintaining the basic model 
one is forced to make additional assumptions: 
-
either the number of broken chains is systematically larger by fc than the number 
of observed radicals, e.g. due to a Zakrewskii-mechanism [20] to be discussed 
later; 
-
or the breakage of N 1 chains in a particular volume element leads to the preferen-
tial unloading of fc N 1 extended chains; this amounts to the consideration of a 
microfibrillar substructure; 
In recent years this question has been further discussed on the basis of more ex-
tended comparative studies also including molecular weight measurements [220, 
231-238,241-246]. Thus, Gaur [241] and Frank and Wendorff [243] analyzed the 
stress-strain behavior ofPA 6 filaments (Fig. 8.14). They determined the amount of 
energy Wirr irreversibly diSSipated by defect formation in a first load cycle <D in Fig. 
8.14), the viscous energy diSSipation ® and the elastically stored energy®. They 
observed that almost up to fracture there was a linear correlation between Wirr and

free radical concentration [R'] with a ratio of 15 . 10-18 J spin-I. They also noted 
that the inflection point of the stress-strain curve coincided with the beginning of the 
free radical production (Fig. 8.15). For this material and some other PA fibers Frank 
[238] also gave the decrease in molecular weight provoked by chain scission during 
straining up to -20% (Table 8.3). 
In the following it will be attempted to reconcile some of the above, contradic-
tory observations. To do so the model developped in Chapter 7 will be used. Thus, it 
will be assumed that the above defects are essentially located within the microfibrils. 
As indicated in Chapters 2 and 7 the microfibrils can be modelled as a series arrange-
ment of crystalline and amorphous regions, where the latter are traversed by highly 
extended tie molecules of various degrees of tautness. The fraction of taut tie mole-
cules in PA 6 has been estimated by Friedland et al. [247] from analysis of the 
stress effect on IR absorption bands to vary between 0.03 and 0.05; more recently 
Zhizhenkov and Egorov [248] proposed, on the basis of NMR results, values between 
0.04 and 0.10 depending on sample preparation. The mechanical estimates of Mishra 
et al. [249], who deduced from a Takayanagi model tie-chain fractions of between 
0.05 (at draw ratio 2.5) and 0.20 (at 4.5) seem to be somewhat high (see also [397]). 
The careful X-ray studies of Frank [238] have again confirmed that (at room 
temperature) the macroscopic strains Ef also apply to the change of the long period L 
of the microfibrils. In view of the large longitudinal stiffness of the crystalline layers 
(Ec = 183 GN m-2 ) and at a degree of crystallinity of 50% one easily calculates the 
strain Ea of the amorphous regions to be: 
~La 
~L -

Ea = La =

O.5L 
= 2Ef(1 - 0.5 Ec/Ef) -

(8.7) 
Ea is also indicated in the abszissa of Figure 8.14. It should be kept in mind that the as-
sumption of a homogeneous strain within the molecularly quite heterogeneous amor-
phous regions is restricted to distances of the order of 5 nm and is essentially based 
on the large lateral stiffness of the crystalline regions. It becomes clear from Figure 
8.14 that there are two regions of mechanical response of a microfibril: the small strain 
217 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
region with €a < 0.08 and the large-strain region with €a > 0.15. Frank carefully in-
vestigated this response. For fibers held at 50% relative humidity, he measured in a 
first load cycle an initial modulus El of 4.6 GN m -2; taking into consideration the 
existence of an intermicrofibrillar amorphous fraction of 0.4 he deduced in his PhD 
thesis for the micro fibrils a modulus of the amorphous regions of El a = 2.88 GN m-2 
In a second load cycle he obtained E2 = 1.80 GN m -2 and E2 a = 1.13 GN m -2 . He 
also determined the moduli of humidity saturated amorphous regions as El ah = 
1.00 GN m-2 and E2ah = 0.75 GN m-2. The decrease of the elastic modulus after a 
first load cycle is a common observation and has correctly been explained by the 
"destruction of some structure" [see e.g. 238, 249]. 
The following molecular interpretation can be given to the observed small-strain 
behavior. In this region stress is essentially transmitted in a continuous manner [391] 
through the hydrogen-bond coupled segments; the elastic modulus decreases with 
strain [238,249] due to the gradual destruction of hydrogen bonds with segment de-
formation and orientation. If some completely extended segments should be present 
within the amorphous regions at zero strain, their number must be extremely small 
so as not to change the strain softening behavior. 
In a second region, (0.08 < €a < 0.20), Ea increases and this behavior is deter-
mined by the combined entropy- and ener.gy-elastic loading of fairly extended tie 
chains [238, 242, 247-251). The stressing of a partly extended chain of contour 
length 4 provokes to some extent conformational transitions towards an all-trans con-
formation; evidently, it depends on the nature and intensity of the intennolecular 
interactions whether entropy- or energy-elastic behavior prevails in this region. 
If it is assumed that within a strained amorphous region a chain is at first fully 
extended and only thereafter strained elastically then energy elastic chain stresses t/Ji 
will only be built up in "taut" chains whose contour length 4 is smaller than La(1 +€a): 
(8.8) 
Given an amorphous strain €a of 20% and a chain stiffness Ek of 200 GN m-2 , 
one arrives at the result that t/Ji of chains with 4 ~ 1.086 La exceeds the chain 
strength of 21 GN m -2, they must break. As has been shown in detail in Chapter 5 
the condition 4 ~ 1.086 La is equivalent to demanding that there are 5 or less gtgt 
kinks in an otherwise all-trans planar segment. Such highly extended chain segments 
do exist in PA fibers and they start breaking at about these strains (€a>20%). In their 
publications Frank and Wendorff give values of 1.5 . 10-17 [243] and 4.4 . 10-17 
J /spin [238] for the ratio of irreversibly dissipated energy and free radical concen-
tratioll which corresponds to an energy dissipation of 18 and 60 mJ per mol of chain 
scission events. These values are 20 to 69 times larger than the value of 870 kJ mol-1 
to be calculated in Section E for the scission of highly stressed amorphous chains of 
5 nm length solidly anchored in two opposite crystal lamellae. A small portion of this 
difference can be ascribed to the fact that the chain segments breaking towards the 
end of the loading are longer than 5 nm; they will, therefore, contain (up to 15%) 
more elastic energy. The major portion of the energy difference, however, will have 
to be sought elsewhere. Frank et al. propose that the free radical concentration deter-
mined by ESR is not a correct measure of the number of chain scission events since 
218 

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
rapid radical recombination or chain scission without radical formation may occur. 
In that case, one chain scission event would not give rise to two free radicals seen by 
ESR but to a smaller number. Their hypothesis is based on the evaluation of the 
(slight) decrease in molecular weight Mn of their samples after rupture (Table 8.3). 
This may be perfectly true. But even then it is claimed that the principal source 
of energy dissipation is the stress-induced conformational transition of partly extended 
chains containing a few double kinks. The annihilation of a double kink would increase 
the end-to-end distance of a chain segment by ilL = 0.26 nm. If the segment had been 
subjected to 5 GN m-2 then an energy dissipation of 0.25 . 10-18 J/segment would 
be observed (Friedland et al. even estimate that the average stress on the highly 
stressed bonds in PA 6 is 10 GN/m2 which would correspond to an energy dissipa-
tion of I . 10-18 J per relaxing segment). 
The above data may now be correlated with each other. In the amorphous regions 
at 32% strain one determines by ESR that 4.1017 (out of 1021 ) chains/cm3 are bro-
ken. If each detected chain event would trigger between 120 and -400 conforma-
tional transitions then the overall dissipated energy would exactly correspond to that 
measured by Frank. It seems to be quite realistic to expect such a number of rear-
rangements. From 10000 amorphous chain segments of 5 nm length 300 to about 
1000 would classify as taut chains (IR [247], NMR [248], and mechanical [249] 
data); only four of these taut chains would be "seen" by ESR as being broken up to 
sample fracture; but even if Frank's hypothesis is correct that 10 times more chains 
are broken than are registered by ESR, the dominant role of viscoelastic processes in 
the deformation of highly extended chains is still maintained [242]. In this case the 
loading of a hydrogen bonded chain segment causes in this order the break-up of hy-
drogen bonds, the entropy and energy-elastic stressing of the segment in a highly 
oriented microfibril leading to stress-induced transitions towards a higher extended 
conformation and, if the stress level exceeds chain strength, chain scission. 
On the basis of the above model some comments may be made with respect to 
the other defect concentrations indicated in Table 8.3. The comparative IR measure-
ments by DeVries et al. [233] seem to confirm that ESR radical concentrations are 
systematically lower than IR group concentrations. For PE those authors determined 
that [R·] was by a factor of2 to 5 smaller. Molecular weight analysis shows that mac-
roscopic fracture leads to roughly a 10% decrease in molecular weight Mn. In random 
scission this corresponds to the breakage of every tenth molecule or of 0.3% of all 
segments of 5 nm length. These values are compatible with the mechanical model 
given above. However, as indicated by Nernzek et al. [235], the form of the molecular 
weight distribution may influence Ml1 values by up to 20%, so that ilMl1 values may 
have to be corrected. Undoubtedly further progress is to be expected in the domain 
of molecular weight determinations so that more precise data will become available. 
At this time the best interpretation of the sometimes contradictory data on defect 
concentration is offered by an analysis of the experiments of DeVries et al. [233, 
235]. It is noted that the discrepancies between ESR, IR, and Ml1 data are small, if 
the defects are produced rapidly (grinding) and at low temperatures. Under those 
conditions a modest loss of ESR tniced free radicals occurs (perhaps of the order of 
one half) and only a modest multiplication of IR groups takes place (by a factor of 
about 1.3). However, if more time is allowed for defect production and, consequently,

for radical reactions the discrepancies between different data increase considerably 
(Table 8.3 and recent observations by SZQCS [423]). 
It should be mentioned that the absolute number of chain breakages at fracture 
is small. Thus, it is not surprising that the load bearing capability of the fiber material 
outside of the immediate fracture zone does not necessarily suffer. Prevorsek [53] 
showed that the strengths of fiber sections subjected repeatedly to breaking loads 
did not decrease. The two ruptured portions obtained in a first loading exhibited a 
larger strength than the original fiber and maintained this strength in subsequent load-
ings (Fig. 8.16). 
3. Significance of Chain Length Distributions 
One word of caution must be said with respect to the extrapolation of the seg-
ment length distribution N(L/Lo) into the unknown regions of L/Lo. For this pur-
pose DeVries et al. [49, 50] and Nagamura et al. [51] used the assumption that the 
"visible" part of the segment length distribution (Fig. 7.14) constitutes the skewed 
part of a normal distribution. A plot of the skewed distribution on probability 
coordinates (Fig. 7.15) apparently does not disprove the contention made. They had 
derived the parameters of the normal distribution (mean, variance) using the existence 
and location of an inflection point in the - always only partially known - cumula-
tive distribution. It cannot be excluded that such inflection points result from the 
increased unloading of microfibril ends at larger strains since the stress-transfer length 
Le of a micro-fibril (with modulus Ef , diameter d) increases in case of perfect inter-
fibrillar adhesion (of streJ;lgth T) with Le = Erdr€/2T. The eventual error of an extra-
polation of N(L/Lo) into the range of not fully - or even slightly -loaded segments 
is of not too much importance in calculating accumulated molecular stresses. It is 
of importance, however, ifthe distribution N(L/Lo) is used to derive a fracture 
221 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
criterion. A fracture criterion [252] in which macroscopic failure coincides with 
breakage of the last tie segment of the total distribution must be ruled out. Against 
such a fracture criterion the above mentioned argument holds that at the point of 
macroscopic failure 99.7% of all tie-segments are still unbroken (see also Fig. 7.6, 
Sect. I C 2 and refs. [395,397]). 
Although DeVries, Lloyd, and Williams [49, 50] work with a normal distribu-
tion of relative chain lengths they do not put it to a full and questionable use. Their 
assumptions may be reformulated on the basis of the above considerations. It is 
assumed 1. that the segment length distribution N(L/Lo) - derived from spatially 
homogeneous chain scission events of virgin material - be representative for the 
homogeneity of molecular stress distribution in any average amorphous region of 
the fiber, 2. that an initially narrow distribution continues to rise sharply with seg-
ment length and 3. that the complete break-down of tie segments Within micro-
fibrillar amorphous regions be restricted to a comparatively small fracture zone 
which does not contribute measurably to the free radical population. They use the 
widths of their chain length distributions N(L/Lo) and correlate it with macroscopic 
strength (Fig. 8.17). In other words they correlate the non-homogeneity of the 
molecular stress distribution with macroscopic strength - and find a negative cor-
relation.

Fig. 8.17. Correlation of the homogeneity of segment lengths (narrow relative length distribution) 
with uniaxial strength Ob [49,50,541. 
It has been stated frequently in this work that the tie segments which eventually 
break are not the main source of strength of highly oriented fibers. The total number 
of radicals formed at macroscopic fracture does not measure, therefore, the strength 
of the sample. The wide differences in radical concentrations N (R) at break of com-
parably strong fibers (cf. Table 6.2) illustrate this statement. Again these concentra-
tions should be taken only as an indication of the homogeneity of stress distribution 
between different microfibrils and of stress response within different microfibrils. 
The later a possible defect zone starts its accelerated growth the longer the phase of 
spatially homogeneously distributed chain scission and the larger the number of 
222 

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
chains which are loaded up to breakage. If one compares, under this aspect, members 
from one family of samples strength-related conclusions seem to be justified. 
In Chapter 7 the morphological changes in PA 6 fibers due to annealing and 
their effect on chain scission have been discussed. In Figures 7.16 and 7.17 it had 
been indicated that slack annealing is accompanied by a relative lengthening of tie-
segments and by a widening of the length distribution. The indicated losses of homo-
geneity lead to accelerated flaw growth already at stresses lower than those exerted 
on the control sample, i.e. to a loss of strength (Fig. 7.18; "slack"). Annealing at 
fixed fiber ends leads to a certain loss in homogeneity while maintaining the average 
relative segment length. The loss in strength (Fig. 7.19) and in the number N of radicals 
at break (Fig. 7.18) as compared to the control sample is small. This result confirms 
the findings of Levin et al. [21] with highly oriented tensile Kapron annealed at 200°C. 
Annealing under all. 7% prestrain increases the relative segment length (Figs. 7.16 
and 7.17), segment homogeneity (Fig. 7.20), and sample strength (Fig. 7.19). 
The opposing effects of increasing annealing temperature and increasing tensile 
prestrain on segment homogeneity are clearly indicated on Figure 7.20. The concen-
tration NR of radicals at break formed after annealing initially increases with pre-

strain (Fig. 8.18), showing a maximum at a 5% prestrain. At that strain radical forma-
tion in prest raining (Np) starts. The total number of radicals (Np + NR) is approxi-
mately constant in that region. The sample strength increases by 20% up to a maxi-
mum at 7.5% prestrain and decreases slightly thereafter (Fig. 8.18). 
D. Formation of Microcracks 
All of the foregoing considerations have been concerned with a distribution of chain 
scission events homogeneous on a macroscopic scale. The accelerating effects of 
stress concentrations at microstructural inhomogeneities and of mutual interaction 
of scission points have so far been neglected. Such effects were not apparent in the 
discussed IR and ESR investigations of chain rupture; in any event they did not 
prevent tremendous concentrations of scission points being accumulated before 
final fracture. This fact can certainly be taken as an indication that during a con-
siderable period of straining, chain scission points remain isolated "defects" and 
do not give rise to unstable cracks. 
On the other hand the appearance of submicrocracks has been claimed for many 
years by the Leningrad school [17, 18,27,28,254,384-387] which employed X-
ray scattering techniques to search for them. Such submicrocracks were found in 
loaded PE, PP, PVC, PVB, PMMA, and PA 6. The authors noted two important reg-
ularities of the submicrocrack formation [28]. First of all, the submicroscopic cracks 
appear at finite sizes with their transverse dimensions practically independent of load 
duration, stress value, and temperature (Table 8.4). Secondly their transverse size is 
determined by the polymer structure. For oriented crystalline polymers the trans-
verse size coincides with the microfibril diameter; for non-oriented, amorphous poly-
mers having a globular structure it coincides with the diameter of the globules [28]. 
It was claimed that these cracks nucleate fracture [384-387]. 
Two explanations have been given for the formation of these submicrocracks: 
Zakrewskii [20] proposes a radical chain reaction and Peterlin [58] suggests that the 
ends of microfibrils are the crack nuclei.

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
The Zakrewskii-mechanism was proposed by the Russian school following their 
studies of the formation of free radicals and of end-groups. They had noted that 
the concentration of free radicals was either by a factor of 4000 (PE-HD) smaller 
than the concentration of newly formed end-groups or even unmeasurably small 
(PP). This led them to search for a reaction by which chains might break without 
increasing the concentration of free radicals. 
The mechanisIll of the proposed mechano-chemical reaction chain is illustrated 
in Figure 8.19. The thermo-mechanical scission of a iegular covalent bond (a) leads 
to the formation of two chain-end radicals (b). As amply discussed in Chapter 6 the 
latter radicals are highly reactive. They will transform by hydrogen abstraction into 
stable end groups at the same time creating main-chain radicals within neighboring 
chains (c). It is then assumed by Zakrevskii and Zhurkov [17, 20] that the decreased 
energy of activation for the thermal scission reaction of radicalized chains (cf. Chap-
ter 4) also leads to a lower tensile strength of these chains causing them to rupture 
(d). Repetition of the steps c and d would not increase the number of free radicals 
present but would multiply the number of chains broken. In Figure 4.3 the energy 
levels of the proposed steps of the reaction chain are indicated. It should be noted, 
however, that the lowering of the activation energy for scission of a radicalized 
chain is effective only where thermal equilibrium can be established (cf. Chapter 
4 II B).

-CH2-CH-CH2-, • stable end groups e.g. -CH2-CH3. 
The authors suggest [17, 18] that the 3300 new end groups formed per sub-
microcrack in PE-HD (5000 in PP) are created by such a mechanism. Their data in-
dicate also that there is less than a single pair of free radicals available per submicro-
crack (0.4 in HDPE, 0.3 in PA 6 and an immeasurable smail fraction in PP). These 
discrepancies, the unfavorable conditions for thermal equilibrium in the splitting 
reaction, and the absence of a well defined termination of the reaction chain raise 
considerable concern. They make it difficult to believe that such a reaction is the 
major reason for the formation of sub microcracks which remain fairly stable during 
extended and repeated loading periods [220]. 
Peterlin [58] has based his proposal on the origin of sub microcracks on mor-
phological considerations and analysis of the previously mentioned X-ray data 
225 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
[17 -21,27]. He suggests that the ends of microfibrils, preferentially situated on the 
outer surface of the fibrils, retract under stress (Fig. 8.20). In low strength PA 6 they 
thus open up about 1016 oblate spheroids per cm3 having 6 nm diameter in fiber 
axis direction and 10 nm in the perpendicular direction. He estimates that the num-
ber and size of cracks in high strength polyamide is considerably smaller and is in 
agreement with the much higher draw ratio employed in producing those fibers. 
For highly oriented films with microfibrillar substructure similar considerations on 
the origin of the voids should hold. 
Considering the two important regularities of submicrocrack formation [28], 
the inconsistencies of the Zakrewskii-mechanism [17], and the morphological as-
pects [58] the retraction of microfibril ends seems to be a logical interpretation of 
the opening-up of fixed-geometry voids. This means at the same time that the sub-
microcrack formation is a process inherently independent of chain scission or end-
group formation [220,421]. The voids constitute structural irregularities and con-
tribute as such toward the general non-homogeneity of the distribution of stresses. 
Their direct influence as individual stress concentrator is weak and ineffective with 
regard to accelerating chain scission. This conclusion is based on the following facts: 
-
obviously the existing voids do not prevent the further build-up of large elastic 
strains in the fibers or films - as evidenced by the subsequent scissioning of 
chains and the appearance of deformed-IR bands, 
-
if chain scission would occur preferably adjacent to microfibril ends further lateral 
widening of the there existing microcracks would then invariably accelerate chain 
scission. 
The above statement on the independence of chain scission and microcrack for-
mation does not preclude, of course, the sudden-death failure of a stressed fiber by 
coalescence of microcracks as proposed by Morgan et al. [421] for Kevlar® . 
Theses conclusions have found a certain confirmation by the studies of spherulitic 
POM by Wendorff [255]. After straining of different melt-crystallized or quenched POM 
samples he observes defects (of an average diameter of between 8 and 11 nm in lateral 
and -8 nm in axial direction depending on annealing temperature). The size does not 
change with sample strain, the concentration, however, increases exponentially. He 
interprets the defects as local yielding sites which disappear upon annealing. He also

of microfibrils concentrated on the outer boundary of fibrils (after [581). 

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
indicates that the non-linearity of the stress-strain curve of POM is related to the ap-
pearance of these elliptical void-like defects. 
E. Energy Release in Chain Scission 
A molecular chain segment stressed almost to its load-bearing capacity constitutes 
an extremely powerful source of elastically stored energy. In thermo-mechanically 
activated bond scission only a minor fraction of this stored energy is needed to break 
the chemical bond, namely the mechanical contribution P t/lb to the activation energy 
Vo. The remaining, major part of the energy is available for mechanical interaction 
with surrounding chains or is dissipated as heat. The dissipated heat has a twofold 
effect through the ensuing local temperature rise: it increases the mobility of other 
chain segments and decreases their rupture strength t/lb (T). Both effects tend to 
facilitate the further degradation of the stressed polymer. 
The total elastic energy stored in a segment of elastic modulus Ek, length L, 
and cross-section q amounts to 
(8.9) 
For a polyamide 6 segmentof5 nmlength withq = 0.189nm2, t/lb= 21 GN/m2 
and Ek = 200 GN/m2 one obtains a value of 1 . 10-18 J per segment or 600 kJ/mol 
for the elastically stored energy. To break a C-C bond at room temperature a me-
chanical energy of 110 kJ Imol is needed (cf. Chapter 7 I C I). In setting up an energy 
balance the contribution of the elastic forces must not be forgotten which hold the 
highly stressed tie-segment ends within the crystal lamellae [48]. At the rupture stress 
this energy amounts to about 190 kJ/mol for each segment end (cf. Table 5.4). One 
thus arrives at an energy of 870 kJ/mol which is liberated at the moment of chain 
scission. If this energy were to be confined within the volume of the segment and of 
its ends (Ltotal ::::' 10 nm) it would constitute an energy density of Wtotal/q . Ltotal = 
764 MJ/m3 . Chain scission events, therefore, have been justly termed micro-ex-
plosion by Zhurkov and his colleagues. 
On the other hand at a (large) concentration of (0.6.10+ 24) bond ruptures per 
m3 (Le. of 0.83 mol/m3 ) the total energy having been stored in the retracting chain 
ends amounts to an average of 722 kJ per m3 which will be dissipated as heat Ot,. 
The chemical energy Vb of this number of broken bonds amounts to 156 kJ 1m3 . 
These average energy values should also be compared against the density of elastically 
stored energy, Le. against a2 /2E. This term reaches about 125 MJ/m3 for very high 
strength PA 6 fibers, which in turn is only one sixth of the cohesive energy density 
of that material. The energy dissipation due to ruptured bonds is slightly smaller, 
therefore, than the pure hysteresis losses encountered in loading and unloading a 
polyamide fiber (for PA-6 at 10 to 30 Hz tan 5 is of the order of 5 . 10-3 ). 
The important problem of how the external work W done on a polymer sample 
during a loading-unloading cycle serves to increase the internal energy V, to change 
the entropy S, or to be irreversibly dissipated as heat Qir = TdiS was attacked by 
Miiller in 1956 in his classical experiments [59-62]. According to Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3 
one can write 
227 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
dW = dU - TdS + Qir. 
(8.10) 
Millier and his co-workers measured several deformation-related thermodynamic 
quantities: the reversible and irreversible parts of heat production during the plastic 
deformation ofPE, PVC, PETP, PA 6 [59-61], PC [63], PS [64], and of various 
elastomers [61, 65, 66], the ensuing temperature rises [67], the change of internal 
energy with the time of storage [68] and its effect on the energy of dissolution [69). 
They noted that the entropy of thermoplastics during cold flow is decreased and 
that the internal energy is increased. They also measured the balance of energy in 
stressing (s) and during retraction (r) of PIB in a sequence of stretching cycles. The 
change of internal energy in an i th cycle can be written as: 
(8.11 ) 
of which the entropy terms are equal by definition. The authors observed that 8 Ui 
was different from zero only in the first cycle. The increase of internal energy during 
extension of elastomers and thermoplastics was ascribed by them to a reduction of 
close range order and to chain scission and formation of radicals as further sinks of 
external energy (see also 8 I C 2 and refs. [238,241-245]). 
The latter hypothesis was also tested by Godovskii et al. [31]. PA-6 fibers 
drawn to A. = 5.5 at 210 °c were repeatedly stretched at room-temperature. The 
authors found for PA 6 the same characteristic difference between the first and the 
following loading cycles as did Millier for PIB: 8 U was essentially different from 
zero only in the first loading cycle. The ratio of 8 WI 18 U I was found, independent 
of the macroscopic stress, to amount to 7.0. This constancy of 8 WI 18 UI is in fact 
remarkable. It indicates that processes are responsible for the increase of internal 
energy which occur, independent of a, if locally a critical excitation is surpassed. 
Godovskii et al. assume that these processes are chain ruptures. They derive from 
8 U I the number N 1 of chain scission events each of which contributes an increment 
of internal energy of 1.7.10- 19 J (100 kJ/mol). The dissipated energy per chain 
scission event, 8 WI IN 1, amounted to 700 kJ Imol. These figures are only slightly 
smaller than the values found above on the basis of elasticity considerations for the 
mechanical contribution to chain scission (110 kJ Imol) and for the energy diSSipated 
by the retracting segments (870 kJ/mol). This striking coincidence does not prove, 
however, the above hypothesis that 8 UI might be interpreted solely as an increase 
in chemical bond energy due to chain scission. 
Millier [62] and Kausch and Becht [55] have indicated that slip processes and 
conformational changes may respond energetically similar to bond ruptures if they 
are occurring as a consequence of stress induced distortion of the polymer network 
or as a result of local heating. The increase in internal energy is then related to a 
decrease of close range order or the decrease of the number of hydrogen bonds or 
to internal stresses between chains and within crystallites. The existence of inter-
molecular forces of considerable magnitude in oriented polymers can be inferred 
from a number of optical, spectroscopical and mechanical experiments. Particularly 
noteworthy are the following observations. Vettegren et al. [70] noted that in per-
fectly annealed PETP film the maximum of the characteristic backbone vibration 
228 

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
band lies at 975 cm- 1 , whereas in oriented PETP film it lies at 972 cm- t • Lunn and 
Yannas [71] found that the asymmetric stretch vibration band of methyl groups 
with a maximum at 2971 cm- t in isotropic PC film splits into two components 
1 cm- 1 apart in a PC film drawn to about 85%. They assigned this frequency shift 
to the action of intermolecular rather than intramolecular forces. With the drawn 
material they also studied chain-segment orientation by determining the dichroic 
ratio of the 1364 cm- 1 band. They obtained an interesting result that chain back-
bone motion (with an ensuing change of the degree of orientation) in drawn PC films 
was clearly observable more than 60 K below the glass transition temperature of 
149°C. The largest deviations from an equilibrium state (highest intermolecular 
tensions) existed in those films drawn at the lowest temperature (23 0C) where anneal-
ing at 81°C resulted in measurable changes of the orientation distribution. Miiller 
[62] determined that in the cold drawing of non-oriented polymers the fraction 
II U/ll W of internal energy rise to external work amounted to 0.2 (PE), 0.3 to 0.45 
CPA 6, PETP) and 0.3 to 0.5 (PVC). 
The question is still open, therefore, as to the exact amount contributed to the 
internal energy rise by the different mechanisms mentioned above and to the extent 
the local rearrangements are triggered by chain scission. 
F. Fatigue Fracture of Fibers 
The preceeding Sections have dealt exclusively with the response of chains 
and micro fibrils to constant or monotonically increasing stress or strain. In service, 
however, fibers are frequently subjected to intermittent, alternating, or cyclic loads. 
The behavior of fibers, therefore, to repetitive cyclic loading has been studied for 
many years (e.g. 72-87). Following an extensive review of Hearle et al. [76] it can 
be said that in cumulative extension cycling a fiber fails by virtue of having reached 
its breaking extension. Under such a condition of constantly increasing maximum 
extension, fatigue can be predicted from an adequate knowledge of the anelastic 
deformation and the time-dependent breakage conditions of the fiber. As yet no 
specific fatigue effects have been identified in cumulative extension cycling [76]. 
In one of the earliest reports on fatigue of fibers and fabrics Busse et al. [72] 
pointed out that the vibration life of nylon, cotton, and rayon cords is inversely 
proportional to the rate of thermally activated flow steps. 
A similar conclusion has been drawn by Regel et al. [74] and Tamush [75] for 
cyclic stressing. These authors assume the validity of the principle of damage ac-
cumulation ("Miner's rule", see also Chapt. 3 IV D): 
21TNF/W 
J dt/T{a[t])=1 
o 
(8.12) 
with NF the number of cycles to failure and w the loading frequency. If T, the expec" 
tation value of the time-to-break under constant stress, is taken to be the common 
Arrhenius expression one obtains

Regel et al. [74] report that such a damage accumulation law did apply to PAN 
fibers loaded at 24 Hz up to 1.5 . 107 cycles. For PMMA films, viscose fibers, and 
capron fibers (PA 6) correspondance of experimental data with Eq. (8.13) could be 
obtained through air cooling of the fatigued samples, after preliminary drawing, or 
at elevated temperatures. The authors concluded that Eq. (8.13) would describe 
fatigue fracture within the kinetic concept of fracture if (ambient) temperature T 
and activation volume 'Y would be replaced by values T* and 'Y* which would depend 
on the parameters of the fatigue experiment (frequency, form of stress or strain pulse). 
The fatigue failure of fibers has also been extensively investigated by Prevorsek, 
Lyons, and co-workers. Their many pertinent papers are referenced in [78]. The 
authors interpret the fatigue life as the time to void nucleation by rearrangement of 
molecular segments. They arrive at a kinetic equation relating the number of cycles 
to failure with various mechanical and molecular parameters [78]. 
Fatigue testing PA 66 and PETP fibers between a lower (amin) and an upper 
stress level (amp) Bunsell, Hearle, Oudet et al. [77, 79, 84] observed a distinctive 
fatigue fracture morphology (see Fig. 9.53); they also obtained the apparently unex-
pected result that fatigue failure was accelerated if amin was decreased (zero mini-
mum load constituting the most severe fatigue condition). The authors ascertained 
that in addition to creep damage accumulation (Eq. 8.12) a distinctive fatigue fail-
ure mechanism exists. Such a mechanism may very well be the progress in disentangle-
ment of chain segments proposed independently by Hertzberg [28] and Kausch (in 
the first edition of this book). 
No special fatigue mechanisms were assumed by DeVries et al. [49] in explaining 
free radical formation in cyclic loading and by Kenney et al. [86] in testing ftlaments, 
yarns, and ropes of PA 66 at a fixed value of amin/amax = 0.1. In the latter samples 
abrasion and wear could be ofimportance at larger (bending) strain amplitudes [87]. 
Summarizing the above observations one has to conclude that initiation and 
propagation of fatigue cracks will be favored if chains and fibrils are given a chance 
to relax stresses, to degrade possible strain hardening effects, and to reorient. Charac-
teristic fatigue mechanisms are also well observable in non-oriented polymers. They 
will be treated in Section II C of this and in the next chapter. 
G. Ultra-high Strength Fibers 
In the previous sections (A to F) the rupture mechanisms of conventional fibers have 
been discussed. At draw ratios A of between 3 and 6 the amorphous regions within 
the microfibrils still contained more than 90% of non-extended chain segments which 
support most of the load [256]. This is different in ultra-highly oriented fibers with 
draw ratios A of between 10 and more than. 50. In linear PE for instance the number 
of non-extended, randomly oriented segments, of loops and chain folds decreases 
with increasing A [257-266]. The microfibrillar structure with alternating amorphous 
and crystalline regions (see Fig. 2.6) is initially still observed (depending on molecular 
weight and sample preparation technique up to draw ratios of about 20 to 30 [263 D. 
230 

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
Samples of a higher draw ratio, however, contain broader crystalline size distributions 
with a small component ofiong crystals (100 to 800 nm). Moreover the strong coher-
ence between crystallites seems to indicate the existence of intercrystalline bridges 
[259,262,263]. The Ward-model (Fig. 8.21) gives a representation of these struc-
tural features [259]. The Ruland-model [276c] considers in addition the imperfec-
tions caused by trapped loops. 
As underlined by the model calculations of Kanarnoto and Porter [271 a] very high 
draw ratios (A>200) should be obtainable from the semi crystalline state by pure tear-
ing away or unraveling of the crystal lamellae. In fact, single crystal mats of ultra-
high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE ofMw = 2.106 ) have been drawn 
by them [264] to a A of 247. At this extreme draw ratio the fiber elastic modulus 
approached a value of 220 GPa [264 a] which is close to the theoretical modulus of a 
perfect PE crystal (240-290 GPa). With UHMWPP films Kanamoto et al. [264 b] 
achieve an elastic modulus of 30 GPa at A = 58; as they indicate the lattice modulus 
of a perfect PP crystal is only slightly larger (35-42 GPa). 
According to all observations it has to be expected that the ultimate properties 
of ultra-high oriented fibers depend on the properties of the crystal blocks and on the 
way these blocks are linked together. Starting from this idea a simple shear lag theory 
of fiber composites has been proposed [258-261] to calculate the elastic moduli and 
the yield behavior of ultra-oriented fibers. In these investigations and more clearly in 
the creep studies of Ward and Wilding [267] two thermally activated mechanisms were 
identified. A first one which has a small activation volume (~0.1 nm3 ) and is primarily

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
affected by the draw ratio. This mechanism seems to be related to the a-relaxation 
process in the crystalline regions which reduces the effectiveness of the crystalline 
links between the crystal blocks; the other mechanism, which is not affected by changes 
in structure, has a larger activation volume (0.3-0.6 nm3 ) and is tentatively associated 
with the "molecular network" [267]. Creep of aromatic polyamide fibers was ex-
plained [398] by crystal rotation and crystal boundary slip. Chain scission [399] 
seems to be a less probable explanation. The deform~tion behavior of polyethylene 
Shish-Kebabs produced by stirring induced crystallization is characterized by a 
transformation oflamellar into fibrillar material [266,268]. 
Novel processing techniques of ultra highly oriented fibers are reviewed by Ohta 
[269] and in [403-409]. Their strength has been widely discussed [e.g. 257, 258, 
269-273,393,395,399]. A defmite and positive correlation between the total ratio, 
the elastic modulus and the fracture strength is observed (see [257b] for an extended 
discussion). The creep sensitivity ofPE gives rise to a pronounced rate dependency of 
strength; thus, at a temperature of -10°C the stress at yield or break of ultra-oriented 
PE of comparatively low molecular weight (Mw -60-100 . 103 ) varies from -0.6 
GPa at 10-5 S-1 to 1.4 GPa at 0.1 s-l; at 20°C the stress values are about 0.2 GPa 
smaller [270]. With the above samples final fracture is initiated by slippage of chains. 
As proposed by Woods et al. [267c] this tendency for creep can be greatly reduced 
by controlled crosslinking by electron irradiation. In Figures 8.22a and b stress-strain 
curves of electron irradiated (A) and unirradiated fibers (B) at 23°C are compared. 
The marked reduction in ductility, especially at the smaller loading rate is clearly 
visible. 
Very high draw ratios could also be obtained with ultra-high molecular weight 
samples (UHMWPE, Mw = 1.5-2 . 106 ) prepared by spinning from dilute solution 
[266,272-275]. In a dilute solution the number of entanglements between chain 
molecules evidently decreases with decreasing volume fraction cf> of the polymer. By 
quenching and solvent evaporation thin films can be prepared from the solution which 
maintain the small entanglement concentration [274]. If these films are uniaxially 
drawn the molecular segments between "entanglement points" are gradually straight-
ened. The maximum draw ratio Amax corresponds to the complete extension of such 
a segment (of average length). According to the classical theories of rubber elasticity

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
the maximum draw ratio varies with the number Nc of statistical chain segments be-
tween entanglement points as: 
(8.14) 
In dilute solution this number increases with l/tP. The experiments of Smith, 
Lemstra and Booij gave an excellent verification of this relation and of the entan-
glement concept [274]. Their results are shown in Fig. 8.23. In analyzing these re-
sults it should be kept in mind that a minimal number of entanglements will be re-
quired in order to assure the formation of a coherent physical network which can be 
oriented by drawing. This point has also been stressed by Chuah and Porter [271 b], 
Ward [257b], and by Ruland et al. [276] for pressure crystallized, hot-drawn PE. 
Together with the draw ratio the strength of these ultra-oriented fibers increased. 
Marichin et al. [273] report strength values of about 3 GPa of as-spun ultra-oriented 
fibers and values of 4.6 to 5.6 GPa for fibers which they had further oriented by 
drawing at very high temperatures (130 to 150°C). Savitsky et al. [272] even obtain 
tensile strengths of up to 7 GPa. This is much less than the (theoretical) tensile strength 
of an individualPEchain which has a value of be tween 20 and 40 GPa [48, 222e, 242b]. 
It coincides however exactly with the pull-out strength of a PE molecule from a crys-
tal, calculated by Kausch and Becht [48] to be 1.37 nN per chain crossection of 
0.19 nm2 (see also Chapter 5 II B and C). All theoretical and experimental evidence 
points to slip processes as the origin of the rupture of ultra-oriented PE fibers. 
High strength fibers containing extended aromatic chains behave somewhat dif-
ferently. Figure 8.24 gives a model representation of the distribution of chain ends in 
Kevlar® 49 fibers [277]. It is believed that the relatively stiff and straight chains

oriented fibrillar skin enclosing a crystalline core of row lamellae [277]. Their impu-
rities [400], static and dynamic properties [278,401], and molecular weight [402] 
have been studied. Using a new technique by bonding these fibers to a bending beam 
Deteresa et al. [279] apply compressive strains of up to 3%. They show that regular-
ly-spaced helical kink bands appear at about 0.53% strain. The tensile strength (3.4 
GPa) was measured to be 5 times larger than the compressive strength and 17 times 
larger than the shear strength (0.18 GPa). From their extended electron microscop-
ical observations Morgan et al. [277,421] conclude in accord with the earlier obser-
vations of Konopasek and Hearle [148] that failure of such a structure is initiated by 
shear crack propagation through the voided fibrillar skin followed by transverse crack 
propagation along interlamellar planes combined with axial shear splitting (Fig. 8.25). 
The failure mechanisms of Kevlar® 49 fibers have also been investigated by ESR 
techniques [281,282]. Brown and Hodgeman [281] studied the thermal degradation; 
they noted the generally observed slightly asymmetic ESR signal of untreated roving 
material later assigned by Brown, Sandreczki and Morgan [282] to transition metal 
ions like Mn +2, Cu +2 and possibly Fe +2, Fe +3, Cr +3 and Ti+3. Upon heating to beyond 
350 °c (in air) or 450 °c (in vacuum) free radicals appeared in large numbers which 
were considered to result from homolytic bond scissiOn followed by crosslinking re-
actions leading to the formation of conjugated structures [281]. No stresses were ap-
plied in these studies. 
Morgan et al. [282] searched for the stress-induced formation offree radicals. 
They concluded from their observations that the amount of chain scission before 
final fracture is below the detectable limit, i.e. less than 1/20 of that observed af-
ter fracture or less than 109 chain scissions per filament. However, the final highly 
fibrillar fracture event led to a measurable intensity of (probably secondary) free rad-

Fig. 8.2S. Planar model of crack propagation path through macromolecular chain ends in fiber 
skin and core in Kevlar 49 fiber (from [277]). Strong indications that the interlamellar planes are 
the critical sites were also obtained by Avakian et al. [280) who observed steps of a minimum 
height of 250 nm in the fracture planes of HO etched fibers; in this case the crack presumably 
followed the defects created along the advantageous diffusion paths by chemical attack 
icals of 2 . 1010 spins/filament. This amount corresponded to 50 times as many chains 
as are crossing one transverse fracture plane. Since the axial splitting extended over 
2500 weak planes an average fraction of 2% of all tie molecules within this region 
had been broken during the final crack propagation. These observations strongly con-
firm that chain scission in stressed Kevlar® 49 fibers is the consequence rather than 
the origin of mechanical breakdown. 
The question of the strength of other aromatic or rigid rod polymer fibers has 
also been dealt with experimentally and theoretically [283-288] not giving rise to 
any different conclusions concerning the role of chain scission. In the case of the 
highly regular polydiacetylene single-crystal fibers, however, practical strength values 
(of up to 1.5 GPa) have been obtained [289], which are very close to the chain 
strength (of 3 GPa).

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
A. Fracture at Small Deformations (Brittle Fracture) 
1. Impact Loading 
Polymeric materials are viscoelastic solids. Their propensity to anelastic and plastic 
deformation is reduced when they are tested at high load rates and/or at low tem-
peratures. The reduced deformability causes a formerly tough or highly elastic poly-
mer to respond in a brittle manner. The impact fracture of natural rubber at liquid 
nitrogen temperature is convincing evidence of this fact. 
The resistance of polymeric materials to impact loading is of considerable tech-
nical importance as illustrated by the following arbitrary examples: 
aircraft windows have to withstand impinging particles or rain 
protective coverings of high voltage switches must resist the impact of metal chips 
water pipes or plastic floor tiles should not be damaged if hit accidentally 
car bumpers or packaging materials must absorb as much of the energy of a col-
lision as possible 
household items are not expected to break the first time they fall to the ground 
gears should transmit even rapidly increasing forces 
safety belts should yield but not fracture. 
In view of the technical relevance the impact resistance of polymers has been 
intensively investigated. The cited references [88-103] may serve as an introduction 
into the large body of literature. Vincent [88] and Bucknall et al. [89] give a general 
survey of the impact testing of polymers. Other references concern the molecular 
aspects [88-96], instrumentation [97-100], and particle impact [101-103]. The 
extensive literature on the fracture mechanical analysis of impact bending tests will 
be referenced in Chapter 9. 
The fact that the impact resistance depends strongly on the presence and shape 
of stress concentrators, on the sample geometry, and on the testing conditions has 
made it very difficult to define and measure a unique material property impact 
resistance. Since the impact behavior under one condition (e.g. impact bending) 
cannot very well be predicted from the behavior under different conditions (e.g. 
falling weight) quite a number of impact tests have been devised. The four best known 
ones are the three point bending (Charpy unnotched and notched), two point bend-
ing (lzod), tensile-impact, and falling-weight tests which have been standardized 
(DIN 53453,53448,53373, 53443E; ASTM D 256,1822,2444,3029). 
In the context of this chapter mainly the three-point bending test (Charpy) will 
be discussed. In this test the energy loss An is measured which a pendulum incurs in 
striking and breaking a prismatic specimen (of thickness D and width B). The ob-
served energy loss comprises basically four different terms: 
-
the energy We to bend the sample up to the point of crack initiation, 
-
the energy GcBD to propagate the crack through the specimen, 
-
the energy Wkin required to accelerate the sample from zero to pendulum velocity, 
-
vibrational or otherwise diSSipated energy. 
The simple excess energy measurement of the pendulum does not permit dis-
crimination between these different energy sinks. The separation of the first three 
236 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
terms becomes possible, however, if the bending force P acting between pendulum 
head and specimen is measured {so-called instrumented impact test}. A further im-
provement of the analysis of impact phenomena is obtained if not only the pendulum 
head but also the impacted specimen is instrumented. A relatively simple and straight-
forward method to determine the time scales of local deformation and crack initiation 
in a shock-loaded specimen is provided by a sprayed-on graphite gauge as described 
by Stalder et a1. [290]. Figure 8.26 shows a Charpy specimen prepared this way and 
the corresponding measuring Circuit. The inverse gauge resistance, Ro/R{t} and the 
force P{t) exerted on the hammer nose during a doubly instrumented Charpy test of 
a PC specimen are plotted in·Fig. 8.27. The time scale and the nature of the different 
phases of the impact event become already clear from this diagram.

Two phases in the time sequence of the event are evident: 
Phase I begins as soon as the striker touches the specimen and ends when the 
crack begins to propagate. During this time, which is called the time-to-fracture ini-
tiation, the specimen center is accelerated up to the striker velocity. This acceleration 
may well occur in several bounces. Through the displacement of the ~pecimen center 
bending stresses are imparted onto the specimen; in the given case of a notched sample 
the stresses have been large enough as to initiate and propagate a crack. In this phase 
(I) the graphite gauge acts as a strain gauge and records the elastic and plastic deforma-
tion of the sample. The variation of Ro/R is a function of the deformation of the speci-
men and of the plastic zone at the crack tip. Knowledge of the strain gauge factor 
would permit this deformation to be quantified. 
Phase II during this time the gauge records in real time the relative position of the 
crack front, even if the velocity of the crack is high. 
In the shown example of a notched PC specimen phase I reveals a notable de-
formation of the specimen and a relatively long time-to-fracture initiation. The 
238 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
first load peak is the inertial peak (acceleration of the specimen), the second pro-
vides the critical stress at the notch tip necessary to initiate and propagate a crack. 
In phase II, the graphite gauge recording shows that the crack starts to propagate with 
a high velocity (-200 m/s) which decreases rapidly. 
The time delay which appears in Fig. 8.27 between crack initiation and maximum 
load is due to the fact that the shock waves generated at the moment of the second 
contact take a finite time to propagate from the front of the striker to the conven-
tional strain gauge recording the load which was mounted at the rear of the striker. At 
time t = 0 (first contact) this delay does not appear because the shock waves must 
propagate from the point of impact to both detectors, i.e. through the sample to the 
graphite gauge and through the striker to the strain gauge. Both waves seem to reach 
the respective gauges simultaneously. 
For the static elastic bending of a prismatic beam between supports at a distance Ls 
the following expressions for energy and strain are obtained. 
The total bending energy We, as a function of beam deflection 0 , is 
(8.15) 
the largest density of stored elastic energy in the tensile fiber: 
(8.16) 
and the largest strain can be expressed as 
Ern = Gm/E = 60 D/t;. 
(8.17) 
From the foregoing considerations it can be concluded that fracture in impact 
bending of a given material will be delayed if the stored elastic energy Wm available 
to initiate and propagate a crack remains small and/or if the fracture resistance R of 
that material is large. The latter property will be examined in detail in Chapter 9. 
The influence of the former shall be further discussed at this point. 
Apart from specimen geometry the stored elastic energy of a bent specimen de-
pends on its elastic modulus E (Eq. 8.16). A "soft" specimen evidently will not break 
but fold. The correlation between elastic modulus and "impact strength" has been 
discussed repeatedly (see for instance [88-97]). In the classical Charpy test impact 
strength (Schlagziihigkeit, resistance au choc) has been defined as the ratio an of the 
measured pendulum energy loss An to the sample cross-section B . D. 
Such a notation creates the allusion that an is a fracture surface specific material 
property. As pOinted out above this is not the case. Neither We nor Wkin are propor-
tional to the sample cross-section. A comparison of an values should only be made, 
therefore, if all values are obtained from one type of test, preferably even from speci-
mens of identical geometry. Impact strength values an ofCharpy un-notched speci-
mens (DIN 53453) at 20°C range from 3.5-12 kJ/m2 for filled phenol melamine 
and urea resins, 4-22 kJ/m2 for various filled epoxy and polyester resins, 12-20 kJ/ 
239 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
m2 for PMMA, PS, and SAN, and 50-90 kJ/m2 for ethyl cellulose, CA, styrene-bu-
tadiene copolymers, and POM. For many thermoplastics (ABS, CAB, PE, PP, PTFE, 
PC, PVC, PA) no fracture is observed under these test conditions [104 J. 
The above impact strength values designate brittle behavior if an < 40 kJ/m2 • 
The materials with an between 50 to 90 kJ/m2 will generally be brittle if bluntly 
notched. Of those polymers not breaking in the Charpy un-notched test some will 
respond in a brittle manner if they are sharply notched, whereas others remain tough 
even then. Vincent [96] and Bucknall et al. [89] propose, therefore, the following 
qualitative impact resistance rating: brittle (an < 40 kJ /m 2 ), brittle if bluntly notched, 
brittle if sharply notched, tough but crack propagating, and very tough and crack ar-
resting. 
Studying the impact behavior of 18 different thermoplastics Vincent [96] found 
that for two thirds of his data there existed a good negative correlation between im-
pact strength rating and dynamic modulus. 
The characteristic impact behavior of brittle polymers can conveniently be out-
lined using PMMA as an example. The impact of a specimen initially leads to its con-
tinuous straining and to the build-up of stresses. These stresses provoke the growth 
of defects such as crazes [105]. Final breakdown of the impacted specimen will start 
from such a defect (or from purpously introduced notches). In the case of brittle 
polymers final breakdown occurs through rapid propagation of a crack. The energy 
absorbed in the impact test is essentially the energy transferred onto the specimen up 
to the moment where rapid crack propagation set in. As shown by the diagramme in 
Fig. 8.28 this energy may completely be determined by the "intertia peak" the speci-
men being fractured "in flight" while being no longer in contact with the hammer. In

240 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unorfented Polymers 
this case the measured energy loss An has no relation to the resistance of the material 
against fracture. In fact an already broken specimen will cause the same energy losses 
to the pendulum. With notched polycarbonate (Fig. 8.27) one measures more reliably 
the forces necessary to bend the specimen up to the point where crack propagation 
is initiated. In this case the bending energy We accounts for most of the energy loss 
An. With unnotched PE or ABS, however, a notable amount of energy, Ws = GoBD 
will be needed to make the crack propagate. A quantitative discussion of Ws, which 
must make use of the mechanics of fracture, will be given in Chapter 9. 
Both terms, We and Ws depend on temperature, as is readily seen from Fig. 8.29. 
The ductile crack propagation observed in HDPE at + 100°C and +20 °c changes 
into a brittle one at liquid nitrogen temperature. 
Whatever has been said about the phenomenology of impact bending fracture 
is also valid for tensile impact: The impact resistance of a material is increased by all 
molecular properties or processes which assist the distribution and diSSipation of 
the mechanical energy and permit the attainment of a large deformation before in-
ception of rapid crack propagation. In particular the importance of the relaxation 
behavior [91,93-96], of high molecular weight [106], of partial orientation [108, 
303], and of the unoccupied volume [92] have been emphasized. 
A maximum fractional unoccupied volume if) was defined by Litt et al. [92] 
through the densities of the amorphous (Pa) and the crystalline state (Pc) as: 
(8.l8) 
The 1 values of common polymers at room temperature vary between zero and 
0.12. Litt found a good - although not perfect - correlation between 1 and impact 
strength. He indicates that polymers with high impact strength all have 1 > 0.07. 
Considerable qualitative evidence has been cited in the literature (e.g. 88-105, 
291, 292) that the intensities of the low-temperature relaxation peaks deriving from 
main-chain motion «(3 and 'Y peaks) are related to impact toughness. A positive corre-
lation has to be expected since an increased molecular mobility 
reduces the level of stored elastic energy at a given sample deformation and load 
rate and retards crack initration 
prolongs the phase of thermal crack growth, i.e. retards the inception of an un-
stable crack, 
and increases the energy expenditure during crack propagation. 
This correlation has been clearly demonstrated by Ramsteiner who determined 
for a dozen of the most important thermoplastics the brittle-ductile transition tem-
peratures and the logarithmic decrement in torsion [292}. His results are reproduced 
in Fig. 8.30. Wherever a pronounced low temperature ((3) relaxation peak is observed 
in torsion it coincides with the brittle-ductile transition temperature in impact bend-
ing. In the absence of such peaks (PIB, PMMA, PS) the transition is shifted all the 
way up to the beginning of the Q relaxation. Ramsteiner also discusses the influences 
of thermal treatment (shock cooling of PC increases its molecular mobility and its 
toughness in a temperature range between -10 ~d +70 0c), water and rubber mod-
ification [292}.

A quantitative correlation will be limited by the fact that the relaxation behavior 
is determined in the linear anelastic range of stresses and at small strain rates. These 
conditions are quite different from those of an impact test. A quantitative discussion 
also has to be based on a fracture mechanical analysis of crack initiation and propa-
gation (cf. Chapter 9). 
The impact resistance of a polymer is reduced by all factors which lead to a gen-
eral or local increase of stored elastic energy at a given deformation but are not ac-
companied by an overproportional increase in strength. Thus the stress concen-
trating effect of notches, flaws, or inclusions in an otherwise unchanged polymer con-
siderably lowers its impact resistance. Increasing the degree of cross-linking beyond 
the point which insures the loading of all chains only leads to the formation of short, 
tightly anchored chain segments. Such segments are the first to be overloaded and 
242 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
scissioned upon straining. The small impact resistance of fully cured thermosetting 
resins underlines this point. Reinforcing thermoplastics by short random fibers in-
creases their rigidity more effectively than their strength which leads to a net de-
crease of impact resistance. 
A considerable toughening is to be expected, if strength and deformation can be 
made to increase simultaneously. Such an effect is realized through the partial orien-
tation of un-oriented polymers [108,303]. For PS drawn to A = 3.4 Retting [108] 
reports increases in tensile strength from 47 to 80 MN/m2 and of strain at break 
from 7 to 22%. The IUPAC Working Party "Structure and Properties of Commercial 
Polymers" studied systematically the effect of orientation of various polystyrene 
samples (homo polymers and rubber-modified polystyrenes) on optical and mechanical 
properties [109, 110]. It was observed that the impact strength an of unnotched homo-
polymer specimen increased with draw ratio from about 3 at A = 1 to more than 
50 kJ/m2 at A = 6 if the molecular orientation was parallel to the main specimens 
dimension. In a perpendicular direction an decreased from 3 to 0.3 kJ/m2 for the 
homopolymer and from about 9 to 2 kJ/m2 for a commercially available rubber-
modified polystyrene [109, 110]. A similar increase in low temperature ductility has 
been observed by Daniels [293] for PA 66 if the preorientation draw ratio exceeded 
1.8. The maximum impact load of PETP can be tripled [303]. 
The principal effect of chain backbone properties on impact strength has become 
clear. A chain does not so much contribute to impact strength through the level of 
stress 1/Ib it supports at the moment of chain scission or disentanglement but rather 
through the energy dissipated before 1/Ib is reached. Chains are loaded in shear which 
necessitates the displacement of chains with respect to each other. A maximum of 
energy dissipation is obtained, therefore, if the intermolecular shear stresses are large 
but insufficient to break a chain (cf. Eq. 5.41) and if the chains do not easily disent-
angle so as to insure chain slip over large volume elements. 
2. Fracture at Cryogenic Temperatures 
As to be expected fracture at cryogenic temperatures has much in common with im-
pact fracture since the major relaxation mechanisms (o:,~) are frozen in at liquid ni-
trogen temperature. Fracture of isotropic specimens will generally be brittle in nature 
and characterized by the same sequence of events as impact fracture. In a tensile or 
bending experiment one has: 
-
(more or less) steadily increasing load 
-
at an elevated load level growth of defects through e.g. scission of tie-molecules 
and/or void formation (as proposed for PE [294]) or through crazing 
onset of rapid crack propagation once defect size a and instantaneous stress a ful-
fill the instability criterion to be discussed in Chapter 9. 
The fracture surface of a HDPE specimen bent at liquid nitrogen temperature 
shows the growth region ofa defect (Fig. 8.31, upper right hand comer). The so-call-
ed mirror grew during load application at a temperature of -196°C from an unresolv-
ed, small material inhomogeneity to its critical size of 2-3 nm, at which unstable 
243 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
Fig. 8.31. Bending fracture of notched HOPE at liquid nitrogen temperature (enlarged 8 : 1, taken 
from (106)) 
crack propagation set in. Closer analysis of the fracture surface reveals that even at 
this temperature and at high crack velocity plastic deformation had occurred (see. 
Fig. 9.18). Brown [295] recently estimated that plastic deformation in most of the 
common thermoplastics - except in PE and PP - occurs in the absence of thermal 
activation if the ratio of shear stress and shear modulus approaches 0.064 to 0.092. 
For PE and PP this ratio is of the order of 0.03. He introduces a model by which the 
plastic deformation is explained as a combination of three molecular motions which 
he calls shearon (intermolecular shear), roton (intramolecular Shear), and tubon (mo-
tion parallel to the covalent bond). 
In the same way as the impact behavior the low temperature deformation is in-
fluenced by molecular and structural features (molecular weight, thermal treatment, 
preorientation). For example rapidly quenched, "high" molecular weight (Mw = 
2.2 . 105 ) HDPE samples break in a brittle manner if T < 95 K [294] whereas slowly 
cooled "low" molecular weight (Mw = 1 . 105) samples show a ductile-brittle tran-
sition already at - 130-166 K (Fig. 8.32). Whereas these low temperature ductile-

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
brittle transitions are not very rate sensitive (in the range of 0.11 to 11 . 10-3 s-l) 
this will be different for the conventional transition from necking/rupture to necking/ 
drawing situated at 243-273 K [294]. 
The low temperature fracture events generally start from very small structural 
irregularities. According to the severity of these irregularities fracture stresses can 
show, therefore, a very large variation. This is well represented by the fracture data 
of unplasticized PVC (Fig. 8.33). 
In partially oriented polymers more and longer extended chain segments are 
pointing in the direction of orientation. If a sample is loaded in this direction the 
molecular stresses will be more homogeneously distributed and brittle rupture delay. 
ed (to larger values of macroscopic stress or strain). This was observed by Retting 
[108-110] for impacted preoriented PS (see previous section) and by Daniels [293] 
for the tensile behavior of partially oriented PA 66 at -196°C. Up to draw ratios 
smaller than 1.8 the PA 66 broke at strains smaller than 20% (corresponding to a 
total elongation at break Ab of less than 2). For A ~ 1.8 the strains at break went up 
to 75% giving a Ab of more than 3; Ab increased further with increasing draw ratio A 
[293]. 
An entirely similar behavior was found by Andrews and Reed for elastomers at 
cryogenic temperatures (see e.g. [297,298] and Section 7 II). At these temperatures

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
elastomers behave very much like thermoplastic materials. One particularity may be 
noted in the case of cross-linked rubbers where chain scission will be provoked at 
large extensions [297,298]. The free radicals formed in this process are highly reac-
tive; since they give rise to cross-linking reactions the cross-link density of a forcibly 
extended rubber vulcanisate may even increase [298]. 
B. Failure Under Constant Load (Creep and Long-Term Strength) 
1. General Considerations 
Subjecting a specimen to a constant load evidently can have one of three results: 
the specimen breaks upon application of the load 
the specimen fails after some time 
the specimen carries the load for an indefinite period of time. 
The first case, failure during the application of the load, will be treated in other 
sections (8 II A if it occurs in a brittle manner, 8 II D for short-time ductile failure). 
In this section the technolOgically interesting long-term strength will be discussed. 
Owing to its fundamental importance the time-dependent strength of load-bearing 
polymers has been extensively investigated with temperature as the principal para-
meter. In Figures 1.4, 1.5 and 3.7 stress-time-temperature diagrams of various ther-
moplastics are represented. The phenomenon of a delay between load application 
and fmal failure has found numerous interpretations. Among these interpretations 
one group is based on purely statistical considerations. There the time-to-failure tb 
is inversely related to the probability that a certain detrimental event takes place in 
an otherwise unchanged material Such events are e.g. the formation of a void of suf-
ficient size or the coincidence of local fracture events. The statistical aspects of frac-
ture have been discussed in Section II of Chapter 3. 
A second group of interpretations is based on reaction rate theory and on the 
gradual exhaustion of the polymer load carrying capability due to the breakage and/ 
or displacement of elements and/or to the formation of defects (cf. Section IV of 
Chapter 3). Depending on the load-time-temperature regime apparently different 
failure patterns are observed. As an example the creep fracture morphologies of PVC 
tubes subjected to different stress levels have been reproduced in Chapter 1. At higher 
stresses (av = 50 MN/m2) PVC tubes fail in a brittle manner after little creep defor-
mation, and one speaks of delayed brittle fracture (Fig. 1.1). At medium stresses 
(42 MN/m2) and after prolonged times the tubes show large scale plastiC defor-
mation, i.e. delayed yielding (Fig. 1.2). At lower stresses (av < 20 MN/m2) failure 
does either not occur at all within experimental time scales or by a competing mecha-
nism, the formation of a creep crack (Fig. 1.3). 
In order to predict lifetimes of stressed specimens three different approaches 
have been followed: Treatment of the whole fracture event as a single thermally 
activated process; analysis of the rate of creep strain or calculation of the rate of flaw 
growth. These three approaches will be discussed in the following. 
246 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
2. Kinetic Theories 
According to the kinetic fracture theories it is admissible to describe the whole com-
plex fracture phenomenon by the kinetics of its slowest mechanism:Generally mea-
surable experimental parameters such as rate and extent of creep deformation or 
flaw size do not enter the constitutive equation as variables. (The theory of Hsiao-
Kausch, developed for solids not showing large scale anelastic deformation introduces 
a time-dependent strain which derives, however, as a consequence of the gradual net-
work degradation). 
To a large extent kinetic theories are founded upon the material behavior that is 
represented by the shown stress-time temperature diagrams (Figs. 1.4, 1.5,3.7, and 
3.11). The essential feature certainly is that within a large interval of time the loga-
rithm of the time-to-break tb decreases linearly with increasing uniaxial or principal 
stress Go. Anyone of these straight lines can be expressed by 
(8.19) 
where to, A, and a are constant with respect to time and stress. As discussed in Sec-
tion IV of Chapter 3 various authors have proposed that these "constants" have a 
more general significance. Most approaches work with an Arrhenius equation: 
(8.20) 
In this form Vo, 'Y, and to are supposedly independent of temperature. The ex-
perimental data of Savitskii et al. [i 19] plotted in Figure 3.7 verify this point for a 
cellulose nitrate film and the polyamide 6 mono filaments investigated. For each 
material only one set of constants is necessary to describe all data points. For cel-
lulose nitrate the authors obtained Vo = 159 kJ/mol, 'Y = 644 . 10-6 m3/mol, 
to = 10-13 s and for the oriented polyamide 6 (Capron) Vo = 184 kllmol, 
'Y = 113 . 10-6 m3/mol, to = 10-13 s. 
In the case of PVC tubes one obtains from an evaluation of Figure 1.4 accord-
ing to Eq. (8.20) values of Vo = 397 kllmol, 'Y = 1740 . 10-6 m3/mol and (a purely 
formal value of) to = 1.7· 1O-52 s. It should be noted that this set of parameters 
describes the PVC fracture times notwithstanding the fact that these data belong to 
three different fracture modes. In the stress-time curves of non-oriented semicrystal-
line polymers (PE, PP) one observes a drop of strength at larger values of tb, the well-
known bend (Fig. 1.5). The data of the flat portions (relating predominantly to 
ductile failure) can be represented by 
Vo = 307 kllmol, 'Y = 4390· 10-6 m3/mol, and to = 3 . 10-40 s 
and the data of the steep portions (creep crack· failure) by 
Vo = 181 kllmol, 'Y = 3610 . 10-6 m3/mol, and to = 8 . 10-20 s. 
For oriented semicrystalline polymers Zhurkov et al. [18] report: 
247 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
HDPE Vo = 113 kJ/mol, 1 = 109.10-6 m3 /mol, to = 10-11 s 
LDPe Vo = 117 kJ/mol, 1 = 247 .10-6 m3/mol, to = 10-12 S 
PP 
Vo = 125 kJ/mol, 1= 213.10-6 m3/mol, to = 10-12 s. 
These formal evaluations need discussion. The good correspondence between 
Vo and the dissociation energy of the weakest main chain bonds for many of the 
(mostly oriented) polymeric materials investigated by him has led Zhurkov [120,18] 
to establish his kinetic theory of fracture. This theory assumes that all important 
steps contributing to the fracture of a material are not only related to but even con-
trolled by thermal density fluctuations (dilatons). As important steps have been con-
sidered chain scission, microcrack formation, and crack nucleation [3,384-388]. 
The effect on fracture behavior of structure, orientation, dimensionality of the state 
of stress, morphology, and homogeneity of chemically "identical" polymers must be 
expressed, therefore, through the single parameter 1. 
The parameter 1 has the dimension m3 /mol and is termed activation volume. 
With reference to Chapter 3, Section N, it should designate the thermally activated 
volume if the stress Go indeed acts on this volume directly and without intermediates. 
This is approximately the case in flow but not in chain scission. The scission of a 
chain necessitates molecular stresses t/I b which are clearly much larger than the applied 
external stresses Go. For PA 6 molecular stress concentration factors t/lb/Go of 
between 10 and 40 are commonly determined (cf. Chapters 7 and 8 above). Taking 
12 . 10-6 m3/mol for the activation volume {3 of the chain scission process a param-
eter 1 = {3",IGo of 120 to 480· 1O-6m3/mol should be predicted. The activation 
volume of 12· 1O-6 m3/mol amounts to (0.27 nm)3 or to a stretching ofthe ruptur-
ing bond by 0.1 nm. 
The effect of the structural parameter chain orientation on 1 becomes apparent 
from Figure 3.11. There the stress-lifetime data of PAN fibers [74] are plotted with 
draw ratio A as a parameter. The highest draw ratio (A = 17.3) corresponds to a 1 of 
248 . 10-6 m3 /mol, A = 4 to 590, A = 2.62 to 841 and A = 1 to 1 = 1200 . 10-6 m3 I 
mol. The 1 values are the smaller the more homogeneously the macroscopic stress 
is distributed over the molecular chains. 
The foregoing discussion shows that the 1 values of PMMA, PVC, and PE can 
hardly be explained on the basis of chain scission unless extremely large stress con-
centration values are postulated. In the case of PVC the 1 corresponds to (1.7 nm)3 
which points to the involvement of larger domains in the activation of the creep 
process. The fact that the PVC fracture data of all modes are described by one equa-
tion seems to indicate that in the cited experiment [111] all modes depend on the 
creep deformation. Once a certain structural weakening has resulted from creep the 
final failure is accomplished by one of the three modes, e.g. by brittle fracture at 
large stresses, ductile failure, or creep crack development. Since the final period ac-
counted only for a small fraction of tb no effect on the slope of 2n tb/to was noted. 
Comments are necessary concerning the Significance of to and Go in Eq. (8.20). 
Values of 10-12 to 10-14 s have been frequently determined for to; they have been 
assigned to longitudinal vibrational modes of the backbone chain. For PVC and PE 
extremely small values have been obtained in this section which certainly cannot be 
interpreted in the same manner. With flow processes it must be recognized that the 
activation energy is not temperature independent but decreases with temperature:

(8.22) 
A value tg formally determined from experimental data according to Eq. (8.20) 
contains, therefore, the two terms to and the temperature-independent part of 
aa~o ~i . 
The latter term seems to be responsible for tg values of 10- 40 s and less. 
3. Creep Failure 
The presence of long and flexible chains causes a polymeric material to show a mono-
tonic, partly anelastic deformation under constant load, viz. a creep deformation. If 
not accompanied by strain hardening the creep deformation of a loaded specimen 
will invariably lead to a reduction in cross-section, to an increase in stresses and to the 
eventual (ductile) failure. This phenomenon is well known for practically all materials. 
Especially for metals the analysis of creep deformation is highly advanced (see for in-
stance [300-302]). 
As indicated above the continued reduction of sample cross-section due to the 
creep deformation will lead to an increase in stress. Sample thinning and possibly 
structural weakening associated with the continued creep deformation set the stage

for the eventual local yielding. As an example the circumferential creep strain of the 
afore mentioned PVC pipe at 0v = 42 MN/m2 is plotted in Figure 8.34. The curve 
clearly represents the characteristic parts of a creep curve: the instantaneous (elastic) 
deformation EO, a primary phase with a decreasing strain rate, a secondary phase where 
the strain rate is constant and a third phase of accelerated creep. During the latter 
phase creep rates are large, the material approaches the yield conditions. Such a con-

dition is generally reached first within the most highly stressed material, i.e. at the 
smallest sample cross-section. 
In order to predict the creep behavior and possibly the ensuing failure a number 
of approaches have been proposed. These are based respectively on the theory of 
viscoelasticity - including the concept of free volume - or on empirical represen-
tations of € (t) or of the creep modulus E (t) = oo/€ (t). For polymers in the linear 
viscoelastic range the creep compliance J(t,T) = € (t,T)/oo shows the expected 
inverse behavior of the relaxation modulus E (t) = o(t,T)/€o' The creep behavior has 
been studied intensively by Schwarzl et al. [304-305] within experimental time 
scales spanning more than 8 decades. At extremely short times and low temperatures 
the response is elastic with compliances Jo of the order of 0.3 to 0.5' 10-9 Pa-I . At 
slightly larger times the local motion leads to an increase of J to values of the order 
of 1 . 10-9 Pa-I . In the transition range (see Fig. 8.35) J increases rapidly. For 
many applications the approximation of J (t) in this region by: 
log J(t)/GPa ~ m log t/s + c with 0.5 < m < 0.9 
(8.23) 
has been useful [304]. 
At longer times and beyond the transition zone an uncrosslinked polymer flows: 
J = Je + t/T/o 
(8.24) 
with compliances of the order of 1 Pa-I. 
The framework of the linear theory of viscoelasticity also permits the calculation 
of viscoelastic moduli from relaxation time spectra and their interconversion. The re-
duction of stresses and time periods according to the time-temperature superposition 
principle frequently allows establishment of master-curves and thus the extrapolation 
to larger values oft (cf. Chapter 2). The strain levels presently utilized in load bear-
ing polymers, however, are generally in the non-linear range of viscoelasticity. This 
restricts the use of otherwise known relaxation time spectra or viscoelastic moduli in 
the derivation of € (t) or E(t). 
The limits of linearity are discussed in a review article by Yannas [112]. He con-
cludes that for practically all polymers at T -T g < - 20 K a strain smaller than 1 % 
forms the limit of linear response. For semicrystalline polymers (e.g. PP, PAN, PETP, 
PA 66) a limit of 0.1 to 0.4% seems to be valid also above the glass transition tem-
perature Tg (even at T - Tg > 100 K). 
For amorphous polymers (PC, PIB, NR) the limit increases around T g from 1 
to about 50% of strain [112]. There are some special approaches to a calculation 
of creep and recovery based on non-linear theories of viscoelasticity [112-114, 
306,307]. At present it is not possible, however, to predict with sufficient general-
ity the onset of accelerated creep and thus of delayed yielding from non-linear visco-
elastic theories. Promising results have been obtained, however, using the free volume 
concept to account for the shift of relaxation times with strain and thermal history 
and to predict changes of failure stress and failure mechanism [123, 124]. 
Empirical approaches to represent the creep curves of materials by mathematical 
functions have been known for more than 60 years. One of the first is the Andrade 
equation 
251 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
e(t) - €o = P (t/tO)1/3 + Kt 
(8.25) 
where to 1/3 and K are adaptable constants [115]. This equation - originally derived 
for metals - describes the uniaxial creep of different materials such as Ph, Cu, Fe, 
Cd, PMMA, PA, PVC within certain time periods very well [111, 115, 116] . Various 
empirical modifications ofthis equation have been reported [116, 308, 309, 319]. 
Thus the circumferential creep is described by a similar potential law 
(8.26) 
For PVC tubes the exponent n was found by several investigators to be about 
0.23 [111]. For the dependency of P on 00 a hyperbolic sine function has been 
frequently proposed in the literature (e.g. 111,116). For PVC tubes at 20 °CP as-
sumes the form [111]: 
p = 0.019 sinh (00/8.85 MN m- 2). 
(8.27) 
Equations (8.26) and (8.27)permit the calculation of €(t, 00) at 20°C. They thus 
also permit one to determine at which stress a specified strain value € 1 is being reached 
after very long times. One finds that a strain value €l = 3% - at which the creep rate 
of moderately stressed PVC tubes (Oy = 35 to 48 MN /m 2 ) changes from phase I to 
phase II - will be reached at 00 = 22 MN/m2 only after 50 years. An eventual frac-
ture should take place even later than that. 
A still simpler and more accessible approach to predict the creep strain of engineer-
ing components is based on a logarithmicly linear approximation of the creep modulus, 
E(t): 
log [E(t)/E(to)] = ~ log (t/to) log [E(1000 h)/E(1 h)]. 
3 
(8.28) 
Values of the I-h and 1000-h moduli are generally given in the technical literature 
(e.g. 104). At 20°C and at small stresses (5 to 20 MN/m2 ) the ratios of E (1000 h) 
E(1 h) of common polymers are of the order of 0.96 (SB), 0.92 to 0.93 (PC,PETP, 
fiber reinforced thermoplastics), 0.88 to 0.90 (PS, PVC, PMMA, POM), and 0.72 to 
0.79 (HDPE, PP, ABS). Whereas extrapolation methods are frequently the only means 
available they are subject to all the limitations introduced by the gradual development of 
structural weakening (demonstrated by the change from a decelerating creep rate to 
an accelerating one). Also the action of competing processes (creep crack develop-
ment) is generally not taken into account by this extrapolation method. 
In this section different approaches to predict creep amplitudes have been dis-
cussed. In order to calculate the time of creep failure knowledge of the "critical fail-
ure conditions" is necessary. In ductile failure the yield criteria will generally serve 
this purpose. For strain-hardening, fiber-forming polymers Section I may be consult-
ed. Concerning the latter case the observation of Takaku [310] is also interesting in 
that the true ultimate creep strain Ap . Ab attained by partially oriented polypropylene 
fibers after prolonged loading was independent of the extent of preorientation Ap. 
252 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
These fibers seemend to fail once a predetermined, stress- and temperature-depen-
dent state of orientation had been achieved. 
A final remark concerns the effect of the state of stress on failure mode and time. 
The term 00 in Eq. (8.20) has been taken to represent the macroscopic uniaxial stress 
00 in the event of uniaxial stretching - or the largest principal stress component Oy 
in the event of multiaxial states of stress. This does not mean that the times to frac-
ture of tubular and uniaxial specimens are always identical if only Oy is equal 00. As 
discussed above the creep functions in these two cases are described by different po-
tentiallaws, namely by Eqs. (8.25) and (8.26) respectively. 
A systematic study of the effect of the state of stress on the lifetime of PVC 
tubes has been carried out by Smotrin et al. [151]. They found that at short times 
to fracture (at stresses of 50 MN m- 2 ) the simple Rankine criterion 0 < 0* repre-
sented their failure data in two-dimensional stress space. With increasing times to 
fracture, however, the von Mises criterion gave the better representation. Gotham 
[152] studied the uniaxial creep failure of 15 different polymer materials at 20°C. 
Within a time range of up to 107 s he observed brittle failure with injection molding 
grade PMMA, PS, SAN, and glass-fiber reinforced PA 66, and ductile failure for PP, 
bulk cast PMMA, PC, PSU, PVC, ABS, POM, PA 66, and P4MP. 
4. Creep Crack Development 
The development of a creep crack is the dominating failure mechanism of non-or.iented 
thermoplastics at smaller stresses (see diagrams Figs. 1.4, 1.5 and 8.39). The fracture 
surface morphology of a typical creep crack is reproduced in Figs. 1.7 and 8.36. The 
final failure of these samples had been caused by crack growth over the whole wall 
thickness. 
The pattern of creep-crack failure shows the three well-known phases: a period 
tj of apparently homogeneous deformation up to the point of crack initiation, a 
period ta of thermally activated slow crack growth, and a final period tr of unstable

253 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
crack growth. An inspection of loaded samples during and after the creep experiment 
reveals a number of morphological features: 
-
creep cracks initiate at flaws or material inhomogeneities, more often in the sur-
face zones (Figs. 1.7, 8.36 a) but also in the bulk material (Fig. 8 .36 b) [I 11, 117, 
118,311,312]; 
the initiated crack grows through thermal activation during a period ta under 
apparently constant conditions; this is evidenced by the appearance of the "mirror 
zone", the frequently ideally circular or semicircular, smooth interior fracture 
surface (Figs. 1.7, 8.36 b); depending on the stress level the mirror zone may ex-
tend over almost the complete wall thickness of tubular specimens; 
at higher magnifications of the mirror zones it can be seen that the surfaces are 
not smooth on a molecular level; in the case of amorphous PVC an irregular, rough, 
and scaly surface is observed and in the case of semi-crystalline PE a cellular, locally 
highly drawn surface morphology becomes apparent (Fig. 1.8); 
inspection of some transparent tubular samples under load and of non-transparent 
samples after an interruption of the creep test showed that in those PVC and PE 
pipes creep crack development started rather late in the experiment, i.e. tj was 
larger than 0.90 tb [Ill, 117]; in PP tubes the first creep cracks could be detect-
ed at tj being about 0.5 tb [117]. In other cases, especially in particle initiated 
fractures, the thermal growth period ta can be much larger than the initiation 
period tj. Johansson [312] reports this for high quality PVC pipes where he found 
up to 100 simultaneously growing cracks. 
Morphological effects on the initiation of creep cracks were also studied by Stock-
mayer [I 18]. Using an elaborate peeling technique he transformed whole tube sec-
tions into thin films of up to 0.06 mm thickness (Fig. 8.37). The walls of LOPE tubes, 
transformed into films of 0.9 m2 area, then were scanned under a microscope for 
flaws or material inhomogeneities (Fig. 8.37). Inhomogeneities could be detected in 
every tube and have been related to an imperfect blending of the LOPE with carbon 
black [118]. Stockmayer also found two interesting correlations: 
Fig. 8.37a. Part of a film cut from LOPE tube ,;,all showing inhomogeneous blending in extrusion

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
Fig. 8.37b. Section of a film cut from LDPE tube wall showing spots which are free from carbon 
black. (Courtesy P. Stock mayer, (118» 
creep cracks were initiated preferentially in those zones which also contained 
(the most) inhomogeneities (Fig. 8.36 shows such creep cracks) 
tube lifetimes were greatly reduced if the creep cracks had been initiated in the 
outside or inside zones of the wall; from an ensemble of tubes tested at 80°C 
and having an average lifetime tb of 2340 h tubes with inhomogeneities (and crack 
initiation) in the boundary zones failed after a 1;, of 740 h; tubes with crack initia· 
tion in the central region of a wall lasted to 1;, = 7400 h, i.e. a factor of 10 longer 
[118, 149]. This correlation is clearly brought out by the plot shown in Fig. 8.38. 
Although the differences in stress distribution within the pipe wall due to frozen-
in tensions may have influenced crack initiation, it seems to be more probable that 
network defects are mostly responsible for this observation. As discussed in Sec-
tion III B2 the inner walJs of extruded pipes are especially exposed to thermal 
degradation. It was precisely in this region that Stockmayer and Wintergerst found 
the origins of the most rapid failures [118]. 
To test the influence of the observed irregularities further the authors performed 
tensile drawing and static loading experiments on samples cut from the peelings. In 
these experiments, there was practically no correlation between yield stress and time 
to failure on the one hand and kind and concentration of flaws and inclusions on the 
other. However, the effective elongation of films containing defects was much smaller 
since the necking samples generally broke whenever the neck had reached the defect. 
This behavior confirms the statements made before namely that in these cases creep 
craze nuclei must be considered as network defects which are not detectable in short 
time loading tests unless the defective zone is locally subjected to large deformations. 
The term "network defect" needs some deliberation. As indicated before many 
of those defects are created during sample fabrication. If they are due to particulate 
inclUSions, imperfect blending, or oxidation during processing, they exist from the 
very beginning of sample life; in these cases a sizeable portion of the sample life may 
in fact be used for defect growth (ta - tb)' However creep cracking is also observed

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
In Fig. 8.39 long term test results with HDPE pipes are plotted [117b]. In this 
case the a-t curves reveal three regions, the well known, slightly inclined portion on 
the left-hand side (ductile failure), the somewhat steeper creep-crack region, and a 
vertical portion. The studied material (Hostalen GM 5010 T2 of Hoechst AG) resists 
better to creep cracking, consequently the slightly inclined "ductile portions" of the 
curves extend to longer times than those for the HDPE material represented in Fig. 
1.7. 
Kagan et al. [121] have studied the effect of supramolecular structure on the 
time-dependent strength of HDPE. They found a good correlation between the 1-h 
(plastic) creep strength and the yield strength for materials of different crystallinity, 
density (0.945 < p < 0.960 g cm- 3 ) crystallite size, and spherulite diameter. These 
parameters hardly affected the activation volume r but slightly the activation 
energy of the plastic deformation process (parallel displacement of the ductile branch 
of the a-log t/to curve). On the other hand they found a clear tendency to higher 
long-term brittle strength (resistance against creep crack formation) with an increase 
in density and size of crystallites and with a reduction of spheruIite diameter. Gaube 
et al. [117] also report that an increase in crystallinity (Le. density) of PE, PP, PETP, 
paM, PA leads to a higher yield strength - at lower strain values - and to a higher 
ductile strength. They point out, however, that the decrease of brittle strength in 
the steep region begins sooner, the higher the crystallinity and the lower the molec-
ular weight. The ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene GUR does not show creep 
crack formation at all. Judging from these observations the process of creep crack 
formation seems to be related to the gradual disentanglement of chains and the ease 
of void opening in the inter-crystalline and/or inter-spherulitic regions. A similar con-
cept has recently been proposed by Lustiger et al. [313] who assume that the inter-
lamellar disentanglement of chains causes the creep cracking of PE pipes. 
The vertical drop of the a-t diagram (Fig. 8.39) so far has only been observed at 
higher temperatures. After extended studies of this phenomenon Koppelmann et al. 
[363] and Gaube et al. [117 b] have assigned this complete loss of mechanical strength 
to the increasing thermal degradation after exhaustion of the thermal stability of the 
material (as evidenced by the coincidence of the reduction of the oxidation induc-
tion time at 200 °c to zero and the rapid drop in strength). 
To summarize the observations with failure under constant load: three mecha-
nisms are of importance which generally have quite different kinetics. Creep prevails 
at higher stresses, the corresponding times to failure depend strongly on the applied 
stress; creep crack formation is observed at smaller stresses, in semi-crystalline ma-
terials possibly caused by disentanglement or pull-out of chains leading to a branch 
of the a-t curve with a somewhat steeper slope; it is noteworthy that in the presence 
of an active environment this steeper branch is very often shifted, mostly towards 
smaller times to failure [107, see also Section III B4]; the third mechanism, auto-
accelerated oxidation, is only observed at elevated temperatures and after exhaus-
tion of the thermal stability; after initiation oxidation occurs at increasing rates so 
that on a logarithmic timescale it appears equivalent to instantaneous degradation 
and loss of strength [107, 117b, 363]. 
Concluding this section one may say that there is very little evidence that the 
loading and breaking of chains controls the creep of unoriented polymers. The soft-
257 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
ening mechanism - common to all linear polymers [122,128,154] - responsible for 
the change from decelerated to accelerated creep is generally related to segmental 
motion and changes in intermolecular attraction but not to chain degradation. A 
search for free radical formation in creep of non-oriented polymers carried out by 
Jansson et al. [125] is as yet also inconclusive. These authors had included radical 
scavengers in PVC which led to a considerable reduction in creep rate (by a factor 
of up to about 10). They state, however, that it has not been possible to separate 
the stabilisation effect from the effect of mechanical reinforcement [125]. 
c. Homogeneous Fatigue 
1. Phenomenology and Experimental Parameters 
Polymeric engineering materials subjected to strong mechanical and environmental 
excitation show - as any other material - a gradual degradation of their performance 
including eventual failure. If the property changes are mostly due to chemical reac-
tions one speaks of corrosion, or of radiative degradation. The term fatigue (Zerriit-
tung) is used if a deterioration of material properties is caused by the repeated cyclic 
or random application of mechanical stresses. The synergistic interaction of mecha-
nical and environmental attack leads to the phenomenon of environmental stress 
corrosion (ESC). The role of molecular chains in ESC, and in corrosive, thermal, and 
radiative degradation will be discussed in the fmal Section of this Chapter. The fa-
tigue of polymeric fibers has already been treated in Section 1 F of this Chapter. 
The present Section, therefore, will deal mainly with the principal aspects offatigue 
and with isotropic thermoplasticS. The fatigue of polymeric engineering materials 
has received a growing attention in the last thirty years. Review articles on this com-
plex subject have appeared from time to time; the reader is referred to the ones au-
thored by Andrews [126], Manson and Hertzberg [127-128], Oberbach [129-130], 
Schultz [131], and, more recently, by Sauer et al. and Takemori [314,315]. A com-
prehensive monograph on this subject has been written by Hertzberg [316]. In addi-
tion, a large number of research papers have been published of which an incomplete 
listing is given in this Section [116, 132-147, 153,317-324]. 
It is the general observation that failure in repeated loading occurs at load levels 
which are lower than the stresses sustained under the conditions of static loading 
(creep) or of monotonously increasing deformation (drawing). The lower the stress 
level to which a material is subjected the larger the number N of load cycles which 
are sustained. The total time tr, however, which a fatigued sample spends under 
load is generally. much smaller than the time to failure under static loading condi-
tions. Load reversals or load interruptions have an accelerating effect, therefore, on 
the loss of load bearing capability; load reversals or interruptions constitute the ele-
ments of fatigue. It may already be stated at this point that the accelerating effect 
of load reversals has to be related to two characteristic material properties: 
-
the anelastic response which leads within each loading cycle to a diSSipation of 
mechanical energy as heat and 
258 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
the occurrence of molecular rearrangements which may lead to the disentangle-
ment and slip of chain segments, to local reorientation, and/or to the formation 
of voids. 
It has to be expected, and must be recognized, therefore, that three principal 
mechanisms may contribute to fatigue failure: thermal softening, excessive creep or 
flow, and/or the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks. 
The experimental parameters of a fatigue test have been aptly defined by An-
drews [126]: 
a periodically varying stress system having a characteristic stress amplitude, .:lo; 
a corresponding periodic strain amplitude, .:lE; 
a mean stress level, am; 
a mean deformation, Em; 
a frequency, v; w = 21TV; 
a characteristic wave form (sinusoidal, square, etc.) for both the stress and strain; 
ambient and internal temperatures, which in general will not be precisely identical; 
a given specimen geometry, including notches, if any. 
More recently the (computer-programmed) random loading has also found grow-
ing application in testing structural components [132]. Of course, the above para-
meters can be combined in different ways and be changed within a test. They par-
tially depend upon each other and on environmental conditions. 
The experimental equipment will not be described here, the reader is referred 
to the cited review articles or pertinent research papers (e.g. 132-138). In practice 
five different types of stress-strain control are employed which are classified by 
Andrews [126] and Manson et al. [127] as: 
-
periodic loading (between fixed stress limits, in tension or compression); [133-
135] 
periodic loading (between fixed strain limits, in tension or compression); [133-
135] 
reversed bending stress (implicit in flexing a sheet in one dimension); [136] 
reversed bending stresses in two dimensions (by rotary deflection of a cylindrical 
specimen); [137] 
reversed shear stresses, e.g. obtained by torsional deformation. [138] 
2. Thermal Fatigue Failure 
In cyclic loading of a viscoelastic solid an amount of energy .:l W is dissipated per 
cycle. For sinusoidal loading in the anelastic range, one obtains 
o(t) =oosinwt 
.:lW = 1TOo EO sin D. 
(8.29) 
(8.30) 
This hysteresis heating leads to a noticeable temperature rise. At low test fre-
quencies and low stress levels the temperature increase of the test specimen generally 
approaches a finite value. A PA 6 sample for instance fatigued at 50 Hz, at a constant 
stress amplitude of 8 MN m- 2 , and at an ambient temperature of 21°C, assumed a 
259 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
stable temperature of27 °c after some 104 cycles [139-140]. At this temperature 
mechanical energy input and thermal energy loss were in equilibrium. 
At higher frequencies w, higher ambient temperatures, or higher stress amplitudes, 
however, the energy input into a sample becomes larger than the heat which can be 
transferred out of the sample through conduction or radiation. Depending on the 
experimental setup, failure of the sample then occurs through thermal softening and/ 
or plastic flow. The stress and frequency range, where this type of thermal failure 
has to be expected, can be calculated from the energy input, the geometry, and the 
thermal properties of a sample. Thermal equilibrium in a cylindrical sample of radius 
R is reached once 
(8.31) 
approaches zero. The highest temperature, Te , observable at equilibrium in the center 
of the cylinder then amounts to 
(8.32) 
Ta designates the ambient temperature, h the coefficient of convection at the 
sample surface; and the constants p, cp' and X have their usual significance as den-
sity, specific heat, and heat conductivity of a material. The term X/pcp is also known 
as temperature conductivity number. For conventional polymeric materials this num-
ber assumes values between 1.0· 10-7 m2/s (PTFE) and about 2.1 . 10-7 m2/s 
(HDPE, POM). 
It should be mentioned at this point that the hysteresis heating I::. W in a fatigue 
test with constant-strain amplitude decreases with increasing temperature, since I::. W 
is proportional to Go sin 8, i.e. to E". Under this condition thermal equilibrium can 
generally be established. The same effect, a decrease of E", can of course be reached 
if a sample is plasticized. The plasticization of an engineering component subjected 
to fatigue at constant-strain amplitude can be, therefore, a suitable way to prolongue 
the fatigue life of the sample [152]. Machyulis et al. [152] point out that the thermo-
stabilization, the fatigue-stabilization, and the plastization effects of various additives 
on polyamide are riot related to each other. For optimal results on fracture energy 
and cycles to failure Kuchinskas et al. recommend diffusion stabilization from a 5% 
ethanolic quinhydrone solution at 343 K for 1 h [152]. 
The conditions of thermal failure are especially discussed by Oberbach[129-130] 
for a variety of polymers, by Zilvar [139-140] for PA 6, and by Alf [141] forPMMA 
and unsaturated polyester resins. 
It is only through their effect on the above constants and on the complex modu-
lus E* that the molecular chain structure influences thermal failure. In the context 
of this monograph this type of failure will, therefore, not be discussed any further.

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
3. Wohler Curves 
The common observation that the number of cycles to failure, NF , depends on the 
stress or strain amplitude is generally represented in the form of Wohler curves (Woh-
lerkurven, S - N curves). Such a representation accounts for the fact that stress (or 
strain) amplitude and number of load cycles are the most important of the many 
(and closely interacting) parameters which affect the fatigue life. 
The fatigue data represented by Figure 8.40 were obtained from fully reversed, 
uniaxial tension-compression tests at 0.1 Hz with temperature rises Te-Ta below 
2 K [142]. The three different regions of the S - N curve of polystyrene are fairly 
typical for the fatigue-life curves of other glassy polymers as well. In region I crazes 
form during the first tensile quarter cycle. The fatigue behavior is essentially that of 
a pre-crazed sample. Failure occurs through the initial slow growth of a crack through 
craze material followed by catastrophic crack propagation. The number of cycles to 
failure NF is strongly influenced by the stress amplitude, presumably through the 
strong dependency of the number of crazes on the stress level. 
Region-II fatigue fracture is characterized by the fact that a period of craze nu-
cleation precedes craze growth and the formation, slow growth, and catastrophic 
propagation of a crack. This type of fatigue fracture is observed at stress levels 
just below the immediate craze initiation stress aj. The dependency of N F on a is 
considerably reduced. This accounts for the delay in craze initiation as well as for the 
reduced rate of slow crack growth at lower stress levels. The slope (~ 14 MN m-2 
per decade of NF ) seems to be characteristic for a variety of polymers [142, 153]. 
The long-life region III essentially forms the endurance limit of the material. 
The dependency of a on NF is extremely small. Crack initiation has a very long in-
cubation period. Analysis of the fracture surfaces of fatigue failures in this region 
reveals furthermore that the slow crack growth mode has two phases. The first shows 
little evidence of crazing, the second resembles the region-II failure mode. 
The above considerations concern polystyrene fatigued by completely reversed 
stress (am = 0, .1a = 2 a). In principle similar observations are also made with other 
polymers and at other conditions of stress, e.g. under constant maximum stress at 
various stress amplitudes [127, 153]. At this point it should be emphasized that the 
"fatigue process" under conditions II and III comprises at least two phases: an initial 
phase of crack or craze initiation with an apparently homogeneous response of the 
material and a second phase of heterogeneous fatigue with localized and growing

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
material discontinuities (fatigue cracks). The second phase in turn comprises several 
modes of crack propagation (thermal and athermal growth, catastrophic failure). 
This will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9. 
The discrimination between homogeneous and heterogeneous is certainly useful 
although not necessarily always significant. Most of the kinetic theories of failure 
treated in Chapter 3 encompass the two phases of crack initiation and slow crack 
growth. Thus they implicitly assume that the entity of molecular rearrangements 
between the application of load and the end of the slow crack growth period can 
be described by one constitutive equation. 
4. Molecular Interpretations of Polymer Fatigue 
Different experimental observations permit the conclusion that the prolonged peri-
ods of craze or crack initiation at lower stresses are not simply due to the reduced 
probability for crack nucleation in an otherwise unchanged material. The nature of 
the changes occurring on a molecular level during sample fatigue have been investi-
gated by several authors [e.g. 138,143-147,153]. Thus molecular mobility, inter-
action, and damping have been studied by the torsion pendulum [138,134-144] 
and by infra-red technique [138], molecular packing and defect structure by density 
measurements and X-ray scattering technique [144-146] and by the use of samples 
of different molecular weight [153], and morphological changes by the recombina-
tion kinetics of trapped free radicals [146]. The results obtained from these different 
experimental methods characterize the molecular rearrangements, but they do not 
yet permit the establishment of quantitative fatigue limits. 
Through simultaneous application of several of these methods Sikka [144] has 
been able to characterize some molecular rearrangements in homogeneous fatigue. 
He fatigued in cyclic extension thin ftlms (0.075 mm thick) of polystyrene (Tricite) 
and polycarbonate. Subsequently he investigated these films by Fourier transform 
infrared (FTIR) and mechanical spectroscopy and by X-ray diffraction technique. 
The fatigued PS samples were scanned under an electron microscope to detect any 
crazes that might have developed due to fatigue. No crazes were observed in the 
samples fatigued up to 2500 cycles. 
The FTIR results obtained on a PS film after 2500 cycles are shown in Figures 
8.41 and 8.42. In the superimposed FTIR spectra slight distortions of IR bands 
are noticeable in the frequency range of 900 to 1700 cm- 1 (Fig. 8.41). To detect 
minute changes caused by the fatigue process Sikka also recorded computer-sub-
tracted FTIR spectra. One such spectrum (fatigued-90% unfatigued) is plotted in 
Figure 8.42, the changes observed in this spectrum are listed in Table 8.5. However, 
as indicated in Section I C 1, great care must be taken in interpreting such difference 
spectra. 
From X-ray diffraction data Sikka obtained a mean Bragg distance dBragg of 
about 0.48 nm for the unfatigued PS films which showed a decrease of~ 0.01 nm 
in the fatigued sample (2500 cycles). This negative shift in dBragg was believed to be 
conclusive. It was related to the decrease in interphenyl and intraphenyl distances. 
The fatigue to 2500 cycles also resulted in a change of dynamic mechanical losses 
[144,317]. Figure 8.42 shows a plot of tan 0 versus temperature obtained at a fre-

tion; they noted that tan 0 exhibited a minimum on approaching the point of failure. 
The FTIR results seem to indicate that the fatigue process has caused changes 
in the absorption frequencies of various vibrational modes of the phenyl side groups. 
Also the IR bands associated with bending and stretching modes of CH2 groups and 
bending modes of CH groups show frequency shifts and band distortions. These 
results suggest that fatigue has modified the internal and external environment (in-
trachain and interchain interactions) of PS chains.

On the basis of these assignments and of his X-ray studies Sikka proposes that 
during fatigue weaker Van der Waal's and possibly some backbone bonds are broken. 
This has a twofold effect. The loosening of the structure permits on one hand the 
PS chains to locally rearrange themselves in a more perfect manner and to reduce 
the average intraphenyl and interchain distances. The local rearrangements are, on 
the other hand, accompanied by an increase in free volume in interstitial areas be-
tween the domains of improved order. 
In his experiments with polycarbonate films Sikka [144] used cyclic tensile 
stresses between 50 and 91 % of the yield stress. In the upper stress range the stress-
strain curve was clearly non-linear. He employed the same experimental techniques 
as mentioned before to study molecular fatigue effects. Sikka found some indication

of a stretching of the backbone chains. X-ray diffraction again revealed a change of 
the mean interchain distance. It amounted to a decrease of 1.25% after 5800 cycles 
under a tensile stress reaching 83% of the yield stress uy . No effects of fatigue on 
orientation could be detected in such samples by birefringence measurements. The 
densities decreased by a fraction of up to 0.083% to 1.1966 g/cm3 • 
Some dynamical mechanical loss data are represented in Figure (8.44). The 
Q and ~ relaxation peaks in fatigued samples appear at lower temperatures in com-
parison to the corresponding peaks in unfatigued samples. In all cases the samples 
fatigued to large numbers of cycles (> 2000 cycles at stress levels umax/uy > 0.56) 
fractured during the dynamical mechanical tests. 
Also in this case one has to conclude that under fatigue stresses chains are 
stretched and locally packed more closely whereas the overall free volume increases. 
The observations discussed in detail above seem to be representative for the 
fmdings of other authors as well. Bouda et al. [138] report a decrease of density with 
cycle number for PA 6 and PMMA which they ascribe to the formation of micro-
voids. The decrease of heat capacity in PMMA in the temperature range 350 to 
400 K, the decrease of tan l) at 93 K (1 Hz) and an increase in shear modulus G' in 
the range 100 to 250 K (where no crazes had formed) seemed to indicate a non-
uniform local volume contraction during the fatigue process. 
Schrager [134] investigated epoxy resins of different degrees of cure. A fully 
cured sample showed a monotonous decrease of G' and an increase in tan l). Notable 
is a complete and persistant recovery of G' and tan l) within 20 h. An incompletely 
cured sample responded to fatigue loading by an initial rise of G' (indicating comple-
tion of chemical cure simultaneously to chain scissipn in other parts of the matrix). 
After some 20 . 103 cycles chain scission and a decrease of G' dominated.

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
the defects have a compliance some 3 to 5 times larger than that of the bulk 
material 
the defects show viscoelastic behavior and a size distribution 
annealing close to the melting temperature leads to partial healing; the defects 
reappear if cycling is resumed 
form and size of the defects depend on crystallization conditions. 
These observations indicate that the defects are microvoids appearing preferen-
tially at interlamellar boundaries oriented perpendicular to the loading direction. 
Similar defects are observed in homogeneous deformation during static loading at 
those strains where the stress-strain curve begins to deviate from linearity [145]. 
Whereas Wendorff states that fatigue does not affect the crystalline regions of 
POM Nagamura et al. [146] report a change of the crystalline mosaic block struc-
ture of HDPE. They arrived at this conclusion by analysis of the trapping and decay 
behavior of ['-ray induced free radicals. 
Measurable macroscopic parameters which have been related to the progress of 
material fatigue are creep strain and strain rate [72, 116, 122, 123, 147,319]. Mindel 
et al. [122] studied the creep rate as a function of strain in pure compression of poly-
carbonate. They found that fatigue loading becomes effective through an increase of 
strain rate after each interruption of loading. Since the strain level after which ac-
celerated creep began remained constant (at 8.8%), fatigue lives were reduced. Ten-
sile creep has frequently been held responsible for the fatigue failure of polymers. 
In 1942 Busse et al. [72] suggested this mechanism for polyamide, cotton and rayon. 
Briiller et al. [147] stated cyclic creep strains were predictable from the Boltzmann 
superposition principle. Trantima has predicted cycles to fracture ofPP from creep 
rupture data [319]. 
Sauer et al. [153] studied particulary the effect of molecular weight on fatigue 
of PS and PE under different alternating stresses. They observed that an increase in 
molecular weight dramatically increases the fatigue life of PS (an increase of the 
number of cycles by a factor of 10 for an increase of M by a factor of 5). This effect 
is partly assigned to the retardation in craze initiation because of the fewer number 
of chain ends and the larger number of entanglements in high molecular weight 
samples. The major contribution derives, however, from the increased resistance of 
the crazed material to rupture (cf. Chapter 9.11). 
Comparing the fatigue behavior ofPE and PS Sauer et al. [153] conclude: 
in both crystalline polymers, like polyethylene, and amorphous polymers, like 
polystyrene, increases of molecular weight lead to increased fatigue lifetimes, for 
a given imposed alternating stress, and to increased endurance limits, 
the ratio of the estimated fatigue endurance limit strength to the nominal static 
fracture strength for specimens prepared from narrow molecular weight poly-
styrene standards rises appreciably with increasing molecular weight, from a value 
of 0.19 for a molecular weight of 160,000 to a value of 0.30 for a molecular weight 
of2· 106 . 
if fatigue failure due to excessive thermal heating is avoided, the resistance of 
polyethylene of medium or high molecular weight to alternating loading is con-
siderably greater than that of polystyrene, based on static stress values to produce 
either yield or fracture. Thus, at comparable molecular weights of about 2 . 106 , 
266 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
polyethylene gives an estimated ratio of endurance limit strength to yield stress of 
about 0.90 as compared to the 0.30 ratio for polystyrene, 
the greater resistance of crystalline PE to fatigue type failure as compared to 
amorphous PS is attributed primarily to two characteristics. The first concerns 
the phase of homogeneous fatigue. Because PE has a much lower amorphous-
phase T g and consequent greater molecular and chain mobility of its amorphous 
chains, it is much less sensitive to surface or volume flaws; and secondly, because 
of its heterogeneous nature, with crystallites imbedded in an amorphous matrix, 
it is also much more resistant to fatigue crack propagation (FCP). The latter phe-
nomenon which also strongly depends on molecular weight will be discussed in 
Chapter 9 (Sections IIc and IIIc). 
5. Fatigue-life Enhancement Through Surface Treatment 
Mechanical fatigue is an aging process which initially leads to localized volume con-
tractions (smaller interchain distances, smaller tan 8) [144,317,318], accompanied 
by defect formation [e.g. 144,145,153,314,315,317]. Depending on stress and 
temperature fatigue lifetimes are often dominated by the time-to craze initiation 
[314,320] and/or of craze propagation [314-316]. Since in most polymers crazes 
are preferentially initiated at surface irregularities there should be a strong influence 
of the state of the surface on fatigue behavior. In several of their research papers 
[321-323] and in their reviews [314] Sauer et al. have particularly explored this

interrelation. They indicate the following fatigue-lifetime reducing parameters: 
mechanical surface defects (scratches, inclusions) 
physico-chemical attack (crazing agents; solvants, which are the most "aggressive" 
if their solubility parameter is close to that of the polymer [321 ]) 
chemical attack (including thermal and oxidative degradation [232] and crosslink-
ing reactions) 
low sample molecular weight. 
All of these parameters enhance craze- and crack-initiation, the latter three also 
craze-fibril breakdown which leads to more rapid fatigue crack propagation (see Chap-
ter 9). Sauer et al. have also studied the parameters increasing the fatigue resistance 
of a specimen [314, 321-323]. 
They discuss specifically: 
-
mechanical and/or chemical polishing (for. example by exposing PS to the vapors 
of benzene or chloroform, see Table 8.6) 
. 
metallic surface coating (AI, Au; see Table .. 8.6) 
polar and hydrogen-bonding liquids (for PS it seems as if all liquids having a critical 
surface tension higher than PS had a b.eneficial effect [323]) 
-
low molecular weight oligomers(a 600 MWoligomer PS gave a 5 to 7 fold enhance-
ment of the mean fatigue life of PS) 
-
elastomer coatings (enhancement by a nitrile rubber up to 21 fold [322]) 
D. Plastic Deformation, Yielding, Necking, Drawing 
In continuum mechanics plastic deformation designates the transition from one equi-
librium state of the material to another. A perfectly plastic material should show no 
rate sensitivity and neither strain hardening nor softening. In accordance with the 
general practice in the polymer field [154-173] the term plastic will here be used in 
the larger sense of non-elastic, i.e. designating that part of the deformation which is 
not recovered at the temperature and within the time scale of the loading experiment. 
It is evident that plastic deformation in a polymer is brought about by some sliding 
motion of groups and/or chain segments past each other. The essential questions 
which arise concern the molecular nature of this motion, the correlation and interac-
tion of the elementary steps, and their effect on sample structure, strain, strain rate, 
and fracture behavior. A comprehensive treatment of the plastic deformation of 
amorphous and semi-crystalline materials is given in ref. [325]. It may be stressed 
again at this point that the propensity of a specimen for plastic deformation favors 
its ductile failure. All parameter changes which reduce the extent of plastic deforma-
tion (lowering of Tor Mw , increase of € or degree of crystallinity) will eventually 
provoke a ductile-brittle transition [292,294,296,420]. 
The first question, the molecular nature of the sliding mechanisms, is of central 
interest in several areas of viscoelasticity: mechanical spectroscopy, stress relaxation, 
creep (see Section II B) and flow (see Chapter 4 IV B and C). Most theories are based 
on the classical concept of Eyring that a particle in a potential well passes over a bar-
rier with the rate of flow steps depending on applied shear stress and on temperature. 
In his well-known theory of plasticity Robertson [162] considers the orientation-de-
pendent flexing of bonds. 
268 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
It is also recognized that (most) viscoelastic materials show stress and/or strain 
softening. Both, the increase in flow rate with shear stress and the structural weaken-
ing will give rise to a plastic instability which is called yielding. 
Shear yielding, i.e. the onset of large-scale intersegmental displacements within a non-
oriented thermoplastic polymer, has a distinct effect on the stress-strain curve. In ten-
sile tests a drop in engineering stress is usually observed and the yield point defined 
as the point of maximum load (Fig. 2.11, curves b and c). In other tests, e.g. in a com· 
pression test, there mayor may not be a load drop but a sudden decrease of da/de 
may be noticed. The important phenomenon of yielding has been intensively inves· 
tigated. Review articles have appeared almost annually in recent years in the general 
literature [e.g. 114, 156-160, 163, 164,415,416]. 
The classical continuum mechanical criteria for shear yielding have been dis-
cussed in Chapter 3, Section III A in terms of the three-dimensional state of stress. 
At this point molecular interpretations are reviewed in an attempt to assess the role 
of molecular backbone chains. 
Experiments at different temperatures, strain rates, and hydrostatic pressures 
have established that shear yielding is a thermally activated process [154-168, 
170-173,325-338]. According to Eyring's theory of flow (Chapter 3) strain rate 
can be expressed as 
E = A exp - (Uo - 'Ya)/RT. 
(8.33) 
This gives the following dependence of yield stress ay on strain rate and tem-
perature:

(8.34) 
This equation was found to be valid for a number of polymers (pVC, PC, PMMA, PS, 
CA) in more or less extended regions of temperature and strain rate [154,156,158]. 
The (temperature-dependent) activation volumes 'Y had at room-temperature values 
between 1.4 (PMMA) and 17 nm3 (CA). This means that according to this concept 
polymer deformation at the yield point is due to the thermally activated displace-
ment of molecular domains over volumes which are between 10 (PMMA) and 120 
times (PVC) as large as a monomer unit. It has been indicated by several authors 
[155-158,160] that the above criterion (Eq. 8.34) corresponds to the pressure modi-
fied von Mises criterion TO + I1P = constant. The coefficient of friction 11 is inversely 
proportional to 'Y. From an analysis of their experimental data (on PMMA, PVC, PC) 
according to Eq. (8.34) Bauwens-Crowet et al. [158] conclude that two flow pro-
cesses exist. They relate these to an a-process Gumps of segments of the backbone 
chainS) and to the {j mechanical relaxation mechanism. 
Argon and Bessonov [161] have recently presented a molecular model of shear 
yielding which involves the rotation of molecular segments against intra- and inter-
molecular forces and the systematic, pairwise reduction of kinks in a strained polymer. 
They calculate the free enthalpy of activation of a double kink in a small bundle of 
collectively acting molecules, LlG*, as 
269

LlG* = 31TGw2a3 '[1- 8.5(1-v)5/6 (~) 5/6],

(8.35) 
where G is the shear modulus, v Poisson's ratio, w the angle of bundle rotation dur-
ing the activation, and a the mean bundle radius. Having examined a large number 
of glassy polymers Argon and Bessonov find that the bundles comprise between 
about one (PMMA, PS), two (PPO), three to four (PC, PETP) or seven (PI) molecular 
chains. The distances between double kinks along the molecule range from 0.8 to. 
1.6 nm [162]. 
All of these proposed interpretations of yielding state that yielding is brought 
about by a displacement of neighboring chain segments under change of conforma-
tion. In the process of yielding of unoriented thermoplastics no large axial chain 
stresses are built up and no chain scission has ever been observed in strains below 
the yield strain €y. Yielding is equivalent to the onset of large scale orientational 
deformation. It is generally accompanied by a decrease of the material resistance 
against deformation, by a reduction of sample cross-section in a plane perpendicular 
to the direction of tensile plastic deformation and by a temperature increase due to 
the dissipated mechanical work. Material and thermal weakening at constant or in-
creasing true stress give rise to a plastic instability. In uniaxial tensile straining this 
instability manifests itself as 
-
shear banding [154-157], 
-
neck formation [165-175,334-338], see Fig. 8.32 b and d, 
-
homogeneous drawing [176-182], see Fig. 8.32 c. 
The phenomenon of crazing can also be regarded as a (although localized) 
deformational instability. It will be discussed in the next chapter. 
Neck formation has been investigated for a long time and under various aspects. 
For a non-linear elastic solid the states ahead and behind the neck can be derived 
from the conditions of continuity of mass, momentum and energy [338]. Bauwens 
[154] and G'Sell et al. [325, 335-337] have studied the influence of multi-dimen-
sional stresses on onset and propagation of a neck. 
Not persuing the continuum mechanical aspects any further some remarks will 
be made on the molecular rearrangements during yielding. The large scale "plastic" 
deformation associated with yielding quite naturally gives rise to shear and exten-
sional deformation of molecular coils. The response of molecular chains in solution 
to shear or extensional flow has been described in Chapter 5I1E. It has been stated 
that chain breakages are obtained if strain rates are suffiCiently large (generally above 
600 S-1). The strain rates in a yielding solid are conSiderably smaller. The local strain 
rates across the neck of a sample are typically 1 s-1 or less (Fig. 7.10). On the other 
hand molecular friction coefficients in a solid are so much larger than in a liquid that 
large forces will be transmitted once a chain molecule slips through the surround-
ing matrix. As discussed in 5I1E axial forces sufficient for chain breakage will be 
built up if the slipping chains have a highly extended conformation. It must be ex-
pected, therefore, that all those chain segments rupture as a consequence of necking 
or drawing which are properly oriented and which initially do have a highly extend-
ed conformation or assume such a conformation at the early stages of the yield pro-
270 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
cess. With regard to chain breakage in necking or drawing the total orientational 
strain A and the drawing temperature Td are the most important variables. 
There are very few reports on ESR investigations of chain rupture during necking 
and drawing [21,169,174-177]. These reports will be discussed in the following and 
be supplemented by observations with other methods: the IR spectroscopy of chain-
end groups [178] and the determination of molecular weight distributions [179,339]. 
Zaks et al. [169] investigated the neck formation in polycarbonate. As inferred 
from the reduction of sample cross-section in the neck, an orientational strain A of 
about 2 had been imparted onto the material while "passing through the neck". At 
room temperature and at various sample stretching rates corresponding to strain 
rates in the neck of between 0.02 to 2 S-1 , the authors [169] observed a fairly stable 
but not very well resolved ESR spectrum. The intensity of this spectrum increased 
with the rate of passage of undrawn PC through the neck from 3 . 1015 to 1.8 . 1016 
spins/g (Fig. 7.1 0). The authors also studied the behavior of stable nitroxide radicals 
and of radicals formed by photolysis during necking of LDPE and PC. The thus ob-
served increased decay of the initially present radicals may be assigned to the reac-
tion with newly formed radicals but, as well, to the strain-induced increased rate of 
recombination or decay of radicals already present. The existence of the latter phe-
nomenon in highly oriented HDPE, PP, PA 12, and PETP was pOinted out by Becht 
et al. [47]. 
The ESR technique had also been employed by Lishnevskii [174,175] who found 
that during cold drawing ofPP, PVC, PA 6, and aromatic polyamide fibers free 
radicals were formed in a concentration of between 8.1014 to 3.1016 g-l. 
Matthies et al. [176] noted the intense coloring of different polyoxamide and hexa-
methylene isophthalamide fibers during cold drawing. They confirmed by ESR measure-
ment that the formation of free radicals had given rise to the appearance of the color 
centers. In the case of the polyoxamide fibers they associated these color centers 
with the -NH-CO-CO-NH-group. The largest concentration of spins observed 
was 1 . 1016 g-l. 
The above ESR experiments [174-176] were carried out on cold drawn 
samples immediately after completion of the drawing procedure. Thus the measured 
radical concentrations [R] are integral values. Nothing can be said about the form of 
[R(A)], but, in all probability, most of the chain breakages have occurred during the 
final stages of the drawing procedure, i.e. within moderately to highly oriented and 
even microfibrillar structures. This assumption is supported by the ESR experiments 
of Levin et al. [21] and Chiang and Sibilia [177] with fibers partially oriented at ele-
vated temperatures. 
The hot drawing of PA 6 at temperatures of e.g. 150 to 210 °c permits one to apply 
orientational strains of up to A = 6 without breaking an observable number of chains 
[21]. As discussed in detail in Chapters 7 and 8-1, free radicals are formed if such fibers 
are stretched at room temperature. For a PA-6 fiber hot stretched to A = 3.7 radical 
formation began at an "additional cold" strain of 20%, i.e. at a total elongation of 
A = 4.44 [21]. PETP fibers hot stretched to A = 3 showed some radical formation 
at "cold" strains of between 5 and 20% but deformed by chain slippage thereafter -
up to a strain of 50%, i.e. to a total elongation of A = 4.5 [177]. In HDPE films no 
271 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
breakage of chains could be observed during cold drawing unless the draw ratio A 
exceeded 5 [178]. 
An infra-red study of the latter material also revealed [178] that the number N 
of coiled rotary isomers (chains containinggg andgtg conformations) depends on 
the draw ratio A. While N (A) is rather constant if A < 5, N decreases linearly at higher 
draw ratios to reach about 0.2 N (1) at A = 12. 
That chain scission occurs during drawing ofPA-6 multifilament yarn becomes 
apparent from an investigation of the molecular weight. Using a fractional precipi-
tation technique Sengupta et al. [179] determined the molecular weight distribu-
tions of undrawn yarn and of yarn drawn at 35°C to A = 2.92 and A = 4.20 respec-
tively. They observed that for the yarn drawn to A = 2.92 the molecular weight 
distribution is unimodal as in the undrawn fiber, but the peak is smaller and 
slightly shifted toward smaller values of M. At A = 4.2 this peak is further di-
minished and shifted and a second peak at low molecular weights (at less than half 
the viscosity number) appears [179]. 
It is a common observation [360] that repeatedly extruded polymers decrease 
their molecular weight. Generally it is assumed that imposed shear stresses and tem-
perature Simultaneously influence the chain scission reaction. In the case of PC ex-
truded at temperatures between 275 and 320°C Abbas [339] found that this re-
action had an activation energy of 113 kJ mol-1 ; it occurred to a much larger extent 
during extrusion than in simple static heating. However, he explained this difference 
by viscous heating and not as a direct consequence of stress-induced chain scission 
(see also IIIB2). 
Indirect evidence of the likely occurrence of chain scission was proposed by 
some researchers. Davis et al; [170-173] studied the pressure sensitivity of the rate of 
plastic deformation of high Mw LDPE. From the pressure sensitivity of the rate of 
plastic deformation they derived a zero-pressure activation volume of 0.266 nm3 
which they suggested to correspond to the activation volume 'Y for the breakage of 
a PE chain. Oprea et al. [417] noted an increased solubility of PVC after stressing. 
From the presented evidence it must be concluded that during the initial stages 
of necking and drawing (A < 3) of semicrystalline polymers chain breakages do not 
occur in large numbers. This conclusion is completely in accord with the Peterlin 
model of the "plastic deformation" of semicrystalline polymers. As described in 
2.11 B the early stages of plastic deformation comprise the destruction of an original 
spherulitic texture and its transition to the new microfibrillar structure. During the 
transition interspherulitic tie molecules are most highly loaded and some are ex-
pected to break. The ties between the crystal blocks, however, are generally not 
severed at this stage and are instrumental in establishing the microfibrillar structure. 
The influence of the supermolecular structure before drawing on drawing behav-
ior and strengthening processes has also been discussed in Section I G and refs. [340-
342]. 
If at room temperature a semicrystalline polymer is carried from moderate to 
higher extension ratios (3 < A < 10) then chain breakages can occur [21,169,174-
178]. All of the mentioned breakages must be considered to be of the static-loading 
type (cf. 5 II B and D). They become possible in large numbers because the presence 
of laterally rigid crystalline regions permits: 
272 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
the static transmission of large axial stresses onto chains, 
the balancing of ensuing irregularities of stress distribution, and thus 
-
the widespread attainment of critical chain stresses before macroscopic break· 
down. 
In recent years ultra-high modulus fibers with draw ratios up to and beyond 35 
have received increased attention [180-182,257-276]. Their highly extended chain 
structure and their extreme mechanical properties (elastic modulus E up to 67 GN 
m-2 , Ub up to 7 GN m-2 ) have been discussed in IG, and the techniques for their 
processing (drawing, hydrostatic extrusion, solution spinning) are outlined by Bigg 
[180] and more recently in the review paper by Ward [257b]. As yet there is no 
information on the extent of chain breakage during drawing of these fibers. Capaccio 
et al. [181] point out that in very highly drawn PE (A = 30) much finer fibrils are 
present and these are characterized by an amazingly high concentration of longitu-
dinal discontinuities in the form of microfibril ruptures. Molecular defects (chain ends, 
folds) are certainly present in extended chain crystals - but not in quantities indicat-
ing major chain breakages during processing [180-182]. 
With the exception of PC non-oriented amorphous polymers have not given rise 
to measurable quantities of broken chains during yielding in tension. This behavior 
is the result of their different morphology. In the absence of crystallites, large axial 
torces leading to chain scission can only be caused by frictional loading of slipping 
chain segments. The volume concentration of chain breakages (because of the larger 
size of the slipping segments) is predictably much smaller than in semicrystalline 
polymers. In addition (and because of the absence of the equalizing effect of a 
microfibrillar substructure) macroscopic tensile failure begins before stresses and 
strains have reached a level sufficient for widespread chain scission. 
During necking or homogeneous drawing of many (transparent) polymers an 
intensive whitening is observed. The origin of this phenomenon are voids which are 
either formed in a correlated manner within crazes (cf. 9 II) or within shear bands 
or which appear in an uncorrelated manner within the deforming volume elements. 
Uncorrelated voids form in semicrystalline polymers (PE, PP) as well as in amorphous 
ones (PMMA, PVC) and in elastomers at cryogenic temperatures (BR, PI). Figure 
8.45a shows an electron micrograph of a crosS-5ection through the voided area which 
appeared during necking of a dry PA 6 monofilament [83]. The fact that the voiding 
starts in the center of the necking region and in dry monofilaments only, indicates 
that it is related to a triaxial state of stress. The coalescence of such voids may give 
rise to the fibrillar fracture shown in Fig. 9.49. The appearance of a thoroughly stress-
whitened PMMA is shown in Fig. 8.45 b [343]. Frank and Lehmann [344] have care-
fully analyzed the respective contributions of elastic and shear deformation and of 
void formation to the total tensile strain of PMMA. At small strain rates and at elevat-
ed temperatures there was practically no void formation. From the triaxiality of ini-
tiating stresses and from the absence of measurable intensities of free radicals in 
slightly drawn isotropic polymers (A < 3), from the absence of conspicuous molecu-
lar weight changes [179, 220], and from the reversibility of the formation of holes 
it must be concluded that the hole formation depends more on conformational 
rearrangements of chains and on surface free energy than on the breakage of chains. 
If there are chain breakages, their number must be small. It seems to be quite con-
273

ceivable that the kinetics and the significance of eventual chain scission events can be 
studied by the exoemission of charged particles during deformation. Preliminary in-
vestigations of Scherer and Fuhrmann [345] have already indicated the extreme 
sensitivity of this method (106 events per gram are traceable as opposed to 1014 by 
ESR). Measurements carried out with PE gave a strong indication that the emission 
of electrons during stretching was caused by the breakage of chains. A very strong 
maximum of exoemission was found to coincide with sample necking [345]. Some-
what similar qualitative conclusions were drawn by Betteridge et al. [346a] who stud-
ied acoustic emission (AE) and radical formation of some 10 different moulded ther-
moplastics and rubbers. They find that the more ductile samples are less acoustically 
active; in the others signals were emitted after stress-whitening had started and there 
was a certain "degree of comparability between acoustic and ESR results". In amor- . 
phous polymers (PMMA, PC) Matsushige et al. [346 b] observed AE events over the 
whole deformation range; those events occurring before the yield point were attri-

buted to the development of sub microcracks and their combination, the others to 
the drastic reorientation, extension and frictional movement of molecular chains 
during necking [346,411,412]. 
The material behavior described above referred mainly to uniaxial tensile defor-
mation. It will be different in techniques of working or forming of polymeric mate-
rials, such as rolling, sawing or grinding. These processes involve compressive, tensile, 
and shear deformation in a generally complex manner. Breakage of chains has been 
observed in various ways. In 6 IV Band 7 IC 3 a detailed account of the nature and 
concentration of free radicals formed in comminution has been given. Other me-
chano-chemical aspects will be discussed in 9 III D. 
E. Rupture of Elastomers 
In all preceding sections of this chapter polymer states have been treated where the 
forces acting between neighboring chain segments were of prime importance for the 
transfer of macroscopic stresses. In an (ideal) elastomer, however, intermolecular 
forces are small, the stress transfer occurs through the entropy-elastic deformation of 
the network chains. The basic principles and notations of rubber elasticity have been 
presented in Chapter 2 (Section II A), different fracture models in <;hapter 3, and a 
discussion of the entropy-elastic deformation of a single chain in Chapter 5 (Section 
IA). If one speaks of a "chain" in relation to a filled and cross-linked polymer net-
work one refers, of course, to the part of a molecule between adjacent points of at-
tachment (filler particle or cross-link). At this point the role of such chains in network 
deformation, the limits of chain extensibility and the mechanisms of network rup-
ture will have to be discussed. 
The deformation of ideal or phantom networks has been intensively discussed in 
the literature beginning just 50 years ago with the classical works of Kuhn, Meyer and 
Ferry, Guth and Mark, James and Gut [347a-d] and Flory [348a]. The essential 
point certainly is that the macroscopic deformation corresponds to the uncoiling of 
the network chains; thus entropy-elastic forces are exercised. 
From the general literature [348 a-c] it can be concluded that an average net-
work chain influences the deformation in several ways: 
the originally random chain conformation changes to a more extended one at a 
rate determined by strain, temperature, and internal viscosity, 
in highly cross-linked or filled rubbers many (of the shortest) network chains 
have been completely extended and are broken at the fracture elongation (cf. 7 II), 
additional physical cross-links are introduced through crystallization at high 
elongations, 
voids or cavities can be formed due to non-homogeneous distribution of strains 
in filled or unfilled elastomers, 
the limits of extensibility are reached once the majority of the network chains 
have transformed into a highly extended conformation. In the case of a homo-
geneously cross-linked network with n random links per network chain the largest 
breaking elongation Ab max will approach y'ii. At that strain all average chains 
oriented in stretching direction are fully extended (cf. 5 I A). 
275 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
Rupture of most technically important elastomers takes place at stretch ratios A 
smaller or equal to about 8 [183-195]. As shown in Figure 3.6 and indicated in the 
literature the reduced ultimate stresses 0b plotted versus elongation Ab form a failure 
envelope. The elongation to break Ab is shifted along the failure envelope (towards 
larger elongations if the temperature and/or the degree of cross-linking decrease or 
if the strain rate increases [183-195]. The macroscopic breaking stresses 0b are of 
the order of 1 to 30 MN m -2 (depending on degree of filling or cross-linking), they 
decrease with increasing time-to-failure and degree of swelling. 
It has been proposed by Mullins [183] some thirty years ago (and has since been 
known as Mullins effect) that the breakage of chains in a first loading cycle is respon-
sible for the softening observable in subsequent load cycles. In that respect the phe-
nomenology of the Mullins effect is comparable to that of the breakage of chains in 
the stretching of fibers. 
For the breakdown of a stressed rubber two basic mechanisms are conceivable: 
the initiation and growth of a cavity in a moderately strained matrix or the accelerat-
ing, cooperative rupture of interconnected, highly loaded network chains. It has 
generally been concluded that the second mechanism is of dominating importance 
under those experimental conditions which permit the largest breaking elongation 
Ab max to be attained [187,192,194,195]. In that case, the quantity Ab max was ex-
pected to be proportional to the inverse square root of the cross-link density ve; in 
fact an increase of Ab max with (Ve)-0.5 to (Ve) -0.78 was found experimentally for a 
variety of networks (Butyl, BR, EPR, SBR, SI, fluorinated rubber). Smith [187] 
concludes that the maximum elongation Ab max is the only feature of large defor-
mation behavior which clearly depends only on network topology .. 
At ultimate strains which are smaller than Ab max some chains are already highly 
extended but their number is insufficient for cooperative accelerating breakdown. 
It is the general opinion that under such experimental conditions the final break-
down occurs through formation and growth of cavities [184,185, 190]. It will not 
be further investigated at this point to what extent chain scission may accompany 
cavity formation and growth. It may be stated, however, that the chain scission 
mechanism does not determine the rate of cavity formation. 
As a final point it should be emphasized that elastomeric materials are showing 
a higher strength if they exhibit a multiphase microstructure [183, 184, 186, 188, 
195]. This may be achieved by incorporation of suitable filler materials (carbon 
black, silica); by crystallization under strain, or by blending or copolymerization 
with an incompatible polymer. The modulus and thus the load at a given deforma-
tion increase with the number of load carrying chains. The possible role of chain 
orientation, loading, and scission in these cases has been discussed in 7 II. 
The fact that the tendency for stress-induced crystallization of an elastomer in-
creases the stresses at comparable strains is clearlY'shown by Fig. 8.46a. 
A self-reinforcement S = (s - so)/so (through crystallization) can be defined 
through the deviation of the stress-strain curve from the Gaussian value (Fig. 8.46b). 
The higher A the higher the degree of crystallinity and thus the possibility of load 
sharing between different chains. The resulting, strongly non-linear stress-strain 
curve has a very beneficial effect in the presence of cracks or other defects: the 
highest loads are supported in the zone of highest deformation, i.e. at the crack tip,

thus leading to the self-reinforcement of the crack tip (see Fig. 8.47). The self-
reinforcement decreases with temperature (for NR from 9 at -40 °c to 1.5 at 
+ 100 °c [349a]. The temperature dependence of the tear strength of the elastomers 
shown in Fig. 8.46 closely parallels that of the self-reinforcement. 
-
The former statement that the breaking strain depends on the limited extensi· 
bility of a network of given topology must be modified, therefore, by admitting the 
influence of strain-induced crystallization [348-350]. Both the concentration Ve of 
permanent chemical cross·linking points and the intensity of temporary intermolec· 
ular interactions (such as caused by crystallites or entanglements) influence the stress 
at a given strain. In fact, Ve is quite well correlated with the constant C1 of the 
Mooney-Rivlin equation:

The constant C2 can be taken as a measure of the transient intermolecular inter-
action, it is for instance decreased by swelling and by repeated extension [349,350]. 
The ratio C2 /C I is the larger the more flexible (and spontaneously crystallizing) the 
chains are (Fig. 8.48). A comparison of Figs. 8.46 and 8.48 shows, however, that the 
self-reinforcement of the strain-crystallizing natural rubber is much more important 
than that of the more flexible, spontaneously crystallizing elastomers TPA and 
U-BR [349].

III. Environmental Degradation 
III. Environmental Degradation 
A. Aspects to be Treated 
Within the framework of this book the effect of thermo mechanical chain scission on 
the mechanical properties of polymers are to be investigated. Up to this point it has 
been tried, therefore, to separate and exclude environmental effects whenever pos-
sible. In many cases it was tacitly assumed that the variables investigated (e.g. strain, 
stress, temperature, sample morphology, free radical concentration) had been the 
dominating variables in comparison to e.g. humidity, oxygen content, chemical at-
tack, or effects of irradiation. It goes without saying that these environmental fac-
tors are of extreme importance to the service lives of polymer engineering compo-
nents. A considerable number of comprehensive recent monographs and handbook 
articles treat the environmental degradation of polymers (e .g. [196-203, 351-354 D. 
They deal in depth with those aspects of environmental degradation which cannot be 
discussed any further at this point: thermal degradation, fire and heat stability, chemi-
cal degradation, weathering, aging, moisture sensitivity, effects of electromagnetic 
and particle irradiation, cavitation and rain erosion, and biological degradation. For 
any detailed information on the above subjects and on methods and agents to protect 
and stabilize polymeric materials the reader is referred to the cited comprehensive 
references [196-203, 207-209, 353, 354]. 
It mainly remains to be discussed in this section the nature of the effect which 
the simultaneous action of mechanical and environmental parameters may have on 
mechanical properties. One of the most interesting phenomena in this field, the 
environmental stress crazing (ESC), will be treated in the next chapter. 
B. Chemical Attack on Stressed Samples 
1. Ozone Cracking 
A characteristic stress-induced degradation process is that of unsaturated rubbers in 
the presence of ozone. The rates of crack initiation and growth, of formation of free 
radicals, and of stress relaxation and creep are amplified up to and more than a thou-
sandfold by the action of ozone [196-197, 199,201,204-206]. The chemical reac-
tion is not completely understood. It is normally assumed that the first steps of ozone 
degradation of unsaturated polymers follow the "Criegee mechanism". 
Under the effect of molecular ozone the 1T-bonds of olefines are polarized and 
ozone joins the double bonds to form primary ozonides [196, 197 a]. Primary ozonides, 
-CH - CH-, are unstable, they either isomerize into iso-ozonide, -HC - 0 - CH-, 
~ 
o-if 
or polymerize, or decompose into chains terminated by a zwitterion, Rl COO-; and 
a carbonyl group, R2 CO, respectively. If a bond attacked by ozone is under stress, de-
composition can occur during the isomerization reation. 
279 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
The reaction with ozone obviously is a surface reaction leading to the formation 
of a surface layer of ozonides and/or further reaction products. This layer grows in 
thickness in proportion to the square root of the time of exposure [199]. With in-
creasing layer thickness ozone is gradually prevented from reaching undegraded rub-
ber. The mechanical aspects of ozone cracking are extensively reviewed in the cited 
articles [196-197,199,201,204-206]. It is unanimously reported that the degraded 
rubber material (natural rubber, SBR, acrylonitrile-butadiene, cis-polybutadiene) has 
a reduced strength and elasticity. Cracks open up and propagate at strains as low as 
5 to 12%; it has been estimated [199] that even at the tip of a slowly propagating 
crack strains do not exceed 30% (as compared with 700% in an undegraded matrix). 
As a consequence of the chemical destruction of the material at the tip of a crack the 
mechanical energy expended in crack propagation (material resistance R) is exceed-
ingly small. Employing the Griffith fracture criterion the various authors have ob-
tained values of 0.05 to 0.12 1/m2 from observation of macroscopic cracks [197a, 
199a, 204, 205] or of 0.4 to 0.5 1/m2 from micromorphological theories [206]. 
The formation of free radicals in unsaturated rubbers under simultaneous attack 
of ozone and stress is of particular interest. The primary steps of the above described 
reaction of ozone with unsaturated bonds do not lead to free radicals. In cis-poly-
butadiene (BR), natural rubber (NR), and acrylonitrile-butadiene (ABR), however, 
large quantities of peroxy radicals have been observed [206,208). As one possibility 
it was pointed out that these radicals may derive from the ozonides or zwitterions 
through unknown secondary steps possibly involving hydrogen abstraction or proton 
migration [197, 206, 208]. Another possibility certainly is that radicals are formed 
through scission of undegraded rubber molecules and that these primary radicals react 
with molecular oxygen. In BR and ABR the concentration of free radicals has shown 
the same dependency on strain and ozone concentration as the visual damage, i.e. 
the ozone cracking of the surface of the degrading rubber specimen. Notably the 
following observations may be mentioned [206, 208): 
no (detectable quantities of) free radicals are formed below certain threshold 
strains (of between 5 and 12%) 
for strains beyond the threshold strain the rate of increase in free radical concen-
tration increases initially linearly with strain and ozone concentration (in the range 
of 0.08 to 1.6 mg/l) 
-
increasing strain or ozone concentration lead to a preferential increase in number 
rather than size of microcracks. 
The number offree radicals (up to 8 . 1014 spins per cm2 rubber surface) cor-
responds at a given ozone concentration of 2.8 mg/l to the number of ozone molecules 
in a zone of surrounding atmosphere of 0.02 cm depth. This number is very much 
smaller than the total number of ozone molecules available in the ambient atmos-
phere of the degraded specimens. The linear dependency of radical concentration 
on ozone concentration and strain, therefore, means that potential radical sites are 
created only after the application of stress and in the presence of ozone molecules. 
The appearance of free radicals Simultaneously with crack opening certainly indi-
cates the breakage of chains during the process of crack opening. In Section I E of 
this chapter an analysis of the energy content of an unsevered hydrocarbon chain 
strained elastically up to clJ.ain scission had been carried out. This analysis leads to 
280 

III. Environmental Degradation 
the estimate that the 2 . 1014 chains per cm2 of new fracture surface can only be 
broken elastically if more than 9 J/m2 were expended in forming that surface. Since 
the observed surface work parameters are much smaller one has to conclude that 
under ozone attack the breaking and radical forming chains break at small strains. 
This interpretation looks identical to that derived from analysis of the behavior of 
ozone cracks. Its importance lies in the statement, however, that during crack open-
ing chains (of very low strength) are broken and not only broken chains are separated. 
The action of ozone on SBR, studied by Mergler and Wendorff [355], is explained 
along the same lines. 
In recent years the effects of an ozone atmosphere on chain breakage in strained 
PA-6 fibers [245] and PE fibers [246] have been investigated. In the former case there 
is a very distinct synergistic effect. The detailed mechanism, however, by which 
stressed chains react with ozone and break seems not yet well known. Excluding mono-
molecular chain scission Popov, Zaikov et al. [356] propose for HDPE, LDPE and iso-
tactic PP an increased reactivity of a stretched macromolecule towards a hydrogen 
acceptor such as ozone. From their hydrogen abstraction experiments with i-mem-
bered cycloparaffins they estimate that the reactivity of a CH2 -group towards ozone 
should increase by one order of magnitude if the excess strain energy of this group 
attains 0.3 kcal/mol or 0.5.10-21 kcal/bond [356b]. In fact they observe that the 
relative concentration of oxydation products in stressed polyolefins increases lin-
early with stress even at low stresses. The effect of stresses on elastomer oxidation 
has been reviewed by Popov and Zaikov [357]. 
2. Oxidation and Chemiluminescence 
The oxidative degradation of polymers, especially in the presence of UV irradiation 
has been studied intensively; it has been treated comprehensively in a number of 
monographs [208,209,353,354]. Most investigations in this field deal with the ef-
fect of degradation on the properties of polymers (e.g. 189,202,203,207, 20ge) or 
with an elucidation of the nature and kinetics of the intervening reactions [200,201, 
207,208, 209a-d]. In the context of this book only the possibly synergistic effect 
of a simultaneous application of mechanical stress has to be investigated. Several 
methods have been employed to determine the rate and the effect of oxidation: 
-
detection of light quanta emitted during the oxidation reaction (chemilumines-
cence [358,359]), 
-
detection of newly formed, oxygen containing groups by IR spectroscopy (see 
Sections Ib and c and [356,357,360,418,419]), 
-
formation offree radicals [245,246,360], 
-
decrease of residual strength [245, 246], 
-
change in other properties (Mn, MFI, elastic modulus). 
The latter two methods are evidently indirect ones. 
As the studies by George et al. [358] have shown chemiluminescence (in high 
strength PA 66 fibers at 40°C) can already be traced in the unstressed state; at a stress 
level of 0.5 Vb there is a five fold increase of oxidation rate with respect to the un-
stressed condition (see Fig. 8.49). Although the authors conclude that light emission 
arises from the bimolecular termination of alkyl peroxy macro radicals and that a

nescence intensity as a function of stress (from George et al. [358]) 
moderately applied stress increases the oxidation rate due to internal and external 
frictional heating it may be useful to take also into account the oxidation mecha-
nisms discussed in the preceding section. Stress-induced main-chain scission occurs 
at higher strains [358]. The sensitivity of the method permits shorttime testing of the 
effectiveness of additives (even of antioxidants added to foodstuffs [359]). 
As one of the first Kim [210] searched for a possible stress effect on the rate of 
oxidative chain degradation [209, 210]. She employed a constant-load technique 
which permitted to derive the relative number of network chains, N(t)/N(O), by com-
paring the Mooney-Rivlin plot, ao/(A.-I/A. 2 ), of an aging sample with that of a fresh 
sample. Her interesting results may be summarized as follows: 
The creep rate of polybutadiene rubber films loaded in ambient atmosphere was 
about a thousandfold larger than the creep rate under dry nitrogen. 
A comparison of the relative potency of the chemical agents present in the ambient 
atmosphere showed that the few parts per hundred million of naturally occurring 
ozone had a much stronger effect than the oxygen. 
In ozone-containing air a behavior comparable to that described above for higher 
ozone concentrations had been found. A critical stress of 0.1 MN m -2 had to be 
exceeded in order to influence the initial creep rate. The (initial) rates of chain 
cleavage dN(t)/N(O)dt were found to be independent of stress within a stress range 
of 0.1 < ao < 0.5 MN m- 2 and amounted to 2· 10-6 S-I. This phenomenon was 
explained in the same way as for higher ozone concentrations through formation 
and cracking of a degraded surface layer. Microscopical investigations of the sample 
surface confirmed such a statement. 
282 

III. Environmental Degradation 
In the absence of ozone the rates of creep and chain scission were greatly reduced. 
The effect of oxygen at room temperature was small and hardly any differences 
between creep rates in dry nitrogen, dry air without ozone, and ozone-free air of 
40% relative humidity had been observed. At slightly higher temperatures (49°C), 
however, creep rates in dry air accelerated whereas those in inert atmosphere 
(Argon) remained constant. 
-
From her experiments Kim concludes that in the initial phase of degradation in 
ozone-free oxygen stress or strain have no effect on the rate of chain cleavage. 
After the chemical degradation had reached a stage, however, where cracks 
opened up under stress, the straining of a sample accelerated the failure process 
of the specimen through stress concentration and change in cross-linking behav-
ior [210]. 
The general effect of cross-link density on the elastic modulus of an elastomer 
is indicated by Eq. 2.3. In their paper Landel and Fedors [189] consider the in-
fluence of a time-dependent cross-link density on the shape of the stress-strain 
curves of silicon, butyl, natural, and fluorinated rubbers. Introducing an additional 
shift-factor ax related to the cross-link density, they were able to represent reduced 
breaking stresses as a function of reduced time in one common master curve. 
Thermal and chemical degradation of cross-linked rubbers was also reviewed by 
Murakami [209c] who especially analyzed whether cleavage occurs along main chains 
or at cross-links. Depending on the nature of the chain and on that of the cross-links 
both mechanisms are observed. Natural rubber, radiation cross-linked to various 
degrees, showed at 20% strain and at temperatures of 80 to 130°C random scission 
of network chains. An EPT rubber cross-linked by tetramethyl thiuram disulfide 
(TMTD) showed degradation at the junction points of network chains. There the S 
and S2 linkages seemed to be preferred scission points. In TMTD-cured natural 
rubber both types of degradation occur simultaneously. The dependency of the 
stress relaxation curves on time, temperature, and initial cross-link density permitted 
discrimination between thermal and oxidative degradation. For differently cured 
natural rubber (peroxide-, irradiation-, TMTD-, and sulfur-cured) Murakami [209c] 
has tabulated the degradation mechanisms. 
The accelerating effect of mechanical stresses on chemical stress relaxation 
clearly became apparent through the comparison of continuous and intermittent 
stress relaxation. The relative stress relaxation, 1-0 (t, 71.)/0 (0, A), under continuous 
loading was the more pronounced the higher A and always consistently larger than 
under intermittent load application. Murakami [209c] also discussed possible increases 
of relative stresses due to cross-linking reactions and their partial prevention through 
radical acceptors. 
In a recent review paper [360] Scott details the mecharto-chemical degradation 
and stabilization of polymers. The strong influence of oxidative chain reactions on 
chain degradation in processing (of PP) becomes clear from the small changes in the 
melt-flow index (MFI) of melts protected by a stabilizer as opposed to the large 
changes of MFI of the unprotected material. Scott concludes that electron-accept-
ing antioxidants which break the oxidative chain (CB-A) are relatively more effec-
tive in the case ofmechanoradical formation than in thermal oxidation [360]. In her 
publications [418] and her extended review [410] on kinetics and mechanisms ofPP 
283 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
auto oxidation under stress Rapoport mentions a positive stress effect on the two 
oxidation initiation reactions (hydrogen abstraction and main-chain bond scission) 
and on the consumption of any inhibitor present. An intimate correlation between 
oxidative degradation and complete loss of load carrying capability of pipe materials 
at elevated temperatures [117b, 363] has already been observed and discussed in rela-
tion with Figure 839. 
The influence of thermal oxidation on the mechanical behavior of polymers has 
been known for a long time. The principal effects are reduction of molecular weight 
and/or cross-linking both leading to an embrittlement. If, for instance, the extrusion 
conditions of polyethylene pipes are not well controlled, layers of oxidized material 
are formed at the inside pipe surfaces [362]. These layers, which are very brittle, have 
been studied in detail by Gedde, Jansson and Terselius [362a, b]; the intensity of the 
oxidation was traced by two types of bonds: -C=O and -C-O-C- by IR reflectance 
spectroscopy. The thoroughly oxidized layers extended to a depth of some 20 to 
160 pm at the inside walls of some HDPE pipes extruded at 200°C. These layers were 
extremely brittle and cracked upon drawing at strains of a few per cent. The times to 
fracture in static loading of internally pressurized pipes (average hoop stress at = 4.2 
MPa, T = 80°C} and of uniaxial creep samples, cut from the wall, were conSiderably 
shorter in the case of oxidized material. The fmal cracks seemed to originate at a dis-
tance of 0.2 to 0.3 mm from the oxidized layer [362 a]. 
On the basis of these investigations four different layers could be distinguished 
in the oxidized HDPE pipes (distances s are with respect to the inner wall): 
s = 
0-100 pm thoroughly degraded, brittle material, Gt(s) = 0 
s =150-250 pm somewhat degraded, readily creeping material, Gt(s) small 
s =300-500 pm slightly damaged zone, Gt(s) - at 
s 
>500 pm normal material 
The slightly damaged zone still contains numerous defects which favors creep 
craze initiation, and it also offers the required stress level. This combination results 
in a high probability for an early crack initiation in that zone. The cracks then prop-
agate into the normal material. This mechanism explains well the observed shorter 
times to failure in oxidized pipes. In fact, Mtiller and Gaube report [362 c] that by 
carefully removing the oxidized layer the times to failure could be considerably im-
proved and were equal to those of undamaged pipes. 
The above explanation correlates also very well with an observation discussed 
earlier, namely that the time to fracture of LDPE pipes turns out to be shorter than 
the average lifetime whenever the final crack had started close to the inside or out-
side surface of the pipe wall (see Section II B 4). 
3. NOx , 502 
Igarashi and DeVries [245] had exposed strained oriented PA 6 fibers to N02 and 
S02 atmospheres. They performed subsequently tensile tests within an ESR cavity 
and also analyzed the sample molecular weight. They clearly demonstrated a distinct 
synergistic effect of sample straining during exposure to the different atmospheres; 
thus, residual strengths and toughness values were decreased (by up to 80% within 
5 days) by exposure to S02, NOx , 0 3 , (Fig. 8.50). They noted that the average sam-
284 

III. Environmental Degradation 
pIe molecular weight and the radical concentration produced in the final tensile tests 
of the N02 and 0 3 degraded samples were clearly diminished. For the mildly strained 
samples exposed to S02 they observed, however, a gradual recovery of strength dur-
ing subsequent annealing in air. From their studies they conclude that loaded tie-
chains are attacked and broken within 0 3 and N02 atmospheres; the S02 molecules, 
however, seem to attach themselves to the PA chains without breaking them if the 
stress levels did not exceede 70% of the yield stress [245]. This interpretation seems 
to be essentially correct. And some of the doubts forwarded by the authors can be 
resolved on the basis of the analysis given in the preceding chapter (7 IA). Thus, it 
must be expected that the relative decrease in free radicals produced in final frac-
ture, (No - Nj)/No, should be given by the slope of the radical concentration vs de-
formation curve (see Figs. 7.1, 7.4, 7.11); in view of the parabolic form of this slope

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
(No - ND/No will be much larger than the relative decrease of rupture strengths, 
(Go - Gi)/ Go where the subscript 0 refers to a reference sample and i to the sample 
exposed to the environment; as it should be, the authors measured a ratio of these 
two relative quantities of about 10 for the straining in air and values of between 3 
and 6 for the aggressive media. One point needs to be strongly emphasized again. The 
fact that tensile strength Gi and concentration of free radicals Ni are both adversely 
affected by an aggressive atmosphere must not mean that strength depends directly 
on the number of tie-chains present. As revealed by electron microscopy the chemical 
attack causes a surface degradation and thus an embrittlement of the sample (decrease 
of eb); this necessarily leads to a reduction of 0i = o(eb) and of Ni = N(eb)' This point 
is also underlined by the fact that the reduction of molecular weight during chemical 
attack and the reduction of free radical concentration are not equivalent: for identi-
cal Ni (3 . 1016 spins/cm3 ) different rupture concentrations have been determined 
from molecular weight changes, 1.4 '101S/cm3 in S02 and 5.3 '101S/cm3 in N02 
[245]. These authors have also tested some non-oriented PA 66 rods for which they 
observe a notable decrease in "toughness" (defined as the integral over the stress-
strain curve) at stresses which are about 5 times smaller than the stresses applied to 
the oriented fibers. This seems to explain why the observed chemical effect on the 
strength of the spherulitic polyamide was smaller [245]. 
Still smaller changes in strength were found by the same authors [246] for poly-
ethylene. This seemed to be primarily due to the increased tendency of the PE mole-
cules to slippage; this would prevent the build-up of molecular stresses large enough 
to further significantly the chemical attack. 
4. H2 0, Other Liquids 
With respect to the general effect of an active liquid environment on a polymer ref-
erence to the literature must be made [196-203]. This applies especially to quantita-
tive data concerning the reduction in strength accompanying the swelling or plas-
ticization of a material. The penetration of low molecular weight molecules into a 
polymer generally reduces the intermolecular attraction and facilitates chain slippage. 
In the case of hydrogen-bonded materials the possible interaction of the diffusing 
liquid with the hydrogen bonds has to be considered. 
In a series of experiments Hearle et al. [211] studied the effect of air, water, 
hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, and a laundering detergent on the strength and 
fatigue of PA-66 fibers. Their results show that the breaking strength of a PA-66 fiber 
immediately after immersion in water is 5% smaller than that in air. Pre-conditioning 
by immersion for 3 hours causes an additional strength reduction of 3%. Immersion 
in aqueous solutions of NaOH and Hel with ph-values larger than 2.5 has an effect 
similar to that of water. In the range of ph-values between 2 and 0, however, strength 
decreases linearly with decreasing ph up to a strength loss of 20%. Notable is the ob-
servation that the pre-conditioning of fibers before making a fatigue test (by rotation 
over a wire) does not reduce the fatigue life additionally. This may be explained by 
the fact that the slow growth rates of a fatigue crack starting from the surface permit 
the environmental agent to always penetrate the crack growth region [211]. 
A distinct synergistic effect of stress and humidity on the strength ofPPTA 
fibers (Kevlar® 49) has been reported by Morgan et al. [421]. They suggested that 
286 

III. Environmental Degradation 
hydrolytic cleavage of the amide linkage contributes to the - modest - degradation 
of strength at 65°C: a loss of 0.9% per year of residual strength while stressed at 5% 
RH at 20% of ultimate stress; the loss increased to 18%/year at 100% RH and 20% 
ultimate stress; it amounted to 12%/year at 100% RH unstressed. As the authors 
point out, the principal mechanism of mechanical failure was not chain degradation 
but microvoid formation and coalescence [421]. 
The partial penetration of a liquid or vapor into a matrix establishes concen-
tration gradients which do lead to a direct mechanical action through non-uni-
form swelling or to indirect actions through the nonhomogeneous relaxation or 
distribution of stresses. These actions are even enhanced in the presence of ther-
mal gradients and may cause rapid crack or craze formation. In the case of a slowly 
penetrating environment in a well entangled, homogeneous matrix the induced stresses 
generally can be accommodated elastically or viscoelastically. For example in poly-
carbonate sheets exposed to artificial weathering no cracking becomes apparent even 
after severe cycling of temperature and humidity [212]. Within a relatively short 
period of 30 to 32 months of outdoor weathering. however, a network of surface 
microcracks developed on the side exposed to the solar radiation. By comparison 
with artificial UV irradiation the authors [212] were able to show that the photo-
chemical degradation of the surface layer introduces defects and lowers the strength 
of the polymeric material to such an extent that physically induced non-homoge-
neous stresses cause microcracking rather than being accommodated. The physical 
effects of liquid environment on crack or craze formation will be further discussed 
in 9 II D. A special case of chemical stress cracking of acrylic fibers has been reported 
by Herms et al. [364 a]. They observe the generation of periodic microscopic trans-
verse cracks in oriented acrylic fibers immersed in hot alkaline hypochlorite solution. 
This phenomenon is greatly accelerated by external tensile stresses; it is ascribed to 
bond cleavage involving cyclization of nitrile groups followed immediately by 
N-chlorlnation and chain scission. 
A whitening phenomenon induced by some non-solvents on highly oriented 
PMMA is described by Sung et al. [364b] and related to the entanglement density. 
Microvoids also form in PC exposed to different non-solvents [364 b] or hot water 
[364c]. Shen et al. [422] have studied the effects of sorbed water on the mechanical 
properties of low and high molecular weight PMMA. They suggest that sorbed water 
up to a concentration of 1.1 % acts as a mild plasticizer; at higher concentrations 
water clustering occurs and the samples fail in a brittle manner. 
In the case of ftlled polymers evidently possible reactions of the environmental 
agent with the filler must be taken into account (see for example the stress corrosion 
data for glass-fiber reinforced PETP reported by Lhymn and Schultz [365]). 
The references given in Section III of this chapter are deliberately incomplete. 
They serve only to underline the points under consideration. For details the reader

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
C. Additional Physical Attack on Stressed Samples 
1. Physical Aging 
Although time and temperature are highly important parameters in environmental 
degradation their unique action - physical aging - will not be considered at this 
point. Nevertheless it should be indicated that aging influences environmentally im-
portant variables such as the rates of stress relaxation, creep and diffusion [366]. 
2. UV 
Photo-chemical degradation is probably the most important factor of environment. 
The cited monographs [196-203,207-209] treat in detail the primary processes of 
photon absorption, electron excitation, energy transfer through excitons, lumines-
cence, phosphorescence, and radiationless transitions, chain scission and free radical 
formation, secondary reactions, stabilization and protection, and the effect of irra-
diation on the mechanical properties. Here only one point can be touched: the ac-
celerating effect of UV radiation on microcrack formation in loaded polymers [74, 
213-214]. 
As indicated by Tables 4.4 and 4.5 photon energy in the spectral range of 
250 < A. < 360 nm is larger than the dissociation energy of C-C bonds. The high 
energy tail of solar radiation extends to about A. = 300 nm. Chain scission in UV and 
solar light is, therefore, energetically possible. In the near UV in unprotected glassy 
polymers quantum yields of the order of 1 . 10-3 to 60 . 10-3 are observed [209b]. 
The principle mechanisms of the synergistic action of load and UV radiation 
may be discussed using the few data available. The simultaneous application of ten-
sile load and UV irradiation to oriented polymers clearly accelerated the formation 
of free radicals and/or of micro and macro cracks in PA 6 [213-214,367] and in nat-
ural silk, cotton, and "triacetate" fibers [213]. No effect was observed in PMMA [213]. 
The experiments on cotton and triacetate fibers revealed that at low tensile stresses 
(00 < 70 MN m -2) the UV irradiation reduced the lifetimes of the fibers by more 
than 4 orders of magnitude. Under these conditions the absence or presence of 
oxygen was of some, but minor, importance since the irradiation in vacuum led to 
only slightly longer lifetimes than the irradiation in air. In a range of stresses with 
70 < 00 < 220 MN m -2 no oxygen effect on the lifetime of triacetate fibers became 
apparent. In this stress range the irradiation effect decreased with increasing 00. For 
00> 220 MN m-2 the lifetime depended only on stress and not on the environ-
mental factors UV irradiation and oxygen content. With cotton fibers a somewhat 
similar behavior was observed although the upper stress limit was smaller and de-
pended on absence or presence of air [213]. The desci"ibed behavior points to the 
existence of three failure mechanisms which are occurring simultaneously and at 
different rates: oxydation, UV degradation, and creep. An effect of oxydation was 
observed for the acetate fibers only at lifetimes tb > 5 . 103 s and in the presence of 
UV radiation. At shorter lifetimes, 100 < tb < 5 . 103 s, failure was essentially due 
to irradiation. At very short lifetimes (and higher stresses) oxydation and UV degrada-
tion were irrelevant if compared to the stress effect. 
288 

III. Environmental Degradation 
The determination by X-ray scattering of the number of microcracks in a PA-6 
fiber stressed in air at 128 MN m-2 gave the notable result [214] that the rate of 
microcrack accumulation increased almost instantaneously (from 5 . 1016 m-3 S-1 
to 110 . 1016 m -3 s-l) with the application of UV irradiation. The rate decreased 
to its initial value in the same abrupt and repeatable manner when UV was switched 
off after 104 s. Irradiation of an unstressed sample did not cause any micro crack 
formation and did not influence subsequent formation rates. In a previous study 
[213] it had been shown that UV irradiation of stressed PA-6 and natural silk fibers 
in a helium atmosphere increased the accumulation of free radicals. In that case the 
rate of radical accumulation at 200 < Uo < 600 MN m-2 decreased with the length 
of the time of irradiation and reached a steady state concentration N(R) after 
5 . 103 s. In PA 6 at a stress of 600 MN m -2 the concentration N(R) was of the 
order of 1024 m-3 ; this is about the limiting concentration observed in purely stress-
induced chain scission also. 
From these results the following conclusions can be derived. The photodegrada-
tion of unstressed PA 6 in air most probably is a random oxidative chain scission 
process [215]. Based on a study of the formed ESR spectra Heuvel et al. [216] con-
cluded that amide bonds in the amorphous regions are broken leading to R-CO and 
NH-R' free radicals. Subramanian et al. [215] propose formation ofhydroperox-
ides and keto-intermediates at the Q-CH2 group and a subsequent hydrolytic break-
down at the RCO-NHCOR' bond. It must be assumed that in PA-6 in air under the 
combined action of UV and stress all chain segments in the amorphous regions are 
possible fracture sites and not only the most highly stressed ones. The rates of chain 
degradation and cross-linking may depend on chain stress through the mechanisms 
discussed below. In the absence of oxygen, UV irradiation accelerated the breakage 
of chains but did show a saturation at a concentration NCR). This result can be 
explained if one assumes that in irradiated and stressed PA 6 preferentially those 
chains are broken and are prevented from recombination which are most highly 
stressed. 
Several mechanisms are conceivable through which the UV degradation of highly 
extended and stressed chains would be facilitated. In the first place the decrease of 
bond dissociation energies through electronic excitation and tensile stress has to be 
mentioned (cf. 4IIB). In the case of ionized hydrocarbon chains, bond dissociation 
energies are as small as 100 kJ/mol (Table 4.6). As outlined in Chapter 7 bonds of 
such energy require rather small stresses for breakage (about 1/4 to 1/5 of the 
strength of a non-ionized chain). In addition to the reduction of the dissociation 
energy an increase in local thermal excitation - due to energy transfer or dissipa-
tion - may have an effect. Chain orientation and segment conformation also 
influence the effective stability of a chain. Very little is being said in the literature 
about the relation between molecular order and UV resistance. Reinisch et al. [217] 
investigated the influence of sample orientation on photo-chemical degradation. 
They found that highly drawn PA-6 fibers (A = 3.9) had an even higher degradation 
resistance than undrawn material. Krtissmann et al. [218] indicate that the reactivity 
(in photooxidation) of N-vicinal methylen groups in trans conformation is 60 times 
that of those in gauche conformation. These data [213-218] were obtained for 
quite different specimens and experimental conditions. They do not yet permit a 
quantitative estimate as to the importance and interaction of the above mechanisms. 
289 

S. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
In recent years a few additional publications have appeared [245,246,367, 
368-370]. For PA 6 a clear synergistic effect between orientation, state of stress, 
and UV irradiation is observed [245, 367]. The fact that non-oriented samples were 
much less sensitive to UV irradiation seems to be due to the smaller stresses exerted 
on the loaded chain segments. UV irradiation of PP films led to an accelerated de-
crease of remaining strength, formation of oxidation products and decrease of mole-
cular weight; the latter parameter was in fact the most sensitive and could be used 
for damage control [368]. An interesting observation was made by Saidov et al. who 
studied the stress-induced shift of the 975 em -1 IR band of UV irradiated PETP. 
They found that the "true tension of breaking bonds" during UV irradiation de-
creased from 11 to 10 GPa [369].

III. Environmental Degradation 
Hennig and Zaengler investigated the weathering behavior of stressed PMMA 
[370]. They report that craze initiation and fracture of loaded Plexiglas 8H were 
accelerated by natural weathering (see Fig. 8.51). Through biaxial orientation the 
fracture strength under natural weathering conditions could be made to practically 
coincide with the long term strength under laboratory conditions, i.e. 50% rh, 23 °c, 
no UV (Fig. 8.51 b). It seems as if the difference in sample deformation (which is 
smaller in the case of the oriented material) explained these results. 
3. Particles and 'Y-Irradiation 
Electronic excitation, ionization, radical formation, oxidation, and cross-linking are 
also the principal processes occurring in polymer solids subjected to nuclear radiation 
(a, (3, 'Y, nucleons). In view of the fact that the molecular mobility influences the ki-
netics of degradation and cross-linking a synergistic stress effect is conceivable but not 
yet provcn. TIll' ClIrrent ill\l'stig:lti()ns aim at an understanding of the interrelation 
between irradiation characteristics (dose and dose rate, atmosphere), network struc-
ture, degradation, and macroscopic properties after irradiation [198,200,219,371-
375]. A literature survey listing (the 124 most important) papers of accelerated-
aging tests for predicting radiation degradation of organic materials has recently been 
prepared [373a]. A special word may be said with respect to electron-beam induced 
fracture of polymers [374,375]. Dickinson et al. [374] irradiated the highly stressed 
material at the tip of a crack with a pulsed beam of 1.6 keY electrons. They noted 
an accelerated crack growth, increase of gas pressure and light emission in phase with 
the electron exposure_ This observation points to the thermal and/or direct degrada-
tion through electron interaction of the stressed polymer (PI, IIR, PE) and to the 
break-up and removal of the degraded material in the highly stressed zone - in 
analogy to the ozone degradation of stressed rubbers (Section III, B 1). Selective 
rupture of only the most highly stressed chains has to be excluded in view of the 
rather low level of the applied chain stress. The radiation stability of unstressed 
aromatic group containing polymers has been studied by Sasuga et al. [375]. They 
established the following order of radiation stability: 
polyimide > PEEK> polyamide> polyetherimide > polyarylate > PSU > ppo. 
4. Electric Fields 
In very high electric fields partial discharges and breakdown of polymer insulating 
materials is observed [e.g. 376-383]. This phenomenon, which in the presence of 
moisture occurs in the form of so-called "water-trees", is related to the accumulation 
of space charges and the formation of microcracks. It will be discussed in more detail 
in Chapter 9.

In Chapter 8 principally the contribution of spatially homogeneously distributed 
molecular rearrangements to polymer fracture was studied. The term spatially 
homogeneous referred to the absence of flaws, inclusions, cracks, or notches of a 
size sufficient to act as a stress concentrator. Under those conditions during an initial 
phase of external loading damage development or growth is homogeneously distri-
buted on a macroscopic scale. Heterogeneous fracture now is defined as the converse 
of homogeneous fracture or briefly as fracture through crack propagation. In this 
case cracks, notches, inclusions, or accumulated crack nuclei act as macroscopic 
stress concentrations and essentially confine further damage development to the 
close proximity of the then existing defect(s). The phenomenon of crazing has been 
included in this chapter because of the well observable structural irregularities and 
305

despite the fact that with increasing stress new crazes can be fonned at arbitrary 
nucleation sites. 
The development of fracture through cracks will be treated in this chapter fol-
lowing the fracture mechanics approach. In view of the extensive, competent, and 
recent literature on this subject prime attention will be given to the effect of chain 
properties (length, structure, strength) on crack propagation and on fracture me-
chanics parameters. 
I. Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) 
A. Stress Concentration 
It is intuitively clear that the presence of a crack or a defect leads to a local increase 
of stresses, strains and stored elastic energy. The linear-elastic fracture mechanics ap-
proach describes this influence quantitatively by providing an analytical procedure. 
To a first approximation at some distance from a crack the solid under consideration 
is treated as an elastic continuum. Griffith [1] was the first to formulate and apply 
the fracture mechanics concept. From the balance of elastically stored energy (U) 
and energy to produce new surface area (rcA) he derived his well-known fracture 
criterion for isotropic materials containing an elliptical crack of length 2 a (Eq. 3.13). 
In the last 50 years this fracture mechanics approach has been systematically devel-
oped to account for partially anelastic and/or plastic behavior of solids for various 
crack and sample geometries, and even for material heterogeneities: In all cases it has 
been - and still is - the aim of the fracture mechanics analysis to derive generally 
valid quantitative criteria for crack stability and crack propagation behavior. Criteria 
are being sought which are as much as possible independent of the state of external 
and internal stresses and of crack and sample geometry and which depend principal-
lyon material functions such as material resistance R (RiEausbreitungswiderstand), 
critical stress intensity factor Kc (kritischer Spannungsintensitatsfaktor), and elastic 
modulus E. 
A detailed account of the development of the theory of fracture mechanics is 
given in the series Mechanics of Fracture [2]. From the extensive general literature 
on this subject only a few works may be cited which deal with the deformation and 
fracture of engineering materials [3] or specifically polymers [4--6,229] and stan-
dards [8]. A clear and rigorous presentation of the fracture mechanics of polymers 
is given by Williams [229]. 
For the determination of the material functions Rand Kc three experimental 
methods of controlled crack propagation are predominantly used (Fig. 9.1): 
-
Mode I, crack opening or tensile mode (einfache RiBOffnung) 
-
Mode II, sliding or in-plane shear mode 
-
Mode III, tearing or antiplane shear mode. 
F or details of these methods, their evaluation, and possible influences of sample 
geometry on the resulting "material" functions the reader is referred to the general

mode, II sliding or in-plane shear mode, III tearing or anti-plane shear mode 
literature cited [2-8]. In this Section the most frequently used crack opening mode, 
namely mode (I). will be considered (for nomenclature see [8c)-f)]). 
For a uniaxially stressed isotropic, elastic, thin plate containing an infinitely 
sharp edge crack a state of plane stress arises which has a singularity at the crack tip 
[3-8], for r ~ a the components of stress are expressed as

The coordinates r and (J are indicated in Figure 9.1. The quantity KI determines 
the intensity of the stress field without affecting its shape. It is accordingly termed 
stress intensity factor. The stress intensity factor takes into account both the exter-
nal (uniaxial) stress Uo and the crack length-a:

where f(a/D) is a correction factor of the order of unity which derives from the fmite 
specimen dimensions and crack configuration [3-8]. The stress intensity factor can 
be considered a much more general measure of the criticality of the state of a stressed, 
cracked plate than 00 or a individually. 
In the case of a thick plate the lateral contraction of the material at the crack tip 
is hindered; a state of plane strain prevails and in addition to Ox and Oy a normal 
stress Oz exists: 
(9.5) 
In plane strain and for r ~a the components of displacement in the x-direction 
(u) and the y-direction (v) are obtained [6] as:

(9.8) 
Whereas the stresses show a singularity for r -+ 0 the displacements go to zero. 
Through the introduction of a crack into a (thick) plate under constant uniaxial stress 
00 the elastically stored energy in the vicinity of the crack tip is increased by the 
fmite amount W: 
W 
B 
(9.9) 
Concurrently work 2 W is expended by the external system to maintain the uni-
axial stress 00. The total elastic energy Ue decreases, therefore, by W. This apparent 
paradox was pointed out by Eshelby [9]. If the crack is extended by /l.a then the 
stress field is shifted by /l.a in the x-direction and its energy content increased by 
(6W/6a)/l.a; an energy increment of the same magnitude is set free by the stress 
release accompanying the failure of the highly stressed crack tip material. It is the 
latter energy increment which is termed energy release rate GI :

For a thin plate (state of plane stress) the terms (1 + v) in Eqs. 9.6 and 9.7 and 
(1 - v2 ) in Eqs. 9.8 to 9.10 have to be replaced by unity. In view of the discussion 
308 

I. Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) 
later it is important to determine how the energy is distributed around the crack tip. 
Following Irwin [10] the elastic strain energy within a cylinder of radius rl around 
the crack tip is (per unit of plate thickness): 
(9.11) 
Whereas the energy content W(rl) increases proportionally to rl the local energy 
density w(r) decreases as l/r; for large distances from the crack tip it attains Wo = 
a5J2 E, the strain energy density of an isotropic, elastic solid. From Figure 9.3 it is 
readily seen that increasing a by D.a = r I sets free an amount of stored energy GI D.a 
which is a factor of (8 - 8 v)/(5 - 8 v) larger than the elastic energy stored within a 
cylinder of radius rl around the crack tip. This ratio is independent of the absolute 
value of rl' In other words any crack propagation step in an ideal elastic material-
even the smallest - releases elastic energy in a material volume several times larger 
than that immediately surrounding the crack tip (volume 1TD.a2B). Experimentally 
it is seen that a triangular zone bounded by a plane connecting the crack tip with the 
lateral face is unloaded.

Plastic deformation is especially pronounced in polymeric materials. The electron 
micrographs presented in this Chapter provide ample evidence of this fact. It will be

necessary, therefore, to study whether and how the fracture mechanics approach 
derived for an elastic material can be applied to elastic-plastic solids as well. The ef-
fect of plastic deformation on the stress distribution at a crack tip is well docu-
mented [3-7]. An elastic-plastic material under quasi-elastic conditions, for instance, 
begins to deform plastically wherever the state of stress meets the yield or flow 
criterion. Plastic deformation begins in the region of largest stresses, i.e. in the prox-
imity of the crack tip; it limits the components of stress to the yield stress UF' In 
order to maintain the mechanical equilibrium stresses must be raised (up to the yield 
stress) in more distant regions. Thus the plastic deformation has the effect of in-
creasing the effective crack length [3-7]. Two common approaches to calculate the 
effective crack enlargement through plastic deformation have been proposed: the 
von Mises shear yield criterion [4,6,229] and the normal stress criterion (Dugdale 
. model [7, 229]). 
From the von Mises yield criterion together with Eqs. (9.1) to (9.3) one derives 
the shape of the plastic zone (r < rF) for a state of plane stress as [6]:

In a moderately thick plate one finds a state of plane strain in the center and of 
plane stress at the lateral faces. This leads to the well-known dog-bone shape of the 
plastic zone. 
The Dugdate model [7] recognizes the effect of the plastic deformation in front 
of the crack tip in a different way. It considers a virtual crack which includes the 
plastic zone - of size rp - and it treats the yield stress as a superimposed stress acting 
normally on the boundary between the elastic and the "plastic" zone. The superim-
posed stress tends to bend the surface of the virtual crack. A consideration of me-
chanical equilibrium gives [6, 7, 229]:

The occurrence of small scale yielding in a material has two consequences: 
it limits the elastic energy density to u} /2E 
it may render uncritical a given KI (a given combination of Uo and a). 
The previous considerations do not answer three important questions: 
are there any limits to the extent of plastic deformation if KI is increased? 
-
what happens to the size rp of a plastic zone or to the length of a crack if KI is 
maintained constant for some time? 
-
what are the limits of validity of the Kl-concept at large plastic deformations? 
From experiment one knows that there are indeed limits to the extent of plastic 
deformation, that a crack can grow in a stable manner at constant K1, and that crack 
blunting limits the validity of the Kl-concept [229, 232]. 
It must be one of the main objectives of fracture mechanics to give quantitative 
answers also to these three questions. 
C. Material Resistance and Crack Propagation 
At small values of KI the elastic-plastic deformations described above lead to me-
chanical equilibrium, that is crack length a, crack opening displacement 2 va and the 
size of a possibly present plastic zone remain practically constant. However, if KI 
exceeds a certain threshold value Ki then small vanations caused by thermal fluc-
tuations, stress relaxation, creep, and/or material weakening can disturb this equilib-
rium and cause the plastic zone to widen and/or to partially disintegrate: the crack 
grows. 
Propagation of a crack occurs if the energy release rate G1 is sufficient to account 
for the material resistance R, i.e. for all modes of energy consumption related to the 
propagating crack. The condition for crack growth is written, therefore, as 
G1(a, t);;;" R(a, t). 
(9.19) 
At low crack propagation rates kinetic energy terms in R can be neglected. 
Then the material resistance will include the specific surface energy 2 'Y (to overcome 
the cohesion of atoms or molecules across the newly formed surface area), and the 
energy terms V re of elastic retraction of stressed molecules, V pi of plastic deforma-
tion, and V ch of chemical reactions including bond scission. The release of internal 
stresses (Ui) or chemical reactions with the environment (Uch) may subtract from R: 
311

(9.20) 
In general - and especially with polymeric materials - R will be a function of 
crack length, specimen geometry, and extent and rate of plastic deformation at the 
crack tip. A schematic representation of the change of R(a) in static loading of a 
ductile, strain hardening material is given in Figure 9.4. A crackao grows if~{ao) > 
R{ao); if GI{ao) = R{ao) it continues to grow if the slope of the line GI{a), i.e. aG/ 
aa, is larger than the change of material resistance with crack length, aR/aa. For an 
arbitrary energy release rate GI with R{ao) < GI{ao) < Ge{ao) crack stability will 
again be achieved at a new valueal >ao where G{a) intersects R{a) (cf. Fig. 9.4). If, 
however, GI{a) is equal to or larger than that Ge{a) which forms the tangent to the 
static R{a)-curve, then the rate of energy release will always be sufficient to account 
for the material resistance: the crack will grow continually. In this case the provided 
energy release rate GI{a, t) exceeds the static material resistance R{a - 0) and the 
rate of plastic deformation at the crack tip and consequently R will be increased 
until a new equilibrium is found: 
R{a =1= 0) = Ge{a) = ~(t). 
(9.21) 
The term Ge is the (critical) energy release rate for slow crack growth. The 
larger G, the rate of release of provided elastic energy, the larger a, the rate of crack 
propagation. This behavior is especially well demonstrated by PMMA. In Figure 9.5 
the data of Doll [30] are represented. It is also noted that the crack speed shows an 
instability at a critical value Gle , termed critical energy release rate for unstable frac-
ture (in this book the term Gee will also be used [8g)). 
Thus, in most polymeric materials three G zones of crack propagation behavior 
can be distinguished: 
-
rio crack growth at ~ < Gj (stable crack) 
-
slow crack growth at Gj < GI < Gee (subcritical crack growth) 
-
rapid crack propagation at GI ;;J!: Gee. 
,The latter two regimes will be discussed in the following sections.

D. Subcritical, Stable Crack Growth 
The instantaneous loading of a sample to any value of KI above the Kj threshold 
provokes the following steps: 
elastic loading of the crack tip region (in impact in the form of stress waves), 
viscoelastic, time-dependent response of the material, 
structural reorganization (including plastic deformation) in the vicinity of the 
crack tip within the so-called "fracture process zone" which in an inorganic crystal 
may ideally be as small as an interbond distance (0.3-0.6 nm); in brittle polymers 
(PMMA, epoxy resins) it is of the order of some J,Lm, in plasticized or ductile poly-
mers it can be of the order of the specimen dimensions [229, 240, 245]. 
Sub critical crack growth occurs through material weakening within the fracture 
process zone and by displacement of the latter. The fact that constantly new material 
will be affected by the process zone, material, which will resist for a certain time, ex-
plains the relative stability of the phase of sub critical crack growth. Evidently, the 
rate of crack growth is governed by the laws of material deformation and breakdown. 
As an important point it must be considered that the macroscopically determined 
laws may not be valid at molecular levels. On an atomic scale these laws have been 
studied preferentially for non-polymers such as silica glass [246] or metals [247]. At 
such a level the continuum description breaks down (parabolic crack-tip contours 
of atomic dimensions are physically meaningless). Such studies must be done, there-
fore, by computer simulation [247]. Using a lattice model with a discrete "cut-off 
distance" for the cohesive forces Esterling [248] discusses equilibrium and kinetic 
aspects of brittle fracture. He concludes that at this level the condition oG = 2'Yoa 
is no longer valid. As to be expected crack growth (or closure) will be governed by 
the "kinetic barrier", i.e. by the energy it takes to bring the next atom pair to the 
cut-off distance.

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
In view of the much larger stress transfer lengths of chain molecules fracture-
process zones in polymer materials will be more extended. In many cases they are 
amenable to direct observation by transmission electron microscopy [249] or to 
indirect observation through traces left on the fracture surface, see Section 9 II and 
III). In principle the failure mechanisms at a crack tip are the same as in the bulk 
under comparable conditions of state of stress, loading rate etc.: flow and failure of 
a ligament, formation of voids or secondary cracks and their coalescence, craze for-
mation and rupture, chain orientation, scission and slippage. All these mechanisms 
have been observed and all of them are sttess-activated. 
The sub critical growth data obtained by several investigators [12-15] for PMMA 
have been compiled in Figure 9.6. The double-logarithmic plot reveals an extended 
linear section (growth rates ti from 10-8 to 10-2 m/s for K-values1 from 0.8 to 
1.4 MN m-3/ 2). Several relations between KI and ti have been established. One of 
these has been found to describe the subcritical crack growth of many polymers 
[3, 12, 13]: 
ti=AKf 
(9.22) 
with A and b being empirical constants, depending on material, environment, tem-
perature, etc. The constant b has been related to l/tan /j of the ~ relaxation [12]. 
For the linear portion the exponent bin Eq. (9.22) can be determined to be 
25 ± 2 [13]. 
From Eqs. (9.22) and (9.4) one can determine the time .::It necessary for the

I. Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) 
If one chooses as upper limit Kcc [Sg] and as lower limit KIm, i.e. that value of K 
which corresponds to the largest flaw or defect present in the sample, then one ob-
tains as At the lifetime tb of the sample under constant stress. The extremely strong 
exponential dependence of At on KIm makes tb very sensitive to flaw size. Increasing 
the size of the largest flaw,am, by only 10% decreases the lifetime tb by a factor of 3. 
The above considerations on the dependence of tb on the size of inherent flaws 
have been extended by various authors [13, 16~ 17] to a method of predicting the 
creep life of glassy polymers. In a first approach it was assumed that the size am of 
the largest intrinsic flaw can be determined from the breaking stress ab in short time 
loading according to Eq. (9.4): 
(9.24) 
Broutman and McGarry [17] thus obtained intrinsic flaw sizes of 50 p.ffi for PMMA 
and of 620 fJm for PS. Berry [40] reports values of between 60 and 225 fJm for 
PMMA. These values seem to be very high since no direct optical observations of such 
flaws have been reported. They are also two to three orders of magnitude larger 
than the diameters of microcracks found by Zhurkov et al. in PMMA and listed in 
Table S.3. 
It must be concluded, therefore, that the flaw sizes inferred from a tensile ex-
periment according to Eq. (9.24) are by no means inherent but the result of stable 
crack growth during the experiment. 
Starting from this consideration Doll and Konczol [250] carefully studied the 
fracture surfaces of a large number of long-time tested PMMA dumbbell specimens. 
The fracture surfaces (Fig. 9.7) offered the usual pattern: a semi-circular mirror zone 
(slow crack growth) and a subsequent region covered with parabolae (rapid crack 
propagation). In the center of the mirror regions they frequently found semi-circular 
markings having radii of 
79 ± 31 fJm (23°C) and 
lOS ± 55 fJm (50°C) 
which could very well correspond to former craze zones (Fig. 9.S). The development 
of an existing defect into an unstable crack in PMMA would then occur in the fol-
lowing manner: 
a preexisting defect (a few fJm or even less develops within Atl into a craze zone 
(fairly rapid development up to the temperature dependent size of 70 to 160 fJm) 
followed by a period At2, the growth of the mirror zone (slow growth up to 
several 100 fJm, depending on stress); the final breakdown occurs by rapid crack 
propagation (At3). 
If the time At2 is taken to account essentially for the total time-to-failure tb of 
a loaded specimen then the length a 1 of the craze zone can be calculated from 
Eqs. 9.23 and 9.4 for each pair of values ao and tb (Fig. 9.9). In doing so Doll 
and Konczol determined al to be 70 to 100 fJm (23°C), 100 to 140 fJm (50°C) and 
114 to 160 fJm (60°C). These values are obviously in excellent agreement with 
those found for the markings on the fracture surfaces; this coincidence strongly sup-
ports the proposed fracture mechanics concept of the rupture of PMMA and the 
feasibility of predicting long time strength from comparable short time experiments.

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
The higher the crack propagation rate in a sample gets (Li > 10-3 m/s) the more 
the relation between Li and KI - and even the measured value of KIc - depend on 
the parameters of the experiment. As shown in Figure 9.6 Kc increases monotonical-
ly up to a KIc of 1.6 MN/m-3/2 if 00 is kept constant [12, 13]. In other experiments 
(Charpy impact tests, crack initiation and arrest in DCB specimens) K-values at 
higher crack speeds (2 to 300 m/s) are obtained which lie below the Kcc [14, 18].

propagation zone (parabolic pattern); from Doll and Konczal (250)

The different points on the a - KI curve in Figure 9.6 represent quite different 
energy release rates GI. According to Eqs. (9.4) and (9.10) GI increases with the 
square of KI. For the material employed one may use an average elastic modulus E 
of 4.5 GN/m2 and a v of 0.36 thus obtaining GI values of 70 J m-2 at the lower 
range ofKc (0.6 MN m- 3/ 2 ) and 500 J m-2 for a KIc of 1.6 MN m-3/ 2 . These G 
values are equal to the corresponding material resistance R under the given experi-
mental conditions. Their significance and interpretation will be discussed in the fol-
lowing Section.

The slow crack growth behavior of polycarbonate, also a glassy polymer, is even 
more complex than that ofPMMA. At low temperatures (T < -40°C) Kc values be-
tween 2.6 and 3.4 MN m- 3/2 have been obtained [19] from DT specimen which 
were independent of crack speed at small crack speeds (d < 1O-3m/s) but dependent 
on sample thickness and temperature. At higher crack speeds (d ~ 10-1 m/s) Kc 
values slowly increased. Double-side grooved DeB specimen (DG-DCB) however 
showed a decrease of Kc with increasing d in the region of d < 10-1 m/s [20]. This 
behavior was confrrmed by Kambour et al. [21], who observed a Gc of 8.2 kJ/m2 at 
d = 2.5 . 10-5 m/s and of 12 J/m2 at d = 300 m/s. The microphotographical investiga-
tion of the slowly fractured sheets (B = 12.7 mm) revealed the - energy-consuming-
formation of shear lips 0.4 mm wide (mixed mode crack propagation). At high speeds 
no shear lips were found. By copolymerisation of PC with silicone blocks the authors 
[21] were able to increase the fracture toughness in the whole temperature range 
T > -110°C. With this material mixed mode crack propagation occurred fairly 
independently of crack velocity. 
The increase of crosshead speed (over 7 decades) in static three point bending of 
PC resulted [22] only in a slight decrease of the calculated Kc from 3.8 to 3.0 MN 
m- 3/ 2. From the three point bending test a Kcc is derived [14] from:

if P is taken as the largest load measured, ac/aa as the proper change of specimen 
compliance with growth of a (perpendicular) crack, and BN as the thickness of the 
load carrying section. The quantity ac/aa increases with increasing crack length. 
At the beginning of crack growth the values of P and ac/aa (and the corresponding 
Kj ) will be smaller than the Kcc at catastrophic failure. Arad et al. [22] point out 
that Kj and Kcc are the closer together the less material ductility and/or slow crack 
growth are favored by the experimental conditions.

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
In relation to studies of the fracture surface energy as a function of loading rate 
the early and wide application of the tear test (modes III and I) must be mentioned 
(e.g. [5,24-28]). In this fracture mode the material in the crack tip zone is sub-
jected to a complex and highly plastic deformation. Without going into details it 
may be mentioned that rate effects on the extent of plastic deformation (and thus 
on fracture surface or tearing energies) have been found [24-29] and correlated 
with f3- and 'Y-relaxation maxima [5, 24-26]. The tearing energies of thermoplastics 
and rubbers are generally quite large: e.g. up to 1 kJ/m2 for PS, 20-200 kJ/m2 for 
PE, and 0.1-500 kJ/m2 for various butadiene copolymers [24-26]. For highly ori-
ented PE (draw ratio between 10 and 20) the Gc values are between 0.7 and about 
3 kJ/m2 [252]. For elastomers Thomas [27] and Ahagon and Gent [28] report that 
after adjustment for the changing effective fracture area a common threshold frac-
ture energy To of 40 to 80 J/m2 could be determined under different experimental 
conditions. This energy was shown to be independent of temperature and degree of 
swelling for various types of swelling liquid. The threshold energy decreased slightly 
with increasing degree of crosslinking (of the polybutadiene samples). In aggressive 
environment (oxygen, ozone) To is substantially reduced. 
An experimental and theoretical analysis of the steady propagation of a crack in 
a viscoelastic continuum is due to Knauss [29]. Employing a polyurethane elastomer 
(solithane 113) as material Knauss studied crack propagation under pure shear. From 
his extensive analysis, Knauss derives a solution to the viscoelastic-boundary-value 
problem represented by a crack moving in an isotropic, homogeneous, incompressible 
solid. He finds that the stress singularity at the crack tip vanishes. Under these condi-
tions the stress-intensity factor only describes the far-field loading conditions. Knauss 
observes that the rate-dependent fracture energy is essentially the product of an 
"intrinsic fracture energy", presumably of molecular origin, and of a non-dimensional 
function which relates to the rheology of the material surrounding the crack tip. For 
the polyurethane elastomer this intrinsic fracture energy amounted to 2.45 J/m2. As 
criteria for crack stability are concerned, he found that the criterion of ultimate, 
constant strain (crack-opening displacement) is as applicable as a generalized energy 
criterion. 
As stated in the introduction to this section the sub critical crack growth in a 
polymer is due to the thermomechanical activation of different molecular deforma-
tion processes such as chain slip and orientation or void opening. The energy dissipated 
depends on the frequency, nature, kinetics, and interaction of these processes. But 
there are many and notable attempts to treat the subcritical crack propagation as 
one thermally activated multi-step process characterized by one enthalpy or energy 
of activation and one activation volume. Several of these kinetic theories of fracture 
have been treated in Chapters 3 and 8. 
The concept of thermal activation has been extended to the fracture mechanical 
analysis of crack propagation. Thus Pollet and Burns [179] have discussed earlier 
approaches and the significance of various variables. Commonly the energy release 
rate GI is considered as the mechanical intensive parameter. In their treatment, the 
crack front is thus represented by a line on which a force per unit length, Gf, tends 
to move it in the forward direction; its motion is, however, restrained by the presence 
of "thermal" obstacles, Le., obstacles, or barriers, which can be overcome by thermal 
318 

I. Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) 
activation. Whether the physical origins of those energy barriers are individual ob-
stacles placed on a unique surface along the fracture path or whether they are located 
somewhere in the surrounding region, does not affect the generality of the treatment 
if GI can be considered as an intensive variable. 
With the assumption of thermally activated barriers, the average crack velocity 
can be written according to a general Arrhenius-type equation as: 
iJ = Vo exp [-LlG(GI, T)/kT] 
(9.26) 
where the quantity Vo can be thought of as the maximum attainable crack velocity 
and LlG as the free enthalpy of activation to overcome one "obstacle". 
As observed by various investigators [12-15,180] an approximately linear rela-
tion holds between the logarithms of crack velocity and crack extension force: 
(9.27) 
Pollet and Burns find the data for PMMA taken by Atkins et al. [180] at various 
temperatures to comply with Eq. (9.27). They determine from C(T) an area of activa-
tion A * = C(T)/GI of the order of 0.7 . 10-4 to 2 . 10-4 nm2• They interpret this 
small value as indicating that the thermal obstacles are not lined up on a single surface 
along the fracture path but distributed in space in a region of material near the ap-
parent fracture path. 
The question of the uniqueness of the Kl - ti curves has been raised repeatedly 
and for different reasons. Leevers et al. and Stalder et al. [253] point out that no 
unique speed can be assigned to the propagation of all the elements of a curved crack 
front (in double torsion specimens). They show that the crack shape does not vary 
with crack speed whereas the specimen geometry has a strong influence on it. Pavan 
[254] has recently presented a unifying approach, namely the two-dimensional dis-
placement of the crack contour. Dally et al. [255] invoke the three-dimensional state 
of stress and individual errors. 
E. Critical Energy Release Rates 
It has been discussed in the previous Section that an increase in stress intensity fac-
tor or in GI , the driving force for crack extension, promotes sub critical crack growth 
(Figs. 9.5 and 9.6). If GI increases then R will have to increase as well in order to 
establish a new equilibrium. Since R depends most strongly on the plastic energy 
term aVpt/B aa an increase in R can be accomplished in two ways: 
-
through increase of the volume element which deforms plastically during crack 
propagation or 
-
through increase of the rate of plastic deformation. 
As pointed out in the last Section it is generally the latter phenomenon, the 
rate-sensitivity of plastic deformation and of craze formation which assures that an 
increase in GI will initially be accommodated. However, with increasing rate of crack 
319 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
propagation the time Llt available for the plastic deformation decreases. Taking a 
typical plastic zone size of 0.1 mm and a modest crack speed of 1 cmls one arrives 
at a time interval of Llt = sla = 10-2 s. This means that thermal equilibrium will 
most probably not be attained. At higher crack speeds the crack tip region will even 
behave adiabatically. In that case adiabatic cooling due to the elastic expansion of 
the material in front of the crack tip (of the order of 1 to 10K [256]) is being fol-
lowed by adiabatic heating due to the plastic deformation. The ensuing tempera-
ture rise is of the order of several tens or even hundreds of K. Such a temperature 
rise rapidly counterbalances the rate-dependent increase in R; with decreasing mate-
rial resistance, however, the crack accelerates further: the crack becomes unstable. 
The value of ~ where this transition from stable to unstable crack growth occurs is 
termed critical energy release rate Gee [8g]. This transition is especially pronounced 
in glassy thermoplastics; in PMMA the crack speed changes from - 0.1 to more than 
100 mls (cf. Fig. 9.5). 
Thermal effects associated with crack propagation have been studied especial-
ly by Williams et al. [12, 64, 229, 257] and by Doll et al. [30,50,61,66,67,197, 
256]. Weichert and SchOnert have calculated the temperature distribution around a 
moving cir~ular heat source [258]. Using their model Doll [197] estimated tempera-
ture rises in PMMA of 30 to 80 K at crack velocities between 0.06 and 1 mls and of 
230 K at the instability [30]. 
One important consequence of the adiabatic temperature rise is the local mate-
rial softening (or even degradation) and the strong decrease of material resistance 
leading to crack instability. As another consequence, the modification of the stress 
field through the development of thermal stresses has been mentioned in the liter-
ature [259-261]. 
As indicated in Figure 9.5 an unstable crack accelerates rapidly to a level of 
velocities where inertia forces and the finite speed ve of elastic waves have to be con-
sidered [67, 181-182]. So far the contribution of the kinetic energy of the reced-
ing fracture surfaces to R has been neglected. At the point of incipient crack instabil-
ity in PMMA with crack velocities of about 0.1 mls the kinetic energy term amounts 
to 6 J/m3 • At these velocities this term is, therefore, an inSignificant fraction of the 
average strain energy density of 100 to 500 kJ/m3• At velocities of between 100 and 
1000 m s-1 , however, an increasingly larger fraction of the stored elastic energy 
G1(statie) is necessary to account for the kinetic energy of the crack front - reaching 
100% at a crack speed equal to the Rayleigh surface wave velocity VR. The dynamic 
strain energy release rate G d is, therefore, only a fraction F of G1(statie): 
(9.28) 
Broberg'[181] derived the function F(a, ve) for an infinite, isotropic, elastic plate. 
His expression may be approximated by (1 - alvR). 
Recently a special issue of the International Journal of Fracture has been de-
voted to dynamic fracture [262, see also 263-269]. 
Attention should also be drawn to the important phenomenon of crack bifurca-
tion as a means of energy dissipation (see especially the recent work of Theocaris 
[269]).

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
Similar considerations apply to the slowdown and eventual arrest of a rapidly 
propagating crack [18, 182]. An understanding of this phenomenon is of consider-
able importance in the use of high pressure pipes where the propagation of a crack 
over long distances must be prevented under any circumstances. 
The transition from subcritical to rapid crack propagation is especially pronounced 
in PMMA but more or less clearly observed in all polymers capable of brittle fracture. 
The corresponding critical quantities KIc and GIc characterize the fracture behavior 
of a material. In Table 9.2 an (incomplete) listing of measured critical values 
(GIc and K1c) and of energy release rates referring to particular experimental condi-
tions (Gc ' Gd , GIll) are given. The main experimental parameters and their ranges of 
variation have been indicated. 
Of the various terms of Eq. (9.13) contributing to the material resistance the 
plastic deformation, av pdBaa, is generally by far the largest. It has been attempted 
in Table 9.1 to identify also surface tension 'Y and the (hypothetical) energy density 
of chain breakage U/qNL. The smallest term is that of the specific surface energy'Y 
(free surface energy, surface tension). The 'Y values of polymers lie in the range of 
0.020 to 0.046 J/m2 [31]. The energy of elastic retraction is the product of strain 
energy density and width of the retracting layers. If the layers consist of fully 
oriented chains stressed to break and thus having the highest possible energy density 
(of the order of 1000 MJ 1m3 ) the energy of retraction of chain ends of length 
L = 5 nm amounts to 8 J/m2 • 
The chemical surface energy, aVch/Baa = UO/qNL also contributes comparatively 
modestly to R, even if one chain breakage event per molecular cross-section q is con-
sidered: 0.4 J/m2 in PMMA, 2.9 J/m2 in HDPE. The terms Uj and Uch cannot be 
evaluated in all generality. The physico-chemical data used for the above and sub-
sequent calculations are collected in Table 9.1 for seven semicrystalline or glassy 
polymers. 
F. Fracture Criteria 
As fracture criteria derived from LEFM principally have been proposed [229]: 
the critical stress intensity factor Kcc for unstable crack growth and the corre-
sponding energy release rate Gee [8g] 
the crack opening displacement (COD) 
cSt = Kl/EaF 
(plane stress) 
(= Kl{l- v2 )/EaF in plane strain) 
the two-parameter criterion critical stress at critical distance [229,232,395] 
the J contour integral; 
for materials with a pronounced tendency to anelastic deformation and large scale 
yielding the load-deflection curves will be non-linear. In such cases the J contour 
integral proposed by Rice [230] may advantageously replace the energy release rate 
Ge. J has the same physical Significance, namely to describe the flow of energy into 
the crack tip region [229-234], although in tough materials at high stresses only a 
fraction of that energy may be used for the actual crack extension.

At present several different experimental methods of working in the crack opening 
mode are employed [7-151,229]. Flat samples with a single edge notch (SEN) are 
preferentially used under constant load, under slowly increasing strain or under 
cyclic tensile loading (cf. Fig. 9.10). Under these conditions a subcritical crack will 
grow at the root of the notch leading eventually to instability. To determine the 
energy release rate Eq. (9.10) can be used ifthe appropriate long-term relaxation 
modulus E(T, t) is employed. The same is true for plates with a central notch (CN), 
compact tensile (CT) specimens, Charpy notched samples in slow bending, and wedge 
open loaded (WOL) plates at small loading rates. 
The specimen types shown (Fig. 9.10) lend themselves very well to "instrumen-
tation" by the Stalder-graphite gauge. The method has been described in Section 
8 II AI, an example of an instrumented specimen is given in Fig. 8.26. This way 
slow (and rapid) crack growth can be monitored in real time [235]. 
In shock loading the short-time moduli are relevant to describe the energy release 
rate of pre-cracked samples; crack instability is reached primarily because of the in-
creasing stresses and at unchanged crack length. The contribution of thermally acti-
vated crack growth to an increase of KI is, therefore, negligible (the situation is dif-
ferent, though, with uncracked samples and flaws of molecular dimensions as has 
been shown in Chapter 8). 
The WOL and the double-cantilever beam (DC B) specimens are suitable to deter-
mine the arrest of an initially unstable crack; the double-torsion (DT) specimen per-
mits the investigation of crack propagation under constant KI [7-15,23]. 
Values of various types of energy release rates G and of fracture toughness 
values Kc of polymeric materials have been gathered from the literature [12-75, 
236-244] and are compiled in Table 9.2. The experimental method and the princi-
pal parameters and observations have also been indicated. However, the materials 
and parameters studied have become so numerous that a systematic collection of 
all published data had to be abandoned. Only selected values have been incorpo-
rated in Table 9.2 which are thought to be representative for a material and for the 
effect of a particular parameter (molecular weight, temperature, rate ofloading etc.).

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
II. Crazing 
A. Phenomenology 
The phenomenon of crazing has been observed in many glassy polymers, and also in 
some crystalline polymers, when subjected to tensile stress. Conventional polymer 
crazes (Figs. 9.11, 9 .12a, b) in their appearance are similar to very fine cracks known 
for a long time to occur on the surfaces of inorganic materials such as ceramics. How-
ever, there is a difference between the crazes and the cracks in that crazes have a con-
tinuity of material across the craze plane (Figs. 9.13-9.17) whereas cracks do not 
possess any continuity. Consequently crazed zones are capable of bearing loads as 
opposed to cracked cmes. In the last thirty years a growing number of publications 
has been devoted to the phenomenon of crazing. Two comprehensive reviews [76-
77] on this subject have appeared in 1973. 
The bibliography on crazing compiled in the first edition of this monograph 
[78-178] was mostly to be understood as an extension of these earlier reviews. In 
1983 an entire volume of the "Advances in Polymer Science" was devoted to "Craz-
ing in Polymers" [270]. That volume must be considered as the most up-to-date and 
explicit reference on crazing. Thus, the reader will frequently be referred to it for 
more detailed information. Nevertheless, the section on crazing in this monograph 
will be maintained as an introduction and in view of the importance of crazing phe-
nomena in crack propagation, stress whitening and fracture of (glassy) polymers. 
The subject of crazing has been extenSively researched for various reasons: 
in brittle fracture of a crazeable material crazes generally precede cracks so that 
sub critical crack growth is essentially controlled by the formation, propagation 
and breakdown of crazes (see previous sections and refs. [270-338]);

the formation of crazes under stress, and/or in presence of an active environment, 
effects (and generally impairs) mechanical and optical surface properties and 
permeability [350-384]; 
crazes trace and make visible the statistical and geometrical distribution of the 
variables of their initiation (states of strain or stress, molecular properties, struc-
tural defects). 
Since the publication on intrinsic crazing by Dettenmaier and Kausch [271] in 
1980 it is known that crazes exist in two different forms: 
conventional or extrinsic crazes (crazes I) which are preferentially formed at 
sample surfaces and under the influence of defects or stress concentrators 
(scratches, dust particles, finger prints, frozen-in tensions); therefore, in non-
modified polymers, crazes I appear individually; their characteristic morphology 
(Figs. 9.12 to 9.15) is well described in recent publications [270-295]; 
intrinsic crazes (crazes II which are formed after notable stretching in the whole 
sample volume and as a consequence of the breakdown of the entanglement net-
work; intrinsically crazed samples (of PC, PMMA, PS) appear thoroughly whitened; 
they have stress whitened (Figs. 9.12d); as shown by Dettenmaier [272] the mor-
phology of intrinsic crazes is characterized by the large thickness (100 to 200 nm) 
and regularity of their fibrils and by the high volume content of craze matter 
(-75%).

tral section of a craze grown as that in a

II. Crazing 
It remains to be discussed whether the crazes formed at modifier particles (and 
thus in the whole volume of) rubber-toughened glassy polymers are of the first or 
of the second kind. 
Conventional or extrinsic crazes (crazes I) occur most commonly in amorphous, 
glassy polymers such as PS, SAN, PMMA, PVC, PSU, PPO, and PC but also in semi-
crystalline ones (PE, PP, PETP, and POM). Crazes have also been claimed for epoxy 
[131] and phenoxy resins [109]. With reference to the cited literature (e.g. [76-78, 
85,270)) it can be said that conventional crazes are sharply bounded regions filled 
with "craze matter". The craze matter consists of oriented strands interspersed with 
voids and has an average density of 40 to 60% of the matrix density (Figs. 9.13-14). 
Kambour [76, 85] has described the structure of crazes to be similar to an opencel-
led foam in which the average diameter of the holes and polymer elements is about

20 nm. There is much evidence that the polymer elements are oriented primarily 
along the direction of the principal tensile stress. Generally a fairly uniform fibril 
structure exists over the whole length of a tapered craze (Fig. 9.13-14). From the 
uniformity of this structure, one concludes that the increase in the width of the 
craze with sample extension is mostly due to fibrillation of further matrix material 
rather than to an increase in fibril extension. 
The mechanical response of fibrils in the direction of the applied stress has been 
determined for polycarbonate [83] and polystyrene [120]. Figure 9.15 shows a 
stress-strain curve of craze material obtained by Kambour and Kopp [83] for PC. It 
may be noted that the craze material can sustain tensile stresses only slightly less 
than the yield stress GF of the bulk material. The strains, however, are enormously 
greater in the craze - between 40 and 140% as compared to the bulk yield strain of 
about 2%. It follows from this behavior that the energy of deformation of a thorough-
ly crazed sample can attain very large values. 
In recent years an enormous amount of information concerning the morphology 
of crazes and fibrils has been obtained [270-293]. An especially powerful source 
has been the systematic mass thickness contrast analysis of thin fIlms by transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) used by Kramer, Lauterwasser, Donald, Brown et al. at 
Cornell University in Ithaca [275-284]. A comprehensive account of their work is 
given by Kramer in the cited volume on crazing [249]. Michler in Halle (Institute of 
Solid State Physics and Electron Microscopy of the Academy of Sciences) has in-
tensively studied thicker fIlms (up to and exceeding 5 J.Lm) by high voltage electron 
microscopy (HVEM) with an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV [285-287]. In view of 
this considerable progress the original compilation of observations on craze morphol-
ogy, given in Table 9.3, would have to be substantially enlarged. However, in order 
to limit duplication with Kramer's and Michler's articles, only their principle con-
clusions with respect to midrib formation, fibril elongation and stress distribution

fruitful source of information has been the light optical interference method which 
permits the study of craze geometry and deformation in bulk specimens (Fig. 9.18). 
This method has been greatly furthered by Kambour at General Electric and Doll, 
Konczal et al. at the Fraunhofer Institut in Freiburg/Br. A competent review has 
appeared in the above mentioned volume [273]. Again, in order to avoid duplica-
tion, only some principal observations have been included in Table 9.3. A similarly 
restricted reference is given to crazing and shear banding in semi-crystalline poly-
mers in view of the extensive review article by Friedrich [274]. Valuable informa-
tion on craze microstructure has also been obtained by small angle X-ray scattering 
[272,288-291] and small angle electron scattering [276, 292,293].

X-ray scattering and electron microscopy suggests that 
void content of the craze is dispersed in the form of 
inter-connected spheroidal holes having a common 
dimension of10-20 nm. Stress-strain curves of crazes 
have been determined showing a yield stress followed 
by a recoverable flow to roughly 40 to 50% strain at 
41 to 55 MN/m2. Returned to zero-stress, the craze 
exhibits creep recovery at a decelerating rate.

Conclusions 
Crazing is a mechanical separation of polymer chains or 
groups of chains under tensile stress. Crazing does not 
occur in materials oriented along the draw direction. 
Crazes resemble on open-celled foam, the holes and polymer 
elements of these average about 20 nm in diameter. 
Craze-tensile behavior is an extension of the craze growth 
process. Decrease in elastic modulus and yield stress with 
increasing strain are rationalized in terms of strain-induced 
decrease in density and resultant increase in stress concen-
tration factor on the microscopic polymer elements of the 
craze. Polymer surface tension and large internal specific 
surface areas of the craze are suggested to he important 
factors in large creep recovery rates of craze. 
Fibrils of 25-50 nm are a common feature of the micro-
structure of crazes in cast and bulky films. 
Major fibrils diameter = 20-30 nm. 
Minor fibrils connecting major fibrils have a diameter 
> 10 nm and they tend to orient normally to major fibrils. 
At large total deformation at lowe, there is a gradual transi-
tion from coarse to fine microstructure of crazes. 
The large number of parallel crazes formed permitted 
the determination of the stress-strain curve of a craze; 
it is similar to that found by Kambour and Kopp [83) 
for solvent-induced crazes in PC (Fig. 9.12)

Observations 
From electron imaging studies in a transmission electron 
microscope quantitatively fibril density and craze width 
in (thin) film crazes are obtained. Generally a midrib, a 
layer of higher drawn fibrils (and consequently of lower 
craze matter density), is observed in the center of the 
craze; this midrib typically has a width of some 50 to 
80 nm (see Fig. 9.16). 
Higher energy electron microscopy (of thicker films) 
reveals narrow, long pre-craze zones containing "weak 
domains" some 10 to 15 nm in diameter. 
Small angle X-ray scattering patterns of crazes (in PS, 
PMMA, PC) are strongly anisotropic with the equatorial 
scattering curves exhibiting a well pronounced interfibril-
lar interference maximum. 
Interference optical microscopy permits the determina-
tion of the profile (width, length) of crazes in bulk, 
transparen,t (amorphous) polymers (see Fig. 9.18). 
Scanning electron microscopy of crazed and/or fractured 
semi-crystalline materials. 
Conclusions 
The density profiles in the x (craze plane) and y (perpendic-
ular to the craze plane) directions permit the calculation of 
fibril draw ratio A(X, y) and of surface stress profiles S(x). 
Fibril draw ratios and surface stresses show pronounced 
maxima at the craze tip (see Fig. 9.16). 
Molecular heterogeneities are amplified by non-homogeneous 
deformation; the pre-craze zones mostly situated at the sam-
ple surfaces transform into the bulk fibrillar crazes. 
The average fibril diameter D can be evaluated from the posi-
tion of the scattering maximum 
D (PS) - 4 to 10 nm 
D (PMMA) - 20 to 30 nm 
D (PC) - 20 to 60 nm 
D depends strongly on the stress under which fibrillation 
occurs. 
Craze profiles observed in bulk PMMA and PC conform well 
to the Dugdale model; craze stresses and their relaxation has 
been calculated; the influences of temperature, molecular 
weight and load history (fatigue) on craze deformation have 
been evaluated. 
Crazes (in PP, PETP) are showing the fibrillar microstructure; 
at ambient temperature crazes develop along certain morpho-
logical components (interspherulitic boundaries, radially 
oriented lamellae); thus parameters which influence morphol-
ogy (tacticity, cooling rates) influence crazing and/or the oc-
currence of shear banding.

The determination of the craze surface stress profile S(x) from craze displace-
ment profiles (through Fourier transform analysis or dislocation theory), i.e. the 
craze micro mechanics has especially been addressed by Kramer and collaborators 
(reviewed in [249]). Finite-element and boundary-element calculations of the dis-
placement profile for a given surface stress distribution [295] are in adequate agree-
ment with the above approach. 
It should be pointed out that in regions of high stress concentration as for in-
stance at the tip of a crack besides the predominant microfibrillar craze structures 
also other forms of morphology can be observed. These range from homogeneous 
deformation zones (DZ) in solvent cast thin films of some ten different homo- and 
copolymers, such as PS, SAN, PC (Fig. 9.19) and PPO [249] or PS, SAN and PC

center or boundary regions, and to crazeless fracture surfaces in oriented polystyrene 
[155]. 
It has already become clear from the above discussion of craze morphology that 
there are three distinct phases in the life of a craze: its initiation or nucleation, its 
propagation or growth, and its breakdown. The model of a craze ahead of a crack tip 
representing all three phases is shown in Figure 9.20. The molecular mechanisms con-
trolling each phase and the role of chains therein are different. In the following two 
sections an account of observations and criteria will be given. 
B. Initiation of Extrinsic Crazes 
Until about 1980 a considerable amount of research had been conducted on various 
aspects of crazing. However, there had been no exact agreement on the mechanism 
of craze initiation. No theoretical model was available which could predict in all 
generality whether a certain polymer will craze or not under a given set of condi-
tions. And, if it did craze, what effect the temperature and rate of deformation 
would have on craze formation and propagation. This was certainly due to the fact 
that the initiation of a craze depends simultaneously on three groups of variables 
characterizing respectively the macroscopic state o/strain and stress, the nature of 
defect or heterogeneities in the matrix, and the molecular behavior of the polymer 
in the given thermal and chemical environment. In focussing on particular variables 
five conceptually different approaches to describe the initiation of conventional 
crazes emerge. These are based on stress bias, critical strain, fracture mechanics, 
molecular orientation, and molecular mobility respectively. The principal observa-
tions and the craze initiation criteria proposed on the basis of the above concepts 
are listed in Table 9.4. 
These criteria describe different states of local excitation and deformation of 
chain segments. Following 1968, Sternstein et al. [86, 86a, 139] had developed their 
famous stress bias criterion which refers to two mechanisms: cavitation in a dilata-
tional stress field and growth of cavities through a deviatoric stress component. These 
mechanisms have been more explicitely considered in the mathematical model of 
cavity expansion in a rigid plastic by Haward et al. [137] and in the molecular model 
by Argon [152]. 
Before discussing these criteria in more detail, it seems to be useful to present a 
general molecular model of the initiation of extrinsic (conventional) crazes which 
permits to reconcile (most of) the theories and hypotheses proposed so far [167, 
249,270,296,300]. 
. 
An amorphous thermoplastic polymer can be represented by a statistical arrange-
ment of interpenetrating random coils (see Fig. 9.21). The most important geometri-
cal data of such an arrangement are known: the radius of gyration for instance from 
neutron scattering [298] and the entanglement molecular weight Me from visco-
elastic analysis of the plateau modulus [299]. In Figure 9.21 the data on PMMA have 
been taken as an example. Its characteristic features are an Me of 9150 g mol-I, a

Crazes are initiated at the intersection of lines where shear 
bands are formed. Since crazes can be initiated before or 
after shear band formation it is assumed that large hydrostatic 
tensions rather than strains cause the craze initiation. Critical 
hydrostatic tensions:

Stress analysis shows that crazes form in regions of maximum

Conclusion 
Stress concentration at crack tip is sensibly reduced with craze 
initiation and not transferred to craze tip. 
There is a critical stress intensity factor Km below which no 
crazing occurs: 
Km = 0.13 MN m-3/ 2 PMMA 
Km = 0.29 MN m-3/2 PC 
The difference in sorption kinetics is held responsible for the 
higher critical stress intensity factor and the lower exponent 
n in PC, relative to PMMA. 
Craze initiation occurs in regions where chains were oriented 
transversely to direction of stress (birefringence positive) 
The crazing stress increases with amount of orientation when 
the tensile axis is parallel to the draw direction, and decreases 
with amount of orientation when the axis is normal to the 
draw direction. 
At high draw ratios the crazing stress parallel to the draw 
direction is higher than the shear yielding stress and the 
material undergoes a yielding process similar to compression 
yielding. 
Molecular orientation has only a small effect on the orientation 
of the craze plane. 
The effect of molecular orientation on the crazing behavior 
of polystyrene is primarily associated with the nucleation 
stage of the crazing process.

Conclusions 
The time required for the formation of crazes is an inherent, 
but statistical, characteristic of the material itself involving 
a stress depending rate process reflecting to some extent the 
initial microscopic flaw distribution. 
Both yield stress and .:razing stress vary with temperature, 
but crazing stress varies less than the yield stress. This 
indicates that crazing has to provide the nucleation surface 
energy for voids. 
Similar response of crazing and yielding data to temperature 
indicates that in both cases similar molecular conformational 
changes and backbone motions are involved. 
Materials having highest crazing tendency (PMMA, PS, SAN) 
also have high yield stress and thus a large energy associated 
with local plastic instability (which is necessary to account 
for the nucleation and growth of the tiny voids). 
Crazes initiate at surface or interface stress concentrations 
where localized plastic flow produces microcavities by intense 
inhomogeneous plastic shear at a molecular scale. 
The rate of cavity formation depends primarily on the activation 
free energy Ll.G* (cf. Eq. 8.35) and on the local concentrated 
deviatoric stress while the subsequent plastic expansion into 
craze nuclei is in response to global negative pressure.

end-to-end distance of 6.1 nm. The average distance between entanglement points 
is 3 nm. It is important to point out that the end-to-end distance of a typical seg-
ment Me is larger than the average distance between entanglement points. This means 
that on the average the sequences of entanglement points are not connected with 
each other over ten to 15 nm (see Fig. 9.21). If such an arrangement of sequences of 
stiff entangled segments is subjected to tensile forces then there will initially be an 
instantaneous (elastic) and an anelastic displacement of the segments which evident-
ly leads to the storage of elastic energy. This energy can be dispersed by two princi-
pally different modes of deformation: by the local shear displacement of segments 
or by their orientational and conformational reorganization. It is proposed that the 
dominant mechanism in the nucleation of conventional crazes (crazes I) is an (un-
stable) reorientation of segments in stress direction, a reorganization which seems to 
preserve the entanglements previously existing in that direction (Fig. 9.21). The im-
portant question, what happens to the entanglements in lateral direction, will tem-
porarily be postponed. Figure 9.21 permits an evaluation of the contributions of 
rotation and elongation to the orientation of stretched matter. 
The effect of segment rotation in craze nucleation becomes clear from the heavy 
line which has been traced from one entanglement point to the next always follow-
ing that statistical segment which points the closest in stress direction. (In a sequence 
ofloaded and interconnected entanglement points as in Figure 9.21 there must al-
ways be two segments pointing "upwards" and two "downwards".) Each of these 
segments had an average end-to-end distance of Qs = (re 2)1/2. The length of the traced

conceivable that other sequences (for instance those attached in A or B) are not lying in the 
plane of reference. In that case there would be very little lateral constraint to a tensile deforma-
tion of the shown element

line which consists of N such segments is, evidently, N2s; the end-to-end distance of 
this line is N2s cos 8, where 8 is the angle between segment and stress direction. The 
probability to find in an isotropic polymer a segment with direction 8 1 is assumed 
to be equal to sin 8 1 d8 1• According to the model one has always to follow the seg-
ment which is closest to the stress axis, that is element no. 1 if 82 > 8 1 and element 
no. 2 if 82 EO; 8 1. Since 
(9.27) 
one obtains 
(9.28) 
It can be shown that the inverse situation (8 1 ~ ( 2) gives a similar contribution, 
the total average, cos 8, therefore is equal to 0.67. Thus, the simple reorientation of 
segments in a non~oriented polymer would already permit the elongation of a single, 
non-attached sequence of entanglement points by a factor of 1.S.1t must be assumed, 
however, that in addition the molecular segments oflength 25 will uncoil and will 
partly assume their extended length 2e. If all N segments would completely uncoil, 
then the maximum extension of N2e could be attained. This, evidently, corresponds 
to a draw ratio of N2e/0.667 N2s which is equal to 1.5 A e where A e is the natural 
draw ratio of a segment of entanglement molecular weight Me. This value of 1.5 A e 
must be considered as the maximum elongation in the absence of lateral constraints. 
In a real and especially in a bulk polymer, however, these constraints are notable and 
the maximum extension must be expected to be smaller than 1.5 A e. 
Another approach is to consider the zone of width LN (Fig. 9.21) as a three-
dimensional network [249]. The uncoiling of the entangled segments would extend 
their projected lengths in each of the three coordinate directions by a factor of A e: 
According to the Gaussian theory of rubber elasticity (see Chapter SA) one can de-
form such a network by a maximum uniaxial network strain Anet : 
2 
(Anet? + Anet = 3(Aei. 
(9.30) 
If A e is > 2 one has (to better than 1 %) the approximation 
(9.31) 
It has to be expected, therefore, that the combined effect of segment rotation and 
uncoiling while maintaining all entanglements will lead to a local extension of be-
tween 1.5 Ae and 1.73 Ae. 
In their experiments on craze microstructure Kramer et al. [249] determined 
the fibril extension ratio Arib for a large number of homo- and copolymers. They

found for instance for air crazes in PS immediately at the craze tip Xrib values of 7 
to 8 which correspond to 1.71-195 'Ae (see Fig. 9.l6c). In the midrib region-
under slightly decreased stresses - the 'Afib values "dropped" to 5-6 (1.22-1.46 'Ae) 
which is still significantly higher than the natural draw ratio 'Ae = 4.1 ofPS. Outside 
of the midrib region for solvent cast ftlms Kramer found 'A values between 3 and 4 
(Fig. 9 .l6c). For most of the nearly 20 polymers he investigated the fibril extension 
ratios corresponded to or were slightly less than 'Ae [249]. Values smaller than 'Ae are 
often reported in the literature for thicker ftlms e.g. by Kambour [76], Grosskurth 
[176] and Michler [286,287]. The effect of film thickness (and of the absence of 
plastic contraints in film thickness direction) has especially been discussed by Kramer 
et al. [249,278,279]. 
If the volume of the deforming matter is conserved in the craze initiation process 
then the stretching by a factor of 'Anet in stress direction must necessarily be accom-
panied by a lateral contraction of 1/..,fInet in the perpendicular directions. Even in 
thin films such a contraction cannot entirely be accommodated. The few examples 
presented previously (Figs. 9.13-9.14) already show that this will give rise to sample 
discontinuity in the form of voids and fibrils. 
In recent years several papers have been devoted specifically to the question of 
craze initiation [270, 282, 283, 287, 296, 297, 300-312]. The principal observations 
and criteria concerning the formation of conventional crazes have been compiled in 
Table 9.4, they will be discussed subsequently. 
The strain criteria [104, 110, 121,296] specify that no crazing will occur if the 
largest principal strains - even at extended times - remain below a limiting value, 
which was found to be some 2% or less. At short times craze initiation strains €c may, 
in some polymers, be ofthe order of 3 to 5% [104, 113]. In the absence of intensive 
strain concentration strains of this order are insufficient to cause chain scission but 
they tend to decrease the intermolecular attraction (cf. 8 II B). This is recognized 
by Oxborough and Bowden [142] who also use the tensile hydrostatic stress (It> in 
their general critical-strain criterion. In biaxial stress fields the stress bias criterion 
-and theircriterlon differ o.rily-liitle; asOxborough arid Bowden point out Sternstein's 
data and their own can be explained by either one of the two criteria. 
In one of the most comprehensive studies on this subject, Kambour [296] has 
determined in a short-time bending experiment, the initiation strains €c of surface 
crazes of soine 30 different polymers. He has established a linear correlation be-
tween €c and the quantity (CED) t:.T/E, where CED is the cohesive energy density 
[see e.g. 297] and t:.T = Tg - Ttest (Fig. 9.22). 
In view of the close relationship between the tensile yield stress uF and the 
modulus E, Kambour also obtains an excellent correlation between the short-time 
crazing strain €c and (CED) t:.T/UF' 
As it was to be expected, the strain at which crazes are initiated is load- and 
time-dependent; in a (uniaxial) creep experiment at u< UF, crazes are initiated after 
an incubation period and at a strain which is generally smaller than the short-time 
value of €c [103, 104, 324a, 337]. This observation can be explained through a cer-
tain strain-softening of the matrix which permits that critical displacements leading 
to matrix break-up (in much fewer sites) be achieved at smaller stresses. In fact, 
Fischer [11,337] found that crazes (in PC) were initiated whenever the relative com-
pliance d€/du assumed a critical value.

If one would apply one of the above criteria to the craze initiation in a sharply 
notched plate loaded in tension, one would have to expect instantaneous crazing 
since both I at - a2 I and e show a singularity at an infinitely sharp crack tip 
(cf. Eqs. 9.1 to 9.3). Such an expectation would be contrary to the experimental 
findings. Marshall et al. [102] and Narisawa et al. [127] have established that it is the 
initial stress intensity factor Ko which controls craze initiation at the crack tip. In 
the case of PMMA and PC immersed in methanol or kerosene critical values Km exist 
below which no craze initiation and growth occurs. This behavior can be understood 
in view of the discrete sizes of the chain segments and of any voids to be formed, in 
view of the fact that the density of stored elastic energy is limited (Fig. 9.3), and in 
view of plastic deformations eliminating the stress singularity. Marshall et al. [102] 
conclude from their data that crazing occurs when the material at the crack tip 
reaches a critical strain or crack opening displacement. 
The effect of sample structure and morphology on craze initiation has been 
recognized since the earliest investigations [78]. The structure of the sample surface 
is for various reasons especially important: 
- defects and/or contaminations are preferentially found at the surface enhancing 
craze initiation there [173, 176]; 
-
injection molded or machined samples mostly contain a surface strncture which 
differs from that of the bulk material [89, 175, 176]; 
-
molecular chain segments in surfaces have a higher degree of mobility [112]; 
- environmental attack (diffusion, plastification, degradation) begins at the surface 
. and penetrates from there [350-384]. 
The investigations of the effect of chain orientation on craze initiation show that 
a transverse orientation of the chains with respect to the direction of principal stress 
enhances craze initiation [89, 153]. Because there are fewer chain segments pointing 
in the direction of principal stress critical local strains are obtained at smaller stresses 
350 

II. Crazing 
(cf. 3 IV E). On the other hand the craze initiation stress increases with the degree of 
alignment of the chains in the stress direction (increasing degree of orientation, small 
angles 8 between draw direction and principal stress). In the case of good alignment 
craze initiation stresses will be higher than the stress for shear yielding so that no 
crazing is observed. For PS at 20°C yielding in tension occurs in samples drawn to 
A = 2.6 or more and at a 8(A) smaller than 20 to 30° [153]. Particularly noteworthy 
is the observation of Hull and Hoarse (153J that the molecular orientation has only a 
small effect on the orientation of the craze plane. 
This indicates that the transfer of stresses along the axes of the oriented chain 
segments does not determine the direction of craze extension. 
As an effect of sample structure and morphology the enhancement of craze 
initiation through surface flaws (118, 152, 173, 176], impurities [155, 161], and 
heterophase inclusions (reviewed in [114,168, 190, 191 J has also to be mentioned. 
The molecular criteria generally take into consideration molecular weight, chain 
entanglement and the local mobility of chain segments at the given temperature and 
chemical environment [11,15,50,79,146,165-167,173]. The effect of the chemical 
environment will be discussed in Section D. The following investigations generally 
have been conducted in standard atmosphere. An interpretation of craze initiation 
in terms of local strain softening has been given by Rusch and Beck [95J. They pro-
pose that there exists a critical strain for crazing which is dependent on the level of 
frozen free volume initially distributed in the bulk of the material. Through the im-
posed dilatant strain sufficient free volume is added to bring the polymer to a state 
similar to the one reached by it at its Tg. Gent [96J, too, suggests that craze initiation 
results from lowering of the Tg in local high stress fields at surface flaws. However, 
as shown by various authors [89,129,158] surface crazes occur in PS, PMMA, and 
PC at temperatures of -75°C and below. This raises a doubt whether the polymer 
reaches a state characteristic of its T g at such low temperatures or not. 
Lipatov and Fabulyak [112] point to the importance oflow temperature relaxa-
tion processes due to the motions of side chains. These relaxations shift towards 
lower temperatures in samples with high surface to volume ratios. This behavior has 
been interpreted in terms of lower segmental packing on the surface and, therefore, 
easier molecular motions. It is claimed that this facilitates crazing. Shifts of molecu-
lar relaxations towards lower temperature (in PC) have also been observed by Sikka 
[163 J who suggested that this shift may have its origin in the formation of microvoids. 
Studies of molecular weight dependence of crazing and of breaking stresses have 
been carried out by Fellers and Kee [146]. These authors suggest that craze initiation 
stresses are independent of molecular weight when Mn > 2 Me whereas craze devel-
opment and breakdown are clearly molecular weight dependent. This is evident from 
the plot of stresses versus molecular weight, shown in Figure 9.23. Since the measured 
elastic moduli (1.5 GN m-2) did not depend on molecular weight the craze initiation 
strains are also constant (2%). From these results it may be concluded that craze 
initiation is an event which depends primarily on the interaction between chain 
segments. Contrary to the apparent independence of stress and strain at craze initia-
tion to molecular weight the T g of the different PS fractions rises monotonically 
from 88°C at Mn = 70000 to 105°C at Mn = 150000. Another observation made 
by these and other authors is that crazes in high molecular weight samples are very

Fig. 9.23. Breaking stress and crazing stress as a function of molecular weight Mn of polystyrene 
at 25°C (after [146]). Me entanglement molecular weight 
fine, numerous, long, and straight as compared to the ones in lower-molecular weight 
polymers, which are coarser in texture and somewhat shorter in length. This pheno-
menon seems to be related to the homogeneity of the stress field which is the better 
the more numerous and the stronger the fibrils [146, 313]. 
Based on these studies [11, 76, 77,146,249,271-294,296,300,305] and 
anticipating the essential results of the following Sections C and D, a model of craze 
initiation can be presented: 
-
a glassy amorphous polymer is considered as an entangled solid network (Fig. 
9.21); well below Tg , the coiled sub chains between entanglement points (called 
segments) have a very small internal mobility (they are "stiff") and also small 
external mobility (the intermolecular barriers opposing segmental motion are 
especially pronounced in PS and PMMA [305]); 
when strained, local stresses will develop between segments; in view of the seg-
mental stiffness, the inception of incremental flow processes or of "bond-flexing" 
which eventually could lead to shear yielding or flowing is highly restricted; how-
ever, bending stresses can be transmitted by a segment (this seems to be an essen-
tial point in craze initiation); consequently, the local stress distribution will be 
more uneven in a glass than in a more ductile polymer; during the elastic strain-
ing of a glassy matrix (region A in Fig. 9.20), the exact length of the chains (pro-
vided Mw > 2 Me) and the presence or absence of some cross-linking points are 
of minor importance; 
the elastic straining activates two mechanisms: an an elastic dilatational deforma-
tion which is especially furthered by the concentration and triaxial state of the 
stress field (at surface defects or a crack tip) and a (plastic) shear deformation 
which is favored by hydrostatic pressure; the first mechanism is predominant at 
high strain rates and at low temperatures, the latter at longer times and/or at 
higher chain mobilities [324]. 
352 

II. Crazing 
The dilatational deformation in the most highly stressed matrix sites is brought 
about by a lirnited collective reorientation of the (stiff) segments within the sequences 
shown in Figure 9.21; the initially modest dilatational reorganization preserves 
existing entanglements but it "breaks up" secQndary bonds and thus activates the 
matrix material for one of the following steps. In case of a low entanglement concen-
tration (low Mw [313b], blending with low Mw-material [313c, d], prior orientation 
perpendicular to the loading direction [40,155,294)), catastrophic fracture (even 
without crazing) will rapidly occur. In a well entangled network, however, the stretch-
ing in a preferential direction necessitates a contraction of the matrix in lateral direc-
tions, which could more easily occur at the specimen surface, at an interface with soft 
inclusions, or (in the case of very thin or more ductile specimens), by contraction of 
the whole sample; at this stage where no voids have formed as yet, it still remains 
open how the material will respond to a continued straining (e.g. by crazing, forma-
tion of homogeneous deformation zones, or shear yielding); 
with continued straining of a well entangled network, the homogeneous local de-
formation through segments turning into stress direction and/or the accomoda-
tion of the lateral contraction can become increasingly difficult; in such a case 
there are at least three principally different types of material response to be en-
visioned: 
a) break-up of the continuous matrix in the form of pre-craze surface furrows or 
by advance of a craze tip in the form of a "meniscus" (protruding fmgers) 
[166,287,321] or by cavitation (void formation); it remains to be discussed 
whether and how disentanglement and/or chain scission influence this phe-
nomenon [287, 307, 308, 330]; 
b) localized plastic deformation in the form of homogeneous deformation zones 
(DZ, see Fig. 9.19, cf. [280,283,287,306)); 
c) slow-down (and stoppage) of the collective segment reorientation and general 
increase of stress level (which could lead to stress relief through initiation of 
a) or b) in other sites or to other forms of deformation (e.g. shear yielding 
[283,305,318b)). 
Evidently, if homogeneous (dilatational) deformation is followed by matrix 
break-up, the craze is born. 
Craze initiation, therefore, can be defmed as the localized collective dilatational 
reorganization of stiff chain segments accompanied by matrix break-up. The in-
fluence of the most important molecular and experimental parameters on craze 
initiation can be summarized as follows: 
Molecular weight 
IfMn > 2 Me, it has very little influence on the elastic straining behavior and on 
the stress or strain at which crazes are initiated; however, after craze initiation, 
fibrils are formed which are the stronger and which can develop, under increas-
ing stress and time, to greater lengths the higher Mn; consequently, the higher Mn 
the more region C (Fig. 9.20) is extended; thus, the force transmitted by region C 
grows with Mn and so does the stress at break.

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
Concentration of chain ends 
A large concentration of chain ends facilitates craze initiation but reduces craze 
stability. 
Concentration of entanglements or cross-linking points 
A large density of entanglements renders matrix break-up difficult or even impos-
sible, however, it increases the stability of any formed craze; except for kinetic 
aspects, the influence of cross-linking points is analogous. 
Molecular mobility, temperature 
To a certain extent, molecular mobility facilitates craze initiation (smaller Ec). 
However, inception of internal rotation increases the tendency towards yielding. 
No crazes are initiated at T - Tg • 
Pressure and/or Preorientation reduce the propensity for crazing of a glassy polymer. 
Craze initiation in Creep is retarded but occurs at smaller strains. 
Active environments greatly enhance craze formation (see II E). 
C. Intrinsic Crazing and Stress-Whitening 
It has previously been mentioned that the initiation of the ordinary type of crazing 
is generally controlled by foreign particles and surface grooves which both act as 
stress concentrators. Under these conditions, in amorphous single phase polymers a 
small number of extrinsic crazes grow and usually cause the premature rupture of the 
specimen. 
A large number of crazes distributed throughout the sample volume are observed 
in multiphase systems such as rubber-modified polymers where numerous rubber 
particles act as stress concentrators. The intensive light-scattering from the multitude 
of crazes gives rise to the phenomenon of stress-whitening. Stress-whitening is also 
observed for semicrystalline polymers where the transformation of the spherulitic 
into the fibrillar microstructure is often accompanied by intensive void formation. 
Stress-whitening due to intrinsic crazing has been reported in a few cases for 
amorphous Single-phase polymers. For instance, Goldbach and Rehage [82] observed 
intrinsic crazes in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), plasticized at the surface to 
avoid premature fracture by surface crazes. Hull et al. [98, 120], Lainchbury and 
Bevis [162] and Argon and Hannoosh [166] reported on craze yielding of polysty-
rene (PS) by formation of numerous intrinsic crazes. Like extrinsic crazing, this 
phenomenon occurred at small strains of the orderof a few percent. 
Recently, Dettenmaier and Kausch [271,272,300,314,315] have observed an 
intrinsic craze phenomenon in bisphenol-A polycarbonate (PC), drwan to high stress-
es and strains in a temperature region close to the gl~s transition temperature, Tg • 
This type of crazing is not only initiated under extremely well defined conditions 
which reflect specific intrinsic properties of the polymer but also produces numerous 
crazes of a very regular fibrillar structure. These crazes were called crazes II in order 
to distinguish them from the extrinsic type of craze, called craze I. 
354 

II. Crazing 
Figure 9.24 shows a nominal stress-strain curve of PC measured at T = 129°C. 
Extrinsic crazes (crazes I) are initiated at an early stage of deformation, well below 
the yield point. They start growing from surface defects, in particular, if the sample 
has come into contact with some crazing agent. Crazes I are shown in the optical 
(Fig. 9 .l2b) and scanning-electron micrographs (Fig. 9.25). These crazes are largely 
separated from each other and it is clearly visible that they are situated at the surface 
of the specimen (Fig. 9.25). At high stresses and strains, well above the yield point, 
numerous crazes (crazes II) are initiated throughout the sample volume. Their 
initiation is preceded by some strain hardening of the material and is followed by a 
strain softening mode leading to the second peak in the stress-strain curve of Figure 
9.24. The specific volume of PC increases notably when crazes II are initiated, result-
ing in a loss in density of approximately 8% at the rupture of the specimen (Fig. 
9.24). The large number of crazes II giving rise to the phenomenon of stress-whiten-
ing and to the observed loss in density is shown by the optical and scanning electron 
micrographs in Figures 9.12c and d and 9.26, respectively. In Figure 9.12c, crazes I 
and II can clearly be seen together, the large and isolated crazes I are easily distin-
guished from the dense pattern of very frne craues II. 
Dettenmaier and Kausch [272, 315] have derived strong evidence that the ini-
tiation of intrinsic crazes is governed by a temperature and stress activated instability 
of the entanglement network frozen-in during the glass transition. The effect of pre-
orientation on intrinsic craze initiation gave considerable support to this model. In 
fact, intrinsic craze initiation intimately reflects the modification of the entangle-
ment network induced by pre-stretching above T g' In principle, the instability of the 
entanglement network observed in PC may arise from the activation of several 
mechanisms such as chain slippage, disintegration of entanglement points or chain 
rupture. However, GPC-measurements of crazed samples did not reveal anyappreci-
able amount of chain rupture [316]. 
Dettenmaier [272] has analyzed in detail the microstructure of intrinsic crazes 
by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The fibrillar microstructure detailed analysis

crazes is considerably different. Depending on strain rate, drawing temperature and 
pre-orientation the average fibril diameters cover a range of 100-200 nm (see Fig. 
9.27). As for extrinsic crazes [288] the product ofthe average fibril diameter and the 
stress at craze initiation is found to be independent of the strain rate and the drawing 
temperature. The volume fraction of craze fibrils is approximately constant and 
amounts to Vr ~ 0.75-0.80 as compared to V} ~ 0.5 for crazes I. The fact that

There is some evidence that the intrinsic crazing of PC is related to the existence 
of a general mode of cavitational plasticity in highly extended polymers. PMMA and 
PS are further examples of polymers in which cavitation and stress-whitening occur 
at hlgh stresses and strains [272f Intrinsic crazing or related phenomena have also 
been observed in crystalline polymers. For example, Friedrich [274] reported on 
intrinsic craze formation in highly deformed polypropylene. There is also some 
evidence that instability phenomena which occur under certain drawing conditions 
in several polymers such as PETP, PE, PP and PA may have the same origin. In 
tensile tests these instabilities result in stress oscillations associated with the forma-
tion of stress-whitened zones of a fibrillar and voided microstructure [317]. 
D. Molecular Interpretation of Craze Propagation und Breakdown 
The foregoing discussion on the phenomenology of craze initiation has also given a 
molecular interpretation of the propagation of an individual craze. Taking into con-
sideration the formation of many crazes either simultaneously, or in sequence, a par-
ticular craze grows 
in length through the displacement of the craze tip into uncrazed, "activated" 
material ahead of the craze tip by breaking up the so far contiguous matrix [166, 
249,287,301,321,326]; 
-
laterally by an increase in fibril length through the transformation of matrix ma-
terial into (highly) drawn matter in what may be called a micro-yielding process. 
Seen from the craze tip, the craze preserves its shape during growth. 
357 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
There are three aspects of craze propagation which will be discussed at this 
point: the kinetics of craze growth, the stress at the craze-matrix interface (region C 
in Fig. 9.20), and the craze breakdown. 
The rate of longitudinal craze growth has been studied by a number of authors. 
The many problems still existing with regard to the transition of matrix material 
into craze matter and with the rheological properties of the latter are found to be of 
double weight in any quantitative description of craze propagation. For this reason 
no detailed description of the various approaches will be given here - but the basic 
concepts should be mentioned. The fracture mechanical investigations on PMMA 
[15,50,102,127,133] and PC [127, 144] have led to empirical expressions for 
d(a + rp)/dt, the rate of craze growth, in terms of stress intensity factors. Kambour 
[76] and Marshall et al. [102, 133] stress the importance of environmentalf/ow 
through the porous craze material. Verheulpen-Heymans [156] formulates a model 
for craze growth based on stress and strain analysis around a craze and on the rheo-
logical properties of the craze matter. In those cases where the craze length was 
found proportional to the crack length [15, 144, 177] the empirical law for crack 
growth (e.g. Eq. 9.22) also describes craze growth. 
Using holographic interferometry Peterson et al. [148] determined the distribu-
tion of the incremental stresses caused by a strain increment applied to a craze in PC. 
At low prestrains (1.3-1.7%) they observed that the craze material near the tip of 
the craze actually supporte'!..!.. stress increment AUy well in excess of the average 
stress increment AUy(Auy/Auy equal to 1.2 to 1.45). The peaks in the stressincre-
ments occurred at a distance of 0.2 to 0.4 of the craze length behind the craze tip. 
In their photoelastic studies of PMMA and PC crack tips Narisawa et al. [127] noted 
high stress concentrations just before the initiation of a craze and very modest stresses 
60 min later. No noticeable new stress concentration appeared at the craze tip. 
In recent years, the craze micro-mechanics has been tremendously developed, 
giving detailed information on craze shape and craze stress profile (see Section IIA 
and refs. [249,278.-295,323,324]). Notwithstanding some differences in the model-
lisation of the craze-matrix interface [329, 331] the shape of these interfaces con-
formed well to the predicted shape according to the Dugdale-Muskelishvili plastic 
zone model [7]. In that model it is assumed that a normal stress equal to the matrix 
yield stress uF is acting on the interfaces. This stress uF is derived from Eqs. (9.18) 
and (9.20) as 1TEva/4rp. Using the approximately molecular-weight independent ratio 
of rp/2va -:::::: 27 as given by Weidmann and Doll [15] for PMMA and using an E of 
4.5 GN m-2 one arrives at an UF of 65 MN m-2. This value corresponds to the 
strength of the isotropic PMMA (Table 1.1). Fraser and Ward [177] obtained in the 
same wayan interfacial stress of 58 MN m-2 (at 22 0c) and 130 MN m-2 (at 
-130 0c) for PC. 
Another method, Knight's analysis of stress distribution along a craze, has been 
used in a number of investigations (cf. [76, 77]). Verheulpen-Heymans [157] quite 
recently pointed out, however, that the - mostly unknown - rheological behavior 
of craze material and of the craze tip zone has such a strong effect on the calculated 
stress field that at the present time the results of this method cannot be interpreted 
unambigously. 
358 

II. Crazing 
In a growing craze molecular strands are formed (at B in Fig. 9.20) and extended 
(zone C in Fig. 9.20). The growth of a craze is slowed down or even halted 
-
if the craze hits upon an obstacle which prevents further fibrillation of matrix 
material (e.g. a heterophase inclusion; a zone of higher orientation, larger flexibil-
ity or lower stresses; the end of the specimen) [349]; 
if the craze has grown to such an extent that the initiating crack or flaw is blunted 
and rendered uncritical [318b, 321, 329]; 
if the craze interacts with other crazes or with the environment in such a way as 
to change the conditions which have led to its initiation and/or growth (stress 
relaxation of the sample because of craze-related creep deformation, penetration 
into a)ower-stress zone adjacent to another craze) [319,324, 327a, 338]. 
On the other hand craze growth will continue or be resumed if the molecular 
strands fail (transition from craze to crack, zone D in Fig. 9.20). It becomes imme-
diately clear from Figure 9.20 and Eq. (9.18) that the energy dissipated in the open-
ing up of a craze is the higher the longer and wider the craze (zone C) that is the 
more resistant the molecular strands and the higher UF' As already indicated earlier, 
the breakdown of the molecular strands will occur through: 
chain scission (rapid loading of well entangled networks at "low" temperature, 
cross-linked networks) 
chain slip (shorter chains and/or higher temperatures) 
chain disentanglement (long-time and/or fatigue loading). 
These mechanisms have been clearly confirmed [283,284,308,313, 318a, 330, 
335]. 
The presence of an active environment evidently favors the latter two mecha-
nisms (see later). 
Apart from electron microscopical observations, the phenomenon of the load-
ing and breakdown of molecular strands had also been studied by thermal measure-
ments [31,50, 184-186], from analysis of the influence of molecular weight on 
crazing [11, 15, 65, 79, 146, 178], through acoustic emission [174, 188], and by 
the ESR technique [189-190] respectively. 
Doll [31, 50] determined the amount of heat Q dissipated in PMMA at the tip 
of a rapidly propagating crack. To derive Q they measured the temperature rise 
LlT, (t) at a thermocouple placed on the specimen surface close to the prospective 
fracture plane. Considering geometry, thermal conductivity, and crack speed a they 
calculated the heat Q dissipated per unit are of crack surface. As expected Q increased 
with Ii and Mw (from 0.15 to about 5 kJ/m2 ) and it was found proportional to the 
dynamic energy release rate Gd . Extrapolating Q(Gd ) down to G1c (at a = 140 m s-') 
they observed that the dissipated heat Q (Ii = 140 m s-') = Qo accounted for only 
57% of the released mechanical energy G1c ' They ascribe this difference to the fact 
that the highly stressed molecular strands conserve an amount of energy of the order 
of 0.43 G1c , that this energy is released at the moment of fibril rupture and that it is 
dissipated over wide distances in the fo.rm of small shock waves which escape measure-
ment by the employed difference technique [30]. The acoustic emission analysis 
(AEA) of a crazing PMMA sample by Roeder [188] permits similar conclusions. The 
formation of crazes (transition A""* C in Fig. 9.14) did not give rise to any discernible 
acoustic signal. Whereas the transition from a craze to a crack (C ""* D) could be traced 
359 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
by ABA even at an earlier stage than by optical microscopy. In PS, however, craze 
formation is accompanied by sharp cracking sounds at strains of 0.6% or less [78]. 
The thermal measurements are not only interesting in view of the energy balance 
of the crazing process but also because they permit the calculation of the local tem-
perature rise A To caused by the opening up and breakdown of the craze in PMMA. Doll 
[30] assumed that Qo was initially confined to the zone of crazed material. Using a density 
of 0.6 g cm-3, a specific heat of 1.46 J g-1 K-1, a craze layer thickness 2 v of 
1.65 J1IO, and a Qo of 335 J m -2 he arrives at a AT 0 = 230 K. This value is in accord 
with theoretical estimates of Weichert and Schonert [185] and with infrared measure-
ments of Fuller et al. [184] on PMMA. The latter determined within a range of ti of 
200 to 640 m S-1 a constant AT of 500 K. The simultaneously observed increase 
in Q(ti) implied that the plastic deformation at the crack tip became more extensive 
at higher crack speeds. Preliminary experiments on PS showed a AT of 400 K and 
smaller heat values [184]. These temperatures are certainly large although not com-
pletely umeasonable. They indicate that not only melting but thermal degrada-
tion must occur under these conditions. And they are in proportion with the much 
higher temperature rises - of several thousand K - which were deduced by Weichert 
[186] from the spectroscopical analysis of light emitted during fracture of glass. 
It was noted at an early stage that sample molecular weight is an important 
variable in craze propagation and breakdown. Rudd [79] studied the stress relaxation 
ofPS fllms in contact with the crazing environment butanol. A plot of u(t)/u(O) 
versus logarithm of time revealed that the time to reach the 40% stress level was three 
orders of magnitude larger for the higher molecular weight samples. The final decay 
from 0.4 u(O) to zero stress occurred rather rapidly for all molecular weights [79]. 
The observation of Fellers and Kee [146] that the breaking stress ofPS only 
gradually increases once Mn > 2 Me has already been mentioned in the previous 
section (Fig. 9.23). Their results conform quite well to those of Doll and Weidmann 
[15,50]. These authors determined the shape of a craze, the released heat Q and the 
material resistance R for a series of PMMA samples having well defined molecular 
weights Mw between 1.1 . 105 and 8 . 106 • Measuring the crack opening 2 v, the 
craze width 2 ve , and the craze length rp at a crack speed of 10-8 m S-1 they noted 
that these parameters of the craze shape increased with Mw up to an Mw of about 
2· 105 • At higher Mw hardly any changes of 2 v and rp and very small increases of 
craze width were observed [15, 329]. This means that initially (Mw < 1.6 . 105 ) craze 
widths increase with chain lengths. At molecular weights comparable to Me the inter-
penetration and entanglement of the molecular coils hardly allows the formation of 
fibrils [11,146, 187]. At higher molecular weights (up to Mw = 2 . 105) the coils are 
larger in size and the absolute number of entanglements per coil increases; the fibrils 
become stronger and more resistant to failure by slippage or disentanglement [282, 
283,308,313,330]. At even higher molecular weights (Mw > 2· 105) and under 
constant load the fibril strength seems to be more determined by the strength than 
by the flow behavior of the molecules. Under oscillating loads disentanglement may 
even occur at such molecular weight levels. Recent experiments of Skibo, Hertzberg, 
and Manson [191] strongly support the contention that the breakdown of molecular 
strands as a consequence of their disentanglement triggers the stepwise growth of 
fatigue cracks. This phenomenon will be discussed in more detail in Section 9 III D. 
360 

II. Crazing 
The critical energy release rates G1c show a behavior similar to that of the craze 
shape. For small Mw the G1c are strongly dependent on Mw' Thus they increase from 
1.4 J m-2 at Mw = 2· 104 to 110 J m-2 at Mw = 12 to 15 . 104 [65]. At higher 
molecular weights - up to 8 . 106 - only a gradual increase of G1c to values of be-
tween 160 and 600 J m-2 is observed [30, 65]. This corresponds to what has been 
said above on the effect of molecular weight on fibril length and strength. 
The occurrence of chain rupture in craze breakdown has been inferred from the 
above thermal, mechanical and acoustical evidence. Its direct observation by ESR 
technique is difficult because of the limited number of crazes which can simulta-
neously be carried to breakdown. The number of chain breakages generally corre-
sponds to that of a single fracture plane. No quantitative data on free radicals formed 
in crazing have been reported. DeVries et al. [189] have observed a very weak ESR 
signal in a crazed and cut PMMA fiber. Nielsen et al. [190] did not find any evidence 
of free radicals in thoroughly crazed - but unbroken - samples of PS and ABS. Popli 
et al. [335] also do not find an ESR signal in crazed PS, they detect, however, a 20% 
molecular weight decrease using GPC. 
The above considerations mostly dealt with an individual craze, with the condi-
tions of its initiation, propagation and breakdown in a brittle polymer. Generally a 
larger number of crazes is formed in a stressed specimen (cf. Fig. 9.12). If those 
crazes are sufficiently distant from each other then they will grow freely. Opfermann 
[175, 327a] found that in PMMA a lateral distance between crazes of 80 11m assured 
their unimpeded longitudinal growth. The macroscopic mechanical properties (strain 
at break, strength at short or long times, energy to break) depend to some extent on 
the number of crazes per (surface) area, but they are still comparable to those of a 
brittle solid with a strain at break of some 4 to 5% and a low fracture energy. In or-
der to sensibly increase the macroscopic creep compliance and the energy to break, 
crazes must be initiated in large numbers throughout the sample volume and they 
must be prevented from premature breakdown. Both objectives have been achieved 
with heterophase copolymers or blends. 
The obvious technological importance of the toughening of brittle polymers 
through controlled crazing is reflected by the considerable amount of work done in 
this area. In recent monographs [92, 339,340] a comprehensive elaboration of the 
physical, chemical, and technological aspects of polymer mixtures, rubber-toughened 
plastics, block copolymers, grafted copolymers, interpenetrating networks, and 
polymer blends has been given. The reader is referred to these monographs for any 
detailed information on these systems, on their characteristic behavior and on the 
specific materials science problems they pose. The fact that several international 
meetings are annually devoted to the synthesis, compatibility, and mechanical prop-
erties of copolymers and blends [193, 341] testifies to the importance of this class 
of polymer materials and to the number of open problems which cannot even be 
touched upon in the context of this book. The few references given focus on indi-
vidual morphological aspects of the crazing of heterogeneous glassy polymers [94, 
97,143,152,168,342-349]. The observation that rubber-toughened polymers are 
capable to withstand substantial (shock) loads without traceable damage (that is 
without craze-initiation) points to the importance of the phase of homogeneous 
361 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
tensile dilatation which preceeds matrix break-up. If crazes are initiated they im-
part plastic behavior to the (stress-whitening) samples [342-349]_ 
Valuable information on the role of crazing in breakdown of a polymer is ob-
tained, of course, from fractography. Relevant investigations [30, 49, 61, 66, 132, 
150, 155, 169, 194-204] on this subject will be discussed in Section III A. 
E. Response to Environment 
In the previous sections on crazing primarily mechanical and molecular parameters 
have been discussed while the chemical environment was not considered as a variable. 
At this point an overview over the physico-chemical response of a crazable material 
to an active chemical environment will be given. (The chemical response to an active 
physical environment such as photo degradation or ozonolysis has been treated or 
referenced in 8 III). 
The physico-chemical actions of a (gaseous or liquid) chemical agent on a 
polymer involve adsorption and absorption of the agent, the swelling and/or plasti-
cization of the matrix, the reduction of surface energies, and/or chemical reactions 
such as the hydrolytic depolymerization. These aspects of environmental stress 
cracking (ESC) have been treated in numerous original articles [119-162, 352-381] 
and some reviews (e.g. [76-77, 80,123, 171,275,350,351,382-384]). From the 
extremely large body of experimental observations only a few can be discussed in 
the following. 
The physico-chemical actions of a liquid environment may influence the initia-
tion, propagation, or breakdown of a craze in a thermoplastic polymer. There seems 
to be agreement that a liqUid must be able to diffuse into a polymer in order to in-
fluence craze initiation. Narisawa [119] determined the critical stresses (1j for craze 
initiation in thin films of PS and PC in contact with various alcohols and hydro-
crabons. He observed that crazes appear without significant delay and that (1j 
decreases with decreasing chain length of the solvent (from 45 to 20 MN m - 2 for 
PS, from 70 to 50 MN m-2 for PC). From these results he concludes that a slight 
swelling of a microscopic surface area is necessary and sufficient to effect craze 
initiation. He derived a criterion for (1j in the form of Eq. (8.29) with activation 
volumes of the order of 1.0 to .13 nm3 , activation energies of 109 to 130 kJ/mol, 
and rate constants of 1 to 10 . 10-38 s-1 (PS) and 2 to 50 . 10-45 S-1 (PC). 
The solvent crazing in terms of polymer and liquid solubility parameters has been 
studied in detail by Andrews et al. [124,126] and Kambour et al. [125, 128]. Kambour 
employed a wide range of swelling liquids with solubility parameters 8s between 
5.34 and 19.2 call/ 2 cm -~/2. He determined the equilibrium solubility Sy, expressed 
as volume of liquid absorbed per unit volume of polymer, for PS, PPO, and PSU. 
The swelling of PPO across the whole spectrum of organic liquids was found to be 
inversely correlated by 18s -8 ppo 1 and, consequently, the craze resistance was 
correlated by 18s -8 pPO I. In PS and PSU craze resistance was less well correlated by 
the solubility parameters. With all three polymers, however, the equilibrium solubility 
Sy gave a good measure of the polymer-solvent interaction. Using Sv as independent

variable, unique plots of T g and of craze initiation strain ej were obtained for two 
sets of polystyrene data. One set was obtained from samples preplasticized to various 
degrees by o-dichlorobenzene; the other from "dry" samples in contact with the 
swelling agent (ej) or swollen fIlms (Tg). Kambour concludes from these results that 
the presence or absence of a liquid/polymer interface is immaterial to the crazing 
effectiveness of a given crazing agent. 
The crazing agent thus acts through its presence within the polymer matrix. In 
increasing the chain mobility (lowering T g) it facilitates the primary and secondary 
steps of craze initiation: nucleation and stabilization of a craze. This leads to the 
lowering of Uj and ej in brittle polymers such as PS. Easier nucleation and stabilizatior 
even cause the appearance of crazes in otherwise ductile materials such as PPO, PSU, 
PVC,orPC. 
Andrews et al. [124,126] also studied the equilibrium swelling, ofPMMA, 
in various alcohols and related it to the observed changes in yield stress, UF ,glass 
transition temperature, Tg , and material resistance R. They report the interesting 
phenomenon that R above a certain critical temperature T e became independent of 
temperature. Within experimental error T e corresponded to the T g of the PMMA 
under the particular conditions of swelling. They propose a relation for R involving 
the surface energy of the nucleated cavities and of. They then interpret the constanc} 
of R{T > Te) with the vanishing of uF{T > Te). The absolute values of R{T > Te) 
are rather small: about 0.1 J m-2 for PMMA in isobutanol, carbon tetrachloride, 
n-propyl and isopropyl alcohols, 0.3 J m-2 for ethanol, 0.45 J m-2 for methanol 
[124 ]. 
The swelling, crazing, and cracking behavior ofPMMA, PVC, and PSU in contact 
with some 70 different liquids was analyzed by Vincent and Raha [123]. They con-
sidered not only the solubility parameter Os but also the value of the hydrogen 
bonding parameter HOD based on the displacement of the OD infra-red absorption 
band in CH30D in presence of the particular liquid and benzene. Better (but still 
no unique), correlation between the mode of failure and Os and HOD was obtained; 
An extensive investigation of the role of metal salts in stress cracking of various 
polyamides was carried out by Dunn and Sansom [90-93]. Metal halides permitted 
to distinguish two types of action: the formation of complexes between the metal 
and the carbonyl oxygen and interference with the hydrogen bonding (found for the 
chlorides of Zn, Co, Cu, Mn) or with solvent cracking, as with Li CI, Ca C12 , Mg C12 , 
or Li Br [90-91]. The action of metal thiocyanates on polyamide 6 was similar to 
that of the corresponding metal halides [92]. Of various nitrates Cu{N03h had the 
strongest effect on the stress cracking ofPA6 fllms [93]. 
In the investigations of Marshall and Williams et al. [52, 102, 133, 151, 164] 
Narisawa et al. [127], Kitagawa et al. [144], and Krenz et al. [159-160] craze growth 
and creep were related to fracture mechanical quantities. Graham et al. [164] model 
crazes in PMMA as a line plastic zone subjected to a craze stress Uer. In the presence 
of active liquids uer is reduced from its air value of 100 MN m-2 to e.g. 7 (methanol), 
5 (ethanol and propanol) or 10 MN m-2 (butanol). A clear linear correlation be-
tween Km and Uer was found to exist. For the craze size at initiation (Le. just before 
the beginning of crack growth) the authors found a unique value of 11.5 lIm [164].

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
Similar studies of solvent crazes in polystyrene were carried out by holographic in-
terferometry by Krenz et al. [159-160]. 
These and later investigations [e.g. 367-370, 381], have confirmed the fracture 
mechanics approach of environmental crack propagation proposed especially by 
Williams et al. [102, 133, 151]. In terms of the applied stress intensity factor Kc and 
of the rate iz of craze and crack propagation, three zones of behavior are identified: 
-
if iz is small, the craze tip is always in perfect contact with the environmental 
agent and Kc(iz) is influenced by the described mechanisms of matrix and fibril 
plasticization (low-R regime); 
-
if iz becomes comparable to the speed of capillary flow of the agent through the 
craze material, then iz may largely be controlled by the latter (leading to a strong 
viscosity effect of ESC in this "transition regime"); 
-
if iz is large, the crack-tip "escapes" contact with the stress cracking agent and 
Kc(iz) may not at all depend on its presence (high-R regime). 
A similar three-stage behavior is found in static environmental loading (of LDPE) 
[367-370]: 
-
if Kc is slightly smaller than Kce, the times-to-failure tb in air and in an ESC agent 
are identical (incubation period); 
-
if Kc is clearly smaller than Kce a strong dependence of tb on Kc and on the ESC 
agent is observed; the failure mode changes from brittle to serni-ductile; 
-
at small Ke, tb approaches infmity, failure is brittle again and seems to be caused 
by ESC-assisted chain disentanglement [369,384]. 
Studies of the rnicromechanics of deformation in semicrystalline polyethylene 
in environmental stress cracking agents [107, 154, 170, 171,204] have elucidated 
the role of spherulites and of the mosaic block structure and its disintegration into 
independent nonuniform fibrils. The morphology of crazes in amorphous PVC in 
liquid and vapor environment was examined by Driesen [122] and Martin et al. [198]. 
It has not always been recognized that liquid gases such as N2 and Ar are also 
acting as environmentally active agents. Parrish and Brown et al. [116, 129] have 
been the first to report that the fracture stresses of PE and PTFE immersed in helium 
at 78 K are respectively 21 and 33% larger than those obtained in liquid N2 • Later 
studies of Brown et al. [134, 157-158], Peterlin et al. [135, 137-138, 145] and 
Kastelic and Baer [140] concern N2 , Ar, O2 , CO2 , and He and a variety of materials 
(PP, PTFE, PETP, PC, PMMA). It is the common consensus that 
-
N2 and Ar exert an environmental effect on the tensile stress-strain curves of all 
polymers at low temperatures 
-
the environmental effect is the larger the closer a gas is to its condensation point 
and the greater its thermodynamic activity [145] 
-
N2 , Ar, O2 , and CO2 usually cause craze yielding whereas in He or in vacuo the 
polymers undergo brittle fracture without crazing [352-355] 
-
the gases have to act at or close to a free surface 
-
as crazing mechanisms gas absorption and matrix plasticization are proposed as 
well as gas adsorption and surface energy reduction which facilitates cavity forma-
tion. 
The above mentioned aspects of interaction between a stressed polymer and an 
active environment have, in recent years, continued to be the object of strong inter-
364

est [350-384]. Thus, the effects on craze behavior of changing surface tension [356], 
of craze fibril plasticization [357], and of different molecular, structural, and envi-
ronmental parameters have been investigated for e.g. PS [356-358], PVC [324c], 
PMMA [359-363], LDPE [364-370], HDPE [371-377], and PC [378-380]. 
The important influence of viscosity and capillary force on the Kc(a) relation-
ship in ABS has been analyzed by Kambour and Vee [381]. They found that the 
average linear flow rate of an ESC agent in an ABS craze was proportional to the 
ratio of liquid surface tension to viscosity. The literature up to 1982 on the mechan-
ical behavior in gaseous environments [382] and on the thermodynamics [383] and 
phenomenology [384] of environmental stress cracking (ESC) has been covered and 
discussed recently. 
From the discussion in this section a number of craze suppression mechanisms 
have become apparent which may be summarized here: 
-
imposition of hydrostatic pressure in addition to tensile stresses [86,139,142] 
-
introduction of compressive stresses into the surface [77, 174, 176] 
-
orientation of molecules in the surface layer [89,153] 
-
plasticization, preferentially of the surface [82, 162, 178] 
coating of the surface by an oligomer of the sample material, e.g. coating of PS 
by a 600 molecular weight polystyrene oligomer [178] polishing of the surface 
[173, 178] 
increase of sample molecular weight. 
III. Molecular and Morphological Aspects in Crack Propagation 
A. Fracture Surfaces and Molecular Mechanisms 
1. Thermosetting Resins 
The term thermosetting resins covers a wide range of crosslinked polymers. Amongst 
these the fracture properties of epoxide resins [385-389] and unsaturated polyesters 
[386,390,391] have been most extensively studied although some work has been 
devoted to polyurethanes [392], phenol-formaldehyde [393] and polyimides [235]. 
Direct comparison of the work carried out in different laboratories is often compli-
cated by the wide choice of resin and hardener chemistry, curing procedures and 
even batch-to-batch variability. As a result characteristic behavior is only found with-
in quite broad limits. 
Thermosetting resins have been traditionally considered to be extremely brittle 
materials it being assumed that the crosslinked state precludes extensive viscous flow. 
Indeed in uniaxial tensile tests well below the glass transition temperature the stress-
strain diagrams are essentially linear to rupture with deformations at break of some 2 
365 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
to 5%. However, it is now realised that even these highly crosslinked materials are 
capable of considerable plastic deformation which is highly localised at the crack tip. 
In fracture mechanics testing using stable specimen geometries where the compliance 
is linear with the crack length (for example double torsion, tapered double cantilever 
beam) crack propagation in thermosetting resins may be characterised by either of 
the load-displacement diagrams shown in Figure 9.28. For resins with high yield 
stresses (> 100 MPa) crack tip plasticity is limited and stable propagation is observed. 
However, for resins with lower yield stresses, material at the crack tip may plastically 
flow blunting the crack sufficiently to cause arrest. The sample must then be re-
loaded to reinitiate a sharp crack. The load-displacement diagrams have the distinc-
tive saw tooth appearance shown in Fig. 9.28 and values of Kc appropriate to crack 
initiation (Kct) and crack arrest (Kca) may be determined. Since this flow is time 
dependent, values of Kci vary considerably with testing rate and at higher cross head 
speeds propagation may become continuous and stable [394]. The magnitude ofKci 
has been shown to be dependent on the radius ofthe blunted crack [395]. 
. 
These modes of crack propagation have obvious repercussions on the fracture 
surface morphology. When crack propagation is stable and continuous, fracture 
surfaces are smooth and relatively featureless as shown in the extreme left of Figure 
9.29. In this micrograph a typical arrest line may be observed followed by a region 
of closely spaced striations parallel to the direction of crack growth. These striations 
are characteristic of slow propagation after crack arrest and have been observed in 
epoxide resins [385], polyirnides [235] and phenol-formaldehyde resins [396]. 
Lee [397] has suggested that these structures result from the superposition of 
reflected elastic stress waves which create local compressive stresses causing crack 
branching. Another explanation has been given by Atsuta and Turner [396] who 
have used an approach developed to explain similar effects in silica glasses [398]. In 
a perfectly elastic system a crack will propagate in a plane perpendicular to the local 
tensile stress. If the crack moves into a region where the principal stress is oriented 
at a slightly different angle the crack cannot adapt instantaneously and instead may 
divide into several segments. Indeed Melin [399] has shown theoretically that two 
cracks in a fragile material cannot meet due to the stress state in their proximity. 
They start by avoiding each other and then joint forming a lip which is partially 
attached to each fracture surface. The ultimate separation of the two surfaces de-

Fig. 9.29. Stable crack propagation (extreme left) crack arrest line and subsequent striated region 
forms and finally ruptures the fibres. This latter phenomenon has been observed 
directly during in situ fracture tests in the scanning electron microscope [400]. 
A further explanation has been postulated more recently for the existence of these 
striations that is based on the theory of meniscus instability [40 I]. 
This theory is founded on the observation of a meniscus between two fluids of dif-
fering density. Under certain conditions the originally smooth meniscus may break 
up into a series of fingers [402,403]. Craze formation in thermoplastics has been ex-
plained on the basis of this theory (see Section II). The phase oflower density being 
a wedge-shaped zone of plastically deformed and strain softened material; whereas 
the zone of higher density is the undeformed material neighbouring the craze. 
Furthermore the theory of meniscus instability has recently been invoked to ex-
plain ductile crack growth in epoxide polymers [404] tested at elevated temperatures 
and slow crosshead speeds. The finger-like furrows observed on the fracture surface 
are said to be formed by the break-up of the crack front as the crack grows through 
the plastic zone which is under constraint from the elastically deformed material 
outside. Fracture surfaces characteristic of ductile fracture may also be observed for 
specimens tested as very thin sheets [232] or in under-cured resins [405]. 
There has been considerable debate in the literature as to whether crazing may 
occur in thermosetting polymers. The evidence for crazing is not very substantial 
and comes from rather specific cases such as in straining very thin ftlms [38], in 
under-cured resins [406] or for systems with very low crosslink density which thus 
approach thermoplastic behavior. Indeed Donald and Kramer [318b] have shown in 
thermoplastics that there is a transition from crazing to shear yielding when the 
distance between physical entanglements decreases to below - 20 nm. There is an 
increasing amount of evidence that the primary mode of deformation certainly in 
epoxide resins, and probably for other thermosetting polymers as well is by shear 
yielding both in unmodified resins [407], rubber modified systems [240,408] and 
in composite materials [409] with epoxide matrices.

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
In many publications on fracture surface morphologies specific features have 
been attributed to certain crack velocities. However, such a correlaton may be 
questioned since the smooth featureless surfaces may be observed for crack speeds 
varying as widely as 10-7 ms-1 (in a double torsion test) to above 300 ms-1 (in a 
single edge notch test with a sharp pre-crack). This surface morphology is then re-
lated to stable continuous cracking at speeds which are defined by the specimen 
geometry and the inherent material characteristics. In contrast, Fig. 9.30 shows the 
fracture surface of an unfilled epoxide resin tested in the single edge notch geometry 
with a blunt pre-crack. The surfaces are rough with conical markings characteristic 
of the formation of multiple secondary cracks ahead of the main crack front. In 
many specimens tested under these conditions macroscopic crack bifurcation is also 
observed. The crack speed in this test, as measured by the sensitive graphite gauge 
technique [235], was also 300 ms- 1 • Thus, the crack speed under these conditions 
is independent of the pre-crack geometry and does, in fact, approach the limit for 
the propagation of stress waves in these materials [410]. Identical surface features 
are seen for unnotched tensile tests in both epoxide resins and polyesters [390]. 
Thus, for specimens without pre-cracks or with blunt notches excess elastic 
energy is stored in the sample at the moment of rupture which is expended in the 
creation of increased fracture surface area giving rise to rough surfaces. Narisawa et 
al. [245] calculate that in a blunt notched epoxy specimen an "ideal fracture stress" 
of up to 150 MPa is reached which is comparatively larger than that of glassy thermo-
plastics. Leksovskij et aI. [411] report on the "explosive nucleation of microcracks" 
in ED-20 epoxy resin. It may be concluded then that the fracture surface morphol-
ogy of these crosslinked materials is essentially determined by the specimen geom-
etry, the crack tip radius and the applied stress intensity factor rather than being 
uniquely defmed by the crack speed.

III. Molecular and Morphological Aspects in Crack Propagation 
2. Thermoplastics 
Fractography, the study of the morphology of fracture surfaces, is an obvious tool 
to elucidate the origin and the mode of propagation of a crack. At this point some 
remarks are necessary concerning particularly the effect of chain length and inter-
molecular attraction on the fracture surface morphology of thermoplastics. 
The discussion in 9 I C of the various terms contributing to the critical energy 
release rate GIc and the data assembled in Tables 9.1 and 9.2 have made it clear that 
a fracture surface is obviously not simply formed by the breakage of primary and/or 
secondary bonds across a fracture plane of molecular dimensions. There is always a 
plastic deformation of the crack tip zone and, consequently, of the ensuing fracture 
surface. It is to be expected that the extent of plastic deformation is the smaller the 
smaller the segmental mobility, i.e. the lower the temperature. At liquid nitrogen 
temperature most high polymers resemble glasses and fracture in a brittle manner. 
Viewed without magnification the fracture surfaces (e.g. Fig. 9.31) shows a macro-
scopic roughness but they appear to be locally smooth although not shiny. This 
indicates that the surfaces contain structural irregularities larger than the wavelength 
of light. This is the case with e.g. PE, PP, PVC, PS, and also with PMMA which, how-
ever, has a very smooth surface. 
The macroscopic features of the shown fracture surface (Fig. 9.31) can be ascribed 
to the propagation of a cleavage crack at high speed normal to the direction of local 
tensile stress. The local stress field is strongly affected by elastic waves generated at 
earlier stages of crack development and by the initiation of secondary cracks. The 
fracture surface was obtained by bending a notched polyethylene sample at liquid 
nitrogen temperature [130]. The surface is locally smooth but otherwise full of steps 
and ridges. The intersection of wavefronts and crack planes under different (e.g. right) 
angles leads to the curious patterns as shown in the bottom right of Figure 9.32. The 
characteristic properties of thermoplastics, molecular anisotropy and strong rate 
dependency of deformation become apparent to a limited extent only. 
The seemingly smooth parts of the cleavage surface deserve two further com-
ments. Figure 9.33 shows that the material disintegration of the "smooth" surface 
is not restricted to molecular dimensions but has a honeycomb-structure with cells 
of 100 to 600 nm width. This is in accordance with the earlier statement on the size 
of surface irregularities. It is also of interest to note that these dimensions are only a

few times larger than the radius of gyration of the chain molecules. The ridges be-
tween cells are highly deformed. As their width is comparable to that of the cells a 
plastic deformation of about 100% is indicated. This is in view of the test temperature 
quite remarkable. It is definitely caused by the fact that the comparatively long and 
strong molecules are not highly oriented but have a coiled conformation correspond-
ing in all probability to the "solidification model" of semicrystalline polymers 
(cf. 2 I C). Under these circumstances axial forces are only built up if a segment is 
subjected to a sufficiently large shear displacement. Material separation thus neces-
sitates the prior and substantial deformation of several entangled molecular coils. 
At room temperature molecular mobilities are increased and intermolecular 
attraction is decreased. The extent of plastic deformation leading to material separa-
tion is, therefore, increased rendering some of the formerly brittle plastics tough 
(cf. 8 II A). In HDPE at room temperature no cleavage fracture (unstable crack 
propagation) can be obtained by bending, it occurs only in notched specimens of 
low aspect ratio or if the rate of loading is high (impact loading). In samples of HDPE

III. Molecular and Morphological Aspects in Crack Propagation 
with extremely high molecular weight (Mw > 106 ) cleavage fracture does not occur 
at all. Material separation must be enforced through large strains. Visual inspection 
gives already an impression of the very large plastic deformation of such a specimen. 
The fracture surface contains numerous rosettes and ridges which are drawn by several 
hundred per cent. The energy consumed in forming new surface area is accordingly 
high. Specific surface features are observed on broken crazeable thermoplastics (see 
later). One can state that in short time loading of isotropic bulk polymers chain 
molecules do not significantly contribute to the fracture surface energy through the 
energies of bond breakage and elastic retraction. Large values of chain length and 
chain strength reduce, however, the effect of natural of artificial flaws as stress con-
centrators due to the larger amount of plastic deformation necessary before material 
separation occurs. Vice versa, at low molecular weights samples are increasingly more 
brittle, fracture surfaces are smoother, secondary events are rare or absent, and the 
fracture surface energy accordingly small. 
The above considerations apply to isotropic homogeneous materials, i.e. to 
amorphous [61, 198,200] and to semicrystalline polymers having no well defined 
microstructure [130]. There the direction of the fracture path is more or less deter-
mined by the local stress field. In any event no traces of a microstructure became 
apparent through the fracture surface morphology. Distinct fracture surface features 
are obtained, however, from polymers with a pronounced microstructure as intro-
duced by extended-chain crystallites or spherulites. There the material resistance 
depends strongly on the relative orientation of the fracture plane with respect to the 
structural element. 
Extended-chain crystallites have been studied by several authors (cf. 2 I C and 
8 I G).

amide 6 are reproduced [202]. The micrographs reveal stacks oflamellae which have 
a thickness of up to 700 nm. The authors conclude from their extensive IR, WAXS, 
and electron microscopical studies that the lamellae represent extended chains. As 
they have proposed in Figure 9.37 a crack may preferentially proceed either along 
the (010) planes (which contain the chain ends as well as impurities rejected from 
the crystal growth front) or along the (002) hydrogen bonded sheets of the lamel-
lae. Both processes do not involve the breakage of main chain bonds or of hydrogen 
bonds. 
With respect to extended chain crystallization under high pressure (p > 4 kbar) 
the authors discuss two mechanisms [201-202]. Based on the observed change in 
molecular weight distribution and decrease in molecular weight concurrent with 
chain extension they suggest that the thermal treatment under high pressure makes 
possible a transamidation reaction between -NH and -CO groups of broken chain 
folds belonging to adjacent lamellae [201]. On the other hand the appearance of

lamellae with a thickness much smaller than the average chain length has led them 
to the conclusion that fractionation is accompanying the pressure crystallization 
[202]. Gedde et aI. observe fractionation in linear PE [412]. 
The influence of a spherulitic structure of a semicrystalline polymer on its 
mechanical properties has been implicitely and explicitely recognized for a long 
time. Only a few references can be given here [183, 204-207]. Clark and Garber 
[205] review the effects of industrial processing on the morphology of crystalline 
polymers. Patel et al. [206] and Andrews [207] are especially concerned with a 
stress-strain analysis of spherulitic HDPE. They find a maximum of sample elastic 
modulus of 1.2 GN m -2 at a spherulite radius of 13 11m. Studies of the failure 
morphology of HDPE in an active environment [204] revealed 
that failure occurred almost entirely in a brittle mode 
that failure within an individual spherulite is interlamellar, and 
that the mode of crack propagation depended on the position of the spherulite 
center with respect to the crack front (leading to interspherulitic fracture in the 
case of poorly matching interfaces [204].

III. Molecular and Morphological Aspects in Crack Propagation 
Extensive morphological studies of polypropylene fracture surfaces have been 
carried out by Menges et al. [121,136] and quite recently by Friedrich [183]. Using 
polypropylenes of different molecular weight and tacticity subjected to different 
thermal treatment Friedrich [183] obtained samples of different microstructure: 
I fine spherulites (15 = 20 JIm) 
II coarse spherulites embedded in a matrix of fmer spherulites 
III fully grown coarse spherulites (15 up to 500 JIm). 
The slow crack growth in CT specimens of morphology II is schematically 
represented in Figure 9.38a. Crazes were seen to develop ahead of the crack preferen-
tially at the interfaces between coarse spherulites (Fig. 9 .38b), within larger spheru-
lites ( c) and at the boundaries of small ones (d). The behavior of a crack in the zone 
of rapid crack propagation is illustrated in Figure 9.39. A scanning electron micro-
graph of the fracture surface reveals the structure-induced deviations of the fracture 
path from a plane (Fig. 9.39a). The points 1 to 3 identify corresponding fracture 
paths in Figure 9.39a, b, and c. These paths follow a spherulite boundary (1) or they 
cut off respectively, a segment (2), or a cone (3). From his extensive morpho-
logical studies Friedrich [183] derived an order of the partial material resistance 
values which decrease from that of the 
-
separation of finely spherulitic matrix, which is the largest, to 
-
straight paths through coarse spherulites and their center, 
-
radial and tangential planes in coarse spherulites, and 
-
interfaces between coarse spherulites and fine matrix, to that of 
-- polygonal interfaces between coarse spherulites. 
The Kc values were found to decrease linearly with 15, increase with decreasing 
strain rate, and increase with molecular weight, the latter effect being especially 
pronounced with the coarsely spherulitic morphology. Tentative absolute values of 
R are determined for the separation of finely spherulitic matrix as 22 kJ m -2, and 
for interspherulitic rupture as 4 kJ m -2 [183]. The first value is of the same order of 
magnitude as that calculated by Kausch [11] for an oriented PP film (cf. further 
below). 
Special features of fracture surface have been studied by various methods. Rose 
et al. [413] identify by TEM intra- and interlamellar fractures as well as shear zones 
of several JIm depths in HDPE broken at liquid nitrogen temperature. Marichin, 
Mjasnikova and Pe1zbauer [414, 415] noted the bending of microfibrils at kink band 
boundaries in stress whitened PE and the formation of sub microcracks at these 
boundaries, a phenomenon thus far known to occur in fibers subjected to compres-
sion (see 9 III A 3). 
Besides by REM, TEM [413, 416] and optical microscopy [417], structural ir-
regularities have also been analyzed by microhardness tests [418] and surface analy-
sis techniques [419] such as photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) or secondary ion mass 
spectroscopy (SIMS). 
Obviously, most of these studies are carried out with one principal objective in 
mind: to learn more about the structural causes of a failure and about the influence 
of molecular and environmental parameters, material microstructure, and process-
ing variables on crack initiation and propagation. For the failure of semi-crystalline 
polymers in traction, Schultz [420] has drawn a useful failure map relating strain

lite cracking) and material and processing data (Mw, number of defective chains, 
crystallisation temperature and annealing treatment). 
One of the most important applications of thermoplastic construction materials 
is certainly their use as pipe material for water, gas and chemically agressive liquids. 
The technological problems which arise in their fabrication and use and the em-
ployed test methods are summarized in Table 9.5. Characteristic stress~train dia-
grams and failure morphologies of PVC (Figs. 1.1-1.4) and HDPE (Figs. 1.5-1.8 
and 8.36 to 8.39) have been presented earlier in this text.

fracture mechanics measurements 
A large number of publications deal with the ( static) long-term behavior of pipe 
materials; the few references chosen as an example [421-430] strongly refer to the 
works of Gaube, Milller et al. These studies concern obtention and evaluation of 
stress-rupture data in general [421], analysis of the morphology, including that of 
(defect-containing) fracture surfaces [422], the influence of processing variables and 
nucleation agents [423], specifications for testing [424], failure criteria based on 
creep analysis [425] and (linear elastic) fracture mechanics [426], guidelines for the 
choice of material, the dimensioning, and designing of plastic pipes [427], the long-
time behavior of wei dings, fittings and other elements [428], and the influence of 
temperature and oxygen [429] or of the presence of chemically aggressive environ-
ments [430] on the performance of plastic pipes. 
Some of the principal observations mentioned in the cited references have al-
ready been discussed in earlier sections while treating e.g. impact behavior (8 IT A 1), 
creep failure mechanisms (8 IT B 3) and fracture through slow crack growth (9 I D). 
For convenience, the essential conclusions with respect to pipe failure may be brief-
ly summarized as follows: 
376 

III. Molecular and Morphological Aspects in Crack Propagation 
hoop-stress vs. time-to-failure diagrams of polyolefins at modest temperatures 
generally reveal two branches corresponding respectively to (ductile) creep and 
(brittle) crack growth failure; 
-
although for PVC in principle both mechanisms operate, the two branches are 
sometimes [42Ia, 422k] but not always [42Id, 422a] observed (see Fig. 1.4 as 
an example of the latter case). 
-
at higher temperatures oxidative degradation constitutes an additional failure 
mechanism resulting in a third, almost vertical branch of the log oy-Iog tb curve 
(Fig. 8.39); 
one way of predicting the 50 years-20 °c behavior of stressed pipes is the repre-
sentation of creep and crack-growth mechanisms by two different Arrhenius 
equations and extrapolation from the short-time high temperature results [e.g. 
421g, 424, 427]; 
-
another way is offered by fracture mechanics which, in principle, permits cal-
culating the time of growth of "inherent flaws" to a critical size; this concept 
has been treated in detail in Section 9 I D, using PMMA as an example. Gray et 
al. [426e] have found it valid to predict the times to brittle rupture of HDPE 
with (calculated) flaw sizes of 10 to 100 J,lm; 
the presence of welds and fittings or of aggressive environments necessitates the 
use of an appropriately larger safety factor [426-430] 
the presence of notches, crack, and/or flaws affects the principal pipe materials 
differently; proposed criteria have been compiled in Table 9.6;

despite all progress in fracture mechanics, the visual inspection of the fracture 
surfaces obtained in short-time experiments for control of the extent of ductile 
deformation seems to be indispensable for an adequate rating of the long-time 
behavior of pipe materials (see also Section 9 III B and the references cited there)., 
The latter statement is underlined by taking a closer look at the calculation of 
lifetimes from inherent flaw sizes. Although this concept is basically promising, it 
still gives rise to some ambiguity because of the strong dependence of tb on the 
unknown size at of the largest "inherent flaw" and thus on K~~b in Eq. (9.23). 
Taking Gray's data, one starts from the relation: 
(9.32) 
which is in excellent agreement with measurements of Chan and Williams [426gJ. 
Integration of Eq. (9.32) should then lead to: 
(9.33) 
It has been observed, however, that the slope of the log tb vs. log ay diagram 
for HDPE varies around -4 (it is between -3 and -4 for Gray's data) and between 
-4 and -5 for Gaube's [421g, 427aJ. A possible explanation of the extremely note-
worthy ay dependence of tb may come from the disentanglement model presented 
earlier (8 IT B4). If it is assumed that a creep crack is preceded by a craze oflength 
rp and that the crack grows once the most highly strained fibril fails through disen-
tanglement at a time T after its formation, then one has: 
(9.34) 
Substitution from Eqs. (9.16) and (9.32) results in: 
(9.35) 
This seems to be plausible since with decreasing fibril stress, a decrease in the 
rate of disentanglement should also be observed (as shown for PMMA [329,330]). 
If it is finally assumed that the essential portion of a crack in a pipe grows at a 
rate determined by Eq. (9.34), one arrives at: 
(9.36) 
Although the exact forms of Eqs. (9.35) and (9.36) have as yet to be derived, 
the latter expression gives the correct relation between tb and avo 
Concluding this topic, the special characteristics of the principal pipe materials, 
together with typical applications, have been compiled in Table 9.7, enabling a first 
material selection.

less attention in the literature. In fact many of the investigations of crazing [76- 177] 
use fractography as a means to elucidate the propagation and breakdown of crazes. 
Earlier studies of fracture processes concerning PS are especially reported in refs. 
[106,115,132,150,155,169,191,194,199], concerning PMMA in [61,66,197, 
200], PVC in [198, 208], and PC in [196], newer ones have been discussed in Sec-
tion 9 II. 
A feature common to practically all fracture surfaces of glassy polymers are the 
remnants of craze layers. At low speeds of crack propagation craze breakdown will 
generally occur in the center of the craze material leaving a more or less homogeneous 
layer on each fracture surface [15, 50, 150, 194, 199]. In PS at intermediate and 
higher crack speeds decohesion at the craze/matrix interface becomes possible at 
room temperature. Beahan et al. [150] have investigated this phenomenon more close-
ly; Figure 9.40 shows their micrograph of (the rather isolated) event of a crack which 
after having propagated at intermediate speeds was stopped in the craze region. The

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
micrograph permits recognition of the de cohesion of highly strained craze material at 
the interface and also the oscillation of this phenomenon between the opposite inter-
faces. The regular oscillation of the decohesion of craze material creates "mackerel 
patterns" with typical band repeat distances of between 10 and 70 J1m. Hull et al. 
[150,194,199] and more recently Doyle [431] discuss the dynamic conditions of 
their formation and the effect of sample temperature. They observe that at tempera-
tures below 235 K no mackerel patterns are formed whereas the initiation of second-
ary fractures is greatly enhanced. 
A more pronounced transition from slow to fast crack propagation is reported 
for PMMA [61, 66,197,200] but the surface features are roughly comparable to 
those in PS. As observed by Doll and Weidmann [61,66] at slow crack speeds 
(Ii < 0.1 ms- 1), independent of molecular weight, a rather smooth fracture surface is 
formed which even carries on accidental deviations from the plane in the form of 
parallel markings (left hand side of Fig. 9.41). After the transition to rapid crack 
propagation the fracture surface morphology changes completely. A pattern of ribs 
or lines running approximately parallel to the crack front becomes visible. Although 
length, direction, and spacing of the ribs are not very regular (Fig. 9.41, right hand 
Side) an average spacing of 90 J1m has been measured [61]. At a somewhat higher 
molecular weight (Mw = 163000) a spacing of about 220 J1m is observed (Fig. 9.42, 
right hand side). At very low molecular weight (Mw = 51000) rib spacing is 20 to 
24 J1m [200]. In view of the symmetry of these markings on the two corresponding 
fracture surfaces, rupture of the craze material in the center plane seems to be indi-
cated. This phenomenon is somewhat different in origin, therefore, from the mackerel 
pattern but also related to the formation and breakdown of crazes. The mackerel 
pattern was caused by the oscillating occurrence of craze/matrix decohesion. The rib 
markings, however, are better interpreted as hesitation lines, also designated as stick-
slip, i.e. as the alternating development and breakdown of craze material [61, 196, 
200]. This is explained by referring to the craze model presented in Figure 9.20. It 
may be assumed that at t = to the crack front just faces a fully developed craze whose 
width and length (region C) comply with the Dugdale model (Eqs. 9.16 and 9.18). 
The propagating stress field and the stresses which can be supported by the craze 
zone are momentarily in equilibrium. At t = to + ~t, however, the craze is supposed 
to open further and to support loads which are beyond the load carrying capability 
of the molecular strands. Consequently the most advanced strands break thus initiat-
ing the rupture of neighboring strands as well. The catastrophic breakdown is slowed 
down once the crack has advanced within region C so far as to reach little-drawn 
craze material. After the slow-down of crack propagation redevelopment of the craze 
begins which may be completed at, say, t = to + tl . Considering the average crack 
speed (v = 400 ms- 1) and the rib spacing in Figure 9.42 (220 J1m) one can calculate 
that the time interval tl for catastrophic breakdown and redevelopment is 0.55 J1S. 
The cyclic crack propagation seems to be influenced, however, by additional mecha-
nisms which are not yet fully understood. 
Thus the PMMA samples having the slightly higher molecular weight reveal at 
crack speeds of 200 to 300 ms-1 a rather smooth fracture surface containing no ribs 
but a large number of parabolic markings (Fig. 9.42, left hand side). These markings 
are seen in higher magnification in Figure 9.43, they derive from the coalescence of

primary and secondary crack fronts travelling in one craze zone but in slightly dif-
ferent planes. The fracture surface of poly carbonate - broken in tension at room 
temperature - reveals a strikingly similar pattern [196]. In that case the distance 
between the planes of primary and secondary cracks has been found to be 0.43 J.1m 
at room temperature increasing to 0.75 J.1m at -196°C. 
381 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
Doll [61] reports that PMMA samples with a higher molecular weight 
(Mw ~ 490000) do not show ribs on the high-speed fracture surface (Fig. 9.44). 
Secondary fractures (this time in different craze zones) may be initiated, however, 
leading to parabolic markings in that surface region (Fig. 9.45). Kusy et al. [200] 
find ribs and parabolas in the molecular weight range 92000 ~ Mv < 270000. A cer-
tain molecular coil size is ( quite obviously) necessary to permit the transfer of stress-
es sufficient for the initiation and temporary propagation of a secondary fracture 
plane. Cottrell [432] has noted rather early that the density of parabolic markings 
is correlated with the energy consumed and thus with fracture toughness. 
In the referenced literature further details are discussed which may be obtained 
from fractographic analysis, such as the effect of Wallner lines on the disposition of 
the ribs [61, 196, 200], "crazeless fracture" in low molecular weight PS [155], the 
retarded breakdown of crazes in fatigue (cf. III D), the ductile fracture of PS at lower 
loading rates and at temperatures close to T g through the growth of one or more 
diamond shaped cavities [169], the globular appearance of ion-etched PS craze matter 
[132] and PVC surfaces [208], and craze-like features on the surface of broken phenol-
formaldeyhde samples [195].

In this section the morphology of fracture surfaces has been discussed, a mor-
phology which reflects the local modes of material separation. The microscopic size 
of the structural elements to be broken or separated has been recognized: molecular 
strands, fibrils or coils, ribs, crystalline lamellae, spherulites. In talking about their 
383 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
ultimate response, however, macroscopic terms had been used: breakage, shear de-
formation, limits of plastic deformation, material resistance. For good reasons no 
molecular criteria for material separation had been given. For individual molecules 
such criteria exist: the temperature of thermal degradation and the stress or strain 
which causes the chain to scission. For the mentioned structural elements no such 
simple criteria exist. Perhaps one may mention the critical role of temperature in the 
transition to rapid crack propagation [30, 50, 184-186, 197] and the constant value of 
local strain Ey in the extension direction (Fig. 9.46) which was found - independent 
of crack length - to reach about 60% at the cracktip in biaxially oriented PETP fllm 
[209]. One may also mention the critical concentration of chain end groups NIR 
determined by microscopic infra-red spectroscopical investigation of the near-crack 
zones of oriented PP fllm (Fig. 9.47) and of the fracture surface of PE bulk material 
[210]_ Both materials are tough and strong. The given stress distribution in front of 
the crack in the PP fllm permits calculation ofKc as a (rhf2 rrr = 8.3 ± 2 MN m-3/ 2 
and Gc as 30 ± 17 kJ m-2 [11]. These values, in connection with Table 9.1, indicate 
quite clearly that chain scission is accompanied by severe plastic deformation. The 
possible role of chain scission during or after the application of large orientational 
strains has been discussed in detail in Chapter 8.

3. Fibers 
Important aspects of fiber fracture have already been treated in Sections I, F and G 
of chapter 8 (fracture mechanisms in relation to sample morphology). At this point 
reference to fractographic studies will be made. The visual inspection and the study 
of broken samples by means of optical or scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are 
important tools of fracture analysis. They obviously aid 
-
in the detection of possible causes of crack initiation and 
-
in the interpretation of the fracture process. 
The appearance of a fracture surface undoubtedly is the most convincing evi-
dence that the fracture process has reached the phase of non-homogeneous deforma-
tion. Frequently the surface and morphology of a failed specimen reveal whether 
or not a phase of homogeneous material deformation has contributed to the fracture 
event. Figures 9.48 and 9.49 serve to illustrate this point. These fracture surfaces 
are more or less an arbitrary result of a large number of homogeneously distributed 
scission and slip processes of chains and microfibrils. The fracture surface was 
developed within a very small fraction of the total lifetime and at a location not 
predictable in advance. 
Hendus and Penzel [433] investigated the fracture morphology of polyamide 6 
monofllaments. The regularly spun and drawn monofllaments were subsequently 
subjected to tensile tests at various strain rates. Characteristic fracture surfaces are 
reproduced in Figures 9.50 and 9.51. At small strain rates (e = 0.033 S-1) frequent-
ly v-shaped notches are observed (Fig. 9.50). Such a notch is formed through a crack 
which initiates at a flaw or material inhomogeneity contained in the fllament surface 
or in a zone close to the surface. While the crack grows slowly the remaining fiber 
cross-section continues to deform plasticly. At a point determined by the sizes of 
the crack and of the remaining cross-section and by the material properties rapid 
transverse crack propagation occurs. The measured strength of the monofllament is 
385

the higher the smaller the v-shaped notch [433]. Filaments of highest strength 
contained barely visible small voids. 
Figure 9.50 also shows an enlargement of the head of the monofilament. This 
enlargement corresponds to a shrinkage of the oriented material caused by the warm-
ing of the filament during the plastic deformation. If the rate of deformation is in-
creased to 50 s-1 then the heat generated through the plastic deformation of the 
remaining cross-section cannot be dissapted fast enough. Locally the melt tempera-
ture is exceeded, the filament heads expand almost to the diameter of the undrawn 
material (Fig. 9.51).

III. Molecular and Morphological Aspects in Crack Propagation 
Fig. 9.51. Corresponding ends of a PA 6 monofil broken at a strain rate of 50 s-1 (Courtesy 
H. Hendus, (435)) 
The fibrillar nature of drawn monofilaments becomes apparent in Figure 9.52. 
The filament ends of two different fracture events show a strong axial splitting. As 
concluded from the formation of small heads at the ends of some microfibrils the 
fibrillation must have occurred before the catastrophic fracture took place. Strong 
axial splitting is also known from polyamide 66, Kevlar [438a), PETP, acrylic fibers, 
wool, human hair, and cotton fibers (see 8 I F and G and [436,438]). 
On the basis of fractographic studies Bunsell and Reade [438b) indirectly 
identified a fatigue mechanism in polyamide 66. Oriented PA-66 fibers failed in a 
tensile type manner if they were fatigued uniaxially between an upper stress level 
equal to the long-time static strength and a lower level of clearly non-zero tensile 
stresses. These fatigue failures had a morphology similar to that shown in Figure 9 .50. 
The breakage apparently did not involve any specific fatigue effect. If the loading 
conditions were changed, however, so as to include zero tensile or even compressive

stresses a specific fatigue fracture morphology became apparent. Those breaks, oc-
curring after lOS cycles, were characterized by the propagation of a crack, almost 
parallel to the direction of the fiber axis. As shown by Figure 9.53 [437] this leaves 
a long tail of material at one fiber end. As discurred in 8 I F Oudet, Bunsell et al. 
[ 438c] have recently studied a similar phenomenon in PETP fibers. It may be con-
cluded from Bunsell's and Hearle's observations [436, 438b] that compressive yield-
ing and/or buckling of microfibrils or fibrils takes place on a microscopic scale. The 
repeated lateral rearrangement leads to a gradual amorphisation and to loss of inter-
fibrillar cohesion. A crack which has started at some flaw in a direction normal to 
the tensile stress (J will turn, therefore, into a direction u alniost parallel to (J - the 
angle between u and (J being a function of the lateral stress transfer which still 
remains. The extent of fibrillation thus depends on the degree of orientation and 
crystallinity [438d]. 
On the basis of his extensive investigations Hearle [436] has established a classi-
fication of the main features of fiber fracture morphologies: 
A. Transverse Elastic Crack Propagation 
This is the classic form of failure in elastic materials and consists of a relatively 
smooth "mirror zone" of crack propagation leading to a rougher zone of final 
failure due to mUltiple crack-initiation (comparable in morphology to Fig. 1.7). 
B. Ductile Transverse Crack Propagation 
This is a form of fracture in which a crack propagates stably across a fiber under 
increasing load and/or strain and is opened out into a V-notch by the continued 
plastic yielding (the final stages of the drawing process) of the remaining material; 
the crack leads into a region of final catastrophic failure, occurring when the stress 
in the remaining reduced cross-section reaches a critical level (Fig. 9.50). 
C. Transverse "Fibrous" Break 
This type of break runs perpendicularly across the fiber, with a rough texture 
and no evidence of any propagating cracks; the whole structure appears to be 
ready to fail at the same time, and the breaks are very similar in appearance to 
Fig. 9.53a, b. Corresponding ends of fatigue failure of polyamide 66 under oscillating load

lower-magnification views of the fracture of fiber-reinforced composites (Fig. 9.48 
and 9.49). 
D. Axial Splitting under Tension 
In some fibers failure in axial tension occurs by cracking, or splitting, along planes 
close to the fiber axis. Due to a nonhomogeneous fibrillar substructure there will 
be shear stresses in these planes. With reduced interfibrillar cohesion a break is 
produced characterized by multiple axial splitting over a long length (equal to 
many fiber diameters) (Fig. 9.53). 
E. Splitting Due to Torsion 
Under shear stresses generated by torsion, splitting can occur along lines deter-
mined by the directions of stress and of material weakness. 
F. Axial-fatigue Cracks 
Particular localized cracks, deviating slightly from the fiber-axial direction, 
develop in many fibers as a result of tensile fatigue: they are associated with shear 
stresses at discontinuities. The resulting breaks show a long tail on one end, a strip 
off the other end, and a final catastrophic-failure region (Fig. 9.53). 
G. Fatigue-cracking along Kink-bands 
Kink-bands at angles of about 45° develop in many fibers in compression, for 
example, or on the inside of bends, and, in repeated flexing, these eventually turn 
into cracks and lead to fiber failure. 
H. Multiple Splitting in Fatigue 
In torsional- or flexural-fatigue situations, multiple splitting frequently occurs 
and can eventually lead to failure. 
For a more detailed discussion ofjiber fracture morphology the reader is refer-
red to the series of publications by Hearle, especially to "An Atlas of Fibre Fracture" 
[436b]. 
B. Defects and Inherent Flaws 
Almost any brittle fracture surface contains traces of a flaw or an inclusion which 
automatically will be blamed for having started the final crack and reduced the 
strength or time to failure of the specimen. Whereas the first point (origin) can 
generally be determined unambigously, the second is less clear, particularly if the 
flaws or inclusions originally are small. 
This section can not attempt to review the abundant literature on stress concen- . 
tration effects of cracks or particles and on the numerous electron microscopical 
investigations as to the origin of polymer failures. But a few remarks concerning the 
identification, nature and location of flaws and inclusions and their effect on a 
stressed sample will be made. 
The value of an optical and electron-optical inspection of a fracture surface for 
defect recognition has already been discussed earlier (see Section 9 III A, especially 
refs. [251, 422d, e, 439-442]). Defect analysis using surface analytical methods 
[419], microtome slices [422a, 443] and positional X-ray scattering technique 
(PSAXS) [444] must also be mentioned. The role of flaws as possible stress con-
centrators and the notion of inherent flaws has been discussed in detail in Section 
389 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
9 I D (see also [440,445]). Without any doubt, the presence of particles (impurities 
or fillers) reduces the strength and the time-to-failure of a specimen; the scatter of 
these variables grows with particle size [422d, 440, 446-448]. 
In order to identify systematically the nature and position of defects in (LDPE) 
pipes Stockmayer and Wintergerst [422a] developed a cutting technique which per-
mitted to transform the entire pipe wall into a continous thin peeling of 0.06 to 
0.15 mm thickness. By inspecting this fIlm they were able to correlated nature, 
frequency and position of defects with time to failure tb of the pipes. The irregulari-
ties they found were clear zones not mixed with carbon black in the form of points, 
linear marks, hooks (Fig. 954) and parallel striations. They claim that with a certain 
preference the final creep crazes originated in those areas of the pipe wall where 
the irregularities were more frequent. It was particularly noted by them that the 
lifetimes tb of those pipes where the creep crazes had started close to the inner or 
outer surface of the pipe wall were an order of magnitude smaller (tb = 740 h) than 
those where the crack had originated in the center (tb = 7400 h). Although the dif-
ferences in stress distribution within the pipe wall, due to frozen-in tensions (see 
next section), may influence crack initiation it seems to be more probable that net-
work defects are mostly responsible for this observation. As discussed in detail in 
Chapter 8 II B the inner walls of extruded pipes down to a depth of 0.5 mm are the 
first to experience an eventual network degradation. It was precisely in this region 
that Stockmayer and Wintergerst found the origins of the most rapid failures [422a, 
see also 439, 442]. 
Fig. 9.54. Zone of about 3 mm length in a LDPE pipe 
which escaped mixing with carbon black (from 
Stockmayer [422a)) 
To test the influence of the observed irregularities further the authors performed 
tensile drawing and static loading experiments on samples cut from the peelings. In 
these experiments, there was practically no correlation between yield stress and time 
to failure on the one hand and kind and concentration of flaws and inclusions on 
the other. However, the effective elongation of fIlms containing defects was much 
smaller since the necking samples generally broke whenever the neck had reached the 
defect. This behavior confirms the statements made before [439] and in the previous 
section, namely that very often creep craze nuclei must be considered as network 
defects which are not detectable in short time loading tests unless the defective zone 
is locally subjected to large deformations. 
390 

III. Molecular and Morphological Aspects in Crack Propagation 
Evidently the question on the influence of inclusions added in the form of 
blending components or fillers is of vital importance to the fabrication and use of 
polymer composites. This problem cannot be discussed, however, in the context of 
this monograph. 
Apart from the - material-related - flaws, voids, inclusions and imperfections 
of mixing, there are other weakening effects which are related to the structure as a 
whole such as irregularities of the geometry, internal tensions, weld lines, and orien-
tation distributions; although the latter effects will be discussed subsequently, it 
may already be indicated that an analysis of the nature of decisive defects in POM 
and PA [443] revealed that material inhomogeneities and voids had been the most 
frequent. 
Geometry 
A simple variation in sample cross-section can tum out to be a decisive defect. Thus, 
the ductile failure of uniaxially or biaxially loaded samples generally takes place at 
the smallest cross-section (Fig. 1.2). It should be noted that the failing section may 
be perfectly safe at higher stresses (brittle fracture) or longer times (creep crazing), 
because the breakdown in those cases is initiated by network defects or flaws. The 
weakening influence of bends, joints, sleeves, and fittings on pipe constructions had 
already been indicated above [428]. 
Internal Tensions 
Any viscoelastic body cooled from outside from above its solidification temperature 
(T g or T m) to a lower temperature T c deforms non -homogeneously and either bends 
or contains frozen-in tensions. The distribution and absolute value of such tensions 
can be determined from a layer removal experiment [442]. In pipes they generally 
show a parabolic distribution, compressive at the outside, smaller and tensile at the 
wall inside. Williams [449] derived the thermal, circumferential stresses aRCs) as: 
aB(t') 
( Nu 
) [1 (s )2] 
a (s)=--(T -T) -- ---
R 
1 - v 
m 
c 
2 + Nu 
3 
W 
with: 
s 
distance from inside wall 
Q 
coefficient of thermal expansion 
E( t') Young's modulus at time after cooling down 
v 
Poisson's ratio 
Nu 
Nusselt number 
W 
wall thickness 
For a HDPE pipe he had determined (compressive) stresses of -3 MPa at the 
outside and a tensile component of + 1 MPa at the inside. Compared with the exter-
nally applied values of 15 to 20 MPa the frozen-in tensions are not entirely negligible. 
Mittal et al. [450] and Lee et al. [451] use the birefringence of transparent polymers 
to measure residual stresses. 
391 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
Orientation distributions 
Structure anisotropy is one of the characteristic properties of chain molecules and of 
any oriented polymer matrix. Many injection molded or extruded samples show signs 
of anisotropy (birefringence, extent of shrinkage). The HDPE pipe represented in 
Figure 1.6 gives an excellent example. The heavily deformed zone consists of mole-
cules highly oriented in circumferential direction. In this direction fracture strength 
has considerably increased (perhaps by a factor of 10). Although the largest stress 
component still acts in this direction rupture occurs in axial direction, perpendicular-
ly to the chain axis. Thus, a growing crack preferentially separates chains instead 
of breaking them (the fibrils bridging the crack only underline this statement). 
c. Impact Fracture of Notched Specimens 
In Chapter 8 tensile and impact behavior of unnotched specimens have been discussed. 
The principal changes in behavior to be expected from the presence of a notch would 
have to be due to the changed state and intensity of stress in the crack tip zone, to 
the essential confinement of fracture development to a limited region, and to the 
increase in rate of local deformation. An analytical description of these effects has 
been attempted in terms of linear elastic fracture mechanics (9 I). Neglecting the 
geometrical correction term the uniaxial brittle strength of a cracked thick plate is 
derived from Eq. (9.10) as: 
(9.37) 
In this case the effect of a notch of length a is clearly indicated, therefore. In the 
general case of rupture involving plastic deformation, however, one would have to use 
Kc (or Gc) and a corrected crack length a + f(rp) in Eq. (9.37). All these quantities 
depend heavily on the degree of plastic deformation at the crack tip, which in turn is 
influenced by crack length, notch tip radius, and loading conditions. In the case of 
heavy plastic deformation the rupture stress of a specimen would depend little on 
the initial crack geometry but strongly on the "strength" of the plastically deforming 
matrix. Three questions are raised, therefore, which will be discussed in the following: 
which notch sensitivity is actually observed with different polymers, when are geo-
metrical and when are material parameters of critical importance, and what is the 
influence of chain length and mobility? 
The notch sensitivity of polymeric materials has been comprehensively investi-
gated by Takano and Nielsen [211]. The authors define a notch sensitivity factor ks 
of the yield or breaking strength of tensile bars as 
ks = UF(O) A(a) 
uF(a) A(o) 
(9.38) 
with A being the (reSidual) sample cross-section. In the same way a notch sensitivity 
factor k T of the energy to break (area under stress-strain curve) is defined. 
. 
The authors tested some 40 different materials at strain rates of 2.5 mm/min for 
rigid materials and of 25 mm/min for soft elastomers employing six different crack 
392 

III. Molecular and Morphological Aspects in Crack Propagation 
geometries. The "most severe" was a single notch of 3 mm depth (in a 12 mm wide 
sample) and of 0.25 mm notch tip radius (notch s). The "least severe" was a double 
notch of 3 mm depth and 1.5 mm notch tip radius (notch d). The authors measured 
- where possible - the Izod impact strengths, the yield (OF) and breaking strengths 
(Ob), and Young's modulus of notched and unnotched specimens. 
From their measurements a sequence ofks(s) values can be established: 
PMMA (4.71), Kraton ®-1l01 (3.68), SAN (2.71), PSU (2.36), EPDM rubber (2.12) 
and various particle filled thermoplastics (2.14-1.33). The ks(d) values exhibit a 
similar sequence: 
PMMA (1.64), Kraton ®-1l0l «1.69), SAN (1.62), and PPO (1.48). There are, how-
ever, quite a number of (ductile) materials with ks(s) values smaller than one, 
notably HDPE (0.88), PTMT (0.96), PTFE (0.94), PA 6 (0.93), and Hytre14055. 
Values below unity of ks(d) are more numerous than those of ks(s). 
Notch sensitivity factors for energy, kT' show a somewhat different order. With 
some rare exceptions (PP + 20% glass, PE + 40% glass) kT values are always larger 
than unity. The factor kT(s) reaches values of 625 (semi-transparent PETP), 241 (PSU), 
61 (P A 66 + 0.6% H20), 48 (PP and PMMA), and 16 to 17 (mineral filled PA 66, PC). 
For kT(d) the authors determine 81 (PA 66 + 0.6% H20), 34 (PPO), 29 (semi-trans-
parent PETP), 19 (PP), and 14 (annealed HDPE and transparent PETP). All other kT 
values measured are smaller than 13. 
The data of Pagano and Nielsen [211] confirm the observation that the presence 
of a crack not necessarily reduces the tensile strength of a sample or its energy to 
break. The authors also note that in some cases (notably in HDPE, PTMT, PTFE, 
PA 66 + 0.56% H20) the "more severe" notch s is the less dangerous and has a smaller 
kT value than notch d. The reason for this unexpected reversal is not clear but it may 
be related to the volume of polymer under elevated stress in the notched region. This 
volume at the tip of a blunt notch is larger than that at the tip of a sharp notch [211]. 
Regarding the experimental evidence (e.g. [58,64, 211, 214,452]) one may say that 
in the case of a very sharp notch (Pa < 50 fJm) the onset of rapid crack propagation 
is determined predominantly by notch length a and material fracture toughness Kc 
according to Eq. (9.37). In a blunt notch specimen, however, the tangential stress 
Oy at the root of the notch has to be considered the critical quantitiy [58,64]. If the 
shape of a blunt notch is approximated by an ellipse the well known Neuber-Inglis 
formula [4] can be used to calculate uy : 
(9.39) 
The stress concentration increases with decreasing Pa whereas the apparent 
critical energy release rate (Gc)blunt decreases. Considering also a plastic zone of size 
rp Plati and Williams [64] obtain: 
(9.40) 
Whenever the measurement of the energy to break a specimen in tension or 
flexion is used to determine critical energy release rates, it must be recognized, that 
393 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
this energy is the sum of a number of quite different terms. As outlined in 8 II A, 
the energy loss An' which a pendulum incurs in striking and breaking a specimen, is 
a measure of the elastically stored energy We, of the fracture surface energy Ws' of 
the kinetic energy W kin of the broken pieces, and of otherwise dissipated energy. 
The elastic energy to bend the specimen to a deflection 8 under load P amounts to: 
We = ~ 8P = ~ P2C, with C being the bending compliance. The energy to propagate 
failure should principally correspond to the elastic energy stored at the point of onset 
ofrapid crack propagation, which can be expressed now as: 
(9.41) 
A plot of An over BDq, should give, therefore, a straight line with slope R = Gc . 
Testing nine different brittle and ductile polymers (from PS to PE) by the Charpy 
and the Izod methods, Plati and Williams [64] were able to arrive at fairly unique 
values of Gc (cf. Table 9.2). They point out, however, that in order to obtain linear 
BDq, plots they had to consider an effective crack length consisting of the initial 
crack length and the size of Suitably chosen plastic zone (see also [453-455]). 
If the condition for unstable crack propagation is not fulfilled or maintained 
throughout the available range of crack lengths then a continued supply of mechani-
cal energy is necessary to propagate the crack through the material. In that case the 
failure energy An should be mainly proportional to the ligament area: 
(9.42) 
Corresponding plots of An over B (D-ao) for HiPS and ABS [53, 64, 69] revealed 
this linear relationship. 
The fact that even the rapid deformation of a glassy polymer under concentrated 
stresses entails considerable local plastic deformation immediately suggests that the 
molecular properties, which influence yielding and flow, are also effecting Gc and 
thus the impact strength. The data compiled in Table 9-2 reveal this dependency of 
Gc on temperature, rate of deformation, and molecular properties. A possible rela-
tion between molecular relaxation processes and fracture energy of polymers has 
been pointed out in many of the cited references (e.g. (14, 19,22,24,25,54,63, 
64,212-214,235, 324d, 453-455]). 
In 8 II A an account of the role of mechanical relaxation mechanisms in the 
impact loading of unnotched specimens has been given. The reasons for an expected 
positive correlation (and for the also observed deviations) between impact strength 
and magnitude of mechanical losses have been indicated there. At this point the 
molecular aspects of notched impact strength are to be investigated. Sauer [213] and 
Vincent [214] have reviewed the impact and stress-relaxation data from a large 
number of publications including their own extensive works and those referenced in 
8 II A. They arrive at various general conclusions which may be listed in the following: 
The impact resistance rating of a polymer is generally determined by the storage 
component E' of its dynamic modulus. For some twenty different polymers tested, 
65% of the data complied with the following correlation [214]: 
394 

III. Molecular and Morphological Aspects in Crack Propagation 
Impact resistance rating 
Modulus 
-
brittle 
E' > 4.49 GN m-2 
-
brittle if bluntly notched 
E' ~ 3 GN m-2 
-
brittle if sharply notched 
E' ~ 2.2 GN m-2 
-
tough but crack propagating E' < 1.5 GN m-2 
Deviations from this scheme were either related to molecular structure (bulky side 
groups ofPMMA), to mechanical loss peaks (PTFE, HDPE, PC, PPO), to mor-
phology (injection molded PP), or to heterogeneous reinforcements (short glass 
fibers, particulate fillers). 
-
Polymers with high impact strength at room temperature also have a significant 
low temperature loss peak (tan 8 ~ 5 . 10-2 or higher). Polymers in this class 
include, PE, PC, PB, PTFE, PCTFE, POM, and the polyamides. 
-
Polymers with low impact strength at room temperature usually have no signifi-
cant low temperature loss peaks in the 100 K to 300 K range (PS, PMMA). 
-
Impact strengths have been measured as a function of temperature in several 
polymers and it has been shown that in many cases one gets a rise in brittle impact 
strength in the vicinity of the low temperature 'Y-relaxation (PTFE, PE, POM). 
For example, in PTFE at about 210 K, in PE at 150 K. Good correlation has also 
been observed between the magnitude of the low temperature 'Y-Ioss peak in poly-
sulfone and impact resistance for a series of specimens cont!lining various amounts 
of an antiplasticizer. 
-
An increase in molecular weight will generally affect the impact strength through 
the increase in Gc ; this is most notably observed in HDPE (cf. 8 I~ A). 
-
In high impact polystyrene (HiPS) the normally brittle PS matrix has been blended 
with a suitable rubber-type component such as a styrene-butadiene copolymer 
which has a glass transition well below room temperature. The impact strength 
increases in proportion to the amount of the second component added. In this 
case of a two-phase polymer, however, impact resistance is increased through the 
initiation of a myriad of fine crazes and not through the generally increased 
extensibility of a homogeneously deforming matrix. 
D. Fatigue Cracks 
The characteristics of fatigue loading, i.e. of the repeated application of varying stress 
or strain amplitudes have been introduced in detail in Section 8 II C. In that discussion 
one point was left open: that of the mechanism of fatigue crack propagation. A com-
prehensive elaboration of this subject has quite recently been given by Hertzberg in 
his book on "Deformation and Fracture Mechanics of Engineering Materials" [3]. 
The reader is referred to this work or to the review articles by Plumbridge [217] and 
Manson and Hertzberg [218] for a detailed discussion of the different stages of 
fatigue crack growth, of the distinct characteristics of fatigue fracture surfaces, of 
the various theoretical approaches to derive crack growth-rate equations, and of the 
S-N curves of a wide variety of homogeneous and fiber reinforced polymers - and 
of metals, for that matter [3, 217, 218]. At this point only some recent observations 
395 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
will be discussed which seem to be directly related to the chain-like nature of macro-
molecules [173,178,191,215-220]_ 
As to be expected, the growth of a crack under constant or increasing load and 
fatigue crack propagation have quite a few features in common. Thus both the static 
and the fatigue fracture surfaces reveal a slow growth and a rapid crack propagation 
zone. The stress intensity factors reached in both cases at the transition from stable 
to unstable crack propagation correlate very well [218]. The rate of stable fatigue 
crack growth is empirically expressed by most authors [218,456-460] in form of 
~=A(AK)n 
dNF 
' 
(9.43) 
with A and n material parameters and AK the applied stress intensity factor range. 
This is in complete analogy to the expression for the rate of crack propagation under 
static loading (Eq. 9.22). Marshall et al. [133] and Radon et al. [219] substitute AK 
by the difference of K2 and K3 terms. Andrews et al. [215] employ in their analysis 
of the fatigue of PE the energy release rate Gc (instead of AK) as independent param-
eter. Such approaches are not significantly different because of the relation between 
K and G and of the form of Eq. (9.43). In their detailed reports [3, 218] Hertz-
berg and Manson analyse the various theoretical approaches, furnish fatigue crack 
growth data for some 20 materials at different temperatures and frequencies, and 
discuss the effect of environmental and material parameters. 
Skibo, Hertzberg, and Manson [191] studied fatigue crack growth characteristics 
in polystyrene as a function of stress intensity factor range and cyclic frequency. 
Precracked single edge notched and compact-tension type specimens made from 
commercially available polystyrene sheet (mol. wt. = 2.7 . 105) were cycled under 
constant load at frequencies of 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 Hz, producing growth rates rang-
ing from 4 . 10-7 to 4 . 10-3 cm/cycle. For a given stress intensity level, fatigue 
crack growth rates were found to decrease with increasing frequency, the effect being 
strongest at high stress intensity values. The variable frequency sensitivity of this 
polymer over the test range studied was explained in terms of a variable creep com-
ponent. The macroscopic appearance of the fracture surface showed two distinct 
regions. At low stress intensity values, a highly reflective, mirror-like surface was 
observed which transformed to a rougher, cloudy surface structure with increasing 
stress intensity level. Raising the test frequency shifted the transition between these 
areas to higher values of stress intensity. The microscopic appearance of the mirror 
region revealed evidence of crack propagation through a single craze while the appear-
ance of the rough region indicated crack growth through many crazes, all nominally 
normal to the applied stress axis. Electron fractographic examination of the mirror 
region revealed many parallel bands perpendicular to the direction of crack growth, 
each formed by a discontinuous crack growth process as a result of many fatigue 
cycles. The size of these bands was found to be consistent with the dimension of the 
crack tip plastic zone as computed by the Dugdale model. At high stress intensity 
levels a new set of parallel markings was found in the cloudy region which corre-
sponded to the incremental crack extension for an individual loading cycle [191 ]. 
396 

III. Molecular and Morphological Aspects in Crack Propagation 
In these experiments two chain-related phenomena have been observed: the dis-
continuous growth of a fatigue crack and the frequency sensitivity of the growth 
rate. The discontinuous growth of a fatigue crack had been noted earlier for other 
polymers as well: PVC [216], PMMA, PC, and PSU [191]. Elinck et al. [216] report 
that, depending on frequency, between 130 and 370 load cycles were necessary to 
form one "arrest line" in PVC; Skibo et al. [191] found 600 to 1400 cycles for PS. 
The width of these growth bands corresponded well to the plastic zone size rp cal-
culated from the Dugdale model. Based on these findings Skibo et al. [191] propose 
as a possible crack growth mechanism the gradual development of a craze of width 
rp and its subsequent and rapid breakdown. Such a mechanism would also be sup-
ported by the model of craze formation given in GIl C: once the critical and fre-
quency-dependent fibril extension is reached at the crack tip cooperative breakdown 
of the fibrils occurs and the crack propagates from DIC almost to B (Fig. 9.20). 
This behavior has been well detailed in a series of intriguing experiments by 
Schinker, Konczol and Doll [461-463]. These authors took a video-fIlm of the 
interference fringe patterns of a discontinuously growing crack (in PVC); they suc-
ceeded in observing the very moment of crack jumping [462]. They also showed 
that the so-called continuous crack growth (i.e. one striation formed per cycle) oc-
curs in reality within about 20% of the loading period (at peak load). Using syn-
chrotron radiation as a powerful X-ray source, the breakdown of craze fibrils (in 
PS) during fatigue can also be traced in real time [464]. 
The frequency-dependent rate of disentanglement of the molecular coils in the 
fatigued fibrils seems to account for part of the frequency effect on growth rate. 
In addition hysteresis heating occurs in the straL'led craze material. Both effects 
combine to give rise to a distinct frequency sensitivity of A for a variety of materials 
such as PC and PMMA [219,220], and PPO, PVC, PA 66,PC, PVDF, and PSU[220]. 
As has been noted by Skibo et al. [220] the frequency sensitivity varies with tem-
perature. It reaches a maximum at that temperature where the external (fatigue) 
frequency corresponds to the internal segmental jump frequency (of the (3-relaxation 
process). 
The effects of strain amplitude, sample molecular weight, environment, and 
surface coating on the fatigue properties of PE and PS have been studied by Sauer 
et al. [173, 178]. Their results have been discussed in 8 II C. It is especially note-
worthy that the initiation of a fatigue crack can be retarded by a decade or more 
through the application of a compatible, viscous coating. A 600 molecular weight 
PS oligomer served this purpose for both polished and unpolished surfaces of cylin-
drical PS specimens [178]. 
The relation between microstructure of LDPE and fatigue crack growth was 
investigated by Andrews et al. [215]. They found growth rates according to Eq. 9.43 
in two regions: that of the initial brittle transpherulitic crack propagation and that 
of the ductile crack propagation at higher K values. Between these two regions a 
distinct transition region was found where daldNF depended little on LlK [465, 
466]. 
Concluding this section, some recent references on additional aspects of fatigue 
crack growth will be given: analysis of the propagation in viscoelastic media [467], 
lifetime predictions [468], the observation of an epsilon crack tip plastic zone [469] 
397 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
and fatigue damage analysis [470, 438c]. The latter investigations have clearly 
shown that the microstructure (ofPVDF, PA 66, POM, and PETP) in advance of 
the crack front is different from the original morphology. 
E. Fracture-related Phenomena 
1. Electro-Fracture Mechanics 
A fracture mechanics concept has been used by Zeller et al. [471] to describe the 
mechanism of dielectric aging in solids. It had been noted already earlier by Schirr 
[472] that the growth direction of partial discharges (PD) in an electrically and 
mechanically stressed solid (epoxy resin) depended on both fields: the discharge 
channels tried to avoid the plane perpendicular to the largest compressive stress 
component; on the other hand tensile stresses increased their growth rate in perpen-
dicular direction [472,473]. 
In order to better understand this phenomenon several approaches have been 
taken. A criterion analogous to the Griffith one can be set up for the growth of 
partial discharge channels in a dielectric. The formation of a PD channel requires a 
formation energy Wf' Wf contains a surface energy term and a plastic deformation 
energy term because it is supposed that channel formation requires plastic deforma-
tion. It can be shown that under normal circumstances the plastic deformation term 
is dominating and the surface energy may be neglected. 
The initiation or growth of a PC channel leads to a release of electrostatic energy

(9.44) 
where x is the growth coordinate and the derivative is to be taken at the growth 
front. Equation (9.44) is universally correct independent of the detailed growth 
mechanisms. In the literature [471] models have been introduced to calculate both 
the left- and right-hand side of Eq. (9.44). 
An important feature of discharge channels certainly is their tendency to branch-
ing into complicated stochastic patterns [471-475]; however, similar fractal struc-
tures will be obtained in non-equilibrium particle aggregation which, therefore, has 
been used for the modellisation of (planar) discharge patterns [474-476]. 
The above problem is not yet fully understood although many contributing 
phenomena, such as electron injection and transport [477-479], the kinetics of dam-
age development in electric fields [473,480-483], the influence of polymer mor-
phology, cohesive energy density [483] and Young's modulus [479] and of liquid 
environment [484-486] ("water treeing", see e.g. [484,485]) have been investigated.

III. Molecular and Morphological Aspects in Crack Propagation 
2. Fracto-Emission 
Fracto-emission in the narrow sense is understood as the emission of particles (e.g. 
electrons, ions, ground-state and excited neutrals, and photons) during and follow-
ing fracture [487-489]. However, since localized fracture events give already rise to 
an emission at a much earlier stage of polymer deformation, one may as well speak 
of mechano-emission [490-493]. When polymers are deformed in a vacuum elec-
tron emission occurs [490]. Such emission takes place during the stretching of car-
bonchain and heterochain polymers of both oriented and unoriented types. By com-
paring mechanoemission characteristics with features of the accumulation of molec-
ular products of breakdown one finds a close correlation between mechanoemission 
and the breakdown of polymers under load [491]. According to Zakrevskii and 
Pakhotin [490-492], the emitted electrons are formed by autoionization of highly 
loaded chains possibly involving a tunnel transition of electrons into deep traps 
which are subsequently destroyed during deformation. The ionized bonds which 
have a reduced mechanical strength (see Chapter 4 II B 2) should then dissociate 
rapidly under the applied stress and form a macroion and a macroradical [492]. 
However, Enikolipian et al. [487] propose as a "more mechanical" mechanism 
the rupture of the most highly stressed chains which diSsipate their stored elastic 
energy through fragmentation of the newly formed free chain ends and in the form 
of thermal and electronic excitation of their surrounding. Without any doubt the ex-
cellent sensitivity of the methods tracing emission products permits an early detec-
tion of localized fracture events. On the other hand, the fact that the events are 
localized makes it difficult, at this time, to draw valid conclusions with respect to 
the continuation of the deformation process and the occurence of froal fracture. 
3. Mechano-Chemistry 
In a broader sense mechano-chemistry comprises all aspects of the stress-induced 
scission of chain molecules. In a narrower sense, however, one speaks of mechano-
chemical methods if one refers to the intentional mechanical degradation of (solid) 
polymers. The objectives in the latter cases are the comminution or softening of the 
material or the production of large and highly reactive surfaces as a means to initiate 
permanent chemical bonding between different polymers. In Table 9.8 an overview 
on methods and processes is given which may result in a mechanical degradation of 
chain molecules. The objectives of these processes are indicated with respect to the 
deformation mechanism. It should be pointed out that in the mechano-chemical 
methods, in the narrower sense, the degrading solids are subjected to ill defined, com-
plex states of stress leading to a deformation which always includes Simultaneously 
the yielding and flowing of material and the breakage of chains. Table 9.8 lists 
the deformation mechanisms which are the most important in view of the corre-
sponding objective. Reference is made to those chapters and sections of this book 
where the particular deformation mechanisms are treated. 
In recent years a number of comprehensive review articles on the mechano-
chemistry of polymers have appeared [221-226,494,495]. A competent two-
volume handbook by Porter and Casale on this subject [227] is also available. The

experimental variables (type of equipment, temperature, rate of mechanical work-
ing, atmosphere) or polymer characteristics (chemical structure, initial molecular 
weight) on the. resulting material properties. 
Within this monograph special consideration is given to the loading and breakage 
of molecular chains. With regard to mechano-chemical processes such as comminution 
or mechanical synthesis one has to study, therefore, 
the response of the polymer matrix to mechanical working 
the consequences of chain scission: reduction of molecular weight and radical 
formation 
the results of radical reactions, e.g. oxidative degradation, cross-linking, copoly-
merization. 
The property changes resulting from a mechanical treatment of polymeric 
materials have been known and utilized for a long time. Thus knowledge of the fact 
that mechanical working of natural rubber leads to its softening already dates back 
120 years [225]. But it was only after the introduction of the concept of macro-
molecules some fifty years ago that this effect of mechanical treatment was related 
to the rupture of molecular chains. The fact that the intensive milling of a hetero-
phase mixture (of rubber and maleic acid anhydride) can induce a chemical reaction 
between the components was first observed in 1941 [224]. Systematic studies of the 
nature of these chemical reactions and particularly of the role of the formed free 
radicals began about ten years later [224-225]. 
The response of polymer matrices and of chain molecules to mechanical working 
have been intensively discussed in the previous chapters. The ESR investigations of 
ground polymers (6.1V A and 7.1 C 3) have shown that in a comminution process 
(e.g. milling) chain molecules are broken in large numbers and as a consequence of 
the formation of new surface during the breaking-up of the polymer particles. The

chain ruptures have an immediate and notable effect on the sample molecular weight 
M [221-228]. In Figure 9.55 M is plotted as a function of particle diameter D. The 
linear sections may be represented by a potential law 
(9.45) 
wh~re A and n are material-related constants. Curves a and b in Figure 9.55 reveal 
that chain scission is more effective in polystyrene (n = 0.76) than in PMMA 
(n = 0.50). In both cases comminution was carried out [228] in the presence of 
radical scavengers (N02) to prevent chain recombination or cross-linking. Comminu-
tion in air seems to have permitted cross-linking reactions to such an extent that the 
average molecular weight of a particle size fraction did not change with D (curve c). 
The opposite effect, decrease of M without increase of specific surface was noted by 
Komissarov et al. [222] in the dispersion ofPA and PETP fibers without cooling. 
It is a general observation that in continuous mechanical working D (and M) do 
not decrease indefinitely but reach certain limiting values. These limiting average M 
values are of the order of the entanglement molecular weight Me. This does not 
preclude the possibility that in mechanical degradation fractions of low molecular 
weight and even volatile components can be produced [221-225]. 
The effect of environmental temperature on the rate of degradation has also been 
widely studied [221-227]. In view of the composite nature of the degradation process 
no simple rate equations can be expected. It becomes clear from Eqs. (5.41) and (7.3) 
that the softening of the matrix (decrease of ~ 0) and the reduced effective bond 
strength V(T) partly balance each other. According to an extensive review by Casale 
[226] the temperature effect on matrix rigidity seems to be the dominant one. The 
slower relaxation times at lower temperatures lead to an increase in mechanical degra-
dation with decreasing temperature (negative temperature coefficient of the overall 
mechano-chemical reaction).

I. Introduction 
The fonnation of cracks, i.e. fracture, and the healing of cracks in polymer solids are 
two complementary processes. Some of the molecular mechanisms described in the 
previous chapters on fracture also apply - by simply changing direction - to crack 
healing, such as relaxation of chains towards an equilibrium conformation, establish-
ment of network isotropy, closure of voids and fonnation of entanglements. The role 
of these mechanisms in fracture has become clearer through the study of crack heal-
ing. It is for this reason that a chapter on this subject is included in a book on frac-
ture. 
The tenn crack healing as it is used today designates the build-up of mechanical 
strength between two (crack-) surfaces of a (fracture mechanics) specimen which are 
brought into contact (above Tg). Through determination (at room temperature) of 
the stress intensity factor KIi at which the crack begins to refonn and propagate 
through the healed contact zone, a quantitative measure of the healing effect is ob-
tained. This method was principally developed in Lausanne [1,2,4] and Urbana 
[3,5]; it has recently been discussed in some detail by Kausch et al. [6]. 
416 

II. Models of Adhesive and Cohesive Joint-Strength 
The physical mechanisms involved in crack healing are the following (Fig. 10.1): 
Establishment of contact and adhesion between the surfaces 
-
Viscoelastic deformation of surface irregularities 
Interdiffusion of molecular segments across the interface 
-
Formation of new entanglements in the interfacial region. 
The concentration and stability of these new entanglements determine the 
material resistance during reopening of the crack. The principal mechanisms had 
already been noted in 1949 [7] when it had been observed that the coalescence of 
thermoplastic particles only occurred well above the (glass-) transition temperature 
and by "interpenetration of the chains in the two surfaces". 
Adhesion, viscoelastic deformation, diffusion, and entanglement formation are 
obviously of quite general importance and have been studied extensively (see for in-
stance [6-58]). They are also the basis oftechnical welding [8] which, however, will 
not be covered in this monograph. 
Fig. 10.1. Stages of crack healing: I, Pointwise physical contact; 
2, Viscoelastic deformation and wetting; 3, Chain interdiffusion; 
4, Establishment of equilibrium. - A slight normal pressure 
(p - 1 bar) is needed to obtain physical and thermal contact 
during the healing procedure. The tensile stress (1 necessary to 
separate the surfaces after the healing procedure can be used as 
a qualitative measure of the healing effect (from [4]) 
II. Models of Adhesive and Cohesive Joint-Strength 
A. Adhesion and Tack 
A measure of the reversible, purely physical attraction of two solids across an inter-
face by Van der Waals forces [9] is the work of adhesion Wadh . This quantity is for 
instance given by the relationship of Dupre [10]: 
(10.1) 
where the superscripts d and h refer to dispersion forces and hydrogen bonds respec-
tively. Adhesion and autohesion (the adhesion between alike bodies) have been 
treated comprehensively by Voyutskii [11]. In this respect it is useful to distinguish 
between adhesion as defined above and adherence which designates the energy mea-
sured experimentally when separating two surfaces in contact. The latter term in-
cludes the energy of possible viscoelastic deformations occurring in the surface re-
gions (or in even larger parts of the contacting bodies). 
The adherence between identical elastomers, known as tack. has been studied for 
a long time (see e.g. [12-16]). Bister, Borchard, Rehage etal. [13, 14] have identified 
four stages in the build-up of strength between surfaces in contact (Fig. 10.2). The 
417 

10. Fracture Mechanics Studies of Crack Healing 
influence of thermodynamical and viscoelastic surface properties on the adhesive 
joint strength had been further analyzed by Koszterszitz [15], Wool et al. [3] and 
Zosel [16]. In most of these studies fracture of the adhesive bonds occurred in the 
plane of contact. 
A different and important concept, the fracture mechanics analysis of adhesive 
failure had been introduced by Williams [17] and was further developed and applied 
subsequently [18-20]. As becomes clear from the previously cited references the 
viscoelastic behavior of the contacting surfaces and of the molecules forming them is 
of prime importance for the establishment of interfacial contact and for the build-up 
of strength through the interdiffusion of chains and the formation of entanglements. 
From the very large body of literature on viscoelasticity only a few papers may be 
cited [21,22]. 
Generally the strength of a joint AlB is cohesive in nature whenever the failure 
does not occur exactly at the interface between A and B but at some (small) distance 
from it and within A or B. In the case of joints between identical or compatible 
polymers it seems to be adequate to speak of cohesive failure whenever the interac-
tion between entangled A and B chains is so strong that their separation gives rise 
to large scale local deformation. In the studies of Bister and Borchard (Fig. 10.2) on 
elastomers cases I and II must be classified, therefore, as adhesive failure, case IV as 
cohesive failure. Case III fulfills both criteria: separation occurs exactly at the inter-
face between A and B but the interaction between the just entangled molecules is 
sufficiently strong so as to provoke notable deformation of the interface.

time; in region I physical contact is gradually established, in region II chain ends penetrate the 
interface, in III they form entanglements (which are unstable in subsequent fracture); in IV the 
separation of the adhering surfaces causes large scale deformation of the whole sample, fracture

418 

II. Models of Adhesive and Cohesive Joint-Strength 
B. Joint Strength of Thermoplastic Polymers 
The joint strength due to purely physical attraction is low and is of the order of the 
"true surface energy", 'Y. To achieve practical strength, there must be an interchange 
of material across the interface by some sort of chain diffusion process. As later 
discussed in detail these diffusion processes can only occur at temperatures equal to 
or above Tg. This condition was easily fulft1led for the studies at room temperature 
of elastomer adherence [11-16]. In the case of thermoplastic materials, however, 
strong attention must be given to the fact that glass transition temperature T g' 
temperature T h of bond formation, and temperature of bond strength measurement 
(normally ambient temperature) will be quite different. IfTh > Tg one has to do 
with polymer melts and with the formation of weld or knit lines. This important 
processing effect has more recently been studied for injection molded thermoplastics 
such as PS and PC [23a-g] and blends of EPDM and PP [23h]. Depending on the 
time of chain interpenetration and the molecular mobility a distinct effect on the 
strain at break of weld-line containing samples or on their strength at break had 
been observed (see Fig. 103). Qualitative evidence of the effect of chain diffusion 
was also obtained from studies of the coalescence and fusion behavior of particles in 
contact [24].

Before analyzing the relation between joint strength and chain interdiffusion at 
solid surfaces any further it is necessary to consider the kinetics of contact establish-
ment. It is reasonable to assume that the strength of two surfaces brought into con-
tact will firstly be proportional to the contact surface area ratio AI Ao , where A is the 
contact area and Ao the total cross-sectional area of the joint, and secondly to the 
proportion NINo of the links formed across that area, where N is the number of links 
419 

10. Fracture Mechanics Studies of Crack Healing 
actually formed and No the concentration of links at "full strength", Gco . Healing 
would then be described by the following equation: 
Ce(t) _ A(t) N(t) 
Ceo - Ao 
No' 
(10.2) 
The achievement of complete contact (Le. when A/ Ao = 1) for a surface with 
some initial roughness requires the distortion of that roughness under the action of 
interfacial pressure, both external and from surface work. In polymers, the time-
dependence of this process will arise from viscoelasticity and the duration will be 
governed by the current material stiffness. Clearly, for high temperatures (T > Tg), 
the modulus is low and, even under small external pressures (pressure p ~ 0.8 bar), 
complete contact will be achieved rapidly. 
Some estimate of the time-dependence of contact area changes can be made by 
assuming that the modulus of the material has the form 
(103) 
where E is the Young's modulus at time t, Eo is a reference modulus at time to, and 
m is a constant. Then, Hertzian contact theory [25] gives 
( a )2/3 
Aa. -E 
' 
(10.4) 
where a is the applied compressive stress. Surface energy may contribute to the ef-
fective a. By now assuming an extreme condition, namely that the development of 
strength is exclusively due to the increase in contact area, Le. that N(t) = No, Eq. 
10.2 gives Ce a. A. Thus, it would be expected that the time-dependence of the cor-
responding stress intensity factor after healing, KIi, would be of the form 
( a )1/3 
KIi a. Eo 
tm/3 . 
(10.5) 
For low temperatures, Le. for elastic behavior, m goes to zero and Eo is much 
larger than a, thus the degree of contact is small and remains almost constant. For 
T > Tg, a/Eo can be significant even for modest contact pressures and m approaches 
1 for viscous type behavior, leading to a rapid establishment of complete contact. 
The constant of proportionality will, of course, be governed by the roughness of the 
two surfaces. If the extreme condition were valid one would expect, therefore, a 
dependency of KIi on t1/3 • 
The links at the interface are formed by the crossing of chain ends over the inter-
face and the interpenetration of chains. This occurs at T > Tg. With increasing heal-
ing time all traces of the original interface will gradually dissappear. If the healing is 
interrupted at a very early stage and the crack is reopened, then apparently adhesive 
failure will occur at a plane corresponding to the former interface and at unmeasur-
ably small values ofKIi (for PMMA this value will be below 0.2 MPa m I/2 ). In the 
420 

II. Models of Adhesive and Cohesive Joint-Strength 
Kn region, however, where the progressive healing of cracks can be followed quanti-
tatively (0.3 < Kn ,,;;; 1 MPa m1/2 for PMMA) one clearly observes extensive fibril-
lation of the partially healed material (see Fig. 10.4); the ensuing fracture of the 
sample must, therefore, be classified as cohesive even if it is still the region of the 
former interface which remains the weakest part within the structure. 
Fig. 10.4. Crack front in a partially healed, dried PMMA 7H (th = 10 min, Kl = 0.82 MN m-3/2, 
from Ref. [59]). The interference micrograph shows well that the crack front (irregular, cloudy 
fringe pattern) is preceded on its whole width by at least a few narrow fringes which are charac-
teristic for a craze zone 
This shows that the condition N(t) = No has been too extreme and that there 
will be a separate time-dependence of Kn associated with the self-diffusion of the 
polymer. The time-dependence observed in Gc will depend on which of the two 
mechanisms is the slower, and thus the controlling process. It is, of course, possible 
to visualize a rather complex interactive process when the two time scales are similar 
with each section of the area having a different diffusion time depending on its time 
in contact. Such a mechanism could be modelled but as a first approach the two time 
scales will be considered to be distinctly different. For smooth surfaces of "normal" 
molecular weight samples at temperatures T > T g' it is likely that intimate contacts 
are achieved very quickly and that diffusion is the governing process. Some conse-
quences of slow wetting of very high molecular weight material as observed by Wool 
et al. [3] will be discussed later. In any event the actual diffusion rates may be 
dependent on the state of the surface. 
In the following section a model description of crack healing is given which 
evidently must try to relate the interdiffusion of chains achieved during the healing 
process with the material resistance measured in a subsequent experiment. 
C. Model Description 
The model used to interprete crack healing studies is shown in Figure 10.5. An ideal-
ly plane crack in a (compact tension) specimen is visualized. The "strength" of the 
virgin material is characterized by its stress intensity factor Kia' After crack closure 
and healing the crack is reopened (at room temperature); the thus determined stress 
intensity factor Kn is a measure of the healing effect. The healing is brought about 
by the interpenetration of molecular coils from either side of the interface. It is 
absolutely admitted that the real interface is not an ideal plane. This will not change 
the evaluation of the data very much since in any event it must be assumed that the

Fig. 10.5. Compact tension or double cantilever beam specimens are generally used for crack 
healing experiments; basic molecular analysis of these experiments mostly refers to molecular 
coils situated at an ideally plane interface before interdiffusion 
molecular displacements in a certain surface region contribute to the healing process. 
Important, however, are the composition, the density and the state of orientation of 
the surface layers and the influence of these parameters on chain diffusion. 
The study of diffusion and especially of the self-diffusion of entangled systems 
has received growing interest in the last decade, particularly due to the progress in 
theoretical concepts [26-28] and experiment methods such as radioactive tracer 
technique [29-31], nuclear magnetic resonance [32-40], infrared microdensitom-
etry [41-45], scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray 
analysis [46], frustrated multiple internal reflection spectroscopy [47], forced Ray-
leigh scattering [48,49], neutron scattering [50,51], fluorescence redistribution after 
pattern photobleaching [52, 53], forward recoil spectrometry [54] and Rutherford 
backscattering spectrometry [55-57]. An excellent review on polymer selfdiffusion 
in en tangled systems has just been given by Tirrell [58]. 
The different modes of chain diffusion (center of mass diffusion, reptation) and 
their dependence on scaling laws and on the thermodynamic interaction between the 
diffusing species are extensively discussed in the cited literature [24-58]. With 
respect to the healing of interfaces between identical or compatible polymers as 
discussed in the following, it can be said that reptation is the predominant mode of 
chain diffusion. This random molecular motion leads to the crossing of chain ends 
over the interface, to a gradual interpenetration of chains and to the formation of 
new entanglements. Due to the statistical nature of this process there will be a large 
local variation of the number of diffusing chain ends and of their curvilinear depth 
~Q of interpenetration. This means that even at small values of(~Q)1/2 there are 
some chains which have penetrated much further than the minimum distance ~Qmin 
necessary to form an entanglement. At the end of the crack healing process n(th) 
new entanglements per unit surface area will have formed in the interfacial region 
near the former crack surfaces. Unless the healing has been absolutely complete, 
n( th) will be smaller than fie, the corresponding concentration of entanglements in 
the virgin material. 
In the cited healing studies [1-5] cracks are reopened subsequent to healing in 
order to measure quantitatively the healing effect. An analysis of the microscopic 
fracture process of glassy polymer such as PMMA or SAN showed [59, 60] that 
fracture at room temperature proceeds through the formation and rupture of craze 
fibrils (see Fig. 10.4). 
422 

II. Models of Adhesive and Cohesive Joint-Strength 
In the interfacial r.egions of incompletely healed specimens there are fewer 
entanglements than elsewhere and possibly they are found close tot the chain ends. 
It must then be assumed that in the process of fibrillation especially the newly 
entangled chains are highly stressed and that they are gradually loosing those entan-
glements which are close to the chain ends. Evedently the complete dissolution of 
the new entanglements in a particular cross-section of a fibril will lead to the rupture . 
ofthat fibril (see Fig. 10.6). The above assumption would conveniently explain the 
observed correlation between the extent of fibril deformation and rehealing [1-5]. 
In order to establish a quantitative relation between healing times and fracture 
energy GIi it is necessary to know how n(tp) is built up through interdiffusion during 
crack healing and how this same concentration of entanglements is reduced "to zero" 
(or to some critical value) in the subsequent fibrillation process.

The diffusion of a particular chain molecule in the melt is evidently subjected 
to the constraints imposed on it by its neighbors. As proposed by de Gennes [26a] 
and Doi and Edwards [27] these constraints can be considered to form a tube within 
which the molecular segments can perform wriggling and translational motions. The 
latter are described by the Einstein relation: 
(10.6) 
where the "tube diffusion coefficient Dt " is related to the monomeric friction coef-
ficient ~o:

10. Fracture Mechanics Studies of Crack Healing 
At this time the center of mass of the chain will have moved by a distance 
<f)",y2)1/2 approximately equal to the radius of gyration, Rg • The self-diffusion 
coefficient, Ds' then is derived as 
(10.9) 
The molecular weight dependence predicted for the self-diffusion coefficient Ds 
of (long) chains by reptational motion is stronger, therefore, than that of chains in 
(dilute) solutions for which the Rouse theory gives 
(10.10) 
Most of the cited studies of self-diffusion in entangled systems [33-58] have 
confirmed the M-2 dependency of Ds (see [58] for an extended discussion). In the 
following it is assumed that the relations 10.6 to 10.9 also describe the interdiffusion 
of chains in the crack healing experiments. 
Kausch, Jud et al. [1,2,4,6] used an entanglement model for the analysis of 
their crack healing data. They assumed that the number, n, of entanglements formed 
per unit surface area is proportional to the "distance f)",Q" travelled by the molecular 
chains 
n(th) _ (2Dt th ) 1/2

(10.11) 
where TO is the time necessary for "complete healing". It follows from the above 
criterion that D cancels out, i.e. that the time dependency of net) is the same no 
matter which diffusion mechanism applies. These authors then have further assumed 
that the fracture energy Ge(t) of the healed interface is proportional to the number 
of entanglements formed [1,2,4,6,64-66]. In terms of the stress intensity factor, 
Kn, this gives 
(10.12) 
It is the merit of the Kausch-Jud model of crack healing to have explained for 
the first time and in a straightforward manner the t 1/ 4 dependence of the increase 
of the stress-intensity factor. Nevertheless, a more detailed discussion of the two 
basic assumptions (Eqs. 10.11 and 10.12) is necessary in relation with the experimen-
tal data. 
The crack healing models of Wool et al. [3,5,67-69] and of Prager and Tirell 
et al. [70-72] are based on very similar considerations though their final fracture 
criteria are slightly different. Wool et al. [67-69] look at the average interpenetra-
tion distance of the X segments belonging to those parts of the chains which have 
424 

II. Models of Adhesive and Cohesive Joint-Strength 
completely disengaged themselves from their original tubes (they call those parts 
"minor chains"; cf. Fig. 10.7). They then assume that the fracture stress a is propor-
tional to X which gives [5, 67]: 
(10.13) 
Wool et al. [3] point out, however, that the time dependency of a will be dif-
ferent in the case of notable contributions of the wetting stress to a and in the 
case of slow wetting. This could lead to a stress intensity factor after healing of: 
and to a corresponding energy release rate 
. In their analysis they consider the frictional energy losses during pull-out of 
minor chains to be the principal contribution to the fracture energy. In the case of 
long chains chain scission would become increasingly important.

10. Fracture Mechanics Studies of Crack Healing 
Prager. and Tirrell [70-72] have carried out computer simulation studies of chain 
interdiffusion (see Fig. 10.8). They find that in a system describing freshly broken 
samples which contain many chain ends at the contacting surfaces the number of 
molecular bridges spanning the original interface increases with tl/4 M-1/ 4 ; in 
equilibrated samples they except that this number increases with tl/2 M-3f2 • 
Whereas all the above studies [1-6, 26,47, 64-72] ~ad to the same conclusion, 
namely that chain reptation is the essential healing mechanism, they give rise to 
different interpretations as to how the "minor chains" influence the fracture energy. 
This point will, therefore, be taken up again in the discussion of the experimental 
results.

III. Experimental Studies 
A. Uncrosslinked Thermoplastics 
1. Experimental Procedure 
Representative results have been obtained [1,2,47] with poly(methyl methacrlate), 
PMMA 7H (molecular weight Mw = 1.20 x 105 ; molecular weight to molecular 
number ratio Mw/Mn = 2) from R6lun GmbH., and styrene acrylonitrile (SAN), 
Luran 368R co-polymer (25 mol % AN, of Mw = 1.20 X 105 ) from BASF. Both have 
the same glass transition temperature, Tg = 375-377 K, and are completely compa-
tible [73]. Compact tension (CT) specimens were compression moulded from gra-
nules. The specimens were of length 26 mm, width 26 mm and depth 3 mm; a notch 
was introduced into the sample by sawing. it was subsequently sharpened by a razor 
blade. the specimens were fractured in tension and their original stress intensity fac-
tor, KIo was determined (cf. Sect. 9 I A). For one series of specimens, the smooth 
fracture surfaces were brought in contact again and very lightly pressed together. 
426 

III. Experimental Studies 
This sandwich-like preparation was then placed in a pre-heated hot-press, and a slight 
pressure of about 1 bar was applied normal to the major specimen surface. The 
specimen temperature, T h , was set to between 1 and 15 K above the glass transition 
temperature, Tg • The pressure, was needed to establish full contact between the frac-
ture surfaces but it was so small that the specimen geometry was not affected. The 
samples for this experiment, which truly can be called "crack healing", have always 
been held at ambient atmosphere. They had a humidity of about 1 % .. 
As indicated by the authors [2], vacuum-dried samples were taken and treated 
as above in a second series of experiments. For a third series, flat surfaces were 
prepared by polishing the fracture surfaces of dried specimens. Arbitrarily-selected 
surfaces were then welded together as described above. In each case the re-healed or 
welded specimens were completely uniform and transparent and did not show any 
trace of the former surfaces. 
2. Results and Observations 
The fracture toughness at crack initiation, Kn, of rehealed and welded CT samples 
clearly is a function of healing time, th, and healing temperature, T h. The fairly large 
scatter involved in these measurements requires a large number of experiments. In 
Figure 10.9 the results of series 1 (curves 1 to 4) and series 3 (curve 5) are presented. 
In a Kn against t1l4 -plot, all the lines are straight and go through the origin. The re-
sults from series 2 (vacuum dried samples) are also represented by straight lines hav-
ing a smaller slope, however. 
The experimental data are in full agreement with the model representation; 
they confirm that crack healing undoubtedly progresses with chain interpenetration 
and that entanglements must have formed in a completely healed specimen. The data 
comply with the assumption that the concentration n( th. T h) of entanglements per 
unit surface area coupling chains from opposite surface sides increases in proportion 
to the average length (Q2»)1/2 of chain interpenetration (Eq. 10.11). It follows that 
(I0.11a) 
where (Q02»)1/2 is the average length of interpenetration necessary to obtain full 
healing. Equation (I0.11a) does not permit the determination ofDt and (Q02) in-
dependently, but it explains very well the experimental observation that Kn depends 
linearly on t1l4. 
From Figure 10.9 one can determine the temperature dependence of Dt.1f it is 
assumed that the critical number of links, no, and their volume density do not 
depend on temperature, then it follows from Equation 10.11 that

thus far reported for the self-diffusion coefficients which have been referrenced by 
Jud [2, 47] and Tirrell [58] for experiments carried out at temperatures T distinctly 
higher than T g. 
3. Estimation of Diffusion Coefficients 
The diffusion model predicts very well the time-dependence of the rehealing ex-
periments but it leaves a number of questions open concerning the physical interpre-
tation of the observed diffusion mechanism, such as the absolute values of Dt,and 
Ds, the role of chain-ends and of molecular weight, the influence of relaxing fibrils, 
formed in the first fracture event, and the nature of the established physical links. 
Absolute values of a diffusion coefficient, Ds, can be estimated, however, using a 
theory of Graessley [2Ib], based on the work ofDoi and Edwards [27]. Ds can 
be related to measurable viscoelastic and structural parameters such that

(10.16) 
the definitions and values of the quantities used in this equation are given in Table 
10.1. The calculated values ofD also permit the determination of the depth of inter-
penetration, <tly2}1/2 ; for fully rehealed specimens Jud et al. [2] found <tly2}1/2 to 
have a value of 2.5 nm. This seems to be a reasonable depth, since the radius of gyra-
tion for PMMA of the critical molecular weight is about 5 nm.

For a PMMA 7H, polished and dried, one obtains a diffusion coefficient D(390 K) 
= 833 . 10-22 m2s-1 and a th = 60000 s. Thus,..J 4Dth amounts to 14 nm. Under 
these conditions only 4% of all the chains in a 20 nm layer on either side of the inter-
face have interpenetrated into the opposite matrix by at least Rg [4]. If one assumes 
that they are fully entangled they then contribute 4% of the equilibrium entanglement 
density of20· 1024 m-3 . The contribution of those chains having only partially 
intersected may be roughly estimated to correspond to 5%. In all one has, therefore, 
at TO a cconcentration of newly formed entanglements which amounts to 9% of the 
equilibrium concentration. It is thus quite understandable that the Kli(tfi/4) curves 
are linear all the way up to the Kio -level. 
429 

10. Fracture Mechanics Studies of Crack Healing 
The above estimate should be taken with all due precaution in view of the sim-
plifications introduced into this model, particularly concerning the exact diffusion 
mechanism in the early stage of crack healing and the relation between depth of 
interpenetration and number of entanglements formed per chain. It may serve, how-
ever, as a first quantitative basis for ensuing discussions. 
4. Reopening of Healed Cracks 
As discussed above, the mechanical measurement ofKn at the moment of the reopen-
ing of a healed crack forms the basis of the healing studies. In order to obtain further 
information on the healing mechanisms, some interference microscopical studies 
were undertaken by the Lausanne group jointly with the Fraunhofer-Institut fUr 
Werkstoffmechanik in Freiburg [59]. From these investigations it was learned that 
the crack front in healed specimens is as irregular as the length, s, of the craze zone 
at the crack tip (Fig. 10.4). Both irregularities must be ascribed to the fluctuation 
during rehealing. In those areas where the chains have penetrated less than the ever-
age distance, (2Dt th)1/2 , only short craze zones will be formed. Thus, according to 
the Dugdale model the local K value will be smaller: 
K(s) = (8sG~i'rr)1/2 
where GF is the yield stress.

III. Experimental Studies 
By determining K(s) along the crack front and subsequently averaging Konczal 
et al. [59] obtained a value ofK(s) = 0.81 MN m-3/2 • This value was in excellent 
agreement with the applied K value during slow crack propagation of 0.82 MN 
m-3/2 . 
The slow crack growth in rehealed PMMA samples is exemplified in Figure 10.10. 
The crack grows preferentially through a widening of the weakest regions. Obviously 
the crack front does no longer present the slightly bent profile observed in virgin 
samples but a real "alpine landscape". This fact may influence the evaluation of any 
crack rate effects but doe~ not preclude the use of KJi as a measure of the healing 
process. 
B. Crosslinked Thermoplastics 
1. Experimental Procedure 
In the studies of Nguyen et al. [64] compact tension (CT) specimens were compres· 
sion moulded after careful drying in vacuo to remove any adsorbed water from the 
same SAN material described in Sect. III AI. To cross-link the samples, unbroken 
CT specimens, 26 x 26 x 3 mm3 in size, were imidiated with 'Y-rays at room tempera-
ture in vacuum-sealed Pyrex tube to a predetermined dose up to 800 Mrad (Sulzer 
source of 60 Co of 50 kCi). SAN belongs to the group of polymers which mainly 
undergo cross-linking during irradiation [75]. It is well known that reactive species, 
ions and free radicals, are still present in appreciable amounts after irradiation in 
polymeric materials. In order to eliminate any post-irradiation effect, all the samples 
were annealed under vacuum before measurements for several days at a temperature 
Tirr some 5 K above the glass transition temperature, Tg • The irradiated and annealed 
CT specimens were subsequently broken at room temperature and submitted to 
rehealing treatment as described before. 
In order to give a quantitative interpretation to the rehealing experiments, the 
polymer network must be well characterized particularly concerning the average 
distance between two points of cross-linking (see [64 D. 
2. Results of Mechanical Tests and Observations 
In the mechanical tests the fracture toughness, KJi , at crack initiation was thus 
measured on the rehealed CT samples as a function of contact time, th • The samples 
had been exposed to various degrees of cross-linking before the fracture and rehealing 
treatment. As shown in Figure 10.11, an initial linear dependence between the square 
ofKJi and t/l2 is observed both with cross-linked samples and non-irradiated samples. 
The linear increase of Kft is followed by a plateau region (K1p)' However, whereas 
Kft of an uncrosslinked sample reaches a plateau value only when the original frac-
ture toughness K1p is fully restored, the irradiated samples show a plateau at a value 
K1p smaller than Kfo (Fig. 10.11). The plateau value decreases with the dose received 
and there is a good correlation between K1p/Kfo and the square root of Mx (Table 
10.2).

Another striking fact in irradiated samples is the occurrence of a second recovery 
in fracture toughness which begins some minutes to one hour after the first plateau 
was reached. With the exception of the highest dose of 800 Mrad, the original frac-
ture toughness of the virgin material is eventually fully restored. The second recovery 
gives a straight line on a Ki vs. tl/ 2 plot, suggesting that a diffusion process is also 
responsible for this stage. The modest variation of the slopes for the initial recovery 
of fracture energy for all samples, regardless of the irradiation dose, indicates that 
cross-linkage before fracture influences little the kinetics of the first stage of reheal-
ing. 
3. Discussion 
Specimens which had received a dose of 200 Mrad after fracture did not show any 
measurable rehealing at 390 K, even after several days of penetration. The creation of 
a fracture surface seems to be necessary, therefore, before healing can occur in cross-
linked samples. It is known that the superficial layer next to the fracture surface is 
highly affected by the fracture process resulting in disentanglements of the molecular 
coils and chain scissions. In highly cross-linked polymers, chain scission will be preva-
lent, a fact which has been well documented in the past using ESR spectroscopy. The 
net effect in the used samples may well be the formation of two layers: a first layer 
(region A in Fig. 10.12) which consists essentially of free chain ends liberated by slip-
432 

III. Experimental Studies 
page from the matrix or created by breakage of segments between cross-linking 
points. The width of this layer can be estimated to be given by (~>1/2) the average 
distance between a chain end and the nearest cross-link along the chain. Adjacent 
to this region A of highly mobile chain ends one finds a region B (cf. Fig. 10.12) 
plastically deformed by the fracture event. In order to explain the second recovery 
it is required that this layer B also contains mobile chains but that their degree of 
mobility is much smaller than that of the A-chains. The lower mobility could be 
ascribed, for instance, to the greater length of the diffusing units and to the presence 
of cross-links in the matrix hindering the diffusion even of the uncross-linked chains. 
The two-layer model presented in Figure 10.12 certainly is a simple one and its 
limits will become apparent in the later discussions.

Fig. 10.12. Two-layer model of interdiffusion (from [64]) 
Magnitude of the Plateau Fracture Toughness K1p 
It is evident that only chains with their ends within a certain distance of the interface 
can diffuse easily across this interface and give effective contributions to the trans-
mission of mechanical stress [1-6]. In the present case a chain segment of molecular 
weight Ml may be considered which is attached to a cross-link point at a distance d1 
from the interface. If d1 is no larger than the radius of gyration, Rgl, then the end 
of this particular segment has a good chance to cross the interface. The width a of 
region A in Figure 10.12 should be taken, therefore, as the radius of gyration of the 
free chain segments found in region A. No matter whether those chain segments are 
liberated by slippage or created by breakage, they will have a number average molec-
ular weight ofMx /2. Ifit can be assumed that the free chain segments adopt a 
random coil configuration then the width a of the highly mobile layer will be given 
by:

For the molecular-weight independent term

0 one may take the value 
of 7 . 10-4 [nm2mol/g] determined by Kirste et al. [76]. During the healing treat-
ment a fracture energy GJi ~ Kfi will be built up first by interdiffusion of the mobile 
segments quite in analogy to the observations with uncross-linked polymers [1, 3, 4]; 
Kfi is, therefore, proportional to the distance of interpenetration. Once this distance 
has reached the value of a, the chain ends are completely interdiffused. At this 
moment one has: 
(10.18) 
where ao is the interpenetration distance necessary to establish the full strength of 
the virgin material. If ao is taken to be the radius of gyration of an average original 
molecule (Mno = 100000), one should have: 
(10.19) 
As is revealed by Table 10.2, there is indeed a good linear correspondence be-
tween Kfp and ~. 
The fact that at high degrees of cross-linking Kfi/Kfo is found 
slightly larger than JMx/200000 might be due to a non-random cutting of chain 
segments in the first fracture process and to an underestimation of Mx. In view of the 
very wide molecular weight distribution of the original sample this aspect will not be 
pursued any further.

The Second Recovery in Fracture Toughness and the Double Layer Model 
If chain ends were the only diffusing species, no increase in G1 should be observed 
after the plateau energy G1p was reached. The occurrence of the second recovery in 
fracture toughness on a long time scale indicates that less mobile species, able to give 
rise to additional entanglements, are' also present near the fracture surfaces. These 
may be formed from the remains of the broken network disentangled during the 
fracture. The presence of cross-link points lowers the diffusion coefficient so that 
linear or very lightly branched portions of these molecules start to intermingle only 
after complete interdiffusion of the dangling chain ends.

III. Experimental Studies 
Nguyen et al. [64] have presented a mathematical model with two diffusing 
layers to produce the two-5tep diffusion process mentioned above. The model is 
described by two diffusion coefficients: the self-diffusion coefficient DA of AL into 
AR, and the mutual diffusion coefficient DB of AL into BL (or AR into BR). The 
number of entanglements formed and thus Ge is assumed to be proportional to the 
number of species A and B which have diffused across the boundary at x = 0: 
a+b 
Ge(t) - f {CAL(X, t) + CBL(X, t) }dx. 
o 
(I 0.20) 
The movements of A and B will be correlated if the two species are bound to-
gether and belong to the same molecule. However, to make the mathematics more 
tractable, Nguyen et al. assumed that they are independent and that the diffusion of 
each species follows Fick's laws. This need not be true for the actual system under 
investigation,however, the Simplified model allowed to study some basic characteris-
tics of a two-step diffusion process. The best fit of this model to the experimental 
data for specimens irradiated to 200 Mrad is obtained with DA/DB = 12. The authors 
note , however, that the model used so far does not lead to a well pronounced plateau. 
It will be necessary, therefore, to consider two additional parameters: the oriented 
state of the fibrillar matter in the surface regions and the attachment of the dangling 
chain sections to the crosslinked network.

1. Experimental Results 
In analogy to the above observations it was expected that healing of compatible 
blends AB would occur through interdiffusion of the constituent molecules A and 
B across the interface. Depending on the differences in mobility of A and B it would 
have to be expected that the more mobiles species would first contribute to the 
healing process. 
In the experiments of Petrovska, Kausch et al. [6, 65, 66] blends of polystyrene 
(PS) as iiominant matrix with either a stiff component (poly-2,6-dimentyl-l ,4-phen-
ylene oxyde - PPO) or a mobile component (polyvinylmethyl ether - PVME) were 
used. As to be expected the glass transition temperature depended on the composi· 
tion of the blend. In each case the healing experiments were carried out at a healing 
temperature Th = Tg + 10 K. 
The increase in stress intensity factor with interdiffusion time th ("healing 
curves") are shown in Figures 10.13 and 10.14. It is readily seen that 
-
the presence of 5% PPO retards the healing process in its later stages 
-
retardation is the more effective the higher the molecular weight of the PPO 
-
in the 5% PPO blend there is an indication of a plateau region althought is not 
very pronounced 
-
healing of the PVME/PS blends is also slower (at 69°C) than healing of pure PS 
(at 117°C) 
435

-
PPO seems to slow down the healing more effectively than PVME (adding of 5% 
PPO ofMw = 16000 retards the healing about as much as adding 20% PVME of 
Mow = 90000, see Figures 10.13 and 10.14).

III. Experimental Studies 
2. Conclusions 
Analysis of the thermal, orientational, and viscoelastic behavior of all these blends 
shows that the thermally determined glass transition temperatures do not describe 
mechanically equivalent states. This is demonstrated by the two DSC curves obtained 
for pure PS and for a PS/pVME blend respectively (Fig. 10.15). In the case of pure 
PS a transition of notable magnitude is achieved within a temperature interval of 
22 K. In the blend the magnitude is comparable but the transition is spread out over 
an interval of 49 K. Whatever the way of determining a T g from DSC measurements, 
it indicates a reference temperature at which additional modes of vibration are 
liberated. These modes will aid the reptational diffusion of the chain molecules in the 
healing experiments as well as the stress- and entropy-relaxation processes studied by 
Lefebvre et al. [77-79] who investigated how the degree of segmental orientation 
obtained in hot-drawn PS blends decreased with increasing temperature and decreas-
ing rate of deformation.

Moreover, the rate ofloss of orientation ofPS after a fixed strain appears to be 
retarded by the presence ofPPO [77], and the stress relaxation response at Tg +40 °c 
is shifted to longer times by the presence ofPVME [78]. Thus, the PS orientation 
was enhanced by both the presence ofPPO [77] and PVME [78]. The authors ex-
plained this fact by the energetic interaction between the different components in 
the blend which is equivalent to increasing the intersegmental friction. The PVME 
chain segments did not show any orientation after hot drawing at T g + 11.5 K since 
their mobility was obviously suffiCiently large so as to relax any preferred orientation 
within the drawing period. 
437 

10. Fracture Mechanics Studies of Crack Healing 
The high mobility of the PVME chains did not manifest itself in the crack heal-
ing experiments. Neither a two-5tage healing process nor accelerated healing has been 
observed. The apparently contradictory results obtained by the different methods 
(DSC, degree of orientation of uniaxially stretched samples, viscoelastic behavior, 
mechanical effects of interdiffusion) is due to the fact that segmental motion and 
chain reptation obviously depend to a different degree on the form of the relaxation 
time spectrum and on which portion of the spectrum is being sampled by the experi-
ments. The difference between segmental and whole chain motion has long been 
ascribed to the retarding influence of entanglements. This concept was perhaps first 
given a molecular interpretaiton by the FLW modelling of pure polymer response by 
assuming that a Rouse treatment would apply [80]. Here one takes the monomeric 
friction factor to be the quantity which characterizes the mobility of short segments; 
it is this friction factor which locates the glass-to-rubber transition of a given polymer 
on the time scale, at a given temperature above Tg [81,82]. This factor would also 
characterize the steady flow viscosity of a polymer of M = 2 Me, measured at the 
same effective T - T g temperature. 
Above the entanglement point, the terminal relaxation zone was taken to be 
described by the same Rouse formulation, but with a viscosity characterized by the 
actual steady flow value for the polymer investigated. This corresponds to an in-
crease in the friction factor by the ratio (M/Me)2A . The manner in which the chains 
went from segmental response to total chain response was admittedly not clear, and 
so response in the plateau region was not well described [6]. 
Both points are now covered in the de Gennes, Doi-Edwards and Graessley treat-
ment of undiluted polymers [26-28]. The long time response of the "entangled" 
chain is controlled by the reptation along the tube (though with an M2 dependence 
leading to an M3 dependence of viscosity), but motion is allowed within the tube and 
is specifically modeled as "Rouse-like motion" at short time. These two parts of the 
modern theory therefore correspond formally to the early FLW assumption of the 
applicability of the Rouse treatment. 
For present purposes then, segmental motion is governed by the monomeric 
friction factor. However, in a widely spread transition (PS/PVME) the long range 
modes ofPVME chain motion, essential for reptation, are still blocked at Tg + 10 K. 
Consequently one may find notable segmental relaxation well before a displacement 
of whole chains. 
It has to be taken into account that the addition of small amounts of a "narrow-
transition material" (PS) to a "wide-transition material" (PVME) may widen the 
transition even further. An excellent demonstration of this (unexpected) fact has 
been given by Brekner, Cantow and Schneider [84] whose results are reproduced in 
Figure 10.16. The addition of small amounts of (any molecular weight) PS to PVME 
widens the relaxation time spectrum. 
It is also of interest to consider the location of the healing time on the time scale 
provided by the stress relaxation measurements. For this purpose one notes the heal-
ing time of pure PS at T = Tg +11.5 °c to be 44 = 256 min. At Tg +40 °c, this cor-
responds to 100.7 sec. as calculated from the WLF equation using C1 = 13.7 deg. and 
C2 = 50 deg [83]. This is just into the terminal zone as seen in the stress relaxation 
modulus data of Faivre, Jasse and Monnerie (Fig. 7 of ref. 78b). Hence, the healing

time is evidently relative to the longest relaxation time, or tube renewal time. The 
shortes measurable healing time is about five minutes because of the time required 
for sample warm-up and cool-down. This corresponds to about 10-1 sec. at 
Tg +40 °c, which is midway along the plateau. Thus, even at the shortest healing 
time available, all Rouse submolecules shorter than Me will have relaxed out. 
D. General Conclusions Derived from Crack Healing Studies 
So far, the most interesting results have been obtained from glassy amorphous 
polymers such as PMMA, SAN, or PS, used in the form of homo polymers or blends 
(PMMAjSAN; PSjPPO; PSjPVME). In these cases "interfacial strength" (as measured 
through KIi) was gradually restored with healing time th. The most remarkable fact 
certainly is that Kli increases with (th)I/4; this seems to be brought about by the 
strong dependence of the fracture energy Gc of glassy polymers on fibril stability 
which, in turn, depends on the degree of reentanglement around the former inter-
facial zone. The assumption that reentanglement increases with (th)I/2 would then 
tie in a straightforward manner chain diffusion to healing. 
The available information on the molecular weight dependence of healing [47, 
68, 70] suggests that chain diffusion occurs through reptation. However, more ex-
tensive studies of this aspect would be welcome in order to better separate the molec-
ular weight dependence of the calculated diffusion coefficient from other effects 
caused for instance by changes of T g and Kro with Mw or by a non-even distribution 
of chain ends in the interfacial zone. 
A final remark concerns semicrystalline polymers. Studies undertaken in Lau-
sanne [85] with HDPE, PA6 and PVC or PVCjPMMA blends have consistently failed 
to achieve gradual healing, even when using rather elevated temperatures. In these 
cases, the existence of a network with crystalline junction points [86] seems to ef-
fectively prevent sufficient interdiffusion of chain molecules and thus application of 
the previously described "static" crack healing method based on fracture mechanics 
specimens.
