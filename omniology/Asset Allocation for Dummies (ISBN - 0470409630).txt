About the Authors
Jerry A. Miccolis: Jerry’s clients, colleagues, and friends were caught a 
bit off-guard when, in 2003, he decided to change careers, from enterprise 
risk management to personal wealth management. But, toward the end of 
his 30-year stint in the actuarial and risk-management fi elds (including 25 
years with the international management consulting fi rm Towers Perrin, 
where he eventually led the global enterprise risk management practice), 
he had already nearly achieved the two most sought-after certifi cations of 
his chosen second career — Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) and Certifi ed 
Financial Planner (CFP). He’s never been happier, helping real people secure 
their fi nancial future. A senior fi nancial advisor at, and co-owner of, Brinton 
Eaton Wealth Advisors in Madison, New Jersey, Jerry adds his CFA and CFP 
designations to his credentials as a fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society 
(FCAS) and member of the American Academy of Actuaries (MAAA). Jerry, 
who is also a member of the Financial Planning Association (FPA) and the 
New York Society of Security Analysts (NYSSA), holds a BS in mathematics 
from Drexel University.
The coauthor of Enterprise Risk Management: Trends and Emerging Practices 
(The Institute of Internal Auditors Research Foundation) and Enterprise Risk 
Management: An Analytic Approach (Tillinghast-Towers Perrin), Jerry has 
chaired numerous professional committees and is a widely quoted author 
and speaker on the subject of strategic risk management, investment 
management, and their interrelationship. Jerry has been published in profes-
sional journals (Strategy & Leadership, Operational Risk, Risk Management, 
Institutional Investor, CFO Magazine, Investment Advisor, and Financial 
Planning) and in the mainstream media (The New York Times, The Wall Street 
Journal, The Baltimore Sun, MarketWatch, MSN Money, and Marketwire). He 
has appeared as an expert commentator on CBS Radio, ABC TV, and IRMI.
com, the Web site of the International Risk Management Institute.
All of this, though, is what Jerry does between senior softball games, his real 
passion. There, Jerry plays third base and shortstop and bats much lower in 
the lineup than he thinks he should.
You can read more of his and his colleagues’ investment advice at www.
brintoneaton.com (click Research Corner) and about his softball addiction at 
www.casact.org/newsletter/index.cfm?fa=viewart&id=5639.

Dorianne R. Perrucci: Dorianne jokes that she’s still looking for the 13¢ 
that caused her fi rst checking account to bounce. Dorianne, who has writ-
ten for Newsweek, The New York Times, Mediaweek, and TheStreet.com, 
began reporting about personal fi nance and investing in 1998 for Jane Bryant 
Quinn’s Washington Post column. Previously, she reported for a daily news-
paper, wrote a political column for a U.S. senator, and produced articles 
and books for several of the country’s leading charities, including Covenant 
House, the Times Square shelter for homeless and runaway youth. She cur-
rently edits and collaborates on investing books, including: The Demise of the 
Dollar . . . and Why It’s Great for Your Investments, by Addison Wiggin (Wiley 
Publishing); I.O.U.S.A., One Nation, Under Stress, In Debt, with Addison Wiggin 
and Kate Incontrera (Wiley Publishing); The Ultimate Depression Survival 
Guide, by Martin D. Weiss (Wiley Publishing); and the AARP Crash Course in 
Creating Retirement Income, by Julie Jason (Sterling Publishing).
Dorianne, a graduate of Marquette University’s School of Journalism, is a 
member of the American Society of Journalists and Authors and the New York 
Financial Writers Association. When she isn’t busy explaining the consumer’s 
next investment challenge, she continues to search for that missing 13¢.

Dedication
To you, the average investor, who is curious enough to wonder if a For 
Dummies book can really help you get superior investment results, like the 
pros. Asset allocation, which begins with determining the right (and the 
right-size) baskets for your investment “eggs,” isn’t exactly a piece of cake, 
but we promise, if you’re determined to learn the recipe, we’ll make the pro-
cess a very satisfying one for you.
Acknowledgments
It takes a village to write a book. Okay, not original, but true — you need a 
tribe of supporters to make it safely to the “effi cient frontier” of investing.
Jerry Miccolis thanks his coauthor, Dorianne, for her contagious enthusiasm 
and offbeat sense of humor — and for constantly nagging him to “Keep 
it accessible!” Numerous editorial suggestions from his Brinton Eaton 
colleagues — Bob DiQuollo, Ben Jacoby, Jeremy Welther, Jerv Brinton, Nick 
Laverghetta, Ellen Clawans, and Abby Scandlen — vastly improved the fi nal 
manuscript. Special mention to Marina Goodman, who seemed to take 
particular pleasure in offering blistering critiques of early drafts but also 
made excellent original contributions and helped prepare many of the 
exhibits and examples. They and the rest of the staff — Colleen Betzler, Dave 
Hill, Eric Mancini, Doris Merrick, Adrian Fedorkiw, Kim Dibenedetto, and 
Pam Trunfi o — graciously picked up the slack for Jerry at the offi ce. Most 
important, Jerry thanks Marcella, his wife and muse, for her unfailing 
support, encouragement, and understanding, during the nights and weekends 
he devoted to this book.
Dorianne Perrucci thanks Jerry, for his patience in explaining technical 
jargon and would like to ask him to explain perfect negative correlation one 
more time. She thanks her agent, Marilyn Allen, and the entire amazing For 
Dummies team, especially Acquisitions Editor Stacy Kennedy, who actually 
wanted to publish a book on asset allocation; Elizabeth Kuball, project editor 
extraordinaire; and Dummifi er Brittain Phillips, whose mysterious ability to 
rework text works wonders. Dorianne is also grateful for her family and a 
host of colleagues and friends for continuing to cheer her on.

Introduction
You don’t need to be an expert analyst, a star stock-picker, or a rocket 
scientist to have better investment results than most other investors. 
You just need to allocate your assets in the right way, and have the convic-
tion to stick with that allocation. Talk about empowering!
The big secret behind asset allocation — the secret that most sophisticated 
investors know and use to their benefit — is that it’s really not all that hard 
to do.
If you follow asset allocation’s systematic, top-down approach to investing, 
you’ll be more likely to arrive at your financial destination safely, and with a 
lot more success and portfolio stability than if you try a bottom-up approach 
like the stock-pickers and market-timers employ (generally with lousy 
results). You’ll reach your long-term goals more reliably — and that’s a huge 
comfort during times of market volatility, when a charging bull market can 
turn overnight into a snarling bear market.
That’s not to say that sticking with asset allocation is the easiest thing in 
the world. It can be challenging, and it requires discipline, courage, and a 
little humility. At times, you’ll be bucking prevailing market trends and have 
to turn a deaf ear to pundits, friends, and family, who will think you’re nuts 
when you sell off your winners and buy losers to balance your portfolio. 
That’ll take some intestinal fortitude. Some of asset allocation’s key concepts 
can seem counterintuitive in other ways, too — but if you stick with the pro-
gram, you’ll get more out of your money than you ever thought you could.
By following the asset allocation approach, you’ll
 
✓ Help insulate your portfolio against market fluctuations, the overall 
economy, the effects of inflation, and more.
 
✓ Make smarter decisions than the vast majority of individual investors 
out there — and do better than most of them over the long term.
 
✓ Make fewer mistakes with your portfolio. Diversifying your investments, 
choosing assets that don’t always move up or down at the same time, 
and rebalancing your portfolio opportunistically will make it harder for 
you to stumble.

In short, you’ll be a winner in the only monetary game that counts — 
enabling your life’s dreams by protecting your financial future.
About This Book
There are several books about asset allocation out there, most of which are 
written for investment experts. This isn’t one of those books. Sure, Jerry is 
a wealth-management expert with tons of asset allocation experience and 
Dorianne is a financial journalist, but we pride ourselves on our love for 
explaining the mysteries of investing to average investors like you. In this 
book, we make the often overly technical information about asset allocation 
accessible, whether you’re a beginner or you have a little investing experi-
ence under your belt. We had fun writing this book together, and we hope 
you have fun reading it and using its contents to help you reach your finan-
cial goals.
One of the ways that we make the information contained in this book easier 
for a beginning investor to digest is the use of plenty of charts and tables. 
When you encounter these helpful tools, take a moment to size them up. 
You’ll be rewarded, and you may be surprised by how much information you 
pick up right away. These illustrations just may be the handle you need to get 
a nice, firm grip on asset allocation.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate your way through this book, we use the following 
conventions:
 
✓ We use italics when we define new terms that probably aren’t familiar 
to you.
 
✓ We use monofont for Web addresses. Some Web addresses may need 
to break across two lines of text. If that happened when the book was 
printed, just type in exactly what you see in this book — we didn’t add 
any extra characters (such as hyphens).
 
✓ We discuss several different types of investment returns throughout 
this book, and what they mean for you. But when we use the word return 
without further modification, we’re referring to total nominal return, 
which combines income and growth unadjusted for inflation. (You can 
read all the details in Chapter 2.)

 Introduction
What You’re Not to Read
This book is a reference, which means you don’t have to read it from begin-
ning to end (any more than you have to read a dictionary from beginning to 
end to get what you need from it). If you’re in a hurry, you can even skip cer-
tain pieces of information and still get the gist of what you need. Here’s what 
you can safely skip:
 
✓ Anything marked with a Technical Stuff icon: For more on this icon, 
see the “Icons Used in This Book” section, later in this Introduction.
 
✓ Text in gray boxes, which are known as sidebars: Sidebars contain 
interesting — but not essential — information.
 
✓ The copyright page: Sure, the publisher’s attorneys’ feelings will be 
hurt, but you can skip the fine print without losing out on anything 
important. Shh! We won’t tell.
Foolish Assumptions
When we began writing this book, we started with a few assumptions about 
you, our esteemed reader:
 
✓ You have a good idea of what you want to accomplish financially, but 
you don’t know exactly how to get there.
 
✓ You’ve done a bit of investing, but not a lot, and you’d like to benefit 
from what the experts know about asset allocation.
 
✓ You know there has to be a better, more reliable, route to investment 
success than listening to all the talking heads in the financial media or 
chasing the latest hot stock tip.
 
✓ You’re wondering if it’s possible for anyone to make this stuff easier to 
understand — or even fun.
How This Book Is Organized
This book discusses asset allocation in what we believe is a natural, logical 
order. You can read the chapters that way, if you want. But this also a true 
For Dummies book, so feel free to bounce around and read a little here and 
a little there, depending on what you’re interested in and what you want to 
understand first.

Assett Allocation For Dummies 
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret 
Recipe for Asset Allocation
In Part I, we lay out the basics behind the asset allocation recipe, which 
begins with diversifying the assets you choose for your portfolio. But diversi-
fication isn’t all there is to asset allocation. In order for you to figure out your 
ideal asset allocation, you need to assess the level of risk you’re comfortable 
taking in exchange for the return you’re seeking. In other words, how much 
are you looking to make, and how much risk are you willing to take on?
We also look at the many types of asset classes you can choose, ranging from 
standard choices (cash, fixed income, equities) to alternative choices (such 
as real estate and commodities). After you’ve got a grip on the various types 
of asset classes, then you’re ready to make some specific choices like stocks, 
bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and the like.
We tell you how you can avoid costly mistakes, and protect your portfolio 
from volatility, by choosing investments that don’t always move up or down 
at the same time. Finally, we fill you in on portfolio rebalancing, which is 
overlooked by most investors but embraced by the pros, who know it can be 
used to control risk and generate extra return.
Part II: Getting Started
You need to nail down your own personal investment strategy, and in this 
part we walk you through an exercise that helps to define your parameters. 
Those parameters include your investment horizon, risk tolerance, portfolio 
constraints (for example, for religious or personal reasons, you may not want 
to buy stocks that invest in alcohol or gambling), tax situation, and special 
circumstances, such as protecting your assets from creditors or your estate 
from taxes.
Then you’re ready to develop your investment strategy and figure out what 
you need to sustain your lifetime cash flow. We know it sounds like a lot of 
big decisions, but we break it all down for you. If you’re going to need $50,000 
a year (in today’s dollars), starting in five years, and you have $350,000 
now, how are you going to get from here to there? Do you know your cur-
rent assets and liabilities? Your current and future sources of income and 
expenses? And finally, how do you tie all this information together in a mean-
ingful and useful framework, leading to the asset allocation that’s just right 
for you? We answer those questions, and many more, in this part. We also 
give a kick-start to establishing your own unique asset allocation by looking 
at some valuable sample allocations.

 Introduction
Part III: Building and Maintaining 
Your Portfolio
This part shows you how to fill your asset allocation baskets with specific 
investments of various types. Wondering what specific investments you 
should buy? We tell you. Don’t know how to buy those specific investments? 
We fill you in. Worried about the many types of fees and expenses that can 
creep up on you? We let you know how and where to look for them.
Because most investors have several accounts (one or more taxable 
accounts, individual retirement accounts for husband and wife, and so on), 
we also match the right investments with the right accounts, to exploit the 
tax characteristics of the different accounts and avoid creating unnecessary 
tax bites. Then we get into the details of portfolio rebalancing (introduced 
in Part I) so you can get extra return if you rebalance faithfully. Finally, we 
explain how to measure your results and compare your portfolio’s perfor-
mance with the appropriate external benchmarks, so you know how well 
you’re doing.
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics
In this part, we take a close look at alternative investments (real estate and 
commodities, for example) and the wonderful things they can do for your 
portfolio. Then we point out how you can gain the kind of tax knowledge 
that’ll help you keep more of your well-deserved gains. After all, there’s no 
sense in giving away too much of your money in taxes when it can be avoided 
with some savvy planning. We also identify the situations that should prompt 
you to revisit — and validate or revise — your long-term asset allocation plan.
If you need help figuring out some (or all) of the asset allocation process, we 
help you look over the choices of financial advisors available, and tell you 
the importance of paying attention to their credentials. (Hint: Some of those 
credentials are meaningless and/or misleading!) We also discuss how much 
these experts get paid — and by whom — and how to make sure they’re 
working in your best interests, not their own.
Part V: The Part of Tens
If you like top-ten lists, this part is for you! The three chapters in this part 
help you jump-start your asset allocation with easy-to-digest (and interesting) 
information. Our list of ten important asset classes with their historical rates 

6
Assett Allocation For Dummies 
of return is a valuable reference you can use on its own, or as a tool to come 
back to time and again as you read other chapters. We also point out ten 
common mistakes that prevent investors from becoming good asset alloca-
tors. When it comes to bang for your buck, this part scores, well, a perfect ten.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, we use icons (little pictures in the margin) to draw 
your attention to certain kinds of information. Here’s what the icons mean:
 
When you see a Tip icon, read it to find a nugget of asset allocation wisdom 
that you can apply as you carry out your investing strategy.
 
Anything flagged with a Remember icon is especially important to your under-
standing of one of asset allocation’s many facets. This is the stuff you don’t 
want to forget.
 
The Warning icon flags a potential problem or pitfall that could give you fits if 
you weren’t aware of it. If you’re into dodging bullets, stay on the lookout for 
Warning icons.
 
The Technical Stuff icon appears next to material that can be a bit tricky. 
You may not be able to pick up on it right away, and it may not be absolutely 
critical to your understanding of the topic being explained, but if you can 
manage to tackle the information, it’ll give you an even firmer grasp of asset 
allocation . . . or at least impress your friends.
Where to Go from Here
You can tackle this book in several ways. If you’re a beginner, you may want 
to read Chapter 1 to get the big picture, and then scan through the begin-
nings of the other chapters to find the inroad that interests you the most. If 
you really want to know what makes asset allocation such a great strategy, 
check out the chapters in Part I. There you’ll find some of the background 
material that’ll help you to understand why asset allocation makes so much 
sense. Or maybe you’ve heard a little bit about all the different types of 
assets out there, but you want to read a lot more. If that’s the case, flip to 
Part III. There you can find out what’s on offer and what makes the most 
sense for your portfolio.

 Introduction
If you’ve already wrapped your brain around investment and asset alloca-
tion basics, it may be time for you to turn to Part IV, where we discuss a few 
more-advanced topics like alternative investments and tax strategies. This 
part also includes a very helpful chapter that tells you how to find the best 
financial advisor for you.
No matter where you start, don’t feel compelled to read this book straight 
through, from beginning to end. We wrote the book so you could start any-
where, and we provide lots of cross-references to point you to other places in 
the book where you can find information you may need to better understand 
what we’re talking about. Whichever way makes sense to you — dig in, you 
(and your portfolio) will reap the rewards!

Discovering the 
Not-So-Secret Recipe 
for Asset Allocation

In this part . . .
W
e start by looking at the big picture of asset 
allocation — from what seems like 30,000 feet. But 
as we talk about risk and return, and review the various 
asset classes and how to mix them together in the right 
proportions, you begin to focus in and see how getting 
that mix right is the single most important investment 
decision you can make. We also introduce portfolio 
rebalancing, which is a process overlooked by most 
investors but championed by the pros, to control risk 
and generate extra return.

Chapter 1
Understanding Asset Allocation
In This Chapter
▶ Appreciating the importance of asset allocation
▶ Discovering how to apply asset allocation to your portfolio
▶ Getting started with building your portfolio
▶ Going beyond the basics to get the most out of asset allocation
P
sst! Want to know the trick to making a killing in investments? One that 
offers fat financial returns with little or no risk? Sadly (and as you’d 
probably guess), there’s no such thing.
Want to know how you can score great long-term investment results while 
minimizing unnecessary risk and costs? In that case, you’ve come to the right 
place! With the right asset allocation, you can enjoy substantial investment 
returns with the lowest possible amounts of risk and cost.
Asset allocation, in simplest terms, is deciding how to divvy up your invest-
ment dollars among various types of assets. More fully, it’s a comprehensive, 
coherent, top-down, strategic approach to investing that has well-established 
science and years of real-life superior investment results to back it up. In 
other words, it’s bona fide, and when it comes to investing, nothing consis-
tently beats it.
In this chapter (and throughout this book), we show you how and why asset 
allocation works and, perhaps more important, how it can work for you. We 
take you step by step through the time-tested approach to investing that the 
most successful professionals use. We explain how you can reap the benefits 
of rebalancing, which is the closest thing to a free lunch you’ll ever find in 
investing. And we show you how to do all this and save on your taxes, too!
In true For Dummies fashion, Chapter 1 is a microcosm of the book that fol-
lows. Think of this chapter as a bird’s-eye view of asset allocation. We hit all 
the high points, and, as we go, we point you to the chapters you can visit to 
get a more detailed treatment of each topic.

Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
Figuring Out Why Asset Allocation 
Is So Important
When it comes to your investments, what’s more important than asset alloca-
tion? In our opinion — and in the opinion of most every reputable investment 
expert — nothing.
In this section, we clue you in on why asset allocation is so important, using 
a couple different perspectives. First, we use the infamous story of Enron to 
show you the terrific power of diversification, which is one of several fun-
damental aspects of asset allocation. Then, to give you a feel for asset allo-
cation’s other key aspects, we use the rest of the section to take a broader 
view, exploring what independent studies have to say about the role of asset 
allocation in driving investment success.
Encapsulating the Enron story
Here’s the short version of the Enron story: Beginning in the early 1930s as 
a modest oil pipeline company, Enron grew over the years, through mergers 
and acquisitions of other energy companies. By the late 1990s, it was very 
aggressive in energy trading and other complicated financial engineering ven-
tures. (Don’t worry about the details — it was really, really complex stuff.) 
Enron had, in fact, become an industry leader and business-school case 
study in the creative use of these sophisticated financial arrangements. By 
early 2001, Enron had grown to be the seventh largest company in the United 
States based on revenue and had been named America’s Most Innovative 
Company for the sixth year in a row by Fortune magazine. It was also on 
Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to Work for in America list in 2000.
Then the bottom fell out. Before the end of 2001, Enron was bankrupt. The 
cause was accounting fraud. The lengths to which Enron’s executives went 
to conceal their illegal activities were epic in their ingenuity and complex-
ity. That’s the white-collar-crime part of the story that was splashed all over 
news headlines for months. But that’s not the worst part.
The worst part — and the part most relevant to you, the average investor — 
was this: Even while the Enron executives were perpetrating their fraud, they 
were encouraging their own employees to stake their financial futures on the 
company. In addition to offering an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), 
Enron urged its employees to invest in company stock in their retirement 
plans. The company’s matching contributions to its employees’ 401(k) plans 
were made exclusively in Enron stock. And, in the fall of 2001, as its fraudu-
lent financials were unraveling, Enron made it impossible for its employees to 
switch out of Enron stock in their retirement plans.

13
 Chapter 1: Understanding Asset Allocation
It was a real tragedy for thousands of Enron employees, who watched help-
lessly as their retirement funds and personal financial futures evaporated. 
Sadly, it happened because Enron led them to violate one of the immutable 
laws of sound investing: Never, ever put too many of your eggs in one basket.
 
Keep your investments diversified! Don’t invest too much in any one security, 
especially your employer’s stock. (Enough of your financial future is already 
tied to the company’s well being.) As a general rule, don’t invest more than 5 
percent of your invested assets in any one stock.
So that’s the enduring lesson of Enron for investors: Diversify, diversify, 
diversify! Asset allocation begins with portfolio diversification, but as we 
describe later, it goes much further.
Exploiting the 90 percent solution
Quick — what decision will have the biggest impact on your investment 
results? It’s not stock picking (chasing so-called “hot” tips on individual securi-
ties, usually without regard to a coherent portfolio strategy) or market timing 
(trying to beat the market by timing when to get in and get out of it). The lion’s 
share of your performance will be determined by your asset allocation — how 
you divide your money among various types of assets.
 
According to several well-regarded academic studies over the years, over 90 
percent of the difference in returns among various investment portfolios is 
explained by one thing: asset allocation. That fact alone should lead you to 
a profound revelation: You should spend the vast majority of your investing 
time and effort on getting your asset allocation right. Nothing else matters 
nearly as much.
Separately, study after study has shown that investors who take other 
approaches, such as market timing or stock picking, consistently underper-
form the market averages over the long term.
But if those types of dubious investment strategies have been shown to fizzle 
out in the long term, why do you see so much newsprint and radio and TV 
airtime devoted to them? Why are most of the stories about market timing 
and stock picking instead of asset allocation? Because those other things are 
sexy. They’re exciting. And they play to our baser instincts — our desire to 
jump into the next great low-effort, get-rich-quick scheme. By contrast, asset 
allocation is a steady and reliable approach that takes some thought and 
consideration. In other words, it’s relatively unexciting. But it’s the investing 
approach the pros have used for decades to get better long-term results than 
those other guys. (Check out the “Appreciating the science of asset alloca-
tion” sidebar in this chapter to find out why.) Asset allocation gives you a 
much better chance of ending up with more money in the long run. How’s 
that for unexciting?

14
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
And here’s the best news of all: You don’t have to be a financial genius or 
fork over a huge wad of cash to a world-class broker or an elite hedge-fund 
manager to reap the rewards of asset allocation. You just need to understand 
the basics and figure out how to apply those basics to your personal invest-
ment situation.
The rest of this chapter shows you how to do just that.
Uncovering the Basics 
of Asset Allocation
Successful asset allocation involves a few basic concepts. These main compo-
nents, which form the centerpiece of Part I, are as follows:
 
✓ Understanding the fundamental relationship and trade-off between 
investment risk and return
 
✓ Selecting the asset classes that are right for you
 
✓ Determining the right mix of those asset classes to achieve your 
objectives
 
✓ Rebalancing your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired mix
We take you step by step through these basics in this section.
Appreciating the science of asset allocation
Sometimes, asset allocation and its associated 
activities seem counterintuitive. It may make you 
uncomfortable, particularly when those around 
you are doing the opposite of what you’re doing 
(buying when you’re selling, selling when you’re 
buying, avoiding investments you’re embracing, 
and so on). At those times, reassure yourself 
with some knowledge of the science behind 
what makes asset allocation work.
One of the principles of asset allocation is 
the reduction of portfolio volatility. Excessive 
volatility can cost you real dollars because of 
a phenomenon called risk drag. As we explain 
in Chapter 2, risk drag eats away at your invest-
ment return over time. By combining the right 
investments in the right proportions, you can 
tame risk drag.
Finding those investments and determining 
those proportions is also a matter of some sci-
ence. The trick is to find investments that don’t 
correlate very well with each other (meaning, 
they don’t all go up or down at the same time). 
Investments like that may seem unappealing 
to new investors, but those in the know realize 
that they can use them to create real portfolio 
magic, as we show you in Chapter 4.

15
 Chapter 1: Understanding Asset Allocation
The complete asset allocation picture contains other less basic features 
(developing your investment strategy in the context of your long-term finan-
cial plan, filling your portfolio with the right securities, putting those securi-
ties into the right accounts to get the best after-tax results, measuring your 
performance, and so on), which we cover a little later in this chapter.
Balancing risk and return
Risk and return are the two central concepts underlying all of investing. To 
enjoy a return on your investments, you have to take some risk. Although 
return (your percentage gain) can be measured with objective precision, risk 
is a very personal, subjective concept. Whether you define your own concept 
of risk as uncertainty, instability, the chance of losing money, lack of peace of 
mind, or in some other manner, one thing is generally true: The more return 
you want, the more risk you have to accept. As you consider the length of 
time over which you’ll be investing, your ideas about risk and return may 
change in surprising ways. You can read all about these concepts, including 
the all-important trade-off between risk and return, in Chapter 2.
The risk-return trade-off has been the subject of much academic study. One 
of the really useful tools that has emerged from all that study is the efficient 
frontier. It might sound a little cold and complicated, but it’s really a simple 
visual device that’ll help you reach a deep understanding of asset allocation’s 
core concepts and guide you toward the asset allocation that’s right for you. 
We show you how to use the efficient frontier in Chapter 2.
Selecting your asset classes
An early step in asset allocation is determining the asset classes (groups of 
investments with similar characteristics) that you want in your portfolio. In 
Chapter 3, we take you on a tour of the asset classes at your disposal. There 
are traditional classes, such as cash, fixed-income investments (including 
bonds and bond funds), and equities (including stocks and stock funds). We 
cover issues such as maturity, creditworthiness, and taxability of the various 
types of fixed-income investments, as well as the size, style, and sector of 
your equity investment choices.
We also dig into so-called alternative investments, which can help stabilize 
your portfolio. These include real estate, hard assets (such as commodities), 
and hedge funds. And we discuss going global with international investments 
in all these areas.
 
Many of the asset classes you can invest in may have unique and important 
roles to play in your portfolio, so it’s wise for you to get to know them as well 
as you can.

16
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
Determining your asset mix
In addition to knowing what kinds of assets are available for you to include 
in your portfolio, you also need to understand how to mix those assets in the 
right proportions.
To best appreciate how the right mix works for you, and to help you find 
your ideal mix, you really need to understand correlation (the way your 
various asset classes behave in relation to each other). We can’t stress 
the importance of correlation enough, and you can dive into the details in 
Chapter 4.
The holy grail of investing is a set of asset classes that have perfect negative 
correlation with each other, meaning that one zigs when the other zags (that 
is, if one moves up, the other moves down by the same amount, at the same 
time). Asset classes like that can be combined to create a portfolio that has 
absolutely no risk! But, as you may imagine, perfect negative correlation — 
like perfection of any kind — is impossible to find in real life (with the excep-
tion of chocolate peanut butter ice cream), so you try to get as close as you 
can. You can reduce risk drag (see Chapter 2) considerably, and thereby 
improve your portfolio’s return, just by properly mixing assets that have pos-
itive, but weak, correlation. In Chapter 4, we show you how to let these ideas 
guide your decisions on asset mix.
 
In determining how much of an asset class to include in your portfolio, keep in 
mind that the characteristics and behavior of any one asset class on its own 
are irrelevant. What really counts is the behavior of the entire portfolio when 
that asset class is added to it. This is a guiding principle of asset allocation. 
(We cover how to put this principle to practical use in Chapter 8.)
Rebalancing your asset mix
Setting up your asset mix isn’t the end of asset allocation. The financial mar-
kets, where investors buy and sell securities, will see to it that different asset 
classes inside your portfolio will grow at different rates. Over time, your port-
folio will, therefore, drift away from the mix you set up so carefully. When that 
happens, you’ll need to occasionally buy and sell assets to get your portfolio 
back to your target allocation. That process is called rebalancing.
Rebalancing on the right schedule will do more than keep your portfolio 
faithful to its asset allocation. It’ll help you rein in risk. More surprisingly, it’ll 
also help you generate extra return seemingly out of thin air! That’s what we 
mean when we say that rebalancing is the closest thing to a free lunch you’ll 
ever find in investing.

17
 Chapter 1: Understanding Asset Allocation
Rebalancing sounds great, right? It really is, and you can read up on the 
details in Chapter 5. Rebalancing forces you to buy low and sell high. It allows 
you to exploit a phenomenon called volatility pumping to get you that extra 
return. But you have to have the fortitude to do it correctly, because it’ll 
require you to do things at times that are contrary to what others around you 
who haven’t read up on asset allocation are doing. But the payoff is worth it: 
Rebalancing will reduce your risk and ramp up your long-term returns.
Getting Started with Your 
Investment Strategy
As you can read in the previous section, Part I of this book is all about 
understanding the basic tenets of asset allocation. That’s crucial stuff, and 
it’s tough to do much with asset allocation if you don’t have a grasp on the 
basics. But when you’ve wrapped your brain around them, how do you make 
those basics work for you? The next step is developing a well-considered 
investment strategy, and that’s what you can discover in Part II.
As we outline in Chapter 6, your strategy should lay out the following 
parameters:
 
✓ Your investment horizon: This is the length of time you expect to be 
invested. It’s critically important to get this right, and here’s a big clue: 
It may be longer than you think.
 
✓ Your return objectives: This isn’t the return you want, but the return 
you need. We help you determine your return objectives when we dis-
cuss your long-term financial plan, later in this section.
 
✓ Your risk tolerance: However you define your subjective concept of 
risk, there’s likely a point — a limit — beyond which you’re just not 
comfortable going. We show you how to use this tolerance level to find 
your best-performing asset allocation.
 
✓ Your portfolio constraints: You may have certain investments, or even 
whole asset classes, that you just won’t consider for personal reasons 
(for example, maybe you won’t invest in a tobacco company because 
your father died of lung cancer, or you won’t invest in a beer company 
because drinking is against your religious beliefs) or certain holdings 
that you just won’t let go of (maybe you just can’t bring yourself to sell 
the stock your grandma left to you). We explain how to deal with these 
limitations.

18
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
 
✓ Your tax situation: Your tax bracket may lead you to consider certain 
asset classes that wouldn’t make sense for you otherwise. We discuss 
how you can exploit this situation.
 
✓ Your special circumstances: If you have an unusual exposure to lawsuits 
(due to your profession, perhaps) or an overriding desire to protect your 
assets from estate taxes, we describe how you might make certain adjust-
ments to your portfolio.
You should set these investment strategy parameters after looking at your 
long-term financial plan. We show how to do that in Chapter 7, where we 
introduce another useful tool, your Lifetime Cash-flow Projection (LCP). 
We’re not going to lie: Developing your LCP is the most work we ask you to 
do in this book. Compared to some of the other tasks, it can feel like heavy 
lifting. You don’t have to do it if you don’t want. We’re not saying you can’t 
get yourself a decent asset allocation without an LCP, but we really don’t 
think you should cut corners when it comes to your financial future. In addi-
tion to helping you derive the asset allocation that’s just right for you, your 
LCP also allows you to test any number of critical “what if” scenarios as 
you go through life. We also advise you to document your investment in an 
Investment Policy Statement, just as the pros do.
Speaking of the pros, in Chapter 8, we show you how they would use all this 
information to derive an ideal asset allocation for you. We show you what 
you can learn from them to do it yourself. We also give you a head start by 
showing some sample asset allocations and taking you step by step through 
an example with a fictional couple, John and Jane Doe.
Building Your Portfolio and Keeping 
It True to Your Long-Term Goal
After you’ve settled on your asset allocation (you’ve assigned target percent-
ages to all the asset classes you want in your portfolio), then what do you 
do? That’s when it’s time to do some shopping. You have to buy securities to 
put in your portfolio to achieve the allocation you decided on. When you do 
that, you have to figure out in which of your various investment accounts to 
buy the securities. (You keep your securities in accounts, and determining 
which accounts should hold which securities is an important process.)
But if you’re smart, you won’t stop there. You’ll diligently monitor your port-
folio, so that, among other things, you’ll know when you need to rebalance. 
And finally, you’ll want to measure your portfolio’s results in a meaningful 
way to gauge whether all this is working the way you want. We cover all these 
things, in turn, in this section and throughout Part III.

19
 Chapter 1: Understanding Asset Allocation
Selecting securities
Within each of the asset classes we outline in Chapter 3, there are scads of 
securities you can buy to represent the asset class. With thousands of possi-
bilities, how do you choose? In Chapter 9, we take you on a tour of the securi-
ties available to you. There are stocks and bonds, of course. There are also 
mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, and we explain why we generally 
prefer the latter over the former. We also discuss index funds and actively 
managed funds, annuities, options, structured notes, exchange-traded notes, 
and others.
To keep your asset allocation in ship shape, you’ll want to buy different secu-
rities in different circumstances. Sounds logical enough, but what’s the best 
way for you to actually buy securities? You have a couple of broad choices: 
You can buy them on your own or buy them through a broker. There are 
advantages and disadvantages to each approach, and we cover all the rel-
evant information in Chapter 9. You can also, if you dare, use shorting and/or 
leverage to expand your opportunities. We’re not crazy about the prospects 
of those techniques for new investors, but we know you’ll hear about them as 
you continue to grow as an investor, so we fill you in on the details.
 
Any security you buy carries a cost. Some of those costs — like trading 
commissions — are explicit; others — 401(k) management fees, for example — 
aren’t. Some can be quite large. We provide a very complete catalog of fees and 
expenses that you may encounter and tell you how to uncover and compare 
them.
Mastering asset location
That’s right — we said “location,” not “allocation.” Asset location is the tactic 
of matching your securities with your accounts in an optimal way to exploit 
all the tax advantages you can. If you choose the location of your assets 
wisely, you can save a bundle in taxes. (Flip to Chapter 10 to read more.)
Throughout the book, we advise you to do your asset allocation on a holistic 
basis (that is, across all your investment accounts in the aggregate). Those 
accounts may include an individual taxable account for you and, if you’re 
married, one for your spouse. Maybe the two of you have a joint account or 
two. And then there are IRAs, 401(k)s, health savings accounts, and more. 
When you really sit down and think about it, you may be surprised by just 
how many accounts you have. You should consider them all in total when 
you apply your asset allocation.

20
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
That doesn’t mean that you apply the same allocation percentages to each of 
the accounts — quite the contrary. The reason? Taxes. Each of the securities 
you may want to buy has its own income-tax characteristics, and some are 
more tax-friendly than others. And each of the accounts you own has specific 
tax features. Some are fully taxable, some are tax deferred, and some may be 
tax free. You can save a lot of taxes by being clever about which securities 
you locate in which accounts. In Chapter 10, we take you through a detailed 
example, using the Does (a fictional couple we introduce in Chapter 8), to 
show you how to be tax smart at the account level while achieving your 
desired asset allocation at the portfolio level.
Monitoring your portfolio to stay on target
The rebalancing that we talk about earlier (and in depth in Chapter 5) can 
provide you substantial benefits. (Remember that rebalancing is what we call 
the closest thing to a free lunch you’ll ever find in investing.) But to get those 
benefits, you have to rebalance at the right times.
 
The “right time” to rebalance can’t be scheduled in advance. These times 
aren’t specific calendar dates; they occur when your portfolio drifts away from 
its target asset allocations by a sufficient amount. So, you need to keep tabs on 
your portfolio to make sure you don’t miss those rebalancing opportunities.
In Chapter 11, we go through this rebalancing exercise with the Does. As we 
also discuss in that chapter, there are additional reasons to diligently moni-
tor your portfolio. The individual securities you own may suddenly go sour 
and start losing value. Or, after a good run, they may simply run out of steam. 
When you add a security to your portfolio, you should set guidelines around 
its market price. Those guideline prices will act as useful triggers, to let you 
know when you should review the security and possibly remove it from your 
portfolio.
You also want to monitor your portfolio to be on top of opportunities to take 
advantage of certain tax-saving tactics, such as tax loss harvesting, which we 
discuss in more detail in the “Tackling taxes” section, later in this chapter.
Measuring your results
You may have heard the old saw “You can’t manage what you can’t mea-
sure.” When it comes to investing, that nugget is a golden one. So it’s cer-
tainly worth knowing how to measure your investment results the right way.

21
 Chapter 1: Understanding Asset Allocation
In Chapter 12, we outline the following five key elements for understanding 
your investment results and putting them in meaningful context:
 
✓ Principal: The amount you invested
 
✓ Term: The length of time over which you’re measuring your results
 
✓ Risk: The degree of safety built into your investment
 
✓ Opportunity cost: The results you could’ve gotten for a typical alterna-
tive investment with similar risk over the same term
 
✓ Suitability: The degree to which this investment is in step with your 
financial plan
We show you how to express your results as a return, to address the first two 
elements — principal and term. Then, to cover the next two elements — risk 
and opportunity cost — we explain how to derive, and compare your return 
against, relevant benchmarks. Finally, we revisit your LCP, which we discuss 
earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 7, to help you determine the suitability 
of your investment and to track future progress.
Reaching Past the Asset 
Allocation Basics
If you establish the best asset allocation for your situation, pick your invest-
ments carefully, mix them together in the right proportions, rebalance them 
when appropriate, and do all the other things we describe in this chapter, 
you can become a savvy investor with a consistent, successful portfolio. 
And as your investing knowledge and experience continue to grow, you can 
add some other ideas and techniques to your asset allocation arsenal. These 
beyond-the-basics items are the focal point of Part IV.
Adding alternatives
Alternatives are those investments that go beyond the traditional asset 
classes of cash, fixed income, and equities. In Chapter 13, we examine a wide 
range of alternative investments — from pork bellies to property — and tell 
you how you can buy them. We also review what the right alternatives can 
do for your portfolio by allowing you to exploit their poor correlation — their 
tendency to zig in the market when your other investments zag.

22
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
Tackling taxes
It’s not what you make, but what you keep, that counts. In Chapter 14, we 
share some tactics that the pros use to minimize their income taxes. We look 
at tax-smart selling, we revisit asset location, and we expand on tax-loss har-
vesting, which is a way that you can take lemons (in this case, losses) and 
make lemonade (tax breaks). But we also warn you against going too far. The 
best investors recognize that the real goal is not minimizing taxes, but maxi-
mizing after-tax results.
 
Don’t let saving taxes get in the way of intelligent investing.
Altering your allocation
You also want to be alert to revisiting your asset allocation over the years. 
Although your asset allocation is designed for the long haul, you don’t want 
to be blind to changes — in your own situation and in the environment 
around you — that should trigger a return visit to the assumptions you relied 
on to establish your allocation. We explore these changes, and your appro-
priate responses, in Chapter 15.
Embracing expert help
Even the most talented do-it-yourselfer needs the support of an expert now 
and again. You can be an asset allocation ace and still need to call on a pro-
fessional financial advisor for help on a specific challenge or with a particular 
facet of your investment strategy (or even for the whole ball of wax).
Chapter 16 is devoted to helping you determine just what kind of assistance 
you may need and where to find it. We guide you through the labyrinth of 
professional designations and tell you which ones are the most meaningful 
and relevant for your needs. We give you a set of probing questions to ask 
potential advisors, so you can separate the wheat from the chaff. And we 
explain advisors’ various means of getting paid, so you can be sure that their 
incentives are in line with your own.

Chapter 2
Weighing Risk and Return
In This Chapter
▶ Measuring the return on your investments
▶ Understanding risk
▶ Evaluating the risk-return tradeoff
T
he two most fundamental concepts in investing are risk and return. It’s 
difficult to achieve any degree of success with your investments with-
out a firm grasp of these two notions. What are risk and return? What do 
they mean? How do you measure them? And how do they interact with each 
other? In Chapter 2, we present answers to these questions, and help get you 
comfortable with these two critical facets of investing.
Return is the good stuff. Everybody wants an appetizing return. It’s like the 
delectable flavor in an excellent dish. Risk is the bad stuff — the nasty satu-
rated fat in the recipe. But, alas, the best-tasting foods also tend to contain 
the most nasty stuff. That’s the trade-off — in cooking, and in investing. You 
have to take the bad with the good. The art (really, the science) is in striking 
the right balance. Whenever you invest, the challenge is to find the most prof-
itable balance of risk and return.
In this chapter, we take a close look at return and the various ways to mea-
sure it. It’s easy to get confused by all the different types of returns you may 
see published daily in the stock tables of newspapers and financial Web sites, 
but we’ll help you see through the clutter. We also examine risk, a much less 
intuitive concept, but one that actually holds the key for unlocking success-
ful investing. In essence, risk is subjective, but we show you how to measure 
it in a meaningful way. We clue you in on how risk depends heavily on the 
period of time you intend to invest, which is an important concept to grasp 
as you strive to make the most of your investments.
Finally, we introduce the idea of the efficient frontier, a very powerful visual 
aid that brings risk and return together quite naturally. We show you how to 
use the efficient frontier to minimize risk and maximize return — so you can 
have your cake and eat it, too.

24
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
Measuring Return
You can’t tell how well your investments are doing unless you’re able to mea-
sure results. The generally accepted way for you to do that is by expressing 
your investment gains (or losses) during an investment period as a percent-
age of the amount you invested. This percentage, which can be positive or 
negative, is called an investment return.
For example, if you invest $100 at the beginning of a period — a period can 
be any length of time — and it grows to $110 b y the end, the result for you is 
a $10 gain. That $10 is 10 percent of your original $100 investment (10 ÷ 100 = 
0.10), so your investment yielded a 10 percent return. But if, instead, you end 
the period with $95, your $5 loss — 5 percent of your original $100 invest-
ment (5 ÷ 100 = 0.05) — would represent a –5 percent return.
Are those results good? Well, it depends on what you were trying to accom-
plish, how much risk you took, and what the general investment environment 
was like during that period. For example, a –5 percent return for an aggressive 
portfolio during the extended bear market of 2000 to 2002 might be considered 
a fairly nice return indeed. (A bear market is one in which securities decline 
in value.) A 10 percent return for the same portfolio during the bull market 
of 2003 would’ve been disappointing. (Securities generally increase in value 
during a bull market.) In Chapter 12, we dig into the gory details of measuring 
investment results, but in this chapter we provide you with the basics so you 
can build a solid foundation of understanding.
In this section, we cover the different types of returns you’ll see, and what 
they measure. Investment returns are expressed as growth, income, and 
total return (a combination of growth and income), and are either adjusted 
for inflation (real return) or not (nominal return). We’ll work a few examples 
together, calculating time-weighted and dollar-weighted returns, and simple 
and compound average returns. Finally, we discuss the fees, expenses, and 
taxes that affect the return you receive.
Total return and its components
Two main components make up investment return:
 
✓ Income: Income generally takes the form of interest (in the case of 
bonds) or dividends (in the case of stocks). Income cannot be negative.
 
✓ Growth: Growth, also called market appreciation, is the change in market 
value of your investment from the beginning of your investment period 
to the end. Growth can be positive or negative.

25
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risk and Return
The combination of income and growth — expressed as a percentage of the 
amount invested — is called total return.
If you invest $100 in a stock at the beginning of a period, receive a dividend 
during the period of $5, and at the end of the period, the market value of 
your stock is $110, then your income is $5, your growth is $10, and your total 
return is $15 ($5 + $10) divided by $100, or 15 percent.
If, instead, the ending market value is $90, and everything else is the same, 
then your income is still $5, your growth is –$10, and your total return is –$5 
($5 – $10) divided by $100, or –5 percent.
Both income and growth are important to you, which is why you want to 
focus on total return.
 
Be careful when reading about returns in the press. You may read, “The S&P 
500 Stock Index was up 10 percent over the last 12 months.” When quoted that 
way, it usually refers only to growth, omitting income. If you read, “The total 
return for the S&P 500 Stock Index over the last 12 months was 10 percent,” 
then you know that both growth and income have been included.
Nominal return versus real return
Sometimes it’s useful to know if your portfolio is keeping ahead of inflation. If 
your return one year was 2 percent, and inflation was 3 percent, you’ve lost 
ground (your portfolio lost purchasing power). To measure return against 
inflation, the term real return was developed.
Real return is simply your return minus inflation. In this example, your real 
return was –1 percent (2 percent – 3 percent). Your unadjusted return of 
2 percent is called your nominal return. If, in the same year, your friend’s 
nominal return was 10 percent, her real return was 7 percent (10 percent – 3 
percent).
 
Nominal returns aren’t adjusted for inflation; real returns are.
Whether you’re talking about total return or its components (income and 
growth), those returns can be expressed as either a nominal return or a real 
return. When we use the word return in this book, unless we specifically indi-
cate otherwise we’re referring to total nominal return (income and growth 
combined, unadjusted for inflation).
 
Unless specifically referred to as a real return, any mention of returns you 
encounter (in the media, on the Internet, and so on) will likely be referring to a 
nominal return, which is a return that isn’t adjusted for inflation.

26
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
Understanding time-weighted return 
versus dollar-weighted return
All the returns mentioned so far in this chapter assume a single beginning-
of-period investment and no further deposits or withdrawals to or from the 
account. When there are mid-period deposits or withdrawals, which will be 
a frequent occurrence, you need to do a little more arithmetic to properly 
calculate your return. Let’s assume that at the beginning of the period, you 
invested $100, and at mid-period, you added another $100 to your investment. 
Let’s further assume that the return on your investment in the first half of the 
period was 10 percent, and the return in the second half was –5 percent.
What was your return for the whole period? There are actually two answers: 
The time-weighted return was roughly 5 percent and the dollar-weighted return 
was roughly 0 percent. (We use the word roughly because those percent-
ages aren’t completely precise due to compounding, which we discuss in a 
few pages.) What’s the difference between time-weighted return and dollar-
weighted return? Which return is correct? It all depends on how you like your 
information served:
 
✓ Time-weighted return: The time-weighted return reflects the fact that, 
for half the investment period, the return was 10 percent, and for the 
other half it was –5 percent. The two parts of the period are the same 
length, so they’re equally weighted, resulting in a full-period return of 
roughly 5 percent.
 
 Why is the time-weighted return particularly helpful? If you’re trying to 
do a fair comparison of your investment to others available at the same 
time, or to an industry benchmark return, then the time-weighted return 
is a great way to do so.
 
✓ Dollar-weighted return: The dollar-weighted return, as you’d guess, 
places more emphasis on the dollar amounts involved in the investment. 
Sticking with the same example, your investment during the second half 
was twice the dollar amount of your investment during the first half; 
therefore, the second-half return should get twice the weight, resulting 
in a full-period return of roughly 0 percent.
 
 What makes the dollar-weighted return so useful? If you’re looking for an 
accurate historical depiction of what happened to your wealth, it’s tough 
to beat the dollar-weighted return. To see why the dollar-weighted return 
gives you an accurate historical depiction of what happened to your 
wealth, think about how your wealth actually changed in this example.
 
 During the first half of the period, you gained $10 ($100 × 0.10). As the 
second half began, you added to your accumulated $110 (your original 
$100 investment plus your $10 gain) the second deposit of $100, for a 
total mid-period investment of $210. During the second half, you lost 

27
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risk and Return
roughly $10 ($210 × 0.05). Your second-half loss of roughly $10 almost 
exactly offset your first-half gain of $10, so your investment gain for the 
whole period was roughly $0.
 
 Thus, the roughly 0 percent dollar-weighted return calculation has real 
meaning to you — it accurately depicts the change in your actual wealth.
 
Here’s how you can remember the distinction between time-weighted and 
dollar-weighted returns:
 
✓ If you want to know how you did — how your wealth changed over the 
life of the investment — use dollar-weighted return.
 
✓ If you want to know how the investment itself did (perhaps to compare it 
to other investment choices your friends may have made, or to bench-
mark returns you see in the newspaper), use time-weighted return.
Again, one measure is not necessarily better than the other; it just depends 
on what information you’d like to know.
 
The only fair way to compare investment choices — undistorted by mid-period 
deposits and withdrawals — is to use a time-weighted return. That’s why finan-
cial firms routinely calculate investment returns based on this measure.
If you tend to make lots of deposits and withdrawals, then computing either 
time-weighted or dollar-weighted returns can be quite complex and cumber-
some. In that case, it’s best to have an investment advisor do it for you. If you 
don’t have an investment advisor and need one, see Chapter 16.
Annualizing multiyear returns
When you’ve been investing for several years, it’s useful to express your 
investment return on an annualized basis, because it’s common to think of 
and compare returns over a 12-month period. There are two ways to do this: 
simple average and compound average.
The simple average method is very basic, and the calculations involved might 
take you back to math class in grade school, when the closest thing you had 
to an investment was a baseball-card collection. To figure out a simple aver-
age for the return on an investment you have as an adult (the kind of invest-
ment that probably didn’t come with a stick of gum), just add up your return 
percentages for a certain number of years, and then divide by that number 
of years. For example, let’s assume that over a five-year period, your annual 
returns are 10 percent, 5 percent, 7 percent, –5 percent, and 13 percent. The 
simple, or arithmetic, average return is the sum of the five returns (10 percent + 
5 percent + 7 percent – 5 percent + 13 percent = 30 percent) divided by 5. The 
simple average, then, is 6 percent.

28
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
Using the same five-year returns as above, the compound average return is 5.8 
percent. This is also referred to as the compound annual growth rate (CAGR).
How do you calculate it?
 
1. Convert each year’s return to decimal form and add the decimal to 1.
 
 For this example, that would mean 0.10 + 1 = 1.10; 0.05 + 1 = 1.05; 0.07 + 1 = 
1.07; –0.05 + 1 = 0.95; and 0.13 + 1 = 1.13.
 
2. Multiply the resulting numbers — which each correspond to an indi-
vidual year — together.
 
 In this example that would be 1.10 × 1.05 × 1.07 × 0.95 × 1.13 = 1.3267.
 
3. Take the root of the product equal to the number of years you’re 
working with.
 
 This example includes five years, so you would take the fifth root of the 
product you came up with in Step 2: 1.3267
1/5 = 1.058.
 
 Use an Excel spreadsheet, or the root key on your calculator, to do this 
calculation for you.
 
4. Subtract 1, and express the result as a percentage.
 
 So, 1.058 – 1 = 0.058 or 5.8 percent.
Compound average returns are more meaningful than simple average returns, 
because they better reflect the real world. This can be seen by taking a more 
extreme example.
Suppose you made a two-year investment. Your return in the first year was 
100 percent (your investment doubled), and in the second year it was –50 
percent (your investment dropped by half). If you started with $100, your 
investment grew to $200 in year 1 (double $100), and shrank back to $100 in 
year 2 (half $200). The simple average return is (100 percent – 50 percent) ÷ 2 
= 0.25, or 25 percent . To calculate the compound average return, you follow 
these steps:
 
1. Convert each year’s return to decimal form and add the decimal to 1.
 
 So, 1 + 1 = 2 and –0.5 + 1 = 0.5.
 
2. Multiply the resulting numbers — which each correspond to an indi-
vidual year — together.
 
 So, 2 × 0.5 = 1.
 
3. Take the root of the product equal to the number of years you’re 
working with.
 
 So, 1
1/2 = 1.
 
4. Subtract 1, and express the result as a percentage.
 
 So, 1 – 1 = 0, or 0 percent.

29
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risk and Return
Which calculation offers a more realistic result? You ended up with exactly 
what you started with ($100), so your actual return was 0 percent, no question, 
and it remains 0 percent when annualized. The simple average return clearly 
overstates the performance of this investment. Generally, it always will.
 
The compound average return is always the better measure. Don’t use the 
simple average just because it’s easier to calculate — it can give you ques-
tionable answers. But you need to understand this type of measure, because 
sometimes that’s how returns are presented.
 
The compound average return will always be less than or equal to the simple 
average return. This is because of risk drag, a subtle but very real phenome-
non explained a little later in the “Understanding how volatility erodes return: 
Risk drag” section. In fact, the only time the two averages will be equal is when 
the individual years’ returns are all the same. Since this is very unlikely, it’s 
almost always the case that the simple average will be less realistic than the 
compound average return.
 
Don’t trust simple average returns. When you’re presented with an invest-
ment’s annualized return, make sure you know which averaging method was 
used. If you have to, do the math yourself to get your hands on the compound 
average return.
Accounting for taxes, fees, and expenses
You also need to be aware of the costs that can reduce your return. The big-
gest factors that erode returns are taxes, fees, and expenses. We explain all 
three in this section.
Considering the taxes that affect your investment returns
Your gains are subject to income tax. Interest income and short-term real-
ized capital gains (gains made on investments you own for a year or less) are 
generally taxed at your ordinary income tax rates. In addition, in many states 
you’ll pay state income taxes, which vary depending on where you live. 
Dividends and long-term realized capital gains (investment gains that result 
after owning the investment for more than a year) are usually taxed at lower 
rates.
Although tax rates, as well as the relative treatment of different types of gain, 
change over time, the fact is that taxes are bound to take a bite out of your 
return. Even if the gains occur within a tax-deferred account — an IRA or 
401(k) for example — though they aren’t taxed at the time they’re received or 
realized, they are taxed, along with your principal, at your ordinary income 
tax rates when you pull that money out of the account. Because taxes are 
very specific to each individual, and because they’re usually levied well after 
the time gains occur, returns are almost always expressed on a pre-tax basis.

There’s nothing inappropriate about this, but recognize that, in general, not 
all your return is ultimately yours to keep. It’s as certain as death and — well, 
you know the rest.
Understanding fees and expenses
In addition to taxes, various fees and expenses can nibble away at your 
return. These include transaction fees (commissions charged by a stockbro-
ker for trading securities, for example), margin expenses (expenses incurred 
if you borrow against your account), dividend adjustments, custodial fees, 
and fund management fees. (For more information on specific fees, turn to 
Chapter 9.)
Mutual funds levy fund management fees, which lower the return you would 
otherwise receive. So do exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which trade through-
out the day like a stock and contain a basket of securities like a mutual fund. 
Compared to mutual funds, ETF charges are generally low. Mutual fund and 
ETF charges are calculated as a percentage of assets and are disclosed in the 
fund prospectus. Additionally, if you engage an investment advisor, advisory 
fees can be deducted directly from your account or invoiced separately. In 
employer-sponsored qualified plans such as 401(k)s, there are management 
fees that aren’t explicitly shown or disclosed but that reduce your return. 
These can be substantial (often exceeding the fees charged by investment 
advisory firms), and they depend on the amount of revenue-sharing negoti-
ated between your employer and the plan administrator.
 
The often large and hidden nature of 401(k) fees is one very good reason that 
it’s generally smart for you to roll over your 401(k) into your IRA at your earli-
est opportunity.
When you review your investment performance statements, make sure you 
know whether the returns you’re looking at are gross or net of fees and 
expenses. Reputable firms will clearly disclose this information.
Measuring Risk
Any discussion of return is incomplete without a discussion of risk.
As all the investment brochures and prospectuses say, “Past performance 
is no guarantee of future results.” This lack of certainty about future returns 
is essentially what is meant by risk. It’s an inherent part of the investment 
experience.
One way to express risk is the short-term fluctuation in the value of your 
portfolio. The short-term investor who checks his account status several 
times a month will see, and measure, his investment risk in this way. For him, 

31
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risk and Return
risk might be expressed by the day-to-day or week-to-week fluctuations in his 
return. A return that fluctuates from 2 percent one week to –2 percent the 
next might represent an intolerable amount of risk for this investor.
For some other investors, losing money in the short term may not matter all 
that much. For the longer-term investor who’s mostly concerned with the 
size of her account several years down the road, risk may be expressed as 
the chance that her portfolio may not stay sufficiently ahead of inflation over 
that period.
So you can see from these two examples that risk is very specific to each 
investor. In this section, we explain how to distinguish between risk and 
volatility — a difference that confuses some investors. We also tell you how 
to measure risk and how to take special care to incorporate a very important 
factor into your understanding of risk: your time horizon.
Differentiating between volatility and risk
Sometimes, volatility (of return) is used interchangeably with risk. But volatil-
ity and risk aren’t the same thing. First of all, volatility is an objective con-
cept, intrinsic to the investment itself, and it can be explicitly measured. You 
won’t find shades of gray in measurements of volatility. Risk, on the other 
hand, is quite subjective, and unique to each investor — including you! Allow 
us to elaborate with a rather extreme example.
Consider the following two “investments”: playing the roulette wheel and 
buying a Treasury bill. Clearly, the wheel is quite a bit more volatile than 
the Treasury bill, because the probability of losing your entire investment is 
significant.
But which investment is more of a risk? It depends on who’s making the 
investment. Take, for example, the unfortunate soul who needs to come up 
with a payment in the next 30 days to an unforgiving creditor, in an amount 
exactly twice the assets he currently has available. To this investor, the 
Treasury bill represents a much riskier proposition than the roulette wheel. 
The extremely remote chance that the Treasury bill is going to provide a big 
enough return in such a small amount of time make it a risky investment in 
this case. This investor needs as much volatility as he can find to minimize 
his risk of coming up short in a month. The roulette wheel presents at least 
the possibility of doubling his investment in the short term; with Treasury 
bills, the investor is virtually guaranteed to fail. In this example, Treasury 
bills are the less volatile, but more risky, alternative. (We told you this exam-
ple was extreme. Of course, we aren’t recommending gambling as a prudent 
investment strategy, unless your investment goals include scoring two free 
coupons for the steak and lobster buffet and getting comped for an upgrade 
to a room with a hot tub!)

32
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
 
Volatility is an objective measure that is clearly identifiable. Risk, on the other 
hand, is subjective and exists totally in the eye of the beholder. It’s important 
that you carefully consider and clearly articulate what level of risk causes you 
discomfort — what keeps you awake at night — with regard to your investments.
Understanding how volatility 
erodes return: Risk drag
There is another very important aspect of the interplay between volatility 
and return to understand, and it’s known as risk drag. Over realistic invest-
ment horizons (for example, greater than a single year), volatility can actually 
decrease your return. The example in Table 2-1 illustrates this phenomenon.

As you review Table 2-1, ask yourself this question: If you’re an investor 
with a ten-year investment horizon, which portfolio would you rather hold? 
Portfolio A has a simple average annual return of 8 percent, and Portfolio 
B has a simple average annual return of 9 percent. What’s it going to be? 

33
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risk and Return
Without the benefit of Table 2-1, Portfolio B would seem like the clear winner. 
But if Portfolio B has a standard deviation (a measure of volatility — see 
“Standard deviation,” later in this chapter) of 18 percent and Portfolio A has 
a standard deviation of 0 percent, should that change your mind? The table 
indicates that, indeed, it should. Depending on its volatility, a higher-return-
ing portfolio may not result in greater wealth.
In fact, any asset with volatility greater than zero will see its multiyear return 
eroded —the more volatility, the more erosion. This phenomenon is called 
risk drag. It’s subtle but real, and it’s one reason you should never be satis-
fied with a display of only a single year’s results for any investment.
Another way to describe the result in Table 2-1 is to note that the compound 
annual average return for Portfolio A is the same as its simple average return 
of 8 percent. However, for Portfolio B the compound average return is 7.6 
percent, which is much less than its simple average return of 9 percent. In 
fact, the volatility of this portfolio’s return is so high that its compound aver-
age return is even less than Portfolio A’s simple average return. And as you 
can read in “Annualizing multiyear returns,” earlier in this chapter, it’s the 
compound average return that matters to you.
Using statistical measures for risk
When it comes to measuring risk, you can do it yourself by using some tools 
from the field of probability and statistics. If the sight of those two words 
takes you back to your school days and makes your palms sweat and eyes 
start to glaze over, fear not! We explain the details of how to measure risk — 
in layman’s terms — in this section.
Range
Range is certainly one of the most straightforward risk measures — it’s 
simply the spread of results from lowest to highest. For an example, we’ll 
reuse the five-year series of annual returns that we analyze earlier in this 
chapter: 10 percent, 5 percent, 7 percent, –5 percent, and 13 percent. The 
lowest return is –5 percent; the highest, 13 percent. The range over the five-
year period is the difference between the two, or 18 percent.
 
In general, the wider the range, the greater the volatility, or fluctuations, in 
returns.
Standard deviation
One of the most common measures of risk in investment circles is standard 
deviation, which is a measure of departure from an average. In other words, 
the more an investment’s return varies from an average, the greater the stan-
dard deviation.

34
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
For an example of how to calculate standard deviation, we’ll look back to 
the five-year series of annual returns that we use throughout this chapter: 
namely, 10 percent, 5 percent, 7 percent, –5 percent, and 13 percent. The 
simple average return for this series is 6 percent. (For an explanation of 
how to find a simple average return, turn back to “Annualizing multiyear 
returns.”) The standard deviation of this series of returns is calculated using 
this simple average of 6 percent:
 
1. Take the difference between each year’s return and the simple average 
return percentage.
 
 Here’s how this would look in our example:
 
• Year 1: 10 percent – 6 percent = 4 percent
 
• Year 2: 5 percent – 6 percent = –1 percent
 
• Year 3: 7 percent – 6 percent = 1 percent
 
• Year 4: –5 percent – 6 percent = –11 percent
 
• Year 5: 13 percent – 6 percent = 7 percent
 
2. Square each of these differences.
 
 Again, here’s how this would look:
 
• Year 1: 4 × 4 = 16
 
• Year 2: –1 × –1 = 1
 
• Year 3: 1 × 1 = 1
 
• Year 4: –11 × –11 = 121
 
• Year 5: 7 × 7 = 49
 
3. Add up the differences.
 
 In this example, that means you add 16 + 1 + 1 + 121 + 49 = 188.
 
4. Divide by the total number of annual returns minus 1.
 
 In this case, the total number of annual returns is 5. Subtract 1 and you 
get 4. So, you have 188 ÷ 4 = 47.
 
5. Take the square root of the result.
 
 The square root of 47 is 6.86, and for this example that’s your standard 
deviation.
 
 Use a calculator to get the square root of a number.
One reason standard deviation is a more popular measure of risk than range 
is that standard deviation provides more contextual information. Generally, 
for any sufficiently large group of values, about two-thirds will lie within 
one standard deviation of the group’s simple average. Even more — about 
95 percent — will fall within two standard deviations.

35
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risk and Return
One way this information is used in investing is to note that, if an invest-
ment’s expected return is 8 percent and its standard deviation is 4 percent, 
then the probability of next year’s return being between 4 percent and 12 
percent (within one standard deviation on either side of 8 percent) is about 
two-thirds. And the probability of the return being between 0 percent and 16 
percent (within two standard deviations on either side of 8 percent) is about 
95 percent.
Standard deviation tends to be the commonly used risk measure for most 
investment purposes. Keeping an eye on an investment’s standard deviation 
will help you monitor the period-to-period fluctuation of your return over time.
 
Generally speaking, the larger the standard deviation, the greater the volatility.
If you’re a short-term, worrywart investor, standard deviation provides a 
helpful measure for you because it measures period-to-period volatility.
 
Candidly assess what causes you anxiety. Only then can you decide on a risk 
measure (or collection of measures) that’s right for you — and only then can 
you meaningfully compare any two investment choices with each other.
Factoring in your time horizon
You can’t fully understand investment risk without considering your invest-
ment horizon. What may be risky to some investors with a short timeline 
may not be risky at all to investors who have the luxury of being patient. It all 
depends on the time that you have to invest.
Catching up on the downside
Are you an investor with a long-term view? Are 
you willing to ride the frequent fluctuations of 
a more volatile investment, and are you mostly 
concerned about beating inflation over several 
years? If you answered yes to all those ques-
tions, you may want to consider paying attention 
to a less common risk measure called downside 
risk. Downside risk is a measure of the probabil-
ity that a set of annual returns, or a multiyear 
compound return, will fail to exceed some mini-
mum objective. If, for example, your objective 
is to simply beat inflation, then the probability 
of your real return (your nominal return minus 
inflation — see “Nominal return versus real 
return,” earlier in this chapter) failing to exceed 
0 would be a suitable risk measure for you.
Calculating downside risk is beyond the scope 
of most individual investors, and it isn’t typically 
calculated or published by financial firms. A 
qualified expert (see Chapter 16) could calcu-
late it for you if you’re interested.

36
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
To illustrate this point, consider the effect of the investment horizon on three 
broad asset classes: Treasury bills (T-bills), intermediate government bonds, 
and large-company stocks. In Figure 2-1, we show the historical range of com-
pound average annual returns (see “Annualizing multiyear returns,” earlier in 
this chapter) for these three assets, assuming different holding periods.
As expected, for short holding periods (such as one year), the range of returns 
for stocks is much greater than for bonds, which, in turn, is greater than for 
T-bills. Specifically, for T-bills, the worst one-year return was 1 percent, and 
the best was 15 percent, for a range of 14 percentage points. Meanwhile, for 
large-company stocks, the worst one-year return was –26 percent, and the 
best was 53 percent, for a range of 79 percentage points.
Over longer holding periods, these ranges narrow considerably. For example, 
over a ten-year holding period, the worst compound average annual return 
for T-bills was 0 percent, and the best was 9 percent, for a range of 9 percent-
age points. For stocks, the range narrowed all the way down to 18 percentage 
points (worst was 1 percent; best was 19 percent). As you can see, the longer 
the holding period, the smaller the difference in ranges across all three asset 
classes. In fact, over a ten-year investment horizon, the range of returns for 
stocks would actually be preferred to that for bonds and T-bills by most 
investors, because the worst return for stocks (1 percent) was actually better 
than the worst return for T-bills (0 percent).

 Chapter 2: Weighing Risk and Return
In fact, there hasn’t been a ten-year period since 1950 during which the worst 
returns for stocks wasn’t positive. That can’t be said of T-bills or bonds. 
Meanwhile, the average return for stocks was always much better than that 
for T-bills and bonds, across all holding periods.
 
In essence, given enough time, risk spreading across time occurs — the good 
years and the bad years tend to offset each other.
You can see that the length of your investment horizon will have an impact 
on the mix of assets in your portfolio. As an example, the longer your hori-
zon, the more comfortable you can be considering equities. We discuss that 
situation, and many more concerns relating to time horizons, in Chapter 6.
Evaluating the Trade-Off between 
Risk and Return
When you have a pretty good understanding of risk and return (which you 
can gain by working your way through the first two sections of this chapter), 
you’re ready to start applying that knowledge to your investment choices.
If you’re feeling a little risk averse, don’t worry! Many investors imagine that 
there’s a perfect portfolio out there somewhere that can generate ridiculously 
high returns with little — or even no — risk. Unfortunately, no such portfolio 
exists. What you can do is apply a concept that’s been used successfully since 
the early 1950s, when its creators won a Nobel Prize for their insights. Called 
Modern Portfolio Theory (known popularly as the theory of “Not Putting All 
Your Eggs in One Basket),” the theory suggests that investors just like you, 
who don’t like risk, can maximize the returns in their portfolio, through diver-
sification, the strategy of choosing from more than one investment.
Keep the following two sections in mind, and you, too, can figure out how to 
sort through and find the right combination of “baskets” (asset classes — see 
Chapter 3) among which to distribute your eggs.
Recognizing that there’s (usually) 
no such thing as a free lunch
 
In general, if you want more return, you’ll have to accept more risk. However 
you measure risk, higher-returning investments typically carry more risk. 
Stated another way, higher-risk investments typically reward you with greater 
returns; that’s the payoff for accepting the higher risk. After all, if higher-risk 
investments returned the same as lower-risk investments, who would choose 
the former?

38
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
As we discuss in Chapter 5, the closest thing to a free lunch that you’ll find in 
investing is rebalancing. Done right, it can actually get you more return with 
no additional risk.
Heading for the efficient frontier
One very good way to evaluate the trade-off between risk and return in your 
investment strategy is to decide on a standard measurement for risk and one 
for return, and then compare investment possibilities based on the relation-
ships between your risk and return measures.
Say, for example, that you’ve decided on using expected one-year nominal 
return as a measure for an investment’s return, and you picked standard 
deviation of the one-year return as your measurement for risk. You have 
thousands of investment options to choose from. For this example, just imag-
ine that you know both of your chosen measures (expected one-year nominal 
return for return and standard deviation of the one-year return for risk) for 
every single investment option that’s available to you.
If you wanted a very straightforward visual representation of how the risk 
compares with the return for those investment options, you could plot each 
option on a graph that uses measures of standard deviation for the horizon-
tal axis and expected return for the vertical axis. In case you don’t have your 
graph paper handy, we’ve provided an example in Figure 2-2.
Look at investment choice A. It has an expected return of 8 percent and a 
standard deviation of 6 percent. Investment choice B occupies a different 
location on the graph because it has an expected return of 12 percent and a 
standard deviation of 10 percent.
With a handy graph like this, it’s apparent that certain investment choices 
are clearly inferior to others. To see what we mean, have a look at investment 
choice X on Figure 2-3, which is the same graph from Figure 2-2 but with a 
new feature called the efficient frontier.
Investment choice X is one of several investment options that don’t offer a 
good return in relation to their risk level. In other words, there are a number of 
other investments that, for no greater risk, will give you a higher return. These 
better choices lie in the sector bounded by choices X, Y, and Z on the map.

Against these other, more appealing alternatives, investment X is considered 
inefficient. It can, therefore, be removed from consideration. In fact, you can 
also throw out the majority of the investment choices on this graph. Once 
you remove all these inefficient choices, you’re left with a set of investments 
that lie on a curve sloping from lower left to upper right. These are the effi-
cient investments, so named because for any one of them, it’s not possible 
to find another investment that has lower risk for the same level of return, or 
higher return for the same level of risk. The curve that these efficient invest-
ments lie on is called the efficient frontier. There are no investment possibili-
ties to be found northwest of the efficient frontier, and you know that the 
best investment choices for you lie along the frontier. The efficient frontier is 
a very powerful concept — one we discuss throughout this book.

After you’ve figured out which investment options have the highest potential 
for return coupled with the lowest risk, how do you choose among them? 
There is no objective right answer to this question. It depends on your own 
subjective opinion. But there’s a simple way to get to the answer that’s right 
for you.
For an illustration of how you can find your ideal investment along an effi-
cient frontier, consider Figure 2-4. If you take the time to apply this informa-
tion, you can put this theory to work for you very effectively.
Because all the investments along the frontier are equivalently efficient, the 
only way to increase your return is by increasing the degree of risk you’re 
willing to take (that is, by moving northeast along the frontier). So, because 
any rational investor would want to maximize his return — assuming the 
associated level of risk was tolerable — the only thing he needs to do is 
determine how much risk is too much for him. That tells him how far east he 
dare go, and because he wants to stay on the frontier, it also tells him how 
far north he can go. This process, thus, uniquely determines the investment 
choice he should make.

Chapter 3
Making Sense of Asset Classes
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing the basic asset classes to consider in your portfolio
▶ Understanding alternative investments
▶ Expanding your horizons to include international exposure
Just as in gourmet cooking, in asset allocation an essential early step is 
identifying the proper ingredients. The best chefs realize that each ingre-
dient has a specific role to play when creating a delicious dish. Likewise, the 
best investors identify a wide variety of investment types and incorporate 
them in an efficient, profitable portfolio. Put in too much stock, or too much 
stock from a small company, and you may end up with too much of a good 
thing. Similarly, mix in too many low-risk, low-interest-bearing cash equiva-
lents or bonds, and your portfolio may get weighed down and fall flat.
In this chapter, we discuss the specific features of the individual components 
(the asset classes and subclasses) that go into creating a successful investment 
portfolio. There are conventional classes that all financial professionals agree 
you should own (fixed income and equities), but you need to consider a number 
of other asset classes, too: international investments as well as alternative 
investments such as real estate, commodities, and hedge funds. We help you get 
to know the full menu of asset classes, and explore their many features. Finally, 
you discover how to weigh the options available among these investments, 
so that you know how to add them to your portfolio’s asset allocation mix.
Identifying the Traditional Classes
There are three main, or traditional, asset classes that you should consider 
when putting together your portfolio:
 
✓ Stocks: You can include stocks, or equities, through which you own a 
piece of a company and receive a slice of its profits. This asset class prom-
ises the highest returns, but it also carries the most risk. (Flip back to 
Chapter 2 for a helpful discussion of risk and return.) Equities make sense 
in the right proportion, and especially if you have a long time horizon.

44
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
 
✓ Bonds: You can also mix in a number of fixed-income investments like 
bonds, which are a less-risky asset class. Bonds pay a fixed rate of 
return in exchange for the money you lend to a company, municipality, 
or government agency. They help balance the risk in your portfolio.
 
✓ Cash: You can always incorporate cash and cash equivalents in your 
portfolio. These short-term investments include certificates of deposit 
(CDs), money-market deposit accounts, and money-market mutual 
funds. They carry the least risk of all, but they also promise the least 
return. Because these investments are your safe money (money you 
expect to use in the near future to pay for an important goal, such as 
education or a new home), the relatively low returns are acceptable.
Want to know more about these traditional asset classes, and how you can 
use them to your advantage? This section is loaded with all that information.
Embracing equities: Stocks 
and stock funds
One asset class that you’ll definitely want to consider is equities, which 
include stocks and stock funds. Owning a share of stock in a corporation 
means that you literally own a piece of the corporation. As an owner, you’re 
entitled to your proportionate share of the profits, or earnings, of the corpo-
ration. These earnings are returned to you in the form of a dividend (a cash 
payment to shareholders declared periodically by the corporation’s board of 
directors) and/or in the form of stock price appreciation.
There are two basic types of stock:
 
✓ Common stock: Owning common stock means you have the right to vote 
at shareholder meetings and receive dividends.
 
✓ Preferred stock: When you own a preferred stock, you forgo voting 
rights in exchange for a higher claim on assets than is held by investors 
who own common shares, if the company becomes insolvent. Preferred 
stocks are really fixed-income investments (see “Considering other types 
of fixed-income investments,” later in this chapter, for more information).
Stocks are the foundation of most investors’ portfolios for the simple reason 
that stocks have outperformed most other investments over the long haul, 
as you can see in Figure 3-1. You can see — from the solid black horizontal 
line about midway through each bar on the graph — that the average annual 
return for stocks over the last 50-plus years (since 1950) is in excess of 10 
percent, about twice the average return from bonds, and more than twice the 
average return from Treasury bills.

in this chapter), stock mutual funds offer liquidity, stability, income, and 
diversification, which make these funds a very desirable choice. Here are 
some of their benefits:
 
✓ Stock mutual funds are probably the easiest way for an investor to 
purchase an equity investment. They can be bought and sold just like 
any mutual fund, instead of through stockbrokers. Also, they can be 
bought and sold in any amount, whereas stocks are best purchased in 
large, even lots.
 
✓ Stock funds contain a basket of individual stocks, so you’re not overly 
exposed to the market risk of any individual stock.
 
✓ Different types of stock funds allow you to narrow your focus to the 
part of the stock market you’re most interested in. For example, you 
can buy a fund of small-cap U.S. equities or large-cap energy companies. 
(We explain the difference between small-cap and large-cap stocks in the 
“Size” section.)
The big upside to stock mutual funds: diversification and ease of buying and 
selling. The big downside: management fees inside the mutual fund, which 
aren’t present when buying or selling a stock directly.

Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
When you’re considering a stock for your portfolio, there are three features 
you should be familiar with: size, style, and sector.
Size
Stocks are often categorized by size, called market capitalization (or market 
cap for short). Market cap is simply the current market value of a share of the 
stock (the stock price) multiplied by the total number of shares outstanding. 
For example, if a company has 50 million shares of its stock outstanding, and 
each share has a market value of $100, then the company’s market cap is 50 
million × $100 = $5 billion.
Stock size ranges may vary among brokerages, but here are the general 
breaking points between large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks:
 
✓ Large cap: Companies with a market cap of more than $10 billion
 
✓ Mid cap: Companies with a market cap of $2 billion to $10 billion
 
✓ Small cap: Companies with a market cap under $2 billion
 
The small-cap category is sometimes split further, with micro cap representing 
the lower end of the small-cap range (between $50 million and $300 million). 
Micro cap sounds miniscule, but there’s a still smaller classification: Nano-cap 
companies have a market cap of less than $50 million.
Generally, the larger the market cap, the more stable the stock price over 
time and the lower the expected long-term return. Similarly, the smaller the 
market cap, the more volatile the stock price over time and the higher the 
expected long-term return. Although these relationships don’t always hold 
up over short time periods, they’re reasonable expectations for the long run. 
These size characteristics come into play when you set your asset allocation 
percentages (see Chapter 8).
Sector
A stock’s sector is determined by the industry of its issuing company. Standard 
& Poor’s divides stocks into the following ten major industry sectors listed 
here (along with specific examples of each, to help you understand what’s 
what):
 
✓ Basic materials: Alcoa, Dow Chemical, Weyerhaeuser
 
✓ Consumer discretionary: Amazon.com, Home Depot, Starbucks
 
✓ Consumer staples: Campbell Soup Company, Procter & Gamble, Wal-Mart
 
✓ Energy: Chevron, Halliburton, Schlumberger
 
✓ Financials: Allstate, MetLife, Bank of America

47
 Chapter 3: Making Sense of Asset Classes
 
✓ Healthcare: Aetna, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic
 
✓ Industrials: 3M, General Electric, Southwest Airlines
 
✓ Information technology: Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo!
 
✓ Telecommunications: AT&T, Qwest, Verizon
 
✓ Utilities: Consolidated Edison, Duke Energy, Southern Company
 
Dow Jones & Company divides stocks into ten comparable groups.
During different phases of the economic cycle, some sectors tend to perform 
better than others do. For example, during periods of economic expansion, 
consumer discretionary stocks tend to do well; during periods of contrac-
tion, healthcare and consumer staples (also known as the defensive sectors, 
because they provide relatively stable earnings regardless of the health of 
the economy) tend to be the relative winners. Trying to take advantage of 
these tendencies by tactically tilting your portfolio accordingly is called 
sector rotation. The trick, of course, is to know when the turning points in the 
economy will occur before the majority of other investors do. Roughly half 
the investors who try to do this will get it right at any given time.
 
The best strategy is to have a good mix of industry sectors in your portfolio, 
and to be mindful of whether the economy is expanding or contracting when 
you do so. For more information, turn to Chapter 8.
Style
Stocks also tend to be characterized by their style, and they fall into one of 
two style classes: growth stocks or value stocks. There are no official defini-
tions of which is which, but the idea is that value stocks are underpriced, 
whereas growth stocks aren’t underpriced but are felt to have solid pros-
pects. One measure that’s used to help determine whether a stock is over- or 
underpriced is the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio, for short). If, compared to 
companies of similar size and sector, a company’s stock price is low relative 
to the company’s earnings, then it has a low P/E ratio and it’s considered a 
value stock.
Some investors like value stocks, because they feel that these stocks, the 
earnings of which are high relative to their price, are simply not fully appreci-
ated yet by the stock market and their time will soon come. Other investors 
like growth stocks, because the companies are generally strong, and this 
strength is reflected in the price that the stock market gives the company’s 
stock; the thinking is that the company’s strength will continue to drive its 
stock price even higher. Then there are those investors who say they are 
growth at a reasonable price (GARP) investors — in our view, those are 
people who really can’t make up their minds between growth and value!

48
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
As you can see, the style of a stock has less to do with the inherent quali-
ties of the company than it does with how the company’s stock is currently 
priced by the stock market. So who’s right: the value investors or the growth 
investors? Well, growth stocks and value stocks take turns falling in and 
out of favor, depending on which style offers the higher total returns at the 
time. Some pundits have made careers out of trying to predict these turning 
points, and they tend to be right about half the time. It’s fairly safe to say, 
though, that over the long term, value stocks tend to perform more favorably.
 
In our opinion, style is less important than size or sector.
Getting a handle on fixed-income 
investments: Bonds, bond funds, and more
Another asset type for you to consider is the fixed-income investment. As its 
name states, a fixed-income investment, which includes bonds and bond 
funds, pays you a fixed rate of return, in exchange for the money that you 
loan to a company, a municipality, or a government agency.
Who doesn’t love a good bond? Unlike stocks, bonds promise you regular 
interest payments. Bonds are also less volatile than stocks (meaning, they 
tend to hold their value), while stock prices can fluctuate significantly. And if 
you hold a bond to maturity, you know exactly how much you’re going to get 
back at maturity: the par value (face value) of the bond.
So why would you want to invest in anything but bonds? Well, one good 
reason is that while the interest payments and par value are promised, they 
aren’t guaranteed — bond issuers have been known to default (fail to pay 
all their promised interest and/or principal payments). The more important 
reason is that, over the long term, the total return (see Chapter 2) on bonds 
is generally inferior to that of most other asset classes.
 
If you want to reach for extra return with your portfolio, don’t plan to do it 
with bonds. You buy this type of fixed-income security primarily for stability, 
not for return.
Understanding how bonds work
The fixed periodic income you get on your bond is determined by its coupon 
rate, which is basically a predetermined interest rate. For example, you may 
buy a bond with an annual coupon rate of 4 percent, payable quarterly. 
The periodic income, or coupon payment, is simply the par value times the 
coupon rate. So, if the 4 percent bond you purchased had a par value of 
$1,000, you’d receive an annual income of $40 a year, payable in quarterly 
installments of $10 each.

49
 Chapter 3: Making Sense of Asset Classes
When you buy a bond, its market value (price) will be higher or lower than its 
par value, depending on whether prevailing market interest rates are lower 
or higher than its coupon rate. If the purchase price is greater than the par 
value, you buy the bond at a premium; if it’s less, you buy it at a discount; if 
it’s the same, you buy the bond at par.
For example, let’s say your 4 percent, $1,000 bond is a ten-year bond. Let’s 
also assume that the prevailing interest rates out in the market for ten-year 
obligations are 3 percent. In that case, your 4 percent bond might cost you 
something like $1,085, or an $85 premium over its $1,000 par value. Does 
buying a bond at a premium sound crazy — a bum deal? No, it’s simply the 
market making a natural adjustment to the price of the bond to make its 
quarterly $10 payments equate to the prevailing interest rate (in this case, 3 
percent). It makes sense for this bond to be worth more than its par value, 
because its coupon rate (4 percent) is high relative to interest rates prevail-
ing out there in the general market for similar bonds (3 percent). If, instead, 
the prevailing interest rates are 5 percent, then this 4 percent bond could 
probably be bought for around $923, or a $77 discount under its $1,000 par 
value. If the prevailing interest rates are 4 percent, then your bond would 
cost close to $1,000 — its par value.
Now, whether you bought a bond at a premium, at a discount, or at par, after 
you buy the bond, its market value will continue to increase or decrease rela-
tive to its purchase price, depending on whether prevailing market interest 
rates move lower or higher, respectively, than they were at the time of pur-
chase. So, using the case of our premium 4 percent bond that we bought for 
$1,085 (because prevailing rates were 3 percent at the time of purchase), let’s 
assume that, five years into the bond’s ten-year term, prevailing market inter-
est rates move down to 2.5 percent. By then, the market value of your bond 
exceeds the $1,085 you paid for it. If prevailing rates had moved up — say, to 
3.5 percent — then the market value of your bond would be less than $1,085 
(but still greater than the $1,000 par value, since 3.5 percent is still less than 
the bond’s 4 percent coupon rate.)
As the bond approaches maturity, its market value will converge to its 
par value. Therefore, at expiration, all bonds will be worth their par value 
(excluding any unfortunate default situations). So, if you buy a bond and fully 
expect to hold it until maturity, you really don’t care about how its market 
value changes over the life of the bond — you’re in for the long haul. Note 
that, while this convergence is true of individual bonds, it isn’t true of bond 
mutual funds (see “Getting familiar with bond mutual funds,” later in this 
chapter), since these funds will always be holding some bonds that have not 
yet matured.
Some bonds carry a coupon rate of 0 percent — these are called, naturally 
enough, zero-coupon bonds. Although they produce no coupon payments 
during their life, these bonds are sold at a discount deep enough to make 

50
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
them attractive, commensurate with coupon-paying bonds of similar matu-
rity. For example, in an environment where prevailing market interest rates 
are 4 percent, a ten-year $1,000 bond might cost around $675, or a discount 
of $325. Investors don’t receive any periodic interest payments over the 
course of a zero-coupon bond’s maturity, but these bonds, which are issued 
at a fraction of par value, increase gradually in value as the bond approaches 
maturity.
 
Zero-coupon bonds are useful if you’re saving to achieve a long-term goal, 
such as college tuition, and you don’t need a regular payout.
 
Be wary about buying a bond with a callable option (meaning, the issuer can 
call the bond for redemption and pay you back early). You may lose interest 
and be faced with a lower interest rate on a replacement bond.
Exploring the three major types of bonds
There are three principal issuers of bonds: the U.S. government, individual 
states and municipalities, and corporations. Each type of bond has slightly 
different characteristics you need to know about to work with them wisely.
U.S. government bonds
Also called Treasuries, these bonds are the safest, because they’re backed by 
“the full faith and credit of the United States government,” meaning that, by 
law, they must be paid ahead of the government’s other obligations. Income 
generated by Treasuries is free of state and local income taxes (but not fed-
eral income tax).
There are three types of Treasuries, and each matures after a different 
amount of time:
 
✓ Bills: 90 days to 1 year
 
✓ Notes: 2 to 10 years
 
✓ Bonds: 10 to 30 years
The big upside on Treasuries: safety. The big downside: inflation risk, which 
can eat away at the relatively low interest rates these investments pay.
Municipal bonds
When you buy a municipal (or muni) bond, your money goes to work for 
public projects. The big upside on munis: They’re free of local, state, and fed-
eral taxes. The big downside: usually a lower yield than taxable bonds.
Generally, munis are best for investors in high tax brackets, who can benefit 
from the triple-tax-free nature of these bonds. Although munis carry the risk 
of default (that is, the risk that the issuer cannot pay you back), this risk 
is generally very low. The risk is lowest for general obligation bonds (or GO 
bonds), which are fully backed by the state or municipality itself. More risky 

51
 Chapter 3: Making Sense of Asset Classes
are revenue bonds, which are issued by an agency, commission, or authority 
created by legislation in order to construct a facility, such as a toll bridge, 
turnpike, hospital, university dormitory, or port. The fees, taxes, or tolls 
charged for use of the facility ultimately pay off the debt. But regardless 
of the type of muni bond, they’re generally much less risky than corporate 
bonds (see the next section).
Corporate bonds
When a new business venture needs the money to get going, or an existing 
company is looking for the funds to expand, it turns to the private sector — 
you! — for help. There are literally dozens of types of corporate bonds, 
many featuring a convertible feature: The bond can be converted in shares 
of common stock or a call provision (the issuer can pay you back before the 
bond reaches maturity) like some of the other asset types we describe later 
in this chapter.
Although corporate bonds are generally the most lucrative of bonds, they’re 
also the riskiest — they’re backed only by the issuing corporation’s promise 
to pay. You can find corporate bonds with one-year terms, but terms can 
range up to 15 years or more.
The big upside on corporate bonds: usually higher yields than municipal 
bonds. The big downsides: the default risk — no company is completely insu-
lated against failure — and the fact that the interest payments on corporate 
bonds are taxable at all levels, from local to federal.
Getting familiar with bond mutual funds
Bond mutual funds (or bond funds for short) pay out periodic income by 
investing in bonds and other debt securities. They offer liquidity, stability, 
income, and diversification, which make these funds a very desirable choice 
among fixed-income investments. Usually, bond mutual funds pay out divi-
dends more frequently than individual bonds, and they pay higher dividends 
than money-market and savings accounts. Approximately 2,000 bond mutual 
funds are available.
Bond mutual funds are probably the easiest way for an investor to purchase 
a fixed-income investment — you can buy and sell them just like any mutual 
fund, instead of having to go through specialized bond dealers. You can 
also buy and sell them in any amount, whereas bonds are best purchased in 
large, even lots. Bond funds contain a basket of individual bonds, so you’re 
not overly exposed to the default risk of any one bond. And different types 
of bond funds allow you to narrow your focus to the part of the bond market 
you’re most interested in (for example, you can buy a fund of short-term New 
York State munis or long-term, high-rated corporates).
The big upside on bond mutual funds: diversification and ease of buying and 
selling. The big downside: no guaranteed payback at maturity, because bond 
funds have no maturity date.

52
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
Considering other types of fixed-income investments
There are a number of other types of fixed-income investments that you 
should be familiar with, because they’re so widely talked about.
 
Unless you’re an experienced investor, avoid these investments.
Mortgage-backed securities
A mortgage-backed security (MBS) is so named because the interest and 
principal payments from an underlying pool of mortgages are packaged and 
paid out as income to investors in the MBS. These securities are tantalizing 
with their promises of high returns — the riskier the mortgages financed, 
the higher the interest rewarded — but approach them with great caution 
because of their extreme sensitivity to mortgage rate fluctuations.
 
You may recall the credit crisis that erupted in 2007 and the ensuing wave of 
home foreclosures. The Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie 
Mae), the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), and the 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) issue most MBSs.
Ginnie Mae bonds are the most widely held and traded MBSs. Upsides to 
MBSs include guaranteed monthly payments and higher yields than Treasury 
investments with comparable maturities and liquidity. The big downside: pre-
payment risk. If mortgages are prepaid in full, you get back your investment 
prematurely, which may have to be reinvested at a lower rate.
Collateralized debt obligations
Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) are investment- or high-grade securi-
ties backed by a pool of bonds, loans, and other assets. These investments 
aren’t for the faint of heart. CDOs are sliced into levels of different types of 
debt and credit risk called tranches, and each tranche represents a different 
maturity and level of risk. So the higher the risk, the more CDOs pay. Because 
of losses linked to subprime home loans, demand for CDOs fell by as much as 
50 percent in 2008.
The upside: potentially higher returns than traditional bonds. The downside: 
considerable risk of loss.
Preferred stocks
Preferred stocks share characteristics of both debt and equity. The upside: 
a fixed dividend and priority over common stockholders in the event the 
company goes bankrupt. The downside: You don’t have voting rights as a 
shareholder, and there’s less potential for capital appreciation.

53
 Chapter 3: Making Sense of Asset Classes
Convertible bonds
As their name indicates, convertible bonds, which have been described as a 
bond with a stock option wrapped inside, can be converted into equity in the 
issuing company. Some types of convertible bonds can be converted at the 
option of the buyer; other types are converted by the seller automatically, 
when the underlying stock price reaches a certain value.
The upside: If the underlying value of the company stock increases sufficiently, 
bondholders can cash in their bonds and make a quick profit on the sale of the 
stock they receive in exchange. The downside: Because of their hybrid charac-
teristics, these bonds yield less than their issuer’s normal bonds.
Checking up on a bond issuer’s credit
When it comes to bonds, the ones that offer more safety also tend to offer 
lower yields. If you want to reach for higher returns from your bonds, you’ll 
most likely have to accept a higher risk of default.
 
Before buying a bond, be sure to check the bond issuer’s credit rating. It’ll 
give you an indication of the issuer’s ability to pay you back. We let you know 
how to conduct those checks in this section.
 
Keep in mind that all bonds carry some risk. There are two major types of risk 
associated with bonds, as follows:
 
✓ Interest rate risk is the risk that the bond’s value will vary because 
of changes in prevailing interest rates. This risk is of more concern to 
some investors than to others — investors who don’t intend to sell their 
bonds before maturity don’t care about market value fluctuations during 
the life of the bond.
 
✓ Default risk is the risk that the bond issuer may not make good on its 
promised coupon payments and/or payment of par value at maturity. 
All bondholders should be concerned at varying levels about default 
risk. Some bonds carry less default risk than others. U.S. government 
bonds (Treasuries), for example, are backed by the full faith and credit 
of the U.S. government and are considered the safest bonds in the world. 
General obligation municipal bonds are next in default risk safety, or 
creditworthiness.
In order to fully understand the default risk of a bond, you need to be able 
to recognize the letters you’ll see behind a bond investment before you buy. 
Letters signify credit ratings, indicating the quality of an issuing entity’s 
financial health — in other words, the issuer’s ability to pay you back. Bond 
ratings help you find out how risky it is for you to lend the issuer your 
money. Think of them as an institutional credit score.

54
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
 
More than half a dozen companies assess the financial strength of bond issuers, 
but three — Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch’s — represent 90 percent or 
more of the ratings market.
The higher the letter, or rating — the greater the possibility that you’ll get 
your money back. As a general guideline, long-term credit ratings get a triple 
A (AAA) for the highest credit quality, and a C or D for the lowest or “junk” 
quality. Within these parameters, there are different degrees. Table 3-1 pres-
ents rating symbols issued by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s.

Don’t gamble with the bonds in your portfolio. Play it safe and select 
investment-grade bonds with a credit rating of BBB to AAA.
 
Check the ratings of your bonds during the course of their terms. An upgrade 
or a downgrade can indicate changes in the issuer’s ability to pay and can sig-
nificantly change the bond’s market price, which will directly affect the money 
you’ll get if you sell the bond before maturity.
Laddering by maturity
Most of the time, the longer the term of a bond (the further out the maturity 
date), the higher the yield. To understand how interest rates compare, do what 
the financial experts do and look at the shape of the yield curve, which plots 
interest rates of bonds with equal credit quality, but differing maturity dates.

55
 Chapter 3: Making Sense of Asset Classes
In a normal yield curve (see Figure 3-2), longer-term maturity bonds will have 
a higher yield.
In an inverted yield curve (see Figure 3-3), the situation switches, and shorter-
term yields are higher. This happens only occasionally, usually when the 
bond market anticipates that yields are heading downward for the foresee-
able future. (Some pundits see an inverted yield curve as an early warning 
signal that the economy is headed into a recession.)
A flat yield curve (also called a hump curve; see Figure 3-4) shows shorter-and 
longer-term yields very close to each other.
The bigger the slope, the bigger the gap between short- and long-term rates. 
Regardless of the slope of the yield curve, longer-term bonds are subject to 
more risk — both interest rate risk and default risk.
One way to minimize these risks, as well as to get a range of yields, is to pur-
chase bonds (and/or bond funds) throughout the maturity spectrum, from 
short-term to long-term. This is called bond laddering.

 Chapter 3: Making Sense of Asset Classes
Capitalizing on cash and cash equivalents
Cash is legal tender that you can use to pay for goods or services, or to pay 
off debt. People hold cash and cash equivalents (more on those in a moment) 
in their portfolios for two main reasons:
 
✓ Instant liquidity: Instant liquidity is the ability to pay for goods or ser-
vices quickly. You can access cash immediately from a checking or sav-
ings account, or from an investment account that also doubles as your 
checking account, without having to sell a stock, bond, or other security.
 
✓ Stability: Unlike other asset classes such as stocks and bonds, cash is 
always worth its face value. You don’t have to worry about the market 
value of cash varying from its original value. If you have a $20 bill in 
your pocket in the morning, even if the stock market completely tanks 
that day, your $20 bill is still worth $20 at the end of the day — and a 
little more, too, if you put your cash in an account that earns interest. 
Stability can be very reassuring, especially during bear markets (when 
the market value of stocks is declining).
In our view, instant liquidity is the more compelling reason to hold cash in 
your portfolio, but only if you intend to make frequent withdrawals from your 
account. Stability is better served by short-term fixed-income investments, 
because fixed-income investments, such as bonds and bond funds, have a 
better chance of keeping up with inflation. (For more on fixed-income invest-
ments, see the “Getting a handle on fixed-income investments: Bonds, bond 
funds, and more” section, earlier in this chapter.)
 
Regardless of what we think, lots of investors hold cash in their portfolios for 
purposes of stability. Just remember that if you do, you need to be prepared 
to watch the true economic value of your cash erode over time as inflation 
nibbles away at its purchasing power, eating away at the ability of your cash 
to buy ever-more-expensive goods and services.
Cash equivalents are investments that mature in very short order (within a 
year, or even days or weeks or months) and can be easily converted into cash, 
without losing much money. Cash equivalents can include certificates of 
deposit (CDs), money-market deposit accounts, and money-market mutual 
funds. (Some people include short-term Treasury bills and notes as a form 
of cash equivalents, but we consider all Treasuries to be fixed-income 
investments.)

58
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
 
You don’t want to hold too much money in cash or cash equivalents, because 
money in these investments loses buying power over the long term as inflation 
eats away at precious principal. Think about money invested in cash equiva-
lents as savings you expect to use in the near future.
Certificates of deposit
Certificates of deposit (CDs) are offered by banks and other types of financial 
institutions, including credit unions, brokerage firms, and insurance com-
panies. CDs pay you a rate of interest in return for holding your cash for a 
specified period of time. They typically pay slightly higher interest rates than 
savings or money-market deposit accounts, but they aren’t as flexible as 
those accounts — you pay a penalty for early withdrawal.
Short-term CDs are offered from one month to one year. (CD terms can last 
for five years, but terms greater than one year aren’t really considered cash-
equivalent.) Because they tie up your cash for a specified period of time, CDs 
are slightly less useful than cash in terms of instant liquidity but they’re often 
a better provider of stability, because the rates of interest they pay can pro-
vide good inflation protection.
When you’re shopping around for CDs, think twice before buying a call-
able CD. With a callable CD, the seller can terminate (call) the investment 
before the maturity date. If that happens, you’ll be repaid in full for what you 
invested, but you won’t earn the interest you were expecting, and you may be 
faced with a lower interest rate on a replacement CD.
 
If you buy a CD through a brokerage firm, ask if the bank issuing the CD to 
the broker has Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance. If 
it doesn’t, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), a private 
insurer of the securities industry, will provide some insurance, but not at the 
level the FDIC guarantees.
 
To take advantage of a longer-term CD’s higher interest rate, split up your 
money and buy CDs with different due dates. This strategy, known as lad-
dering, will give you higher yields (as longer-term CDs generally pay higher 
interest than shorter-term CDs), while ensuring some access to your cash 
as shorter-term CDs come due. (We explain laddering in more detail in the 
“Laddering by maturity” section, earlier in this chapter.)
Money-market deposit accounts
Money-market deposit accounts get their name from the fact that a record of 
your deposits and withdrawals are kept by the banking institution where 
you opened the account. Money-market accounts pay interest, like a savings 
account, but they limit your check-writing privileges.

59
 Chapter 3: Making Sense of Asset Classes
These accounts are FDIC-protected, pay a higher interest rate than a regular 
bank savings account, and may offer rates that are competitive with CDs. 
Typically you must maintain an account balance above a certain minimum to 
qualify for the higher rates.
 
You may be able to link this account to your checking or savings account to 
lower your fees. Be sure to ask the bank where you have your checking or sav-
ings account about their money-market accounts.
Money-market mutual funds
You open money-market mutual funds directly with a mutual fund company, 
or through a bank or a brokerage firm. This is probably the most popular 
form of cash equivalent among serious investors, because the money-market 
mutual fund is tied to your investments at the same broker or mutual fund 
company. This way, dividend and interest payments from your other invest-
ments can be automatically swept into the money-market fund, as can 
proceeds from the sales of your other assets, and the funds can be used to 
quickly buy other investments through a phone call or online transaction.
Money-market mutual funds provide agility. Note that these funds, like all 
mutual funds, carry fees and expenses (but these are usually very modest). 
Also, there’s no FDIC insurance, because your money is invested in a mutual 
fund, not held at a bank.
 
You can protect yourself from the risk of losing money in a bank or savings 
association by taking two simple steps:
 
✓ Make sure that the FDIC insures the institution. To check whether your 
bank or savings association is insured, call the FDIC at 877-275-3342, go 
to www.fdic.gov/deposit/index.html and click Bank Find, or look 
for the agency’s official logo where deposits are received.
 
✓ Make sure that your deposits don’t exceed the limits of federal deposit 
insurance. Basic insurance is $100,000 for an individual account, per 
depositor, per bank. (Note: In 2008, Congress temporarily raised the 
limits to $250,000 through December 31, 2009.) The FDIC provides sepa-
rate coverage for accounts held in other categories (certain retirement, 
joint, and revocable trust). For more information on limits, contact 
the FDIC at 877-275-3342 or calculate your coverage using the agency’s 
Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator (www2.fdic.gov/edie).

Understanding Alternative Investments
Although cash, fixed income, and equity investments are the big three, other 
options do exist. Taken together, these other asset types are called alterna-
tive investments. We describe them in more detail in Chapter 13, but this 
section is a brief introduction to complete our discussion of asset classes. At 
the end of this section, we also offer some insight into when you’ll want to 
include these asset alternatives in your portfolio.
Looking at your options for 
alternative investments
A number of investment options are characterized as alternative investments. 
Some are quite exotic and are for very seasoned and sophisticated investors 
only. In this section, we focus on three groups of alternative investments that 
most investors can easily access: real estate, hard assets, and hedge funds.
Investment real estate
Most investors with a sizeable investment portfolio will own at least a portion 
of their primary residence. If you own your primary residence, that means it’s 
a use asset, because you own it for purposes of using it (to live in) rather than 
to simply hold it. Although the equity in your home is an important part of 
your overall net worth, most experts agree that use assets shouldn’t be con-
sidered part of your investment portfolio.
However, invested real estate assets can be part of your portfolio, and these 
include such things as rental property, apartment complexes, office build-
ings, warehouses, storage facilities, retail malls, and vacant lots. The most 
efficient way to own this type of property is through real estate investment 
trusts (REITs). If you want to get your hands on more information about 
REITs right away, turn to Chapter 13, where we discuss alternative invest-
ments in a lot more detail.
Hard assets (commodities)
Most of what you find in a portfolio are financial assets, represented by 
pieces of paper of one sort or another, such as stocks and bonds. There are 
other assets, called hard assets that include such items as oil, gas, metals, tex-
tiles, foodstuffs, and livestock.

61
 Chapter 3: Making Sense of Asset Classes
Although it’s possible to own these hard assets directly, most investors buy 
futures (a financial contract under which a buyer or seller agrees to buy or 
sell the underlying hard assets at an agreed-upon future date and price). 
Futures allow the investor’s fortunes to rise and fall with the value of the 
hard asset, without taking possession of the asset itself — which is a good 
thing, because if you’re like most investors, you don’t really have room to 
store oil, gold, or pork bellies. (You’d need a pretty big freezer to hold pork 
bellies in your portfolio the old-fashioned way.) Thus, hard assets are com-
monly held as financial assets after all, even though they behave much differ-
ently than most other financial assets. (For more information on hard assets, 
check out Chapter 13.)
Hedge funds
Hedge funds are actively managed portfolios of investments typically set up 
as private investment partnerships. Originally, they were designed for very 
sophisticated investors as a way to make bets that hedged (reduced the risk) 
of the positions they held in the rest of their portfolios (hence, their name). 
Over time, however, the limited purpose and defensive nature of these invest-
ments evolved, and now there’s a wide array of exotic alternatives — some 
quite aggressive and speculative — that has become available to the average 
investor.
Hedge funds fall into a number of categories called strategies, such as long/
short, global macro, distressed debt, and convertible arbitrage. We discuss 
hedge funds in more detail in Chapter 13.
Knowing when to add alternative 
investments to your portfolio
Want to know when you should consider adding alternative investments to 
your investment portfolio? The timing will be right when the following are true:
 
✓ You have the stomach to tolerate their unusual behavior. You have to 
be able to go with the flow and ride the emotional roller coaster ride that 
accompanies the thrill of owning these less-than-orthodox investments.
 
✓ You know you’ll have the time to vigilantly monitor them. The market 
value of these investments can change abruptly, and you (or your advi-
sor) will need to be quick on your feet to be able to exploit the opportu-
nities that this volatility creates.

By themselves, commodities, hedge funds, and other types of alternative 
investments can scare the heck out of you. But, paradoxically, when added to 
a portfolio in the right proportions, they can make a portfolio not only better, 
but safer. Turn to Chapter 4 to understand how something that looks as if 
it can break you will actually help improve your portfolio, when included in 
the right proportions. If you want to really get the ball rolling on alternative 
investment opportunities, check out Chapter 13.
Going Global with International 
Investments
We operate in a truly global economy. The values of assets in the United 
States are inextricably tied to what’s going on in the rest of the world. The 
demand for raw materials in burgeoning economies such as India and China 
influences the supply and the pricing of those materials in virtually every 
other economy, including the U.S. The desire for U.S. Treasuries by central 
banks in many other countries influences the pricing and, thus, the yield of 
those securities here at home. The international connections go on and on. 
In light of these interrelationships, it seems natural to include internationally 
flavored assets in your portfolio.
In earlier times, before the economies around the world became as inter-
twined as they now are, owning international equities (stocks and stock 
funds) was a way to add diversification to a portfolio. Now, however, these 
equities tend to rise and fall with domestic equities, all but eliminating their 
diversification value. But they remain advisable investments because their 
value is often denominated in foreign currency and so they provide a hedge 
against the value of the dollar. (This is a large part of the reason international 
equities did so well in the early years of the 21st century.) Regardless of your 
feelings about the direction of the dollar, you should consider international 
investments simply because there’s no reason, in today’s global economy, to 
confine yourself to purely domestic investments.
International investments are usually characterized by whether they’re 
located in countries that are considered developed or emerging:
 
✓ Investing in developed countries: Developed countries represent rela-
tively advanced economies. Most of Western Europe and Japan (the 
so-called EAFA — Europe, Asia, and the Far East — countries) are devel-
oped countries with sophisticated economies. The equity investments 
in companies of these countries are closely correlated to those in the 
United States, and they’re less volatile than their counterparts in less 
developed countries. For these reasons, they’re only a minor step in the 
direction of going more global.

63
 Chapter 3: Making Sense of Asset Classes
 
✓ Investing in emerging markets: Sometimes also called developing coun-
tries, emerging markets can be found in countries with less advanced 
economies than what you find in the developed part of the world. 
Emerging markets include those in Latin America and Asia (the so-called 
BRIC countries — Brazil, Russia, India, and China). Equity investments 
here are less correlated to the U.S., but they’re becoming more so every 
day. These equities can be quite volatile. If you have the stomach for 
their erratic ride and you can handle the associated risk, they represent 
the more emphatic way to expand beyond domestic borders.
You have various vehicles to choose from if you want to invest internation-
ally. You can invest in the equities of foreign companies directly, either by 
buying their stock on foreign exchanges or through American Depository 
Receipts (ADRs) issued on U.S. stock exchanges. The latter is much safer 
than the former, because foreign exchanges are not yet as liquid or as deep 
(in terms of number of participants) as domestic markets. You buy ADRs the 
same way you buy regular stocks.
In some emerging markets, there’s also the risk of the government national-
izing the assets on their own exchanges, in which case you could lose your 
entire investment. You can mitigate this risk and still participate in the 
growth opportunities in such countries as India and China indirectly, through 
investing in U.S.-based multinational companies with big growth plans in 
those developing countries. These plans are usually spelled out in the annual 
reports of those companies, which you can find on the companies’ Web sites.
You can invest in overseas real estate through international REITs (see the 
“Investment real estate” section earlier or check out Chapter 13 for more 
information on REITs).
And you can invest in mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs — see 
Chapter 9) that track country-specific or region-specific indexes (for example, 
EAFA, BRIC, or emerging markets). Some of these funds can be quite narrowly 
defined, allowing you, for example, to invest in certain industry sectors in 
certain regions.
All in all, there is a multitude of ways to invest globally, and the choices are 
becoming more plentiful every day. Through some combination of these 
global investment opportunities, you ought to have a healthy dose of non-
U.S. exposure in your portfolio. For conservative investors, the percentage 
may be 10 percent to 15 percent; for aggressive investors, 30 percent to 50 
percent. Talk to your advisor or broker for more information on how to go 
global.

Your Asset Mix
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the importance of asset allocation
▶ Getting a grip on correlation and its potential power
▶ Taming risk drag
▶ Getting your portfolio to deliver more than the sum of its parts
▶ Discovering what to look for in an asset
I
n this chapter, we explain why asset allocation — selecting your assets 
and mixing them together correctly — is the single most important thing 
you can do in investing. And we introduce what we call our guiding principle 
of asset allocation, to help direct your actions as you build your portfolio.
We address diversification — but also make clear that diversification alone 
isn’t enough. We go further in this chapter to help you uncover and use the 
secret of negative correlation to your benefit. Negative correlation is consid-
ered the holy grail of investing — it’s hard to find, but it can produce almost 
mystical qualities in a portfolio. If you can identify assets with good long-term 
growth potential, but whose short-term up-and-down movements essentially 
cancel each other out, then you may be able to create a portfolio that will 
outperform each of the assets within it!
Throughout this chapter, we reveal the underlying concepts of asset alloca-
tion. Without a solid understanding of asset allocation fundamentals and why 
they work, you may be tempted to make an unwise move with your portfolio — 
chasing a “hot” stock tip or following the lead of a friend who doesn’t under-
stand the big picture, for example. 
You don’t need to be an expert to have better investment results than most 
other investors. You simply need to start with a reasonably informed asset 
allocation and have the discipline to stick with it. So read on to empower 
yourself with the knowledge of the pros!

Putting the 90 Percent Solution 
to Work for You
Lots of forces and factors can influence how well your investment portfolio 
performs. Here are just a few of the most significant possibilities:
 
✓ The state of the U.S. economy: Is it expanding? Contracting? In recession? 
In recovery? Changes in the broader global economy are also important.
 
✓ The activities and decisions of the Federal Reserve Board: The Federal 
Reserve Board is responsible for setting the country’s economic policy 
and managing the U.S. money supply — not what you’d call a minor role.
 
✓ The growth — or lack thereof — of corporate earnings: Corporate 
earnings are tricky because the real bottom line can be easily masked 
with a lot of the wrong information.
 
✓ The health of the bond and equity markets: These markets move in 
unpredictable ways — sometimes together and sometimes not.
And there are several other additional influencing factors:
 
✓ The condition of the domestic and international real-estate markets
 
✓ The cost of energy — oil, gas, and emerging substitutes
 
✓ The level of inflation and its trend
 
✓ The income-tax code and changes in it
 
✓ The quality of the individual securities you select for your portfolio
Which factor matters the most in determining the performance of your port-
folio? It’s a trick question. All the factors on this list have some impact, but 
the most critical factor isn’t on the list at all.
According to a 1986 study by Gary Brinson, L. Randolph Hood, and Gilbert 
Beebower (the so-called BHB Study) and much subsequent corroborating 
research, there’s only one short answer to what explains the vast majority — 
over 90 percent — of the difference in returns among various portfolios: 
asset allocation. Asset allocation, in essence, is selecting the right asset 
classes for your portfolio, and mixing them together in the right proportions.
 
With the right asset allocation, you can help insulate your portfolio against the 
fluctuations of most of the outside factors in the preceding lists. With the right 
asset allocation, you can even overcome some bad stock picks that you may 
have made (as long as you didn’t make too many of them), so you can worry 
just a little bit less about those 200 shares of the glow-in-the-dark sunglasses 
company you bought in the late ’90s. With the right asset allocation, you’re 
already 90 percent of the way home.

67
 Chapter 4: Determining the Right Proportions: Your Asset Mix
Understanding asset allocation will make it harder for you to make mistakes 
down the road. But when you dig into asset allocation, you have to commit 
to the approach, even though it may seem counterintuitive to you and con-
trarian to your friends. Asset allocation will make you savvier than the vast 
majority of individual investors out there. And, if decades and decades of 
history is any indication, asset allocation will help you do better than most of 
those investors over the long term.
Keeping your eye on the important 
90 percent: Allocating your assets
By far the most important thing you can do to achieve success in invest-
ing is to get your portfolio’s asset allocation mix right. This is the top-down 
approach — the approach that we advocate throughout this book. It starts 
with an overall investment strategy, which we discuss in more detail in 
Chapter 7.
A well-put-together investment strategy connects with your long-term 
financial objectives, your return requirements, your tolerance for risk, your 
cash-flow needs, your tax situation, your constraints, and any special consid-
erations you may have (see Chapter 6). This overall strategy then dictates 
your asset allocation. This approach is scientific, well reasoned, time tested, 
and coherent. By comparison, the bottom-up stock-picking approach (see the 
next section) is almost as bad as gambling. It’s far less reliable than the asset 
allocation path.
Avoiding focusing on the other 10 percent
Would you spend most of your time and effort chasing something that may 
get you 10 percent of the way to your goal? Of course not! But that’s what 
many novice investors do when they expend massive amounts of effort to 
build a portfolio based on stock picking. They focus on that one tantalizing 
aspect of investing when there is a much superior and more comprehensive 
strategy to consider.
What makes people focus on stock picking — that measly 10 percent of 
investing? It’s simple: They can make money — a lot of money. If you were 
fortunate enough to buy into a fledgling software company named Microsoft 
back in the mid-’80s, by now you’d probably be a die-hard supporter of stock 
picking. But there are many more stories of failure and loss on the stock 
markets that you never hear about, and that’s one reason that the stigma sur-
rounding stock picking hasn’t grown larger over time.

68
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
 
Building a portfolio by picking stocks and/or other securities without regard 
to the asset allocation that’s created when you’re done is a losing proposition. 
This is often called the bottom-up approach to investing. It’s not guided by an 
overarching strategy. It’s merely a collection of individual ideas with little or 
no consideration of how the pieces relate to each other. Investors who sub-
scribe to the bottom-up approach consistently underperform the market aver-
ages over the long term.
Embracing asset allocation’s 
guiding principle
 
As you begin (or continue) to make your decisions about asset mix, always 
keep in mind the following guiding principle of asset allocation:
The characteristics and behavior of any single asset in isolation are 
inconsequential. What really matters is the asset’s effect on your portfo-
lio in its entirety.
 
To make sure you’re really getting the most out of the asset allocation 
approach to investing, ask yourself the following question when you’re consid-
ering an investment: Is my portfolio better or worse with this asset in it? Don’t 
just think about the quality of the investment by itself — consider it alongside 
the other investments in your portfolio.
Figuring out which assets will be productive in your portfolio and which ones 
will be poison can be a tricky task. To check out a few examples of how that 
works, flip ahead to Chapter 8.
Laying the Foundation for Successful 
Asset Allocation
The secret behind asset allocation begins with diversification, which means 
that you don’t put all your investment eggs into one basket. But that isn’t all 
there is to it. It’s not enough to simply avoid being concentrated in too few 
holdings. You have to spread your eggs around — and pick your baskets — 
with a broader strategy in mind.
In this section, we explain the interconnectedness of investments and how 
you can build a more sound portfolio if you strive to avoid those connec-
tions. We help you to think about how you can select your investments in a 
way that insulates your portfolio from problems and tumultuous changes in 
the U.S. and global economies.

69
 Chapter 4: Determining the Right Proportions: Your Asset Mix
Understanding correlation
To help us illustrate how the relationships between investments can have a 
major influence on the success of your portfolio, we’ll start with an example. 
Say you decided to get into investing, but you never came across a wonderful 
book called Asset Allocation For Dummies. You hear that a friend of a friend 
has made a killing on the stock market in the last year or so — with little or 
no previous experience — and you guess that you could probably do the 
same. So you study up for a week or so, and you decide that Apache, Baker 
Hughes, Chevron, and Exxon are promising stocks, and you buy shares of 
each. Then you come across some reliable research saying that a mutual 
fund that tracks a commodity index is a wonderful opportunity. (Tracking 
means that the mutual fund moves in the same direction, by the same 
amount, at the same time, as the index.) So you fill out your portfolio with 
this fund and sit back and wait for the stacks of money to start rolling in.
To a casual observer, your portfolio looks diversified. But to the practiced 
eye, your portfolio has a terrible asset allocation. Why? Because if the price 
of oil declines, your entire portfolio will be in deep trouble. All your holdings 
are extremely sensitive to oil prices and you have absolutely nothing in place 
to offset this overdependence.
 
To achieve balance in your portfolio — that is, to minimize risk and maxi-
mize return — you need to embrace the concept of correlation, which, simply 
defined, is the way that investments in a portfolio relate to each other. More 
precisely, correlation is a measure that indicates the strength and direction of 
the linear relationship between two sets of values.
Correlation is measured by the correlation coefficient, though this measure is 
often referred to simply as correlation. (The formula used to determine cor-
relation coefficients is beyond the scope of this book, but you can find it in 
Statistics For Dummies, by Deborah Rumsey, PhD [Wiley], if you find yourself 
with a hankering for that sort of thing.) Correlation coefficients range along 
a continuum from 1 to –1, with 1 (at one extreme) indicating perfect positive 
correlation, –1 (at the other extreme) indicating perfect negative correlation, 
and 0 (in the middle) indicating no correlation at all.
Here’s an example of perfect positive correlation: When you’re sitting at your 
computer and you move your mouse, the cursor on your screen moves in 
the same direction. Move the mouse right, the cursor moves right; move it 
left, the cursor moves left; move it a short distance, the cursor moves a little; 
move it more, the cursor moves farther. The movement of the mouse and the 
movement of the cursor have a perfect positive correlation of 1 with each 
other, because the motion of the second exactly corresponds, in magnitude 
and direction, to the motion of the first. There’s an exact, and positive, linear 
relationship between the two; in other words, they move in lockstep with 
each other, in the same direction at the same time.

70
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
For an example of perfect negative correlation, pretend that you’re playing 
a game of coin toss with your friend and the stakes are a penny a toss — 
heads, you win a penny from him; tails, he wins one from you. If you were to 
examine your wealth and his after each coin toss, you’d find that they have a 
perfect negative correlation of –1 — whenever you’re up, he’s down the exact 
amount at the same time, without fail. There’s an exact, and negative, linear 
relationship between your respective states of wealth; in other words, as one 
value moves up or down, the other value moves by an equal amount in the 
opposite direction.
For our final example, if two sets of values have absolutely no connection 
with each other — stock market returns and your uncle’s waistline, say — 
then you can expect their correlation to be zero.
But how does this correlation business apply to asset allocation? It’s simple: 
You want to populate your portfolio with assets that have low — close to 0, 
or even negative — correlation with each other. That’s how you unleash the 
power of asset allocation, as we discuss in the following sections.
Discovering the appeal of 
non-correlated assets
As you can tell by the example of the oil-dependent portfolio we use earlier 
in this chapter, having a selection of investments in your portfolio that are 
highly positively correlated with each other doesn’t do you any good. In fact, 
too many of these investments can be very dangerous.
The solution? Select holdings that have poor correlation with one another — 
in fact, the poorer, the better. These assets won’t move in the same direc-
tion at the same time. Sure, one may be down at a certain point in time, but 
chances are, the others will be steady or even up.
 
Strive for poor correlation when selecting your investments, and you’ll go a 
long way toward spreading your risk and increasing the likelihood of a steady 
portfolio return.
Understanding non-correlated assets
Say you have a portfolio with a sizeable amount of equity investments 
(stocks and/or stock funds — see Chapter 3 for more information). Consider 
for a moment what may cause your equity investments to hit a rough spot — 
what may cause their value to decline. One possibility is an unexpected 
rise in inflation. Higher-than-anticipated inflation is bad news for just about 
everybody. Companies’ earnings may be hit hard due to the rise in the cost 

71
 Chapter 4: Determining the Right Proportions: Your Asset Mix
of their raw materials, and they may not be able to pass along their higher 
costs to their customers. The companies’ customers may buy less of what 
the companies are selling, because inflation in the other things they have to 
buy has eaten away at their budget. And potential investors in the companies 
will discount the companies’ future earnings and dividend stream because 
those future payments will have less purchasing power than originally antici-
pated. This kind of inflation spike can wreak havoc on equity investments of 
all sizes, styles, and sectors, making it hard to find a safe haven. So, what can 
you do?
First, take a step back and review the broader landscape. What is inflation? 
What does it measure? In large part, it basically measures the change in cost 
of a basket of raw materials (commodities). When inflation spikes, it means 
the cost of that commodity basket spiked up. Wouldn’t it have been nice to 
have had something in your portfolio that spiked up when inflation did, to 
offset the drop in the value of your equity investments?
You’re in luck! Such a thing exists — you can invest in a fund that tracks the 
cost of a broad basket of commodities, which can include oil, gas, precious 
metals, textiles, foodstuffs, livestock, and so on. (Chapter 13 gives you more 
information about commodity index funds.) Such an investment will tend to 
rise in value when inflation does, almost by definition. It’s an investment with 
very poor, even negative, correlation with your equity investments. In times 
of unexpected inflation spikes, it will help protect your equity-heavy portfolio 
from harm. This is one example of how assets with poor correlation can be a 
real boon for your portfolio.
Finding non-correlated assets
So, how do you find assets that have poor correlation with each other?
 
✓ You can look at the pattern of their returns over time (see, for example, 
the graphs of the returns for selected asset classes in Chapter 17). 
Assets with returns that tend to rise when others fall, and vice versa, are 
clear candidates.
 
✓ You can calculate the correlation of an asset with any other asset by 
using a financial calculator or the CORREL function in Microsoft Excel. 
Ask your financial advisor (see Chapter 16) for help if you need it. (For 
help with Excel, check out the edition of Excel For Dummies [Wiley] that 
corresponds to your version of Excel.)
To give you a head start, in Chapter 8, we illustrate some sample portfolios 
containing assets that are collectively poorly correlated with each other. For 
example, most portfolios should have a mix of bonds, stocks, real estate, and 
commodities.

72
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
 
Be wary of combining certain asset classes that are sometimes touted as 
having poor correlation with each other but are actually strongly correlated, 
such as:
 
✓ Growth stocks and value stocks
 
✓ Large-cap stocks and mid-cap stocks
 
✓ U.S. stocks and international stocks
You can read more about all these types of investments in Chapter 3.
Focusing on correlation, and looking for assets with poor correlation, is 
wonderfully effective — it works! A portfolio composed of poorly correlated 
assets (those with a low positive, or even negative, correlation with each 
other) will have considerable stability. All else being equal, such a portfolio 
will have much lower volatility — and higher long-term return — than one 
composed of highly correlated assets. Again, turn to Chapter 2 if you need to 
brush up on concepts like risk, return, and volatility, but keep reading in this 
chapter if you want to know more about the virtue of stability and the cost of 
volatility.
Realizing how 2 + 2 can equal 5 in your portfolio
One of the best parts about asset allocation is the way you can make your 
portfolio better than the sum of its parts. To help you understand how, take 
a look at Figure 4-1, which shows you the actual performance of two very 
common assets — stocks and real estate — over a recent 30-year period. 
These two assets are far from having perfect negative correlation with each 
other. (Flip back to the “Understanding correlation” section in this chapter 
for more information if you need it.) In fact, they’re slightly positively cor-
related; their correlation coefficient is 0.13 over this period. The important 
point is that, like a number of assets encountered in real life, they are not per-
fectly positively correlated — they don’t move in lockstep.
You’ll see that stocks are represented in Figure 4-1 by the S&P 500 Stock Index 
and real estate is represented by the FTSE NAREIT All REIT Index, a collection 
of real estate investment trusts (REITs), companies that own and typically oper-
ate income-producing real estate. Return is calculated as the 30-year com-
pound annual growth rate (assuming reinvestment of dividends); risk, as the 
annual standard deviation in the individual annual returns. (Refer to Chapter 
2 for an explanation of risk and return.) The asset labeled “Combined” is a 
simple portfolio consisting of a 50/50 allocation to stocks and real estate, 
rebalanced annually (see Chapter 5 for a discussion of rebalancing).
The figure plots each of these three assets on the risk/return map, which you 
can read about in Chapter 2. If you don’t want to flip back to that chapter right 
now, just keep in mind that, on the risk/return map, the best assets are those 
that appear farthest northwest because they have high return and low risk.

This simple two-asset example portfolio illustrates a truly remarkable phe-
nomenon: By combining assets with less-than-perfect positive correlation, 
you can get a portfolio with less risk than you would achieve with any one 
of the assets alone. Specifically, stocks have a standard deviation in excess 
of 16 percent; REITs, in excess of 24 percent. But the combined portfolio’s 
standard deviation is less than 16 percent. Nice, you’re saying, but is it really 
remarkable? Here’s the remarkable part: By combining these assets (and reg-
ularly rebalancing), you get a return for the portfolio that is greater than the 
return for any single asset within it! Although the return for stocks is about 
13.7 percent over this period, and the return for REITs is about 13.4 percent, 
the return for the combined portfolio is 14.5 percent!
Is this result a fluke of this particular 30-year period and these two particular 
assets? No. Similar phenomena have been reproduced through simulation 
analyses, and in Chapter 5 we further explore the reasons behind this phe-
nomenon. It doesn’t always happen, though. Determining the right assets to 
put into a portfolio, and the proper allocations among them, is a matter of 
considerable art and science. But we give you some guidelines on identifying 
the magic ingredients in the “Recognizing the Most Important Features of an 
Asset” section at the end of this chapter.
Making Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer work for your portfolio
A favorite Christmas tale tells the story of poor little Rudolph the Red-Nosed 
Reindeer. His nose is so bright, the rest of the herd snickers and laughs 

74
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
behind his back. But the very quality that makes him an outsider vaults him 
into a position of honor when Santa chooses him to guide his sleigh one espe-
cially foggy Christmas Eve.
It’s not likely that Rudolph’s story was created to provide a useful example 
for adult investors, but it just so happens that you can take quite a bit from 
the tale of the reindeer with the crimson schnoz. Rudolph’s oddball nose 
seemed like a liability until the context changed, and then all of a sudden it 
was a godsend. The same can be true for some assets. Sometimes a seem-
ingly inferior asset can do wonders for your portfolio, if the context is right.
If, for example, your existing portfolio enjoys a return of 14 percent and a risk 
(standard deviation) of 16-plus percent, would it make sense to add an asset 
whose return (13 percent) is worse, and whose risk is a whopping 24-plus per-
cent? Well, the earlier example from Figure 4-1 provides the answer. (In fact, 
it’s from this example that the just-cited risk/return percentages are taken!) 
Take as the existing portfolio the single-asset portfolio consisting of stocks. 
Take as the inferior asset real estate. Plainly, adding the inferior (REIT) asset 
to the (stock) portfolio improves it considerably. The portfolio’s risk went 
down to below 16 percent, and its return went up to well above 14 percent.
This is no isolated peculiarity. Examples abound of cases where an asset, 
itself no stellar performer, can improve both the risk and the return of the 
portfolio it’s added to.
Finding the holy grail of asset allocation: 
Perfect negative correlation
What’s even better than poor correlation among the investments in your 
portfolio? Perfect negative correlation, that’s what. If you can find two assets 
with a correlation of –1, then it doesn’t matter how volatile each one is. You 
can eliminate the volatility completely, at the portfolio level, simply by put-
ting both assets in your portfolio. Their volatilities cancel each other out; 
zero volatility is the result — and zero volatility is a very good thing indeed. 
As a practical matter, finding two assets with perfect negative correlation is 
next to impossible, but it’s important for you to come as close as you can.
For a visual representation of what we’re talking about, take a look at Table 4-1.
Consider two assets, A and B, each with a simple average annual return of 8 
percent over ten years. (Check out Chapter 2 for more information on simple 
average returns.) As is typical of most assets, Asset A and Asset B don’t come 
with a guaranteed 8 percent each year — the actual return is subject to quite 
a bit of variation from year to year.

Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
Asset B has twice as much volatility (measured by standard deviation, as 
defined in Chapter 2) as Asset A. You can see the damaging effect of volatil-
ity on your return if you note that the compound average return (the return 
that matters — see Chapter 2) is less than the simple average return for both 
assets. For Asset A, the compound average annual return is 7.8 percent; for 
Asset B, it’s 7.1 percent. Both are less than their simple average returns of 8 
percent, due to risk drag (another topic covered in Chapter 2).
If there existed an “ideal portfolio” that did return a guaranteed 8 percent 
each year, it would be much preferred to either Asset A or Asset B in Table 
4-1. In addition to the comfort of knowing that you could count on your 8 
percent return every year, you would actually be wealthier at the end of ten 
years with this ideal portfolio! (See the discussion of risk drag in Chapter 2 to 
better understand this result.)
You may be asking yourself, “Where can I get one of those ideal portfolios?” 
If you stare hard at Table 4-1, you’ll realize that it’s right under your nose. 
Hypothetically speaking, if Asset A and Asset B happen to be perfectly nega-
tively correlated with each other, the portfolio in Table 4-1 could be an ideal 
portfolio. In fact, you can construct this ideal portfolio by simply putting 
two-thirds of your investment in Asset A and one-third in Asset B (in inverse 
relationship to their standard deviations — recall that Asset B’s standard 
deviation is twice Asset A’s, so it gets half the allocation). If you maintain 
this two-thirds/one-third asset allocation each year through rebalancing (see 
Chapter 5), your return will be exactly 8 percent, each and every year, guar-
anteed. That would mean that your compound average return and simple 
average return would be equal, and your portfolio’s overall compound aver-
age return would be greater than that of either asset within it!
 
In all truthfulness, it’s highly unlikely that two assets with perfect negative 
correlation with each other will ever be found in the real world, but it’s not 
necessary for the relationship to be perfectly negative for there to be ben-
eficial effects in combining assets. You should be thrilled if you encounter 
investments that have negative correlations of –0.35 or so. Even positive cor-
relations below 0.2 are good.
Seeking stability and 
vanquishing volatility
As you work your way toward a successful system of asset allocation with 
your investment portfolio, you should always keep in mind that a high level 
of stability — or, equivalently, a low level of volatility — is an important char-
acteristic to seek out in a portfolio. Building a stable portfolio will provide 
you with solid, consistent returns (who doesn’t love that?), and cutting down 

77
 Chapter 4: Determining the Right Proportions: Your Asset Mix
on volatility will help you dodge the nasty effects of risk drag (see the pre-
ceding section and Chapter 2 for more on risk drag). In this section, we dig a 
little deeper into the importance of accentuating stability and cutting down 
on volatility.
Appreciating the virtue of stability
By stability, we mean steadiness in the return that your portfolio achieves 
from period to period. A nice stable return on your portfolio is a wonderful 
thing. For one thing, it saves you the aggravation of watching your invest-
ments behave erratically. It allows you to sleep better at night, slumbering 
peacefully while your portfolio earns you a steady, reliable return. The bene-
fits of such a well-behaved portfolio can’t be overstated; after all, your mental 
health is at least as important as your financial wealth. The last thing you 
want to see happen to your hard-earned assets is to have their market value 
ride an uncontrolled roller coaster up and down over the years.
But, in addition to helping you avoid a straightjacket, stability of return over 
time can also make you wealthier.
 
A stable return puts more money in your pocket over the long haul than a 
portfolio with returns that are way up one moment but way down the next.
You can see the benefits of a stable return in Table 4-1 and Table 4-2. In Table 
4-1, which we discuss in the “Finding the holy grail of asset allocation: Perfect 
negative correlation” section, we increased the compound average return 
from less than 8 percent (7.8 percent in the case of Asset A; 7.1 percent in the 
case of Asset B) to 8 percent by increasing stability through a clever combi-
nation of assets. In that case, stability — all by itself — created wealth.
In Table 4-2, you can see that Portfolio A, which is much more stable than 
Portfolio B, outperformed Portfolio B. This happened even though Portfolio 
A had a simple average return (8 percent) less than that of Portfolio B 
(9 percent).

Avoiding the cost of volatility
When it comes to your portfolio, stability is like love — you really can’t get 
too much of it. Volatility, on the other hand, is like a sunburn — even a little 
bit in your overall portfolio can really hurt! A portfolio with a very erratic 
return can cost you.
Look again at Table 4-2. Portfolio B could’ve been a winner. It had a simple 
average return of 9 percent, easily besting the 8 percent return of Portfolio 
A. But volatility did it in. The volatility of Portfolio B was so severe that its 9 
percent simple average return was savagely eroded. All those ups and downs 
eventually took their toll. In fact, its compound average return (not shown 
on the table, but easily calculated from the annual returns per the instruc-
tions in Chapter 2) is a lowly 7.6 percent, a mere shadow of the 9 percent it 
could’ve been. In contrast, Portfolio A’s simple average return of 8 percent 
wasn’t eroded at all — its stability allowed its compound average return 
(again, the one that really matters) to stay strong at 8 percent.

79
 Chapter 4: Determining the Right Proportions: Your Asset Mix
So, finding ways to reduce the volatility of your portfolio, while not sacrific-
ing its return, is a very worthwhile effort.
 
A portfolio should have a broad mix of investments. Make sure you include 
stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate, because those asset classes gen-
erally don’t move in the same direction at the same time. That strategy will 
help protect you from volatility.
Recognizing the Most Important 
Features of an Asset
So, what kind of assets do you really want in your portfolio? These choices 
are important, and you want to make sure you’re getting the most bang for 
your investment buck.
 
The assets you choose should have three things going for them:
 
✓ Healthy expected returns over the long haul.
 
✓ Sizeable volatilities: If you read the earlier sections in this chapter, the 
idea of striving for high volatility may shock you. But remember, it’s the 
volatility of the overall portfolio that you want to keep at a minimum, 
not necessarily the volatility of individual assets. If an individual asset 
has high volatility, it’s more likely to have a high expected return, as 
we point out in Chapter 2. Furthermore, if an individual asset has high 
volatility, it’s more likely that rebalancing (see Chapter 5) will have an 
additional, material, beneficial impact.
 
✓ Poor or even negative correlation with the other assets in your port-
folio: You can read all about correlation in the “Understanding correla-
tion,” “Discovering the appeal of non-correlated assets,” and “Finding 
the holy grail of asset allocation: Perfect negative correlation” sections, 
earlier in this chapter.
How do you find assets that have all three qualities? And how do you identify 
these properties for each asset? For any investment you consider, historical 
average returns and standard deviations (a good indicator of volatility) are typ-
ically included in the prospectus and other marketing material. Often, correla-
tions with common indexes are also presented, but here the information is far 
from complete. Your advisor can help you on that front — ask her to share her 
correlation analyses with you. (If she hasn’t done any, you may rightly ask what 
her recommended allocations are based on!) You can also refer to Chapter 8 
for more on our take on some assets that have these desirable properties.

Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
 
When deciding which assets to add to your portfolio, and in what proportions, 
don’t forget our guiding principle of asset allocation: The characteristics and 
behavior of any single asset in isolation are inconsequential — what really 
matters is the asset’s effect on your portfolio in its entirety. (Here again, 
Chapter 8 gives you a head start.)

Chapter 5
Stirring the Mix: Portfolio 
Rebalancing
In This Chapter
▶ Generating more return with no additional risk
▶ Understanding the basics of rebalancing
▶ Knowing when to rebalance your portfolio
A
sset allocation has an important partner called portfolio rebalancing. 
Rebalancing takes asset allocation to the next level, unlocking addi-
tional power that helps make your portfolio more profitable and less volatile.
In this chapter, we look closely at rebalancing. We explain that rebalancing 
supports the underlying intent of asset allocation; it doesn’t rethink it. In addi-
tion to helping you stay true to your asset allocation, rebalancing actually 
delivers better risk/return performance than a lazy buy-and-hold strategy.
You’ll find that it takes some intestinal fortitude to be a rebalancer. It 
requires going against your intuition and making changes to your portfolio 
that may seem nonsensical to your friends and counter to what the pundits 
on TV urge you to do. But you’ll see that it’s worth it. You’ll discover that, 
through rebalancing, you’ll be able to finally enjoy that free lunch you’ve 
been looking for all these years.
Understanding how to successfully rebalance your portfolio will enable you to 
exploit the power of the periodic table — the investment periodic table, not the 
one above the chalkboard in your high school chemistry class — and put the 
principle of volatility pumping to work for you. We cover both of these concepts 
in this chapter. And after you read all about them, it’ll be much easier for you 
to take on a contrarian mindset, which will then make it much easier for you to 
stick to the rebalancing process for increased returns over the long haul.
To finish up the chapter, we also provide a section that fills you in on exactly 
when you should look to rebalance your portfolio. Rebalancing correctly, 
and on the right schedule, will make sure you get all the benefit you can from 
your carefully considered asset allocation.

Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
Getting Your Free Lunch 
with Rebalancing
Because rebalancing offers huge benefits with little to no additional risk, we 
like to say that it’s the closest you’ll ever come to a free lunch in investing. 
Start rebalancing and belly up to the free-lunch counter!
To better understand what we mean, take a look at Figure 5-1. We start with 
two assets: stocks and real estate (specifically, real estate investment trusts, 
or REITs). Stocks are represented by the S&P 500 Stock Index; REITs, by the 
FTSE NAREIT All REIT Index. (We plot each of these two assets on the risk/
reward map introduced in Chapter 2, which is worth a look if you’re a little 
unsure of the relationship between risk and return.) Here, the return mea-
sure is the compound average annual return; risk is measured by the annual 
standard deviation of those returns. The data used for each index is for the 
30-year period from 1975 through 2004.
You can see that stocks had a return of about 13.7 percent and a standard 
deviation of a bit over 16 percent. REITs had a return of 13.4 percent and a 
standard deviation of roughly 24.5 percent. If you constructed a portfolio 
made up of a 50/50 weighting of stocks and real estate, and you held it for 
the entire 30-year period without rebalancing, you would’ve gotten a return 
halfway between the return of the two assets we started with (a little over 
13.5 percent), as you may expect. But the standard deviation of the combined 
portfolio turns out to be much less than midway between the standard devia-
tions of the two original assets. In fact, the standard deviation of 16 percent is 
slightly less than the standard deviation of stocks, and much less than that of 
REITs. This is due to the diversification benefit that we explain in Chapter 4.
Now, suppose that, instead of simply holding the 50/50 portfolio for 30 years, 
you rebalanced it every year. In other words, at the end of each year, if your 
portfolio had drifted away from its 50/50 weighting (which it typically did), 
you adjusted it back. If stocks grew faster than REITs one year, you sold 
enough stocks — and bought REITs with proceeds — to bring the weightings 
back to 50/50 (and vice versa, if REITs outgrew stocks in any year).
As you can see, the rebalanced portfolio ended up with a return of 14.5 per-
cent and a standard deviation of about 15.5 percent. This is vastly superior 
to the portfolio that was not rebalanced — it has a lower standard deviation 
and a considerably higher return.
You may be wondering how a difference of about 1 percent a year in return — 
14.5 percent versus 13.5 percent — can be termed considerable? Well, don’t 
forget the power of compounding. Over those 30 years, an original investment 
of $1,000 growing at 13.5 percent a year ends up being $44,656; the same $1,000 
growing at 14.5 percent a year becomes $58,098. That’s an extra $13,442 for 
every $1,000 invested! Not too shabby.

Not only is the return for the rebalanced portfolio higher than the combined 
return of the two assets without rebalancing, but it’s also higher than either 
asset alone. The rebalanced portfolio has a higher return than any of the 
assets within it. (And, don’t forget, the risk is lower, too.) This approach cre-
ates something from nothing. It’s alchemy. It’s finally getting that free lunch!
Understanding the Power of Rebalancing
Before we explain the ins and outs of rebalancing it’s important that we 
define the term, because there are some common misperceptions out there 
about rebalancing.
Rebalancing involves the buying and selling of various investments within 
your portfolio to achieve a certain allocation by asset class. Does this repre-
sent a change in your investment strategy, or a rethinking of your long-term 
asset allocation? No, and no again! In fact, it’s just the opposite.
First, as we discuss in detail in Chapter 4, you establish your investment port-
folio according to an overall strategic allocation to three broad asset classes 
(fixed-income, equity, and alternative investments). Within each of those 
broad classes, you then adhere to a more refined allocation scheme that 

84
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
establishes, for example, how fixed-income investments should be spread 
among various maturities, and how equity investments should be spread 
among various industry sectors.
After you set up your portfolio, you’ll find that your actual allocation on any 
given day thereafter is subject to the ups and downs of the market. Your allo-
cation changes when some investments increase or decrease in value more 
or less than the others in your portfolio. Over time, your allocation may drift 
quite far away from what you originally intended. When that happens, it’s 
time to restore order. Rebalancing is what you do to get your portfolio back 
in order — back to its target asset allocation.
This section tells you all you need to know about how rebalancing works and 
how you can make it work for you!
 
Rebalancing doesn’t mean reallocating. It means resetting your portfolio back 
to its target asset allocation, which can actually increase your portfolio’s 
return. If you diligently rebalance, you can actually increase your portfolio’s 
return to a point higher than the return of any asset within it.
Left unattended, your portfolio will virtually always drift away from your target 
allocations — the market will see to that, as not everything in your portfolio will 
grow at the same rate. You need to be alert to this phenomenon and restore 
order by rebalancing. If you aren’t sufficiently vigilant and let your portfolio 
bubble away without paying attention, you’ll find that your investment mix will 
be not only different from what you intended, but also most likely riskier.
 
Why would an unattended portfolio end up riskier than you intended? Riskier 
investments tend to have higher returns (as we cover in Chapter 2). Assuming 
those returns are in the form of market appreciation, or are otherwise rein-
vested back into the investments that produced them, those riskier invest-
ments will tend to outgrow the lower-risk/lower-return investments in your 
portfolio. Over time, this will result in too much of these higher-risk/higher-
return investments in your portfolio. Why is that such a bad thing? Why would 
having too much high-return investments be something to avoid? Because, 
if you wanted the associated higher level of risk in your portfolio, there are 
better ways to achieve it. That is, you could have constructed a higher-risk 
portfolio in the first place that would likely produce a better return than one 
you arrived at purely by accident.
How rebalancing works: Unlocking 
the energy of the periodic table
To help you get a feel for how rebalancing works, start by taking a look at 
Figure 5-2, which is often referred to in investing circles as the periodic table. 
It does bear a resemblance to the chemists’ periodic table of the elements, 

85
 Chapter 5: Stirring the Mix: Portfolio Rebalancing
but don’t strain your eyes looking for the symbol for tungsten or the atomic 
weight of argon. This periodic table is different, and the direct relationship to 
periodic behavior (in investment terms) will become clearer in a moment.
Each column in Figure 5-2 represents a single calendar year. Within each 
column, several popular asset classes (bonds of varying maturities, real 
estate, commodities, and various equity sectors) are shown. For each asset 
class, you can see the total return (see Chapter 2) that that asset class deliv-
ered in each year. The asset classes are sorted from highest return to lowest 
return within each year. For example, in 1993, the total return for the technol-
ogy equity sector was 21.7 percent; for commodities, it was –12.3 percent. In 
2007, the total return for the energy sector was 34.4 percent; for the financial 
sector, –18.6 percent. Each of the asset classes is shaded so you can more 
easily track an asset class’s ranking from year to year.
Even after only a quick glance, you can see that there’s a substantial amount 
of random movement within the list. No asset class maintains its spot in the 
rankings for very long, and there’s no discernable pattern to how any one 
class moves up or down the list from year to year. (You can’t see it here, but 
at more frequent intervals than annual, the random movement is even more 
pronounced.) There’s simply a lot of volatility among asset classes in the 
market, and this movement is, in large part, unpredictable. All you can say 
for sure is that the leaders eventually become laggards, and vice versa.
 
This is due to a well-researched statistical phenomenon called reversion to 
the mean that you may have heard about. In short, it means that things can’t 
behave far above or below their long-term average level for very long; at some 
point, the hot (or cold) streak has to end and a period of underperformance 
(or overperformance) follows. The long-term average remains intact. This is 
true of every hitter in baseball, and it’s true in investing.
 
Some people (particularly those in the active-investing or market-timing 
school) try to predict the turning points for these asset classes and invest 
accordingly. You have to be incredibly smart — or just darned lucky — to get 
this timing right. Here’s a poorly kept secret: Nobody is that smart. But that 
hasn’t stopped people from trying. They tend to do better than average a little 
less than half the time, according to study after study. In other words, over 
any reasonable length of time, they underperform the market averages. Don’t 
buy into the market-timing hype. With regular rebalancing, you don’t have to 
predict the timing. And, over the long term, you’ll beat the active investing 
crowd.
 
What are the mechanics of rebalancing? You sell enough of the overweighted 
assets in your portfolio to bring them down to their target allocations, and 
use the proceeds to buy enough of the underweighted assets to bring them up 
to their targets. The custodian that holds your assets probably has an online 
rebalancing tool that you can use. You input your target allocations and it 
shows you how much you need to buy and sell of each asset class.

 Chapter 5: Stirring the Mix: Portfolio Rebalancing
Of course, if you have an investment advisor, she can do it for you — and 
should be doing so on a continual basis. If she isn’t, it may be time to find 
another advisor (see Chapter 16).
Here’s a specific example of how rebalancing works, based on the example 
presented in Figure 5-2: At the end of 2006, given the outperformance of real 
estate and the underperformance of commodities during that year, the rebal-
ancing angel on your shoulder would’ve prompted you to sell some of your 
real estate and buy more commodities. This would’ve paid off handsomely in 
2007, because those two asset classes essentially switched places in the rank-
ings. Other examples like this abound if you study the periodic table.
Does this always work? No. Getting back to the example in Figure 5-2, if you 
sold some energy at the end of 2004, it would’ve been too early, because it 
outperformed in 2005 as well. But the number of examples where it works 
outweigh the number of examples where it doesn’t (because of reversion 
to the mean). At worst, with rebalancing, you may trim your holdings in a 
winner a bit too early, but it’s virtually inevitable that it’ll become a relative 
loser before long, when it reverts to its long-term average behavior. Over 
the long term, letting rebalancing dictate when you load up or lighten up in 
an asset class is the winning strategy. Although it may not beat every other 
strategy each and every individual period, over a number of periods, it’ll 
outperform the guesswork of the market timers, and it’ll outperform doing 
nothing.
One way to view all the essentially random activity evident in the periodic 
table is to think of it as representing a lot of kinetic energy. The total returns 
for those assets are moving all the time. Here’s the crucial point: Rebalancing 
puts this energy to work for you. And it does so without having to take sides — 
without having to make a bet on which asset class will be the new “flavor of the 
month” at any point in time.
Making volatility work for 
you: Volatility pumping
There’s another way to view how rebalancing works. Figures 5-3 through 5-6 
illustrate a phenomenon called volatility pumping. When assets in a finely tuned 
portfolio are volatile, and you rebalance among them diligently, those assets 
act like the pistons in a finely tuned engine and “pump” — or generate — higher 
returns. Although volatility pumping is a very real phenomenon, the particular 
example used in these figures is a bit contrived, but it does a great job of show-
ing you the key points.
Let’s assume we have an asset, Asset A, with the ten-year return history 
shown in Table 5-1.

Figure 5-3 illustrates what would’ve happened to $100 invested in this asset 
at the beginning of the ten-year period. Clearly, this return history is quite 
volatile. You probably would’ve suffered through many sleepless nights if 
Asset A were the only asset in your portfolio.
Now, let’s assume that we have another asset, Asset B, with a return history 
over the same ten years shown in Table 5-2.

The volatility of Asset B’s return is identical to that of Asset A, but as you can 
see in Figure 5-4, it’s exactly countercyclical to Asset A, meaning that it has 
perfect negative correlation with Asset A. (If you read up on correlation in 
Chapter 4, you’ll know why it’s obvious that this example is contrived — that 
level of correlation would be a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon.)

Here, and throughout this book, we reference correlation coefficients without 
showing you the calculations. If you want to verify that the returns for assets 
A and B do indeed have a perfect –1 correlation coefficient, enter their 
sequence of returns into an Excel spreadsheet and run the CORREL function 
on them. (If you’re not familiar with Excel, check out the edition of Excel For 
Dummies [Wiley] that corresponds to your version of Excel.)
Is there a way to construct a portfolio so that you can reduce the return vola-
tility associated with these two assets? Yes! You could build your portfolio 
with a 50/50 weighting of assets A and B. Let’s assume you did that at the 
beginning of the ten-year period, and then you let the portfolio ride. In other 
words, you invested your $100 by putting $50 in Asset A and $50 in Asset B, 
and you did nothing else for ten years. Your result — the growth of your $100 
initial investment — is shown in Table 5-3.

In Year 1, the $50 in Asset A would’ve grown 20 percent to $60, and the $50 in 
Asset B would’ve stayed at $50, for a total portfolio value at the end of Year 1 
of $110. In Year 2, your $60 in Asset A would’ve shrunk 10 percent to $54, and 
the $50 in Asset B would’ve grown 30 percent to $65, for a total portfolio value 
at the end of Year 2 of $119. If you look at the graph of the growth of the 
50/50 portfolio in Figure 5-5, you can see it traces a nice smooth curve — the 

91
 Chapter 5: Stirring the Mix: Portfolio Rebalancing
jaggedness of the growth of Asset A and Asset B has disappeared. You’ve man-
aged to remove much of the volatility of your returns. You would have been 
able to sleep much better over the ten years had you held this portfolio.
But even though your sleeping patterns would’ve improved, you still 
would’ve missed an opportunity. Because the 50/50 portfolio ended up at 
$225, just as Asset A and Asset B did on their own, the ten-year return on 
your portfolio is no better than the return of either asset by itself. It’s as if 
you put Asset A in one pocket, put Asset B in another pocket, and never took 
advantage of the fact that the pockets were in the same pair of pants.
Now, what would’ve happened if, instead of letting your 50/50 portfolio 
simply ride, you rebalanced it back to 50/50 each and every year?
For example, in Year 1, the $50 invested in Asset A would’ve grown 20 percent 
to $60; the $50 in Asset B would’ve stayed at $50. At that point, your portfolio 
wouldn’t be in 50/50 balance, so at the end of Year 1, you would’ve rebalanced 
by selling $5 of Asset A and buying $5 more of Asset B with the proceeds. You 
would, therefore, have begun Year 2 with $55 in each asset, and the 50/50 
rebalance would be restored. If you rebalanced that way for each of the rest 
of the nine years, you would’ve ended up in a situation like the one shown 
in Table 5-4 and Figure 5-6. You would’ve ended up considerably wealthier, 
with $259 instead of $225. And the volatility of your returns would’ve been 
exactly zero, meaning that your return would’ve been a constant 10 percent 
each year. That’s a win-win. It’s the power of volatility pumping — that’s what 
rebalancing can do for you.

 Chapter 5: Stirring the Mix: Portfolio Rebalancing
Memorizing the mantra: How rebalancing 
forces you to buy low and sell high
At its simplest, rebalancing is a discipline you impose on yourself to dispas-
sionately buy low and sell high, with ruthless regularity. Will you always 
manage to sell out of an asset at its absolute peak, and buy into an asset at 
its absolute bottom? No. But you’ll be close enough. And you’ll be forced to 
do it often enough to get a material benefit over the long term. (For more 
information on how often is often enough, skip ahead to “Following the Right 
Rebalancing Schedule,” later in this chapter.)
Everybody knows that buying low and selling high is a good thing. The ben-
efits don’t really need to be explained. But buying low and selling high has 
benefits beyond the obvious. When you trim your holdings in a winner before 
it becomes a loser, that means you’ll have less at stake in that asset and will 
suffer a smaller loss than you would’ve otherwise. Similarly, increasing your 
stake in a loser before it becomes a winner amplifies your eventual winnings. 
The hits just keep on comin’!
Rebalancing is really the antidote to the urge to engage in active investing 
or dabble in market timing. It doesn’t require you to have a crystal ball. It 
doesn’t require you to be able to correctly pick winners, losers, and turning 
points. It simply requires you to shove emotion to the side, where it belongs, 
and to have the fortitude to be a contrarian when it makes sense, no matter 
who knows it.
 
Rebalancing imposes a discipline that essentially forces you to buy low and 
sell high — the goal of any winning investment strategy.
Being a contrarian: Making sure you have 
the right mindset for rebalancing
Rebalancing can sound simple, but in reality it’s very hard to do — not 
because it’s technically difficult, but because it’s counterintuitive. When 
you rebalance, you may be considered a contrarian because you’ll be doing 
exactly the opposite of what your friends are doing and what the news media 
are telling you to do. You’ll be selling out of your hottest investments. Worse, 
you’ll be buying more of the investments that have been the coldest, and may 
have even been losing money for you. This isn’t an easy thing for most inves-
tors to do. It’s painful. But successful investors learn to leave their feelings out 
of the equation and let the science of probabilities work to their advantage.

94
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
As you rebalance, selling some of your winners and buying more of your 
losers, you’ll get the undeniable feeling that you’re making a big mistake. 
Plus, you’ll be constantly bombarded with newspaper stories and television 
and radio commentary touting the glories of the investment you just sold a 
big chunk of, and pooh-poohing the investment you just loaded up on. And, 
to the extent you share your investing activities with your friends and family, 
they may also think you’re making some questionable decisions, and they 
may not be shy about telling you so.
The pain is worth it. But how do you stand it? Remind yourself of these facts:
 
✓ Rebalancing is a scientific, time-tested, reliably reproducible way to 
get extra return while at the same time controlling your risk. It’s based 
on sound economic fundamentals and rooted in well-established statisti-
cal theory.
 
✓ Rebalancing doesn’t rely on hot tips or fads, which aren’t a good 
way to inform your investing strategy in the first place. By the time 
investment advice makes its way to the general press, it’s almost always 
already too late to act on it. If it’s in the papers, it’s already in the price. 
So, unless you can get wind of the headlines several weeks in advance, 
don’t base your investment decisions on what you read in or hear from 
those sources. More generally, never let unsolicited advice from sources 
that really don’t care if you do well or not sway you from your path.
 
✓ The most successful and sophisticated professional money managers 
engage in rebalancing. Reassure yourself with that knowledge. Your 
friends and family may think you’re a bit wacky when you begin to rebal-
ance, but in most cases they haven’t done the research and analysis nec-
essary to refute decades of the best research and analysis the finance 
community has to offer. The professionals are rebalancing, and there’s 
no reason that you can’t do it, too.
 
Rebalancing may make you seem like a contrarian to those around you, but 
it’ll likely help make you richer in the long run than those who invest less 
scientifically.
Following the Right Rebalancing 
Schedule
All the other sections in this chapter should convince you that it’s smart to 
rebalance, but how often should you do it? If you do it too often, you’ll sell 
your rising assets too early, before they peak. You’ll also invest in falling 
assets too early, before they bottom out. And you’ll spend too much money 

95
 Chapter 5: Stirring the Mix: Portfolio Rebalancing
on transaction costs. If you rebalance too seldom, you’ll ride your winners 
too long, after they peak and become losers. You’ll also let your portfolio 
drift away from its intended asset allocation, with the harmful effects we 
describe at the beginning of this chapter.
You need to schedule your rebalancing efforts wisely, and in this section we 
tell you how to do just that.
Rebalancing on fixed calendar dates
One approach is to rebalance on a fixed schedule — once a year, for example. 
Annual rebalancing is quite popular, because it’s not overly burdensome, and 
it’s easy to remember, particularly if you do it in concert with another annual 
event, like celebrating your birthday or filing your income-tax return.
For most portfolios, rebalancing once a year isn’t often enough to take advan-
tage of market changes. For the average investor looking to rebalance on spe-
cific calendar dates, it’s reasonable to rebalance about three times a year, or 
every four months; a little less often if your portfolio is under about $500,000, 
and a little more often if your portfolio is an aggressive one, with lots of vola-
tile investments in it.
But there’s a better approach than rebalancing on a fixed schedule, as we 
describe in the next section.
Planning your rebalancing for 
the greatest opportunity
The best schedule for rebalancing your portfolio is one that you can’t 
set in advance. It’s the schedule that’s triggered by your portfolio itself. 
Specifically, you rebalance when your portfolio drifts too far away from its 
intended allocation.
But how far is too far? There’s no universally applicable, perfect answer, 
but you can’t go too far wrong if you set your tolerance (the amount of drift 
you’re willing to tolerate) at ±20 percent around your target allocation for 
each asset class. For example, if your target allocation to a particular asset 
class is 10 percent, then ±20 percent of that target is ±2 percent (0.10 × 0.20 = 
0.02). In that case you’d rebalance if that asset class drifts above 12 percent 
or below 8 percent of your total portfolio. If another asset class has a target 
allocation of 5 percent, then ±20 percent of that target is ±1 percent (0.05 × 
0.20 = 0.01), so you’d rebalance if that class drifted outside of a range of 4 
percent to 6 percent of your total portfolio.

96
Part I: Discovering the Not-So-Secret Recipe for Asset Allocation 
You’ll need to monitor your portfolio frequently to determine if any of your 
asset classes have drifted outside their tolerance bands. But that doesn’t 
mean you’ll be rebalancing frequently. There may be some years during 
which you won’t rebalance at all, if the markets are tame. If markets are 
tumultuous, though, you may find yourself rebalancing every other month or 
so. It all depends on the markets.
 
Volatile markets create more opportunities for productive rebalancing. You’ll 
want to rebalance more often in those markets and less often in docile markets.
 
Monitor your portfolio frequently (at least monthly), and rebalance when — 
and only when — your portfolio drifts outside its intended asset allocation.

▶ Determining the constraints on your portfolio
▶ Taking taxes into account
▶ Dealing with a few special portfolio considerations
I
n this chapter, we help you nail down your investing plan. Here you can 
find guidelines that serve as an important step toward establishing your 
investment strategy and then setting up your asset allocation. You don’t want 
to skip this step!
We start with your time horizon. Many investors don’t realize how long their 
horizon truly is. Your time horizon directly influences your choice of invest-
ment strategy: The more time you have to invest, the more short-term risk 
you may be able to take.
We also help you to consider the returns you’ll require from the assets in 
your portfolio. And we show you how to gauge your risk tolerance, because 
the risk you’re willing, and able, to take along the way is a particularly impor-
tant consideration.
You’ll need to think about a few pragmatic constraints that you’ll have to 
impose on your portfolio, and we show you how to deal with those in this 
chapter. For example, you may have holdings you won’t relinquish, or 
investments — even whole asset classes — you won’t even consider.

100
Part II: Getting Started 
And don’t forget taxes. They’re one of the last things any of us wants to think 
about, but they’re a priority in planning a portfolio. You want to be aware of 
your income-tax situation and its impact on your portfolio choices. For exam-
ple, which is the better choice for you: a municipal bond or a Treasury bond 
of equivalent maturity? The answer depends on your tax bracket.
Finally, we explain how you can avoid overlooking any special consider-
ations, such as protecting your assets from unnecessary estate taxes or from 
unexpected litigation.
Seeing Your Investment Horizon Clearly
Before deciding on your asset allocation, you’ll need to determine your 
investment horizon — the length of time your assets will, on average, be 
invested. In general, the shorter your investment horizon, the more conser-
vative your investment strategy should be, and the more weighted toward 
fixed-income investments your asset allocation should be. Conversely, the 
longer your investment horizon, the more aggressive your strategy should 
be, and the more weighted toward equities your allocation should be.
To help explain, we offer the following two extreme cases.
 
✓ Case 1: This case involves a college student, Dakota, whose invested 
assets are in a college fund. There’s just enough left in the fund to cover 
the remaining two years of Dakota’s tuition. The time horizon in this 
case is a very clearly defined two years. Dakota is in the homestretch — 
it’s time to play it safe and cruise to victory! It would be foolish to risk 
the fund’s principal on a highly aggressive investment strategy. The 
appropriate asset allocation should be one that emphasizes capital 
preservation, which means it should be quite conservative (more bonds 
than stocks, for example). The always-present risk that a conservative 
portfolio may fall behind inflation and see its purchasing power eroded 
is a very small risk here, because there are only two years left in the life 
of the fund. And bonds (of suitable maturity, of course) are much less 
likely than stocks to lose their value over that period of time.
 
✓ Case 2: This case features Ann, a widowed grandmother with consider-
able invested assets to her name. She has more than enough income 
from other sources (pensions, Social Security, a structured settlement 
on an old personal liability claim) to cover her modest living expenses, 
and enough insurance to cover any foreseeable catastrophic event. Ann’s 
grown children are self-sufficient — they have good jobs and don’t rely 
on her financially. She really sees her assets as ultimately being for the 
benefit of her grandchildren, ages 2 through 8, whose education costs 
through college have already been fully funded by their parents. Because 
Ann’s investment horizon corresponds to her grandchildren’s life expec-
tancy, it’s on the order of 70 years. This case argues for a fairly aggressive 

101
 Chapter 6: Laying the Foundation for Your Plan
investment strategy and asset allocation. The grandchildren won’t be 
accessing the assets for several decades, so short-term portfolio volatility 
is of very minor concern. The main concern is staying ahead of inflation. 
As you can see in Figure 6-1, over long enough holding periods the volatil-
ity of “riskier” assets, such as stocks, isn’t much greater than that of “safer” 
investments, such as bonds. And stocks, with their higher expected long-
term returns, are much better at beating inflation than bonds.
The length of your investment horizon should have a definite impact on the 
mix of assets in your portfolio. For example, the longer your horizon, the more 
comfortable you can be considering equities. Look at the impact of invest-
ment horizon (or holding period) on the three broad asset classes of Treasury 
bills, intermediate government bonds, and large-company stocks in Figure 6-1. 
We show the historical range of compound average annual returns (flip back to 
Chapter 2 if you need to read up on returns) for each of these assets.
The worst one-year return for T-bills was 1 percent, and the best was 15 
percent, for a range of 14 percentage points; the worst one-year return for 
large-company stocks was –26 percent, and the best was 53 percent, for a 
range of 79 percentage points. Over longer holding periods, these ranges 
narrow considerably: Over a ten-year holding period, the worst compound 
average annual return for T-bills was 0 percent, and the best was 9 percent, 
for a range of 9 percentage points. For stocks, the range narrowed all the way 
down to 18 percentage points (worst was 1 percent; best was 19 percent).

Part II: Getting Started 
So as the investment horizon lengthens, the risk associated with stocks 
declines. (Note: There hasn’t been a single ten-year period since 1950 during 
which the worst returns for stocks wasn’t above zero. That’s not true for 
T-bills or bonds.) At the same time, the average return for stocks was always 
much better than that for T-bills and bonds. What happens is an investing 
phenomenon called risk-spreading over time — the good years and the bad 
years tend to offset each other.
 
The length of your investment horizon should have an impact on the mix of 
assets in your portfolio. The longer your horizon, the more comfortable you 
can be considering equities.
So, what’s your investment horizon? It’s probably longer than you think.
If, for example, you’re 65 years old and planning to retire at 67, at which time 
your compensation, which is your only source of income (you have no pen-
sion), stops, it’s natural to consider your horizon to be two years. After all, 
that’s when you’ll start to depend entirely on your accumulated savings to 
cover all your living expenses for the rest of your life. But that’s far too short 
a period. According to current actuarial tables, if you’re a reasonably healthy 
male, you could live another 25 years. And if you have a younger and simi-
larly healthy wife, your joint life expectancy can be longer still. Your com-
bined assets will need to support you both for that extra quarter-century! An 
investment strategy, and resulting asset allocation, that assumes a two-year 
investment horizon (a conservative, bond-heavy allocation, for example) may 
leave you seriously behind inflation in your later years, when it’ll be too late 
to make an adjustment. This is an example of a strategy that appears quite 
conservative but is actually risky as can be.
Whatever your current age, over your remaining life expectancy, you’ll 
probably have big-ticket expenses to cover (children’s and grandchildren’s 
educations, weddings, relocations, and so on) in the near term that’ll have 
an impact on your overall investment horizon. You don’t want to run dry in 
later years because you didn’t take such expenses into consideration in your 
calculations. (We cover those details in Chapter 7, when you develop your 
investment strategy, and test several “What if?” scenarios.)
As you continue to age and your life expectancy naturally shortens, it’s wise 
to consider dialing your asset allocation down to something more conserva-
tive, by shifting from equities to fixed-income investments. But this should be 
a slow, gradual process, and you shouldn’t begin at too conservative a start-
ing point.
 
This bears repeating: The first step in deciding on an asset allocation is to 
clearly determine the length of time your assets will need to be working for 
you. And remember, you have your whole lifetime to cover. Here’s hoping that 
you have many, many years to plan for.

103
 Chapter 6: Laying the Foundation for Your Plan
Setting Your Return Objectives
How hard do you need your assets to work for you? In other words, what 
kind of return do you need from your portfolio? These are important ques-
tions and, by forcing yourself to answer them, you can nail down how conser-
vative or aggressive your investment strategy needs to be.
 
When we talk about return objectives, we’re talking about what you need, 
not what you want. Clearly, all investors want their returns to be as high as 
possible. But as we discuss in Chapter 2, there’s usually no free lunch; higher 
returns typically come only with higher risk. So when it comes to setting 
guidelines for your investment strategy, you want to make sure that you don’t 
take on unnecessarily high risk by shooting for a higher return than you actu-
ally need.
The answer to the question, “What kind of return do you need from your 
portfolio?” may not be obvious or straightforward. It depends on your life-
style, your other sources of income, your insurance and benefit plans, your 
age, your health, your dependents, and more.
When it comes time for you to figure out your return objectives, turn to 
Chapter 7. We devote much of that chapter to going through an exercise that 
helps you understand the nuts and bolts of setting a return objective, and we 
show you how you can do it yourself. This chapter doesn’t deal with as much 
of the nitty-gritty detail, but it’s critical that you grasp the importance of your 
return objective when you’re making decisions about your asset allocation.
 
The connection to asset allocation is clear and direct. The higher your return 
objectives, the more aggressive your investment strategy needs to be and, 
hence, the more you should allocate to equities.
Making Decisions about 
Your Risk Tolerance
Your risk tolerance is one of the most important things (if not the most 
important thing) you’ll need to determine to develop your specific asset allo-
cation. To see why, take a look at the risk/return map in Figure 6-2.
As we explain in Chapter 2, all investment choices can be mapped on a risk/
return map. On a risk/return map, an efficient frontier of choices emerges. 
The efficient frontier identifies those investments that you can’t improve 
upon — for a given level of risk, there’s no investment that gives you a higher 
return; for a given level of return, there’s no investment that gives you a 

104
Part II: Getting Started 
lower risk. Because all the investments along the frontier are equivalently 
efficient, the only way to increase your return is by increasing the degree of 
risk you take (by moving northeast along the frontier).
You want to maximize your return — assuming the associated level of risk 
was tolerable — so the only thing you need to do is determine how much risk 
is too much for you. That tells you how far east you dare go, and because 
you want to stay on the frontier, it also tells you how far north you can go. 
The efficient frontier uniquely determines the investment choice you should 
make, and you should tap into its usefulness when you’re working on your 
asset allocation plan.
 
There are two aspects to risk tolerance. One is your financial ability to tolerate 
risk; the other is your willingness. Your ability to tolerate risk can be deter-
mined objectively, through the exercise we outline in the next chapter. Your 
willingness is subjective — it’s your call. No one can stand in your shoes and 
determine for you what’s going to keep you awake at night with worry about 
your portfolio. It is, though, very useful to know your ability to withstand risk 
before you decide your willingness. As subjective as the “risk willingness” 
decision is, it doesn’t hurt to arm yourself with as much relevant objective 
information as you can before you make the call.

 Chapter 6: Laying the Foundation for Your Plan
Flip ahead to Chapter 7 for a detailed explanation of how you can determine 
your risk-tolerance ability. To help you come to grips with your risk-tolerance 
willingness, read on!
 
Should you try to figure out on your own just how much risk you can tolerate, 
or should you seek help? Many investors consider risk tolerance an area that 
is a little too daunting to tackle alone, and they choose to consult with a pro-
fessional. Good financial planners and investment advisors are well versed on 
and experienced in this topic and can be of great assistance to you. If you read 
through this section and still don’t feel comfortable answering the question of 
your risk tolerance on your own, then by all means seek out a professional to 
guide you through the exercise. (See Chapter 16 for a discussion of the kind of 
help you can get and where you can get it.)
Evaluating your experience
Most everyone has an investing horror story to tell. Maybe Aunt Mabel put 
her life savings in a hedge fund that took a nose dive, or Uncle Fred made a 
killing in tech stocks in the 1990s until the tech bubble burst and he lost it all. 
Your feelings about investment risk are formed by the stories you’ve heard, 
and from your own personal experience. There are valuable lessons to be 
learned from virtually all these stories. But let the stories inform your judg-
ment, not cloud it.
 
Learn the lessons from investment failures — both yours and those you hear 
and read about — but don’t shy away from the level of risk that’s appropri-
ate for you. If you dwell on past failures, you won’t make intelligent decisions 
about your risk tolerance and, therefore, about your investment strategy and 
asset allocation. Make sure that your primary goal isn’t to avoid bad outcomes 
at all costs.
Think about your experiences, and those of others you’ve heard about, and 
then set your emotions aside as you ponder what you’d consider an intoler-
able outcome. Is it losing 15 percent of your portfolio’s value in a given year? 
Is it not staying ahead of inflation over an extended period? Is it having your 
portfolio’s value bounce around more than ±10 percent in a given quarter? 
(Flip back to Chapter 2 if you want to revisit the different ways to measure 
risk.) Pick the risk measure that best suits you, and then determine the criti-
cal number of that measure that you don’t want to exceed. And be sure to 
remember that number when you get to Chapter 8, where you use it to help 
nail down your asset allocation percentages.

106
Part II: Getting Started 
Considering risk questionnaires 
and other tools
Determining your risk tolerance can be a tricky undertaking. To help make the 
process a bit more straightforward, you can consider using a risk-tolerance 
questionnaire or a similar tool.
Most of these questionnaires are driven by psychology and are quite general — 
and the link to investment risk tolerance isn’t direct. They don’t offer a clear 
road map to translate the results into an investment choice, so you may not 
want to spend too much time with them for investment purposes.
Some of the other available questionnaires are investment specific, and ask 
you about some combination of your investment time horizon, past invest-
ing experience, and emotional reaction to volatility. These questionnaires 
are usually found on brokerage and mutual-fund company Web sites, but the 
goal of the questionnaires is narrow: to direct you to which of the company’s 
products and services it believes would be most suitable for you. The ques-
tionnaires are basically sales tools; keep that in mind if you choose to fill 
them out.
We can’t recommend either type of risk-tolerance questionnaire.
 
The advisors at Brinton Eaton Wealth Advisors try to fill this void by provid-
ing a simple worksheet that boils down the determination of a client’s risk tol-
erance to five choices. (Other advisory firms may have similar tools.) You can 
see Brinton Eaton’s worksheet in Figure 6-3. The features of each of the five 
risk-tolerance choices are expressed in various ways:
 
✓ The relative emphasis on income and growth
 
✓ The rough asset allocation (in particular, the percentage allocated to 
equities)
 
✓ Representative historical returns
 
✓ The range around those historical returns
Clients have found this a simple exercise to bring all the relevant consider-
ations together in a very practical and understandable way. They’ve been 
able to have a focused and meaningful conversation with their spouses about 
risk, and make their choice with confidence. You may find it useful yourself.

Setting Your Portfolio Constraints
In addition to your investment horizon, your return requirements, and your 
risk tolerance, there may be certain overriding considerations that will con-
strain the way you build your portfolio. You need to deal with these, and in 
this section we let you know how to do just that.

108
Part II: Getting Started 
Recognizing positions you won’t get out of
You may have certain holdings in your portfolio that you just won’t part with, 
because of emotional reasons. For example, you may have inherited some 
stock from a beloved departed family member and you never want to sell it, 
for sentimental reasons. You may have bought shares in a startup company 
founded by your college roommate and want to hold them as a gesture of 
your support for his dream. Or you may still own a modest position in the 
company where you worked for 30 years, and you can’t bear losing that 
reminder of what got you where you are today. Coldly rational investors may 
quibble with these emotional choices, but you just can’t relinquish those 
positions.
There are also a variety of unemotional, policy-related reasons for holding 
onto a position. For example, you may be prohibited from selling your com-
pany stock for a period of time.
How do you deal with the holdings in your portfolio that you just can’t live 
without? Simply recognize those investments when you design your portfolio, 
and when you rebalance. Select the rest of your securities around your “sacred 
cows,” and take them into consideration when it comes time to rebalance. If 
you care enough to hold onto them, you can find a way to work around them.
Identifying investments you won’t consider
Another set of portfolio constraints can involve specific investments that you 
won’t consider under any circumstances. These can often be ethical or moral 
decisions. For example, you may be firmly committed to never investing in 
the tobacco company that you believe played a role in the premature death 
of a loved one.
Some investments may also be off limits to you because of more formal 
restrictions. For example, you could be prohibited from investing in compa-
nies that the company you work for consults with or audits. Or, because of 
your position with your employer, you may be privy to certain inside infor-
mation and have blackout periods imposed by regulatory authorities, during 
which you can’t buy (or, for that matter, sell) your company’s stock.
The simple strategy for working with off-limits assets is very similar to the 
one we explain in the preceding section. All you really need to do is keep 
the restricted investments in mind as you build your portfolio and when 
you rebalance it. Working around these types of constraints is generally 
quite easy, given the vast number of available asset opportunities. (Turn to 
Chapter 3 for our extensive discussion of asset classes.)

109
 Chapter 6: Laying the Foundation for Your Plan
Limiting your exposure to 
certain asset classes
In the previous section, we describe a few situations in which you may com-
pletely refuse to invest in specific companies for one reason or another. 
There’s another, somewhat similar set of portfolio constraints that can pre-
vent you from being willing to consider entire asset classes, not just specific 
investments. For example, religious considerations may cause you to avoid 
healthcare stocks or shares in companies that promote gambling. Social 
concerns may prevent you from pursuing industrial companies that pollute 
the environment, or energy companies that burn fossil fuels without funding 
research for alternative energy solutions.
These types of constraints are harder to cope with than the ones we cover 
in the previous sections, because they can blackball entire asset classes. 
If you just have to dodge certain companies, then you really don’t have to 
tinker with your overall asset allocation — just with your security selection 
and rebalancing. But if you’re looking to avoid one or several asset classes, 
then you have to reevaluate the way you determine your asset allocation, 
which could compromise the performance of your portfolio. You may have to 
accept a portfolio that is not strictly on the efficient frontier (see Chapter 2). 
Have a look at Figure 6-4 to see what we mean.

Part II: Getting Started 
In Figure 6-4, we plot some available investment choices on the risk/reward 
map (see Chapter 2). As you can see, the introduction of asset-class con-
straints eliminates some of these investment choices from consideration. 
Typically, those eliminated choices include some that lie on the efficient fron-
tier. When all the eliminated choices are removed from the map, the efficient 
frontier formed by the remaining investment choices will almost always be 
inferior to (southeast of) the original frontier. (At best, it could overlap the 
original frontier at some points.) The more stringent your constraints, the far-
ther the efficient frontier will move to the southeast on the risk/reward map.
Reviewing Your Tax Situation
Investing isn’t an isolated activity in your financial life. It’s intimately con-
nected with your long-term financial plan (see Chapter 7), as well as with 
your income-tax and estate-tax situation. You have to take into account taxes 
and their effects when coming up with your investment plan. In this section, 
we help you figure out how you can factor in your income-tax considerations. 
(Note: We touch on estate taxes later, in the “Taking Account of Special 
Circumstances” section.)
Being mindful of your current 
and future tax brackets
The tax bracket you’re in — whether high or low — should influence your 
investment decisions in a number of ways. It’s important that you keep in 
mind your tax bracket — and how it may change in the future — as you plan 
your investment strategy.
For example, buying municipal bonds (which are exempt from federal income 
tax — see Chapter 3) in your taxable accounts is generally more tax efficient. 
But if your tax bracket is low, you may get a better after-tax result by choos-
ing Treasury bonds instead.
A quick calculation will point you in the right direction: Assume that the yield 
on the municipal bond you’re interested in is 3 percent. If you’re in the 15 per-
cent tax bracket, and the Treasury bond of equivalent maturity is yielding 3.7 
percent, you’re better off after taxes buying the Treasury bond. Why? Because, 
0.037 – (0.15 × 0.037) = 0.03145, which is greater than 0.03. In other words, the 
3.7 percent you get from the Treasury bond, minus the tax you have to pay on 
it, is still greater than the 3 percent you get from the municipal bond.

111
 Chapter 6: Laying the Foundation for Your Plan
As another example, suppose you’re in a high tax bracket and your rebalancing 
trigger causes you to consider selling a stock that you’ve held for 111/2 months 
in a taxable account. If you sell the stock, the gain will be taxed at your high-
bracket ordinary income-tax rate; if you wait until after the 12-month anniver-
sary, the gain will be taxed at the lower long-term capital-gains tax rate. In this 
case, it may pay to wait a couple weeks (as long as you’re willing to accept the 
risk that the stock price doesn’t drop in the meantime!).
You also need to consider whether you expect a material change in your tax 
bracket in the future. For example, if you retired this year and also exercised 
a large lot of employer stock options immediately after calling it quits, your 
bracket is high this year, but it will be considerably lower next year. In that 
case, you may want to delay short-term capital gains that you may otherwise 
take in December of this year, and take them in January of next year instead, 
when the tax bite will be lower.
Looking for opportunities 
in prior tax returns
You may be able to inform your investment plan by taking a look at past tax 
returns. The primary reason is that you may have what’s called a tax loss 
carryforward (an IRS term that designates tax losses that accrued in earlier 
years and that, because of IRS limitations, couldn’t be used at the time but 
can be used against gains in subsequent years). If, in prior years, you realized 
considerable tax losses on your security sales, you may still have a tax loss 
carryforward. You can use the tax loss carryforward to offset gains in the cur-
rent and future years.
 
How can you tell if you have a tax loss carryforward? Simply have a look at 
your last tax return. If a tax loss carryforward is available to you, it’ll be listed 
in Schedule D of your return.
If you enter a tax year with a tax loss carryforward, you have greater flexibil-
ity than you would otherwise in taking gains in that tax year. Your gains will 
be offset dollar for dollar by the amount of the carryforward. You’ll owe no 
capital-gains tax until your gains exceed the carryforward. As a result, you 
may be more inclined to take gains in the current year — when, for example, 
your rebalancing trigger tells you to do so — instead of delaying them and 
running the risk that the rebalancing opportunity may pass you by.

112
Part II: Getting Started 
Considering which of your assets 
are in tax-deferred accounts
If you’re like most investors, you probably have your family’s invested assets 
housed in a number of different accounts. If you’re striving to be as savvy as 
possible when you’re formulating your investment plan, you’ll take the tax 
characteristics of each of those accounts into consideration.
 
First off, keep in mind that the most efficient route is to treat all your house-
hold accounts as one big pie to be allocated and rebalanced in the aggregate. 
We cover this in more detail in Chapter 10, but it’s an important concept to 
remember when thinking about the ways that taxes can affect your various 
accounts.
By viewing your assets holistically across all your accounts, you can exploit 
the fact that the accounts receive very different tax treatment. Here’s the gist 
of the tactic: Some assets are more tax efficient than others — meaning, they 
generate relatively less ordinary income and more long-term capital gains. 
(Remember: Ordinary income is taxed at higher rates than long-term capital 
gains for most taxpayers.)
For example, the income from real estate investment trusts (REITs — see 
Chapter 3) is taxed as ordinary income, while growth stocks generate very 
little income and their dividends typically qualify for tax rates equivalent to 
long-term capital-gains tax rates. So, in achieving your overall asset alloca-
tion, take advantage of the fact that your IRA and 401(k) are tax-deferred 
accounts, and put all the REIT allocation that you can in those accounts. Save 
the growth stocks for your taxable accounts.
Taking Account of Special Circumstances
When you’re working out your asset allocation, you need to take into con-
sideration a few other factors beyond those listed in the first sections of this 
chapter. These special circumstances may not apply to every investor in 
every situation, but you definitely need to be aware of them (some more than 
others) and be prepared to incorporate them into your plan.
Protecting your assets from lawsuits
Some investors are particularly subject to litigation. Doctors, accountants, 
architects, and engineers, notably, are more often targets of plaintiffs and 
their attorneys than are people in other professions. Whether or not you feel 

113
 Chapter 6: Laying the Foundation for Your Plan
you’re especially vulnerable to people trying to lay claim to your assets, you 
may be interested in taking steps to protect your assets from that potential 
threat.
If you feel your risk of litigation is high, you’d do well to speak with an asset 
protection professional (often an attorney) about how you can shield your 
portfolio from litigants and potential creditors. You need an expert qualified 
in this area who can advise you on the dangers and pitfalls of the various 
tactics; ask around (canvass your professional colleagues) to find and qualify 
these experts. Tactics include moving possession of the assets to another 
family member and/or setting up trusts, including offshore trusts.
 
Be careful when considering ways to protect your assets from the threat of liti-
gation. There are legal and acceptable ways to accomplish that goal, but the 
courts are very unsympathetic to people whom they feel have structured such 
arrangements purely for the purpose of protection from creditors instead of 
for legitimate business/financial purposes.
 
If you want to protect some of your assets but don’t feel the need to consult a 
professional, there are some perfectly acceptable and easy things you can do:
 
✓ An employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, or a rollover IRA — specifically 
designed to accept funds from your 401(k) — can offer better protection 
than your traditional IRA. (But see “Simplifying your holdings,” later in 
this chapter, which describes the tradeoffs of keeping your money in a 
401[k] or spread among too many IRAs.)
 
✓ Your primary residence has a higher degree of protection than your 
invested assets, generally speaking.
 
✓ If you’ve set up 529 plans for your child’s education, these funds are pro-
tected from bankruptcy proceedings to the extent they were held in the 
plan for a sufficient number of years.
The degree to which you exploit any of these opportunities should depend 
on how likely you believe you are to be sued.
Protecting your estate from taxes
Estate taxes — unlike income, property, and sales taxes — have been 
referred to as “voluntary taxes,” because there are many legitimate means to 
reduce or even eliminate the bite from federal and state estate taxes when 
you pass along your assets to your heirs. We don’t go into much detail on 
estate-tax strategies in this book (see Estate Planning For Dummies, by N. 
Brian Caverly, Esq., and Jordan S. Simon [Wiley], if you want more informa-
tion on the subject), but there are a few tactics you can easily incorporate 
into your portfolio construction plan.

114
Part II: Getting Started 
One theme that should run through your planning is the equalization of 
assets as much as possible between you and your spouse. For example, if 
your IRA and 401(k) are much larger than your spouse’s, you should con-
sider putting more of your combined taxable assets in your spouse’s name. 
(Although this is an easily foiled tactic when it comes to creditor protec-
tion, it’s a perfectly valid and very common practice when it comes to estate 
planning.) This strategy allows both you and your spouse more flexibility, 
after the death of the first of you, to shelter assets from estate taxes through 
so-called disclaimer provisions. (The details of disclaimers are beyond the 
scope of this book — the point here is to allow yourself the flexibility to 
exploit them by spreading out the ownership of your assets.)
For similar reasons, you should review the assets you own jointly with your 
spouse — both invested assets and use assets (such as your house) — and 
determine if they are titled as Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship 
(JTWROS) or Tenants in Common (TIC). TIC titling gives the surviving spouse 
more flexibility at the death of the other spouse to shelter the deceased 
spouse’s share of the joint asset from estate tax.
 
Some states, such as California, deem all marital assets to be neither TIC nor 
JTWROS, but instead consider them to be Community Property (CP) assets. 
CP titling doesn’t provide the flexibility you’d like, so if you live in a CP state 
you should consider establishing lifetime trusts, individually for you and your 
spouse, to effectively achieve the same result as if the titling were TIC.
Some investors have spouses who aren’t U.S. citizens and aren’t subject to 
U.S. taxation. The U.S. estate-tax laws, when it comes to the estate of the U.S.-
citizen spouse, are particularly unmerciful in these situations. Here again, the 
use of trusts can allow you the flexibility to avoid estate taxes.
 
Each of the tactics mentioned in this section should be undertaken only with 
the assistance of a qualified financial planning and/or estate planning expert. 
(See Chapter 16 for a discussion of the relevant professionals you can turn to 
for help.)
Simplifying your holdings
It’s common for investors to have too many investment accounts. When 
you’re hammering out your asset allocation plan, remember that consolidat-
ing some of those accounts can be an excellent move. Aside from simplify-
ing your paperwork, consolidating your assets makes it much easier for you 
to allocate your assets and periodically rebalance them. The fewer your 
accounts, the easier your job!

115
 Chapter 6: Laying the Foundation for Your Plan
For example, you and your spouse may have several joint and individual 
accounts, perhaps one for each broker or custodian through which you 
originally set up the account. You may have a number of IRAs, some of which 
may have resulted from rolling over your 401(k)s from prior employers. You 
may even have left some of your old 401(k)s sitting in the prior employers’ 
accounts. We’ve seen some investors of fairly modest means with as many as 
a dozen different accounts. That’s too many.
First of all, there’s usually no good reason for each taxpayer to have more 
than one IRA. Your IRAs, including those that are rollover IRAs, can be con-
solidated into one IRA with no tax impact — and they should be. There’s 
even less reason (unless you’re especially concerned about creditors, as 
we discuss a little earlier in this section) to leave an old 401(k) sitting in the 
account of a prior employer. Roll it into your existing IRA; you’ll save on 
expenses (401[k] expenses are typically large and hidden) and you’ll have 
a broader array of investments to choose from. (Most 401[k]s have limited 
investment menus.)
 
Beyond your tax-deferred accounts, there’s little reason to have your taxable 
assets scattered across multiple broker accounts, if you’re going to manage 
your portfolio yourself. Consolidate them into one account (or as few as pos-
sible, given the ownership issues discussed in the preceding section). Life is 
complicated enough — keep it simple where you can.

ere’s a big-time question for you: Do you know if you can afford your 
own retirement? If you’re going to need $50,000 a year to maintain your 
lifestyle, but you have only $350,000 in assets at the moment, do you have 
any idea how you’re going to get from where you are financially to where you 
need to be?
Maybe you’re not even close to retirement. Maybe you’re still changing dia-
pers or trying to keep an eye on teenagers. But there are still big-time ques-
tions to be considered. Have you sat down and figured out if you can pay for 
their expected education expenses in five or ten years, or will you need to 
take out a loan (or several)?
Your investment strategy must match your life goals and circumstances — 
not the other way around. In thinking about future needs and wants, it’s help-
ful to start by looking at your current lifestyle, but your investment plan must 
be broad enough to cover your future lifestyle, too.
In this chapter, we take you through a systematic, step-by-step process that 
will help you to build the investment portfolio that best suits your needs. We 
guarantee that you’ll be glad you put in the work, because, in the end, you’ll 
see the clear link between your ideal investment strategy and your long-term 
financial plan.

118
Part II: Getting Started 
This chapter centers on a tool that can crystallize the future financial effects 
of your life choices. We call this tool the Lifetime Cash-flow Projection (LCP). 
We go through a careful, comprehensive exercise to nail down all the nuts 
and bolts of your LCP. Then, we show you how to use this projection to 
answer numerous questions — in particular, how to determine the asset allo-
cation strategy that best helps you meet your lifetime financial needs.
Understanding the Lifetime 
Cash-Flow Projection
So what is a Lifetime Cash-flow Projection? An LCP is a very powerful tool 
that captures all the important information about your assets, liabilities, 
income, and expenses, and projects them into the future, so that you can 
make informed decisions today about things that will have an impact on you 
many years down the road. This section is designed to fill you in on a few 
LCP basics.
 
As you’ll soon see, your LCP is really a living document that you can change as 
your life changes — it’s not a one-time exercise.
Getting a feel for the basics
A well-crafted LCP allows you to see your present financial situation in a 
snapshot, which can be a real eye-opener. The LCP starts out looking a lot 
like a personal balance sheet (a list of your current assets and liabilities) and 
income statement (a list of your current income and expenses), and those two 
features combined can tell you quite a bit about where you stand financially. 
But the LCP doesn’t stop there: It also helps you project what your situa-
tion might look like in the future. No LCP can perfectly predict what’s going 
to happen in the future, but it can alert you to potential problems and areas 
of financial vulnerability. The LCP ties together all aspects of your financial 
plan. And, as you’ll see, your asset allocation is a big part of that.
 
For an even fuller discussion on putting together your financial plan, we 
recommend Personal Finance For Dummies, 5th Edition, by Eric Tyson, MBA 
(Wiley).
You’ll need to work to produce a good LCP. You’ll have to gather a lot of 
information, some of which you probably haven’t thought about in years. You 
may feel a little tempted to skip some of the work and take a few shortcuts. 
Our advice: Don’t! The work will be worth it because detailed information will 

119
 Chapter 7: Developing Your Investment Strategy
allow you to conduct a more accurate analysis, which will make pinpointing 
your optimal asset allocation strategy much, much easier. Your results just 
won’t be as good if you’re using incomplete or inaccurate info.
You can prepare an LCP in several ways:
 
✓ By simply putting pencil to paper: But don’t reach for the old no. 2 
pencil just yet. You may want to work out your LCP electronically — the 
arithmetic quickly becomes tedious if you take the manual route.
 
✓ By using an off-the-shelf computer program, such as Quicken: These 
programs help you keep track of a lot of the information we discuss in 
this chapter, and they even prepare a projection for you.
 
✓ By doing it yourself using a spreadsheet program such as Excel: 
Spreadsheets are quite easy to use, and you can customize them to fit 
your own unique situation.
 
✓ By hiring a qualified expert to do it for you: A professional will know 
what to do with all the information, but you’re still going to need to 
provide her with the raw data — your assets, liabilities, income, and 
expenses. (See Chapter 16 for a discussion on hiring experts to help you.)
Recognizing the link between your 
asset allocation and your Lifetime 
Cash-flow Projection
As we explain in Chapter 6, your time horizon, return objectives, and risk 
tolerance are three of the most important factors that determine your asset 
allocation. You’ll be able to better gauge all three as you develop your LCP. 
Why? There are three main reasons:
 
✓ Your LCP will help you pinpoint your true time horizon. If you haven’t 
read Chapter 6, you may still think of your investment time horizon as 
lasting only until the beginning of your retirement, which may lead you 
to invest more conservatively than you should. The LCP will broaden 
your perspective to see just how long your investments need to last and 
how important investment growth is over the long term.
 
 You may also realize that an event that seems very far away is coming 
up relatively soon. For example, if you have a child in middle school, 
envisioning her old enough to attend college may be very difficult. 
Paying for her college expenses may not seem like a pressing need. But 
when your LCP tells you that you only have five years until you need to 
start paying for your princess’s college expenses, that need will feel a lot 
more pressing. This may lead you to start investing part of your funds 
differently with this shorter time horizon in mind.

120
Part II: Getting Started 
 
✓ The LCP will help you more accurately figure out your required rate 
of return. Just how much do you need to earn to support your lifestyle 
and reach your goals? Although you may not like the volatility inher-
ent in more aggressive investments, the LCP may convince you that, if 
you don’t want to scale back your lifestyle, you need to reach for higher 
returns. On the other hand, your LCP may indicate that you can afford to 
invest much more conservatively than you are, and there’s no cause to 
take on risk you don’t need to.
 
✓ The LCP will help you define your risk tolerance. The LCP makes it 
clear that risk isn’t always the same thing as volatility (as we discuss in 
Chapter 2) and that risk doesn’t exist in a vacuum. For example, many 
investors define risk as the chance that they might lose money. However, 
when you create your LCP and see your expenses increasing with infla-
tion every year, it becomes apparent that “not losing money” isn’t the 
same thing as “not losing purchasing power.” To maintain your lifestyle, 
you may have to reach for higher returns and accept the higher volatility 
that comes with them. Paradoxically, this may be the only way you can 
reduce your risk of failure (your failure to maintain your style of living).
When you complete the exercise we describe in this chapter, you see the 
impact of different asset allocations on your lifetime cash flow directly, using 
your LCP. This is how your LCP helps you derive your optimal asset alloca-
tion strategy.
Coming Up with an Outline for Your 
Long-Term Financial Plan
The LCP has four main parts: assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Table 
7-1 shows the framework of an LCP. Keep this framework in mind and refer 
back to it as we explain each of the parts of the LCP in the next few sections.

Try to keep in mind that, if you’re still employed, your net cash flow (income 
minus your expenses) will generally be positive, but it will probably turn 
negative when you retire and start to draw down from your assets to cover 
expenses. Make sure that you have enough to meet your lifestyle needs when 
you start to make withdrawals by keeping track of your projected assets now. 
For most people, loan payments (such as mortgages and home equity lines of 
credit) are a large part of expenses in retirement, which is why keeping track 
of liabilities is another key part of the LCP.
 
You’ll want to avoid a couple of common LCP mistakes:
 
✓ Make sure that all income and expense amounts reflect the same 
period, such as a month or a year. Be careful not to enter a monthly 
salary and quarterly insurance payments.
 
✓ Don’t skip any of the categories we list in this section just because 
they don’t currently apply to you. They may apply in the future.
Assets
For the purposes of creating an LCP, the term asset can mean money — bank 
accounts, brokerage accounts, IRAs and 401(k)s — as well as investment 
property (such as an apartment building on which you collect rent, or your 
business).

122
Part II: Getting Started 
If you’re like most people, you consider your house to be a significant asset, 
but it isn’t included here because it’s actually not a source of income. It’s a 
source of expenses (property taxes, repairs, upkeep, and remodeling), which 
we get to in the next section.
 
Keep track separately of the equity you have in your home because you can 
use it to secure a home equity loan or line of credit if you need it, and it can be 
a source of funds if you downsize later.
When you list your assets, distinguish between three types of assets:
 
✓ Taxable assets: Your taxable assets are generally funds in non-retirement 
accounts. These are accounts for which there are no tax deductions when 
you make contributions and no taxation when you make withdrawals, but 
income and realized capital gains on these accounts are taxed in the years 
in which they’re earned.
 
✓ Tax-advantaged assets: Your tax-advantaged assets are generally 
assets held in 401(k) plans, IRA accounts, 529 plans, education sav-
ings accounts (ESAs), and health savings accounts (HSAs). Income and 
capital gains in these accounts aren’t taxed. Contributions to these 
accounts (other than Roth IRAs) are tax-deductible. Withdrawals from 
traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed at your ordinary income-tax rates. 
Withdrawals from Roth IRAs, 529 plans, ESAs, and HSAs are not taxed, 
provided that the withdrawals are done in accordance with the rules 
applicable to each of those plans.
 
 Ask your financial or tax advisor for help with these rules if you’re unfa-
miliar with them. (See Chapter 16 if you need to find an advisor.)
 
✓ Non-invested assets: These funds are your “rainy-day money,” or money 
that you expect to use in the near future. Typically, you stick these 
assets in your savings or checking accounts.
For each of these, you need an assumed earnings rate, which is the rate (a 
percentage) at which each asset will generate income. We discuss how to esti-
mate these assumed earnings rates in “Investment returns” and “Estimating 
returns,” later in this chapter. Because your asset allocation should comprise 
both your taxable and tax-advantaged accounts in the aggregate, these should 
have the same assumed earnings rate. Because the non-invested funds (sav-
ings account, checking account) will be in very conservative instruments, they 
should have a different assumed earnings rate that is relatively low but fairly 
stable.

123
 Chapter 7: Developing Your Investment Strategy
 
Experimenting with the assumed earnings rate (trying different rates and 
noting how they change your LCP) on your taxable and tax-advantaged 
accounts will allow you to see how asset allocation affects your cash-flow pro-
jections. That’s one of the key links we develop in the “Determining How Your 
Asset Allocation May Affect Your Lifetime Cash-Flow Projection” section, later 
in this chapter.
In Table 7-2, we show you an example of what the asset portion of your LCP 
may look like. In this example, assets include taxable money held in a sav-
ings account, a certificate of deposit, and a brokerage account. Assets also 
include tax-advantaged accounts held in an IRA and a 401(k) plan.

Liabilities
To develop the second part of your LCP, you need to keep track of liabilities 
(your outstanding financial obligations), which can include your mortgage, 
school loans, car loans, and unpaid credit card balances. Make sure you 
include all the necessary details. In Table 7-3, for example, details on your 
mortgage include balance, interest (fixed or variable), annual payment, and 
number of years left. You’ll need this information on every loan you hold.
The annual payment, and how long you have to pay it, will be expense items 
that you’ll enter on the expense portion of the LCP, which we cover in the 
“Expenses” section, later in this chapter, but it’s good to simply note those 
items here as well, so that all your loan information is summarized in one 
place.

124
Part II: Getting Started 
 
Your mortgage payment is probably one of your biggest expense items. Is the 
interest rate fixed or variable? If it’s variable, what will the new payment be at 
different interest rates? (By the way, while you’re compiling this information, 
it may be a good time to review the loan terms and conditions, if it’s been a 
few years since you originally got the mortgage.)
 
What other loans do you have? What interest are you paying on them? Keep 
in mind that loans secured by the home, such as a home equity line of credit 
(HELOC), generally have lower interest rates than other loans.
In Table 7-3, we show you an example of what the liability portion of your 
LCP may look like. In this example, liabilities include a mortgage and a 
HELOC.

Income
To develop the third part of your LCP, look at all your sources of income. 
These may include compensation (while you’re still working), pensions and 
deferred compensation (after you’ve stopped working), and also annuities, 
Social Security benefit payments, and income from your investments.
Table 7-4 shows a sample of what the income portion of a person’s LCP may 
look like over the next ten years. (Don’t worry just yet how we got data for 
years 2 through 10 — we get to that in the “Putting It All Together: Making 
Lifetime Cash-Flow Projections” section, a little later.) In this figure, we 
assume that the person is 60 years old and planning to work for five more 
years before retiring. The current salary is $120,000 per year, which 
is expected to grow at 3 percent every year. This person will qualify for a 
fixed pension in retirement. Social Security payments will start at normal 
retirement age and will also increase at 3 percent. Withdrawals, which are 
counted as income, are expected during retirement and are assumed to 
increase at 3 percent.

126
Part II: Getting Started 
In the following sections, we go into greater detail on the various sources of 
income you may have.
Compensation: Wages, salaries, and bonuses
If you’re currently working, direct compensation — base wages or salary 
and any cash incentive pay — is probably your primary source of income. 
Business owners have self-employment income and profit. List your gross 
compensation, not what you actually take home. In the next section, you 
list each deduction from your paycheck — taxes, insurance payments, and 
401(k) contributions — separately under expenses. Catalog each source of 
compensation income separately on your LCP.
If you’re married and your spouse works, list your compensation and your 
spouse’s compensation separately. This will help you address key questions 
such as: What happens if my spouse or I retires earlier or later? Can either 
one of us afford to work part-time or stop working altogether to take care of 
the children? If so, then at what point will we have to go back to work? (We 
get to those types of questions in the “Testing ‘What If’ Scenarios” section, 
later in this chapter.)
In order to project your compensation into the future (more on that later), 
start thinking about the following questions: At what rate will various parts of 
my compensation grow? How many more years do I intend to work?
You may also be entitled to deferred compensation benefits. Determine (with 
assistance from your company’s human resources department, if necessary) 
what the amounts and timing will be of these benefits and include them as 
part of your future income.
Pensions and retirement account distributions
Are you entitled to a government or corporate pension? Companies have largely 
abandoned pensions in favor of 401(k)s and/or cash balance plans, but pen-
sions are still a standard benefit for government employees and some teachers. 
Many companies also still have a pension program for their key executives.
 
If you aren’t receiving a pension yet and you aren’t sure of your benefit, 
contact your company’s human resources department to help you estimate 
what the amount will be when you retire. If you’re married, that amount may 
depend on how much you decide you want your spouse to receive if you die 
first. Be sure to ask what your options are and what the pension amounts are 
under each option. Also, ask when you’ll first be eligible and, after you start 
receiving the benefit, whether it’ll increase over time for inflation.
The pension you’re currently entitled to may be significantly lower than 
the pension you’ll likely be entitled to when you retire. In the LCP, enter the 
amount you expect to receive when you retire, as well as how much you 
expect it to grow each year.

127
 Chapter 7: Developing Your Investment Strategy
Traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts will be subject to mandatory distribu-
tions at certain ages and count as income. Roth 401(k)s, Roth IRAs, and inher-
ited accounts are subject to different rules. Ask your financial or tax advisor 
to estimate the amounts and timing of income from these accounts. (Find out 
how to pick an advisor in Chapter 16.)
Stock options
Are you entitled to stock options from your employer? Do you know if the 
options are qualified or non-qualified? When do they vest? When do they expire? 
When is the best time to exercise? What will they be worth when you exercise 
them? What taxes will you pay when you exercise the option or sell the stock?
You may be able to get answers to these questions from your human 
resources department, but a financial professional with expertise in stock 
options may be an even better choice. No matter how you locate the informa-
tion, you’ll need it as you complete your LCP.
 
Due to the volatility of a typical company’s stock price, you may want to enter 
0 for how much you’ll receive unless your stock options vest soon and are 
already valuable, just to be on the safe side.
Annuities
Do you own any annuities? What is the annuity payment? Is it a fixed amount 
or does it increase with inflation or vary according to the performance of 
some market index? When do the payments start and when do they end? 
Note the answers to these questions, because they come into play in the 
“Putting It All Together: Making Lifetime Cash-Flow Projections” section, later 
in this chapter.
If you don’t already own an annuity, should you purchase one? This is a ques-
tion that the LCP will help you address. (It’s an example of a “what if” ques-
tion, other examples of which we cover in the “Testing ‘What If’ Scenarios” 
section, a little later in this chapter.)
Social Security
Once a year, the Social Security Administration mails all taxpayers a state-
ment of their projected Social Security benefits at different retirement ages. 
(This information is also available online at www.ssa.gov.) Social Security 
payments increase annually with inflation.
With the concern over the viability of Social Security, one question today 
is whether you should even include these benefits in your LCP. If you’re 
within ten years of retirement or you’re already receiving benefits, it’s a safe 
assumption to put in your expected or current level of benefits. If you have 
longer than that until retirement, then it’s difficult to predict what benefit 
you’ll actually receive. On the one hand, it’s unlikely that the government will 

128
Part II: Getting Started 
suddenly discontinue a program that provides the only source of funds for a 
large number of people. But on the other hand, a decrease in benefits is pos-
sible, because the current level of benefits isn’t sustainable at current levels 
of funding.
 
You can test your vulnerability to changes in Social Security by using your 
LCP. Set the benefit to the amount shown on your Social Security statement, 
as well as to a lower amount, and don’t escalate future payments for infla-
tion. If, for example, you set your benefit to zero and you’re still in the black 
(your income exceeds your expenses) every year, then the viability of Social 
Security isn’t something you need to worry about — at least not for yourself.
Withdrawals
During some years, your expenses (which we catalog in the next section) 
may exceed your income. In those years, you’ll need to make withdrawals 
from one or more of your asset accounts to make up the shortfall. Because 
those withdrawals represent cash inflows to you, they should be counted in 
the income category.
As we mention earlier, some minimum distributions (from your traditional 
401(k)s and/or IRAs, for example) are required beginning at age 701/2. These 
should also be included in withdrawals and, thus, counted as income during 
those years.
Expenses
The final part of your LCP covers your expenses. The degree of detail is up to 
you — you can simply get an annual estimate using the “total withdrawals” 
value on your monthly bank statements, or you can do a full accounting of 
exactly where your money is going.
 
If you do a full accounting of your expenses when working on your LCP, 
double-check your total numbers with the bank statements. Don’t overlook 
other places where you’re paying out money, such as paycheck deductions.
Table 7-5 shows a sample of what the expense portion of your LCP may look 
like. Note that the income tax on investment growth for the taxable account 
is based on the assumed amount of taxable assets, which we calculate in the 
“Assets” section earlier in this chapter. Remember to estimate a lump sum 
figure for annual living expenses, even though you may have used a detailed 
worksheet to get there, and inflate it each year at 3 percent. Mortgage and 
medical care are listed separately, and are inflated at different rates (0 per-
cent and 6 percent, respectively).

 Chapter 7: Developing Your Investment Strategy
In the following sections, we go into detail on the various expenses you 
may have.
Annual living expenses
The first item in the expense portion of your LCP is your annual living 
expense estimate. This is likely to be your largest expense item, and is proba-
bly the single most important item in your entire LCP. Annual living expenses 
are expenses that you expect to have every year, and that you expect will 
grow with the general rate of inflation.
Annual living expenses include such items as housing, clothing, personal 
care, food, insurance, transportation, gifts, charitable contributions, enter-
tainment, and capital expenditures (things like new roofs and replacement 
cars that you don’t necessarily expect to incur every year, but you want to 
anticipate and set aside an appropriate amount to cover — for example, 
if you expect to buy a new car every five years, set aside one-fifth of the 
expected cost in your annual living expense estimate).
You’ll notice, in Table 7-5, that we don’t list a cost for each and every annual 
living expense item in the LCP — we just have the lump sum. What you buy 
may change over time, but the amount you spend annually will likely stay 
relatively stable, inflation aside.
Other expenses — those that are either not expected to be ongoing, or will 
grow at a different rate of inflation — are treated separately. We cover those 
expenses in the next few sections.
Loan payments
Calculate loan payments when you prepare your liability statement (see the 
“Liabilities” section, earlier). For each loan, enter the payment amount and 
the time over which you’ll be making the payments.
List your mortgage separately. If you’re paying a fixed interest rate, then 
your loan payments shouldn’t increase with inflation. Payments for home 
insurance, property taxes, and private mortgage insurance (PMI) are often 
bundled with the actual loan payments. Include only the actual principal 
and interest payments here. At some point, mortgage payments will stop. If 
you’re paying PMI, then those payments will stop well before the mortgage 
payments. (Note: Include home insurance and property taxes in the annual 
living expense category, as we describe in the preceding section.)

132
Part II: Getting Started 
Medical care
If you’re in good health and have a generous health insurance policy through 
your employer, then this may be an easy expense to overlook. Why include 
an expense that currently may be minimal? Because, as you age, medical 
care may become a significant part of your budget. Over time, you’re likely to 
have more health problems, which will require more doctor’s visits, exams, 
and prescriptions. Unless of course you manage to find that pesky fountain of 
youth, and if you do, please give us a call.
If you don’t have retiree health benefits through your employer, then you’ll 
rely on Medicare and supplemental insurance products, which will probably 
not be as comprehensive as the corporate policy you enjoyed while working. 
Medical costs have been increasing at the rate of about 6 percent per year — 
or twice the general rate of inflation — and are projected to continue to do so.
Education costs
List higher-education costs separately, because they’re a significant expense 
over a limited period of time and have been increasing as quickly as medical 
costs. In estimating what the costs may be, include not just tuition but also 
room and board, books, travel, and incidentals. In developing your LCP, think 
about what you’ll be able to pay and how much in loans you’ll need to cover 
everything.
 
Pay particular attention to two sets of costs in developing your LCP. Education 
costs, along with medical costs, have been increasing at a rate of 6 percent 
annually — twice the general rate of inflation — and are expected to continue 
to do so.
Weddings, vacations, and other special events
Weddings, bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs, big vacations — these are all won-
derful events, but they usually come with big price tags. Because these costs 
are not recurring and you have some control over the amount and/or timing, 
you may want to put them in a separate category, which we call “extra 
expenses.” Any other large expenses, such as home remodeling (and maybe 
that Faberge egg collection you’ve been thinking about for years), should go 
here as well.

133
 Chapter 7: Developing Your Investment Strategy
Taxes
How much are you paying in income taxes now? To project how much you 
might pay in income taxes in the future, calculate an average tax rate (your 
taxes divided by your gross income) instead of the dollar amount of taxes 
you currently pay. Doing so will allow you to automatically adjust your tax 
estimate in future years as your income changes.
 
Your average tax rate isn’t the same thing as your marginal tax rate; your mar-
ginal rate indicates how much you pay on your last dollar of income in a given 
year (it reflects your highest tax bracket), and doesn’t take any deductions or 
credits into account. For these reasons, your marginal tax rate will generally 
overstate your average tax rate.
 
When calculating your average income tax rate, be sure to include
 
✓ Federal taxes
 
✓ State and local taxes
 
✓ Social Security and Medicare taxes
Consider the tax rate on each current source of income you list in the income 
statement.
What portion of your current income do you earn through your job? Your 
business? Your taxable investments? If you’re self-employed, you pay up to 
an additional 7.65 percent in self-employment tax. You don’t pay any Social 
Security or Medicare taxes on realized long-term capital gains and quali-
fied dividends, which are also currently taxed at lower rates than ordinary 
income. And you don’t get taxed on withdrawals from taxable accounts.
If you’re not currently retired, what might your average income tax rate be in 
retirement? Depending on your income from other sources, up to 85 percent 
of your Social Security payments may be taxable. Your pension is taxable. 
Annuities are partially taxable. Any withdrawals you make from a traditional 
IRA or 401(k) are taxable, too. Clearly these are important considerations. 
The LCP will help you estimate what income you will have in retirement 
and the source of this income, which will help you determine your average 
tax rate.

134
Part II: Getting Started 
Withdrawals from certain other tax-advantaged accounts aren’t taxable, pro-
vided that the necessary conditions are met. Examples are Roth IRAs, 529 
plans, ESAs, and HSAs.
Your accountant, or a financial program such as Quicken, can help calculate 
your future average income tax rate.
 
Taxes other than income taxes, such as property taxes, should be included in 
the annual living expenses portion of your LCP.
Savings
How much do you need to save to achieve your goals? How much can you 
afford to save at different times in your life? And in which account should the 
money be saved? The LCP will help you answer all these questions. When 
you estimate your savings amounts each year, enter them into your LCP.
Just as withdrawals from your asset accounts represent cash inflows to you 
and are counted as income (per the earlier section), savings you deposit 
into those accounts represent cash outflows to you, so they’re categorized 
with expenses. In that sense, savings are a “good” kind of expense. (A “bad” 
expense might be the 30-foot ice sculpture of yourself that you commis-
sioned, or that pair of $500 glow-in-the-dark sunglasses you picked up on 
vacation.)
Putting It All Together: Making 
Lifetime Cash-Flow Projections
If you work through all the steps in the previous section, you have all the 
pieces you need to put together your LCP. Table 7-6 is an example of what a 
finished LCP looks like. As you can see, after the initial amounts are entered 
for Year 1 it’s possible to make some calculations to project what your LCP 
might look like in the future. In this section, we guide you through some of 
the key calculations you need in order to make these revealing projections.

Part II: Getting Started 
Before we get into the calculations that give you your future LCP projections, 
though, we want to call your attention to two key items in the LCP:
 
✓ Your net cash flow, which is your income less expenses
 
✓ Your assets at the end of the year plus your net cash flow
While you’re working, it’s good to have your net cash flow be positive. This 
may not happen every year, particularly when there’s a large expense such 
as college or a wedding. When you stop working, you want to make sure 
the sum of your assets and net cash flow remains positive throughout your 
lifetime. When that number hits zero or below, that means you’ve run out of 
money — you’ve outlived your assets — which is not a good thing. Ways to 
avoid such a bad outcome, before it’s too late, include working more, adjust-
ing your lifestyle, and considering a different investment strategy. (These 
and other approaches are discussed in the “Testing ‘What If’ Scenarios” and 
“Determining How Your Asset Allocation May Affect Your Lifetime Cash-Flow 
Projection” sections, later in this chapter.)
The example LCP in Table 7-6 shows what a current LCP can look like, and it 
projects the next ten years. How can you make the same projections on your 
LCP? Read on to find out.
Salary and other income
To project your salary and other income into the future, first increase all your 
income items throughout the years by the growth rate you assumed. In the 
sample LCP presented in Table 7-6, we assume an annual salary of $120,000 
with 3 percent growth per year. In Year 2, here’s the projected salary:
Salary in Year 1 × (1 + growth rate) = salary in Year 2
$120,000 x 1.03 = $123,600
Keep multiplying each year’s salary by the growth rate to get the following 
year’s salary.
You project your other income in the same way.
Expenses
To project your future expenses on your LCP, you need to start by increasing 
your Year 1 expenses by a percentage, and then continue to increase them by 
that percentage each year. For the expense in the LCP example in Table 7-6, 
we assume $50,000 for annual living expenses growing at 3 percent per year, 

139
 Chapter 7: Developing Your Investment Strategy
not including mortgage and medical expenses. In Year 2, that means that the 
estimated expenses will be $50,000 × 1.03 = $51,500. Because we assume a 
fixed mortgage, its growth rate is zero. Medical expenses start out at $7,500, 
but increase at 6 percent per year, which would make them $7,500 × 1.06 = 
$7,950 in Year 2. Keep multiplying the expense in each year by the growth 
rate to get the projected expense in the following year.
Investment returns
For your investments, enter some constant rate of growth for now. This will 
keep the numbers simple and make it easier for you to check that the LCP is 
calculating everything correctly. Use the assumed growth rates to calculate 
your asset growth each year. For example, in the sample LCP presented in 
Table 7-6, we assume a beginning taxable asset balance of $190,000 with 7 
percent growth per year. In Year 1, the growth amount on those assets would 
be as follows:
Beginning Balance of Assets in Year 1 × Growth Rate = Growth in Year 1
$190,000 × 0.07 = $13,300
Beginning Balance of Assets in Year 2 × Growth Rate = Growth in Year 2
$203,300 × 0.07 = $14,231
And so forth for subsequent years. (We look at how to make these growth 
rates more realistic in the “Determining How Your Asset Allocation May 
Affect Your Lifetime Cash-Flow Projection” section, later in this chapter.)
Taxes
Figuring out the tax projections on your LCP is relatively easy. For each year, 
calculate the estimated tax on each item of income, using the average tax rate 
you calculate in the “Expenses” portion of the “Coming Up with an Outline for 
Your Long-Term Financial Plan” section, earlier in this chapter.
 
Don’t forget to include the tax on realized investment growth and dividends, 
as well as any withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts.
Savings or withdrawals
You may want to enter the amount of savings or withdrawals last. If the LCP 
shows that your income exceeds your expenses, consider setting a goal to 
save what you estimate the difference to be. For example, the sample LCP in 

140
Part II: Getting Started 
Table 7-6 shows that in Year 4 there should be a surplus of almost $6,000. In 
that case, we suggest setting a goal for that year to save $2,000 in the taxable 
account and $3,500 in the tax-advantaged account.
 
You may be asking yourself, “What accounts should I save to or withdraw 
from?” When it comes to saving, priority should be given to tax-advantaged 
accounts to the extent you can (as long as you don’t need the money pre-
maturely or for purposes that would violate the tax-advantage rules of that 
account). When withdrawing funds, priority should be given to taxable 
accounts. You want the money to be in the tax-advantaged accounts for as 
long as possible to prolong the amount of time that you get the tax-deferred 
growth.
 
Don’t forget to adjust the amount of projected assets by any contributions or 
withdrawals made.
 
When taking out required minimum distributions from your tax-advantaged 
accounts, do so toward the end of the year, so you can receive more months 
of tax-deferred growth out of those funds.
Time horizon revisited
In Chapter 6, and in the “Understanding the 
Lifetime Cash-Flow Projection” section, earlier 
in this chapter, we discuss the issue of invest-
ment horizon. It’s an important issue, and you 
need to factor it into your LCP. Put simply: For 
how many years should the LCP continue? 
Ideally, it should continue throughout your 
investment horizon.
But let’s be frank. The whole discussion about 
your expected time horizon is really a polite 
way of exploring the very uncomfortable ques-
tion of how long you should assume you’ll live. 
Unless you’re already in poor health, a reason-
able assumption is that you will live a long time. 
With advances in medicine, you may live well 
into your 90s.
A deceptively simple way to get a more pre-
cise number is to use your life expectancy, 
which you can get from online actuarial tables. 
However, this is a misleadingly short amount of 
time. Life expectancy measures how long about 
half of the people your age will survive. In other 
words, roughly half the people are expected 
to outlive their “life expectancy”. A financial 
plan that manages to get you safely to your life 
expectancy, and no further, has a 50 percent 
chance of failing! So, unless your health or your 
family’s longevity argue for something much 
shorter, it would be prudent to project your LCP 
out to age 100.
However, as with any projection that tries to 
model something as uncertain as your financial 
life, going more than, at most, 40 years out from 
today introduces too much room for error. Cap 
your LCP projection period at 40 years. You’ll 
want to update your LCP about every year 
anyway, so if you need to project over a longer 
span, you’ll have plenty of time to get more 
years in there down the road.

141
 Chapter 7: Developing Your Investment Strategy
Assets
You project the amount of assets in each type of account as follows:
Balance at the Beginning of the Year + Investment Growth (Based on 
Assumed Earnings Rate) + Contributions (From the Savings in the 
Expense Section) – Withdrawals (From the Income Section) = Balance at 
the Beginning of Next Year
Any money left in “Net Cash Flow” in any year is added to your non-invested 
asset balance at the beginning of the next year.
Liabilities
There’s no need to project liability balances directly on the LCP. You use the 
information you compiled on your liabilities to generate the related expense 
items (annual mortgage payments, for example) each year. That’s all you 
really need the initial liability information for.
Testing “What If” Scenarios
Now comes the really interesting part — using your LCP to see how different 
life events and choices may affect you financially. In this section, we explore 
some of the common life events that have profound effects on people’s 
financial situations. Seeing how we analyze these situations should help 
you address additional questions you may have about your own financial 
scenarios.
As you read through these examples, you’ll notice that your LCP is really a 
living document, not a one-time exercise. After you’ve done the work to set it 
up, it should be easy to update it annually and to use it to answer all sorts of 
financial questions you’ll be asking yourself throughout your life.
What if you retire early?
Although some people can’t imagine life without their current career, other 
people have a whole to-do list of the things they can’t wait to do when they 
retire. If you fall in the latter group, you may want to know if you can afford 
to get a head start on that list by retiring early.

142
Part II: Getting Started 
To test if this is possible, make these adjustments to your LCP:
 
1. Pick an age at which you plan to retire.
 
2. Stop all sources of income that you expect to end when you retire at 
your new retirement age.
 
 When stopping your income, consider each item you listed separately. 
For example, your wages may end but your investment income will 
continue.
 
3. Start any source of income you may be eligible for when you retire 
early.
 
 If you’re considering starting a new career in retirement, enter a conser-
vative estimate of what you think your new salary may be in each year. 
Consider the earliest age at which you may be eligible to receive the new 
source of income, the amount if you start claiming it prior to full retire-
ment age, and any penalties you may have to pay.
 
 For example, Social Security payments can be claimed starting at age 62, 
but will permanently be 20 percent to 30 percent less than what you’d 
receive at full retirement age (the Social Security Administration defines 
your full retirement age based on your year of birth). On retirement 
accounts, you can start drawing distributions without penalty starting at 
age 591/2.
 
 You can start drawing distributions on retirement accounts before you 
turn 591/2 years old without penalty, by making substantially equal peri-
odic payments (SEPP), also called 72(t) payments (after the IRS rule that 
defines them), over your lifetime.
 
 In a 401(k) plan, funds can be withdrawn as early as age 55 without pen-
alty. This option is no longer available if you roll over the 401(k) into 
an IRA. If you’re considering retiring prior to age 591/2, this may be a 
reason to leave the money in the 401(k). Contact your human resources 
department or your accountant or financial advisor to help you deter-
mine the consequences of starting withdrawals from different accounts 
at different ages.
 
4. Adjust your expenses, if you think they’ll be substantially higher or 
lower.
 
 When you retire, do you see yourself doing a lot more traveling or 
maybe going back to school? Do you see these expenses as being perma-
nent increases in your lifestyle or one-time events? Are there any large 
expenses that you’ll no longer have when you stop working? Make sure 
to include the net difference in your expense estimates.

 Chapter 7: Developing Your Investment Strategy
If your LCP shows that you can afford to retire early, then go ahead and enjoy 
yourself! But what if the results show that you’ll run out of money? There are 
many adjustments to the LCP you can try. For example:
 
✓ Consider working part-time during retirement.
 
✓ Increase the age at which you claim Social Security or start taking with-
drawals from your retirement accounts.
 
✓ Decrease current expenses and increase savings.
 
✓ Decrease future expenses.
 
✓ Delay your early retirement age.
Some combination of these changes may be enough to allow you to retire 
earlier (except for the last one, of course). If you have to make drastic and 
uncomfortable changes to your current or future lifestyle, that may indicate 
that early retirement is not a good option for you.
What if you start a family 
or have more children?
Few things have a more profound lifelong effect on your finances than having 
children. There are the additional expenses and possibly lower income 
levels. Plus, having kids puts a crunch on saving during your pre-retirement 
years, which makes it all the more urgent to diligently plan for retirement. 
Also, if one parent decides to stop working or work part-time while the young 
ones are growing, then planning is essential to ensure the family’s long-term 
financial well-being.
One of the first questions that prospective parents must address is: Who will 
watch the kids? In the early years, one of the largest expenses will be the cost 
of the children’s care. This may include the cost of babysitting if both par-
ents work, or the loss of income from the parent who quits work or reduces 
his or her hours to stay home. Here’s one question you may want to explore: 
If one parent stops working full time, for how long can your family afford that 
arrangement?
Housing is another child-related expense you may have to consider. If you 
have a larger family, you may need a bigger house. (Where else are you going 
to put all those toys?) This can mean a bigger mortgage, higher property 
taxes, additional maintenance costs, more furniture — the list goes on and 
on. Then there are all the day-to-day expenses of having children like buying 
diapers, extra food, various baby paraphernalia, activities, and much more.

144
Part II: Getting Started 
After the kids get through high school, you may need to pay for college. This 
is a complex area of planning in itself. You can use the LCP to help you deter-
mine how much you can realistically save for college. If your children will be 
attending college soon, then you can also use the LCP to help you determine 
the amount of loans you can afford to take on.
 
Although our advice may go against parental instincts, planning for your own 
retirement should take precedence over planning for your children’s college. 
There are many options for financing the cost of college, but you can’t get a 
scholarship or even a loan for retirement! And the best gift you can give your 
kids is not being a financial burden to them in your old age.
As a parent of young children, you must also be concerned about what may 
happen to them if something happens to you. You may want to consider 
increasing your emergency fund, because there are a lot more emergencies 
that can come up and higher expenses to maintain. You may want to pur-
chase or increase your life insurance and disability insurance.
And then there’s the wedding to pay for. . . .
What if you want to change your career?
Today people often switch careers, sometimes several times over the course 
of their working lives. Maybe you’re disillusioned with your profession and 
want to do something you’d find more fulfilling. Maybe you want to start your 
own business. If the change will entail significant expenses or a period of time 
when your earnings will be lower, then you may want to do some long-range 
planning with your LCP.
If changing your career will require you to go back to school, make sure to 
consider the cost of tuition and other fees, and include them in expenses 
on your LCP. If the training is to enhance your current career and you’re 
paying for it yourself, then consider what the extra salary potential might be 
to determine if it’s really worth it. The LCP will help you compare apples to 
apples by comparing the cost of the school to the after-tax increase in your 
salary.
Will the career switch require either a temporary or permanent reduction in 
earnings? Will you be able to support your lifestyle using current savings, or 
will you need to cut your expenses? If the LCP indicates that expenses would 
have to be significantly reduced to live on a lower projected salary, try to live 
now within what your future means will be to see if it’s feasible for you. Giving 
it a try is a great way to figure out whether you’ll be able to deal with it over 
an extended period of time.

145
 Chapter 7: Developing Your Investment Strategy
How will the career switch affect your retirement? With your projected 
income and expenses, what will you be able to save? How might your benefits 
change? If, for example, you’re considering becoming a teacher, you’ll likely 
be eligible to receive a pension and you may get retiree health benefits. For 
government jobs, a lot of this information is available online. If you’re leav-
ing your current place of employment, are you giving up a pension or will 
it be significantly reduced? If so, make the appropriate adjustments to your 
income on your LCP.
Another way a new profession can impact your retirement is your chances 
of continuing employment after you’re past normal retirement age. Certain 
professions (like teaching) offer many part-time opportunities; others force 
you to retire at a certain age (commercial airline pilots, for example, can’t fly 
after age 65).
If the LCP shows that it would be very difficult to switch careers, then you 
may want to consider making adjustments to your initial assumptions. Maybe 
instead of quitting your current job, you can continue employment there 
while starting the new business on the side or going to school on nights and 
weekends. You might consider delaying the start of the new venture until you 
can save more money to fund the business or to help meet expenses. The 
LCP will help you make these important decisions.
Determining How Your Asset Allocation 
May Affect Your Lifetime Cash-Flow 
Projection
One of the most important ways you can use your LCP to help you achieve 
your financial goals is to test how various asset allocations will perform for 
you. This section shows you how to do just that.
The idea is to try different asset allocations, run them through your LCP, and 
see which of them gets you the best result. By best result, we mean the “what 
if” scenario that has your assets outliving you with the highest probability.
How do you get to this best-case scenario? Start with getting a handle on 
the risk and return characteristics of various asset allocations. To keep the 
number of possible asset allocations manageable, we confine our review to 
those on the efficient frontier (see Chapters 2 and 6). In fact, for purposes 
of this discussion, we confine the candidate asset allocations (portfolios) to 
three, representing investment strategies we’ll call conservative, moderate, 
and aggressive.

146
Part II: Getting Started 
Now we need to determine the risk and return characteristics of each of 
these three candidate portfolios, and work those characteristics into the LCP. 
We start with return.
Estimating returns
You’re surely familiar with the mantra “Past performance is no guarantee of 
future results,” but the truth is that historical returns are often the starting 
point for projecting future returns.
For each asset that you’re considering investing in, obtain the historical 
returns over as long a period of time as you can get your hands on. You want 
to make sure that the returns span a long enough time so that you can see 
how the asset behaved in both bull and bear markets. To get a head start, flip 
to Chapter 17 and look at the annual returns for ten common asset classes 
for the years 1988 through 2007.
You can calculate how a specific asset allocation would’ve performed in each 
year by taking the weighted average of the component assets’ annual returns. 
For example, say you’re interested in a very simple moderate portfolio that 
is invested 50 percent in corporate bonds and 50 percent in large-cap stocks. 
(See Chapters 3 and 9 for descriptions of corporate bonds and large-cap 
stocks.) In 2007, their respective returns were 4.6 percent and 5.5 percent. 
Your portfolio would’ve had the following return that year:
(0.5 × 0.046) + (0.5 × 0.055) = 0.023 + 0.0275 = 0.0505, or 5.05 percent
By doing the preceding calculation for each period of available data, you can 
find out how each candidate asset allocation would’ve performed in the past. 
You can do this for as many different periods as you want and compare the 
relative historic returns of your three candidate portfolios. From this history, 
you can then select a return that fairly represents the expected future return 
for each of the three portfolios.
Reckoning risk
Next, you need to derive a measure of risk for each of the three portfolios. 
One way to do that is to calculate the range of returns for each candidate 
portfolio for each of the previous years you can get your hands on. (You can 
again use Chapter 17 as your source for this information.) Another way is to 
calculate the standard deviation for each portfolio over the same period. (We 
cover how to calculate range and standard deviation in Chapter 2.)

147
 Chapter 7: Developing Your Investment Strategy
Working risk and return into your 
Lifetime Cash-flow Projection
After you figure out your measures of risk and return for each of your three 
candidate portfolios (conservative, moderate, and aggressive), you need to 
work them into your LCP.
Working in your return is straightforward — for each portfolio, you can simply 
use the portfolio return you just derived to calculate the investment growth we 
talk about earlier in the “Investment returns” section (also see Table 7-6).
 
It’s a good idea to add an element of conservatism whenever you make long-
term projections, so you may want to use a return a percentage point or so 
less than the one you calculated. If you’re going to be surprised, it’s better for 
it to be a pleasant surprise than the alternative.
Reflecting the risk of each portfolio is a little more complicated. A very 
simple way to reflect risk is to use the high and low ends of the range of 
returns you derived earlier for each portfolio and run them through your 
LCP. This will give you a range of potential LCPs, but because this approach 
is so simple, the results can be unrealistic. However, if the worst of these 
LCPs shows your assets outliving you, then you can be quite confident that 
you’ll be okay no matter what happens. For most investors, though, this 
worst-case scenario won’t work out well for you — it’ll likely show you outliv-
ing your assets. In that case, you might try different “what if” scenarios, using 
a different return for each year of your LCP, drawing from within the histori-
cal range of returns. This will give you some indication of the safety of your 
financial future, but it doesn’t quantify it in any systematic way.
What you really need is a way to calculate something more useful and mean-
ingful, namely the probability that your assets will outlive you. How do you 
do that? You can either try to go it alone (see the next paragraph) or hire a 
professional. (You can read all about how to hire a terrific financial advisor in 
Chapter 16.)
 
Professional investors use the risk (standard deviation, for example) and 
return measures for each portfolio to create probability distributions of 
returns for each asset class. They then simulate thousands of different pos-
sible LCPs based on those probability distributions. In other words, for each 
portfolio, they generate thousands of scenarios of what the portfolio’s returns 
might be like in the future. This process is called Monte Carlo simulation. Its 
advantage is that instead of looking only at what has already happened, it also 
helps you project what might happen in the future. There are financial pro-
grams available that will allow you to do Monte Carlo simulations, based on 
expected returns and standard deviations that you input.

148
Part II: Getting Started 
 
Whether you do it yourself or hire the work out, the result you’re looking for 
after all this analysis is this: Which of the candidate portfolios (that is, which 
of the three — conservative, moderate, or aggressive, in our example) gives 
you the greatest probability of your assets outliving you in your LCP? That’s 
the portfolio for you.
For some investors, that ideal portfolio may be the most conservative one. 
For others, it might be the most aggressive. Or it could be something in the 
middle. It all depends on your lifetime cash-flow needs. You just don’t know 
for sure without going through the exercise.
For many investors, it makes sense, no matter where you start, to move to 
progressively more conservative investment strategies as you age. (We also 
address this issue in Chapter 8.) Using your LCP, you can plan how to make 
that transition — that is, what transition plan results in the highest prob-
ability of your assets outliving you? In doing this exercise, you make the leap 
from deciding on an asset allocation, to deciding on a long-term asset alloca-
tion strategy.
Are there any shortcuts to all this work, especially if you’re willing to accept 
a portfolio that may not be ideal but that’s good enough? Sure there are, and 
we cover some of them in Chapter 8.
Documenting Your Strategy: Drafting 
Your Investment Policy Statement
After you determine your investment strategy (conservative, aggressive, 
or something in between), document your decision in an Investment Policy 
Statement (IPS), which helps you (and your financial advisor, if you have one) 
stay focused and not veer off the path you want to take. Even if you don’t hire 
a financial advisor, we recommend that you create your own IPS. It’s simple 
to do so — just write down your selections for the following eight items:
 
✓ Your investment time horizon
 
✓ Your return objectives
 
✓ Your risk tolerance
 
✓ Your tax situation
 
✓ Your portfolio constraints

149
 Chapter 7: Developing Your Investment Strategy
 
✓ Your special circumstances
 
✓ Your resulting investment strategy (for example, conservative, moder-
ate, aggressive)
 
✓ Your asset allocation percentages
Each of these elements is introduced in Chapter 6 and revisited in Chapter 8. 
Your LCP will help you pinpoint what these should be for you.
Most financial advisors that you may hire to handle your investments would, 
in fact, require that you execute an IPS with them. The benefit of an IPS is that 
it clearly spells out all the key elements of your investment-strategy decision.

Creating Your Allocation Plan
In This Chapter
▶ Picking your asset classes
▶ Creating your own asset mix
▶ Taking a look at some sample allocations
▶ Setting up an allocation review schedule
I
n this chapter, we show you how to create your own asset allocation plan. 
This is where the magic happens!
We kick off the chapter with a quick review of the detailed discussion of asset 
classes and subclasses found in Chapter 3, so that you can be familiar with 
the types of assets you’ll want to include in your allocation plan. Then we 
move on to establishing your own specific mix of these assets. In doing so, 
you’ll want to keep your eye on the long term. Figuring out the right alloca-
tion percentages is a real science, and we show you how the pros do it. Then 
we talk about how you can do it on your own.
This chapter also contains some sample asset allocations, sharing some 
examples and guidelines across a range of investment strategies, from 
conservative to aggressive. And we walk you through a detailed portfolio, 
complete with asset classes and subclasses, that we develop for a fictional 
couple, John and Jane Doe.
Finally, even though your asset allocation decisions should be made for the 
long term, we discuss when you should do periodic reviews.
 
Before you dive into the important task of setting up your allocation plan, we 
suggest that you take a spin through Chapter 3 if you need to bone up on the 
various types of asset classes and subclasses that you can incorporate in your 
plan. It also wouldn’t hurt to look at Chapter 4, especially if you don’t feel quite 
up to speed on the concept of mixing assets together in the right proportions. 
Finally, check out Chapters 6 and 7 if you need to know more about developing 
your investment strategy.

Part II: Getting Started 
Selecting Your Asset Classes
To create a balanced, effective portfolio, you need to take care to select the 
right asset classes. It’s like preparing a gourmet meal: If you don’t pick your 
ingredients wisely, your effort will be doomed from the get-go.
 
In Chapter 3, we discuss and describe the various asset classes and sub-
classes. You can flip forward to Chapter 17 to see the historical performance 
of several of those assets.
Which of these asset classes are right for you? Well, it all depends on your 
specific situation. You can read all of those details in Chapter 3, but here’s a 
quick rundown with some bits of universal advice:
 
✓ Cash is the least volatile asset class and can provide lots of stability to a 
portfolio. But it’s also the asset class most likely to fall behind inflation 
over the long term. You should keep just enough cash in your portfolio 
to meet your short-term (less than 12-month) spending needs, and no 
more. Keep too much cash, and you run the very real risk of seeing 
your portfolio consistently lose purchasing power over time. Cash is for 
liquidity, not for investing.
 
✓ Fixed-income investments (bonds and bond funds) add stability to your 
portfolio. That’s their role. Don’t expect high returns from bonds. You 
can expect good solid bonds and bond funds to deliver returns several 
percentage points above inflation over the long term. But don’t reach for 
higher returns by buying bonds of lower credit quality; it’s not worth the 
gamble. High returns are the province of other asset classes.
 
✓ Equities (stocks and stock funds) belong in virtually every portfolio, 
regardless of how conservative they are. Don’t be afraid to stock up on 
stocks! Over real-life investment horizons (several decades, for exam-
ple), they’re among the best inflation beaters you can find. Why? Over 
the long haul, the average annual total return for equities in general 
has exceeded 10 percent. And the short-term volatility in those returns 
becomes less and less material the longer you’re invested.
 
✓ Alternatives such as real estate and commodities belong in most portfo-
lios. Although they tend to be volatile, these asset classes paradoxically 
bring stability to the overall portfolio. Why? Because they tend to zig 
when the rest of your portfolio zags — meaning that when the rest of the 
portfolio underperforms, alternative investments will tend to outperform 
(see Chapter 13). And, over long investment horizons, alternatives also 
boast total returns that have averaged more than 10 percent per year.
 
✓ Hedge funds, private equity, derivatives, and other exotic investments 
aren’t for you, unless you’re a very seasoned, sophisticated investor. 
Think of them as you would exotic pets. It may be okay for a snake expert 
to keep a slithering python in the backyard, but for the average pet owner, 
it’s a big mistake. Stay away from pythons — and from exotic investments.

153
 Chapter 8: Creating Your Allocation Plan
 
When selecting your asset classes, stick to fixed income, equities, real estate, 
and commodities.
You may be thinking, how do you actually invest in each asset class? We 
discuss specific investments to buy in Chapter 9, but before you can do that, 
you first have to determine something pretty fundamental: how much of each 
asset class to buy. This is the next logical step in the systematic, scientific, 
top-down approach to investing.
 
As you work your way through this chapter (and this book), keep in mind that 
what you’re allocating is your overall portfolio of invested assets. This portfo-
lio may comprise several accounts (your IRA, your spouse’s IRA, a joint invest-
ment account you share with your spouse, and so on). You want to allocate at 
the overall, aggregate portfolio level.
Don’t be concerned just yet about how to allocate within each of your com-
ponent accounts — we cover that in Chapter 10 (on asset location).
Establishing Your Asset Class Mix
Picking the asset classes you want in your portfolio is one thing. After you’ve 
made those decisions, though, you’ll have to figure out exactly how much of 
each class you want to include. That’s the focus of this section.
Establishing your asset mix means deciding on the specific allocation per-
centages to assign to every asset class and subclass in your portfolio. It’s 
difficult to overestimate the importance of this decision — it’s the essence 
of asset allocation. This decision will explain over 90 percent of your invest-
ment results. Although Chapter 4 discusses the concepts underlying the 
asset allocation process, this chapter delves more into the details of exactly 
how to put asset allocation into practice.
Go long! Finding percentages 
for the long haul
A key thing to keep in mind as you decide on your asset allocation is that you 
want these percentages to stand the test of time. This is a long-term, strate-
gic decision you’re making. These allocations are intended to last for several 
years.
 
Set your allocation percentages with the intent of keeping them intact for at 
least five years. Plan for less than five years only if your investment horizon 
(which we discuss in Chapter 6) is shorter.

154
Part II: Getting Started 
 
If, instead, you intend to change your allocations more frequently — quarterly, 
or monthly, or in response to market news — stop! You’re not striving to be 
an asset allocator — you’re aiming to become a speculator. If that’s the case, 
here’s our advice: Don’t do it! You need to make the decision to invest as most 
successful investors do — for the long term.
Now, it’s not as though your asset allocation is untouchable for the rest of 
your life. In fact, later in this chapter, we discuss reasons to periodically 
review it. But, when you set it up, it should be done with the conviction that 
it’ll remain intact for a good long time.
Picking the right percentages
How do you go about making the critical decision of determining your asset 
allocation percentages? Professional investors spend a lot of time, effort, and 
analytical firepower to get this right. As background for your own decision-
making, let’s look at how they go about it.
How the pros do it
Here’s how professional investors figure out asset allocation percentages.
 
1. They analyze the intrinsic characteristics of each of the asset classes 
and subclasses they’re considering.
 
 These characteristics include three important statistics:
 
• The expected total return (see Chapter 2)
 
• The volatility of those returns (see Chapter 2)
 
• The correlations of the returns with those of the other assets 
under consideration (see Chapter 4)
 
 They also review the recent trends in these three statistics. Based on 
that intensive data review, they select values for each of these statistics 
that they believe will prevail over the foreseeable future.
 
2. They plug the values into probability models.
 
 These models project how the various asset classes will behave over the 
anticipated investment horizon. (We explain how you determine your 
investment horizon in Chapter 6.) There is no one universal model that 
everyone uses, and some are more sophisticated than others.
 
3. Armed with the mathematical model, they estimate the risk/return 
behavior of entire portfolios.
 
 They use this capability to test the behavior of thousands and thou-
sands of different possible portfolios, each of which represents a differ-
ent set of asset allocation percentages applied to the asset classes and 
subclasses they’re considering. This procedure allows the experts to 

155
 Chapter 8: Creating Your Allocation Plan
determine the efficient frontier of portfolios that outshine all the rest. 
(Turn to Chapter 2 for more on the efficient frontier, a key concept.) 
These portfolios are better than all the rest because you can’t find other 
portfolios that have lower risk for the same level of return, or higher 
return for the same level of risk.
 
4. From the efficient frontier, the pros choose a small set of portfolios 
that conform to different levels of a person’s return objectives and 
risk tolerance.
 
 We define these two parameters and their role in portfolio construction 
in Chapter 6. In particular, we specifically discuss how to use your risk 
tolerance to select the portfolio that’s right for you, at the very end of 
Chapter 2 and again in Chapter 6.
 
The guiding principle of asset allocation (see Chapter 4) says that the charac-
teristics and behavior of any single asset in isolation are inconsequential. The 
thing that really matters is the asset’s effect on your portfolio in its entirety. 
The operative question should be: “Is my portfolio better, or worse, with this 
asset in it?”
How you can do it
The preceding section tells you how the pros pick the right percentages — 
they focus on the overall portfolio, and how each asset choice fits into the 
big picture. Now the question is, how can you?
We’re not saying that you should do everything the pros do. We’re just trying 
to be candid with you about the level of effort the pros put in to achieve 
optimal results. But can you get by with less-than-optimal results, and still do 
much better than most investors? Sure!
One way to do it yourself is to decide on a rough asset allocation, perhaps 
based on the samples we provide in the next section, and then to stick to it. 
How do you decide which is right for you? You could use the risk-tolerance 
worksheet we provide in Chapter 6. You could do the full exercise we outline 
in Chapter 7. Even if the allocation you decide on isn’t perfectly right, just 
the act of sticking to it — rebalancing ruthlessly, as described in Chapters 5 
and 11 — will put you ahead of most other investors. It may not be optimal, 
but it’s a lot better than investing with no plan at all.
Another way to set your asset-allocation percentages is to temporarily hire 
yourself your own pro (an expert asset allocator like a Certified Financial 
Analyst) for the job. Some financial advisors would be happy — for a fee, of 
course — to review your situation and suggest an asset allocation that suits 
your needs. Use the information in Chapter 16 to identify and qualify the 
appropriate professionals whose help you may seek. After you’ve selected 
an advisor, share your relevant background information with her so she can 
help you establish your allocation. After that, you may (or may not) keep for 
yourself the job of sticking to it.

156
Part II: Getting Started 
Regardless of whether you seek outside assistance, you may consider the 
sample asset allocations we discuss in the next section as a starting point, or 
at least a starting point for discussion.
 
Whichever approach you end up taking, make sure you consider your tax situ-
ation, honor any portfolio constraints you may have established, and reflect 
any special considerations you may have noted — all of which we discuss in 
Chapter 6.
Looking at Some Sample 
Allocation Percentages
As we stress throughout this book, the right asset allocation for you is spe-
cific to your unique situation. So why would we offer sample asset allocation 
percentages in this section, if they’re not going to be tailored to your specific 
needs?
Because finding the optimal set of allocation percentages takes significant 
time, effort, data, expertise, analysis, and expense that you may not have 
available (see the “How the pros do it” section for a description of all the 
effort the pros put in to get it right). If you don’t have loads of time and you 
aren’t comfortable running those complicated analyses on your own, then 
starting with a reasonable (albeit less than optimal and not perfectly custom-
ized) set of percentages is significantly better than shooting from the hip 
with your investments.
 
We offer the sample allocation percentages below in that spirit — they’re not a 
complete substitute for the thorough process the pros go through, but they’re 
a reasonably good place to start. If you decide to use one of these sample 
allocations, we strongly recommend that you confirm the asset allocation you 
decide upon with a qualified professional (see Chapter 16).
We present several sample sets of percentages in the following sections, 
reflecting a range of investment strategies, from aggressive to conservative. 
In each of these sets, you’ll notice that the asset classes stay the same — 
only the mix varies.
Aggressive: Higher equity percentage
Let’s assume that you’re an aggressive investor. You may
 
✓ Be young
 
✓ Have a promising career with solid earning potential

157
 Chapter 8: Creating Your Allocation Plan
 
✓ Be in excellent health, and longevity runs in your family
 
✓ Be living well within your means
 
✓ Have a high personal tolerance for risk
If many of those traits describe you, then you have a long investment hori-
zon, and your portfolio should have a healthy allocation of equities to reflect 
your ability and willingness to invest aggressively. And you recognize that, by 
investing aggressively over a long period, you have the potential to achieve 
much higher than average returns. This strategy may afford you the option 
of retiring early if you so desire down the road. A reasonable asset allocation 
for you would be one within the ranges outlined in Table 8-1.

As you can see in this table, the majority of your portfolio — anywhere from 
60 percent to 80 percent — goes to equities. Alternatives are next, with 15 
percent to 35 percent of the total. And the balance (a small percentage — as 
much as 15 percent, but as little as 0) is allocated to fixed-income assets.
Conservative: Higher fixed-income 
percentage
What if you’re a classic conservative investor? If so, you may
 
✓ Be well into your retirement years
 
✓ Have no pension or other sources of income beyond Social Security
 
✓ Be in failing health
 
✓ Need to rely on income from your investment portfolio to pay your 
ongoing living expenses
 
✓ Have no stomach for risk
If some of those characteristics describe you, then you have a relatively short 
investment horizon. Your emphasis is on capital preservation, and you’re 
comfortable sacrificing some return potential in order to lessen your risk of 
loss of principal. To conform to your desired conservatism, your portfolio

should be lighter in equities and heavier in fixed-income investments than the 
aggressive investor’s. Table 8-2 shows pertinent sample allocation ranges for 
you in this case.

In this sample, fixed income gets the largest allocation: 35 percent to 55 per-
cent of your portfolio. Next come equities, with 20 percent to 40 percent of 
the total. And the balance goes to alternatives. Note that the 15 percent to 35 
percent allocated to alternatives is the same allocation range in the aggres-
sive portfolio (see the preceding section). The real change when you move 
from aggressive to conservative is the shift from equities to fixed income.
Note that, even in conservative portfolios, equities deserve a substantial 
allocation. This is consistent with the point we make earlier, in the “Selecting 
Your Asset Classes” section: Equities belong in virtually every portfolio, 
regardless how conservative. That can’t be said of fixed-income investments. 
Why? Because, over the long term, it’s hard to beat equities in protecting 
your portfolio against inflation.
Moderate: Right in the middle
Perhaps you aren’t quite an aggressive investor, but you’re also not exactly 
conservative. You’re somewhere in between. You’d like a decent return, but 
you don’t want to take any above-average risks. You consider yourself a mod-
erate investor, and the allocation ranges shown in Table 8-3 would be appro-
priate for you.

 Chapter 8: Creating Your Allocation Plan
Here we allocate 40 percent to 60 percent of your portfolio to equities, and 
anywhere from 15 percent to 35 percent to both fixed income and alternatives.
What about Subclasses?
The sample allocations we present earlier in this chapter are at the asset 
class level. But you can’t stop there. You’ll also want to establish your asset 
allocation percentages at the subclass level.
Figuring out your fixed-income 
subclass allocation
Within the fixed-income class, consider laddering your investments. (Read 
more about laddering in Chapter 3.) Specifically, split your fixed-income 
allocation roughly equally among short-, intermediate-, and long-term bonds 
and/or bond funds. The only time you shouldn’t ladder in this fashion is if 
the yield curve (also covered in Chapter 3) is flat or inverted at the time you 
set up your portfolio. In this case, you’d be better off tilting your allocation 
toward the short maturities, at least until the yield curve reverts to its more 
normal, upward-sloping shape.
Controversial asset classes
In the three sample allocations we feature in the 
last few pages, the range of percentages attrib-
uted to the alternative asset class (comprising 
real estate and commodities) doesn’t vary. Even 
though these investments may be considered 
controversial by some and are, by definition, 
nontraditional, they aren’t simply for the more 
aggressive investors. Their role is to stabilize 
the portfolio (see Chapters 3 and 13). Given that 
role, they belong in virtually every portfolio. (The 
modeling that the wealth advisory firm Brinton 
Eaton did at the time of this writing indicated 
that the allocation percentages for the alter-
native asset class should be roughly the same 
across all investment strategies. Other firms 
may have different opinions.)
Having said that, we should add that alterna-
tives may not be for everyone. You may not be 
ready for them. As we point out in Chapter 13, 
you’re ready to add alternatives when:
 ✓ You determine you have the stomach to 
tolerate their unusual behavior.
 ✓ You know you’ll have the time to ride herd 
on them and pay attention.
If you are indeed ready for alternatives, though, 
they can be a real boon for your portfolio.

160
Part II: Getting Started 
Establishing your equity 
subclass allocation
Within the equity class, you’ll also want to pay attention to several sub-
classes. With respect to size, make sure you allocate some of your equity 
exposure to small- and mid-cap equities. The amount to allocate should be 
anywhere from about 10 percent (for conservative portfolios) to about 20 
percent (for aggressive portfolios) of your overall allocation to equities. For 
example, let’s say you’re a moderate investor and, consistent with Table 8-3, 
you allocate 50 percent of your portfolio to equities. Allocate 5 percent (0.50 
× 0.10 = 0.05, or 5 percent) to 10 percent (0.50 × 0.20 = 0.10, or 10 percent) of 
your overall portfolio to small- and mid-cap equities, and the balance of the 
50 percent to large-cap.
 
With respect to the industry sector within the large-cap equity subclass, you 
don’t need to be in all ten of the subclasses we identify in Chapter 3. In fact, 
in our opinion, at the time of this writing you should concentrate on only 
these five:
 
✓ Healthcare
 
✓ Consumer staples
 
✓ Financials
 
✓ Energy
 
✓ Industrials (to a lesser extent than the other four)
 
Others may arrive at different conclusions about which sectors to leave in, or 
leave out, at different times.
Why leave out the other sectors? Different reasons. For example, the technol-
ogy sector exhibits too much volatility for the return that that sector deliv-
ers, and, unlike the volatility you get with commodities, the volatility of the 
technology sector isn’t the good kind of volatility, because its trends will tend 
to stay in step with the majority of your portfolio. Technology makes your 
portfolio riskier with no real added return over the long term. For another 
example, you can omit the materials sector, because you get a purer play 
with your direct investment in commodities, as part of the alternative asset 
class. Utilities and communications can be omitted, because they don’t have 
impressive long-term returns. The consumer discretionary sector is cyclical, 
and may be attractive depending on where we are in the business cycle.

161
 Chapter 8: Creating Your Allocation Plan
As far as equity style goes, to the extent you pay attention to this at all (we 
believe style is less important than size and sector, because there’s noth-
ing fundamental about a stock that makes it “growth” or “value” — these 
are merely terms that describe how a stock is priced on any given day), you 
should have a mix of value and growth stocks (and/or stock funds), with a 
bigger allocation to value, if you must take sides. Or, you can simply ignore 
style and focus on stock funds whose style is identified as “blend” or “core.”
To wrap up the equity class, you should make sure you have a healthy dose 
of international exposure — particularly emerging markets — in your equity 
allocation. Shoot for anywhere from 15 percent or so (for conservative port-
folios) to 33 percent to 50 percent (for aggressive portfolios) of your overall 
allocation to equities. We discuss this in more detail in the next section.
Arming your portfolio with the appropriate 
alternative subclasses
Within the alternative class, you should sub-allocate to real estate and com-
modities. (Both of these subclasses are discussed at length in Chapter 13.) 
All but the most conservative investors should consider placing 25 percent to 
33 percent of their alternative allocation in real estate, with the rest going to 
commodities; for conservative portfolios, put a little less toward real estate.
As with equities, it would be prudent to have some international exposure in 
your real-estate allocation (although you may want to hold off on investing 
in that condo development in Antarctica). Consider putting anywhere from 
33 percent to 50 percent (less if you’re very conservative) of your real-estate 
allocation to international real estate.
When allocating to commodities, stick with the broad-basket index funds; 
don’t dabble in individual commodities.
How you fill these subclasses with actual securities depends on the size of 
your overall portfolio. (We explain these choices in Chapter 9.) For example, 
if your portfolio is small, the process can be very simple: Fill your portfolio 
entirely with index funds (mutual funds and/or exchange-traded funds, as 
discussed in Chapters 3 and 9). In fact, if your portfolio is small enough (less 
than $250,000, say) you may be better off not allocating down to the subclass 
level at all, at least for some subclasses, such as the equity sector subclass. 
For smaller portfolios, the extra time, attention, and cost involved in moni-
toring tiny subclass allocations and rebalancing when necessary (in tinier 
amounts still) may offset the potential added benefit.

An Asset Allocation Case Study
To give you a concrete idea of how you can put all these asset allocation tips 
to good use, we present the following look at how John and Jane Doe con-
struct their portfolio.
John and Jane have impeccable taste in top-notch books, so they pull Asset 
Allocation For Dummies from their shelves, read through Chapters 6 and 7, 
and determine their investment horizon, return objectives, risk tolerances, 
portfolio constraints, and special considerations. As a result, they decide 
that they’re moderate/aggressive investors. (They’re somewhere between 
moderate and aggressive.)
John and Jane put 15 percent of their portfolio in fixed-income investments, 
60 percent in equities, and 25 percent in alternatives. Then they follow the 
guidelines in the previous section and allocate to subclasses, as shown in 
Table 8-4.

 Chapter 8: Creating Your Allocation Plan
As you can see, the Does decide to fully ladder their fixed-income invest-
ments by spreading the 15 percent allocation in equal 5 percent allotments 
to short-, intermediate-, and long-term maturities. At the time they put their 
portfolio together, the yield curve slopes upward (normal), meaning that 
longer-term bonds have higher yields than shorter-term bonds.
Based on our guidelines, John and Jane decide to allocate 17 percent of their 
60 percent allocation to equities (10 percent of their portfolio) into small- and 
mid-cap equities. Specifically, they put 4 percent in small-cap and 6 percent 
in mid-cap. The balance of the equity allocation goes to large-cap, spread 
over five industry sectors: The largest portion, 15 percent of the portfolio, 
goes to the healthcare sector; the smallest, 5 percent, to industrials. They 
decide on specific industry sectors after talking with their financial advisor, 
who provides a detailed analysis of the general economy. Smart move, Does!
With respect to their 25 percent allocation to alternatives, the Does put about 
a third of that, or 8 percent, to real estate, and the remaining 17 percent to 
commodities.
When the Does make their allocation to equities and real estate, they make 
sure that they earmark roughly 25 percent of that subtotal (or 17 percent of 
their total portfolio) to international investments in those areas.
 
Keep in mind that the Does’ decisions are unique to them, not to you! Their 
choices may not be right for you, so don’t simply jump in with the asset alloca-
tion they chose. Jumping into somebody else’s allocation without doing your 
own homework is just plain irresponsible.
Setting Up a Schedule 
to Revisit Your Plan
Earlier in this chapter, we say that you want your asset allocation percent-
ages to stand the test of time, that you should pick them with the conviction 
that they’ll remain intact for the long haul. But how long is the long haul?
Certainly not for your lifetime. As you age, your investment horizon naturally 
shortens with your life expectancy. If you’re typical, you also move from the 
asset-accumulation phase to the asset-distribution phase of your lifecycle, 
meaning that instead of adding to your invested assets from other income 
sources, such as wages, you may be drawing down your investment accounts 
to pay for your living expenses that your retirement income doesn’t cover. 

164
Part II: Getting Started 
For these reasons, and others, many investors shift to a more conservative 
investment strategy over time, regardless of where they may start. This kind 
of change is very gradual.
So you do need to revisit your asset allocation, but when? Different occasions 
may trigger an accelerated review of your allocation (see Chapter 15). These 
include certain life events like a marriage or divorce, the loss of a loved one, 
a sudden change in health, or an unexpected child or grandchild. These are 
times that should cause you to step back and take a fresh look at the param-
eters you set when you established your current asset allocation. In Chapter 
6, we identify those parameters: your investment horizon, return objectives, 
risk tolerance, portfolio constraints, tax situation, and special considerations. 
A change in any one of them, for whatever reason, is cause for a review of 
your asset allocation.
There are other triggering events that are less personal but can still warrant 
revisiting your allocation. For example, we mention earlier in this chapter 
that if the yield curve is flat or inverted when you set up your portfolio then 
it isn’t a good idea to ladder your fixed-income investments so much; instead, 
tilt toward the short-term end of the maturity spectrum. Well, when the yield 
curve reverts to its normal shape, you should consider trading in some of 
your short-term bonds and bond funds for their intermediate- and long-term 
equivalents. (The reverse isn’t true, by the way. If you started out with a well-
laddered fixed-income portfolio, set up in a normal yield curve environment, 
you shouldn’t unwind it and go short term if the yield curve later flattens or 
inverts. You’re already where you want to be.)
Now, some of the triggering events we describe in this section may escape 
your notice. We’re not going to shame you if you don’t track the shape of the 
yield curve on a regular basis, for example. And some other events, such as 
the unanticipated arrival of a grandchild, may be so emotionally overwhelm-
ing and distracting that your asset allocation is far from the top of your prior-
ity list. Who can focus on bonds when there’s babysitting to do? Because of 
these reasons, it’s prudent to set a regular schedule to review your situation.
An annual review cycle is probably too often for most investors, but there’s 
nothing wrong with setting the same time each year to do a review, especially 
knowing that in most years you’ll do fine to leave well enough alone.
 
Make it easy to remember the date you set for an annual revisit of your asset 
allocation by tying it to something that’ll be an automatic reminder, like your 
birthday.

165
 Chapter 8: Creating Your Allocation Plan
For many investors, a quadrennial review (every four years) is plenty fre-
quent. Again, tie the date to something you’ll notice, like the presidential 
election, or the start of the Summer Olympic Games.
 
Whatever your schedule, remember that a review of your asset allocation is 
just that — a review. You shouldn’t feel compelled to change your allocation — 
which is, after all, intended to be long-term and strategic — every time you 
review it.

Chapter 9
Buying Securities
In This Chapter
▶ Deciding what securities to buy
▶ Knowing how to buy securities
▶ Understanding fees and expenses
T
his chapter focuses on helping you roll up your sleeves and start build-
ing your portfolio. The information we present here will get you ready 
to take the next step in asset allocation’s systematic, top-down approach to 
investing.
As we mention throughout this book, asset allocation is mostly about 
determining the right baskets of investments to have in your portfolio. In 
this chapter, we show you how to fill those baskets with specific individual 
investments. You want nitty gritty? Look no further.
We start by guiding you through the different investments on offer — the 
standard stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, along with real estate investment 
trusts (REITs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). We also cover annuities, 
options, structured notes, and exchange-traded notes (ETNs).
After describing what’s out there, we take a look at the best ways for you 
to buy the various investments. Should you buy directly (on your own) or 
through a broker? Is leveraging a good choice for you? How about shorting? 
You can find the answers to these questions and more in this chapter’s second 
section.
Finally, we examine the fees and expenses involved in buying securities. 
Some of the fees are clear, but some can be tough to dig out if you don’t know 
where to look.
How do you tell the good investment choices from the bad, or determine how 
much they really cost? If you have a small portfolio, should you even bother 
with individual securities? In this chapter, we give you the hands-on informa-
tion you need to address these and other questions, so that you can build a 
solid portfolio.

170
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
Deciding What to Buy
There are different ways to own investments. You can own specific individual 
securities, which include the traditional choices of stocks and bonds, and the 
alternative choice of invested real estate, which is available through REITs.
You can also own shares in a diversified fund, which, in turn, invests in the 
types of securities that interest you. Fund choices are quite varied, and in 
this section we cover all the prominent options in enough detail so that you’ll 
be able to make wise decisions about which funds are right for you and your 
portfolio.
Beyond individual securities and funds, there’s still a range of investment 
choices you may want to consider, depending on your risk tolerance and 
investing experience. For example, annuities are for risk-averse investors 
who might prefer the guarantee of a steady return and don’t mind the greater 
costs involved. More-exotic choices (options, structured notes) are for sea-
soned investors who are comfortable with more sophisticated products. We 
cover all those possibilities (and more!) later in this section.
Individual securities
Any discussion of individual securities starts with stocks and bonds. Stocks 
represent ownership in a company and come in two types: common and pre-
ferred. Bonds represent a loan you make to a company, municipality, or gov-
ernment agency. In addition to stocks and bonds, we also discuss real estate 
(through REITs) in this section.
Stocks
Stocks, or equities, which we introduce in Chapter 3, are the foundation of 
most portfolios because, over long periods of time, they tend to outperform 
most other types of investments. Broad stock-market indexes have, on aver-
age over many years, posted an annual total return of around 10 percent 
to 12 percent (depending on which years you average over).
Few investors understand equities as well as they should. For example, when 
the dot-com bubble was growing larger and larger in the late 1990s, many 
investors came to believe that stocks could pave the way to instant wealth, 
with little risk. Unfortunately, they found out otherwise when the bubble 
burst and took many portfolios with it. It just goes to show that potentially 
higher returns come with potentially higher risk. Stocks can be risky, but 
their potential for appealing returns justifies that risk.

171
 Chapter 9: Buying Securities
You hear about stocks everyday, but what exactly is a stock? Plain and 
simple, a stock is ownership in a company. When a public company needs 
to raise capital to finance operations, it sells stock or shares (also known 
as equity) in the company to investors, who then become stockholders (or 
shareholders). As part owner of the company, you are entitled to a propor-
tionate share of assets and earnings (no matter how small your share is).
Before buying, make sure you understand the differences between common 
and preferred stock, which are the two main types available:
 
✓ Common stock: When you buy common stock, your shares entitle you 
to a claim on assets and earnings. Earnings are paid out as dividends 
and can increase, which is a good thing. But you can also lose every-
thing you invested — ouch! Ownership entitles you to vote at annual 
shareholder meetings, but that doesn’t mean you have a say in how the 
company is run on a day-to-day basis. If the company goes bankrupt, 
you wait in line (figuratively speaking), after banks, bondholders, pre-
ferred stockholders, and all other creditors, are paid. You’d think all 
that standing in line would hurt your feet, but in this case it hurts your 
wallet. Double ouch.
 
✓ Preferred stock: When you buy preferred stock, you earn a fixed divi-
dend and are paid ahead of common shareholders if the company goes 
out of business. And you usually don’t have voting rights. For these 
reasons, preferred stocks behave more like bonds and less like common 
stocks, and they have lower expected returns than common stocks as a 
consequence.
With both common and preferred stock, your exposure to loss is confined to 
your investment in the stock; your other personal assets aren’t at stake.
 
When you hear about stocks, including in this book, you’re most likely hearing 
about common stocks.
So how do you pick a good stock? The answer to that question can fill several 
large books. We recommend Investing For Dummies, 5th Edition, by Eric Tyson, 
MBA (Wiley). But here’s some quick advice: If you’re considering buying shares 
of a company’s stock, study the company’s financial statements. You want to 
look for the following:
 
✓ A healthy income statement, with steadily increasing revenue and earnings
 
✓ A clean balance sheet with the ratio of the company’s debt to its equity 
at or below the average for that company’s industry
 
✓ A price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (the share price divided by the company’s 
latest, or projected, annual earnings) that is low relative to other firms 
in the same industry

172
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
If you don’t have information like industry average debt-to-equity ratios or 
P/E ratios handy, ask your broker or financial advisor for them. (If you don’t 
have a broker or advisor, see Chapter 16 for info on how to find a good one.)
You can check on a company’s financial health by looking at the 10-K report, 
which is available from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Web 
site at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml. This address takes you to EDGAR (the 
Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System), which offers more 
information, including balance sheets and income statements.
 
Holding individual stocks exposes you to considerable risk. Companies can, 
and do, go out of business; if they do, you lose your entire investment in them. 
So, it’s not a good idea to have more than 5 percent of your portfolio in any 
one stock. For most small investors (those with portfolios of $250,000 or less), 
getting equity exposure through stock funds (discussed later in this chapter) 
is better.
Bonds
A bond is a loan to an issuer, which can be a government, municipality, or 
corporation. In return for lending the issuer your money, you periodically 
receive a fixed interest payment, with the promise that you’ll get all your 
principal paid back by a certain date, known as a maturity date. Governments, 
municipalities, and corporations issue bonds when they need to raise capital.
Bonds are less volatile than stocks (meaning, they tend to hold their value 
more reliably), but their returns are lower over the long term. Bonds should 
be part of most portfolios for stability, as we explain in Chapter 3.
 
When you buy a callable bond, the issuer can ask for the bond back and pay 
you back early. You may lose interest and get stuck with a lower interest rate 
on a replacement bond.
Bonds can sound rock solid, but don’t be fooled: Bonds aren’t guaranteed. 
Some issuers will default (fail to pay you back all the interest — or even the 
principal that you lent them). Also, bond returns are generally lower than 
other asset classes.
Here’s an overview of the risk involved in various types of bonds, from 
lowest to highest risk:
 
✓ U.S. government bonds, also called Treasuries, are the safest of bonds, 
because, by law, they must be paid ahead of the federal government’s 
other obligations. Their income is free of state and local income taxes 
(but not federal income tax). Maturities range from T-bills (under 1 year) 
to notes (2 to 10 years), and bonds (10 to 30 years).

173
 Chapter 9: Buying Securities
 
✓ Municipal (or muni) bonds are issued by states, cities, and towns, and 
when you buy them, your money goes to work for public projects, like 
the building of a road or a school. Munis are triple tax protected — free 
of local, state, and federal taxes — which makes them ideal for investors 
in high tax brackets. As a result, they generally have yields less than 
those on taxable bonds of similar risk. Default risk is lowest for general 
obligation (GO) bonds (backed by the state or municipality) and greater 
for revenue bonds (backed by the agency, commission, or authority cre-
ated by law that builds a public project).
 
✓ Corporate bonds are generally the most lucrative of bonds — but also 
the riskiest. You’ve got only the issuer’s (in this case, a company’s) 
promise that they’ll pay you back. Terms range from 1 year to 15 or 
more years. Corporate bonds usually offer higher yields than municipal 
bonds, but interest payments are taxable at all levels. Some corporate 
bonds feature a convertible feature (meaning that the bond can be con-
verted into shares of common stock) or a call provision (the issuer can 
pay you back before the bond reaches maturity).
 
Use zero-coupon bonds if you’re saving to achieve a long-term goal, such as 
college tuition, and you don’t need a regular payout. These bonds, which are 
issued at a fraction of par value (face value), don’t pay regular interest, but 
they increase regularly in value as the bond approaches maturity.
 
As with individual stocks, individual bonds expose you to risk that you can 
diversify away with bond funds (which we cover later in this chapter). Bond 
funds are also a better alternative than individual bonds for investors with 
less than $500,000 to invest, because you don’t want to hold individual bonds 
of small amounts — they’ll be harder to sell if you want to.

Real estate investment trusts
REITs are companies that buy, own, and manage real estate properties on 
behalf of their investors. Most REITs invest in commercial properties such 
as apartment complexes, office buildings, warehouses, storage facilities, and 
retail malls. The other type of REITs are mortgage REITs, which offer debt 
financing for commercial as well as residential properties through invest-
ments in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities (MBSs). MBSs invest in 
an underlying pool of mortgages that are packaged and paid out as income 
to investors. If you decide to invest in real estate, we urge you to invest in a 
REIT that is tied to property — mortgage-backed securities are just too risky 
to consider (see Chapter 3).

174
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
Many investors find REITs very attractive. First, REITs distribute at least 90 
percent of their taxable income annually to shareholders in the form of divi-
dends. Second, over the long term, REITs have delivered equity-like (appeal-
ing) returns of over 10 percent per year.
On the downside, year-to-year returns for REITs can be quite volatile. If 
you’d like to see more information on returns for REITs, flip to Chapter 17 to 
see the return history of an all-REIT index, the FTSE NAREIT All REIT Index. 
Adding REITs to a well-diversified portfolio can increase return and reduce 
risk, because these assets have little correlation with the S&P 500. (Read all 
about correlation, a critical concept, in Chapters 3 and 4.)
For more information on investing in REITs, check out the Web site of the 
industry’s trade association at www.nareit.com. Then search for a compa-
ny’s 10-K report in the EDGAR database on the SEC’s Web site, as we explain 
in the “Stocks” section, earlier in this chapter.
Funds
Funds are privately or publicly owned investment companies that pool 
together money from many investors to buy financial securities. There are 
three basic types of funds:
 
✓ Closed-end funds: A closed-end fund sells a fixed number of shares at 
one time through an initial public offering (IPO),which occurs when a pri-
vate company puts up its stock for purchase by the public for the first 
time.
 
✓ Open-end funds: An open-end fund sells shares on a continuous basis. 
Mutual funds are the most conventional type of open-end fund.
 
✓ Unit investment trusts (UITs): UITs create a specific, fixed number 
of securities, known as units, in a one-time public offering, which are 
redeemable at a set date in the future. UITs are unmanaged in that, after 
the securities are selected, they’re held until the UIT ends.
Among these types, we focus here on open-end mutual funds because they’re 
by far the most popular type.
A relatively new alternative to the mutual fund that has become very popular 
is the ETF. In this section, we describe ETFs and mutual funds. We also dis-
cuss passively managed index funds and actively managed funds (and a third 
type, the target or life-cycle fund, that doesn’t fit neatly into either category). 
These choices are best understood as falling in two dimensions, as we show 
in Figure 9-1.

As the figure illustrates, a mutual fund can be either a passively managed 
index fund or an actively managed fund. Likewise for ETFs, although the 
actively managed variety is newer. To help you understand all this, we 
explain the details of mutual funds and ETFs, and then fill you in on the differ-
ence between an index fund and an actively managed fund.
Mutual funds versus exchange-traded funds
Mutual funds and ETFs have a few things in common, but there are also a 
number of key differences you need to be aware of.
Note: Mutual funds can be either passively managed index funds or actively 
managed funds — and so can ETFs.
Mutual funds
Mutual funds are the most common type of pooled investment. Funds “slice 
and dice” many types of investments — stocks, bonds, money-market instru-
ments, and other securities — to offer diversified portfolios that would be dif-
ficult for investors to create with a small amount of capital on their own.
Here are some advantages of owning mutual funds:
 
✓ Scalability: Mutual funds allow investors to buy fractional shares. That 
means that you can invest all your money, even if the amount is small. 
For example, say a share is worth $30 and you’re making a monthly 
investment of $115. With some other types of investments, you’d only be 
able to buy three shares for $90, and $25 would remain uninvested. With 
a mutual fund, the full $115 would be invested every month.
 
✓ Affordability: With some funds, you may only need as little as $50 or 
$100 to make an initial purchase.
 
✓ Diversification: By having the securities within the fund spread across a 
wide range of companies and industry sectors, you can lower your risk.

176
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
 
✓ Liquidity: You can redeem your shares at their current net asset value 
(NAV; the total market value of all the underlying securities in the fund 
divided by the number of fund shares outstanding), less any fees and 
charges, on any given day.
 
✓ Professional management: Professional managers do all the work, from 
researching individual companies to monitoring the performance of the 
securities the funds purchase.
 
✓ Free income and dividend reinvestment: When a stock pays a dividend 
or a bond pays income, you can either take it in cash or reinvest it. A 
mutual fund gives you the option to have all your dividends and income 
automatically reinvested at no extra charge. This is a significant benefit 
because, over the long term, these reinvested dividends and income 
payments make up a large portion of your total return.
And here are some disadvantages of owning mutual funds:
 
✓ Expenses: You’ll pay sales charges, annual fees, and other expenses, 
even if your investment does poorly. (We cover expenses in the 
“Understanding Fees and Expenses” section, later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Taxes: Mutual funds typically generate capital-gains distributions that 
are taxable to you. You have no control over the amount or timing of 
these distributions.
 
✓ Pricing: You can’t check a fund’s price (its NAV) throughout the trading 
day as you can with a security. Mutual funds calculate their NAV once 
every business day, after the exchanges close.
There are various categories of mutual funds, corresponding to the various 
asset classes we describe in Chapter 3. For example, there are money-market 
mutual funds (representing cash equivalents), bond funds (representing 
fixed income), stock funds (representing equity), and real estate and com-
modity funds (representing the alternative asset class). (See Chapters 3 and 
8 for more information on the risk and return characteristics of the various 
asset classes.) Because mutual funds correspond to those asset classes, the 
risk and return characteristics are the same as for the asset classes they 
represent. There are also mutual funds that invest in several asset classes at 
once. They can range from a conservative allocation (for example 80 percent 
bonds, 20 percent stocks) to an aggressive allocation (such as 20 percent 
bonds, 80 percent stocks).
 
When deciding among mutual funds, don’t simply rely on each fund’s histori-
cal performance. Focus more on such items as expenses and tracking error, 
which we discuss later in this chapter. As all investment prospectuses state, 
“Past performance is no guarantee of future results.” However, past perfor-
mance can help you get a handle on a fund’s relative volatility over time. A 
fund with a lot of volatility may, for example, make it a bad choice for you if 
you really need your money to meet a short-term goal.

177
 Chapter 9: Buying Securities
 
Mutual funds carry a number of costs that can lower your investment returns. 
We detail fees and expenses in the “Understanding Fees and Expenses” section, 
later in this chapter.
Exchange-traded funds
Exchange-traded funds are funds (typically modified UITs, which we describe 
earlier in this section) registered with the SEC. Each ETF represents a basket 
of underlying securities, like a mutual fund. But unlike a mutual fund, ETF 
shares can be bought or sold on a stock exchange throughout the trading 
day. This hybrid investment has become very popular with investors since 
it was introduced in the United States in 1993. The total ETF market is still 
smaller than the mutual-fund market, but at their pace of growth, ETFs may 
eventually overtake mutual funds in market share.
Their numbers continue to grow as originators (such as Barclays Bank and 
State Street Bank) create ETFs (with brand names such as iShares and SPDRs, 
respectively) that mimic the behavior of a wider and wider range of equity 
and bond indexes, including industry-sector indexes. In general, ETFs are pas-
sively managed index funds or passively managed sector funds; that is, they’re 
usually designed to replicate the holdings, and the performance and yield, 
of specific underlying indexes, such as the S&P 500 Stock Index, the Russell 
2000 Index (an index of small-cap stocks), the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond 
Index, and so on. Recently, actively managed, non-index-based ETFs have 
become available. (Read on for more information on the differences between 
index funds and actively managed funds.)
What benefits do ETFs offer that mutual funds don’t? Consider the following:
 
✓ Intraday marketability: ETF shares, because they’re actively traded on 
stock exchanges throughout the day, are quite marketable. Conventional 
mutual-fund shares are bought and sold only at end-of-day prices based 
on a share’s NAV. ETF shares are bought and sold at intraday market 
prices, which means that they can trade at greater or less than their 
NAV at any point during the trading day, but these discrepancies are 
very small for the more popular ETFs.
 
✓ Tax efficiency: Conventional mutual funds must distribute the capital 
gains from their underlying portfolio of securities directly to fund share-
holders, who are tax liable in the year of distribution. The legal design 
of ETFs allows certain capital gains on the underlying securities to not 
be distributed to investors at all, but instead serve to increase the share 
price of the ETF itself. Investors realize such capital gains only when 
they sell their ETF shares and, thus, can beneficially time the tax impact 
or defer it indefinitely.
 
✓ Trading flexibility: ETF shares can be bought on margin and sold short. 
These features, which we discuss in the “Buying on margin or shorting a 
stock: Not for the faint of heart” sidebar, in this chapter, are attractive to 

178
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
professional investors and sophisticated traders. We don’t recommend 
that inexperienced investors toy with these features, but they do con-
tribute to making ETFs so popular.
 
✓ Low costs: The fees and expenses embedded in ETFs are generally lower 
than in corresponding mutual funds. You can read all about these types 
of costs later in this chapter.
We’re big fans of ETFs, and we believe that their popularity is well deserved. 
Their variety is broad enough that, if you wanted, you could construct a 
well-diversified portfolio across a wide range of asset classes using nothing 
but ETFs.
Although ETFs have evolved to cover more and more specific areas of the 
market, there are still some markets that are very expensive to invest in 
directly and match a specific index. A relatively new investment vehicle 
designed to address this difficulty is the exchange-traded note (ETN), a struc-
tured note where the issuer promises investors that they’ll get the return 
on a specific index, less expenses. (ETNs and structured notes are both dis-
cussed in the “Other investments” section, later in this chapter.)
Buying on margin or shorting a stock: 
Not for the faint of heart
To enhance returns, some professionals use 
two investing techniques — leveraging and 
shorting. Both of these approaches are for sea-
soned investors, and they come with significant 
risk (as you’ll pick up from our four uses of the 
word warning in bold). Here’s the lowdown:
Some investors try to increase their returns by 
using leverage. Using leverage means buying 
securities using borrowed money from your 
broker. This is also called buying on margin.
If you buy a stock on margin, and it goes up in 
value, you can amplify your return. For example, 
if you buy a stock at $30 and it goes to $36, you 
get a return of 20 percent. But if, instead, you 
bought the stock on margin, putting up $10 and 
borrowing the remaining $20 from your broker, 
and the stock goes to $36, your return is much 
higher. Why? Let’s say you sell the stock when 
it hits $36, pay off the $20 loan, and pocket the 
$16 difference. That $16 represents a 60 percent 
return on your original $10 investment. You’ve 
“leveraged up” your return threefold.
Buying on margin works great in a bull market, 
when stock prices are rising — you can haul 
in a lot of money. But it can be devastating in 
a bear market, when stock prices are falling, 
because you stand to lose your shirt. If the 
stock goes down enough, the broker issues a 
margin call, meaning that you have to put up 
more money. In that case, you’ll have to put up 
cash or sell some of the stock. If the stock price 
goes down far enough fast enough, this can end 
up in a very expensive spiral for you.
Warning: If you’re going to use leverage, be 
sure that you fully understand your broker’s 
margin rate and how the broker calculates its 

179
 Chapter 9: Buying Securities
Index funds versus actively managed funds
In this section, we tackle passively managed index funds versus actively 
managed funds.
Note: Index funds can be either mutual funds or ETFs — and so can actively 
managed funds.
Index funds
An index fund is a fund that follows a passive investing strategy, meaning that 
the fund managers attempt to match an identified benchmark index, not out-
perform it. (If benchmark indexes don’t sound familiar, turn to Chapter 12 for 
more information.)
margin calls. You want to be very careful and 
fully understand margin before you try this 
technique. Make sure to consider what your 
maximum loss may be.
Using leverage in a bear market can force you to 
continuously sell stock into a declining market. 
There are examples of company executives 
who had a substantial portion of their personal 
wealth invested in company stock on margin. In 
an extended declining market, as stock prices 
fell precipitously, they were forced to sell most 
of their stock to cover the margin calls! Bottom 
line: Understand the risks of margin before pro-
ceeding.
Warning: Leveraging is for the seasoned inves-
tor, who has the credit to qualify for a margin 
account plus enough cash in his brokerage 
account to cover a potential loss.
Shorting is the practice of selling a stock you 
don’t own. You might be thinking, “Huh?” Don’t 
worry, you’re not alone. Shorting can be a con-
fusing concept.
The way it works is that you borrow the stock 
from your broker (for a small fee) and sell it to 
someone else. You do this if you expect the 
share price to go down. If and when it does, 
you then buy the stock on the open market for 
the lower price, and give the stock back to your 
broker. You’ve made a tidy profit, and you never 
technically owned the stock.
Here’s an example: Suppose a stock is cur-
rently trading at $50. You borrow a share from 
your broker, and sell it to someone for $50. If the 
stock later trades at $40, you buy it at that price 
and give it to your broker, settling the loan. Your 
profit is $10.
Warning: This strategy allows investors to make 
money in a declining (bear) market. But you must 
really understand the risks of shorting. If instead 
of going down, the share price goes up, you can 
lose big — very big. If you buy a share of stock 
at $10 the old-fashioned way, you know that your 
maximum loss is $10 (if the stock goes to zero). 
However, if you short-sell a stock at $10 you 
have a potential unlimited loss! There’s no limit 
as to how high a stock can go, so your potential 
loss can be much, much more than $10.
To qualify for shorting, you must be approved 
by your broker and meet minimum collateral 
requirements, usually $2,000 or 50 percent of 
the shorted stock’s market value.
Warning: Like leveraging, shorting isn’t for the 
squeamish or the uninitiated. If you’re think-
ing about shorting, make sure you’re extremely 
familiar with the ins and outs, and be certain you 
understand the consequences and implications.

180
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
To get an index fund to work most effectively for you, you want to look for 
two things: a low expense ratio and a low tracking error.
 
✓ The expense ratio of a fund tells you how big a bite the fund’s man-
agement fees and other ongoing expenses take out of your return. If 
the expense ratio is 1 percent, for example, and the annual return of 
its underlying holdings is 8 percent, you get to enjoy only a 7 percent 
return from the fund. Because an index fund tries only to passively 
match an index, not beat it, it doesn’t need to hire an expensive portfolio 
manager to run the fund, so its expense ratio should be low.
 
 For funds that track broad indexes like the S&P 500 Stock Index, look for 
expense ratios of no more than 0.25 percent. For funds that track nar-
rower indexes, such as the Dow Jones U.S. Health Care Index, seek out 
expense ratios of 0.5 percent or less.
 
✓ The tracking error of a fund measures how well the fund’s return 
matches that of the index it claims to follow. A low tracking error means 
that the fund tracks its index relatively well. That’s what you want from 
an index fund, after all — you want it to faithfully follow the index it’s 
supposed to follow. You don’t want it to stray off its path.
Where do you find information on a fund’s expense ratio and tracking error? 
In the fund’s prospectus and on its Web site. The expense ratio is usually 
shown explicitly, but the tracking error isn’t always as easy to find. Some 
funds instead show the correlation of the fund with its index (see Chapter 4 
for more on correlation). They may also show a comparison of the annual-
ized returns of the fund as well as its index. Over time, you can expect the 
annualized return of the fund to gradually diverge from its index due to fees. 
If correlation is high (over 95 percent) and the annualized returns are close 
to each other, then the fund’s tracking error is low.
Finding the right index fund for your portfolio is a two-step process:
 
1. Decide what index you want to have represented in your portfolio.
 
 For information on those decisions, which are the basis of your asset 
allocation plan, check out Chapters 4 and 8. For example, do you want 
an index that follows domestic large-cap stocks? Then you want the S&P 
500 Stock Index.
 
2. Find an investment that inexpensively and faithfully tracks the index 
you have in mind.
 
 Here you need to do some scouting around. Lots of companies offer 
index funds, but you’ll do well to start with Vanguard (www.vanguard.
com), Fidelity (www.fidelity.com), and T. Rowe Price (www.trowe
price.com) for mutual funds, and Barclays iShares (www.ishares.
com), State Street’s SPDRs (www.statestreetspdrs.com), and 
Vanguard (again) for ETFs. There are several others as well.

181
 Chapter 9: Buying Securities
Actively managed funds
In most actively managed funds, the fund manager makes specific invest-
ments with the goal of outperforming a benchmark index. Managers do this 
by trying to identify investments that they believe will do better than the 
index. That’s their objective anyway.
The truth is, most of them aren’t very good at this on a sustained basis; 
actively managed funds rarely outperform their benchmark index over long 
periods of time. According to the Standard & Poor’s Index Versus Active 
(SPIVA) quarterly scorecards, which rates index funds against actively man-
aged funds, only a handful of actively managed mutual funds beat S&P’s 
various index benchmarks. In fact, when all expenses are taken into account, 
they rather consistently underperform! A big reason is that actively managed 
funds are usually considerably more expensive than index funds; the expense 
ratio for an actively managed funds can be a full percentage point or more 
than its corresponding index fund. That’s a tough difference to make up, even 
if the active manager was incredibly lucky, or good, over an extended period 
of time. The longer the period, the less likely this will happen, of course.
So why bother at all with actively managed funds? Well, for the most part, 
you shouldn’t. But consider the type of fund we describe in the next section, 
which is something of a hybrid between an active and a passive fund.
Target and life-cycle funds
These funds fall into a third category of fund — they don’t fit neatly into the 
active or passive categories. They’re like a one-stop shop for investors. You 
choose one of these funds based on your retirement year or your current 
age. They determine your current asset allocation and then automatically 
adjust the allocation to be more conservative as you age. Often, these funds 
invest in other funds, which may be either passive or active.
Most fund companies offer target and life-cycle funds. They’re particularly 
popular in 401(k) plans because they simplify your choices by automat-
ing your asset allocation according to when you want to retire — useful for 
investors who don’t want to do their own asset allocation, rebalancing, and 
security selection. For those investors, these are the only types of actively 
managed funds that we recommend.
Other investments
In this section, we look at a few other investment choices, starting with annu-
ities, which may be good choices for risk-averse investors who don’t mind 
the extra expense for the peace of mind these investments buy. But if you’re 
looking for a pure investment, think twice. Annuities are really an insurance 
product.

182
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
On the opposite end of the scale, we also look at options, which can work 
well as a risk-management tool for the expert investor.
Then there are structured notes. These deliver a guaranteed rate of return, 
like a bond, and match a predetermined index, but they’re really for wealthy 
investors who have the money (several million dollars) to purchase them.
For the masses, there are ETNs, which are sliced and diced structured notes 
and, thus, much more affordable.
Annuities
Annuities are products, usually offered by insurance companies, that provide 
payments to you for a guaranteed period in return for a premium that you 
pay the annuity provider. The payments to you can be for a fixed amount 
(in the case of a fixed annuity) or for an amount that varies according to an 
underlying investment (in the case of a variable annuity). The guaranteed 
payment period can be for a specified number of years (annuity certain) or 
for the rest of your life (life annuity). Those payments can begin immediately 
after you purchase the annuity (immediate annuity), or the first payment can 
be deferred for a specified period of time (deferred annuity). And that’s just 
the tip of the iceberg — there are many other varieties of annuities.
If you’re considering an annuity as an investment, you need to be aware of a 
few things:
 
✓ Terminal value: In general, after you pay your premium, you don’t get 
it back at the end of the term as you do with the par value of a bond, for 
example. Whether the term is fixed (as in an annuity certain) or for the 
rest of your life (as in a life annuity), when the term ends, so do the pay-
ments you (or your heirs) receive. There are variations on this (such as 
survivorship options), but one fundamental difference between annui-
ties and regular investments is that annuities are designed to eventually 
exhaust your original investment; regular investments are not (or at 
least they’re not designed to!).
 
✓ Expenses: The expenses embedded in an annuity are usually quite a bit 
higher than what you find in investments such as mutual funds and ETFs.
 
✓ Taxes: Income and capital gains aren’t taxed to you as they occur. When 
you start receiving payments from your annuity, only part of the pay-
ment is considered taxable in the year you receive it. (The rest is con-
sidered return of your principal.) This is a nice tax-deferral feature that 
annuities provide and regular investments don’t.
Some investors feel that the tax-deferral benefit offsets the higher expenses. 
This potential offsetting benefit disappears, though, if you buy an annuity 
inside your IRA or other tax-advantaged account, because you get the tax 
deferral anyway with those accounts.

183
 Chapter 9: Buying Securities
 
Think twice about buying an annuity inside an IRA. You may be paying for a 
tax benefit that you can’t use.
 
Make sure you truly understand all the costs involved in an annuity, how long 
you’re locked in for, and what the guarantees (if any) really mean. Annuities’ 
many bells and whistles generally make them more expensive than traditional 
investments.
 
On balance, our advice regarding annuities is this: If you’re looking for an 
investment, buy an investment. An annuity is really an insurance product, and 
as investments go, it’s an expensive choice.
That said, fixed annuities can be a good choice for investors who have a very 
low tolerance for risk and need a steady stream of guaranteed income. The 
exercise we go through in Chapter 7 can help you identify whether such an 
annuity would be a good choice for you.
Options
An option is a type of derivative — its value is derived from an underlying 
asset, such as a stock. The party that buys the option is called the option 
holder; the party that sells the option is called the option writer. An investor 
can be either a holder or a writer.
Options come in two types: calls and puts. A call option gives its holder the 
right, but not the obligation, to buy a certain security at an agreed-upon price 
(the strike price) for a specified period of time (the term). The strike price and 
the term are determined when the option is purchased. A put option gives its 
holder the right to sell a security at the strike price for a certain term. Just as 
with call options, the strike price and term for a put option are determined 
when the option is purchased.
A call option increases in value as the market price of the underlying security 
increases beyond the strike price of the option. So, if you own a call option 
on a stock with a strike price of $45 and the market price on that stock 
jumps to $90, that means you have the option to buy the stock for $45 when 
it is currently trading for $90 (sweet!). You’re looking at a pretty substantial 
increase in value. The difference between the security’s current market price 
and the option’s strike price is called the in-the-money value (ITM value) of 
the option. For example, if the market price of stock XYZ is $50, and the strike 
price of the call option is $45, the ITM value of the option is $5 ($50 – $45). If 
the current market price is lower than the strike price, the ITM value of the 
call option is zero.
For a put option, the ITM value is positive if the security’s current market 
price is below the strike price; it’s zero otherwise. For example, if the strike 
price of the put was $45 and the stock price has plunged to $25, then you 
have the option of selling a stock for $45 that is currently worth $25. Your 
ITM value is $20 ($45 – $25).

184
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
 
Whether you’re talking about a call option or a put option, there’s no such 
thing as a negative ITM value. That’s because an option is just that — an 
option, not an obligation, to buy or sell.
Sometimes options are used as risk-management tools. For example, if an 
investor is overly concentrated in a certain stock that she can’t easily sell for 
some time (maybe it’s her company’s stock and she’s prohibited from trad-
ing it for a time, given her position with the company), then she can buy a 
put to protect her downside risk.
How does that work? Let’s say the company stock is currently worth $80 a 
share and our investor is concerned about her loss if the stock goes below 
$75 before she can sell it. She can buy a put option with a strike price of $75. 
If the stock price goes down, to $70, say, then her put option will still allow 
her to realize, in effect, $75 per share, which would be quite a relief. Why? In 
that case, the put option would be worth $5 (its ITM value), partially offset-
ting her $10 loss on the stock itself, and thereby limiting her net loss to $5. 
If, instead, it goes down to $60, then the put is worth $15, partially offsetting 
her $20 loss on the stock, limiting her net loss to, again, $5. No matter what 
happens to the price of the stock during the term of the option, her net loss 
is limited to $5 per share.
 
If you have a position in a security that you’d like to protect in this manner, and 
you’re not familiar with trading options, then by all means hire a professional 
to help you. (See Chapter 16 for advice on finding a suitable professional.)
 
Other times, though, options are used as purely speculative investments. For 
example, an investor can buy or sell call or put options on securities she 
doesn’t own. This practice is called holding or writing naked options. But the 
naked truth is that this practice is extremely dangerous. Leave options to the 
expert investors.
Structured notes
A structured note, in its most popular form, is essentially a bond that’s struc-
tured so that it gives the holder (buyer) of the note a return that matches some 
predetermined index but may limit losses if the index declines. The index may 
be the S&P 500 Stock Index. In that case, the return on the bond follows a pat-
tern that matches the return on the S&P 500 Stock Index, but it provides some 
minimum guaranteed return. In another variation, the note could provide the 
holder a return that’s two or three times the return on the index. Or it could 
provide the “inverse” return — it goes up when the S&P 500 Stock Index goes 
down, and vice versa. Or, it could provide a return tied to the five best per-
forming currencies out of a basket of ten world currencies. There’s virtually 
no end to the possibilities — they’re limited only by the imagination of the 
issuer and the holder.

185
 Chapter 9: Buying Securities
Structured-note issuers will only be interested in buyers with the resources 
to purchase several million dollars’ worth of notes, so they’re out of reach 
for most investors. But there’s a way for most any investor to participate — 
through exchange-traded notes, which we explain next.
Exchange-traded notes
An ETN is basically a structured note for the masses. Essentially, a master 
structured note is sliced, diced, and parceled out to smaller investors. As a 
smaller investor, what you lose in control over design of the note you gain in 
access to the product. In other words, you may not get a whole heck of a lot 
of say in how the note is set up, but at least you can get a piece of it for less 
than a million dollars.
Some popular structured notes are designed to track indexes such as broad 
baskets of commodities. You can think of ETNs as an alternative to ETFs. 
One advantage of an ETN over an ETF is that the ETN has no tracking error: 
The issuer promises that the ETN will exactly follow its target index (less the 
ETN’s expense ratio). It’s the issuer’s responsibility to make that happen, and 
if it doesn’t, it’s the issuer’s problem. A disadvantage of ETNs is that you’re 
subject to the creditworthiness of the issuer to make good on the promise. 
Also, ETNs are generally more expensive (by 0.25 percent or so) than ETFs 
that track the same index.
Figuring Out How to Buy Securities
When you’ve got a firm grasp on the various securities available to you, you 
need to figure out the best way for you to go about buying those securities. 
Should you go through a broker or go it alone? We help you answer that key 
question in this section.
Buying through a broker
To buy most securities you need a broker, who acts as a middleman and han-
dles the transaction for you. There are three different types of brokers:
 
✓ Full-service brokers: A full-service broker is a firm like Goldman Sachs 
or Smith Barney. They’ll give you advice on what stocks to buy based 
on their own internal research. For this, you’ll pay a higher commission. 
Firms like these will also help you with your financial planning, again all 
for a higher fee than the discount brokers charge. If you’re looking for 
a one-on-one relationship and more specific advice on what to buy and 
sell, a full-service firm may be right for you.

186
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
 
✓ Premium discount brokers: A premium discount broker could be a firm 
like Fidelity or Charles Schwab. The commission rates are somewhere 
between the discount brokers and the full-service brokers. They have 
branch offices where you can go to get investment guidance, and they 
make investment research from third parties available to their customers.
 
✓ Discount brokers: A discount broker (E*TRADE is one example) allows 
you to make all your own investment decisions. These brokers have the 
lowest commission rates of the three broker types, but they may not 
offer you investment advice.
 
Currently, brokers aren’t required to put your interests ahead of their own. It’s 
perfectly legal for them to advise you to buy stocks for the sole purpose of 
making money for themselves. The stock can’t be terribly inappropriate for 
you, but it may also not be the best choice. Before accepting investment or 
any other financial advice, make sure to ask if the advisor is legally obligated 
to adhere to a fiduciary standard. Being a fiduciary means they have to place 
your interests first, above their own and those of their company. If they’re not 
a fiduciary, caveat emptor! (We talk more about this in Chapter 16.)
 
When choosing a broker type, in addition to considering the commission rates 
and level of control you’ll maintain, you also need to think about how you 
want to do your business. Over the phone? In person? Online? Each firm has 
different rates and schedules for different services.
Buying on your own
Don’t want to deal with brokers? No problem. You can buy securities directly 
from a company and skip the cost of a commission.
Some companies allow investors to buy stock directly from them through 
direct purchase programs (DPPs), also called direct investment programs 
(DIPs). You can buy shares all at once, or invest monthly, quarterly, or annu-
ally. This option is a good one for small investors. Minimum investments are 
low to start a DPP, and although more companies are charging service fees, 
these fees are lower than a typical brokerage commission.
If you’re interested in a particular company, you can find more information 
on its Web site or through its investor relations department, or you can go 
to the Web site of the stock exchange that the company trades on. Services 
that specialize in helping small investors buy in small quantities are The 
Moneypaper (www.directinvesting.com) and ShareBuilder (www.
sharebuilder.com); these services charge a fee.

187
 Chapter 9: Buying Securities
After you become a shareholder, you then qualify for a dividend reinvestment 
plan (DRP), for companies that provide such a plan. DRPs allow you to auto-
matically use your dividend to buy more shares of a company’s stock, with-
out paying a commission. If a company doesn’t have a DPP, have a broker 
buy a share for you; after that, you qualify for the company’s DRP.
 
A DRP can be a very appealing option. By dollar cost averaging — investing a 
small constant amount of money regularly — you buy less of an investment 
when it goes up in price and more when it comes down. It’s also the only way, 
other than through a mutual fund, for you to have your dividends automatically 
reinvested at no additional cost. Because reinvested dividends make up a large 
portion of your total return over the long term, this is a significant benefit.
A disadvantage to doing it on your own is getting the best execution (the 
price at which you buy or sell your security). Let’s say you’re watching the 
stock of a particular company, you suddenly see a good price, and you want 
to buy it immediately to capitalize on the price. Well, it’s unlikely that you’ll 
be able to do that if you’re buying through a DPP or DIP. By using a broker, 
you could log on to the Internet and buy the stock right away or call your 
broker and place the trade over the phone.
Another disadvantage to going it alone is that reregistering your stock (chang-
ing the title of ownership) is more difficult and complicated. Let’s say you 
own stock in 20 different companies, each through a DPP or DIP. Upon your 
death, your beneficiary would have to go to each of the 20 different com-
panies with a death certificate and all the other necessary paperwork to 
reregister the stock to his name. This is awfully time-consuming, and it’s a 
paperwork nightmare! Holding all 20 of these stocks with one broker makes 
this process much easier.
Understanding Fees and Expenses
Fees, fees, fees. It seems like every time you turn around, another one 
catches you by surprise. Forewarned is forearmed, as the saying goes, so 
take the time in this section to become familiar with all the fees and expenses 
involved in owning an investment.
Mutual-fund fees
As with any sale, as a shareholder you may expect to pay for fees called 
shareholder fees, which are triggered whenever you buy or sell shares. But 

188
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
you may not be prepared for operating expenses, which a fund charges indi-
rectly and passes along to you; these fees pay for all sorts of costs, and it’s 
extremely helpful if you understand them. We take a closer look at both types 
of fees in this section.
 
It’s important to know how much you pay in fees or commissions for an 
investment and services. They lower the total return your investment earns.
Shareholder fees
There are several fees you may pay, depending on the fund’s policies:
 
✓ When you buy an investment, the fund may charge an initial front-end 
load (a sales charge), which typically goes to the brokers who sell you 
shares. The fee, which is based on the amount invested and deducted 
from each investment made into the fund, generally decreases as the 
amount of your investment increases.
 
✓ On the other end, when you go to redeem shares, you may pay a deferred 
or back-end load (also known as a back-end sales charge). Generally, the 
longer shares are held, the more this charge declines. This fee typically 
goes to the broker who sells you your shares. Some good news: This fee 
may decrease to zero if you hold your shares long enough.
 
✓ Some funds charge you a purchase fee to buy shares. This fee sounds 
like, but isn’t, a front-end load that goes to the broker. Instead, a pur-
chase fee goes to the fund.
 
✓ Okay, so if there’s an additional fee on the front end, what can you 
expect to pay to some funds when you sell? A redemption fee. This fee 
goes to the fund, not the broker.
 
✓ Incredibly, some funds charge you an exchange fee (also known as a 
transfer fee), for moving your money from one fund into another after 
you’re invested with them. If you don’t want to be nickeled and dimed to 
death after the fact, before you invest, make sure you know if your fund 
will impose this charge.
 
✓ The fund may charge you an account fee, just to maintain your account, 
especially if your account’s value falls below a certain dollar amount.
 
Front-end loads reduce the amount of your investment. If you invest $10,000 in 
a fund with a 5 percent front-end load, you pay $500 in a sales load and only 
$9,500 is invested in the fund. According to the organization that regulates the 
securities industry, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), firms 
can’t charge a front-end load of more than 8.5 percent.

189
 Chapter 9: Buying Securities
Not all funds charge all these fees. Before buying a mutual fund, make sure 
you understand the fees involved. When it comes to fees, there are generally 
three types of funds you can purchase:
 
✓ Load: Load funds typically charge either an upfront fee (usually a 
percentage), a back-end fee (meaning when you sell it), or both.
 
✓ No load: No-load funds typically have no upfront fee, but both a short-
term trading fee and a back-end fee may be charged when you sell. 
However, the short-term trading fee is eliminated after a matter of days 
(typically 30 to 90 days), while the back-end fee can take many years to 
phase out.
 
 Our advice: Stick with no-load funds that don’t levy front-end or back-
end charges.
 
✓ Transaction fee: Transaction-fee funds usually charge a flat dollar 
amount upfront to buy and also may have a short-term trading fee if you 
sell too soon.
 
All three types of funds have annual ongoing costs called expense ratios, 
which are intended to cover ongoing operating expenses of the fund (see 
the next section).
Annual operating expenses
Annual operating expenses are the fees a fund may charge you for the cost 
of doing business on your behalf. There are several categories of annual 
operating expenses:
 
✓ Management fees: Fund management taps these fees from a fund’s assets 
to compensate them for their work and to cover any administrative fees 
that aren’t absorbed in the “other expenses” category.
 
✓ 12b-1 fees: These fees pay for the costs of marketing and distribution — 
the marketing and selling of fund shares — which includes compensating 
brokers and others who sell fund shares; the cost of advertising, which 
includes the printing and mailing of prospectuses to new investors and 
sales literature; and fees paid to those who respond to investor inquiries 
and provide investors with information about their investments.
 
✓ Other expenses: These expenses may include custodial expenses, legal 
and accounting expenses, transfer agent expenses, and other adminis-
trative expenses.
 
✓ Total annual fund operating expenses: This fee is the percentage of 
operating expenses that it takes the fund to operate.

190
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
 
You’ll find a fund’s expense ratio on the fee table in the fund’s prospectus. The 
expense ratio can help you make comparisons among funds.
 
Some funds call themselves no load, meaning that the fund doesn’t charge a 
sales load (fee). But that gives investor the impression that there aren’t any 
fees at all. In reality, a no-load fund may charge several fees — purchase fees, 
redemption fees, exchange fees, account fees, and operating expenses, for 
example. Carefully review the fee tables of any funds you’re considering, 
including no-load funds; even small differences in fees can add up over time.
Brokerage fees
Whether you buy (and sell) funds or individual securities, the broker you 
use to execute your trades deserves a fee or commission for this service. In 
some cases, that fee is a percentage of the dollar amount transacted; in other 
cases, the fee might be a flat charge per trade; or it can be a combination, 
particularly for large trades.
Most fee-only advisors work for an independent firm under this model 
(meaning, they aren’t associated with any of the brokerage firms on Wall 
Street). Typically, they’ll have your assets kept at a brokerage firm acting as 
custodian (a firm that is legally responsible for holding and safekeeping your 
investments — Fidelity and Schwab are the largest players in this business). 
The commissions to buy and sell securities on your behalf are also kept by 
the custodian.
Some financial advisors who work for brokerage firms or banks are compen-
sated by commissions only. Here, the commissions may get built into the total 
price of the product you’re buying (meaning that you won’t see what that 
commission really is). There could be commissions to buy and sell individual 
securities (again, this will vary depending on what type of broker you use and 
if you place trades over the phone or online). Also, you want to ask about 
whether there are any account maintenance fees, inactivity fees, or any other 
service fees associated with your account. If you’re buying mutual funds or 
insurance products, typically fees are built into the price of the product. Last, 
be aware that there usually is a fee to close your account as well.
Under a wrap-fee approach, a brokerage house manages an investor’s portfo-
lio for an all-inclusive fee, charged on a quarterly or annual basis, that covers 
all administrative, commission, and management expenses. This means that 
you can trade an unlimited number of times for one set annual fee (usually 
some percentage of the value of the portfolio) that covers all costs and fees.

191
 Chapter 9: Buying Securities
 
Think about what type of investor you are before committing to a wrap fee. 
Will you make enough trades to justify the annual percentage fee? If you’re 
more of a buy-and-hold investor, this arrangement may not be the best for 
you. Usually, there is a minimum account size of at least $50,000 to qualify for 
this service.
 
The most important lesson in all this is for you as the investor or customer to 
fully understand how your advisor and broker are compensated. That way you 
know how they’re paid and if they’re a good fit for your needs. Define how you 
want the relationship to work and which services you require, and match that 
up with the right way to pay for those services. (Turn to Chapter 16 for more 
on financial advisors and their compensation structure.)

Chapter 10
Knowing Where to Put Your 
Assets: Asset Location
In This Chapter
▶ Thinking about your accounts in a holistic way
▶ Understanding the tax characteristics of your investments
▶ Trying out an asset location exercise
W
ouldn’t it be a shame if you did all the right things to get your assets 
properly allocated, and bought all the right securities, only to see 
your hard-earned gains go to the tax man? Wouldn’t it be even worse if it 
happened unnecessarily? That’s what can happen (and does happen to most 
investors) if you don’t consider another step — asset location.
Asset allocation is all about decreasing risk and increasing return. Asset loca-
tion is all about saving taxes.
Put simply, asset location is putting tax-inefficient (highly taxable) invest-
ments in tax-deferred accounts, and putting tax-efficient investments in 
taxable accounts. If asset allocation (Chapter 8) is picking the right (and 
right-size) baskets, and security selection (Chapter 9) is picking the right 
eggs to put in those baskets, then asset location is deciding on the right 
shelves on which to store those baskets.
That’s what we cover in this chapter. First, we take a look at all the different 
types of accounts you may have, and what their tax characteristics are. Then 
we examine the tax efficiency of your different asset classes and investments. 
Finally, we give you hands-on information about how best to stock those 
shelves. We follow the progress of John and Jane Doe, a fictional couple 
whom we introduce in Chapter 8, as they tackle the issue.

194
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
Viewing Your Accounts Holistically
If you’re like most investors, you have more than one investment account. If 
you’re married, you may have six or more accounts within your family. Some 
investors have as many as a dozen accounts.
It may sound like an awful lot, but consider the following, which are just a few 
of the common types of investment accounts:
 
✓ A tax-deferred 401(k) account with your employer
 
✓ A tax-deferred individual retirement account (IRA)
 
✓ A tax-deferred health savings account (HSA)
 
✓ At least one taxable account, such as a brokerage account
If you’re married, both you and your spouse could have each of those kinds 
of accounts. You may also have one or more joint accounts. It’s really not 
that difficult for a family to end up with double-digit investment accounts.
But it doesn’t end there. You could have even more investment accounts. 
You and your spouse may also own a Roth IRA (which you fund with post-
tax dollars that then grow for you on a tax-free basis). And this doesn’t even 
count any custodial or educational accounts you may have set up for your 
children and grandchildren (though you shouldn’t include these accounts in 
your asset allocation, because they actually don’t belong to you).
 
If you have several investment accounts in your family, you may be tempted to 
do the same asset allocation separately within each account. But it’s better to 
apply your asset allocation holistically — in the aggregate across all your sepa-
rate accounts. If you shoot for identical allocation within each account, then 
you can waste the tax advantages that some of your accounts provide you. 
And it’s the overall allocation — across all your accounts taken together — 
that matters.
So, how should you allocate within each account? We answer that question 
throughout this chapter, but the following example offers a big clue: Say 
you have invested assets that total $500,000, spread across two accounts — 
an IRA and a taxable brokerage account — with $250,000 in each account. 
Assume that your chosen asset allocation calls for 10 percent of your port-
folio to be allocated to real estate investment trusts (REITs). You could, 
of course, allocate 10 percent of each account to REITs, buying $25,000 of 
REITs in your IRA and another $25,000 in your taxable account. But is that 
the best way to do it? REITs are notoriously tax-inefficient, throwing off lots 
of ordinary income that gets taxed at your highest tax rate. (By the way, that 

195
 Chapter 10: Knowing Where to Put Your Assets: Asset Location
doesn’t make REITs a bad investment, just a highly taxable one.) So, why not 
buy all $50,000 of your REITs in your IRA? There, the income is tax deferred. 
Save your taxable account for assets that are more tax-friendly. After all, the 
thing that matters is that you have $50,000 (10 percent of $500,000) of REITs 
somewhere in your portfolio.
Sounds simple, right? In this case, it’s pretty straightforward, but your deci-
sions get a little more complicated when you have more than two accounts 
in your portfolio and you consider all the other asset classes you want to 
allocate to.
In this section, we take a closer look at your accounts to help you make the 
right asset location decisions, so you can be sure to place your assets where 
they’ll do you (and your portfolio) the most good.
Considering taxable accounts
Most non-retirement investment accounts are taxable — the investment 
income (dividends and interest) and realized capital gains (profit that results 
from the sale of an investment) generated within such accounts are subject 
to income tax in the year in which they occur. Here are three types of non-
retirement investment accounts:
 
✓ Individual: An individual account is registered to a single owner. 
Sometimes, this type of account can be a transfer on death (TOD) 
account, if the owner has designated a beneficiary in the event of her 
death.
 
✓ Joint: Joint accounts are typically owned by a husband and wife 
together. When it comes to investment accounts, the two most common 
types of joint ownership are
 
• Joint tenants with right of survivorship (JTWROS): In this type 
of account, accountholders have an equal right to the account’s 
assets and survivorship rights. The survivor inherits the total 
value of the other member’s share of account assets upon the 
death of that other member. A JTWROS account can have more 
than two owners.
 
• Tenants in common (TIC): In this type of account, accounthold-
ers have an equal right to assets on a pro rata basis. For example, 
if there are two accountholders, each share is worth 50 percent. 
They also have survivorship rights, meaning that they can retain 
their share of assets should the other accountholder die. But the 
survivor doesn’t automatically acquire the rights (and assets) of the 
deceased accountholder unless that transfer is spelled out in a will.

196
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
 
 Some states, such as California, consider all marital assets to be neither 
TIC nor JTWROS, but instead community property (CP) assets. CP titling 
doesn’t give you the flexibility you’d like, so if you live in a CP state, you 
should consider establishing lifetime trusts, individually for you and 
your spouse.
 
✓ Trusts: Trusts may exist for any number of purposes. A trust is a prop-
erty interest held by one person for the benefit of another. There are 
many types of trusts: Some are lifetime trusts that you set up while 
you’re alive; others you receive as part of an estate. For example, a 
minor could have her assets held in a trust until she’s old enough to 
receive income and/or principal. Investors living in CP states sometimes 
use lifetime trusts to effectively convert account ownership from CP to 
TIC (see Chapter 6).
 
 There’s an alphabet soup of trusts: CRUTs, CRATs, CLTs, GRATs, and 
QPRTs, to name just a few. Our purpose in this chapter isn’t to define 
and describe each and every type of trust out there, but simply to point 
out that whatever trusts you may own, consider them part of your over-
all investment portfolio.
 
 If you want more information on trusts, check out Estate Planning For 
Dummies, by N. Brian Caverly, Esq., and Jordan S. Simon (Wiley), and 
Wills & Trusts Kit For Dummies, by Aaron Larson (Wiley).
 
Taxable accounts — of all the types we describe in this section — are good 
locations for tax-efficient investments (see “Considering the tax efficiency [or 
inefficiency] of your investments,” later in this chapter).
Getting the most out of joint ownership rules
Married couples should pay special attention to 
the rules that govern the ways in which assets 
are handled if one spouse passes away. It’s 
certainly not the happiest topic for discussion 
but one that you should definitely bring up with 
your spouse so that you can be sure to get the 
most out of your assets if something awful were 
to happen.
For example, you and your spouse should equal-
ize your assets as much as you can while you’re 
still living. That way, if anything should happen 
to one of you, the surviving spouse will have 
more flexibility in sheltering assets from estate 
taxes. This is particularly important if you have 
a spouse who isn’t a U.S. citizen.
For similar reasons, you should also review 
the assets you own jointly with your spouse — 
both invested assets and use assets (such as 
your house) — to determine if they’re titled as 
JTWROS or TIC. TIC titling gives the surviving 
spouse more flexibility upon the death of the 
other spouse to shelter the deceased spouse’s 
share of the joint asset from estate tax.
Consult with a qualified financial planning and/
or estate planning expert (see Chapter 16) before 
you consider an estate-planning strategy.

197
 Chapter 10: Knowing Where to Put Your Assets: Asset Location
Understanding tax-deferred 
and tax-free accounts
With tax-deferred accounts, such as 401(k) plans, IRAs, and annuities, you 
don’t pay tax until you begin withdrawals. With a tax-free account, such as a 
Roth IRA, you don’t get a tax break on the front end, but you pay no tax when 
you begin withdrawals. With tax-free HSAs, you pay no tax at all, but with one 
stipulation: You have to use the money for the designated purposes of fund-
ing allowable health costs.
 
✓ 401(k)s: A 401(k) plan is a qualified retirement plan offered by an employer 
that allows employees to defer a certain amount of their compensation 
from taxation. The income that goes into the 401(k) isn’t taxed when it’s 
received. The subsequent investment income and gains on the account 
are also tax deferred.
 
 But it’s not all good news: When funds are removed from the 401(k), 
they’re taxed at ordinary income-tax rates. There are IRS rules and regu-
lations on the eligible amounts that can be contributed to the 401(k) 
each year, as well as on the timing and amount of withdrawals.
 
 When you no longer work for the employer, you can roll over the 401(k) 
balance into your IRA with no tax consequences. This rollover is often 
advantageous because investment choices within a 401(k) are limited to 
a menu provided by the employer, whereas, in an IRA, the choices are 
virtually limitless.
 
 There are also advantages to rolling over a 401(k) when it comes to fees. 
Fees within a 401(k) are often high and hard to identify, so an identical 
investment within your IRA may give you a higher net return.
 
✓ Traditional IRAs: Traditional IRAs are very similar to 401(k)s in terms of 
tax deferral, contribution limits, and withdrawal requirements. But you 
can set them up on your own — you don’t go through an employer.
 
✓ Roth IRAs: Roth IRAs are similar to traditional IRAs, but instead of 
contributing pre-tax income, you contribute post-tax income to a Roth. 
Investment income and growth are tax deferred (just like in a traditional 
IRA), but withdrawals are totally tax-free (unlike in a traditional IRA) as 
long as the money doesn’t come out too soon. The IRS makes the rules 
on the contribution limits and withdrawal timing. For more information, 
contact the IRS at 800-829-1040 or go to www.irs.gov.
 
✓ HSAs: HSAs allow you to put pre-tax income into an account that 
grows tax-deferred. If withdrawals are used to pay qualified healthcare 
expenses, those withdrawals are tax-free. HSAs need to be established in 
conjunction with a so-called high-deductible health plan (HDHP) and are 
typically available through your employer.

198
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
 
✓ Annuities: Annuities typically provide you with regular payments after 
you put up a premium to an issuer, usually an insurance company. 
Payments can be fixed, or they can vary (depending on the investment 
performance of the securities in the policy). In either case, payments 
can be for a specified number of years (in what’s called an annuity cer-
tain) or for the rest of your life (in a life annuity).
 
 There are enough annuity varieties to fill a book (check out Annuities For 
Dummies, by Kerry Pechter [Wiley], for more information), but here’s 
one important annuity fact that you need to know: Annuities have an 
attractive tax-deferral feature that means income and capital gains aren’t 
taxed as they occur. You pay tax only when you start receiving pay-
ments, and only on a portion of each payment. (The rest is considered 
return of your principal.)
 
Of all the types of accounts we describe in this section, tax-advantaged accounts 
(whether tax-deferred or tax-free) are good locations for tax-inefficient invest-
ments (see “Considering the tax efficiency [or inefficiency] of your 
investments,” later in this chapter).
Understanding the Tax Characteristics 
of Your Investments
As we say throughout this book, it’s not what you earn with your invest-
ments, but what you keep, that really matters. Taxes can have a major impact 
on the success of your investments, and you need to pay special attention to 
tax considerations when figuring out your asset location. Some investments 
are more tax-efficient, or tax friendly, than others. But how is that charac-
teristic determined? It’s simple: The tax efficiency of an investment is deter-
mined by the degree to which its income is taxed.
You can see the tax efficiency (or inefficiency) of several common types of 
investments in Table 10-1. Some, such as growth stocks and municipal bonds, 
are more tax-efficient than others, such as REITs and commodity funds. In 
this section, we provide you with plenty of details on the relative tax effi-
ciency of each of these investments and more. Then we reveal how you 
should go about placing the investments in the most appropriate accounts to 
ensure excellent asset location. Read on to get a feel for how taxes can affect 
your investments, and how you should locate your assets based on those tax 
characteristics.

You might ask yourself, “Why would I want to include tax-inefficient invest-
ments in my portfolio at all?” Keep in mind that there are many other fea-
tures of those investments — for example, high returns, attractive levels of 
volatility, and the potential for negative correlation with other assets in your 
portfolio — that can make them very valuable ingredients in your portfolio. 
Some investments may be quite taxable, but in most cases it’s worth it to put 
up with the taxes to reap the rewards.
Considering the tax efficiency (or 
inefficiency) of your investments
As you decide which investments to buy in each of your accounts, it’s impor-
tant to recognize how tax-efficient each of those investments is. We discuss 
many details of these investments in Chapters 3 and 9, but here we focus on 
their tax characteristics:
 
✓ Growth stocks: Growth stocks are those that pay relatively small (if any) 
dividends. Instead, the upside of growth stocks lies in their potential for 
above-average share price growth. Because these stocks generate very 
little income, they’re subject to little tax.
 
✓ International stocks: Stocks of non-U.S. companies, and funds that 
include these international stocks, are sometimes subject to foreign 
taxes. However, you can get a credit for the foreign taxes when it comes 
time to file your U.S. taxes, if these stocks are held in a taxable account.
 
✓ Municipal bonds: Interest income from bonds issued by states and 
municipalities is generally free from income tax at the federal level and 
in the state of issue. As far as tax efficiency goes, munis (as they’re 
sometimes called) are tough to beat.
 
✓ REITs: REITs are required to pay a large portion of their income to inves-
tors each year. This income is categorized as ordinary income, which 
means it’s subject to the highest tax rates. Taxes on REITs can get ugly.

200
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
 
✓ Taxable bonds: Interest income from corporate and Treasury bonds is 
fully taxable at the federal level. Corporate bond income is also taxable 
at the state level. The income is considered ordinary income, which 
means that it’s taxable at your highest rate. Yikes! And the larger the 
coupon rate (the interest earned on the security), the more taxable 
income there is.
 
✓ Commodity funds: The commodity funds we discuss in this book have 
the potential to generate highly taxable income. This is because the 
securities that are held within those funds can throw off a lot of taxable 
gains, which are passed along to the fund’s shareholders.
 
✓ Mutual funds: Mutual funds often have to sell some of their underlying 
securities, usually to raise cash to pay investors who sell their shares in 
the fund. The taxable gains resulting from those sales are distributed to 
the remaining shareholders of the fund, usually at the end of each year. 
You don’t have a single ounce of control over those taxable gains, and 
you don’t know their magnitude in advance, unfortunately. They just hit 
you with it.
 
 This feature is much less common among ETFs and many ETNs, so you 
might consider those if you want to include funds in your portfolio (a 
good idea) but don’t like the idea of losing out when other fund inves-
tors decide to sell their shares.
Knowing where to locate investments 
based on tax characteristics
If you read through the tax characteristics of the various investments we list 
in the preceding section, you know that different types of investments can 
have very different levels of tax efficiency. So how do you know where (in 
which accounts) you should locate those investments?
 
It’s actually very simple: You use the relative tax efficiency of each investment 
that you’re considering buying to decide which account to buy it in. So, to the 
extent you can, you want to buy your REITs, taxable bonds, commodity funds, 
and mutual funds (all tax-heavy investments) in tax-deferred accounts like 
your 401(k) and IRA. By the same token, it really pays off to use your taxable 
account(s) to buy your growth stocks, international stocks, municipal bonds, 
ETFs, and ETNs. You keep your highly taxed investments in the tax-deferred 
accounts and keep your tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts.
That all sounds terrific — and it is — but, to be honest, you may not be able 
to accomplish it on the level you’d like. Why? There are several reasons. For 
example, your IRA may not be big enough to allow you to buy all the tax-inef-
ficient investments that you want to buy. There are ways to deal with these 
challenges, though, and we tackle them in the next section.

 Chapter 10: Knowing Where to Put Your Assets: Asset Location
Going through the Asset 
Location Exercise
The best way to grasp the importance of asset location for minimizing the 
negative effects of taxes and maximizing the quality of your portfolio is to 
take a good hard look at an example. That’s exactly what we provide in this 
section — a useful example of how clever placement of investments in the 
right accounts can really cut down on the amount of taxes that are pulled out 
of your returns.
In Chapter 8, we discuss John and Jane Doe, and we explain the asset alloca-
tion they derived for themselves (okay, with a little help from us). The Does’ 
asset allocation is shown in Table 10-2.

As you can see in the table, the Does allocate 15 percent of their portfolio to 
fixed-income investments, 60 percent to equities, and the remaining 25 percent 
to alternatives. (We discuss asset classes in detail in Chapter 3.)
Now, suppose that the Does’ investment portfolio is $500,000. In the right-
hand column, we show their allocation in dollars. For example, $75,000 (which 
equals 15 percent of the total $500,000 portfolio) is in fixed income, $300,000 
(60 percent) is in equities, and $125,000 (25 percent) is in alternatives.
John and Jane never seem to get too upset with us when we make assump-
tions about them, so we’ll further assume that their portfolio consists of three 
accounts: an IRA for John, an IRA for Jane, and a TIC account for the two of 
them jointly. John’s IRA is relatively small at $25,000, while Jane’s is larger 
($125,000). Their biggest account is their TIC account, consisting of $350,000. 
One more assumption: All their assets are in cash, waiting to be allocated.
So, how should the Does locate their assets in order to achieve their desired 
asset allocation in the most tax-efficient way? Have a look at Table 10-3 for 
one way they can do it.

We’ll walk you through the numbers in Table 10-3. The Does start with their 
tax-inefficient assets — a wise move. They know they want to buy $40,000 in 
real estate, and they decide to use up all of John’s IRA to buy $25,000 worth 
of REITs. They then buy the remaining $15,000 of REITs (to complete their 
$40,000 allocation) in Jane’s IRA. In her IRA, they also buy all $85,000 of their 
allocation to commodities via a commodities index mutual fund. It may seem 
like they should be worried about taxable distributions from the mutual fund, 
but that’s not a concern because the fund will be housed in a tax-deferred 
account. That’s one example of the savvy asset location that’s at work here.
To continue with the asset location example in Table 10-3, the Does have 
$25,000 left over in Jane’s IRA, which they use to buy an intermediate-term 
bond fund. Because the fund is in a tax-deferred account, they opt for a tax-
able bond fund, which has a higher yield than a tax-free municipal bond fund. 
Then all the rest of the purchases are made in the TIC account. To round out 
the fixed-income allocation — they still need to own $50,000 in fixed-income 
investments according to their asset allocation plan (refer to Table 10-2) — 
the Does buy $50,000 in municipal bond funds. (They buy $25,000 each in 

204
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
short-term and long-term bond funds.) They also buy all their equities in the 
TIC. That causes the Does no woes, because even the stocks and stock funds 
they bought that actually pay dividends will pay qualified dividends, which 
means that they’re taxed at lower federal tax rates than what the Does would 
expect for ordinary income.
The Does have done a fine job of not only allocating their assets, but locat-
ing them as well. They’ve kept their highly taxed investments in their 
tax-deferred accounts, and their tax-efficient investments in their taxable 
accounts. You won’t find these particular Does with a deer-in-the-headlights 
look when tax time comes around.
Suppose, though, that the Does’ IRAs weren’t large enough to accommo-
date their desired allocations to tax-inefficient assets. Jane’s IRA could’ve 
been $25,000 instead of $125,000, and their TIC account $450,000 instead 
of $350,000. What would they do then? In that case, they’d buy $15,000 in 
REITs in Jane’s IRA and only $10,000 in commodities, because that’s all the 
room that was left in that account. The balance of the commodity purchase 
($75,000) would have to be made in the TIC account, along with the $25,000 in 
intermediate-term bonds. Recognizing the taxable nature of the TIC account, 
the Does would make sure they bought an ETF or ETN instead of a mutual 
fund to cover their commodity exposure there, and a municipal bond fund 
instead of a taxable bond fund.
 
When it comes to asset location, it’s usually a good idea to tackle your tax-
inefficient investments first, and try to buy as much as you can of them in your 
tax-deferred accounts. When you complete that, you’ll know whether you had 
enough room in your tax-deferred accounts to accommodate all of them. If you 
did, then you can fill up the rest of those accounts with tax-efficient assets (you 
really don’t lose anything by doing so) and then buy the remainder of the tax-
friendly assets in your taxable accounts. But if you don’t have enough room 
in your tax-deferred accounts for all your tax-inefficient investments, then you 
have no choice but to buy the remaining portion of the tax-inefficient assets, as 
well as your tax-friendly assets, in your taxable accounts.
Do as good a job as you possibly can when it comes to asset location. You’ll 
be glad you focused on the tax details and made the extra effort.

Rebalancing and Other 
Smart Strategies
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how to rebalance your portfolio
▶ Knowing how to keep tabs on the securities you own
▶ Taking advantage of smart and simple tax strategies
D
esigning and building your portfolio isn’t the end of the asset allocation 
recipe we work at perfecting throughout this book. To keep delivering 
the appetizing portfolio results you desire, you need to do diligent mainte-
nance to make sure your portfolio stays true to your recipe.
Your portfolio should be monitored for several reasons. You may need to 
replace individual securities that lose their luster. Taxes are always a part 
of the investing picture, so you can be sure that tax considerations may also 
dictate some remedial action. And, perhaps most important, your portfolio 
can drift away from its intended allocation due to the vagaries of the markets 
and occasionally need to be brought back to target by rebalancing on the 
right schedule.
In this chapter, we go through a helpful step-by-step rebalancing exercise 
with our fantastic fictional financial friends John and Jane Doe. We look at the 
details of how they rebalance their portfolio, so that you can understand how 
rebalancing can work for you and get you the benefits you deserve. We also 
show you a few other hands-on strategies, beginning with the importance of 
keeping tabs on the individual securities you own and always being aware of 
certain tax-driven opportunities, such as timing the sale of your securities 
and harvesting tax losses.

206
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
If you use the monitoring and opportunistic adjustment approach we recom-
mend in this chapter, you’ll end up ahead of most investors, because you’ll 
decrease the risk of your portfolio and increase your returns over the long 
term.
Rebalancing Your Portfolio
In Chapter 5, we talk about the what and why of portfolio rebalancing. In this 
section, we take you through the how. Rebalancing is an incredibly important 
process, so flip back to Chapter 5 to bone up if you need to. If you already 
know the rebalancing basics, dive right in!
Dealing with portfolio drift
As we discuss in Chapter 5, not all your asset classes will grow at the same 
rate. In other words, you can count on the markets disrupting your asset 
allocation every day — it’s the nature of the beast. Over time, your portfolio 
will drift away — sometimes far away — from its target allocation. When that 
happens, it’s time to rebalance your portfolio.
Defining portfolio drift
When it comes to a drifting portfolio, how far is too far? In Chapter 5, we tell 
you about the importance of setting a tolerance band around your target 
allocations. A tolerance band is the range (usually plus or minus a certain 
percentage) within which you allow your asset allocations to fluctuate with-
out taking action. If your actual allocation at any given time departs from 
its target by more than the tolerance you’ve set, then it’s time to rebalance. 
That’s how you know when to rebalance. It’s as simple as that.
 
Tolerance bands can be of any size, but we suggest you go with ±20 percent 
around each of your allocation percentages.
For example, if your target allocation to the consumer staples asset class 
(check out Chapter 3 for more on asset classes) is 10 percent, then ±20 per-
cent of that target is ±2 percent (0.10 × 0.20 = 0.02). In that case, you rebal-
ance if the size of your consumer staples investment drifts above 12 percent 
or below 8 percent of your portfolio. If another asset class has a target allo-
cation of 5 percent, then ±20 percent of that target is ±1 percent (0.05 × 0.20 
= 0.01), so you’d rebalance if that class were to drift outside of a range of 4 
percent to 6 percent.

207
 Chapter 11: Monitoring Your Portfolio: Rebalancing and Other Smart Strategies
Catching the (portfolio) drift
There’s no better way for you to understand how to identify portfolio drift 
than by working through an example situation. The example we use is that 
of John and Jane Doe, whom you may remember (fondly, no doubt) from 
Chapter 8. The first step is to nail down the tolerance bands for the Does’ 
portfolio, which is what we do for you in Table 11-1. (We use the same ±20 
percent tolerance band guideline that we champion in the preceding 
section.)

As you can see in the figure, the Does have a target allocation of 5 percent 
for each of the fixed-income asset subclasses. So using the ±20 percent tol-
erance-band guideline, the Does’ fixed-income investments have a tolerance 
band of 4 percent to 6 percent (±20 percent of 5 percent). The 10 percent 
target allocation to the consumer staples sector within the large-cap equity 
subclass has a tolerance range of 8 percent to 12 percent.

Now that we’ve established the Does’ target allocations and their tolerance 
bands, let’s put some meat on the bones. Table 11-2 shows you what the 
Does’ portfolio looks like in dollars.

As you can see in Table 11-2, we assume that the Does have an initial invest-
ment portfolio of $500,000. Their allocation to short-term fixed income is 
$25,000 (which equals 5 percent of the total $500,000 portfolio); their alloca-
tion to small-cap equities is $20,000 (4 percent of $500,000); and on down the 
line.
Table 11-2 shows you where the Does started out in our example, and in 
Table 11-3 you can see how the Does were faring six months into our exam-
ple. Six months later, the Does’ portfolio is up to $530,000. As is typically the 
case, this growth didn’t occur uniformly across all asset classes. Take a look.

As the figure indicates, the Does’ original $25,000 in short-term fixed income 
grew to $27,000 and their $50,000 in consumer staples shrank to $45,000. You 
can see some interesting movement in the other asset subclasses as well.
Just like what will inevitably happen to your portfolio, the Does’ actual asset 
allocation saw some drift over their portfolio’s first six months. But did the 
uneven growth or shrinkage in the Does’ asset classes/subclasses take 
the Does’ portfolio outside of its tolerance bands? For an answer, look at 
the Does’ actual asset allocation percentages at the six-month mark. Their 
$27,000 in short-term fixed income, divided by their portfolio total of $530,000 
is 5.1 percent; their $80,000 in healthcare, divided by $530,000, is 15.1 percent 

210
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
of the total portfolio; and so on through each asset class. You can see that 
the 6.5 percent in industrials now exceeds the 6 percent top end of the toler-
ance band for that sector. Also, 5.3 percent in energy is below the 6 percent 
low end of that sector’s tolerance band. And the 22.3 percent in commodities 
exceeds the 20 percent high end of its tolerance band.
That’s how you check for portfolio drift — and whether it’s severe enough 
for you to stand up and take action. But how exactly do you take that action? 
Read on to find out.
Rebalancing back to target
When you have at least one asset subclass that has drifted too far away from 
its target allocation, that should trigger you to rebalance, as we discuss in 
Chapter 5. One way to rebalance is to buy and sell sufficient amounts by 
asset subclass to bring every subclass back to target. To continue with the 
John and Jane Doe example, Table 11-4 shows what trades the Does would 
have to make to bring their portfolio back to its target asset allocation. 
(Making adjustments to bring most but not all subclasses back to target is 
also an option, but we cover that in the next section.)

Table 11-4 shows what the Does’ target allocation is in dollars, now that their 
portfolio balance has grown to $530,000. (It’s the updated version of Table 
11-2, six months later.) For example, for short-term fixed income, 5 percent of 
$530,000 is $26,500; for small-cap equities, 4 percent of $530,000 is $21,200.
The necessary trades are simply the difference between the Does’ actual 
dollar allocations to each asset subclass and their target dollar allocations. 
For example, for short-term fixed income, the target of $26,500 minus the 
actual $27,000 is –$500, which means that the Does need to sell $500 of their 
short-term fixed-income investments to get back to target. Likewise, for 
small-cap equities, the target of $21,200 minus the actual $20,000 is $1,200; 
the Does need to buy $1,200 more of small-cap equity investments.
If you add up every amount that needs to be bought and sold, the total is $0, 
meaning that the total buys and the total sells balance each other exactly, as 
they should! After the Does make these trades, they’ll be back to their target 
allocations across the board.
Rebalancing close to target
In practice, the Does — that lovable couple from our running example who 
don’t seem to mind us splashing their financial information all over a For 
Dummies book — may decide that some of their out-of-balance amounts 
aren’t big enough to worry about. In that case, they may decide to forgo 
some of the trades shown in Table 11-4.

212
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
For example, they may decide that the $500 sale of short-term fixed-income 
investments and the $500 buy of long-term fixed-income investments are 
small enough to ignore. They can forgo those trades, and because their 
values are a wash, the remaining total buys would still equal the total sales.
They may also decide that the $200 sale of mid-cap equities is too small to 
concern themselves with. If they forgo that trade, they then must cut back on 
$200 of buys elsewhere. A logical place would be in small-cap equities — they 
might buy $1,000 instead of $1,200 there. We hate to see a good-timin’, rau-
cous, small-cap equity shopping spree cut short, but in this case it’s the best 
choice.
 
Pragmatic decisions like this are perfectly acceptable. They’ll save you time, 
effort, trading costs, and possible taxable gains — and they won’t have a mate-
rial effect on the performance of your portfolio. There are no hard and fast 
rules on where to draw the line on these too-small-to-worry-about trades, but 
you can use the Does’ example as a guideline.
Using a working layer of 
exchange-traded funds
Throughout this book, we do a lousy job of hiding our love for exchange-
traded funds (ETFs). We think ETFs belong in virtually every investor’s port-
folio, for a number of reasons. For example, they’re typically low-cost and 
tax-efficient, and as we explain later in this chapter they present opportuni-
ties for tax-loss harvesting.
You should consider having ETFs in every asset class and subclass in 
your portfolio for yet another reason: ETFs can make rebalancing easier. 
Rebalancing trades are, by their nature, relatively small, fine-tuning trades. 
If you have ETFs in every asset class, you can easily use them to do the 
rebalancing trades you need to do without having to disrupt your holdings 
in bonds, stocks, REITs, and so on. For example, as we explain in Chapter 3, 
you don’t want to sell a bond before it matures if you can help it. In contrast, 
ETFs are so liquid and marketable that trading any odd and/or small number 
of shares just isn’t a problem. They’re agile assets, and when it comes to 
investing, agility is a virtue.
 
Consider having a working layer (enough to cover about half the width of your 
tolerance band) of ETFs in every asset class and subclass in your portfolio. 
(You can apply the working layer concept to mutual funds as well — but, 
again, we just like ETFs better.)

 Chapter 11: Monitoring Your Portfolio: Rebalancing and Other Smart Strategies
Keeping Tabs on Your Securities
Security selection — picking the individual investments you want to own 
within each of your asset classes — isn’t a one-time deal. After you pick ’em, 
you’ve gotta keep an eye on ’em. In this section, we let you know how to 
manage the securities in your portfolio. We also clue you in on when it’s time 
to drop a dud, and we tell you how you can benefit by not being too greedy 
when a security has done well for you. Both moves may seem uncomfortably 
counterintuitive to you at first, but in this section, we explain how they can 
be a real boon to your investment efforts.
Knowing when to hold ’em 
and when to fold ’em
If you own a security that’s done well, you may be tempted to hold onto it 
forever. But sometimes, an extended winning streak simply means that it’s 
time for a hot security to turn cold. There are no hard and fast rules for when 
this may happen, but you don’t want to just ride your winners blindly and 
indefinitely.
Similarly, if you own a security that’s had a rough time and lost lots of market 
value, you may feel obligated to hang onto it until it recovers, and you recoup 
your loss. Sometimes that’s a good strategy; other times, a loser is just a 
loser.
So how do you know when it’s time to wave goodbye to a winner and to cut a 
loser loose? The secret is in the planning. (In the “Setting your security guide-
lines early” section, later in this chapter, we talk about some guidelines you’ll 
want to put in place to protect yourself in both these situations.)
Taking some winnings off the table
In some instances, you may own a security that has done well — maybe even 
better than expected — but hasn’t performed on a superstar level. In those 
cases, you should consider selling some of your investment (but not selling 
out altogether) and putting the proceeds to work in another security that 
has more potential for growth. When you do that, you are, in a sense, play-
ing with house money in the new security, while still leaving enough behind 
in the hot (but not too hot) security to benefit you if it continues its upward 
ride. It’s a conservative move, and one that can really help your overall port-
folio health in the long run.

214
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
But how do you know when to sell off some of your shares of a good security 
in order to reinvest in another security? The guidelines we suggest in the 
next section will help you figure it out.
Setting your security guidelines early
So, how do you decide when to sell off (or at least reduce your ownership 
of) a security? Sometimes it can be really tough to make that call as events 
are unfolding. It’s better to make the decision early on, so you won’t feel as if 
you’re under the gun when the time comes to decide.
 
When you buy a security, go ahead and make your decisions about when (at 
what price) you want to reevaluate your position. That way, if the security’s 
price starts moving up or down erratically, you won’t have to panic because 
you’ve already set guidelines for what to do when the price hits a certain level.
When you stop and think about it, planning your security guidelines makes 
sense, doesn’t it? If you set your guidelines before you buy, you won’t run 
around like a chicken with its head cut off when you feel that the market or 
your personal circumstances are forcing you to take action.
For example, say you buy a stock for $50 per share. To guide your future 
actions, you decide to establish a set of threshold prices around that pur-
chase price. What are those? We’ll say you decide on a bottom alert price of 
$40 (meaning, if the market price falls below that price, you’ll investigate the 
causes). How do you do that investigation?
Well, if the fundamentals of the company are still sound and you believe that 
the market is underpricing the stock for no good reason, or that the stock’s 
entire industry sector is under pressure, you may decide to stick with the 
stock. (For a primer on a stock’s fundamentals, flip back to Chapter 9, where 
we tell you what you need to know about buying individual securities.) On the 
other hand, if the drop in price is triggered by a sudden change in management 
of the company, or the failure of an important new product launch — the new 
line of submarine screen doors doesn’t tickle the market’s fancy, for instance — 
then you may decide to cut and run. The bottom alert price doesn’t trigger an 
automatic response from you; it simply warns you to take a close look.
In addition to the bottom alert price, you may want to set a pair of upper alert 
prices, perhaps one at $65 and another at $75. When you set an upper alert 
price, that means you decide to reevaluate a security when it reaches your 
set price. But why would you set two upper alert prices?

215
 Chapter 11: Monitoring Your Portfolio: Rebalancing and Other Smart Strategies
We’ll start with the first upper alert price from our example. If the market 
price exceeds $65 for reasons other than the entire industry sector coming 
into favor, you should consider reducing your investment in a security by 
enough to take your profit. Here’s how that works: Suppose your initial pur-
chase (at $50 per share) was for 300 shares, costing you $15,000. When the 
market price hits $65, your 300 shares will be worth $19,500. Your profit is, 
therefore, the difference between $15,000 and $19,500, or $4,500. This $4,500 
represents 69 shares at $65 a share (which you may want to round up to 
70 shares so you’re not dealing with “odd lots” of stock, simply because it 
makes buying and selling easier). You then sell 70 of your 300 shares to cash 
in your profits and put the proceeds to work in another security with more 
potential for growth, as we explain earlier.
But what about that second upper alert price? If the market price exceeds 
$75, you may consider exiting the position altogether and looking for another 
stock that has a lot more potential ahead of it. Here again, the alert prices 
don’t set off automatic actions — they merely let you know when you should 
look more closely at the situation.
The close looks you take should include a survey of all the features you consid-
ered when you bought the security. Before you invest your hard-earned money 
in a stock, make sure you check out a company’s 10-K report, which all public 
companies are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml. (This address takes you to EDGAR, the 
Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System.) You want to see a 
healthy income statement (showing steadily increasing revenue and earnings), 
a clean balance sheet, and debt-to-equity and price-to-earnings ratios that are 
at, or below, their industry averages, as we explain in Chapter 9.
 
The time to decide how far you’re willing to go with a stock is before — not 
after — you buy. When volatile changes occur, either in the market or in your 
own personal circumstances, you can be far too emotional and fail to think 
clearly at the time.
Making Smart Tax Choices
As we mention throughout the book, it’s not what you earn that matters, it’s 
what you keep — and we want you to keep every allowable penny of what 
you’ve earned! You don’t need to pay more income taxes than you should — 
but you’ll do exactly that if you overlook some perfectly legitimate ways of 
cutting down your tax bill. We cover tax strategies in more detail in Chapter 
14, but we hit the highlights in this section. Note: Our discussion reviews 
only federal income taxes, which will be a permanent and important factor 
for you.

216
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
Paying attention to taxable 
gains and losses
As you’re monitoring and maintaining your portfolio, be sure to keep an eye 
on the tax implications of what you’re doing. Like any special language — and 
tax talk is certainly one of them — there are certain terms to master. But 
they’re not that hard to grasp, when you take a few minutes to unscramble 
their code.
To begin, whenever you consider selling any security you hold, you should 
know what the embedded taxable gain or loss (also called the unrealized gain 
or loss) is in that holding. The embedded gain/loss is the difference between 
the current market value of your holding and its cost basis (what you paid 
for it). If the current market value is greater than the cost basis, you have an 
embedded gain; if it’s less, you have an embedded loss. You realize the gain 
or loss when you sell the security. And you incur a tax liability (meaning, you 
get taxed) only on realized gains. The IRS can be harsh, but it won’t tax you 
on a loss (or on a gain you haven’t realized yet). So, if the security you’re 
considering selling has an embedded tax loss, you can sell it without fear of a 
tax liability.
 
If you’re selling a security and you’re facing a realized tax loss, you can use 
that loss to offset taxable gains from your other transactions.
If, though, the security you’re considering selling has an embedded tax gain, 
then you have more to think about. We get into those details in the next 
section.
 
Make sure you have a recordkeeping system to keep track of your securities’ 
cost bases. That way you won’t make mistakes or waste a lot of time later 
when you sell a security and need to know whether you had a gain or loss. 
Most brokers keep track of your cost basis and report it to you periodically. 
If you buy and sell securities on your own, you’ll need to know — and keep 
track of — the cost basis for the securities you own. Personal finance software 
applications like Quicken or Microsoft Money can help you do that.
Deferring and offsetting taxable gains
You can do yourself a lot of good if you can remember a few key concepts 
about deferring and offsetting taxable gains.
 
When it comes to tax planning, a simple rule to follow is to take your taxable 
gains as late as you can, and to take your taxable losses as early as you can.

217
 Chapter 11: Monitoring Your Portfolio: Rebalancing and Other Smart Strategies
We talk about deferring your gains in this section and accelerating your 
losses in the next section.
There are several ways that you can defer or even offset your taxable gains, 
and all of them are allowable strategies that will help you to keep more of 
your hard-earned money. Here are some of the ways to defer or offset taxable 
gains:
 
✓ Defer the gain into the next tax year. If it’s mid-December when you 
make your decision to sell a security and earn a taxable gain, you should 
consider waiting a couple of weeks and making the sale in January. That 
way, you’ll have the rest of that year to try to generate tax losses to 
offset the gain. Even if you don’t, you’ll at least get to delay paying the 
tax man for a full year.
 
✓ Wait until the gain is long term. If you’re selling a security that you held 
for almost a year at a gain, it may be a good idea to wait until after the 
one-year anniversary of your purchase. That way, the gain will qualify 
for a long-term capital gains treatment and get taxed at a lower rate.
 
✓ Take advantage of realized losses. You can offset taxable gains with tax-
able losses (what you get when you sell something for less than you paid 
for it) that you may have realized from other sales you made in the same 
tax year.
 
✓ Capitalize on capital loss carryovers. A capital loss carryover is a tax 
loss that you can’t use to offset gains in the year of the loss (that is, your 
gains were not large enough to fully use up all your losses). You can 
offset gains in a given year with capital loss carryovers from prior tax 
years.
We offer some concrete examples in Chapter 14, where we talk about tax con-
siderations in more detail.
 
If you’re going to sell a security, make sure you know the tax implications of 
your decision and plan for its consequences in advance.
Harvesting tax loss opportunities 
with exchange-traded funds
The two previous sections show you why tax losses can be valuable. You 
should be alert to opportunities to generate them whenever you can, and one 
way to do that is through clever use of ETFs (see Chapter 9).

218
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
One of the notable things about ETFs is their popularity. For just about any 
of the asset class baskets where you may want to allocate your assets, you 
have a number of ETFs to choose from, and more are becoming available on 
a regular basis.
So how does this popularity allow you to harvest tax losses with ETFs? Here’s 
an example: Say you decide to invest $20,000 in equities in the energy sector. 
You can choose from several energy ETFs. After considering the possibilities, 
you buy energy ETF A for $20,000 (that’s your cost basis). Now let’s assume 
that the market value of your holding in ETF A drops $2,000 to $18,000. That’s 
probably not enough of a drop to cause you to rebalance your portfolio 
(because your tolerance bands are likely wider than that), but the drop does 
represent a sizeable embedded, or unrealized, tax loss. So what can you do to 
seize this tax loss opportunity without doing damage to your portfolio? You 
can sell your shares in ETF A, and realize a tax loss of $2,000. Then you can 
immediately buy $18,000 of energy ETF B with the proceeds from your sale. 
It’s a smart move for several reasons, including the following:
 
✓ You didn’t change your portfolio’s asset allocation one iota. You had 
$18,000 in the energy sector before the swap, and you have $18,000 in 
the same sector after the swap.
 
✓ You have a realized tax loss of $2,000. You can use that loss to offset 
taxable gains elsewhere in your portfolio, in the current or in future 
years. (Check out the preceding section for more information.)
 
✓ You’re haven’t run afoul of IRS rules. More specifically, you did right 
by the IRS’s rules against what they call wash sales, which disallow tax 
losses if the sale that generated the loss is followed by the purchase of 
an essentially identical security within 30 days. You can steer clear of 
wash sales as long as the ETFs you choose don’t track identical indexes. 
For example, if ETF A tracks an S&P energy sector index and ETF B 
tracks a Dow Jones energy sector index, the ETFs are distinct for IRS 
purposes but basically the same when it comes to asset allocation.
If you’ve already worked your way through Chapter 9 or you’re just familiar 
with how mutual funds work, you may be wondering if you can harvest tax 
losses with mutual funds the way you can with ETFs. Sure! We just generally 
prefer ETFs to mutual funds, for reasons we mention throughout this book 
(cost effectiveness and tax-efficiency, to name a couple).
For more details on tax loss harvesting, turn to Chapter 14.

Chapter 12
Measuring Your Results
In This Chapter
▶ Calculating your investment return
▶ Using benchmarks for investment-return comparisons
▶ Using your Lifetime Cash-flow Projection to track your progress
T
o be the best investor you can be, you need to be able to gauge how well 
you’re doing with your asset allocation recipe. That’s what we focus on 
in this chapter — how to figure out how well your portfolio is doing with a 
high level of accuracy.
We begin the chapter by explaining how to express your investment results 
in a useful way — one that allows you to make meaningful comparisons — by 
calculating your investment return. You can calculate several different types 
of returns, and we explain which ones to use in various circumstances.
We then look at how to find and construct appropriate points of comparison 
(called benchmarks) against which you can gauge your return. And we wrap 
up the chapter by putting your investment performance in its most pertinent 
context: your long-term financial plan.
Throughout this chapter, we explain how the measurements we recommend 
touch upon the five key elements of understanding your investment results: 
principal, term, risk, opportunity cost, and suitability. We also make impor-
tant connections to relevant concepts we introduce in other chapters, such 
as risk and return (see Chapter 2), the range of investment strategies and 
their associated sample asset allocations (see Chapter 8), and your Lifetime 
Cash-flow Projection (see Chapter 7). So get your page-flippin’ fingers ready.
A wise man once said, “You can’t manage what you can’t measure.” Knowing 
how to measure your results correctly is critical to being able to manage 
your financial future.

220
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
Figuring Your Investment Return
Say your neighbor tells you that that he made $10,000 on a recent invest-
ment. That’s not chump change. But how good a result is that, really? The 
quality of that result depends on a whole host of factors, including the 
following:
 
✓ How much he invested in the first place: Was it $25,000? $250,000? 
More?
 
✓ How long he was invested: A month? A year? Longer?
 
✓ The risk level of the investment: Did he stand a realistic chance of 
losing his whole investment (or more)? Was he guaranteed a full return 
of his principal (the amount that he invested)? Did the value of his 
investment fluctuate wildly while he held it?
 
✓ The health of the general investment environment at the time: Was he 
investing in the middle of a bear market (a period when security prices 
are generally falling)? Or was he the beneficiary of a bull market (when 
security prices are rising)?
 
✓ The suitability of the investment for him: Did it help him achieve his 
financial objectives? Or did it put his financial future in unnecessary 
jeopardy?
These five considerations illustrate the five key elements of understanding 
your investment results and putting them in a meaningful context. Those five 
key elements are
 
✓ Principal: The amount you invested (your amount at risk)
 
✓ Term: The length of time over which you’re measuring your results
 
✓ Risk: The degree of safety built into the investment
 
✓ Opportunity cost: The results you could’ve gotten for a typical alterna-
tive investment with similar risk over the same term
 
✓ Suitability: The degree to which this investment is in step with your 
financial plan
These are the most important considerations, but there are others, too, 
including the following:
 
✓ Liquidity: The ability of the investment to be converted to cash on short 
notice without affecting its market value
 
✓ Marketability: The attractiveness of the investment for buyers, at the 
price you want to sell it at

221
 Chapter 12: Measuring Your Results
 
✓ Cost: The cost of the investment, including transaction expenses, man-
agement fees, and loads (see Chapters 9 and 16)
 
✓ Taxes: Perhaps the largest cost of all (see Chapters 6, 10, 11, and 14)
We touch on these other considerations in various chapters throughout this 
book. In this chapter, though, we focus on the five key elements in the first 
list. We cover two of those elements — principal and term — in this section. 
In the “Comparing Your Return to Relevant Benchmarks” section, later in this 
chapter, we address risk and opportunity cost. Then, in the chapter’s final 
section, we take a look at suitability.
Calculating your return
Understanding how to calculate your return is of the utmost importance. We 
start with the basics, focusing on principal.
Paying attention to principal
You should express your results as a percentage of your principal. If you 
invest $250,000, and your investment earns $10,000, your return is 4 percent 
($10,000 ÷ $250,000 = 0.04, or 4 percent). If you express your results this way, 
you normalize the results by essentially taking the size of your principal — 
the first of our five key elements — out of the equation. It also helps you com-
pare your results with your neighbor’s (or anyone else’s) without either of 
you having to know how much the other invested. If your neighbor also made 
$10,000, but he only invested $25,000, his return was 40 percent, quite a bit 
better than yours, all else (term, risk, opportunity, suitability) being equal.
 
When you figure out your return as a percentage of your principal, make sure 
you include both income and growth. Income includes payments you received 
during the course of the investment, such as interest or dividends. Growth 
measures the change in market value of your investment, which can be posi-
tive or negative.
Income and growth are the two components of total return (see Chapter 2).
Coming to terms with term
The second key element for understanding your investment results is term.
Suppose you and your neighbor each had returns of 10 percent, but your 
investment was tied up for two years, while he made his in six months. Well, 
he did much better than you did, all else being equal. For a given return, the 
shorter the term, the better the actual result. After all, time is money.

222
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
So, how do you normalize your results for term, as we did in the preced-
ing section for principal? You express your return on an annualized basis, 
because a year is the most popular period for comparison purposes. In 
Chapter 2, we explain two ways to do this: simple averaging and compound 
averaging. Compound averaging is more realistic and we much prefer it. 
(Turn to Chapter 2 if want to know why and to find out how to calculate it.)
Annualizing returns is so popular, there’s a special name for the result: 
compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Coming up with a CAGR is a multistep 
process, and you can read about how to calculate CAGR in the “Calculating 
your compound annual growth rate” sidebar in this chapter. You don’t have 
to know how to calculate it — there are plenty of programs that can do it for 
you — but just keep in mind that CAGRs are expressed as percentages, and 
the higher the CAGR, the better. In our earlier example, your two-year 10 per-
cent return is equivalent to a CAGR of 4.9 percent. Your neighbor’s six-month 
10 percent return is equivalent to a CAGR of 21 percent. (We explain both 
calculations in the sidebar.) The higher CAGR belongs to your neighbor, so 
his investment did better than yours (all other factors being equal). But you 
knew that already. Using CAGR shows you precisely how much better than 
you he did, on a fair and objective, quantifiable, apples-to-apples basis.
Calculating your compound annual growth rate
Calculating a CAGR can be a tricky process. If 
you’re interested and you’re not scared of some 
math, follow these steps:
 1. Express your return in decimal form.
 
 For example, a 10 percent return would be 
expressed as 0.10.
 2. Add 1 to your result from Step 1.
 3. Express your term as a number of years.
 
 For example, a 24-month term would be 
expressed as 2; a 6-month term would be 
expressed as 0.5.
 4. Take the inverse of your result from Step 3 
(that is, divide it into 1).
 
 For example, for the 24-month term, it’s 1 ÷ 
2 = 0.5; for the 6-month term, it’s 1 ÷ 0.5 = 2.
 5. Raise your result in Step 2 to the power 
derived in Step 4.
 
 For example, 1.100.5 = 1.049; 1.102 = 1.21. (Tip: 
If you don’t have a financial calculator, you 
can go to www.google.com, and enter 
1.10^0.5 to get the results, and then do the 
same with 1.10^2.)
 6. Subtract 1 from your result in Step 5.
 
 That leaves you with 0.049 and 0.21.
 7. Express your result from Step 6 in percent-
age form.
 
 For example, 0.049 is 4.9 percent; 0.210 is 
21 percent. (Remember: To express some-
thing in percentage form, multiply by 100, or 
just move the decimal point to the right two 
places.)

223
 Chapter 12: Measuring Your Results
Determining the return that’s 
most meaningful to you
In Chapter 2, we fill you in on nominal versus real returns, and time-weighted 
versus dollar-weighted returns. In this chapter, and throughout this book, 
we use nominal returns (returns unadjusted for inflation) unless specifically 
noted otherwise, because nominal returns are, by far, the more conventional 
choice. (Real returns are most commonly used by professional analysts.) 
When it comes to choosing between figuring time-weighted returns or dollar-
weighted returns, you need to make sure you’re using the most appropriate 
measure.
The choice between time-weighting and dollar-weighting comes into play 
because, in real life, your investment situation is probably not as simple as 
the examples we present earlier in this chapter. Why not? Well, for starters, 
your principal may have been contributed in more than one installment. 
And your income may have been received periodically and reinvested along 
the way. The way to accommodate these and other real-life complications 
is to calculate time-weighted or dollar-weighted returns. Which weighting 
scheme you use depends on what you’re really trying to do as you measure 
your return. (If these two weighting schemes are unfamiliar to you, then stop 
here and turn to Chapter 2 before you continue.) In other words, your choice 
should depend on the situation you’re dealing with.
As we summarize in Chapter 2, time-weighted returns are the right choice if 
you want to compare your returns against other external returns, like your 
neighbor’s, or broad index returns that you find in the newspaper. Time-
weighting removes the distortions that can pop up when you make deposits 
into or withdrawals from your investments accounts, so that comparisons 
to other investments are more fair and meaningful. Therefore, when we talk 
about benchmark comparisons later in this chapter, we use time-weighted 
returns.
On the other hand, dollar-weighted returns are the better choice if you want 
a personally customized picture of how your wealth actually changed over 
the term of your investment. In this case, you want to reflect your actual 
deposits and withdrawals, because if you’re just worrying about your own 
investment picture, then deposits and withdrawals aren’t distortions that 
need to be removed. Therefore, when we discuss tracking your progress 
against your long-term plan at the end of this chapter, we use dollar-weighted 
returns.

224
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
Recognizing that making money isn’t 
necessarily the same as doing well
So, your neighbor who told you he made $10,000 certainly made money 
(unless he’s prone to telling fibs, which may explain why he swears he hasn’t 
seen your power washer when his deck is looking sparkly clean). But do 
those $10,000 earnings really mean that he did well?
By considering what we cover earlier, you can express his result as a return 
(you adjust for his principal invested) and not just any return, but CAGR (you 
adjust for his term). That covers the first two of the five key elements we 
introduce at the beginning of this chapter and helps you put his performance 
in proper context.
But it doesn’t go quite far enough. To fully answer the question of whether he 
truly did well, you still have to consider the other three elements — the risk, 
opportunity cost, and suitability of his investment, all of which we turn to in 
the next few pages.
Comparing Your Return to 
Relevant Benchmarks
What if you determine that, over the last five years, the compound annual 
growth rate (see “Coming to terms with term,” earlier in this chapter) for one 
of your investments was 8 percent? It’s always helpful to know your CAGR, 
but should you be satisfied with that performance? Disappointed? If you 
really want to get a feel for how your investment is doing, you need to have 
something relevant to compare your CAGR to.
That’s where benchmark returns come in. A benchmark is a standard by 
which something is measured (for example, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock 
Index is a common benchmark against which to measure the performance 
of stock investments). By comparing your CAGRs to the relevant benchmark 
returns, you can account for risk and opportunity cost, which are two more 
of the five key elements for understanding your investment results.
Knowing which indexes to 
use, and how to use them
So you understand that you have to compare the CAGR of your investments with 
benchmarks if you really want to get a handle on how well those investments 

225
 Chapter 12: Measuring Your Results
are doing for you. That’s easy enough. But which benchmarks do you use for 
comparison, and where do you find those benchmarks?
Selecting and using a benchmark for comparison
Two of the most common benchmarks, published in all the major news-
papers, and widely available online, are
 
✓ The S&P 500 Stock Index: This index tracks the performance of 500 of 
the largest publicly traded companies — these companies are house-
hold names (General Motors, Exxon, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & 
Johnson, and so on) and are sometimes referred to as blue-chip stocks.
 
✓ The Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index: Formerly known as 
the Lehman U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, this index tracks the perfor-
mance of a mixture of corporate bonds, Treasury bonds, and so-called 
agency bonds, such as Government National Mortgage Association 
(GNMA) bonds.
These aren’t the only two indexes for stocks and bonds — not by a long shot 
(see the next paragraph) — but they’re the most widely referenced standards 
and they’ve been around for a long time. They’re reliable indexes, and you 
can benchmark a wide range of portfolios using just these two indexes.
 
Hundreds of benchmark indexes exist, to gauge the performance of all kinds 
of investments. There are benchmark indexes that track all types of equities 
(small cap, mid cap, international, industry sector and subsector, and so on), 
all types of bonds (short term, long term, Treasuries, municipals, and so on), 
as well as real estate, commodities, and so forth. For example, if your portfolio 
is almost exclusively allocated to small-cap equities, you might use the S&P 
SmallCap 600 Index, or some other small-cap index, as the benchmark. But 
our advice is to keep it simple. In the vast majority of cases, just using the two 
major indexes (the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and the S&P 
500 Stock Index) — and, as necessary, blending them together as we describe 
in the next section — is all you need to do to get a respectably representative 
benchmark for your portfolio.
 
When you look up the S&P 500 Stock Index or the Barclays Capital U.S. 
Aggregate Bond Index, make sure you’re looking at their total returns. You 
don’t want just the price return, because that ignores dividends and interest 
income.
If your portfolio is extremely conservative (if it’s almost exclusively allocated 
to fixed-income investments), then you can use the Barclays Capital U.S. 
Aggregate Bond Index directly as your benchmark. Alternatively, if your port-
folio is very aggressive (if it’s allocated almost entirely to equity investments), 
then you can use the S&P 500 Stock Index directly as your benchmark.

226
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
So, if the portfolio you got the 8 percent on at the beginning of this section 
was very aggressive, and, over the same five years, the CAGR of the S&P 500 
Stock Index was 9 percent, you didn’t do so well, did you?
If, like most investors, your portfolio is somewhere between extremely con-
servative and very aggressive, check out “Blending benchmark indexes,” later 
in this chapter.
Understanding why benchmark comparisons 
are useful: Risk and opportunity cost
You can accomplish a lot by comparing an investment’s return to a bench-
mark. By using percentage returns, you adjust for principal amount (an impor-
tant step, as we explain in the “Paying attention to principal” section, earlier 
in this chapter). By calculating CAGRs over the same five-year period, you’ve 
adjusted for term and removed that from the equation as well. (We cover term 
in the “Coming to terms with term” section, earlier in this chapter.)
But what else have you done? By comparing your return to a relevant bench-
mark, you’ve also adjusted for the third and fourth key elements — risk and 
opportunity cost — in one fell swoop.
Risk, as we point out in Chapter 2, is a subjective thing. What’s risky for one 
person may not seem risky at all for another. But however you define risk, 
the risk characteristics of an all-equity portfolio are going to be equivalent 
to the risk characteristics of the S&P 500 Stock Index. So the comparison 
adjusts for risk, whether you define risk as volatility, loss of principal, loss of 
purchasing power, or something else. (In Chapter 2, we discuss ways to mea-
sure your personal definition of risk.)
Opportunity cost represents the result you could’ve gotten for a typical alter-
native investment with similar risk over the same term. Well, that’s what you 
measured with your benchmark index, right? So you’ve adjusted for oppor-
tunity cost, too. Whether your five-year term was a bull market or a bear 
market, or had periods of both, the same conditions also prevailed for your 
benchmark index, so you’ve got it covered.
Blending benchmark indexes
If you’re like most investors, your portfolio isn’t extremely conservative or 
remarkably aggressive. It’s somewhere in the middle. In the “Selecting and 
using a benchmark for comparison” section, earlier in this chapter, we tell 
you about the S&P 500 Stock Index and the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate 
Bond Index, which are useful for comparisons to portfolios that are very 

227
 Chapter 12: Measuring Your Results
heavy on equities (aggressive) or loaded up with fixed income (conserva-
tive), respectively. But if your portfolio is somewhere in the middle, how 
do you choose between those two indexes? The answer: You don’t have to 
choose. You just need to blend them together.
For example, if you have a conservative portfolio but not one that is almost 
exclusively dominated by fixed-income investments, then a very effective 
benchmark for comparison is a 70/30 blend of the Barclays Capital U.S. 
Aggregate Bond Index and the S&P 500 Stock Index. (You use 70 percent of 
the former and 30 percent of the latter.) If the Barclays benchmark return is 
4 percent, and the S&P benchmark return is 10 percent, then a 70/30 blend 
would be 5.8 percent. (Here’s the math: [0.04 × 0.70] + [0.10 × 0.30] = 0.028 + 
0.03 = 0.058, or 5.8 percent.)
For a moderate portfolio, a reasonable benchmark would be a 50/50 (or 
equal) blend of the Barclays and S&P indexes; for an aggressive portfolio, a 
30/70 blend (with the 70 percent weight going to the S&P).
Tracking Your Progress against 
Your Long-Term Plan
The fifth of the five key elements for understanding your investment 
results — and the only one we don’t address elsewhere in this chapter — 
is suitability. The suitability of an investment relates to whether it helps you 
achieve your lifetime financial objectives, and we explain the ins and outs of 
suitability in this section.
Determining suitability with 
a little common sense
You can figure out whether an investment is suitable for you by simply think-
ing about where you are financially and applying a little common sense.
If you’re long retired and you have little money coming in other than Social 
Security benefits and the investment income from your portfolio, then an 
investment that requires you to put a large share of your portfolio in a very 
risky venture with a high expected return but sizeable probability of losing 
your principal clearly isn’t suitable for you. If the investment happens to do 
poorly early on, you don’t have the luxury of a long investment horizon over 

228
Part III: Building and Maintaining Your Portfolio 
which to wait for the investment to earn back its losses. This is true regard-
less of whether the investment beats its benchmark. If the return on your 
investment is negative, it’s no comfort to you to know that its benchmark 
return was more negative still. A suitable investment? Not in our book.
At the other extreme, if you’re in your early 30s and you have a good job with 
great prospects and the likelihood of several decades of high compensation, 
then putting whatever you don’t spend in an extremely conservative invest-
ment with an expected return that may not beat inflation is probably not 
suitable for you. Given your long investment horizon, you have the advantage 
of not being too concerned with short-term volatility. Your main concern 
is making sure that your hard-earned savings do not get eroded by infla-
tion. Therefore, a low-volatility investment, with its associated low expected 
return, doesn’t jibe with your long-term financial plan, regardless of whether 
the investment outperforms its benchmark.
Determining suitability with a 
Lifetime Cash-flow Projection
If you want to figure out the suitability of an investment for you with the most 
accuracy, you need to use your Lifetime Cash-flow Projection (LCP). (You can 
read all about LCPs in Chapter 7.)
The LCP is a big “what if” scenario generator. If you plug an investment into 
your LCP and the results get better (the probability of your assets outliving 
you increases), then the investment is a suitable one for you. If your LCP 
results get worse, then that investment isn’t suitable for you.
You can also use your LCP to gauge the ongoing performance of your port-
folio. Each projected future year of your LCP contains an estimate of your 
portfolio balance at the end of that year. By comparing your actual portfolio 
balances against these projected balances each year, you can get a very good 
reading of how your investments are performing against your long-term plan, 
and whether you’re truly making progress or losing ground. It’s a custom-
ized, meaningful measure of how well your investments are doing for you.
If you haven’t developed an effective LCP, flip back to Chapter 7 and read up 
on how to create one.
As an example, refer to Table 7-6. Say you’re entering the second year since 
this LCP was completed. You would expect to begin Year 2 with approxi-
mately $203,300 in your taxable accounts and $588,500 in your tax-deferred 
accounts, or $791,800 in your combined invested accounts overall. If your 

229
 Chapter 12: Measuring Your Results
actual account balances total that amount or more, you’re doing fine against 
your long-term plan. If not, then you need to understand why. Did your 
living expenses go up more than you expected? Did your compensation not 
increase as you had hoped?
And here’s the key question for this chapter: Did you achieve the investment 
returns you had anticipated? In particular, did you earn the assumed 7 per-
cent per this example?
 
When you compare your actual investment returns against your LCP, use 
dollar-weighted returns.
 
Another name for dollar-weighted return is internal rate of return (IRR). IRR is 
pretty tiresome to calculate on your own, so we advise using a spreadsheet 
program like Microsoft Excel or a financial calculator to crunch the numbers 
for you. Simply enter the dates and amounts of your principal payments, the 
dates and amounts of your income, and the date and amount of the market 
value of your investment at the end of your term, and execute the IRR function 
in your spreadsheet or calculator. Your IRR pops out. Or, you could ask your 
financial advisor (see Chapter 16 if you need one) to do it for you.
If you fell short of your investment goals, per your LCP, in a given year, don’t 
panic. Remember: The LCP takes a long-term average investment return and 
assumes that you’ll get that return each and every year. In some years you’ll 
do better than the long-term average, and in other years you’ll do worse. 
Comparing your return against appropriate benchmark returns each year (as 
we do earlier in this chapter) can help you decide if this was just one of those 
to-be-expected occasional bad years or if you truly underperformed and 
should be concerned.

alternative investments and what they can do for 
your portfolio. We also show you how to gain the kind 
of tax knowledge that separates the experienced investor 
from the novice. You discover how to protect your 
hard-earned gains from taxation — it’s easier than you 
may think. And, finally, we wrap it all up by providing 
guidelines for revisiting your asset allocation and finding 
the right expert help when you need it.

Chapter 13
Walking to the Beat of a Different 
Drum: Opting for Alternative 
Investments
In This Chapter
▶ Getting to know common alternative investments
▶ Understanding how alternatives can improve your portfolio
▶ Deciding if you’re ready for alternatives
F
illing your portfolio with traditional asset classes — cash (and cash 
equivalents), fixed income (bonds and bond funds), and equities (stocks 
and stock funds) is a good start, but it isn’t enough. To truly protect your 
portfolio from downside harm and enhance its long-term performance you 
need to broaden your portfolio’s horizons.
In Chapter 3, we introduce the so-called alternative asset class — assets other 
than cash, bonds, and stocks. In this chapter, we take a closer look at three 
popular subclasses — real estate, commodities, and hedge funds — and 
explore their pros and cons. We also touch on some more esoteric alterna-
tives such as art and collectibles, financial derivatives, structured notes, lim-
ited partnerships, and private equity.
We let you know why adding alternative asset classes — in the right 
proportions — can improve the performance and minimize the risk of 
your portfolio by tapping the power of poor correlation. (Check out 
Chapter 4 for all you need to know about correlation.)
Finally, we give you some guidelines to consider when deciding whether 
you’re ready to take the plunge into alternative investments. Alternatives 
aren’t for the timid. But those investors who take the time to understand 

234
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
them, how they behave, and how they can transform a portfolio for the 
better, will find them, well, quite an asset, indeed.
We examine quite an array of alternative investments in this chapter. Some, 
like real estate and commodities, belong in most every portfolio, in our 
view. Others, like hedge funds, have become quite popular but should be 
approached with great skepticism. Yet others, including fine art and deriva-
tives, should be left to the experts. Our aim in this chapter is to guide you 
through the jungle of nontraditional investments, to make you comfortable 
with some that may scare you away, and to warn you off the rest.
Identifying Investment Alternatives
In this section, we look at the pros and cons of three popular alternative 
asset classes: real estate, commodities, and hedge funds. We briefly expand 
our discussion to more exotic choices: art and collectibles, financial deriva-
tives (forwards, futures, options, and swaps), structured notes, limited part-
nerships, and private equity, which are best suited for, and often restricted 
to, the sophisticated (and well-heeled) investor.
 
We calculate the statistics quoted in this section (returns, correlations, and 
so on) using Brinton Eaton Wealth Advisors analysis of data, compiled using 
Morningstar EnCorr.
Regarding real estate
Perhaps the most popular of the alternative investments is real estate. 
Almost all investors are familiar with this asset class to some degree — after 
all, you have to live somewhere — but investment opportunities in real 
estate are much more varied than the place you live in. If you’re going to 
get involved in investment real estate, you need to understand your options 
and how you can get started with this promising asset class, which can yield 
attractive returns if managed correctly. As the saying goes, “Buy land — 
they’re not making any more of it.”
Residential versus commercial
Many investors with invested assets of any size already own a good chunk 
of real estate through the equity they’ve built up in their own homes. But 
your primary residence, regardless of how much you paid for it or how much 
equity you may have built up, isn’t an investment in our view. It’s a use asset — 
you’re using it instead of holding it primarily for purposes of growth and/or 
income, as you do with a stock or a bond. A car is another common example 
of a use asset.

235
 Chapter 13: Opting for Alternative Investments
Outside of use assets, your portfolio can contain either residential or com-
mercial real estate:
 
✓ Residential real estate: Residential investment properties include apart-
ments, houses, and any other type of real estate that you own but some-
one else occupies. Residential real estate can be as simple as renting the 
room over your garage to your younger brother for a few months or as 
complex as a real estate investment trust (see the following section) that 
manages a few dozen apartment complexes across the country.
 
✓ Commercial real estate: Commercial real estate includes a wide variety 
of options, such as office buildings, warehouses, storage facilities, retail 
malls, and even empty lots.
 
If you choose to own real estate by buying it outright, be prepared for a lot of 
work — or having to pay for other people to do a lot of work. Being a landlord 
can soak up a lot of your time and money. Repairing roofs, plugging plumb-
ing leaks, fixing furnaces — that’s only for those with loads of time and a love 
for that kind of handiwork. Even if you hire it all out, you’ll soon find yourself 
moonlighting as a general contractor, which isn’t all that appealing if you’re 
looking for low-maintenance investment opportunities.
Real estate investment trusts
So how can you invest in real estate but avoid all the hassles associated with 
being a landlord? You can invest in a real-estate investment trust (REIT).
REITs are companies that you can invest in that buy, own, and manage real-
estate properties on behalf of their investors. Most REITs handle properties 
of the type we mention in the preceding section — apartment complexes, 
office buildings, warehouses, storage facilities, retail malls, and so on. Some 
REITs are mortgage REITs, which offer debt financing for residential or 
commercial properties through their investments in mortgages and mort-
gage-backed securities (MBSs). (Check out Chapter 3 for more on mortgage-
backed securities.)
By law, REITs must invest at least 75 percent of their total assets in real 
estate, receive at least 75 percent of their income from the rent of real prop-
erty, and distribute at least 90 percent of their taxable income annually to 
shareholders in the form of dividends.
 
You should consider REITs if you’re seeking the following:
 
✓ Income and long-term growth.
 
✓ A significantly higher dividend yield than other equities.
 
✓ A predictable income stream. (Commercial tenants sign long-term leases 
that rarely default.)

236
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
 
✓ Share price appreciation that beats inflation.
 
✓ An attractive risk/reward balance.
Over the long term, if you lump all types of REITs together, they’ve delivered 
what investors like to call equity-like returns (total annual returns that average 
in excess of 10 percent). Those returns however, can be quite volatile year by 
year. For an example of REIT volatility, take a look at Figure 13-1.

Figure 13-1 shows the volatility of REITs using the National Association 
of Real Estate Investment Trust’s (NAREIT) All REIT Index from the FTSE 
NAREIT Index Series. As you can see, in three of the last five years (2003, 
2004, and 2006), the annual total return exceeded 30 percent! But in 2007, fall-
ing victim to the wide-ranging credit crisis that began that year, the return 
was seriously negative: –18 percent. Since NAREIT began compiling this 
index in 1972, the highest annual return was 49 percent (1976), and the 
lowest was –42 percent (1974). Since 1980, the situation has been a bit more 
stable: the highest return was 38 percent (2003), and the lowest was –19 
percent (1998).

237
 Chapter 13: Opting for Alternative Investments
If that kind of volatility scares you, don’t let it. Volatility in individual assets 
can be great for your portfolio as long as you maintain a low level of volatility 
at the portfolio level. As you can read in detail in Chapter 4, you want assets 
that have:
 
✓ Healthy expected returns over the long haul: Clearly, REITs qualify 
here.
 
✓ Poor or even negative correlation with the other assets in your port-
folio: Although the correlation of REIT returns with equity returns has 
varied over the years from high (over 0.6) to reasonably low (under 
0.25), their correlation with fixed income returns has always been low 
(usually below 0.2, and even negative over some periods). (To read all 
about correlation, check out Chapter 4.)
 
✓ Sizeable volatilities: REITs qualify here as well, as you can see in 
Figure 13-1.
 
Turn to Chapter 4 for a refresher on why this counterintuitive desire for high 
volatility makes sense. In brief, if an asset has the first two properties, then 
high volatility can work to your advantage at the portfolio level, giving you a 
portfolio that has a better expected return and lower volatility than a portfolio 
that lacks the asset. For these reasons, we like to see real estate (in the form 
of REITs) in virtually every portfolio.
If you’re not comfortable picking individual REITs (which require just as 
much research and analysis as picking individual stocks), don’t fret. There 
are a number of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that pack-
age several individual REITs together, so you can get a nicely diversified 
exposure to REITs without too much hassle. You can get the scoop on ETFs 
in Chapter 2, but briefly, ETFs trade throughout the day like a stock and con-
tain a basket of securities like a mutual fund.
 
A few popular REIT ETFs include iShares Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index 
Fund (symbol: IYR), Vanguard REIT ETF (symbol: VNQ), SPDR Dow Jones 
Wilshire REIT ETF (symbol: RWR), and SPDR Dow Jones Wilshire International 
Real Estate (symbol: RWX). 
Harboring hard assets
Most of your portfolio will be made up of financial assets such as stocks and 
bonds, represented by pieces of paper of one sort or another. But your port-
folio doesn’t have to be limited to financial assets. There are other assets, 
called hard assets or commodities, which include such items as oil, gas, 

238
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
metals, textiles, foodstuffs, and livestock. These alternative investments can 
help to provide balance and variety in your portfolio, and in this section we 
let you know about some of the options and how you can capitalize on them.
Commodities
On their own, commodities are inappropriately risky investments for most 
investors. However, when you mix this asset class into your portfolio in the 
right proportion with your other assets, it tends to behave in a way that’s 
counter-cyclical (meaning that commodities zig when other assets zag) to 
those other assets and produces a higher return with less risk over the long 
term. What’s the right proportion for commodities? Turn back a few chap-
ters to Chapter 8 for sample allocations that include commodities and vary 
depending on your style (aggressive or conservative) as an investor.
Commodities are generally a good thing to have in your portfolio because 
they have the three features (described in detail in Chapter 4) that you 
should seek out for all of your assets, as follows:
 
✓ Healthy expected returns over the long haul: Commodities provide 
attractive long-term return potential. They’re like equities in that their 
total returns over many years (using the popular S&P GSCI), a commod-
ity index) average above 10 percent per year. As you can see in Figure 
13-2, the S&P GSCI return has exceeded 30 percent four times in the last 
nine years.
 
✓ Poor or even negative correlation with the other assets in your port-
folio: For example, the correlation of the total return of the S&P GSCI 
with just about all the other common asset classes (bonds, stocks, real 
estate, and so on) has consistently been below 0.2, and has often been 
negative. (Read more about the important concept of correlation in 
Chapter 3.)
 
✓ Sizeable volatilities: Commodities have even more volatility than real 
estate (see “Regarding real estate” earlier in this chapter). Since the 
GSCI came into existence in 1970, its highest annual return was 75 percent 
(1973), and its lowest was –36 percent (1998). Even excluding those two 
extreme years, the range in annual returns was still quite wide, from –32 
percent (2001) to 50 percent (2000).
 
 Sizeable volatilities are desirable only if the asset has the first two 
features. (See “Real estate investment trusts,” earlier in this chapter.)

Commodity investment vehicles
Although, theoretically, you can own hard assets directly, doing so is prob-
lematic. As much as you may like to have your own 10,000-gallon gasoline 
tank in the backyard, gold bullion in your basement, or a herd of cattle 
grazing on the tomatoes in your garden, it probably isn’t practical.
Many large investors own hard assets by purchasing futures, meaning that 
they agree to buy or sell the underlying assets at an agreed-upon date and 
price. (See Chapter 3 for more on futures.) Futures allow the investor’s 
fortunes to rise and fall with the value of the hard asset, without taking 
possession of the asset itself.

240
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
As a practical matter, most individual investors don’t own futures directly; 
they own mutual funds or ETFs or exchange-traded notes (ETNs) that, in 
turn, buy and sell these contracts. You can purchase these investments on 
stock exchanges just like stocks. They’re an easy way for your portfolio to 
enjoy the fruits of a full basket of commodities. (See Chapter 9 for more 
information on ETFs and ETNs.)
Some funds are focused on a particular type of commodity, such as gold. 
Others correspond to a basket of commodities of various types.
 
Unless you’re a commodities expert, you should focus on baskets of 
commodities if you want to incorporate hard assets in your portfolio.
Baskets of commodities are usually based on commodity indices that give 
weights to the different commodities in the index. Two popular commodity 
indices are the S&P GSCI and the Dow Jones–AIG (DJ-AIG) Commodity Index. 
The S&P GSCI has much more weight (over 70 percent in recent years) 
assigned to the energy subcategory (crude oil, natural gas, and so on). The 
DJ-AIG has no more than 33 percent weight assigned to any commodity 
subcategory, and is typically less volatile than the S&P GSCI. Investment 
vehicles that track the S&P GSCI (meaning that the vehicle moves in the same 
direction, by the same amount, at the same time, as the index) include
 
✓ Oppenheimer Commodity Strategy Total Return (symbol: QRAAX), a 
mutual fund
 
✓ iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust (symbol: GSG), an ETF
 
✓ iPath S&P GSCI Total Return Index ETN (symbol: GSP), an ETN
The following investment vehicles track the DJ-AIG:
 
✓ PIMCO Commodity Real Return Strategy (symbol: PCRAX), a mutual fund
 
✓ iPath Dow Jones–AIG Commodity Index ETN (symbol: DJP), an ETN
Holding hedge funds
Hedge funds are private investment vehicles that engage in nontraditional 
strategies to enhance return or reduce risk, or both. (For more on hedge 
funds, check out Chapter 3.) Hedge funds continue to be lightly regulated 
compared to more traditional investments, given their history of catering to 
large and experienced investors who, presumably, can watch out for them-
selves. Their investors are generally required to meet minimum requirements 
regarding income level and net worth, and those minimums can be very high.

241
 Chapter 13: Opting for Alternative Investments
 
Although we encourage you to include real estate and commodities (we cover 
both earlier in this chapter) in your portfolio, we’re less excited about hedge 
funds. They have their place, but you need to do some serious due diligence if 
you want to invest in one, and you need to be prepared to share a big piece of 
your wealth with the hedge-fund manager. For these reasons, and because 
hedge funds appear and disappear from the landscape with great frequency, 
we have no specific hedge funds to recommend.
So why cover hedge funds at all in this chapter? Because although you may 
not be ready to invest in hedge funds immediately, you’ll certainly hear 
about them, and you may want to consider them as an option after you have 
a ton of investment experience under your belt. In this section, we walk you 
through some hedge-fund basics.
Hedge-fund strategies
There are a number of different types of hedge funds, categorized into vari-
ous strategies. No standard terminology for these strategies exists, but here 
are some of the popular strategy terms:
 
✓ Long/short equity: This strategy is for investors who want to make 
simultaneous bets that certain stocks will go up in value and certain 
other stocks will go down. In the vernacular, they go long on the former 
and go short on the latter. Going long usually involves owning the stock 
How big players use futures
How do large investors work with futures? Let’s 
say an airline, concerned about the cost of jet 
fuel over the course of its fiscal year, is looking 
for a solution to price spikes. It fixes this cost at 
a constant value by entering into a futures con-
tract, which guarantees delivery of a specified 
amount of oil, at a specified price, at a given 
time. The futures contract needs a counterparty 
(a party that participates on the other side of a 
financial transaction) to agree and make good 
on the guarantee. In this situation, an oil com-
pany that is equally concerned about the price 
of oil moving in the other direction may agree to 
be the counterparty. As a result, each party has 
hedged its risk.
A futures contract increases in value dollar for 
dollar if the price of oil increases. (Likewise, it 
falls dollar for dollar if oil prices decline.) By 
owning futures, an airline can hedge its expo-
sure to oil prices. (By selling it, the oil company 
can as well.) Because it’s impractical for coun-
terparties to always find each other and agree 
on exact amounts to hedge each and every 
time they need to, a liquid futures market exists 
to facilitate this need. Structured notes serve 
the same purpose as futures contract (see 
“”Exploring more exotic choices,” later in this 
chapter).

242
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
or a call option on the stock. Going short often involves owning a put 
option on the stock or selling shares that you’ve borrowed from a 
broker and don’t yet own. (We discuss options in the “Exploring more 
exotic choices” section, later in this chapter, and in more detail in 
Chapter 9.)
 
✓ Global macro: This strategy entails investing in vehicles that appreciate 
or depreciate depending on the performance of various country econo-
mies and inter-country currency exchange rates.
 
✓ Event driven:
 
• Merger arbitrage: In this strategy, the hedge fund capitalizes on 
the discrepancy between the market prices of two firms that are 
being merged, by simultaneously going long on the stock of the 
firm selling and going short on the firm buying.
 
• Distressed securities: The opportunities for this strategy occur 
when a company is undergoing, or expected to undergo, a bank-
ruptcy or restructuring in an attempt to stay solvent. This strategy 
is usually very risky.
 
✓ Relative value:
 
• Market neutral: In this strategy, the hedge fund exploits perceived 
security pricing anomalies in an attempt to produce stable returns, 
regardless of the direction of the broad market.
 
• Convertible arbitrage: This strategy involves purchasing convert-
ible securities (see Chapter 3) and then subsequently going short 
on the underlying stock (or vice versa).
 
How do you decide among the various hedge-fund strategies? We recommend 
you don’t, unless you’re an experienced investor. If you’re relatively new to 
investing but still want to get in on some hedge funds, funds of funds could be 
a good option for you (see the following section).
Funds of funds
Some investors may want to spread their hedge-fund investments among a 
variety of different strategies. For most investors, this is difficult, given the 
hefty minimum investment that each hedge fund typically requires. Other 
investors may not feel comfortable enough in their investment expertise to 
pursue individual hedge-fund strategies. Luckily, there’s another option that 
can solve both of those problems.
A fund of funds essentially invests in a variety of hedge-fund strategies on 
your behalf. Buying a share of a fund of funds gives you exposure to many dif-
ferent strategies at once, with only a single minimum investment. The choice 
of strategies within each fund of funds is outside of your control (a welcome 
feature for most investors), but different funds of funds offer different mixes 
of different underlying strategies, and you can choose the fund of funds that 
provides you a mix closest to the one you desire.

243
 Chapter 13: Opting for Alternative Investments
 
However, the constancy of this mix within the fund of funds over time is not 
always guaranteed, so you can start out with the type of mix you want — say, 
an emphasis on long/short equity and convertible arbitrage — and end up 
with a fund of funds that’s loaded up with global macro.
Ask your broker or financial advisor for advice on how to go about investing 
in a fund of funds.
Hedge-fund fees
Hedge funds are generally quite expensive, and if you buy them you’re often 
charged with two layers of fees:
 
✓ A flat percentage of assets invested: This percentage is typically 1.5 
percent to 2.5 percent. And that’s already on the high end of most 
mutual-fund fees.
 
✓ A percentage of profits: On top of the flat fee, you’ll also typically be 
charged with a percentage of profits (20 percent is common). A hedge-
fund fee schedule of 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of profits is 
referred to as 2 and 20. The percentage of profits is usually levied on a 
high-water mark basis, meaning that, if the fund loses value, it must 
make up the loss first, before profits are calculated for purposes of fee 
determination.
With funds of funds (see the preceding section), there’s yet another layer of 
fees on top of the two layers we just mentioned. This third layer is another 
percentage of assets levied to compensate the manager who selects and 
monitors the hedge-fund managers for each of the underlying strategies.
The hedge-fund industry has evolved quite a bit over the years. There has 
been explosive growth in the number of funds available, and the minimum 
required investment amounts have come down sharply, but they’re still steep 
for most investors. Some funds of funds have now lowered — yes, lowered — 
their minimums to $25,000. More typical is a minimum of $500,000 to $1 mil-
lion. Clearly, hedge funds aren’t for the average novice investor.
 
The growth and increased availability of hedge funds is a natural response to 
higher demand, but the rising popularity has had troubling ramifications. It’s 
now very easy for unsophisticated investors to venture into investments they 
don’t fully understand, in an area that is still lightly regulated. More funda-
mentally, the substantial increase in the aggregate amounts invested in hedge 
funds means that there is a huge amount of money being spread over a limited 
amount of good ideas. This situation has inevitably led to more and more 
mediocre returns — but the fees have still remained high.

244
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
 
Not only do you need a hefty minimum to open a hedge-fund account, but the 
fund needs to consider you an accredited investor (a financially sophisticated 
investor who isn’t required to receive certain securities filings on your invest-
ments). To be such an investor, as a rule of thumb, you need to earn more 
than $200,000 annually (or have a joint income of $300,000) and a net worth 
exceeding $1 million.
 
Although hedge funds are lightly regulated by the securities industry, there 
are rules and regulations to consider. You can jeopardize the tax-deferred 
status of your individual retirement account (IRA) by using assets from 
alternative investments. Check with your tax advisor before you make any 
decisions. 
Exploring more exotic choices
If you want to expand beyond the three broad types of alternative invest-
ments (real estate, hard assets, and hedge funds), there are yet others to 
consider, though we don’t recommend them for most portfolios. Like hedge 
funds (see the preceding section), we cover these exotic investment choices 
because there’s a very good chance that you’ll read and hear about them, 
and you need to understand the basics.
 
There’s nothing that says you can’t invest in them, if you have the means, 
investment experience, and expertise required.
Art and collectibles
Limited-edition oil paintings or collections of classic cars have value that 
isn’t easily determined, and these types of holdings aren’t very liquid — it’s 
not easy to convert them to cash on short notice. You need a good amount 
of knowledge yourself to invest in such choices, or you need to work with a 
consultant who can provide reliable information.
Derivatives
Derivatives are securities that derive their value from another security. They 
include the following:
 
✓ Forwards: In a forward, two parties agree to sell and purchase a 
particular commodity at specific date in the future. Forwards are similar 
to a futures contract (we discuss futures in the “Commodity investment 
vehicles” section, earlier in this chapter), but they’re not as easily 
transferred or cancelled.
 
✓ Options contracts: Options contracts allow you to call (buy) or put (sell) 
an asset at a fixed price until a specific date. To be successful, you have 
to be right about timing and the valuation of an underlying asset.

245
 Chapter 13: Opting for Alternative Investments
 
✓ Swaps: Swaps involve trading the income stream of one asset (such as a 
bond) for another. This type of derivative is for the ultra-sophisticated 
investor.
Structured notes
Structured notes are debt securities with special features. A structured note 
may be a bond that pays interest based on an index, such as the S&P 500 
Stock Index, instead of paying typical interest payments.
Limited partnerships
A limited partnership is a group of investors in which one or more limited 
partners has a limited liability to the firm’s creditors, meaning that they’re 
liable only to the extent of their investments. The partnerships typically 
pursue unusual investments in the private equity markets (see the following 
section).
Private placements
Also known as private equity, a private placement occurs when an issue of 
debt or equity securities is sold to a single buyer, or a limited number of 
buyers, without a public offering. Generally an investment banker, who acts 
as an agent, brings together the buyer and the seller.
Tapping the Power of Investments 
That Zig when Others Zag
By themselves, real estate, commodities, and the other types of alternative 
investments that we explain in this chapter can scare the heck out of inves-
tors. But, paradoxically, when added to a portfolio in the right proportions 
(see Chapter 4 for the background information and Chapter 8 for some 
sample proportions), they can make a portfolio not only better, but safer. 
This is because these investments, although volatile, have a benign kind of 
volatility. They tend to zig when the more traditional investments zag.
For example, when stocks and bonds decline together, commodities tend to 
increase (and vice versa). But it isn’t enough for an asset to exhibit counter-
cyclical behavior; it must also be able to deliver healthy long-term returns in 
order for it to be worth adding to your portfolio.
As we discuss in detail in Chapter 4, finding assets with this kind of behavior 
is the holy grail of asset allocation. That’s why enlightened investors (and we 
hope you’ll join their ranks!) seek out these assets.

246
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
 
Savvy investors see the value that alternative assets can add to a portfolio — 
making it safer as well as better performing. Less-savvy investors may be 
scared away by the volatility of an alternative asset in isolation. Make sure 
you’re in the former camp!
Take a quick look at Figure 13-3, which examines the combination of REITs 
and stocks. As we mention earlier in this chapter, these two assets are far 
from having perfect negative correlation. (See Chapter 4 for more on correla-
tion.) In fact, they’re positively correlated, but they aren’t perfectly positively 
correlated, so they can actually work quite well together in your portfolio.

Stocks are represented in Figure 13-3 by the S&P 500 Stock Index, and real 
estate is represented by the NAREIT All-REIT Index from the FTSE NAREIT

rate (assuming reinvestment of dividends); risk is calculated as the annual 
standard deviation in the individual annual returns. (Chapter 2 is your source 
for all things risk and return.) The asset labeled “Combined” is a simple port-
folio consisting of a 50/50 allocation to stocks and real estate, rebalanced 
annually. The figure plots each of these three assets on the risk/return map 
we introduce in Chapter 2.

247
 Chapter 13: Opting for Alternative Investments
 
The best assets are those farthest northwest on the map (the assets with high 
return and low risk).
As you can see in this figure, over this 30-year period, stocks achieve a return 
of 13.7 percent and a standard deviation of 16 percent. REITs deliver a 13.4 
percent return and a standard deviation of 24.5 percent. The combination of 
the two results in a return of 14.5 percent and a standard deviation of just 
under 16 percent.
This simple example illustrates the phenomenon that there’s magic in rebal-
ancing. By combining assets with less-than-perfect positive correlation, you 
can get a portfolio with less risk than you would achieve with any one the 
assets alone. More remarkably, by combining these assets (and regularly 
rebalancing), you can get a return for the portfolio that is greater than the 
return for any asset within it! (See Chapter 5 for more on how to create such 
magic.) 
Deciding When to Go Alternative
When should you consider adding alternative investments to your portfolio? 
When you determine you have the stomach to tolerate their unusual behav-
ior and when you know you’ll have the time to ride herd and pay attention to 
them. We discuss those requirements, in turn, in this section.
Hanging on for the alternative 
investment ride
The volatility of alternative investments isn’t for the squeamish or faint of 
heart. It takes a certain internal constitution to dispassionately observe a 
substantial portion of your portfolio lose a significant part of its value, and 
to buy more of the culprit asset when that happens, anticipating that it’ll rise 
again. But that’s what it often takes for alternative investment strategies to 
work.
Paradoxically, your overall portfolio will be quite stable as the strategy 
plays out (if you have the right mix of assets), but the component pieces will 
bounce around erratically. You need to stay focused on the big picture and 
hang on for the ride — and maybe buy a couple of those big rolls of antacid 
tablets.

248
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
Paying enough attention to alternatives
If you’re going to hold alternative investments, you have to be vigilant. The 
volatility of these assets presents opportunities to rebalance at unpredict-
able times. You need to be alert to these opportunities and be ready to jump 
on them when they arise, which requires virtually continual portfolio review.
 
The formula is to look frequently and act opportunistically (see Chapter 5). 
This activity can be quite a burden on the average investor, which is one 
reason why people hire advisors to do the heavy lifting. (For more information 
on how an advisor can help you, turn to Chapter 16.)

t’d be a real shame if you did a great job creating a high-performance 
investment portfolio and ended up giving away a bigger-than-necessary 
chunk of it in income taxes. And it’d be an even bigger shame if you coughed 
up all those taxes for no other reason than poor planning!
Throughout the book, we give you information on the tax aspects of various 
investments and investment accounts, and specific advice on how to mini-
mize the amount of income taxes you’ll ultimately have to pay on your invest-
ments. In this chapter, we expand on all that good advice, give you some 
concrete examples, and help you develop a coordinated, coherent strategy to 
manage your investment-related taxes.
To do that, we look at several ways you can protect your portfolio from 
unnecessary and avoidable tax hits. First, we consider the income-tax impli-
cations of selling securities and tell you what you need to know to be tax-
smart about the process. Then we delve into asset location, a strategy for 
matching the tax characteristics of your individual investments with the tax 
features of the investment accounts you place them in. Those are both great 
defensive maneuvers.
Then we tell you how to go on the offensive. We fill you in on tax-loss har-
vesting, which is a technique that many investors don’t take full advantage 
of. You’re bound to take losses as an investor, but understanding tax-loss 
harvesting will help you to take your losses when it makes the most sense for 
you. In other words, you can improve your portfolio by taking the lemons the 
market sometimes hands you and making lemonade.

250
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
We wrap up our chapter on taxes with a warning against going too far. Yes, 
you can get so carried away and enamored of being tax-smart that you make 
decisions based on tax considerations that are actually investment mistakes. 
Remember: Your true goal is not simply to minimize your taxes, but to maxi-
mize your after-tax results.
 
Throughout the chapter, we focus on federal income taxes. Many states have 
their own income-tax statutes, and these vary considerably from state to state. 
If you live or work in a state that levies income taxes, the strategies we outline 
in this chapter may also help you minimize those taxes as well.
 
In this chapter we give you effective strategies for protecting your assets from 
taxation while you’re allocating them. If you’re looking for a full tax guide, 
though, you’ll want to check out Taxes For Dummies, by Eric Tyson, MBA; 
Margaret A. Munro, EA; and David J. Silverman, EA (Wiley). It’s updated every 
year with the latest tax advice.
Playing It Smart When Selling Securities
Here’s some good news: You have complete control over one of the most 
important events that contributes to the income taxes you pay on your port-
folio. What are those events? The selling of securities.
You don’t incur a tax when you buy a security. You’re taxed to some extent 
on the income (interest and dividends) that your investments generate while 
you hold them, but you don’t have much control over the amount and timing 
of that income. When it comes to selling, however, you’re in the driver’s seat. 
And just like any time you’re behind the wheel, you want to be smart and 
alert. That’s exactly what we help you to do in this section.
Note: We don’t cover tax-advantaged accounts like your IRA or 401(k) in this 
section because nothing that goes on within those accounts — buying, sell-
ing, or receiving income — generates taxes. This section is devoted to tax-
able accounts, but we do cover tax-advantaged accounts later in this chapter, 
in the “Locating Your Assets Properly” section.
Identifying the information you need
Armed with the right information on your securities, you can minimize the 
tax impact of your selling decisions. There are two pieces of information 
about each security you own that you need to have available to make savvy 
selling decisions:

251
 Chapter 14: Managing Your Taxes like a Pro
 
✓ Your cost basis
 
✓ Your purchase date
We discuss both cost basis and purchase date in this section.
Cost basis
Say what you like about the IRS and its minions, but one nice thing about 
them is that they try not to tax you on the same money twice (bless their 
hearts). The cost basis (sometimes called tax basis) of the security you’re 
holding is the amount that the IRS assumes you’ve already paid taxes on. You 
don’t have to pay taxes on that amount again. When you sell the security, 
you then get taxed on only the realized gain, which consists of your proceeds 
(the dollar amount you get from the buyer) less your cost basis.
Clearly the cost basis of your securities is very important in determining 
what you’ll owe the tax man, so it’s important that you know that informa-
tion for every security you own. In some cases, that’s relatively easy. If you 
buy shares of a stock for $20,000 and never buy any more, then your cost 
basis in that stock is forever $20,000. In other words, the IRS assumes that 
you already paid taxes on that $20,000 at some point. This remains your cost 
basis even if the stock splits while you hold it.
 
If the price per share of a stock gets high, the issuing company may declare a 
stock split, which increases the number of shares outstanding by some multi-
ple and simultaneously decreases the share price by the same multiple. In the 
example earlier, if the stock splits two-for-one, you’ll be holding twice the 
number of shares that you held before, at half the price per share on each of 
those shares, but your cost basis remains the same at $20,000.
Other cases can be a bit more complicated. For example, say you purchase 
a mutual fund for $10,000. The IRS assumes that you already paid taxes on 
that $10,000 at some point, and this becomes your cost basis. Now assume 
that you’ve arranged for the mutual fund to automatically reinvest any divi-
dends and distributions back into the fund, which is common. After a while, 
the mutual fund pays you a dividend of $500. You owe income tax on the 
$500 that year, and your new cost basis in the fund becomes $10,500. (If you 
took the $500 dividend and spent it on a gigantic stuffed swordfish instead of 
reinvesting it, then you’d still owe tax on the money, but it wouldn’t be added 
to your cost basis because it’s no longer part of your investment.) Later, the 
mutual fund makes a capital-gain distribution of $1,000 (see Chapter 9 for 
a description of capital gain distributions — one of the features that distin-
guishes mutual funds from exchange-traded funds) and that gets reinvested, 
too. You owe income tax on the $1,000 that year, and now your cost basis 
increases to $11,500. Finally, you sell your shares in the mutual fund for 
$15,000. What is your gain? And what do you owe taxes on?

252
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
Here it’s important to distinguish between your investment gain and your 
taxable gain. Your investment gain is simply how much money you made on 
your original outlay. You originally invested $10,000 in a mutual fund and 
sold it for $15,000, making your investment gain $5,000. Your taxable gain is 
how much of that gain you’ll be paying taxes on. You already paid taxes on 
$11,500 of your investment. Therefore, your taxable gain will only be $3,500 
($15,000 proceeds less $11,500 cost basis). If you aren’t paying attention to 
your cost basis and assumed it was just your initial investment of $10,000, 
then you’d be paying taxes on the entire $5,000 investment gain — and on the 
$1,500 piece of it twice!
Keeping track of the cost basis of every security can be quite tedious. 
Fortunately, most brokers do that for you, for the securities that you pur-
chase with them. If you transfer securities from one broker to another, you 
need to make sure that the new broker records the correct cost basis for you.
 
Brokers can help with your record-keeping, but it’s your responsibility to post 
the correct cost basis on your tax return in the year that you make the sale.
 
If you decide to do your own record-keeping on the cost bases of your invest-
ments, personal account management software such as Quicken and Microsoft 
Money can help you. These programs are particularly useful if you have multi-
ple brokers or have changed brokers often.
Purchase date
It may sound simple, but knowing the date when you purchased a security 
is extremely important information. Here’s why: The way the U.S. tax system 
is currently structured, gains on securities you hold for one year or less are 
considered short-term gains and get taxed at your marginal ordinary income-
tax rate (the tax rate associated with your tax bracket), which can be fairly 
high. Securities that are held for one year plus one day get taxed at the long-
term capital gains rate, which for most people is quite a bit lower.
As an example, you may have a security you’d like to sell that you happened 
to buy 11
1⁄2 months ago when its market value was considerably lower. One 
simple strategy for reducing taxes is to hold onto that security a little while 
longer until it qualifies as being held long term. Doing this will likely result in 
materially lowering the amount you pay in taxes on the sale — perhaps by 
half or more, depending on your tax bracket. That’s not chump change.
Keeping track of purchase dates can be tedious, just as keeping track of the 
cost basis of every security you own can be. Here again, most brokers can 
help with your record-keeping, as can the software applications we mention 
in the preceding section.

253
 Chapter 14: Managing Your Taxes like a Pro
Figuring the tax implications 
of your transactions
If you know the cost basis and purchase date of your securities, you can 
determine how much income tax you’ll be paying if you decide to sell. One 
area in which this is particularly useful is deciding which securities to sell 
when you rebalance your portfolio. (Rebalancing is a critical part of the asset 
allocation process, so if you need to brush up, turn to Chapters 5 and 11.)
For example, in Table 14-1, you can see three securities, their cost bases, 
their current values, and their purchase dates. (Each security is a representa-
tive of the energy equity sector.) Say that you own these securities, and when 
it comes time to rebalance your portfolio you figure out that you need to trim 
your energy holdings. Which security should you sell?

If you think all the securities in Table 14-1 are equally good investments with 
similar forecasts for future growth, then you should sell shares of security B. 
Because B’s cost basis is greater than its current value, you’ll have a tax loss, 
which you can later apply to your advantage. (Check out the “Harvesting Tax 
Losses” section in this chapter for all the details on how that works.)
What if you really weren’t indifferent among all three securities? What if 
you really wanted to hold onto Security B, but you were willing to let go of 
Security A or Security C? Selling Security A would result in a gain of $3,000, 
while selling Security C would result in a gain of $2,000. You may think that 
selling Security C would, therefore, have the lower tax impact. However, note 
that Security C was bought only six months ago, so its gains would be taxed 
at your marginal ordinary income tax rate, which we assume is 25 percent in 
this example. The resulting tax would, therefore, be $500 (25 percent of your 
$2,000 gain). Security A was bought well over a year ago, so its gains would 
be taxed at the long-term capital gains rate of 15 percent; the resulting tax 

254
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
would be $450 (15 percent of $3,000). So, in this case, selling Security A is the 
better strategy. If your marginal ordinary income tax rate is greater than 25 
percent, then the advantage is that much bigger.
 
It’s not what you make, but what you keep that matters. By using the cost 
basis, date of purchase, and knowledge of your tax rates, you can execute 
trades that will accomplish your asset allocation goals while minimizing the 
tax impact. Doing so will save you some money in the short term and could 
save you quite a bit in the long term, if you’re always mindful of it.
Locating Your Assets Properly
Of all the strategies at your disposal that can minimize taxes without sacrific-
ing returns, locating your assets in the most appropriate accounts will have 
the longest-lasting impact. Other strategies that we discuss (such as the 
considerations for selling securities that we explain in the previous section) 
concern one-time events. However, if you buy an asset in a less-than-optimal 
account, you’ll be paying extra taxes every year that you hold it. Asset loca-
tion (see Chapter 10) can really help you hang onto your returns.
In this section, we fill you in on the details of asset location, and we illustrate 
its impact with a detailed example.
Understanding tax-advantaged accounts
There are two general types of accounts you can own: those that are tax 
advantaged and those that aren’t. A tax-advantaged account is typically a 
retirement account such as a 401(k), IRA, or Roth IRA (see Chapter 10 for 
the tax features of these accounts). The beauty of these accounts is the 
tax-deferred growth they allow you. That means you don’t pay any taxes on 
the growth or income you receive from the investments that are in these 
accounts (even if you sell securities at a gain), until you withdraw the money 
from the accounts. (With a Roth IRA, you don’t pay taxes at withdrawal 
either!)
If an account isn’t tax-advantaged, then you have to pay taxes every year 
on any income you receive from any investments that are housed in that 
account. If you sell a security at a gain, you owe taxes on that, too. With all 
these opportunities for the IRS to tax your investments, you can see how 
making clever choices about where you locate your money can help you 
greatly increase the amount you’re able to keep. For a detailed example of 
what we’re talking about, read on.

 Chapter 14: Managing Your Taxes like a Pro
Considering an asset location example
Even with tax-advantaged accounts, you’ll need to pay taxes on the growth of 
your investment eventually (when you withdraw it). So does it really matter 
if you pay those taxes every year versus only when you withdraw? You bet it 
does! To understand why, take a look at Tables 14-2 and 14-3.

The pre-tax growth in Table 14-3 is $286,968. Upon withdrawal, the 25 percent 
tax would be $71,742, leaving an after-tax growth of $215,226. So, there is a 
$36,972 benefit to tax-deferred growth (the difference between $215,226 and 
$178,254).
To really grasp all the numbers in Tables 14-2 and 14-3, start by assuming 
that you want to invest $100,000 in real estate investment trusts (REITs), 
which are a great portfolio diversifier but a notoriously tax-inefficient invest-
ment. (As we explain in Chapter 10, we consider REITs tax-inefficient because 
a REIT must distribute at least 90 percent of its income to shareholders, and 
this income is taxed at your marginal ordinary income tax rate.) Here are 
a few other assumptions you can make for the purposes of Tables 14-2 and 
14-3, just to keep the example simple (all these assumptions are taken into 
account in the tables):

257
 Chapter 14: Managing Your Taxes like a Pro
 
✓ Your marginal tax rate is 25 percent.
 
✓ The annual income from the REIT is 7 percent of its value at the begin-
ning of each year.
 
✓ You reinvest this income (less the taxes you owe on that income) in that 
year.
 
✓ Your time horizon is 20 years.
In Table 14-2, the investment was made in a taxable account; in Table 14-3, 
the investment was made in an IRA, which is tax advantaged. After the 
20-year period, we compare the after-tax amount of the growth of the port-
folio (the final balance less the $100,000 initial investment) under both sce-
narios. In order to make a fair comparison, we assume that the amount of 
the growth in the IRA is completely withdrawn and so is decreased by your 
marginal tax rate.
As you can see, if you bought the REITs in your IRA instead of your taxable 
account, you’d have almost $37,000 extra in your pocket just because of 
that one-time decision you made 20 years earlier. And the difference could 
be even greater if your returns are higher, your marginal ordinary income 
tax bracket is higher, and your time horizon is longer. Capitalizing on tax-
deferred growth really can help you hang onto thousands of dollars.
In addition to REITs, there are other tax-inefficient investments you should be 
aware of, including the following:
 
✓ Commodity funds: These can generate a lot of highly taxable income.
 
✓ Mutual funds: Mutual funds can create capital gains distributions; some 
of these distributions may be considered short term and, therefore, sub-
ject to your higher ordinary income tax rate. Furthermore, you have no 
control over the timing and may get a large distribution in a year when 
it’s important for you to lower your taxable income.
 
✓ Bonds and bond funds: These allow you some flexibility. Their tax 
nature depends on what kind you buy. For example, in a tax-advantaged 
fund you can purchase highly taxable corporate bonds without tax con-
cerns. If you want to hold bonds in a non-tax-advantaged account and 
you’re in a high tax bracket, go for municipal bonds, which are tax-free.
Some assets actually have tax benefits that would be squandered in a tax-
advantaged account. Here are a couple examples:
 
✓ International stocks: These stocks may cause you to pay a foreign tax, 
regardless of the type of account they’re held in. This tax appears as 
a deduction on your account so you don’t have to worry about filing 
foreign tax returns. If the international stock is housed in a non-tax-
advantaged account, then you can claim the foreign tax you paid as a 
credit on your U.S. tax return. This credit is lost if you hold the stock in 
a tax-advantaged account.

258
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
 
✓ Growth stocks: When growth stocks do what you hope they’ll do (grow 
in market value, without necessarily paying dividends), and then you 
sell them at least a year after you purchase them, the growth is taxed at 
the long-term capital-gains tax rate — if you hold the stocks in a taxable 
account. If you hold them in a tax-deferred account, then that growth 
will eventually be taxed at your marginal ordinary income tax rate, 
which can be double the long-term rate. This difference often outweighs 
the benefit of tax-deferred growth inside the tax-advantaged account. So, 
which account is the better home for a growth stock? It depends on how 
the stock grows and how often it’s sold.
 
 This doesn’t imply that you should never hold growth stocks in an IRA 
or 401(k). But if you do have a choice, it’s usually wise to push more of 
the growth stocks into the non-tax-advantaged accounts.
Harvesting Tax Losses
If you’re faced with an investment that decreases in value, you can use that 
tax loss to your advantage. You just have to be alert to the opportunities. 
This is called tax-loss harvesting. We touch on this strategy in Chapter 11 and 
expand on it for you in this section. Here, we also show you how you can 
structure your portfolio to make these opportunities easier to exploit.
Tax losses are handy things. They can be used to offset any taxable capital 
gains you may have for the year on your other transactions. If your total 
tax losses are greater than your total taxable gains, then you can use up to 
$3,000 of your excess capital losses to offset ordinary income, such as your 
wages. And there’s more: Any tax losses not used up in a given tax year can 
be carried forward, meaning that you can apply them against gains and (to 
an extent) income in future tax years. Tax losses are versatile and useful, so 
keep your eyes out for opportunities to snag them when you can.
Staying alert to tax-loss opportunities
Of course, the first step to taking advantage of losses is to notice that you 
have them. The market value of the securities in your accounts, and whether 
you have a gain or loss, should be available online daily through your broker. 
Checking for tax losses should be part of your regular investment mainte-
nance routine and should be done frequently.
 
With tax-loss harvesting, be sure to keep the size of the loss in mind. You’ll be 
paying two transaction costs when you harvest — one to sell the security and 
one to buy a replacement. Make sure that the loss is large enough to offer you 
a tax benefit that makes the transaction worthwhile. For example, the advisors 
at Brinton Eaton like to see a tax loss of at least $2,000 in a security before 
they consider harvesting.

259
 Chapter 14: Managing Your Taxes like a Pro
Using exchange-traded fund 
swaps to harvest tax losses
Say you have an asset that you think has great long-term potential, but has 
temporarily decreased in value, to the point where its market value is now 
below its cost basis. In other words, it’s sitting in an unrealized loss position. 
If it’s in a taxable account, then it’s possible to take (realize) the loss, get the 
tax benefit for it, and still get in on the future growth of the asset.
For example, suppose you have $100,000 invested in the healthcare equity 
sector, and your entire investment there is in a healthcare ETF offered by 
ETF Vendor A. But then the ETF’s value drops to $95,000. You still think 
that healthcare is a great sector to be in with strong long-term potential 
for growth, so you don’t really want to get out of the healthcare sector, but 
you’d like to take that $5,000 loss to offset other taxable gains you’ve realized 
during the year.
This situation is ripe for some tax-loss harvesting. How does it work? It’s 
pretty simple, really: You sell your healthcare ETF, and then you get to claim 
the $5,000 loss on your tax return. You simultaneously buy another health-
care ETF, one from ETF Vendor B. Each ETF tracks a different, but similar, 
healthcare sector index. As a result, the two ETFs behave almost identically, 
so from an asset allocation standpoint, you haven’t changed a thing (but you 
have improved your situation for tax time).
 
In order to keep your asset allocation unchanged when tax-loss harvesting, it’s 
important to buy a replacement security that’s as similar as possible to the 
security you just sold. This is one benefit to mutual funds and ETFs over indi-
vidual stocks. For each of the main asset classes, subclasses, and sectors we 
discuss in this book, there are several ETFs and mutual funds that behave 
practically identically. Finding a replacement can be much more difficult if the 
security is a stock because there’s a lot of variation in how different stocks 
behave, even if the companies are in the same business. This is one reason 
that any sector you want to invest in should have a base or working layer of 
an ETF or mutual fund (see Chapter 11).
Keeping clean when it 
comes to wash sales
 
When you participate in tax-loss harvesting, be sure that you don’t sell and 
buy back the same security within 30 days. This is called a wash sale, and tax 
losses that you rack up with wash sales aren’t allowed on your tax return. So 
all the work you’d do to sell and buy those securities would be, well, a wash.

260
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
If you were to sell and then buy back the same healthcare ETF too soon, then 
that $5,000 loss we talked about earlier would be considered part of a wash 
sale and the loss wouldn’t be allowed on your tax return. But the two ETFs 
we just described are considered distinct for tax purposes, so the transac-
tion isn’t considered a wash sale. This isn’t an aggressive, underhanded bit 
of skullduggery either — the tax benefit of swapping ETFs in this manner is a 
feature touted quite publicly by ETF vendors, so don’t feel bad about taking 
advantage of it.
Of course, you can always avoid a wash sale by waiting more than 30 days to 
buy back a security, but the ETF-swapping strategy we describe doesn’t leave 
you light in that asset class for those 30 days.
Tax Sensitivity: Good in Small Doses
You can use several techniques to minimize the negative effects of taxes on 
your investments. But don’t get carried away and find yourself making all 
your investment decisions based on tax ramifications. It may sound crazy, 
but each of the strategies we cover in this chapter should be disregarded if 
there are compelling investment reasons to do so.
 
Remind yourself often: “Don’t let the tax tail wag the investment dog.”
The only way to eliminate taxes completely is to not have any taxable income 
or gains. That’s a steep price to pay just to frustrate the tax man. (The phrase 
cutting off your nose to spite your face comes to mind.)
 
When it comes to taxes, your goal is to maximize your after-tax return, not 
minimize your taxes.
For a basic example of what we mean, consider the case of municipal bonds 
(see Chapters 3 and 9). When it comes to taxes, municipal bonds are pretty 
appealing compared to other types of bonds, but their yields are also typi-
cally lower. Buying municipal bond funds may result in your not having to 
pay taxes on the interest income you make on the bonds, but is the lower 
yield worth it? In order to make that decision, you need to know how much 
you’d earn on the municipal bonds, how much you’d earn on alternative 
taxable bonds, and the tax rate you’d pay on the income from each of those 
bonds. You can’t just see that the tax implications are lighter with munis and 
jump right in based on that criteria alone.
 
Generally, the lower yields on municipal bonds are more beneficial for inves-
tors in high tax brackets. If you’re in a lower tax bracket, you may do better by 
buying taxable bonds and bond funds.

261
 Chapter 14: Managing Your Taxes like a Pro
Want another example of how you need to consider a wide variety of 
factors — not just taxes — when making your investment decisions? Look 
back at Table 14-1 with the three energy securities, and at the example we go 
through in the “Figuring the tax implications of your transactions” section. 
What if you don’t think that all three securities in the table have the same 
prospects? What if you think that Security C, which has the short-term gain, 
is on shaky ground? You’ve already owned the security for six months, so if 
you wanted to wait for it to become long term, you’d have to wait another six 
months — and in that time, the price may take a tumble or may not grow as 
fast as the rest of the sector. Better to take a short-term gain now than a 
long-term loss later!
 
Take care of your asset allocation first, and then figure out your asset location.
If your asset allocation calls for a certain dollar amount in REITs, commodity 
funds, or mutual funds (all of which are tax-inefficient investments), don’t 
cut that amount short simply because your tax-advantaged accounts are 
too small to accommodate them all. As we detail in Chapter 10, fill your tax-
advantaged accounts with these types of investments to the extent you can, 
and then put any excess in your taxable accounts. Likewise, there’s no need 
to cut back on the amount of growth stocks or international stocks to fit the 
size of your taxable accounts.
By using the strategies we describe in this chapter — but not getting car-
ried away with them — you’ll minimize the income taxes you’ll have to pay 
without damaging your investment performance. In other words, you’ll maxi-
mize your after-tax results, and that’ll leave you with a much more appealing 
return for all your hard work and careful planning.

Chapter 15
Knowing When to Revise 
Your Plan
In This Chapter
▶ Revisiting your asset allocation as you move through life
▶ Keeping tabs on the economy
T
his book is all about determining and maintaining your long-term, stra-
tegic asset allocation. So after you’ve done all the work necessary to set 
up your asset allocation, why would you revise it? Simple: Things change. 
Inevitably, fundamental changes during your lifetime will require you to 
revisit the assumptions you made when you first set up your allocation.
Some of those changes are gradual and expected, such as aging. Others 
may be sudden and unexpected, such as job changes, divorce, or economic 
upheavals. Whatever the cause, sometimes prudence will demand that you 
take another look at your asset allocation. You may not revise it as a result — 
you may simply validate your earlier decisions — but it’s healthy to periodi-
cally raise the question.
 
We’re not talking about market timing here; we never recommend that danger-
ous investment method. The changes that should prompt you to review (and 
perhaps revise) your asset allocation have nothing to do with the state of the 
financial markets themselves. They represent either lasting changes to your 
lifestyle or fundamental shifts in the overall economy.
In this chapter, we take a look at some of the events that should trigger you 
to evaluate your asset allocation, so you’ll know when it’s time to review and 
decide if some changes are necessary. We also consider the changing invest-
ing lives of a fictional couple, the Does, for you to use as an example when 
you face similar circumstances in your own life.

264
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
Identifying Life Events That 
Should Trigger a Review
There are two general categories of changes that may prompt you to revisit 
your asset allocation plan: life events that are specific to you and your family 
(including gradual life changes and sudden life changes), and events that are 
tied to the economic environment around you. In this section, we cover the 
former. (For more on the latter, turn to “Keeping Your Eye on the Economy,” 
later in this chapter.)
 
In each of these cases, the first step in revisiting your asset allocation is to go 
back to your Lifetime Cash-flow Projection (LCP), which we outline as part of 
the financial planning exercise in Chapter 7.
Gradual life changes
Some of life’s changes are gradual and expected. Surprisingly, it can be easy 
to push these changes to the backburner because they happen so slowly, 
over time. Be sure that you don’t let too much time go by before reviewing 
whether your asset allocation is still appropriate.
Aging
One thing we all have in common as long as we live is that we get older every 
day. Even though aging happens slowly, you need to think about this life 
change and how it relates to your asset allocation.
As we discuss in Chapters 6 and 8, the asset allocation for a 30-year-old 
should probably be different from an 80-year-old’s. Why? For one thing, the 
30-year-old’s investment horizon is presumably much longer. If you’re 30 
years old now, you will (if you’re lucky) eventually be an 80-year-old. If you 
never revisit your asset allocation in the interim, you’ll likely end up with an 
inappropriate asset allocation in your old age. You need to revisit your asset 
allocation during that span — but how often, and when?
There aren’t any hard and fast rules about when and how often you should 
revise your asset allocation as you age. But if more than four years go by 
without your reviewing your allocation, you’re probably due.
 
Plan to revisit your asset allocation at least once every four years as you get 
older. If you need a way to help yourself remember, tie your allocation review 
to an event that takes place every four years, like the presidential election or 
the start of the Summer Olympic Games. When you make your quadrennial 
review, take the time to sit down and update the financial planning exercise 
we explain in Chapter 7.

265
 Chapter 15: Knowing When to Revise Your Plan
You may have heard of the following rule of thumb: “The percentage of equi-
ties in your portfolio should equal 100 minus your age.” As rules of thumb go, 
that’s not a bad one. But just like all one-size-fits-all rules, it doesn’t reflect 
your unique situation. There’s really no substitute for periodically reviewing 
your own asset allocation strategy.
 
Changes to any of the parameters you set when you established your allocation 
(investment horizon, return objectives, risk tolerance, portfolio constraints, 
tax situation, or special considerations, which we outline in Chapter 6) should 
trigger an asset allocation review.
Deteriorating health
Another fact of life that we all encounter as time goes on is the continual 
wearing down of our bodies. Try as we might to slow down the process, 
we’re ultimately no match for the forces of nature doing gradual damage to 
all our various moving parts. This has several implications for your financial 
planning and, thus, for your asset allocation.
Changes to your body and your physical situation mean changes to your life-
style. And the cost of your lifestyle is probably the single most important ele-
ment in the LCP that we outline in Chapter 7. (If you haven’t checked out the 
LCP discussion, we highly recommend it!)
Declining health also increases the degree — and, therefore, the cost — of 
healthcare, medications, and preventive maintenance. Making matters worse 
is the fact that the cost of medical care tends to rise faster than the cost of 
just about anything else (see Chapter 7).
As you factor these changes into your LCP, you’ll find out whether changes to 
your asset allocation are indicated.
Sudden life changes
You can see the gradual changes we describe earlier in this chapter coming 
from miles away, but other changes pop up and hit you when you may least 
expect it. We cover a few of these in this section. In each case, a return trip to 
your LCP is in order. And changes in your LCP may indicate changes in your 
asset allocation.
Birth
There’s probably no event as profound and life-changing as the birth of a 
child. We’re not just talking about diaper changes and 2 a.m. feedings. We’re 
talking about the financial avalanche of costs, and the disruption in family 
dynamics that all come with the words “I’m pregnant!”

266
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
A new child, particularly a first child, requires a complete rethinking of the 
lifestyle you once lived. In addition to the direct costs of caring, feeding, and 
(eventually) educating, the blessed event may also necessitate a change in 
career for at least one of the parents. All this may shake your LCP to its very 
foundations — more than enough reason for a return visit to your LCP and 
asset allocation (maybe in the wee hours when you can’t get back to sleep 
after making your third trip of the night to the crib).
It doesn’t have to be your own child that generates this kind of reevaluation. 
A new grandchild (or even a niece or nephew) may also make you rethink 
who your nest egg is ultimately destined for — and that may influence your 
investment horizon, and, ultimately, your asset allocation as you reconsider 
the parameters we outline in Chapter 6.
Death
At the other end of life’s continuum, the death of a loved one is a tragic event. 
The loss of a spouse can be especially life altering. The premature death of a 
bread-winning spouse can be devastating. Such events should prompt you to 
rethink your financial plan.
 
Unfortunately, the asset allocation review that should be triggered by a death 
comes at a time when you may be emotionally ill equipped to deal with it. And 
it’s a sad fact that some unscrupulous vultures with financial credentials see 
an opportunity to prey on the vulnerable widow or widower in these situa-
tions. In such times, a trusted and sensitive advisor of long standing can be a 
valuable asset. Many families, particularly those in which the financially savvy 
family member has the shortest life expectancy, engage a financial advisor of 
the type we review in Chapter 16, in anticipation of the inevitable.
Sometimes death can result in a positive change to your financial well-being. 
You may be the beneficiary of an estate or a life-insurance policy. In any 
event, the passing of someone close to you should trigger a revisiting of the 
assumptions you made when you established your investment strategy.
Marriage
Love and marriage these days may not come with an old-fashioned horse and 
carriage, but a marriage certainly comes with a carriage full of costs and obli-
gations. There are significant changes in lifestyle, of course (neighborhood 
barbecues instead of singles bars, for example). There’s also a subtle, but 
very real, increase in investment horizon.

267
 Chapter 15: Knowing When to Revise Your Plan
Looking into the perplexing world of probabilities
Take any two people. Assume for each of them 
that the probability of surviving past 90 is 10 per-
cent. What’s the probability that at least one of 
them will survive past 90? The answer is sur-
prising. Why? First, consider that there are only 
four possibilities for the situation, as follows:
 ✓ Both people survive. The probability of this 
is 0.10 × 0.10, or 0.01 (1 percent).
 ✓ Person A survives, Person B doesn’t. The 
probability of this is 0.10 × 0.90, or 0.09 (9 
percent).
 ✓ Person B survives, Person A doesn’t. The 
probability of this is the same as in the pre-
ceding situation (9 percent).
 ✓ Neither person survives. The probability of 
this is 0.90 × 0.90, or 0.81 (81 percent).
Even though it may not be obvious, the probabil-
ity of at least one of the people surviving is the 
sum of the first three cases, or 19 percent.
There are two reasons for this lengthened horizon:
 
✓ If the probability of each of two people surviving past age 90 is 10 percent, 
the probability of at least one of them surviving past 90 is 19 percent. 
(We explain this surprising result in the nearby sidebar, “Looking into 
the perplexing world of probabilities.”) It follows, then, that two people 
sharing an investment portfolio have a longer investment horizon than 
either one owning the portfolio alone.
 
✓ Some extra longevity in married couples is reported to be because of the 
nurturing effect of the other spouse.
Your own marriage is just the beginning. The marriage of your children 
should be an occasion you plan for financially well in advance, but it almost 
always seems to be more sudden and expensive than you were prepared for.
Divorce
On the flip side of marriage, divorce comes with its own set of baggage. Aside 
from the emotional stress, there’s alimony, child support, and the equitable 
distribution of the assets that you’ve built up together — considerations no 
matter which side of the ledger you’re on.

268
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
Divorced partners are also targets for the financial vultures we call your 
attention to in the “Death” section, earlier. And it doesn’t have to be your 
own divorce that affects you. A divorced child of yours may end up coming 
back home to live with you for a time. What should you do if a divorce affects 
your life? You guessed it — reevaluate your LCP (and your asset allocation).
Sudden illness
Although the immediate and direct costs of an unexpected illness may be 
covered (at least in part) by health, disability, or long-term-care insurance, 
indirect costs and potentially long-lasting lifestyle changes can also befall 
you or your family. Your illness may not be life threatening, but it could 
permanently impair your ability to pursue the lifestyle you’re accustomed to. 
If you’re young, it could devastate your full earning potential. If you’re married, 
the healthy spouse may have to devote substantial time to care-giving and 
make career sacrifices in the process.
It could be that the illness, while sudden and severe, is fleeting and fully 
insured. Well, you’ve dodged a bullet there, but it should still motivate you to 
review your financial plan if you haven’t done so recently.
Job changes, unexpected dilemmas, and windfalls
Career paths are often full of road bumps. Job losses, career changes, corpo-
rate downsizings, company bankruptcies, and the like are part of the journey 
for many employees. Some employers may offer generous severance pack-
ages, and some states extend unemployment benefits, but these things are 
extras — not givens. But it’s not all bad news. You may be the beneficiary of 
an unexpected promotion or a fantastic new job offer.
Outside of your job, you may face financial hardships such as uninsured 
damage to (or outright loss of) your home due to hurricane, earthquake, or 
another natural disaster. Or you may be the grand winner of your state’s lottery. 
And, of course, there are myriad possibilities between these extremes.
In all these cases, remember to reconsider your overall financial plan, and, 
ultimately, your asset allocation.
Keeping Your Eye on the Economy
The second major category of change that may prompt you to revisit your 
asset allocation plan has less to do with your own personal situation and 
more to do with the economic environment around you. As we mention ear-
lier, the first step in revisiting your asset allocation is to go back to your LCP, 
which we outline as part of the financial planning exercise in Chapter 7.

269
 Chapter 15: Knowing When to Revise Your Plan
Recognizing major economic shifts
This isn’t your grandfather’s economy. For one thing, the economy is a lot 
more global than it used to be. The world is defined less by a series of iso-
lated countries and more and more by an integrated network of international 
trading partners. This seems to be an irreversible trend, and there are 
several ramifications of this trend.
One consequence is that international equity markets are behaving more 
like the U.S. market. This is true of both developed countries and emerging 
markets. So international equities aren’t the portfolio diversifier they used to 
be. In fact, investing internationally has become more of a play on currency 
exchange rates than anything. The only thing you get with foreign equities 
that you don’t get with domestic equities is the opportunity to bet against 
the dollar. That’s because, all else being equal, international investments 
will do better than their U.S. counterparts if the dollar weakens against those 
foreign currencies. 
And that brings us to the second major effect of globalization. As emerging 
economies, such as China and India, continue to benefit from the energy and 
talent of their massive populations, their embracing of capitalist ideals, their 
own natural resources, and the free flow of information and education, they’ll 
inevitably take a bigger role on the world stage. The reign of the United States 
as the world’s leading economy isn’t permanently guaranteed. Protecting 
yourself against a falling dollar over the long term in this environment seems 
sound, doesn’t it? For this reason alone, your asset allocation should have 
some room for international investments.
 
You need to pay attention to the strength of the dollar whenever you revisit 
your asset allocation. If the dollar has consistently declined since your last 
review, and if most experts are calling for that trend to continue, then you 
should consider increasing your allocation to international investments.
Just as important as recognizing these fundamental economic shifts is the 
ability to discern the pseudo trends. For example, in the late 1990s, there was 
considerable talk of the “new economy,” led by high-tech startups with no 
profits — no revenue, even — and no viable business model in any conven-
tional sense. This eventually resulted in the irrational exuberance of the tech 
bubble. Those investors who bought into the vision of the new economy and 
adjusted their asset allocation to embrace a large dose of technology stocks 
ended up badly burned. When it comes to the things that you let shape your 
financial future, it’s important to distinguish between the faddish and the fun-
damental.

270
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
Paying attention to the business cycle
On a less grandiose scale than long-term global economic change is the 
periodic cycling of the U.S. economy, as well as other countries’ economies. 
Economies all around the world have alternating periods of expansion and 
contraction, recession and recovery, boom and bust.
Predicting the turning points of the business cycle (also called the economic 
cycle) is difficult, but you can pretty easily tell what phase of the cycle you’re 
in when you’re in it. For example, even though recessions aren’t officially 
called by the government until a couple quarters after they’ve begun, you can 
tell what’s going on just by paying attention to the news. If all you hear and 
read is about increasing unemployment, declining sales, company failures, 
government rescue efforts, and the like, then it’s a good bet the economy is 
in its contraction phase, regardless of whether it’s officially called a recession.
Investors have historically done well by tilting their asset allocation in rec-
ognition of the current phase of the business cycle, because different assets 
perform well at different points in the cycle. To better understand what we 
mean, have a look at Figure 15-1, which shows the cumulative total returns 
for a number of sectors over the time periods August 1990 through March 
1991 and April 2001 through November 2001.
As you can see in Figure 15-1, equity industry sectors such as healthcare 
and consumer staples — the so-called defensive sectors, because they’re well 
defended against economic downturns — tend to do well in recessionary 
economies. On the flip side, consumer discretionary and industrial sectors — 
the cyclical sectors — tend to benefit more than other sectors in periods 
of recovery. Because each phase of the business cycle can last for several 
years, the consideration of the phase we’re in is a legitimate factor in review-
ing and potentially revising your strategic asset allocation.
In Chapter 8, we discuss how the professional money managers develop 
their asset allocations. What they would do in the situation we describe here 
is to adjust their expected returns for the various industry sectors, in sync 
with the current economic phase. (This is just one input to the mathematical 
models they use to determine their asset allocations. We go through their 
analysis in more detail in Chapter 8.) But you don’t have to be a pro, and imi-
tate all their analyses, to be successful. You can do almost as well by making 
reasonable tweaks to your asset allocation directly, based on alertly reading 
the economic signs around you.
 
Don’t rush to adjust your asset allocation every time some talking head on TV 
says that we’re headed for the end of days. Instead, wait until reputable, even-
handed news sources report substantive economic news in a factual and 
objective way.

When you do get reliable news that we’ve entered a new phase of the 
business cycle, don’t wreak havoc on your carefully planned asset alloca-
tion. Don’t, for example, decide to flee stocks and rush to bonds when the 
economy slows. Like all market-timing tactics, that’s a loser’s game. Instead, 
simply fine-tune your sub-allocations within your broad asset classes along 
the lines we describe earlier in this chapter. For example, you can tilt toward 
consumer staples and away from consumer discretionary for a year or so 
during contractions, while keeping your overall equity allocation intact.

272
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
Knowing the economic indicators
Federal agencies that track the economy peri-
odically release updates on economic indica-
tors, which are statistics that provide some 
insight to changes in various sectors of the 
economy. Here are a few of the most closely 
watched:
 ✓ Gross domestic product (GDP): The GDP 
is the widest measure on the state of the 
economy, sizing up all the goods and ser-
vices produced in the economy within U.S. 
geographic borders in the previous quarter. 
Focus on the growth rate, which over long 
periods increases 2.5 percent to 3 percent 
per year. Growth above this range means 
that the economy is overheating, and 
the Fed will probably try to tamp it down 
by raising interest rates. Growth below 
this rate — and especially below zero — 
signals that the economy is slowing down, 
which can trigger more unemployment and 
less spending.
 ✓ Consumer Price Index (CPI): The CPI is the 
most widely used measure of inflation, and 
it measures the change in the cost of about 
200 kinds of consumer goods and services 
and thousands of actual products. Social 
Security payments are adjusted annually 
as the CPI changes. (Make sure you read 
the report you want — there’s one report 
for overall CPI data, and one for the “core” 
rate, which excludes food and energy 
prices. For more information, go to www.
bls.gov/cpi.)
 ✓ The Producer Price Index (PPI): The PPI, 
the second most important indicator of 
inflation, measures the price of goods at 
the wholesale level. The PPI measures the 
cost of goods in three stages: crude (raw 
materials), intermediate (materials that 
are part of a larger product), and finished 
(goods sold to a reseller). The measure on 
finished goods is the most closely watched, 
because it reflects the actual price that 
consumers will pay.
 ✓ Employment indicators: These indicators 
calculate how much of the workforce is 
unemployed, how many new jobs were 
created, how many average hours were 
worked per week, and how much average 
hourly earnings added up to. In addition, 
there’s also a weekly report on the number 
of people filing for unemployment benefits 
for the first time, which helps take the pulse 
of the job market.
 ✓ Consumer Confidence Index (CCI): How 
confident consumers feel directly influ-
ences the state of the economy and con-
sumer spending power, which is why this 
monthly report of 5,000 households issued 
by the Conference Board is considered a 
leading indicator.
 ✓ Beige Book: Eight times a year, the Federal 
Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the 
Federal Reserve publishes its notorious little 
Beige Book, which is a summary of the eco-
nomic conditions in each Fed region around 
the country. But the book’s real value is as 
an indicator of how the Fed may act at its 
next meeting.
 
Financial news changes quickly. Don’t overreact and adjust your portfolio’s 
asset allocation every time headlines change.

273
 Chapter 15: Knowing When to Revise Your Plan
 
You can also check out the economic indicators for yourself. Economic fore-
casters do, because they believe indicators change in advance of, at the same 
time as, or in the wake of important shifts in the economy. There are several 
popular indicators, and we summarize a few of the top ones in the “Knowing 
the economic indicators” sidebar in this chapter. We include these because 
you’ll probably hear about them and you may want to know what they are. But 
don’t try to use them to directly figure out what the markets will do. First, 
these are indicators of the economy, not the markets, and the markets don’t 
move in lockstep with the economy. Second, even the professional economic 
forecasters get the forecasts wrong on a regular basis. (As the old joke goes: 
“Why did God create economists? To make weather forecasters look good.” Of 
course, some of our good friends are economists, so we’ll stop there.)
Considering a Lifetime’s 
Worth of Examples
The best way to understand how the changes we discuss in this chapter can 
require a review of your asset allocation is to look at an example. In this sec-
tion, we look in on the lives of fictional couple John and Jane Doe in stages, 
and describe the many changes in their lives and in the economy that trigger 
them to make modifications (or not) to their portfolio’s asset allocation. You 
may find some of their responses to the changes we discuss earlier in this 
chapter insightful, as you consider the changes affecting your own situation.
When we look at the Does’ asset allocation in Chapter 8, we actually catch 
them in midlife, in their late 40s. But in this chapter, we hit the Rewind button 
before showing you the home movie of their lives, back to when they first got 
serious about asset allocation.
Stage 1: Married 30-something parents
In the first stage of John and Jane Does’ lives that we look at, the two of them 
are in their mid-30s. Both are in the early years of successful careers. The 
Does have only one child, Joanne, and she’s in mid-adolescence. They decide 
to adopt an aggressive investment strategy, given their long investment hori-
zon and desire to stay well ahead of inflation. (They had already pre-funded 
Joanne’s college tuition through a separate 529 plan. The investments we talk 
about here constitute the rest of the family’s invested assets.)
Their asset allocation at this point in their lives is shown as Stage 1 in Table 
15-1, which shows you the asset allocations for all four stages of the Does’ 
lives. (We get to the other stages in the following sections.)

The aggressiveness of the Does’ portfolio in Table 15-1 is reflected in the 
heavy allocation to equities and the light allocation to fixed income. (We dis-
cuss this mix further in Chapter 8.)
Stage 2: Stay-at-home Jane and 
a hiccup in the economy
By the time we catch up with the Does about a dozen years later, several 
things have happened. Jane has decided to interrupt her career to stay at 
home and help Joanne through what turned out to be rough teenage years. 
Now in their late 40s, with a shorter investment horizon, only one income to 
rely on, and a more modest lifestyle, the Does decide to dial down the aggres-
siveness of their portfolio just a tad, to the moderate/aggressive levels we see 
in Stage 2 of Table 15-1. (This is, in fact, a summarized version of the asset 
allocation that we show for the Does in Chapter 8.)
In the period leading up to Stage 2, the economy suffered a major correc-
tion. (Some doomsayers on TV at the time were calling for the next Great 
Depression.) While their neighbors were pulling their money out of the mar-
kets and going to cash, the Does stayed with their aggressive investment 
strategy and did much better than anyone on their block.
 
Their subsequent decision to downshift to a moderate/aggressive posture at 
the beginning of Stage 2 was based purely on the changes to their personal sit-
uation, not on the doom-and-gloom reports they saw on TV.

275
 Chapter 15: Knowing When to Revise Your Plan
Stage 3: Failing health and 
an unexpected windfall
In the third stage, the Does are in their mid-50s. Joanne has matured into a 
wonderful student, has graduated with high honors, and has now started a 
very promising career of her own. John and Jane never have to worry about 
supporting Joanne — in fact, Joanne thinks they’ve done more than enough 
for her already and never again wants to be a burden to her parents. (We 
should all be so lucky!)
Meanwhile, Jane decided to reenter the workforce, but not at her old job. 
She opted to pursue a passion of hers and start a new business, which took 
off immediately. She sold it at a huge profit just a few years later and started 
working as a consultant.
But not all is well in the family. John suffered a severely debilitating illness, 
and he’s no longer able to work. Although his medical expenses are fully cov-
ered for the rest of his life, the Does’ lifestyle was permanently curtailed — 
for example, they can’t travel the way they used to. Because of these new cir-
cumstances, the Does decided to invest their portfolio, which now includes 
the windfall from Jane’s business, in a portfolio that’s much more conser-
vative than they ever had before. After all, they’ve done well and accumu-
lated abundant assets, and all of a sudden they’re spending less than they 
expected to at this point in their lives. They figure, “Why take chances we 
don’t need to take with our investments?”
This brings them to Stage 3 in Table 15-1. As you can see, the allocation to 
equities continues to get lighter, and the allocation to fixed income continues 
to get heavier.
Stage 4: A grand gesture 
for the grandchild
In Stage 4 of the Does’ lives, John and Jane are in their mid-60s. John’s condi-
tion hasn’t improved, and Jane’s health has deteriorated, but they still enjoy 
each other’s company and their stay-at-home lifestyle immensely. Against all 
expectations, and after years of trying, Joanne and her husband (Did we forget 
to tell you she married and paid for her own wedding? What a kid!) had a child, 
Jonathan. The doctor called Jonathan a miracle, given Joanne’s age at the time. 
Jonathan is clearly the only grandchild John and Jane will ever have.

276
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
Well, to say they were elated would be the understatement of the year. The 
Does make the decision that if they have anything to do with it, Jonathan will 
never want for a single thing. In fact, John and Jane have a serious talk, admit 
to each other for the first time that, although their life together was more 
than satisfying, their life expectancies may be shorter than their own parents’ 
were, and they decide right then and there that they’re going to focus their 
investments for their grandson. After all, they already have enough assets 
and insurance to cover their needs for the rest of their years. They call their 
advisor, tell her that their investment horizon has just lengthened by about 
70 years, and have her switch their portfolio to aggressive. Stage 4 for the 
Does looks a lot like Stage 1 (refer to Table 15-1).
 
We don’t describe every single detail in the lives of the Does, but rest assured 
that when they were faced with major life events, they took a good hard look 
at their LCP and asset allocation. Your situation probably isn’t like the Does’ 
in its details, but follow their lead, review your asset allocation when your life 
calls for it, and your portfolio (and your life) will be richer as a result.

Finding Help When You Need It
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing the right and wrong reasons to hire a professional advisor
▶ Deciding on the best type of advisor for your needs
▶ Asking a potential advisor the important questions
▶ Understanding how advisors are paid
M
aybe you’re overwhelmed at the thought of keeping up with your 
portfolio of investments on your own. Maybe you’re afraid you’ll 
make silly mistakes doing it all yourself. Or maybe you just want an expert 
to bounce ideas off of as you manage your assets. If you’re thinking of hiring 
a professional advisor, you’re not alone. The financial services industry is 
growing — fast! — because many people want the help of an expert.
Before you rush out and make an appointment with the first financial guru 
you find in the phonebook or your best friend’s “money guy,” you need to 
figure out what you’re hoping to get out of your relationship with an advi-
sor. There are good reasons and not-so-good reasons for hiring someone to 
help with your asset allocation, and you need to make sure you’re doing it for 
the right reasons. The top reason for bringing on an advisor is to help you 
achieve your investment goals. (You can read more about goal setting and 
developing an investment plan in Chapters 6 and 7.)
When you’re clear that your head is in the right place, you need to be able 
to wade through the dozens of financial certifications out there. Think we’re 
exaggerating? Believe it or not, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority 
(FINRA), a self-regulatory body for securities firms and registered securities 
representatives doing business in the United States, keeps track of this kind 
of stuff, and it has a database of over a hundred financial certifications!
So how are you supposed to know what all those acronyms mean? In this 
chapter, we fill you in on the kind of expertise you may need in an advisor, 
the handful of meaningful credentials you should look for (the rest you can 
ignore), and what kinds of questions to ask an advisor you’re thinking of 
working with.

278
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
Finally, as with all experts, financial advisors come at a price. For many 
investors, the price is worth it, but in order to know whether that’s true for 
you, you need to know the costs involved, and what you can expect to pay. 
We also tell you about other parties that may be paying your advisor and, 
therefore, competing with you for his allegiance.
Knowing the Right (and Wrong) 
Reasons to Hire an Advisor
If you’re thinking about hiring an advisor to help you create, fine-tune, or 
implement your investment strategy, you’re not alone. Many individuals seek 
the help of an investment specialist in hopes of getting the most possible 
bang for their buck.
Before you bring on an advisor, though, you need to make sure you have 
your priorities straight. There are good and bad reasons that drive people 
to hire advisors, and you need to be sure that you’re looking for help for the 
right reasons.
In this section, we guide you through all the right reasons to hire an advisor, 
and alert you to a few of the wrong reasons that can do you more harm than 
good in the long run.
The right reasons
Before you begin shopping for an advisor, take a few minutes to think 
through your motivations for considering an advisor in the first place. Then, 
read the following sections to see how they match up with how you’re feel-
ing. If these reasons sound familiar to you, then you’re on the right track and 
we can wholeheartedly support your search for an advisor’s assistance.
To provide objective advice
Investing can be an emotional experience, and emotions sometimes lead 
investors astray, tempting them to act impulsively or even irrationally. 
Working with an advisor helps balance subjective behavior with objective 
advice. By taking as much emotion out of the process as possible and put-
ting together an investment plan that suits your particular needs, you stand 
a good chance of avoiding the herd as it falls off a cliff every time the market 
runs into problems.

279
 Chapter 16: Finding Help When You Need It
To avoid amateur mistakes
Amateur investors are often long on enthusiasm and optimism but short on 
expertise. A professional advisor can inject some know-how into your invest-
ment strategies and help you dodge the bullets that fell many new investors, 
such as buying tax-exempt bonds in a tax-deferred account (a major mistake) 
or misinterpreting a stock split.
To help you design and execute your written plan
You may know exactly what you want in a plan, but you’re having trouble 
crunching the numbers or just getting it down in writing — a seasoned advi-
sor can help you firm up and clarify your investment plan. Or you may know 
what you want to invest in but prefer a professional’s help to buy and sell 
securities — to take care of the nuts and bolts of your transactions. Both are 
signs that you can wisely recognize your shortcomings and realize that you 
need professional help to bridge those gaps.
To put all the pieces together
Some individual investors have the time, interest, and know-how to handle 
their own taxes, their own investments, or even their own long-term financial 
planning. But very few can do it all and fully understand all the interactions 
among these varied activities. There are complex relationships between 
investing and income tax planning, for example, or asset management and 
estate-tax planning. Many people make bad decisions — despite their best 
intentions — when they have to do it all without the help of a professional 
who knows and understands all the moving parts.
The wrong reasons
Think you’re considering calling on an advisor for help for all the right rea-
sons? In this case, it’s much better (and more profitable) to be safe than 
sorry, so consider the following lousy reasons to hire an advisor before 
making any decisions.
To “beat the market”
Most advisors who tout their stock-picking ability fail to beat the market 
averages over even the intermediate term. Those who outperform in a given 
year usually underperform in the years following. As the brochures are 
required to say, “Past performance is no guarantee of future results.” Take 
that observation to heart, and don’t hire an advisor just because he assures 
you that he’s a market miracle maker.

280
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
To avoid making the important decisions yourself
It’s okay to hand over the inner workings of managing your investment plan 
to an advisor, after you’ve done the important work of defining your goals 
and assessing your risk. But it’s not okay to hand over the task — lock, stock, 
and barrel — to anyone.
If you want to reach retirement comfortably, you don’t want an advisor who’s 
going to gamble with your money and indulge in market timing, or put your 
money in risky investments. You can’t always rely on the kindness of strang-
ers — especially when it comes to your money.
Weighing Your Options for an Advisor
When you’ve decided that a financial advisor may be a good option for you, 
you’re faced with a phone book full of people claiming to have the skills to do 
the job. How can you tell which person to trust? How do you know you won’t 
be taken to the cleaners and hung out to dry?
You may be referred to an advisor by a friend, relative, colleague, or business 
acquaintance, or by a trusted expert in a related field, such as your estate 
attorney. Even in these cases, you need to be able to determine if the advisor 
is right for you.
Information is power, and in this section we help you build some serious 
strength. Here you find out which professional designations (the letters that 
appear after an advisor’s name) really matter, and what kind of expertise you 
need in an advisor.
A flip of the coin
One of our favorite stories, popularized by 
Warren Buffett, relates to a fictional National 
Coin Flipping Contest. According to one version 
of this story, 4 million people put up a dollar 
each to enter the contest. Each person flips a 
coin, calls heads or tails, and proceeds to the 
next round if the call was correct or goes home 
if it was not.
After the first round, approximately 2 million 
participants remain; after the second round, 1 
million. After 20 rounds, the contest is over and 
the four remaining participants win $1 million 
each. And wouldn’t you know it, three of them 
write books that explain how you can use their 
foolproof investing methods to turn $1 into $1 
million. One of them lands a TV show dispensing 
her advice.
The moral? Don’t be fooled by people who con-
fuse dumb luck with real expertise.

 Chapter 16: Finding Help When You Need It
Making sense of all those letters 
after an advisor’s name
When you’re looking for a financial advisor, you’ll come across a slew of acro-
nyms after each advisor’s name. Those acronyms stand for the qualifications 
and training an advisor has. You may be tempted to ignore the letters — or, 
worse, assume that the more letters, the better. But it’s worth your time to 
pay attention to them and find out what they mean.
Today, brokerage firms and their staffs can offer investment advice to cli-
ents, but, strictly speaking, they aren’t investment advisors. The government 
regulators in charge of investment advisors consider investment advice to be 
“incidental” to what these professionals do, which is mostly buying and sell-
ing securities. That doesn’t mean that employees of brokerage firms operate 
unchecked — they are, indeed, regulated as securities personnel — but, tech-
nically, they aren’t investment advisors.
Debates like these have been raging in Washington, D.C., for a while, and that 
isn’t likely to change, but your task is clear: Figure out what kind of help you 
need, and choose the advisor with the proper designations to get the job 
done. To make that task easier, in this section we provide a list of the most 
important designations. And, because it’s possible for unscrupulous individu-
als to claim designations that they haven’t really earned, we also tell you how 
you can contact respected trade groups or regulatory bodies that can verify 
a person or firm’s designations.
 
You want an advisor who has the right licenses and registrations to meet your 
financial needs. Plus, the advisor’s certifications must be current and valid, 
and he should have a clean disciplinary history. Don’t just rely on the advi-
sor’s word — check for all that information with the issuing organization.
For help with taxes or financial planning
In this section, we tell you the major designations you should look for when 
you’re searching for financial planning help, including tax planning.
CFP
For financial planning advice, the most widely regarded designation is 
Certified Financial Planner (CFP). In addition to satisfying demanding experi-
ence and education requirements, certificants must pass a 10-hour, 2-day 
exam, and complete 30 hours of continuing education every 2 years. To verify 
credentials, contact the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, 1425 
K St. NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20005 (phone: 800-487-1497 or 202-379-
2200; e-mail: mail@CFPBoard.org; Web: www.cfp.net/search).

282
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
There are two top financial planning membership organizations. Members 
of either organization hold the CFP designation, and you can contact these 
groups to find names of planners in your area.
 
✓ Financial Planning Association (FPA): You can write to the FPA at 
4100 E. Mississippi Ave., Suite 400, Denver, CO 80246, or at 1600 K St. 
NW, Suite 201, Washington, DC 20006. For more information, visit www.
fpanet.org or call 800-322-4237. You can e-mail the FPA by visiting the 
Web site and clicking the Contact Us link.
 
✓ National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA): You can 
write to the NAPFA at 3250 N. Arlington Heights Rd., Suite 109, Arlington 
Heights, IL 60004. For more information, visit www.napfa.org, call 847-
483-5400, or e-mail info@napfa.org.
CPA
If you need help with income or tax planning, you want a Certified Public 
Accountant (CPA). To check credentials and verify that an accountant is a 
CPA, contact the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy, which 
qualifies CPAs in the state in which they practice, or click on State Board 
Listing at www.nasba.org. You can write to them at 150 Fourth Ave. N., 
Suite 700, Nashville, TN 37219, call 615-880-4200, or e-mail communications@
nasba.org.
CPA/PFS
Another top choice for a planner is a CPA with a Personal Financial Specialist 
(PFS) designation. To gain this designation, a CPA must accumulate at least 
1,400 hours of financial planning business experience and take continuing 
education courses. To search for a CPA/PFS near you, contact the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which issues the PFS designation, at 
220 Leigh Farm Rd., Durham, NC 27707 (phone: 888-777-7077 or 919-402-4500; 
Web: http://pfp.aicpa.org).
For help with investments
There are three major sets of initials to be aware of when you’re searching 
for investment help.
CFA
Wall Street securities analysts, as well as financial advisors, seek the top 
professional designation of Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), widely consid-
ered to have the most rigorous qualification standards for investment advice. 
Candidates must have four years of professional experience making invest-
ment decisions, after passing three exams administered by the CFA Institute. 
To verify an advisor’s CFA charter, check with the CFA Institute at 560 Ray 
C. Hunt Dr., Charlottesville, VA 22903 (phone: 800-247-8132 or 434-951-5499; 
e-mail: info@cfainstitute.org; Web: www.cfainstitute.org).

283
 Chapter 16: Finding Help When You Need It
RIA
 
Although the term Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) can be bestowed on 
an individual, it is most often applied to an entire firm, and the appropriate 
professionals within the firm are referred to as Investment Advisor 
Representatives (IARs).
RIAs are regulated by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and those regula-
tions are enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or by 
the individual states. Advisors (whether individuals or firms) with assets 
under management of $25 million or greater must register with the SEC; those 
with assets less than $25 million have the option of registering with their 
state. In the registration process, passing the Series 65 exam administered 
by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) is 
required. This requirement can be waived if the advisor has one of the fol-
lowing designations: CFP, CFA, CPA/PFS, or Chartered Financial Consultant 
(ChFC).
 
By law, RIAs have a fiduciary responsibility, meaning that they’re legally 
required to act in your best interest.
To check that an RIA firm or advisor is properly registered, and for any 
disciplinary history, consult one of these two sources, depending on the size 
of the company:
 
✓ For investment advisors and their firms with assets above $25 million, 
check with the SEC at 100 F St. NE, Washington, DC 20549 (phone: 
202-942-7040; Web: www.sec.gov). The SEC is the federal agency that 
licenses securities professionals and enforces regulations for advisors 
and firms with more than $25 million in assets.
 
✓ For investment advisors and their firms with assets under $25 million, 
consult NASAA at 750 First St. NE, Suite 1140, Washington, DC 20002 
(phone: 202-737-0900; Web: www.nasaa.org). The NASAA is an orga-
nization of state securities regulators that supervises securities profes-
sionals and firms with assets under $25 million, in the state where the 
advisor has his principal place of business.
RR
You may also see the Registered Representative (RR) designation after an 
advisor’s name. An RR is limited to buying and selling securities for a broker-
age firm. In order to earn that designation, she must pass a securities exam. 
Sometimes these advisors are referred to informally as stockbrokers or 
Investment Advisor Representatives, and their firms as broker-dealers.
To verify an RR’s credentials and disciplinary history, contact either:
 
✓ FINRA, 1735 K St., Washington, DC 20006 (phone: 301-590-6500; Web: 
www.finra.org)

284
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
 
✓ NASAA, 750 First St. NE, Suite 1140, Washington, DC 20002 (phone: 202-
737-0900; Web: www.nasaa.org)
 
Use FINRA’s BrokerCheck service to check records online (www.finra.org/
InvestorInformation/InvestorProtection/ChecktheBackground
ofYourInvestmentProfessional/index.htm) or by phone at 800-289-
9999. The information dates back only three years, so if you’re interested in a 
more comprehensive look, contact NASAA.
Knowing what kind of expertise you need
Many financial planners can give you investment advice, but not all 
investment advisors can help you put together a detailed plan to reach your 
specific goals.
To figure out which type of advisor best suits your needs, consider the 
following questions:
 
✓ Do you want someone to look over your shoulder and give advice 
about investments, but leave the task of managing your portfolio to 
you, or someone else? If so, then you want a financial or investment 
advisor who charges by the hour or on a per-project basis. These 
experts may have the CFP, CPA/PFS, or CFA designation. (We decipher 
these designations and serve up a piping-hot bowl of advisor alphabet 
soup in the preceding section.)
 
✓ Have you already received the advice you need, and do you have a 
specific, narrowly defined need to buy or sell securities? If so, you’re 
looking for a broker/dealer, stockbroker, or registered rep (RR).
 
✓ Do you need help with your income-tax return, or ways to minimize 
your income taxes, gift taxes, or estate taxes? If so, then a CPA is a 
good choice.
 
✓ Do you have your investments and taxes under control, but you’re 
looking for help in developing a comprehensive and detailed plan 
to reach multiple goals (such as buying a home, saving for your chil-
dren’s education, and planning for retirement)? If so, you’re seeking 
a comprehensive financial planner. Relevant designations here include 
CFP and CPA/PFS.
 
✓ Do you want an advisor who can do all the above in an integrated 
way — in other words, to be your one-stop financial quarterback? You 
need a full-service wealth-management firm. The firm should be an RIA; 
employ a collection of experts with qualifications such as CFP, CFA, and 
CPA/PFS; and have a contractual relationship with an asset custodian 
that employs RRs.

285
 Chapter 16: Finding Help When You Need It
Asking the Right Questions
After you come up with a list of potential investment advisors, you need to 
interview and evaluate them. Plan on meeting with several advisors (three is 
a good number; more can be confusing). If possible, meet with them face-to-
face in their offices.
Before you go to the trouble of arranging meetings, check each advisor’s 
history for any violations or disciplinary actions with the state and federal 
agencies or industry organizations that issue credentials and certifications. 
(See “Making sense of all those letters after an advisor’s name,” earlier in this 
chapter to read all about professional designations for investment advisors 
and where you can check up on an advisor’s credentials and history.)
Fool me once, shame on me
The nice young insurance salesman seemed to 
have her best interests in mind. Before the free 
dinner seminar, he had the 71-year-old retiree 
fill out a detailed questionnaire and list her 
investments. That way, he said, he could give 
her the best advice possible on how to maxi-
mize her money.
His advice did maximize her money — for 
himself! He invested the retiree’s life savings 
of $700,000 in two annuities (a type of invest-
ment that pays a stream of income in return 
for a premium payment). Annuities are popular 
choices with unsophisticated investors, and the 
equity-indexed annuities the salesman sold her 
had complicated conditions. She could earn big 
returns, as the salesman promised — but she 
could suffer big losses, because this type of 
annuity was tied to a volatile stock index.
Unless she was willing to pay a penalty of as 
much as $175,000, her money was locked up for 
15 years before she could transfer to a more 
suitable investment. Sadly, too, the nice young 
man who had won her trust by introducing 
himself as a “Certified Senior Advisor” had a 
history of defrauding investors.
The vast majority of investments are held by 
those over 55, but there’s a lesson for all inves-
tors in this financial tragedy: If this investor had 
read the prospectus, she would have learned 
that this type of annuity wasn’t right for her at 
all; she could suffer double-digit losses, and pay 
a high penalty if she cancelled early. Had she 
done her homework, she would have known 
that there are more rigorous designations than 
“Certified Senior Advisor,” which requires only 
a three-day, self-study course. Stiff education 
and examination requirements, strong ethical 
standards, and substantial continuing-educa-
tion obligations distinguish the top designa-
tions. Also, if she had checked out the advisor’s 
background, she would have learned that state 
and federal securities regulators had disci-
plined him and his firm several times for unethi-
cal behavior.
Regulators will pursue and penalize offend-
ers, but they may be able to retrieve only part 
of what you invested, and the process may 
take years. To avoid becoming the next statis-
tic among the thousands who get duped every 
year, learn how to protect yourself by choosing 
a reputable advisor.

286
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
 
You may be tempted to skip the due diligence when selecting an investment 
advisor, but don’t give in to temptation! Checking an advisor’s record for any 
problems with regulators or other investors before doing business with that 
person is critically important. If you work with an unregistered securities 
broker or an unregistered firm that goes out of business, there may be little 
that regulators can do to recover your money.
If you’re working with a brokerage firm or one of its stockbrokers (an RR), 
check with FINRA or the appropriate state regulator through the NASAA 
network. (Both are explained earlier, in the “RR” section.)
If the advisor or her firm is an RIA, get a copy of the advisor or firm’s Form 
ADV, which qualifies the advisor to give investment advice. There are two 
parts to the Form ADV. Part I reveals whether the firm or any of its advisors 
has been fined for violating securities or other laws, and it’s kept on file with 
the SEC (www.sec.gov). Part II discloses the advisor or firm’s fees and any 
conflicts of interest the advisor may have. Part II is available from the 
advisory firm.
When you’re reviewing Form ADVs, pay close attention to the following:
 
✓ Credentials
 
✓ Regulatory discipline
 
✓ Fee schedule
 
✓ Conflicts of interest
It’s important to read both parts of the advisor’s ADV. If you have any 
questions about what you see on the form, raise those questions during your 
meeting.
 
If you get a high-pressure sales pitch during your interview, or you feel 
uncomfortable for any reason, don’t hesitate to thank the person for his time 
and get up and leave. You need a financial advisor who doesn’t pressure you 
with “get-rich-quick” schemes, who respects you, and who is happy to answer 
your questions.
 
Here are the questions you should ask of every financial advisor you meet 
with:
 
✓ Can you tell me about your experience as an advisor? Find out where 
he’s worked and for how long. You don’t want a novice; you need some-
one who has worked with clients for at least three years.

287
 Chapter 16: Finding Help When You Need It
 
✓ What experience do you have working with an investor like me? The 
advisor or her firm may have certain conditions that don’t suit your 
needs. Some advisors, for example, may not be able to develop the com-
prehensive plan you’re seeking. Others may prefer to offer advice only 
in specific areas, such as taxes or estate planning. Others may work only 
with certain types of clients, such as corporate executives or high-net-
worth clients (those with assets of $1 million or more).
 
✓ What are your qualifications and training? You should already know 
the advisor’s certifications (see the preceding sections). Your interview 
is an opportunity to have him expand on this information in person.
 
✓ What services can you offer me? Depending on what you need, the 
answer may be, “I can advise you about buying and selling stocks, 
bonds, and mutual funds,” “We can buy and sell securities for you,” “I 
can help you develop a financial plan for retirement and your children’s 
education,” “We can help you minimize your income or estate taxes,” or 
“My firm can do it all for you.”
 
 A firm that can do it all is not necessarily better than an advisor who 
only handles certain tasks, as long as what the advisor handles is what 
you need.
 
✓ Will you be handling my account? You want to know who you’ll be 
working with; your initial meeting at a large firm may be with a market-
ing representative you may never see again. Ask her to talk about and 
introduce you to everyone on the team who will handle your money and 
tell you how often you’ll meet with each of these people.
 
✓ Will the responsibility for implementing your advice be mine or 
yours? Some firms only offer advice and leave the implementation to 
you. Some have discretionary arrangements (meaning, they’ll implement 
buy and sell decisions on your behalf); this is much less work for you, of 
course, but you’ll have to be comfortable delegating that level of 
control.
 
✓ What kinds of reports will I receive, and how often? You’ll want to 
receive reports at least quarterly from any firm handling your invest-
ments. These reports should include the current market value of each 
holding in your portfolio, realized and unrealized taxable gains, and per-
formance statistics, along with industry-wide benchmarks against which 
to compare your performance.
 
✓ Will you put your services in writing? Many firms never get asked this 
question, because they routinely put their agreements in writing, spell-
ing out expectations and obligations of both parties. But you may have 
to ask. Either way, save this information in your files.

288
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
 
✓ If I become a client, how long am I locked in? How easy is it to fire 
you? You want to be able to fire your advisor at your pleasure and have 
the unearned portion of any prepaid fees returned to you. Be wary of 
contracts that obligate you to stay with, and pay, the advisor for some 
minimum period of time.
 
✓ How are you paid? What are all your sources of income? You want 
objective advice from an advisor, and knowing how an advisor’s bread is 
buttered will disclose any potential conflicts of interest in recommend-
ing an investment or offering advice. Before hiring a financial advisor, 
understand how and by whom she is paid, and get the information in 
writing. (See the following section for more on how advisors are paid.)
 
✓ Have you ever been disciplined for unethical or improper conduct? 
Have you ever been sued by a client? Don’t just take the advisor’s 
word for it. Check with the licensing and regulatory bodies mentioned 
earlier in “Making sense of all those letters after an advisor’s name” or 
your local Better Business Bureau (BBB; www.bbb.org) to find out if a 
client has sued the advisor.
 
✓ What is your client-to-employee ratio? In some firms, the ratio is sev-
eral hundred to one. You could be lost in such a firm and may never 
meet the people actually making decisions that affect you. In other firms, 
the ratio is under 25 to 1. You need to decide how much personal care 
and attention is important to you.
 
✓ Can I speak with some of your clients whose situations are similar to 
mine? An advisor should be willing to provide you with at least a few 
references of current clients whose needs are similar to yours.
 
In addition to those general questions, which you should ask of any advisor 
you’re considering, you may also want to ask the following questions, which 
are geared specifically toward gauging an advisor’s investment expertise:
 
✓ How did your clients do in the last down market? “Everyone is a 
genius in a bull market” should probably be a bumper sticker for inves-
tors. You want your advisor to be able to protect your money in down 
markets, too.
 
✓ Can you describe your investing approach for me? Have the advisor 
clearly articulate the firm’s investment philosophy. Are they stock 
pickers? Market timers? Long-term asset allocators? Are they dependent 
on one or a few individual “stars,” or is their approach standardized, 
institutionalized, and capable of being reliably reproduced over many 
years? All are possibilities, and if you need clarification on the ins and 
outs of any of them, don’t hesitate to ask the advisor to explain.

289
 Chapter 16: Finding Help When You Need It
 
✓ Are you sensitive to taxes when you do my investments? Many invest-
ment advisors don’t care. Their attitude is, “Our job is getting you a 
good return — taxes are your problem.” You want an advisor who sees 
things more holistically and realistically, one who is sensitive to the 
taxes you pay. Keep in mind that it’s not what you make, but what you 
keep, that counts!
 
✓ What do you invest in? Some firms may favor mutual funds. Others may 
like individual stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Look 
for a firm that provides you the most choices and flexibility.
 
✓ Where will my assets reside, and how are they protected? Most firms 
house their clients’ assets with a custodian (a large financial institu-
tion such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity, or TD Ameritrade). This is good 
for you and adds a layer of protection. Ask the firm if its custodian is a 
member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which 
provides limited protection for consumers if the custodian goes out of 
business. Also, ask if the firm and its custodian have other insurance, to 
provide additional protection.
Yes, these lists of questions are long, but you can get through them in an 
hour or so in an advisor’s office. Commit to spending the time. The informa-
tion you get will be key to choosing the best advisor for you.
 
If you don’t think you can remember all the questions in this section, photo-
copy these pages and bring the questions along to your meeting. Remember 
to take notes at the meeting, too — they’ll help you recall important informa-
tion later, when you’re having trouble keeping straight the advisors you’ve 
met with.
 
Don’t settle on the first advisor you meet with. Meet with two or three before 
you decide. There are subtle and not-so-subtle differences that become clear 
when you can compare advisors to each other. Besides professional qualifica-
tions, be alert to more subjective considerations, such as:
 
✓ Do I feel I can really trust this person with my financial future?
 
✓ Am I comfortable sharing sensitive family information with him?
 
✓ Do I have good personal chemistry with her?
 
✓ Is this someone whom my spouse and children will be able to relate to 
and rely on when I’m no longer around?
 
✓ Did he spend more time talking or listening to my needs?
 
✓ How important will I be to her?

290
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
 
Embarrassed by the idea of asking a potential advisor so many questions? 
Don’t be. Repeat after us: It’s my money. The best advisors will welcome these 
questions, because they’ll be proud to share their responses with you.
Understanding How Advisors 
Earn Their Income
Just like the type of training they have and the services they provide, advi-
sors’ fees vary greatly. Financial advice does come at a price, and the way 
that price is determined can also vary from advisor to advisor. Some may 
charge by the hour. Others may charge a project fee. And some may charge a 
fee that’s a percentage of the assets you’re investing.
Understanding how an advisor earns his money can give you a very useful 
clue to how he views his relationship with you. A stockbroker’s income, for 
example, is often transaction-based, meaning that stockbrokers earn their 
money by selling clients a product. The more products the stockbroker sells, 
the better his chance for increased earnings. You can rest assured that the 
stockbroker will encourage you to consider more transactions, which can 
work out particularly well if you’re knowledgeable about the stock market 
and can direct your stockbroker on the trades you want to make.
On the other hand, an RIA (see the “RIA” section, earlier in this chapter) is 
relationship-based, meaning that she earns her money solely from you. This 
type of advisor has a fiduciary responsibility that comes with the title, so 
she’s legally required to keep your best interests front and center in her deal-
ings with you. That doesn’t necessarily mean that an RIA will always recom-
mend investments that make you money, of course — no one’s right all the 
time — but you can take comfort in the fact that any investments she recom-
mends are, in her opinion, a wise choice for you.
 
Be sure to ask any potential investment advisor just how she earns her money, 
so that you can understand how she views your relationship and take that into 
account when working with her to make your investment decisions.
In the following sections, we cover the main ways in which advisors are typi-
cally compensated. Because they affect your bottom line — and the advisor’s 
economic incentives — you need to make sure you understand how your 
advisor is making his money.

291
 Chapter 16: Finding Help When You Need It
Fee
Advisors who work on a “fee-only” basis are paid solely by you and receive 
no compensation from third parties for selling a financial product. They get 
no commissions, no rebates, no awards, no finder’s fees, no bonuses, and no 
other form of compensation.
The fee may range anywhere from a modest hourly fee (such as $50 per hour), 
to several thousand dollars for a comprehensive financial plan, to a percent-
age (typically 1 percent) of assets under management. (That may not sound 
like much, but remember that 1 percent can mean tens of thousands of dollars 
when an advisor is managing a multi-million-dollar investment portfolio.)
Members of NAPFA work strictly on a fee-only basis. Some FPA members are 
fee-only; others work for a combination of fee and commission (see the next 
two sections).
Commission
Financial advisors who work in the securities industry and insurance agents 
don’t charge a fee that you can see. Instead, they’re compensated by the 
commissions they earn for selling you an investment and/or insurance prod-
uct. In these cases, the advisor is paid by the suppliers of the investment 
and/or insurance products, not by you.
Some FPA members work on a commission basis, and others work for a com-
bination of commission and fee (see the following section).
Fee plus commission
Some financial advisors will charge you a fee to analyze your financial situa-
tion and make recommendations. In addition, they earn a commission on the 
sale of certain investment or insurance products. If the advisor doesn’t dis-
close this information to you at the time of the sale, you’ll have to ask.
 
This arrangement is sometimes called fee-based compensation, or, if the fee is 
reduced somewhat by all, or a part of, the commission received, fee-offset 
commission. Neither of these should be confused with fee-only compensation 
discussed in the “Fee” section earlier.

292
Part IV: Going beyond the Basics 
 
The commission you pay for an advisor’s services is an important consider-
ation, because commissions lower the total return your investment earns. 
(See Chapter 2 for a basic rundown of returns.)
Performance incentive
A performance incentive — where the advisor gets paid based on how well 
your investments perform (the more money you get, the more money the 
advisor gets) — is typical of hedge funds, which are usually only for sophisti-
cated investors. Performance incentives typically accompany other forms of 
compensation.

Part V
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
W
e follow hallowed For Dummies tradition and 
provide three short chapters of top-ten lists, all 
packed with easy-to-digest information. When you read 
these chapters — which include key historical data on ten 
important asset classes and ten popular asset allocation 
mistakes — you’ll find yourself far ahead of most investors 
and well along the road to success. And that, we hope, will 
inspire you to revisit earlier chapters, as needed, to make 
sure you’re always getting the most you can from this 
book — and from your investments!

Chapter 17
Ten Asset Classes and Subclasses 
and Their Historical Rates 
of Return
In This Chapter
▶ Reviewing 20 years of return data for selected asset classes
▶ Knowing what to do with this information
T
his chapter is chock-full of raw data — but don’t let that scare you! When 
it comes to investing, raw data is very useful stuff. In fact, it’s critical 
when it comes time for you to make your investment plan and hammer out 
your asset allocation. Knowing how the various asset classes and subclasses 
behave over time will help you make informed decisions on the mix of assets 
that best suits your investment goals.
Use this chapter as a handy reference. Flip back here when you’re reading 
(or rereading) about risk and return (Chapter 2), choosing asset classes 
and subclasses (Chapter 3), deciding on the right proportions among asset 
classes (Chapter 4), creating your allocation plan (Chapter 8), or buying 
securities (Chapter 9).
Before you check out the return data for each of the ten asset classes and 
subclasses covered in this chapter, have a look at Table 17-1, which lists all 
those categories and how they’re related, as well as the indexes we use to 
measure the total returns for each class.
The figures in this chapter show the annual total returns for each of the ten 
selected assets in Table 17-1 over the 20-year period from 1988 through 2007. 
Looking at an asset’s performance over time gives you a pretty good snapshot 
of the magnitude of the annual total returns themselves, as well as the annual 
volatility in those returns.

296
Part V: The Part of Tens 
This chapter doesn’t dwell on the specifics of the return magnitudes and vol-
atilities in the charts. But we do spotlight some observations and explain why 
they’re important for you to understand and how they can help you improve 
your asset allocation.

Some of the assets have much higher volatilities than others, and in some 
cases, the resulting risk drag — which can weigh down returns (see 
Chapter 2) — is substantial. We point that out, where appropriate. In some 
cases, we refer to certain statistics that we introduce in Chapter 2 — such 
as simple average return, compound average return, range, and standard 
deviation — even though these numbers are not shown explicitly in the 
figures in this chapter.
 
The data in this chapter is useful, but don’t make any decisions on the basis of 
this data alone. Make your investing and asset allocation plans only after you 
understand the bigger picture we paint throughout this book.

 Chapter 17: Ten Asset Classes and Subclasses and Their Historical Rates of Return
Cash
Cash is the most conservative asset. Figure 17-1 shows total returns for cash, 
which are based on the U.S. 30-Day Treasury Bill Index, a popular measure 
for this asset class. As you can see, these returns fall into a relatively narrow 
range. The range, and the standard deviation, of the returns for cash are by 
far the lowest of the ten asset classes covered in this chapter.
 
There’s usually no free lunch (see Chapter 2), meaning that you generally 
don’t get high returns without high risk. It should come as no surprise, then, 
that returns for cash are the lowest of the group of assets we present in this 
chapter, averaging about 4.5 percent annually. And cash is also the only asset 
of the group that didn’t have a negative total return in any of the last 20 years.
 
Think of cash as a ballast that holds down your money and keeps it from float-
ing away.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Corporate Bonds
Corporate bonds are a subclass of the fixed-income asset class. Figure 17-2 
provides return data for corporate bonds.
Corporate bonds, like the other fixed-income subclasses (see “Treasury 
Bonds” and “Municipal Bonds,” in this chapter) have a range and standard 
deviation materially higher than those for cash, but substantially lower 
than the other asset classes in this chapter (alternatives and equities). 
Accordingly, their average returns fall between those for cash and the other 
classes. The average 20-year return for corporate bonds, at a little above 8 
percent, is slightly higher than that for Treasury bonds, at about 7.5 percent, 
reflecting the compensation that the market demands for the generally lower 
creditworthiness of corporate bonds (see Chapter 3).

Treasury Bonds
Treasury bonds are a subclass of the fixed-income asset class. Check out the 
total returns for Treasury bonds over the 20-year period from 1988 through 
2007 in Figure 17-3. Note how the average return (7.5 percent) is just a little 
bit lower than the average return for corporate bonds during the same period 
(over 8 percent — see the preceding section).

Municipal Bonds
Municipal bonds (or munis) are a subclass of the fixed-income asset class. 
The average return for municipal bonds is just under 7 percent (see 
Figure 17-4). As we discuss in Chapter 6, you expect munis to have lower 
returns because their returns are free of income taxes at the federal and 
state level (depending on where you live). So, on an after-tax basis, the 
returns on munis can be quite attractive to investors in high tax brackets.

Real Estate
Real estate (other than the home you live in) is considered an alternative 
investment and is placed in the alternative asset class. In Figure 17-5, you 
can see the return history for real estate, as measured by the FTSE NAREIT 
All-REIT Index. (REIT stands for real estate investment trust; see Chapter 13 
for more information on REITs.) Real estate has a range almost double, and a 
standard deviation more than triple, the corresponding measures for bonds 
over the same 20-year period. With this kind of volatility, you should expect a 
higher return, and real estate delivers. Its simple 20-year average return was 
12.4 percent!
Real estate is the first asset we cover in this chapter where we make a dis-
tinction between the simple and compound average return, because it’s the 
first where the two are materially different — the 20-year compound aver-
age return is 10.9 percent. The difference between the 12.4 percent simple 
average and the 10.9 percent compound average is due to risk drag, which 
you can read all about in Chapter 2 (and several other places throughout 
the book — it’s an important concept!). But you can see that even the risk-
dragged 10.9 percent is superior to the returns for cash and bonds.

Commodities
Like real estate (see the preceding section), commodities fall in the alterna-
tive asset class. Figure 17-6 catalogs the returns over the last 20 years for the 
commodity basket represented by the S&P GSCI (a commodity index), the 
most popular index for this purpose. Commodities are very volatile, with a 
standard deviation much higher than that of any other asset in this chapter 
except emerging-market equities. But this volatility is benign; these returns 
tend to move in a direction counter to that of most other assets in your port-
folio. (They’re poorly correlated, as we discuss in Chapter 4.) The risk drag 
here is even more pronounced than with real estate; the 20-year simple aver-
age return is 13.1 percent, while the compound average is 10.2 percent.

302
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
But don’t let this risk drag give you the creeps — you can eliminate quite a bit 
of the risk drag at the portfolio level by taking advantage of commodities’ poor 
correlation. Mix them with other asset classes in the right proportions and dil-
igently rebalance (as we explain in Chapters 4 and 5), and you’ll end up very 
pleased with your portfolio’s performance. As you can see, even a compound 
average return of 10.2 percent, weighed down as it is by substantial risk drag, 
is better than the returns of cash and bonds, and comparable to real estate.

Large-Cap Stocks
Large-cap stocks are a subclass of the equities asset class. Figure 17-7 dis-
plays the return data for large-cap stocks. You can see that large-cap stocks 
exhibit substantial volatility, but good-size returns, over the long term.

When it comes to equities, cap is shorthand for capitalization, which refers to 
a company’s size. In this context, company sizes are determined by their 
share prices times the number of their outstanding shares. (For a detailed 
breakdown on company size, see Chapter 3.)

Mid-Cap Stocks
Mid-cap stocks are a subclass of the equities asset class. Have a look at 
Figure 17-8 to see the return data for U.S. mid-cap stocks, for the 20-year 
period from 1988 through 2007. As with large-cap stocks (see the preceding 
section) and small-cap stocks (see the following section), mid-cap stocks 
involve substantial volatility but offer healthy long-term returns.

Small-Cap Stocks
Small-cap stocks are a subclass of the equities asset class. You can review 
the annual return data for small-cap stocks in the United States in Figure 17-9. 
Small-cap stocks, like mid-cap and large-cap stocks (see the two preceding 
sections) typically come with a good amount of volatility, but along with that 
volatility, you can count on solid returns over the long run.

Emerging-Market Stocks
Emerging-market stocks, like the three preceding subclasses (large-, mid-, 
and small-cap stocks) fall in the equity asset class. You can see the annual 
return data for emerging-market stocks in Figure 17-10.
Emerging markets deserve special mention. They take the volatility prize for 
this chapter — their standard deviation is higher than that of even commodi-
ties, and roughly double that of the other equity subclasses. The expected 
return is high, but the risk drag is notable; the simple average return of 20.7 
percent drops to 16.3 percent on a compound-average basis because of the 
effect of risk drag. Even so, this is the highest compound-average return we 
encounter in this chapter.

The volatility of emerging-market stocks, like some of the other asset sub-
classes we describe in this chapter, can be scary. You may be tempted to 
reject certain classes or subclasses from consideration for your portfolio 
because they look too volatile. Not so fast! You need some of that volatility in 
your portfolio. The correlation among these assets (a feature that cannot 
easily be shown in figures such as these) is at least as important as their 
expected returns and volatilities (see Chapter 4 for more on this). The figures 
in this chapter are informative, but they tell only part of the story.

Chapter 18
Ten Common Asset 
Allocation Mistakes
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying the mistakes many investors make
▶ Understanding how you can avoid them
W
hat prevents success for most investors? Their own behavior.
Here’s an example: Studies show that the average long-term 
return for equity mutual funds is in the neighborhood of 10 percent, but 
the average investor in those funds gets only 4 percent. Why? Problematic 
investor behavior.
In many cases, investors simply get in their own way. Whether it’s letting 
emotions rule, paying too much attention to the talking heads on TV, chasing 
performance, or trying to time the markets, investors’ bad behavior can 
destroy their best-laid plans and good intentions.
The good news: If you know what to look for, you can dodge these obvious 
mistakes. In this chapter, we outline ten common mistakes made by investors. 
If they sound just a little too familiar, don’t sweat it! At the end of each section, 
we clue you in on how you can avoid the mistakes and nip the problematic 
behavior in the bud.
Ignoring Asset Allocation 
in the First Place
Asset allocation helps investors achieve success. In fact, it’s the key driver 
of success (see Chapter 4). So why don’t more investors use this strategy to 
their benefit? Why do they make the mistake of ignoring asset allocation?

308
Part V: The Part of Tens 
A lack of information isn’t the issue, so scratch that off the list. The Web 
sites of nearly every mutual fund and brokerage firm explain asset allocation. 
Bookstores have shelves full of good books on the subject that we can 
enthusiastically recommend — starting with this one!
A lack of interest isn’t the reason either. Investors follow the news and go 
online daily to find out what’s happening with their portfolios. They’re keenly 
aware of the ups and downs of the market.
What may explain the less-than-universal adoption of asset allocation is this: 
Many investors aren’t really investors at all. They’re speculators. They find 
the pursuit of the undiscovered gem of an investment a sexy undertaking. 
They revel in the thought of making a killing, using market timing, or 
employing a similarly unreliable strategy.
Asset allocation, on the other hand, is methodical — a top-down, scientific 
approach. It’s not sexy at all. In fact, some people even consider it boring. 
And most people don’t like boring.
 
Don’t fall victim to the mistake of shunning asset allocation as your principal 
investment strategy. Repeat after us: Boring is beautiful! You may need to 
rethink your idea of success when it comes to your money. Your aim should 
be to establish a long-term plan that will last and fulfill the financial goals you 
have in mind. Asset allocation should be the centerpiece of that plan. 
Embrace it!
Believing That Diversification Is Enough
Investors tend to confuse asset allocation with diversification. By diversifying 
their portfolio (making sure they’re not overly concentrated in one or a few 
holdings), they believe they’ve achieved asset allocation. Not so!
Asset allocation requires you to be diversified, but that’s not all there is to 
it. Diversification is an important step in asset allocation — but it’s only one 
step. In Chapter 4, we tell you about an investor who owns a number of differ-
ent energy stocks, as well as a commodity index fund. This investor is diver-
sified (no single holding dominates his portfolio), but he has an extremely 
poor asset allocation, because his portfolio is excessively dependent on the 
price of oil.
Asset allocation goes beyond simple diversification; it involves picking asset 
classes that are poorly correlated with each other and then mixing them 
together in the right proportions to optimize the risk/return profile of your 
portfolio (see Chapters 4 and 8 for a more thorough explanation). After that, 
diversification comes into play again, because you want to make sure you 

309
 Chapter 18: Ten Common Asset Allocation Mistakes
have a proper spread of holdings within each asset class. Diversification is 
a good practice — but asset allocation is a full-blown, scientifically derived 
strategy, of which diversification is only one part.
 
Don’t stop short and settle on simply diversifying your portfolio’s holdings. Go 
the extra mile and develop a comprehensive asset allocation plan. You and 
your wallet will be glad you did.
Forgetting to Rebalance
Portfolios are like automobiles. If you want your car to perform over the long 
haul, you take care to practice regular maintenance. It’s the same with your 
portfolio, and one of the most critical facets of regular portfolio maintenance 
is rebalancing.
Rebalancing wisely, and at the right time, is a great way to make sure you’re 
getting the most out of your portfolio. (You can read all about the nuts and 
bolts of rebalancing in Chapter 5.)
The challenge of rebalancing, which is a key companion to asset allocation, is 
that it doesn’t make sense to the uninitiated; it’s counterintuitive. As markets 
shift gears, you buy and sell investments to bring your portfolio back to its 
target allocation. In the beginning, you may be very uncomfortable making 
these adjustments, because it requires that you sell assets that have gone up 
in value and buy others that are not performing so well. It’ll be contrary to 
what your friends are doing and what the press is saying.
 
Don’t be afraid to be a contrarian. When your portfolio tells you it’s time, set it 
back to its target allocation. You’ll improve its return without increasing its 
risk.
Not Having a Long-Term Plan
The steps you need to take to make sure you have a solid, long-term asset 
allocation plan can be many and varied, but we can’t stress enough how 
important it is that you develop a sound plan. Without a plan, you’ll be lost. 
To help you nail down your plan, make sure you’re taking care of the follow-
ing tasks:
 
✓ Think about your goals, and your sources of income and outgo, for the 
next 10, 20, and 30 years.
 
✓ Figure out how much risk you’re comfortable taking.

310
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Understand various asset classes and subclasses, and how they behave.
 
✓ Decide what percentage of your total portfolio to devote to each of these 
asset classes and subclasses.
 
✓ Know how to track your performance and how to put it in the proper 
context.
 
✓ Document your plan.
 
✓ Stick to your plan!
Work like this is hard for those who prefer to make a quick buck, but if you 
take the time to work through the required steps, you’ll end up with a winning, 
profitable plan.
 
Don’t skip the work. No ifs, ands, or buts — this is work. But it’s work that we 
guarantee will benefit you for years to come. When you’re done developing a 
plan — aside from doing regular maintenance (rebalancing and making neces-
sary changes as economic or life conditions require) — you’re done. You’re 
not at the mercy of the market, which is a lot more than many, many investors 
can say.
Indulging Your Emotions
Money represents an uncomfortable paradox for many people. They cringe 
when they think about it, yet that’s all they think about much of the time.
If you don’t have a reasoned, long-term investment plan in place, greed and 
anxiety can take over your thoughts. You may be tempted to hold onto your 
winners too long, or refuse to diversify out of your employer’s stock. Without 
the right plan in place, your emotions can cause you to panic when the stock 
market dips — you may want to just sell out (quite possibly at a loss), and 
then sit on the sidelines until it feels safe to jump back in (usually when it’s 
too late).
These types of emotions aren’t the right guides for any life decision, particu-
larly decisions involving money. Shooting from the hip may feel very exciting 
during the few situations when it actually works out in your favor, but it’s 
not a strategy — it’s gambling, and the opposite of a well-thought-out asset-
allocation plan. 
 
Don’t let your emotions get the best of you. You may get lucky every once in a 
while, but you can’t count on emotion to produce the results you want over 
the long haul.

311
 Chapter 18: Ten Common Asset Allocation Mistakes
Paying Too Much Attention 
to the Financial Media
If you’re serious about investing, reading and listening to the financial news 
can be useful, but a 24/7 dose isn’t healthy for anyone. The talking heads can 
blur your vision, batter your eardrums, and — if you listen too long — drive 
you nuts.
It’s important that you know what’s going on generally with the U.S. and 
global economies, of course, because the business cycle should influence 
your overall asset allocation and the periodic tweaks you make to it (see 
Chapter 15). But the news on any given day (or hour or minute) shouldn’t 
dictate an abrupt or radical shift in your investing strategy. The truly mean-
ingful economic news unfolds gradually.
 
You have to ignore “news” that isn’t simply factual but offers to explain — or, 
worse, predict — the movements in the financial markets and what you 
should do about them. Don’t buy into it! Ignoring these stories can be espe-
cially difficult when it’s time for you to rebalance, because much of the media 
will be telling you to do the exact opposite of what you should be doing.
 
Don’t turn to the financial media for investment advice. Instead, use the news 
to keep up on general economic trends.
Chasing Performance
In very small print at the bottom of every fund prospectus and advertise-
ment, you’ll read, “Past performance is no guarantee of future results.” Yet 
many investors ignore these words and throw money at funds, sectors, or 
managers that are outperforming, hoping to catch some of the gold dust that 
fell on them over the past few years.
Chasing performance can be tempting, because it can make you feel smart — 
and, occasionally, you just may get lucky with it. But keep in mind that you’ll 
still be chasing, not staying ahead of, the curve. Chasing performance, or 
buying the latest hot stock or sector, is like driving a car by looking in the 
rearview mirror. Results for a particular stock or sector may have been good 
for the past one, three, or five years — but there’s no guarantee that they’ll 
continue to outperform. In fact, if you rebalance as you should, you’ll be 
lightening up on these hot performers as most everyone else is piling in.

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
Don’t chase the hot stock, fund, or sector. Stick with your long-term investment 
plan, which is based on good, solid science, and rebalance regularly.
Thinking You Can Outsmart the Market
Active management — not to mention its evil cousin, market timing — is 
based on the premise that you can reliably do better than the market aver-
ages by knowing specifically what securities to invest in and when. Put 
simply, this is hogwash. Studies have consistently shown that such strate-
gies underperform the market indexes over the long term, particularly after 
factoring in the relatively high costs of actively managed funds. Short-term 
exceptions to this rule are the result of luck, plain and simple.
The only reliable way to beat the market over the long term is through 
informed asset allocation and diligent rebalancing. And you can do this even 
if all you invest in is low-cost passive index funds. (Turn to Chapter 4 for 
more on how you can create a portfolio that produces more than the sum of 
its parts.)
 
Don’t fall for active management or market timing. Don’t bet your financial 
future on dumb luck. Stick with informed asset allocation and rebalancing 
instead.
Ignoring Taxes
We’d all like to ignore taxes, but let’s face it: They’re not going away. Perhaps 
in their wishful attempt to disregard the IRS, lots of investors fail to take 
advantage of simple and legal ways to avoid paying taxes they don’t need to 
be paying.
Putting tax-inefficient investments like real estate investment trusts (REITs) 
in a taxable account is one of many common mistakes. Selling a holding at 
a taxable short-term gain weeks before it would qualify for lower taxes as a 
long-term gain is another. Failing to recognize the flexibility that a capital-
loss carryover from a prior tax year gives you is yet another. And, perhaps 
the most common mistake (drum roll, please): failing to harvest tax losses 
throughout the year.
And those examples relate only to income taxes. Avoiding estate taxes can be 
even simpler. We offer numerous bits of advice on how to minimize the effect 
of taxes on your portfolio throughout this book; Chapter 14, in particular, is 
packed with good information on how to be a tax-aware investor and avoid 
taxes you shouldn’t have to pay. We can’t really offer a whole lot of help with 
death, but we’re happy to take some of the bite out of taxes.

313
 Chapter 18: Ten Common Asset Allocation Mistakes
 
Don’t forget to take a good long look at what you’re losing in taxes, and what 
portion of that you could keep if you made a few tweaks to your portfolio. 
Remember: It’s not what you make, but what you keep that really matters. 
Make sure you have the tax man in mind when making investment decisions. 
Don’t let the tax tail wag the investment dog — but, at the same time, don’t 
give away money needlessly because you weren’t paying attention.
Disrespecting Inflation
Inflation is so pervasive, we tend to take it for granted. And yet some inves-
tors ignore inflation — at their peril. If your living expenses inflate at an aver-
age rate of 3.5 percent (not an unreasonable assumption, particularly when 
you factor in fast-rising medical costs), then what cost you $1,000 at age 65 
will cost you roughly $2,000 at age 85. By then, you may have no other source 
of income but your investments, and, if you haven’t factored in inflation in 
the meantime, your investments may not have lasted that long.
Some investors believe that they can best protect their nest egg by being as 
conservative as possible with their investments, loading up on cash equiva-
lents and bonds (see Chapter 3 for more on these and other asset classes). 
But these low-risk investments are the ones most likely to underperform 
when compared to inflation over the long run. As we discuss throughout this 
book, you need to carefully consider the trade-off between capital preserva-
tion and inflation protection, and find the right balance for you.
 
Don’t forget about inflation when creating your long-term investment plan. 
Recognize that wealth is only meaningful in terms of its purchasing power. 
And the purchasing power of a dollar declines over time with relentless regu-
larity. Make sure (within your tolerance for risk) that you have a portfolio that 
generates a healthy long-term expected return in excess of inflation; the alter-
native is to get poorer — and we know you don’t want that!

Ten Questions to Test Your Asset 
Allocation Know-How
In This Chapter
▶ Finding out what you don’t know
▶ Expanding what you know
You can’t really learn unless you know what you don’t know. In this 
chapter, we pose ten questions that test your knowledge of asset 
allocation. There’s no special prize for acing these questions — other than 
the satisfaction that comes with knowing you’ve mastered important concepts 
that’ll put you ahead of most investors.
If you don’t know the answers, no problem — that’s why you have this book! 
If you draw a blank on some of these questions, that’ll tell you what you need 
to bone up on. We let you know where you can turn within this book to get 
the know-how you need.
Dive in, and good luck!
What’s the Best Way to Get Consistently 
Good Investment Performance?
Is it by being a good stock-picker? Nope. Is it by timing the market? Of 
course, not!
 
The best, most reliable way to get consistently good investment performance 
is to determine an asset allocation mix that’s right for you — and stick to it.
The performance of your investments will be determined mostly by your 
asset allocation. Your portfolio should include the fixed-income, equities, and 
alternatives asset classes (see Chapter 8).

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Betting on your (or anyone else’s) ability to pick stocks exposes you to a lot 
more risk. Why?
 
✓ Because you’re investing from the bottom up, and you may end up with 
a portfolio that makes no strategic sense for you.
 
✓ Because, if you end up owning stocks that are concentrated in the same 
sector, they’ll generally trend together — which can be a big problem. 
It’s the opposite of proper diversification.
 
✓ Because individual stocks, including those of large, well-established 
companies, can be very volatile and can even become worthless.
 
✓ Because, by the time a “hot tip” makes it to the media, the stock has 
often reached a very high price, and it may not be a good deal anymore.
 
Relying on stock-picking can be the kiss of death when it comes to investing. 
But it’s not the worst you can do. You could also engage in market timing — 
just saying the words sends chills down our spines. Aside from being unreli-
able, market timing is ultimately a losing strategy. Even the so-called experts 
who try to do it for a living generally end up worse off than the market aver-
ages over the long term.
Determining a good asset allocation mix and sticking to it lacks the drama 
and excitement of chasing hot stock tips or trying to outsmart the market. 
But it’s likely to result in more money for you in the end. If drama and excite-
ment are what you crave, take up skydiving.
What’s Better: An 8 Percent Return 
or a 9 Percent Return?
A portfolio with a simple average return of 9 percent is the clear winner, if 
both portfolios have similar levels of volatility. However, if the portfolio with 
the 9 percent simple average return is a lot more volatile than the one with 
the 8 percent simple average return, all that extra volatility will create signifi-
cant risk drag. If the volatility and resultant risk drag are severe enough, it 
could cause the portfolio with the higher simple average return to leave you 
with less money! For a more detailed explanation of this surprising phenom-
enon, turn to Chapter 2.

317
 Chapter 19: Ten Questions to Test Your Asset Allocation Know-How
What’s the Riskiest Kind of Portfolio?
Is it a portfolio with extremely high volatility? Not necessarily. The riskiest 
portfolio for you is one that has the lowest probability of meeting your over-
all long-term financial needs.
Throughout your life, you’ll have numerous important goals, some of which 
are short term (such as funding education) and some of which are long term 
(such as living in retirement). Whatever financial goals you have, you want to 
make sure your portfolio helps you meet those goals.
 
To cover expenses that’ll need to be paid soon, you want to minimize volatility 
in your assets. For expenses that are farther into the future, you’ll be in a posi-
tion to take a long view and tolerate the greater short-term volatility that 
comes with investing in assets that have higher expected returns. You’ll, 
therefore, be better able to beat inflation. So risk and volatility aren’t equiva-
lent, and, depending on your situation, a high-volatility portfolio may actually 
be your lowest-risk alternative.
Your personal definition of risk will depend on your unique circumstances. Turn 
to Chapter 7 for details on how to figure out what kind of risk is right for you.
How Much Variety Should You Include 
in the Asset Classes You Choose?
It may be tempting to stick with what you know. On the other hand, it may be 
alluring to go after exotic investments that are put together by some really 
smart people. Neither is a winning strategy. Your best bet is to stick with a 
mix of fixed-income, equities, and alternative investments (like real estate 
and commodities).
If you limit yourself to investing only in what’s familiar to you (bonds, for 
example), then your portfolio holdings will likely be concentrated in a couple 
of asset classes or subclasses. It’ll lack needed diversification.
At the same time, you need to make sure you don’t get excited about exotic-
sounding investments and strategies that can have an even more disastrous 
effect on your portfolio. Many of these investments — hedge funds are one 
good example — are very risky and carry very high fees.

318
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Instead of investing only in what’s familiar, or investing in what’s exotic but 
unknown, educate yourself on the building blocks of sound portfolios: fixed-
income assets, equities, and alternatives. (You can read all about the breadth 
of asset-class choices in Chapter 3.)
 
Don’t confuse diversification with asset allocation. Diversification is 
necessary, but not enough, to achieve true asset allocation. To get the full 
picture, check out Chapter 4.
What’s the Best Way to Rebalance?
No, we’re not talking about the rebalancing you can do to your car’s tires, 
or the rebalancing you can do to your chi through yoga. We’re talking about 
rebalancing your portfolio — and the best way to do that is to sell a piece of 
your winning assets and invest in your losing assets.
We know it can sound crazy to the novice investor, but rebalancing really 
works. Why? The only thing we can say for sure about the market is that, at 
different times, some asset classes will go up (or down) faster than others. 
Whatever is currently hot will eventually cool down. Whatever is cold will 
eventually heat up. If you account for this certainty by rebalancing — making 
trades when necessary to stick to your preferred asset allocation — you can 
keep a portfolio that stays warm all the time.
If you invest in assets with low correlation to each other and you diligently 
rebalance your portfolio, then you don’t have to make bets on which way 
the different parts of the market are heading. By selling a part of whatever 
increases significantly, you won’t lose as much money when it does finally 
decrease. By buying more of whatever has decreased significantly, you’ll gain 
more money when it does finally rebound. Rebalancing forces you to buy low 
and sell high. Check out Chapter 5 for all the nuts and bolts of rebalancing.
 
It’s important to distinguish between how you should treat individual stocks 
and how you should treat diversified assets. Although asset classes may go up 
and down and never go out of business, the same is not true for stocks. 
Companies, even household names, can go out of business, or their stock can 
decline dramatically and irreversibly. Before your portfolio suffers too much 
damage, it may be a good idea to either trim your holdings or get out of the 
stock altogether. No use in throwing good money after bad. However, this is 
no longer in the realm of asset allocation — it’s about stock picking.

319
 Chapter 19: Ten Questions to Test Your Asset Allocation Know-How
When Should You Rebalance 
Your Portfolio?
Every day? Every quarter? Every year? No, no, and no, again. You should 
rebalance when and only when your portfolio drifts significantly from your 
target allocation.
If you rebalance too often, you’ll exit the winning assets too early, and the 
excess transaction costs from trading will eat away at your returns. If you 
wait too long, you may miss an opportunity to enhance your returns, as your 
winners become losers again. The best time to rebalance isn’t on a fixed, 
regular schedule, but when your portfolio gets significantly out of balance. 
This may not happen for several months (or even more than a year, if the 
markets are tame), but in especially turbulent markets, you may get several 
rebalancing opportunities in a short period of time. (Flip to Chapters 5 and 11 
for more on rebalancing.)
When Should You Revisit Your 
Asset Allocation Plan?
You should revisit your asset allocation plan at least every four years, or 
whenever you have a major life event. Asset allocation is for the long term, 
because most investment horizons are several years long. The only time you 
should consider revising your asset allocation plan is if there are material 
changes in your situation or if, through the passage of time, you’re in a differ-
ent stage of your life. (See Chapters 8 and 15 for all the relevant details.)
Should You Apply Your Asset Allocation 
Percentages to Each of Your Investment 
Accounts?
This one’s a simple answer: No. You should apply your asset allocation per-
centages to the sum total of all your accounts. Doing so will help you keep 
more of the money that you make instead of paying it in fees and taxes.

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
For example, say you have two accounts: $1 million in taxable Account A and 
$100,000 in tax-deferred Account B. Let’s also assume that your asset alloca-
tion plan calls for you to allocate 7 percent of your portfolio, or $77,000, to 
real estate (through real estate investment trusts, or REITs). If you decided 
to allocate on the account level, you’d invest $70,000 in Account A and $7,000 
in Account B (7 percent of each account). If you were to allocate on the 
aggregate portfolio level, you might invest the entire $77,000 in tax-deferred 
Account B. There are several advantages to allocating on the portfolio level 
in this example:
 
✓ Tax efficiency: REITs are tax-inefficient, meaning that they generate 
income that is taxed at the highest (ordinary income) tax rates. In this 
example, the tax-inefficient REITs are better placed in the tax-deferred 
account, so you don’t have to pay taxes at the higher ordinary income-
tax rate every year on the income you get from the REIT.
 
✓ Ease and cost of rebalancing: When it comes time to rebalance, instead 
of having to do it twice (once for each account, in this example — more 
if you have more than two accounts), you can rebalance once across 
both accounts. This process is easier and also saves on transaction 
costs.
 
✓ Meeting investment minimums: Some mutual funds have separate share 
classes that require high minimum investments. These share classes 
offer investors lower fees. In other words, one $77,000 investment may 
cost you less to own than a $70,000 investment and a $7,000 investment.
The tactical placement of certain assets in certain accounts is called asset 
location. We touch on this in Chapter 6, and explore it in depth in Chapter 10.
How Do You Know How Well Your 
Investments Have Performed?
You can determine how well your investments have performed by calculating 
your time-weighted compound average return. The time-weighted return is a 
measure of how your investments did. For purposes of comparison to exter-
nal market benchmark returns, this is superior to the dollar-weighted return, 
which is a measure of how well you did. What’s the difference? The time-
weighted return isn’t affected by when you made deposits to or withdrawals 
from the account; the dollar-weighted return does. (If there are no deposits 
or withdrawals in an account, then the two will be the same.)

321
 Chapter 19: Ten Questions to Test Your Asset Allocation Know-How
For example, say your portfolio returned –10 percent in the first half of the 
year and 20 percent in the second half of the year. Your time-weighted com-
pound return would have been 8 percent for the year, regardless of what 
you may have deposited or withdrawn during the year (see Chapter 2 for 
how to calculate this). Your dollar-weighted return could be higher or lower 
than that, depending solely on the timing of your deposits and withdrawals, 
making meaningful external comparisons problematic.
Likewise, compound average returns are more useful than simple average 
returns. The compound average is the accurate and proper measure of multi-
period returns. The simple average is a quick-and-dirty estimate for the com-
pound average return. Specifically, the simple average doesn’t take risk drag 
into account. For volatile investments, the difference between the simple 
return and the compound return can be significant.
We discuss these various measures of return in Chapter 2 and talk about 
making external comparisons in Chapter 12.
Where Can You Go for Help with 
Your Asset Allocation?
If you’re interested in getting some help with your asset allocation plan, con-
sult a qualified, proven professional. You need to be certain that the person 
has a designation that requires passing a rigorous exam, continuing educa-
tion, and relevant work experience (see Chapter 16). And be sure that, above 
all, your advisor listens to your needs. Your financial advisor should focus on 
meeting your needs and not on pushing products, or her own special exper-
tise, on you. Make sure you also know the handful of professional designa-
tions that are not only meaningful, but also appropriate to your goals.

Use allocation strategies 
of the pros and protect 
your financial future
You don’t have to be an investment expert to allocate your 
assets successfully. This plain-English guide demystifies 
the process, giving you timely advice on diversifying your 
investment portfolio to help insulate it against volatility. 
You’ll see how to develop your personal investment 
strategy, avoid costly mistakes, and rebalance to generate 
extra return.
•  The ABCs of asset allocation — discover how it works, why to do 
it, and the level of risk you’re comfortable with
•  Explore the different asset categories — from cash and bonds to 
stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and more 
•  Plan your investment strategy — set your portfolio constraints, 
outline your financial goals, and select your asset classes
•  Choose securities and accounts — select the best ones, 
understand fees and expenses, and take advantage of tax breaks
•  Maintain your portfolio — keep tabs on your investments, 
know when to rebalance, and measure your results against 
appropriate market benchmarks
•  Go beyond the basics — consider alternative investments (such 
as real estate and commodities), maximize after-tax results, and 
work with the pros when you need help
