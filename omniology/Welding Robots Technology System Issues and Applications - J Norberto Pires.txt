Foreword 
 
Industrial robots are essential components of today’s factory and even more of the 
factory of the future. The demand for the use of robots stems from the potential for 
flexible, intelligent machines that can perform tasks in a repetitive manner at 
acceptable cost and quality levels. The most active industry in the application of 
robots is the automobile industry and there is great interest in applying robots to 
weld and assembly operations, and material handling. 
 
For the sake of competitiveness in modern industries, manual welding must be 
limited to shorter periods of time because of the required setup time, operator 
discomfort, safety considerations and cost. Thus, robotic welding is critical to 
welding automation in many industries. It is estimated as much as 25% of all 
industrial robots are being used for welding tasks.  
 
Robotic welding is being initiated to satisfy a perceived need for high-quality 
welds in shorter cycle times. The first generation of robotic welding system was a 
two-pass weld system, where the first pass is dedicated to learning the seam 
geometry followed by the actual tracking and welding in the second pass. The 
second generation of welding systems, on the other hand, track the seam in real-
time, performing simultaneously the learning and the seam tracking phases. The 
third generation of welding systems not only operates in real-time but also learns 
the rapid changing in seam geometries while operating within unstructured 
environments. Flexibility was achieved with this third generation of welding 
systems but at the expenses of a considerable amount of programming work of 
high skilled people in system’s integration directed to specific applications. 
However, availability and agility are additional key issues in modern 
manufacturing industries, demanding new welding systems incorporating these 
features as well, revealing in this way the flexibility of the system to the normal 
operator without the need of extra skills from him. 
 
This book covers up-to-date and relevant work in the area of third generation of 
robotic welding systems with availability and agility features. The principal 

viii 
Foreword 
 
welding processes are reviewed from the point of view of their automation. A 
distributed system’s approach is followed for the integration of the different 
components and software of the welding cell and its integration within the global 
production system. Particular emphasis is given to the availability and agility to the 
end user. Application examples demonstrating step-by-step the system’s 
integration design clarify the relevant aspects to the interested reader. 
 
The authors have made a strong-minded effort to set their work in the context of 
international robotic arc welding research. The mix of specific research issues and 
the review of broader research approaches make this a particularly welcome 
contribution.  
 
This book is directed towards readers who are interested in developing robotic 
welding applications, and in particular to perform system integration. Although this 
work is presented in the context of arc welding, the issues related to system 
integration are general in nature and apply to other robotic applications as well. 
This book constitutes a valuable source of the kind of information on robotic 
welding that result of years of experience, making it suitable as well for the 
decision maker, the application engineer, the researcher, the technician, and the 
student.

Preface 
Modern manufacturing faces two main challenges: more quality at lower prices 
and the need to improve productivity. Those are the requirements to keep 
manufacturing plants in developed countries, facing competition from the low-
salary regions of the world. Other very important characteristics of the 
manufacturing systems are flexibility and agility of the manufacturing process, 
since companies need to respond to a very dynamic market with products 
exhibiting very short life-cycles due to fashion tendencies and worldwide 
competition. Consequently, manufacturing companies need to respond to market 
requirements efficiently, keeping their products competitive. This requires a very 
efficient and controlled manufacturing process, where focus is on automation, 
computers and software. The final objective is to achieve semi-autonomous 
systems, i.e., highly automated systems that work requiring only minor operator 
intervention.  
 
Robotic welding is one of the most successful applications of industrial robot 
manipulators. In fact, a huge number of products require welding operations in 
their assembly processes. Despite all the interest, industrial robotic welding 
evolved only slightly and is far from being a solved technological process, at least 
in a general way. The welding process is complex, difficult to parameterize and to 
monitor and control effectively. In fact, most of the welding techniques are not 
fully understood, namely the effects on the welding joints, and are used based on 
empirical models obtained by experience under specific conditions. The effects of 
the welding process on the welded surfaces are currently not fully known. Welding 
can in most cases impose extremely high temperatures concentrated in small zones. 
Physically, that makes the material experience extremely high and localized 
thermal expansion and contraction cycles, which introduce changes in the materials 
that may affect its mechanical behavior along with plastic deformation. Those 
changes must be well understood in order to minimize the effects.  
 
The majority of industrial welding applications benefit from the introduction of 
robot manipulators, since most of the deficiencies attributed to the human factor is 
removed with advantages when robots are introduced. This should lead to cheaper 

x 
Preface 
 
products since productivity and quality can be increased, and production costs and 
manpower can be decreased. Nevertheless, when a robot is added to a welding 
setup the problems increase in number and in complexity. Robots are still difficult 
to use and program by regular operators, have limited remote facilities and 
programming environments, and are controlled using closed systems and limited 
software interfaces. 
 
The present book gives a detailed overview of Robotic Welding at the beginning of 
the twenty-first century. The evolution of robotic welding is presented, showing to 
the reader what were the biggest steps and developments observed in the last few 
years. This is presented with the objective of establishing the current state-of-the-
art in terms of technologies, welding systems, software and sensors. The remaining 
issues, i.e., the issues that remain open are stated clearly, as a way to motivate the 
readers to follow the rest of the book which will make contributions to clarify most 
of them and help to solve a few. 
 
To do that, a good chapter on “Welding Technology” is presented, describing the 
most important welding techniques and their potential and requirements for 
automation using robot manipulators. This chapter includes recent results on 
robotic welding processes, which can constitute a good source of information and 
practical examples for readers.  
 
A good revision with current research results on “Sensors for Welding Robots” 
used on robotic welding is also presented. This includes sensors for seam tracking, 
quality control and supervision. This chapter includes all system requirements 
necessary to use those sensors and sensing techniques with actual robot control 
systems. Hardware and software interfaces are also covered in detail. 
 
A good revision on available welding systems, including hardware and software, 
clarifying their advantages, and drawbacks is also necessary to give to the reader a 
clear picture of the area. The book includes a chapter on “Welding Robots: System 
Issues”, which covers recent state-of-the-art of industrial robotic welding systems 
currently available in industry and university laboratories.  
 
Finally, a few industrial applications using the presented techniques and systems is 
presented. The present book includes a chapter on “Robotic Welding: Application 
Examples”, where a few selected applications are described in detail including 
aspects related to software, hardware, system integration and industrial 
exploitation. This chapter uses actual robots, but it is presented in a general way so 
that the interested reader can easily explore his interests. 
 
Conclusions stating what was presented and what are the next challenges, guiding 
the reader to what are the next required developments, is presented at the end of the 
book. A good collection of references is also presented, to enable the reader to 
explore further from the literature.

Introduction and Overview 
1.1 Introduction 
Actual market conditions are only compatible with small/medium batch 
manufacturing, due to strong competition and dynamical behavior of the market. In 
those conditions, robotic production setups exhibit the best “cost per unit” 
performance if compared with manual work and with hard automated setups 
(Figure 1.1) [1]. Consequently, near future requires powerful and more flexible 
machines in order to handle requests from small businesses, which need more 
remote interfaces, powerful programming languages, force control, powerful 
Advanced Programming Interfaces (APIs) for high level programming, etc. That 
means exposing to the user the flexibility stored inside the manufacturing robotic 
machines, as a result of several decades of engineering, which is currently barely 
used. 
 
What makes robotics so interesting is that it is a science of ingenious devices, 
constructed with precision, powered by a permanent power source, and flexible 
from the programming point of view. That does not mean necessarily open source, 
but instead the availability of powerful APIs, and de facto standards both for 
hardware and software, enabling access to system potentialities without limitations. 
This is particularly necessary on research environments, where a good access to 
resources is needed in a way to implement and test new ideas. If that is available, 
then a system integrator (or even a researcher) will not require open source 
software, at least for the traditional fields of robotics (industrial robot manipulators 
and mobile robots). In fact, that could also be very difficult to achieve since those 
fields of robotics have decades of engineering efforts, achieving very good results 
and reliable machines, which are not easy to match. That open source issue is 
nevertheless very important for the emerging robotics research (like humanoid 
robotics, space robotics, robots for medical use, etc.) as a way to spread and 
accelerate development (Figure 1.2).

Welding Robots 
 
Industrial Robotic Welding is by far the most popular application of robotics 
worldwide [6]. In fact, there is a huge number of products that require welding 
operations in their assembly processes. The car industry is probably the most 
important example, with the spot and MIG/MAG welding operations in the car 
body workshops of the assembly lines. Nevertheless, there are an increasing 
number of smaller businesses, client oriented, manufacturing small series or unique 
products designed for each client. These users require a good and highly automated 
welding process in a way to respond to client needs in time and with high quality. 
It is for these companies that the concepts of Agile Production [7],[8] apply the 
most, obviously supported by flexible manufacturing setups. Despite all this 
interest, industrial robotic welding evolved slightly and is far from being a solved 
technological process, at least in a general way. The welding process is complex, 
difficult to parameterize and to effectively monitor and control [1]-[7]. In fact, 
most of the welding techniques are not fully understood, namely the effects on the 
welding joints, and are used based on empirical models obtained by experience 
under specific conditions. The effects of the welding process on the welded 
surfaces are currently not fully known. Welding can in most cases (i.e. MIG/MAG 
welding) impose extremely high temperatures concentrated in small zones. 
Physically, that makes the material experience extremely high and localized 
thermal expansion and contraction cycles, which introduce changes in the materials 
that may affect its mechanical behavior along with plastic deformation [9]-[11]. 
Those changes must be well known in order to minimize the effects.  
 
 
 
Figure 1.1. Industrial robot zone 
 
Using robots with welding tasks is not straightforward and has been a subject of 
various R&D efforts [12]-[16]. And that is so because the modern world produces 
a huge variety of products that use welding to assemble some of their parts. If the 
percentage of welding connections incorporated in the product is big enough, then

some kind of automation should be used to perform the welding task. This should 
lead to cheaper products since productivity and quality can be increased, and 
production costs and manpower can be decreased [17]. Nevertheless, when a robot 
is added to a welding setup the problems increase in number and in complexity. 
Robots are still difficult to use and program by regular operators, have limited 
remote facilities and programming environments, and are controlled using closed 
systems and limited software interfaces [18]-[22].

In this book, most of these problems are addressed in detail along with a 
comprehensive presentation and discussion of a laboratory system built with the 
main objective of being a test bed for welding experiments. Our experience with 
the system shows that it has potentialities for industrial utilization, and in fact that 
idea is explored in the book, using industrial partner test-cases. For that purpose 
mainly industrial equipment was selected in designing the system, as a way to 
facilitate its industrial exploitation. The book also addresses aspects of system 
programming and welding parameterization, which constitute one of the main 
contributions of the book. 
 
1.1.1 Why Robotic Welding and a CAD Programming Interface? 
Automation of the welding process is a very challenging area of research in the 
fields of robotics, sensor technology, control systems and artificial intelligence. 
This book discusses the automation of the welding process taking as an example

the arc welding process. Although there’s a huge number of welding processes, 
usually suited for a particular type of application, arc welding is used in nearly all 
applications in the metal manufacturing industry. The two most common types of 
arc welding processes are the gas shielded tungsten arc welding (GTAW) and the 
gas shielded metal arc welding (GMAW) processes.  
 
The gas shielded tungsten arc welding process (GTAW), also known as tungsten 
inert gas (TIG), is a welding process where the arc is created between a non-
consumable electrode and the work metal. The process is shielded from 
contamination by the atmosphere using an inert gas, usually argon or a mixture of 
gases. The intense heat, generated by the electric arc produced by an electric 
current in the 50 to 700 A range, melts the work metal and allows the joining as the 
metal solidifies. Since the electrode is non-consumable the welding can be 
performed without the addition of filler metal, but in some cases a filler metal is 
used depending on the requirements established for the particular join.  
 
The gas shielded metal arc (GMAW), also known as MIG (Inert Gas Metal) / 
MAG (Active Gas Metal) welding process, uses the heat of the electric arc to melt 
the consumable electrode wire and the metallic components to be welded. Figure 
1.3 illustrates the welding principle. The fusion is carried out under the protection 
of an inert gas (argon or helium), or mixture of an inert gas with much cheaper 
gases like oxygen or carbon dioxide (CO2), in order to prevent the pernicious 
contamination with some gases of the atmosphere (oxygen, nitrogen and 
hydrogen). Applying a high current to the electrode causes its tip to melt 
transferring in this way metal to the work-piece. The electrode is fed automatically 
to the arc using a coil that unfolds at a controlled speed. The rate at which the 
electrode is fed is known as wire feed rate, and is one parameter of fundamental 
importance for controlling this welding process. Depending on the magnitude of 
the electrode current and voltage, along with the type of gas and size of the 
electrode, four different types of metal transfer modes can be obtained: spray, 
short-circuiting, globular and pulsed transfer.  
 
A complete description of these and other current welding processes will be 
presented in Chapter 2. Nevertheless, the brief description above makes it easy to 
conclude that a good quality weld relies on the welder’s experience and skill. The 
experienced and skilled manual welder is able to select the welding process 
parameters based on similar cases previously encountered. In particular, he is able 
to: 
 
1. Select the type of shielding gas, the type and diameter of wire to use, and 
the initial current and voltage settings more suitable for the case in hand. 
2. Adjust continuously the process variables by looking to the molten pool or 
by listening to the sound produced by the arc. 
3. Maintain the torch in the correct position with precision and stability, 
which is fundamental for a good and constant weld.

Consequently, the task of automating the welding operation is to reproduce the 
experienced and skilled manual welder in terms of positioning the welding torch, 
and controlling the welding parameters. That means availability of databases that 
register known cases, from where initial conditions can be selected, along with 
type of shielding gases and wires. That means also the capacity to observe the 
ongoing process and adjust or adapt the controlling parameters in accordance with 
the desired results. And finally, the possibility of holding the welding torch and 
move it in a precise and controlled way. Therefore, as previously mentioned, 
automating the welding process is a mixture of robotics research, control systems 
research, sensor research, sensor fusion and artificial intelligence. 
 
Let’s consider for example the MIG/MAG welding process. The stability of the 
welding process is very sensitive to the main welding parameters, especially 
current, voltage, welding speed, stick-out (length of wire out of the contact tube), 
shielding gas and arc length [24]. A small change in the distance between the 
welding torch and the component being welded may produce a considerable 
variation in the current and in the voltage. Current, voltage and shielding gas 
influence the transfer mode of melted filler metal to the component being welded, 
affecting the quality of the welds [25]. If the electric arc is unstable, defects like 
bad penetration profile, undercut or excessive spatter may occur.

Welding Institute – UK [26]. In these databases the input data is generally the type 
of weld (butt weld or fillet weld), the welding position (flat, horizontal, vertical or 
overhead), wire diameter and the plate thickness or eventually the leg length in the 
case of fillet welds. The output data is usually the welding parameters (namely, 
current, voltage, welding speed and number of weld beads/layers). Using databases 
of this type with a computer, the selection of the welding parameters may be 
performed automatically. Even the selection of the wire diameter may be carried 
out automatically as a function of the thickness of the components, or stay for free 
user selection being an input parameter. 
 
It might be expected that with this information in the computer, having a CAD 
model of the component to be welded, the system would be able to select the 
welding data for each weld and send these data to the robotic welding system. 
Though it seems easy to achieve this goal in the case of single welds, some data are 
missing in the available databases for the case of welds with multiple layers. In 
fact, in this case the position of the torch in each layer needs to be indicated to the 
robot. 
 
Since for the majority of the companies that produce multi-layer welds there is 
only a small number of distinct welds, then it is not hard to fill up the database for 
their particular case. Consequently, using this method it is easy to carry out the off-
line programming of the components to be welded, it being only necessary to 
adjust the coordinates of the process points in the first specimen to be welded. 
 
1.2 Historical Perspective 
Welding is a skill used to manufacture, produce, construct and repair metal objects. 
In fact this skill can also be used to join other type of materials, but this book 
focuses only on welding processes used to join metal objects, where this skill is 
critical for several areas of activity like defense, aerospace, shipbuilding, 
transportation, building and bridge construction, industrial apparatus and consumer 
products.  
 
The word “robot” comes from the Czech “robota” that means tireless work, and 
was used for the first time in 1921 by the novelist Karel Capek in his novel 
“Rossum’s Universal Robots”. But robotics was in the head of the most brilliant 
minds of our common history, since most of them took time to imagine, design and 
build machines that could mimic some of the human capabilities. It is one of the 
biggest dreams of man, to build obedient and tireless machines, capable of 
substituting man doing their boring and repetitive work. An idea very well 
explained by Nicola Tesla in his diary [4]:  
“… I conceived the idea of constructing an automaton which would 
mechanically represent me, and which would respond, as I do myself, but, 
of course, in a much more primitive manner, to external influences. Such an

automaton evidently had to have motive power, organs for locomotion, 
directive organs, and one or more sensitive organs so adapted as to be 
excited by external stimuli …”. 
 
In the next two sub-sections a brief overview of the history of both welding and 
robotics will be given. 
 
1.2.1 Welding 
Welding is also an ancient craft that combines art, science and human skill. It can 
be traced back to around 3000 BC, with the Sumerians and the Egyptians. The 
Sumerians used to made swords with parts joined by hard soldering. The Egyptians 
found that after heating iron, it was much easier to work with, or apply “pressure” 
welding or “solid-state” welding just by hammering the parts to join. These are the 
first recorded welding procedures. Several objects were found in tombs, 
excavations, etc., indicating the use of several welding techniques, like “pressure” 
(hammering) welding, applied with several metal materials (gold, iron, bronze, 
copper, etc.), in those ancient times.  
 
In the sixteenth century these basic welding techniques were well known but not 
used to any great extent. In 1540, the Italian Engineer Vannoccio Biringuccio 
explains in his book “The Pirotechnia”, published in Venice [35], that welding 
“seems to me an ingenious thing, little used, but of great usefulness”, and he 
continues: 
“the secret of welding a fracture of a saw, a sickle, or a sword, resides in 
taking some low silver, borax or crushed glass and embracing the fracture 
with a pair of hot tongs and closing so tight till the welding leans out and so 
cools” 
 
During these middle ages, the art of blacksmithing was further developed and it 
was possible to produce many items of iron welded by hammering. It was not until 
the nineteenth century that welding, as we know it today, was invented. 
 
In the nineteenth century and early twentieth century several discovers in the field 
of electricity and magnetism, but also in metallurgy, heat transfer and 
thermodynamics, anticipated the amazing evolution done on welding during the 
twentieth century. In 1800 Alessandro Volta finds a way to store energy in his 
“voltaic cell” (battery), just by connecting two dissimilar metals using a moistened 
substance. This was the first step to use electricity effectively. One year later, in 
1801, the eminent English scientist Sir Humphrey Davy, demonstrated how to 
generate an electric arc between two carbon electrodes. The same scientist 
discovered magnesium and proved the existence of aluminum (finally discovered 
in 1827 by Friederich Wöler), both in 1808. He also discovered acetylene in 1836. 
In the mid-nineteenth century, the electric generator was invented and arc lighting 
became popular. During the late 1800s, gas welding and cutting was developed. 

8 
Welding Robots 
 
Arc welding with the carbon arc and metal arc was developed and resistance 
welding became a practical joining process.  
 
In 1881, Auguste De Meritens, working in the Cabot Laboratory (France), used the 
heat of an electric arc for joining lead plates for storage batteries. The process was 
patented in France by his Russian protégé, Nikolai N. Benardos, which also 
secured, with a Russian colleague named Stanislaus Olszewski, a British patent in 
1885 and an American patent in 1887. The patents show an early electrode holder. 
This was the beginning of carbon-arc welding. Bernardos' efforts were restricted to 
carbon arc welding, very popular in the following 20 years, although he was able to 
weld iron as well as lead.  
 
In 1890, C.L. Coffin registered the first U.S. patent for an arc welding process 
using a metal electrode. This was the first record of a welding process where the 
metal, melted from the electrode, was carried across the arc to deposit filler metal 
in the joint to make a weld. This neat idea of transferring metal across an arc was 
presented, about the same time, by the Russian N.G. Slavianoff, to cast metal in a 
mold. Interesting coincidence. 
 
Around 1900, Strohmenger introduced a coated metal electrode in England. The 
coating, made of clay or lime, was very thin but sufficient to provide a more stable 
arc. Oscar Kjellberg and the ESAB Company, both from Sweden, invented a 
covered or coated electrode during the period 1907 to 1914. Stick electrodes were 
produced by dipping short lengths of bare iron wire in thick mixtures of carbonates 
and silicates, and allowing the coating to dry. 
 
Meanwhile, resistance welding processes were also developed, including spot 
welding, seam welding, projection welding and flash butt welding. Elihu 
Thompson originated resistance welding in the nineteenth century: his patents are 
dated from 1885 to 1900. In 1903, a German named Goldschmidt invented thermite 
welding that was first used to weld railroad rails. The first automobile body spot 
welded was built by E.G. Budd in Phyladelphia (USA) in 1912.  
 
Gas welding and cutting were perfected during this period as well. The production 
of oxygen and later the liquefying of air, along with the introduction of a blow 
pipe, or torch, in 1887, helped the development of both welding and cutting. 
Before 1900, hydrogen and coal gas were used with oxygen. However, in about 
1900 a torch suitable for use with low-pressure acetylene was developed. 
 
World War I brought a tremendous demand for armament production, which means 
huge production of heavy and very dissimilar metal parts. Consequently, welding 
was pressed into service as a way to respond to those production demands, giving 
the opportunity to several companies to appear, both in America and Europe, and 
manufacture the necessary welding machines and electrodes. 
 
Immediately after the war in 1919, 20 members of the Wartime Welding 
Committee of the Emergency Fleet Corporation under the leadership of Comfort

Avery Adams, founded the American Welding Society, a nonprofit organization 
dedicated to the advancement of welding and allied processes. 
 
Alternating current, invented in 1882 by Nicola Tesla, was applied to welding for 
the first time by C.J. Holslag in 1919. However it did not became popular, for 
welding, until the 1930s when the heavy-coated electrodes become generally used. 
 
In 1920, automatic welding was invented by P.O. Nobel of the General Electric 
Company. It was used to build up worn motor shafts, worn crane wheels, and rear 
axle housings for the automobile industry. This process utilized bare electrode wire 
operated on direct current and utilized arc voltage as the basis of regulating the 
feed rate.  
 
During the 1920s, various types of welding electrodes were developed, with a 
considerable controversy about the advantage of the heavy-coated rods vs light-
coated rods. By 1930, covered electrodes were widely used. Welding codes 
appeared which required higher-quality weld metal, which increased the use of 
covered electrodes. 
 
Also during the 1920s there was considerable research in trying to shield the arc 
and weld area by externally applied gases. The atmosphere of oxygen and nitrogen 
in contact with the molten weld metal caused brittle and sometime porous welds. 
Research work was done utilizing gas shielding techniques. Alexander and 
Langmuir did some exploratory work in chambers using hydrogen as a welding 
atmosphere. They first utilized two electrodes of carbon, but changed later to 
tungsten. The hydrogen was also changed to atomic hydrogen near the arc, because 
the flame produced was more intense than the molecular form produced flame, and 
as intense as an oxyacetylene flame. This then became known as the atomic 
hydrogen welding process. Atomic hydrogen never became popular but was used 
during the 1930s and 1940s for special applications of welding and later on for 
welding of tool steels. 
 
H.M. Hobart and P.K. Devers were doing similar work but using atmospheres of 
argon and helium. Their patents (1926) were the predecessors of the gas tungsten 
arc welding process, because they showed how to carry out arc welding utilizing 
gas supplied around the arc. They also showed welding with a concentric nozzle 
and with the electrode being fed as a wire through the nozzle. This was the 
predecessor of the gas metal arc welding process (GMAW), which was developed 
only 20 years later. 
 
Stud welding was developed in 1930 at the New York Navy Yard, specifically for 
attaching wood decking over a metal surface. Stud welding became popular in the 
shipbuilding and construction industries. 
 
The automatic process that became popular was the submerged arc welding 
process. This "under powder" or smothered arc welding process was developed by 
the National Tube Company for a pipe mill at McKeesport, Pennsylvania. It was 

10 
Welding Robots 
 
designed to make longitudinal seams in pipe. The process was patented by 
Robinoff in 1930 and was later sold to Linde Air Products Company, where it was 
renamed Unionmelt® welding. Submerged arc welding was actively used during 
the 1938 defense buildup in shipyards and in ordnance factories. It is one of the 
most productive welding processes and remains popular today. 
 
Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) had its beginnings in an idea by C.L. Coffin to 
weld in a non-oxidizing gas atmosphere, which he patented in 1890. The concept 
was further refined in the late 1920s by H.M. Hobart, who used helium for 
shielding, and P.K. Devers, who used argon. This process was ideal for welding 
magnesium and also for welding stainless steel and aluminum. It was perfected in 
1941, patented by Meredith, and named Heliarc® welding. It was later licensed to 
Linde Air Products, where the water-cooled torch was developed. The gas tungsten 
arc welding process has become one of the most important gas arc welding 
processes. 
 
The gas shielded metal arc welding (GMAW) process was successfully developed 
at the Battelle Memorial Institute in 1948 under the sponsorship of the Air 
Reduction Company. This development utilized the gas shielded arc, similar to the 
gas tungsten arc, but replaced the tungsten electrode with a continuously fed 
electrode wire. One of the basic changes that made the process more usable was 
the small-diameter electrode wires and the constant-voltage poser source (a 
principle patented earlier by H.E. Kennedy). The initial introduction of GMAW 
was for welding nonferrous metals. The high deposition rate led users to try the 
process on steel, but since the cost of inert gas was relatively high at the time, the 
cost savings were not immediately evident. 
 
In 1953, Lyubavskii and Novoshilov announced the use of welding with 
consumable electrodes in an atmosphere of CO2 gas. The CO2 welding process 
immediately gained favor since it utilized equipment developed for inert gas metal 
arc welding, but could now be used to perform more economical welds with steels. 
Since the CO2 arc is a hot arc requiring fairly high currents for larger electrodes, 
the process only became widely used with the introduction of smaller-diameter 
electrode wires and more efficient power supplies. Those power supplies used the 
short-circuit arc variation, also known as Micro-wire®, short-arc, or dip transfer 
welding, all of which appeared late in 1958 and early in 1959. This variation 
allowed welding on thin materials and every position, and soon became the most 
popular of the gas metal arc welding process variations. 
 
Another variation was the use of inert gas with small amounts of oxygen that 
provided the spray-type arc transfer. It became popular in the early 1960s.  
 
A more recent variation is the use of pulsed current. The current is switched from a 
high to a low value at a rate of once or twice the line frequency (50 Hz in Europe). 
 
Soon after the introduction of CO2 welding, a variation utilizing a special electrode 
wire was developed. This wire, described as an inside-outside electrode, was 

 
Introduction and Overview 
11 
 
tubular in cross section with the fluxing agents on the inside. The process was 
called Dualshield®, which indicated that external shielding gas was utilized, as 
well as the gas produced by the flux in the core of the wire, for arc shielding. This 
process, invented by Bernard, was announced in 1954, but was patented in 1957, 
when the National Cylinder Gas Company reintroduced it. 
 
In 1959, an inside-outside electrode was produced which did not require external 
gas shielding. The absence of shielding gas gave the process popularity for non-
critical work. This process was named Innershield®. 
 
The electroslag welding process was announced by the Soviets at the Brussels 
World Fair in Belgium in 1958. It had been used in the Soviet Union since 1951, 
but was based on work done in the United States by R.K. Hopkins, who was 
granted patents in 1940. The Hopkins process was never used to a very great 
degree for joining. The process was perfected and equipment was developed at the 
Paton Institute Laboratory in Kiev, Ukraine, and also at the Welding Research 
Laboratory in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. The first production use in the U.S. was 
at the Electromotive Division of the General Motors Corporation in Chicago, 
where it was called the Electro-molding process. It was announced in December 
1959 for the fabrication of welded diesel engine blocks. The process, and its 
variation using a consumable guide tube, is used for welding thicker materials. 
 
The Arcos Corporation introduced another vertical welding method, called 
Electrogas, in 1961. It utilized equipment developed for electroslag welding, but 
employed a flux-cored electrode wire and an externally supplied gas shield. It is an 
open arc process since a slag bath is not involved. A newer development uses self-
shielding electrode wires and a variation uses solid wire but with gas shielding. 
These methods allow the welding of thinner materials than can be welded with the 
electroslag process. 
 
Robert F. Gage invented plasma arc welding in 1957. This process uses a 
constricted arc or an arc through an orifice, which creates an arc plasma that has a 
higher temperature than the tungsten arc. It is also used for metal spraying and for 
cutting. 
 
The electron beam welding process, which uses a focused beam of electrons as a 
heat source in a vacuum chamber, was developed in France. J.A. Stohr of the 
French Atomic Energy Commission made the first public disclosure of the process 
on November 23, 1957. In the United States, the automotive and aircraft engine 
industries are the major users of electron beam welding. 
 
Friction welding, which uses rotational speed and upset pressure to provide friction 
heat, was developed in the Soviet Union. It is a specialized process and has 
applications only where a sufficient volume of similar parts is to be welded 
because of the initial expense for equipment and tooling. This process is called 
inertia welding.  
 

12 
Welding Robots 
 
The company TWI (Cambridge, England) developed in 1991 the new and 
impressive Friction Stir Welding Process in its laboratory. This process is 
considerably different from the rotary technology whereby a hard, non 
consumable, cylindrical tool causes friction, plasticizing two metals into a solid-
state bond. This process does not require any shielding gas or filler metal, produces 
good quality welds for at least aluminum series 2XXX, 6XXX and 7XXX, and was 
used successfully to weld the impressive fuel tank of the Space Shuttle (NASA).

Laser welding is one of the newest processes. The laser was originally developed at 
the Bell Telephone Laboratories as a communications device. Because of the 
tremendous concentration of energy in a small space, it proved to be a powerful 
heat source. It has been used for cutting metals and nonmetals. Continuous pulse 
equipment is available. The laser is finding welding applications in automotive 
metalworking operations. The first automotive production application of laser

welds was conducted by General Motors, using two 1.25 KW CO2 lasers for 
welding valve assemblies used in the emission control systems. 
 
1.2.2 Robotics 
If we remember the long history of robotics there are a few things we can learn in 
order to understand our present situation. Robotics can be traced back to 270 BC, 
in ancient Greece, to the water clocks of the Civil Engineer Ctecibius. His work 
had followers like Phylo of Byzantium, author of the book “Mechanical Collection” 
(200 BC), and also Hero of Alexandria (85 BC) and Marcus Vitruvius (25 BC). In 
the twelfth century, the Arabian Badías-zaman al-Jazari (1150-1220) recollected 
some of the Greek developments in the book “The Science of the Ingenious 
Devices” [1] (Figure 1.4), and that is how they reached our time. In those early 
times the problem was about mechanics, about how to generate and transmit 
motion. So it was mainly about mechanisms, ingenious mechanical devices [1],[2]. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.5. Leonardo’s studies for a humanoid robot 
 
Then in the fifteenth century, Leonardo da Vinci showed indirectly that the 
problem at the time was mainly the lack of precision and of a permanent power 
source. He designed a lot of mechanisms to generate and transmit motion, and even 
some ways to store small amounts of mechanical energy [3]. But he didn’t have the 

14 
Welding Robots 
 
means to build those mechanisms with enough precision and there was no 
permanent power source available (pneumatic, hydraulic or electric). Maybe that 
was why he didn’t finish his robot project [1],[2], a fifteenth century knight robot 
(Figure 1.5) intended to be placed in the “Salle delle Asse” of the Sforza family 
castle (Milan, Italy). It wasn’t good enough. Or it was a so revolutionary idea for 
the time that he thought that maybe it was better to make it disappear [1],[2]. 
 
And then there was the contribution of Nicola Tesla at the turn of the nineteenth 
century. He thought of using Henrich Hertz’s discovery of radio waves (following 
the work of James Clerk Maxwell about electromagnetic phenomena) to command 
an automata. He built one (Figure 1.6) to demonstrate his ideas and presented it in 
the Madison Square Garden (New York, USA) in 1905 [1],[4]. The problem there 
was that machine intelligence was missing. Robots should be able to do pre-
programmed operations, and show some degree of autonomy in order to perform 
the desire tasks. When that became available, robots developed rapidly and the first 
industrial one appeared in the beginning of the 1970s and became a multi-million 
dollars business.

Since then, evolution was not as fantastic as it could have been, since there was a 
lot to do and the available machines were sufficiently powerful to handle the 
requested jobs. Manufacturers were more or less happy with their robots, and 
consequently industrial robots remained position controlled, somehow difficult to 
program by regular operators, and really not especially exciting machines. Features 
currently common in research laboratories hadn’t reached industry yet because of 

 
Introduction and Overview 
15 
 
some lack of interest from the robot manufacturing industry. Nevertheless, there 
was a considerable evolution that can be summarized as follows. 
 
In 1974 the first electrical drive trains were available to use as actuators for robot 
joints. In the same year the first microprocessor controlled robots were also 
available commercially.  
 
Around 1982, things like Cartesian interpolation for path planning were available 
in robot controllers, and many of them were also capable of communicating with 
other computer systems using serial and parallel interfaces. In the same year, some 
manufacturers introduced joystick control, for easier programming, and teach 
pendant menu interface. 
 
In 1984, vision guidance was introduced as a general feature being used for 
tracking, parts identification, etc. 
 
In 1986, the first digital control loops were implemented enabling better actuator 
control and enabling the use of AC drives. 
 
Networking is a feature of the 1990s with several manufacturers implementing 
networking capabilities and protocols.  
 
In 1991 there was the implementation of digital torque control loops which 
enabled, for example, the utilization of full dynamical models, which was a feature 
available in the first robots around 1994. 
 
During the period 1992-1994 several manufacturers introduced features like 
Windows-based graphical interfaces, virtual robot environments for off-line 
programming, and fieldbuses. 
 
Robot cooperation is a feature introduced from 1995 to 1996.  
 
 
 
Figure 1.7. Several current robot manipulators available on the market 
 
Around 1998 robot manufacturers started introducing collision detection to avoid 
damaging robots, and load identification to optimize robot performance. Since then 
other features include fast pick and place, weight reduction, optimized 

16 
Welding Robots 
 
programming languages, object oriented programming, remote interfaces using 
RPC sockets and TCP/IP sockets, etc.. Figure 1.7 shows some of the robot 
manipulators available currently on the market. 
 
And how do we define robotics then? Is it a science? Is it a technique or collection 
of techniques? If the reader takes a robotics book then something like this appears: 
“A robot is a re-programmable multi-functional manipulator designed to 
move materials, parts, tools, or specialized devices, through variable 
programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks”, from the 
book Robotics – Control, Sensing, Vision and Intelligence, Fu, Gonzalez, 
Lee, MacGraw Hill, 1987. 
 
Although correct, despite being restricted to robot manipulators, this definition 
does not give the correct idea. The common-sense image of a robot is usually 
associated with strong and superb machines, tireless (like Karel’s Capek 
machines), obedient (“yes, noberto san …”), but nevertheless, fascinating machines 
that make us dream. And that fascination is not in that definition. 
 
Like with everything, we should look to the past and pick what was fundamental 
for the history of robotics in terms of ideas and dreams. From the Greeks and 
Arabs we should pick the idea of “ingenious devices”. In fact, robotics is very 
much about mechanics, motion, mechanisms to transmit motion, and having the art 
and the skill to design and build those mechanisms. Yes, “ingenious devices” is 
really a good start. 
 
Then we should listen to Leonardo (sixteenth century) and look to his quest on “… 
precision …” and “…permanent power source …”. He understood that robots need 
parts built with very high precision and a permanent power source. That was not 
available at his time, i.e., machine tools and a permanent power source (electric, 
hydraulic or pneumatic). 
 
Finally, we should read Nicola Tesla and observe his outstanding and visionary 
work. He understood after all that robots are a consequence of dreams and neat 
ideas. Robots need to be controlled and programmed, distinguish situations, etc., 
have ways of “understanding”, and that means computers, electronics, software, 
and sensors, in a way to enable machines to be programmed and to sense their 
environment. Those are the elements that enable us scientists, engineers, and robot 
users, to try different things and new ideas, being a source of fascination. In his 
own words [4]: 
“… But this element I could easily embody in it by conveying to it my own 
intelligence, my own understanding. So this invention was evolved, and so a 
new art came into existence, for which the name “teleautomatics” has been 
suggested, which means the art of controlling movements and operations of 
distant automatons. 
 

 
Introduction and Overview 
17 
 
Therefore, robotics is a science of generic ingenious mechatronical devices, 
precise, powered by a permanent power source and flexible, i.e., open to new ideas 
and a stimulus to the imagination. A stimulus so strong that it attracted many of the 
best minds of our common history, i.e., authors of the work that constitutes the 
legacy that we humans leave for the future. 
 
1.3 Why to Automate Welding? 
Robot manipulators came a long way since the early days. Actually robot 
manipulators are interesting machines in terms of flexibility, programmability and 
precision. Modern manufacturing systems depend increasingly on automatic 
equipments, namely robot manipulators. This is an economic choice based on the 
following reasons: 
 
1. Robot manipulators can perform industrial tasks in a human-like manner 
with at least comparable quality for longer periods of time. 
2. Robots manipulators present the best rate between “production cost” and 
“production volume” for small/medium production volumes (Figure 1.1). 
Actually that is the case of SMEs existing in developing and developed 
countries (as an example, SMEs represent more than 95% of the companies 
in Europe). In fact, considering actual market conditions (very high 
competition, products defined in part by the customers, products with low 
life cycles, increasing demand for higher quality at lower prices, etc.) 
companies operate based on orders and never risk big stocks (besides the 
necessary security stocks) which keeps production on small/medium scale. 
3. Robot manipulators are unique flexible machines (mainly due to 
programmability) that can be adapted to perform very different tasks. 
Consequently, robot manipulators are suitable to be used with 
manufacturing setups requiring frequent task changes, which is 
fundamental to respond to market changes or to the introduction of new 
products. 
 
Let’s consider briefly an industrial solution developed recently (2004) by the first 
author. The objective is to justify the above-mentioned arguments just by 
introducing a system that takes advantage of robot manipulator capabilities and 
computer-based human-machine interfaces (HMI). The presented features are 
common to any high-demanding industrial system, namely systems requiring 
special human-machine interfaces and a semi-autonomous operation, like robotic 
welding.  
 
1.3.1 Example of an SME Based Industrial Robotic System  
The industrial robotic system presented in this section was designed to execute the 
task of removing the excess of joining PVC material from automobile glasses, 

18 
Welding Robots 
 
which arises on its borders during the glass manufacturing cycle. In fact, most of 
the automobile glasses, namely front, rear and roof glasses, are composed of two 
sheets of glass joined by a layer of PVC. For proper assembly, and to ensure proper 
joining of the PVC to the glass while maintaining transparency, the glasses go 
through a heating process, followed by a considerable period inside a pressure 
chamber. This process generates a very stiff excess of PVC on the borders of the 
glass that must be carefully removed, since it alters the dimensions of the glass, 
causing difficulties in assembling it in the car body, and can have esthetical 
implications if for some reason the glass borders are not hidden. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.8. Robotic glass deburring system 
 
Traditionally this excess of PVC is removed by hand using small cutting devices. 
Nevertheless, for highly-efficient plants this is not desirable since it slows down 
production, and requires very high concentration from operators to avoid touching 
and damaging the glass with the cutting device. Consequently, the process is very 
risky for the quality of the final product. Furthermore, with recent car designs some 
glasses are glued directly in the chassis without any exterior rubber. This happens 
mainly with roof, front and rear glasses. Consequently, the requirements for perfect 
PVC removal are even higher, which demands an automatic procedure to execute 
it. 
 
The system (Figure 1.8) designed to handle the operation described above is 
composed of [36]: 
 

 
Introduction and Overview 
19 
 
1. Two industrial robots ABB IRB6400 equipped with the S4C+ controllers. 
2. Especially designed electric-pneumatic grippers to hold firmly the glasses. 
3. Two automatic deburring belts controlled by the robot controller IO 
system. 
4. One industrial PLC (Siemens S7-300) that manages the cell logic and the 
interface to the adjacent industrial systems, providing to the robot 
controllers the necessary state information and the interface to the factory 
facilities. 
5. One personal computer to command, control and monitor the cell 
operation. 
 
Briefly the system works as follows: the first robot verifies if conveyor 1 (Figure 
1.8) is empty and loads it with a glass picked from the pallet in use. The system 
uses a rotating circular platform to hold three pallets of glasses, enabling operators 
to remove empty pallets and feed new ones without stopping production. After 
releasing the glass, the robot pre-positions to pick another glass which it does when 
the conveyor is again empty. If the working glass model requires deburring, then 
the centering device existing in the conveyor is commanded to center the glass so 
that the second robot could pick the glasses in the same position. With the glass 
firmly grasped, the deburring robot takes it to the deburring belts and extracts the 
excess of PVC by passing all the glass borders on the surface of the deburring belt. 
When the task is finished the robot delivers the glass on conveyor 2, and proceeds 
to pick another glass. The deburring velocity, pressure, trajectory, etc., is stored in 
the robot system on a database sorted by the glass model, which makes it easy to 
handle several models. Programming a new model into the system is also very 
simple and executed by an authorized operator. There is a collection of routines 
that take the robot to pre-defined positions, adjusted by the given dimensions of the 
glass, allowing the operator to adjust and tune positions and trajectories. He can 
then “play” the complete definition and repeat the teaching procedure until the 
desired behavior is obtained. This means being able to control the robot operation 
with the controller in automatic mode, which is obtained by including some teach-
pendant features in the process for operator interface. 
 
Another important feature included in this robotic system is the possibility to adjust 
production on-line, adapting to production variations. This objective is obtained by 
using a client-server architecture, which uses the cell computer (client) to 
parameterize the software running on the robot controller (server). That can be 
achieved offering the following services from the robot server to the clients: 
 
1. All planned system functionalities by means of general routines, callable from 
the remote client using variables that can be accessed remotely. 
2. Variable access services that can be used remotely to adjust and parameterize 
the operation of the robotic system. 
 
With this features implemented and with a carefully designed operator interface 
(Figure 1.9 and Figure 1.10) and robot server software, it’s possible to achieve a 
system that requires limited human intervention related with adjustment tasks to 

20 
Welding Robots 
 
cope with production variations. Since a remote interface is used (Figure 1.9 and 
Figure 1.10), the necessary adjustments are executed on-line without stopping 
production. Those operations include: 
 
1. Adjusting the deburring angle, i.e., the angle between the border of the glass 
and the deburring belt. The angle introduced is added to the programmed one, 
so that zero degrees means keeping the programmed angle unchanged. 
2. Adjusting the force on the belt during the deburring operation (adjusted by 
position). The commanded value is entered in millimeters and updates the 
actual position in the direction perpendicular to the belt and parallel to the 
surface of the glass. 
3. Adjusting the deburring speed. 
4. Maintenance procedures necessary to change the belts after the planned 
deburring cycles. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.9. Operator interface for de-palletizing robot 
 
The de-palletizing robot requires less parameterization since it executes a very 
simple operation. Besides that, the gripper adapts to the surface of every model of 
glass, using presence sensors strategically placed near two suction caps (see Figure 
1.8), with the objective of having an efficient de-palletizing operation. 
Nevertheless, the operator is able to change the velocity of the process by stating a 
slow, fast or very fast cycle to adjust to production needs, suspend and resume 

 
Introduction and Overview 
21 
 
operations, adjust the way the robot approaches the surface of the glass, etc.. These 
adjustments are necessary to obtain the most efficient operation in accordance with 
the observed production conditions, to solve daily problems and to cope with 
production variations. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.10. Operator interface for deburring robot 
 
Finally, it is important to mention that the robot is equipped with a force/torque 
sensor mounted on the wrist. The objective is to adjust automatically the model 
setup introduced by the operator, correcting the points where the measured force 
between the belt and the glass exceeds the recommended values, attempting to 
avoid damage to the glass and to increase the deburring efficiency. This procedure 
is active during the process of applying a new model, and also during production, if 
explicitly activated by the operator, constituting an automatic correcting feature.  
 
The system has worked for some time and proved to be very simple to operate 
with, showing also quick adaptation from operators [36]. The adjusting features 
added to the system proved to be very helpful, allowing the company to respond in 
a timely fashion to production changes, avoiding variations in the quality of the 
final product, and to introduce quickly new models into the production database. 
Since the models are identified automatically, using barcode readers placed on the 
pallet platform, the system works continuously without operator intervention. The 
only thing needed is to feed the system with pallets full of glasses, removing the 

22 
Welding Robots 
 
empty ones. That operation is done periodically with the help of electro-
mechanical fork-lift-trucks. 
 
Most of the features presented for this example will be explored in this book for 
robotic welding applications, namely the capacity to simulate the procedure, the 
capacity to adjust on-line and change parameterization, the capacity to monitor the 
system, the database like way of specifying sequence of operations, etc. 
 
1.3.2 Are Robots Adapted to Robotic Welding? 
From the presented example it is evident that using robots in actual manufacturing 
setups is a choice for flexibility, agility, a way to reduce cost and increase quality. 
The modern world produces a huge variety of products that include welding in 
their manufacturing processes, which means that also welding could benefit from 
the introduction of robot manipulators. But are actual robots adapted for robotic 
welding? 
 
Basically actual robot manipulators include the following features: 
 
1. Programmable control system, using powerful programming languages and 
environments. 
2. It is possible to define positions/orientations, define reference systems, 
parameterize trajectories and other actions, and play that continuously with 
high precision and repeatability. 
3. Advanced PLC capabilities are also available, namely, IO control and data 
acquisition, and several communication interfaces and protocols. These 
functionalities enable robots to coordinate actions with other equipments 
and sensors, and being integrated with other computers and manufacturing 
systems existing in the setup. 
 
The most important characteristics of actual robot manipulators are summarized in 
Table 1.1. 
 
Since most welding techniques require motion control, sensor integration and 
coordination with the welding power source (controlled using IO digital and analog 
signals, or fieldbuses), then robot manipulators are an almost perfect match for the 
vast majority of welding processes. Difficulties may also arise in automating the 
welding process, namely using robots. In fact, introducing robots means increasing 
complexity in the manufacturing process, and requires skilled personnel to handle 
programming and maintenance. That may constitute a major drawback, not 
allowing companies to take full advantage from the flexibility stored inside the 
robotic manufacturing machines. This puts focus on human-machine interfaces 
(HMI) for control, command and supervision, leaving space for the software 
architecture used to develop the HMI solutions. 
 

 
Introduction and Overview 
23 
 
In conclusion, the majority of industrial welding applications benefit from the 
introduction of robot manipulators, since most of the deficiencies, attributed to the 
human factor, are removed with advantages when robots are introduced. Also, the 
welding process is very dangerous and demanding in precision and operator 
attention, requiring substantial physical efforts from operators, which makes it a 
good candidate for robots.

1.4 Objectives and Outline of the Book 
The present book gives a detailed overview of Robotic Welding in the beginning of 
the twenty-first century. The evolution of robotic welding is presented, showing to 
the reader what were the biggest steps and developments observed in the last few 
years. This is presented with the objective of establishing the current state-of-the-
art in terms of technologies, welding systems, software and sensors. The remaining 
issues, i.e., the issues that remain open are stated clearly, in a way to motivate the 
readers to follow the rest of the book which will make contributions to clarify most 
of them and help to solve a few. 
 
To do that, a chapter on “Welding Technology” is presented, describing the most 
important welding techniques and their potential and requirements for automation 
using robot manipulators. This chapter includes established results on robotic 
welding processes, which can constitute a good source of information for readers 
and also good source of examples.  
 
Also, a revision with current research results on “Sensors for Welding Robots” 
used on robotic welding is presented in the book. That includes sensors for seam 
tracking, quality control and supervision. This chapter includes all system 
requirements necessary to use those sensors and sensing techniques with actual 
robot control systems. Hardware and software interfaces are also covered in detail. 
 
A revision of available welding systems, including hardware and software, 
clarifying their advantages, and drawbacks is also presented to give to the reader a 
clear picture of the area. This is included in the chapter “Robotic Welding: System 
Issues”.  

24 
Welding Robots 
 
Finally, a few industrial applications using the presented techniques and systems 
are presented. The book includes a chapter on “Robotic Welding: Application 
Examples”, where a few selected applications are described in detail including 
aspects related to software, hardware, system integration and industrial 
exploitation. This chapter uses actual robots, but it is presented in a general way so 
that the interested reader can easily explore his own interest. 
 
A good collection of references is also presented at the end of each chapter, to 
enable the reader to explore further from the literature.

Welding Technology 
2.1 Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) 
The gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process is based on the electric arc 
established between a non-consumable electrode of tungsten and the work-pieces 
to be joined. Part of the heat generated by the electric arc is added to the work-
pieces, promoting the formation of a weld pool. The weld pool is protected from 
air contamination by a stream of an inert gas (Ar or He) or a mixture of gases. 
 
2.1.1 Introduction 
This process is also known as tungsten inert gas (TIG), although small amounts of 
non-inert gases may be used in the shielding mixture, such as hydrogen or 
nitrogen. Figure 2.1 illustrates the principal elements of the conventional process. 
 
Autogenous GTAW welding (without filler metal) is used in thin square edged 
sections (2mm), while V and X type edge preparations are needed in thicker 
sections. In this case, the addition of filler metal is necessary. This process is 
extensively used for welding thin components of stainless steel, aluminum, 
magnesium or titanium alloys as well pieces of carbon and low alloy steels [1],[2]. 
 
Heat input in GTAW does not depend on the filler material rate. Consequently, the 
process allows a precise control of heat addiction and the production of superior 
quality welds, with low distortion and free of spatter. It is less economical than 
other consumable electrode arc welding processes, due to its lower deposition rate, 
and it is sensitive to windy environment because of the difficulty in shielding the 
weld pool. Besides it shows low tolerance to contaminants on filler or base metals.

The autogeneous process is readily used in robotics, although special techniques 
are needed when it is necessary to add filler metal to the weld pool.  
 
2.1.2 Welding Equipment 
In this section the relevant aspects related to the welding equipment used with the 
GATW process will be reviewed, with the objective of exploring the implications 
for automatic robotic welding. 
 
2.1.2.1 Power Sources 
 
Power sources for GTAW are generally of the constant current type with drooping 
volt-ampere static curves, as illustrated schematically in Figure 2.2. Light weight 
transistorized direct current power sources are currently used, being more stable 
and versatile than the old thyristor-controlled units [3]. In rectifier-inverter power 
sources the incoming AC current is rectified and then converted into AC current at 
a higher frequency than that of the mains supply, in the inverter. Afterwards high 
voltage AC current is transformed into low voltage AC current suitable for 
welding, in the transformer, and then rectified, as shown schematically in Figure 
2.3. The aim to increase the current frequency is to reduce the weight of the 
transformer and other components of the source such as inductors and capacitors.

2.1.2.2 Welding Torch 
 
The welding torch holds the non-consumable electrode, assures the transfer of 
current to the electrode and the flow of shielding gas to the weld pool. Torches 
with welding regimes up to 200 A are generally gas-cooled and those with 
continuous operation between 200 and 500 A are water-cooled. Figure 2.4 shows

Non-consumable electrodes are composed of pure tungsten or of tungsten alloys. 
Pure tungsten electrodes can be used with DC but are more sensitive to 
contamination, have lower service life-cycle and exhibit higher tip deterioration 
than alloyed electrodes. These electrodes can be used in welding of aluminum and 
magnesium alloys on AC. 
 
Thoriated tungsten (2% ThO2) electrodes are widely used in industrial applications 
due to its excellent resistance to contamination, easy arc starting and stable electric 
arc. Concerns about safety, because thorium oxide is radioactive, led to the 
development of other electrodes containing small proportions (around 2%) of 
simple earth rare elements such as lanthanum, yttrium and cerium or even mixtures 

30 
Welding Robots 
 
of several elements [4],[5]. These electrodes have better operational characteristics 
than thoriated electrodes and can be used in welding carbon and stainless steels, 
nickel and titanium alloys. Zirconiated tungsten electrodes are excellent for AC 
due to its good arc starting, high resistance to contamination and small tip shape 
deterioration. 
 
 
Figure 2.4. Exploded view of a torch: back cap – 1; electrode – 2; collet – 3; handle – 4; 
collet body – 5; nozzle – 6 
 
These electrodes are available in diameters between 0.5 and 12 mm, although the 
most usual are up to 4 mm in diameter, being the normal length between 50 and 
175 mm. The selection of the electrode diameter to use depends on the plate 
thickness to be welded, being in general similar to plate thickness. 
 
2.1.2.4 Arc Striking Techniques 
 
Arc initiation by touch striking was used formerly in manual GTAW, but this 
technique is very sensitive to tungsten contamination, adversely affecting the 
service life of the electrode. High-frequency-high-voltage (e.g. 3 kV at 5 MHz) 
supplies are currently used in arc striking and AC arc stabilization in manual 
GTAW systems [3]. This arc starting technique usually produces interference in 
electronic equipment in the vicinity of the power source. 
 
Programmed touch striking is an alternative technique developed for automatic 
systems. In this technique current and voltage are limited when electrode touches 
in the work-piece, in order to prevent electrode contamination. A pilot arc starting 
can also be used to initiate the main electric arc, though a more complex torch is 
needed.

 2.1.2.5 Shielding Gas Regulator 
 
The regulator is a device that reduces source gas pressure to a constant working 
pressure, independently of source pressure variations. Pressure reduction can be 
made in one or two stages. Regulators in two stages give in general more stable 
output flow. 
 
2.1.3 Process Parameters 
In this section the relevant parameters for the GTAW process will be reviewed 
with the double objective of presenting them and showing that they can certainly 
be used for automatic robotic welding. 
 
2.1.3.1 Current 
 
Current has direct influence on weld bead shape, on welding speed and quality of 
the weld. Most GTAW welds employ direct current on electrode negative (DCEN) 
(straight polarity) because it produces higher weld penetration depth and higher 
travel speed than on electrode positive (DCEP) (reverse polarity). Besides, reverse 
polarity produces rapid heating and degradation of the electrode tip, because anode 
is more heated than cathode in gas tungsten electric arc.

Figure 2.5. Effect of current and polarity on weld bead shape 
 

32 
Welding Robots 
 
Reverse polarity may be of interest in welding aluminum alloys because of the 
cathodic cleaning action of negative pole in the work-piece, that is the removal of 
the refractory aluminum oxide layer. However alternating current is better adapted 
to welding of aluminum and magnesium alloys, because it allows balancing 
electrode heating and work-piece cleaning effects. Weld penetration depth obtained 
with AC is between depth obtained with DCEN and DCEP, as illustrated in Figure 
2.5. 
 
Square wave AC is nowadays being used instead of the normal sine wave because 
it facilitates the assistance of the arc re-strike each half cycle and allows adjusting 
of the arc cleaning effect or the penetration depth. Cleaning action is improved by 
increasing duration of the electrode positive half cycle. The increase in penetration 
depth is given by increasing the duration of the electrode negative half cycle, as 
shown schematically in Figure 2.6.

Pulsed DC current with low-frequency (1-10 Hz) is being used to reduce weld 
distortion, to improve tolerance to joint preparation and to cast-to-cast variations. 
Current magnitude and duration of the pulses are determined by material family 
and thickness of the component to be welded and are related by Equation 2.1 [3],

where, Ip is the pulse current, tp is the pulse time and K is a constant. Background 
current and time are selected in order to allow solidification of metal between 
pulses. This current is used in welding of stainless steels. 
 
High-frequency pulsed current (5-30 kHz) improves arc stiffness, increasing 
penetration depth and maximum welding speed and decreasing formation of 
porosity in the weld metal. This current is advantageous in automatic welding 
applications. 
 

 
Welding Technology 
33 
 
2.1.3.2 Welding Speed 
 
The effect of increasing the welding speed for the same current and voltage is to 
reduce the heat input. The welding speed does not influence the electromagnetic 
force and the arc pressure because they are dependent on the current. The weld 
speed increase produces a decrease in the weld cross section area, and 
consequently penetration depth (D) and weld width (W) also decrease, but the D/W 
ratio has a weak dependence on travel speed [7]. These results suggest that the 
travel speed does not influence the mechanisms involved in the weld pool 
formation, it only influences the volume of melted material. Normal welding 
speeds are from 100 to 500 mm/min depending on current, material type and plate 
thickness.  
 
2.1.3.3 Arc Length 
 
The arc length is the distance between the electrode tip and the work-piece. The arc 
length in GTAW is usually from 2 to 5 mm. If the arc length increases, the voltage 
to maintain the arc stability must increase, but the heat input to work-piece 
decreases due to radiation losses from the column of the arc. Consequently, weld 
penetration and cross section area of melted material decrease with increasing arc 
length. 
 
2.1.3.4 Shielding Gases 
 
Shielding gases are used in GTAW in order to prevent atmospheric contamination 
of the weld metal. This contamination can produce porosity, weld cracking, scaling 
and even change in the chemical composition of melted material. Besides shielding 
gas also has a large influence on the stability of the electric arc. Gases with low 
ionization potential facilitate the ignition of the electric arc and those with low 
thermal conductivity tend to increase the arc stability. 
 
Argon is the most used GTAW shielding gas. It has low ionization potential and is 
heavier than air, providing an excellent shielding of the molten weld pool. 
Furthermore it is less expensive than helium, the other inert shielding gas used in 
the process. Argon is used in welding of carbon and stainless steels and low 
thickness aluminum alloys components.  
 
For welding thick aluminum work-pieces and other high-conductive materials, 
such as copper alloys, helium is recommended because it has higher ionization 
potential than argon, needing higher voltage for arc initiation and maintenance, but 
producing higher heat-input. Helium or helium/argon (30-80% He) mixtures allow 
increased welding speed and improved process tolerance.  
 
Mixtures of argon with up to 5% of hydrogen are frequently used in welding of 
austenitic stainless steels. Hydrogen increases arc-voltage and consequently heat-

34 
Welding Robots 
 
input, increasing weld penetration and weld travel speed, as well improving weld 
appearance [6]. Argon/hydrogen mixtures are also used in welding of copper-
nickel alloys. 
 
Argon is also used as back side shielding gas, mainly in welding of stainless steels, 
aluminum alloys and reactive metals. 
 
Flow rates of shielding gases depend on weld thickness, being 4-10 l/min for argon 
and 10-15 l/min for helium, because it is lighter than argon, and consequently less 
effective in shielding. 
 
Gases with a purity of 99.995% are used in welding most of the metals, though 
reactive materials such as titanium need contaminant level less than 50 ppm. 
 
2.1.3.5 Filler Metals 
 
Filler metals are generally used for plate thickness above 2 mm, having chemical 
composition similar to that of the parent material. Filler metal diameter is between 
1.6 and 3.2 mm and in automatic systems is normally added cold from a roll or a 
coil. 
 
2.1.3.6 Electrode Vertex Angle 
 
The non-consumable electrode angle influences the weld penetration depth and the 
weld shape [7]. Electrode angles between 30º and 120º are used. Small angles 
increase arc pressure and penetration depth but have high tip shape deterioration. 
Electrode angles from 60º to 120º maintain tip shape for longer periods and give 
welds with adequate penetration depth-to-width ratio. 
 
2.1.3.7 Cast-to-cast Variation 
 
Cast-to-cast variation refers to variation observed in penetration of welds produced 
in the same welding conditions in several batches of austenitic stainless steel with 
nominally identical composition. These changes in the weld bead shape are 
attributed to variation in proportion of trace elements in the material, such as 
sulphur, calcium and oxygen. Variations in trace elements seem to affect surface 
tension and metal flow into the pool [8]. Weld pool shape is also affected by 
electromagnetic forces, arc pressure and thermo capillarity forces [9]. To minimize 
this problem several strategies have been adopted such as the use of higher currents 
or of pulsed current, the application of adequate shielding gases or the application 
on plate surface of flux coatings containing active ingredients [10].  
 

 
Welding Technology 
35 
 
2.1.4 Process Variants 
GTAW is regarded as a high quality process for welding thin metals using low 
travel speed and low electrode deposition rate, requiring highly skilled personnel in 
manual welding. Variants developed seek to improve productivity, mainly 
deposition rate, penetration depth and welding speed. These variants are 
implemented in automatic or robotic systems. 
 
Hot-wire GTAW is a variant where a heated filler wire is fed to the rear of the 
melted weld pool at a constant rate, as represented schematically in Figure 2.7. 
Filler wire is resistance heated close to melting point using mainly AC power 
sources, in order to minimize magnetic disturbance of the electric arc. Deposition 
rates up to 14 kg/h can be attained with this process. It has been used in heavy wall 
fabrication, maintaining high joint integrity [11].  
 
The use of a dual-shielding GTAW technique, see Figure 2.8, where an additional 
concentric gas shield gives an increase in constriction and stiffness of the electric 
arc, may be used to increase welding speed and penetration depth [12]. 
Constriction of the arc is produced by the external cold gas flow which decreases 
temperature of the outer part of the arc, decreasing the arc cross section where 
current flow occurs, consequently increasing current density and temperature. 
Electrode gas and annular gas may be of the same or of different compositions, 
such as Argon plus 5% hydrogen for internal gas and argon for external gas when 
welding austenitic stainless steels. For currents above 335A keyhole welding is 
obtained and the process may becomes sensitive to the process parameters. This 
technique also tends to increase the risk of undercut [3].

Very high currents (I ! 300 A) may also be used in a conventional automated 
GTAW process to increase the penetration depth, but defects may form and the 
process becomes unstable above 500 A. The keyhole mode gas tungsten arc 
welding process, which was developed a few years ago, seems to be suitable for 
ferrous and non-ferrous materials in the range from 3 to 12 mm [13]. However, this 
keyhole technique is extremely sensitive to arc voltage, and loss of material may 
occur through the keyhole vent. 
 
2.2 Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) 
In the gas-metal arc welding (GMAW) process n electric arc is established between 
a consumable electrode, fed continuously to the weld pool, and the work-piece. 
Initially the weld pool was shielded by an inert gas, giving the process the popular 
designation of metal inert gas (MIG). Nowadays active gases such as carbon 
dioxide or mixtures of inert and active gases are also used and metal-active gas 
(MAG) is a common process nomenclature in this case. The designation GMAW 
includes all these cases. A schematic representation of the process is shown in 
Figure 2.9.

2.2.1 Introduction 
This process is widely used in industrial applications due to its numerous benefits. 
It can weld almost all metallic materials, in a large range of thicknesses (above 1 
mm up to 30 mm or more) and is effective in all positions. GMAW is a very 
economic process because it has higher speeds and higher deposition rates than for 
example the manual metal arc process, and does not require frequent stops to 
change electrodes, as is the case of this former process. In addition, minimal post 
weld cleaning is needed because slag is almost absent. Less operator skill is 
required than for other conventional processes because electrode wire is fed 
automatically (semi-automatic process) and a self-adjustment mechanism 
maintains the arc length approximately constant even when the distance weld torch 
to work-piece varies within certain limits. These advantages make the process very 
well adapted to be automated and particularly to robotic welding applications. 
 
The process is sensitive to the effects of wind, which can disperse the shielding 
gas, and it is difficult to use in narrow spaces due to the torch size. Problems such 
as lack of shielding, irregular wire feeding, unstable arc, burn-back or even weld 
discontinuities 
(porosity, 
incomplete 
penetration, 
excessive 
melt-through, 
undercutting or cracks) can occur during welding [14].

Welding Robots 
 
2.2.2 Welding Equipment 
Basic equipment for conventional GMAW is consists of the power source, the 
electrode feed unit, the welding torch and the shielding gas regulator, as 
represented schematically in Figure 2.9. 
 
2.2.2.1 Power Source 
 
Most common GMAW power sources are of the inverter type with an architecture 
similar to that represented in Figure 2.3, but providing a constant-voltage output. A 
constant-voltage power source used in conjunction with a constant speed wire 
feeder can provide self-adjustment and stabilization of the arc length, in order to 
compensate for the variations in the torch to work-piece distance that occur mainly 
during manual welding operations. In a power source with approximately constant-
voltage characteristics any change in the arc length is compensated by the 
modification of the weld current and consequently of the burn-off behavior of the 
electrode. Figure 2.10 illustrates the effect of increasing the arc length from L1 to 
L2, which corresponds to an increase of the torch to work-piece distance. This 
increase of arc length produces an increase of the arc voltage and consequently a 
decrease of the weld current from I1 to I2 and of the burn-off rate from B1 to B2. As 
the wire feed speed is constant and burn-off decreases the arc tends to assume the 
initial length. 
 
In addition these machines provide slope control of the power source 
characteristics and of the inductance in order to control spatter in short-circuiting 
transfer [3]. Inductances introduced in the output circuit reduce the rate of rise of 
current during the short-circuiting, reducing in this way the risk of explosion of 
metal droplets. In the case of thicker electrodes, which show a small variation of 
burn-off rate with current, or for materials having high conductivity, such as 
aluminum, process control is achieved by using a variable-speed wire feed unit that 
reacts to the arc length changes by adjusting the electrode feed speed. 
 
GMAW inverters are also used to generate pulsed current with pulsed repetition 
rates (PRR) (number of pulses per second) typically between 100 and 200 PRRs 
[15]. Pulsed parameters are defined by algorithms in the controller. New synergic 
pulsed GMAW inverters can control melting rate through the modulation of the 
pulse shape and of the pulse frequency, being the process managed by a 
microprocessor [3].

2.2.2.2 Electrode Feed Unit 
 
The electrode feed unit and the welding control mechanism are generally furnished 
in one integrated package. The electrode feed unit pulls the electrode from the reel 
and pushes it through a conduit to the welding torch (gun). This unit is composed 
of a direct-current motor, that varies the motor speed over a large range, a gear box 
and two pairs of rolls with a pressure adjusting screw and wire guides, that transmit 
mechanical energy , straighten and guide the electrode. Knurled rolls are used for 
hard materials, such as steel electrodes, and V and U type rolls are used for softer 
materials, such as aluminum electrodes. For soft electrodes or long conduits push-
pull systems can be used too. Theses systems are composed of two feed units, one 
that is close to the wire reel that pushes the electrode, and the other unit in the torch 
that pulls the electrode. In automatic and robotic welding systems the electrode is 
fed from a spool (15-18 kg) or large drum (200-475 kg) to minimize wire supply 
changing. Normally, the electrode feeder for robotic welding is mounted separate 
from the power supply. 
 
The welding control mechanism regulates not only the electrode feed speed and the 
start and stop of the electrode but also the delivery of shielding gas, current and 
cooling water (when necessary) to the torch. Creep start, gas pre-flow and post-
flow, hot start, crater filling and adjustable burn-back time can frequently be 

40 
Welding Robots 
 
programmed in this unit. Memory for pre-programs and for set parameters is 
frequently available in this unit. 
 
When the torch cable is externally attached to the robot arm it is exposed to work-
piece interference and to premature wear. Modern robotic systems can include 
special arms with internal cabling, in order to prevent interference, increasing cable 
life. 
 
2.2.2.3 Welding Torch 
 
Main functions of the welding torch are to furnish the electrode with electrical 
current and direct the electrode and gas flow to the work-piece. Main components 
of the welding torch are the contact tube, where the current is transmitted to the 
electrode, the nozzle, which provides a laminar gas flow to the weld pool, the torch 
switch, which sends signals to the feed unit, and the handle. The handle supports 
the gas and water (if necessary) tubes, the electrode guide tube and cables for 
current and signals. MIG torches for low current and light duty cycle (up to 60%) 
are gas cooled and torches for heavy duty cycle (up to 100%) and high current are 
water cooled. Robotic torches are in general water cooled, but if gas cooled torches 
are used they must be larger than manual torches. Alternatively air cooled torches, 
which use shop compressed air, can be applied instead of water cooled torches 
[16]. Robotic torches usually have emergency-stop capability to prevent damage to 
the robot arm and the welding torch in the event of a collision. They are also 
provided with automatic cleaning, that may include a pressurized air system for 
blowing spatter out of the nozzle, a reamer for cleaning the internal nozzle 
structure and an anti-spatter fluid delivery system.  
 
Twin-wire GMA robotic welding torches can be used to reach higher deposition 
rate and welding speed. In this case a side-by-side configuration is used, with both 
wires being fed to close contact tips, in order to give a single weld pool. 
 
2.2.3 Process Parameters 
Welding parameters affect the way the electrode is transferred to the work-piece, 
the arc stability, spatter generation, weld bead geometry and overall weld quality. 
The main parameters of the process are current, voltage, travel speed, electrode 
extension and electrode diameter, though others, such as electrode orientation, 
electrode composition and shielding gas, also have direct influence on the metal 
transfer mechanisms. These parameters are not independent. The current and 
voltage, for example, are correlated by the arc characteristic curves shown in 
Figure 2.10; voltage depends not only of the arc length but also on the electrode 
extension and on the shielding gas. 
 

 
Welding Technology 
41 
 
2.2.3.1 Current 
 
Direct current electrode positive (DCEP) is the most used current in GMAW 
because it gives stable electric arc, low spatter, good weld bead geometry and the 
greatest penetration depth. 
 
For low currents and voltages in combination with active shielding gases or 
mixtures containing active gases, dip or short-circuiting transfer is obtained. Metal 
is transferred to the work-piece by bridging at frequencies usually above 100 Hz. 
This metal transfer mode gives low heat input, being suited for welding thin 
sections and for positional welding. 
 
Globular transfer is obtained for currents and voltages somewhat above those of 
the dip transfer, if inert shielding gases are used. When carbon dioxide shielding 
gas is used this metal transfer mode is obtained only for high currents and voltages. 
Globular transfer is characterized by large drops, with size identical to the 
electrode diameter or higher, transferred at low frequency. This mode of transfer 
can be used in a downward direction, due to the predominance of gravitational 
forces during metal transfer.  
 
The utilization of relatively low current can give insufficient penetration and 
excessive weld reinforcement, occasioned by poor wetting action of the weld 
metal. Globular repelled transfer can be found when electrode negative polarity is 
used with solid wire, but this mode of transfer has no industrial application due to 
poor stability and high spatter levels which result. 
 
For currents and voltages higher than for globular transfer, projected spray transfer 
occurs when argon-rich shielding is used. It arises for currents above spray 
transition current, which depends on the electrode material, shielding gas and 
electrode diameter. It is approximately 240 A for 1.2 mm diameter carbon steel 
electrodes with argon/5% CO2 shielding [3]. This mode of transfer is characterized 
by very small drops projected onto the work-piece at a very high frequency, up to 
350 drops per second, presenting low spatter level. As high currents are used high 
heat inputs to the work-pieces are reached, producing large weld pools with deep 
penetration. This type of metal transfer is attractive when high deposition rate 
welds in thick materials in a downward direction are to be performed. However it 
presents limited capacity in positional welds, due to the effect of gravity forces. 
For even higher currents and voltages, streaming spray transfer is obtained, but it 
has no industrial application due to high weld pool turbulence caused by the 
increase of the electromagnetic forces.  
 
Drop spray transfer mode can occur in the transition between globular and 
projected spray transfer, in a restricted operating range. This metal transfer mode is 
characterized by a very efficient detachment of small drops from the electrode, 
which are projected onto the work-piece at high velocity and with low spatter level. 
This type of transfer is difficult to regulate in conventional DC power sources but 
can be achieved using pulsed transfer techniques. 

42 
Welding Robots 
 
Pulsed current allows projected spray transfer for mean currents below spray 
transition current, improving positional capabilities and operating tolerances of the 
process. Details concerning the control of the metal transfer modes in the arc are 
given in Chapter 3. 
 
2.2.3.2 Voltage 
 
Arc voltage is directly related to current, as indicated above, and with arc length, 
increasing with it. Voltage also depends on the shielding gas and electrode 
extension. The increase of arc voltage widens and flattens the weld bead. Low 
voltages increase the weld reinforcement and excessively high voltages can cause 
arc instability, spatter, porosity and even undercut. 
 
2.2.3.3 Welding Speed 
 
Increase in the welding speed gives a decrease in the linear heat input to the work-
piece and the filler metal deposition rate per unit of length. The initial increase in 
welding speed can cause some increase in penetration depth, because the arc acts 
more directly in the parent material, but further increase in speed decreases 
penetration and can cause undercut, due to insufficient material to fill the cavity 
produced by the arc. 
 
2.2.3.4 Electrode Extension 
 
The electrode extension is the electrode length that is out of the contact tube. The 
increase of electrode extension, produced by the increase of the torch distance to 
the work-piece for a specific parameters set, increases electrode melting rate 
because of the Joule effect. Electrode extension ranges from 5 to 15 mm for dip 
transfer, being higher (up to 25 mm) for the other transfer modes. 
 
2.2.3.5 Shielding Gas 
 
Shielding gases have an effect on arc stability, metal transfer mode, weld bead 
shape and melting rate. Gases used in GMAW can be pure gases, binary, ternary 
and exceptionally quaternary mixtures. Common pure gases are argon, helium and 
carbon dioxide. The first two are inert gases and are used principally in welding of 
light alloys, nickel, copper and reactive materials. Helium has a higher ionization 
potential than argon, providing larger weld pools, but is more expensive. Carbon 
dioxide is an active gas and is used in welding of carbon steels. It produces high 
levels of spatter but provides high penetration depth.

Binary mixtures are commonly argon/carbon dioxide (up to 20% CO2), 
argon/oxygen (up to 5% O2) and argon/helium (up to 75% He). The first is used in 
the welding of carbon and low alloy steels, the second of stainless steels and the 
third of nonferrous materials. The addition of oxygen or carbon dioxide to argon 
stabilizes the welding arc and changes the bead shape [17], as illustrated in Figure 
2.11. The objective of adding helium to argon is to increase heat input and 
consequently welding speed, but also to reduce the incidence of weld porosity. 
 
The most common ternary mixtures are argon/oxygen/carbon dioxide, used in 
welding of carbon steels, argon/helium/carbon dioxide and argon/carbon 
dioxide/hydrogen, used in welding stainless steels. Ternary mixtures are intended 
for improving weld bead profile, increasing tolerance to material contamination 
and promoting higher travel speeds. 
 
2.2.3.6 Electrode Diameter 
 
Chemical composition of the electrodes is similar to that of the materials being 
welded. Most usual electrode diameters are 0.8, 1, 1.2 and 1.6 mm. Electrodes of 
lower diameter are used for thin materials. Electrodes of 1.2 and 1.6 mm diameters 
are utilized in welding thicker materials and need higher currents, which produce 
larger weld pools. Electrodes of 1.6 mm diameter are not recommended for 
positional applications. 
 
2.2.4 Process Variants 
Flux cored arc welding (FCAW) is a process similar to GMAW but uses a tubular 
flux cored electrode as the consumable instead of a solid electrode, as shown in 
Figure 2.12. Flux has several functions which are deoxidization, alloying, gas 
generation and formation of a protective slag. The process has two variants, these 
being the gas-shielding FCAW process, that uses an external shielding gas to assist 
in shielding the arc and the weld pool from the air, and the self-shielded FCAW 
process that works without external shielding. Flux-cored electrodes offer several 
advantages such as higher deposition rate than solid electrodes, because of higher 
current density of tubular electrodes, alloying addition from the flux, slag shielding 
and improved arc stabilization, more tolerance to rust and scale than conventional 
process and the need for less skilled personnel.

electrodes – b, c and d 
 
The main limitations of flux-cored electrodes are the large quantity of fumes 
generated, which is potentially toxic, and the need for removing slag, particularly 
in multipass welds. Flux–cored electrodes are more expensive than solid electrodes 
but the difference in cost of the consumable is compensated by the decrease in 
labor costs because they have higher burn-off rate than solid electrodes. 
 
Flux-cored electrodes of 1 and 1.2 mm diameter can be used in positional work in 
contrast to electrodes of 1.6, 2.4 and 3.2 mm that must be used in flat and 
horizontal positions. In the last few years electrodes have been developed mainly 
for welding carbon and low alloy steels as well as for stainless steels and for 
hardfacing applications. For steels, CO2 and argon/CO2 mixtures are used as 
shielding gases. 
 
Constant-voltage direct current machines are recommended for FCAW processes, 
though output rates should be higher than for conventional process. For semi-
automatic process outputs, between 400 and 600 A are recommended while for 
mechanized and robotic systems power sources with outputs, up to 1000 A may be 
required for some applications. Knurled feed rollers are generally used to feed 
flux-cored electrodes in order to avoid crushing the electrode, even when using low 
pressure. Water-cooled torches are used mainly in automatic and robotic welding 
for currents above 300 A when argon-rich shielding mixtures are used. 
 
MIG/MAG tandem and multi wire welding can give a significant increase in 
welding speed and disposition rate and also influence the weld geometry [19]. 
 
The GMAW process can be used in combination with other welding processes 
such as plasma arc welding (PAW) or laser welding (LW) to improve deposition 
rate, welding speed, flexibility and productivity [20],[21]. Limitations of these 
processes are the high capital cost and complexity in setting optimal welding 
parameters. 
 
The AC pulsed GMA process is currently under development for robotic welding 
applications. It is well suited to the welding of aluminum alloys, giving high-
quality and productivity in welding of thin-sheet joints. Moreover it extends the 
root opening tolerance and reduces work-piece distortion, during the welding cycle 
[58].

2.3 Laser Beam Welding (LBW) 
A laser consists of a high-power coherent monochromatic light beam which can be 
focused to a small spot, producing a very high energy density. Laser is the acronym 
for “light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation”. A laser beam is 
produced by stimulating emission of electromagnetic radiation in specific solid or 
gaseous materials. Atoms of these materials are moved to higher energy levels by 
absorbing stimulating energy, producing a population inversion, that is material is 
brought into a condition in which population of atoms at a higher energy level is 
greater than that at lower level. These atoms decay by spontaneous emission of 
photons, which can generate more photons by stimulating emission from other 
excited atoms, producing the amplification of the laser light. Laser light sources 
have reflecting mirrors incorporated (see Figure 2.13) which reflect photons back 
for further light amplification. 
 
2.3.1 Introduction 
The most popular lasers for welding are the solid-state lasers of neodymium-doped 
yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), generally pulsed wave, and the gas lasers of 
continuous-wave carbon dioxide (CO2), whose lasing medium is a mixture of 
carbon dioxide, nitrogen and helium. Power density of laser welding (109-1011 
Wm-2) is significantly higher than that of arc welding processes (106-108 Wm-2), 
though somewhat lower than electron beam welding (1011-1013 Wm-2) [3]. 
 
The beam energy delivered to the work-piece will be dissipated by reflection and 
absorption. Work-piece material is heated to a very high temperature, melted and 
may even vaporize due to very high power density concentrated in the focus of 
laser beam. Two modes of laser welding can be obtained, the heat conduction-
mode and the deep-penetration mode, depending on the power density in use [22]. 
Heat conduction-mode is obtained for low power density, where most of the beam 
energy is lost by reflection (up to 90%), and it is characterized by the formation of 
a wide and shallow weld pool, see Figure 2.14 a). Power density is sufficient to 
melt the material but it is not enough to vaporize it, the weld pool shape being 
controlled by surface tension and thermocapillary forces [23]. This technique is 
used for welding small components for the electronics industry or for small 
medical parts.

For power densities above a critical threshold of about 1010 Wm-2 the laser beam 
causes melting and vaporization of metal, creating a keyhole in the work-piece, as 
shown in Figure 2.14 b). The keyhole and plasma generated aid the adsorption of 
energy by the work-piece and the distribution of heat deep in the material. Metal 
vapor continuously generated tends to maintain the keyhole while metal flow and 

 
Welding Technology 
47 
 
surface tension tend to obliterate it. As the laser beam advances it creates a channel 
and material solidifies behind it. This is the deep-penetration mode laser welding, 
which produces a narrow and deep welding seam. This welding mode is commonly 
applied for welding thick materials (up to 50 mm) at high travel speed [22], 
without filler metal, though filler electrodes can also be used to fill gaps. 
 
The laser welding process provides a high energy density beam that can be used at 
room atmosphere to produce precise welds at high speed, even in difficult-to-weld 
materials, such as titanium. Added to this, welds are deep and narrow, with small 
heat affected zones, giving low distortion, and almost no post processing is 
necessary [29]. Main limitations of laser welding are the need for accurate part fit-
up and precise part positioning as well as equipment capital cost that is ten times 
more expensive than arc welding systems of identical power. In addition the 
process is dependent on the material’s light absorptivity and surface condition and 
it is susceptible to weld porosity, solidification cracking and bead geometric 
defects, mainly in aluminum alloys. 
 
2.3.2 Welding Equipment 
The welding equipment includes several types of lasers used in welding. In the 
following, solid-state lasers and gas lasers will be considered. 
 
2.3.2.1 Solid-state Lasers 
 
Solid-state lasers used in welding are of the ruby type, composed of a ruby crystal 
containing a concentration of 0.05% chromium, or of Nd:YAG type, made of a 
solid yttrium aluminum garnet rod doped with neodymium. Excitation of electrons 
in neodymium is done with high-power xenon flash lamps (1-4 kV), as represented 
schematically in Figure 2.15. This process is known as pumping. Diode lasers are 
frequently used as the pumping source instead of flash lamps, in order to improve 
pumping efficiency. Pumping energy is amplified within the crystal, commonly 
designated as cavity, which contains a fully reflecting mirror at one end and a 
partially reflecting mirror at the other. After amplification of radiation the laser 
beam is radiated from the partially reflecting end, with 1.064 Pm wavelength. 
Because of the limited capacity of cooling systems to maintain a threshold 
temperature of the crystal Nd:YAG lasers are commercially available up to 6 kW 
average power, though conventional systems have generally up to 1000 W average 
power, with a maximum pulse power of 5 to 20 kW, a pulsing rate up to 400 pulses 
per second and a beam parameter of 25 (mm × mrad) or lower.  
 
Commercial solid state lasers with high pulse power are capable of simultaneous 
welding at several different locations. The weld point diameter can also be adjusted 
by the processing optics at a constant working distance of 0.1 to 2 mm, and the 
welding depth can be controlled via the laser parameters up to 2 mm. 
 

48 
Welding Robots 
 
The Laser beam can also be transmitted through fiber optics which leads to several 
advantages, such as improved flexibility of laser systems and reduced need for 
accurate mirror alignment.

2.3.2.2 Gas Lasers 
 
Gas lasers have several characteristics different from solid lasers. The radiation 
wavelength of CO2 lasers is 10.6 Pm and the transmission of the laser beam is 
made by reflection using mirrors. They can be used in pulsed or continuous modes, 
in a power range up to 25 kW, though lower powers are more usual. 
 
Axial flow CO2 lasers are composed basically of a laser tube where the gas mixture 
flows, the front and rear mirrors and the radio frequency electrodes for excitation 
of the laser gas. The rear mirror is fully reflecting, opposite to the front mirror 
where a partially reflecting window exists. Windows of germanium or gallium 
arsenide are used in order to transmit laser beam without significant loss. The most 
usual laser gas mixtures are composed of carbon dioxide (5%), nitrogen (15%) and 
helium (80%) or oxygen (3.5%), carbon dioxide (4%), nitrogen (31.5%) and 
helium (61%). The gas mixture must be water cooled, because an increase in gas 
mixture temperature can cause decomposition of carbon dioxide and a decrease in 
efficiency of the laser. These lasers are called slow axial-flow lasers and are 
limited to small powers (500 W). In modern laser systems the heat generated in the 
gas is dissipated by the water-cooled electrodes (diffusion-cooled). A beam 
shaping module is integrated into the laser head and produces a high quality round 
symmetrical beam. The resonator design produces a 45° linearly polarized beam 
[29]. Output power up to 4.5 kW can be obtained with these lasers.

In fast axial-flow lasers gas in the laser tube is re-circulated at high speed by 
blowers or turbines and heat removed by a heat exchanger. These lasers are 
composed of several optical units in series, in order to increase output power, with 
the optical resonator being folded several times to obtain a more compact system. 
The laser beam is transmitted between optical units by intermediate mirrors. 
Output powers up to 5 kW can be obtained with this type of laser. 
 
In transverse-flow lasers gas is circulated into the discharge region transversely 
across the line of discharge by a tangential blower, being cooled by a heat 
exchanger, see Figure 2.16. This arrangement results in compact lasers, allowing 
shorter resonant cavities and higher outputs than axial-flow lasers. Power outputs 
up to 8 kW can be obtained with these lasers. Most of these lasers can be used with 
either continuous wave or pulsed wave, with variable pulse frequency between 0 
and 100 kHz. 
 
2.3.3 Process Parameters 
Primary parameters of laser welding are the beam power, the beam diameter and 
travel speed, though other aspects, such as the control of plasma formation, the 
welding gases and the absorptivity of the parent material, can have drastic effect on 
weld penetration depth and on metallurgical changes in the weld. 
 
 
 

50 
Welding Robots 
 
2.3.3.1 Beam Power and Beam Diameter 
 
Penetration depth increases almost linearly with increase of power density, for a 
specific diameter of the laser beam. Power density depends on the power of the 
laser beam and on the focus cross section area. Beam diameter is very small and it 
is difficult to evaluate because energy in the beam normally has a Gaussian 
distribution. This distribution is designated as the transverse electromagnetic 
mode00 or TEM00. Conventional definition of the beam diameter is based on the 
diameter where power density is 1/e2 of maximum power in central part. The circle 
defined in this way contains 86.5% of the total beam energy [3]. Other beam 
energy distributions may be observed, such as doughnut distributions, but they are 
not beneficial for welding operations because of the decrease of coherence of the 
beam. 
 
2.3.3.2 Focus Characterization 
 
Focus is basically characterized by the minimum focal spot size (dmin) and the 
focus depth (Z). Focal spot size is relevant to the determination of power density 
and its theoretical value can be determined by Equation 2.2, where f is the focal 
length of the focusing optics, Ȝ is the wave length of the laser beam and D is the 
diameter of the unfocused beam, as illustrated in Figure 2.17. Frequently focused 
beam diameter is larger due to imperfections of the focusing optics [24].

Focus depth is defined, according to Laser Institute of America, as the distance in 
which focus spot radius is increased by 5%. Focus depth can be estimated by 
Equation 2.3, where F equals fȜ of the optic system:

Focus depth increases with increase of the F number of the focusing optics but 
focus diameter also increases, decreasing power density. Focus depth is important 
when welding thin components because thermal distortion can put beam focus out 
of these components. 
 
The position of focus has great influence on quality of welds produced. If focus is 
well above the surface of the work-piece, welds show a nail head appearance and 
little penetration is obtained. When focus is positioned deep below the work-piece 
surface V-shaped welds result and a more accurate setting of the components is 
needed. Optimum focus positioning is below the work-piece surface but distance is 
a function of plate thickness and beam power.

2.3.3.3 Travel Speed 
 
The increase of travel speed decreases penetration depth for both argon and helium 
shielding gases. This is because power input per unit length decreases with welding 
speed increase and keyhole may not be completely effective in trapping incident 
radiation. Very high speeds can give lack of fusion while low speeds may originate 
excessive parent material melt, vaporization and even defects formation. For very 
low speeds a reduction in penetration may be observed. This is attributed to the 
formation of a cloud of plasma, which attenuates the incident laser beam. 
 
2.3.3.4 Plasma Formation 
 
For power densities above 1010 Wm-2 in CO2 lasers and 1012 Wm-2 in YAG lasers, 
the beam interacts with metal vapor and shielding gas, producing a cloud of plasma 
above the plate surface. During the initial moments of keyhole formation, plasma 
may assist the energy transfer to the work-piece. However, subsequently, plasma 
may limit beam energy transfer to the work-piece [25]. Several techniques have 
been developed to reduce plasma formation or to remove it from the weld zone. 
Pulsing laser power at high frequencies (above 1 kHz) is effective in reducing 
plasma formation in CO2 lasers. In addition plasma is generally removed from the 

52 
Welding Robots 
 
vicinity of the beam by an auxiliary jet of helium or argon. Assisting gas must be 
directed to 1 mm ahead of the beam, at an angle of approximately 20 degrees with 
the work-piece surface. Helium is preferred, because it has a higher ionization 
potential than argon, being more resistant to plasma formation. Beam interaction 
with the work-piece can also be improved by the combination of linear oscillation 
of the beam in welding direction with the jet of an inert gas [3]. 
 
2.3.3.5 Welding Gases 
 
In laser welding two gases are commonly needed, the assisting gas to remove 
plasma, which is injected laterally, and a coaxial shielding gas to prevent 
atmospheric contamination. A root gas is also needed in keyhole welds where all 
the material thickness is melted. Helium and mixtures of argon and helium are used 
as welding gases. Argon shields the weld metal and helium is required to control 
the plasma formation in CO2 laser welding. If Nd:YAGs are used for welding, the 
plasma formation is not an aspect of major concern and argon is the recommended 
welding gas. Small additions of oxygen, hydrogen or CO2 can be used depending 
on material and process to increase productivity further [26]. Helium, argon or 
mixtures of these gases are used for most materials, including reactive metals such 
as titanium or zirconium. For reactive materials the shielded area must be 
increased, because they are sensitive to air contamination down to low 
temperatures (400 ºC). Nitrogen can also be used for welding stainless steels in less 
demanding applications [3].  
 
2.3.3.6 Absorptivity 
 
The efficiency of laser beam welding represents the proportion of beam energy that 
is effectively added to the work-piece. It is drastically affected by the absorptivity 
of the material to be welded. Absorptivity is a function of the electrical resistivity 
of the material, according to Equation 2.4, where A is the absorptivity and pr the 
the electrical resistivity 
 
r
p
A
2.
112
 
  
 
 
 
 
2.4 
 
Absorptivity in many metallic materials is very low, 2 to 3% for aluminum or 
copper and less than 15% for stainless steel [22]. Absorptivity is increased by the 
formation of oxide layers in metallic materials. Absorbent powders can be applied 
in work-piece surface, in order to reduce reflection losses. The addition of active 
gases, such as oxygen, to shielding gas also improves absorptivity. In keyhole 
welding absorptivity suffers a large increase because of multiple reflections inside 
the keyhole, providing efficient welding even in high reflective materials such as 
aluminum [27]. 
 

 
Welding Technology 
53 
 
The beam energy absorbed by a specific material is also a function of the radiation 
wavelength, generally increasing with the decrease of the wavelength. For steels 
absorptivity of Nd:YAG radiation is approximately three times of that of CO2 laser 
radiation. For aluminum this difference is not so large and for other materials, such 
as copper or silver, no difference exists in this range of wavelength. 
 
2.3.4 Process Variants 
Dual beam laser welding has been proposed few years ago to improve fit-up 
tolerances and to reduce the probability of forming bead shape defects, such as 
humping and undercutting [59]. Beams can be mounted side-by-side or the second 
beam trails behind the primary beam. 
 
Robotic hybrid welding processes were also developed to increase welding speed 
and deposition rate. This is the case for the combination of laser and GMAW 
processes. This combination provides high speed and good fit-up tolerance. 
 
High power lasers, such as CO2 lasers, needed for high speed welding of metals, 
require large floor space, considerable electrical and water services and regular 
maintenance. For precision welding applications, a new generation of lasers named 
diode lasers is available, providing a more efficient operation and maintenance-free 
running for more than 10000 h [28]. In fact it is not a variant but a new type of 
laser. These lasers incorporate diode chips, each one emitting a laser beam of very 
low power, when excited electrically. These chips are mounted into bars containing 
a cooling system and micro-channel lenses to focus individual laser beams. These 
bars have low power, around 60 W, and are mounted into diode stacks with other 
optical systems in order to obtain a focused laser beam with a power of several kW 
[29], as represented schematically in Figure 2.18. These lasers can be classified as 
low power diode lasers (LPDL), having power up to 150 W, and high power diode 
lasers (HPDL) with power ranging from 150 W to 4 kW. The lasers of this last 
group are used in welding operations. The wavelength of the laser beam is in the 
range 0.63 to 0.99 Pm, though the interval 0.8 to 0.94 Pm is common in welding 
applications. Aluminum has a marked increase of absorptivity in this wavelength 
range. Diode laser beam is not as coherent as Nd:YAG or CO2 laser beams and 
focus is larger and rectangular instead of circular, being less sensitive for fitting of 
components to weld.

This process has high energy efficiency (30-50%) when compared with CO2 lasers 
(3-10%). Added to this, HPDL are compact and light and can be easily adapted to 
anthropomorphic robots with small pay-load (less than 25 kg). Running cost are 
approximately one-tenth of CO2 lasers but beam quality is low [31]. HPDL are 
applied to the welding and brazing at high speed of carbon and stainless steels and 
aluminum alloys, as well as cladding operations. Thickness of welded components 
is limited by the power of the laser. They are becoming increasingly used in 
welding of thermoplastic materials, where they are replacing traditional techniques 
such as ultrasonic welding [32]. 
 
2.4 Resistance Spot Welding (RSW) 
Resistance spot welding (RSW) is included in the group of resistance welding 
processes in which the heat is generated by passage of electric current through the 
bodies to be joined, according to Joule’s law, expressed by Equation 2.5, where H 
is the heat generated, I is the current and t is the time of current flow:

Other welding processes such as resistance seam welding, projection welding, flash 
or upset welding and high-frequency welding are of the same group. Spot welding 
is the resistance welding process most widely used in robotic applications all over 
the world and is treated here with some detail. Main aspects of resistance seam 
welding process, which also has some relevance in industrial robotics, are analyzed 
in the section of process variants.

interface resistances – R1 and R5; resistance of the work-pieces – R2 and R4; resistance in the 
interface between work-pieces – R3 
 
2.4.1 Introduction 
In resistance spot welding overlapping sheets of metal are joined by applying 
electric current and pressure in the zone to weld with copper electrodes, as 
illustrated in Figure 2.19. Copper is used for electrodes because it has low 
electrical resistance and high thermal conductivity. Spot welding operation is 
composed of three steps that are the squeezing, welding and holding stages. 
Squeezing consists of applying the weld force to the work-pieces in order to obtain 
the appropriate amount of pressure, prior to welding. During welding, the electric 
current passes through the work-pieces, while the welding force is maintained, 
generating heat. In the course of the holding stage current is switched off and weld 
force maintained, allowing the weld to forge and cool under pressure. 
 
The heat generated depends basically on the electrical current and time being used 
and on the electrical resistance of materials between electrodes. This inter-
electrodes resistance is composed by five separated resistances, as is indicated in 
Figure 2.19. Resistances R1 and R5 are undesirable because they produce heating 
and consequently degradation of the electrodes. Resistances R2 and R4 are the 
resistances of the work-pieces and they assume particular importance in the final 
period of the weld. Low resistive materials are difficult to weld because of reduced 
heat generated in the pieces. Resistance R3 is the most important because it 
determines nugget formation, assuring the establishment of the weld.  
 
The nugget is a volume of melted material that forms in the interface of work-
pieces with a diameter similar to that of the electrodes, as is indicated in Figure 
2.19. Nugget penetration should be al least 20% of the thinnest sheet member but 
not exceeding 80% of the same thickness [31]. The passage of current initiates 
after the application of the electrodes force, leading the increase of temperature in 

56 
Welding Robots 
 
the interface and developing a molten nugget. In the final part of the welding cycle 
plastic deformation occurs in the work-pieces, producing a visible and permanent 
indentation of the pieces. If current or pressure is too high, melted material can be 
expulsed (splashed) to the atmosphere. 
 
The process has extensive application in welding of carbon steels because they 
have higher electrical resistivity and lower thermal conductivity than the electrodes 
made of copper. Aluminum alloys have an electrical resistivity and thermal 
conductivity that are closer to those of the copper, making difficult the welding 
operation of these materials, requiring higher levels of current, which can damage 
the electrode tips [32]. Other materials such as galvanized steels, heat-resisting 
alloys and reactive metals are also welded by this process. Since the process is very 
competitive it is widely used in automotive and aerospace industries as well in the 
manufacture of industrial and domestic equipment. 
 
The major advantages of this process are the high welding speed and low thermal 
distortion, respectively faster and lower than in conventional arc welding 
processes, suitability for automation, the need of low skilled operators and the 
absence of joint preparation or filler metal. Some limitations of this process are the 
need for lap joints in thin materials, usually up to a thickness of 4 mm, the joints 
are not tight and have low tensile and fatigue strengths. Add to this fact that the 
initial equipment costs are higher than those of conventional arc welding 
equipment. 
 
2.4.2 Welding Equipment 
The main welding equipment to consider in resistance spot welding are the welding 
power sources and the electrodes. Those pieces of equipment will be considered 
next in detail.  
2.4.2.1 Power Sources 
 
Spot welding machines are composed basically an electrical circuit, which 
provides welding current, a control circuit that regulates welding current and 
welding time, and a mechanical system, used to apply welding force.  
 
The electrical circuit consists of a step-down transformer, whose secondary circuit 
includes the electrodes and the work-pieces, see Figure 2.19. The transformer 
changes the input AC high-voltage and low amperage current, in the primary 
winding, to an AC high-amperage and low voltage current in the secondary 
winding. These transformers have low internal impedance, because current 
magnitude in secondary winding is inversely proportional to the impedance and 
depends directly on the open voltage of the secondary circuit. 
 
Single-phase AC machines providing current up to 50 kA are widely used. Spot 
welders can also provide DC of continuous polarity, pulses of current of alternating 

 
Welding Technology 
57 
 
polarity or pulsed mode [15]. Single or three-phase machines are available, though 
single-phase are commonly used because they are simpler to operate and have 
lower initial and maintenance costs for almost equivalent performance. Three types 
of direct current machines are generally available: the rectifier, the frequency 
converter and stored energy machines. The rectifier and frequency converter 
machines are fed from three-phase systems in contrast to stored energy machines 
that draw power from single-phase systems. These latter machines store energy 
during a period of time and then discharge a pulse of current to make the weld. 
These welders are useful for low frequency welds. Medium-frequency (400-2000) 
DC inverters are available for RSW. These inverters improve ability to control the 
welding process finely [60]. High-frequency DC inverters are being developed for 
further improvement of the process control.

Figure 2.20. Arrangements of the secondary circuit for multiple spot welds; a - direct 
welding; b - series welding 
 
In multiple spot welding the arrangement of the secondary circuit depends on 
whether they are direct or series welds, as is illustrated in Figure 2.20. In direct 
multiple-spot the welding conditions are similar in the three electrodes represented 
in Figure 2.20a; in series multiple-spot each of the two transformer secondary 
circuits shown in Figure 2.20 b makes two welds [33]. 
 
Most of the spot welders are computer controlled and allow the input of welding 
data. The simplest control sets current magnitude and welding time. More 
sophisticated controls allow to regulate current during welding as well provide and 
control preheat and post-heat operations [34]. 
 
Electrode clamping force is applied by hydraulic, pneumatic, magnetic or 
mechanical means, at a high controlled velocity in order prevent premature 
deformation of the electrodes. During the welding cycle, material clamped by the 
electrodes expands and contracts rapidly, because of the high heating and cooling 
rates, but working pressure must be maintained. When heated metal undergoes 
softening the electrodes must follow-up to maintain enough pressure on the sheet 
surfaces. If pressure drops during welding electrode-work-piece interface 
resistances increase, electrodes are overheated and may deteriorate. Clamping 

58 
Welding Robots 
 
force can be variable during the cycle. Metals which have high shrinkage during 
solidification may need an increase of force to forge nugget after current passage. 
Modern systems allow control of the clamping force during all stages of the spot 
welding process. New portable gun units, incorporating the power transformer and 
the actuator into a common platform, facilitate the fitting of RSW to robotic 
systems. 
 
2.4.2.2 Electrodes 
 
Electrodes should have high electrical and thermal conductivities and must develop 
low electric contact resistance in order to prevent deterioration of the work-piece 
and electrodes. In addition they must have good strength to resist to deformation 
and wear at high temperature. They are made from copper containing alloy 
elements such as chromium (0.6-0.9%), cobalt (1-2%), beryllium (0.5%) and 
zirconium (0.08%). Electrodes are composed of three parts: the electrode cap or 
tip, the body of the electrode and the cooling system. Most of the electrodes are 
cylindrical with the tip machined to a truncated cone with an angle of 30º, though a 
variety of tip shapes (pointed, flat, dome and radius) is used to obtain access with 
complex joints. When welding thin sheets the electrode tip diameter (d) can be 
estimated by Equation 2.6, where t is the thickness of the sheet in contact with the 
electrode. For thicknesses above 1 mm electrode tip diameter is estimated by 
Equation 2.7:

(a)

(b) 
 
 
 
 
 
2.7 
 
When welding sheets of dissimilar thicknesses the electrode diameter should be 
specified for the thinner material. The weld diameter (D) should be similar to the 
electrode diameter. Repeated heating and cooling of the electrode and pick-up of 
metal particles causes electrode tip deterioration. Maximum tip diameter allowed is 
1.3 times the initial diameter. When the electrode tip reaches this diameter it 
should be replaced or redressed to the original diameter. 
 
Electrodes should be water cooled at a flow rate above 4 l/min and separate water 
circuits must be used for both top and bottom electrodes. 
 
2.4.3 Process Parameters 
According to Joule’s law the welding parameters are current, time and electric 
resistance. Electric resistance is a function of several parameters such as electric 
resistivity of materials, surface quality of sheet metal and clamping force. Electric 
resistivity is a characteristic of the materials and varies with temperature during 
welding. Material surface quality depends on roughness and cleanliness of the 
surfaces of sheet materials. Parameters that can be programmed in the welding 

 
Welding Technology 
59 
 
machine are current, time and welding force. The choice of welding conditions 
depends on thickness and physical properties of metals being welded and even on 
the type of the welding equipment. 
 
2.4.3.1 Welding Current and Time 
 
Heat developed during welding is proportional to time and to square of current. 
Though both parameters are responsible for heat generation, the weld heating rate 
is determined only by current, because heat lost to the work-piece and to copper 
electrodes increases with weld time. Heat lost to the work-piece increases heat 
affected zone and thermal distortion, while heat in the electrodes can degradate 
them, all being undesirable effects. The level of current required for any metal 
tends to be inversely proportional to its electrical and thermal resistivities. 
 
Weld time (cycles)
Weld current (A)
 
 
Figure 2.21. Schematic representation of current-time relationship for RSW 
 
The size of the weld nugget increases rapidly with increasing current. When 
welding a particular material and thickness, if current is increased welding time 
should be decreased, see Figure 2.21, in order to prevent high surface indentation 
or even expulsion of melted material and deterioration of electrodes [35]. The 
expulsion of material defines the upper limit of usable current. 
 
Welding currents range from 20 to 100 kA, mainly for light alloys, though the most 
usual are between 4 and 20 kA for carbon steels. Time is defined in cycles of 50 
Hz supply and it is between 5 and 100 Hz for steels and 5 and 20 Hz for light 
alloys, in sheets up to 3 mm thick.  
 
Weld current cycles may have different shapes that depend on the materials being 
welded, as shown in Figure 2.22. A cycle of constant current magnitude, Figure 
2.22a, represents the simplest situation and is suitable for welding mild steels. For 
high strength steels sensitive to cold cracking a modulated welding current with a 
rise time tr and a fall time tf, see Figure 2.22b, can be used to allow gradual heating 

60

and cooling of the weld. In the case of materials prone to form brittle structures in 
the weld an additional current cycle of magnitude Ia, see Figure 2.22c, can be 
useful to anneal the weld. In spot welding of thick materials (over 3 mm) the use of 
several pulses of current, Figure 2.22d, is effective. 
 
2.4.3.2 Welding Force 
 
The increase of the welding force reduces contact resistance because, in first 
analysis, it promotes the increase of contact area, due to deformation of surface 
asperities and eventually the rupture of surface oxide films [36]. Electrode 
clamping forces must be high, particularly when welding low resistivity metals in 
order to reduce the proportion of heat generated in the interface electrode/work-
piece. Electrode force must be increased with increasing current, unless part of the 
melted material of the nugget can be expelled. Other factors such as bad fit and 
lack of mechanical support contributes for the material expulsion. Distance of the 
weld to the edge of the sheets should be larger than 1.5 D, where D is the weld 
diameter. Excessively high forces are also undesirable because they can cause large 
surface indentation of the work-pieces and damage of the electrodes. 
 
Electrode clamping force increases with increasing thickness and strength of the 
work-pieces. Forces between 1000 and 15,000 N are usual for plate thicknesses up 
to 3 mm, though values of 20,000 N can be used in steel sheets 6 mm thick. 
 
Clamping force starts before the passage of current initiates and is maintained after 
the current is cut off, as is illustrated in Figure 2.22. Sometimes an increase of 
force is applied after current passage to forge the weld, see Figure 2.22b.

2.4.4 Process Variants 
Resistance seam welding (RSEW) is used when a continuous seam is required. 
This seam consists of a series of overlap spot welds, as shown in Figure 2.23. This 
process is similar to resistance spot welding, but the electrodes are replaced by 
power driven wheels or rollers that move along the joint. Electric current passes 
intermittently while the wheels are stationary, without the necessity of raising or 
lowering the welding head. The amount of overlap between spots is 25-50%. The 
process can be used to do spot welds by simple adjustment of timing. The weld 
width in continuous welds is between 
t
2
 and 
t
5
, where t is the single sheet 
thickness. The track tends to deform due to continuous work and a device is 
needed to correct the shape of the wheel edge. 
 
RSEW machines can be of circular type, where the axis of rotation of the electrode 
wheel is at right angles to the front of the machine, of longitudinal type, where the 
the axis of rotation of the electrode wheel is parallel to the front of the machine, 
and of universal type, which allows the orientation of the axis of rotation of the 
electrode wheels to be changed [32]. Portable machines are also available for 
welding large work-pieces that are difficult to handle by conventional equipment.

Electrode wheels are made of the same materials of RSW electrodes, with 
diameters between 50 and 610 mm and can have internal or external cooling. 
Internal cooling may have higher operational costs and do not cool the weld. 
 
Maximum welding current in conventional RSEW machines ranges commonly 
from 20 to 30 kA, though welders up to 100 kA are applied in welding of light 
alloys. Clamping forces between 2000 and 16000 N and welding speeds ranging 

62 
Welding Robots 
 
from 1 to 12 m/min are used for steels, though lower values of force and speed are 
applied in aluminum alloys. 
 
Carbon, low-alloy, stainless and coated steels are currently welded using this 
process. Welding of light alloys requires additional precautions because of their 
lower electrical resistivity and lower melting temperature. A new process named 
conductive heat resistance seam welding allows one to increase the welding speed 
and reduce joint preparation cost in difficult-to-weld aluminum alloys [37]. 
 
RSEW is largely used in the automotive industry as well as in manufacturing of 
heat exchangers, non-pressurized tanks and several types of cans. 
 
Main advantages of this process when compared with resistance spot welding are 
the capacity to produce gas-tight and liquid-tight welds as well as the possibility of 
reduction of the overlap width of the sheets. However, the weld must progress in a 
straight line or in a uniformly curved line of large radius and thermal distortion can 
be higher than in resistance spot welding. 
 
This process has several variants such as mash-seam welding, butt seam welding, 
high frequency resistance welding and high frequency induction welding [38] but 
they are outside the scope of this introduction.  
 
2.5 Friction Stir Welding (FSW) 
Friction stir welding (FSW) is a solid state joining process invented at The Welding 
Institute (TWI) in 1991 [39], in which a non-consumable rotating tool is slowly 
plunged into the butting faces of the work-pieces and traversed along the joint line, 
see Figure 2.24a. Pieces to be welded have to be clamped in order to prevent joint 
faces from being moved out of position.  
 
Heat is generated by tool friction, under the tool shoulder and on the probe surface, 
and by plastic deformation of the material [40]. Heat generated is lost to the work-
pieces, to the tool and to the anvil, as represented schematically in Figure 2.24b. 
Maximum temperatures are attained close the tool shoulder and are lower than the 
melting temperature of the materials being welded [41], though incipient melting 
has been reported for some materials. Heat produced creates a softened plasticized 
region around the tool, which facilitates the movement of the tool along the joint 
line. Plasticized material is chaotic mixed or extruded from the advancing side to 
the retreating side of the tool [42],[43] and it is forged by the contact of the tool 
shoulder and of the pin, producing a solid phase bond between the two pieces.

2.5.1 Introduction 
This welding process leads to the appearance of a thermo-mechanically affected 
zone (TMAZ), which results from both plastic deformation and thermal exposure 
of the material, and of a heat affected zone (HAZ), which only suffers the effect of 
the thermal cycle. In the central part of the TMAZ there usually appears a distinct 
nugget, having an onion ring feature, attributed to dynamic re-crystallization or 
dynamic recovery of the microstructure [44].

FSW is mainly used in welding of aluminum alloys, though other materials such as 
magnesium, copper, zinc, titanium and even steel [44] can be welded with this 
process. This process can be used too for welding aluminum alloys of different 
alloy groups or yet dissimilar materials, metal matrix composites and plastics. It 
presents several advantages when compared with conventional arc welding 
processes, mainly in the welding of aluminum alloys. Difficulties related to 
sensitivity to solidification cracking, gas porosity caused by the hydrogen absorbed 
during welding and thermal distortion, very common in fusion welding processes, 
do not happen in this process. Other benefits of the process include good strength 
and ductility along with minimization of residual stress and distortion. These 
qualities of FSW are generally attributed to the solid-state nature of the process and 
a supposed low energy input to the welded joint. In addition to this no filler 
electrode, no shielding gas and minimum surface preparation is needed. No 
environmental concerns have to be considered because neither fumes nor toxic 
gases nor radiation of the electric arc are produced in this process. 
 
However, there are still several drawbacks that need to be addressed in order to 
facilitate industrial application of this process. The system requires high forces to 
move the tool through the plasticized material, which in turn wears the tool, mainly 
in welding of hard materials. Powerful clamping fixtures are also needed to hold 
pieces down and counteract forging forces from the tool. Because of this, FSW is 

64 
Welding Robots 
 
usually carried out in custom heavy-duty machine tool equipment, where weld 
joints are frequently limited to straight lines or two-dimensional contours. The use 
of industrial robots increases the flexibility of this process, providing the ability to 
weld three-dimensional contours [46]. 
 
Nowadays FSW is used in the welding of pieces in aluminum alloys ranging in 
thickness from 0.5 to 75 mm. It is being used in the shipbuilding and the marine 
industries, for manufacturing of panels, platforms and heavy profiles, in the 
aerospace industry for production of fuel tanks, wings and fuselages, in the railway 
industry for high speed trains, in the automotive industry, for production of panels 
and other components, etc. 
 
2.5.2 Welding Equipment 
In the beginning mainly high stiffness machines were developed, specifically 
tailored to meet client needs, but nowadays standardized, flexible and modular 
systems suited to several industry segments are being produced too, for welding 
nonferrous metals. These latter systems consist of a sturdy basic framework, a set 
of safety stops, a welding carriage assembly, a welding head assembly, a control 
system, a hydraulic unit and the welding tools [47]. These machines can have 
several basic designs, providing vertical down forces ranging from 6 to 200 kN, 
welding speeds up to 2 m/min, though an option up to 6 m/min exists, and tool 
rotation speed between 500 and 2000 rpm. 
 
As referred above these machines have low flexibility producing welds in simple 
two or three-dimensional pathways. Robotic systems allow the improving of 
flexibility but need to be able to apply and maintain a large and constant axial force 
during the welding operation, which is not simple in these systems. This is done 
using high payload robots that sense the force directly and use feedback to 
maintain the force during the welding operation. The axial force decreases with 
increasing tool rotation speed but increases with increasing travel speed, and 
therefore for robotic FSW a compromise may need to be established between travel 
speed and axial force requirements [46]. 
 
The appropriate tool type is a key factor of the quality of friction stir welded joints. 
For butt welding aluminum alloys of thickness up to 12 mm cylindrical threaded 
pin probes are recommended, while for thicker plates the Whorl and MX-Triflute 
probes should be used [48], see Figure 2.25. These latter probe types allow welding 
speeds that exceed largely those achievable with threaded pin probes: at least by a 
factor of 2. In addition they have flat or re-entrant features or oval cross section, 
which reduce the probe volume (static volume), allowing one to achieve a suitable 
swept volume (dynamic volume) to static volume ratio. The greater this ratio, the 
greater the path for material flow and the efficiency of the probe [49].

For lap welding of aluminum alloys, which is more difficult than butt welding 
because wider welds are necessary and oxide disruption at the sheet interface is 
more difficult, special tools are used, such as Flared-Triflute and A-Skew probes 
[49]. These tools allow the dynamic to static volume ratio to be increased, 
improving weld quality. 
 
The shape of the bottom of the tool shoulder affects material flow around the probe 
and contributes to preventing the escape of plasticized material. They can be flat or 
concave, smooth or grooved, with concentric or spiral grooves [50]. A concave 
shoulder bottom has the advantage, when compared with a flat bottom, of directing 
material flow to the center close the probe. Grooved bottoms have in general the 
same effect. Shoulders can also have knives to shave the weld. 
 
In general this welding process requires access to both sides of the work-pieces 
being welded, although by using a special tool (bobin-tool) it is possible to do the 
welds without the need for an anvil [51]. 
 
2.5.3 Process Parameters 
The main parameters of the FSW process, which are determinant for the quality of 
the welded joint, are the vertical down force, also designated tool plunge force, the 
tool rotation speed and the travel speed or welding speed. Plunge force assures 
penetration of the probe into the plates and forges plasticized material under the 

66 
Welding Robots 
 
shoulder. The tool rotation speed directly influences the heat generated in the 
process because the mechanical power input to the tool is given by Equation 2.8, 
where P is the power, M the torque and ȍ is the angular speed of the tool. 
 
:
M
P  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.8 
 
The mechanical power input is dissipated mainly by thermal losses because plastic 
work may be neglected. Heat generated in the process is also influenced by the 
plunge force because it affects the torque. Heat generated increases with increasing 
tool rotation speed and tool plunge force. Travel speed influences the heat input per 
unit weld length (specific heat input), affecting metal flow around the probe. 
Specific heat input decreases with increasing travel speed, which reduces material 
softening in the vicinity of the probe, making plastic flow more difficult. High 
travel speeds may cause defects, such as cavities. For low tool rotation speed, low 
plunge force and high travel speed external defects may form for welds in some 
aluminum alloys. The increase of the plunge force moves defects to the interior of 
the weld [52]. The ratio tool rotation speed vs travel speed is sometimes used to 
distinguish between hot welds, having high ratio, and cold welds, with low ratio. 
Hot welds are less sensitive to defect formation but may exhibit more significant 
changes in microstructure and mechanical properties than cold welds in aluminum 
alloys. 
 
Other relevant parameters are the time of indentation of the tool and the tool 
shoulder angle, besides the other geometric characteristics of the tool referred in 
the previous section. The time of indentation of the tool is the period between the 
instant the tool contacts the work-piece and the instant the tool begins moving 
along the joint. During this period generated heat spreads in the vicinity of the 
probe, softening material and stabilizing material flow around the probe. If this 
period is too short defects can appear in the initial part of the weld. Time can range 
usually from 5 to 30 s. The tool shoulder angle allows a gradual increase of the 
pressure on the top surface of the plates being welded and helps to direct the 
material flow. Tool angles up to 3º are common. 
 
2.5.4 Process Variants 
In the last few years several variants of FSW process have been developed. One of 
these variants is thermal assisted FSW in which a heat source is applied in the joint 
before the FSW tool, in order to preheat and soften the material [53]. This reduces 
welding forces, welding power and tool wear and increases travel speed. This 
variant can be useful in welding of steels and other high strength materials. 
 
Another variant is spot FSW, developed for lap joints, that produces spot welds 
having higher mechanical strength than those produced by resistance spot welding. 
Robotic applications of this process are being developed [54]. 
 

 
Welding Technology 
67 
 
A recent development is the reversal stir welding process (Re-StirTM), developed 
by TWI, in which tool rotation is applied as both angular reciprocating, where 
reversal is imposed within one revolution, and rotary reversal, where reversal is 
imposed after one or more revolutions, instead of continuous rotation as is in 
conventional FSW. Re-Stir is basically a cyclic and essentially symmetrical 
process. According to TWI Re-stirTM may become the preferred option for certain 
butt, lap, compound lap and spot welding and material processing applications 
[55]. 
 
2.6 Health and Safety 
The major potential hazards of arc welding processes are the high-voltage 
electricity, which can injure and kill personnel, the fumes and gases, which can be 
dangerous to health, the electric arc radiation, which can injure eyes and burn skin 
and the noise that can damage hearing.  
 
The exposure to the high open-circuit voltage of power supplies can cause 
dangerous electric shocks, which can be prevented by connecting all the electrical 
equipment and work-pieces to a suitable electrical ground. All electric cables 
should be suited to the maximum current and must remain insulated and dry. 
 
Fumes and gases are generated in all arc welding processes, being particularly 
intense in the flux cored arc welding process. Metal fumes of nickel, chromium, 
zinc, lead or cadmium, for example, and gases such as carbon monoxide, ozone 
and nitrogen oxides formed in the arc are very harmful to the health [56]. Enough 
ventilation or exhaust at the arc, or both must be used in order to keep fumes and 
gases from the personnel breathing zone. 
 
The electric arc of GTAW and GMAW processes emits intense radiation in the 
ultraviolet range, in the infrared range and also in the visible range. UV radiation 
can commonly cause a temporary eye burn, which can be painful for 48 h. A filter 
glass should be used by the operator to absorb the radiation in the dangerous 
wavelengths, and limit visible light so he can see the joint during the welding 
operation. There are two basic types of filter, permanent filters and photosensitive 
filters, which react rapidly to the incident light from the arc and darken [55]. 
Optical density of filters increases with increasing current. The UV also occasions 
reddening and irritation of the skin and operators need to be protected by leather, 
wool or aluminum coated clothing. Robotic welding systems are generally 
protected by enclosures provided with windows with filters for viewing weld area. 
 
Ear protection should be used when noise is excessive in the work area. Special 
care must be taken in handling and use of cylinders containing high-pressure and 
liquefied gases, which should remain in a vertical position, secured with chains, 
when they are being used. 
 

68 
Welding Robots 
 
Lubricants or other flammable compounds should not be used in pressure-reducing 
regulators and other parts of the oxygen circuit because they can lead to 
catastrophic fire. 
 
Potential hazards in laser beam welding are in many aspects similar to those 
observed in arc welding. Laser power supplies employ high voltage capable of 
producing lethal electric shocks. Laser welding also generates dangerous metal 
fumes, whose composition depends on the metals being welded, requiring local 
exhaust ventilation. However laser beams can cause permanent eye damage, so 
exposure to direct or reflected laser beams must be prevented. Laser welding 
systems must operate in restricted access enclosures opaque to the laser 
wavelength. Individual laser eye protection can be required for personnel working 
in the vicinity of the laser source [22]. Thermal burns can also occur if skin is 
exposed to primary laser beams. 
 
Principal motives of concern in resistance spot welding are protection against 
molten metal spatter and splash and electric shock. Working environment can be 
improved by the use of enclosures and splash-less resistance spot welding systems 
[57].

Sensors for Welding Robots 
3.1 Introduction 
The demand for better control and sensing in welding has increased with 
automation and welding processes involving new and advanced materials. This 
requires precise control of the welding process to produce the desired weld with 
respect to productivity and quality. Consequently, there is a need for different 
technologies to control precisely the process with respect to the different welding 
operating parameters. In doing so, sensors play a crucial role as the major source of 
input to the control system that manage and control the behavior and output of the 
welding system. Here, the term “sensor” is used for devices that measure 
observable parameters related to the welding process which is used to control the 
process in accordance with defined specifications.  
 
In general, most robotized welding processes that produce a continuous weld are 
based on the MIG/MAG process, or GMAW (Gas Metal Arc Welding). Within this 
application field, the use of sensors has been modest. However, the development 
and introduction of new welding processes like high speed welding, laser welding, 
etc., emphasize the importance of accurate control of the process. The development 
of new products also makes use of new materials with possibilities to decrease 
thicknesses. A result of this is a need to be able to work with tighter tolerances. 
Thus, the need is increasing for sensors that can meet the requirements from new 
processes and product specifications and is in many cases a necessity. 
 
The main task of the sensors is to provide the control system with information to 
generate proper actions to produce a result that corresponds with defined 
specifications. In welding this is not as easy as we might think. From a welding 
process perspective, the process is performed mainly by two subsystems; the 
welding equipment and the robot. The welding equipment includes the welding 
power source and the devices that deliver the energy from the welding power 
source, like the wire feed system, conduit, welding torch and so on. The robot 

74 
Welding Robots 
 
produces the relative positioning of the energy and the work-piece that is to be 
welded through a weld torch attached to the end effector mounting plate.  
 
From a control point of view, both the welding equipment and the robot are 
important to produce the weld with the specified quality and productivity. They are 
normally controlled by two different and loosely coupled control systems, 
controlling the welding power source and the robot arm. In the following, both the 
sensors and the purpose of utilizing sensors to control the weld process will be 
discussed. Concerning sensors, they are in most cases used for one of the control 
systems, the welding equipment or the robot, but for the purpose of using sensors, 
the information can preferably be used for both controlling the welding power 
source and the robot arm as will be discussed later in this chapter. However, the 
purpose of the sensor and how it will be used will affect the specification of the 
sensor which therefore can be divided into two groups, technological and 
geometrical sensors, measuring technological parameters with respect to the 
welding process and geometrical parameters with respect to the weld joint 
geometry. 
 
Sensors that measure geometrical parameters are mainly used to provide the robot 
with seam tracking capability and/or search capability, allowing the path of the 
robot to be adapted according to geometrical deviations from the nominal path. 
Technological sensors measure parameters within the welding process for its 
stability and are mostly used for monitoring and/or controlling purposes. 
 
As will be discussed later, information from both technological and geometrical 
sensors provides a basis for a qualitative control of the welding process to make it 
possible to conform to specifications defined within a WPS (Welding Procedure 
Specification) concerning quality and productivity measures. Another issue of 
importance is the mapping problem between observable parameters and 
controllable parameters with respect to the sensor. In the simple case with a sensor 
based seam tracking of almost straight welds, the feedback control is 
straightforward, but applying the sensor data for integrated control related to the 
WPS will require a more sophisticated model-based control approach. This is 
because a controllable parameter is not always a parameter that a sensor can 
observe during the welding process and thus, a model-based mapping must be 
made to be able to control the weld. In this context, a model-based approach may 
transform a parameter or set of parameters not directly observable by the sensor 
into the known set of parameters which can be calculated from a model of the 
welding process using the information of the sensor. However, the welding process 
includes many interrelated parameters with included tolerances, which means that 
such models will predict a number of data not observed directly and with a degree 
of uncertainty. In practice, such models work better close to defined nominal data 
where process conditions are similar to those anticipated in the WPS. In the same 
way, actions to control the process are usually defined by a combination of a set of 
parameters which together counteract deviations from specifications defined in the 
WPS. In general, such a set of parameters are not unique and there are in most 

 
Sensors for Welding Robots 
75 
 
cases several possibilities to control the welding process and fulfill requirements 
defined in the WPS.  
 
It should be noted here that the concept of specifying the weld to be produced 
within a WPS document is a method to define a procedure to, in a consistent and 
reliable way, work out the welding process. It should include information about the 
actual weld to produce, like joint geometry and material, but also joint preparation, 
consumables like shielding gas composition and flow, and welding wire, and 
nominal operating parameters and the productivity and quality to achieve. In most 
cases, however, we can only measure some of the parameters needed and from the 
available observations make judgments on how to control the process to reach the 
specifications defined in the WPS.  
 
In this way, the WPS is both a specification of the functional specifications of the 
weld (quality, productivity) and operating data (nominal operating parameters) to 
reach the specifications. To use sensors, however, means to measure the real 
process, extract features from these measurements and, through a control action, 
override these pre-set parameters in order to achieve the functional specifications, 
where quality and productivity issues have to balance each other on a case by case 
basis. For a typical case, nominal operating data is defined based on specified weld 
quality and productivity. This is used to pre-set data of the welding power source 
and to instruct the robot to generate the trajectory in accordance with defined 
velocity, welding torch orientation with respect to the weld joint and the distance to 
the weld joint. If a sensor is used which through a feed-back loop will alter one or 
several of these settings, the WPS should include allowed tolerances for all 
nominal data. This is also the case if sensors are used for the purpose of monitoring 
the robotic welding operation. 
 
3.1 Sensors for Technological Parameters 
Technological parameters include voltage, current and wire feed speed. In this 
section sensors to measure those parameters are reviewed. 
 
3.1.1 Arc Voltage 
The measurement of the arc voltage should, in principle, be made as close to the 
welding arc as possible. The current is delivered to the wire at the contact tube and 
this could be assumed to be a good measuring point for arc voltage. However, there 
is a voltage drop between the contact tube and the wire tip where the arc starts of 
about 0.3 V, depending on the process characteristics [1]. In practice, it is difficult, 
if not impossible in a production environment, to measure the true arc voltage. This 
is also the case for measuring the voltage at the contact tube in the weld torch, and 
a better and more reliable way is to measure the voltage on the wire inside the wire 
feeding system. As the wire does not carry a current between the feeder and the 

76 
Welding Robots 
 
contact tube the voltage at the wire feeder will be the same as that at the contact 
tube. It must be noted that measurements are made within an environment that uses 
high currents, usually in the range of 150-500 A, and if wires used for sensors are 
placed in the wrong way, this can result in substantial induced voltages with 
corresponding reading errors. 
 
3.1.2 Welding Current 
Basically there are two types of sensors for measuring the welding current: Hall 
Effect and Current Shunt. 
 
3.1.2.1 Hall Effect Sensor 
 
The Hall Effect sensor consists of a circular core of cast iron through which the 
cable that carries the current flows. The device itself is placed in the gap in the iron 
core which in turn consists of a doped silicon plate with two pairs of connecting 
cables. The first pair feeds the device with a current and the device then responds 
by delivering a signal on a second pair of cables which is proportional to the 
magnetic field and thereby the current. The benefit of the Hall Effect device is that 
it is a non-contact sensor and does not interfere with the current of the welding 
power source. The sensor is limited in bandwidth which is usually in the order of 
100 kHz or more and a typical slew rate is 50 A/μs This is usually sufficient and 
will, provided the data read I/O channels are designed in accordance with the 
specification of the sensor, result in a rise time of less than 1% of the peak pulse 
time during pulsed GMA welding.  
 
3.1.2.2 Current Shunt 
 
The principle is to let the current flow through a resistor and measure the voltage 
drop across it, as if measuring a current with a multimeter. The method is simple 
but has some drawbacks. The resistor must be kept low and hence the voltage 
signal measured will be small and sensitive to noise. 
 
3.1.3 Wire Feed Speed 
The wire feed speed is a major parameter to control to achieve a stable welding 
process. The welding power source is in most cases controlled to produce a 
constant voltage and the preset parameters are usually voltage and current. 
However, in reality, a current will represent a certain wire feed speed and the 
common method is to apply a constant value of voltage and wire feed speed and let 
the current adjust itself accordingly. A higher wire feed speed will produce a 
higher arc current that will deposit the wire faster and vice versa with a smaller 
value of the wire feed speed. Modern welding power sources have various control 

 
Sensors for Welding Robots 
77 
 
schemes, but the general principle is to keep the voltage at a preset constant value. 
As a result, the current will vary during the process as a result of changes in the 
environment of the arc welding process, like changes in the distance from the weld 
torch to the work-piece. 
 
These changes can occur as a result of the movement of the robot or geometrical 
variations in the weld joint. However, changes of speed can also originate from the 
wire feeder system and in the end produce poor results with respect to quality.  
 
The wire is fed through a conduit and the wire feed speed is generated by a feeding 
unit. The unit usually has driving wheels that feed the wire through the conduit at a 
specified speed. In normal robot systems, the wire feed unit is mounted on the 
robot arm rather close (the order of 1 m) to the weld torch, giving a reliable push-
feed of the wire during the welding process. However, in some cases, longer 
conduits must be used and since the wire diameter must be slightly less than the 
inner diameter of the conduit, a varying wire speed will result during welding when 
the conduit is bent and twisted. In practice, a push-pull wire feed system should be 
used to counteract this problem. 
 
Measuring the wire feed speed is a big problem and for laboratory purposes 
custom-made solutions can be build that measure the speed at the contact tube. A 
more realistic approach in a production system is to measure the controlled speed 
of the drive wheel of the feeder unit. However, this must be complemented with 
securing the functionality and reliability of the feeder system as its robustness is 
important for the resulting quality of the welds. 
 
3.2 Sensors for Geometrical Parameters 
Sensors for geometrical parameters must be able to obtain information about the 
weld that relates to the geometry of the weld joint. This information is of great 
importance in order to both perform seam tracking and use this information for 
quality control of the weld. This can be done in many ways but in most cases, a 
seam tracker is able to extract some information about the weld joint besides the 
target positions for the weld joint during welding. Examples of such data include 
deviations from a nominal path, orientation changes and gap size.  
 
To apply sensors in robotics welding means, in general, to use the sensors during 
welding. In some cases sensors can be used to measure the position and orientation 
of the weld joint or work-piece before welding. In such cases, different location 
techniques can be applied in a similar way as for locating any work-piece such as 
image recognition or binary sensors to detect the position of some plates of the 
work-piece. 
 
The challenge, however, is to use sensors during welding. Due to the harsh 
environment with high temperature, intensive light and high currents, purpose built 

78 
Welding Robots 
sensors must be applied. The most common use of sensors are (i) optical sensors 
that use a laser light source on the weld joint under study and a sensor with a 
narrow bandwidth filter to extract the information of interest, and (ii) through-arc 
sensing that uses the electrical parameters from the arc together with knowledge 
about the motion of the weld torch which is controlled by the robot. 
3.2.1 Optical Sensors 
Optical sensors use the following basic principle for detecting the weld joint during 
arc welding; (i) a laser beam that is projected in a scanning motion across the seam 
and (ii) a CCD-array that is used to measure features of the weld joint in 
combination with a laser stripe. Variations of this method are in use and, as an 
example, the laser stripe may not be a linear line on the weld joint but circular 
instead. In such a case, the sensor is more flexible to detect weld joints in corners 
from one location of the torch, or point of view of the sensor. To measure the 
distance, the method of triangulation is used which is of great importance in 
welding, see Figure 3.1. 
Figure 3.1. The working method of the triangulation method [2]

 
Sensors for Welding Robots 
79 
 
A laser beam is focused on an object, and then the reflection from the object as 
seen from a lens in the laser sensor is determined by the distance between the 
sensor and the object. If the object is close to the sensor then the angle between the 
outgoing beam and the reflection through the focusing lens of the detector is large, 
while it is small if the object is farther away. The detection of the distance between 
the sensor and object is made by focusing the incoming beam on a detector, in 
most cases a CCD array. Depending on which of the pixels of the array are 
illuminated, it is possible to calculate the distance to the object. 
 
Depending on the weld joint preparation and geometrical shape, the laser beam can 
produce reflections like mirrors. Consider for example a V-groove weld joint 
where the laser light will produce several reflecting positions but with different 
intensities depending on the surfaces of the weld joint. Therefore, these sensors 
must have real time image processing capabilities to filter out reflections that do 
not belong to the point of interest. It should be noted in this context that highly 
reflective materials may cause problems during welding and a real test may be 
needed to verify the functionality. 
 
 
 
Figure 3.2. Scanning principle of a seam tracking combined with the triangulation method 
[2] 
 
The basic functionality of a triangulation sensor is to measure the distance to the 
spot of the object the beam is pointing at. In some cases this can be useful, e.g. to 
control the height during an operation of a robotized process like welding or 
cutting. But the general use of triangulation in welding is for seam tracking and 
this requires measuring the weld joint geometry. This is achieved through a 
scanning technique of the beam across the weld joint, see Figure 3.2. During the 

80 
Welding Robots 
 
scanning, the sensor acquires a two-dimensional picture of the joint profile as an 
array of 2D coordinates. When the robot is moving, a weld joint geometrical model 
can be made that contains a full 3D description of the joint which is created during 
the welding operation when the sensor is moved along the joint.  
 
If a laser stripe is projected onto the object and sensed by a 2D CCD array, the 
image information can be used directly without moving the robot. This is a 
technique that is useful if the stripe is circular and aimed at a corner. Then, the 
corner and its walls can be located from one position of the robot only, compared 
with the more time consuming traditional technique of measuring the location of 
one wall at a time.  
 
In most cases, optical seam trackers based on triangulation are used to keep the 
robot “on track” with the weld joint during welding in real time. However, these 
sensors have a capability for more than that, and information that can in most cases 
be achieved that include joint volume, gap size, misalignment, tack welds, etc. This 
information is useful for adaptive feed-back control of both the welding power 
source and the robot to perform the task in accordance with the predefined 
specifications of the welds to be produced. As an example, the travel speed of the 
welding gun defined by the robot can be controlled with respect to the gap of the 
weld and the welding power related parameters in combination.  
 
 
 
Figure 3.3. Illustration of a typical laser scanner sensor [3] mounted ahead of the welding 
torch  
 
If the gap varies, there are a few things to control: (i) the metal deposition should 
be done in a way to obtain a constant weld shape, (ii) a large gap is sensitive for 
burn-through and a control action could be to lower the travel speed together with 

 
Sensors for Welding Robots 
81 
lower wire feed speed (weld current), (iii) a too low current may however result in 
a lack of fusion and cracking in the weld and to keep a higher current a weaving 
motion of the welding torch can be applied to avoid the problem with burn-
through. This shows that the control scheme needs to consider many issues, of 
which some are boundary conditions and some are counteracting each other, 
leading to new ways to perform the weld operation. 
In robotic welding of thicker plates, the welding is usually performed in several 
passes, e.g. one root pass and additional passes to fill up the weld joint. In such 
cases, the use of a tracking sensor can be applied in several ways. Normally, 
tracking is applied for the root pass. During this operation the robot records the 
weld path and subsequent passes can be overlaid with respect to the first path based 
on the actual weld joint geometry.  
Figure 3.4. Typical standard joint types. Left column: fillet and corner joint. Right column:
lap, butt and V-groove joint [3]

82 
Welding Robots 
 
A laser-based seam tracker is typically mounted on the weld torch and has the weld 
joint in its field of view some distance ahead in the weld path direction, see Figure 
3.3. This means that the robot must use one degree of freedom to keep the sensor in 
alignment with the weld joint during welding or, alternatively, use a separate 
motion so that the sensor can rotate around the weld torch to maintain the 
alignment relationship between the sensor and the weld torch. It should also be 
noted that the seam tracking sensor must measure and deliver target positions of 
the weld torch continuously and that these must be time stamped and stored in a 
buffer for later use by the robot controller. 
 
In order to use the data from the laser scanner, weld joint features must be 
extracted from the image and a target position must be determined which is stored 
in the input buffer to the robot controller. The feature extraction algorithm is 
dependent on the weld joint to detect and is defined beforehand. Examples of 
different weld joint types are shown in Figure 3.4. 
 
 
 
Figure 3.5. Example of the steps of feature extraction of the segmentation process: (1) 
outlier elimination from the scan, (2) line segmentation generation based on the specific 
joint template, (3) join the line segments, and (4) validate against templates and tolerances 
[3] 

 
Sensors for Welding Robots 
83 
 
The feature recognition process includes the following basic tasks: (i) identification 
and elimination of outliers, (ii) contour generation of the weld profile and 
generation of line segments based on predefined templates, (iii) merging line 
segments, and (iv) validation of joint parameters so that they are within predefined 
tolerances and match the joint template, see Figure 3.5. 
 
From a control point of view, seam tracking is usually performed with full 
compensation of the position error measured. Seam tracking is typically only 
performed using a nominal path. The nominal path is the assumed trajectory of the 
weld joint and during tracking, the robot controller receives new target positions 
from the sensor and the robot controller overrides the nominal path by changing 
the position of the TCP while keeping a constant orientation. This has some 
benefits and drawbacks. The benefits are that, given a nominal path, it is rather 
straightforward to verify the ability of the robot to follow the path with some minor 
changes while keeping the orientation constant. This means that issues related to 
joint limits, singularities and possible collisions are minimized. Drawbacks are that 
the user must define and program a nominal path.  
 
If, instead, the robot is only instructed where to start and where to end, it must be 
able to follow the path measured by the sensor on the fly. This put some additional 
requirements on the robot system as it must be able to calculate the trajectory 
including both target positions and orientations of the weld torch. In doing so, the 
robot might easily get into control problems for the specific task that is related to 
close to singular areas, joint limit and collisions with the work-piece. However, the 
benefits high and more flexible control of seam tracking can be obtained using 
available sensors. 
 
In order to use the sensor data and let the robot follow the measured and generated 
trajectory, the target data from the buffer of target positions must be filtered. A 
suggested method is to use about five target positions and generate a polynomial 
curve for x, y and z and a vector tangent at the current position. This is useful for 
several reasons: (i) a generalized description of the weld joint makes it easy to 
reuse the generated trajectory for calibration purposes, (ii) the generated trajectory 
can be used as a nominal path for subsequent weld passes, (iii) the vector tangent 
can be used for subsequent target positions even if target drop-outs occur such as at 
tack welds and (iv) the vector can be compared with the current trajectory vector 
and from that an optimal orientation of the weld torch can be calculated with 
respect to the weld joint as measured by the laser scanner. 
 
Typical operating data of a laser scanner is a scan sweep frequency of 10-50 Hz. If 
we assume a welding speed of 20 mm/s, this means about one sweep per mm 
during welding. This is in most cases more than sufficient. However, new welding 
processes such as laser welding will increase the welding speed considerably and 
for high requirements careful analysis and trials must be made. The accuracy of the 
laser scanner is high and is better than 0.1 mm. However, it should be noted that 
single scan sweeps may generate outliers as the weld joint and the environment 
during welding generate severe disturbances. 

84 
Welding Robots 
 
 
From a practical point of view, laser scanners are accurate and robust sensors that 
meet most requirements within the welding process. However, they must be 
mounted on the weld torch and take up some space. They also put additional 
requirements on programming and positioning of the robot and the weld torch. 
Laser scanning sensors are also still relatively expensive and if alternative methods 
can be used like through-arc sensing as described in the next section, they are 
usually preferred. 
 
3.2.2 Through-arc Sensing 
Seam tracking using a weaving motion and the arc itself as the sensor, sometimes 
referred to as through-arc sensing, was introduced in the 1980s. The principle 
behind the method is to make use of the change in current when the distance 
between the contact tube and the work-piece varies. The underlying principle is 
relatively easy and cost-effective to use and is a common sensor for tracking 
methods in robotic welding based on gas metal arc welding and related processes, 
like flux-cored arc welding, submerged arc welding, etc. According to [4], the 
approximate relationship between arc voltage (U), arc current (I) and the contact 
tube to work-piece distance (l) is expressed by 
 
U = E, EE,El 
 
 
 
 
3.1

where the constantsE - E are dependent on factors like wire, gas and the 
characteristics of the welding power source. In most cases, the welding power 
source is set up to maintain a constant voltage and thereby a more stable welding 
process. Thus, when the value l varies, the arc current I will also change, mainly as 
a proportional change with opposite sign. This can be used in mechanized welding 
and specifically in robotized welding to perform a weaving motion during welding. 
When doing so for a weld joint as shown in Figure 3.6, the distance between the 
weld torch and the weld joint will vary during the weaving motion and so will the 
current. Hence, a longer contact tube to work-piece distance will result in a lower 
arc current than a shorter distance, given that all other parameters are the same. 
This can be utilized during an overlayed weaving motion, normally a sinus or 
triangular type of motion, but more complex motions also exist. 
 
In practice, the current is measured using a Hall Effect sensor or a current shunt. A 
low-pass filter is used to depress noise from the signal. From a control point of 
view, sensor data can be analyzed continuously using template matching or only at 
the turning points using differential control. Due to the relatively low accuracy of 
the sensor data regarding precision, etc., a differential control is in most cases 
sufficient. This should be seen in the context that the sensing principle needs a few 
mm weaving amplitude to be able to measure a reliable change and difference in 
arc current. It also indicates that achievable tolerance are restricted for those cases 
which can accept a weaving motion, which produce a wider weld rather than a 

 
Sensors for Welding Robots 
85 
 
straight motion. However, in medium to thick plates this is usually not a problem 
(thicknesses above about 3 mm).  
 
 
 
Figure 3.6. Left: definition of Tool Center Point (TCP) and weaving directions during 
through-arc sensing. Right: the optimal position for seam tracking in arc sensing [5] 
 
Experiments based on the through-arc sensing principle indicate that it is possible 
to detect a variation in contact tube to work-piece distance of about ±0.25 mm. 
This shows that the method can be used for tracking with quite small amplitudes, 
in the order of 1 mm. However, it is important that the control of the motion is 
robust so that the robot does not lose the weld joint during tracking since there is 
no obvious way to get back on track. This is due to the fact that the weld joint can 
only be detected during weaving and welding and that the field of view is equal to 
the weaving motion of the welding gun. If no weld joint is detected, there is no 
information available on how to find the joint.  
 
In practical implementations the tracking functionality is usually combined with a 
search function, specifically for the start-up phase, so that the robot starts welding 
with a weaving motion and, if no joint is found, gradually moves in a predefined 
direction perpendicular to the main nominal weld path. A search function can be 
implemented in basically two different way, (i) move the weld torch towards the 
respective plates one at a time until contact occurs, usually by measuring an 
electrical contact, and from that information calculate a starting position of the 
weld joint, or (ii) during welding define a start position for the weld and also define 
a direction of gradually moving the weld torch during weaving until it detects the 
weld and tracks the seam in a normal way. 
 
The information acquired from through-arc sensing can be retrieved and used in 
basically two different ways, either continuous measurement of the current or 
measurements at the turning points of the weaving motion. If a height control is 
included, a measurement should take place at the center of the weld joint as well. 
Based on the measurement principles above, different control principles can be 

86 
Welding Robots 
 
applied which are usually based on differential control and/or template matching of 
the signal. If template matching is used together with continuous measurement of 
the current, a more precise control can be made that can also take into account for 
non-symmetric shapes of the joint profile.

tracker which can compensate for both position and orientation changes [5] 
 
As for seam tracking using laser scanners, a nominal path is used. In multi-pass 
welding the robot controller has a function to memorize the tracked path and use 
that as a template to make subsequent welds. Similar to tracking using lasers, 
tracking is performed to change the position of the weld torch so that it will be 
aligned with the weld joint. In general, no compensation will be made for 
orientation of the weld joint. However, a control scheme can be made that 
generates a polynomial and vector description of the weld path as described above 
and the sensor principle can be used to drive the robot with subsequent target 
positions during welding. A sample simulation of through-arc seam tracking is 
shown in Figure 3.7 which displays the principle of tracking over segmented plates

which deviate both sideways and in height. In Figure 3.8, a work-piece (T-pipe) is 
shown as an example of a complex weld path that is difficult to generate a program 
for and thus, a sensor with a capability to both track and generate the weld path is a 
suitable technique. 
 
3.3 Monitoring 
The ability to monitor the weld quality automatically is important in order to 
reduce production costs and to assure and improve weld quality. An automatic 
detection system should be able to classify different weld defects such as porosity, 
metal spatter, irregular bead shape, excessive root reinforcement, incomplete 
penetration and burn-through.  
 
Monitoring systems for weld parameters such as ADM III, Arc guard, Analysator 
Hannover 10.1 and Weldcheck are commercially available [2],[6]. They all work in 
a similar way: voltage, current and other process signals are measured, presented 
and compared with preset nominal values. An alarm is triggered when any 
difference from the preset values exceeds a given threshold.  
 
Thus, an important feature of monitoring is that it is done during welding and using 
data that exist during the welding process. To be able to make any judgment about 
the quality, reference data must be available including models or algorithms that 
describes and evaluate measured parameter. 
 
An important task of any monitoring system which is used for quality assurance or 
quality control purposes is to be able to present the data with respect to quality 
measures as consistently as possible. This means that alarm thresholds defined 
must be correlated with real weld defects or relate to specifications defined in the 
WPS. An important aspect in this context is to understand that the welding process 
displays a more unstable situation when the data frequency of the readings are 
increased, and consequently, measurements of process parameters at lower 
frequencies, providing they display mean values, will display a more stable 
process.  
 
The information within the WPS does not normally account for this but includes 
nominal operating data for different controllable parameters. Thus, part of the 
monitoring system for control purposes is to define alarm thresholds with respect 
to the WPS to maintain the process within nominal parameter limits and at the 
same time produce a weld at the defined quality and productivity levels.  
 
The examples given here are limited to the detection of changes in the weld quality 
both automatically and on-line in spray GMAW when using signal processing 
methods. However, the method as such can in principle be applied to any welding 
method providing that knowledge exists about the stability criteria of the process 
and how to measure significant parameters related to the stability. 

88 
Welding Robots 
 
 
Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) is widely used in welding applications because 
of the specific advantages it offers such as reduced spatter and smoother bead 
appearance as compared with submerged arc welding. There are two stable metal 
transfer modes in GMAW: short-circuit metal transfer at low arc voltage; and spray 
metal transfer at high voltage and high current. 
 
In the field of  GMAW of steel, both physical analysis of the welding process [7]-
[11] and statistical analysis of real welding signals have been performed [12]-[21]. 
However, the problem of classifying the weld with respect to quality is still in 
focus for research and is an important area to produce efficient control systems 
which include, if not all, the most important parameters and how these affect the 
quality and productivity, and the proper definition of the corresponding WPS for 
control purposes.

Figure 3.9. Weld voltage and current waveforms for different metal transfer modes 
 
The GMAW process has three basic modes in which metal is transferred from the 
electrode tip to the work-piece, Figure 3.9. The modes can be classified as short 
circuiting transfer, globular transfer and spray transfer. In short-circuiting transfer, 
the metal is deposited during a short circuiting of the weld wire which normally 
lasts about 10ms. In globular transfer the droplet diameter is larger than the wire 
and is considered as an unwanted transfer mode. Spray transfer is a transfer mode 
where the drops are smaller than the weld wire. The type of metal transfer mode is 
a function of the weld current according to both the static force balance theory and 
the pinch instability theory [22]. As the mean current increases, the metal transfer 
goes from stubbing, through short-circuits and globular to spray transfer mode, see 
Figure 3.10.

mean current (left to right) [23] 
 
For the three main metal transfer modes there is a correlation between the voltage 
and current envelope waveforms and modes of metal transfer. The variation in the 
current and voltage waveform is reduced when moving from short-circuit to spray 
transfer and can be used to classify the transfer. To weld in short-circuiting 
GMAW mode, the open circuit voltage and the electrode wire-feed rate is set to a 
low value and in spray transfer mode, the open circuit voltage and the wire feed 
rate is set to a high value.

welding. Tp and Tb denote peak pulse time and background pulse time respectively, and Ip

3.4 Pulsed GMAW 
In pulsed GMAW the amplitude of the current alternates between two levels, see 
Figure 3.11. The advantage of this method is that the mean current, and thus the 
average heat input to the work-piece, is lower than in spray GMAW. Thanks to the 
smaller heat transfer, it is possible to weld thinner plates with pulsed GMAW than 
with spray GMAW and at the same time maintain a high metal deposition rate. 

90 
Welding Robots 
 
To limit the heat input to the work-piece, the current is low during part of the 
current cycle. This part of the cycle is denoted “background pulse time”, and is 
represented by Tb. The current during this part of the cycle comprises background 
current and is represented by  Ib. It must exceed a specified critical value in order to 
obtain a stable arc, i.e. the arc must neither go randomly over the work-piece nor 
be extinguished [24][25]. This lower current limit is defined by an empirical 
constant K1. During peak pulse time, Tp, the current is high. The electrode is 
molten, and a droplet is detached and transferred to the work-piece. The main force 
for detaching a droplet and transferring it is the electromagnetic force induced by 
the peak current, Ip. The gravity of the droplet mass plays a minor role. The 
criterion for detachment of one droplet per pulse is governed by the relationship

where K2 is a constant depending on the material, and n § 2 [25]. To achieve a 
better result, droplets should be of the spray type. If droplets grow larger than the 
electrode diameter, a globular metal transfer results, leading to greater probability 
of short-circuiting, spatter, uneven weld bead and other fusion defects. The 
approximate droplet volume is given by

where K3 is a constant and A is the electrode cross-sectional area. Wire feed rate, 
Wf should match the burn-off rate Wb, so that a constant arc length can be 
maintained. This is important to avoid burn-backs and stubbing-in, which can 
cause defective welds. The mean current, Im, is expressed by

where K4 and K5 are empirical constants for given materials and sizes. The first 
term describes the melting due to arc heat of the electrode tip and the second term 
describes the joule heating of the electrode stick-out (le) by the welding current 
flowing between the weld table and the electrode wire tip. 
 
3.4.1 Synergic Control 
The peak current of the current source used during pulsed GMAW can be current-
controlled. This means that a preset current value will be given independently of 
the impedance of the welding process. Some welding sources have an option 

 
Sensors for Welding Robots 
91 
 
preventing the electrode from getting stuck during short circuitings by 
disconnecting the current control when the peak voltage decreases the certain 
preset value. The current can thereby increase until the short-circuit is broken. 
 
To select the optimal welding parameters (Wf, Ip, Ib, Tp and Tb) by trial and error is 
a time-consuming procedure. Most manufacturers of welding sources thus use 
synergic control to simplify the parameter setting. With this method the operator 
simply chooses one parameter, e.g. the wire feed rate. The remaining parameters 
are adjusted automatically to their optimal values according to certain optimization 
criteria. The criteria to be met are [25]: 
 
1. Arc stability: background current must exceed a minimum limit for stable 
arcing. 
2. Metal transfer: spray type metal transfer must be produced. 
3. Arc length:  a constant arc length must be maintained. 
 
The arc stability is maintained if a minimum background current is kept. It is also 
important to meet other conditions like clean metal surfaces and proper shielding 
gas flow during welding. 
 
The metal transfer to obtain spray mode can be arranged by modulating the current 
in different ways and still keep the mean current at a certain value. The pulse width 
can be constant while varying the pulse repetition rate or the pulse repetition can be 
kept constant while varying the pulse width. The amplitude of the current pulse can 
also be varied to maintain a constant pulse size. 
 
The arc length (la) can be estimated by measuring the weld voltage. The voltage 
over the electrode stick-out is small compared to the arc voltage and can in general 
be omitted for most monitoring and control purposes. The arc voltage can be 
expressed as

where ȕ1, ȕ2, ȕ3 and ȕ4 are empirical constants. If we can assume that the time

and fixed current, the arc voltage can be expressed as

where K5 is a function of the current. A change in arc length will cause a change in 
arc voltage and also a change in weld voltage which makes it possible to estimate 
the arc length by measuring the weld voltage. As the arc length can be estimated, it 
is possible to build a control system that keeps the arc length constant. 
 

92 
Welding Robots 
 
The burn-off rate can be controlled by changing the mean current. This can be used 
to adjust wire burn-off rate to match the wire feed rate and a constant arc length 
can be maintained.  
 
The parameters to measure and monitor in pulsed GMAW are the pre-set values of 
the weld process (Ip, Ib, Up, Ub, Tp, Tb). The monitoring system must be able to 
detect unacceptable variations in the welding features that may generate weld 
faults.  
 
3.5 Short-circuit GMAW 
In short-circuiting welding the mean current, and thus the average heat input to the 
electrode wire and the work-piece, is lower than in spray arc GMAW. Due to the 
smaller heat transfer, short-circuiting welding makes it possible to weld thinner 
plates than with spray arc welding. The metal deposition rate and the joint 
penetration are, however, less than in spray and pulsed welding. In contrast with 
pulsed GMAW, the power source in short-circuiting and spray GMAW is voltage-
controlled. This means that the power source continuously changes its current in 
order to maintain the voltage constant at the output.  
 
The short-circuiting cycle begins with an arc that is struck between the electrode 
wire tip and the work-piece. The wire electrode melts and a small droplet is formed 
at the electrode tip. This part of the cycle is denoted “arc time” and represented by 
Ta. 
 
During the short-circuit time, Ts, the droplet at the end of the electrode touches the 
weld pool and a bridge of liquid metal is formed between the electrode and the 
weld pool. At this stage the arc will extinguish, the voltage will decrease to almost 
zero volts and the current will increase to its maximum value. Due to the high 
short-circuit current, necking of the liquid bridge starts to occur, ending in rupture 
of the liquid bridge. The molten metal is then transferred from the electrode tip to 
the weld pool by the force of the surface tension of the weld pool, the gravitational 
force and electromagnetic pinch force (induced by the current). After the droplet is 
detached from the electrode and transferred to the work-piece the arc is reestab-
lished and the cycle starts over again.   
 
The short-circuiting transfer mode has two degenerated modes of metal transfer, 
the short-term short circuiting, meaning that the short circuits last for durations less 
than 1-1.5 ms; and stubbing of the electrode in the weld pool, with the result that 
the droplet growth cannot occur in the normal way. Stubbing-in of the electrode, 
short-term short-circuits and globular metal transfer are considered  to be unstable, 
while short-circuiting and spray transfer are considered to be a stable process. 
 
In order to produce weld joints with uniform weld quality, it is desirable that the 
welding process is stable. This means that the metal transfer from the electrode 

 
Sensors for Welding Robots 
93 
 
wire to the work-piece should be as regular as possible. Experiments indicate that 
in the short-circuiting mode, optimal process stability occurs when the short-circuit 
frequency is equal to the oscillation frequency of the weld pool [26],[27]. The 
experiments also show that the weld pool oscillation frequency is mainly 
determined by the width of the weld.  
 
When the short-circuit frequency and oscillation frequency of the weld pool are 
unsynchronized, the oscillating weld pool surface will fail to contact the growing 
droplet at the electrode tip at regular intervals. Hence, larger variation in arc time, 
short-circuiting time and transferred droplet mass will occur, and as a result there 
will be a lower process stability. When the short-circuit rate is synchronized with 
the weld pool oscillations, optimal process stability is obtained. 
 
From the physics of the short-circuit GMAW process it follows that a natural 
choice of feature to monitor is the mean and standard deviation of the short-circuit 
frequency. Other features have been suggested in the available literature and 
include for example the use of an arc stability index which is based on the standard 
deviation of short-circuit time, the arcing time, the average short-circuit current 
and the average arc current. The specific features used may be dependent on the 
specific algorithm and the welding condition. However, studies made have shown 
that the mean and standard deviation of the arc time, the short-circuit time, the 
peak current, the short-circuit rate and the standard deviation of the short-circuit 
rate etc. are less effective features than the variance of the weld voltage in order to 
detect a defect weld [1]. 
 
3.6 Spray GMAW 
In spray GMAW the metal drops are smaller or of the same size as the diameter of 
the electrode wire. This was the original type of metal transfer used when GMAW 
was initially developed. Due to the large heat input to the work-piece when 
welding in spray transfer mode, the weld joint produced has good penetration, 
which often is desirable. On the other hand, the considerable heat input also creates 
a large weld pool which may be difficult to control. Thus normal spray transfer is 
limited to flat and horizontal positions and cannot be used to weld thin materials. 
 
The standard type of power source for GMAW has voltage amplitude 
characteristics which are not constant but which drop slightly with increasing 
current. The advantage of such power sources is that they have a tendency to 
maintain a constant arc length. This has been termed “self-adjusting arc” [23]. 
When the contact tube to work-piece distance is increased the arc length is also 
increased. The disturbance in the form of arc length enlargement results in a 
change in the working point along the power source slope. Arc voltage increases in 
this way by a change in voltage, at the same time as the mean current decreases. It 
should be noted here that a small variation in arc voltage results in substantial 
current swing. Reduction of the current leads to a decrease in the wire burn-off rate 

94 
Welding Robots 
 
resulting in an automatic adjustment of the arc length towards its stable operating 
point. Decreasing the arc length has the opposite effect. This indicates that a 
change in contact-tube to work-piece distance is reflected almost entirely in the 
change of the electrode extension. 
 
The metal transfer mode is not the only property of the welding process that is 
influenced by the weld current. Penetration width, depth, burn-off rate, arc stability 
and arc rooting are all also influenced by the weld current. It is thus desirable that 
the mean current is constant and stable. The current is not so easy to control since 
small variations in arc voltage results in a large current swing. From the discussion 
on the physics of the GMAW process it follows that the mean amplitude of the 
weld current is likely to be a suitable feature for detection of changes in weld 
quality. 
 
3.7 Fault Detection Using Monitoring 
The strength and appearance of the weld joint are important properties when 
welding two metal pieces together. In GMAW the strength of the weld joint is 
mainly determined by the bead width and weld penetration. Parameters in GMAW 
which affect the weld penetration and bead geometry are for example: 
 
x 
Welding current 
x 
Arc voltage 
x 
Welding speed 
x 
Wire feed rate 
x 
Electrode extension 
x 
Electrode composition and diameter 
x 
Shielded gas composition and flow rate 
 
Considerable skill and experience are needed to select the optimal welding 
parameters for each weld application. Deviation from the optimal settings of the 
parameters may change the weld joint geometry and cause deterioration in the weld 
joint strength. Furthermore, deviation from the optimal settings will also increase 
the probability of such weld defects as cracks, porosity, undercuts, microfissures, 
etc., which will further decrease the strength of the weld joint.

slight change as the weld errors occur. A sophisticated monitoring feature will however 
provide a robust alarm detection, in this case a sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) [1] 
 
In practice, however, the optimal weld parameters for a specified weld joint are 
difficult to achieve. An experienced welder uses instead visual inspection of the arc 
stability and surface profile of the weld joint in order to select the proper weld 
parameters. For monitoring and quality control purposes, different strategies and 
use of the technology can be applied. Nominal parameter settings are usually 
defined prior to welding and any deviation from these values should be considered 
as a potential reason for decreased quality. However, it is also important to 
understand the acceptable tolerances of the parameter settings and how different 
parameters affect the weld. Thus, the task of the monitoring system is to measure 
welding parameters and extract features that indicate the quality of the weld with 
respect to preset values and provide these as a basis for further control actions.

A number of defects in the weld joint will only give rise to minor changes in the 
weld voltage and current or some other process parameters. As an example, a butt-
weld is welded; after some distance, the weld torch is not following the weld joint, 
see Figure 3.12. By only measuring the welding parameters, only small changes 
can be observed. Modern monitoring systems are however designed to extract 
features from the data that highlight weld faults. Another problem is that too 
sensitive detection will generate false alarms. This can be handled by regarding 
random fluctuations as noise and the monitoring system must be able to observe 
and classify such signals as a random variable.  
 
To select a detection threshold, two conflicting requirements must be considered. 
First, the threshold should be low enough to ensure that the probability of detection 
is not too small. Second, the threshold should be high enough to ensure that the 
false alarm probability will not be too large. For example, in practice, the false 
alarm probability must be low when welding hundreds of meters of tube. The 
welding process must not be stopped every meter due to false alarms. A simple 
detection algorithm can be realized by simply comparing the actual variance of the 
weld voltage (AC power level) with a particular preset level referring to a normal 
welding condition. In this way the difference between the preset level and the 
actual level is measured. A small difference will indicate a normal welding 
condition, while a large difference indicates a fault condition. For short welds the 
situation is the opposite and the system must be more sensitive to process 
disturbances which can produce quality problems. A general problem is that there 
is a run-in phase of the weld process which is difficult to monitor with respect to 
quality control. This means that a smaller proportion of short welds can be 
monitored with respect to quality and also for counteracting control. In practice, 
different strategies can be used, specifically if the same welding operation is made 
many times. In such cases template matching techniques can be used. If the weld is 
for low volume or one-off production, generic methods must be applied. 
 
3.8 Design of a Monitoring System for Quality Control 
The task of a monitoring system for quality control is to extract some features of 
the welding process, filter these as necessary and make use of them to detect 
changes in the process. The system consists of sensors, a signal conditioning unit, a 
feature extraction algorithm and a fault detection algorithm, see Figure 3.13. For 
control purpose, specific control algorithms must be included which should include 
the capability to map the monitored data with respect to quality and productivity 
specifications.  
 
Sensors provide information about the system being monitored like the weld 
current, the arc voltage, the weld speed, the electrode extension, the wire feed rate 
and the shielded gas flow. They are all representing properties that affect the weld. 

 
Sensors for Welding Robots 
97 
 
All parameters except the electrode extension can be measured directly, but the 
electrode extension can be estimated from the weld current and the weld voltage.  
 
The analog signal conditioning unit carries out low-pass filtering of the analog 
signals from the sensors in order to prevent aliasing after the A/D converter. As the 
environment around the measurements of the weld process can be highly disturbed 
by electrical noise, the filter has the additional task of suppressing such noise. The 
bandwidth required for the monitoring system is, however, mainly determined by 
the short-circuit time, which is in the order of milliseconds, or about 500 Hz. The 
rise time of the whole system should not exceed 10 % of the short-circuit time and 
thus, the bandwidth needed should be in the order of 5 kHz. This makes it possible 
to extract features like peak pulse time, background pulse time and short- circuit 
time with adequate accuracy. Furthermore, high voltage transients caused by 
spatter or short-circuitings can also be measured. 
 
 
 
Figure 3.13. Block diagram for a monitoring system 
 
Most modern commercial monitoring systems for GMAW divide the process into 
time segments or windows and the sample mean for each segment is estimated. 
These features are filtered and compared with a predefined threshold. As a result of 
the mean value calculation, information about higher frequencies is lost since the 
mean value of the signal has gone through a low-pass filtering process.  
 
An appropriate feature which retains information about higher frequencies is the 
variance. This is due to the fact that the variance (or the area below the curve of the 
power spectral density) is an AC power estimate. A change in variance due to 
disturbance is an indication of changes in the power spectral density.  
 
Another feature which may be relevant for monitoring purposes is the peak of the 
weld voltage spectrum. When welding in either the spray arc or short-circuiting

mode, the spectrum peak changes when going from the normal welding condition 
to a fault welding condition.  
 
When using an extended monitoring system, time information can also be used. 
Some of the features refer to the parameters of pulsed GMAW like peak and 
background current, peak and background voltage, and peak and background pulse 
time. In short-circuiting welding the features are typically short-circuit time, arc 
time, peak current or arc voltage.  
 
However, for a simple monitoring system the primary feature to be monitored 
when welding in the spray mode is the mean of the weld current. The variance of 
the weld voltage can be used when welding in short-circuiting or pulsed mode. 
Also, a short-circuiting detector algorithm can be useful when welding in pulsed 
mode.  
 
The fault detection algorithm provides variance reduction of the monitored features 
as well as a limit detector. The principle of applying a variance reduction 
technique, i.e. the filtering of the features, is that it results in increasing detection 
reliability by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio for the resulting test quantity, i.e. 
the filtered features. The algorithms developed and used (and partly exemplified 
here) should be applied to each feature extracted from the signals measured. It is 
important to note that data from the normal welding condition is assumed to be 
available in order to train or validate the algorithms. 
 
It should therefore be noted that a monitoring system for quality control purposes 
should not only measure the defined welding data and compare these with the 
nominal, but also be able to calculate the variance of measured data to retain 
information about higher frequencies. To do this, algorithms must be adapted for 
fast calculations and response. This is needed since the bandwidth of the 
monitoring system basically is dependent and selected based on features from the 
process to be monitored. Thus, an indication of the frequency of pulses in short- 
circuit mode or pulsed GMAW is in the order of 100 Hz or 10ms. During 
monitoring, a number of pulses or drop transfers should be monitored as some 
could be outliers with respect to process stability criteria without affecting the 
quality of the weld. A typical value could be 500 data samples representing about 
five pulses or drop transfers. But given this, to define a threshold for correcting 
measures of the process is a delicate decision. If one such quality estimate indicates 
a change in the process stability, we might want to wait with any control actions 
until we have the estimate from the next 500 data samples. The reasons for this are 
simply that (i) such short disturbances do occur, (ii) more information is in general 
needed to get an indication how to stabilize the process, and (iii) in most cases, the 
weld processes do have some quite different characteristics with respect to time; 
many parameters and phenomena are truly rapid in nature and need some special 
attention to measure and monitor these, but the resulting weld is in general 
somewhat forgiving if we are able to react on a disturbance and get the process 
back to a stable arc again within a short time. How short this time is, is in principle 
dependent on the size of the weld pool. It is of course better to react quickly, but

for most cases, control measures should be taken within 5 mm weld, which usually 
is in the order of 0.5 s. It should also be noted that a process disturbance in real 
welding usually comes gradually and in such cases, it is important for the 
monitoring system to detect this and make a smooth adjustment of the weld 
parameters.  
 
From a practical point of view there are many reasons to customize and tune the 
control of the process. In most cases, any changes that may affect the quality 
gradually increase, like a change in the gap. If the change is abrupt, we might not 
be able to compensate for quality by control actions but have to stop the process. 
However, in such cases, we can accept waiting for some time with the decision 
from the monitoring system. This indicates that it is a matter of compromise 
between measured and detected irregularities on the one hand and resulting faults 
as defined in the WPS on the other, including trade-offs between quality and 
productivity. Unwanted stops during a weld may introduce quality concerns as well 
as decrease productivity.  
 
Thus, the use of monitoring techniques should be an integrated part of the robot 
welding system including the definition of Welding Procedure Specifications. The 
algorithms used to monitor the process will depend on the process and what critical 
fault to detect. Another issue is the sensitivity to errors, which must be handled 
with an in-depth understanding of the purpose of the monitoring system and what 
is does. 
 
3.9 Monitoring System Development – An Example 
Some examples from experiments will be described here to show the benefits in 
quality control of the welding operation performed by the robot [1]. For this 
purpose, it is important to apply a method that is fast and robust with respect to 
detection time and number of false alarms. The setting of these parameters should, 
for each case, be possible to adapt according to the requirements as there is 
generally a trade-off between quality vs productivity.  
 
3.9.1 Short-circuiting GMAW  
In order to produce weld joints of uniform weld quality, it is desirable that the weld 
process is stable. Experiments have shown that in the short-circuit mode, optimal 
process stability occurs when the short-circuit frequency equals the oscillation 
frequency of the weld pool. Optimal process stability can also be described to 
have: 
 
x 
A maximum short-circuit rate (Number/s) 
x 
A minimum  standard deviation of the short-circuit rate 

100 Welding Robots 
 
x 
A minimum mass transferred per short-circuit 
x 
A minimum spatter loss 
 
A deviation from the optimal welding conditions is assumed to lead to a higher 
probability of spatter, uneven weld-bead and other fusion effects. To detect this, it 
is shown that monitoring of the weld voltage and using the variance of the voltage 
is a robust feature. Other features could also be used like short-circuiting rate and 
arc time, but they are less robust to detect defective welds.

function will set the alarm above the threshold level. The values of the x-axis represents 
millimeters along the weld joint [1] 
 
The variance of the weld voltage is measured over 1024 samples and calculated. 
For each sample section an alarm decision function is accumulated if the variance 
decreases below a predefined value. The alarm value of the decision function will 
indicate accumulated successive variance measurements below the alarm threshold 
and the defined threshold will thus reduce the number of false alarms, see Figure 
3.14. As mentioned before, this is a robust method to deal with the trade-off 
between quality and productivity and such alarm limits must be defined case by 
case. 
 
3.9.2 Spray GMAW 
Due to the self-regulated weld voltage and the much higher swing in weld current, 
the mean of the amplitude of the weld current is a suitable parameter for detection 
of changes in the weld quality when welding in spray arc mode. The weld current 
influences not only the metal transfer mode, but also penetration, width, depth,

burn-off rate, arc stability and arc rooting. It is therefore desirable that the mean 
current is constant and stable. 
 
By selecting suitable statistical detection algorithms a change in the weld condition 
can be detected that produces decreased quality. This can be combined with a 
decision function that accumulates over time and produces a weld error alarm after 
a preset threshold value, defined case by case. 
 
3.10 Discussion 
In general, applying sensors to measure parameters at the welding process is a 
difficult task as the process environment is a challenge to apply sensors in with 
high temperature, liquid metal, high current, spatter, etc. Due to this, it is common 
that parameters which we can observe by sensors are not the same as we want to 
control. Thus, a simple feed-back control is often not adequate or possible to 
obtain. Instead, models must be developed that map the observable parameters to 
proper actions within a model based control concept that focuses on relevant issues 
defined within a welding specification procedure. Here, productivity and quality 
measures should be defined together with nominal data to produce the weld (weld 
joint data, weld data for the welding power source and for the robot). Therefore, to 
utilize fully the information from sensors, a model based control should be applied 
together with welding procedure specifications that are defined with robotized 
welding and model based control in mind. 
 
Seam tracking sensors are the most commonly used sensor systems in robotic 
welding. In general, two types of seam trackers exist, laser triangulation based 
scanners and through arc trackers which need a weaving motion of the weld torch 
during welding. Although laser based sensors have a better performance with 
respect to accuracy and resolution, the choice is not obvious in a real case. The 
through arc sensor works only during welding and can only measure anything 
through the arc and hence, the operating “scan” is equal to the weaving amplitude. 
This is critical for the run-in sequence of a weld using the sensor. However, the 
sensor detects the weld right at the weld arc with reasonable accuracy, although not 
all joints can be detected in a proper way compared to a laser sensor which is 
mounted in front of the welding torch and thus takes up some space and also 
requires being in line with the weld joint during welding. In addition to this rather 
scattered picture, the price of the two most frequently used seam-tracking sensors 
are quite different; the through-arc sensor is a low cost sensor while the laser 
sensor is to be considered as rather expensive. Thus, in reality the choice is 
dependent on many interacting factors within the specification of the task to be 
performed. 
 
Monitoring systems are for the most part used in production where high quality is 
required. They provide in general the necessary means to work in real time with 
quality assurance and, if needed, stop the welding operation if the weld is found to 

102 Welding Robots 
 
be defective with respect to predefined specification and/or nominal operating 
parameters. Methods also exist to use the data from monitoring systems to control 
the weld process in real time through a model based control scheme. However, 
such control needs to be tuned for every case and is not in general use today.

Robotic Welding: System Issues 
4.1 Introduction 
Robotic welding research deals with the relevant technical and scientific aspects 
involved in the task of reproducing the work of the experienced and skilled human 
welder. Welding was for a long time a task performed only by humans, being a 
craft that combines skill with art and science. Automating welding is therefore a 
very difficult and demanding objective, because of the required adaptive behavior 
of the automatic system. 
 
It can be considered that any welding operation is constituted by three very 
different phases [1],[2]: 
 
1. Preparation phase: where the welding operator sets up the parts to be 
welded, the welding apparatus (power source, robot, robot program, etc.) 
and the welding parameters. The type of gas and the type of wire are also 
selected in this phase. If any CAD/CAM or other offline programming 
facility is used then a robot welding pre-program is available and should 
be placed on-line. This aspect is very important since currently most of 
the welding pieces are designed using CAD software. Consequently, that 
software should be used to generate robot programs that could work as 
starting points for the welding tasks, needing only minor tuning due to 
calibration [3]. That may be done easily by the welding operator just by 
performing selected on-line simulations of the process [1]-[3], calibrating 
in this way the robot program that should then be ready for production. 
2. Welding phase: considering a manual welding operation, the welder acts 
by adjusting the process variables just by continuously observing the 
welding operation and the correspondent results. If automatic equipment 
is used to perform the welding operation, then the same capabilities must 
be present, i.e., the system should be able to maintain the torch orientation 
while following the desired trajectory (that may be different from the 

106 Welding Robots 
 
planned one), perform seam tracking and change welding parameters in 
real-time. With those capabilities available the system should be capable 
of emulating the adaptive behavior showed by the manual welder. 
3. Analysis phase: this is normally a post-welding phase where the manual 
welder, or welding operator in the case of an automatic welding system, 
examines the obtained welds and decides if they are acceptable or if 
changes are needed in the two previous phases. In the particular case of an 
automatic system, this phase can be performed automatically, or by means 
of user input using specific software interfaces. When advance sensors are 
used, like laser 3D cameras, this phase can be executed on-line during the 
welding phase. This is particularly interesting since evaluation of welding 
quality on-line may influence the ongoing welding process. 
 
Consequently, when designing a fully automated robotic welding system all the 
above welding phases must be considered as a way to achieve a good performance 
and welding quality. The following sections detail some of the relevant problems, 
namely: modeling and control the welding process, system interfaces and 
programming environments. 
 
4.1 Modeling the Welding Process 
Modeling the welding process is basically a theoretical problem (a physics problem 
mainly) and a technological problem, i.e., understanding the welding process 
requires theoretical studies but also extensive experimentation to obtain the 
governing models. Several of the most interesting welding processes were 
explained in Chapter 2, giving practical guidelines about the relationships between 
the variables and the parameters that characterize the welding process. Part of the 
current knowledge on welding is empirical and based on detailed experimentation, 
which focuses on technological aspects. Consequently, the strategy used in this 
book was to present the most interesting welding processes from a robotics and 
automation point of view, focusing on the technological characteristics and 
automatic system requirements. The physics of the process is briefly introduced 
and the reader referred to other technical publications, as a way to identify the 
process parameters relevant for each welding process.  
 
4.1.1 Definition and Detection of the Process Parameters 
To design a welding robotic system the first step is to identify the process related 
parameters, i.e., the parameters that should be controlled in a way to obtain the 
desired quality, also defined by a set of accepted characteristics (Figure 4.1). The 
process related input parameters can be classified into three different categories: 
 
1. Primary inputs: variables that can be modified on-line during the 
welding process. Taking as example the GMAW process, the primary 

 
Robotic Welding: System Issues 107 
 
welding parameters are the voltage, the wire feed rate, and the torch 
speed. Technically, the voltage and the wire feed rate are analog signals 
commanded to the welding power source, and generated from the robot 
controller or process PLC. The torch speed is the desired speed 
commanded to the robot TCP for coordinated motion. 
2. Secondary inputs: variables defined when the process is selected and 
before any welding service. Using again as example the GMAW process 
those parameters include the type or composition of the shielding gas, the 
flow of gas during the process, the torch angle, and the type and size of 
the wire to use. 
3. Fixed inputs: parameters that are fixed and cannot be changed by the 
user. These parameters are usually an imposition of the selected welding 
process, of the current welding procedure or of the physical setup. 
Parameters of this type include the joint geometry, plate thickness, 
physical properties of the plate metal, etc. 
 
 
Figure 4.1. Overview of a welding control system 
 
All these parameters must be handled carefully, namely the correct preparation of 
the setup and the selection of the secondary inputs are fundamental to control the 
primary inputs efficiently.  
 
Another important set of parameters are the output parameters. Those parameters 
characterize the weld and are used to evaluate its quality. In a general way, there 
are two types of output parameters: geometrical and metallurgical.  
 
Geometrical parameters result from the process mass balance, and basically define 
the way how the transferred metal fills the welding joint. Consequently, the basic 
parameters used to classify an acceptable weld are the penetration, the bead width, 
the bead height and the cross-sectional area, if we consider a V-Groove weld, and 
the penetration and the length of both legs for a fillet weld (Figure 4.2). The 
penetration is a very important parameter to evaluate the quality of the weld, 
because it is related to the way the weld metal combined with the base metal

during the welding process. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to control the 
penetration during the welding process since there is no way to measure it on-line.  
 
 
 
Figure 4.2. V-groove and fillet weld geometrical parameters 
 
Sensors are used in robotic welding to detect and measure the process features and 
parameters [4]-[7], namely the joint geometry and the weld pool geometry and 
location, used for on-line control of the welding process. Nevertheless, sensors are 
also used to perform weld inspection and quality evaluation. 
 
The first basic thing to achieve with a fully automatic robotic welding system is the 
capability to follow precisely the joint to be welded [3]-[11]. This is because the 
welding quality depends very much on the welding pool position apart from its 
geometry. A pre-programmed path cannot be obtained with the desired precision, 
since deviations from the programmed path are likely due to deficient path 
definition, but also due to material plate deficiencies and to the effect of heating 
the plates. Consequently, an on-line joint recognition and seam tracking system 
must be available. Several techniques have been used for joint detection and seam 
tracking, namely for welding robotic systems. Using the arc characteristics 
exploiting the proportional relationship between the welding current and the 
distance from the electrode to the work-piece, as proposed by Cook [12], was one 
of the first approaches. All technicians working in welding are familiar with the 
weaving techniques used to obtain the joint geometrical profile. In fact, the only 
thing that is needed is a current sensor and a comparison system: setting the 
reference as the current reading for a perfectly centered torch on the actual welding

situation, the center of the welding joint can be obtained just be weaving the arc 
along the joint and reading the current signal [13]. When the torch is centered the 
difference between the two signals is zero (Figure 4.3), and the signal can be used 
to position the robot carrying the torch. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.3. Using the current signal to find the joint center position 
 
This approach is slow, does not work well with all types of joints and requires 
weaving motions which may not be desirable or possible for certain welds. 
Nevertheless, this is a commercially available system. 
 
The utilization of vision systems permits more accurate results [4],[5],[12]. Many 
researchers tried to use CCD cameras to obtain the joint image and compute the 
track to follow and even evaluate quality of the weld [6]. Those approaches 
suffered from CCD saturation due to the light generated by the arc, and 
interference due to the electromagnetic field also generated by the electric arc, 
which did not make them ideal for on-line seam tracking. Nevertheless, they could 
be used for joint detection, for weld pool detection and for quality control, with the 
selection of an appropriate narrow band filter and/or optimizing the placement of 
the camera in such a way to avoid the arc light and electromagnetic interference. 
Since these solutions are not robust when several welding processes are

considered, the most used approach with CCD cameras is to make a teaching pass 
before the welding process is actually initiated. Theoretically this is a good 
solution since a good reading of the welding seam can be recorded and used to 
guide the system during the welding process. The drawbacks of this approach are 
the reduction of arc-on time and the insensitivity to deviations, even if small, of the 
welding seam that can happen due to the extremely high temperatures 
characteristic of the welding process and deficiencies on the material of the plates 
to be welded [13]-[19]. 
 
The laser based 3D cameras have been used successfully for joint detection, seam 
tracking and weld inspection. These cameras work in a very simple way, based on 
the principle of laser triangulation. A low power laser source is used to generate a 
laser beam that is projected onto the surface of the joint to weld. The reflected light 
is picked up by a lens that feeds the imaging system composed usually of a CCD or 
CMOS sensor. The laser reflected signals are extracted using filters and image 
processing software, which is a simple task since the laser signal has a very precise 
wavelength and power (Figure 4.4).

In fact these laser cameras and related processing hardware and software, with 
some customization to the selected application [20], are very useful for evaluating 
most of the geometric parameters besides the already mentioned joint detection and 
seam tracking features. Since they are available with powerful APIs for general 
use, with standard interfaces for robot controllers and current computer hardware, 
this type of sensors constitute a powerful tool for robotic welding. 
 
Another very important and challenging parameter is the penetration. Basically, a 
good weld has constant penetration along the weld path, and consequently the 
welding system should be capable of keeping that goal despite possible variations 
in the joint geometry. If full penetration is achieved then there are some methods to 
observe the penetration on-line, but in cases of partial penetration there are no 
means to monitor its evolution. Several methods were designed to measure the 
penetration [21] when full penetration is achieved, but most of them require back-
face bead measurements requiring access to the back of the work-piece, which isn’t 
always possible. Measuring front-face bead geometrical characteristics, along with 
the weld bead temperature provides the means to estimate the penetration. This 
means a good understanding of the welding process behavior, so that a precise 
model, correlating two dimensional measurements of the weld pools with the three 
dimensional shape of the same weld pool, can be written and used for on-line 
penetration control. Using ultrasonic techniques is also possible [21] as an 
alternative, since a full model description is difficult to obtain and, although 
desirable, has not been achieved yet. 
 
Metallurgical aspects are also important for the welding quality, since they 
determine important mechanical characteristics like hardness, soundness, strength 
and residual stresses. Those very important mechanical parameters are not easy to 
measure on-line and are a consequence of several mechanisms. Nevertheless, they 
all result from the heat generated in the welding process. And since the welding 
process is basically based on heat, the following is needed to guarantee an 
acceptable weld:  
 
1. A certain peak temperature is needed to achieve a good metal fusion and 
penetration. 
2. A roughly uniform temperature distribution, centered in the weld joint, is 
required to achieve a constant weld. 
3. Acceptable cooling rates, compatible with the required metallurgical 
characteristics of the final work-piece, are also needed.  
 
All these requirements focus on the need to monitor all the thermal events of the 
welding process, which adds to the other geometrical measurements requirements 
that a successful robotic welding system must implement.

4.2 Control of the Welding Process 
To control effectively the welding process the automatic robotic system should 
adapt to actual conditions, like the human welder does, and be able to move 
effectively the welding torch and control the power source. Several 
implementations are reported in the literature, but here the survey is post-1990 
since surveys reported in the 1980s were more or less consistent in saying that few 
robotic systems had adaptive capabilities, although several had seam tracking 
capabilities [21].  
 
Basically there are three major needs to be able to mimic effectively the human 
welder with a automatic robotic system (Figure 4.5): 
1. A knowledge base 
2. Sensors and interfaces 
3. Programmable and flexible control system facility

4.2.1 Knowledge Base 
As already explained in Chapter 2, the welding process is very difficult to model 
which suggests that a rule base approach [8],[22],[23] would be advisable instead 
of an explicit mathematical model approach. That means exporting to a knowledge 
base the relevant information for a specific welding process and setup, so that the 
adaptive behavior could be still obtained. That can be done in several ways: using 
neural networks or fuzzy rule base approaches, simple lookup tables for the 
relevant parameters, etc. As always, simplicity is desirable and a solution that 
could grow with experience, just by adding new rules or more training, would be 
ideal for a physics process as complex as welding. 
 
4.2.2 Sensors and Interfaces 
The existence of smart sensors is fundamental to achieve a good solution for a 
robotic welding system that is necessarily distributed, i.e., it is based in the 
distribution of functions through the components of the system as a policy for 
efficiency and organization. Since the most promising sensors and sensor 
techniques have already been presented in Chapter 3, the focus here is given to the 
interfaces and system architecture. 
 
The basic components of a single cell robotic welding system include a robot 
manipulator, the robot controller, the welding torch, the welding power source, and 
the sensors adopted to monitor and sense the process parameters (Figure 4.6).  
 
 
 
Figure 4.6. Single cell robotic welding system 
 
Nevertheless, an industrial application may include several robots, and sensors, and 
welding power sources, which means that data networks must be present to 

114 Welding Robots 
 
connect all the parts of the system. These networks may range from TCP/IP 
Ethernet networks, used for example for high-level communication between 
computers and controllers, to fieldbuses, used for example to make high-frequency 
connections between sensors and controllers (Figure 4.7). 
 
If the sensors are considered in particular, it should be emphasized that the 
perspective here is to reach intelligent sensors, i.e., sensors that have a 
microprocessor, some way of dealing with Remote Procedure Calling (RPC) and 
asynchronous events. If that is available, then the sensor can be programmed to 
feed the necessary data at the specified sampling rate, when necessary, and fire 
programmed events when the relevant information is available. This means that the 
robotic welding systems must be ready to implement distributed software 
architectures and must be event driven systems, or at least must allow events to be 
used for obtaining asynchronous information and influence the system behavior. 
 
 
 
Figure 4.7. Networked robotic welding system: multi-cell 
 
Let’s consider for example a laser 3D camera, a sensor used for seam tracking but 
also for welding inspection [20]. For the seam tracking task all that is needed is the 
information from the sensor (available in the form of IO signals or a serial data 
interface), which can be used to guide the robot through the welding track, keeping 
the torch centered with the seam middle section. The sensor can be connected 
directly to the robot controller if the necessary signals and software interfaces are 
available, which is generally the case. Usually this is a low-level interface that acts 
on the robot motion controller and enables fast correction of the pre-programmed 
trajectories. Another solution could be a connection through the high-level 
programming interface, which is not desirable because it is high-level and 
necessarily slower. This should only be used for seam tracking if the low-level 
interface is not available in the robot controller. 
 

 
Robotic Welding: System Issues 115 
 
Nevertheless, the above-mentioned high-level interface can be used for other non-
intensive and lower frequency tasks, which could include inspection, monitoring 
surface scanning, etc. Being microprocessor based, sensors can be programmed to 
feed the controlling computer with the required data streams, respond to remote 
commands and fire events. That means that a collection of services, that includes 
event firing services, must be available in the sensor, along with a programming 
API that provides to the user means to explore all the sensors functionalities from 
the available network using some type of RPC (Figure 4.8).  
 
The same applies to CCD cameras and generally to any microprocessor based and 
programmable sensor, i.e., it should be possible to define all the sensor 
functionalities, and develop a set of functions and the interface mechanism that 
could enable the users to explore all the sensor features at the desired way and rate. 
When using a camera the primary data feed is not an image of the welding process, 
since generally those are large collections of data and require post-processing, 
which is not suitable for any real-time experiment. The vision systems should be 
able to acquire images, extract the relevant user-defined features just by processing 
the acquired image, and return them through the available interface. Those relevant 
features are usually simple things like areas, distances, etc., i.e., numbers that are 
very easy to transmit and don’t overload the network with very long data streams.

4.4 Programmable and Flexible Control Facility 
To be able to use a robot manipulator, the required sensors and the necessary 
welding equipment, on a robotic welding application, it’s necessary to outline the 
software architecture that could be used as the developing platform. The challenges 
posed by a robotic welding system are not different from the ones posed by a 
typical flexible manufacturing system based on robots. Consequently, the software 
architecture presented here was designed to be used with general robotic 
manufacturing cells that may include several types of equipment like robot 
manipulators, mobile robots, PLCs, CNC machines, vision systems and several 
types of sensors, etc. Usually these systems use different programming languages, 
even when the manufacturer is the same. It is then very difficult to make 
adjustments to the cell functionality, or adapt it to new requirements posed by the 
introduction of a new product or by changes introduced in existing products. 
Several research and technical efforts have been made to overcome these problems. 
Many of those efforts point to solutions that consider the development of general 
programming languages that could be used with any equipment, relying on 
individual interpreters to generate the specific code for any equipment. 
Nevertheless, recent research works show that it is desirable to have a flexible 
environment and still program each machine using its own language [24],[25]. The 
reason is simple: a general syntax means introducing generalizations and 
simplifications that tend to limit the potentiality of the equipment. Consequently, 
some parameterization is not used, special non-grouped functions are not used and 
the generated code takes always a uniform structure which may not be the best for 
all machines.  
 
The idea presented here is significantly different, being an alternative for the 
solutions presented in the literature [27], and also for the software products truly 
distributed available on the market [28]-[30]. The basic idea is to define for each 
individual machine a collection of software functions that expose all its basic 
operational features. That objective requires local processing capabilities, 
availability of communication channels and support for the standard technologies 
used when implementing the services, installed on the individual machines. Since 
the vast majority of the current robotics and automation (R&A) equipment meets 
these requirements fully, this is not a serious limitation. It should also be stressed 
that the above-mentioned services are to be offered through a local network, on a 
distributed software framework based on the client-server model. Furthermore, 
using those services from the remote client computer to build controlling and 
inspection applications can be performed from any platform (UNIX, Linux, 
Win32-DCOM, etc.), using standard programming languages (C, C++, C#, Visual 
Basic, etc.). 
 
Several approaches can be used and are currently available from various robot 
manufacturers, with specific details and implementations. Nevertheless, the 
following objectives are pursued by any of the above-mentioned software 
architectures:  
 

 
Robotic Welding: System Issues 117 
 
1. Be able to represent the robot manipulator motion based on the kinematic 
and dynamic models, but also based on real-time data coming from the real 
robot. That can be done using available mathematical and graphical 
software packages, like Matlab® for example. This latest objective clearly 
indicates the need to access robot motion and status information in real-
time from the mathematical package. 
2. Be able to develop applications to explore remotely the entire installation 
(robot and welding application, for example) using standard programming 
languages (C, C++, C#, Visual Basic, etc.). 
3. Be able to integrate and explore intelligent sensors used to obtain 
information from the process under control. 
4. Enable users to explore the advanced programming capabilities of actual 
robot controllers, namely the local programming capabilities, based on a 
dedicated programming language complemented by extensive libraries of 
functions, and the optimized manipulation capabilities based on trajectory 
planning software that takes advantages of optimized kinematic and 
dynamic models. 
5. Enable users to build flexible manufacturing cells, which leads to the 
possibility to explore the available industrial data network, the possibility 
to distribute software to the various components of the system, and the 
capacity to build remote software applications to control and monitor 
industrial manufacturing cells; 
6. Develop advanced Human Machine Interface (HMI) solutions to operate 
with industrial systems, hiding from the users all the tricky details about 
implementation, allowing them to focus on the operational details, i.e., to 
focus on how systems work and how they can be explored efficiently. 
7. Provide ways that could allow developers to focus on the important things 
about the application they are building: the control algorithm, program 
functionality and HMI. All the details related with communications, sensor 
integration, etc., should be hidden from the user. 
 
Taking into consideration these objectives the following programming models are 
required: 
 
1. Client-server model: there should be server code running on each cell 
equipment, namely on the robot controllers and coordinating PLCs, that 
could receive calls from the remote client computers, execute the 
commands and return the results; 
2. Remote Procedure Calls: this is the most usual method used to implement 
communications between a client and a server on a distributed 
environment. The client makes a call to a non-local function and the 
selected RPC mechanism configures the call so that the proper computer, 
server program and function are addressed, adding the necessary network 
headers. The server program, running on the server machine, receives the 
call, executes the selected function and returns the results obtained  to the 
client computer. 

118 Welding Robots 
 
3. Data sharing: most of the services require data sharing, files and databases 
between the client and the server. Consequently, the mechanism provided 
by the RPC technology to implement data sharing must be used. 
 
Another important thing to consider is the need to interface intelligent sensors with 
the system. The most easy and portable way to do that is to build software 
components that implement the methods, properties and data structures necessary 
to configure and use the sensor. Consequently, a technology to implement software 
components is also needed. The basic architecture presented in Figure 4.9 details 
all these requirements.  
 
4.5 Application to Robot Manipulators 
Actual industrial robot manipulators are controlled by advanced multiprocessor 
computer systems, based on standard parallel buses (VME, for example) or a serial 
internal communication mechanism (CAN, DeviceNet, etc.). Generally these robot 
control systems use a real-time operating system for low level interfaces, like 
RTOS or WxWorks, and a more friendly operating system with the sub-systems 
used for user interface (Win32 based OS, etc.). Robot controllers also provide local 
programming environments based on structured Pascal-like languages, along with 
a set of libraries that enable the user to build custom applications, interface with 
other machines and with operators, etc., exploring fully the robot and controller 
facilities. 
 
Any software architecture designed to operate with this type of machine should 
comply with current standards in terms of communication protocols, remote 
interfaces and software components. The reason is to avoid incompatibilities and 
excessive dependency with specific technologies that limit the users or force them 
into certain directions not representative. 
 
The software presented in this book was designed to be used with robot 
manipulators (Figure 4.9) in distributed applications, and is divided into three main 
parts: 
1. A set of functions that implement the robot-PC communication operations, 
including the access to the RPC services available in the robot controller. 
Those services include: variable access services, file management services, 
program management services, IO control, robot controller state services, 
etc. 
2. A set of functions based on TCP/IP sockets that implement the same robot 
controller access described above. These functions were designed to 
operate with a TCP/IP server running as a task on the robot controller. 
3. An OPC (OLE for Process Control) client component that implements calls 
to any OPC DA (Data Access) server [31]. The particular implementation 
used in this book works with ABB IRC5 OPC DA servers [31] to 
demonstrate the principle.

Using any of the presented software interfaces it’s possible to design a software 
strategy/architecture to implement robot controller access for data exchange, 
program control and robot controller status supervision. To particularize and 
demonstrate a few implementation specific details, two different technologies will 
be explored in the following sections: remote procedure calls (based on the SUN 
RPC 4.0 implementation [32]) and TCP/IP sockets (based on the Microsoft 
Winsock implementation [33]-[35]). The concepts will be kept as general as 
possible, using a specific robot controller when needed for clarity.  
 
4.5.1 Using RPC – Remote Procedure Calls 
Client-server software architecture was adopted [32],[33]. The robot controller 
software works as a server, exposing to the client a collection of RPC services that 
constitute its basic functionality (Figure 4.9). Those services, offered by the RPC 
servers running on the robot controller, include as already mentioned variable 
access services, files and programs management services, and robot status and 
controller state management and information services. To access those services the 
remote computer (client) issues properly parameterized remote procedures calls to 
the robot controller (server) through the network (Figure 4.9). Considering for 
example the S4CPLUS robot controller from ABB Robotics, it’s possible to extend 
the RPC services available in the robot controller adding user functionality to the 
system. The ABB implementation is based on a messaging protocol developed by 
ABB called RAP (Remote Application Protocol) [38], which is an Application 
Specific Protocol (ASP) of the OSI application level. The messaging protocol RAP 
defines the necessary data structures and message syntax of the RPC calls used to 
explore the RPC services available in the controller. These services were 
implemented using the standard and open source RPC specification SUN RPC 4.0, 
a collection of tools developed by the SUN Microsystems Open Network Group 
(ONC) [32]. Consequently, to implement the client calls, the ONC SUN RPC 4.0 
specification and tools were also used. This package includes a compiler (rpcgen), 
a portmaper and a few useful tools like rpcinfo [32]. The Microsoft RPC 
implementation uses another standard defined by Digital Corporation named 
OSF/DCE [37], which is not compatible with the SUN RPC standard. The package 
used to build the client software was a port to Windows NT/2000/XP [39], 
equivalent to the original version that was built to UNIX systems, although a few 
functions were slightly changed to suit better the needs without compromising 
compatibility with client and server programs developed with the SUN RPC 
package. The port was compiled using the Microsoft Visual C++ .NET 2003 
compiler [42]. 
 
From all the RPC services available in the robot controller, the ones really needed 
to implement the software architecture depicted in Figure 4.9 are the variable 
access services. Nevertheless, calls to the other services were implemented for 
completeness. The procedure is simple and based on the XDR (Extended Data 
Representation) file obtained by defining the data structures, the service 
identification numbers and the service syntax specified by the RAP protocol. That 

 
Robotic Welding: System Issues 121 
 
file is compiled by the rpcgen tool, generating the basic calls and data structure 
prototypes necessary to invoke the RPC services available from the robot 
controller. The necessary code was added to each basic function and packed into an 
ActiveX software component named PCROBNET2003 [39]-[41]. The complete set 
of functions included in this object is listed in Table 4.1. 
 
It should be noted that, although this software component was built using the 
DCOM/OLE/ActiveX object model, it does not run the Microsoft RPC 
implementation but instead the already mentioned SUN RPC 4.0 port to the Win32 
API.

To use a remote service the computer running the client application needs to make 
properly parameterized calls to the server computer, and receive the execution 
result. Two types of services may be considered: synchronous and asynchronous. 
The synchronous services return the execution result as the answer to the call.  
 
 

122 Welding Robots 
 
Consequently, the general prototype of this type of calls is 
 
short status call_service_i (struct parameters_i, struct answer_i) 
 
where status returns the service error codes (zero if the service returns without 
errors, and a negative number identifying the error otherwise), parameters_i is the 
data structure containing the service parameters and answer_i is the data structure 
that returns the service execution results. 
 
The asynchronous services, when activated, return answers/results asynchronously, 
i.e., the remote system should also make remote procedure calls to the client 
system when the requested information becomes available or when the specified 
event occurs (system and controller state changes, robot program execution state 
change, IO and variable events, etc.). Those calls may be named events or 
spontaneous messages, and are remote procedure calls issued to all client 
computers that made the correspondent subscription, i.e., made a call to the 
subscription service properly parameterized specifying the information wanted. To 
receive those calls any remote client must run RPC servers that implement a 
service to receive them (Figure 4.10). The option adopted was to have that server 
broadcasting registered messages inside the operating system, enabling all open 
applications to receive and process that information by filtering its message queue. 
 
Figure 4.10. Functionality of the RPC server necessary to receive spontaneous messages 
 
As mentioned already, the variable access services allow access to all types of 
variables defined in the robot controller. Using this service, and developing the 
robot controller software in a convenient way, it is possible to add new services to 
the system. In fact that possibility may be achieved by using a simple SWITCH-
CASE-DO cycle driven by a variable controlled from the calling (client) remote 
computer:  
 
RPC Server 
RPC Call 
Asynchronous answer 
Message to the screen 
LOG* file 
Win32 registered message 
(broadcast) 
* The writing operation is done only on idle 
periods. 

 
Robotic Welding: System Issues 123 
 
switch (decision_1) 
{ 
case 0: call service_0; break; 
case 1: call service_1; break; 
case 2: call service_2; break; 
… 
case n: call service_n; break; 
} 
 
This server runs on the robot controller, making the process of adding a new 
service a very simple task. The programmer should build the procedure (routine) 
that implements the new functionality, and include the call to that procedure in the 
server cycle by identifying it with specific number of the control variable. 
 
In fact this is not far from what is done with any RPC server; the svc_run function, 
used in those programs is a SWITCH-CASE-DO cycle that implements calls to the 
functions requested by the remote client. With this type of structure it is 
straightforward to build complex and customer functions that can be offered to the 
remote client. Furthermore, with this approach it’s still possible to use the 
advanced capabilities offered by the robot controller, namely the advanced 
functions designed to control and setup the robot motion and operation. 
 
Examples exploring this facility are presented and discussed in Chapter 5. 
 
4.5.2 Using TCP/IP Sockets 
One of the most interesting ways to establish a network connection between 
computer systems is by using TCP/IP sockets. This is a standard client-server 
procedure, not dependent on the operating system technology used on any of the 
computer systems, which only requires the definition of a proper messaging syntax 
to be reliable and safe. The user defined messaging protocol should specify the 
commands and data structures adapted to the practical situation under study.  
 
To exemplify this procedure, this section presents a complete example applied to 
robotic welding. The setup (Figure 4.11) is composed by an anthropomorphic robot 
manipulator (ABB IRB1400 – M2005), the robot controller (ABB IRC5, running 
version 5.06 of the controller operating system) and a MIG/MAG welding power 
source (ESAB LUA 315R). 
 
To command and monitor the welding application from the remote computer the 
following services (implemented by the TCP/IP socket server) must be available at 
the robot controller: 
 
1. Robot and robot program control and supervision services: the remote 
user must be able to change the robot operational state, start/stop selected 
robot programs (tasks), and read robot controller and robot programs 

124 Welding Robots 
 
actual states. Since actual robot control systems are multitasking systems, 
users must consider robot programs as tasks and deal with them as such. 
2. IO read/write services: the remote client needs to monitor and change 
the actual state of selected IO signals, in a way to safely control the 
welding application: for example, signals controlling the GAS valve, the 
WIRE speed, the welding CURRENT, etc., are IO signals generated by 
the robot controller. Consequently, the possibility to read/write to any 
digital and analog signal is needed. 
3. Variable read/write services: if the remote client is necessary to 
parameterize the welding operation, including the welding trajectory 
(obtained for example from a CAD software package), to control the 
welding tasks using commanding variables (see the previous section), to 
monitor the welding operation, etc., then variable read/write services are 
needed. 
 
Building a TCP/IP server to implement these types of services is very simple. In 
the following and with the objective of demonstrating how it could be done, a 
simple TCP/IP server that explores the facilities available in the new ABB IRC5 
robot controller will be designed and built. The choice for this robot controller is 
based on the fact that it allows users to explore and program TCP/IP socket 
connections since those are fully supported by the programming environment [43].  
 
The server presented below was written in RAPID (ABB robot programming 
language [43]), and the client example was coded using the Visual Basic compiler 
of the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 developing suite [42]. In the following 
the software will be designed and built step-by-step. 
 
First step - define the messaging syntax to use: to develop the TCP/IP server to 
run on the robot controller, a proper messaging syntax should be clearly defined. 
For this simple example the following message structure will be used: 
 
Command structure:  
 
command parameter_1 parameter_2 … parameter_n 
 
Answer structure: 
 
error_code answer_1 answer_2 … answer_n 
 
where “command” is a string that identifies the specific command, “parameter_1” 
to “parameter_n” are optional parameters associated with the specific command, 
“error_code” is a numeric value that specifies if the command was executed 
correctly (zero returned) or with errors (negative value identifying the returned 
error), and “answer_1” to “answer_n” are the results of the execution of the 
command. The commands considered are summarized in Table 4.2.

ABB IRC5 robot controller. This fact does not constitute a limitation, since the 
facilities used here are also available in any multitasking operating system capable 
of managing and using TCP/IP socket connections. The server code is presented 
and commented in Figure 4.12.

This server was placed on the controller running as an extra-task, i.e., the robot has 
a main task, where the foreground applications are running, and a second task used 
to communicate with the external computer: to receive commands and exchange 
information. 
 
Third step – write the client program: any TCP/IP socket server should be 
capable of receiving and accepting connections from client applications, receive 
and process commands, and deliver the obtained results. The following example 
(Figure 4.13) is a simple TCP/IP socket client program coded using the Microsoft 
Visual Basic .NET 2003 developing suite.

The client program implements calls to the TCP/IP server program defined above, 
using the Microsoft Winsock2 implementation, and was written to be a very simple 
example. A few software buttons were added to the client program to perform 
certain operations, but with this program the user can also write the full instruction 
in the command window, send it to the robot and receive the answer in the output 
window. To demonstrate the effort involved in sending commands and receiving 
answers, the following (Figure 4.14) shows the code associated with some of the 
software buttons. 
 
 
Figure 4.15. Simple welding application used for demonstration 
 
 
4.6 Simple Welding Example 
Let’s consider a simple welding application (Figure 4.15), where the robotic 
welding system (Figure 4.11) is commanded to execute a linear welding trajectory 
between two positions: P1 and P2. The user should be able to acquire and adjust the 

132 Welding Robots 
 
two mentioned positions, but also to change the welding parameters: voltage, 
current and welding speed. From the two technologies presented above to 
implement robot controller access, the example presented in this section will use 
the TCP/IP socket technology since the RPC technology is alternatively used in 
Chapter 5. The simple TCP/IP socket server presented in Figure 4.12 was designed 
to operate in a multitasking environment (Figure 4.16), where the server runs in 
one task (task 2) and the operational routines related with the specific welding 
application run in another task (task 1). That’s the case of the robot controller used 
with this example, (ABB IRC5) which is running the ABB RobotWare operating 
system (version 5.06) [43] with the option multitasking activated.

using shared memory space; b - aspect of the RobotStudio [43] RAPID tasks view, on the 
PC side, showing the running tasks 
 
Consequently, the goal here is to design the welding application task in such a way 
as to offer the specific functionalities needed to be able to run the planned welding 
operations. Considering that those functionalities are to be requested remotely, it 
seems logical to implement a basic SWITCH-CASE-DO loop driven by a variable 
controlled from the remote computer (see Section 4.5.1). It should be noted that the 

 
Robotic Welding: System Issues 133 
 
remote client can change the value of any program variable just by using the 
“write_variable” service implemented in the TCP/IP socket server (Figure 4.12).  
 
Therefore the following services should be implemented in task 1: 
 
1. Move the robot in Cartesian space: since the piece to weld is placed on a 
welding table (Figure 4.15), it’s enough to allow the user to move the robot relative 
to a fixed position (Pcorner) on the table. To move the robot parallel to the surface, 
avoiding collisions, the user must be able to send jogging commands to the robot in 
the form of Cartesian offsets and rotation offsets about the axis of the defined robot 
TOOL (Figure 4.15). To add the jogging capability the position Pcorner should be 
acquired to the system aligning the TOOL reference frame with the defined 
position frame. The position obtained from Pcorner adding 200mm in the Z direction 
(WORLD reference frame) can be called “home” or “safe position”, 
 
Phome = Offsets(Pcorner , 0, 0, 200); 
 
where the function Offsets [43] adds 200mm to the Z Cartesian direction, 
recalculating the orientation parameters to keep the orientation in the new 
Cartesian position.  
 
Therefore, to jog safely the robot in the welding working space, the following two 
services must be available from the welding application: 
 
Service “Go Home” 
CASE 1000: 
   MOVEJ Offsets(Pcorner , 0, 0, 200), v100, fine, tool_torch; 
decision1:=0; 
 
Service “Move_Cartesian_Linear” 
CASE 1001: 
WHILE decision1 = 1001 DO 
 IF move <> 0 THEN 
   MOVEJ RelTool(Pcorner , x, y, z\RX:=rx, RY:=ry, RZ:=rz), v100, fine, tool_torch; 
 ENDIF 
ENDWHILE 
decision1:=0; 
 
An extra service capable of moving the robot in coordinated joint motion could be 
interesting to solve motion difficulties related with singular zones. The service 
could be obtained just by adapting the previous “Move_Cartesian_Linear” service 
to: 
 
Service “Move_Cartesian_Linear_Joint” 
CASE 1001: 
Pactual:= CRobT(\Tool:=tool_torch); 
WHILE decision1 = 1001 DO 

134 Welding Robots 
 
IF move <> 0 THEN 
 IF move_type = 1 THEN 
   MOVEL RelTool(Pactual ,x, y, z\RX:=rx, RY:=ry, RZ:=rz), v100, fine, tool_torch; 
 ELSE 
   MOVEJ RelTool(Pactual , x, y, z\RX:=rx, RY:=ry, RZ:=rz), v100, fine, tool_torch; 
 ENDIF 
ENDIF 
ENDWHILE 
decision1:=0; 
 
2. Acquire positions P1 and P2: this is a very simple task done by the following 
services: 
 
Acquire position P1 
CASE 1002: 
P1:=CRobT(\Tool:=tool_torch); 
decision1:=0; 
 
Acquire position P2 
CASE 1003: 
P2:=CRobT(\Tool:=tool_torch); 
decision1:=0; 
 
3. Start and stop weld: these are services used to initiate the arc doing the weld, 
and to stop the arc: 
 
CASE 1004: 
weld_on; 
decision1:=0; 
 
CASE 1005: 
weld_off; 
decision1:=0; 
 
The procedures weld_on and weld_off are presented in (Figure 4.17), along with 
sub-procedures used by them. The weld_on procedure implements the timing 
defined by the welding power source, represented in Figure 5.2. 
 
4. Approach position P1: this service is used to move the robot safely to P1: 
 
CASE 1006: 
MOVEJ Offset(P1, 0, 0, 200), v200, z50, tool_torch; 
MOVEJ Offset P1, v100, z50, tool_torch; 
decision1:=0;

welding operation, along with the acquisition of the two welding points P1 and P2, 
the robot jogging operation, etc., from a remote computer. A special tool may be 
built for the case, but the code already used for the simple TCP/IP socket client

It’s straightforward to associate these procedures to software buttons and build a 
nice client software tool to command easily the presented welding example (hiding 
the code from the user). This process can be done using Visual Basic or Visual 
C++, or any other programming language, providing that the Microsoft Winsock2 
software API, or any other equivalent API, is included in a way to add socket 
management and communication capabilities to the project. 

 
Robotic Welding: System Issues 139 
 
4.7 Semi-autonomous Manufacturing Systems 
Actual manufacturing systems need to have high degrees of autonomy requiring 
less operator intervention to improve agility and efficiency. In fact, if the 
manufacturing systems are designed to operate remotely using simple commands 
and parameterization, then the tasks necessary to adjust the setup to manufacture a 
different product model may be fully automatic. This procedure should lead to big 
improvements in terms of productivity, along with considerable gains in terms of 
agility and flexibility. In the particular case of robotic welding, the following are 
examples of things that can be done without operator intervention: 
 
1. Change the welding parameters: current, voltage and speed. 
2. Change the way the welding power source is controlled (Figure 5.2). 
3. Change the welding sequence just by adjusting the welding points, the 
trajectories between them and the definition on what are the welding and 
the approach/escape trajectories. 
 
This can easily be implemented by properly designing the services offered by the 
robot controller application software, having them working based on the remote 
parameterization. Furthermore, to include the robotic welding cell in a 
manufacturing line, an “automatic mode” service must be designed with the 
objective of having the system responding to sensor signals and to PLC 
commanding signals. In fact, depending on the application, a few sensors are 
needed to inform about the necessary conditions to execute the task, which 
includes information like: “work-piece in place”, “power source on-line”, “welding 
gun clean”, “cell not violated”, etc. It is also very important to interface with the 
PLC managing the manufacturing line, because the coordinating signals that make 
the manufacturing sequence occur are generated by the software running on the 
PLC (usually specified using GRAFCET).  
 
To demonstrate how this can be done, let’s consider the simple welding process 
presented in Section 4.6. The services discussed there are to be used in “local or 
manual mode” to adjust points, simulate the procedure, etc. They shouldn’t be used 
in “automatic mode”, where the robot needs to react to sensor information and to 
coordinating signals coming from the PLC managing the manufacturing line. 
Figure 4.18 represents a possible manufacturing line where the simple welding 
example was inserted. The system is composed by a conveyor belt that carries the 
pieces to weld, a centering and holding pneumatic device that holds the pieces 
during the welding procedure and a collection of position sensors, responsible for 
detecting the piece to stop the conveyor and to verify if the work-piece is in 
position after being trapped by the pneumatic cylinder. Only after the previous 
tasks are completed is the robot commanded to perform the welding operation. 
When the operation is done, the robot should signal the controlling PLC to free the 
welded piece, re-start the conveyor motion and wait for another one to weld.  
 
 
 

140 Welding Robots 
 
Consequently, the “automatic mode” cycle should look like the following: 
 
CASE 9000: 
   WHILE decision1 = 9000 DO 
      WaitUntil di_piece_in_place = 1; 
      SetDO piece_weld_done, 0; 
 
      ! Approach P1 
      MOVEJ Offset(P1, 0, 0, 200), v200, z50, tool_torch; 
      MOVEJ Offset P1, v100, z50, tool_torch; 
 
      ! Weld from P1 to P2 
      weld_on 
      MOVEL P2, velocity, fine, tool_torch; 
      weld_off; 
 
      ! Move to SAFE position 
      MOVEJ Offset(P2, 0, 0, 200), v100, z50, tool_torch; 
      MOVEJ Offset(Pcorner, 0, 0, 200), v200, z50, tool_torch; 
 
      ! Signal handshake: end of cycle 
      SetDO piece_weld_done, 1; 
      WaitUntil di_piece_in_place = 0; 
   ENDWHILE: 
   decision1:=0;

Robotic Welding: System Issues 141 
 
To operate the system, using the same TCP/IP sockets strategy, the calling 
computer should send the welding parameterization, using the available services, 
and command “automatic mode” to start production. This can be done from any 
computer on the network, namely from computers running the software used to 
track and control the production. In many industries, production is closed tracked 
in any part of the manufacturing cycle, which is composed by several in-line 
manufacturing systems that perform the necessary operations transforming the raw 
materials in a final product. In many cases, if properly designed, those individual 
manufacturing systems require simple parameterization (like the robot welding 
tasks) to execute the tasks they are designed to execute. If that parameterization 
can be commanded remotely by automatic means from where it is available, then 
the system becomes almost autonomous in the sense that operator intervention is 
reduced to the minimum and essentially related with error and maintenance 
situations. A system like this will improve efficiency and agility, since it is less 
dependent on human operators. Also, since those systems are built under 
distributed frameworks, based on client-server software architectures which require 
a collection of functions that implement the system functionality, it is easier to 
change production by adjusting parameterization (a software task now) which also 
contributes to agility. In adition, since all information about each item produced is 
available in the manufacturing tracking software, it is logical to use it to command 
some of the shop-floor manufacturing systems, namely the ones that require simple 
parameterization to work properly. This procedure would take advantage of the 
available information and computing infrastructure, avoiding unnecessary operator 
interfaces to command the system. Also, further potential gains in terms of 
flexibility and productivity are evident. 
 
Furthermore, to adjust the welding parameters and start production in the simple 
welding example presented, the collection of commands would be: 
 
Set the welding current 
Connect 
Send message: variable_write feed_ref num value 
Close 
 
Set the welding voltage 
Connect 
Send message: variable_write wd_ref num value 
Close 
 
Set the welding velocity 
Connect 
Send message: variable_write velocity num value 
Close 
 
Note: these three commands are used to define the welding parameters. They can 
be done once, and/or adjusted during production, or done asynchronously in any 
combination, without being followed by the “automatic mode” command. This 

142 Welding Robots 
 
command requires a previous definition of the welding parameters, because it 
executes welding trajectories, but since the values of those parameters are kept, 
there’s no need to send them again between two consecutive production cycles if 
they aren’t to be changed. 
 
Command “automatic mode” 
Connect 
Send message: variable_write decision1 num 9000 
Close 
 
Finally, it should be emphasized that the welding parameters can be adjusted 
without restrictions at any time during “automatic mode” (a service implemented 
in task 1), since those are calls to the TCP/IP services running in a different task 
(task 2). 
 
4.8 Chapter Final Notes 
In this chapter several system issues related to robotic welding were discussed with 
the triple objective to: 
 
1. Clarify: robotic welding is very demanding on system resources and 
capabilities mainly because automatic welding is a task that requires an 
adapting behavior of the automatic system [19],[23]. This has an 
enormous impact on the requirements for the system planned to make the 
welding task automatic. First because the system needs to handle the 
welding process models (databases and/or knowledge base [45]) to enable 
automatic selection of the welding parameters and their dynamic behavior 
based on the observed welding conditions. Second because the automatic 
system needs to accommodate the advanced sensors used to obtain that 
information, but also to perform seam tracking, inspection and quality 
analysis. The required sub-systems and software modules necessary to 
incorporate information from sensors must be flexible enough to allow 
multiple sensors to be integrated easily and be fully explored. 
2. Contribute: to cope with the robotic welding requirements there are 
several features from the robot controllers that can be used, along with 
available software architectures, software component technologies, 
communication data and signal protocols, sensors and interfaces, etc. The 
choice is up to the system engineers to select from the available 
possibilities, although a few standard approaches are obvious candidates 
as this chapter clearly pointed out. Any adopted solution should use a 
software framework capable of handling local and remote services with 
the objective of incorporating the necessary functionalities using currently 
available industrial standards. 
3. Demonstrate: in this chapter a software architecture was defined (Figure 
4.9) and several examples on using it were given with the objective of 

 
Robotic Welding: System Issues 143 
 
clarifying the issues described, but also to show how they could be 
implemented using actual equipment and software tools. 
 
This chapter also discusses the construction of manufacturing systems that 
incorporate high degrees of autonomy with the objective of improving productivity 
and efficiency of the manufacturing processes. That means distributing functions to 
all the components of the system on a client-server framework. Furthermore, the 
software must be designed as general as possible to offer the system functionality 
to the remote clients in the form of customable services. Furthermore, for the 
remote client any of the system features can be parameterized and in this way 
tailored to the user needs, which means adjusted to execute the production and 
operational changes required for the actual installation. This means network 
interfaces, based on the TCP/IP protocol, and remote procedure calls, enabling 
direct command of shop-floor manufacturing setups from anywhere in the factory. 
 
The following chapter presents and discusses a complete robotic welding system. 
The chapter is very technical and goes deeply into implementation details with the 
objective of being informative and demonstrative. The chapter also demonstrates 
some of the features discussed in this book using a particular robot/controller and 
the software architecture presented in this chapter.

Robotic Welding: Application Examples 
5.1 Introduction 
When robots are used on the shop floor to perform welding tasks, users expect 
massive improvements in terms of flexibility, productivity and quality. But that 
outcome is not an easy task, since a considerable amount of additional setup and 
programming work is necessary to guarantee that robots perform as expected with 
the required quality. This process is time consuming and requires skilled personnel, 
which means that robots take longer to be programmed and set up than really doing 
some interesting work, introducing an overhead cost on time and personnel that 
must be considered. And that is a major problem, since actual concepts like 
availability and agility [1],[2] are key issues of modern manufacturing. In fact, 
those concepts are fundamental to have robot automation take a more important 
part on the shop-floor, cooperating with humans, which is decisive to help modern 
country companies fight the low salary trap. Machines that store high levels of 
flexibility, like robot manipulators, but fail in terms of agility because automation 
integrators and machine builders were unable, when designing a specific machine, 
to expose that flexibility to the users may become less interesting. Also, for SMEs 
robot automation becomes uninteresting since all these companies work with small 
series, under contract by customers, which means several models of products. 
Knowing that the big majority of the production workforce is represented by 
SMEs, this scenario constitutes a big problem. Consequently, solving these issues, 
reducing setup and programming times, is one of the major problems that robot 
manufacturers must address clearly in the near future. 
 
The welding quality is closely related to the weld bead shape which is regulated by 
the selected welding parameters (see Chapter 2). Consequently, several databases 
have been developed, such as those from the Welding Institute – UK [3], to help in 
selecting the parameters more suitable for the particular situation under 
consideration. In these databases the input data is generally the type of weld (butt 
weld or fillet weld), the welding position (flat, horizontal, vertical or overhead), 

148 Welding Robots 
 
wire diameter and the plate thickness or eventually the leg length in the case of 
fillet welds. The output data is usually the welding parameters: current, voltage, 
welding speed and number of weld beads/layers. With databases of this type in the 
computer the selection of the welding parameters may be done automatically. Even 
the selection of the wire diameter may be carried out automatically as a function of 
the thickness of the components or stay for free selection being an input parameter. 
It would be expectable that, with this information in the computer having a CAD 
model of the component to be welded, the system could be able to select the 
welding data for each weld and send it to the robotic welding system. Although it 
seems easy to achieve this goal in the case of single welds, some data is missing in 
the available databases for the case of welds with multiple layers. In fact, in this 
case the position of the torch for each layer needs to be indicated to the robot. 
 
Since that for the majority of the companies that produce multi-layer welds there is 
only a small number of distinct welds, then it is not hard to fill up the database for 
their particular case. Consequently, using this method it is easy to carry out the off-
line programming of the components to be welded, being only necessary to adjust 
the coordinates of the process points in the first specimen to be welded. 
 
Furthermore, when robots are used to weld, the programming problem arises 
immediately. In this chapter a robotic welding example having CAD programming 
capabilities will be introduced, giving special attention to the implementation 
details. The subject will be addressed by extending the concepts presented in 
Section 4.5 along with a simple CAD interface that enable simpler and faster 
programming. A few test cases will be presented, explained and discussed with the 
objective of demonstrating that the basic features are available and can be used to 
build powerful robotic welding solutions. 
 
5.2 A Robotic Welding System 
Robots manipulators are essentially position-controlled devices that can receive a 
trajectory and run it continuously. With welding applications it is necessary to start 
from a trajectory, given for example from a CAD model of the work-piece, and to 
have the means to correct it in real time, as function of the observed results of the 
welding process. 
 
5.2.1 Overview of the System 
To achieve the above-mentioned goal, systems for guidance and inspection are 
needed (see Chapter 3), but also the possibility to correct in real time the position 
of the robot and the welding parameters, and a computational platform suitable for 
developing the software necessary to handle the monitoring and control tasks. 
Unfortunately these features aren’t usually available for the following reasons: 
 

 
Robotic Welding: Application Examples 149 
 
1. Actual robot manipulators have closed controllers, not allowing real time 
position correction by costumer programming. 
2. Most of the actual robot controllers do not allow remote control from an 
external computer. 
3. It is very difficult to attach guidance sensors with good performance, 
because most of the robot controllers are not prepared to do it, or restrict 
that possibility, not providing fast interfaces freely accessible by advanced 
users. 
4. Robot programming environments are not powerful enough to handle 
tasks that require complex control techniques (learning, supervisory, 
adaptive, etc). 
 
With the system introduced here several of these limitations are reduced as 
follows: 
 
1. A robot control system that allows position correction commanded by a 
remote computer is used. That’s not a standard feature, but was added to 
the system by using other features available from the controller. 
2. A distributed and client-server based software architecture, that enables 
remote control using Ethernet networks was developed. 
3. The necessary sensors may be attached to the computer that controls the 
robot and not to the robot controller itself. This excludes the seam 
tracking sensor which requires a low-level interface with the robot 
controller. 
4. A personal computer is used as programming environment, taking 
advantage of the huge amount of programming and analysis tools 
available for those platforms. 
 
The basic setup is composed of an industrial robot (model ABB IRB1400 M98), a 
robot controller (model ABB S4C+ M98), a MIG/MAG welding power source 
(ESAB LUA 315R) and a computer running Windows XP (any other DCOM [4] 
based version of the Microsoft Windows operating system could have been used). 
The welding power source is connected to the robot controller IO subsystem, being 
in this way completely controlled by the robot controller. The robot controller is 
equipped with an Ethernet board being accessible from the local area network 
(Figure 5.1) by any computer also connected to the network.  
 
Achieving automatic parameter selection also means using sensing devices not 
only for guiding the welding torch (joint tracking), but also for real-time 
acquisition of the welding geometry. Simple torch guidance and joint tracking can 
be obtained using mechanical, electrical or optical sensors: current sensors (to 
sense the arc current during torch weaving), laser beams, etc., (see Chapter 3). 
Monitoring the welding geometry requires more sophisticated sensors, like the 
laser 3D cameras available for example from Meta Systems – UK and Servo-Robot 
– Canada (see Chapters 3 and 4). By joint geometry we mean information about 
the gap, cross section area, mismatch and type of joint (fillet, corner, lap, V-
groove, butt, etc.). With that information, and with the appropriate software and 

150 Welding Robots 
 
welding models it is possible to perform several adaptations in real time that go 
beyond the simple joint finding and tracking tasks (here considered as background 
tasks): weaving width, welding speed, wire feed speed, arc voltage, arc current, 
etc., are some examples of welding parameters that should be adapted if a better 
quality weld is required (see Chapter 4).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5.1. Robotic welding system 
 
The software architecture used in this chapter (see Section 4.5) is distributed based 
on a client-server model that uses software components developed specifically to 
handle the equipment functionality. Briefly, when we want to use some kind of 
equipment from a computer we need to write code and define data structures to 
explore its functionality. We can then pack the software into libraries, which are 
not very easy to distribute being language dependant, or build a software control 
using one of the several standard software component technologies available: 
preferably ActiveX [5] or JAVA [6]. But other technologies could be used; the 

 
Robotic Welding: Application Examples 151 
 
purpose here is on components and on integration with the environment chosen for 
operation, not in discussing the possibilities of each technology. Since we use 
Microsoft Windows operating systems, mainly Windows NT/XP and 2000, which 
are accepted standards in industry, ActiveX is somehow privileged because it was 
specially built for those environments and is based on DCOM like the operating 
system.

Figure 5.2. Welding sequence implemented by the robot controller (all the timings are 
programmable by the user) 
 
Using a software control means implementing methods and data structures that 
hide from the user all the tricky parts about how to have things done with some 
equipment, focusing only on using its functions in an easy way. Furthermore, those 
components are easily integrated into new projects built with programming tools 
that can act as containers of that type of software controls, i.e., they can be added 
to new projects in a visual way. We built several ActiveX software components to 
use with this project. Those controls reveal to the programmer the basic 

152 Welding Robots 
 
functionalities of the equipment used: one ABB IRB1400 S4CPlus industrial robot, 
a SIEMENS VS710 CCD camera and a ServoRobot M-Spot Laser 3D camera. The 
welding power source (MIG/MAG power source ESAB A350) is controlled from 
the robot controller using the welding sequence presented in Figure 5.2, and a 
client-server programming strategy (see Section 4.5.1). 
 
The robot controller software works as a server (Figure 5.3), exposing to the client 
a collection of services that constitute its basic functionality (see Section 4.5). The 
robot can start the welding procedure, or terminate it, can be commanded to follow 
complex trajectories, to simulate the entire process completely or step-by-step, etc., 
just by answering to remote commands issued from a computer connected to the 
robot by Ethernet. Basically, the user sends to the robot a complete definition of 
the welding task including: points, welding parameters (velocity, voltage and 
current), type of trajectory between and positioning precision, etc. All this 
information is stored in the robot controller and can be used to simulate the 
welding process and enable any adjustment necessary, or to start/stop the welding 
process.

5.2.2 CAD Interface 
Since the vast majority of companies use CAD software packages to design their 
products, it would be very interesting if the information from CAD files could be 
used to generate robot welding programs. That is, the CAD application could be 

 
Robotic Welding: Application Examples 153 
 
the environment used for specifying the way the welding robots should execute the 
welding operation on the specified parts.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5.4. Example of welding trajectories using available layers (using AUTOCAD 2004) 
 
Furthermore, since most welding engineers are familiar with CAD packages, this 
could be a nice way to proceed. The application presented here enables the user to 
work on the CAD file, defining both the welding path and the approach/escape 
paths between two consecutive welds, and organize them into the desired welding 
sequence. When the definition is complete, a small program, written in Visual 
Basic, extracts motion information from the CAD file and converts it to robot 
commands that can be immediately tested for detailed tuning. A set of tools is then 
available to speed up the necessary corrections, which can be made on-line with 
Work-object 

154 Welding Robots 
 
the robot moving. After a few simulations (with the robot performing all the 
programmed motions without welding) the program is ready for production. The 
whole process can be completed in just some minutes to a few hours, depending on 
the size and complexity of the component to be welded, representing a huge 
reduction of programming and setup time. Besides, most of the work is really easy 
off-line programming. 
 
Consequently, having the software tools available and meeting a specific request 
from industry, a solution was designed using AUTOCAD [7] and DXF files 
(currently standard files for all CAD software tools). If the user follows some basic 
rules, and produces a DXF file with all the information needed, then the 
application developed is capable of extracting that information from the CAD file, 
and is able to produce a robot program almost ready for production. 
 
 
 
Figure 5.5. Application to extract information from a DXF CAD file 
 
The user starts by having a 3D drawing of the piece to weld and of the table used to 
hold the piece. The 3D models should be very precise in terms of dimensions and 
in terms of positioning the welding parts. Then the user should draw and select 
(Figure 5.4) the sequences and all the trajectories required to weld fully the piece 
as desired, using the available layers, i.e., using one layer for each trajectory, 
which is composed by a start-point and an end-point, both with orientation, and the 
type of motion (welding trajectory or approach/escape trajectory). The welding 
parameters (current, voltage, speed, etc.) are introduced in the selected layer, just 
by adding labels with the corresponding values. The weld layers should then be 
renamed for easy identification using a string that starts with the word “WELD”.

The next information is the type of trajectory, to distinguish between welding 
trajectories and approach/escape trajectories. After that should be specified the 
welding current, and then the welding voltage. Finally, the welding speed is 
specified. All these parameters are separated by spaces, constituting a definition 
string. Consequently, a label on a welding trajectory is a string that looks like this 
one: 
 
WELD 0 150.0 20.0 10 0  
 
which defines a welding trajectory (0 – welding, 1 – approach/escape, Figure 5.6), 
with a welding current of 150 A, a welding voltage of 20 V, a welding speed of 10 
mm/s and maximum precision in achieving the end-point. 
 
 
 
Figure 5.7. Shell of the WeldPanel tool 
 
The DXF file generated by the CAD application (AUTOCAD in our case) includes 
all the information added to specify the welding process. Since the DXF file is an 

 
Robotic Welding: Application Examples 157 
 
ASCII file, it is very easy to extract the above-mentioned information, using a 
simple application (Figure 5.5) that identifies each added welding layer, the 
trajectories and the related welding parameters, and stores that information in a 
known way. The definition used here is represented in Figure 5.6.  
 
The generated “.wdf” file is used as input for the application represented in Figure 
5.7. This application shows the available definition with the help of several push-
down software buttons, and enables the user to change welding parameters, correct 
points and orientations, simulate the whole process using the real robot and the real 
piece to weld. The simulation is very realistic, making the final program ready for 
production. A complete collection of tools was designed to help the user to adjust 
the points, add extra points, add approach and fly away trajectories, adjust welding 
parameters, test and simulate the whole process until the operation is as desired. 
The functions included in these application tools use exclusively the ActiveX 
control PCROBNET2003 [8], developed by the first author to interface with the 
RPC services available from the robot controller (see Section 4.5.1). 
 
5.2.3 WeldPanel 
With this tool (Figure 5.7) the user can manipulate the welding points that may be 
obtained initially from a CAD model of the work-piece. Those points may be 
changed or adjusted, and extra ones may be added as a way to avoid collisions, to 
optimize trajectories, etc., and to achieve best performance. All points are always 
referred to the welding torch Tool Center Point (TCP) and to a Work-Object frame 
defined in the table holding the working object (Figure 5.4). The user may adjust 
points just by moving the robot to the desired position, a task that can be done from 
the computer or passing control to the robot teach pendant, which is generally 
easier. 
 
 
 
Figure 5.8. Shell of the WeldAdjust tool 

158 Welding Robots 
 
This “WeldPanel” software tool also receives events from the robot, like status 
changes, actual state of the welding power source and related IO signals, etc. The 
status of the program running on the robot controller and of the network 
connection is constantly monitored, just to avoid damaging materials and persons, 
but also to prevent system commands on error situations. Those events are simply 
RPC calls made by the robot controller to an RPC server running on the computer 
as a system service (see Section 4.5).

Robotic Welding: Application Examples 159 
 
5.2.4 WeldAdjust 
The “WeldAdjust” software tool (Figure 5.8) is used to adjust points on-line and to 
acquire points in any given robot configuration and/or any robot program state. 
Basically it is a robot jogging application that enables the user to position the robot 
from the computer, using Cartesian XYZ commands or absolute joint commands. 
 
5.2.5 File Explorer 
With the “File Explorer” (Figure 5.9) software tool the user can exchange files 
with the robot controller, facilitating the process of transferring programs, 
modules, etc., to and from the robot controller. It works like the Microsoft 
Windows file explorer, having the available robots as extra “disks”. The user can 
access the robot internal disk and also the external floppy disk, which is 
implemented using the file access services available from the software component 
used. 
5.2.6 Robot Control Panel and RPC Server to Receive Events 
The “Control Panel” software tool is used to change the robot controller state and 
to load and unload modules from the robot controller. The RPC server is used to 
receive events from the robot controller. As already mentioned events are RPC 
calls made by the robot controller and fired when pre-programmed actions actually 
occur. Possible actions include IO change, system state change, program variable 
change, etc. All actions are programmable.

5.3 Test Cases 
Two test cases are presented in this section. The first concerns to the welding of 
thick plates of a structural steel, where several layers of weld metal need to be 
deposited in a V-preparation. This situation is very usual in shipyards and 
companies constructing boilers, pressure vessels or even nuclear components.

The second example approaches the difficulties associated with the welding of 
fillet welds in complex paths such as those found in the manufacture of metallic 
beams or trusses. 
 
5.3.1 Test Case 1 – Multi-layer Welding 
In this example it is shown how to perform a simple multi-layer weld using the 
definitions presented in Figure 5.11, and Table 5.1 and Table 5.2. The number of 
layers and the placement of each one of them are obtained empirically using charts 
from The Welding Institute [3] and our own experience. The process is performed 
step-by-step, and any adjustment is introduced in the welding sequence being 
programmed. Those adjustments can be position adjustments, welding parameter 
adjustments and introduction or removal of layers. Since the program is stored in a 
file, it can be used later to weld other similar pieces. The obtained procedure is 
easy to use and very useful for industrial exploitation because the programmer can 
easily setup a multi-layer welding procedure controlling and observing the effect of 
each layer, and acting when necessary. Figure 5.11 shows the working piece, 
composed by two 20mm thick plates, separated by 2mm, constituting a 60º V-
groove joint preparation, and the welding sequence (layers necessary to finish the 
weld). The position of the torch in each layer is indicated in Table 5.1. The origin 
of the reference axis system is centered in the bottom of the V-groove. This 
information is generally not available in the welding databases. The welding data 
used in this case is indicated in Table 5.2. 
 
5.3.2 Test Case 2 – Multiple Welding Paths 
In this example it’s shown how to perform a multipoint weld, very common in 
companies that manufacture metal structures for the construction industry. The 
idea is to extract points from the CAD model of the piece to be welded. It is 
usually very simple to build a routine within the CAD software, enabling the user 
to extract points from the working piece and defining the type of trajectories 
between those points. This may be the initial procedure, very handy for companies 
having CAD models of their products. After having the sketch of the definition 
file, the user must work with it using the WeldPanel and WeldAdjust tools. The 
working cycle should result in a properly tuned file for the purpose. An example of 
the definition file has already been presented in Figure 5.6. The welding 
parameters may again be obtained from a database. The process can then be 
simulated for trajectory and welding parameters adjustment, and tested until 
desirable performance is achieved, including acceptable welding quality.

The on-line remote control of the weld quality is carried out using a vision system 
focused behind the weld torch, isolated from the torch light. With this method, only 
surface irregularities of the weld, such as undercuts, underfill or variations in the 
weld height, may be detected. Other defects like porosity, inclusions or underbead 
cracks are not detectable using this technique. 
 
The main advantages of the system are the remote control of the welding process 
and the on-line remote control possibilities of the weld quality. 
 
5.4 Discussion 
In this chapter, a robotic welding example was presented, with the objective of 
demonstrating how the various components of a robotic welding system can be 

 
Robotic Welding: Application Examples 163 
 
executed. There are several aspects of the presented implementation that are worth 
discussing in more detail. 
 
5.4.1 IO and Memory Remote Access 
To be able to run a robotic welding application with commanding and monitoring 
functions on a remote computer, the system should be able to: 
 
1. Have IO control capabilities accessible from the remote computer. 
2. Have robot memory access capabilities from the remote computer, namely 
to access program and system variables and data structures. 
 
These features, offered as remote services, are fundamental and must be available. 
Section 4.5 demonstrates two different examples about how to implement and use 
those type of services using RPC and TCP/IP sockets. The solution used in this 
chapter is based on RPC services available from the specific robot controller used 
(ABB S4CPlus M98). A software component to access those services was designed 
and used with the examples presented in this chapter, which exposes the complete 
collection of services available the robot controller just by giving the user the 
appropriated methods, properties and data structures. For example, admitting that 
the object is included on a Microsoft Visual C++ .NET 2003 application, the 
following are possible commands to access IO signals, program variables or 
system variables. 
 
Write to a digital output named “doGAS”: 
 
pcrob.WriteDigital(“doGAS”, value, channel); 
 
where “doGAS” is a digital output signal of the robot IO system, value is the 
digital value to write, and channel identifies the RPC socket open with the 
specified robot controller (the software is able to communicate with any robot on 
the network through 20 channels for each robot). 
 
Read from the analog input “aiCurrentFeedb”: 
 
pcrob.ReadAnalog(“aiCurrentFeedb”, result, channel); 
 
where the returned value is stored in the variable result. 
 
Write to a numeric variable “decision1”: 
 
pcrob.WriteNum(“decision1”, value, channel); 
 
where “decision1” is the numeric variable to write and value is the desired value.

Read from a position/orientation variable “position”: 
 
pcrob.ReadRobTarget(“position”, result, channel); 
 
where result is a data structure of the appropriate type to hold a robtarget 
position/orientation structure [9][10].

Read actual robot position/orientation:

where result is again a data structure of the appropriate type to hold a robtarget 
position/orientation structure [9][10]. 
 
The process of accessing information from the robot controller and from the loaded 
program modules is thus very simple, namely because the necessary data structures 
are available from the above-mentioned software component. For example, the 
code associated with the software button “Read RobT” of the application 
“WeldPanel” (Figure 5.7) is represented in Figure 5.13.

5.4.2 Software Components 
Using software components is an interesting solution, because it simplifies the use 
of certain features hiding the tricky details from the advanced user. Furthermore, 
using “visual” components is also desirable, since they integrate well with the 
available component containers. If the operating system is based on the Distributed 
COM technology (DCOM), then ActiveX components are one of the obvious 
solutions. 
 
5.4.3 CAD Interface 
Actual CAD software packages are powerful 3D tools, very common among 
manufacturing companies. These packages are so popular that it’s fair to say that 
almost every product manufactured in modern countries is designed using some 
type of CAD software package. Consequently, using those tools for robot 
programming is desirable, namely on robotic welding applications, since the 
operator may start the off-line programming of the necessary operations using the 
3D model of the product. The implementation presented in this chapter uses the 
DXF file standard definition, along with some basic rules, to enable users to add 
welding information to the CAD file. That information may be automatically 
extracted from the file and used to program the welding application. This is a 
straightforward procedure not dependant on the particular CAD software package 
used. 
 
 
 
Figure 5.16. Parameterization of an existent welding program 

168 Welding Robots 
 
5.3.3.1 Parameterization Approach 
 
With this approach, the welding information, extracted from the CAD model, is 
used to parameterize a generic already existent robot program, i.e., the welding 
routines are implemented as general as possible enabling the accommodation of the 
planned welding tasks (Figure 5.16). In the case presented here the information 
extracted from the CAD file, and adjusted using the presented software tools, is 
stored in a “.wdf” file and sent to the robot controller using the option “Send to 
Robot” of the “WeldPanel” software tool. The information is sent in the form of 
single column matrices serialized by the sequence that must be followed, i.e., each 
line of any matrix contains the information correspondent to a certain welding 
point. As already mentioned, the robot controller is organized as a server, offering 
a collection of services to the remote computer. Therefore, the following are 
examples of services implemented in the welding server. 
 
Service 9100 (Move_CRobot): this service is used to move the robot in the 
Cartesian space with the specified TOOL frame, in accordance with the 
commanded offsets: x, y, z, rx, ry and rz. Where (x, y, z) are the Cartesian offsets 
and (rx, ry, rz) are the rotation offsets about the tool axis x, y and z, respectively. 
 
Service 9401 (Welding): this service is used to execute the welding sequence 
commanded to the robot. 
 
Service 9301 (Simulation): this service is used to execute the welding sequence 
without igniting the arc, i.e., the welding power source is not activated. 
 
Service 9101 (Move_JRobot): this service is used to move the robot in the joint 
space in accordance with absolute joint angles commanded from the remote 
computer. 
 
Consequently, the main routine of the welding server may be implemented as a 
simple SWITCH-CASE-DO cycle, driven by a variable controlled from the remote 
computer (Figure 5.17). 
 
Looking into the code in more detail it’s easy to find out how it works and how it 
can be explored, but also how new functionalities can be added into the system. 
Let’s consider for example the Move_CRobot service (Figure 5.17) that 
corresponds to the value 9100 of the variable decision1. To move the robot in the 
Cartesian space the following must be commanded from the remote computer. 
 
1. Enter the service routine: to do that the user must write the value 9100 to the 
numeric variable decision1. The method from the PCROBNET2003 software 
component used to command that task is 
 
pcrob.WriteNum(“decision1”, 9100, channel); 
 

 
Robotic Welding: Application Examples 169 
 
where channel identifies the RPC socket open between the robot controller and the 
remote computer.

2. Define the type of motion: the user must specify what type of motion to 
perform to achieve the target point, i.e., linear motion or coordinated joint motion. 
This is specified writing to the variable varmove (198 for joint coordinated motion 
and any other value for linear motion). For example, the command  
 
pcrob.WriteNum(“varmove”, 198, channel); 
 
specifies joint coordinated motion, using the open RPC socket identified by the 
parameter channel. 
 
3. Command the Cartesian and rotational offsets: the user must write the offsets 
to the correspondent variables. After that, when the user signals that the offsets are 
available (writing a value different than zero to the variable move), the robot moves 
to the position/orientation obtained by adding those offsets to the actual position, 
and waits for another motion command. For example, the sequence of commands 
necessary to move the robot 20 mm in the positive X direction and 10 mm in the 
negative Z direction should be 
 
pcrob.WriteNum(“x”, 20, channel); 
pcrob.WriteNum(“y”, -10, channel); 
pcrob.WriteNum(“move”, 1, channel);                          robot moves now! 
 
where again channel identifies the open RPC socket. 
 
4. Leave the service: to leave this service the user must write any value different 
from 9100 to the variable decision1. For example, the following command writes 
the value -1 to the numeric variable decision1 and makes the robot program to quit 
the Move_CRobot service: 
 
pcrob.WriteNum(“decision1”, -1, channel); 
 
Finally, let’s consider the service Welding (Figure 5.17) that corresponds to the 
value 9401 of the variable decision1. The simplified version of the code is 
presented in Figure 5.18. 
 
It is clear from the presented code (Figure 5.18) that the user should command the 
Welding service to execute, after sending the matrices defining the welding 
sequence. This service commands the robot to follow exactly the command 
sequence, moving the robot and igniting or stopping the welding arc whenever in 
the presence of a welding or approach/escape trajectory, respectively. 
 
The presented example shows clearly that there are considerable gains in terms of 
flexibility and agility when using distributed client-server software architecture to 
assist industrial welding operations [11]-[15], namely taking advantage of the 
powerful programming tools developed for personal computers. It also shows that 
actual CAD packages can be used for robot programming tasks with great 
advantages, which extend the interest of already largely utilized software tools.

172 Welding Robots 
 
 
 
Figure 5.19. Definition of the simple welding example using AUTOCAD 
 
To clarify further, let’s consider finally the simple welding example already used 
in Chapter 4. In that example, the robot is commanded to execute a linear welding 
on a work-piece placed on a welding table. To demonstrate how this simple task is 
completely specified and programmed using a CAD package, the welding table and 
work-piece were modeled in AUTOCAD. The same strategy used before is again 
utilized to specify points/orientations and trajectories, i.e., they are all defined 
relative to a work-object point/orientation (or reference system) named Pcorner. In 
this way, when exporting points/orientations and trajectories to the robot the only 
thing needed is a good calibration procedure of the robot TCP relatively to Pcorner, 
which can be done automatically using sensors (for example, laser position 
sensors) and special alignment routines, or manually using the robot joystick. 
 
To execute the welding operation it is necessary to specify four points/orientations 
(P0 to P3) and the trajectories between them (Figure 5.19). The following 
procedures should be used: 
 
1. P0 should be defined as the approach point/orientation, i.e., a 
point/orientation that could permit the robot to reach safely the work-
piece from the “home” position. P0 is consequently a non-welding 
point/orientation and the trajectory to P0 should be free of obstacles (the 
user should guarantee that adjusting P0 accordingly). The precision to 
reach P0 should be specified as low. 
 

 
Robotic Welding: Application Examples 173 
 
2. The trajectory from P0 to P1 should be defined as an approach linear 
trajectory, with point P1 reached with the highest precision at low/medium 
velocity (let say 100mm/s, for example). Consequently, the label 
associated with that trajectory (check Section 5.1.2) should be 
 
WELD 1 0 0 0 100 0 
 
for an approach/escape trajectory, done at 100mm/s with highest precision 
in the end-point. 
 
3. The trajectory from P1 to P2 should be defined as a welding trajectory with 
the required welding parameters. For example, the following label could 
be associated with this trajectory: 
 
WELD 0 150.0 21.3 10 0 
 
for a welding trajectory executed at 10mm/s, with highest precision in the 
end-point, associated with a welding current of 150.0 A and a welding 
voltage of 21.3 V. 
 
4. The trajectory from P2 to P3 should be defined as an approach/escape 
trajectory done with low/medium velocity without any special precision in 
the end-point. The following label could be associated with this trajectory: 
 
WELD 1 0 0 0 100 50 
 
to specify a trajectory done at 100mm/s, with low precision (50 mm 
sphere around the selected point). 
 
This information is saved in the CAD file and can be extracted to a “.wtf” 
definition file, which is used for simulation and final tuning using the already 
presented tools. Finally, the whole information is sent to the robot using the 
already presented procedures, based on the routines developed for the robot 
controller and the “write variable” services (see Table 4.1) available from the 
ActiveX software component used.  
 
5.3.3.2 Code Generation Approach 
 
Another approach would be to generate the welding program, from the scratch, 
directly from the information extracted from the CAD file containing also the 
welding specification (Figure 5.20). 
 

174 Welding Robots 
 
 
 
Figure 5.20. Robotic welding: code generation 
 
The first approach is simpler and suits well our demonstrating needs in this 
chapter. It also works very well for welding applications requiring simple 
parameterization, or that are constituted by well defined welding trajectories. 
Nevertheless, for multi-robot solutions and/or applications where it’s difficult to 
typify all the different welding possibilities in terms of trajectories and welding 
sequences, etc., a code generation based implementation could be desirable. 
Nevertheless, this possibility requires the existence of code generation modules for 
each different robot controller used. 
5.4.4 Low-level Interfaces for Sensors 
The availability of fast low-level interfaces to accommodate tracking sensors is 
needed, namely laser sensors for seam tracking and on-line welding analysis, 
which is usually the case for the majority of the industrial robot controllers. 
Nevertheless, they use proprietary or non-standard protocols which make it hard to 
attach, program and fully explore those sensors. Consequently, the system low-
level interfaces should use well-known data protocols to make the connection to 
any robot controller standard. For example, if some given sensor is capable of 
connecting to the robot controller using a TCP/IP socket connection and a proper 
socket API is available on the robot controller, then connecting any sensor to the 
robot would be very simple. It would be a question of setting up the client running 
on the sensor and parameterizing properly the server running on the robot 
controller (Figure 5.21). 
 

 
Robotic Welding: Application Examples 175 
 
 
 
Figure 5.21. Using a TCT/IP socket connection to interface sensors to robot controllers 
 
This concept, extended to offer higher level remote services from the robot 
controller itself, was presented in Section 4.5.2, where a TCP/IP socket server was 
designed to work as the prime interface with remote computers for commanding 
and monitoring applications.

What’s Next? 
In general terms, actual robot controllers have good programming languages 
although with limited programming tools, which makes the possibility of 
incorporating remote computer systems very interesting. In fact, this procedure 
enables the user/programmer to benefit from the advanced programming and 
analysis tools available for personal computers. This also fits very well with the 
need to distribute software to the various components of the system, since actual 
manufacturing tasks (and welding tasks in particular) are generally very complex 
and require the intervention of several different components: intelligent sensors, 
robot controllers, computers, software packages, PLCs, etc.. This book covered the 
majority of these aspects, with enough detail, pursuing the basic objective of 
showing the actual state-of-the-art about welding processes, sensors and systems 
used to implement robotic welding applications. 
 
Nevertheless, robotic welding remains a very complex task which requires more 
from the robots and related systems.  
 
Robots need to be cheaper, faster, lighter and much easier to program.  
 
These objectives highlight the standardization of the mechanical and computer 
platforms used when building robots, as a way to reduce cost and to have robots 
sharing parts with the other computer systems available on the market.  
 
Furthermore, the above-mentioned objectives also highlight the programming 
languages, on the human-machine software and hardware interfaces, on the robot 
controllers, etc. And also on the need to better observe and correct in real-time the 
welding process, which means a better understanding of the welding processes and 
smarter welding sensors, easier to interface and program. 
 
Moreover, using a robot to execute the welding craft is still a challenge, mainly 
because the new welding processes (like rapid arc and laser welding) require more 
efficient systems with higher-levels of adaptability. 
 

178 Welding Robots 
 
Future developments also include the possibility to interface the robot welding 
cells directly from advanced 3D CAD packages, which will enable on-line 
simulation and testing, also being able to generate complete welding programs 
fully ready for production. 
 
Most of these developments will result from R&D projects done in universities, 
research institutes and companies, or in cooperation between academia and 
industry, resulting in technical papers and new products. This subject is perhaps 
one of the most interesting cases of industry-academia cooperation since most of 
the developments require scientific, technical and operational advances which 
require expertise from both worlds. 
 
Robotic welding is therefore an exciting engineering and scientific challenge that 
the interested reader can also follow by checking updates, links to leading 
institutions and journals, references to selected scientific papers and technical 
articles, including the software used in this book, along with pictures, videos, etc.,
