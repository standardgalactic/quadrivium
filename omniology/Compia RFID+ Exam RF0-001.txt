As they say (well, if they don’t any more, they should), ﬁrst thing ﬁrst. Let me
begin by thanking David Fugate and Andrew Williams who triggered this pro-
ject. With two thumbs up, thanks to Erin Heffernan, the project manager of
this book project, for her focus, dedication, professionalism, and results-oriented
approach.
It takes a team to materialize a book idea into a published book. It is my
great pleasure to acknowledge the hard and smart work of the Syngress team
that made it happen. Here are a few names to mention: Darlene Bordwell for
copy editing, Patricia Lupien for page layout and art, and Richard Carlson for
Indexing. I am thankful to Francesco Kung, the technical editor of this book,
for doing an excellent job in thoroughly reviewing the manuscript and offering
valuable feedback.Also I’m thankful to Corey Cotton for useful comments and
suggestions.
In some ways, writing this book is an expression of the technologist and
educator inside me. I thank my fellow technologists who guided me at various
places during my journey in the computer industry from Novell to Dream
Logic: Chuck Castleton at Novell, Delon Dotson at Netscape and MP3.com,
Kate Peterson at Weborder, and Dr. John Serri at Dream Logic. I also thank my
colleagues and seniors in the ﬁeld of education for helping me in so many ways
to become a better educator. Here are a few to mention: Dr. Gerald Pauler
(Brooks College), Professor David Hayes (San Jose State University), Professor
Michael Burke (San Jose State University), and Dr. John Serri (University of
Phoenix).
Friends always lend a helping hand, in many visible and invisible ways, in
almost anything important we do in our lives. Without them, the world would
be a very boring and uncreative place. Here are a few I would like to mention:
Stanley Wong, Patrick Smith, Kulwinder, Major Bhupinder Singh Daler, Ruth
Gordon, Srilatha Moturi, Baldev Khullar, and the Kandola family (Gurmail and
Sukhwinder).
Last, but not least, my appreciation (along with my heart) goes to my wife,
Renee, and my son,Adam, for not only peacefully coexisting with my book
projects but also supporting them.

Introduction
How would you like it if, for instance, one day you realized your
underwear was reporting on your whereabouts? 
— Debra Bowen, California State Senator, at a 2003 hearing  
In this book, you will not only learn the basics of radio frequency identiﬁcation
(RFID), but also prepare for the CompTIA RFID+ certiﬁcation exam in the
process of doing so: two in one. In other words, this book covers the topics
determined by the exam objectives for the CompTIA RFID+ certiﬁcation
exam, RF0-001. Each chapter explores topics in RFID speciﬁed by a set of
exam objectives in a manner that makes the presentation cohesive, concise, and
yet comprehensive.
Who This Book is For
This book is primarily targeted at the RFID professionals and students who
want to prepare for the CompTIA RFID+ exam, RF0-001. Since the book has
a laser-sharp focus on the exam objectives, expert RFID professionals who
want to pass the exam can use this book to ensure that they do not overlook
any objective.Yet, it is not an exam-cram book.The chapters and the sections
inside each chapter are presented in a logical learning sequence: Every new
chapter builds upon knowledge acquired in previous chapters, and there is no
hopping from topic to topic. The concepts and topics, simple and complex, are
explained in a concise yet comprehensive fashion.This facilitates stepwise

learning and prevents confusion. Furthermore, chapter 1 presents very basic
introduction to physics and math concepts relevant to learning RFID for the
absolute beginners. Hence, this book is also very useful for beginners to get up
to speed quickly even if they are new to RFID and do no have the necessary
physics and math background. Even after the exam, you will ﬁnd yourself
returning to this book as a useful and practical reference for basics of RFID.
In a nutshell, this book can be used by the following audiences:
■
RFID professionals and students who want to prepare for the
CompTIA RFID+ exam
■
RFID professionals who are looking for a quick and practical RFID
reference
■
Beginners who want to join the RFID profession
■
Instructors who want to offer a basic course on RFID
How this Book is Structured 
The structure of this book is determined by the following two requirements:
■
The book is equally useful for both the beginners and the experts who
want to pass the CompTIA RFID+ exam.
■
Although it has a laser sharp focus on the exam objectives, the book is
not an exam cram. It presents the material in a logical learning
sequence so that the book can be used for learning (or teaching) basics
of RFID.
With the exception of the introductory chapter 1, each chapter begins with
a list and explanation of exam objectives on which the chapter is focused.We
have somewhat rearranged the order of the exam domains to keep the topics
and the subject matter in line with sequential learning and to avoid hopping
from topic to topic.
The ﬁrst section in each chapter is the Introduction, in which we establish
the concepts or topics that will be explored in the chapter.As you read through
a chapter, you will ﬁnd the following features:
■
Note. Notes emphasize important concepts or information 
■
Caution. Cautions point out information that may be contrary to
your expectations depending upon your level of experience with the

Prerequisites
Neither the CompTIA RFID+ exam nor this book has any pre-requisite.
About the RFID+ exam
Neither the physics behind it, nor the RFID technology itself is new. But it’s
only recently that the greatness has been bestowed upon RFID by the giant

inﬂuencers such as U.S. Department of Defense and Wal-Mart in their man-
dates, and in a ﬂurry of industrial mandates that followed. Now armed with
these mandates, government legislations, and the resulting hyperbole, RFID has
set its journey to change the world.With the market for RFID services pro-
jected to exceed $4 billion by 2008, a late start by a corporation in evaluating
and implementing the technology could turn into a competitive disadvantage.
Taking on the opportunity, the Computing Technology Industry Association
(CompTIA) has launched the RFID+ certiﬁcation in an effort to develop the
workforce and provide the industry with a standard for measuring competency
in the installation and maintenance of RFID.

Physics, Math, and 
RFID: Mind the Gap
Chapter 1
RFID+

Introduction
What do the U.S. Department of Defense, Wal-Mart, and you have in common? Radio
frequency identiﬁcation, or RFID! Whether you choose to know about it or not, RFID
affects you and the world around you in a ubiquitous way. So, congratulations that you
have chosen to learn about it.
The ﬁrst thing to understand about RFID is that it is an application of physics to
the extent that the core functioning of RFID technology is governed by the laws of
physics.You don’t need to have a Ph.D. in physics to become a successful RFID profes-
sional, but an understanding of the physics of RFID will enable you to design, deploy,
and operate RFID systems in an optimal way. In this chapter, we attempt to ease your
way into physics as it relates to RFID by explaining some basic physics concepts.As they
say, mathematics is the language of physics, or of any science for that matter.The good
news is that you need only very simple math to understand RFID: powers of 10, loga-
rithms, and some unit conversions. Before you dive into the book, we take a bird’s-eye
view of RFID in this chapter.The goal is to provoke you to start asking questions about
the details that will be addressed in the forthcoming chapters.
The overall goal of this chapter is to help you avoid falling into the gaps between
physics, math, and RFID. We ﬁll those gaps by exploring three avenues: basic physics
concepts, the math of RFID, and an overview of RFID.
Some Bare-Bones Physics Concepts
Just when you thought you got away with missing physics classes in high school, here
comes a physics lecture for you! But fear not. It’s going to be very simple and concise.
As you already know, physics is a discipline in natural science.The word science has
its origin in a Latin word that means to know. Science is the body of knowledge of the
natural world, organized in a rational and veriﬁable way.The word physics has its origin
in the Greek word that means nature. Physics is that branch (or discipline) of science that
deals with understanding the universe and its systems in terms of fundamental con-
stituents of matter (such as atoms, electrons, and quarks) and the interactions among
those constituents. Applied physics refers to the practical (such as technological) use of
physics—for example, electronics, engineering, and RFID. In other words, applied
physics involves utilizing basic physics principles to build practical devices and systems
such as radios, televisions, cellular phones, or an RFID system.
To clear your way toward understanding the physics behind RFID, let’s look at some
basic physics concepts:
■
Physical quantity A measurable observable is called a physical quantity. In
physics, we understand the universe and the systems in the universe in terms of
physical quantities and the relationships among them. In other words, laws of
physics are expressed in terms of relationships among the physical quantities.
2
Chapter 1 • Physics, Math, and RFID: Mind the Gap
www.syngress.com

Length, time, speed, force, energy, and temperature are some examples of phys-
ical quantities.
■
Unit A physical quantity is measured in numbers of a basic amount called a
unit.The measurement of a quantity contains a number and a unit—for
example, in 15 miles, mile is a unit of distance (or length).
■
Force  This is the inﬂuence that an object exerts on another object to cause
some change.
■
Interaction This is a mutual force between two objects through which they
affect each other. For example, two particles attract each other or repel each
other. Sometimes the words interaction and force are used synonymously.There
are four known basic interactions (or forces) that keep the universe functioning
together:
■
Gravitational force
■
Electromagnetic force
■
Strong nuclear force
■
Weak nuclear force
Where there is a force, there is energy, or potential for energy.
■
Energy Energy is the measure of the ability of a force to do work.There are
different kinds of energies corresponding to different forces, such as electro-
magnetic energy.
■
Power Power is the amount of work done or the energy transferred per unit
time.
■
Work Work is a measure of the amount of change produced by a force acting
on an object. But how is it possible that two objects separated from each other
can exert force on each other? This is where the concept of ﬁeld comes into
the picture.
■
Field The basic forces of nature work between two objects without the
objects physically touching each other. For example, Sun and Earth attract each
other through gravitation force without touching each other.This effect is
called action at a distance and is explained in physics by the concept of a ﬁeld.
The two objects (which, for example, attract or repel each other from a dis-
tance) create a ﬁeld in the space between them, and it is that ﬁeld that exerts
the force on the objects. For example, there is a gravitation ﬁeld corresponding
to gravitational force and an electromagnetic ﬁeld corresponding to electro-
magnetic force.

■
Speed Speed, in general, means the rate of something. In physics, it means the
rate of motion; for example, your car is moving at a speed of 70 miles per
hour.
■
Hypothesis  A hypothesis is a principle-like statement made as an explanation
of a phenomenon and is generally based on previous observations, extensions
of existing scientiﬁc theories, or both.The scientiﬁc method requires that a sci-
entiﬁc hypothesis must be veriﬁable; that is, you must be able to test it.The
word hypothesis has its roots in the Greek word that means to suppose.
■
Law A physics law (also called a physical law, a law of nature, or a scientiﬁc
law) is a set of generalized conclusions based on observations of physical
behavior through repeated scientiﬁc experiments, and these conclusions are
generally accepted within the scientiﬁc community.A hypothesis may turn
into a law through repeated conﬁrmation by scientiﬁc experiments.
Of the four basic interactions in the universe, the interaction that is relevant to
RFID is the electromagentic interaction, which exhibits itself in our world in many
forms, including electricity and magnetism.
Understanding Electricity
Electricity is the property of matter related to electric charge. Historically, the word elec-
tricity has been used by several scientists to mean electric charge.This property (elec-
tricity) is responsible for several natural phenomena such as lightning and is used in
several industrial applications such as electric power and the whole ﬁeld of electronics.
To understand electricity, you must understand the related concepts discussed in the
following:
Electric charge Electric charge, also referred to simply as charge, is a basic
property of some fundamental particles of matter.There are two types of
charge: positive and negative. For example, an electron has a negative charge,
and a positron (an anti-particle of electron) has a positive charge. The standard
symbol used to represent charge is q or Q. Two particles (or objects) with the
same type of charge repel each other, and two objects with the opposite types
of charge attract each other.The charge is measured in units of coulomb,
denoted by C.
Electric potential/voltage The electric potential difference between two
points is the work required to take one unit, C, of charge from one point to
another.This is commonly called electric potential or voltage because it’s measured
in units of volt, denoted by V.

Capacitance This is the amount of charge stored in a system, called a
capacitor, per unit of electric potential. In other words, the capacitance, C, is
deﬁned by the following equation:
C = Q/V
One example of a capacitor is the so-called parallel plates capacitor: two
metallic plates separated from each other, with each plate carrying equal and
opposite charge, Q, with a potential difference between them, V. Capacitance
is measured in units of farad, denoted by F. For example, if the charge on each
plate of a parallel plate capacitor is one C, and the voltage between them is one
V, the capacitance of the capacitor will be one F.
Electric current This is the rate of ﬂow of electric charge per unit time and
can be deﬁned by the following equation:
I = Q/t
In this equation, I is the current and Q is the amount of charge that ﬂowed
past a point in time t. Current is measured in units of ampere, denoted by A.
For example, one C of charge ﬂowing past a point in one second represents
one A of current.The material such as metals that permit relatively free ﬂow
of charge are called conductors, whereas the materials such as glass that do not
allow free ﬂow of charge are called insulators.
Resistance This is a measure of opposition offered by a material to the ﬂow
of charge through it.The resistance can be measured by the following 
equation:
I = V/R
This means the larger the resistance, the smaller the current. Resistance is mea-
sured in units of ohm, denoted by Ω. For example, if the voltage of one V
creates one A of current in a conductor, then the resistance of the conductor
is one Ω.
Electric energy This is the amount of work that can be done by an amount
of electric charge across a potential difference. For example, the energy, E, of a
charge Q across a voltage V is given by the following equation:
E = QV
Electric power This is the rate of work performed by an electric current. In
other words, it’s the electric energy produced or consumed per unit of time,
and is given by the following equation:

P = E/t = QV/t = IV
The power is measured in units of watt (W). For example, the power con-
sumed to maintain a current of one A across a voltage of one V is one W.
EXERCISE 1.1
Show that electric power can also be expressed by the following equations:
P = I2R
P = V2/R 
Solution: We know that:
P = IV
We also know that:
I = V/R
Therefore:
P = IV = (V/R)V = V2R
But:
I = V/R  means V=IR
Therefore:
P = IV = I x IR = I2R
Electric ﬁeld Electric ﬁeld is a ﬁeld that charges at a distance used to exert
force on each other. In other words, the charges at a distance interact with
each other through their ﬁelds, called electric ﬁelds.
Two charges of the same type exert repulsive force on each other, and two
charges of opposite types exert attractive force on each other, and this force is
called electric force. A charge in motion creates another kind of force, called mag-
netic force.
Understanding Magnetism
Magnetism is the property of material that enables two objects to exert a speciﬁc kind of
force on each other, called magnetic force, which is created by electric charge in motion.
To understand magnetism, you must understand the related concepts discussed in the
following:
Magnetic ﬁeld A magnetic ﬁeld is a ﬁeld produced by a moving charge that
it uses to exert magnetic force on another moving charge.

Chapter 1 • Physics, Math, and RFID: Mind the Gap

Magnetic ﬂux This is a measure of the quantity of magnetic ﬁeld through a
certain area. It is proportional to the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld and the
surface area under consideration. For example, the current running through a
wire in a circuit will create the magnetic ﬁeld and hence the magnetic ﬂux in
the area around it.
Faraday’s Law Faraday’s Law states that the change in magnetic ﬂux creates
electromotive force, which is practically a voltage. In other words, the changing
magnetic ﬂux through a circuit will induce a current in the circuit. Recall that
the magnetic ﬂux can be created by the current in a circuit. Faraday’s Law says
the reverse:The change in ﬂux can create current.
Inductive coupling Consider two electric circuits next to each other.There
will be magnetic ﬂux through the second circuit due to the current in the ﬁrst
circuit. If you change the current in the ﬁrst circuit, it will change the mag-
netic ﬂux through the second circuit, and the change in magnetic ﬂux will
create the current through the second circuit due to Faraday’s Law.This effect,
called inductive coupling, is used in RFID systems.You will see in this book that
readers use inductive coupling to communicate with passive tags in an RFID
system.You will be introduced to readers and tags later in this chapter.
Electricity and magnetism are related to each other and can be looked upon as two
facets of what is called electromagnetism.
Understanding Electromagnetism
Electromagnetism is the unified framework through which to understand electricity,
magnetism, and the relationship between them—in other words, to understand electric
fields and magnetic fields and the relationship among them.To see the relationship,
first recall that a charge creates an electric field and that when the same charge starts
moving, it creates a magnetic field.The electric field exerts electric force, whereas a
magnetic field exerts magnetic force; both originate from the electric charge.
Therefore, they are intimately related:A changing electric field produces a magnetic
field, and a changing magnetic field produces an electric field. Due to this intimacy,
the electric force and magnetic force are considered two different manifestations of
the same unified force, called electromagnetic (EM) force.The unified form of the electric
field and magnetic field is called an electromagnetic field, and the electric field and the
magnetic field are considered its components. In other words, electromagnetic force is
exerted by an electromagnetic field.
Where there is a force, there is energy.The energy corresponding to electromagnetic
force is called electromagnetic energy or electromagnetic radiation.This energy is transferred
from one point in space to another point through what are called electromagnetic waves.

Electromagnetic Waves
A wave is a disturbance of some sort that propagates through space and transfers some
kind of energy from one point to another. For example, when you speak to a person
face to face, the sound wave travels from your mouth to the ear of the listener.The “dis-
turbance” here is the change of pressure in the air.As long as the wave is traveling
through a point, the air pressure at that point does not stay constant over time.The dis-
turbance in an electromagnetic ﬁeld is the change of electric and magnetic ﬁeld.The
wave can be looked upon as propagation of this disturbance.
As shown in Figure 1.1, you can describe a wave in terms of some parameters such
as amplitude, frequency, and wavelength.
Figure 1.1 The Parameters of a Wave
■
Wavelength  Denoted by the symbol λ, this is the distance between two con-
secutive crests or two consecutive troughs of a wave.The distance equal to
wavelength makes one cycle of change.
■
Amplitude  Amplitude is the maximum amount of disturbance during one
wave cycle.
■
Frequency  This is the number of cycles per unit of time a wave repeats.The
frequency of an electromagnetic wave, f, propagating through free space (a
vacuum), is calculated using the following equation:
f = c/λ
c is the velocity of light in vacuum.The frequency is measured in units of
Hertz. One cycle per second is one Hertz, denoted by Hz.

■
Phase This is the current position in the cycle of change in a wave.
So, what is the frequency of EM waves? EM waves cover a wide spectrum of fre-
quencies, and the ranges of these frequencies constitute one way we deﬁne different
types of EM waves.
Types of Electromagnetic Waves
Electromagnetic waves can be grouped according to the direction of disturbance in
them and according to the range of their frequency. Recall that a wave transfers energy
from one point to another point in space.That means there are two things going on: the
disturbance that deﬁnes a wave, and the propagation of wave. In this context the waves
are grouped into the following two categories:
■
Longitudinal waves A wave is called a longitudinal wave when the distur-
bances in the wave are parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave. For
example, sound waves are longitudinal waves because the change of pressure
occurs parallel to the direction of wave propagation.
■
Transverse waves A wave is called a transverse wave when the disturbances in
the wave are perpendicular (at right angles) to the direction of propagation of
the wave.
Electromagnetic waves are transverse waves.That means the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds change (oscillate) in a plane that is perpendicular to the direction of propagation
of the wave.Also note that electric and magnetic ﬁelds in an EM wave are also perpen-
dicular to each other.
NOTE
Electric ﬁelds and magnetic ﬁelds (E and B) in an EM wave are perpendicular to
each other and are also perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the
wave. 
Because electric and magnetic ﬁelds change in a plane (perpendicular to the direc-
tion of wave propagation), the direction of change still has some freedom. Different ways
of using this freedom provide another criterion to classify electromagnetic waves into
the following:
■
Linearly polarized waves If the electric ﬁeld (and hence the magnetic ﬁeld)
changes in such a way that its direction remains parallel to a line in space as
the wave travels, the wave is called linearly polarized.
www.syngress.com
Physics, Math, and RFID: Mind the Gap • Chapter 1
9

■
Circularly polarized waves If the change in electric ﬁeld occurs in a circle
or in an ellipse, the wave is called circularly or elliptically polarized.Therefore, the
polarization of a transverse wave determines the direction of disturbance
(oscillation) in a plane perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.
CAUTION
Only transverse waves can be polarized, because in a longitudinal wave, the dis-
turbance is always parallel to the direction of wave propagation.
So, you can classify electromagnetic waves based on the direction of disturbance in
them (polarization).The other criterion to classify EM waves is the frequency.
The Electromagnetic Spectrum
Have you ever seen electromagnetic waves with your naked eye? The answer, of course,
is yes! Visible light is an example of electromagnetic waves. In addition to visible light,
electromagnetic waves include radio waves, ultraviolet radiation, and X-rays (which of
course are not visible to the naked eye).These different kinds of EM waves only differ in
their frequency and therefore their wavelength.The whole frequency range of EM
waves is called the electromagnetic spectrum, which is illustrated in Figure 1.2, along with
the names associated with different frequency ranges within the spectrum.
Figure 1.2 The Electromagnetic Spectrum
As shown in Figure 1.2, the radio waves occupy a major part of the electromagnetic
spectrum.As the name suggests, a radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) system uses
radio waves to communicate.

If the numbers in Figure 1.2 do not make sense to you and if you have forgotten all
about scientiﬁc notation, units of measurement, and logarithms, you will need to brush
up on these math-related concepts to make your journey through this book smoother.
The Mathematics of RFID
This section discusses some math-related concepts such as scientiﬁc notation, units, and
logarithm. Understanding these concepts will help you more ﬁrmly grasp the concepts
discussed throughout this book.
Scientiﬁc Notation
To express numbers, scientists use a notation called scientiﬁc notation. It simpliﬁes handling
very large and very small numbers. Using this notation, you express a number as a
product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10. For example, the number
174,000 is expressed in scientiﬁc notation as:
1.74 x 105
To convert a number in scientiﬁc notation to the ordinary notation, here is the rule:
Count as many places as the power of 10 after the decimal point, replace any empty
place with a 0, and remove the point. For example:
1.25 x 104 = 12500
104 = 1 x 104 = 10000
Some powers of 10 have a name called a preﬁx. For example, 103 is called kilo, as in
kilometer or kilogram.These powers of 10 in common use are shown in Table 1.1,
along with the numbers they represent.

NOTE
The power of 10 is also called exponent. For example, in 103, the number 3 is
an exponent. In general, a mathematical operation written as xn is called “x
raised to the power n.” This is also called exponentiation, with x as a base and
n as an exponent.
In general, ax is called an exponential function. It means multiply the base with itself as
many times as the exponent. For example:
23 = 2 * 2 *2 = 8
Remember the following two formulae for exponential functions.The ﬁrst 
formula is:
ax * ay =     ax+y
For example:
22*23  =  25 = 2*2*2*2*2 = 32
The second formula is:
ax / ay = ax-y
For example:
25/23  =  22 = 2*2= 4
In addition to exponentiation, there is another function relevant to this book: the
logarithmic function.
Logarithms
Logarithm is the inverse of an exponential function:
y = ax => x = logay
The expression logay is read as log y to the base a. For example:
1000 = 103 => 3 = log101000
The base 10 is a default for the term log; that is, log (1000) means log of 1000 to the
base 10.After understanding the deﬁnition of log, you need to remember three more
formulae for the log function.The ﬁrst formula is:
log xn = n * log x
www.syngress.com
12
Chapter 1 • Physics, Math, and RFID: Mind the Gap

For example:
log 1000 = log 103 = 3 * log 10
The second formula is:
log (x*y) = log x + log y
For example:
log 1000 = log(10*100) = log 10 + log 100
The third formula is:
log (x/y) = log x – log y
For example:
log 100  = log (10000/100) = log 10000 – log 100
An example of use of your knowledge of logarithm is the decibel unit.
Decibel
Decibel, denoted by the symbol db, is a measure of the ratio of two values of a physical
quantity such as power or voltage expressed in terms of logarithm.To be precise, the
ratio X1/X2 of a physical quantity X will be expressed in decibels as:
X (db) = 10 * log (X1/X2)
EXERCISE 1.2
How will the ratio of electric power be expressed in decibels in terms of the
ratio of voltage?
Solution:
Recall that:
P = V2/R
P (db) = 10 * log(P1/P2) = 10 log(V1
2/V2
2) = 10 log (V1/V2)2 = 2*10 log
(V1/V2)
=  20 * log (V1/V2)
P(db) = 20 log (V1/V2)
Now, if you see a relationship like this, you know why there is a 20 in front
of log rather than 10.

in some kind of units.

Equipped with these basic physics and math concepts, you are now ready to explore
the RFID ﬁeld. Let’s start by taking the bird’s-eye view of the RFID landscape.
An Overview of RFID: How It Works
The story of RFID starts with one word: identiﬁcation. RFID is here to replace existing
identiﬁcation technologies such as the barcode, which is used to identify an item by
assigning it a unique number.An example of the barcode is shown in Figure 1.3. No
doubt you have seen such barcodes on various products ranging from water bottles to
wine cartons and from books to cases that contain quantities of items.
Figure 1.3 An Example of a Barcode on a Book
According to a display in the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of
American History, the ﬁrst purchase of a product with a barcode was made on June 26,
1974, at a supermarket in Ohio.Today, almost everything that you buy from retailers has
a barcode printed on it.These barcodes help manufacturers and retailers in the following
ways:
■
Keep track of inventory 
■
Provide information about the quantity of products being sold
■
Speed up the checkout process
The barcode technology has the following limitations:
www.syngress.com
Physics, Math, and RFID: Mind the Gap • Chapter 1
15

■
A barcode identiﬁes a type of product, not an individual item in that type.
■
Tracking is not automatic. For example, to keep track of inventory, you must
scan each barcode on every item of a product.
■
A barcode does not contain much information other than the product type
code.
■
A barcode is a read-only technology; that is, you cannot change the informa-
tion on the barcode or add new information to it.
So, the basic promise of barcodes is to provide identiﬁcation of products at the class
level. RFID is replacing those barcodes with a greater promise: automatic and global
identiﬁcation and tracking of objects (at the individual level), which could include
almost anything: individual product items in retail stores, animals, trees—even people.
Here is one of many possible scenarios relating how RFID works:
1.
A label-like electronic device called a tag is attached to an object that needs to
be identiﬁed and tracked.The tag contains the unique identiﬁcation of the
object and possibly more information about it.
2.
Another electronic device called a reader is mounted at speciﬁc localities.
3.
When a tagged object passes near any reader, the reader communicates with
the tag and gets the information that the tag has about the object.
4.
The reader passes the information to a host computer, which is typically part
of a network connected to the Internet.
5.
The host computers from several localities send the information about tagged
objects to a central location.
6.
The information is integrated at the central location into database manage-
ment systems and can be analyzed by enterprise applications.
This scenario is depicted in Figure 1.4.The readers and tags use EM waves in the
radio wave frequency range to communicate with each other.
NOTE
Note. A reader is also called an interrogator, and a tag is also called a
transponder.

Chapter 1 • Physics, Math, and RFID: Mind the Gap

Figure 1.4 Readers Collect Information from Tags at Various Locations and Send
It to a Central Location Over the Internet
The advantages of RFID technology over barcode technology are as follows:
■
The identiﬁcation and tracking offered by RFID is at individual item level as
opposed to the type level.
■
A tag can contain more information about the object than just its ID.
■
Depending on the type of tag, you can change the information on it.
■
The objects can be tracked globally, automatically, and in real time, if needed.
In other words, an RFID tag attached to an object is an intelligent barcode that can
communicate through readers to a global network system to inform it where the object
is. RFID technology can support a wide spectrum of applications, from tracking cattle to
tracking trillions of consumer products worldwide, thereby enabling manufacturers to
know the location of each product during its life cycle, from the time it’s manufactured
to the time it’s consumed and tossed in a recycle bin or a trash can.You can see that
RFID is going to be more ubiquitous than barcode, and its applications are limited only
by your imagination. Here is a list of some applications to get you started:
■
Asset tracking This includes tracking of assets everywhere, such as in ofﬁces,
labs, warehouses, and libraries.

■
Health care applications This includes positively identifying and tracking
patients in a health care facility or a hospital, linking a patient with the right
medicine and doctor or nurse, identifying unresponsive patients, and so on.
■
Livestock tracking This includes tracking animals in places such as farms
and zoos and linking them to their proper locations.
■
Supply chain tracking This includes tracking items through the supply
chain and managing inventory.The supply chain ﬁeld is the key early adopter
of RFID technology.
■
Tracking in manufacturing This includes tracking parts during the manu-
facturing process as well as tracking the assembled items.
■
Tracking in retail stores This includes tracking store trolleys and shelves,
thereby facilitating automatic payment, checkouts, and inventory management.
■
Tracking in Warehouses  This includes real-time inventory tracking and
management in a warehouse or storeroom by tracking items inside, items
coming in, and items going out.
■
Tracking you Yes, RFID will track any object, including people—for
example, tracking people entering a certain area for security purposes, auto-
matic contact management at events instead of sticking notes on bulletin
boards, tracking babies in hospitals, tracking children at theme parks and festi-
vals, and so on.
“Hold on—tracking me?” you say, and you’d be right about the privacy issues. But
that’s a topic for another book.
So the two main players in a core RFID system are the reader and the tag.You can
start asking questions about them, such as this one: From how far apart can a reader and
a tag communicate with each other? In other words, how large is the read range? Well, it
could be anywhere from a centimeter to a few meters, depending on several factors,
including the tag type and the value of the radio frequency being used for communica-
tion, called operating frequency.
Next, what do we mean by tag types? The tags can be categorized by different cri-
teria. One of those criteria is the power source from which tags will draw energy to
operate and to communicate.The tags that have their own power source such as a bat-
tery are called active tags, whereas the tags that do not have their own power source are
called passive tags. A passive tag cannot do anything until it receives a signal (radio wave)
from a reader to wake it up. It uses part of the energy from the signal to operate and the
rest to communicate back to the reader—that is, to send back a radio wave. Recall the
concept of inductive coupling, discussed earlier in this chapter.This is what goes on
www.syngress.com
18
Chapter 1 • Physics, Math, and RFID: Mind the Gap

between a reader and an inductive passive tag:The magnetic energy is transferred from
the reader to the passive tag through inductive coupling to power it up. It’s as though
the reader were saying,“Hello, Mr.Tag, time to wake up and tell me everything you
know about this object.”
Just like the read range, the readers and tags come in various sizes and shapes. Figure
1.5 shows a reader and a tag on the smaller end of the size spectrum. I know your next
question: How do a reader and a tag really communicate with each other? That question
goes to the physics behind RFID, which is discussed in the next chapter.
Figure 1.5 A Reader and a Tag: Skyetek’s M1-mini (Image courtesy of Skyetek) 
For now, note that neither the physics behind RFID nor the RFID technology itself
is new. But it’s only recently that greatness has been bestowed upon RFID by giant
inﬂuencers such as the U.S. Department of Defense and Wal-Mart in their mandates and
in a ﬂurry of industrial mandates that followed. Now, armed with these mandates, gov-
ernment legislations, and the resulting hyperbole, RFID has set its journey to change the
world.The forthcoming chapters will help prepare you to make your contribution to
this revolution.
NOTE
Talking about legislation, the U.S. State Department has legislated that all U.S.
passports must contain an RFID chip (tag) by the end of 2006. The chip, in addi-
tion to holding the standard passport data—name, address, birth date, and
nationality—will also be able to hold biometric information such as iris scans
and digital ﬁngerprints. The European Union has its own RFID passport initiative
under way.

The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■
Electromagnetic force, one of the four basic forces that govern our universe,
exhibits itself in the form of electromagnetic waves, which underline the
physics behind RFID.
■
While working with RFID, you will use simple mathematical concepts such as
power of 10, logarithms, and some simple unit conversions.
■
At the heart of an RFID system are two kinds of communication device:
readers and tags.A tag is attached to an object that needs to be identiﬁed and
tracked and contains information about the object.The reader collects the
information about the object from the tag. Readers and tags use radio waves, a
type of electromagnetic wave, to communicate with each other.
Summary
Our universe is governed by four natural forces: gravitation force, strong nuclear force,
weak nuclear force, and electromagentic force. Where there is a force, there is energy,
which is the ability of the force to do work.The amount of work done can be expressed
in terms of power, which is the amount of energy transfer per unit of time. Work is per-
formed when a force acts on an object and causes a change. For example, the Sun makes
the Earth revolve around it by exerting gravitational force on it. Similarly, charged
objects separated from each other can exert electromagnetic force on each other. How
does an object exert force on another object without touching it? That happens through
the ﬁeld that exists between the two objects due to the force.
Of the four basic forces in the universe, the force that is relevant to RFID is the
electromagnetic force, which exhibits itself in terms of electromagnetic waves.
Electromagnetic waves, like any other wave, are characterized by their frequency and
wavelength.These waves cover a wide spectrum of frequencies, called electromagnetic
spectrum. Waves corresponding to one of the ranges in this spectrum are called radio
waves.The radio waves are used by an RFID system for communication.
At the heart of an RFID system are two kinds of communication devices: tags and
readers.A tag (an alternative to the barcode) is placed on an object that needs to be
identiﬁed and tracked.The readers mounted at various locations read the information
about the object from the tag and report it to the host computer, which in turn can
send this information to a central location over the Internet.This way, an object can be
tracked globally and in real time in an automatic fashion.
After learning the basic physics concepts in this chapter, you are ready to explore the
physics behind RFID in the next chapter.

Introduction
The core functionality of an RFID system is the communication between a reader and a
tag.The communication is carried out using RF waves, which are basically the EM
waves with frequencies from the subspectrum of EM frequency spectrum called radio fre-
quencies.The propagation of these waves is governed by the underlying physics princi-
ples.The goal of this chapter is to help you understand some physics concepts related to
this communication.To accomplish this goal, we will explore three avenues: generation
and propagation of the RF wave carrying the data signal from the source to the antenna,
emission of the RF wave by the antenna into the free space, and propagation of the RF
wave traveling through the space. Pay attention to the characteristics that affect the per-
formance of an RFID system during this journey of the RF wave.
Understanding Radio 
Frequency Communication 
Generally speaking, RFID is a means to identify an object using radio frequency trans-
mission, which suggests that communication is involved in the identiﬁcation process.
The communication takes place between two devices: a reader that needs the informa-
tion and a tag that has the information. Before we dive into the physics of communica-
tion, let’s get on the same page about some concepts that are at the heart of this
communication.
Elements of Radio Frequency Communication
Radio frequency communication uses the EM waves with frequencies from a speciﬁc
part of the EM frequency spectrum.Therefore, the underlying physics behind RF com-
munication is the same as for any communication that uses electromagnetic waves to
carry information.The four major players that make this communication happen are the
following:
■
Data signal This is the wave that actually contains the information that needs
to be sent to the receiver.
■
Carrier signal This is the wave that carries the data signal.
■
Modulation This is the process that encodes the data signal into the carrier
signal and creates the radio wave that is actually transmitted by the antenna to
propagate.
■
Antenna This is a device used to transmit and receive signals such as radio
waves.

NOTE
In an RFID system, both the reader and the tag have their own antennas
through which they communicate with each other. A tag is also called a
transponder because it responds to the reader’s attempt to read it, and the
reader is also called a transceiver because it receives information from the tag.
Here is how these four players work together to make the communication happen.
First, understand that the information is communicated through changes (such as vibra-
tions) in the carrier signal.The carrier signal itself is a constant signal unchanging in fre-
quency and voltage—for example, a sine wave. It represents no information.As an
analogy, I would not convey much information if I merely produced a constant sound
out of my mouth, such as:
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
To convey some information, I would need to speak different sentences and dif-
ferent words in a sentence. In radio frequency communication, the information is
encoded into the carrier signal using a technique called modulation, which means varia-
tion or change.You take the data signal that represent the information and impress it on
a constant radio wave called a carrier.The data signal, as a result, varies (or modulates)
the carrier wave. Once transmitted through an antenna, the two go together dancing
over the air in the form of a modulated signal.The process of encoding the data signal
into the carrier wave is called modulation.The transmitted modulated signal is received by
the antenna on the receiving end and is demodulated to obtain the data signal.The pro-
cess is depicted in Figure 2.1.

That all sounds good. But note that the original data signal itself has information in
it, which is represented by the changes inherent in the signal. So the question is: Why
don’t we transmit the original data signal, or why do we need modulation in the ﬁrst
place?
Modulation: Don’t Leave Antenna Without It
There are several reasons for the use of modulation in communication. Discussing the
following two will be sufﬁcient for the scope of this book.
The Propagation Problem
A data signal generally comprises a whole range of different frequencies together.The
problem with the low-frequency components of the signal is that few communication
media will allow the propagation of low frequencies without distortion. Modulation
presents the solution to this problem by copying these low-frequency components to
high-frequency carrier waves.
The Transmission Problem
The low-frequency data signal will have a high wavelength and as a result will require
very large antennas for transmission and reception. Here is the rule of thumb:To achieve
a useful amount of radiation, the antenna length should be at least one quarter of the
wavelength of the wave to be propagated. For example, consider a signal component
with frequency of 1 KHz.The wavelength for this wave will be:
λ = c/f = (3 x 108 m/s)/ (103 1/s) = 300 km
Antenna length = λ /4 km
A 75-kilometer-high antenna (the tower of Babylon)? You get the point.
Modulation solves this problem by sending the low-frequency signal inside a high-fre-
quency carrier wave. For example, as shown in Exercise 2.1, a frequency of 900 MHz
(for the carrier signal) will give you the antenna length of 8.3 cm.
EXERCISE 2.1
Calculate the optimum antenna size for a cellular phone working at 900 MHz. 
Solution:
λ = c/f = (3 x 108 m/s)/ (900x106 1/s) = 1/3 m
Antenna length = λ/4 m = 1/12m = 8.33 cm

Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID

So, basically, the modulation promotes the frequency band (range of frequencies) of
the data signal to higher-frequency bands so that it can be transmitted for a safe journey.
It’s important to understand the role of these frequency bands in the story of radio fre-
quency communication.
Frequency Bands in Modulation
In the description of the modulation used for communication, some terms referring to
different frequency bands are often used.A frequency band refers to a speciﬁc range of fre-
quencies.These terms are described as follows:
■
Baseband This is the range of frequencies of the original data signal before
modulation.
■
Sideband This is the frequency band on either the higher side or the lower
side of the carrier frequency band within which the frequencies produced by
modulation fall.
■
Upper sideband (USB) This is the sideband above the carrier frequency.
■
Lower sideband (LSB) This is the sideband below the carrier frequency.
As depicted in Figure 2.2, the information (data) is carried in the sidebands. In
Chapter 1, you learned about the components of a wave: amplitude, frequency, and
phase.You can ask a question now: For which of these components does the modulation
vary (or change)? The answer is that you can change any of these components and
accordingly there are several modulation techniques or types.

Understanding Modulation Types 
Depending on which component of the wave is changed to encode data, there are dif-
ferent types of modulation, such as amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, and
phase modulation.
Amplitude Modulation 
and Amplitude Shift Keying
Amplitude modulation (AM) is the technique in which the amplitude (peak-to-peak
voltage) of the carrier wave is varied as a function of time in proportion to the strength
of the data signal.As shown in Figure 2.3, the originally constant amplitude of the car-
rier signal rises and falls with each high and low of the data signal.
Figure 2.3 Loading the Data Signal on a Carrier
In its basic form, amplitude modulation produces a signal with power concentrated
at the carrier frequency and in two adjacent sidebands. Each of the two sidebands is
equal in bandwidth to that of the modulating signal and is a mirror image of the other.
This type of AM is called double sideband full carrier (DSBFC), meaning that you use the
full power of both the sidebands and the carrier for transmission.This type is also called
double sideband (DSB). There are two problems with this picture:
1.
Only one of the two identical sidebands is needed; the other one is just a
waste of power.
2.
Half the power is concentrated at the carrier frequency, which carries no
useful information.
The solution to this problem is to suppress the carrier, one of the sidebands, or both.
This gives rise to several types of amplitude modulation:

■
Double-sideband reduced carrier transmission (DSB-RC) This type of
modulation uses full power of both sidebands but reduces the carrier level
(amplitude).To be precise, this is the type of AM achieved by implementing
the following two requirements:
■
The frequencies produced by the modulation are symmetrically spaced
above and below the carrier frequency.
■
The carrier level is reduced for transmission at a ﬁxed level below, which is
below the level of the carrier provided to the modulator.
■
Double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission (DSB-SC) This is a
special case of DSB-RC and is achieved by implementing the following two
requirements:
■
Frequencies produced by amplitude modulation are symmetrically spaced
above and below the carrier frequency.
■
The carrier level is reduced to the lowest practical level; ideally speaking,
it’s completely suppressed.
■
Single-sideband (SSB) This is the type of AM in which only one sideband
and the carrier is used.You can also call it single-sideband full carrier. Note that it
is not necessary to transmit both sidebands: Either one can be suppressed at the
transmitter without any loss of information.The advantages of SSB include
smaller transmitter power, smaller bandwidth (one-half that of a DSB), and less
noise at the receiver.
■
Single-sideband suppressed-carrier (SSB-SC) This is the SSB in which
the carrier is suppressed. Even greater efﬁciency is achieved this way by com-
pletely suppressing both the carrier and sideband.This modulation type is
widely used in amateur radio due to its efﬁcient use of both power and band-
width.
The less power to be transmitted by these AM types results in signiﬁcantly less size,
weight, and peak antenna voltage requirements of the SSB transmitter than those for the
standard AM transmitter.
NOTE
In DSB-RC modulation, the carrier level is selected so that it is suitable for use as
a reference by the receiver, except for the case in which it is reduced to the min-
imum practical level—for example, the carrier is suppressed.

The amplitude modulation is called amplitude shift keying (ASK), when the data
signal is a digital signal.The term keying is the legacy term from the times of teleg-
raphy, when an operator would manually push keys to make short and long tones.The
kind of keying we’re interested in refers to which characteristic of the analog carrier
signal is to be varied to represent the ones and zeros of a digital data signal: amplitude,
frequency, or phase.
ASK varies the amplitude of a carrier signal to represent binary data.The binary
information is transmitted by assigning discrete amplitudes to bit patterns. For example,
Figure 2.4 presents a simple example of ASK by showing the modulated signal cor-
responding to the digital signal that represents the binary number 0011010. Note
that in the modulated signal, the period is the same for the entire signal; only the
amplitude varies. In this example, an amplitude of 1 represents a 0, and the ampli-
tude of 2 represents 1.
Figure 2.4 An Example of Amplitude Shift Keying
You can also encode data into the carrier signal by varying frequency instead of
amplitude.
Frequency Modulation 
and Frequency Shift Keying
Frequency modulation (FM) is the modulation technique that represents information as
variations in the frequency of the carrier wave, whereas in AM, the carrier amplitude is
varied while its frequency remains constant. In analog applications, the carrier frequency

is varied in direct proportion to changes in the amplitude of the data signal, as shown in
Figure 2.5.
Figure 2.5 An Example of Frequency Modulation
If the data signal is a digital signal, the FM technique is called frequency shift keying.
In this case, the digital data is represented by shifting the carrier frequency among a set
of discrete values.
NOTE
FM is most commonly used to transmit signals at VHF, whereas AM is most
commonly used for transmitting audio signals (LF).
So, FSK modulates the frequency of the carrier signal to represent data. The binary
information is transmitted using different frequencies to represent bit patterns: one fre-
quency represents one binary bit and a different frequency represents the other binary
bit. Obviously, these frequencies lie within the bandwidth of the transmission channel.
Figure 2.6 presents a simple example of a modulated signal using FSK.The signal is
representing the binary number 0011010.

If, instead of varying amplitude or frequency, you vary the phase of the carrier wave
to encode data signal, you are using phase modulation.
Phase Modulation and Phase Shift Keying
Phase modulation (PM) is that kind of modulation in which information is represented by
variations in the phase of the carrier wave. Unlike AM and FM, PM is not very widely
used. When the data signal is a digital signal, the corresponding phase modulation tech-
nique is called phase shift keying.
So, phase shift keying is a technique that represents digital data by shifting the period
of the carrier signal.The binary information is transmitted by assigning different phases to
different bit patterns. Figure 2.7 presents a simple example of phase shift keying.

The binary signals can be represented in ways simpler than amplitude shift keying,
frequency shift keying, or phase shift keying.After all, we are only talking about ways to
represent two states: 1 and 0, or on and off.
On-Off Keying (OOK)
On-off keying (OOK) is a type of modulation in which the digital data is represented as
the presence or absence of a carrier wave. For example, the presence of a carrier for a
speciﬁc duration represents a binary one, whereas the absence of the carrier for the same
duration represents a binary zero.This technique is most commonly used to transmit
Morse code over radio frequencies. It has also been used in the industrial, scientiﬁc, and
medical (ISM) radio bands to transfer data between computers. Figure 2.8 presents a
simple example of on-off keying.

NOTE
ISM bands are the bands of radio frequencies originally reserved internationally
for noncommercial use for industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical purposes.
In this section, we explored the techniques to encode data into the carrier signal.
Now the question is: How is the signal carrying the information transferred from the
sender to the receiver?

RFID Communication Techniques
Communication is basically the transfer of information—that is, to send information
from one location and to receive it at another. In the RF world, this is accomplished by
the transfer of energy (which contains the information coded in it) through RF waves.
There are two main communication techniques that the RFID readers and tags use to
communicate with each other.These techniques are coupling and backscattering.
Communication Through Coupling
Coupling, in general, is the transfer of energy from one medium, such as a metallic wire
or an optical ﬁber, to another similar medium. Some examples of coupling include
capacitive (electrostatic) coupling and inductive (magnetic) coupling.
As explained in Chapter 1, inductive coupling is the process of transferring energy
from one circuit to another through a shared magnetic ﬁeld by virtue of the mutual
inductance between the two circuits. Note the following points about inductive coupling:
■
Inductive coupling is used by low-frequency or high-frequency RFID systems.
This way the tag and the reader can use a loop-style coil for an antenna
because the traditional antenna would need to be too long due to the long
wavelengths of the low-frequency waves.
■
Inductive coupling works only in the near ﬁeld of the RF signal.
■
Sometimes inductive coupling is further subdivided into two kinds of coupling:
■
Close coupling within a range of about 1cm
■
Remote coupling within a range of about 1 cm to 1m
The power transfer between the two coils depends on the following quantities:
■
Operating frequency of the system
■
Number of turns/windings in the coils
■
Area enclosed by each coil
■
Angle the coils make with each other; for maximum power transfer, the coils
should be aligned in the same plane
■
Distance between the two coils
The magnetic ﬁeld can be used to transfer energy only within the short range. For
long-range communication, you need to send information through EM waves (radia-
tion).This technique used in RFID systems is called radiative coupling or backscattering.
www.syngress.com
32
Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID

Communication Through Backscattering 
Backscattering is the process of collecting an inbound signal (energy), changing the signal
(the data it carries), and reﬂecting it back to where it came from.The long-range RFID
systems operating at ultra-high frequency (UHF) or microwave frequencies use this
communication technique.The reader sends out the information in the form of an EM
wave at a speciﬁc frequency; the tag receives the wave, encodes the information into the
wave (changes the wave), and scatters it back to the reader.
When you design and install a system, there is always a set of performance require-
ments that could differ from customer to customer.The antenna is an important compo-
nent of an RFID system.Therefore it’s important to understand what constitutes and
affects the performance of an antenna.
Understanding Performance
Characteristics of an RFID System 
Radio devices communicate using antennas for transmitting and receiving the signals.
Just like any other radio device, RFID tags and readers can also communicate with each
other using antennas.The information is encoded into an RF wave and sent to the
antenna through a transmission line. So, antennas play a vital role in an RFID system,
and it is important to understand the characteristics of the transmission line and
antennas that impact the performance.These characteristics are discussed in the fol-
lowing sections.
Cable Loss  
RFID systems typically use 50-Ωcoaxial cable as a transmission line. Cable loss is
the amount of signal power lost in the cable.The longer the cable, the greater the
loss.
Impedance  
Impedance is deﬁned as resistance to the ﬂow of current in a circuit element and is measured
as a ratio of voltage, say V, across the element and current, say I, through the element:
Z =  V/I
The antenna receives power (in terms of current) from the source through the trans-
mission line.The input impedance, Zi, for the antenna is the following:
Zi =  Vi/Ii
www.syngress.com
The Physics of RFID • Chapter 2
33

Vi is the antenna input voltage, and Ii is the antenna input current.
To realize how impedance affects performance, note that the electromagnetic wave
(power) travels through different parts of the antenna system, which can have different
values for impedance.The parts to be considered here are the source that produces the
power, the transmission line that brings the power to the antenna, and the antenna trans-
mitter that transmits the power.The following are the different kinds of impedance
deﬁned in this case:
■
Characteristic impedance This is the impedance of the transmission line,
which is assumed to be lossless and of inﬁnite length:
Z0 =  (µ/ε)1/2
where µ is the magnetic permeability of the medium that makes the trans-
mission line and ε is the electric permeability of the medium.An example of
transmission line is the antenna cable.
■
Antenna input impedance The ratio of the input antenna voltage to the
input antenna current.
■
Transmitter output impedance The impedance used by the antenna’s
transmitter to transmit the power into the free space.
To get the best performance, it is important that all these impedances belonging to
the different parts of an RFID system match with each other. If the antenna input
impedance and the transmitter output impedance match the characteristic impedance of
the transmission line, the antenna will radiate maximum power. However, there is always
some impedance mismatch—for example, due to discontinuities in the transmission line
or if the transmission line is terminated with other than its characteristic impedance.The
impedance mismatch results in reﬂecting part of the wave energy back to the source and
thereby impeding the performance.This phenomenon can be understood in terms of
the voltage standing wave ratio.
The Voltage Standing Wave Ratio
A standing wave, also called a stationary wave, is a result of interference between two waves
moving in the opposite direction. In an RFID system, this situation can arise due to the
impedance mismatch along the transmission line from source to antenna transmitter.The
impedance mismatch will result in reﬂecting part of the energy from the antenna back
to the source, and the forward wave and the reﬂected wave will interfere with each
other.Two cases for this interference are constructive and destructive, respectively:
■
Constructive interference This is the case when the crests of one wave
coincide with the crests of the other wave, and therefore the amplitude of the
resultant wave is the sum of the amplitudes of the interfering waves:
www.syngress.com
34
Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID

Vmax = Vf + Vr 
■
Destructive interference This is the case when the crests of one wave line
up with the troughs of the other wave, and therefore the amplitude of the
resultant wave will be the difference of the amplitudes of the interfering waves:
Vmin = Vf - Vr 
The voltage standing wave ratio, or VSWR, is measured as:
VSWR = Vmax / Vmin   = (Vf + Vr )/( Vf - Vr ) = (1+ Vr/ Vf )/( 1+ Vr/ Vf ) = (
1+ρ)/(1-ρ)
where ρ = Vr/ Vf is the magnitude of what is called the reﬂection coefﬁcient.
A perfect impedance match will result in a VSWR of 1:1, which is practically
impossible. VSWR is always expressed with 1 as the denominator.
EXERCISE 2.2
What is the value of VSWR for a short circuit and for an open circuit?
Solution: In both cases, the VSWR = inﬁnity/1.
So, VSWR is the ratio of maximum voltage to minimum voltage along the trans-
mission line in a standing wave situation.Another characteristic that can affect perfor-
mance is noise.
CAUTION
The impedance and VSWR are considered during the manufacturing process to
produce the desired output according to the standards and regulations. Any
adjustments made to the cable or antenna can cause the change in VSWR and
in the transmitted power and may violate the standards.
Noise
Noise is an unwanted electrical wave (or energy) present in a circuit or a signal. It is
called noise to the signal or a background.The effect of the noise is represented by a
quantity called signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and can be calculated as shown here:
www.syngress.com
The Physics of RFID • Chapter 2
35

SNR = (As/An)2
In this formula, As is the amplitude of the signal wave and An is the amplitude of
the noise wave. SNR is usually represented in decibels:
SNR (dB) = 10 log (As/An)2  = 20 log (As/An)
This equation tells us that when the noise is stronger than the signal, the value of
SNR will be negative, in which case reliable communication is not possible unless we
either increase the signal strength or decrease the noise.
Regardless of how strong the signal is compared to the noise, it’s useless unless the
receiver receives it. Polarization is a characteristic that you should know in this context.
Beamwidth
As shown in Figure 2.9, the beamwidth of an antenna is the angle between the two half-
power points around the point (the main lobe) that has the peak effective radiated
power.
Figure 2.9 An Example of Beamwidth

Side Lobes

EXERCISE 2.3
Show that each of the two half-power points of the beamwidth are 3dB below
the point of maximum radiation.
Solution: By deﬁnition, a half point has half the maximum radiation power.
Therefore, the relative signal strength at a half-point can be expressed in deci-
bels, as in the following:
10 x log(1/2) = –3 dB
Why is beamwidth important? RFID systems are not broadcast systems.A reader
wants to get information from a tag at a speciﬁc location. So, the beam nature (focusing)
of the radiated energy is important from the perspective of performance. We can talk
about this issue in terms of directivity as well.
Directivity
The directivity of an antenna is deﬁned s its ability to focus in a particular direction to
transmit or receive energy. Directivity is calculated as the ratio of the maximum value of
power transmitted (or received) per unit of solid angle to the average power transmitted
(or received) per unit of solid angle.This property is important in an RFID system
because the communication in this case is point to point between a tag and a reader, as
opposed to broadcast, as in the case of FM radio. Directivity is a performance character-
istic in an RFID system because the performance depends on how well the reader and
tag can direct their energy at each other.
NOTE
In an environment of poor directivity, a reader may end up reading a tag out-
side its zone. This is called a phantom read or a ghost read. 
Antenna Gain
Antenna gain is another way of measuring an antenna’s ability to radiate in a speciﬁc
direction. This is measured as a ratio of energy radiated at a point of maximum radia-
tion to energy radiated at the same point by some reference antenna:
Ag = Pout/Pref 
www.syngress.com
The Physics of RFID • Chapter 2
37

One of the theoretical antennas used as a reference is called an isotropic (omnidirec-
tional) antenna—that is, it radiates power uniformly in all directions.Therefore, the
power radiated by the reference antenna can be taken as equal to the input power,
assuming that the antenna is lossless.This would result in the following equation for the
antenna gain:
Ag = Pout/Pin
Antenna gain is usually expressed in decibels:
Ag (dB) = 10 x log(Pout/Pin) 
EXERCISE 2.4
What is the antenna gain when the reference antenna is a dipole antenna?
Solution: With a dipole antenna as a reference, the maximum output
power will be twice the input power. Therefore, the antenna gain can be calcu-
lated as:
Ag (dB) = 10xlog(2/1) = 3 dB
So, antenna gain is important because in an RFID system the power is transmitted
in preferred directions and is not broadcast uniformly in all directions. For example, a
reader wants to direct the power at the tag it wants to read.That’s why directivity and
antenna gain are performance-related characteristics of antennas in RFID systems.
CAUTION
Don’t be misled by the term gain. The overall output (transmitted) power is not
greater than the overall input power. Only the output power in a speciﬁc direc-
tion is greater than some reference power in that direction. In other words, the
antenna does not act as an ampliﬁer.
Before an antenna can transmit power, it receives that power from the source
through a transmission line.The characteristics of that transmission line (or the circuitry)
are also important from the perspective of performance. One of those characteristics is
impedance.

Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID

Polarization
As described in Chapter 1, the polarization of a transverse wave, such as an electromag-
netic wave, refers to the direction of oscillations in the plane perpendicular to the direc-
tion in which the wave travels.The antenna of an RFID system emits electromagnetic
waves into the free space.The polarization of the antenna refers to the direction of oscil-
lations in these waves.
Based on polarization, there are two types of antenna:
■
Linearly polarized antennas Linear polarization is relative to the surface of
the earth. It is of two kinds: horizontally polarized waves travel parallel to the
surface of the earth, whereas vertically polarized waves travel perpendicular to
the surface of the earth.
■
Circularly polarized antennas A circularly polarized wave basically spins as
it travels.
Polarization is a performance characteristic because the readability of the tag greatly
depends on the polarization of the antenna and the angle the tag makes with the reader.
Here is how polarization affects performance:
■
For a maximum transfer of power, the reader and the tag antennas should have
the same polarization.
■
If the transmitting antenna is horizontally polarized and the receiving antenna
is vertically polarized (or vice versa), not much power transfer is going to
happen.
■
If the receiving antenna is circularly polarized, it will receive some radiation,
regardless of the polarization of the transmitting antenna.This is because a cir-
cular polarization has both components of the linear polarization: horizontal
and vertical.
The transmitter emits the energy (which contains the information) at a certain fre-
quency, and the receiver that receives this energy is also tuned to a certain frequency.
The performance can be optimized if the transmitter and the receiver resonate with
each other.
Resonance Frequency
Due to the underlying physics principles, a system absorbs maximum energy when the
frequency of the energy waves matches the system’s own natural frequency, the resonant
frequency. Matching means the system’s frequency is the same as or an integral multiple
of the frequency of the energy that’s being received. For optimal performance, it is
important that the receiving antenna in an RFID system match the frequency of the
incoming ﬁeld—that is, it needs to resonate with the frequency of the incoming ﬁeld.
www.syngress.com
The Physics of RFID • Chapter 2
39

Typically, an antenna is tuned for a speciﬁc frequency that matches the frequency of the
incoming ﬁeld, called resonant frequency or the base frequency.The integral multiples of this
base frequency will also be effective frequencies for the antenna.
For example, if an antenna is tuned for a resonant frequency fr, it will be effective
for frequencies such as 1fr, 2 fr, 3 fr, and 4 fr.. Because frequency is inversely propor-
tional to wavelength, the corresponding effective wavelengths will be λ, λ/2, λ/3, and
λ/4.These wavelengths are also called the electrical length of the antenna and make their
way into the antenna design as the antenna size.
NOTE
The low- and high-frequency tag antennas will need to be very large to res-
onate with the operating frequency. This is why these tags are designed to work
on the principle of inductive coupling.  
All the quantities discussed in this section directly or indirectly refer to the ampli-
tude, voltage, or energy, all of which affect the power an antenna will radiate or absorb.
This is because communication between two radio devices such as a reader and a tag is
carried out by exchanging power between the antennas of the two devices.Therefore,
it’s important to understand the physical quantities related to the power emitted by an
antenna.
Performing Antenna Power Calculations 
To understand an antenna’s performance, it’s important to know how an antenna radiates
power. For example, an isotropic (omnidirectional) antenna radiates power uniformly in
all directions, whereas a directional antenna radiates power in a speciﬁc direction.The
performance of an antenna related to the power it radiates can be understood in terms
of three physical quantities: effective radiated power, power density, and link margin.
Effective Radiated Power
The effective radiated power (ERP) of an antenna in a speciﬁc direction is the power that
will need to be supplied to a reference antenna to produce the same power this antenna
is producing in this direction.Therefore, by deﬁnition of antenna gain, the ERP can be
written as:
ERP = Pt x Ag
where Ag is the antenna gain and Pt is the total power transmitted by the antenna,
which can be expressed in the following equation:
www.syngress.com
40
Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID

Pt =  RF power – cable loss
EXERCISE 2.5
The ERP of an antenna system is 100,000 watts, and the antenna gain is 7 dB.
How much total power does the antenna actually transmit?
Solution:
Ag = 10 x log(ERP/Pt) = 7 dB
Therefore:
ERP/Pt = 10 0.7  = 5 =>   Pt = ERP/5 = 20, 000 Watts
NOTE
Sometimes in the literature, you will come across the term equivalent isotropic
radiated power (EIRP). This term refers to the effective radiated power calcu-
lated by using the antenna gain, which was computed using the isotropic
antenna as the reference antenna. In this case,  ERP will be the effective radi-
ated power calculated by using the antenna gain. which was computed by
using the half-wave dipole antenna as the reference antenna. The relationship
between EIRP and ERP can be shown by the following equation:
EIRP (W)  = 1.64 x ERP (W) 
This equation assumes a lossless transmission line between the transmitter
and the antenna.
After power is transmitted by an antenna, it spreads out into the space.Therefore, the
power density (power per unit space) is an important quantity.
Power Density
An EM wave transmitted from an antenna travels in all directions in the form of an
expanding spherical wavefront.The power density can be looked upon as the power of this
wave per unit of surface area of the sphere.The surface area of a sphere with radius R is
4πR2.Therefore, the power density, Pd, at a distance R from the transmitter antenna can
be calculated using the following formula:
Pd = Pt/(4πR2)
www.syngress.com
The Physics of RFID • Chapter 2
41

Pt is the total power radiated by the antenna.This formula works for the power
being emitted by an isotropic antenna. If the antenna is a directional antenna, we need
to take into account the antenna gain, and the formula used to calculate the power den-
sity is as follows:
Pd =  ERP/(4πR2)  = (Pt x Ag)/(4πR2)
Once the antenna has radiated energy, bad things, in addition to the natural
spreading out, can happen to it while it’s on its way to the destination. For example, it
may be absorbed or reﬂected back by some materials on its way. ERP does not account
for what happens to the energy wave on its way to the destination and how it is
received by the receiving antenna. However, the overall system performance depends on
how much power is being transferred between the transmitter and the receiver.The
quantity that includes the travel and the receiving part of communication is called link
margin.
Link Margin
Link margin quantiﬁes the performance of the overall RFID communication system,
including the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna.The link margin, Lm, can
be deﬁned as:
Lm =  (ERPr/Pmin) = (ERPt x Arg)/Pmin = (Pt x Atg x Arg)/Pmin 
Lm (dB) = 10 x log ((Pt x Atg x Arg)/Pmin ) = 10 x (log Pt  + log Atg + log Arg – log
Pmin)
where:
Pt = Transmitted power
Atg =  Gain for transmitter antenna
Arg = Gain for receiving antenna
Pmin = Minimum received signal strength
Looking at this equation, you can realize that link margin is the ratio of the max-
imum effective signal strength received to the minimum signal strength received. In
RFID, it means the amount of power that a tag can extract from the RF signal before
the communication between the tag and the reader weakens.
So, the link margin takes into account the impacts of both the transmitting antenna
and the receiving antenna. It also includes the factor of minimum received signal
strength.The received signal strength varies and is less than the transmitted signal
strength due the interaction of the signal with the medium through which it travels.

Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID

The Travel Adventures of RF Waves 
When an RF wave travels from the transmitter to the receiver, it can be affected by var-
ious factors discussed in the following sections.
Absorption
When an RF wave strikes a material object, some of its energy will be absorbed by the
object, depending on the frequency of the wave and the material of the object. Water
and objects containing water, such as liquid products, wood, and food, are especially
good at absorbing RF waves. UHF waves, due to their shorter wavelengths, are more
susceptible to absorption than LF and HF waves.
Attenuation
Attenuation in general means a decrease in the amount of something. In RF physics, it
means the decrease in amplitude (strength) of the RF signal (wave).Attenuation is the
opposite of ampliﬁcation. It can occur when the signal is traveling from the source to
the antenna through the transmission line or during propagation from the transmitter
antenna to the receiver antenna. It can occur due to a number of reasons, such as
absorption and dispersion.
Dielectric Effects
Dielectric effects refer to a medium’s capacity to retain charge.As a result, an electromag-
netic wave traveling through a dielectric medium is slowed down.The strength of this
effect is measured by a quantity called the dielectric constant whose value is different for
different materials. Dielectric effects also detune the signal—that is, shift its frequency to
a value that is not in resonance with the frequency for which the antenna is tuned.
Diffraction
Diffraction refers to the bending of an EM wave when it strikes the sharp edges or when
it passes through narrow gaps. Due to diffraction, the receiver antenna will not receive
the wave energy that it would have otherwise.
Free Space Loss
If the space through which the RF wave travels is free of all obstructing material and as
a result there are no affects such as absorption, reﬂection, refraction, and scattering, there
will still be some loss in signal strength, called free space loss (FSL).This loss occurs simply
due to the way a wave travels.An RF wave transmitted from a source travels in all direc-
tions in the form of an expanding sphere (called a wavefront), and therefore the power
density (power per unit of surface area of this sphere) decreases as a result of this
spreading out. If R is the distance from the transmitter antenna, the surface area of the
www.syngress.com
The Physics of RFID • Chapter 2
43

sphere with radius R around the antenna is 4πR2.Therefore, the power density (and
hence the signal strength) of a propagating wave at a point in space is inversely propor-
tional to the square of distance of this point from the transmitter antenna. In other
words, the free space loss will be directly proportional to the square of this distance. In
addition, the loss is inversely proportional to the square of the wavelength of the propa-
gating wave.
The FSL is measured using the following equation:
FSL =  (4πRk/λ)2
FSL (dB) = 10 log (4πRk/ λ)2  =  10 log (4πRfk/ c)2  = 20 log (4πk/c) +
20 log R + 20 log 
f =>
FSL (dB) = 20 log R + 20 log λ + K
where:
K =  20 log (4πk/c) and k is a constant that depends on the communication link
and the units used for distance and wavelength.
EXERCISE 2.6
Assume that the value of the constant K is –147.5 when the frequency is mea-
sured in Hz, d is measured in meters, and the isotropic antennas are used for
the communication link. What is free space loss for a 950 MHz signal at 1000
meters from the transmitter antenna?
Solution:
f = 950 x 10 6 1/sec 
d = 1000 m
K = –147.5
FSL (dB) = 20 log R + 20 log λ + K = 20 log (1000) + 20 log (950 x 10 6)
- 147.5
= 60 + 2- (8.98) - 147.5 = 60 + 179.60 - 147.5 = 217.5 = 92.1
FSL = 92.1 dB
Interference
Interference is the interaction between two waves.The signal wave can interact with other
waves that it meets on the way to its destination.A resultant wave is produced as a result
www.syngress.com
44
Chapter 2 • The Physics of RFID

of interference, and the receiver receives the resultant wave.The interference can be con-
structive, in which case the resultant wave has a larger amplitude, or destructive, in
which case the resultant wave has a smaller amplitude than the original wave.
Reﬂection
Reﬂection is the abrupt change in direction of a wavefront at an interface between two
dissimilar media so that the wavefront returns into the medium from which it hit the
interface. Radio waves are reﬂected when they strike objects much larger than the wave,
such as ﬂoor, ceiling, and support beam. Metals are obstructions to the signal because
they are good at reﬂecting RFID waves.
Refraction
Refraction is the change in direction of a wavefront at an interface between two dissimilar
media, but the wavefront does not return to the medium from which it hit the interface.
In other words, the radio waves bend when they pass from one medium into another.
Figure 2.10 illustrates reﬂection and refraction.

Scattering
Scattering is the phenomenon of absorbing a wave and reradiating it, thereby changing its
direction. For example, reﬂection of an EM wave is actually a scattering. When a RF
wave is scattered, it results in the loss of the signal or dispersion of the wave, as shown in
Figure 2.11. It happens due to the interaction of the wave with the medium at the
molecular level.
Figure 2.11 An Example of Scattering
The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■
The source encodes data (information) into the carrier signal using a modula-
tion technique and sends it to the antenna through a transmission line.The
input antenna impedance must match with the characteristic impedance of the
transmission line to achieve optimal results.
■
The antenna transmits the modulated carrier signal (carrying the information)
into the free space.The polarizations and orientations of the transmitting and
receiving antennas should be consistent with each other to maximize energy
transfer.
■
The hazards on the way from transmitting antenna to receiving antenna may
affect the communication in a negative way.These hazards either weaken the
wave by, for example, absorbing its energy or change its direction by, for
example, reﬂecting it.

Summary 
The readers and tags in an RFID system communicate with each other through RF
waves. Encoding the data (to be communicated) into an RF wave (carrier signal), the
emission of the RF wave by antennas, and the propagation of the RF waves between the
antennas are governed by underlying physics principles.The data is encoded into the RF
wave using modulation techniques. From performance viewpoint, there are two main
factors in the RFID communication: the strength of the signal and the direction of the
signal. In other words, you must understand all the characteristics that result in either the
loss of power in the signal or the change of direction of the signal. For example, cable
loss, impedance, and voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) are important factors that
affect how strong a signal antenna gets from the source through the transmission line.
Because readers are directing their signal at the tags, the antennas used in RFID systems
are directional antennas.Therefore, directivity, antenna gain, and polarization are impor-
tant physical quantities that impact the performance of antennas.
Once the antenna radiates the RF waves into the free space, performance indicates
how intact it will reach its destination.This part of the performance depends on factors
such as absorption, reﬂection, refraction, and scattering. Water is a good absorber, and
metals are good reﬂectors. RFID systems typically use two kinds of communication
technique: inductive coupling to communicate within the near ﬁeld and backscattering
to communicate in the far ﬁeld. Inductive coupling is used by RFID systems operating
at LF and HF because the high wavelengths corresponding to these high frequencies
will require ridiculously large antennas.
Most of the physics behind RFID relates to how readers and tags communicate with
each other. In the next chapter, we discuss tags in greater detail.
Exam’s Eye View
Comprehend
 Inductive coupling is the process of transferring energy from one circuit to
another through a shared magnetic ﬁeld by virtue of the mutual inductance
between the two circuits.
 Backscattering is the process of collecting inbound signal (energy), changing
the signal (the data it carries), and reﬂecting it back to where it came from.

 Inductive coupling is used by LF or HF RFID systems, whereas backscattering
is used by long-range RFID systems operating at UHF or microwave
frequencies.
 For a maximum transfer of power, the reader and the tag antennas should have
the same polarization.
 If the receiving antenna is circularly polarized, it will receive some radiation
regardless of the polarization of the transmitting antenna.This is because a
circular polarization has both components of the linear polarization: horizontal
and vertical.
Look out
 Inductive coupling works only in the near ﬁeld of the RF signal.
 RFID systems operating at LF or HF use inductive couplings because it’s not
practical to use antennas for transmitting (or receiving) EM waves in this
frequency range: low frequency means high wavelength, which requires very
large antennas.
 If the transmitting antenna is horizontally polarized and the receiving antenna
is vertically polarized (or vice versa), not much power transfer is going to
happen.
 The UHF waves, due to their shorter wavelengths, are more susceptible to
absorption than LF and HF waves.
Memorize
 In an environment of poor directivity, a reader may end up reading a tag
outside its zone.This is called a phantom read or a ghost read.
 Water and the objects containing water such as liquid products, wood, and
food are especially good at absorbing RF waves.
 Metals are good at reﬂecting RF waves.
 Diffraction is caused by sharp edges and narrow gaps such as slits.

Introduction
The items that you need to identify and track are tagged with, well, tags. So, a tag is the
“better half” of the RFID system because it contains information about the item to
which it is attached and has the capability to provide that information on request.A tag
makes it to the item in three steps:The tag with the basic functionality is manufactured,
the tag is turned into a label, and the label is placed on the item. From your perspective,
this process involves the following facts:
■
All the tags are composed of the same basic components because they offer the
same basic functionality: to help identify and track an item.
■
To meet the varied needs of different applications, tags come in different
forms, shapes, and sizes.
■
Tags must be properly placed on items so that they could be easily read by
readers.
So, the main goal of this chapter is to understand the role of a tag in an RFID
system.To accomplish this goal, we will explore three avenues: tag components, tag
types, and tag placement.
Understanding Tags
Generally speaking, RFID is a means to identify an object using radio frequency trans-
mission, which suggests that communication is involved in the identiﬁcation process.
The communication takes place between a reader and a tag.A tag, attached to an item
that needs to be tracked, contains identiﬁcation and possibly more information about
the item. For example, in a supply-chain system, a tag may contain the following infor-
mation about an item: source, destination, and route.
You need to know what makes a tag—that is, its components—and what it looks
like, including its size and shape.
Components of a Tag
The components of a tag are there to support its functionality by:
■
Storing the information about an item
■
Processing the request for information coming in from a reader
■
Preparing and sending the response to the request
To support this functionality, a tag, as shown in Figure 3.1, consists of the following
three main components:
56
Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags
www.syngress.com

■
Chip  The chip is used to generate or process a signal. It’s an integrated circuit
(IC) made of silicon.The chip consists of the following functional compo-
nents:
■
Logical unit Implements the communication protocol used for tag-
reader communication.
■
Memory Used to store data (information).
■
Modulator Used for modulating the outgoing signals and demodulating
the incoming signals.
■
Power controller Converts the AC power from the incoming signal to
DC power and supplies power to the components of the chip.
The chip is connected to the antenna so that it can send the outbound
signal to the antenna and can receive the inbound signal from the antenna.
■
Antenna  In an RFID system, a tag’s antenna receives the signal (a request for
information) from a reader and transmits a response signal (identiﬁcation infor-
mation) back to the reader. It’s made of metal or a metal-based material. Both
readers and tags have their own antennas.You learned about antennas in
Chapters 1 and 2, and you will learn more details about them in Chapter 6. In
this chapter, it is sufﬁcient to know that a tag’s antenna radiates and receives
radio waves to transmit and receive a radio signal. Furthermore, note the fol-
lowing two points:
■
The antennas are usually used by tags (and readers as well) operating at
UHF and microwave frequencies.
■
The tags (and readers) operating at LF and HF use inductive coils (as
antennas) to send and receive signals in the inductive coupling communi-
cation technique.As you know from Chapter 2, the size of a traditional
antenna for sending or receiving an LF signal would need to be ridicu-
lously high due to the high wavelengths of these signals.
Both the chip and antenna are housed on a substrate.
CAUTION
Note two important points: Both readers and tags have antennas, and a tag
(and a reader) that uses inductive coupling as its communication technique uses
an inductive coil for an antenna instead of a standard antenna. 
Working with RFID Tags • Chapter 3
57

Figure 3.1 Components of a Tag
■
Substrate This is the layer that houses the chip and the antenna. In other
words, it’s the support structure for the tag. Substrates can be made of different
materials such as plastic, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), paper, and glass
epoxy. Substrate material can be rigid or ﬂexible, depending on the usage
requirements.
Substrates for RFID tags are designed to meet speciﬁc usage requirements
such as the following:
■
Dissipation of static charge buildup
■
Durability under speciﬁc operating conditions
■
Mechanical protection for chip, antenna, and connections
■
Smooth printing surface
So, a tag consists of a chip and an antenna housed on a substrate. Now this thing is
going to be attached to an item, so a natural question to ask is: How big is a tag? In
other words, depending on the item to which a tag will be applied, tag size matters.
Tag Size
The preferred tag size might depend on the item on which the tag will be applied and
the environment in which the item exists.To meet the varied requirements of different
applications, tags come in various shapes and sizes. Here are some examples:

■
Large tags that are several inches in length, width, and height can be used to
track large objects such as vehicles like trucks and rail cars.
■
Rectangular shaped tags can be used as antitheft devices.
■
Thin tags can be applied under a paper or plastic label on individual items
such as books or packages such as boxes.
■
Screw-shaped tags can mark and track speciﬁc trees.
■
Inserting tags the size of a pencil lead (less than half an inch in length) under
the skin can help track animals.
The smallness of a tag is limited by the antenna size.To select the right tag for a
given environment, you must understand the tag types and operating frequencies.
Operating Tag Frequencies
To respond to readers, tags use radio waves, which are basically the electromagnetic
waves covering part of the electromagnetic spectrum of frequencies called radio frequency
spectrum. Because the RFID systems generate and radiate the electromagnetic waves that
fall in the radio frequency spectrum, they are justiﬁably classiﬁed as radio systems.
However, other radio services have been operating before the arrival of RFID systems.
Radio, television, mobile radio services (police, security services, and industry), marine
and aeronautical radio services, and mobile telephones are a few.Therefore, it is impor-
tant to ensure that these services are not disrupted or impaired by the RFID new-
comers.This requirement signiﬁcantly restricts the suitable operating frequency ranges
available for RFID systems.Therefore, the so-called industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical
(ISM) frequencies, originally reserved for noncommercial uses in industrial, scientiﬁc,
and medical ﬁelds, are generally used for RFID systems.
Table 3.1 shows the radio frequency ranges that are of interest to RFID systems,
along with the ISM frequencies. RFID systems use many different frequencies in the
radio frequency spectrum, but there are four most commonly used radio frequency
ranges: low frequency (30–300 KHz), high frequency (3–30 MHz), ultrahigh frequency
(300 MHz–3 GHz), and microwave frequencies (1 GHz–300 GHz).

Table 3.1 also shows the read ranges for a passive tag (a tag that does not have its
own source of power, such as battery) corresponding to each frequency range.An active
tag (a tag that has a battery) can have a read range of up to 100 meters. For example,
active tags used on large assets such as cargo containers, rail cars, and large reusable con-
tainers, which usually operate at 455 MHz, 2.45 GHz, or 5.8 GHz, typically have a read
range of 20 meters to 100 meters.
Note that the read range performance improves with the increase in the frequency.
However, for a given frequency, the read range also depends on other factors, such as the
maximum power the antenna is allowed to transmit, the communication technique
being used, and the tag type.
CAUTION
For a given frequency, tag type, and communication technique, the practical
read distance of a tag also depends on other factors such as the regulated max-
imum radiated power and antenna size.
RFID systems operating in the LF and HF ranges typically use the same frequencies
all over the world, as shown in Table 3.1, but there is no global agreement on which fre-
quencies should be used for RFID systems operating in the UHF range.As shown in
Table 3.2, different UFH frequency bands are allocated to the RFID systems in different
regions of the world.

This section mentioned active tags and passive tags. What are they? Let’s take a look.
Understanding Tag Types
The two major characteristics that determine the performance and use of a tag are the
tag type and the frequency at which the tag operates.The tag types are determined by
the following two factors:
■
Can the tag initiate the communication?
■
Does the tag have its own power source?
Based on different combinations of answers to these two questions, there are three
types of tags: passive, semipassive, and active.
Passive Tags
A passive tag is a tag that does not have its own power source, such as a battery, and
therefore cannot initiate the communication. It responds to the signal sent by the reader
by taking power from the reader’s signal. In other words, the reader’s signal wakes up the
passive tag. Here is how it works:
1.
The passive tag’s antenna (or coil) receives the signal from the reader.
2.
The antenna sends the signal to the IC.
3.
Part of the signal power is used to power up the IC.
4.
The IC powers up, processes the incoming signal, and sends the response.
The characteristics of a passive tag include the following:
www.syngress.com
Working with RFID Tags • Chapter 3
61

■
Placement Because a passive tag entirely depends on the reader for its power,
it must be inside the interrogation zone to get enough power to generate a
response.
■
Size and range Because there is no battery, passive tags tend to be smaller in
size and have a shorter read range compared to active tags.
■
Lifespan Because there is no need to replace a battery, passive tags have a
longer life.
■
Memory The memory capacity of passive tags varies from 1 bit to several
kilobytes.
Remember the following about passive tags:
■
Passive tags can operate at any of these frequency ranges: LF, HF, and UHF.
■
Depending on the frequency range at which a passive tag is operating, a passive
tag may have a read range from 2 millimeters to about 5 meters.
■
The passive tags are simpler and cheaper and therefore more popular.
■
LF passive tags are ideal for applications that require reading from a close
range.
CAUTION
It’s very easy for a beginner to fall into the trap of thinking that passive tags
operate only at low frequencies and have a very short read range. At least from
the exam’s perspective, you should burn a term into your head: UHF passive
tags.
So, the deﬁning characteristic of a passive tag is that it does not initiate communica-
tion. If a tag does have a battery but does not initiate communication, it is still a passive
tag, but it’s called a semipassive tag.
Semipassive Tags
A semipassive tag is a tag that has its own power source such as a battery but does not ini-
tiate communication. It responds to the signal sent by the reader by taking power from
the reader’s signal. In other words, the reader’s signal wakes up the passive tag.A passive
tag uses its battery to run its circuitry.The characteristics of a semipassive tag include the
following:
www.syngress.com
62
Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags

■
Operation Because a semipassive tag can transmit a response signal only if it
gets adequate power from the reader, its operating principle is very similar to
that of a passive tag.
■
Size and range Because a semipassive tag has its own battery, it is larger than
the passive tag. For the same reason, it can produce a stronger signal, which can
transmit across a longer distance, resulting in a larger read range compared to a
passive tag.
■
Lifespan A semipassive tag has a shorter life (tied to battery) than a passive
tag.
■
Memory The memory capacity of a semipassive tag varies and can be greater
than that of a passive tag, partly due to its larger size (more room for compo-
nents) and battery.
In a nutshell, a semipassive tag uses a battery to run the circuitry but still does not
initiate communication because it still uses the power from the incoming signal to pre-
pare the response.
So, on one end of the spectrum is the passive tag that contains no battery and
cannot initiate communication. In the middle is the semipassive tag that has a battery
but does not initiate communication. On the other end of the spectrum is the tag type
that contains the battery and can initiate communication; this tag is called an active tag.
Active Tags
An active tag is a tag that has its own power source such as a battery and can initiate
communication by sending its own signal. It does not rely on the power from the reader
to run its circuitry or to create the signal. It does not need a wakeup call from the
reader.The characteristics of an active tag include the following:
■
Operation Because an active tags has its own power source, it has the choice
of staying up all the time or waking up when a signal is received.A tag that is
operating all the time can broadcast its location at predetermined intervals.
■
Size  Because of their power sources (batteries), active tags are the largest in
size. Typical sizes are (1.5 x 3) x 0.5 inch3. However, with the advancement of
technology, the smallest active tags could be the size of a coin.
■
Read range Because an active tag has its own power source for circuitry and
for generating signals, it can achieve the greatest read range. Some active tags
have the ability to send a signal across a distance of 1 km. However, conﬁned
to standards and regulations, many active tags have read ranges of tens of
meters. Due to its larger read range, an active tag can be integrated with a
global positioning system (GPS) to pinpoint the exact location of an object.

■
Lifespan Finite but long enough battery lifetime. It can be as long as 10
years.
■
Memory The memory capacity of passive tags varies and can be greater than
that of passive and semipassive tags, partly due their larger size (more room for
components) and batteries.
Active tags can be used to track high-value assets such as rail cars and cargo con-
tainers that need to be read from large distances. Because active tags have the ability to
initiate communication, they can be further divided into two subtypes:
■
Active transponders These tags are activated only when they receive a signal
from a reader.This way the tags prolong their battery life.These tags can be
used in applications such as toll collection systems and checkpoint control sys-
tems.
■
Beacons A beacon is a tag that emits a signal at predetermined intervals.
Beacons are mostly used in real-time locating systems (RTLS). Possible applica-
tions for beacons include the following:
■
Tracking parts in large manufacturing facilities
■
Marine and aircraft rescue operations
NOTE
Active tags usually operate in the UHF and microwave frequency ranges (455
MHz, 2.45 GHz, and 5.8 GHz) and have read ranges from 20 to 100 meters.
EXERCISE 3.1
Describe how an active tag can work in a toll collection system.
Solution: An active tag is attached to a car. As the car approaches a toll
booth, a reader installed at the booth sends out a signal to the approaching
tag. The tag responds by sending back a signal that contains the tag ID and
possibly other information.

EXERCISE 3.2
Describe how a beacon can be used in a ship rescue operation. 
Solution: A beacon is attached to a ship and is emitting signals at preset
intervals. These signals contain the information about the ship. Using this infor-
mation, satellites or other sensor systems can track down the ship. 
The characteristics of passive, semipassive, and active tags are summed up in Table 3.3.

NOTE
Passive tags are simple and less expensive. UHF provides the greater read range.
To get the best of the both worlds, companies are increasingly becoming inter-
ested in using UHF passive tags, especially in the supply chain. For example,
consider a warehouse in which a reader must be able to read a tag from about
3 meters distance. The LF and HF tags would need to be read from much closer
distances; therefore, the reader begins to interfere with the normal operation of
equipment such as forklifts.  
So, the tag types categorize the tags from the communication perspective—that is,
whether a tag can initiate communication and whether the tag has its own power to
generate the communication signal.As tag technology progresses, other ways of catego-
rizing tag types are developing. One of them is categorization by class, which is largely
based on memory design.
Tag Classiﬁcation
As you know by now, tags are data holders that are attached or afﬁxed to an object and
carry that object’s data, including its identiﬁcation number.These numbers are also called
electronic product codes (EPCs), and the tags containing them are called EPC tags.The
complexity of an EPC tag varies depending on its functionality—how it communicates
and whether or not it has a power source of its own.
NOTE
The EPC is a group of coding schemes for tags deﬁned by the standard called
Generation 2. These coding schemes are designed to meet the wide spectrum
of needs of various industries while guaranteeing uniqueness of codes for all
tags that comply with the standard. The EPC was originally the creation of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID Center, a consortium of
over 120 corporations and university research labs. 
The increased functionality and therefore complexity of tags results in increased cost
because tags with advanced functions require more expensive microchips and their own
power source.Although most business sectors require only the simplest and therefore
lowest-cost tags, the potential value of complex tags justiﬁes their increased cost in cer-
tain industries. For example, think of the food industry, which might want to add tem-
perature tracking by adding a temperature sensor on tags attached to food items in
www.syngress.com

Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags

containers.To accommodate varying levels of complexity, MIT’s Auto-ID Center pro-
posed six tag classes, presented in Figure 3.2.As illustrated in the ﬁgure, each class is a
subset of the functionality contained within the higher class.
Figure 3.2 Classes of Tags
These tag classes are discussed in the following sections.
Class 0 Tags
A class 0 tag is a simple, passive, and read-only tag that is programmed with a unique
EPC number during manufacturing.These tags cannot be programmed by users in the
ﬁeld. Being UFS based and low cost, these tags are suitable for applications that need to
detect only the tag’s presence and not any other data, such as antitheft devices.A class 0
tag must have the following elements:
■

identify the product.

■
EPC number This number is assigned by the manufacturer to identify the
speciﬁc object to which the tag is attached.This is also called an object ID
(OID).
■
A kill function  This can be used to disable the tag permanently.
Class 0+ tags are essentially the same as class 0 tags, with only one difference:You
can write to class 0+ in the ﬁeld, but only once. Both class 0 and class 0+ tags are pas-
sive tags—that is, they do not have a power source of their own, and as a result they can
only be woken up by a signal from the reader.
Class 1 Tags
A class 1 tag is a simple, passive, read and write-once, backscatter tag. It has a one-time,
ﬁeld-programmable, nonvolatile memory.The tag is manufactured with no data written
into the memory. However, because it’s a write once/read-only memory (WORM) tag,
the data can be written (once) either by the manufacturer before shipping or by the user
in the ﬁeld.The tags in this class have the following characteristics:
■
Passive Cannot initiate communication and do not have their own power
source.
■
Memory Have 128-bit memory: 96 bits for storing identiﬁcation and 32 bits
for error correction and kill function.
■
Write-once, read-only memory (WORM) Can be programmed by the
manufacturer or by the user in the ﬁeld, but only once.
Class 2 Tags
A class 2 tag is also a passive backscatter tag like class 0 and class 1 tags, but it’s very ﬂex-
ible when it comes to memory. It has the following characteristics:
■
Passive Cannot initiate communication and does not have its own power
source.
■
Memory Up to 65 KB of read/write memory.
■
Authenticated access control
Class 2 tags are typically used to log data and therefore contain more memory than
just what’s needed to store identiﬁcation. Class 1 and 2 tags have become popular
among the majority of RFID applications. However, for certain applications with diverse
requirements, you need class 3 tags.
www.syngress.com
68
Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags

Class 3 Tags
A class 3 tag is a semipassive backscatter tag that has onboard sensors. It has the following
characteristics:
■
Semipassive Cannot initiate communication but has its own power source to
generate signals. Remains passive until activated by a reader signal.
■
Memory Up to 65 KB of read/write memory.
■
Integrated sensor circuitry
A class 3 tag with a built-in battery supports increased read range.The built-in
memory also supports sensor recording parameters such as temperature, pressure, and
motion into the memory without the power from the reader’s signal.These tags can be
used in supply chain applications such as on pallets and containers, to provide historical
information.
Class 0, 1, and 2 tags are passive tags, whereas class 3 tags are semipassive.That means
none of these tags can initiate communication, and they all take power from the reader’s
signal to generate a response signal.The needs of some applications may require the tag
to use its own power source to generate signals and to be able to initiate communica-
tion.These requirements are met by class 4 and 5 tags.
Class 4 Tags
A class 4 tag is an active tag with integrated transmitter. It uses a built-in battery to run
the microchip’s circuitry and to power the transmitter to broadcast the signal to a reader.
It has the following characteristics:
■
Active It can initiate communication because it has its own power source to
run the circuitry and to generate the signal.
■
Memory Rewritable.
■
Communication Ability to communicate with other tags.
■
Networking Ad hoc networking capabilities.
The class 4 tags can be used in applications such as parents keeping track of their
children in an amusement park, a tag inside a cargo container passing information from
other tags to an external reader (networking), and tags working with GPSs to track
objects globally.
Class 5 Tags
A class 5 tag is an active RFID tag that has the capability of communicating with other
class 5 tags and other devices. Its capabilities include all the capabilities of a class 4 tag.
The only additional functionality that a class 5 tag has over a class 4 tag is its ability to
www.syngress.com
Working with RFID Tags • Chapter 3
69

initiate communication with all classes of tags.That means it can initiate communication
with a passive tag as well by waking up the tag. Due to this reader functionality, a class 5
tag is also called a reader tag.
All these classes of tags are summarized in Table 3.4.

Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags

So, tags are classiﬁed to be manufactured with varied levels of features, capabilities,
and resulting complexity.As Table 3.4 depicts, each higher-class tag offers all the features
and capabilities of the lower-class tags and more.
A common core functionality of all kinds of tag is that they can be read by readers.
The maximum distance from which a tag can be read is called its read range. We need to
take a close look at tags’ read ranges.
Read Ranges of Tags
The need for read range of a tag generally corresponds to the application requirement.
In other words, the read range of a tag plays an important role in determining which
application will use this tag. For example, in a warehouse, a reader must be able to read
tags from a distance of a few meters, say about 3 meters, at least. Otherwise, it will start
interfering with the normal operation of equipment such as forklifts.
From the physics perspective, where does the read range come from? As shown in
Figure 3.3, it is mainly determined by the following four characteristics:
■
Operating frequency 
■
The maximum allowed power emission
■
Tag type: active or passive
■
Communication technique: inductive coupling or backscattering

You have already seen in this chapter how the read range depends on the tag type
and the operating frequency.The maximum allowed power that an antenna can emit
comes from standards and regulations.The higher the power, the larger the read range.
The read range also depends on which of the following two communication techniques
your RFID system is using:
■
Inductive coupling You learned about inductive coupling in Chapter 2.The
reader and the tag use coils as antennas.These coils create magnetic ﬁelds.The
variations in the magnetic ﬁeld are used to transfer power (and data) between
the reader and the tag. In technical terms, the energy is transferred between
two circuits (tag and reader) by virtue of the mutual inductance between the
circuits.This technique limits the read range because it only works in the near
ﬁeld of the coils.Therefore, inductive coupling requires that the reader be close
to the tag.This leads to a read range of about 30 cm for LF tags to 1 meter for
HF tags.
■
Backscattering Also called backscatter coupling, this concept was also discussed
in Chapter 2. Backscattering is typically used by UHF passive tags. Because
backscattering works beyond the near ﬁeld, it allows larger read ranges. For
example, the read range of a UHF passive tag using backscattering can be
larger than 3 meters.
So far, we have discussed tags from the perspectives of the functionality and the fea-
tures offered by them. But before you can use these tags, they need to be changed to
some kind of labels and placed on the items that that need to be identiﬁed and tracked.
Labeling and Placing a Tag 
Tags are placed on the items that need to be identiﬁed and tracked. Before you can
place a tag, that is, attach a tag to an item, it needs to be in a form so that it can be con-
veniently attached to the item. Creating that form is called labeling the tag. In other
words, to tag an item is a three-step process:
■
Manufacture the tag (a combination of IC, antenna, and substrate).
■
Label the tag—that is, convert the tag into some kind of label.
■
Place the label on the item that needs to be tracked.
Labeling a Tag
The basic functionality of all tags is the same, and therefore the basic components are
also the same: chip, antenna, and substrate. However, a tag needs to be converted into a
form in which it can be conveniently attached to an item. What form (e.g., size and
shape) a tag will take depends on the following factors:
www.syngress.com
72
Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags

■
The characteristics, such as the material of the item to which the tag is to be
attached
■
The environment around the item
Therefore, labeling a tag depends on its application, such as where and how it will
be placed.Accordingly, tags are manufactured and turned into usable forms in various
shapes and sizes. In other words, RFID tags are available in various media conﬁgurations.
Your selection depends on the application requirements.This has given rise to different
kinds of tags and terms that you should be aware of. Some of them are discussed in the
following sections.
Inlay
The inlay is the bare-bones tag discussed in this chapter so far—that is, the combination
of antenna, chip, and substrate.The inlay needs to be packaged (labeled) before use.
Insert
An insert is an inlay inserted between a label in the front and an adhesive layer in the
back.The adhesive in the back can be permanently mounted, for example, on the inner
wall of a tire. RFID inserts are available in different sizes depending on the applications
in which they will be used. Here are some examples:
■
Thick inserts intended to be used in harsh environments
■
Paper-thin inserts in a pressure-sensitive environment, used, for example, to
track parcels
■
Postage stamp-sized inserts applied to videocassettes
Smart Labels
A smart label is a barcode label that has an embedded RFID tag inside it.You can print
human-readable, useful information on the label face, such as sender’s address, destination
address, and product information.A smart label has the following components:
■
Inlay IC, antenna, and substrate
■
Label face stock Covers the top of the inlay and provides area for printing
human-readable information.
■
Adhesive  Used to attach the face stock to the inlay.
■
Release liner  Covers the bottom of the inlay. This layer can be used to con-
vert the pressure-sensitive inlay into rolls for easy and safe distribution.This
layer can later be removed to place the smart label on an item.
www.syngress.com
Working with RFID Tags • Chapter 3
73

Smart labels are designed to withstand a number of hazards such as extreme temper-
ature, chemicals, moisture, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation.
Pressure-Sensitive Labels
Pressure-sensitive labels are used in RFID-enabled media and are basically the same as
smart labels.A tag can also be inserted into an envelope, which can be attached to the
face stock and coated with an adhesive for placement.
RFID-Enabled Tickets
RFID-enabled tickets are inserted into paper or plastic envelopes that are directly attached
to the items that need to be identiﬁed.The paper or plastic material used for these
envelopes should be ultraviolet-resistant—that is, transparent to UHF waves. Several
types of  polypropylene, polyester, polyethylene, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
ﬁlms are good selections and offer low attenuation for UHF waves.
Tie-On Tags
Tie-on tags are basically RFID-enabled tickets that are attached with a tie-on.These tags
are usually used on nonconveyable items. However, you must consider that a tie-on
made of a conductive wire may positively or negatively affect tag performance.
TIP
Avoid polyvinyl chloride (PVC) ﬁlms with tags that use copper antennas because
they run the risk of long-term antenna corrosion. 
So, generally speaking, a label is any kind of tag attached to an item by an adhesive
with the purpose of identifying the item. Labels come in many forms and can be differ-
entiated by the type of base material, called stock, on which you can print, and by the
adhesive type that they use.
Selecting Adhesive Types for Tags
An adhesive, used to afﬁx a tag to the surface of the item that needs to be identiﬁed, is a
strong chemical mixture. It may affect the tag’s performance in various ways. For
example, it might absorb RF waves and can corrode the antennas in the long run.
Furthermore, some adhesives may deteriorate over time, even if they are perfectly ﬁne at
the time of their initial application.There are two basic types of adhesive:
■
Acrylic adhesives Offer best high-temperature performance and the widest
spectrum of properties.
www.syngress.com
74
Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags

■
Rubber-based adhesives Offer high initial tack, good for applications such
as tagging corrugated cases; relatively lower in cost.
The effectiveness of a tag adhesive depends on the following:
■
Ease and strength of initial tack
■
Time it takes the bond to form the full strength
■
The ﬁnal bond strength
■
Long-term bond stability and resistance to deterioration over time 
■
Stability in a hostile environment
After a tag has been labeled, it can be placed on the item that needs to be identiﬁed
and tracked.
Placing a Tag
Placing tags on the items can be challenging.There are no global guidelines regarding
where on the items the tags should be placed. It depends on the application, item, and
environment. On the other hand, you have only so much freedom in where you can
place the tag on an item. Most of the time, the tag is placed on the outside of a package.
In this case, you should be aware of how the package material can affect the RF signal.
The material of the package or in the vicinity of the package can affect the RF signal
between the tag and the reader in the ways shown in Table 3.5.

NOTE
Corrugated means rippled at regular intervals. Usually shipping boxes are made
with several layers of cardboard, and in the middle is a layer of corrugated
paper or cardboard. This layer in the middle gives the box more cushion to
withstand the hard knocks of shipping and handling.
The performance of an RFID system also depends on how the tagged items are
packed together, for example, on a pallet. Following are some considerations.
Shadowing
Shadowing is caused when an item, say B, is behind another item, say A, from the per-
spective of the reader. In this case, a signal from the reader will be received only by A.
The item B will get little or no signal and will be missed by the reader. Item B, in this
situation, is said to be shadowed by item A. If the items inside a package or the cases on a
pallet are densely packed, the reader will miss some of them.
NOTE
A pallet is a portable platform for stowing, handling, and moving cargo. 
Tag Placement and Orientation
The orientation of a tag with respect to the reader is an important factor that impacts
reading performance of an RFID system. For example, if a tag is oriented parallel to the
direction of propagation of energy coming from the reader, it will not receive its signal,
and no communication will occur.To facilitate communication, the tag antenna must
face the reader antenna. For example, consider the following scenario.
Reader antennas are often mounted on gantries placed around a conveyor.The tagged
packages (containers) are often cubic in shape, and therefore they have six faces to be con-
sidered for placing tags. In general, the bottom face should be avoided, to prevent mechan-
ical damage to the tag.The top face should be avoided if there is a possibility that the
packages will be stacked. Reader antennas on each side of the gantry will cover four faces
of the container.The exact positions of the tag and the reader and the antenna orientations
should be determined to ensure that the tag will be in the read zone of at least one reader.
A single reader antenna may not see all the faces of the container, especially if the con-
tainer contains RF-sensitive materials such as metals or liquids.

Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags

To improve performance, you can position antennas at different angles to read tags
that would otherwise be missed.
The orientation of a tag also depends on the polarization of the reader’s antenna.
Polarization and Orientation
As you learned in Chapter 2, antennas are either linearly polarized or circularly polar-
ized. For optimal power transfer between the reader antenna and the tag antenna, the
polarization of both antennas should match.The orientation of a tag’s antenna should be
consistent with the polarization of the reader’s antenna. Here are some examples:
■
In the case of a single dipole antenna, the antenna must be aligned parallel to
the incoming ﬁeld to receive it.
■
If reader’s antenna is producing horizontally polarized waves, the tag’s antenna
must be horizontally aligned.
■
If the reader’s antenna is circularly polarized, the tag will get some signal in any
orientation because circularly polarized waves have both components, hori-
zontal and vertical. In other words, circularly polarized reader antennas
improve read performance.
TIP
When you do not know the tag orientation or you have no control over it, you
should use the circularly polarized reader antenna because it can read hori-
zontal tags, vertical tags, and tags aligned to angles between horizontal and
vertical.
Our tag placement discussion so far mostly applies to readers and tags with
antennas. How about the RFID system that uses inductive coupling for communication?
Orientation in Inductive Coupling
Readers and antennas that use the inductive coupling communication technique use
inductive coils instead of antennas.These systems are relatively less sensitive to orienta-
tion. However, you should know that to transfer the maximum power, the two coils
should be in the same plane. If one of them is rotated with respect to the other, the
coupling (and therefore the power transfer) reduces in proportion to the cosine of the
angle of rotation.
The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:

■
The basic functionality of any tag is to store information about the item to
which it is attached and to provide this information when requested by a
reader.To support this functionality, all tags have three basic components: a
chip, an antenna, and a substrate.
■
There are two basic types of tags: active tags that can initiate communication
and passive tags that cannot initiate communication.
■
The principal consideration for placing a tag on an item is that it should be
readable by a reader.A tag is useless if it cannot be read.

Chapter 3 • Working with RFID Tags

Summary
A tag is a component of an RFID system that contains the information about the item
to which it is attached; the tag is capable of providing this information when requested.
So, a tag’s functionality is to store the information about the item to which it is afﬁxed,
to receive and process the request for this information, and to send a response to this
request that carries the information about the item.To support this functionality, a tag
has a chip and an antenna housed on a substrate.
To meet a wide spectrum of application requirements, tags come in different kinds.
Based on how they communicate, tags are of two types: active tags that can initiate com-
munication and passive tags that cannot initiate communication. Based on the features
they offer, the tags are classiﬁed into six classes: class 0, class 1, class 2, class 3, class 4, and
class 5. Class 0, 1, and 2 tags are passive tags, whereas class 3 tags are semipassive. Class 4
and 5 tags are active tags. Class 0 tags are read-only; class 0+, 1, and 2 tags are write-
once, read-only; and class 3, 4, and 5 tags are readable and writable.
Before the tags can be placed on items, they are turned into various kinds of labels,
depending on the varied needs of applications.This gives rise to a different way of cate-
gorizing tags. Some examples of these forms of tags are smart labels, inserts, RFID-
enabled tickets, and tie-on tags.The main goal in placing a tag on an item is that it
should be readable by a reader.A reader can only read a tag in a limited area around it,
called an interrogation zone, discussed in the next chapter.

Introduction
An RFID system is based on communication between an interrogator and a tag.The tag
is attached to an item that needs to be identiﬁed and tracked, and it contains the infor-
mation about the item such as its identiﬁcation.The interrogator’s job is to collect that
information from the tag and send the information to a host computer, where it could
be used. For an interrogator to be able to communicate with a tag, the tag must be
within a certain area around the interrogator, called the interrogation zone. Multiple inter-
rogators and tags can create a crowded environment called a dense environment in which
things (interrogator zones and signals) can run into each other.Therefore, you need to
conﬁgure the interrogation zone in an optimal way.
So, the central issue in this chapter is the interrogation zone.To be able to put your
arms around this issue, you will explore three avenues: functionality of an interrogator,
dense environments, and conﬁguring and optimizing interrogation zones.
Understanding an Interrogator
An interrogator is the RFID component that collects information from tags and sends it
to a host system.The process of collecting the information from the tags is called reading
the tags, and for this reason an interrogator is also called a reader.
As you know from Chapter 1, the goal of an RFID system is to identify and track
items, which is accomplished by tagging the items with tags and collecting the informa-
tion about the items from the tags.As Figure 4.1 depicts, an interrogator is at the center
of this action. From the perspective of an interrogator, the information collection process
is performed as follows:
1.
The interrogator gets a request for information from the host system.
2.
The interrogator sends the request for information to a tag within its interro-
gation zone.
3.
The tag responds with the requested information.
4.
The interrogator sends the collected information to the host system.

Now that you can appreciate the signiﬁcance of the role that an interrogator plays in
an RFID system, you can ask the following three questions to learn more about it:
1.
What is an interrogator made of?
2.
What is the functionality of an interrogator?
3.
How does an interrogator communicate?
What an Interrogator Is Made Of 
An interrogator is composed of the following components:
■
A RF module, also called a transceiver, which modulates outgoing RF signals
and demodulates incoming RF signals
■
A signal processing and control unit
■
A coupling element that communicates with the tags via RF signals; this is
essentially an antenna
■
An interface to communicate with the host system: to receive a request for
information and to send back the requested information
With these basic components, interrogators come in various types.
Interrogator Types 
Interrogators come in various types to meet varied application requirements.All these
types are categorized into the following two classes:
■
Read-only Reading information stored (programmed) in the tag is what an
interrogator is basically made for.All those interrogators that can only read the
information from the tag and cannot write the information to the tag are
called read-only interrogators.
■
Read and write Interrogators that can write information into a tag in addi-
tion to reading the information from the tag are called read and write interroga-
tors.
CAUTION
Not all interrogators have the write capability. For information to be written to
a tag, the interrogator should have the capability to write and the tag should
allow the writing.
Working with Interrogation Zones • Chapter 4
87
www.syngress.com

Both read-only and read/write interrogators come in various types, described in the
following sections.
Fixed-Mount Interrogators
Fixed-mount interrogators are ﬁxed-position interrogators mounted at speciﬁc locations
though which the tagged items are expected to pass. Conveyors, dock doors, and retail
store checkout points are some examples of such locations.Any tagged item that passes
through the interrogation zone (the area around the interrogator) is scanned—that is, the
interrogator reads the information from the tag attached to the item.The advantage of a
ﬁxed-mount interrogator is that the tags are read (in other words, the items are scanned)
automatically.The disadvantage of a ﬁxed-mounted interrogator is the possibly harsh
environment that comes with the location where the interrogator is mounted. Because
the reading is automated and because the interrogator is ﬁxed, environmental conditions
such as temperature, moisture, vibrations, and materials such as metals can pose chal-
lenges.You must take note of these conditions while mounting an interrogator—for
example, position an antenna away from metals.
NOTE
Water and material with water content can absorb energy from RF signals and
thereby weaken them, and metals can reﬂect RF signals and thereby change
their directions. Both of these factors (weakening the signal and changing the
signal direction) decrease an interrogator’s efﬁciency in reading tags.  
You might think that you can largely avoid harsh environmental conditions and gain
more ﬂexibility if you could get a mobile interrogator. Such devices are available; let’s
take a look.
Handheld Interrogators
Handheld interrogators are mobile (portable) interrogators, and therefore they contain all
the basic elements, including antenna and application software, in one device.The infor-
mation collected from the tags is stored in the interrogator and later transferred to a data
processing system, if the application requires it.
Handheld interrogators offer maximum ﬂexibility.A user can bring the interrogator
close to the tagged item and collect the information. So, these interrogators are designed
with near-ﬁeld read/write capabilities. In other words, a handheld interrogator’s read
range (the maximum distance from which an interrogator can read a tag) is less than that
of a mounted interrogator. Handheld interrogators can be used for applications such as
tracking and scanning items in medical, ofﬁce, and retail environments.
www.syngress.com
88
Chapter 4 • Working with Interrogation Zones

NOTE
A handheld interrogator typically supports only one antenna.
Now you get more ambitious and ask the question: Why can’t I get the best of both
worlds—a mounted interrogator that can be moved? Well, they are available too: they’re
called vehicle-mount interrogators.
Vehicle-Mount Interrogators
Vehicle-mount interrogators are mobile mount interrogators that can be mounted on a
vehicle such as a forklift. Because it’s mobile, you can cover a lot more area with a
vehicle-mount interrogator than a ﬁxed-mount interrogator. In addition, its read range is
larger than that of a handheld interrogator. Because it’s inside a vehicle, you can easily
add a printer and other peripherals to the system and communicate with the host system
wirelessly, for example, using wireless networks based on the 802.11 protocol.A disad-
vantage of the vehicle-mount interrogator is that it might have to work in the vicinity
of metallic materials.This could pose a challenge because metals can reﬂect the RF
signal.
As you can see, the components and types of interrogator are there to serve its func-
tionality, which we explore next.
What an Interrogator Is Good For 
Interrogators come with various functions and capabilities that can vary depending on
the application for which the interrogators are designed.The functions and capabilities
interrogators offer fall into three main categories: communication with the host com-
puter, communication with tags, and operational capabilities.
Communication with the Host Computer
Depending on the application, the data the interrogator collects from the tags may be
used by some application such as inventory control. In such cases, the interrogator needs
to send the collected data to a host computer to which it is connected.The connection
may be a serial connection or a network connection. In a serial connection, the inter-
rogator is connected to the host computer just like a peripheral is locally connected to a
computer. In a network connection, the reader is connected to a network to which the
host computer is also connected.The network connection may be through a cable or it
could be wireless, as in the case of a handheld reader.
Communication with the Tags
Communication with tags involves the following functionalities:
www.syngress.com
Working with Interrogation Zones • Chapter 4
89

■
Encoding and decoding information The interrogator communicates
with the tag wirelessly by sending and receiving RF waves. It codes the data
(information) into an RF carrier signal and transmits this signal into the free
space.This signal is to be received by a tag in the interrogator zone. It also
receives the response signal from the tags and decodes the information from it.
The frequency used for this communication between the interrogator and the
tag, called operating frequency, varies depending on the applications, standards,
and regulations.
■
Powering the passive tags Tags that do not have their own power source
(battery) are called passive tags.They get power from the signal they receive
from the interrogator and use that power for their operation (i.e., to power up
their circuitry) and for composing the response signal that they send back.
■
Reading and writing the tags  Reading the tag—that is, getting the infor-
mation from the tag about the tagged item—is the minimum functionality of
an interrogator. Some interrogators also have the capability of writing informa-
tion to the tag. However, this can happen only if the tag allows it.That is, the
tag must be a read/write tag—that is, a writable tag. Writable tags can allow an
interrogator to write new data, modify existing data, or delete the data alto-
gether.
Operational Capabilities
Operational capabilities enable the interrogator to integrate into the RFID system and
offer some features. Interrogators can offer three main operational capabilities:
■
Firmware upgrade  Firmware is a software program embedded in a device
that conﬁgures its basic functionality when the device is powered up. It consists
of software instructions stored in nonvolatile memory—the memory that sur-
vives even if the device is powered off.This memory is basically a chip called a
read-only memory (ROM) chip. In the earlier days of personal computing, if you
needed to change the instructions on a ROM chip, you would need a new
chip because you could not write to it, hence the name read-only. However,
these days most ﬁrmware chips are upgradeable—that is, you can change the
instructions on the chip.They can still be called ROM chips for historical rea-
sons. However, the memory on such chips is still nonvolatile, but the content
can be upgraded. If the interrogator has upgradeable ﬁrmware, it can be
upgraded to, for example, new functionalities and new standards and protocols.
This capability is important, given that RFID technology and standards are
continually evolving.
■
Graphical user interface (GUI)  Graphical user interfaces offer a conve-
nient way to interact with a device—for example, to tell it to do something
www.syngress.com
90
Chapter 4 • Working with Interrogation Zones

and then receive the results (output) of its work. For instance, an open window
on your computer is part of the GUI that allows you to interact with the
computer. Various interrogators offer various GUI options, depending on the
applications. For example, some interrogators offer an HTTP GUI, which
means that you can interact with the interrogator through the World Wide
Web using your Web browser; others offer only a local GUI. Either way, you
can conﬁgure and manage the interrogators using the GUIs they offer.
■
I/O capability  You might need to control (or use) the interrogator from
another device, or you might need your interrogator to control (or use)
another device. In both cases you will need to connect the other device to the
interrogator through a port.These ports are called input/output (I/O) ports and
the devices are I/O devices.An example of an input device is a device called an
electronic eye, which turns on the reader when it senses that an object has
entered the interrogation zone.An example of an output device is a light stack
that signals when a tag has been read.
NOTE
The underlying functionality of I/O capability is that an event can enable the
interrogator to do something (input), and the interrogator can create an event
in response to the information received from a tag (output).
You will learn more about the communication between an interrogator and a tag
throughout the book.An interrogator also communicates with the host computer.
Communicating with the Host
In an RFID system, an interrogator collects information from tags and sends it to the
host computer, where it can be used by an application such as inventory system.To be
able to send the information to the host computer, the interrogator must be connected
to it.The connection could be a serial connection through a serial port or a network
connection through a network card (interface) such as Ethernet.
Serial Connections
A serial connection consists of a serial port on the reader, a serial port on the host com-
puter, and a cable directly connecting the two serial ports.The data travels though the
cable as a stream of bits, one bit at a time, sequentially.The standard protocol used for
serial communication in most readers is RS-232, the same protocol that is typically used
to send data from your keyboard (as you type) to your computer. Serial connections
have the following advantages:
www.syngress.com
Working with Interrogation Zones • Chapter 4
91

■
Low cost
■
A reliable and locally managed communication link
However, serial connections also have the following disadvantages:
■
The ﬂexibility about the location of the host computer relative to the reader is
limited by the cable length.
■
Depending on the locations of the readers and the serial ports available on the
host computers, you will need multiple host computers for multiple readers.
■
If the readers in your RFID system have no network connections, you will
need to be physically there to manage them.
Depending on the size of your RFID system, the serial connections can result in
higher cost and signiﬁcant system downtime.The solution to this problem is replacing
the serial connections with network connections.
Network Connections
A network connection is made through a network card, also called an Ethernet card or inter-
face.The reader and the host computer are connected to the network through network
interfaces such as Ethernet cards and use the TCP/IP protocols to transfer data. For this
reason this connection is also called a TCP/IP connection.
NOTE
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is a suite of protocols
used by all computers connected to the Internet to communicate with each
other. You can think of the Internet as a big network of computers and other
devices connected to it.
Some of the protocols included in the TCP/IP protocol suite are described in Table
4.1.

Internet Protocol; used to deﬁne IP addresses for devices and to

TCP
Transmission Control Protocol; used for reliable communication
with a speciﬁc application on a destination device. For example,
the recipient will send the acknowledgments to the senders on
receiving the data, and if the data does not reach the destina-
tion, it will automatically be retransmitted.  
UDP
User Datagram Protocol; used for simple but unreliable communi-
cation. No acknowledgments and retransmissions are supported. 
An interrogator connected to the network using TCP/IP must have a network
address called an IP address. Network connectivity offers the following advantages to
your RFID system:
■
There’s no need for a cable between an interrogator and a host computer.
■
The interrogators can be connected to the network through network cables or
wirelessly.
■
The system requires a smaller number of host computers.
■
You can manage the RFID system remotely.
For a good-sized RFID system, the advantages of a networked system outweigh its
disadvantages. However, you should be aware of the possible disadvantages of a net-
worked RFID system:
■
Your system becomes vulnerable to all the security risks that a network poses.
Of course, security solutions are available.
■
A network shutdown will bring the whole system down.
■
You need network administrative skills to run a network.
A network of interrogators is an RFID system with multiple interrogators. Each inter-
rogator in your RFID system offers an interrogation zone, and it will attempt to read all
the tags passing through (or sitting in) the interrogation zone. For an RFID system with
multiple interrogators, there will be multiple interrogator zones, with each interrogator
reading multiple tags.This situation can offer what is called a dense environment.
www.syngress.com
Working with Interrogation Zones • Chapter 4
93

Dealing with Dense Environments
Interrogators and tags are two main components of an RFID system. When an RFID
system contains multiple tags and interrogators, a condition called a dense environment can
arise.There are two kinds of dense environments:
■
Dense interrogator environment A dense interrogator environment is an area
in which multiple interrogators are operating in close proximity to one
another.
■
Dense tag environment A dense tag environment is an area in which multiple
tags are in the interrogation zone of an interrogator so that more than one tag
can get the same signal from the interrogator.
Dense environments can hamper RFID system performance through effects such as
collisions.
Understanding Collisions 
What can you expect in a dense (crowded) environment? Yes, you are right: collisions.
Corresponding to the two kinds of dense environments are two kinds of collision: reader
collisions and tag collisions.
Reader Collisions
Reader collisions occur in a dense interrogator environment. In this environment, the
interrogation zone (coverage area) of one interrogator overlaps with the interrogation
zone of another interrogator.This overlap causes the following two problems:
■
Multiple reads More than one reader whose interrogation zones overlap can
read the same tag. Depending on the application, these duplicate reads can
cause problems.As an analogy, think of counting something multiple times
when it’s supposed to be counted only once. One of the solutions to this
problem is to program the RFID system so that a tag with a given unique ID
is read only once.
■
Signal interference When the interrogation zones of two readers overlap,
the signals from the two readers traveling in the overlap area at the same time
can collide with each other.This is called signal interference. One of the solutions
to this problem is that the readers use the time division multiple access
(TDMA) technique, according to which the readers read at fractionally dif-
ferent times, thereby reducing the probability of collisions.

Tag Collisions
A tag collision occurs when two or more tags try to respond to an interrogator’s request
for information at the same time. Why would they do that? Because they all were in the
interrogation zone, so they all received the request the interrogator sent.The multiple
responses will confuse the interrogator and could make it unable to identify any of the
responding tags and thereby the tagged items.
NOTE
The dense tag environment also creates a shadowing effect, which is a situation
in which a tagged item blocks the reader signal from reaching another tagged
item hiding behind it. Therefore, the hiding item can never be read and is said
to be shadowed by the item in front of it. 
So, the dense environments create collision problems, which can be addressed by so-
called anticollision protocols.
Anticollision Protocols
Where there is a problem, there is (or should be) a solution.A solution to the collision
problem is offered by the anticollision protocols, which fall into two categories: aloha-
based protocols and tree-based protocols.
Aloha-Based Protocols
The basic goal here is to read one tag at a time. Aloha-based protocols accomplish that by
using the following two schemes:
■
Time-slotted aloha In the time-slotted aloha scheme, an interrogator keeps
periodically sending a request for an ID. Such an interrogator is called a beacon.
When a tag receives the request, it randomly selects a time slot in which it
responds with its ID. If the interrogator recognizes the ID, it starts communi-
cating with that tag to get the required information.After the interrogator is
done communicating with this tag, it again starts sending out the request com-
mands that another tag can respond to, and so on. If two or more tags get the
same request command from the interrogator, the hope is that the random
selection algorithm will generate different time slots for their responses,
thereby avoiding the collision. Note that it’s possible that the two tags can
select (randomly) the same time slot. In this case there will be a collision. So,
this approach reduces collisions but does not eliminate them.
www.syngress.com
Working with Interrogation Zones • Chapter 4
95

■
Frame-slotted aloha The frame-slotted aloha scheme is an extension of the
time-slotted scheme. Instead of randomly selecting a time slot, a frame of mul-
tiple time frames is conﬁgured, and a given tag can only respond in a speciﬁc
time slot within the frame.This further reduces the probability of collision.
There are two problems with the aloha-based protocols:
■
They cannot completely eliminate collisions.
■
In the aloha-based protocols, a tag might not be identiﬁed for a long time
because other tags keep selecting time slots earlier than that of this tag.This
situation is called tag starvation.
Tree-based anticollision protocols offer a solution to the tag starvation problem.
Tree-Based Protocols
Tree-based protocols use the algorithm that splits the group of colliding tags into two sub-
groups iteratively until the reader recognizes the tag IDs without collisions.This can be
done in two different ways, which gives rise to two tree-based protocols:
■
Binary tree protocol To support the binary tree protocol, the tags are required
to manage a counter and have a random number generator.The colliding tags
are split according to a number that they randomly select.The tags that select 0
transmit their IDs to the interrogator. If multiple tags select 0 and hence
respond, the interrogator keeps walking down the tree until only one tag
responds. When that happens, the interrogator establishes communication with
that tag to get the required information.
■
Query tree protocol The query tree protocol uses the algorithm, following
which the interrogator sends a query with a preﬁx and the tags that have the
ID to match the preﬁx respond.
Tree-based protocols solve the tag starvation problem, but they can create long iden-
tiﬁcation delays. So, the underlying goal of all anticollision protocols is to select only one
tag at a time that the reader can communicate with. However, for a tag to be read by an
interrogator, it must be in the interrogation zone.The interrogation zones need to be set
up and conﬁgured.
Conﬁguring Interrogation Zones
The interrogator zone is the area around an interrogator within which it can successfully
communicate with a tag. In other words, when a tag enters an interrogation zone, it can
be interrogated by the interrogator. From the perspective of a passive tag, the inter-
rogator zone is the area in which an interrogator can provide enough energy to power
www.syngress.com
96
Chapter 4 • Working with Interrogation Zones

up the passive tag and receive information. Passive tags outside the interrogation zone do
not receive enough energy from the interrogator to reﬂect a signal.
CAUTION
The interrogation zone is sometimes also called the read ﬁeld or the reader
ﬁeld.
Interrogation zones need to be conﬁgured, which involves setting up readers at spe-
ciﬁc locations where the large number of items pass through.These points are called
choke points.
The deﬁnition of a successful conﬁguration of an interrogation zone will be inﬂu-
enced and partly determined by the following two factors:
■
Business process ﬂow
■
Site assessment, including physical infrastructure, discussed in Chapter 7
However, the following are the common factors that you should consider to suc-
cessfully conﬁgure the interrogation zone:
■
The read rates required by the tag trafﬁc
■
Power required by the interrogator and the tags
■
Distance required or available between the interrogator and the tags
Conﬁguring an interrogation zone involves the following:
■
Conﬁguring interrogator commands
■
Conﬁguring interrogator settings
■
Adjusting the read power of the interrogator to an optimal value
Conﬁguring Interrogator Commands
Interrogator commands are usually issued on the host computer, either by an application
or using a GUI. Some of the common interrogator commands are described in Table
4.2.
www.syngress.com
Working with Interrogation Zones • Chapter 4
97

Table 4.2 Some Common Interrogator Commands and Their Usage
Command
Action
KILL
Disable the tag permanently
LOCK
Disable writing to the tag
QUERY
Initiate communication with the tag
READ
Get information from the tag
WRITE
Write the ID or other information to the tag
UNLOCK
Enable writing to the tag—that is, remove the write protection
on the tag
As you can see in Table 4.2, some commands such as LOCK and UNLOCK con-
ﬁgure certain behavior or capability in the interrogator.
CAUTION
One use of the KILL command is to address privacy concerns. However,
remember the other side of the coin: It can also be used maliciously to disrupt
the system. 
The KILL command, once issued, prevents a tag from communicating back to the
reader, and it appears to the reader as inoperative. Why will you use the KILL com-
mand? One reason is to manage the tag population. Other commands that you can use
to manage the tag populations are:
■
SELECT You can use this command to determine which groups of tags will
respond to this interrogator. For selection purposes, you can group the tags by
characteristics such as manufacturer code. By isolating only certain groups of
tags that the interrogator should care about, you increase system performance,
because now that interrogator has fewer numbers of tags to deal with and to
sort through. Once you have grouped together some tags that the interrogator
should care about, you can identify the individual tags in the group.
■
INVENTORY This command is used to identify an individual tag in a group.
After an individual tag has been identiﬁed, the interrogator can access it.
■
ACCESS This command is used to access the individual tag in a group. Once
the interrogator has access to an individual tag, it can deal with it, such as
reading the information from it, writing information to it, killing the tag, and
so on.
www.syngress.com

Chapter 4 • Working with Interrogation Zones

The tag population is controlled to optimize the interrogation zone and improve
system performance. In addition to these commands, there are some other settings that
you can conﬁgure.
Conﬁguring Interrogator Settings
Different interrogators offer different settings and features that you can conﬁgure. Some
of these settings are described in Table 4.3.
Table 4.3 Some Settings That You Can Conﬁgure for Readers
Setting 
Description
Event notiﬁcation
When enabled, this setting provides notiﬁcation when a
certain event occurs, such as a tag entering the interroga-
tion zone or the number of tags in the interrogation zone
exceeding a threshold value.
Filtering
Sets speciﬁc ﬁlters and associates them with speciﬁc read
points. This allows you to tell the interrogator to be inter-
ested only in certain kinds of tags and to ignore other
kinds.
Host management
Authorizes the listed host computers, called trusted
hosts, to communicate with the interrogator.
Reader communication
Allows you to set communication-related settings.
Reader operation
Allows you to rename, enable, or disable the interrogator.
Read point zone
Allows you to logically group two or more read points for
management purposes.
User management
Allows you to add users who can then be given access
and management rights.
Some available software applications will help you conﬁgure, monitor, and manage
the readers in your RFID system. Following are some additional features offered by such
applications:
■
Reader status You can get the status of a speciﬁc interrogator by issuing the
speciﬁc reader status command offered by the application that will typically
display the following information:
■
Information about the interrogator’s kernel
■
Information about the read points and antennas attached to the inter-
rogator
■
How long the reader has been up and running
■
Overall status You can also get details on the overall status of the RFID
system, such as the following:
www.syngress.com
Working with Interrogation Zones • Chapter 4
99

■
Total number of readers connected to the system
■
Readers enabled for reading
■
Scan control You can use this feature to scan the read points and enable and
disable them.
The other interrogator zone-related conﬁguration tasks that you are allowed to per-
form are the following:
■
Select RFID protocols to be used by the interrogator, such as anti-collision
protocols
■
Modify the conﬁguration options for the protocol that you selected
■
Set the RF mode
■
Adjust output power 
■
Enable tag alerts
You can also conﬁgure interrogator commands and settings to optimize the interro-
gation zone.
Optimizing Interrogation Zones
You want your RFID system to be reliable, robust, and performing at its peak.The relia-
bility, robustness, and performance are built into the system components, but you can
optimize them by ﬁne-tuning the way the components work together. One way you
can make your system more reliable and robust and yield peak performance is by opti-
mizing the interrogation zones. Optimizing an interrogation zone involves correctly set-
ting up the system for the given environment and application in which the interrogator
will function. Some of the factors that you need to consider for optimizing the interro-
gation zones are discussed in this section.
The Network Factor
A network has a limited bandwidth for communication—that is, for transferring data.All
the devices on the network share that bandwidth.An RFID reader can typically read
hundreds of tags per second; each read cycle for each reader consumes bandwidth.
Uncontrolled readers can slow the network by consuming large shares of bandwidth.
Therefore, network trafﬁc must be monitored and managed. In addition, to optimize the
system you are setting up, you should carefully consider the bandwidth and the number
of readers that will share that bandwidth on your network.
www.syngress.com
100
Chapter 4 • Working with Interrogation Zones

NOTE
Bandwidth is the width of a band of electromagnetic frequencies used for
transferring data. It is a measure of how fast data can be transferred on a
given transmission path and determines the total data transmission rate that
the path can offer. The basic units of bandwidth are Hertz, abbreviated Hz
(cycles/sec), in the analogous world and bits/sec in the digital world. 
Operation Mode
Your interrogator’s performance can depend on the mode in which the interrogator is
communicating.An interrogator can communicate in one of the following two commu-
nication (or operational) modes:
■
Half duplex  This is the mode in which data transfer between two devices
can occur in only one direction at a time.That means that a reader operating
in half-duplex mode can either send signals to tags or receive signals from a tag
but cannot send and receive at the same time.An interrogator operating in
half-duplex mode is conﬁgured for a monostatic antenna, which means that the
interrogator uses the same (one) antenna for sending and receiving signals.A
monostatic antenna is also called a patch antenna.A monostatic antenna conﬁg-
uration offers a smaller coverage area.
■
Full duplex  This is the mode in which data can be transferred between two
devices in both directions simultaneously.That means that a reader operating in
full-duplex mode can send a signal to the tag and receive a signal from a tag at
the same time. An antenna conﬁguration for the reader that offers this func-
tionality is called a bistatic antenna, which means that the interrogator will use
one antenna for sending signals and another antenna for receiving signals.A
bistatic antenna conﬁguration offers a wider coverage area.
Reader-to-Reader Interference
As explained earlier in this chapter, if multiple readers are too close to each other, their
interrogation zones can overlap.This will cause collisions and interference between the
signals from different readers.The anticollision protocols as solutions to collisions have
already been discussed in this chapter.You can also consider the following solutions to
avoid interference problems:
■
Position the interfering antennas away from each other.
■
Reduce the interrogator power.
www.syngress.com
Working with Interrogation Zones • Chapter 4
101

■
Set the interfering interrogators to operate on different frequencies.
■
Program the RFID system so that a tag with a given unique ID is read only
once.This will solve the multiple reads problem.
■
Set the readers to use the TDMA technique, according to which the readers
read at fractionally different times, thereby reducing the probability of colli-
sions.
You can also properly tune your reader to improve system performance.
System Performance and Tuning
You can tune and conﬁgure certain characteristics of a reader, such as power output and
protocols, to optimize its performance in a given environment and application:
■
Power output You can ﬁne-tune an interrogator by adjusting its output
power. Remember that always using the maximum allowed power output may
not be the best choice for your system. So you might need to optimize the
power settings for a given environment and application.You should evaluate
the physical quantities such as attenuation, ERP, and free space loss to adjust
the power settings for an interrogation zone.
■
Protocol conﬁguration Different tags may support different communication
protocols.To read all kinds of tags, a reader typically has to support and execute
several protocols because the reader does not know ahead of time what pro-
tocol the incoming tags might be supporting.This takes time and slows down
the reader. However, when all the tags are coming from the same location and
support a speciﬁc protocol, you can conﬁgure the reader for that speciﬁc pro-
tocol only.This will improve the reader’s performance. However, keep in mind
that you cannot do this for a location where the tagged items come from dif-
ferent places and the tags might be supporting different protocols.
■
Read cycle rate A read cycle is a scan for RFID tags performed by a reader.
The reader can run read cycles periodically or on demand.After a read cycle,
the reader returns (for example, to the host computer) a set of observations—
for example, a set of IDs for the tags that were read. For peak performance, the
read cycle rates must be optimized. For instance, if you know that only a cer-
tain kind of tag will enter a given interrogation zone, you conﬁgure the inter-
rogator to scan (look) for only that kind of tag.This will reduce the overall
scan time and thereby improve performance.
www.syngress.com
102
Chapter 4 • Working with Interrogation Zones

The Tag Travel Speed
The term tag travel speed refers to the speed of the tagged item or the speed of the plat-
form such as a conveyor on which the tagged items are placed.The travel speed deter-
mines the following:
■
The duration for which a tag will stay in the interrogation zone
■
The number of tags that will pass through the interrogation zone in a given
duration and will need to be read in that duration
The higher the tag travel speed, the higher the reader read speed that is required for
an optimal interrogation zone. So, to determine the optimal read speed for the reader,
you need to know how many tags will pass through the interrogation zone per unit of
time. If you decrease the tag speed too much, the tag read rate will decrease as well, and
if you increase the tag speed too much, the reader will miss reading some of the tags,
which will hamper accuracy.Therefore, to optimize the interrogation zone, you need to
strike a balance between tag speed and the reader’s read speed.
The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■
The job of an interrogator is to collect information from the tags in its inter-
rogation zone and send that information to a host computer, where it can be
used.
■
Multiple tags in an interrogation zone create a dense tag environment, which
causes tag collision—that is, multiple tags try to respond to an interrogator at
the same time. Overlapping interrogation zones create a dense interrogator
environment, which causes reader collision—that is, multiple readers try to
read the same tag and their signals interfere.
■
You should conﬁgure a reader to optimize its interrogation zone.The strategy
for optimization may depend on the environment and the application.

Summary
The core functionality of an interrogator (also called a reader) is to collect information
from tags and send that information to a host system. For a tag to be read successfully, it
must be in the area around the interrogator, called the interrogation zone. Multiple tags in
an interrogation zone can create an environment called a dense tag environment, which
can cause tag collisions—that is, multiple tags try to respond to an interrogator at the
same time. Multiple interrogators close to each other may create overlapping interroga-
tion zones, called a dense interrogator environment. The dense interrogator environment
causes reader collisions, which means multiple readers try to read the same tag and the
signals from multiple readers interfere with each other.The collision problem is
addressed by anticollision protocols, which fall into two categories: aloha-based protocols
and tree-based protocols.Aloha-based protocols create the tag starvation problem—that
is, a tag may have to wait for very log time before it could be identiﬁed; whereas tree-
based protocols solve the starvation problem, but they can create long identiﬁcation
delays in general.
Interrogation zones need to be conﬁgured, a process that includes setting up readers
and conﬁguring reader commands and options. While conﬁguring an interrogation
zone, you must try to optimize it for performance and application requirements.The
deﬁnition of successful conﬁguration and optimization partly depends on the environ-
ment in which the RFID system works and the application. In this chapter, we talked
about collision protocols. Protocols and standards are important for the smooth advance-
ment of any industry. We discuss RFID standards in the next chapter.
Exam’s Eye View
Comprehend
 An interrogator collects the information about an item from the tag attached
to that item and sends the information to a host computer, where it can be
used.
 Passive tags use the power from the signal the interrogator sends to power up
their circuitry and to compose the response signal.
 Fixed-mount interrogators are set to scan automatically and are built to
withstand harsh environmental conditions.
 Handheld interrogators offer greater ﬂexibility because they can be moved to
any place and are designed to have shorter read range.
 A dense interrogator environment creates reader collisions due to overlapping
interrogation zones, whereas a dense tag environment creates tag collisions.
www.syngress.com
104
Chapter 4 • Working with Interrogation Zones

 The greater the tag speed in the interrogation zone, the greater the read speed
required from the reader.
Look Out
 Of course, all interrogators can read tags, but some interrogators can also write
to tags.
 Not all interrogators have the write capability. For information to be written
to a tag, the interrogator should have the capability to write, and the tag
should allow the writing.
 A dense tag environment creates a shadowing effect—that is, a tag blocks
another tag from being read.
 The KILL command on an interrogator is used to disable a tag and not to
disable the interrogator.
 If you increase tag speed too much, the reader will miss reading some tags,
whereas if you decrease tag speed too much, the read rate will be low.
Memorize
 The main challenge of a vehicle-mounted interrogator is the metal that can
reﬂect the RF signal, resulting in reduced read range and read rates.
 Firmware is a software program stored in nonvolatile memory. Some
interrogators offer the capability of upgrading the ﬁrmware.
 Portable interrogators use wireless technology to send data to host computers,
and ﬁxed-mount interrogators can use serial connections or a network
connections.The network connection may be cabled or wireless.
 The standard protocol used for serial communication in most readers is RS-
232.
 Aloha-based anticollision protocols create the tag starvation problem.Tree-
based anticollision protocols solve this problem, but they can create long
identiﬁcation delays.

Introduction
All mature (or maturing) industries have their regulations and standards, and the RFID
industry is no exception. Regulations help make the devices and systems in the industry
secure and safe, and they help the industry advance without disrupting other industries.
Standards are necessary to bring some order and interoperability within a speciﬁc
industry. Without agreed-on standards, all vendors will manufacture or develop products
and devices by following their own rules, and there will be a perfect chaos instead of
interoperability. Of course, regulations and standards have their impact on an industry’s
products as well.
So, the main goal of this chapter is to understand the regulations and standards at
work in the RFID industry.To accomplish this goal, we will explore three avenues:
RFID regulations, RFID standards, and the impact of these regulations and standards.
Understanding 
Regulations and Standards
What are regulations and standards, and why do we need them? First, note that regula-
tions and standards are not limited to RFID systems. Let’s take a general look at these
two concepts: regulations and standards.
Regulations
A regulation, in general, is a legal restriction promulgated by a government administra-
tive agency through rule making and is typically supported by a threat of consequences,
such as ﬁne for not following the rules.A regulation is mandated by the government or
state as an attempt to produce an outcome that might not otherwise occur or to prevent
an outcome that might otherwise occur. Regulations rarely work perfectly; they don’t
always produce the complete desired outcome or completely prevent the undesired out-
come, but they do generally modify what would otherwise take place. Examples of regu-
lations include controlling market entries, prices, wages, pollution, employment for
certain groups of people in certain industries, and standards of production for certain
goods and services—as well as, of course, the regulations involved in manufacturing
RFID devices.
Standards
The term standard refers to the way something should be done. When multiple vendors
are producing the same product in different ways, the products from those different ven-
dors will not interoperate. If all those vendors followed the same standard, their products
would be compatible with each other and would be interoperable. So, in some industries
the absence of a standard would mean chaos.

In the context of industries and technologies, standardization is the process of estab-
lishing a technical standard among competing vendors in a market to bring beneﬁts
without hurting competition.As an example, all of Europe uses 230-volt, 50 Hz,AC
main grids and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) cell phones, and
they measure length in meters.An example of global standards is the Internet, which is
based on standard protocols. Other examples of global standards are the worldwide stan-
dards and drafts for the standardization of power cords developed and maintained by the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC), and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU).
And then there are standards for RFID devices. One parameter that is regulated
in the RFID industry is the frequency at which RFID devices can operate.
Regulating Frequency Usage
A tag and a reader use radio waves of a certain frequency, called their operating frequency,
to communicate with each other. Radio waves are electromagnetic waves that cover part
of the electromagnetic spectrum of frequencies, called radio frequency spectrum. Because
RFID systems generate and radiate the electromagnetic waves that fall along the radio
frequency spectrum, they are justiﬁably classiﬁed as radio systems, and they are regulated
as such. However, other radio services were in operation before the arrival of RFID sys-
tems. Radio, television, mobile radio services (police, security services, and industry),
marine and aeronautical radio services, and mobile telephones are a few to count.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that these already existing services are not disrupted
or impaired by these newcomers: the RFID systems.
For this reason, regulatory bodies allocate different frequency bands (ranges) to a
speciﬁc group of devices. RFID systems are available in all the radio frequency ranges:
LF, HF, UHF, and microwave. Here is the situation with allocating the speciﬁc frequen-
cies to the RFID systems in these RF bands:
■
LF Most countries have allocated 125 KHz or 134 KHz to RFID devices.
■
HF Most countries have allocated 13.56 MHz to RFID devices.
■
UHF Different countries have allocated different frequencies.
■
Microwave Different countries use different frequencies.
As you can see, the frequencies being used by various countries in the LF and HF
ranges are very consistent with each other. However, because RFID systems with oper-
ating frequencies in the UHF range are relatively new, no global agreement on the oper-
ating frequencies for these devices has been reached yet. UHF RFID systems have
evolved at different frequencies in different regions of the world.The absence of a single
global organization to develop regulations and standards for RFID technology has
prompted countries to adopt their own regulations and standards.

The Regulatory Regions
If the regions of the world use different operating frequencies for RFID systems, an
RFID device that works in one region will not work in another region. Because the
UHF RFID systems are gaining popularity all over the world, it’s desirable to have some
uniformity in the operating frequencies for these devices. In an attempt to seek some
degree of uniformity for UHF frequency usage, the ITU has organized the world into
the following three regulatory regions:
■
Region 1 includes Europe and Africa.
■
Region 2 includes North and South America.
■
Region 3 includes Asia and Australia.
Table 5.1 presents some information such as allocated UHF bands and allowed max-
imum power emissions, as regulated by the main regulatory bodies in these regions.
TIP
It might sound silly, but it’s important, at least from the exam viewpoint, to
remember which country belongs to which region. For example, the United
States belongs to region 2, not region 1.

Each country in these regions manages its frequency allocations within the guide-
lines set by the region’s main regulatory body.Table 5.2 shows the RF ranges used for
the RFID devices in various countries.This table reﬂects the following facts:
■
The HF RFID devices use 13.56 MHz operating frequency all over the world.
■
Most countries have allotted 125 MHz or 134 MHz for HF RFID devices.
■
There is better global agreement on operating frequency for the RFID devices
in the LF, HF, and microwave ranges than in the UHF range.

The last column in Table 5.2 shows the regulated maximum power that can be
emitted by an RFID device.The power factor is especially important for passive tags
because they don’t have their own power source and use the power from the reader’s
signal to run their circuitry and to compose the response signal. Consider an isotropic
antenna radiating power uniformly in all directions.That means the power will travel in
the form of a sphere.The area of the sphere is directly proportional to the square of the
radius of the sphere, which implies that the energy per unit area will be inversely propor-
tional to the square of the distance from the antenna. In other words, RF energy radiated
by an antenna dissipates very quickly as the RF wave travels through space. For example,
every time the distance from an antenna doubles, the power available reduces by a
quarter.You can turn it around to say that the read range of a reader is directly propor-
tional to the square root of the power emitted. Exercise 5.1 demonstrates this concept.
www.syngress.com
Working with Regulations and Standards • Chapter 5
117

EXERCISE 5.1 
You are traveling with a radio that operates in the same frequency as an RFID
system. You are in a country where the allowed maximum power emission for
this RFID device is  0.5 W. To avoid interference with this device, you have to
keep your radio 3 meters away from this device. Now you move to another
country where the maximum power emitted by this RFID device is regulated to
be 4 W. How far away will you have to keep your radio from this device to pre-
vent interference? 
Solution: Given: 
P1 = 0.5 W, P2 = 4 W,  d1 = 3 meters
Because the read range is directly proportional to the square root of the
emitted power, we can express this relationship in the following formula:
d1 = C x P11/2  
d2 = C x P21/2
where C is a constant of proportionality. This implies:     
d2/ d1 = (P2/P1)1/2  => d2 = d1 x (P2/ P1)1/2  = 3 x (4/0.5)1/2   =
8.5 m
Regulating frequencies prevent interference between the operations of different RF
devices and provide interoperability among RFID systems.And there is another advan-
tage of RF regulations: safety.
Safety Regulations
The human body exposed to RF radiation absorbs the energy (power) from the RF
waves. Safety regulations and guidelines for human exposure to RF ﬁelds are necessary
because if the RF energy absorption exceeds a threshold value, adverse biological effects
could occur. Some of these adverse effects are:
■
Changes in cell cycle and cell proliferation
■
Changes in the blood-brain barrier that protects the brain from external
harmful chemicals and toxins
■
Alterations in electric brainwaves
The absorption of RF energy is measured in a quantity called speciﬁc absorption rate
(SAR), which is a measure of the rate of energy absorbed by (or dissipated in) an incre-
www.syngress.com
118
Chapter 5 • Working with Regulations and Standards

mental mass contained in a volume element of dielectric materials such as biological tis-
sues.The SAR is calculated using the following equation:
SAR = C x E2/d
where:
■
C is conductivity of the body tissue in S/m (Siemens per meter, where Siemen
is just a reciprocal of Ohm, the unit for resistance).
■
E is the electric ﬁeld strength in the tissue in V/m.
■
d is the density of the body tissue in Kg/m3.
In the United States, the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to RF energy
produced by mobile devices and requires that devices such as cell phones sold in the
United States have a SAR level at or below 1.6 W per kilogram, taken over a volume of
1 gram of tissues. In Europe, the corresponding limit is 2 W/kg taken over a volume of
10 grams of tissues.The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has its
own guidelines, as shown in Table 5.3.

CAUTION
When designing and implementing an RFID system, you must check out and
follow the safety guidelines set by local, regional, national, and international
organizations for human exposure to RF waves.
So, the regulations in the RFID industry ensure that RFID devices are safe and that
they do not disrupt the already existing services. But how about the interoperability of
the devices from different vendors—that is, the ability of the devices to function
together effectively? Well, that’s the job of standards.

RFID Standards
Standardization of its products is one of the important issues that any emerging industry
has to deal with. Following are the advantages of having industry standards:
■
Because all vendors follow the same standard to manufacture devices, technical
standards ensure the interoperability of the devices.This beneﬁts the consumer
and helps vendors develop healthy competition.
■
Because the standards bodies are not serving the interests of just one vendor,
standards generally deﬁne the most efﬁcient platform on which an industry
can operate and advance.
■
Standards generally reduce cost and ease implementation.
■
Standards develop consumer conﬁdence in the technology.
Several organizations have been involved in developing standards for RFID tech-
nology; the ISO and EPCglobal are the prominent two.
ISO Standards
The ISO is an international standards body composed of representatives from national
standards bodies. Founded on February 23, 1947, this organization sets worldwide indus-
trial and commercial standards, which are popularly called ISO standards.
The ISO has developed RFID standards in the following areas:
■
Identiﬁcation standards regarding the coding of ID or other information on
tags.
■
Air interface protocols that deﬁne the rules of communication between tags
and interrogators.
■
Data protocols for the middleware of an RFID system.
■
Standards for testing, compliance, and safety.
Some of these standards are shown in Table 5.4.
NOTE
The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is an international standards
organization in the area of electrical, electronic, and related technologies. Some
of its standards are developed jointly with the ISO.

The various values of the integer i in the table correspond to different operating fre-

readers and tags.This includes the rules about the following tasks:
■
Data encoding, including modulation and demodulation
■
Communication commands to make operations on the tag, such as reading,
writing, modifying, and locking data, as well s killing the tag
■
Anticollision algorithms
The ISO develops standards in several areas, including computer networking. In the
world of RFID standards, there is another player speciﬁc to RFID: EPCglobal.
EPCglobal Standards
Here is how EPCglobal came into the picture:The Auto-ID Center at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT), working in conjunction with industry leaders and aca-
demic institutions around the world, designed a system to bring the beneﬁts of RFID to
the global supply chain.This system comprises the Electronic Product Code (EPC),
RFID technology, and the supporting software based on EPCglobal standards, and is
referred to as the EPCglobal Network.The network includes elements such as EPC, the
ID system for EPC tags and readers, and Object Name Service (ONS).The EPCglobal
network (or any RFID information network like this) provides the following ﬁve main
services:
www.syngress.com
Working with Regulations and Standards • Chapter 5
121

■
Assigning unique identiﬁcation numbers to items to enable them to
be identiﬁed EPC numbers allow item-level tracking.
■
Detecting and identifying items EPC tags and readers make it possible.
■
Collecting and ﬁltering data EPC middleware provides services that facili-
tate data exchange between EPC readers and business information systems
such as databases. Only the data about events of interest will be stored.
■
Querying and storing data This service enables different enterprise appli-
cations running at different locations to exchange and share data.That means
the trading partners can query and exchange data among themselves.
■
Locating information This is a lookup and discovery service to locate the
repositories for the required EPC data.
EPCglobal Inc. is a joint venture between GS1 (formerly known as EAN
International) and GS1 US (formerly the Uniform Code Council Inc.).The organization
was set up to achieve worldwide adoption and standardization of EPC technology in an
ethical and responsible way. In other words, EPCglobal is leading the development of
industry-driven standards for EPC to support the use of RFID in today’s trading network
environments.The EPCglobal Gen 2 (popularly called Gen 2) standard, approved in
December 2004, is likely to form the backbone of RFID tag standards moving forward.
NOTE
The Gen 2 standard is designed to work globally and enjoys the support of
major manufacturers.
What is EPC, anyway? EPC is a family of coding schemes for Gen 2 tags. It is
designed to meet the needs of various industries while at the same time guaranteeing
uniqueness for all EPC-compliant tags, called EPC tags. EPC encoding schemes typically
contain a serial number, called an EPC number, which can be used to uniquely identify
an object.The EPC number is a structured number composed of multiple ﬁelds, as
shown in Table 5.5.

numbers issued by EPCglobal are required if companies will engage with trading part-
ners outside their internal operations.
An example of an EPC number is shown in Figure 5.1.Additional ﬁelds may also
be used as part of the EPC number to properly encode and decode information from
different numbering systems into their native (human-readable) forms.
Figure 5.1 Structure of an EPC Number (Fields Are Explained in Table 5.5)
The EPC system also deﬁnes the tag classes, which are discussed in Chapter 4.
Of course, these regulations and standards have their impact on the RFID industry,
including users. Most of the standards we have looked at so far can be categorized into
two groups: tag data standards and air interface protocols.
Air Interface and Tag Data Standards
An RFID system consists of two main functionalities:

■
Tag data Writing data to a tag and reading data from the tag.
■
Communication Transferring data—for example, between a reader and a
tag.
Corresponding to these two functionalities are two groups of standards: standards for
tag data formats and standards for air interface protocols.
Tag Data Standards
Tag data standards are protocols that specify how to write data to a tag and how to read
data from the tag. In other words, they specify the encoding, decoding, and formats of
data.The whole does not need to be stored on a tag.You can store data about an item in
a database and let the data ﬁelds on the tag point to this data. For example, after you
retrieve the EPC number from a tag, this number can point to the data about the item
stored in a database.Tag data formats can be used to accomplish the following:
■
Specify the tag architecture.
■
Identify a speciﬁc item—for example, during shipment.
■
Specify the available memory size on a tag.
CAUTION
You must know the difference between air interface protocols and tag data
standards.
Air Interface Protocols
Air interface protocols specify the rules for communication between a tag and a reader.
This set of protocols include anticollision algorithms to deal with the dense environments
as well as modulation and demodulation—that is, coding data into the outgoing carrier
signal and decoding data from an incoming signal. Some features of an air interface pro-
tocol may depend on the operating frequency. For example, multiple standards with the
name ISO/IEC 18000-i, where i is an integer, correspond to different frequencies.
Impact of Regulations and Standards
RFID regulations and standards have deﬁnitely made an impact on the RFID industry
in various areas, including business operations and IT infrastructure.The impact has both
advantages and disadvantages.
www.syngress.com
124
Chapter 5 • Working with Regulations and Standards

Advantages of Regulations
The regulations in the RFID area made by different countries and regulatory organiza-
tions have the following positive impacts:
■
They lower the risk of adverse radiation effects.
■
They pave the way for healthy market competition by regulating the areas
where foul play could otherwise happen. For example, regulating the fre-
quency and the maximum power emission secures the existing RF technolo-
gies and services from disruption and secures the public from adverse radiation
effects.At the same time, it also forces vendors to compete in other areas such
as features, price, and customer service.
■
Regulations also help advancement of technology by directly or indirectly
making it easier for more players to enter the market, thereby promoting
entrepreneurship.
Advantages of Standards
What would there be without standards? Chaos:The same product from different ven-
dors would work in different ways, and as a result, two instances of the same product
from different vendors would not be interoperable with each other. In general, the fol-
lowing are the advantages of having standards in the RFID industry:
■
All devices following the same standard will be interoperable with each other.
This helps consumers and therefore vendors as well.
■
Standards promote automation and thereby reduce duplication of effort. For
example, whatever is standardized can be built once and used in other applica-
tions where it is needed rather than building it over and over again in the same
or different ways.
■
Because the standards bodies are not serving the interest of just one vendor,
the standards generally deﬁne the most efﬁcient platform on which an industry
can operate and advance.
■
Standards generally reduce cost and ease implementation.
■
Standards develop consumer conﬁdence in the technology.
Looking at the other side of the coin, regulations and standards do have their disad-
vantages.
Disadvantages of Regulations and Standards
The following are the disadvantages of regulations and standards:
www.syngress.com
Working with Regulations and Standards • Chapter 5
125

■
The highest limit on the emitted power sets the highest limit on the read
range of a tag.
■
Passive tags are especially affected by the highest limit on the emitted power
because they depend on the reader for the power that they use to power up
their circuitry and to compose the response signal.
■
Because the regulated operating frequencies are different in different regions of
the world, an RFID device that works in one region will not work in another
region.
The advantages of regulations and standards often outweigh the disadvantages.

The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■
To allot the frequency usage for RFID devices (especially in the UHF band),
the world is organized into three regulatory regions: Region 1 includes Europe
and Africa, Region 2 includes the Americas, and Region 3 includes Asia and
Australia.
■
The two organizations that develop standards for RFID are the ISO and
EPCglobal.

The main advantage of RFID regulations is to make RFID devices safe and to

Summary
The regulations in the RFID industry serve two main purposes: to keep RFID devices
safe (for example, in the area of human exposure to radiation) and to prevent RFID
devices from disrupting the existing services in the RF arena.These goals are established
by regulating the maximum power emitted by the devices and by regulating operating
frequencies.The world is organized into three regulatory regions: Region 1, which
includes Europe; Region 2, which includes the Americas; and Region 3, which includes
Asia and Australia.
The main purpose of RFID standards is to ensure interoperability: Different systems
and components work together effectively.This helps an industry to advance, and it also
helps create healthy marketing competition among vendors.There are two main stan-
dards organizations in the RFID arena: ISO, which develops standards for several indus-
tries, and EPCglobal, which is speciﬁc to RFID.
By now you have learned about tags, readers, the physics of RFID, and RFID stan-
dards and regulations. Equipped with this knowledge, you are prepared to select the
design of your RFID system, which is the topic of the next chapter.

Introduction
You will design your RFID system to meet application performance requirements.
Generally speaking, RFID is a means to identify an object by using radio frequency
transmission, which suggests that communication is involved in the identiﬁcation pro-
cess.The communication takes place between a reader and a tag, which should be tuned
to the same frequency. RFID systems are available at different frequencies.To select the
right frequency for your system, you need to understand how the various performance
parameters, such as read range, tag response time, and storage capacity, depend on the
frequency.This understanding will also help you select the correct hardware components
for your RFID system, such as readers, tags, and antennas.The tags are attached to the
items that need to be identiﬁed and tracked, whereas readers will be mounted at places
from where they will read the tags.
So, the core issue in this chapter is how to design your RFID system.To put our
arms around this issue, we will explore three avenues: selecting operating frequency,
selecting hardware components, and selecting mount points for readers.
Understanding RFID Frequency Ranges
A tag and a reader use radio waves of a certain frequency, called the operating frequency, to
communicate with each other. Radio waves are electromagnetic waves that cover part of
the electromagnetic spectrum of frequencies, called the radio frequency spectrum. Because
RFID systems generate and radiate the electromagnetic waves that fall along the radio
frequency spectrum, they are justiﬁably classiﬁed as radio systems and are regulated as
such. However, other radio services have operated before the arrival of RFID systems.
Radio, television, mobile radio services (police, security services, and industry), marine
and aeronautical radio services, and mobile telephones are just a few.Therefore, it is
important to ensure that these services are not disrupted or impaired by RFID systems.
This requirement signiﬁcantly restricts the suitable operating frequency ranges for RFID
systems. For this reason, the so-called industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical (ISM) frequen-
cies, originally reserved for noncommercial uses in industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical
ﬁelds, are used for RFID systems.
Table 6.1 shows the radio frequency ranges that are of interest to RFID systems,
along with the ISM frequencies. RFID systems use many different frequencies in the
radio frequency spectrum, but there are four most commonly used radio frequency
ranges: low frequency (30–300 KHz), high frequency (3–30 MHz), ultra-high frequency
(300 MHz–3 GHz), and microwave frequencies (1–300 GHz).

Table 6.1 also shows the read range for passive tags corresponding to each frequency
range.Active tags can have a read range of up to 100 meters. For example, active tags
used on large assets such as cargo containers, rail cars, and large reusable containers,
which usually operate at 455 MHz, 2.45 GHz, or 5.8 GHz, typically have a read range
of 20 meters to 100 meters.
NOTE
Because LF RFID systems operate over short distances, interference with the sur-
roundings is less an issue. This results in the system’s increased accuracy and
security.  
As shown in Table 6.2, regulatory bodies have chosen different ranges for RFID
within the UHF band in different parts of the world. Broadly speaking, most of the
countries have allocated the RFID bands from the following three ranges:
■
Range 1: 865-868 MHz For example, the bands allocated in India and
Europe fall in this range.
■
Range 2: 902-928 MHz For example, the bands allocated in the United
States and Australia fall in this range.
■
Range 3: 950-954 MHz For example, the bands allocated in Japan fall in this
range.

Note that in Table 6.2, the permitted radiated power, expressed in units of watts, is
presented in different quantities. For example, in the United States, the radiated power is
presented by EIRP, whereas Europe tends to use ERP.As demonstrated in Exercise 6.1,
the conversion must be done between ERP and EIRP when necessary while comparing
these numbers.
CAUTION
Today, the only globally accepted radio frequency for RFID systems is 13.56
MHz, which falls in the HF band. 
EXERCISE 6.1 
Calculate the ratio of the maximum allowed power emission by an RFID system
in the United States and Europe. 
Solution:
The power allowed in the United States = 4W EIRP
The power allowed in Europe = 2 W ERP =  1.64 x 2 W EIRP = 3.28 EIRP
Ratio = U.S./Europe = 4.00 W/3.28 W = 1.22  
So, RFID systems operate in four main ranges of the radio frequency spectrum: LF,
HF, UHF, and microwave.Although the choice of frequency does not affect the under-

lying physics of how the system components will operate, it does affect the system’s per-
formance in areas such as speed, range, and accuracy.
RFID Frequency Ranges and Performance
While designing your RFID system, you will need to decide at which frequencies the
RFID devices (readers and tags) will operate.To decide wisely, you need to know the
applications’ performance requirements and how your frequency choices will impact
performance. Let’s take a close look at the way frequency ranges affect various perfor-
mance metrics.
The Low-Frequency (LF) Range
The LF range extends from 30 KHz to 300 KHz.The RFID systems in this range typi-
cally operate at ISM frequencies 125 KHz and 134 KHz. Some important characteristics
related to performance of RFID systems operating in the LF range are as follows:
■
Short read range The read range of RFID systems operating in the LF
range is short: less than half a meter.
■
Lower reading speed In general, the higher the frequency, the longer the
read range, and the higher the data transfer rate will be. Data transfer rate is
directly proportional to available bandwidth.
■
Less absorption  Because wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency,
the lower the frequency of an RFID system, the higher is the wavelength. Due
to the higher wavelength, the LF signals are not easily absorbed by the atmo-
sphere and the material they move through. For this reason, RFID systems
operating in the LF range work well around water and metal.
Due to the short read range and less absorption, LF systems are more robust to
external inﬂuences. Based on these characteristics, the following are common applica-
tions of RFID systems in the LF range:
■
Access control
■
Animal and personnel tracking
■
Vehicle immobilizers
www.syngress.com
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6
139

TIP
The bandwidth available at low frequency is very limited, which results in very
slow data transfer rates. For example, in the case of the International Standard
ISO 18000 Part 2 covering LF RFID systems, the command signaling rate
(meaning the communication speed between reader and tag) is only around 5
kbits/second.
The next step on the frequency ladder is HF.
The High-Frequency (HF) Range
The HF range extends from 3 MHz to 30 MHz. RFID systems in this range usually
operate at 13.56 MHz, which is a globally accepted frequency for RFID systems. Some
important performance-related characteristics of RFID systems operating in this range
are described in the following:
■
The read range is about 3 m.
■
Due to shorter wavelengths, the signals in this range cannot penetrate through
materials as well as the LF signals can.
■
This frequency range provides greater options in data transfer speed, compared
to LF.
Due to these characteristics, following are typical applications for RFID systems in
the HF range:
■
Building access control
■
Item-level tracking, including baggage handling
■
Libraries
Because 13.56 MHz is the globally accepted frequency standard for RFID systems,
the HF RFID systems have been more broadly adopted.
The next step on the frequency ladder is UHF.
Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Range
The UHF range extends from 300 MHz to 3 GHz.As Tables 6.1 and 6.2 show, the
actual frequencies being used by RFID systems operating in this range are 344 MHz
and 860–960 MHz.The reading speed and data transfer rate for these systems can be
high. However, systems in this range are relatively new and encounter a host of prob-
lems, some of which are described in the following:
www.syngress.com
140
Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design

■
Due to smaller wavelength, the RF energy can be easily absorbed by liquids
and matter. It can considerably reduce the reading range.
■
The high reading speed creates more probability for errors.
■
As shown in Table 6.2, countries have allocated different frequencies for RFID
systems in this range; therefore, a UHF system that works in one country
might not work in another country.
■
Many consumer devices also operate in the same frequency range; therefore,
RFID systems in this range are subject to interference with their signals.
The higher reading speed and longer read distance make these systems attractive for
the following applications:
■
Automated toll collection
■
Warehouse management 
■
Inventory tracking
The next step on the frequency ladder is the microwave frequency range.
The Microwave Range
The microwave range extends from 1 GHz to 300 GHz. RFID systems in this range
operate at ISM frequencies, 2.44 GHz and 5.80 GHz, which offer high data transfer rate.
Following are some of the characteristics of microwave RFID systems:
■
High reading speed and data transfer rate
■
Long read distance
■
Poor performance around water and metal
Due to these characteristics, the microwave RFID systems are used in the following
applications:
■
Long-range access control for vehicles
■
Vehicle identiﬁcation
■
Automated toll collection
■
Supply chain
Advantages and disadvantages of various frequency ranges and the typical RFID
applications corresponding to each range are summarized in Table 6.3. Figure 6.1 shows
how some characteristics of an RFID system depend on the frequency.

Figure 6.1 The Dependence of Some RFID System Characteristics on Frequency
In a nutshell, RFID tags and readers must be tuned to the same frequency to com-
municate with each other. Frequencies exhibit different behavior in terms of characteris-

tics that make them more useful for different applications. For example, LF tags are
cheaper than UHF tags, use less power, and are better able to penetrate through water.
Therefore, they are suitable for scanning objects with high-water content, such as fruit,
at close range. UHF systems typically offer better read range and speed and can transfer
data faster. But they use more power and are less likely to pass through materials.
Combine this information with the fact that UHF waves tend to be more “directed,”
they require a clear path between the tag and reader.These characteristics make UHF
systems more suitable for applications such as scanning boxes of goods as they pass
through a bay door into a warehouse.
The read range performance of an RFID system is an important characteristic and is
typically determined to a large extent by the following factors:
■
The power radiated by the reader, which is regulated Passive tags get
their power from the energy coming from the power radiated by the reader.
■
The operating frequency The power received by the tag’s receiver depends
on the antenna size, which in turn depends on the frequency (or wavelength)
of the received signal.
■
The sensitivity of the tag The maximum read distance depends on the tag’s
power requirements, which in turn depend on the tag type (active or passive)
and the tag’s antenna size.
■
Communication technique The read range also depends on which com-
munication technique the RFID system is using: inductive coupling or
backscattering.
Now that you understand how frequency choices impact RFID system perfor-
mance, you are well equipped to start exploring ways to select operating frequency for
your RFID system.
Selecting Operating Frequency
By now you know that RFID devices (tags and readers) are available at different fre-
quencies.You also know how different performance metrics depend on the frequency.
But how do you decide at which of these available frequencies your system should
operate? The short answer to this question is that it all depends on the application
requirements and the operating conditions.That said, following are the main factors that
you should consider in selecting operating frequency:
■
Application types Because all applications in each application type such as
retail, automatic toll collection, and animal tracking have a common set of
requirements, most application types are associated with speciﬁc frequencies.
www.syngress.com
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6
143

■
Read range Read range depends on frequency, among other factors. So, the
read range requirement of your application will give you a very good idea as
to which frequency you should select for your system.
■
Operating conditions In making a frequency selection, you should also
factor in the conditions under which your system will operate. For example, if
there is water (or water-related conditions, such as mud or snow) or metal in
the vicinity of the RFID system, LF and HF are the ideal frequency selections.
This is because LF and HF can penetrate through these materials better than
UHF and microwave frequencies can.
Now that you understand how frequency choices impact RFID system performance
and how you select the operating frequency, you are well equipped to start exploring
how to select individual components of an RFID system, such as tags.
Selecting Tags
To select the right tags for your application, you need to consider various factors such as
tag kind (tag types and tag classes), operating frequency, read range, data capacity, tag
form and size, environmental conditions under which the tags will operate, and the stan-
dards and regulations with which you need to comply. Most of these characteristics have
already been discussed in Chapter 4 and in this chapter. Here we present a brief discus-
sion regarding the role of these factors in selecting tags.
Kinds of Tag 
The kind (type and class) of tag that you select depends on the application requirements.
Following are some examples and scenarios.
■
Tag Types If the application simply requires the tag to store some data such
as identiﬁcation number and provide it on request, you can use passive tags.
However, if real-time features such as sensing the temperature and humidity
are required, you must select active tags, because your data will need real-time
processing.
■
Tag Classes Tag classes offer different features such as read only (RO), write
once and read many (WORM), and read and write (RW). If the application
requires the tag to store a unique identiﬁer that will not change and provide it
when requested, simply use RO or WORM tags. If the application requires the
tag to store dynamic data (data that is subject to change), you need RW tags.

Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design

Operating Frequency
This chapter has already discussed the frequencies available for RFID systems and how
to make the frequency selection.There are two important points to note:
■
Different frequency bands are allotted to RFID systems in different regions of
the world.
■
From the available frequencies, you need to select the right frequency for your
system based on the application requirements.The higher the frequency, the
larger the read range.
Read Performance
Read performance of a tag depends on the following factors:
■
Read range The read range is the maximum distance from which a reader
antenna can read a tag.This range is required by the application for which you
are selecting the tag. Read range is discussed in detail in Chapter 4.
■
Antenna polarization and orientation Antenna polarization and tag ori-
entation, discussed in Chapter 4 and further in this chapter, also affect read
performance. For optimal reading, tag orientation should be consistent with
antenna polarization.
■
Reading efﬁciency  The reading efﬁciency, also called read robustness, is the
ratio of the number of successful reads to the total number of read attempts.
This is the ultimate factor that needs to be optimized to improve performance.
CAUTION
It’s very easy to get carried away in maximizing the read range. But it’s really
the reading efﬁciency that you should be maximizing. The read range should
only satisfy the application requirement. Unnecessarily high read ranges may
have a negative impact on the system in terms of interference and security. 
The factors that can cause a reduction in reading efﬁciency include the following:
■
Attenuation, a decrease in the signal amplitude, caused by different product and
packaging materials (such as liquids and metals) when the signal passes through
them
www.syngress.com
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6
145

■
Presence of metal close to RFID antennas, or a large (as compared to antenna
size) mass of metal passing an antenna, which can create a mismatch between
the characteristics of the antenna and the reader
■
Radio frequency interference (RFI) from RF transmitters and electrical drives,
motors, and power supplies in the location of the RFID antenna system  
Data Capacity
The term data capacity refers to the amount of data (information) that can be stored in a
tag. Increased data capacity increases the usefulness of the tag and its cost. While
selecting the data capacity, you should consider the following factors:
■
Data amount For applications that only require the tags to store the identiﬁ-
cation number, you can simply use tags that offer minimal storage, such as class
0 tags. For applications that require more data capacity, tags with appropriate
memory can be selected accordingly.
■
Data security Some applications could require data locking to prevent tem-
pering with the tag data. Data locking can be implemented at either the hard-
ware or software level. For read-only tags, such as class 0 tags, the identiﬁer is
permanently burned into the tag and cannot be changed. WORM and RW
tags can use software locks by implementing password schemes.
Tag Form and Size
The tag form and size should be compatible with the item and the environment. For
example, the tag needs to ﬁt on the item.Tag forms and sizes are discussed in detail in
Chapter 4. Following are the two main factors that you should consider regarding the
tag form and size:
■
Tag dimensions  The dimensions of a tag should be suitable for the size and
shape of the item that needs to be tagged. For example, you should consider
the space available for the tag on the item without obstructing any critical
information printed on the product’s surface.
■
Tag ruggedness Your application could require a rugged tag to withstand
harsh environmental conditions such as corrosive chemicals, extremely high or
low temperature, humidity, and mechanical shocks.A tag can be made rugged
by enclosing it in a cover. Rugged tags are usually expensive.
www.syngress.com
146
Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design

CAUTION
Do not fold a tag to reduce its size. Folding it can detune the tag antenna,
which then can fail to receive enough power from the reader antenna and
therefore will fail to respond to the reader. 
Environmental Conditions
Environmental conditions can affect the performance of a tag and therefore the selection
of the tag for an application.You should consider the following environmental factors in
selecting tags:
■
Other objects in the neighborhood of the item to be tagged
■
Other environmental conditions, such as extreme temperature and humidity  
Standards Compliance 
You should make sure that the tags you select meet the established and emerging stan-
dards.This is important to ensure compatibility and interoperability with other systems
meeting those standards.
The two main components of an RFID system are tag and reader, and the two
should be compatible with each other. So, the process of selecting tags is tied into
selecting readers.
Selecting Readers
A reader’s job is to collect data from tags and possibly send it to an application running
on a host computer.This section discusses the factors that need to be considered in
selecting readers.
Reader Types
When selecting a reader type, consider the following characteristics:
■
Operating frequency  This chapter has already discussed the frequencies
available for RFID systems.There are two important points to note:
■
Different frequency bands are allotted to RFID systems in different regions
of the world.
■
From the available frequencies, you need to select the right frequency for
your system based on application requirements.The higher the frequency,
the larger the read range.
www.syngress.com
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6
147

■
Number of antennas Most readers support a minimum of two and a max-
imum of four antenna ports. However, a reader can have one, four, or eight
antenna ports.You cannot go wrong in simply choosing a reader with four
antenna ports because it offers better ﬂexibility in covering a wide read zone.
The number of ports you need with a reader really depends on the applica-
tion’s needs.
■
Reader interfaces  Often the reader needs to send the collected data some-
where. So the readers come with I/O controllers which support the interfaces
for sending out the collected data. Depending on the type of interface, it may
connect the reader to a host computer serially, or it may connect the reader to
a network.
■
The reader mobility Based on application requirements, you might need a
ﬁxed or a mobile reader. Mobile readers are usually wireless readers.That is,
they connect to the network using wireless technology.
Ability to Upgrade
The ability to upgrade the readers can considerably reduce the system cost in the long
run.This ability should allow you to upgrade the ﬁrmware and ﬁx bugs in it.
Installation Issues
While selecting a reader, you should also consider the installation requirements.
Following are some examples:
■
Properly installing a speciﬁc reader could require additional structure, such as a
portal that needs to be built.
■
The reader and its cable (transmission line) must not pose a risk to operations
personnel in the area.
■
The long cables to connect a reader to its antenna can attenuate the signals. If
the distance between the antenna and the reader is such that the installation
requires a cable longer than 6 feet, the cable better be of high quality and low
loss.
Legal Requirements
The maximum power that transmitter can emit is regulated in most countries. It means
that you must make sure that the selected readers comply with those regulations. It also
means that you should not tamper with the features of the readers that comply with the
regulations.

Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design

Manageability
Depending on the application requirements, you might need a reader that can be man-
aged remotely, for example, using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).This
gives you the advantage of tracking, diagnosing, and ﬁxing errors remotely, without
manually visiting the site.
Quantity
You will also need to determine how many readers you will need for your application.
This number will depend on the following:
■
Number of read zones
■
Number of reader antennas required for each zone
■
Number of antenna portals on each reader 
Ruggedness
Your application could require rugged packaging to withstand harsh environmental con-
ditions such as corrosive chemicals, extremely high or low temperature, humidity, and
mechanical shocks.A reader can be made rugged by enclosing it in a cover. Rugged tags
are usually expensive.
By now, you have a very good idea of how to select tags and readers. Both tags and
readers have antennas, which we’ll examine next.
Working with Antennas
In general, an antenna is any structure or device used to receive or radiate electromag-
netic waves.As you already know, both tags and readers have their own antennas.You
need to select appropriate antennas for your RFID system because they come in various
types and conﬁgurations. Before selecting an antenna, you should understand the
antenna types.
Understanding Antenna Types
This section discusses the common antenna types listed in the following:
■
Monopole antenna
■
Dipole antenna
■
Linearly polarized antenna
■
Circularly polarized antenna

Channel A single path provided by a transmission medium.This path may be
provided by a cable or by a speciﬁc frequency.
■
Source An object that encodes the  message data and transmits it via a
channel to one or more receivers.
■
Driven element The single antenna that has an applied source feed.
■
Ground plane An electrically conductive surface that serves as the reﬂection
point near an antenna or as a reference ground in a circuit.
Dipole Antennas
A dipole antenna is an antenna with a center-fed driven element for transmitting or
receiving radio frequency energy. From a physics viewpoint, this type of antenna is the
simplest practical antenna. It consists of a straight electric conductor, made of conducting
metal such as copper, interrupted at the center, therefore making two poles.As shown in
Figure 6.2, the category of dipole antennas can be further subdivided as into the fol-
lowing:
■
Half-wavelength dipole The total length of this antenna is half the wave-
length corresponding to the frequency to be used. It optimizes the transfer of
power between the tag and the reader.
■
Quarter-wavelength dipole The total length of this antenna is a quarter the
wavelength corresponding to the frequency to be used. It uses the reﬂective
ground plane that provides an image of the antenna to complete the dipole.
■
Dual dipole antenna As the name suggests, a dual dipole antenna consists of
two dipoles. It covers more area and therefore reduces the sensitivity of a tag’s
orientation.
■
Folded dipole antenna This antenna consists of two or more straight elec-
tric conductors that are connected in parallel, and each electric conductor is
half the wavelength corresponding to the frequency to be used.

Figure 6.2 Various Kinds of Dipole Antenna
Monopole Antennas
A monopole antenna is a type of dipole antenna formed by replacing one half of the
dipole antenna with the ground plane at a right angle to the remaining half. If the
ground plane is large enough, the monopole behaves exactly like a dipole because its
reﬂection in the ground plane forms the missing half of the dipole.The most common
example of a monopole antenna is a whip antenna, which is basically a stiff but ﬂexible
wire, usually mounted vertically.
Linearly Polarized Antenna
As you know, as a wave travels, there are variations (or vibrations) in the wave, such as
variations in electric ﬁeld or magnetic ﬁeld of an EM wave.As described in Chapter 1,
the variations of electric and magnetic ﬁelds (vectors) in an EM wave are in a plane per-
pendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. If the variations are such that the
electric ﬁeld vector stays parallel to a line in space as the wave travels, the wave is said to
be linearly polarized, and the antenna that transmits such a wave is called a linearly
polarized antenna. Because magnetic ﬁeld (perpendicular to electric ﬁeld) will also stay
parallel to a line in space, this ﬁxes the plane of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld vectors.
Therefore, linear polarization is also called plane polarization. The following two kinds
of linear polarization are of special interest:
■
Horizontal polarization This is the linear polarization in which the wave
travels horizontal to the surface of the Earth.

Length =  1/2 Wavelength
Dipole Antenna
Length =  1/2 Wavelength
Dual Dipole Antenna
Length =  1/2 Wavelength
Folded Dipole Antenna
Quarter Wavelength Dipole Antenna

■
Vertical polarization This is the linear polarization in which the wave
travels perpendicular to the surface of the Earth.
NOTE
Horizontally polarized waves (signals) travel parallel to Earth’s surface, whereas
perpendicularly polarized waves travel perpendicular to the surface of Earth. If
you look carefully at TV antennas, you will ﬁnd that most of them have rods
about a meter in length set horizontal to the earth’s surface. That means that
the carrier waves for TV are polarized horizontally—that is, the electric vector is
horizontal, the magnetic vector is vertical, and both lie in a plane perpendicular
to the direction of propagation of the wave. So, antennas are set broadside to
the direction of propagation of the wave.
A linearly polarized antenna emits a narrow radiation beam that increases the read
range of a tag. However, a linearly polarized antenna of a reader is sensitive to the tag
orientation with respect to polarization.Therefore, this type of antenna is useful for
applications in which the tag orientation is ﬁxed and known (predictable). Dipole
antennas are linearly polarized.
Circularly Polarized Antennas
A traveling EM wave is said to be circularly polarized if the electric ﬁeld vector rotates in
a circle as the wave travels.The antenna that emits circularly polarized waves is called a cir-
cularly polarized antenna. A circularly polarized signal contains horizontal and vertical com-
ponents.Therefore, a circularly polarized reader antenna is largely unaffected by tag
orientation. For example, if the tag is oriented to receive horizontally polarized waves and
the reader antenna is emitting circularly polarized waves, the tag will still receive the hori-
zontal component of the signal power. For this reason, a circularly polarized reader antenna
is preferred in applications in which the tag orientation is unknown or unpredictable.
Omnidirectional Antennas
An omnidirectional antenna is a nondirectional antenna that radiates power uniformly in all
directions.An ideally perfect omnidirectional antenna is also called an isotropic antenna,
which is really a theoretical antenna used as a reference to calculate quantities such as
antenna gain and effective radiated power (ERP). Practically speaking, the antennas can
provide omnidirectionality in one plane, such as in a horizontal plane—that is, the plane
parallel to the surface of the Earth.

Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design

Helical Antennas
As shown in Figure 6.3, a helical antenna is an antenna that consists of a conducting wire
wound in the form of a helix.A helical antenna is an example of a circularly polarized
antenna. Note the following about helical antennas:
■
The length of the antenna coil determines the antenna gain.
■
The diameter of the antenna coil determines its wavelength.
■
Because helical antennas are circularly polarized antennas, they can receive sig-
nals with any type of polarization, such as linear, horizontally linear, or verti-
cally linear.
■
A helical antenna can be clockwise polarized or anticlockwise polarized.
Clockwise polarized antennas will have poor antenna gain when receiving a
signal that is anticlockwise polarized.
Figure 6.3 Helical Antennas
These antennas are best suited for applications such as animal tracking and space
communication, where the orientation of the sender and receiver cannot be easily con-
trolled or where the signal’s polarization may change over time.
Selecting Antennas 
When selecting antennas, you should consider the following factors:
■
Footprints The footprint of an antenna is the ground area over which the
antenna delivers a speciﬁed amount of signal power under speciﬁed conditions.
That means a tag placed within the footprint of a reader’s antenna can be read
by the antenna. Because RFID antennas are mostly directional, the footprint of
an antenna is rarely symmetrical around the antenna.You can use a device such
as a spectrum analyzer to determine the actual footprint map of an antenna.
■
Polarization Remember the following two things about polarization:
www.syngress.com
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6
153

■
If the tag orientation is arbitrary, unknown, or unpredictable, use circularly
polarized antennas, because circularly polarized waves have both horizontal
and vertical components.That means that if the antennas are circularly
polarized, there will always be a transfer of some amount of power
between the reader and the tag antennas, regardless of the tag orientation.
■
If the tag orientation with respect to the antennas is known, use a linear
antenna to receive the maximum power and thereby increase the read
range.
■
Standards and regulations  You should be aware of the standards and regu-
lations regarding the characteristics of RFID systems in your region of the
world, such as the allowed operating frequency and the allowed maximum
power to be emitted by the antenna.This is important for two reasons: to obey
the law of the land and to be compatible with the environment.
The source of a reader that generates the signal is connected to the antenna through
a transmission line.
Selecting Transmission Lines 
In an RFID system, a transmission line is a physical medium (say a cable) used to con-
nect the signal source to the antenna.The optimal transmission line would be the one
that transfers the energy (power) from the source to the antenna with minimum power
loss. When selecting a transmission line, you should be aware of the characteristics dis-
cussed in this section.
Impedance
You learned in Chapter 2 what impedance is and how an impedance mismatch between
antenna and transmission line will create a reﬂected wave, which will result in decreased
system efﬁciency. For optimal results, you must match the input impedance of the
antenna with the characteristic impedance of the transmission line.
Cable Length and Loss
When you’re choosing the physical length of a transmission line, keep in mind its
electrical length, which is its length expressed as a multiple (or submultiple) of the
wavelength of the signal that will propagate through it. Consider a cable that will
transmit a signal of 3 GHz.The wavelength corresponding to 3 GHz is 10 cm. Now
consider a 4 m cable. If the electrical length of the cable is expressed in units of l/4, the
electrical length of this cable = 400/(10/4) = 160 units. So, the transmission line in this
case is electrically too long.The longer the line, the greater will be the power loss.
www.syngress.com
154
Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design

Now consider a signal of 30 KHz propagating through the same transmission line.
As shown in Exercise 6.2, this line is electrically too short for this signal.
EXERCISE 6.2 
Calculate the electrical length of a 4 m cable in units of ?/4. The signal transmits
a 30 KHz signal.
Solution:
λc/f  = (3x108 m/s ) / (30000 1/s) = 10, 000 m
So, the electrical length of the 4 m cable in units of quarter of a wavelength
will be 4 / (10,000 / 4) = 0.0016. Therefore, this cable is too short for a signal
of this frequency.
Transmission Line Types
The cable types most commonly used to form a transmission line are the following:
■
Coaxial cable This cable consists of two coaxial conductors separated by a
plastic insulating material.The inner conductor is a copper wire surrounded by
the outer conductor, which is a braided wire jacket, a copper mesh.The outer
conductor is then shielded with an insulating material.This cable type is useful
to transmit low-amplitude signals because it can protect (shield) the signal from
external interference.This is because the electromagnetic ﬁeld carrying the
signal exists only in the space between the outer and the inner signal. So the
signal is shielded from external interference, which results in low loss.
Following are the advantages of this cable type:
■
Low loss 
■
Can be used to efﬁciently transmit low-amplitude signals
■
Useful for frequencies up to 3 GHz
■
Shielded pair cable This cable consists of two parallel conducting wires
embedded in solid dielectric material, which is surrounded by braided copper
tubing, which in turn is surrounded by a rubber cover.The braided copper
tubing acts as an electrical shield against external electromagnetic interference.
The rubber cover protects the line from mechanical damage and moisture.
So, a reader has a source, a transmission line, and an antenna.The reader needs to be
mounted at a place from where it will read the tags.

Mounting Equipment for RFID Systems
Tags attached to items carry information about the items.These tags need to be read by
readers to retrieve the information.An RFID portal is the area where RFID tags can be
read or written to.The portals can be grouped into two categories:
■
Stationary portals These are the portals on which readers are mounted at a
predetermined ﬁxed place and wait for the tags to pass through their interro-
gation zone.This kind of portal is used in applications in which the path of the
items containing tags is predetermined, such as along a conveyor.
■
Mobile portals These are the portals in which readers are moved around to
read the tags. Such portals are useful for applications in which the tagged items
do not travel a predetermined path.
The common candidate portal points for mounting your RFID system are the 
following:
■
Conveyer
■
Dock door
■
Forklift
■
Point of sale
■
Smart shelf
■
Stretch wrap station
These portal points are discussed in the following sections.
Conveyors
Conveyors are used for case-level tracking—for example, in airports.To achieve the
optimal results, multiple reader antennas should be used. Reader antennas are often
mounted on gantries placed around the conveyor, as shown in Figure 6.4.The reader
antennas on each side of the gantry will cover four faces of the container.
www.syngress.com
156
Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design

Figure 6.4 The Front View of a Conveyor Portal
For optimal reading, consider the following factors in selecting a conveyor:
■
The conveyor belt and the roller for the conveyor at the read point should be
made of RF-friendly material, not of metal.
■
The speed of the conveyor belt should adjusted for optimal tag reading.
Conveyors are good for case-level reading, whereas dock doors are suitable for
pallet-level reading.
Dock Doors
A dock is a platform on which trucks or trains load or unload cargo. Keep in mind that
the portal readers on a dock door might have to work in the presence of other elec-
tronic devices such as detectors and RF-reﬂective surfaces such as metal mesh. For
example, the metal mesh surrounding the doorway could prevent reading of the tags
going through adjoining doors.
In general, a door portal does not necessarily have to have a physical door.The term
door portal, in general, refers to a vehicle carrying items in transit from one area to a dif-
ferent area. For example, when a truck parks and unloads at a dock door, items are
stored or retrieved through a causeway, and a vehicle (mobile equipment) passes through
the interior of racking aisles. Depending on the nature of the door portal (application),
antennas can be mounted in various conﬁgurations. For example, multiple antennas are
used in an array on both sides of the door to form the interrogation zone. When a

Container

transport vehicle such as a cart, a clamp truck, or a hand pallet truck passes through this
interrogation zone, the door portal will read the tags attached to the items on the
vehicle.
In setting up a door portal, you should consider the following:
■
Your conﬁguration of reader antennas should be able to cover (in reading) an
area about 3 meters high and about 3 meters wide.
■
The antennas need to be arranged in a sequence (that is, in an array) on each
side of the door to form an effective interrogation zone.
■
It is important to meet the minimum effective power level across the surface of
the interrogation zone.
■
In the case of a motion-triggered portal, the readers must be turned on in a
timely fashion so that they can read in the minimum effective duration.
An alternative to a door portal is a forklift.
Forklifts
A forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and transport  loads of materials by
means of steel forks inserted under the load.A forklift is most commonly used to move
a load stored on a pallet.These are especially well suited for reading tags from items on a
pallet due their mobility and ﬂexibility.The forklift can be connected to vehicle-
mounted, data-collecting computers to inventory items efﬁciently. Following, however,
are the disadvantages of mounting antennas on a forklift:
■
A forklift-based reading system requires manual intervention from an operator.
■
The communication devices used by forklift operators can cause RF interfer-
ence and affect the readability of tags.
■
Metallic forks can reﬂect RF signals from the RFID system and therefore
could prevent reading of some tags.
■
The speed of the forklift can also affect readability.
Stretch Wrap Stations
A stretch wrap has containers sitting on a turntable, which continuously changes the loca-
tion and orientation of the tags.This is what makes a wrap station an attractive portal for
reader antennas. Because of the turntable, the reader antenna has two advantages:
■
As the pallet spins, it can make multiple attempts to read a tag.
■
It gets opportunities to read tags in various orientations.
www.syngress.com
158
Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design

Because a stretch wrap station is usually the ﬁnal step before shipping, an RFID
system at this place guarantees the integrity of the containers.
Item-level tracking can be done at the point of sale.
Point-of-Sale Systems
An RFID point-of-sale (POS) system consists of scanning and payment capabilities.The
RFID scanning technology used in POS systems can scan a whole shopping cart of
goods or a basket full of items, say grocery items, in a few seconds. Here is how it
works:As a customer pushes her cart to a designated checkout area, the readers mounted
in the area collect the information about the products and their quantity in the cart.The
readers send the information to the payment system, which displays the amount to be
paid.The customer, at this point, can cancel the transaction or make payment through a
credit or debit card.This payment transaction feature is built into the POS system.
Following are the beneﬁts offered by the RFID POS system:
■
Cost saving by eliminating the need for cash counter operators
■
All stock-related store records can be updated in real time by taking feed from
the RFID system.
■
The possibility of shoplifting is reduced because all items going out of the
shop can be tracked by appropriately setting up the checkout areas.
■
Stock can be replenished efﬁciently by examining stock-out reports any time.
In addition to point of sale, retailers might also need to keep track of items on the
shelves.
Smart Shelf
A smart shelf is a shelf that has readers mounted on it to read tags on the items on the
shelf. When a customer picks up a tagged item from the shelf, the reader can no longer
read the tag of this item, and this information ﬂows to the inventory system, which
assumes that the item has been removed from the shelf. Depending on its features and
conﬁguration, the inventory system might take further action, such as notifying store
personnel to put more items on the shelf to avoid an out-of-stock situation. Here are
some advantages of a smart-shelf system:
■
Efﬁciently notiﬁes store personnel of misplaced items
■
Helps reduce out-of-stock situations
■
Helps maintain better efﬁciency in inventory management
■
Helps determine the sale potential of an item in a timely fashion
www.syngress.com
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6
159

Looking at the other side of the coin, following are the disadvantages of a smart-
shelf system:
■
Because a smart-shelf system uses stationary readers and tracks individual items,
lots of readers and tags would be needed.Therefore, cost becomes a signiﬁcant
factor to consider.
■
Multiple reader antennas required in the same shelf could introduce overlap-
ping interrogation zones and therefore interference of signals.
■
If the items are densely packed on a shelf, stationary readers could miss some
items, resulting in inventory issues.
The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■
Read range and read speed increase with increase in frequency, whereas the
passive tag size and ability to read near water or metal decrease with increase in
frequency.
■
Operating frequency, read performance, ruggedness, compliance with standards,
operating conditions, and ability to upgrade are some main factors considered
in selecting hardware components such as tags and readers.
■
The selection of an RFID portal (where readers will be mounted) depends on
the type of tracking (case level or item level) and the application.The goal is to
maximize read performance.

Chapter 6 • Selecting the RFID System Design

Summary
You’ll want to design your RFID system to meet application performance requirements.
The task of designing your RFID system includes selecting the operating frequency;
selecting hardware components such as readers, tags, and antennas; and selecting portals
where the readers will be mounted to read the tags.
The three main factors that help you select the operating frequency for your RFID
system are application type, required read range, and operating conditions. Some main
factors considered in selecting readers and tags are operating frequency, read perfor-
mance, ruggedness, compliance with standards, operating conditions, and ability to
upgrade.The selection of an RFID portal (where readers will be mounted) depends on
the type of tracking (case level or item level) and the application.The goal here is to
maximize read performance. Some examples of pallet-level read portals are dock doors
and forklifts, whereas an example of a portal for case-level reading is a conveyor. Some
examples of item-level portals are smart shelves and POS systems.
After you select the operating frequency for your RFID system, you will need to
identify the potential sources of interference around this frequency. In other words, your
design is not ﬁnal until you do a site analysis, which we’ll discuss in the next chapter.
Exam’s Eye View
Comprehend
■
Frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional to each other; in other
words, with an increase in frequency, the wavelength decreases.
■
In general, with an increase in operating frequency, the read range increases.
■
The read range of active tags is higher than that of passive tags.
■
Do not unnecessarily use higher-frequency devices, and do not unnecessarily
increase the maximum read distance, because higher frequencies and larger
read distances are more vulnerable to interference with the surroundings,
which will impede performance.
■
Due to the higher wavelength, LF signals are not easily absorbed by the
atmosphere and the material they move through. For this reason, RFID
systems operating in the LF range work well around water and metal.
■
The three main factors that help you select the operating frequency for your
RFID system are application type, required read range, and operating
conditions.
www.syngress.com
Selecting the RFID System Design • Chapter 6
161

Look Out
■
The only globally accepted radio frequency for RFID systems is 13.56 MHz,
which falls in the HF band.
■
Due to the short read range and less absorption, the LF systems are more
robust to external inﬂuences.
■
A circularly polarized reader antenna is preferred in applications in which the
tag orientation is unknown or unpredictable, whereas linearly polarized
antennas are useful for applications in which the tag orientation is ﬁxed and
known.
Memorize
■
For applications that require reading the tags from a close proximity of a few
centimeters to less than a meter (a few inches to less than 3 feet), use LF (125
or 134 KHz) or HF (13.56 MHz) RFID devices (tags and readers).
■
Read range and read speed increase with an increase in frequency, whereas the
passive tag size and ability to read near water or metal decrease with an
increase in frequency.
■
Read range depends on operating frequency, tag type (active or passive),
communication technique (inductive coupling or backscattering), and radiated
power.
■
Most readers support a minimum of two and a maximum of four antenna
ports.
■
Two cable types commonly used as transmission lines in RFID systems are
coaxial cable and shielded pair cable.
■
Conveyors are used for case-level tracking, whereas dock doors and forklifts are
good for pallet-level reading.

Performing Site Analysis
Chapter 7
RFID+
167

Introduction
The RFID system that you are designing will most probably be installed in an already
existing infrastructure that contains other systems and devices.You need to determine
how this RFID system will ﬁt into that existing site infrastructure. For this reason, a site
analysis is required before you ﬁnalize the RFID system design and before you install
the RFID system.To aid you in this task, you can use a blueprint to visualize the site’s
physical infrastructure.You will need to analyze the site’s physical infrastructure and RF
environment to ﬁnd appropriate locations for the interrogation zones or to mark the
planned interrogation zones.
The main goal of the site analysis is to ensure that the interrogation zones will func-
tion properly, with maximum performance and without interrupting the existing ser-
vices. Depending on the situation, you could have no freedom in choosing these zones,
full freedom in choosing these zones, or somewhere in between these two extremes.
Even if you have no freedom in choosing a zone, there could still be a degree of
freedom to decide where exactly in the zone you will mount the reader antenna. So,
regardless of how much freedom you have to determine the location of interrogation
zones, a site analysis will be useful and required.
So, the core question in this chapter is: How can we perform a successful site anal-
ysis? In search of an answer, we will explore three avenues: performing physical environ-
mental analysis, performing RF environmental analysis, and documenting and using our
ﬁndings.
Planning the Site Analysis 
Due to its very nature, an RFID system is almost always installed in an already existing
infrastructure that contains other systems and devices.The purpose of the site analysis is
to determine how your RFID system will ﬁt into an already existing world at the site.
To ensure that all aspects of the site analysis are addressed and to optimize your results,
treat your site analysis like a project and therefore plan it. Planning a site analysis
includes determining what this analysis will include and what will be its deliverables.
Plan the Steps Ahead 
So, what is involved in performing a site analysis? This might slightly depend on the site
and the requirements of the RFID system that will be installed. However, in general,
your site analysis will include the following steps:
1.
Plan blueprints Arrange the blueprints, which are basically the site diagrams
that you will need to visualize the site infrastructure.You will also develop (or
modify) blueprints at the end of your project to include your ﬁndings. So,
blueprints are input to the site analysis project, and they are also the project
deliverables.

2.
Inspect the site Inspecting the site includes walking through the site and
making observations for physical and electrical environmental analysis—for
example, taking notes on any potential obstructions that can reﬂect or block
the RF signal.
3.
Determine interrogation zones  This involves determining the spots
where you can mount readers for reading tags.This step will help you avoid
installing expensive readers or antennas at places where they will not be effec-
tive or where they will not be needed. If the location for an interrogation zone
is already ﬁxed, you will need to determine where exactly in that location you
will install the reader antenna.
4.
Document your results  You will document the results of your site analysis
in reports and in the form of blueprints.These are the deliverables of your site
analysis project.
If you want to hit the ground running, you need to understand what blueprints are.
Understanding Blueprints 
The ﬁrst step of a site survey is to obtain the facility diagram, also called a blueprint.A
blueprint, in general, is any plan that documents an architecture or an engineering
design.A site blueprint helps you visualize the big picture of the site infrastructure. It
will help you make a preliminary determination of where you can possibly set up the
interrogation zones.Typically, standard symbols are used on the blueprint to represent
various items. Figures 7.1 and 7.2 show very simple examples of a warehouse blueprint
and some electrical and telecom symbols commonly used in blueprints.
The blueprint will give you the preliminary idea about the locations that you want
to avoid while setting up interrogator zones, such as metallic material, and the things
that you can use, such as breakout boxes, circuit breakers, and power drops.You also need
to consider power availability, backup power source, availability of dedicated power cir-
cuits, and location of power outlets.
So, the blueprint shows you what physical infrastructure is in place. But it’s only the
starting point. Next, you need to visit the facility and analyze the physical environment
of the site.

Performing a 
Physical Environmental Analysis 
Mounting interrogators and thereby setting up interrogation zones is an important task
in deploying an RFID system.The interrogator zones are set up in a physical space.
Therefore, you ﬁrst want to analyze the physical environment in which you are going to
set up the interrogation zones.The physical environment that you are concerned with
may consist of hindering characteristics or objects, such as extreme temperatures, mois-
ture, high-power machinery, metallic equipment, and lighting ﬁxtures.To perform the
physical environmental analysis, you might need to consider various physical conditions
described in the following sections.
Harsh Environmental Conditions
While setting up interrogation zones, you should consider harsh environmental condi-
tions, including corrosive chemicals, extremely high or low temperature, humidity, and
mechanical shocks, which can damage tags. Moisture and water contents can absorb RF
signals emitted by readers and tags.
Physical Obstructions
A physical obstruction is an object that blocks the communication path between an
interrogator and a reader. Examples of physical obstructions are beams, equipment, prod-
ucts, and electric motors. Depending on the nature of the physical obstruction, it can
create adverse effects such as absorption, reﬂection, scattering, and interference.
Metallic Material
Metallic objects reﬂect RF signals, and that reﬂection can cause interference with the
incident signal.You need to keep metallic objects such as casings outside the interroga-
tion zones.The metallic parts of the RF system itself will also reﬂect RF energy.The
solutions are to not choose the metallic part when you have an option and to create air
gaps or use nonmetallic spacers to separate the metal.You might also need to adjust the
distance between a reader and a tag to avoid the reﬂection effect.
TIP
All antennas and interrogators are securely mounted with the appropriate hard-
ware. You must consider adverse effects such as reﬂection and interference
while you’re selecting the hardware to hold the equipment. For example, avoid
using metal brackets.
www.syngress.com
Performing Site Analysis • Chapter 7
171

Packaging
Given its nature, packaging can absorb, reﬂect, or scatter RF energy and thereby hamper
the performance of an RFID system.
Cabling
You should make sure that the power and network cables will stay away from the inter-
rogator zones, to avoid some adverse effects such as noise and interference.
Electrostatic Discharge
Electrostatic discharge, or ESD, is the instantaneous electric current created by the ﬂow of
electrons from a high-density (of electrons) surface to a low-density surface—for
example, when the two surfaces rub against each other. ESD could gradually degrade
(damage) a system component. In the environment of an RFID system, the common
sources of ESD include belts, conveyors, rollers, paper handling, and striping labels from
rolls. ESD can damage the transistors in a tag’s IC, thereby causing the tag to malfunc-
tion. ESD can also damage the interrogator’s IC, especially if the interrogator is not
properly grounded.
EXERCISE 7.1
You are tagging the metallic by attaching tags to them. You know that the
metallic surface will reﬂect the RF signal. What can you do to improve the per-
formance? 
Solution:
You can separate the metal from the tag by placing nonmetallic spacers
that will create air gaps between the tags and the metallic surface. This can
improve performance by increasing the read range.
You have visited the site and have recorded all the elements in the physical environ-
ment relevant to your system.This is important. But the real enemy is still lurking in the
air: the RF waves waiting to attack your RFID system in the form of noise and interfer-
ence.
Performing an RF Environmental Analysis
The RF environmental analysis includes identifying the sources of EM noise and inter-
ference that can hamper the performance of the proposed RFID system.The increasing
use of EM waves to communicate has revolutionized communication capabilities and
www.syngress.com
172
Chapter 7 • Performing Site Analysis

options to include cordless communication devices, satellite communication systems, and
wireless networks. Looking at the other side of the coin, the increase in EM radiation in
the environment can cause these waves to interfere with each other, which will disrupt
operations and services.The purpose of the RF environmental analysis is to identify the
potential sources of interference at and around the selected operating frequency of the
proposed RFID system. If these sources stay unidentiﬁed and therefore the resulting
problems unsolved, the interference will disrupt the communication between the readers
and the tags, and it will consume lots of your time and resources to troubleshoot the
problems of the running system.
The purpose of the RF environmental analysis is twofold:
■
Eliminate any interference inside the interrogation zone.
■
Ensure that the RFID system (tags and interrogators) will not interfere with
the existing RF systems on the site.
TIP
If you are a beginner, consider accepting the help of an experienced RF engineer
in performing the RF site survey. After going through trials and errors during
multiple surveys, you will start feeling comfortable with doing it yourself. 
Interference can have adverse effect on the following characteristics of an RFID
system:
■
Read speed
■
Accuracy of communication
■
Read range
You are looking for the EM systems on the site that can generate signals (or noise)
in or around the same frequency range as that of the proposed RFID system and
thereby cause signal interference.To deal with these electrical environmental conditions,
you need to perform the following tasks:
■
Identify the interference sources.
■
Understand different interference types.
■
Determine the ambient noise.
■
Analyze these electrical environmental conditions.
■
Design solutions for the discovered problems.
www.syngress.com
Performing Site Analysis • Chapter 7
173

All these tasks are explained in the following sections. First, to identify the sources of
this interference, you need to perform a site test before deploying the RFID system.This
site test is called a site assessment or site survey.
Planning a Site Survey
Following are the apparatus that you will need to perform a successful site survey:
■
A blueprint or a computer-aided drawing (CAD) drawing to visualize the site
infrastructure
■
An antenna that will cover 360 degrees of RF ﬁeld, such as a half-wavelength
dipole antenna
■
A spectrum analyzer to measure noise and interfering signals
■
A portable computer such as a laptop to record the collected data
■
Two stands, such as tripod stands, to support the antennas
■
A cart on which you can move your testing equipment around the site
Interference can come from a variety of sources.You should be aware of the types of
interference that can come from the environment to impair the communication
between readers and tags (or any RF communication, for that matter). Following are the
common types of such interference:
■
Adjacent channel interference This is the interference from a signal with a
frequency close to the operating frequency of the RFID system. So, this is the
interference between two frequency channels (bands).
■
Band congestion interference This is the interference resulting from the
overcrowding of  a given frequency band—that is, too many devices operating
within a shared frequency band.
■
Environmental interference This is the interference from natural sources of
EM radiation, such as lightning and solar radiation.
■
Jamming This is the interference or the noise caused by an intentional emis-
sion of radiation by another device or system.This is done to limit the effec-
tiveness of the other communications or detection equipment. For example,
cellular phone jammers are used in locations where a phone call will be dis-
ruptive, such as in libraries and movie theaters.
■
Spurious emissions interference Spurious emissions are the interfering
radiation transmitted outside the operating frequency band in the form of nar-
rowband signals or wideband noise. One example of spurious emissions is the
emission of harmonics at multiples of fundamental frequency.
www.syngress.com
174
Chapter 7 • Performing Site Analysis

NOTE
The harmonic of a wave is a component frequency of the signal that is an
integer multiple of the fundamental frequency.
To fully estimate the risk and impact of the RF environment, knowledge of the
ambient noise is of particular importance.
Determining the Ambient EM Noise
The ambient EM noise (AEN) is the EM noise existing at a given location, such as a
compartment, a room, or a particular outdoor location.AEN is generated by electrical
devices such as infrared scanners, real-time location systems (RTLS), and alarm motion
detectors.The AEN is measured in dB relative to some reference value—for example,
the average power.
NOTE
The term ambient refers to the immediate surroundings of something. It comes
from the French word ambiant and its roots go further back, to Latin. 
The AEN can be measured by using a device called spectrum analyzer, which in gen-
eral is used to examine the spectral composition of a an EM wave. Figure 7.3 shows an
example of output from a spectrum analyzer: the Agilent 89600 Vector Signal Analyzer, a
sophisticated device that displays the overall RF spectrum as well as the analyses of its
various aspects.You can use a spectrum analyzer to perform the following tasks:
■
Identify the source of RF interference.
■
Measure the RF output from circuits, devices, and instruments.
■
Measure the distortion, harmonic content, modulation quality, and noise.
■
Display signal interference if it overlaps the intended signal.

175

Analyzer (Image Courtesy of Agilent Technologies, Inc.)
So, in general, you can use a spectrum analyzer to analyze the electrical (RF) envi-
ronmental conditions and estimate their effect on the system variables, including the fol-
lowing:
■
Antenna size
■
Composition of the tagged object
■
Operating frequency
■
Power emitted by the interrogator
What should be the overall strategy to analyze the electrical environmental condi-
tions, or the RF environment of the site?
www.syngress.com
176
Chapter 7 • Performing Site Analysis

Analyzing the Electrical 
Environmental Conditions
Performing an analysis of the electrical environmental conditions—that is, RF environ-
mental analysis—includes the following:
■
Identify the AEN.
■
Measure the strength of interfering signals and noise.You need to identify
these sources of interference and collect data with the help of a spectrum ana-
lyzer over a full operational business cycle, which typically is a minimum of 24
to 48 hours.This analysis, which is called a full Faraday cycle analysis (FFCA),
will tell you what frequencies will cause the most problems when you operate
your RFID system in your facility.
■
Map the interrogation zones to the site drawings, such as blueprints, and
ensure that these zones are noise free.
■
After you identify a device that might create EM noise, turn on this device
and measure and record the results in the interrogation zone nearby.
NOTE
To capture the RF signal, you can place an antenna in the middle of the interro-
gation zone and connect it to the input of the spectrum analyzer.
So, you have performed a site survey to identify the sources of interference and
AEN, and you have estimated the effect of interference on the system variables. What
will you do next?
Protecting the RFID 
System from Interference and Noise
Once you know that your system will have interference (or noise) problems, you can
start designing the solutions.To eliminate or minimize the effects of interference, you
can consider implementing the following solutions:
■
Remove the source of interference If it is possible to remove the source
of interference, go ahead and do it. For example, it might be possible to ensure
that a forklift or an electronic scale causing the interference does not operate
in the interrogation zone.
www.syngress.com
Performing Site Analysis • Chapter 7
177

■
Shield the source or RFID system You can shield the RFID system or
components to protect them from intentional or accidental interference, or
you can shield the source of interference.
■
Use ﬁlters You can use ﬁlters, which permit only selected frequencies to pass
through a connected device by rejecting all other frequencies.
■
Avoid grounding loops  A grounding point is used to ensure the safety of
the equipment and the operator. It also provides immunity to interference and
noise. However, a grounding point can create a loop condition, which will
cause energy transfer back to the connected devices and thereby interference
and noise.This can be avoided by ensuring that a loop condition does not
exist—for example, by ensuring that the conductor used for grounding is short
enough.
Just like any other project, the site analysis is not complete without its deliverables.
One of the deliverables of this project will be your own blueprint, or site diagram, con-
taining the RF information useful for the installation of the RFID system.
Preparing Your Own Blueprints 
You started from a blueprint, inspected the site to observe the physical and electrical
environment, and at the end the whole survey will narrow down to the interrogation
zones. In other words, after performing the physical and electrical site survey, you need
to make some tests on the planned interrogation zones.You should record your results in
your own site blueprint and in a report.These results will be used during installation of
your RFID system.
Let the Experiment Begin
Consider a scenario in which you want to determine the coverage areas of antennas
(interrogation zones) at various locations inside a warehouse.Typically, a warehouse will
have dock doors, metal shelves, a stockroom with liquid and metallic material, trailers,
and walls.All these obstacles affect the RF signal in different ways and different amounts,
which are not known in advance. So, tests are necessary to determine the RF coverage
pattern near these places.
Perform the following steps to measure the RF coverage areas for the reader
antenna at different spots in the warehouse:
1.
Choose a spot and set up an antenna for which the coverage area needs to be
measured.
2.
Use a spectrum analyzer to measure the strength of the signal emitted by the
antenna.Take readings at several points in the same direction, starting from
near the antenna and gradually moving away from it.
www.syngress.com
178
Chapter 7 • Performing Site Analysis

3.
Make sure you record your readings.You will note that the signal strength
decreases with an increase in distance from the antenna.
4.
When you move far enough so that the signal strength is below a useful level,
mark that point.
5.
Repeat Steps 2 through 4 as many times as necessary to take readings in dif-
ferent directions of interest.These readings will mark the interrogation zone
around the antenna.
6.
Repeat Steps 1 through 5 as many times as necessary to mark the coverage
areas (interrogation zones) at different spots.
You may be testing the spots (for coverage area) near the ofﬁce areas, trolleys, and
metal shelves; and you will observe the effects. Record your results into the site
blueprint by showing the locations—for example, with the following coverage grading:
■
Maximum coverage
■
Minimum coverage
■
Intermediate coverage
You will notice that the signal coverage area will decrease around spots near
obstructions, such as metallic equipment.
Once you have determined the location of an interrogator zone, you can perform
on it what is called path loss contour mapping (PLCM) by performing path loss contour anal-
ysis (PLCA). PLCA is the process of determining how the ﬁeld strength and shape of
the RF coverage in an interrogation zone varies. In other words, PLCA data has the
information about how the RF signals (waves) are degraded and distorted and how the
wavefront (the shape of coverage) changes throughout the interrogation zone. PLCM is
the process of preparing a blueprint that maps the PLCA data.The PCLA helps deter-
mining the following deployment variables:
■
The location of the antenna in the interrogation zone
■
Antenna alignment
■
Setting of the emitted power
So, PCLM is used to ﬁne-tune and conﬁgure a given interrogation zone for optimal
performance, whereas FFCA is used to locate an interrogation zone.
CAUTION
Know the difference between full Faraday cycle analysis (FFCA) and path loss
contour mapping (PLCM).  FFCA is performed to identify the sources of interfer-
ence, to determine the interrogation zone locations, whereas PLCM is per-

formed to get insight into the details of  a given interrogation zone so that it
can be ﬁne-tuned and conﬁgured for optimal performance.  
You will also make sure that any potential barriers that can affect RF signal propaga-
tion are also entered into the blueprint (or some other document). Following are some
examples:
■
Doors
■
Electrical connections
■
Metallic equipment
■
Shelves
■
Liquids and areas of high humidity
■
Sources of interference and noise
After you have recorded your ﬁndings into the blueprint or elsewhere, you can use
them to make installation decisions to facilitate error-free data transfer between tags and
readers.
Using the Results of Your Experiment
This is how you can use the results of your experiment during the installation and
deployment of the RFID system:
■
Choose an antenna location that is free from obstacles.
■
For a given area where tagged objects will be placed (or passing through),
choose a spot for the antenna that maximizes the propagation pattern.
■
Mount the antenna high enough to increase the horizontal coverage by RF
signals.
■
Use the results from PLCA to ﬁne-tune the antenna.
■
Choose a mounting spot for a reader that can accommodate cables for data
transfer and electrical connections.
■
Shield devices that generate RF, to prevent radiation leakage.
■
Ensure that the users in the area know of the possible radiation hazard, and
take steps to prevent excessive human exposure to the radiation by following
the regulations.
The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:

Summary
The purpose of site analysis is to determine how the proposed RFID system will ﬁt into
the existing site infrastructure.A blueprint, the site diagram, helps you visualize the site
infrastructure. With this document as a starting point, the site analysis project has three
stages: physical environmental analysis, RF environmental analysis, and documenting the
results of your analysis.The physical environmental analysis includes recording harsh
environmental conditions, physical obstructions, metallic materials, and other physical
sources that may have adverse effects on the RF signal propagation.The RF environ-
mental analysis includes identifying the sources of interference and noise.You also need
to measure the interference and noise in the planned interrogation zones.The spectrum
analyzer is your device to make these measurements.
You should take signal strength measurements in the planned interrogation zones to
mark the coverage area.You must document your ﬁndings with adequate details. Some
of these ﬁndings, such as the RF coverage information, can go into the blueprints.You
will use these ﬁndings during installation, which is discussed in the next chapter.

Introduction
After selecting a system design, as discussed in Chapter 6, and performing a site analysis,
as discussed in Chapter 7, you are now ready to install your RFID system.Think of
installation as a process and not as an isolated task.The results from system design and
site analysis are the input to the installation process. Installing hardware components and
testing them are essential parts of deploying an RFID system. Before you actually install
the hardware components, you should consider different installation scenarios and
choose the one that best suits the given environment.
So, the core question in this chapter is: How can we successfully install an RFID
system? In search of an answer, we will explore three avenues: planning installation,
installing and testing hardware components, and considering various installation sce-
narios.
Preparing for Installation 
Given the cost and the importance of an RFID system, its installation must be per-
formed in a planned way to achieve the optimal results.An RFID installation is a pro-
cess that begins when you start selecting the system design, which involves
understanding various RFID solutions available in the context of application require-
ments. Equipped with that understanding, you perform the site analysis, which involves

Preparing for installation includes once again considering all the system variables to
put together an RFID solution, considering power sources for the system, and following
the standard industry practices in installing the RFID system.
Putting Together an RFID Solution
Obtaining the components and installing an RFID system could be a very involved
exercise.Although RFID is still an emerging and evolving technology, already several
RFID solutions are available from multiple vendors. So what do you take and what do
you leave? We discussed this issue in Chapter 7 to some extent.The bottom line is: It
basically depends on the business requirements of the application for which you are
deploying the RFID system.The requirements of the RFID system (the solution) that
you install could also be inﬂuenced by the following factors:
■
The site infrastructure
■
The type of products that will be tracked by the RFID system
■
The physical location where the RFID system is to be installed
You will make choices related to a number of important elements of the system; let’s
call them system variables because you have some freedom to choose them.After they are
chosen, they will collectively deﬁne the system.These system variables that you must
consider during installation are shown in Table 8.1.

Readers and tags
The characteristics of readers and tags are consistent with
each other; the readers will read the tags efﬁciently.
Number of readers needed
Vendors
Some vendors might provide better documentation or
customer service than others
Most of the variables listed in the table have already been discussed in previous
chapters because they also need to be considered during the system design selection.
Deploying an RFID solution includes system design, site analysis, and installation. It can
also include hardware/software integration, conﬁguration, and user training.
TIP
Various RFID vendors these days offer solutions for different scenarios, and
some of them also offer installation services.
To operate, the system needs power. Where will the power come from?
Considering Power Sources 
The readers and tags need power for their operation. Passive tags get their power from
the RF signal emitted by the reader, whereas active tags have their own power source,
typically a battery. Readers can use various power sources, including power supply units
(PSUs), uninterrupted power supply (UPS), and power over Ethernet (POE).
Batteries
Active tags attached to items to be tracked and identiﬁed typically use batteries. Because
a battery has a ﬁnite lifetime, it gives a tag a longer read range compared to passive tags,
but they have a limited lifetime, typically up to 10 years.The application could deter-
mine what kind of battery should be used. For example, in toll applications, batteries
should be able to withstand typical temperatures from –40o C to 80o C. In applications
involving harsh environmental conditions such as tracking wildlife, the batteries used in
the tags must be able to withstand even wider temperature ranges.
Power Supply Units
An electrical power supply unit, or PSU, is a device or system that supplies electrical energy
to an output load or group of loads.The complete range of power supplies is very
broad.You should be aware of the following two kinds:
www.syngress.com
192
Chapter 8 • Performing Installation

■
Linear power supply A linear power supply unit can be used as an AC-to-DC
converter.A simple linear power supply unit powered with AC uses a trans-
former to convert the voltage—for example, from a wall outlet—to a lower
DC voltage. Depending on the output load requirements, a linear regulator can
be used to reduce the voltage to the desired output voltage.This power supply
also provides other features such as current limiting.
■
Switched mode power supply A switching power supply unit can be used as a
DC-to-DC converter. In this case, the power supply is designed to accept a
DC input from a limited range and to output a different DC voltage.This is
especially useful in portable devices as well as for power distribution in large
electronic equipment.
Uninterruptible Power Supplies
An uninterruptible power supply, or UPS, is a device that maintains a continuous supply of
electric power to the connected equipment by supplying power from a battery when
the utility power becomes unavailable.A UPS is inserted between the source of power
and the output load that needs to be protected. When an abnormality such as a power
failure occurs, the UPS automatically switches from the utility power to the battery
power.
CAUTION
The switching power supply can generate noise, with some harmonics falling in
the neighborhood of 125 KHz, which is the operating frequency for LF RFID sys-
tems. In that case, you might prefer to use a linear power supply. 
Power Over Ethernet
The power over Ethernet (POE) technology system is any system that transmits electrical
power along with data—for example, to remote devices over standard twisted-pair cable
in an Ethernet network.This technology can be used for powering Ethernet hubs, IP
telephones, Webcams, wireless access points, and other devices where it might not be
convenient to supply power separately.
You should check out whether the company where you are going to install the
RFID system already has implemented a power solution that you can use. For example,
some organizations might already have implemented the power distribution solution
based on access ports used in Ethernet cabling.This system can also be used to deliver
data and power to RFID components such as interrogators.

You should understand the industry-standard process and practices for the installa-
tion and follow them.
The Standard Installation Process and Practices
Because RFID technology is still evolving, deployment of an RFID system can be a
challenging task.You can minimize the risks involved by following the standard industry
process for the installation based on best practices. It’s important to consider installation
as a process and not just as an isolated task.A process has an input, the actual tasks based
on the input, and the output. In this case the input items are design selection and site
analysis, the actual tasks are the installation tasks, and the output is the installed
(deployed) system that will need to be managed. In the following sections we discuss all
these elements.
Design Selection
The system design selection, discussed in Chapter 6, includes selecting operating fre-
quency, hardware components, and types of RFID portal.This selection is largely driven
by the application requirements and the environment in which the RFID system will
operate.The environment is fully explored during site analysis, which is necessary to
ﬁnalize the design.
Site Analysis
Site analysis is performed to determine how the proposed RFID system will ﬁt into the
existing site infrastructure.The process includes examining physical obstructions and
electrical interference and noise.The goal is to mark the interrogation zones that can
effectively coexist with the existing infrastructure. Equipped with the information from
design selection and site analysis, you can start the installation tasks.
Installation Tasks
Installation tasks include installing hardware and possibly software components and
testing the installed RFID system. While installing the system, you must consider and
deal with three deployment issues:
■
Coexistence  The goal of a successful RFID implementation is that the
RFID system effectively coexists with the existing site infrastructure.This
means two things:The existing RF and other services are not disrupted by the
RFID system, and the RFID system gets no or minimal interference or noise
from the existing RF services.There is another dimension to coexistence:The
RFID system components must work in harmony with one another. For
example, you should consider the issues of interrogation zone overlapping.
www.syngress.com
194
Chapter 8 • Performing Installation

■
Integration issues Integration has two components: applications and net-
work infrastructure.
■
Integration with applications  The core RFID system (readers and
interrogators) are usually integrated with the applications that analyze the
data collected by the core system. For example, you might need to connect
a reader to a host computer that might be supporting or connected to a
database system. Internet communication could also be a part of the inte-
grated system. Depending on the application, data aggregation and syn-
chronization might be important issues in this case.
■
Integration with an existing network  Multiple readers can be
grouped together into a network to connect them to one or more host
computers.A network (wired, wireless, or both) could already be in opera-
tion at the site, and you will need to integrate the RFID system to this
network.The availability and reliability of the network connections will be
important issues here.
■
System tuning  The readers and antennas are installed in different scenarios,
such as conveyors, dock doors, and forklifts. In a given scenario, you should
ﬁne-tune the system after its installation to achieve the optimal results.The
ﬁne-tuning can include antenna positioning and alignment, adjusting antenna
power emission within the legal limits, and so on.
System Management
During the installation, you must consider the system management-related issues; the
RFID system will need to be managed after it is installed.Your choices during installa-
tion could affect system management after the installation is complete. Management
includes the following components:
■
Cable management  You will need cables for connections, such as con-
necting readers to the power source, antennas to the readers, and readers to the
network or host computer, and so on.These readers may be in the neighbor-
hood of other equipments and operations, so it’s important to consider the
security and protection of the cables from possible damage and the safety of
personnel from the cables.
■
Device management There could be management issues related to the
readers and the host computers attached to the readers.These issues can
include network connection and data transmission.
■
Data management You must anticipate what kind and volume of data is
going to be collected by the RFID system. Ensure that the installed system is
able to handle that data load.

The Tag Thing
You are installing the RFID system to read tags.Therefore, during the system installa-
tion, you must also consider what kind of tag the system will be reading and how the
tags will be placed on the items.
You consider all these factors while planning your installation.After you’ve done the
planning and made the required purchases, you are ready to start installing the hardware.
Installing Hardware 
The ﬁrst step in installing hardware is to compile at one place all the documentation,
including information from the system design, information from the site analysis, and the
manuals that came with the equipment that you purchased to install.You will be using
this information throughout the installation process.
Installing hardware includes installing readers, installing antennas, and testing the
interrogation zones. Here is the typical process for installing the core hardware for an
RFID system:
1.
Mount the reader.
2.
Mount the antenna.
3.
Install cables including connecting antenna to the reader.
4.
Turn on the reader. Congratulations! You have an interrogation zone.
5.
Test the interrogation zone.
CAUTION
During installation, keep your eyes open for any change that might have
occurred in the site infrastructure after your site analysis. Such changes could
require changes in your installation plan.
Now it’s time to ask that important question: Where do I install the readers?
Installing Readers
As you know by now, a reader creates an interrogation zone in which it can read a tag.
By the time of installation, you have already performed the site analysis to determine the
interrogation zone. Recall that the location of an interrogation zone is determined by
many factors, including the location of the tagged items to be read, sources of interfer-
ence and noise, and sources of other adverse effects such as reﬂection and absorption.
Once an interrogation zone has been marked, you have very little freedom in terms of
where to mount the reader.
www.syngress.com
196
Chapter 8 • Performing Installation

There are two main choices for mounting a reader. If the application requires it, a
rack-based solution could be appropriate—for example, to withstand harsh environ-
mental conditions. In this solution, a rack holds the antenna, reader, power supply such
as UPS, and cables.The rack protects the system from harsh environmental conditions
such as dust, humidity, and moisture.
The other solution is to mount the reader on some surface or edge, such as a wall
or gantry placed around a conveyor. While using your freedom to choose the exact loca-
tion to mount a reader, you must consider the following factors:
■
Breathing room You will need clearance of a few inches around the reader
for cables and to keep the air ﬂowing so that the reader will stay cool.
■
Dense interrogator environment By installation or conﬁguration, or both,
avoid the dense interrogator environment discussed in Chapter 4.
■
Environmental conditions Avoid spots of harsh environmental conditions,
such as extreme temperature, humidity, and moisture.
■
Safety If there is lots of human movement in the area, choose a spot in
which the reader will be safe from accidental physical damage.
■
Interference and noise The sources of AEN and RF interference, discussed
in the previous chapter, also play roles in determining the exact location of a
reader.The idea here is obviously to avoid the effects of AEN and interference.
We will discuss some installation scenarios later in this chapter.The reader creates
and processes) the signal, but the signal is transmitted and received by antennas con-
nected to the reader.
Installing Antennas
Because antennas are communication elements, they are usually the most exposed com-
ponents of an RFID system.Therefore, you must consider their protection from damage
in your installation decisions. Obviously, an antenna will be mounted somewhere in or
near the interrogation zone. RF path loss contour mapping (PLCM), discussed in the
previous chapter, will help you determine the exact location of an antenna in a given
interrogation zone and to conﬁgure and ﬁne-tune the antenna. Depending on the situa-
tion, an antenna can be attached using drills and screws, or you might use a rack solu-
tion, as described previously.
Now you need to connect the antennas to their readers.
Installing Cables 
An antenna is connected to a reader port via a cable.A reader typically has one, four, or
eight antenna ports. Note that if the transmit and receive ports are separate, you will
www.syngress.com
Performing Installation • Chapter 8
197

need two cables for each antenna, whereas if they are combined, only one cable per
antenna will be needed.
You will also need cables for connecting other hardware components, such as power
cables for the readers. Make sure you choose the right type of cable for each connec-
tion.Also consider possibly harsh conditions such as temperature or moisture (or mud)
that the cables might need to put up with.
Use standard practices in installing cables, which including the following:
■
Use the correct standard cable for a given connection: labeled by the manufac-
turer, authenticated by a quality organization for the purpose for which it’s
being used, or both.
■
Keep the cables away from sources of EM waves such as motors and electronic
devices.
■
Use labels to identify the cables.
■
Use protective caps to cover the exposed parts of the cables, such as cuts.
■
The cable layout should be kept in an orderly fashion to avoid confusion and
to have easy access for maintenance.
After you have set up an interrogation zone by installing a reader and its antenna
and connecting them through a cable, you have an interrogation zone that you need to
test.
Testing During Installation
Tests are the essential part of system deployment.There are four kinds of tests that you
need to perform: interrogation zone tests, unit tests, application integration tests, and
system tests.
Interrogation Zone Tests
After installing reader, antenna, and cables, make sure that the cables are connected cor-
rectly and that you are using the power supply appropriate for your purpose.Then turn
the reader on.
Testing the interrogation zone involves three exercises:
1.
Determine the boundaries of the coverage area (interrogation zone) by mea-
suring the signal strength at various points around the antenna, as described in
the previous chapter.
2.
Verify the path loss contour mapping determined during site analysis, as
described in the previous chapter.This involves making the ﬁeld strength and
signal strength measurements using a spectrum analyzer.
www.syngress.com
198
Chapter 8 • Performing Installation

3.
Use the path loss contour mapping to ﬁne-tune and conﬁgure the RFID
system.Test the system in a variety of conﬁgurations for optimal performance.
TIP
Take notes during installation and testing. These notes will help you trou-
bleshoot problems during deployment and during the regular operation of the
system.
Unit Tests
A unit test, in general, is a test procedure used to validate that a particular component of
a system (software, hardware, or both) is functioning properly with the promised perfor-
mance. For example, you should perform a unit test on a reader to verify that it meets
performance specs, such as read range and multiple tag read rate, as speciﬁed by the
vendor.
If the reader is connected to a host computer where the RFID data is to be used by
an application, you might need to perform an application integration test.
Application Integration Tests
An application integration test is performed to verify that the RFID system works prop-
erly in collaboration with the application to which it is integrated. For example, the host
computer might be sending requests to the RFID system to read the tags and send back
the collected data, the data sent back to the host computer will be analyzed by an appli-
cation, and so on.You need to test that the RFID system works harmoniously with the
application.
System Tests
The term system test refers to testing the features of the collective system, including all
the subsystems such as RFID subsystems and application subsystems. Depending on the
application requirements, these tests can include different data load and capacity tests.
Load tests verify that the system has the processing power to handle the amount of data
it is expected to handle, whereas capacity tests verify the system’s capability to produce
the required output or results.
So, it’s important to ﬁrst test the units separately to verify their features and perfor-
mance and then test the whole system put together.These are also called preinstallation
and post-installation tests.
The safety factor must be included in the installation and test process.

Ensuring Safety
You must consider safety issues as a requirement rather than an option. When you are
installing an RFID system, consider safety in the following three dimensions:
■
Ensure that the RFID components are installed with proper care and protec-
tion to avoid possible damage to the components and to ensure the proper
operation of the installed system.
■
Ensure the safety of the personnel in the area.
■
Ensure that the installed system conforms to safety regulations.
To cover all these safety dimensions, you must consider the following factors during
installation.
Equipment Safety from the Environment
You should be mindful of the environment in which the equipment is being installed.
Harsh environmental conditions such as extreme temperature, humidity, moisture, and
condensation can have adverse effects on both the propagation of RF waves and the
RFID equipment itself.These conditions can create adverse effects such as absorption of
the RF waves and can damage the equipment.The two ways to protect against these
conditions are by moving the interrogation zone away from them or using the enclo-
sures for the RFID equipment when possible.
When you consider using enclosures, the name to remember is National Electrical
Manufacturers Association (NEMA), an organization that provides standards and enclo-
sures for electrical equipment. NEMA-rated enclosures come in various types, such as
NEMA Type 4 and NEMA Type 12, each offering a set of protections. Some of the
common protections offered by NEMA type enclosures include the following:
■
Provide protection for personnel against accidental physical contact with the
enclosed equipment.
■
Provide protection for the enclosed equipment against material that may have
adverse effects on the equipment, such as dripping water, dust, rain, sleet, snow,
splashing water, hose-directed water?you’ve got the idea.
■
Provide protection for the enclosed equipment against external formation of
ice on the enclosure.
■
Provide protection against corrosion, which is the deterioration of essential
properties of a material object due to reactions with its environment.A
common example of corrosion is rust.
www.syngress.com
200
Chapter 8 • Performing Installation

TIP
All  NEMA enclosure types are described in NEMA Standards Publication 250-
1997:  Enclosures for Electrical Equipment (1000 Volts Maximum).
Another source of possible damage that you need to protect against is electrostatic
discharge.
Electrostatic Discharge
Electrostatic discharge, or ESD, is the instantaneous electric current created by the ﬂow
of electrons from a high-density (of electrons) surface to a low-density surface—for
example, when the two surfaces rub against each other. It could gradually degrade and
damage a system component. In the environment of an RFID system, common sources
of ESD include belts, conveyors, rollers, paper handling, and striping labels from rolls.
Some ESD protection techniques are listed in the following:
■
Wrist straps A wrist strap can be used as the primary method to ground
personnel when they’re close to an unprotected ESD item.The wrist strap
must be worn in direct contact with the wearer’s bare skin. Ensure that the
ground connection end of the strap is securely connected to the ESD ground.
■
Groundable footwear
Groundable footwear can be used as an alternative to
the wrist strap, especially in a situation in which wrist straps are not appro-
priate or are unsafe to use.
■
Conductive mats Conductive mats can be used to ground personnel and
furniture.
■
Plastic handles  While near ESD-sensitive items, use plastic-handled hand
tools such as pliers, screwdrivers, and wire strippers.
■
Relative humidity The relative humidity in the area where ESD protection
is required must be above a minimum threshold value, say 30 percent. It must
also be below an appropriate maximum limit because excessive humidity can
cause problems such as corrosion, high-voltage leakage paths, and moisture
contamination within the equipment.
■
Air ionization This technique is used to neutralize charges on ungrounded
conductors and insulators.
■
ESD-protective packaging and storage The ESD sensitive items must be
contained within approved ESD protective containers for movement in and
between ESD-protected areas. When stored, ESD-sensitive items should be
contained within a static-shielding container. Direct contact of unprotected
www.syngress.com
Performing Installation • Chapter 8
201

ESD items with metal shelves or cabinets must be avoided. Once the ESD-
sensitive items stored in the cabinet are safely enclosed within ESD
shielding, it is not necessary for the metal storage cabinets to be grounded.
CAUTION
Ordinary adhesive tapes such as a duct or masking tape can be highly charge-
able. That means you should only use the approved tape near or in direct con-
tact with an ESD-sensitive item. Do not use those tacky mats within a few
meters (say, 3) of ESD-sensitive items. Also, unprotected ESD-sensitive items
must not be passed from one individual to another unless both individuals are
properly grounded.
ESD can damage the transistors in a tag’s IC, thereby causing the tag to malfunction.
ESD can also damage the interrogator’s IC, especially if the interrogator is not properly
grounded.
Grounding
Grounding refers to making electrical connection to the earth.The part directly in con-
tact with the earth is called the earth electrode, and it can be as simple as a metal rod or a
wire. Grounding provides a reference voltage level (zero) to electrical equipment and a
sink to absorb electric charge under fault conditions. Grounding provides the following
safety:
■
It can dissipate electrostatic buildup.
■
It is primarily used to prevent electric shock or ﬁres caused by a voltage differ-
ence between the earth and a conducting material.
■
It is also often used as a protection against lightning strikes because it will
harmlessly conduct the resulting excessive charge to the earth rather than
starting ﬁres and damaging equipment.
■
It is also used to control electrical noise and interference in electrical items
such as computers, readers, and communication circuits.
CAUTION
An electrical ground must have enough charge-carrying (current) capability to
serve as an effective zero-voltage reference level.
www.syngress.com
202
Chapter 8 • Performing Installation

While dealing with grounding, you must be careful to avoid the possibilities of
ground loops.
Ground Loops
Ground loops in an electrical system are unwanted currents that ﬂow in a conductor con-
necting two points that are supposed to be at the same potential, e.g. ground (or zero)
potential, but are actually at different potentials. Different points on Earth may have dif-
ferent electrical potential—the difference could be as big as hundreds of volts—for
example, due to the inﬂuence of solar wind.Therefore, by grounding two components
(say, readers) of a system to different points on Earth, you can create a ground loop. Such
a condition could be very unsafe for a personnel operating or servicing the system.
A loop condition created by a ground point will cause energy transfer back to the
connected devices and thereby will generate interference and noise.This can be avoided
by ensuring that a loop condition does not exist—for example, by ensuring that the
conductor used for grounding is short enough and that all the components (readers, in
our case) are connected to the same grounding system.
Safety Regulations
During installation, you must recognize and conform to safety regulations regarding
human exposure to the radiation emitted by the RFID system. Safety regulations and
guidelines for human exposure to RF ﬁelds are necessary because if the RF energy
absorption exceeds a threshold value, adverse biological effects could occur.This issue
was discussed in detail in Chapter 5.
So, during the deployment of an RFID system, you must consider both kinds of
safety: protection of the equipment from the environment and protection of the envi-
ronment (including personnel) from the equipment.Toward this end, deploying an
RFID system involves creating RFID portals.
Working with 
Various Installation Scenarios 
When you are installing an RFID system, you are basically deploying what are called
RFID portals. An RFID portal is an area in which tags can be read or written to. Note
the difference between the two interrelated terms: portal and interrogation zone. When
you mount a reader, you have portal. When you turn the reader on, you have an inter-
rogation zone on the portal. From an installation viewpoint, the readers are divided into
three categories:
■
Fixed-mount interrogators
■
Vehicle-mount interrogators
■
Handheld interrogators
www.syngress.com
Performing Installation • Chapter 8
203

These categories were discussed in Chapter 4. Vehicle-mount and handheld inter-
rogators are also collectively called mobile interrogators. So, most installation scenarios can
be grouped into two categories: mobile reader installation and ﬁxed-mount reader
installation. While installing readers, always remember that you are installing an RFID
portal, which is an area in which the tags cab be read or written to. Corresponding to
ﬁxed-mount and mobile readers, there are stationary ports and mobile ports.
Setting Up Stationary Portals
A stationary portal is set up by installing a ﬁxed-mount reader. In ﬁxed-mount reader
scenarios, the tags go to the reader to be read. In other words, the reader waits for the
tags to pass through its interrogation zone, and when they do, it reads them.
Setting Up a Conveyor Portal
Conveyors are used for case-level tracking—for example, in airports.This scenario has
the following elements already ﬁxed for you:
■
The tags are moving at a certain speed.
■
The tags are not oriented in a certain direction.
This situation requires that you use multiple readers for optimal results.The reader
antennas are often mounted on gantries placed around the conveyor, as shown in Figure
8.2.The reader antennas on each side of the gantry will cover four faces of the con-
tainer: up, down, and two side faces.

Chapter 8 • Performing Installation
Antennas
Gantry
Gantry
Container

Other things that you should consider while setting up a conveyor portal include
the following:
■
To avoid signal reﬂection by metal and other adverse effects, keep the antennas
comfortably away from the conveyor edges; about 45 cm (1.5 feet) away is a
good rule of thumb.
■
One of the four antennas will be positioned under the conveyor.You might
ﬁnd antennas designed for optimal operations under the conveyor.
■
While conﬁguring the reader for read-related parameters, keep in mind the
speed of the conveyor (that is, as much time a tag has in the interrogation
zone), which will also affect the number of attempts a reader can make to read
a tag.A reader must be able to make multiple attempts to read a tag.
■
The polarization and alignment of reader antennas should be compatible with
random orientation of tags.
■
While conﬁguring the power emitted by the reader antenna, keep in mind the
following two opposing factors:
■
There must be enough power to offer a large enough read range and
interrogation zone.
■
The power must be kept within the safety regulations set by local,
regional, national, and international regulatory bodies.This is important for
protecting personnel in the area against radiation.
TIP
Because the conveyor is moving, a tag has only a limited amount of time in the
interrogation zone. So, avoid writing to the tag on the conveyor, because it will
consume some time. Also, the write requirements for power and distance are
different from the read requirements.
So, conveyors pose a speed challenge to RFID systems.The higher the conveyor, the
higher must be the reader’s read speed. Readers have different read speeds, which can
vary from about 25 tags/sec to well over 1000 tags/sec. However, you can ﬁnd readers
that can handle a  conveyor speed of up to 600 feet/sec.

EXERCISE 8.1  
You have adjusted the power of reader antennas set on a conveyor to a value
that is within the limits of the safety regulations. However, it is higher than you
need to cover the conveyor width. What adverse effect can it have on the tag
reads?
Solution: 
Due to the higher power, the read range is larger than required. The reader
could start reading tags in the vicinity of the conveyor—for example, from a
forklift truck passing by. Such a read is called a stray tag read.  
Conveyors are good for case-level reading, whereas dock doors are suitable for
pallet-level reading.
Setting Up a Dock Door Portal
Dock door portals are used for pallet-level tracking.They read the tags on items passing
through a gateway such as a door.This scenario has the following elements already ﬁxed
for you:
■
The region outside but near the door can be used for temporary staging of
items for shipment.Those items must not be read by the readers in the door
portal.
■
The tag items will pass through the door—that is, they will be in the interro-
gation zone for only a short period.
■
The way the tagged items are transported through the dock door, such as on a
forklift, will determine the height at which an interrogation zone should be set
up.The door size will also affect the determination of read range and interro-
gation zone.
■
The dock door areas are usually busy with activities.
These situations require that you consider the following points while installing a
dock door portal:
■
Keep the cables out of harm’s way.
■
Make sure that the antennas are protected against accidental damage.You might
consider a rack solution for antennas on two sides of the door.
■
To offer the required read range, a UHF system is usually appropriate for this
scenario.

■
The antenna power should be high enough to offer the required read range
but should be within the limits set by safety regulations.Also, too high a power
can create stray read problems and interrogation zone overlaps.
■
The number of antennas should be large enough to cover the width and the
expected height at which the tagged items will be passing.Too many
antennas could create the dense interrogator environment problem discussed
in Chapter 4.
■
Depending on the situation, there are several possible antenna placement solu-
tions:
■
Two antennas on each side of the door: four antennas in total.A rack solu-
tion can be used if required for protection.An example of this scenario is
shown in Figure 8.3.
■
Four antennas on each side of the door: eight antennas in total.A rack
solution can be used if required for protection.
■
On antenna mounted overhead.This solution provides protection for the
antenna.
■
Two antennas mounted overhead, looking into the door interior from the
two corners of the door.This solution provides protection for the
antennas.
■
While positioning antennas, to avoid interference, make sure the antennas from
two sides of the door are not directly pointing at each other.

EXERCISE 8.2 
You have set up RFID portals on two dock doors adjacent to each other. What
are the two main problems that can happen in this scenario, and what are their
possible solutions?
Problems: First, because two portals are just next to each other, the reader
on one door could read tags passing through the other door—the stray tag
read problem. Second, the interrogation zones of readers from two doors could
overlap each other, which could create effects such as interference. 
Possible solutions:
1.
Conﬁgure and ﬁne-tune the readers to remove these overlap problems.
2.
Turn on only one portal at a given time. This can partially be achieved
by a sensor-based portal: The portal readers are turned on only when a
sensor on the door indicates something is coming and needs to be
read.  
3.
Move the doors away from each other.
So, the main challenges posed by the dock door portal scenario are the following:
■
Multiple dock doors adjacent to each other can create interrogation zone
overlap problems, causing signal interference and reading tags from the other
door.
■
Because there could be items staged for shipping near the dock door, a reader
on a dock door, if not properly conﬁgured and tuned, might read tags from the
region outside the door—stray tag reads.
■
The movement around a dock door poses the risk of damage to the RFID
components.Therefore, the cables and the antennas must be protected against
incidental damage.
Setting Up a Shelf Portal
This scenario has the following elements already ﬁxed for you:
■
The items on the shelf could have liquid content, and there might be metal in
the vicinity.
■
The number of items on the shelf keeps changing—that is, customers take the
items away and more items are put into the shelf at a later time.
www.syngress.com
208
Chapter 8 • Performing Installation

■
The items will most probably be read from rather a close distance—say, less
than 6 inches.
The most suitable RF to meet these requirements is HF—that is, 13.56 MHz.This
frequency will give enough read range and will be relatively less affected by metals and
liquid content—and therefore less vulnerable to effects such as absorption. Other things
that you should consider as you install shelf portals include the following:
■
You can create a multishelved portal with one antenna per shelf using a multi-
antenna reader. In this case, you can conﬁgure the reader to use the antennas
for reads in some sequential order.
■
If the change in the number of items on the shelf needs to be detected, the
readers should be conﬁgured to either continuously keep reading the tags or
have read cycles at preset intervals.You need to consider the reading require-
ment while you’re making the buying decision, because different readers from
different vendors could offer different features and options.
■
The reader antennas should be properly placed, conﬁgured, and oriented to
avoid interference between neighbor antennas.
TIP
Unlike the dock door and conveyor portals, you have more control over the tags
in a shelf portal. For optimal reads, make sure that the tags are oriented at right
angles to the RF ﬁeld coming from the reader antenna. If they are parallel to
this ﬁeld, no signal will be received, and hence no communication will occur
between the reader and the tag. 
So, the main issues in setting up a shelf portal are:
■
Ensure proper orientation of the tags in the shelf so that they can be optimally
read.
■
Select the proper time interval between consecutive read cycles so that the
change in items in the shelf can be optimally recorded.
Depending on the application requirements, you may also use the mobile reader to
read tagged items in the shelves.
Setting Up Mobile Portals
A mobile portal is set up by installing a mobile reader. In the mobile reader scenario, the
reader goes to the tag to read it.
www.syngress.com
Performing Installation • Chapter 8
209

Handheld Interrogator Portals
A handheld interrogator contains the whole reading system in one device and offers the
maximum ﬂexibility.You can take the interrogator to the tagged item and collect the
information. Because handheld interrogators are usually used for close reads, interference
from other RF devices and other adverse effects such as reﬂection and scattering due to
neighbor objects are usually not issues. However, you still need to conﬁgure the reader
according to the required read range.
Mobile-Mount Portals
A mobile mount portal is set up by mounting a reader on a vehicle such as a forklift.
For example, you can collect information from tagged items on pallets in a storage room
by driving an RFID-enabled forklift down the aisle. In a forklift scenario, the following
parameters apply to the environment:
■
Avoid harsh environmental conditions?for example, cold temperature in a
storage room.
■
Eliminate unfriendly material such as metals that will reﬂect the signal.
■
You will need a wireless connection for the RFID system to send data to a
central place such as a data warehouse.
■
The reader will be in motion.
■
You will need a power supply in the vehicle.
This scenario requires you to consider the following:
■
You can mount the reader on either the interior or the exterior of the vehicle.
■
In case you decide to mount the reader on the exterior of the vehicle, consider
the adequate clearance from external objects such as doorways.
■
The reader must be protected against mechanical shocks and vibrations.
■
The mobile RFID system will most probably be using the wireless network
for transferring data to a central location.Therefore, the possibility of interfer-
ence with other EM devices should be considered.
So, the main challenges of a forklift-based mobile RFID portal are wireless network
and harsh environmental conditions, including extreme temperatures, metallic material,
mechanical shocks and vibrations, and so on.

EXERCISE 8.3
You are going to install RFID portals in a warehouse that has 75 dock doors and
10 forklifts. You have a choice to implement dock door stationary portals or
forklift mobile portals. Which solution will be more cost effective, and why?
Solution: The forklift-based mobile portal solution will be more effective
because you will need much fewer readers than you would for a dock door
portal solution. For a dock door portal solution, you would need at least 75
readers for 75 dock doors. For 10 forklifts, you can manage with as few as 10
readers.   
The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■
Consider implementation as a process that has input actual implementation
tasks and output.The input items are information from design selection and
site analysis, the actual tasks are the installation tasks, and the output is the
deployed system that will need to be managed.
■
Hardware installation must include testing and conformance to safety regula-
tions.
■
A given installation scenario will have its own installation issues, and the
emphasis on some installation issues might vary from one installation scenario
to another.

Summary
Deployment of an RFID system is a process that takes information from system design
and site analysis as an input, involves performing actual installation tasks, and considers
the installed system as an output. For optimal results, the installation must be planned,
which includes considering power sources and system variables such as operating fre-
quency, operating environment, number of antennas, and so on. Hardware components
such as readers and antennas must be tested as units for their features and performance
before installing them into a system, where they will be tested again as part of the
system test. While making installation decisions and during the actual installation, you
must conform to the safety requirements that involve both protecting the equipment
from the environment as well as protecting the environment (including personnel) from
the equipment.You must consider all the possible installation scenarios available to you
and choose the one that best suits the situation. Each installation scenario may have its
own installation issues.
So, now you have implemented a basic RFID system. But your site might need
additional devices such as an RFID printer to support the RFID system. We explore this
topic in the next chapter.

Introduction
RFID begins where barcode technology ends.A so-called smart label combines a\ bar-
code with an RFID tag. Smart labels have the intelligence and functionality of a tag and
the printing convenience of a barcode label.Therefore, by using smart labels, corpora-
tions can leverage their existing labeling infrastructure to incorporate RFID.
Smart labels are created by RFID printers, which are peripheral devices, and they are
applied to the items to be tracked by using another peripheral device called an automatic
label applicator. The third kind of peripheral or ancillary device used in RFID networks is
called a feedback system, which helps build effective, robust, and automatic RFID networks.
So, the core issue in this chapter is the role of peripheral devices in RFID.To under-
stand this issue, we will explore three avenues: RFID printers, RFID label applicators,
and RFID feedback devices.
Smart Labels: Where RFID Meets Barcode 
Upon the arrival of RFID, the industry was using the barcode technology to identify
items.A barcode (also written as bar code) is a machine-readable representation of informa-
tion printed on a surface in a visual format.Almost everything that you buy from
retailers these days has a barcode printed on it, which helps manufacturers and retailers
keep track of inventory. Barcodes can be read by optical scanners, also called barcode
readers.These codes serve as product “ﬁngerprints” made of machine-readable, parallel
bars that store binary code, as shown in Figure 9.1.
Figure 9.1 An Example of a Barcode
NOTE
Barcode labels are also called Universal Product Code (UPC) labels or UPC bar-
codes. UPC is the encoding scheme, or data structure, used to write barcodes,
widely used in the United States and Canada on items in retail stores.
220
Chapter 9 • Working with RFID Peripherals
www.syngress.com

RFID tags offer what barcodes offer, plus lot more. For example, barcodes, once cre-
ated, can only be read, whereas you can modify the information on the writable tags.
Furthermore, the tags can store a lot more information, and they can become part of the
global network. However, the procedures and infrastructure for barcodes (also called
labels) is already in place.The incorporation of RFID tags into the existing labeling (bar-
code) technology gave rise to the smart label, which is basically a barcode label that con-
tains an RFID tag embedded in it. It’s called a smart label because it contains more
information and has more capabilities than the barcode label. For example, with a smart
label attached to it, an object can be tracked by an automated RFID system without
manual intervention. By tracking the object globally using the EPCglobal network, you
can automate its ﬂow through the supply chain.This will result in supply chains that can
tune themselves automatically to respond efﬁciently to the changing demands of the
consumer: a big win. Supply chain is just one of a multitude of RFID applications with
advantages of the same magnitude.
As an example, Figure 9.2 shows a roll of smart labels. Like a label, they can be con-
veniently printed on and attached to an object, and they have all the capabilities of an
RFID tag—the best of both worlds.These labels were created on an RFID printer.

Systems Inc.)
Working with RFID Printers
An RFID printer, also called a smart label printer, prints, well, smart labels. In this section,
we will explore what a smart label printer is and how you install, conﬁgure, and trou-
bleshoot it.

NOTE
The word periphery has its origin in a Greek word that means circumference or
outer surface. So periphery, in general, means boundary or outer part of some-
thing: body or space. In the computer industry, a peripheral (also called a
peripheral device) is a device that is not required for the computer to function,
but it is used to expand the capabilities of the computer. For example, a printer
attached to a computer is a peripheral device.
Understanding RFID Printers
An RFID printer is an RFID peripheral device that can print human-readable informa-
tion on the surface of a smart label and can write data to the transponder (tag) inside
the label. It’s also called a smart label printer or RFID printer/encoder. In other words, the
RFID printer combines the functionalities of a traditional barcode (or label) printer and
an RFID encoder to create (print and encode) smart labels.
So, a smart label can contain UPC barcode information printed on its front surface
as well as the information written (encoded) to an RFID tag sandwiched between its
outer printable layers.Typical RFID printers encode data onto the HF (13.56 MHz
RFID) and UHF (915 MHz RFID) tags.These printers can be connected to a PC via a
port (parallel, serial, or USB) or through a network connection such as Ethernet and
used as output devices.Typical RFID printers offer the following functionality:
■
Print text on the surface of a smart label, e.g., destination address
■
Print linear and 2-D barcodes on the surface of a label, which will be
scannable
■
Print graphic images on the surface of a label
■
Write (encode) information to the tag inside a label
■
Read the encoded information
■
Verify the accuracy of the information
■
Mark a faulty label and proceed to the next label
From now on in our discussion, by label we mean smart label, unless speciﬁed otherwise.

NOTE
Label width and depth depend on the RFID inlay (tag) inside the label.
You will ﬁnd a whole range of RFID printers in the market with a wide spectrum
of features and capabilities.You will obviously select the one that is optimal for your
application. Following are the typical requirements that you should consider in selecting
a printer:
■
Accuracy veriﬁcation  Seriously consider whether the printer has a feature
to automatically void the faulty label, e.g., the label that has the transponder
that does not respond properly to the read/write instructions from the printer.
■
Compliance Ensure that the printer meets compliance requirements. For
example, an RFID printer to be used for passive UHF EPC smart labels
must have been tested to be EPC compliant.
■
Environmental condition Consider the environmental condition such as
temperature in which the printer will be used.This could help you determine
the features, such as temperatures in which the printer can operate safely.
■
Flexibility Consider the ﬂexibility the printer provides in terms of properties
such as the following:
■
Does it support various label sizes?
■
Does it support multiple tag protocols? 
■
Does it let you conﬁgure the number of attempts it will make to write to
the tag? This will let you have control over the time it will spend on faulty
tags and the volume of error messages it will generate as a result.
■
Quantity of labels Consider the volume of labels that you will be printing
in the short and long term.This might help you determine features such as
printing speed.
■
Software support Ensure that the printer has the required software support.
EXERCISE 9.1
You have an RFID printer with the resolution of 300 dpi. How many dots can it
print in one mm? 
Solution:
www.syngress.com
224
Chapter 9 • Working with RFID Peripherals

1 inch = 2.5 cm = 25 mm
300 dpi = 300 dots/inch = 300 dots/25 mm = 12 dots/mm
Once you have selected and purchased an RFID printer suitable for your needs, it’s
time to install it.
Installing the RFID Printer
Although details about installing a printer can vary from printer to printer, the overall
process is the same for all RFID printers.The main tasks in installing the printer are
unpacking the printer, placing it ﬁrmly at a selected site, making all the connections,
loading the printer with media and ribbon, and executing any installation software.
CAUTION
Install the label stock between the printhead and the platen before closing the
pivoting deck; otherwise, the debris on the platen may damage the printhead.
Also, do not touch the printhead or the electronic components under the print-
head assembly.
You can install an RFID printer by following the instructions in the manual that
will come with the printer. However, the main steps are listed in the following as a
high-level view of the installation procedure:
1.
Unpack and check the content Make sure all the listed items are present
in the package.
2.
Select a printer site The printer must rest safely on a solid, leveled surface,
and there must be enough access space for activities, such as proper ventilation
and cooling, opening it to change the media, and so on. In selecting the
printer space, you should also consider the interference from other RF devices,
such as readers and cell phones.
3.
Connect the power cables
a.
Make sure the printer’s power switch is in the Off position.
b.
Attach the AC power cord to the AC power receptacle in the back of the
printer.
c.
Attach the AC power cord to a grounded (three-prong) electrical outlet of
the proper voltage.

4.
Load the printer Load the printer with labels and ribbon.The instructions
might be shown right on the printer panel.
5.
Power on the printer
6.
Run the installation program The installation software might come with
the printer, or you might need to download it from a Web site. However, if
you have thought through the various options, this part of the installation
should not be difﬁcult. Just follow the instructions from the software program
and make your choices.You might need to choose port type and connection
type between the computer and the printer. If your RFID system uses the net-
work and you want to make the printer part of the network, connect it to the
print server.
While handling the printer during or after installation, take the following precautions:
■
During unpacking or handling, do not place the printer on its backside,
because it may damage the printer interface connector.
■
While setting up a printer, avoid touching the electrical connectors to prevent
damage due to ESD.The ESD can damage or destroy the printhead or elec-
tronic components in the printer.
■
Make sure the printer is properly grounded. Failure to do so could result in
electric shock to the operator.To comply with international safety standards,
printers are usually equipped with a three-pronged power cord; one of the
three prongs is the ground prong. In this case, do not use adapter plugs, and do
not remove the ground prong from the cable plug. If you do need an exten-
sion cord, make sure it uses a three-wire cable with a properly grounded plug.
■
Verify the required voltage on the printer’s model number label on the back of
the printer.
■
Never operate the printer on its side or upside down.
■
If you are using direct thermal mode, clean the platen roller, printhead, and
lower and upper media sensors every time you change the media.
Smart label printers usually use the following thermal printing techniques to print:
■
Thermal transfer printing A printer using this technique prints on a
medium such as paper by melting a coating of ribbon that will stay glued to
the medium.This technique, by deﬁnition, requires a ribbon.
■
Direct thermal printing A printer using this technique prints on a medium
such as paper by selectively heating the coated thermochromic medium when
the medium passes over the printer’s thermal printhead.This technique does
www.syngress.com
226
Chapter 9 • Working with RFID Peripherals

not require a ribbon. Thermochromism is the property of a material to change
color due to a change in temperature.
During or after installation, you will need to conﬁgure the printer to customize it
according to your needs.
Conﬁguring the RFID Printer
RFID printers typically offer a degree of ﬂexibility by allowing you to conﬁgure the
values for a set of properties.The exact set of conﬁguration properties and the values of
their range may change from printer to printer. But to give you a practical feel, we use a
real printer (the SL5000e Smart Label RFID Thermal Printer from Printronix) as an
example, to discuss the conﬁguration properties that are typically available in most RFID
printers.These properties include the following:
■
Label length  This is the length of the smart label. In most applications, the
label length that you choose will match the physical label length—that is, the
actual label length of the media installed.
■
Label width  This property speciﬁes the width of the label.
■
Media-handling method  This property speciﬁes how the printer will
handle the media (label stock):
■
Peel-off In this method, the optional rewinder is installed, and it prints
and peels die-cut labels from the liner without assistance.The printer waits
for you to remove the label before it can move to print the next label; this
is also called on-demand printing. The printer displays the “Remove Label”
message to remind you to remove the label before it can print the next
one.
■
Tear-off With this method, the printer positions the label over the tear
bar after printing and waits for you to tear off the label before printing the
next one; this is also called on-demand printing.The printer displays the
“Remove Label” message to remind you to remove the label before the
next one can be printed.
■
Tear-off strip With this method, the printer will print on the media and
send it out the front until the print buffer is empty; then it positions the
last label over the tear bar for removal.
■
Cut With this method, given that the optional media cutter is installed, it
automatically cuts media after each label is printed, or it can cut after a
speciﬁed number of labels have been printed using a software cut com-
mand.

■
Orientation  This property speciﬁes the image orientation that will be used
when printing the label.
■
Paper feed shift  This property represents the distance to advance a label or
pull back when the tear-off strip, tear-off, peel-off, or cut media-handling
option is enabled. In other words, it helps position the label.
■
Print intensity  This property speciﬁes the level of thermal energy from the
printhead to be used for the given type of media and ribbon installed.A large
value for this property means more heat (thermal energy) will be applied for
each dot, which in turn affects the print quality.
■
Print mode  This property speciﬁes the type of printing to be performed:
■
Transfer Indicates thermal transfer printing mode that uses the heat-sen-
sitive ribbon to perform heat-based printing.
■
Direct Indicates direct thermal printing mode (no ribbon) that uses spe-
cial heat-sensitive media to perform heat-based printing.
■
Printing speed  This property speciﬁes the speed in units of inches per
second (ips) at which the media (label) passes through the printer when
printing.
■
Save-conﬁg property  This property allows you to save up to eight unique
conﬁgurations to meet different print job requirements.
■
Save-up conﬁg  This property allows you to specify that the factory conﬁg-
uration or any one of the eight possible saved conﬁgurations be used as the
power-up conﬁguration.
The range of values and the default value for each of these properties is shown in

maximum print speed depends on the maximum printer width and the print
resolution (dots per inch).
So, you have installed and conﬁgured your printer and are ready to roll. However,
keep in mind that errors and problems are part and parcel of life, even in the technology
world.This is where troubleshooting skills come handy.
Troubleshooting the RFID Printer
The RFID encoder in an RFID printer can detect a number of errors. When one of
these errors occurs, the RFID encoder instructs the printer to perform the currently
selected error action and displays the appropriate error message on the control panel’s
LCD, as shown in Table 9.3.The error action is selected according to the value of the
Error Handling parameter on the RFID Control menu, which you can set to one of the
following values:
■
None No speciﬁc action is taken.The printer will discard the failing label
data and continue to the next smart label.
■
Overstrike (the default) The unacceptable smart label will be printed with
a grid or error message over the label. If the Label Retry Count is greater than
zero, the same smart label will be tried over and over again until the label retry
count is exhausted. In case of a failure, after the last try the error message will
be printed if the Overstrike Style is set to Error Type Msg.These error mes-
sages are shown in Table 9.4. If the Overstrike Style is set to Grid, a grid pat-

tern will be printed instead of an error message.The failed label will not be
reprinted.
■
Stop The printer discards the failing label data, displays the error message
“RFID Error: Check Media,” and halts.The failed label is discarded, and
reprinting of the labels must be initiated by the host. Once the error is cleared,
the label with the failed tag moves forward until the next label is in the posi-
tion to be printed.
So, if an RFID tag within a smart label is found unacceptable after performing a
deﬁned number of retries, one of these actions is performed.

1. The label is possibly misaligned. Perform the Auto
Calibrate procedure to ensure that the label is at top of
form. Refer to the vendor documentation.
2. Ensure that you are using the correct media: smart
labels with RFID tags located in the correct position.
3. The RFID tag is possibly defective. Try another tag.
4. Ensure that the application does not send too few or
too many digits to the RFID tag.
CAUTION
Before performing any maintenance procedure, always disconnect the AC
power cord from the printer or from the power outlet. Failure to remove power
could result in injury to you, damage to equipment, or both. If applying the
power is necessary at some step of the procedure, according to the documenta-
tion, always consider the fact that the power is on and proceed carefully. 
A standard technique in troubleshooting, which also equally applies to printer prob-
lems, is the fault isolation technique.You improve your chances of identifying the cause
of the problem by following this technique:
www.syngress.com
Working with RFID Peripherals • Chapter 9
231

1.
Collect information. Ask the user (reporting the problem) to describe the
problem. Collect as much relevant information as you can.
2.
Reproduce the problem. Verify the problem by running a diagnostic printer
test in which you replicate the conditions reported by the user and reproduce
the problem.
3.
Look for the standard error messages to start troubleshooting.
4.
If you cannot get an error message described in the troubleshooting table of
the documentation, use the so-called half-split method to narrow down the
problem area:
a.
Start at a general level and work your way down to details.
b.
Isolate the faults by narrowing down to half the remaining system at a
time, until the ﬁnal half is a ﬁeld-replaceable unit or assembly.
5.
Make one change at a time or one corrective action at a time.Test the printer
operation after every corrective action.
6.
Replace the defective unit or assembly. Do not attempt ﬁeld repairs of elec-
tronic components or assemblies. Most electronic problems are corrected by
replacing the printed circuit board assembly, sensor, or cable that causes the
fault indication.
7.
Install any part you replaced earlier to diagnose the problem and that was not
found defective.
8.
Test the printer again. Return the printer to normal operation when the
reported symptoms disappear.
After you have created the smart labels with the RFID printer, you will need to
apply those labels to the products that need to be tracked.You might also need some
device that will give you feedback on how your RFID system is doing.All these devices
are called ancillary devices.
Understanding Ancillary 
Devices and Concepts
Ancillary devices are the devices that might not be an essential part of a core system but
are useful additions to it. RFID encoders and label applicators are examples of ancillary
devices in an RFID system.
www.syngress.com
232
Chapter 9 • Working with RFID Peripherals

NOTE
The word ancillary means something of secondary importance; something sub-
ordinate to something else. For example, an instructor’s manual is ancillary to
the textbook.
Encoders and Label Applicators
RFID printer encoders are used to write information on a tag inside a smart label, and
label applicators are used to apply smart labels to items that need to be tracked.
RFID Printer Encoders
An RFID printer encoder is a component of an RFID printer that writes data to and
reads data from the tag inside a smart label being used as a media for the printer. We
already covered this topic in the previous section. However, here are the important
points to remember about a printer encoder:
■
They typically operate in HF (13.56 MHz) and UHF (915 MHz).
■
The behavior of the encoder in a printer can be controlled through the RFID
control menu.
■
An RFID printer encoder supports the following functionality:
■
Reading the data from the tag
■
Modifying, deleting, or writing the data to the tag
■
Verifying the accuracy of the data on the tag
The common faults detected and the errors displayed by an RFID printer encoder
were presented in Table 9.3.Troubleshooting tips for an RFID printer encoder were
presented in Table 9.4.
Once the smart labels have been printed by the RFID printer, they will to be
attached to the items that need to be identiﬁed and tracked.This is where the automated
label applicator enters the RFID story.
Automated Label Applicators
An automated label applicator is a labeling machine that is designed to automate the
process of applying labels to products.These machines, widely used in manufacturing
and food processing and distribution departments, can also be used for applying smart
labels.
www.syngress.com
Working with RFID Peripherals • Chapter 9
233

NOTE
Automated label applicators are capable of placing labels consistently in the same
place on each item to the accuracy of 0.5 mm, and at high speed, up to
80m/minute or 20 packages per minute.
Automatic label applicators can be grouped broadly into two categories: pneumatic
piston applicators and wipe-on applicators, as described in the following sections.
Pneumatic Piston Label Applicators
The pneumatic piston label applicator is a machine that has a piston to stop a product
on a line for labeling and then applies the label to it using the tamp-down or blow-on
technique. For that reason, this category is also called tamp-blow applicators.This type of
label applicator is suitable under following conditions:
■
You want to apply labels to the front, sides, or top of the product (or package),
typically on an automated production line.
■
The product does not have to be moving at a constant speed.
This is how it works:
1.
A sensor detects the product.
2.
The labeling machine activates a pneumatic piston.
3.
The piston stops the product for as long as it takes to apply the label.
4.
The label is served on a vacuum plate, which is moved by the pneumatic
piston to the package.
5.
The label is then applied by using one of the following methods:
■
The label is simply pressed against the product, called a tamp-down action.
■
The label is blown onto the product: the vacuum in the vacuum plate is
replaced with air that provides the pressure to blow the label onto the
package. In other words, the label is blown onto the package by a blast of
air.The advantage of this method is that the vacuum plate does not actu-
ally touch the package: action at a distance.
Wipe-On Label Applicators
A wipe-on label applicator is a machine that performs pressure-sensitive labeling using a
roller or a brush that wipes down the label on a package.This type of label applicator is
suitable under the following conditions:
www.syngress.com
234
Chapter 9 • Working with RFID Peripherals

■
You want to apply labels to the bottom, sides, or top of a product (or package),
typically on an automated production line or by using a short length of con-
veyor.
■
The product must be reliably moving at a constant speed.
This is how it works:
1.
A sensor detects the product.
2.
At a ﬁxed time later, the labeling machine starts to issue the label.
3.
The label is applied by tamping it down with the help of a foam roller.
To apply the labels consistently at the same place on each item, the side of the
item that is to be labeled needs to be in the same position each time and must be rea-
sonably flat.An example of a wipe-on label applicator, the Geset Alpha-V40, is shown
in Figure 9.4.
Figure 9.4 An Example of a Wipe-On Label Applicator (Image Courtesy of
Weber Marking Systems Inc.)
NOTE
There are many variants on the two types of label applicators that we have dis-
cussed. For example, in the case of  pneumatic piston label applicators,  a so-
called 90-degree labeling machine can apply labels to the front face of a
package (the leading face of a package in motion), and a labeling machine with
twin vacuum plates can apply a label to two sides of a package, called round
the corner. This kind of label applicator can also handle packages of variable
sizes. A variant of a wipe-on label applicator can also apply labels to two sides
of a product (round the corner). 
www.syngress.com
Working with RFID Peripherals • Chapter 9
235

In a nutshell, these two categories of label applicator use the following three label-
placing techniques:
■
The blow-on technique is used when the product surface must not be touched
and when the accuracy of label placement is important.
■
The tamp-down technique is suitable for pressure-sensitive labeling and uses a
positive tamp action to ensure the complete label adhesion on the package.
■
The wipe-on method is suitable for pressure-sensitive labeling when the
product is moving at a reliably constant speed.
In fact, most automatic label applicators fall into these two categories and use one or
more of these three techniques. However, the applicators come in different forms and
shapes supporting different features, depending on the application requirements. Not all
of them are fully automatic. So, there are other ways of categorizing the label applica-
tors. Some of these are:
■
Automatic label applicators These are the machines that are typically used
on production lines. We have already discussed these under the wipe-on and
pneumatic piston applicator categories.Automatic bottle labeling is another
example.
■
Semi-automatic label applicators In these applicators, part of the process
is not automated. For example, the product might have to be manually staged
for labeling.A variant of bottle labeling and handheld label applicators fall in
this category.A handheld applicator is used to wipe the labels onto the prod-
ucts in a way similar to a pricing gun used in retail stores.
■
Print and apply label applicators This is a system that offers an integrated
solution by combining smart label printing and label applying functionalities.
The label applicator part of the system can be either wipe-on or pneumatic
piston, as described earlier.
An effective RFID system or network consists of diverse hardware, software, and
logic to automate the identiﬁcation and tracking process.An important component of
automation is event-based action. For example, tell someone when a problem occurs, ask
the reader to read when a tagged item shows up, and so on.This is where feedback sys-
tems come onto the scene.
Feedback Systems
Feedback systems in an RFID network, usually based on sensors, help the system run in
an effective and automatic fashion.The input and output ports in an RFID system are
used to integrate feedback with the system. For example, turning on or off lights or
sound alerts could have a predetermined meaning as a feedback on the status of a pro-
www.syngress.com
236
Chapter 9 • Working with RFID Peripherals

cess. For instance, warning noise and a red light might indicate missing items on a ship-
ping pallet. Feedback systems, in general, are used for two purposes:
■
Report problems with the system, e.g., to trigger a manual intervention.
■
Perform an action within the RFID network based on an event—for example,
to trigger the reader only when some tagged item shows up.This helps auto-
mate the RFID system.
Commonly used feedback systems or devices used in RFID systems or networks
include photo eyes, light trees, horns, and motion sensors.
Photo Eyes
A photo eye, in general, is a sensor that detects the presence of something coming and
reports the presence to another device.A photo eye works as an input device to an
RFID system. It can be used as a proximity sensor that can provide presence and direc-
tion information of a load. For example, a photo eye sees an item coming on a conveyor
and triggers the reader to begin reading. It can also be used to determine a good or bad
read—that is, a good or bad tag.A bad read can prompt actions such as stopping the
conveyor and triggering a light tree.
So, the following are some of the advantages of photo eyes in an RFID network:
■
A photo eye can detect and tell the RFID portal when to start scanning a load
passing along the conveyor.This minimizes the scan time and helps avoid
interference between adjacent RFID readers.
■
In conjunction with some business logic, a photo eye can also be used for veri-
ﬁcation of tags: they are properly encoded and placed.
Light Trees
A light tree refers to a stack of lights, connected to an output port of an RFID system,
used as a feedback system.The light tree works as an output device because it reports
some output of an RFID operation to the operator. It might be used to report a success,
a failure, a warning, or information.A light tree is typically controlled by a software pro-
gram called an agent.The agent forwards commands to the hardware to turn the tree
lights on and off.As a practical example, in Websphere, IBM’s software platform inte-
grated with RFID, the following are the parameters of a light tree agent to dictate the
behavior of the light tree:
■
duration.ms.beep Represents the amount of time to signal when a beep
request is received.The default value is 500 ms.
■
ignore.green.while.red Dictates whether any green light indicators should
be ignored if the light tree is currently red.The default value is false.
www.syngress.com
Working with RFID Peripherals • Chapter 9
237

■
duration.ms.green Represents the amount of time to signal when a green
light request is received.The default value is 2000 ms.
■
duration.ms.red Represents the amount of time to signal when a red light
request is received.The default value is 2000 ms.
Table 9.6 presents some standard light signals, with examples, commonly used in
RFID systems.A combined scenario using all three lights (green, yellow, and red) is pre-
sented in Exercise 9.2.
Table 9.6 Some Standard Light Signals Used in RFID Systems
Light 
General Indicator
Example Scenario
Green or red
Success or failure
1. On a platform such as a pallet, when the con-
tainers are scanned, the system attempts to
match the container tag with a purchase order in
the database. If the scanned tag matches the pur-
chase order, a green light displays on the light
tree and the shipment can proceed; otherwise, a
red light displays.
2. On a portal such as a dock door, a green light
indicates that an expected item is received,
whereas a red light indicates that an unexpected
item is received.
Yellow
Warning 
1. A yellow light can indicate that a worker is in
an area where his safety will be compromised. 
2. A yellow light can indicate improper tempera-
ture in the area where a reader is installed.
Flashing 
Attention
1. On a door at the back of a retail store, RFID 
(blinking)
readers and antennas are installed for receiving a
shipment. As a box passes an RFID antenna, a
ﬂashing yellow light tells an operator that the tag
on the box has been read.
2. An RFID reader reading tags on a pallet
encounters an anomaly such as a faulty tag and
triggers a ﬂashing red light to tell the operator
that a manual intervention is necessary. 
EXERCISE 9.2
Consider a receiving station of a supply point where all the pallets are ofﬂoaded
from a container and are put into the inventory of the supply point. An RFID-
enabled forklift unloads the container and reads the tags on the pallets, and the
www.syngress.com
238
Chapter 9 • Working with RFID Peripherals

application adds these pallets to the bulk storage inventory of this supply point.
After ofﬂoading the container, the forklift takes each pallet to the distribution
area. A door portal (connected to a host computer running a software applica-
tion) has been set in the distribution area to ensure that no case has been
removed from any pallet. The RFID system on the portal also has a light tree
that consists of green, red, and yellow lights. How can this light tree be used as
a feedback system for this application?
Solution:
■
A yellow light can indicate that a case tag has been read.
■
A green light can indicate that a pallet has been found intact; no
case from this pallet is missing.
■
A red light can indicate that something is missing from the pallet. In
this case, a manual count could be performed.
The light tree uses light as a medium for output signals.There are output devices
called horns that use sound as a medium for output (feedback) signals.
Horns
A horn is a feedback device that gets the attention of the operator by making a sound. It
works as an output device in an RFID system. For example, the RFID system on a
forklift may be equipped with an impact sensor. When the impact exceeds a speciﬁed
value, the sensor reports it to the RFID system, which triggers the forklift’s horn. Horns
are generally used under extreme situations that require immediate attention, such as
theft, intrusion, emergency, and so on.
Motion Sensors
A motion sensor is a device that detects the movement of an object in its surroundings
by using some kind of waves such as ultrasonic waves, which are sound waves beyond
the human ear’s hearing capability. Such a sensor works as an input device to an RFID
system.The wave emitted by the sensor is reﬂected by the object to the sensor, which
then calculates the distance of the object from it.The changing distance (or position) of
the object means the object is moving. Motion sensors can be used in an RFID system
to indicate the arrival of tagged items at a portal such as a dock door. In this case, the
RFID system, after getting the alert from the sensor, will trigger the reader to read the
arrived items.The motion sensors can also be used against theft by combining them
with the tags attached to the item that must not be moved.A motion of that tagged
item will trigger the motion sensor, which in turn will trigger some alarm system.
www.syngress.com
Working with RFID Peripherals • Chapter 9
239

So, feedback systems and devices report problems with the RFID network and help
further automate the RFID system by facilitating event-based action. Event-based action
means an action performed when a certain event occurs. For example, start a read cycle
if an item is detected in a certain area. Such automation gives rise to powerful RFID
systems such as real-time location systems.
Real-Time Location Systems 
A real-time location system (RTLS) is an RFID system that automatically and continu-
ously tracks and reports in real time the location of assets and personnel that are tagged
to be tracked.An RTLS designed to track moving objects typically works as follows:
■
Moving tags  An item that needs to be tracked is tagged typically with an
active tag that regularly transmits signals at some time intervals.The tag, of
course, contains the unique identiﬁcation code for the item.
■
Stationary readers At certain locations, stationary readers are waiting for the
tagged items to pass. When a tagged item passes through this location, the
readers receive the signal from the tag because the tag is continuously transmit-
ting. Upon receiving a signal from the tag, they collect the information from
the tag about the item, and they determine the location of the item.The
readers send the location and the item data to a monitoring system.
■
Monitoring system The monitoring system receives the location informa-
tion about an item being tracked from the readers.
CAUTION
A wide variety of RTLS can be designed. Depending on the application require-
ments, an RTLS can use both active and passive tags and can be used to track
both moving and stationary objects.
Note the difference between a usual RFID portal and an RTLS. In a typical RFID
portal, the tags are read when they pass the portal as part of a structured process, whereas
RTLS tags are read automatically and regularly, independent of the process that moves
the tags. With RTLS, no intervention or controlled process is needed to determine asset
location; it is automated.
RTLS can continuously determine and track the real-time location of moving assets
and personnel using active RFID tags attached to moving objects.Another type of
RTLS, also called local locating system (LLS), can be designed to track objects in a con-
strained location (indoor or outdoor) for tracking assets within a corporate facility. In
www.syngress.com
240
Chapter 9 • Working with RFID Peripherals

this case, readers are installed at key locations within a facility.Active tags attached to
objects typically broadcast their identity at regular intervals.
NOTE
In an RTLS, a tag is generally read by multiple readers installed at different
points in a location. Each reader can determine its distance from the object by
the time it took to get the response for its signal sent to the tag on the object.
By putting together the distances of the object from all the readers and the
locations of all the readers, the system can accurately calculate the exact loca-
tion of the object. If the number of readers involved is three, this technique is
called the triangulation technique.
RTLS are getting popular in many ﬁelds, including healthcare, manufacturing, and
logistics, where they help locate and manage high-value assets in daily operations.
Following are some examples of the use and advantages of RLTS:
■
Efﬁciently and automatically identify and track valuable assets to ensure that
these assets remain in the facility.This helps reduce theft.
■
Track patients and doctors within a hospital facility. Without an RTLS, ﬁnding
doctors, nurses, or patients at critical times without delay could be a challenge.
■
RTLS can also help address patient safety and security issues. For example, an
RTLS can be used to trigger an alarm if the wearer of a tag leaves a certain
perimeter, the authorized or safe area.
■
RTLS can help you save time that you would otherwise waste in looking for
things. RTLS will tell you exactly where the things are.
The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■
RFID printers help integrate the barcode technology with RFID technology
as they are used to print smart labels like barcode labels and write data to and
read data from the tags that exist inside the smart labels.
■
An automatic label applicator applies labels to products, typically on produc-
tion lines, in an automatic fashion using one of three labeling techniques:
blow-on, temp-down, or wipe-on.
■
Photo eyes and motion sensors are input feedback devices, whereas light trees
and horns are output feedback devices.

Summary
Smart labels represent the junction between two technologies: barcode and RFID. Smart
labels are created using an RFID peripheral device called an RFID printer, which can
print human-readable information on the surface of a label and can write data to the
transponder (tag) inside the label. Furthermore, an RFID printer can verify the correct-
ness of the data on the tag and can void the smart labels with faulty tags inside them.
Smart labels, created by an RFID printer, can be applied by automatic label applicators
to the items that need to be tracked.An automatic label applicator applies labels to prod-
ucts, typically on production lines, in an automatic fashion using one of three labeling
techniques: blow-on, temp-down, or wipe-on. In the tamp-down technique, the label is
simply pressed against the item; in a wipe-on technique, the label is tamped down with
the help of a foam roller; and in the blow-on technique, the label is blown onto the
item by a blast of air.
Once you have deployed an RFID system, including peripheral devices, you always
need to monitor the system in operation.There will be operational and performance
issues and problems with the system and its components. How can you troubleshoot
problems with an RFID system? The next chapter explores this topic.

 RFID printers can print information on the surface of a label and can read
information from the tag inside the label as well as write information to it.
 RFID printers typically support smart labels with HF (13.56 MHz) and UHF
(915 MHz) tags.
 The width and depth of a smart label depend on the size of the tag inside.
 An RFID printer, on average, takes about 2 seconds to print one label.
 Automated label applicators are capable of placing labels consistently in the
same place on each item to the accuracy of 0.5 mm and at high speed, up to
80 m/minute or 20 packages per minute.
 There are three main labeling techniques:
 The blow-on technique is used when the product surface must not be touched
and when the accuracy of label placement is important.
 The tamp-down technique is suitable for pressure-sensitive labeling; it uses a
positive tamp action to ensure the complete label adhesion on the package.
 The wipe-on method is suitable for pressure-sensitive labeling when the
product is moving at a reliably constant speed.

Introduction
After you have designed and installed your RFID system, what will inevitably come
next? The answer to this question is problems, all kinds of problems, including reader
failure, tag failure, network connectivity problems, and so on.This is where monitoring
and troubleshooting enter the scene.
An RFID system is made of three components: hardware, software, and data.The
hardware consists of tags, readers, and antennas.The software largely consists of middle-
ware that manages to take the data from the reader to the enterprise applications; it
comprises the nervous system of the EPCglobal network. Monitoring your RFID
system involves status monitoring and performance monitoring. Performance moni-
toring involves measuring some performance metrics.To ﬁnd the causes for the prob-
lems identiﬁed during monitoring, you will need to troubleshoot the system.
So, the core question addressed in this chapter is how to monitor and troubleshoot
an RFID system. In search of an answer, we will explore three avenues: monitoring,
measuring performance metrics, and troubleshooting.
Monitoring an RFID System
Monitoring any system is essential to foreseeing and detecting problems and keeping the
system running effectively. Because RFID is an evolving technology, you might ﬁnd a
lack of literature available to guide you in monitoring and troubleshooting an RFID
system. However, most of the important research and development in any discipline
occurs by people applying analogies to the way similar problems were solved in related
disciplines and building on experience acquired in the same discipline. RFID is a closely
related ﬁeld to IT, if not a part of it.
The ﬁrst lesson we can apply from the IT world is that RFID systems should sup-
port remote monitoring and troubleshooting of equipment, to improve efﬁciency and
effectiveness. System manageability requires that good RFID solutions incorporate
remote management, which will include remotely monitoring equipment, remotely
identifying problems and their causes, providing alerts for problems such as failures, and
supporting both problem troubleshooting and problem resolution.
So, the monitoring techniques used in IT and other ﬁelds can be applied in some
way to RFID. In this section we will discuss some of those techniques in the context of
RFID.A very important problem-solving methodology used in many ﬁelds, including
IT, is root-cause analysis.
Understanding Root-Cause Analysis
Organizations often have problems that afﬂict their operations and result in reduced
proﬁts and increased customer dissatisfaction. Quite often, organizations try to ﬁx a
problem quickly by addressing the symptoms on the surface and without ever ﬁnding
what really caused the problem in the ﬁrst place.This approach causes the problems to
248
Chapter 10 • Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems
www.syngress.com

reoccur over and over again.The goal of root-cause analysis (RCA) is to prevent the
problem from reoccurring by ﬁnding and eliminating the root causes. In other words,
RCA is the application of a set of problem-solving methods based on identifying and
eliminating (or correcting) the root causes of a problem.The fundamental assumption in
the RCA approach is that the problems are best solved by correcting or eliminating the
root causes, as opposed to merely addressing the immediate, obvious symptoms that
appear on the surface.
TIP
By applying corrective measures to root causes once, you must not expect that
the problems will disappear forever, even though that is the goal. You can only
hope that the likelihood of problem recurrence will be minimized, because com-
pletely preventing a problem from reoccuring through a one-time intervention
is not always possible. Look at RCA as an iterative process and a tool for contin-
uous improvement.
RCA involves different approaches from a variety of ﬁelds for getting at the root
causes of a problem.The main approaches are:
■
Barrier analysis According to this approach, the root causes of a problem
exist in failed or missing barriers such as safety measures, unrecognized risks, or
inadequate safety engineering.The process of ﬁnding the root causes includes
assessing the adequacy of deployed barriers or recognizing the lack of barriers.
This approach, which has its origin in the ﬁelds of accident investigation and
occupational safety and health, is also called safety-based RCA.
■
Change analysis  According to this approach, the root cause of a problem
often exists at the level of strategic management and organizational culture. To
ﬁnd the root cause, compare the process with the unsuccessful outcome to a
similar process with a successful outcome.This approach has its origin in the
ﬁelds of change management, risk management, and system management and
is also called system-based RCA.
■
Events and causal factors analysis According to this approach, the root
causes of a problem lie in not conforming to one or more of the steps in a
process.This is similar to the malfunctioning of one step out of a set of
sequential steps in a production line. Finding the root causes here includes
examining the events, related conditions, and causal factors in chronological
order.This approach has its origin in the ﬁelds of quality control for industrial
manufacturing and is also called production-based RCA.
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10
249
www.syngress.com

■
Tree-diagram analysis This approach, an extension of the events and causal
factor analysis, assumes that the root causes of a problem lie in the process
failure in general.The underlying philosophy of this approach is that you can
eliminate the recurrence of problems and increase performance by improving
processes. Finding the root causes using this approach includes creating and
using tree diagrams describing the factors contributing to the event that caused
the problem.This approach is also called process-based RCA.
Depending on your organization, your system, and the problem, you can determine
which of these RCA approaches is suitable for you. However, the general high-level
process for performing root-cause analysis is the same:
1.
Identify and clearly deﬁne the problem.
2.
Gather the relevant data, including evidence.
3.
Identify the causal factors: all the causes or problems that contributed to the
occurrence of this problem.
4.
Find root causes for each causal factor, and iteratively arrive at the ultimate
root cause of the problem.
5.
Develop recommendations for solutions.
6.
Implement the approved solutions.
So, keep the following principles of RCA in mind:
■
Applying corrective measures to root causes of a problem is more effective
than just addressing the symptoms of the problem.
■
To get optimal results, RCA must be performed in a systematic fashion, and its
conclusions must be backed up by evidence.
■
There can be (and usually is) more than one root cause for a given problem.
So far, we have discussed RCA in general. But how does it apply to an RFID
system? RFID is an evolving part of the IT industry. In the IT industry, it is a common
practice to look at various data inputs from related incidents and identify the root causes
by recognizing the correlations between those incidents.The same practice is being
applied in its basic form to RFID systems.
The important point here is that in system problem solving, you need to go beyond
just core monitoring of individual devices and collect some data that will help trou-
bleshoot the problem. Is this data available from normal operation, or do you collect it
just for troubleshooting the problem? This brings us to a discussion of the various types
of monitoring.

Chapter 10 • Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems

Understanding Monitoring
To monitor a system, you need information (data) about the system. For example, to
monitor an RFID system, you will need information from readers. Depending on how
you receive this information, there are two kinds of monitoring:
■
Nonintrusive monitoring In this type of monitoring, you use the informa-
tion that is available from normal operation.Therefore, you place no extra
requirement for information on the RFID system. For example, all the infor-
mation that a reader gathers from normal interrogation of a tag falls into this
category.
■
Intrusive monitoring This is a type of monitoring that requires collecting
the information that is not available from normal operation of the system. For
example, your reader might offer commands that you can issue to gather infor-
mation about its internal status or condition.This kind of intrusive information
can help you detect (or predict) problems that might not be evident from non-
intrusive information.
Usually nonintrusive information is enough to ﬁnd the status of a device, such as a
reader—for example, whether it’s working or not. However, nonintrusive information
might be needed to look deeply into a problem and ﬁnd the root cause.
NOTE
Nonintrusive monitoring might be good enough to check the status of a reader,
whereas intrusive monitoring might be needed to get a deeper insight into the
system, to ﬁnd the root cause of a problem or to predict a future problem. 
From the perspective of the system details that you want to monitor, there are two
kinds of monitoring: status monitoring and performance monitoring.
Status Monitoring
Status monitoring consists of monitoring the basic status of the system and the devices in
the system, such as the following:
■
Is the device connected to the network?
■
Are the devices powered?
■
Are the antennas operating?
■
Is a reader reading the tags successfully?
www.syngress.com
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10
251

Some solutions include a status indicator panel on your desktop that will allow you
to monitor the status of all readers from one location. Feedback systems such as light
tree and horns, discussed in Chapter 9, can also play an important role in this type of
monitoring.
The next level of detail in monitoring is performance monitoring.
Performance Monitoring
Performance monitoring consists of monitoring the performance of a system and the
devices in the system, such as the following:
■
Read rates of readers
■
Reading accuracy
■
Error frequency: how frequently an error occurs
The performance data on predetermined metrics such as read rates helps determine
the normal behavior of the system and identify the variance in the normal behavior and
hence a problem. For this reason, performance monitoring is also called behavior monitoring.
Equipped with this understanding of monitoring your RFID system, you are ready
to explore ways to troubleshoot an interrogation zone.
Monitoring and 
Troubleshooting Interrogation Zones
You often monitor a system by monitoring a set of metrics.A metric is an observable
property that can be measured. It’s also called a quantity.A metric is composed of some
parameters that deﬁne the system and its performance. Following are the parameters that
characterize an interrogation zone:
■
Reader failure
■
Number of tags passing through an interrogation zone
■
Number of tags being successfully read
■
Number of tags that are not being successfully read (read errors)
Based on these parameters, you can deﬁne metrics that can be measured or calculated
based on the measurements and that will indicate the status of an RFID system and its
performance. Some examples of such metrics are discussed in the following sections.
Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
Mean time between failures (MTBF) is the average time between two consecutive failures
of a device or a system. Usually there is an underlying assumption in calculating MTBF:
www.syngress.com
252
Chapter 10 • Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems

After each failure, the system is ﬁxed and returned to service immediately.This is a mea-
sure of reliability, robustness, and stability of the system. It can be applied to system com-
ponents or to the system itself. In our case, the system is the RFID system and the
components are the antennas, readers, host computer, and other network elements.
What do we mean by a failure? We need to deﬁne that. For example, on one
extreme, you can consider that a reader has failed if it’s not operational at all; on the
other end of the spectrum, you could consider it failed when it misses a tag read or cre-
ates read error. In general, you can determine a threshold of read errors, and when the
number of read errors exceeds the threshold, the reader may be considered failed.
MTBF indicates the robustness of the system measured in the past and, based on
that measurement, predicts the rate of failure in the near future. MTBF can be calculated
using the following simple equation:
MTBF = TL/NF
where:
■
TL is the total lifetime (or operation time) of the device or the system over
which the MTBF is being measured.
■
NF is the total number of failures recorded.
For example, if a reader fails twice during 200 hours of operation, the MTBF can be
calculated as in the following:
MTBF = TL/NF = 200/2 = 100 hours
A more involved example is presented in Exercise 10.1.
EXERCISE 10.1
You have an RFID system with 100 readers. You have collected reader failure
data for 200 hours. During this time, 10 readers failed once and another set of
ﬁve readers failed twice (each of the ﬁve readers failed twice). What is the MTBF
of this system?
Solution:
TL = 100 readers  x 200 hours = 20,000 reader hours
NF =  10 + 5 x 2 = 20 reader failures
MTBF = TL/NF = 20,000 reader hours / 20 reader failures = 1000
hours/failure
A reader reads tags. So, tag trafﬁc rate is obviously another metric of interest.
www.syngress.com
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10
253

Average Tag Trafﬁc Volume
Average tag trafﬁc volume (ATTV) is the average number of tags passing through an inter-
rogation zone during an interval of time.The interval can be a minute, 10 minutes, an
hour, or whatever you determine it to be.This metric is important for the following two
reasons:
■
It indicates how much load the reader has to deal with on a portal.
■
When a reader reads a tag, it typically sends the collected data to a host com-
puter. So the tag trafﬁc increases the data trafﬁc in the network.
To measure ATTV, the monitoring system collects the following data from the
readers:
■
Tag counts 
■
The time at which the tag was counted
With this data, the ATTV can be calculated using the following equation:
ATTV = 1/N Si=Ni=1 ti
where:
■
N is the number of intervals for which the measurement is being taken.
■
ti is the number of tags counted during an interval denoted by i.
Let’s work through a simple example.Assume that you determine the interval to be
15 minutes, and you collect the data over an hour. In the four quarters of the hour, 50,
35, 30, and 45 tags are detected, respectively. So, you can calculate the ATTV as shown
in the following:
ATTV = 1/N ∑i=Ni=1 ti = 1/4 (50 + 35 + 30 + 45) = 160/4 = 40 tags per 15 min-
utes
How do you determine the time interval? That depends on your application and the
system requirements. But keep in mind that if your interval is too long, say, a few hours,
you cannot see the pattern of trafﬁc (how the trafﬁc changes during this interval), and if
your pattern is too short, you’ll have too many data points to deal with unnecessarily.
So, the ATTV indicates the following:
■
How much tag trafﬁc is ﬂowing through the interrogation zone
■
The pattern of trafﬁc, that is, how the trafﬁc changes with time; for example,
you can see the pattern by taking 24 measurements of ATTV each day
From the ATTV measurements, you can predict how much trafﬁc is expected to pass
through an interrogation zone during a certain period.The accuracy of this prediction
www.syngress.com
254
Chapter 10 • Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems

partly depends on the amount of data that was collected to make this prediction, that is,
the statistical uncertainty.
Actual Versus Predicted Trafﬁc Rate 
It’s always of interest to measure the variance between the predicted values of a metric
with its actual value.Actual versus predicted trafﬁc rate (APTR) is the variance of the
actual tag trafﬁc from the predicted tag trafﬁc through an interrogation zone over a time
period.The predicted tag trafﬁc rate can come from the ATTV measurements in the
past.A signiﬁcant variance of actual trafﬁc rate from the predicted trafﬁc rate could indi-
cate a problem with the system.
The APTR can be calculated using the following equation:
APTR =  1/N ∑i=Ni=1  (ta - tp)
where:
■
N is the number of intervals for which the actual measurement is taken.
■
ta is the actual current ATTV.
■
tp is the predicted ATTV from the past measurements.
The larger the magnitude of APTR, the larger the variance of the actual value from
the predicted value, and therefore the louder is the alarm that there could be something
wrong with the system. Make sure you are comparing the actual value to the predicted
value for the same time interval, because the predicted (and also the actual) values for
different time intervals could be different. For example, in a given day, there might be
more tag trafﬁc from 2:00 to 3:00 P.M. than from 7:00 to 8:00 A.M.
Read Errors to Total Reads Rate 
Read errors to total reads rate (RETR) is the total number of read errors divided by the
total number of read attempts.A read error is reader’s a failed attempt to read a tag.The
measure of RETR can indicate the problems that caused the read errors, including:
■
A faulty antenna
■
Faulty tags or improperly tagged items
■
Improper placement of antennas 
■
Low signal strength
■
Signal interference, signal absorption, or any other adverse environmental effect
To measure RETR, the monitoring system collects the data about number of read
errors, number of successful reads, and the time interval during which these read
attempts were made. With this data collected for a few intervals, you can calculate
RETR using the following equation:
www.syngress.com
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10
255

RETR = (∑i=Ni=1  Ei) / (∑i=Ni=1  Ei   + ∑i=Ni=1  Si) = 1 / (1+ ∑i=Ni=1  Si  /
∑i=Ni=1  Ei )
where:
■
N is the number of intervals for which the measurements are taken.
■
Ei is the number of read errors during the interval i.
■
Si is the number of successful reads during the interval i.
A high value for RETR should be taken as an alarm for a problem with the RFID
system (or portal): either an internal problem or due to adverse environmental effects
such as absorption and interference.
The value of RETR can change over time.
Read Error Change Rate 
Read error change rate (RECR) is the variance of RETR over time. It indicates the insta-
bility or unreliability of the RFID system. For example, a continuous increase or ﬂuctu-
ation in the value of RETR indicates an underlying problem with the system. Upon
troubleshooting, you might ﬁnd a fault with the design of the system or with the hard-
ware components.

Solution:
ATTV =  1/N ∑i=Ni=1 ti = (1/6) (45 + 50 + 35 + 60 + 55 + 31)
= 276/6 = 46 tags per 10 minutes
∑i=Ni=1  Si  / ∑i=Ni=1  Ei  = 600/50 = 12
RETR =  1 / (1+ 12) = 1/13 = 1/13
Or simply:
RETR = 50 / (50 + 600) = 50/650 = 1/13
A reader reads tags in its interrogation zone. Readability problems can also occur
due to faulty tags.
Monitoring and Troubleshooting Tags
Even though the process of manufacturing of tags and their application to items has sig-
niﬁcantly matured, tag failures do still occur due to various reasons.Therefore, moni-
toring and troubleshooting tags are important tasks for an RFID professional. First of all,
you need to ensure that the tags are properly placed on items. Furthermore, you need to
know the reasons the tags can fail and how to manage tag failures.The tags are placed
on items to be tracked before the items get out into the world. So, the ﬁrst step in mon-
itoring tags is to identify improperly tagged items.
Identifying Improperly Tagged Items
Proper tag placement on items that need to be tagged is crucial to the success of an
RFID application.The challenge is to choose the right spot on an item where the tag
will be placed.The right spot really depends on the kind of item; it will vary from one
type of item to another.Therefore, testing to choose the right spot is necessary before
you start using label applicators to place labels on a mass scale.
Even after you have chosen the right spot to place tags on items, there will be mis-
placed or improperly placed tags, which will cause problems. So, it’s important to iden-
tify those tags.There are four kinds of improperly tagged items:
■
Items that are tagged with faulty tags.
■
Items on which the tags are placed incorrectly, where they cannot be read
properly by the reader.
■
Items on which the tags are placed at the correct spots but on which the tags
are applied incorrectly, perhaps bent or folded.
■
Items on which the tags are not properly oriented when correct orientation is
required for efﬁcient reading.
www.syngress.com
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10
257

Tags can fail due to the defects introduced during manufacturing, and manufac-
turing defect rates are relatively high in smart labels, discussed in Chapter 9. If you are
using smart label printers to print these labels, it will identify the smart label with a
faulty tag and mark it void. For pre-encoded smart labels, you will lose the identiﬁcation
numbers (serial numbers) along with the faulty label.
Following are some of the methods for identifying improperly tagged items:
■
Inventory discrepancies can indicate improperly tagged items because the tags
on the items were not properly read; hence the items were not counted.
■
Some feedback devices, such as photo eyes and motion sensors, provide the
presence information of an item and instruct the reader to read it. If the reader
cannot see it, it could be an improperly tagged item.
■
Improperly tagged items can also be identiﬁed by combining the information
from the sensors with the logic in the software.
■
Improperly tagged items can be identiﬁed during automatic application of
labels by placing an interrogation portal right after the application point—for
example, on a read portal. If the tag cannot be read, it might be defective or
improperly placed.
■
You can also identify improperly tagged items via manual inspection, perhaps
before shipping.
The tags on improperly tagged items are prime for failure.There are, however, a
multitude of reasons that a tag would fail.
Identifying Reasons for Tag Failures
A tag failure can be deﬁned as the inability of a properly functioning reader to detect a
tag when it’s scanning its interrogation zone. In other words, a tag is considered failed
when a reader cannot detect it when the tag is within the reader’s read range. By identi-
fying and understanding the reasons for tag failures, you can take steps to avoid failures,
identify failures, and ﬁx problems, thereby optimizing the performance of your RFID
system. Following are the main reasons for tag failures:
■
Manufacturing defects These are defects that are introduced during manu-
facturing.They can be detected in the process of testing or applying the tag.
For example, if you are using a smart label printer to print these labels, it will
identify the smart label that has a faulty tag and mark it void.The printer can
also introduce the error because it can write to the tag inside the smart label.
■

■
ESD The ESD, discussed in Chapter 8, can damage the transistors in a tag’s IC
and thereby cause the tag to malfunction.
■
Harsh environmental conditions Harsh environmental conditions can
cause adverse effects that can affect tag detection in the following ways:
■
Some conditions such as extreme temperature can damage tags, causing
them to fail.
■
Some materials in the environment can cause effects such as interference,
reﬂection, diffraction, and scattering that can prevent the reader from prop-
erly communicating with the tag, making it look as though the tag does
not exist.
■
Tags can also be damaged by mishandling of the tagged items.
■
The material of the package surface or the content can affect the tag read.
For example, the read rates could be very low for tags placed on metallic
containers due to reﬂection and interference problems.
■
Improper placement An improperly placed tag on an item can be damaged
or simply might not be detected by the reader. Improper placement includes
the wrong spot on the item for the tag; the wrong way to place the tag, such
as folding it; or the wrong orientation of the tag.
■
Dense tag environment The dense tag environment, discussed in Chapter
4, also prevents a tag from being detected by a reader. For example, the shad-
owing effect created by the dense tag environment prevents a tag from being
read by the reader.
To ﬁx the problems caused by tag failures and to control the damage, you need to
manage tag failures.
Managing Tag Failures
Tag failures can have a signiﬁcant impact on the effectiveness and efﬁciency of an RFID
system.Therefore, it is very important to manage tag failures.You can improve system
performance by identifying and possibly ﬁxing tag failures before the tagged items get
into the tracking network. In general, you need to manage tag failure before applying
the tags, during the tag application process, and after the tag application, when the item
is being tracked.
Management Prior to Applying Tags
Some integrated automatic tag application solutions offer the following failed tag man-
agement features:
■
Identify and eliminate the faulty tags prior to applying them to the items.
www.syngress.com
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10
259

■
Track the statistics on the failed tags and communicate them to the RFID vali-
dation stations.
Management during Application
You can set up a test interrogation portal (zone) immediately after the point where the
tags are being applied by an automatic applicator.The idea behind managing the tag
failure prior to and during tag application is to prevent these tags entering the tracking
system.You will certainly improve system performance by identifying and ﬁxing tag
failure problems before they enter the tracking system. However, tag failures do occur
when the items are being tracked, and you need to manage those failures as well.
Management after Applying the Tags/During Tracking
The items with failed tags that are being tracked will generate data inconsistencies such
as inventory discrepancies.To deal with such problems, it is important that tag failures
are identiﬁed and the information reported to the application program or the database
management system automatically.The EPCglobal network helps in management of
failed tag data in the tracking system by making the information about the globally
tracked items visible throughout the tracking system, such as supply chain.This network
consists of ﬁve elements:
■
EPC The identiﬁcation number on the tag that uniquely identiﬁes the tagged
item.
■
EPC tags and readers The reader reads the tag of an item being tracked
and sends its EPC to a host computer or application system running object
naming service (ONS).
■
ONS A mechanism that uses domain name system (DNS) on the Internet to
discover the information about an object that has been tagged with an EPC
number (unique ID). ONS itself does not contain the information about the
object, but it knows where the information is; for example, it knows the IP
addresses of the servers that have the information.
■
Physical markup language (PML) A language that is used to write the
data (information) about the object in the format that is convenient for com-
munication. Once the information about an object is found, that needs to be
communicated. PML is used to store and communicate that information.
Because this information should be available throughout the EPCglobal net-
work, we need a distributed data management system.That’s where Savant
enters the picture.
■
Savant A speciﬁcation developed by the Auto-ID center at MIT for a soft-
ware system in the middle of data sources such as readers and enterprise appli-

260
Chapter 10 • Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems

cations. It provides a distributed data management system that manages the
data for the objects being tracked in the EPCglobal network.Application-level
events (ALE) is the new name of the game in this ﬁeld.
NOTE
Details about Savant and ALE are outside the scope of this work. However, you
should know why ALE is known as the speciﬁcation for application event manage-
ment systems. An event is deﬁned as some occurrence of interest in a device or a
system. For example, a successful read of a tag by a reader is an event, and so is a
read error. Managing the data from these events is called event management.
In the context of managing the elements of an RFID system (e.g., tags and readers),
you should also be aware of Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), which is
used to remotely manage devices connected to a TCP/IP network and is based on two
components, agent and manager.An agent, which is housed in a managed object, gathers
information about the object (device).A manager sends requests to the agent to get
information about the object and to execute commands on the object.
Once you ﬁnd an item with a failed tag, what would you do? Depending on the sit-
uation, here are some of the solutions:
■
Use a backup such as a barcode when you print the smart labels.This will
come in handy if the tag in the smart label fails.
■
Fix the tag, if it’s ﬁxable.
■
Replace the tag with another tag.
An RFID system is composed of three elements: hardware, software, and data.
Readers and tags can be considered hardware components that have data.There are
some general techniques to monitor and troubleshoot hardware failures, which we dis-
cuss next.
Monitoring and 
Troubleshooting Hardware
A hardware failure is the failure of a hardware component to function to its speciﬁcations.
As an RFID professional, you should understand the causes of hardware failures and
know the tips and techniques for diagnosing and troubleshooting hardware problems.
www.syngress.com
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10
261

Understanding the Causes of Hardware Failures
An RFID system can experience hardware failures for a number of reasons, including
the following:
■
Damaged hardware components Following are some of the reasons for
this damage:
■
Harsh environmental conditions such as extreme temperatures can damage
hardware components.
■
Unregulated power supply of any sort can damage hardware components.
This includes power surges from the regular power line or from lightning.
■
ESD and improper grounding of equipment can also contribute to the
failure of hardware components.
■
Incompatible hardware components This could include readers and tags
using different communication protocols or methods.
■
Unperformed reader ﬁrmware upgrades Firmware upgrades were dis-
cussed in Chapter 3.The basic idea is that the readers’ ﬁrmware must be com-
patible with the protocols being used by the tags that the reader is trying to
read.The protocols are still evolving, so it’s very important that you buy
readers whose ﬁrmware is upgradeable.
TIP
Before starting to troubleshoot it, restart a misbehaving hardware component
such as a reader to see if that simple action solves the problem. However, con-
sider the consequences and impact of restarting a component of a running
system. Thinking through a proposed solution is always a good idea.
Diagnosing RFID Hardware Failures
Following are some tips to diagnose and troubleshoot hardware failures:
■
Change Find out what has changed since the last time a failing component
was working properly.The change could include the installation of new soft-
ware or a new hardware component in the system.This step is always a good
start in troubleshooting.
■
Veriﬁcation Sometimes within a system, it’s not obvious that it is a given
hardware component that is causing the problem. In that case you need to
www.syngress.com
262
Chapter 10 • Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems

verify the failure of that hardware component. One way of doing that is to
replace the suspect component with a component that has just been tested and
found working. If after replacement the problem goes away, you can conclude
that the replaced component is failing.
■
Start simple Try the simplest thing ﬁrst. For example, make sure the compo-
nent is powered on if it is supposed to be, and inspect the cable connections—
for example, between the interrogator and the antenna and between the
interrogator and the network, and so on.
■
Network reachability To check the network connection and reachability,
you can use the ping command, which is part of TCP/IP.
CAUTION
When you are replacing or repairing a hardware component, take safety precau-
tions. For example, make sure the power to the component is turned off.
Sometimes it’s obvious that a hardware component has failed. Other times it’s not,
and you simply conclude from a problem that the system is experiencing a hardware
component failure. In this case, you need to troubleshoot the problem.
Standard Troubleshooting Procedure
The following standard procedure works well for both hardware and software trou-
bleshooting:
1.
Identify and deﬁne the problem You identify and deﬁne the problem
clearly by performing the following steps:
a.
Establish symptoms You do this by observing the problem and col-
lecting information about the problem.
b.
Identify the affected area You need to identify which area of the
system is affected by the problem.
If you have identiﬁed and deﬁned the problem, in most cases you should
be able to reproduce it.
2.
Identify causes of the problem  Once you have identiﬁed and deﬁned the
problem, the next step is to ﬁnd what is causing the problem. Remember, the
cause of a problem could be another problem.The ﬁrst step toward ﬁnding the
cause is to ask what has changed since the last time the system was working
ﬁne. Use the method of elimination to narrow down and isolate the real cause.
www.syngress.com
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10
263

This involves eliminating relatively obvious causes or problems and making
your way to more complex causes or problems.
3.
Select the most probable cause Select the most probable cause and work
on it. It’s important to work on one cause at a time, and make one change at a
time, else you will not be able to map the effects with the cause.
4.
Plan and implement a solution This can involve repair or replacement of
a component.
5.
Test the implementation After you have implemented a solution, you
should test it and see if it solves the problem. Note and recognize the effects of
the solution. Sometimes a solution can cause other problems.
6.
Document the solution You must document your solution.This step is very
important but is often ignored. Having good documentation will save you a lot
of time and effort if the same problem appears again in the future. It will also
be useful for the next RFID professional who will take your place, in case you
move on.
It’s usually a good practice to replace a ﬁeld replaceable unit (FRU) instead of trying to
repair it.An FRU is a component of a system that a user or technician can quickly and
easily remove from the system and replace without having to send the entire system to a
repair facility.
The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
■
Status monitoring consists of monitoring the status of a system and its devices
(e.g., whether a device is powered on); performance monitoring consists of
measuring the performance metrics of a system or a device.
■
By measuring the system performance metrics, you determine the normal
values of these metrics. Signiﬁcant variation in the values of some of these
metrics can indicate instability of or problems with the system.
■
The standard troubleshooting procedure is identify the problem, identify the
cause, implement the solution, test the solution, and document the solution.

Chapter 10 • Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems

Summary
Monitoring and troubleshooting are essential parts of running an effective RFID system.
Usually nonintrusive information (collected during the normal operation of a system) is
enough to ﬁnd the status of a device, whereas intrusive information (collected as part of
monitoring but not available as part of normal operation) might be needed to help you
look deeply into the problem and ﬁnd its root cause.You can ﬁnd the root cause of a
problem using root-cause analysis (RCA), which is the application of a set of problem-
solving methods based on identifying and eliminating (or correcting) the root causes of
a problem. Problems are identiﬁed during monitoring via either status monitoring or
performance monitoring. Status monitoring consists of monitoring the basic status of
the system and its devices, such as whether the reader is powered on; performance mon-
itoring consists of monitoring the performance of a system and the devices in the
system via measuring performance metrics such as such as readers’ read rates. By mea-
suring the system performance metrics, you determine the normal values of these met-
rics; signiﬁcant variation in the values of some of these metrics could indicate instability
of or problems with the system.The causes of a problem can be found during trou-
bleshooting, which has the following standard steps: identify the problem, identify the
cause, implement the solution, test the solution, and document the solution.
Exam’s Eye View
Comprehend
■
Nonintrusive monitoring might be good enough to check the status of a
reader, whereas intrusive monitoring might be needed to get a deeper insight
into the system, to ﬁnd the root cause of a problem or to predict a future
problem.
■
Mean time between failures (MTBF) is a measure of reliability, robustness, and
stability of a system and can be applied to a system or its components.
■
Average tag trafﬁc volume (ATTV) shows the pattern (changing volume) of
tag trafﬁc through an interrogation zone.
■
A tag failure is deﬁned as the inability of a properly functioning reader to
detect a tag when it’s scanning its interrogation zone. So, a tag is considered
failed when a reader cannot detect it when it is within read range.
www.syngress.com
Monitoring and Troubleshooting RFID Systems • Chapter 10
265

Look Out
■
Root-cause analysis is an iterative process; applying corrective measures to the
root causes of a problem once does not guarantee that the problem will not
reoccur.
■
MTBF indicates the robusteness of the system measured in the past and, based
on that measurement, predicts the rate of failure in the near future.
■
A signiﬁcant variance of actual value of a metric such as tag trafﬁc rate from
the predicted value based on the past measurements could indicate a problem
with the system.
■
A high value for read errors to total read rate (RETR) should be taken as an
alarm for a problem with the RFID system (or portal)—either an internal
problem or one due to adverse environmental effects such as absorption and
interference.
■
Read error change rate (RECR) is the variance of RETR over time and
indicates the instability or unreliability of the RFID system.
■
Items with failed tags that are being tracked will generate data inconsistencies
such as inventory discrepancies.
Memorize
■
MTBF = TL/NF
■
ATTV =  1/N ∑i=Ni=1 ti

APTR =  1/N ∑i=Ni=1  (ta  -  tp)

■
Understand why the incorrect answers are incorrect
Chapter 1
Chapter 1 does not cover any exam objectives.Therefore, there are no review questions in this
chapter.
Chapter 2
1. Answer: C 
C is the correct answer because the wavelength depends on the velocity of the wave and its
frequency, not on its amplitude.
A, B, and D are incorrect answers because they are the correct statements. Remember the
formula ??= v/f, where v is the velocity of the wave in the transmission line and is less than
the velocity of light c, which will be the velocity of the wave through the free space.
2.Answer: D
D is the correct answer because the signal-to-noise ratio is measured in decibels, denoted as
dB.
A and C are incorrect because the signal-to-noise ratio is the ratio of the signal strength to
the noise strength.
D is incorrect because ohm is not the unit used to measure resistance.
Appendix A
281

3.Answer: B
B is the correct answer because refraction causes the change in direction of a wave at an interface
between two dissimilar media, but the wave does not return to the medium from which it hit the
interface.
A is incorrect because reﬂection causes the abrupt change in direction of a wave at an interface
between two dissimilar media so that the wave returns to the medium from which it hit the interfce.
C is incorrect because diffraction refers to the bending of an EM wave when it strikes sharp edges or
when it passes through a narrow gap (slit).
D is incorrect because absorption refers to absorbing the energy of the wave by a medium and not
bending.
4. Answer: D
D is the correct answer because ampliﬁcation is not a modulation technique.
A, B, and C are incorrect answers because amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, and ampli-
tude shift keying are all valid modulation techniques.

C is the correct answer because the VSWR relates to the phenomenon that occurs in the transmission
line.
A, B, and D are incorrect answers because all these characteristics affect the propagation of RF waves
through the free space.

A and B are the correct answers because backscattering is the communication technique usually used
by RFID systems operating at UHF and microwave frequencies, whereas inductive coupling is used by
RFID systems operating at LF or HF.
C is incorrect because scattering is not a communication technique; it’s a characteristic that affects the
propagation of wave.
D is incorrect because link margin is not a communication technique; it’s a physical quantity that
measures the ratio of effective signal strength received to minimum signal strength received.
7.Answer: B
B is the correct answer because an RF signal (or any EM wave, for that matter) travels the fastest
through free space (with velocity of light through a vacuum).
A, C, and D are incorrect answers because EM waves travel more slowly in a medium than they do in
the free space.
8.Answer: D
D is the correct answer because impedance mismatch does not create diffraction.
A, B, and C are incorrect answers because an impedance mismatch between the antenna and the
transmission line will reﬂect the EM wave, which will interfere with the incoming EM wave and gen-
erate a standing wave.

1. Answer: A and B 
A and B are the correct answers because the standard antenna for transmitting low-frequency waves
would need to be impractically large.Therefore, the tags at low frequencies (LF and HF) use inductive
coupling that allows them to use an inductive coil to transfer energy.

B is the correct answer because the KILL command disables a tag from communicating back to the
reader.
A, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are the wrong descriptions of the KILL command.
2. Answer: D
D is the correct answer because an interrogator is not attached to an item; it is used to read the tags
that are attached to items.

A, B, and C are incorrect answers because reader collision is an effect of a dense interrogator environ-
ment, and tag collisions and shadowing are the effects of a dense tag environment.
6. Answer: B
B is the correct answer because the tag read rate of an interrogator cannot be adjusted directly by con-
ﬁguring the reader since it depends on many external factors, such as the tag travel speed.
A is incorrect because you can use tag population management commands such as SELECT to tell
the reader to read only certain kinds of tags.

output power to some extent.
7 Answer:
A  2
B  1
C  4
D  3
8.Answer: C
C is the correct answer because by conﬁguring the interrogator to search only for a certain type of
tag, you improve the read cycle rate and therefore the read rate.
A is incorrect because for the given situation, it’s not the correct solution.
B is an incorrect answer because this will effectively set the read rate to zero; no tag entering the zone
(class 0 tag) will be read.
D is an incorrect answer because searching for all tag classes will slow the read cycle and therefore the
read rate.
9. Answer:A
A is the correct answer because reader collisions occur in a dense reader environment and can result in
signal interference and multiple reads of the same tag.
B is incorrect because shadowing only blocks a tag from being read.
C is an incorrect answer because low power emission by itself may hamper the read efﬁciency but is
not the most likely cause for the given problem.
D is an incorrect answer because this is not the most likely cause of the given problem.
10. Answer: B
B is the correct answer because using the same protocol is not the reason for overlapping interrogation
zones, and using different protocols is not going to solve this problem.

passive tags.
A, C, and D are incorrect answers because the read range increases with an increase in frequency for both
active and passive tags.
17.Answer:A
A is the correct answer because the inner boxes are behind the outer boxes, and this effect is called shad-
owing.
B and C are incorrect because backscattering and inductive coupling are the communication techniques.
D is incorrect because impedance mismatch happens in the transmission line. If this was the cause here, it
would affect the read of all the boxes.
18.Answer: C and D
C and D are the correct answers because the tag’s antenna should be horizontal to the surface of the Earth
to receive the energy of a horizontally polarized wave.Also, the antenna should be parallel to the incoming
ﬁeld but not parallel to the direction of propagation of the incoming wave.
A and B are incorrect because a vertically oriented antenna will not receive a horizontally polarized wave.
19.Answer: B
B is the correct answer because a folded dipole antenna consists of two or more straight electric conductors
that are connected in parallel, and each electric conductor is half the wavelength corresponding to the fre-
quency to be used.
A is incorrect because a dual dipole antenna consists of two dipoles only.
C is incorrect because a dipole antenna simply consists of a straight electric conductor.
D is incorrect because a quarter wavelength dipole antenna consists of a straight conductor that uses the
reﬂective ground plane, which provides an image of the antenna to complete the dipole.
20.Answer: C
C is the correct answer because to the tag’s orientation must be consistent with the polarization of the
reader’s antenna, especially in the case of linear polarization. For example, if a reader’s antenna is horizontally
polarized and tags are vertically oriented, the tags will not receive any power from the reader antenna.

25.Answer:A and B
A and B are the correct answers because LF and HF can penetrate material such as water better than UHF
and microwave frequencies can.
C, D, E, and F are incorrect answers because due to their smaller wavelengths, the UHF and microwave
frequencies are easily absorbed by materials such as water.
26.Answer: C
C is the correct answer because ruggedness is required by a tag to withstand harsh environmental conditions
such as corrosive chemicals, extremely high or low temperature, humidity, and mechanical shocks.

requiring ruggedness.
27.Answer:A
A is the correct answer because impedance mismatch produces stand waves regardless of the frequency
range.
B is incorrect answer because read range depends on operating frequency.
C is incorrect because often applications belonging to the same application type have the same frequency
requirement.
D is incorrect because operating conditions play a role in determining the right operating frequency. For
example, if the system is operating near water and mud, LF is a better solution.
28.Answer: B 
B is the correct answer because the United States is included in regulatory region 2.
A and C are incorrect because the United States is included in regulatory region 2.
D is incorrect because there are only three regulatory regions for RFID.
29.Answer: A 
A is the correct answer because 13.56 is the most commonly used frequency for RFID devices in the HF
band.
B and D are incorrect because 200 KHz and 13.56 KHz are not in the HF range and are not commonly
used frequencies for RFID systems.
Final Exam • Appendix B
309

C is an correct answer because 125–134 KHz is the most commonly used frequency range for RFID
devices in the LF band.
30.Answer: B

RFID services.
C and D are incorrect answers because saving energy and helping the environment are not the motivations
behind regulating the antenna power emission.
31.Answer: D
D is the correct answer because air interface protocols deal with data communication, not with data storage
or formatting.

class, and serial number.
35.Answer: A
A is the correct answer because class 2 tags are passive tags, which use the power from the radiated signal
from the reader as their operating power.
B, C, and D are incorrect because class 3 tags are semipassive, whereas class 4 and class 5 tags are active tags,
and it’s the passive tags that are the most affected by the power regulations.
36.Answer: D
D is the correct answer because the domain name system (DNS) is part of the TCP/IP (Internet) protocols,
not part of the EPCglobal network, even though EPCglobal network can use the Internet.

computer.
41.Answer: D 
D is the correct answer because shadowing refers to one tagged item hiding (shadowing) another tagged
item, thereby preventing the reader from reading it.
A, B, and C are incorrect answers because these are the correct descriptions of shadowing.A tag can hide
(shadow) another tag by reﬂecting the reader’s signal and thereby blocking it from reaching another tag.The
reﬂected signal can interfere with incident signals.
42.Answer: B
B is the correct answer because shadowing is an effect of a dense tag environment.
A, C, and D are incorrect answers because reader collision, signal interference, and multiple reads of the
same tag are effects of a dense interrogator environment.
43.Answer:A
A is the correct answer because the tags, not the readers, have classes.
B, C, and D are incorrect because you can enable event notiﬁcation, list the host computers to enable them
to communicate with the interrogator, and rename, enable, or disable the interrogator.
