Problem 1.1 
Problem 1.1a: For a reaction AoB (rate expression: rA = kCA ) , taking place in an isothermal tubular 
reactor, starting with the mass balance equation and assuming plug flow, derive an expression for calculating 
the reactor volume in terms of the molar flow rate of reactant ‘A’. 
Solution to Problem 1.1a: Assuming plug flow, the mass balance over a differential volume element of 
a tubular reactor is written as: 
                           (MA nA )V      -   (MA nA)V+'V      -     MA rA 'VR       =   0

Problem 1.2 
The gas phase reaction Ao2S is to be carried out in an isothermal tubular reactor, according to the rate 
expression rA = k CA. Pure A is fed to the reactor at a temperature of 500 K and a pressure of 2 bar, at a rate of 
1000 moles s-1. The rate constant k= 10 s-1. Assuming effects due to pressure drop through the reactor to be 
negligible, calculate the volume of reactor required for a fractional conversion of 0.85.

Let us see by how much the total volumetric flow rate changes between the inlet and exit of this reactor. First 
let us review how the total molar flow rate changes with conversion: 
nI
=       nI0                                                      for the inert component 
nA

for the reactant

I. Homogenepus reactions - Isothermal reactors
Problem 1.5 
A first order, liquid phase, irreversible chemical reaction is carried out in an isothermal continuous stirred tank 
reactor A o  products. The reaction takes place according to the rate expression rA = k CA. In this expression, 
rA is defined as the rate of reaction of A (kmol m-3 s-1), k as the reaction rate constant (with units of s-1) and CA
as the concentration of A (kmol m-3). Initially, the reactor may be considered at steady state. At t = 0, a step 
increase takes place in the inlet molar flow rate, from nA0,ss to nA0.  Assuming VR (the reactor volume) and vT
(total volumetric flow rate) to remain constant with time,

II. Homogeneous reactions - Non-isothermal reactors
Problem 2.4 
A continuous stirred tank reactor is used for carrying out the liquid phase reaction: 
A + B o products. 
The reaction rate expression is rA = k(T) CA CB kmol h-1 m-3. The total molar flow rate at the inlet is 3 kmol h-
1. The inlet flow is equimolar in A and B. The total volumetric flow rate (vT) is:  1 m3 h-1. Calculate the 
operating temperature required for a fractional conversion of 0.7.  Also calculate how much heat must be 
added to the reactor to maintain the system at steady state, if the feed is introduced at the reactor operating 
temperature. 
The vessel is designed to withstand the vapour pressure of the reaction mixture. No reaction takes place in the 
vapour phase. Density changes due to (i) the chemical reaction and (ii) changes in temperature may be ignored. 
Data:
Reactor volume,  VR

 Problem 2.5 
The gas phase reaction A o B + C  is carried out in an adiabatic continuous stirred tank reactor. The reaction 
rate expression is given by the equation: rA  = k(T) pA, where k(T) is the reaction rate constant and pA the 
partial pressure of the reactant A. The feed stream is pre-heated to 600 K; it contains an equimolar amount of 
reactant A and inert component D and. The total pressure is 1 bar; it may be assumed constant throughout the 
system. Calculate the steady state reactor operating temperature and the conversion of the reactant.  
(Note: There are two equally valid solutions to this problem. One of the two solutions will suffice as an 
adequate answer.) Ideal gas behaviour may be assumed. You may also assume total heat capacities of the feed 
and product streams to be equal. 
Data:

A tubular reactor packed with spherical pellets will be used for carrying out the catalytic reaction: 
2A oB + C  .

where CA denotes the concentration of A. The intended conversion is 75 %.  
(a) The reactor is to be operated isothermally at 600 K and 1 bar pressure.  Estimate whether intraparticle 
diffusion resistances affect the overall reaction rate. For the purposes of this part of the calculation
CA,s #  CA,b
may be assumed. 
(b) Estimate whether bulk to catalyst surface mass transport resistances affect the overall reaction rate. 
Due to dilution by the inert gas, bulk properties of the gas mixture may be considered as approximately 
constant. The pressure drop over the length of the reactor and deviations from the ideal gas law may be 
neglected.

Catalytic reactions – Non-isothermal reactors 
Problem 4.1 
The exothermic catalytic gas phase cracking reaction

where pA denotes the partial pressure (bar) of “A” and T denotes the local temperature in K. The catalyst 
pellets (dia. 0.004 m) may be considered isothermal and the value of the effectiveness factor is estimated as 
0.08 throughout the reactor. We select a point within the reactor where, G, the superficial mass velocity of the 
gas stream is 0.8 kg m-2 s-1, the bulk temperature, Tb, is 500 K, and the partial pressure of “A” in the bulk, pA,b,
is 0.05 bar. Calculate: 
(i)  
the global rate of reaction,  
(ii)  
the external concentration gradient (expressed in terms of the partial pressures), and, 
(iii)  the temperature gradient between the bulk gas stream and external catalyst pellet surfaces, 
at the selected point in the reactor. Bulk gas properties may be taken as those of the diluent. The pressure drop 
along the reactor axis may be neglected.

Problem 4.2 
The exothermic gas phase reaction   
                                                         A + B o C 
is carried out over a porous catalyst, in a non-isothermal/non-adiabatic fixed bed catalytic reactor. The feed 
stream is equimolar in A and B. 
(a) Using a one-dimensional, pseudo-homogeneous model framework, derive steady-state mass and energy 
balance equations and state boundary conditions to describe the behaviour of the reactor. Define your terms 
carefully. 
(b) Calculate the maximum temperature that the exit gas stream would attain if the reactor were to be operated 
adiabatically. Judging by this result, what change would you recommend in reactor operating conditions. 
(c) Discuss briefly for the present case, advantages and disadvantages of using a one-dimensional reactor 
model over a two-dimensional model.

Unacceptably high! Improve cooling and/or reduce reactant concentrations and/or dilute the catalyst. 
Part C: 
The main difficulty arises from ignoring the radial temperature distribution. In dealing with highly exothermic 
reactions, when the maximum temperature along the central axis turns out to be much larger than the radially 
averaged temperature, runaway may occur under conditions where the 1-dimensional model would predict 
“safe” operation. The disadvantage of 2-dimensional operation is the requirement for accurate additional data 
for radial heat (and mass) transport:

Problem 4.3 
The exothermic reaction 
A + B o C 
was carried out using two different catalyst particle sizes: 8 mm diameter catalyst pellets and 50 μ (average) 
diameter catalyst particles. Both sets of experiments were carried out under conditions where external 
temperature and concentration gradients were negligible. Global rates of reaction, measured as a function of 
temperature, using approximately similar external surface concentrations of A and B for all experiments, are 
given in the table below. Assuming the 50 μ particles to be isothermal under all operating conditions, 
(a) Calculate from this data, the energy of activation most likely to approximate the true value for the 
chemical reaction step at the catalytic sites. 
(b) For the 8 mm catalyst pellets, calculate the effectiveness factor at each temperature. State your 
assumptions clearly. 
c. Briefly explain observed changes in the values of effectiveness factors as a function of the experimental 
temperature. What do values above unity imply?

Part (a): 
“Series 2” Arrhenius plot for 50 Pm particles (Figure A) shows the line bending above 495 K. The slope of the 
straight component of the line gives the correct ('Ea/R) value for chemical control, i.e. for K=1. Using 
values of the rate between 425 and 495 K, we can calculate the slope of the straight part of the line.

Part (b): 
The first three rates in rows 1-3 of column-2 in Table A and Table B are the same. The data corresponds to  
the part of the Series 2 curve in Figure A before it begins to bend. Since the line is straight up to and including 
495 K, we can safely conclude we have chemical control and K = 1. 
Above that temperature, the line bends. If there had been no diffusive limitations the line would have 
continued as a straight line. That is why the extrapolated line still corresponds to K = 1. We can read off (in an 
enlarged diagram) that the extrapolated rate for 549.5 K is 2.26u10-6 and for 637 K, the rate corresponding to 
K = 1 is 1.07u10-5.
We then use Eq. 6.76 (Chapter 6) from the main text.

Part (c): 
For exothermic reactions K=1 means that the temperature at the centre of the pellet is greater than the surface 
temperature Ts. That in turn implies that the rate at the centre of the pellet is greater than the rate at the 
surface. In this example, the effect was more visible at relatively low surface temperatures. This 
explains the change in the nature of the value of effectiveness factor with increasing temperature. 
Problem 4.4 
Differential reactors are used to simulate an infinitesimally thin (“slice”) section of, say, a tubular reactor. In the 
laboratory, this is done to measure reaction rates and other parameters of catalytic reactions, in the context of 
a small amount of conversion. 
The intrinsic rate for the endothermic catalytic gas phase cracking reaction “A o products”, is given by the 
first order reaction rate expression

where pA is the partial pressure (bar) of A, and T denotes the local temperature in K.  The reaction is carried 
out  in a differential reactor, where  reactant  “A” is supplied, mixed 1:1 with an inert diluent. The superficial 
mass velocity of the gas stream flowing over the catalyst particles, G, is 1 kg m-2 s-1, and the temperature of 
the bulk stream is 750 K. The overall conversion in the reactor has been determined experimentally as 3.6 %. 
The catalyst pellets have a diameter of 0.004 m and may be considered isothermal. Calculate the global rate of 
reaction, the magnitude of the effectiveness factor, and the external concentration and external temperature 
gradients.
The bulk gas properties can be taken as those of the diluent, B. The pressure drop through the reactor may be 
neglected.
