PREFACE
The first edition of this book was published in 1976, less than a decade after Neil Armstrong became the
first man to walk on the moon in 1969. The programs that lead to the first moon landing gave birth to
many advances in science and technology. A number of these advances, especially those in microelectronics
and digital signal processing (DSP), became enabling technologies for advances in communications. For
example, prior to 1969, essentially all commercial communication systems, including radio, telephones, and
television, were analog. Enabling technologies gave rise to the internet and the World Wide Web, digital radio
and television, satellite communications, Global Positioning Systems, cellular communications for voice and
data, and a host of other applications that impact our daily lives. A number of books have been written that
provide an in-depth study of these applications. In this book we have chosen not to cover application areas in
detail but, rather, to focus on basic theory and fundamental techniques. A firm understanding of basic theory
prepares the student to pursue study of higher-level theoretical concepts and applications.
True to this philosophy, we continue to resist the temptation to include a variety of new applications
and technologies in this edition and believe that application examples and specific technologies, which often
have short lifetimes, are best treated in subsequent courses after students have mastered the basic theory and
analysis techniques. Reactions to previous editions have shown that emphasizing fundamentals, as opposed
to specific technologies, serve the user well while keeping the length of the book reasonable. This strategy
appears to have worked well for advanced undergraduates, for new graduate students who may have forgotten
some of the fundamentals, and for the working engineer who may use the book as a reference or who may
be taking a course after-hours. New developments that appear to be fundamental, such as multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems and capacity-approaching codes, are covered in appropriate detail.
The two most obvious changes to the seventh edition of this book are the addition of drill problems to
the Problems section at the end of each chapter and the division of chapter three into two chapters. The drill
problems provide the student problem-solving practice with relatively simple problems. While the solutions
to these problems are straightforward, the complete set of drill problems covers the important concepts of
each chapter. Chapter 3, as it appeared in previous editions, is now divided into two chapters mainly due to
length. Chapter 3 now focuses on linear analog modulation and simple discrete-time modulation techniques
that are direct applications of the sampling theorem. Chapter 4 now focuses on nonlinear modulation
techniques. A number of new or revised end-of-chapter problems are included in all chapters.
In addition to these obvious changes, a number of other changes have been made in edition seven. An
example on signal space was deleted from Chapter 2 since it is really not necessary at this point in the book.
(Chapter 11 deals more fully with the concepts of signal space.) Chapter 3, as described in the previous
paragraph, now deals with linear analog modulation techniques. A section on measuring the modulation index
of AM signals and measuring transmitter linearity has been added. The section on analog television has been
deleted from Chapter 3 since it is no longer relevant. Finally, the section on adaptive delta modulation has
been deleted. Chapter 4 now deals with non-linear analog modulation techniques. Except for the problems,
no significant additions or deletions have been made to Chapter 5. The same is true of Chapters 6 and 7,
which treat probability and random processes, respectively. A section on signal-to-noise ratio measurement
has been added to Chapter 8, which treats noise effects in modulation systems. More detail on basic channel

models for fading channels has been added in Chapter 9 along with simulation results for bit error rate (BER)
performance of a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) equalizer with optimum weights and an additional
example of the MMSE equalizer with adaptive weights. Several changes have been made to Chapter 10.
Satellite communications was reluctantly deleted because it would have required adding several additional
pages to do it justice. A section was added on MIMO systems using the Alamouti approach, which concludes
with a BER curve comparing performances of 2-transmit 1-receive Alamouti signaling in a Rayleigh fading
channel with a 2-transmit 2-receive diversity system. A short discussion was also added to Chapter 10
illustrating the features of 4G cellular communications as compared with 2G and 3G systems. With the
exception of the Problems, no changes have been made to Chapter 11. A ‘‘Quick Overview’’ section has
been added to Chapter 12 discussing capacity-approaching codes, run-length codes, and digital television.
A feature of the later editions of Principles of Communications was the inclusion of several computer
examples within each chapter. (MATLAB was chosen for these examples because of its widespread use
in both academic and industrial settings, as well as for MATLAB’s rich graphics library.) These computer
examples, which range from programs for computing performance curves to simulation programs for certain
types of communication systems and algorithms, allow the student to observe the behavior of more complex
systems without the need for extensive computations. These examples also expose the student to modern
computational tools for analysis and simulation in the context of communication systems. Even though we
have limited the amount of this material in order to ensure that the character of the book is not changed,
the number of computer examples has been increased for the seventh edition. In addition to the in-chapter
computer examples, a number of ‘‘computer exercises’’ are included at the end of each chapter. The number
of these has also been increased in the seventh edition. These exercises follow the end-of-chapter problems
and are designed to make use of the computer in order to illustrate basic principles and to provide the student
with additional insight. A number of new problems have been included at the end of each chapter in addition
to a number of problems that were revised from the previous edition.
The publisher maintains a web site from which the source code for all in-chapter computer examples
can be downloaded. Also included on the web site are Appendix G (answers to the drill problems) and the
bibliography. The URL is
www.wiley.com/college/ziemer
We recommend that, although MATLAB code is included in the text, students download MATLAB code
of interest from the publisher website. The code in the text is subject to printing and other types of errors and
is included to give the student insight into the computational techniques used for the illustrative examples.
In addition, the MATLAB code on the publisher website is periodically updated as need justifies. This web
site also contains complete solutions for the end-of-chapter problems and computer exercises. (The solutions
manual is password protected and is intended only for course instructors.)
We wish to thank the many persons who have contributed to the development of this textbook and
who have suggested improvements for this and previous editions of this book. We also express our thanks
to the many colleagues who have offered suggestions to us by correspondence or verbally as well as the
industries and agencies that have supported our research. We especially thank our colleagues and students
at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, the Missouri University of Science and Technology, and
Virginia Tech for their comments and suggestions. It is to our students that we dedicate this book. We have
worked with many people over the past forty years and many of them have helped shape our teaching and
research philosophy. We thank them all.
Finally, our families deserve much more than a simple thanks for the patience and support that they have
given us throughout forty years of seemingly endless writing projects.
