The playing time for the game is estimated a between 30
to 411hours so be prepared to io slowly. p
Dragos' castle lies to the north but before yeti go there
you have a lot to do. You must collect the magic mushrooms

Thc game is entirtly animated by tiny characters that
play out the sto4y. ythen you enter a town or encounter a
monster the screen expands and uses windows to pile as
much atmopshtre into'the game as possible.
I found the game to be overly complex and reliant on
unusual concepts such as the constant need to collect
mushrooms and the Weird and wonderful spell names such
as Buzzap, Ekbert,,Jazzip and Z)rtrorn. I prefered the more
classical style 0ft role gilayibg found in the Shard of Spring,.

Wargames
Wargames simulations are the bread and butter programs of
SSI's catalogue but contain an incredible variation o f
conﬂict and combatants. The following games highlight this
variety of not only game type and style but also complexity
from games that take 15 to 20 minutes to play to those
requiring 10 hours of constant concentration.
Broadsides
Swashbuckling action on the high seas is the name of the
game as great galleons meet in conﬂict between rival
captains and their crew.
The main screen shows both ships as they approach each
other with crew, orders, ship damage and speed displays on
the left.
The two captains enter their commands through joystick
control which orders the ship to  turn to  the port o r
starboard, aim at the hull or sails, increase or decrease speed
and ﬁre. In the advanced game you can also select sails, to
ﬁre grape shot or cannon and even design your galleon from
scratch,
Later once the cannons have taken their toll on the ships
and their rigging they will close and the boarding parties will
battle with sabres as the snipers menace with muskets.
Panzer Grenadier
The problem with infantry is that they're essential when
actually taking the territory of a battleground but they can't
I.Q.
YOUR COMMODORE june 1987
13
keep up with the trailblazing battle tanks. The Panzer
Grenadiers changed all that as they were soldiers riding
halftracks, trucks and armoured cars and rapidly became
Hitler's elite force. In Panzer Grenadier you control this
force in a series of scena rios on the eastern front in which you
must take and hold crucial bridges and break up Russian
counterattacks.
The game looks like the product o f  the authors'
Wargarne Copts traction Set (also in the ﬁrst batch of imports)
which is the wargame equivalent of the Quill. Thirty one
units on either side can be fully set up to ﬁght as wizards,
tanks or starships on a deﬁnable scrolling map. In this game
the units are the troops, mortars, machine guns, motorcycles
and tanks of the grenadiers and their opponents.
I found the unit counters to be a little too small for
comfort and as a result I would recommend you get the
construction set and build your own scenarios.

Mech Brigade
There are only a few computer wargames that actually need
a computer other than to  provide an opponent. Meeh
Brigade i s one o f  them. Although you control units
representing the tanks, artillery, helicopters and armoured
vehicle of modern warfare the computer stores and uses the
ratings of front and back armour, size, speed, number of
guns, gun range, gun penetration, gun accuracy, shell size
and missiles carried for each and every vehicle.
The game simulates war between East and West in the
1990's and pits Nato Apache AH-64 helicopters, Bradley
and Abrahams tanks against Hind helicopters T-72 tanks
and ZSU23 self propelled guns. Don't be surprised if these
units sound familiar as the Apache helicopter is better
known as the Gunship and the other units are the ones you
meet in the Western europe scenario.
Mech Brigade is undoubtedly a complicated game and
deserves its advanced label and three hour playing time but,
despite this, it is still remarkably playable. Single letter
commands are used to issue orders to your units in the games
four scenarios or in a scenario you have built yourself. One
of the most useful commands, surprisingly not found in
other wargames, is the view command that highlights the
area in a speciﬁed units line o f sight. This is crucial to
deciding combat tactics and is incredibly annoying in other
games when your attacks are disallowed for a surprising "no
line of sight" decision. Now there are no doubts.
The combination o f  tanks, guns, infantry, guided
missiles and of course helicopters make this a fascinating
and challenging game.

Roadwar 2000
Roadwar 2000 presents the challenge of a battle of survival in
a disease and nuclear devastated America. Suicide squads
from an unknown enemy infected the nation with a deadly
virus that then mutated when the Russians launched nuclear
strikes.
Now the country is run by feudal gangs led by fanatics
like you.
Your job as gang leader is to build up your rabble from
bumble pedestrian beginnings to  the toughest mobile
I.Q.
ﬁghting force in the west.
You'll have to  loot cities and farmland fo r food,
medicines and supplies, search for useable vehicles such as
sports cars, trucks and motorbikes, and recruit new gang
members to swell your ranks while battling with other gangs,
mobs and the dreaded infected mutants. Gradually, your
gang will improve in number and quality, ride better
vehicles, armed with metal found in foundaries and one day
may be strong enough to take cities such as New York.
More to Come
That's just the tip of the iceberg as SSI games arc set to
swamp the strategy scene with American Football, Baseball.
golf and boxing sports simulations, The Cosmic Battle and
Imperium Galactum fo r science ﬁction freaks. Gemstone
Healer, Wizard's Crown and thePhantasie trilogy for fantasy
fans and wargames covering all ﬁelds of battle from the past
to the present and into the future.
It's difﬁcult to pick out any favourites from this group of
excellent and varied games but two stand out head and
shoulders above the rest for pure and simple playability.
They are Colonial Conquests and Shard of Spring.

Your Commodore on the fact that the

high standard but gone from strength
to strength. In this country, it's in a
class of its own.

is that one of the articles in my copy of

The article was Diskits 1,2 and 3 and 1

to obtain a legible copy.
IF! may also make a suggestion for
future content o f  the magazine,
perhaps there is  scope f or  the
occasional hardware article e.g build
your own cartridge?
Thank you again and may you (and
contributors), keep up the good work.
Mike Ventham, Radlett.
We apologise for the bad quality of the
printing in the Diskit article. This was
due t o  a  complicated s e t o f
circumstances which wouldn't normal&
arise. Anyone who is very keen to use
this article, should write to us at the
editorial address (you ﬁn d  it inside
the back of the magazine) and we will
send a clean set of photocopies ﬁve. of

With regard to hardware articles, we
would be quite happy to publish this type
oﬂeature, but it is very difﬁcult_lo ﬁnd
someone who has the right type o f
knowledge and reliability. Until we ﬁnd
the right person, we're reluctant to
experiment.

P
review will say w h o  needs such
things?". I for one found it very useful.
We ca n 't a l l  b e  a s  bright o r
computerised as you lot, even you had
to start somewhere. The package I am
talking about is The Professor, a self-
tutorial fo r the C64. I t  covers an
Mtroduction to  Basic programming
and sections on sound and graphics to
show you what your CM is capable of.

The thing 1 particularly liked about
The Professor is that you don't have to
plough through reams and reams of
paper to  follow i t as most o f  the -
instructions a n d  explanations a re
included on the disk. There is a very
small booklet of about 10 pages which
basically tells you how to load the
programs and how to experiment with
the sound and graphics sections.
Starting Up
On the ﬁrst side of the disk you can
choose from the keyboard or Basic.
Being a little stupid as far as computers
are concerned I decided to start right at
the beginning with the keyboard. The
program explains the labelling of the
keys and what each can be used for.

work at your own pace, you don't have
to rush and read something before it
disappears.
As you work through the keyboard
section you have to press different keys
to continue which is good because it
gets y o u  us ed t o  handling t h e
keyboard. This may seem very basic
to some but it' you haven't handled a
computer before it can get you over the

'scared o f  touching i t in case I  do
something wrong' syndrome.
The second section on the ﬁrst side
of the disk is called Basic. It goes into
many things including using drives and
cassettes a n d  u s i n g  d i ffe re n t
commands such as FOR and NEXT
loops and PEEK and POKE. I was a
little disappointed with this section as I
felt that once 1 had completed it and
fully understood it 1 would be a bit
nearer to being able to write my own
program (even i f only a very small
useless one). However, though the
program went through all the sections
carefully i t  didn't allow yo u  t o
experiment and try the commands out
for yourself.
think y o u  c a n  _learn a n d
understand things a lot easier through
trial and error once you have the basic
information needed. There was an
example given i n  this  section f o r
formatting a  disk. I t  was explained
what this  meant and w hy  i t  was
necessary but the commands it used
weren't explained. [felt it would have
been useful to understand what 1,8 and
OPEN and CLOSE meant since i t
would make more sense when you
typed it in. Otherwise it becomes the
jumble of a foreign language.
In one sense the disk is very basic,
aiming at real beginners but then puts
confusing or complicated statements
which y o u  w e r e  ex pec ted t o
understand. For instance in explaining
how to validate disks you are told that
this s houldn't b e  done o n  disks
containing relative ﬁles but it doesn't
say what these are.
Sound and Graphics
The second side of the disk covers the
aspects o f  sound a n d  graphics

available on the C64. The ﬁrst section
was a  b i t  l i ke  a  music lesson.
Explaining th e  different kinds o f
waveforms used by the computer.
Following this was a test to see if
you had understood the sounds (you
need to have quite a good musical ear
to get 1009e). You have an opportunity
to load a sound generator example and
I liked the fact that you play around
with this and make your own sounds.
You need the manual for this which
explains how to change the oscillators
and waveforms etc . f o r  different
effects. The instructions were quite
difﬁcult to start with and if you're not
careful you ﬁnd your eardrums being
blasted with a noise that you can't
stop.
Conclusion
All in all 1 found this package quite
useful but felt the ﬁrst side could have
been extended a little further to give a
wider k n o w l e d g e  o f  B a s i c
programming. The second side was
very good but didn't indicate hovv
these sounds and graphics could be
used outside this disk. The disk as a
whole seemed t o  be aiming at two
different l e v e l s  o f  c o m p u t in g
knowledge. I think it might be useful to
people who have so far only used their
computers for playing games and havc
decided to see what else they can do
with it.

 tie of the many gripes that people
have about Commodore equipment is
the fact that, without complicated
interfacing, only other Commodore
product s work with it. In the USA a
number of manufacturers have made
the most out of this by producing a
Commodore compatible products.
new disk drives being one of the most
popular. N o w  Eve sh a m h a s
introduced an alternative Commodore
compatible drive on to the UK market.
Good Looks
It is extremely difﬁcult to comment on
a disk drive since it simply works or it
doesn't. Accelerator + works and it
works extremely well offering a
number o f  advantages o ve r i t s
Commodore counterparts.
The size of the drive is roughly half
that of the drives from Commodore..
This has been achieved by placing the
power supply outside the disk drive
casing. just like yo u r computer's
powerpack. This is great for people
who require a two drive system since
two drives no longer take up your
work desk. they can sit neatly on top of
each other taking up less room than a
single Commodore drive.
Snail Pace?
R E V I E W
Accelerator +
Commodore disk drives are so slow
when compared t o  many other
computers and drives on sale that a
number o f  manufacturers have
produced add-ons t o  speed u p
operation of the drives, Dolphin Dos
again from Evesham being extremely
popular, a speed increase of 25% is
claimed for the Accelerator -E. This
may not seem like a great amount at
ﬁrst but, when you are loading large
tiles, a 25% increase in speed is worth
having. To be fair to the Commodore
Want a drive for your Commodore computer? Can't
afford a 1541? perhaps the Accelerator + is for you.
By Stuart Cooke
drives, I did ﬁnd the increase in speed
to be of notice only on large ﬁles, on
smaller ones you simply don't notice
the difference.
Compatibility
One o f  the major problems with
Commodore disk drives is one o f
compatibility. Many programs are
using forms of protection that will only
work on the 1541 drive and will not
work on either the 1570 or 1571 drives
that a r e  available. Best known
offender is Elite from Firebird. It is
impossible to LOAD this on anything
apart f r o m  a  1541. W i t h  t h e
Accelerator +  Elite was the only
program th a t I  could ﬁn d  th a t
wouldn't LOAD. This isn't bad when
it d o e sn 't e ve n  w o r k  o n  a l l
Commodore's drives.
Commands Available
All of the commands that you can use
on the Commodore range of drives are
present. The detailed manual explains
them all for those o f you that have
never used a disk drive before. Because
all th e  standard commands are
available' I found that all the disk-
orientated utility programs that I have.
such as a  disk monitor, all work
without any problems at all.
What Device
If you have ever used more than one
Commodore d ri ve  together y o u
probably know how difﬁcult it is to
change the device number on one. Two
options are available to you, you can
either choose the software option of
altering the number o f  the drive
through a number of commands every
time that you turn your drive on, or
you can unscrew your ease and cut a
track on the circuit board making the
YOUR COMMODORE june 1987
21
alteration p e r m a n e n t. W i t h
Accelerator + things are much easier.
Turning the drive over reveals two
small switches. To change the device
number of the drive simply move the
switches to the relevant position and
you've done it.
In Use
Using the drive presents no problems.
The drive appears to be much quieter
than the 1541 drive in operation which
will please people who are fed up with
the sound o f their 1541 disk head
moving around.
I could only ﬁnd one real fault with
the drive, and to be honest the fault
was caused by my error. If you have
ever used a Commodore drive then
you will no doubt know that On many
models the disk is pushed out of the
drive when you open the drive door.
With the Accelerator + this is not the
case. If, like me. you have the drive
below the level o f the computer this
makes it difﬁcult to see if a disk is in the
drive. On a couple of occasions I found
that I couldn't use a disk only to ﬁnd
the reason this was caused was because
there was already one in the drive.
Verdict
The Accelerator +  i s an exceltent
product. The fact that it takes up a lot
less space than a Commodore drive
and th a t i t  i s  almost completely
compatible with the 1541 would win
me over t o  i t  even without the
advantage of the speed increase.
To quote Evesham: "Why buy a
lumbering hippo (1541) when you can
buy an Accelerator + for forty pounds
less!" Why indeed?

two places higher than you, you hope to climb the ladder to
glory.

ahead (including your opponent if he's ahead of you) and
also your bank of instruments, including a wind direction
marker and a radar that plots your progress around the
course.
Winning a race not only depends on the design of your
boat but also when you use your giant spinaker sail and the
direction you sail in. Since the course is triangular you will
have to sail both into the wind and with it. so you have to be
careful when to use the sail (speeds you up when the wind is
behind you) and to keep on course.

to compete alongside million dollar yachts for only

somewhat more sophisticated than the original but the game
remains the same.
Converted from the arcade game of the same na.e the
object is to bounce a ball into a brick wall, thus knocking
bricks out of it When the last brick vanishes, you progress
on to the next level. Of course, it's not quite that easy. Some
of the bricks have to be hit several times before they ﬁnally
yield. This is especially difﬁcult on the higher levels with live
hits per brick being required. Some bricks are totallv
indestructable and are just there to futher hinder you. As too
are the monsters that materialise. These have no function in
the game save that they deﬂect the ball from its original path.
So much for the had news. Not everything g a i n s t  yy

towards you. Catch one of these on your bat and you gal

If it sounds like an old plot you'd be right because it's a

Your mission is to battle your way through 250 rooms to

ensure you have sufﬁcient oxygen supplies and keep y o u r

bardment of sharp swan'. These you can blast with your

You can move from screen to screen either through the
hatches at either side of the screen or by sliding up and down
tubes that seem to lead everywhere but where you want to
go.
A map at the bottom of  the screen leads you to the
control room but also into megaswarf areas so you need to
know where extra oxygen cylinders, ﬁrst aid kits and patches
are stored.
To add to your problems you will also have to look out
for pools of acid, conveyor belts, that carry you to your
doom, and heavy traps poised to plummet as soon as you
reach for the ﬁrst aid box.

pulses isn't the easiest way to earn a living but that's the way
of a Sun Star pilot.
The Sun Star pilots were ﬁrst commissioned when the
Sun grids, built to create energy crystals also developed
unstable disruptor pulses making collecting in a normal craft
suicidal.
Specially developed ships were designed for exceptional
pilots to ﬂy through the grids at breakneck speeds. Skill and
incredible reactions are required to chase the white pulses
that when blasted switch to the energy rich green crystals
that tear off at high speed. If you're quick you can track them
down without smashing into the grid wall or colliding with
one of the yellow obstruction pulses or energy draining red
pulses.
Long and short range scanners plot your position which
is shown on the 3D display that ﬁlls half screen. Although, it
is unlikely you'll have time to study these.
This is deﬁnitely a game to play in the dark with the
volume dial turned to maximum. Then let them have it!
Once you've ﬁlled up your energy banks with crystals,
it's off to the hyperwarp cell and the next grid. This isn't easy
and will take some time. If you miss out on one crystal, all
the others you've collected burn out.

up to eight players can manage up to 10 teams on the road to
Wembley.
You can select your 10 teams from any of the 92 league
teams and dozens of past and present giant killers such as
Telfort United and Blyth Spartans. Ten may sound a lot but
SOFTWARE R E V IE WS
you'll need them all to stand any chance of having an interest
in the later rounds.
You can begin the game in either the ﬁrst round or
straight into the third round when the ﬁrst and second
division teams join the competition however some of your
lower division teams may have been knocked out already.
In each round the computer makes the all important
draw and then you must decide the tactics for each of your
teams and determine whether they will play a balanced team,
go for goals in an all out attacking style or sit back and
defend all game.
In later rounds you get to change the tactics at half time
and an option to bring on a substitute. You also have to
make managerial decisions. These involve choosing which
studs to wear in damp weather and whether to play your top
player even though he's injured or has asked for a transfer.
This updated version is supposed to contain the latest
form for each of the teams. Since the data is spread over the
last 10 years the information and performance of the teams
hasn't changed that much from the original to be worth
producing another full priced game.
If you have the original game it just isn't worth buying
this one as it's almost identical. I f  you haven't got the
original and you like football that you'll like this even
though it is grossly overpriced by today's standards. T.H .

a miserable post holocaust existence. Th e  robots
programmed to defend the city, while man is in his forced

forever!
Oblivious to your fate you continue to listen to the false
reports coming from topside and carry on playing the
popular computer game, "Rat
robots around a deserted city that looks surprisingly like
Choi°. Too similar. As you begin to play the game, you have
just realised that you're in contact with one of the robots on

the surface and you've got your work cut out if you're going
to stop the impending doom.
Armed with only a pre-war map of Cholo (supplied with
the game) you must move your robot (a general purpose rat
called Rizzo) around the city, ﬁnd out what's going on and
stop it! Rizzo is a useful robot but he's going to need help if
you're going to stand any chance so you must set out to ﬁnd
some new recruits by paralysing them with Rizzo's laser and
interfacing with them. To do this you must track them down,
blast them into submission and discover the correct ID code.
Luckily a list of these is stored in a nearby computer. If only
you could ﬁnd it.
The game unfolds as a series of complex puzzles that
must be solved using Rizzo's talent to "recruit" others and
discovering the strengths and weaknesses o f the other
robots.
Your ﬁrst recruit is likely to be Igor the Hacker who is
unarmed yet vital as he can get more programs out of the
computers, such as a radar program that plots the movement
of all robots in your immediate surroundings. Next you'll
ﬁnd a ﬂying eye called Anneke that can scout from the safety
of the skies, and Leadcoat, an all out battle drold.
Your attempts to free mankind are constantly hampered
by the attacks of the guard and grundon robots that are too
thick to be any use and usually shoot on sight. They usually
hunt in packs making the guards difﬁcult to ﬁght and the
grundons impossible.
Cholo's a fascinating game that's a mixture of arcade
battles with the guards, puzzles to discover the best uses of
your robots and exploration of the vector graphic city. At
times the action is painfully slow but also incredibly
addictive as you delve deeper and deeper into the game's
sinister atmosphere.

F
comes a series of double value budget games! Two of their
SOFTWARE R E V IE WS
YOUR COMMODORE june 1987

previous top titles on one tape and all for only £1.99.
The ﬁrst tape has a deﬁnite platform bias about it.
Rocket Roger sees our eponymous hero trying to ﬁnd fuel
for his stranded space ship. Ninety nine crystals are hidden
somewhere on the dark mystery planet.
Rocket Roger, as his name implies, is equipped with a,
jetpack and must use it in order to manoeuvre himself round'
the surface — a deft touch is required here as the slightest
mistake spells doom. The jetpack only has a limited amount
of fuel and must be topped up at periodic intervals. As the
action shifts to a more traditional platform game scenario
with sliding doors, laser beams and invisible force ﬁelds. Not
forgetting of course, the many aliens intent on hindering
Roger wherever possible.
Blagger, a.k.a. Roger the Dodger is a thief. His speciality
is safe cracking and here are 30 that will test his skill to the
very limit. Each safe requires a number of keys to open it and
these are scattered round the screen, protected by marauding
nasties, collapsing platforms, one way staircases and the
like.
One minor drawback is that you must always start at the
beginning and work your way through in each screen in
order —  a  random element would have helped here,
especially since once you know the secret of a particular
screen, completing it on future occasions becomes trivial.
Even so, there is still the temptation to have just one more go
and see what the next screen is like.

rapidly became one o f  Jeff Minter's favourite games.
Unfortunately, it was never converted for the C64. Now its
sequel is set to push you to your limits.
In the original game, Star Raiders commanders blasted
the Zylon empire into submission but now the few that were
allowed to live have rebuilt their forces and are out for
revenge. As Star Raiders 11 begins, the Zylons have invaded
the Celos IV system.
Your mission is to pilot the Liberty Star ﬁghter and not
only protect the four planets of Celos IV but also attack the
Zylon planets to destroy the attack bases that can produce
Zylon ships faster than you can shoot them!
The Liberty ﬁghter is equipped with three computer
controlled weapons systems to fry Zylons and shields and
warning lights to give you a chance of staying alive. Twin
ﬁring pulse laser cannons can be ﬁred to take out Zylon
ﬁghters that seem to swoop just beyond your sights, ion
cannons throw torpedoes at the city smashing Zylon
destroyers and surface star bursts can be used to bomb the
lethal attack bases.
SOFTWARE R E V IE WS
YOUR COMMODORE june 1987

All this action is bound to be a strain on both you and
your ship and so you should take a breather at a space
station to refuel and repair before warping back into the
action.
The system display shows the four planets under seige
and plots the position of any incoming Zylon ﬂeets. It's up to
you to decide when to defend a speciﬁc planet, or a space
station, dogﬁght with the ﬂeets or attack the Zylon bases.
The secret of success and glory is to time each of these moves
so that you get one step ahead of the Zylon hordes and not
constantly chasing them.
Your performance in the game is reﬂected in the rating
you're given that can range from ensign to admiral and the
mission report that displays the number of Zylons you've
crashed.
The Zylons have you desperately outnumbered and so
you must act and think quickly and learn the tactics to take
out the different types of alien ships. The ﬁghters appear in
groups of three so it's worth a few speculative shots as soon
as you see one to take out the followers. The city smashing
destroyers are harder to hit and take more hits to kill them,
so practice will soon pay off. The same is true for bombing
the cities as the bombs must be dropped in front of the target
to land on top of the city. The only problem with this is
you're constantly attacked by ﬁghters that you can't shoot
(because you're bombing) and the Zylons may have
destroyed your repair stations while you weren't looking.

In Killer Watt, you are exploring a huge underground
cavern lit by a dozen light bulbs. These must all be shot
before you can blast your way through a ﬁnal force ﬁeld. As
well as negotiating the tortuous twists of the cave, you must

SOFTWARE R E V IE WS
also avoid ﬂying dolphins, birds and bombs if you are to
succeed. If this should prove to be too easy a task, you can be
sure that subsequent levels won't be, as the number o f
creatures increases considerably.
What makes this a difﬁcult task is that your ship is very
highly manoeuvrable. The slightest touch on the joystick
and it accelerates away like mad, usually, straight into the
nearest wall. Braking is also difﬁcult due to the inertial
system built in. What is really heartbreaking though is that
when you lose a life, you must watch as the cave scrolls
slowly back to the starting point. A brilliantly cruel ploy on
the part of Tony Crowther, the programmer. All this to the
accompaniment of some synthesised Bach too.
Hypercircuit takes you deep into the bowels of your
computer as you enter the world of the microchip. Your aim
is to patrol the chip, taking out the assorted nasties before
they do likewise to you. Your movement is restricted to
travelling down wires and your ﬁring is similarly limited but
beware, some o f  the baddies have total freedom o f
movement so make sure that you don't get caught in a dead
end.

Wargames don't usually ,tet the publicity
that they deserve, perhaps because they
are considered a minority interest. Here's

Three different scenarios are set in the turbulent time
between 1880 and 1914 when a gunboat was the accepte
form of diplomacy.
The standard scenario conﬁnes the player powers to the
own borders as the game begins with neutral continents suc
as Africa. India. Australasia and South America ripe for the
picking_ These neutral countries, although packed with their
own armies, form the stepping stones for empires as the
taxation income they bring in adds to your own resources to

provide the funds to raise armies and navies.
The game fs played in a series of turns with four turns
played in a year. In each turn the players move their armies
fr,iin any of the 131 board areas t t ) an adjacent area and their
Ild%1 " t h e r  on naval sorties to maintain nay al supremacy

s o p p o s i n g  armies' strengths. try t o  subvert
neutr t r i e s  with the offer of bribes, pay off unwanted
aggressors and ally. deceive, backstab and tight the other
human players. The only thing ou'r e not allowed to do is
watch w hile another player enters his 1110k es. But you can use
this time to plot against him. Obviously this only works with
three or more human players but you will ﬁnd the computer
opponents formidable even at the lowest of their 10 skill
ratings,
The aim of the game can be deﬁned as either the ﬁrst to
attain 500. 1000 or 1500 points or  to win control of the
world. Points are won by winning battles, taking territoriees
and whole regions (or continents) and lost by losing any of
these. 'The points value gained varies country to country but
also reﬂects the strength o f  the resident army and the
difﬁculties you'll face in defending it. Some neutral armies
can be as small as 10,000 soldiers or as high as 400,00•0!
To add t o your planning problems each power has
different strengths and weaknesses. English soldiers are the
hest trained but are the most expensive to raise whereas the
R E V I E W
T H E  I n  C I  
T
 H
Russians are cheaper but are little more than a rabble. You
can also dig your troops in by fortifying them, making them
twice as hard to shift and you can COMM in reinforcements
from your home country to any where on the board.
In the early years t h e r e
such as the African and Indian states to convert which tends
to keep the powers apart as they all grow in strength. But
sooner or later they collideats war breaks out. Once war is
declared the computer w ill attack y ou whenever and
wherever it can, so unless they strike ﬁrst, try and restrict
your enemies as it's difﬁcult to take on the whole world at
once.
In the other scenarios the world map is a little more
complicated with the powers already occupying most of the
ariLa
neutrals mak ing war  almost i n o  U n d e r s t
ble
when one of the scenarios begins in 1914!
Whichever scenario or country o t i choose to play y ou'll
ﬁnd an easy to play yet challenging strategy game that will
drive you back again and again until you quench your thirst
for power!

Programming

isn't it a bit silly that you can only have
one program in the memory at a time?
Well look no further than this
simple program. I t  w o r k s  b y
separating your computer's memory
into tw o  halves, each working
individually with i ts  own set o f
variables etc. Some functions such as
the screen remain the same for your
convenience and speed o f  change,
whilst graphic modes and sounds are
dependent upon which area you are in.
The cursor, for instance, moves to the
place where it would have been had the
program area not been changed.
If a program is left running, when
you return to it, the operating system
will re-start at the next command in
that program.
All o f this may a t ﬁrst seem
confusing but with a little time this
could become a treasured programing
tool allowing you to switch from one
program to another or simply just have
two basic programs in the memory at
once.

Chop your Plus/4's memory in half and get twice the
value
By Jonathan Morley
Theory
The way in which the program works is
simple: when a short machine code
routine i s  called i t  switches th e
constants, parameters and pointers at
the beginning o f  the memory fo r
another set relating to  the second
program area, and stores the ﬁrst.
Using It
You are now ready to program and
experiment; load your old programs
into either area, write new ones or add
new parts to your main program. You
are limited, as ever, only by your own
imagination s o  H A P P Y  P R O-
GRAMMING! and remember that at
any time to switch areas all you need to
do is type SYS1525 in your program
e.g.
10 print "leaving now"; :SYS1525:
print "back again"
run < RETURN >

Wan error signal appears ignore it,
this is  jus t a  result o f  the initial
changes).
You are now in the other area press
F4 (shift to F1) to clear the screen and
then Fl which types SYS 1525 for you
and you will be back into the other
mode where the program will ﬁnish
running.
N.B. Adept CM programmers will
ﬁnd that the principle of swapping the
zero-page. and a few other parameters,
will also work for them as long as they
are careful to change addresses 44 and
56 to the correct values.

CLASSIC BRIDGE
R EVIEWS
F
same sort of computer analysis as chess. This idea is well
borne out when it comes to computer games. Whereas chess
programs can now beat all but the top club players very
easily, bridge programs can handle the display well enough
— inputting the bids and cards to be played — but the actual
nitty gritty of the game, the bidding and card play, is of a
very poor standard.
The basic idea in bridge is for you and your partner to
determine how many tricks you can make between you. This
is done during the bidding where you try to assess where
your strengths and weaknesses lie. I f  you outbid the
opponents. then you must try and make the number of tricks
that you declared for. If they outbid you. then you and your
partner must try to defeat their contract.
In Classic Bridge. the computer handles the other three
hands allowing you to play without having to ﬁnd three like
minded fellows ﬁrst. Unfortunately, the game is of a very
poor standard. There are a number of reasons for this. First,
the game is very slow when it comes to actually dealing a
hand. This would be bearable if you actually get a different
hand each time but it is not quite as simple as that. Every
time that you want to play a hand, you must input a number.
This acts as a seed for the randomiser within the program.
Whilst this means that there are a vast number of hands
available to you. it also means that you must keep track of
which numbers you have already used — otherwise you get
the same hands again. This proves to be very clumsy.
As mentioned earlier, poor bidding and card play is
common to all bridge games currently available and Classic
Bridge is no better or worse than any other program. Where
there is a problem though is that the bidding system used is
Goren. Although this is the system used by most Americans,
it is totally alien to British players who normally play a
system called Acol. In nearly 20 years of playing tournament
Bridge, I have only ever met two pairs who play Goren!
Again, this problem isn't insurmountable, but it does show a
considerable lack of insight on the part of someone.
The main fault with the game, though, is in the cardpiay.
The program does not always remove the cards played by
you. In one case. I was left with six cards in my hand when
everybody else only had two left. The computer would not

Presentationwise. the program is ﬁne although the input
routine could be improved. Every card played must be
entered individually, singletons and cards played to the last
trick could be handled automatically. A  joystick option
would also be a great help. Also, there is no claim option.
This would allow declarer t o claim some or  all o f  the
remaining tricks when it  is perfectly obvious what the
outcome of the hand is going to be.
In the actual playing of the cards, the program is better
than most of its competitors but very predictable and at best
no better than average. As in real life, its declarer play is
better than its defence.
But it is in the bidding that the program falls down. Even
without claiming to play any particular system (natural,
weak no-trump and no conventions i.e. not even Stayman or
Blackwood) tile bidding is a farce. A typical example was
this hand. Holding S KI072, H 1085, D  AQ.I3, C Q. the
computer correctly opened one heart. The response was two
clubs and it now found the monstrous bid of three spades!
Apart from totally misdescribing the strength and shape of
the hand and using up vast amounts of bidding space. the bid
is ﬁne.
Before Thinking Games get too upset about this, I
hould point out that this is something common to all bridge
programs released to date (and I suspect for many years to
come). The bidding is far and away the most important part
of the game and the fact that the program can't cope makes a
mockery of everything else.
The novel feature about Oxford Bridge is the duplicate

you have enough people available to use the facility, you
might as well sit down and play the real thing.

The bad news doesn't end there either I'm afraid. The
price of this package is absolutely ridiculous. At just under
CIO for the tape and .05 pounds for the disk version. I reckon
that it is overpriced by at least £20. For the money it costs.
you could buy several bridge books, bridge evening classes
for a year or, perhaps best of all. membership of a couple of
your local clubs. Then you need never be short of a fourth
player again. Bridge. unlike chess, is a social game, Let's
nope it always remains that way.

There wasn't really any choice in the matter. \i ou had been
framed for a murder and the verdict was execution or the
small matter of saving the Lands of Ket from the vicious
attacks led by King V ran, leader of the Mad Monks and his
assistant, the High Priestess Delphia. Naturally, you opted
for the chance to be a hero. Even though the odds on you
surviving were small, they had to be greater than the ﬁrst
choice. Just in case you decided to do a quick moonlight ﬂit,
they ﬁtted an assassin bug into your neck ready to deliver a
fatal nibble should you attempt anything naughty.
The game consists of three different adventures. In The
Mountains of Ket, you have to ﬁnd the secret entrance to the
mountains and then negotiate the perils that lie within. In the
Temple of Vran, you must destroy the evil forces lurking
within the temple and, in the Final Mission, you must seek a
ﬁnal confrontation with Vran himself as well as making sure
that you can escape at the end o f  it. Although all three
adventures are linked, you can play each one separately
which is good news if you happen to get stuck early on.
As the games are fairly old, the parser is quite crude —
verb/noun input only. There is also a rudimentary combat
system y o u r  strength against that of your opponent with a
luck factor thrown in for  when you try  to escape. Tile
unusual bit  though is  that instead o f  using pictures to
illustrate some of the locations, the top half of the screen
provides a map of the areas that you have visited. This is a
nice touch and should appeal t o  beginners and those
adventurers forever getting lost alike.
Although the games are a bit dated now, they are still fun
to play and .0.95 for the three adventures is good
value.

Conclusion
Cadpak is  a  really powerful tool.
accurate, smooth running and very
versatile. It combines a large number
of f e a t u r e s  r e q u i r e d  b y  t h e
professional with some ﬂexible artistry
which anyone can enjoy. The manual
has all the information necessary plus
two tutorials (for lightpen and cursor
use). A very useful third tutorial takes
you through planning and executing a
scale drawing for a house of speciﬁc
dimensions. Having done so. you may
then decide what can lit in where!
You could pay a lot more for a
package of this quality.

hen any machine code program is
mien the chances are that it will not
n the ﬁrst time it is tried. When this is
he case debugging can often take
ally hours.
Emulator is a 4K program which
allows a machine code program to be
run one instruction at a time. As each
step is made, a  display o f  all the
registers i s  updated, inc luding a
display o f  the stack contents. T he
accumulator. x and y registers are also
shown in bit form to aid fault ﬁnding.
Emulator  h a s  a d d i t i o n a l
commands that allow skipping over
code, changing o f  register values
(including the status register and stack
pointer), 'Jumping into subroutines and
running the program at a  different
speed with a trace displayed until a
stop address is encountered, at which
point the user can take over and step
through any remaining code.
The program resides in memory
from 57000 t o  V E T E .  A s  mos t
machine code programs reside a t
$C000 and cartridges occupy $8000 to
S9FTF, it was k it that this was the
most convenient position for it.
It should b e  noted t h a t  t h e
following Zero Page locations are used
by the program:
SC! •.ind SC2 - Program counter
SFB and SEC -  Temporary storage
SFD and SEE -  Temporary storage
C64 P R O G R A M ' ,
One problem with machine code programs is that once
the initiating SYS call is entered, the OUICOMe is in the
lap of the gods. Emulator allows you to step through
each individual instruction before you run the program.
Getting It In
In Use
By 5-1. Branton
The emulator is presented in a form
that us es  o u r  H e x  D a t a  En t r y
program. Please note that the Hex
Data Entry program presented here is
a new version for this program and the
old one MUST NOT be used.
For detailed ins truc tions  o n
entering the program read the article
accompanying the Hex Data program.
Once you have a completed version of
the program SAVEd on to your disk or
tape then LO AD it into the computer
with:
LOAD -
use
or
LOAD "EMULAT O R", 1,1 i f  using
cassette.
To start the emulator running, you
must enter the following command:
SYS 286723XXXX
Where SXXXX is the start address of
the machine code that you wish to test.
e.g.
SYS 2867237000
YOUR COMMODORE june 1987

would test the EMULATOR program
itself.
Commands Available
El -  STEP
The current address and subsequent
disassembly arc displayed in the top
line under their headings. To step the
program press El. the registers will be
updated and the new address w ill
occupy the topline. The two previous
lines w i l l  b e  scrolled d o w n  f o r
reference.
F3 -  SKIP
To ignore the
current address and
move to the next one. Just press the F3
key.
F.5 - ALTER REGISTER
Press 1
the registers. A * will appear above the
register header at which point a new
value may be entered. Press RETURN
to move to the next register and exit to
Emulator.
E7 -  4;0 JSR
This key allows the emulator toenter a
subroutine at the current address and
await its  return, only i f  the current
instruction is  a JSR. Care must be
taken when using this command since
the Emulator  relinquishes c ontr ol
during the subroutine. however it does
have the advantage of stepping a lot of
code 
t
h
i
s
  command w h e n
jumping into subroutines of the C64's

ROM and it will save you from wading
through N cram s full of code.
F8 - GO UNTIL
This is  probably the most powerful
command in the Emulator. Pressing
Hi and then entering a start and stop
address causes the code to be run from
the start address but stop as soon as the
end address is reached. The user may
then use the Fl key etc. to step through
remaining code.

It is possible to use GO UNI1Lat
three different speeds. Slow is best
used i f  the program is being traced.
Each time an instruction is carried out
the border c olour changes. I f  the
border doesn't change then y o u r
progra in has crashed and vou will have
to reset your computer.
The l a s t  p r o m p t  ‘ k i t h  t h i s

corner of the screen.
During GO UNTIL the P key try

Releasing the K  key will allow th
program to continue, RUN/STOP wi
return the program to the main screen,
as w i l l  a n y  in v a lid  ins tr uc tion

Program Description
.
the beginning and end of the range of
program lines to be printed, the size of
the continuous stationery being used
(in terms of the number of lines per
page) and the maximum number of
printed lines which may  appear on
each page. Default values for each of
the above options are displayed on the
screen, and may be used (by simply
pressing R ET U R N )  o r  altered b y
overtyping as required.
How It Works
All prompt messages are disabled by
means of the POKE instructions in line
63979, thereby ensuring t h a t  t h e
READY message is not printed at the
end of the program listing.
The program operates by scanning
the Basic link addresses and associated
line numbers until the line corre-

Make your liStings look smarter and cleaner with this
clever little program.
By Gregory Murphy
sponding to the start of the required
has been found. The program then
counts for war d n  lines  (where n
represents the maximum number o f
lines that may be printed on each page)
and determines the number of the line
appearing at that point.
A nice feature is that the program
does not calculate the number of lines
to be printed from the values of the line
numbers involved, but actually counts
the lines themselves. This means that
programs written (either by choice or
through la c k  o f  a  R EN U M BER
facility) with irregularly incremented
line numbers can be listed without
difﬁculty.
The pr ogr am t h e n  clears t h e
screen, displays a LIST command to
the printer for enough lines to ﬁll one
printed page and then stops At least it
would stop if instructions had not been
previously poked into the keyboard
buffer (line 63994)1 These instructions
home the cursor and enter RETURN.
thereby executing t h e  prev ious ly
displayed L I S T  c ommand t o  t h e
printer.
At this stage the program should
also stop, but there are still further
instructions in the keyboard buffer.
These instructions ensure that the
program will GOTO line 63996 and
continue the scanning. counting and
printing process u n t il a l l  o f  t h e
required r ange o f  lines  has  been
printed.
When pr inting is  complete. the
YOUR COMMODORE june 1987

program re-enables all prompts, clears
the printer buffer and then terminates.
Important Note
It should be noted that lines 63983.
63986 and 63989 contain a  capital
letter " 0 "  ( n o t  a  z er o)  i n  t h e
ex pres s ions  " 0 6  39 9 6"  a n d
"063998" -  i.e. G O TO  63996 and
GOTO 63998 respectively.
In Use
First enter the program as shown and
then save it either todisk or tape before
attempting to run it. This is always a
good precaution t o  take w ith an>
program. but is especially necessary in
the case ola program containing either
SYS or POKE instructions.
Load t h e  program f or  which al
listing is to be printed and then append
this program to it. Obviously the last
line number in the program to be listed
must n o t  exceed 63959, but in  an
extreme situation the REM statements
in lines  63960 t o  63969 c ould be
omitted and the default value of  L2
altered to 63969 in line 63973.
The simplest way to append this
program is as follows:
Enter the command POKE 43.(45)-2:
POKE 44. PEEK (46) in direct mode.
Imad this program.
Enter the command PO KE 43, I  :
POKE 44, 8 in direct mode.

page numbering, centering, ﬁl e
linking, disk handling, justiﬁcation
and so forth. Apart from such general-
ised techniques however, o th e r
facilities exist which enhance word
processing.
Before discussing these, it should
be noted that this review is for the disk
system handling th e  MPS801/803
printers only. Systems f o r  other
printers are also available and the
package comes with a  generalised
Manual plus amendment data forthe
printer which you are using. The
amendment pages for the MPS series
must be examined with due care.
Files
The ﬁrst thing you will no doubt wish
to do is create a ﬁle. The Main Menu
provides th e  necessary options,
including one for adjusting the speed
of the cursor control. Select the
requisite option and follow the manual
plus t h e  amendment section.
Reference t o  pages 12-15 i n  the
General Manual will help you here.
While the commands are relatively
simple a n d  a re  mostly achieved
through the function keys some facts
are rather elusive.
Pay particular attention to the Fl
key when initialising a document. This
is yo u r escape k e y  f o r  quitting
commands. Any formatting errors are
highlighted at the bottom of the screen
as numbers 1-6 which can be tracked
down in the Manual which is indexed
to cover th e  major features o f

processing.
Effectively it is possible to increase
the size of text print within a document
(by a two, four or eight scale) and also
to underline text. The latter facility is
not east to locate (in its simplest form).
However, i t  may be done i n  the
following manner — press F5, write
text, press F6. in the Manual, these are
deﬁned a s  "condense o n '  a n d
'condense o ff which are bypassed on
the MPS801/803. It is certainly not
possible t o  obtain 'condensed' o r
'double density' text with this program
(unless you redesign the character set
with the Graphics Editor) but these
keys will underline for you although
the Manual does not describe this
facility. A more complicated method is
provided.
Other Commands
The RUN-STOP key allows you to
back-step very efﬁciently. Should you
run igto problems, save as you go
along which will allow you to do a
further search for the solution in the
manual(s). Editing is simple, using 1
for insertion and D for delete.
Use of the Commodore key allows
you t o  toggle between te xt and
graphics mode i n  your document.
This, of course, eliminates use of the
graphics using this key. The shift key is
fully functional. A s  you use th e
program more and more you will no
doubt ﬁnd the methods best suited to
your own needs.

goes, are those which are easily read
and thus properly constructed. This
philosophy certainly makes writing
them a lot quicker and the end product
is easier to understand_
However, i t  is  very difﬁcult t o
achieve this in Basic because even the
best end result is only a program full of
REM annotated subroutines. I n  the
end, you are left with code consisting
of a mass of GOSUBs which are very
difﬁcult to follow.
The Solution
Procedures oiler  a  very neat way
around this problem by allowing you
to w r ite y our  program i n  readily
understood segments. Each procedure
is in effect a mini-program all of  its
own. The implications of this are that
several mini-programs c an b e  p u t
together and then called b y  name
from the main program.
For example a small program to
ask f o r  a  name, and then pr int a
message could look like this:
10 DEFPROC ASK NAME(AS)
20 I N PU T  " W H A T  I S  YO UR
NAME"; AS
30 END
40:
50 DF F PRO C P R I N T  MESS-
AGE(AS)
60 PRINT "HELLO"r% A$
70 END
80:
90 PROC ASK NAME(NAMES)
IN) PR O C  PR I N T  MESSAG E
(NAM ES)
In this example the actual program
starts at line 90 and ends at line IOU
because any lines between DEFPROC
and END are ignored when you type
RUN. Notice how the procedures are
called by their names. The name of any
v ar iable a s s o c ia t e d  w i t h  t h e

Procedures
Programming in Basic can be very long winded and
clumsy. Using procedures can make your program much
cleaner and smoother.
By Nick Gregory
called something different at the start
of the procedure. This type of syntax
allows you to read the program (lines
90 and 100 demonstrate how easy this
is) and to use the same procedure with
different associated variables (though
variables are optional).
The routine PR O C L O AD  is  a
Basic loader for the machine code,
necessary to implement procedures on
the 64. As  always. type the program
and SAVE it before running in case
there are errors.
The m a c h in e  c o d e  s ec tion,
PROCCODE, of the program should
be entered using the program H E X
DATE ENT RY II. D o  not use the
earlier version o f  this program. For
details on how to enter this code refer
to the article Hex Data Entry II. When
you have ﬁnished entering all the data
you should SAVE it with the name
'PROC.CODE. I f  using tape this
should be placed after 'PROCLOAD'.
To us e the program i n  future
simply LO AD and RUN the program
'PROC.LOAD', this  w ill automat-
ically LO AD and execute the machine
code.
The machine code w ill now  be
incorporated into the Basic interpreter
and you can continue to use the 64 as
normal.
The routine works by wedging into
the Basic command interpreter and
not into the GETCHARACTER sub-
routine as  is  normal. However, t o
avoid c h a n g in g  t h e  L I S T  a n d
CRUNCH Basic routines each new
command begins with the character
'@'. There are three new commands:
@DEFPROC
@DEFPROC — name o f  procedure
(optional parameters)
This command is used to deﬁne the
start o f  a procedure. The procedure
name can be any length u p to 127
characters long and SPACES AR E

recognised a s  being t w o  different
procedures.
This is unusual but I felt it allows]
the names to make more sense. Note •
that a space between the last character
and the parameter bracket, ')'. is also
signiﬁcant. The procedure name can
contain a n y  Basic k ey  wor d, e.g.
PRINT, in which case the appropriate
abbreviation can be used. The optional
parameter list can contain any number
of parameters. separated by commas.
svithin a limit which I will explain later!
The variables c a n  b e  strings.,
integers or ﬂoating point numbers but
they cannot be arrays, expressions or
numbers. The only other restriction is
that y o u  c a n  n o t  us e SYSTEM
variables (ST. T I •  o r  T IS)  i n  the
parameter list.
For example see Table I:
The D E F P R O C  a n d  @  END

statements towards any instructions
after them on the same line that is to
say they arc ignored.
@ END
This command marks the end of a
procedure. Y o u  mus t  always use
@ END after  us ing @ DEFPROC.
@ PROC procedure name (optional
paremeters)
This command is  used to call a
procedure (like CIOSUB is used to call
a subroutine). T her e mus t b e  a
procedure deﬁned by  @ DEFPROC
with the same name. I f  you are using
parameters then they must be of the
same type. in the same order and the
same number as in the @ DEFPROC
command. @PROC is just an ordinary
Basic command, you can for example
include it as part of a multi-statement
line. If, however, you are using it after
an I F  command then put a  colon
between the THEN and @PROC. For

PRINT ERROR(ER)
This oddity is caused by the way
the Basic interpreter processes the I E
TH EN commands.
Error Messages
All the Basic error messages are redir-
ected v ia this  routine s o that the
procedure stack is reset: unless it is a
STOP. END or RUN/STOP in which
case the program can be continued as
normal.
Apart f r om t h e  standard error
messages thr ee Bas ic  errors hav e
different meanings and there are three
new messages.
Syntax Error
This will be caused if  the parameters
are n o t  t he same o r  you've spelt
something wrong. It is usually quite
obvious what the problem is.
Type Mismatch
This oc c ur s  i f  t h e  v ar iable i n
@ DEEPROC isn't of the same type as
in @ PROC.
Out Of Memory
This will occur if  you have no more
room t o  s t o r e  t h e  p a r a m e t e r
information. Each procedure uses four
bytes o f  a buffer plus ﬁve bytes for
every parameter. T he buffer is 256
bytes long so you can have a maximum
of 28 procedures active in a program if
there is  jus t o n e  parameter each.
Procedures us e t h e ir  o w n  buffer
throughout so you can still have the
normal amount of FOR N E X T  and
GOSUB R E T U R N  loops in your
program. Procedure with more than
one parameter will use that much more
space though you shouldn't have any
problems.
NO @ END FOUND
This means that @ DEFPROC has not
got an associated @ END. This can be
tricky to debug because the @ END is
looked f o r  b u t  does n't p a i r  i t
speciﬁcally w ith any @ DEFPROC.
This error will occur if there isn't the
same n u m b e r  o f  @ EN D S t o
@DEEPROC. Remember, always close
C64 P R O G R A M ' ! "
procedures with (cil END.
UNDEF. PROCEDURE
No @ DEFPROC name can be paired
with a procedure call. Check spelling
and parameter list.
ILLEGAL VARIABLE
This error occurs if you try to use array
variables ( a(n) ) as a parameter.
@END WI THOUT PROC
This error occurs if the program meets
an @ END when i t  is n't inside a
procedure. This is similar to RETURN
WITHOUT GOSUB ERROR.
It is important that you note that
the @ DEEPROC command, when
called f r o m  @ PROC, i s  checked
before BASIC is told what line the
@ DEEPROC is on. If there is an error
caused while checking @ DEFPROC
the error will be reported as having
occured in the line with @PROC.
In Use
You can use procedures to do almost
anything w it h in  a  program. F o r
example a small procedure to incor-
porate a delay into a program can be
written as:
100 @ DEFPROC WAIT(N)
110 T I S =
120 IF INT(TI/60) < N  THEN 120
130 @ END
This procedure can now be called by
@PROC WAIT(SECO NDS) where
SECONDS is given by any value you
please.. A similar procedure can be
written to wait for a key press. For
example:
200 @ DEEPROC PRESS SPAC E
BAR
210 PRINT "PRESS SPACE BAR TO
CONTINUE"
220 GET AS:IF AS <  > CHRS(32)
THEN 220
230 @ END
These two routines could be called in
succession as:
500 SECONDS=5
510 @ PROC WAIT(SECONDS)
520 Ca' PROC PRESS SPACE BAR
530 REM rest of program
You should now have a reasonable

idea of  how procedures can be used
within y our  program t o  mak e the
whole code that much more readable
and easier to debug. The last thing I
want to cover is a brief description of
what's going on within the 64 and how
this imposes one severe restriction on
this im p le m e n t a t io n  o f  Bas ic
procedures.
When the CO PROC command is
encountered a check is made to see
there are any parameters associated
with the procedure. I f  there are none
there's no problem and the program
branches i n t o  t h e  appr opr iate
@ DE EPROC.
If. however, there are parameters,
they are checked off in turn and their
name is kept on the special procedure
stack. When t he parameter lis t i,
checked a t  t h e  @ D EEPR O C
command the new variable name is put
into the 'variable name* bytes within
the B a s i c  V A R I A B L E  s pac e
(immediately after the Basic programi
This is how a different variable name is
assigned to the same value and N‘ hy
SYSTEM variables, expressions and
arrays cannot be used (because they
are not stored in this space).
When t h e  @ EN D  statement is
reached the original variable name ts
replaced. The advantage of this is that
procedures can be used as multi-line
functions, fy.

players like your US counterparts? A
recent magazine su rve y h e re
investigated several thousand readers
to arrive at a proﬁle o f those who
played games. Some of the results were
surprising, some not.
Polling Day
Over three quarters o f  them were
males, which one would expect, but
more than half of these men were over
20 years old. A majority of these had
owned their computer for at least two
years.
Family Computing is a "generic"
computing magazine w i t h  a *
pronounced bias toward Apples, but
Commodore accounted for 30% of the
computers used, Apples 28% and the
IBM PC (and compatibles) 24%.
S20 to 830 games were purchased
most often. Although a game price of
$35 to $50 dollars didn't deter 28
the buyers. More than *50 for a game?
All but 2% said "Forget it!". 3% said
that they never bought games. How
reassuring that there are so few pirates.
Game playing seems to be an 81%
alternative to viewing the television.
David Hallerman, the collater of this
information, was encouraged to ﬁnd
that only 8%, of those who replied to
the questionaire, had given up time
formerly spent in study.
What type of games appeal most?
Arcade and Arcade/Strategy were the
top t w o.  T h e y  out r ank ed t h e
Politic al/Military /Strategy  ( the
lowest of nine categories) by two to

release Chessmaster 2000 by Electronic
Arts/Software Toolworks. Although
the 64 version of Chessmaster is just
another good chess program, the
Amiga version comes very close to real
chess pieces (in your choice of wood or

ever had from a  live teacher. M y

My "ofﬁce Amiga" is now one
month old. When I can escape from
Chessmaster 2000 a n d  Ma rb l e
Madness, I am totally ensnared in the
two programs which l e d  m e  t o
purchase the Amiga. I  ﬁnd myself
using both Aegis Images and Deluxe
Paint l l  to work on the same graphic
since they share IFF ﬁles. Deluxe Paint
ll is much the more powerful program,
but Aegis' pattern making tricks are
irrestible.
Add a Digi-View Video Digitizer
from NewTek, used with a Panasonic
CCTV camera model WV 1410, for
visual input to the Amiga in !FT ﬁles,
and you would get as excited as I am
about the Amiga. Alas, both Aegis
Images and Deluxe Paint II with their
LET ﬁles can only work with 32 colors
produced by the Digi-View although
Digi-View shows you their H.A.M.
"hold-and-modify" mode to display
4096 colors at the same time on the
screen. A  new Digi-Paint software
program will soon be available from
NewTek to manipulate the 4096 mode
in H A M .  I t  will cost f.:59.95 L
requires an update software version
2.0.
The Amiga i s  getting a  1 .2
Kickstart and Workbench update, but
deliveries through local dealers has
been delayed.
Scribbles! i s  th e  best o f  th e
presently available word processors
for the Amiga. It was developed by
Micro-Systems Software and is sold by
Brown-Wagh Publishing. Version 2.0
is now  out. Amiga WordPerfect is
promised for this spring. This program
for the IBM-PC is presently the hot
word software with the Blue bunch.
Let's hope it sells cheaper than $495 in

its Amiga version for it sound like just
what all US column writers need.
Your Superbase Personal has been
written from the 64 to the Amiga and
brought over here. It's said that you
can ﬁle W E  graphics and C A D
drawings t o  b e  used within text
layouts. T h e  same Progressive
Peripherals and Software who handle
Logistix, a  p ro j e ct a n d  t i m e
management type spreadsheet, sell the
Superbase. Batteries included ﬁnally
got their 128 Paperclip wordprocessor
to the market place, RUN magazine
said ﬂatly, "...best professional word
processor available." It has a built-in
telecommunications syste m i n
addition t o  a  spelicheck a n d
dictionary. Cost is $79.95. There is no
sign o f  Paperclip Elite which will
integrate text and graphics fo r the
Amiga.
However, it is Amiga software that
is inundating the market. What a great
answer to the old put down still being
used by their competitors that there is
more software for Atari's ST. More
news on Commodore's good health is
revealed for its market value, when this
A M E R I C A N  N E W S
was written, of 13.5 a share - up from
last year's low of four.
Online communication seems to
lend itself to gossip and rumors. Last
months' chit-chat included talk of a
production end for the C128 so more
64Cs could be made and of a reduced
cost Amiga under $500. Let's hope the
Cl28 will hang in there. At least a third
of t h e  members o f  m y  l o ca l
Commodore Club converted to  the
128 within three months of its arrival
on the market, and they are very
satisﬁed with it. Still, i f the Amiga
could get down to $500. with a disk
dirve? Oh, heck, they'd change again!

If you have never come across a
disassembler before the operation o f
one is  quite simple. Y o u  t ell the
disassembler w hic h ar ea o f  t h e
computer's memory y o u  w is h t o
examine. The computer then prints to
your screen or printer a list of all the
machine code instructions that are to
be found i n  the area o f  memory
speciﬁed.
This is all well and good, but what
ﬁt were to come across an instruction
such as JSR SCOW? With most dis-
assemblers, it would take some time to
ﬁnd the actual location of SSCOL
64 Source Generator improves on
this by actually putting labels within
the programs to where any instruction
lumps. This makes it much easier when
trying to follow instructions of  any
program.
The ﬁle that Source Generator
creates in memory can be manipulated
in the same way as Basic program:

program that uses a standard Basic ﬁle
structure. T h e  extremely p o p u la r
MIKRO assembler being an example.
Getting It All In
The program is presented in two parts.
The ﬁr s t  pr ogr am. SO U R C E
GEN, is simply a small Basic program
that is  used to actually L O AD  and
RUN the Source Gen program. This
program should be typed in and Saved
on to cassette or disk for use later.
The second pr ogr am. S- G EN
M/C. is presented in a form suitable
for use with our updated Hex Data
Entrt I I  p r o g r a m .  R e a d  t h e
instructions ac c ompany ing t h i s
program for detailed information on
how to-use this program.
Once you have entered all of the S-
GEN M / C  program, save it  out to
your tape or disk. If you are using tape
then the program should be SA VEd
after the SOURCE GEN program.
Note: For your own programming
safety make sure that you only use the
new version of Hex Data Entry. Do not
use the earlier version.
Using The Program
To use the program simply LOAD and
RUN the SOURCE G EN  program.
this w ill automatically L O A D  and
RUN the program S-GEN W C .
Once the program has started you
will be presented with a choice of three
numbers. These are options for the

memory. The possible numbers are:
- 828 ( C a s s e t t e  buffer)
2 - 704 ( S p r i t e  Use)
3 - 49152 ( F r e e  RAM)
Select whichever one of these you
require. T he numbers 828,704 and
49152 are the SYS numbers that you
sill need t o  activate the SOURCE
program. The selection of the area to
be used should be guided by where the
program you are 'investigating' starts
in memory, to avoid a clash with the
generator.
Tape users should note that. as
memory location 828 is the tape buffer,
performing a  S A V E  o r  L O A D
operation will corrupt the SOURCE.

the SOURCE G EN  program t o  be
presented. M o s t  o f  t h e  options
available are self explanatory and a
brief description o f  these s hould
sufﬁce.
Fl) DISASSEMBLE
In order to disassemble, the program
to b e  disassembled s hould hav e
already been loaded into memory. If

necessary, t h e  Mov e Basic option
should b e  used before us ing this
function.
You will be asked for a START

program c ode w i l l  overwrite t h e
original and following line numbers.
Hitting RETURN with no line number
entered w ill result in  the computer
working out the next line number +10
and adding it to the existing ﬁle.

Extra long machine code programs
may need disassembling in more than
one part due to the limited memory
available as the labels and source code
are generated.

hatever the type of game you are
aiming to write on your computer, you
will n o  doubt need some type o f
background. This background can
be made to stand out even more i f
sections of it are moving.
For example in a platform game
you may have ladders that move up
and down o r  conveyor belts that
move left or right. In this installment. I
will be giving a routine that makes this
type of animation extremely simple.
At this stage of the proceedings I
was about t o  spout forth into a
discussion on user deﬁned graphics
and how you can design your own
characters when the editor brought me
to halt screaming that this was covered
in l a st mo n th 's magazine (see
Eve rymans Guide to Graphics). I will
therefore miss this out completely and
jump straight into the programs and
some examples.
What to do
Let's suppose that you are writing a
program that requires the use of some
rotating shapes in the background. If
you take a look at Figure I you will see
a simple design for a few characters
that would make u p  the different
animations of a moving ladder. If in
Basic you were to print one character
on top of the other then you would be
getting the feeling that the object, in
this case a ladder was moving.

Action
Get those characters moving with this latest routine in
our programing series.
By Tony Crowther
If you take a look at Figure 2 you
will ﬁnd a Basic program for the CM,
that will place the characters from
Figure 1 into memory and proceed to
print them over the top of' each other.
OK so it is simple and isn't a really
useful example but should give you an
idea o f how character animation is
achieved. In this case we just happened
to deﬁne a ladder.
Arcade Routines
The problem with using Basic fo r
altering a displayed character is that it
is an extremely slow process and no
matter what else you do within the
program you would need to  keep
jumping to  the section o f  i t that
changes the character.

interrupts, wouldn't it be easier to set
up the character changing o n  an
interrupt and leave the computer to
handle i t. thus leaving you free to
control the rest of the program'?
This is just what the program in
Figure 3 will do. This is a Basic loader
for a  program that will animate a
character o n  t h e  screen o n  a
Commodore 64 computer. If you want
to see exactly how to program works
then you can take a  look a t the
assembly language for it in Figure 4.
The Character Animate program
uses the Interrupt Database program
that was published in last issue so you
must make sure that this has been
loaded into memory before attempting
to run any of the program presented
here.
Once you have RUN the Character
Animate program it is extremely easy

Animation Pos. Number o f frames.
Speed
Where:
Char No is the number of the character
to be animated. Up to eight different
characters can be animated on the
screen and are numbered from 0-7. It
may help i f you think o f the eight
different characters as a type of sprite.
Data Pos is the character that is
going to be altered in the range 0 to
127.0 is the same as the character code
128 so 1 will be a character A etc.
Animation Pos: This is the position in
the character table that the animation
sequence starts. All of the characters
that are used for an animation should
be placed one after the other and
stored in character positions 0-119.
No. o f Frames is quite simple the
number of changes that is to occur to
the character.
Speed is quite simply the rate at which
the changes are to take place. This can
range from 1 to 255 with 1 being fast
and 255 being slow.
Before the animations will start you
will of course have to tell the Interrupt
database that this routine is in usc.
This is quite simple achieved by the
following cornmand:
POKE 836,1
Don't forget that you also have to start
the IRQ data base with a SYS 49152
instruction.
In Use
Figure 5 gives an example of how this
program can be used. I t  i s fully
Jocumented so you should have no
problems ﬁguring out how it works.
[he program quite simply POKEs a
E number of characters to the screen and
proceeds t o  animate them a l l  as
rotating stars a t  different speeds.
Again nothing clever but i t  does
demonstrate the power of this routine
ind should give you some ideas.
The next installment in this series
of useful programming routines will be
to provide you with a routine that is
another animation routine. but this
rime to animate the C64s sprites. T.:!

A
lost without a decent range of tools. A
programmer too will ﬁnd life a lot
easier i f  he holds a  collection o f
programming tools designed to make
programming easier.
Systems Software has produced a
package, entitled aVard Basic, that
provides a Basic programmer with an
excellent selection o f  programming
utilities.
The package contains four major
programs. These are, a compiler to
speed up execution of Basic programs,
a toolkit providing the user with seven
useful commands, a  compressor to
reduce the amount o f space that a
program takes up and an analyser that
produces a list of important program
information.
Getting Started
Unlike many other program houses,
Systems Software does not put any
protection on programs. This means
that you can make copies o f any
programs that you want to use and
place them on the relevant disk.
However, before you can start any
program you must enter a series of
colour codes. These vary every time
the program is used and are found on a
coloured grid o f 2 7 '
people d o n 't l i k e  th i s  typ e  o f
protection as i t is time consuming
ﬁnding the codes every time the

drudgery out of Basic programming.
Ox-Comp
C64 R E V I E W
By Stuart Cooke
program is to be used. Personally I
don't mind it, the fact that you can
make a backup of expensive software
is much more important to me.
Probably the best way to deal with
this package is to take a look at each
section in turn.
This section of the package is a Basic
compiler. in essence this takes a Basic
program and turns i t into machine
code generating a program that will
RUN much faster than the original
Basic version.
Before you can use the compiler for
the ﬁrst time you must set yourself up
with a  series o f work disks. These
should consist of a disk containing the
compiler and one containing a set of
compiler utilities.
Compiling a program is extremely
easy. All you have to do is RUN the
OX-COMP program a n d  when
requested enter the ﬁlename o f the
Basic program to be compiled. The
program will then do the rest.
OX-COMP i sn 't totally com-
patible with C64 Basic, though the
differences shouldn't cause anyone too
many problems. Perhaps the major
difference between normal Basic and
OX-COMP is with arrays.
OX-COMP does not allow you to
use three dimensional arrays within
your program. However if you do have
YOUR COMMODORE june 1987
72
a program that uses this type of array
then there is help to hand. One of the
OX-COMP utilities, PRE-SCAN, will
go through a program and change all
three dimensional arrays to 2D.
OX-COMP also needs to know, at
compile time, the dimensions of all
arrays. Therefore you can't use a
parameter as the dimension o f  an
array, you must use a constant. This
shouldn't cause any problems i f you
dimension the array to the maximum
size you expect to need.
Other commands not allowed in
OX-COMP are L t s
SAVE.
Programs that are to be used by
OX-COMP can make use o f extra
commands that the package provides.
User deﬁned string and mixed
functions are allowed.
Integer FOR/NEXT loops are
allowed. This gives a  slight speed
advantage when the program is used.
When writing a  normal Basic
program only the ﬁrst two characters
of a n y variables a re  taken into
consideration, for example. DEVICE
and DEVELOP would be the same as
far as Basic is concerned. With OX-
COMP you can force the compiler to
recognise every character of a variable
name, in the above example the two
variables would he different.
Simple commands a r e  also
included to  enable and disable the
STOP key.
Before y o u  ca n  compile any
program it is important that you check

for errors. Since a  machine code
program does n't h a v e  a n y  l i n e
numbers, i f  an error occurs while
running a compiled program, it isn't
easy to sort out exactly where in the
original Basic program the error is. A
utility program is provided so that, if
your compiled program stops with an
error, y ou c an ﬁnd o u t  a t  whic h
program line this occured. It's now up
to you to get out the original Basic
program, ﬁnd and solve the problem
and then re-compile the program.
If y o u  a r e  a  g o o d  B a s i c
programmer but don't want to start
learning mac hine c ode t h e n  t h is
compiler will be an extremely powerful
tool, y ou can write your programs
easily, make sure they work and then
use the compiler to speed things up.
Analyzer
When you write a Basic program it is
very difﬁcult to remember if you have
used a speciﬁc variable or whether you
have some lines from an earlier version
of the program that are no longer
needed. A N A L Y Z E R  pr oduc es
reports on the speciﬁed Basic program
allowing y ou t o  check the program
thoroughly.
Once t h e  A N A L Y Z E R  h a s
'looked' at the program speciﬁed,
menu is is produced showing the various
options available.
The ﬁrst option is to produce a
'Flow cross reference'. This is a list of
all lines that are accessed by a GOTO
or GOSUB statement followed by the
lines that call them. This is useful if you
are trying to trace a program through.
The 'Data cross reference' option
produces a list o f  a ll the variables,
arrays and functions that are used
within a program. Again a list of the
lines where they are used follows the
%ariable name. This option is great if
you are trying to ﬁnd out just what
variables are being used. It also helps
when you want to make sure that you
haven't used the same variable for
more than one purpose, an extremely
common programming fault.
An interesting option is  that o f
'dead wood analysis'. This produces a
list of all the lines that arc in a program
that w ill never b e  reached. I f  a
program h a s  under gone m a n y
modiﬁcations it  is  not unusual for
program lines to become redundant,
Compressor
Toolkit
C64 R E V I E W
this option allows you to see just which
lines are no longer used. This is also
useful when debugging a program as it
allows you to check if a certain section
of the program is being reached.
One nic e feature o f  the 'Dead
Wood' o p t i o n  i s  t h e  f a c t  t h a t
ANALYZER w i l l  s tr ip these lines
from the program and SAVE the new
version out to disk.
If you want t o  improve on the
execution speed o f  any  program,
placing all of the variables in the ﬁrst
lines will help. The Generate Header
File option will create a ﬁle that sets up
all of the variables in your program.
This c an then b e  added t o  y our
program with the MERGE function of
the toolkit.
The ﬁnal option of this section of
the package is the ability to print out
i n f o r m a t i o n  a b o u t  t h e  ﬁl e .
Information provided is the length of
the program, how many variables that
you have used, the arrays that you
have us ed a n d  h o w  many  lines ,
GOT0s, G O SUBs , variables a n d
arrays are in the program.
When you have generated what you
think to be the most effective Basic
program by using the ANALYZER to
strip unwanted lines and created a
header for the program, there will no
doubt be further ways of improving
the operation and saving space. The
compressor helps  w it h  t h is  a s  i t
removes all unnecessary spaces and
REM statements from the program. It
then packs as many  statements as
possible on to each program line and
then ﬁnishes b y  renumbering t h e
program. T his  results i n  a  muc h
smaller Basic program that will usually
RUN a little bit faster.
Do make sure that your program is
bug free before you use this type of
program since it is impossible to de-
bug a compact program.
This program Merges itself into an area
of the C64's memory which is not in
use when wr iting Basic programs.
Once this has been done the Basic
language on your C64 has a further
eight commands added to it. I f  you
already own a programmer's toolkit
YOUR COMMODORE june 1987
73
then this may not seem to offer many
commands, however, the commands
are the ones that 1 ﬁnd myself using
most o f  the time fr om the larger
packages.
The commands available are:
FIND: this is used to search through a
speciﬁed program range for a speciﬁc
string o f  characters, y ou c ould for
example list all the lines in the program
that c ontain the string PR IN T  o r
specify that you want all of  the lines
from 1000 onwards that contain a
PRINT statement.
CHANGE is  a  modiﬁcation o f  the
above command as it also searches as
speciﬁed f o r  a  speciﬁc string. T he
modiﬁcation is  that this  command
allows you to then change the string
into a new one. For example you may
change all o f  the PRINT statements
between lines  500 a n d  1000 in t o
PRINT
DUMP w ill display a list o f  all the
variables used in a program and their
values. This  is  an extremely useful
command to have when trying to de-
bug a program since you can look at
the state of each variable.
INFO is  similar t o  the Basic FRE
command as it gives you statistics on
the program i n  memory. I N F O  is
greatly expand from the usual FRE
statement since it not also gives the
amount o f  free memory but many
other parameters a s  w e ll.  D a t a
produced by this command is:
1) The number of bytes occupied by
Basic.
2) T he number o f  bytes used b y
variables.
3) The number of bytes used by arrays.
4) The number of bytes used by strints.
5) The number of bytes free excluding
variables etc.
6) The number of free bytes including
variables etc.
As you can see, quite a comprehensive
range of information.
MERGE a l l o w s  y o u  t o  mer ge
programs together. This is very useful
if you have a library of subroutines,
such as ones to read the joystick or
produce sounds. You can MERG E
this into any program that you are
writing and it will save you from re-
keying all of the program again. The

only real problem with this command
is that it is up to you to make sure that
the programs to be MERGEd do not
have any line numbers that are the
same.
RENUMBER as its name suggests,
allows y o u  t o  RENUMBER th e
program lines. This RENUMBER
takes care of all GOTOs GOSUBs etc.
as well as allowing you to specify if you
only want to  RENUMBER certain
areas of the program.
DELETE simply erases the speciﬁed
range of lines from a program.
TYPE allows you to read the contents
Of the speciﬁed ﬁle on screen. This is
exceptionally useful i f you want to
examine the contents of a SEQ ﬁle say
from a database or wordprocessor.
SIZE will give you the program size of
any a speciﬁed ﬁle on disk.
Verdict
C64 R E V I E W
As I have already stated, the range
of commands presented is not great
but the ones that are available are all
extremely useful a n d  n o  Basic
programmer should be without them.
Oxford Basic offers th e  user a
sophisticated and extremely useful
range of utilities. There isn't such a
thing as a perfect piece of software and
Oxford Basic is no different.
Probably, my main gripe about the
package is that in the routines that are
asking for a ﬁle from disk you are not
able to get a directory and check the
ﬁles on disk. For example say you
want to  compile a  program called
FRED/I you could enter this only to
ﬁnd that the ﬁle isn't on the disk in the
drive. Without a directory option you
have to stop the compiler program.
LOAD the directory, list i t to  the
YOUR COMMODORE june 1987
74
screen, to ﬁnd your program is really
FRED, I, a n d  th e n  re-load th e
compiler, g o  b a ck through th e
protection scheme and then try to
compile the program again. A simple
display directory option would SAVE
a lot of time.
A RAM-DISK program is also
available from System Software. This
allows you to treat an area of the C64's
RAM as a  disk drive giving you
immediate acess to small ﬁles. I t  is
possible to buy Oxford Basic together
with this program, but we didn't have
access to it for this review.
The package may seem a  little
pricey to some people but if you take a
look at each o f the programs that it
provides, you can see that it is well
worth it.

hardware and software packages have
proliferated at the speed o f bunnies.
There are now so many music and
MIDI packages. on the market that it is
difﬁcult to know just what is available.
Between me writing this and you
reading it, new programs will have
appeared and others updated. Some
may have been removed from sale, new
companies will have been formed and
some companies may even have ceased
trading. Yes, it's a busy life in the
MIDI music software market.
Niaking a Choice
Mere arc more music and M ID I
packages for the Commodre 64 that
ann the other computers put together
so you couldn't have chosen a better
computer for making music. Choosing
a package is another matter. How do
you decide? This guide is aimed at
helping you narrow down the type of
package you are interested in. Most
companies will be pleased to send you
!heir literature and some will be happy
to answer any queries you may have by

One important point to bear in
mind is this: most manufacturers

produce their own interface and their
software usually won't work with a
different one. This could severely limit
your choice as, having bought an
interface yo u  could ﬁnd yourself
restricted to software packages from
that one company. Some producers,
however, a r e  converting th e i r
programs to run with other interfaces.
This can only be good for the customr
- that's us - and is to be welcomed.
MIDI is not the be all and end all of
computer control, however, and there
are other stand-alone packages which
you may like to  consider such as
Commodore's Music Expansion
System. Perhaps something like that
suits you better. Don't let technology
bully you into buying a  computer
music system. Look into the subject,
read about what it can do and then
made your decision.

Commodore Interface
Commodore produces the cheapest
MI131 interface on the market s o  far-
at E19.95, designed fo r  use with
packages such as the Music Studio,
Music Expander a n d  Sampler. N o
separate software is available yet.
Also, i n conjuction with Music
Sales, Commodore h a s several
programs and add-ons a t pocket-
money prices. For example, a little
clip-on keyboard overlay and album
music to play. The Music Expansion
System (1144.99) consists o f  a
keyboard. some S W  voice editing
software and an FM Sound Expander.
All i te ms should b e  available
separately. FM systhesis is really the
bee's knees - as long as you don't have
to program i t  -  but the Expander
restricts you to only a few presets.
The new packages are available to
supplement the Expander's restricted
facilities; an Editor to help program in
music notation (both at g24.99). You
should really budget for the Editor
along with the Expander and if you r're
at home with music notation, get the
Composer. too,

EMR's Commodore 64 interface is
k'ery reasonable (179.90) a link box
called MIDLINK (134.95) with one
MIDI IN and six MIDI THRU sockets
is also available.
Software for the C64 includes the
Miditrack Performer (E49.95), all
eight-track, real-time polyphonic
sequencer with features such as punch-
in ( n o  punch-out, though) track
merging and transposition.
Their Miditrack Composer (S:44.95)
is a six-track step-time editor with a
good range o f  editing facilities
although you will ﬁnd it difﬁcult to
enter odd note durations -  as I
sometimes wish to do during frenzied
bouts of composition.
The Miditrack Editor (S:39,95)
gives you step-time editing control
over the Performer tracks and will
convert Composer tracks to real-time.
This really takes you down among the
bits and bytes.
Finally, Vu-Music (i 2 4 .9 5 )
converts M I D I  i n fo  i n to  visual
patterns. It only does this in real-time,
however, a n d  cannot produce a
display from a pre-recorded piece.
EMR software gives you a great
deal o f  control over your music
although i t helps i f you have some
knowledge of MIDI. The packages are
quite cheap for the facilities offered
and are continually being updated.

Jellinghaus
The Jellingha us Commodore 6 4
interface ( 9 0 )  was commissioned
from SIEL (see SIEL) and has a MIDI

and an external Clock In.
The I2-track Recording Studio
(f99.95) is a real-time package which
holds velocity, after-touch, pitch-bend
and patch-changfe information. It is
quite easy to use but the manual could
be better (unless it has been improved
recently).
The Sequence Chain Program (.E45)
allows sequences t o  b e  linked t o
produce changes in time signature and
tempo. Patch changes can also be
stored.
The Scorewriter (1340) produces a
hardcopy o f  your music, including
lyrics. It contains three programs on
EPROM: th e  12-track Recording
Studio, the Sequence C'hain Program
and the Scorewriter itself which seems,
therefore, to cost around £195. Rather
expensive, perhaps, but the EPROM
means the programs are instantly
available. The program works well but
you may have to do a lot of setting-up
to produce the results you want. The
manual could be better but the printed
notation is excellent.

Joreth
The Joreth Music Composer System
(225) comprises their own AL25
interface a n d  software (recently
upgraded) which includes real- and
step-time sequencing and editing.
Joreth's approach has been aimed
at th e  musician rather than the
computer buff. Th e  70-plus page
manual contains all you need to know
and„ although it is quite a lot to wade
through. a  Quick Reference Guide
helps so don't be put off. There are also
several loose sheets o f  notes,
information and corrections.
The program otTers eight-track
real- and step-time sequencing and
uses a simple low-level MCL (Music
Composition Language), Although it
takes a  signiﬁcantly different
approach to most software packages it
is easy t o  u se  considering i ts
complexity. I t  must b e  a  strong
contender for the best overall C64
MIDI package.
Other programs include a Real-
Time Part Loader (E11.85) which
allows the loading o f real-time ﬁles
part by part, from multiple ﬁles.
The K e y  Programmer (EI 1.85)
accepts input in any key (or even no
key) and allows key selection for
printout at a later date.
For Casio C Z owners, the Tone

and permits voice storage on disk a
real boon.

It's a rather superb voice editor and

320 free sounds and a sophisticated
library organisation system which lets
you build up and name your own
blanks of 32 voices.

facilities and is worth considering if
this is your ﬁrst interface.

Software f o r  th e  Commodore

MID1/8 Plus (C120), four- and eight-

The software is fairly easy to use, has
good editing facilities and lets you
merge tracks very easily.
Music Shop for MID I (9 0 ) is a
step-time program. Notes are entered
and shown in traditional notation and

much MIDI exotica is not supported, a
fact which will not worry many users
but bear it in mind. It works superbly
with multi-timbral instruments such as
Casio's CZ synths. A very good and
easy introduction to MIDI and good
value.
Also available is the Midi Player

For example, it lets you convert music

The Expander Editor (I:53) helps
enormously with editing on SIEL's
Opea 6, DK600 and Expander 6 by
showing parameters graphically on the

DK80. Both programs have good
graphics and editing facilities. A
MIDI Data Base (E39) can store
250 patches from any MID I synth
apart from Yamaha's DXs and Casio's
CZs. That probably excldes more than
half the synth owners in the UK but if
you're one of the others it's a worth-

Steinberg's Pro 16 Sequencer (:100) is
a 16-track real - a n d  step-time

P
he is, trying to eke out an existence and
everywhere he looks, he is faced with a
plethora of advertisements imploring
him to computerise. The idea makes a
lot o f sense but where does he start?
What machine and, more importantly-
what software does he need?
There is also the small matter of
cost. Hardware can cost anything from
a few hundred pounds up to an inﬁnite
limit. Then you need to buy the big
three — a word processor for your
letters, a  spreadsheet for managing
your ﬁnances and a database to keep
track of all your clients. The list goes
on and on. Wouldn't it be nice if you
could use the C64 that you've already
got instead of splashing out on a new
system.
Well, surprise surprise, you can. I
wouldn't really be writing this article
otherwise. Th e  software packages
mentioned above have been available
for a long time but there has always
been t h e  nagging problem o f
compatibility —  how easy is i t to
transfer information f r o m  y o u r
database to your word processor or
whatever?

By Gordon Hamlett
product which ca n  d o  a l l  this.
Database Software has put together a
fully compatible big three. Not only
that, graphics, communications and
label printing packages have been
thrown in as well. Very useful, you
may say. All I've got to do now is save
enough pennies to buy this Mini Ofﬁce
11.
That shouldn't be too difﬁcult
either for, unbelievably, the package
comes in at well under 20 pounds! And
if that still proves to be too much, you
can always enter our competition this
month and try to win one!
The package comes on tape or disk
but anyone wanting to use any sort of
computerised system t o  ru n  their
business will soon discover that a tape
based s y s te m  s o o n  becomes
unmanageable. That is not to say that
the tape package is useless. It is ideal
for anyone who wants to learn about
using business software.
In the Ofﬁce
On loading Mini Ofﬁce II, you are
presented with a main menu allowing
you to access any of the six programs.
Selecting one o f  these loads the
appropriate program and leads you

YOUR COMMODORE june 1987

printer is fully supported and most
others should work perfectly. The only
problem areas are likely to  be in
printing screen dumps fr o m  the
graphics package.
Word Processing
The w o r l d  processor i s  fairly
comprehensive, containing the
majority o f commands that you are
ever likely to use. These commands are
entered via a  combination o f  the
control, logo and function keys. I
found these to be strangely organised
but this could just be that I am used to
a totally different set of commands on
my current wordpro. Files can be
saved either as text or ASCII. This
latter option is useful i f you intend
sending a document somewhere down
a modem.
Before you print a document, you
can alter various settings — headings,
margins. page length etc. If you are
likely to use the same settings time and
time again, it will be worth your while
setting u p  a  ﬁle containing these
commands that you can call up at will
rather than have to enter everything
separately all the time. Other facilities
include a mail merge — useful when

Computer Card Index
A database i s  n o  more than a
collection of information. Where the
computerised version scores over the
traditional card box is the way that
information can b e  accessed and
manipulated.
The database consists of a series of
records. Each separate record might
correspond to e.g. a name and address
of a customer or details of a record in
your collection. Each record is further
divided up into ﬁelds e.g. title o f
record, recording artist, recording
company, date of release and price.
In Mini Ofﬁce II. each record can
consist of up to 20 ﬁelds and you can
design the structure yourself. you can
specify whether you want a ﬁeld to
contain alphanumeric characters (i.e.
anything), decimal, integers, date or a
formula. Designing t h e  actual
structure of a record is the hardest part
and some considerable thought should
be used. How many records you can
have in a particular database depends
on how b i g  the record is. One
disadvantage o f the C64 is that the
available memory soon gets used up
although you can o f course set up
several similar bases i f you ﬁnd that
you have too many records.
Where d a ta b a se s b e co me
particularly useful is when you want to
access the information. Records can be
sorted on any ﬁeld or a combination of
them and it is easy to extract bits of
information rather than complete
records. A typical example would be a
club secretary writing to his members
to remind them that their annual
subscriptions a re  n o w  due. N o t
everyone will have joined at the same
time so you instruct the computer to
, pull out only those records that apply.
you can then use the mail merge
l-'facility in the wordpro to send them a
personalised renewal form.
If planning a database is hard, then
doing the same for a spread sheet is
doubly so. Yet for anyone running a
small business, th e  results a re
deﬁnitely worthwhile.
Calculations
Picture This
R E V I E W
A spreadsheet is no more than a large
piece of paper, divided up into rows
and columns, with each individual
area called a cell. You put ﬁgures into
these cells and the computer juggles
them a b o u t f o r  y o u .  S o u n d
complicated? It's not really that bad.
Suppose that you were using the
spreadsheet to keep a note o f your
company's money — bills to be paid
and invoices received. You could set
things up as follows:- Across the top of
the sheet, you could have a column for
each month of the year and down the
side, details of your previous expenses
and proﬁts. Data can then be entered
accordingly.
So far, this does not seem to offer
much of an advantage over the paper
and pencil method. The ﬁrst advance
comes from the fact that a particular
cell can also be a formula rather than
just an item of data. Thus you could
have a row marked total expenses and
let the program work out the sum of
the previous rows for you. OK, so it
saves you a bit of time but it's still not
exactly mindblowing. But what if the
Chancellor suddenly decides to alter
the rate of VAT. It will take you ages to
recalculate everything by hand. But it
is simple using a spreadsheet and you
can have the new ﬁgures in a matter of
minutes.
Then you can start making 'what if'
calculations. What if I cut the price of
my products but sell 10% more etc-?
The spreadsheet allows you to examine
the various possibilities so that you can
maximise your proﬁt.
Unless your name is Isaac Newton or
similar, given a page full o f ﬁgures
— e.g. a spreadsheet — most people
look blank. It doesn't matter that you
have everything neatly labelled o r
whatever, very few people can extract
any sort o f meaningful data quickly
when it is presented like that.
Roll o n  the graphics package.
Information can be saved from the
spreadsheet f o r  representing
graphically. Typically, this will be the
totals produced by the spreadsheet e.g.
YOUR COMMODORE june 1887
79
monthly proﬁt, but information can be
entered directly.
There are three forms of display
available to you — a bar chart, a line
graph and a pie chart. These can all he
labelled and you can use different
types o f  shading t o  delineate the
various sections. Presentation of data
is becoming increasingly important. If
you can show your bank manager a
graph o f  your projected proﬁts, he
may be more willing to sift through the
raw data than i f you just gave him a
spreadsheet and told him to draw his
own conclusions.
Extras
The other two features of Mini Ofﬁce
II are a communications package and
a label printer. The comms package
can b e  used either vi a  a  serial
modem/RS232C or Compunet. The
protocols have been established for
Microlink/Telecom Gold but you can
establish your own protocols i f you
.
somewhere else.
The label printer lets you design
your own layout and size. Information
can then be pulled from your database
ready for printing.
Verdict
Who would use Mini Ofﬁce /1? It is
ideal for anyone who is running a club
and wants to maintain records of its
members. I f  you are running a
business, again the package is excellent
but... think long and hard about plank
for your expansion. If your business is
likely to remain at its current level then
ﬁne, but if you intend branching out,
you may be advised to invest in a more
powerful micro. N o t because Mini
Ofﬁce is no good, but because of the
limitations of the C64.
The package itself is superb value
for money and has got to be one of the
bargains of the year.

Entry program has been written with
you, the reader in mind, No longer will
it be a painstaking ordeal, typing in all
the long list of data. This program will
ensure a 100% correct entry, each and
every time you use it.
It has become apparent that a
number o f people are experiencing
problems using an earlier version of
this program. The program presented -
here is an update of this version and
cures any problems that we arc aware
of.
For your own safety, do not use the
ﬁrst version of Hex Data Entry.
On ﬁrst entering the Hex Data
Entry, only the LOAD DATA and
DATA ENTRY options are available
to you. This is because the buffer is
empty, and the other two options
require data to be present. On selecting
the LOAD D ATA option, you are
asked for TAPE or DISK. Press either
*T' o r  ' D '  then RETURN. Th e
program remembers t h e  l a s t
Input/Output, and so it is possible to
just hit RETURN if the correct device
type is being displayed. You are then
required to enter a ﬁlename.
If you should make an error in your
ﬁlename entry, you may either delete
single characters by the DEL key, or
SHLFT/CLRHOME will delete the
whole ﬁlename. After the prompt, hit
return and the ﬁle will be loaded into
the buffer. The program will allow ﬁles
up to 95 blocks in length to be loaded

Entry II
An updated version of our machine code entry program.
By M.C. Stretton assisted by P.A. Eves
in. If you want larger programs to be
entered, you will have to split them
into two or more parts ﬁrst.
The SAVE option is identical to the
LOAD, except th a t i t  takes the
contents of the buffer and saves them
out to the given start address. This will
save an executable ﬁle, that can be
loaded and run, independent o f the
Input program.
Data Entry
The Data Entry option is the option by
%vhich you can enter data from Your
Commodore. or your own creations.
Once this option is selected you are
asked i f you want to continue from
the given address. I f  you have just
'LOADed' a tile, this address will be
the next available byte in the buffer.
(Allowing you to add more data to the
end of the loaded ﬁle). Therefore if you
wish to continue typing in at the last
address, type 'Y'. If 'N' is pressed the
program assumes you are starting a
fresh entry. When this happens the
buffer is reset to zero, thus losing any
program currently in memory. (I have
chosen SC000 as the normal start up
address purely because most M /C
progs reside here). After pressing 'N'.
you are then asked for the starting
address, i n  Hex. A n y  valid H e x
number is acceptable, e.g. $400, $COO,
$C0400. I n  this example, the ﬁrst
ﬁgure, $400, would be interpreted as

is taken to be $0286.
Once the start address is given, you
are asked i f you want checksums or
not. I f  you are typing in a program
from Your Commodore your response
will be 'Y'.
The screen display now changes to
show the current address being poked
into. Type any valid Hex number and
the program automatically skips the
next byte without the need to type
commas, spaces o r returns. I f  you
make a mistake, one press of the DEL
key will erase the whole number. If in
the no checksum mode, when you get
to the end of' the line, the line will
automatically scroll up ready for your
next input.
If in checksum mode, after eight
bytes are entered you must type the
two digit checksum at the end of the
line. Unlike the no checksum mode
you now press return to enter the line.
If the program ﬁnds that the
checksum does not match the line
entered, a warning tone will be sound,
You will then be asked if you wish to
either: a) Re-enter the line or b) Re-
enter the checksum.
After checking your line, i f you
ﬁnd you have entered it wrongly, then
press 'L'. The line will be erased and
you then re-enter it correctly. If you
ﬁnd that you have only made a mistake
in typing in the checksum, then press
'C' and re-enter it. Should you wish to
stop entering data, simply press return

or space bar on a blank line to get you
back to the main menu. Here you may
SAVE your program so as to restart
another day, or you may wish to see a
printout.
On choosing the print option, you
have a choice of hard copy or screen
copy. The listing can be paused at any
time by  pressing down and holding
clown a n y  k e y .  Pr e s s in g  t h e
RUN/STOP key and holding it down
will break out of the print mode and
return you to the main menu.
The left arrow key stop left of the
keyboard', acts as zero when typing in
your data. The space bar acts as the
return key when entering data, thus
leaving you free from searching for the
return key.
I hope that this program will help
to take the drudgery out of typing in
long lists of data statements.

P
that supplements the List function on
the Commodore 64,
The normal L i st command i s
adequate if you are working on a small
program. With larger programs it has
some drawbacks; you need to either
remember line numbers or LIST all of
the program up to the section on which
you are currently using the CTRL key
and RUN/STOP to stop the display.
This procedure is. to say the least.
clumsy and inefﬁcient -  especially
since it is frequently repeated during
program development.
One answer to the problem would
be a scrolling program lister which
allows you to list both forwards and
backwards through the program to the
appropriate point. Th i s i s  most
deﬁnitely a n  improvement, b u t i t
would still require a line number to be
typed in each time i f  you are not
working near the start of the program.
An Alternative
The Page-Lister utility presented here
is an alternative to scrolling and it is. I
believe, more practical. Instead o f
scrolling. Page-Lister allows th e
program being developed to be listed
as selected screens of 'pages': stopping
after each complete page. I t  then
allows yo u  t o  continue t o  page
forwards or backwards through the
program, editing as required. The size
of the page is initially set to 21 lines.
This may be altered, however, so that
you could, if you wanted, display the
program a line at a time, stopping after.

Other functions allow you to list
the ﬁrst or last page of the program or
to shift th e  display forwards o r
backwards a speciﬁed number of lines
relative to the current line number at
the top of the page. You may also list a
page starting from a  speciﬁed line
number or re-display the current page.
The current page location is always
remembered b y  Page-Lister. Th i s
means that you can work o n  a
particular page. run the program. and
then re-display the page you were
working o n  without having t o
remember line numbers- a most useful
development aid.
Loading and Activating
Type in the Basic loader and save to
tape or disk, as usual, before running
to install the machine code. Type
SYS49152 RETURN to activate Page-
Lister -  this will cause the message
"PAGE-LISTER AC TIVE" t o  be
YOUR COMMODORE june 1987

displayed to inform you of its current
state. You will also notice that, when
active, Page-Lister sets character
colour to black. If SYS49152 is entered
again then Page-Lister is de-activated,
causing the message "PAGE-LISTER
INACTIVE
setting character colour to blue. Now
load a Basic program -  preferably a
large one -  and activate Page-Lister
before trying out the commands.
Page-Lister Commands
Page-Lister commands consist of one
letter followed by an optional number,
where applicable, and must be entered
on a blank line (i.e. extraneous data is
not allowed). The current +  or -
command is forced into the cursor
position immediately a fte r  the
READY prompt after a page has been
displayed. Thus scanning forwards or
backwards through th e  program

repeat key on (POKE 650, 128) then
you can page through a large program
very rapidly by simply holding down
the return key.
Keeping Track
The + command, if  entered with no
parameter, will move the display on
number of lines equal to one less than
the current page size. This means that
the bottom line of the current page is
retained as the top line o f  the next
page. The opposite is true o f  the -
command. The idea of this is to help
you keep track of where you are in the
program while paging.

computer keyboard just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one of the superb programs from Your Commodore.
Your ﬁngers reach for the keyboard and press the letters R,
1J and N .  Yo u  press RETURN, s it back and nothing
happens.
Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does
happen it's a matter of spending hours searching through
the program for any typing mistakes. No matter how lo ng
you look or how many people help you, you can usually
guarantee that at least one little bug slips through unnoticed.
The Your Commodore Software Service makes available
all of the programs from each issue on both cassette and disk
at a price of E6.00 for disk and £4.00 for cassette. None of the
documentation f o r  the programs is  supplied w ith the
software since it is all available in the relevant magazine.
Should you not have the magazine then back issues are
available from the following address:
IN FONET LTD, Times House. 179 The Marlowes, Hemel
Hempstead, Herts. HPI 1813.
TEL: (0442) 48435
please contact this address for prices and availability.
The Disk
Programs on the disk will also be supplied as totally working
versions, i.e. when possible we will not use Basic Loaders
thus making use of the programs much easier. Unfortunately
at the moment w e cannot duplicate C I 6  and Plus /4
cassettes. However programs for  these machines will be
available on the disk.
What programs are available?
At the top of each article you will ﬁnd a strap containing
the article type, C64 Program etc. So that you can see which
programs are available on which format you will also ﬁnd a
couple o f  symbols after this strap. The symbols have the
following meaning:
These programs are available on disk.
READERS SERVICE
Software
for sale
I f  you think that one of our programs looks very interesting, but you can't
afford the time to type it in then our software service will help you out.
This symbol means that the program is available on cassette.
Please Note
Since the programs supplied on cassette are total working
versions of the program, we do not put disk only programs
on tape. There is no sense in placing a program that expects
to be reading from disk on to tape.

POKEing Around
Bare Facts
E
the video display at some time o r
another. Writing a program that looks
professional requires an intimate
knowledge of the various functions of
the computer's video controller.
This article will provide you with
memory maps for the video controller
of all the popular Commodore home
computers.
It is beyond the scope of thisarticle
to explain exactly how how individual
memory location is used. We have
dealt with graphics in many articles in
the past.
Quite often we are asked the question.
what does this POKE do or why is that
POKE used? I f  you refer t o  the
memory maps printed here for the
video chips. and the earlier memory
maps printed in the February 1987
issue you should be able to ﬁnd out
what most o f the different POKEs
perform. For example. the best way to
attract anyone's attention t o  your
display is to alter the colour of the
screen display. This is extremely easy
to d o  o n  all o f  the Commodore
computers but must be approached in
a different way depending on the
actual computer that is being used.
To change any colour on the C64
you are required to access the video
controller directly w i t h  P O K E
instructions. If you have a look at the
memory map for this chip you will see
that the screen colour is stored in
memory location 53281 and the border
colour is stored in memory location
53280. Pokeing a number between zero
and 1 5  into either o f  the above
locations will change the relevant item
to the speciﬁed colour. For example:
P R O G R A MMIN G
In order to translate a screen display from one machine
to another an intimate knowledge of the machine's video
controller is required. We give comparisons of the video
on the popular Commodore machines.
FIGURE 1
C-16 COMMAND
COLOR SOURCE, COLOUR, LUMINENCE
SOURCE
0 =  BACKGROUND

2 MULTICOLOUR 1
3 =  MULTICOLOUR 2
4 =  BORDER
POKE 53280.0:P0KE53281.0
will change both border and screen to
black.
When trying to convert programs
to or from a C64 to any of the other
Commodore computers altering the
colours can become confusing. This is
because the C16. Plus/4 and C128 all
have Basic commands that allow you
to change the colours without referring
to POKEs. The syntax for the colour
commands are shown in Figure
Since all the above commands do is
to alter the registers in the machines
video chips, as you would yourself' on
the C64, i t is possible to access the
various registers yourself. If you refer
to the details for the C128 and C16/
Plus/4 you will see that the colour of
the border i s  stored i n  memory
locations: 5 3 2 8 0  a n d  65305
respectively. Should you enter the
following commands:
POKE 53280,0 on the C128 or
POKE 65305,0 on the C16 and Plus/4,
you will ﬁnd that the border colour
will change to black, just as though
you had entered the relevant COLOR
command.
Don't b e  afraid o f  POK ring
around in memory to see what effects
can be achieved, the worst that you can
do is crash your Computer so that you
have to reset it.

BBC has been common for some time.
But o n l y n o w  ca n  th e  humble
Commodore o w n e r access th e
cheapest general purpose database
around.
Background
Many years a g o  before h o me
computers were the reality that they
are now, it was still obvious that there
would be a need for a public computer
service. The original videotext concept
was designed with the paged system of
showing information o n  individual
pages with subsiduary frames for extra
information. From the start it was to
be a colour system and people would
be charged for using the information.
The video standard chosen was
now the familiar 40 x  24 Teletext
graphics system. At about the same
time however, meetings were going on
to create a  uniﬁed teletext system
based around similar ideas except that
the screen would be format based
around a 32 column format. In a mad
ﬁt o f standardization, both these
groups met and adopted the videotext
system. The name Videotext was then
adopted to cover both services.

Teletext
Most people imagine that Teletext is merely a sports
results and weather forecast service. With the C64
adaptor from Micro text. it can be much more.
By Mike Roberts
In Use
The format of teletext is dramatically
simple and is one of the best system
analysis jobs that I have ever seen. A
remote keypad is used to key in a three
digit number from an initial menu. The
ﬁrst menu leads to subsiduary menus
or to the information required. The
page can also be accessed directly if the
number is known or by looking on the
index. Once a page has been selected it
can ﬂick through a number of frames.
The transmission time aspect is
important. Depending on the service,
between tw o  and ﬁve frames are
transmitted per second. So when you
type in your page request you have to
wait a few seconds for it to appear. So
you acess the page number, read the
screen and, every 30 seconds, the page
will change to the next frame as they
cycle around. If you want the page to
stay longer then you can 'hold' the
page so that it will not be updated until
you want it to. Alternatively, you can
ask for an update which will put the
normal TV  picture back on to the
screen until a  new frame has been
received when it will automatically be
put up on to the screen.
The Commodore Connection
BBC micros (as usual) had the ﬁrst
YOUR COMMODORE june 1987
91
crack at Teletext with the incredibly
expensive Acorn Teletext adaptor.
However, this was the ﬁrst case that, if
the Acorn software failed to work, the
user could just download the patch to
ﬁx it from the TV. This downloading is
potentially the most interesting thing
about Teletext — think of each screen
as IK of information, then think of a
data rate of one Megabyte per second.
When Channel 4 started to use a
system very similar, they couldn't use
the BBC  system. So  a  Spectrum
Teletext adaptor was commissioned
and Teletext programs transmitted for
it.
Somewhere though, in the dash t
bring out Teletext adaptors for the
cheapest a n d  m o s t  expensive
computers on the market, one of the
best — the Commodore (34 — was left
out. Microtext has sought to remedy
the situation.
Nowadays the page acquisition
circuits are all self contained in mass
produced chips. The main problem is
interfacing them and building the
extremely good tuner that a teletext
pickup requires — ever seen a portable
with a loop arid with teletext? The
graphics picture i s  also another
problem — but not with modern home
computers.

C64 Adaptor
The Microtext Teletext adaptor gets
around the greatest problem, that of a
liner, by using a video recorder_ No,
you don't get one in the package, but
you do get six foot of cable. The cable
connects to the normally unused video
out socket to the video recorder_ This
connection puts out a good composite
video signal of whatever the video is
tuned to. This can also be connected to
a Commodore monitor.
Most video recorders have either a
phono or BNC connector on them.
The supplied cable has a  phone
connector on the business end and a
BNC adaptor. So there should be little
connection di fﬁcul ty. However,
having an all singing, all dancing,
stereo/RGB/digitally tuned/state o f
the art etc. television, my direct video
connection was already being used and
I had to disconnect the TV from the
video via this route and use the
normal RE connection to get the video
to talk to the TV again.
However, i f  you know enough
about TV/video hook ups to get a,
direct video connection going then
you should appreciate and understand
the problem. If you look behind your
TV and can only count two wires
(power and aerial) going to  it then
you're alright. It' you've got ﬁve or so
(like mine) and don't know why then
get help. Microtext say that they are
bringing out a separate tuner in the
near future that will alleviate all these
problems.
All this said and done it is easy to
connect the box to the wire, the wire to
the video, and th e  b o x t o  th e
Commidore 64. From here you load
the tape into the computer and away
you go.
The adaptor has most o f  the
functions of a normal TV adaptor and
one or two more that it is sensible to
have. To change channel you use the
channel selector switch on the video,
pages are selected by just typing the
number i n .  Standard functions
included are Reveal — that puts on the
screen information that i s usually
hidden, such as the answers to a quiz
— and Hold, freezing a page until it is
read.
Usual functions such as Expand.
which zooms in one the top or bottom
of the screen. Update, which was
described earlier, and mix are not
present —  though there are good
reasons for it. Expand is to let you read
the display easier at distance, TVs are
H A R D W A R E
usually watched from across a room. A
computer monitor is not usually set up
in this way. However, if it was being
used in a Teletext application a normal
TV would be used, i n  which case
normal Teletext rules apply.
Update and Mix are not present
becuase you can't mix a normal TV
signal in with the Commodore 64's
output so there is no need for them.
The ﬁnal missing command is TCP, or
time control program. This is where
you can program yo u r Teletext
adaptor to put up a page on the screen
at a  speciﬁed time. This is again
normally used t o  remind you o f
something when watching a normal
programme on TV. Though I wish it
could have been included.
There arc a lot of extra commands
though. You can call up the next or last
page, of limited use but nice anyway.
Save and Load will perform those
functions to disk or tape and would be
expected in a package of this type as
memory saves are awkward on a
Commodore as i t is. The last extra
command is the best of all, allowing
you to pring a page on to paper.
The Package
The Software is more in the form of an
operating system than of a program.
There are two parts to it. The ﬁrst is a
Basic program that provides all the
above functions, and the second is a
collection o f machine code routines
that actually do all the hard work like
accessing the screens.
Both programs are unprotected
and the Basic portion is documented
by REMs telling you what parts do
what, making i t easily customised.
Both prokrams are easy to save to disk
or tape. The machine code section even
has a routine to save itself.
The manual i s  a  marvel o f
documentation, afte a quick overview
of the system that explains a bit about
Teletext and the way i t is used. the
software is fully explained. Teletext is
largely self documenting and has help
pages on it.
As well as explaining all the system
calls to access the machine code, three
example programs are included that
expand th e  system slightly, f o r
instance accessing and printing out the
TV times for the evening. There is also
a patch on to the main program that
provides a screen dump on to a daisy
wheel printer.

Applications
Once you've got the hang of Teletext,
and that's not difﬁcult, you can do
what you like. The adaptor can be
programmed to do almost anything.
Just think, a database with most of the
information that you would never
need to access on Prestel, plus some
more that's constantly updated. No
line charges, n o  page charges, no
modem with indifferent software that
ties up a phone line for hours.
Applications that Microtext knows
of in use include, reading the football
results directly into a pools predictor
program to  keep i t updated. and a
program that analyses weather trends
by reading the weather map.
I know of someone %yith a BBC
micro that wakes itself up. prints out
the news and TV  information, then
wakes up his owner ready for his just
printed newspaper to read on the train
— and remember the news is only
minutes old, not up to 18 hours like a
normal hot lead and newsprint.
Conclusion
I've been using Teletext for nearly four
years now. As a result I  don't buy
newspapers and I don't buy any of the
TV listings magazines. The few pounds
extra on the price of a TV set is easily
worth having the extra facilities.
When I  ﬁrst started using the
Microtext adaptor I thought that all
there was to Teletext was what I'd
already been using, how wrong I was_
With computer control, a n d  a
computer contolled tuner and eight
Teletext channels to read off, I can use
Teletext as no-one ever intended. The
adaptor is good and produces less
errors than my normal Teletext set and
the software is excellent and easy to
SC
The initial price looks daunting
when compared to  the price o f a
Teletext TV set, but think what the
price of a Modem, good software, and
line charges would be after a few
months. This then becomes a  lot
cheaper.
Teletext has become m y  main
source of information, if I need any,
my handset bleeps purposefully. Now
with computer control the sky's the
limit. I  w o u l d n 't hesitate t o
recommend this to anyone.

popular p r o g r a m  amongs t  o u r
readers. Unfortunately we aren't able
to bring you more detailed instructions
as promised in this issue, however the
changes required for cassette users are
presented here widening the appeal of
this superior character editor.
The Changes
All o f  t h e  changes required a r e
extremely simple. Even i f  you are a
disk u s e r  t h e n  i t  i s  p r o b a b ly
worthwhile mak ing the changes t o
your program since it allows you to
select between tape and disk at will.
You never know when you might need
to SAVE something out to cassette.
The major change to the program
is the CHAR ED LOAD routine. This
program has been altered quite a Lot.
The new version of the program has
been printed here.
The C H A R  E D  M / C  L O A D
program needs a very minor change to
its very last line, 1040, this should be
changed to:
1040 SAVE "CHAR CODE", I
A number of lines need to be added
to the C H A R  H AS program, and
several modiﬁcations are also made to
some existing lines.
All of  the necessary changes and
additions a r e  presented her e a n d
should cause no problems.
REMEMBER when using cassette
the programs should be SAVEd in the
following order:
1) CHAR ED LO ADER
2) CHAR CODE — created when you
RUN the C H AR  E D  M X '  L O AD
program.
31 CHAR BASIC
It is important that you give the
programs the correct names or  the
program will not work.

T
programs is that once designed and
coded, they never work. If you have
designed a particularly long piece of
work, then it is a long and complicated
job trying to debug the program.
This program is designed to aid
programmers in debugging their mic
programs.
Loading and Running
Once you have typed in the loader, the
Basic program will save a copy of the
program o n  disk under the name
'ANALYSER'.
Once this is done you can either run
it in BANK 0  or 1. First load the
ANALYSER e i th e r  f r o m  t h e
MONITOR or from Basic using the
BLOAD command. Th e  program
MUST be loaded at address EA00, so
for example i f you want to load the
ANALYSER in BANK I  from the
monitor then type:
"ANALYSER",8, I FAO° o r  L
"ANALYSER",8
for loading into BANK O. If you don't
have a disk then you will have to save
the ANALYSER yourself using the
MONITOR, with the command:
S "ANALYSER",I,IEA00.1FEBO
after running the loader. (Don't forget
to delete the BSAVE command in the
loader.)
Load the program in as above, but
just replace the 8 with a
As the program can either run in
BANK 0 or I this gives plenty of scope
for other programs to run.

Analyser
Machine code programs are difﬁcult  to write, however
debugging them can be even more of a problem. This
program for your 128 provides some useful .
make this task easier.
By R. Assenheitn
Once Loaded
The way this program works, is to
allow the programmer to place 'break-
points' in a machine code program.
When the processor, as it is stepping
through a  machine code program,
reaches one of these breakpoints, an
interrupt occurs and control is then
returned back to  the ANALYSER.
This allows the programmer to use the
functions available either i n  th e
Analyser or the monitor, to see if the
program is doing what it should. These
breakpoints don't affect h o w  the
program runs, and it is possible to re-
start execution from one of these and
the 8502 will continue as though
nothing has happened.
The advantage of this is not only to
see what is happening at that point in
the code, but you are also allowed to
change the situation so as to test the
program response t o  different
circumstances. This is invaluable when
designing a bug-free program.
Another useful feature o f  this
program i s  th a t when y o u  a re
debugging a machine code program,
and something does go wrong. then
pressing RUN/STOP will exit this
program and return you back to the
Analyser command line, however.
there is a danger when using this with
the TR AC E facility. b u t this i s
described later.
The commodore key can be used to
slow output to  the screen, but DO
NOT use the NO SCROLL key as this
will cause the whole system to lock.
Two further features included are a
USER INTERFACE and the ability to
deﬁne how information is output.
The USER INTERFACE i s  a
relatively simple one. You enter a
YOUR COMMODORE june 1987
95
command and supply parametric data
with this command.
There are two ways of supplying
the parametric data. Either you can let
the Analyser prompt you fo r the
required information, or you can skip
all the prompting, and just supply all
parametric data straight after the
command word, and then press enter.
Just press enter on a prompt to
terminate the interaction between you
and the system and the system ignores
all previous input for the command.
The ability to deﬁne information
output is very useful. Since a machine
can access the screen directly, you may
be designing a screen o f some kind
within the program. You don't want
the An a l yse r  j u s t  d i sp l a yi n g
information anywhere, and messing
up the screen, and perhaps covering a
point on the screen you particularly
want to see.
The next section describes the
available examples on how to  use
them.
B P
This is used to set a breakpoint e  an
address either in Bank 0 or Bank
When program execution hits the
address speciﬁed, i t returns control
back t o  the Analyser, listing any
information required.
The parametric data required is:
ADDRESS o f  breakpoint (o n l y
possible in BANK 0 or BANK I).
TURNING ON or OFF a breakpoint.
If TURNING O N  then -  L IS T
MEMORY o r  REGISTERS ( i f
required).
Example I
BP

ADDRESS 0 2 0 0 0
ON/OFF O N
LIST/NOLIST ( NIL) . I
TYPE (A/R) 
A
ADDRESS 0 0 1 0 0
LENGTH 3 0
MODE ( H/D/C)  
D
Note
Typing N will stop further prompts.
A=address, R=r egis ter , H = h e x ,
D=dec. C=char.
Example I  sets a  breakpoint at
address 2000 in BAN K O. When the
8502 gets to this address in this bank,
you are returned to the command line
of the Analyser and the ﬁrst 30 bytes
from address 0100 i n  bank  0  are
displayed i n  dec imal.
The address is given in ﬁve bytes,
the ﬁrst byte being the BANK and the
next four bytes being the ADDRESS.
Please note that the BANK can ONLY
be 0  or I. I f  you specify a different
bank then t h e  system w ill decide
whether it is part of BANK 0 or I and
then use that RAM BANK.
If no BANK is given. then BANK 0
is the default.
The BANKS are deﬁned the same
way as the bank command available in
Basic.
As you get more experienced with
this program, the above example could
be entered on one line:
BP 02000 ON L A 00100 30 D
You can only have IL breakpoints
set at any one time.
For the more curious, the way
breakpoint works, is to place a hex '00'
(i.e. a BRK command) at the address
speciﬁed. When the PC reaches this
address it generates an interrupt. This
interrupt i s  detected, a n d  s o  t he
breakpoint routines are run.
If y ou disassemble a n  address
where You have placed a breakpoint, it
will be different as the the Analyser
changes the code at that point by
placing 00 at the address. OFF will
replace the code. You MUST place a
break point o n  a  C O M M A N D
boundary for it to work.
COLOUR
This allows the user to change the
colour o f  the border, background,
colour of cursor, and colour of output
C128 P R O G R A M  111
text. T h e  system w i l l  pr ompt f o r
required parameters.
Example 2
COLOUR 9 0 4 7
This sets border colour to brown,
background colour to black, cursor
colour to yellow and character colour
to purple.
The colour deﬁnitions are in the
same order as in Basic, but the starting
value is 0 not
The program won't let you deﬁne
the cursor colour (input ink) to be the
same a s  t h e  background c olour
(paper). This stops you from setting up
a situation where you can't see what
you are typing in. I f  you forget the
order. just type 'COLOUR' and the
Analyser w ill pr ompt y ou f o r  the
required information.
DELAY

the T RACE facility: I  =  fastest and

This ends the Analyser, removing all
breakpoints and IRQ vector changes.

MONITOR.
Example 4
END
GO
YOUR COMMODORE june 1987
96
This command i s  used t o  restart
execution f r om the last breakpoint
encountered which has been set up by
the Analyser.
The program will start as though
no stop has been encountered. This is
useful i f  y ou want t o  change the
conditions at a  certain point. Yo u
would do this by setting a breakpoint
at an address, and when it stopped,
you could change memory or registers
using the monitor (see later on how to
enter the monitor).
Example 5
GO
HELP
This lists all commands available to
the user.
Example 6
HELP (or just press the HELP key)
IR()
The trace facility requires the use of the
IRQ vector for it to work. This means
that the vector is  redirected. I f  the
program you are trying to debug also
requires the use of the IR() vector, then
the TRACE facility is lost. However, if
you stop your program from changing
the vector, and then use this command
to route the IRQ vector to the address
of your interrupt routine, then the
TRACE facility can still be used and
whenever an interrupt occurs, your
routine will be called. Please note that
if y ou d o n ' t  return t o  the usual
K E R N A L  I R Q  r o u t i n e  a f t e r
processing t h e  interrupt, then the
GRAPHIC command facility will not
be available to you.
Example 7
IRQ FFA65 (ﬁrst byte is the bank)
IRQ
Cur r ent a d d r e s s = F F A 6 5  n e w
address= xxxxx
Just pressing return here will exit
this command without any changes.
Otherwise, just enter the new address.
Again the default bank is BANK O.
JUMP
Similar in use to the 'G' commando]
the monitor, this allows the facilities of
the Analyser t o  b e  used o n  the
program to be debugged.
Example 8
JUMP 02000
This causes the program counter to
start executing in BAN K 0 at address
2000.
You c an jump to any o f  the 16
BANKS and this is the running bank
until changed by  the program to be
debugged.
If only the address is entered, then
the BANK defaults to O.

LIST
This command will LIST an area of
memory of a register.
Example 9
LIST
type (a/r) 
A

This command is usually used only
in conjunction with the BP command,
as described in  the 'BP' command

All commands in the monitor are
available, but t o  use the Analyser
properly, it is better not t o  use the G
command, but the 'JUMP' command
in the Analyser.
You c a n  c hange memor y , o r
change registers so that, on a GO or
JUMP command, these will be the new
values used.
DO NOT try to change the BANK
in the monitor  as this could have
unpredictable effects.
Example 11
MON
C128 P R O G R A M  111
PRINTER
This allows certain information to be
displayed on the printer, T he only
information that is listed to printer is:
I. t h e  lis t  information w hen a
breakpoint is encountered.
2, T he TABLE information.
3. T h e  information from the HELP
command.
4, T he WHERE information.
5, T h e  LIST  information from the
LIST command.
The T RACE data CANNO T  be
put to printer because of the nature of
the KERNAL software that drives the
serial bus.
Example 12
PRINTER ON (output to printer).
PRINTER OFF (output to screen < —
-default).
RESET
This will reset all screen deﬁnitions i.e.
it w i l l  r emov e G R A P H I C  a n d
WINDO W facilities.
Example 13
RESET
SPLIT
This command is useful if the program
to be debugged prints to the screen
using the KERNAL print routines. It
will divide all program output to the
tophalf of the screen, and all Analyser
output to the bottom half of the screen.
You specify the proportions for
output. -
Example 14
SPLIT 18
Will let the ﬁrst 18 lines of the screen to
be us ed b y  t h e  pr ogr am being
debugged, and the other six lines used
by t h e  Analy s er . T h e  R E S E T
command clears this feature.
TABLE
D
This lists all the breakpoints set at
present whether the TRACE is set or
not. It also displays what will be listed
when that breakpoint is reached, or
during a TRACE, If a '** is displayed,
then no information is displayed.

This lists 50 bytes from address
3F76 in BANK 4. The data listed is in
character format.
TRACE
Command is used to either turn the
TRACE on o r  off, and the L I ST
information is also deﬁned here. The
trace output is activated when a JUMP
or GO command is entered.
Entering the lis t information is
exactly t h e  s ame a s  i n  t h e  B P
command.
Example 15
TRACE ON N
This s ets  t h e  T R A C E  w i t h  n o
information to be listed.
Because o f  the way the TRACE
works, every I/50th o f  a second the
program is interrupted and the system
displays current position and any list
information required.
It does NOT display information at
every 6 5 0 2  c ommand. T h e  d a t a
outputed by  the TRACE cannot be
sent to printer. When a TRACE is on,
speed of execution is delayed. Coiltrol
of the amount o f  dealy is  v ia the
DELAY command.
WHERE
This c ommand lis ts  t h e  c urrent
address at which the program being
debugged has been stopped.
Example 16
WHERE
WINDOW
If your program does direct access to
the screen, you may want to have only

a small part of the screen disrupted by
output from the Analyser. This is done
via this command, and deﬁnes a
window as in the Basic command.

listings are free of those horrible little
black blobs which send you searching
around the keyboard for a suitable
graphic symbol. You may also have
noticed the funny numbers by the side
of each line of the listing. Fret no more,
its all part of our easy entry aid.
Instead of those nasty graphics and
rows o f countless spaces in PRINT
statements and strings we use a special
coding system. T h e  co d e , o r
mnemonic, i s always contained i n
square brackets and you'll soon learn
to decipher their meanings.
For example, (SA I would mean
type in a Shifted A. or an ace of spades
in layman's terms, and [SA10] would
mean a row of ten of these symbols.
1S+21 means hold down the shift
key and press the plus key twice. It
doesn't take a great leap of logic to
realise that [C-I-21 means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
If more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
[SPC41 or, exceptionally. ISSPC4].
Translated into English this means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
[CTRL N ,  DOWN2,LEFT5,BLUE,
1
This would be achieved by holding

down the CTRL key as you press N,
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holding down the
CTRL key, press the F3 key and,
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would of course make the computer
print in brown).
• Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen with no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
[SS],[0
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV T1 will
appear in a Listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by entering the
line up to this mnemonic. Then type a
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
out of quotes mode. Hold down CTRL
and press th e  number nine ke y
(RVSON), type the relevant number of
reversed T's and then hold down
CTRL and press zero (RVSOFF).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one of these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PRINT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation so this may
look something like:
YOUR COMMODORE june 1987
102
: C C = 2
Ignore the square brackets and just
type i n  a  shifted upward pointing
arrow (ie. the pi symbol).

The hexadecimal numbers appearing
in a column to the left of the listing
should n o t be typed i n  with the
program. These are merely checksum
values and are there to help you get
each line right. Don't worry i f you
don't understand the hexadecimal
system, as long as you can compare
two characters on the screen with the
corresponding two characters in the
magazine yo u  ca n  use o u r  line

Commodore.
At the start of each programming
session, load Checksum and run it.
The screen will turn brown with yellow
characters and each time you type in a
line and press the RETURN key a
number will appear on the screen in
white. This should be the same as the
corresponding value in the magazine.
If the two values don't relate to one
another, you have not copied the line
exactly as printed so go back and check
each character carefully. When you
ﬁnd the error simply correct it and
YOUR COMMODORE june 1987

press RETURN again.
If you want to turn off the checker
simply type SYS49I52 and the screen
will return to the familiar blue colours.
You can then do whatever it was you
wanted to do and if this doesn't use the
area where Checksum lies you can go
back t o  i t  w i th  th e  same SYS
command.
No system is foolproof but the
chances of two errors cancelling one
another out are so remote that we
believe our listings are more reliable
than any other magazine in the world.
So get typing!

we just call it Swift, but whatever you call
it. its the most affordable and easy-to-use
professional quality Spreadsheet around!
The Americans have voted with their
wallets and made Swift one of the top ten
Home Management programs, according
to the highly respected Billboard chart. But
its British. written by Dave Middleton of
Metamorphosis Developments, and
published in the UK by Audiogenic
Software.
Swift Spreadsheet is the essential ﬁnancial
modelling package. Use it in business, at
home, or in your club or society to help you
in budgetting, costing. quotations,
household ﬁnancial planning. or any task
where the manipulation of ﬁgures is

forecasting and decision-making due to its
-
instantly how results are affected when you
change one or more of the contributory
factors.
Even if you haven't used a Spreadsheet
before. you will soon be able to harness
the power of Swift to your own special
requirements.
