Foreword      xv
Foreword
I 
remember how excited we were when we were approached to support Xero For 
Dummies. We thought we’d made it as a software company — and now here we 
are with the 3rd edition!
To be honest, we found it humorous to see an ‘old world’ book about accounting 
in the cloud — a book on something that changes every week! — but it’s turned 
out to be a valuable way for accountants, bookkeepers and business owners to 
discover how best to use Xero and to understand what we’ve been trying to do to 
make life better for those in business.
Business can be fun. For most small-business owners, it’s certainly all-­consuming. 
In our previous roles we liked building businesses; we didn’t like the drudgery of 
administrative jobs and working late into the night to meet a looming tax return 
deadline. As we talked to other business owners it became clear that we weren’t 
alone — for most, doing the books was the number one pain of running a small 
business. It’s great to hear that the number of business owners is growing, but also 
that they’re capturing a better lifestyle, free to work anywhere at any time.
It’s also been great to see a thriving community of accountants, bookkeepers and 
add-on partners all working together to make life easier for small business own-
ers. Many bookkeepers are creating their own new businesses, helping others, in 
turn, grow. As the nature of work changes, small-business ownership is becoming 
a way of working for many people around the world.
The move to the cloud is in full swing and is driving productivity across econo-
mies. We’re seeing an exciting focus on small business as a sector that creates jobs 
and can deal with some of the big issues, like youth employment. The move to 
mobile in business has been a revelation, and over the next few years we’ll see 
business software become even more magical as we deploy artificial intelligence 
(AI) into business software.
This book is a great way for you to learn to work in the cloud, and we’re sure that 
as you go through it, or dip into it to take what you need, you’ll see that doing your 
accounts can be easy and rewarding. And hopefully your work will become just a 
bit more fun.

We love our community of customers and partners. And we love to hear what we 
can do better. Thank you for learning more about Xero and what we’re doing, and

Introduction      1
Introduction
B
efore I sat down to update this introduction to the 3rd edition of Xero For 
Dummies, I was providing a remote support session to a juice bar in 
Vancouver. By embracing technology, a small juice bar can access expert 
assistance from the other side of the world. Equally, I can view a Vancouver juice 
bar’s real-time data and work through its cash flow management strategies while 
sitting at my desk (with Charlie the dog at my feet) in Brisbane. This scenario 
illustrates the global opportunity that presents itself to small businesses that 
adopt cloud technology: Businesses can both access global help and grow their 
businesses globally.
Businesses can use cloud technology to produce accurate management (internally 
focused) and financial (externally focused) records with minimal effort. They no 
longer need to endure the laborious effort required to produce basic and unhelpful 
reports — reports that probably don’t reflect what’s actually happening in the 
business. You don’t need to be a big business to tap into big data!
Utilising technology and expert advice, organisations can streamline their busi-
ness operations, finding ways to identify and analyse their key financial and non-
financial drivers. With flexible access to timely and accurate information from 
within, and the potential to use external comparative data, businesses can use 
these collective insights to make informed decisions fast.
To stay ahead of the competition and capture the benefits of technology-based 
opportunities, businesses are moving their processes and data to cloud-based 
business platforms — which is where Xero comes in.
In your hands you have the essential guide to complement your journey with Xero. 
Taking your business to the cloud, and leveraging the power of Xero and its app 
partners, streamlines your business’s work flow and enables access to real-time 
informative dashboards you can confidently use for making business decisions.
Whether you’ve just started your journey with Xero, or you’ve been around for a 
while and are ready for some more expert tips or help with the more advanced 
options, you’re sure to find this book useful.
Xero For Dummies, 3rd Edition covers all you need to know to sign up and use 
this  cloud-based accounting software solution  — from the basic set-up to 

implementing daily routines and end of period procedures, and generating useful 
reporting information. Understanding what you can do with Xero — how you can 
use its many features — can enhance the productivity of your business, centralis-
ing data and giving you a clearer idea of exactly what is going on within it, whether 
you’re working within the business or as an adviser. While updates may happen 
after this book is published, you have the core fundamentals here. (After all, even 
though your car’s cassette tapes have been replaced with a multimedia centre, the 
basics of learning to drive remain the same!)
On your Xero journey, you can connect with expert advisers who are embracing 
the role of a VCFO — Virtual Chief Financial Officer — and who can assist you with 
the development of forecasts, budgets, management reports, and variance and 
capacity analysis. You may even decide to become a VCFO yourself!
About This Book
Xero For Dummies, 3rd Edition provides a comprehensive outline of how to use the 
Xero accounting cloud solution. The main focus throughout the book is how you 
can use Xero and its integrated cloud platform to access business intelligence. I 
realise that may sound a bit intimidating, but if you work your way through this 
book you’ll be your office (or virtual) Xero Hero in no time.
The book steps you through everything you need to know about Xero, taking you 
through the whole process. You’re never left hanging, wondering what you’re 
supposed to do next. I’m with you every step of the way. But the book sticks to the 
practicalities — I know you don’t need to be slowed down with unnecessary back-
ground information and theories.
Note: One of the great features of Xero being a cloud-based accounting solution is 
that Xero can make upgrades or updates to its pages or processes at any time — 
and so the next time you access your file, the upgrades have been implemented. 
No more waiting for the next software release! But this may mean a page or pro-
cess you’re looking at online isn’t exactly the same as that shown in this book. 
Don’t worry — the process should still be similar enough that you can use this 
book to guide you through. I no longer carry car keys, and now simply push a but-
ton to start my car — but the same driving basics still apply! Intuitive technology 
innovations aim to eliminate unnecessary steps — like looking for lost car keys!
Some really interesting information is provided in the sidebars through the book 
(those grey boxes with text inside); however, these are self-contained. You can 
skip over them while working through the more meaty areas if you choose.
2      Xero For Dummies

I’ve also used the following conventions throughout the book:
»
» I’ve included information for users with Adviser status, and provided informa-
tion about features only users with this access may be able to see. In Xero, 
your user role defines what you have access to. This book outlines all the 
features someone with full access, or Adviser status, may have in their Xero 
business solution. If you don’t have full access, this book still provides heaps 
of information on the features you can access. Check with your accountant or 
Xero Adviser if you’re unsure about anything.
Note: For US users, this user status is spelt Advisor. Rest assured that the 
information in this book that relates to this user status is the same — however 
it’s spelt.
»
» I’ve used consumer tax to cover GST, VAT, sales tax or any other tax your 
government has created for your business! Because this book has been written 
for an international audience, I’ve used this term as an all-encompassing 
reference for any sort of tax that could be added to a purchase — hope that 
makes cents!
»
» I generally use the term bank accounts to keep things simple; however, this 
term actually encompasses bank accounts and credit card accounts, and 
online payment facilities like PayPal.
Foolish Assumptions
It’s never nice to assume anything about people without walking a mile in their 
shoes. But to write this book I had to assume a few things. Firstly, I assumed you 
buckle down to work with a nice cup of tea, and when things get really hard you 
grab the chocolate. (Or is that just me?)
Here are some other assumptions I’ve made:
»
» You can navigate your way around a computer or a mobile device and 
understand the basic steps required to access the internet.
»
» You don’t have a background in bookkeeping or accounting. Through my work 
I’ve been exposed to literally thousands of people who have no accounting or 
bookkeeping background, and I’ve trained them in the essentials and got 
them up and running. I’ve used this experience to write this book in a way that 
highlights what’s important, and breaks it down appropriately.
Introduction      3

»
» You probably don’t have access to Hermione’s Time Turner or the TARDIS 
from Doctor Who, and your time is important to you. You want to work as 
efficiently and effectively as possible — so I’ve included lots of productivity 
enhancers.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the book I’ve used different icons, which appear on the left side of the 
page. These highlight handy pieces of information that enhance your understand-
ing and ability to use Xero. The following outlines what they stand for.
Xero is used internationally, and while the main skeleton of the software is identi-
cal for all users, some elements are specific to a particular jurisdiction. I’ve used 
this icon to highlight information that only relates to a specific country or 
­jurisdiction — if the information doesn’t relate to your country’s version of Xero, 
skip over it.
This icon highlights pearls of wisdom you should make a mental note about — or 
even write down for yourself in an actual notebook!
This icon flags tricky procedures or in-depth detail. Depending on your level of 
skill, you may want to ask your accountant for further advice on topics marked 
with this icon.
These show handy strategies and shortcuts to speed up your productivity or just 
generally make life easier — gained through my own experience.
This icon outlines something you should be aware of and highlights any issues so 
you’re prepared and empowered. If you’re reviewing a section that contains a 
warning, make sure you take the time to read it.
Beyond the Book
In addition to the material in the print or ebook you’re reading right now, Xero For 
Dummies, 3rd Edition also comes with some access-anywhere goodies on the Net.

Where to Go from Here
This book is written in modular style (and, no, that doesn’t relate to a new lounge 
suite). It means you can pick up the book, open it at any page, select a heading that 
takes your fancy and read the information under that heading.
It also means Xero For Dummies, 3rd Edition is not a story book — you don’t need 
to read it from cover to cover. Review the Table of Contents or the Index, locate 
what you’re looking for and jump straight into the section. If you’re totally new to 
Xero, or need more of an idea of what it’s all about, you should take a quick read 
of Chapter 1. Or, if you’re a people person, Chapter 5 is all about setting up con-
tacts in Xero.
If you need to set up your Xero file, start at Part 1. If you’re already set up and you 
simply need to enter data, start in Part 2, which covers contacts, sales, purchases 
and reconciling your accounts. If you need to do routine tasks in Xero, including 
preparing for period end, start in Part 3.
Just make sure you keep this edition of Xero For Dummies handy and, whenever you 
need to enhance your understanding of a feature, grab the book, open it to the 
relevant section and enjoy!
One last thing — with all the free time you’ll be enjoying once you’re up and run-
ning with Xero, feel free to drop by and say ‘Hi!’ to me on Twitter at @Heather-
SmithAU. You could even share with me a photo of you enjoying this book.

Getting to Know Xero
A
s a fresh-faced graduate, I arrived in Cheltenham, England, to start my 
first real job at an aerospace manufacturing business. Using a pencil, 
I  worked with a team of account clerks, processing journals on huge 
A2-size (420 × 594) sheets of paper. Towards the end of the day, we all handed our 
paper to a tiny grey-haired lady. She gathered the paper and, using a huge noisy 
mechanical calculator, added up our journal entries and updated the trial balance. 
When all the work was entered and the debits equalled the credits, she rang her 
bell, signalling we could go home.
One day a magical grey box arrived on my desk, and inside its screen were rows 
and columns. ‘What is this sorcery you have brought to our office?’ my fellow 
workers cried. I explained the magical box was a computer and what was inside 
was a spreadsheet. I could enter numbers and formulas and the computer would 
process the results. (Yes, I’m a dinosaur and worked in offices pre-computers!) 
Pretty soon after that, we said goodbye to the mechanical calculator and shipped 
it off to the local museum.
In the last 20 years, desktop accounting software has replaced a team of accounts 
assistants and grey-haired ladies ringing bells. And, with the emergence of the 
internet, the practice of accounting is again undergoing revolutionary changes. 
Chapter 1

10      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Using Xero as your accounting system, you have the ability to access and process 
accounts online from anywhere you can access the internet. Furthermore, this 
accounting software has the capability to seamlessly communicate with other 
software solutions, reducing the need for mundane data entry.
In this chapter, I give you a rundown of Xero, covering what it is and what it can 
do for you. I help you explore the different editions available (based on the needs 
of your business), take you through My Xero home page and the Xero Dashboard, 
and outline the different user roles available — again, the user role you choose 
depends on the needs of your business and how much involvement you want to 
have in its accounts. Finally, I give you an overview of how Xero’s tools and reports 
can help you with your strategic planning.
Understanding the Advantages of Xero
Xero is a subscription-based online small business accounting software. It does 
everything you would expect business accounting software to do; however, what 
is unexpected and quite revolutionary is the following:
»
» Users who’ve been given permission to access the Xero data file can access 
Xero over the internet and do accounting anywhere, anytime. Furthermore, 
users can access the same file simultaneously.
»
» You can authorise transactions that occur on your bank, credit card and online 
payment gateway statements to directly feed into the Xero system. Just like 
receiving email into your inbox, transactions feed into your accounts, ready 
for you to process. See Chapter 4 for more on bank feeds.
»
» You can create and send invoices, and do your bank reconciliation, via mobile 
devices, meaning you can issue your clients with invoices while you’re on-site 
with them.
»
» Through the concept of a single ledger, both you, as the business owner, and 
your accountant can access the same data, reducing the need to transfer 
data and improving efficiencies. Your tax accountant can finalise end of year 
accounts directly into the business organisation. See Chapter 11 for more 
on this.
»
» You can enable the software to communicate with other Xero users, or other 
online software programs. For example, Xero users can invite other Xero users 
to connect with them. This unlocks a portal between the two users’ data 
files — so, for example, when an invoice is created in one file, it appears to the 
other file as a draft bill. This opening up of data files minimises data entry, 
improves accuracy and hopefully helps with cash flow! More complex 

CHAPTER 1  Getting to Know Xero      11
communication connections can include CRMs (for managing customer 
relationships), inventory management, e-commerce and other add-on business 
solutions. With Xero at the core of your business’s operations, you can create a 
fully connected cloud business platform. See Chapter 16 for more on this.
Xero has been described as those vitamins disguised as gummy candies — users 
enjoy the software so much they forget they are actually doing accounting.
PROS AND CONS OF WORKING  
IN THE CLOUD
Do you recall the first time the internet really worked for you? From my apartment in 
Toronto I co-ordinated a reunion with friends from Singapore, New York and Texas via 
email. We were to meet beside the Snuffleupagus at Sesame Place in Pennsylvania. 
I was so impressed: I arrived at 10 am and everyone was there! We hugged and 
shrieked in excitement. Using email had saved us a small fortune in telephone charges 
and it was a breeze to use — all of us from the moguls to the mums understood how to 
do it. These days, imagining a time before email is hard. And one day, imagining a time 
when everyone didn’t conduct all their business in the cloud will be hard!
Working in the cloud means working via the internet — the files you’re accessing and 
working on aren’t stored on your computer. As with everything, benefits and concerns 
of working online exist. But, indisputably, working across the internet is the way of the 
future. Governments across the world are funding infrastructure that enables access to 
high-speed internet connections, ensuring their citizens remain competitive.
Without realising it, you may already be using cloud services. If you’re using a smart 
phone, email, internet banking, Skype, Google Apps, or storage services like Dropbox or 
Evernote, you’re embracing the internet — and some of these devices or services make 
use of the cloud.
If you’re not already convinced, here are some of the benefits of cloud computing:
•	 Reduced costs: Working in the cloud means you have no requirement for in-house 
servers to host other computers on the network. This reduces your ownership, 
maintenance and insurance costs.
•	 Real-time data: You can access accurate and timely reports, which can assist with 
informed decision-making.
•	 Productivity gains: The time taken to respond to issues is minimised because data 
can be accessed wherever you can access the internet. Integration features mean 
(continued)

(continued)
you don’t need to re-key data, because fields are matched and flow from one area 
to another. You also don’t need to install or upgrade anything on your computer.
•	 No platform issues: Mac or PC? You no longer have any need to worry what plat-
form you’re working on as you access the internet via an internet browser.
•	 Collaboration: Multiple users from around the globe can simultaneously log in and 
view the same information, depending on their access levels. Yes, you can review 
business reports while cruising the Nile!
•	 Flexibility: Applications can evolve to suit business needs.
•	 Reasonable pricing: Many applications have reasonably priced packages available, 
and offer options to suit different business requirements, from the micro through 
to the enterprise business. You can start with a low-cost package and, as you grow 
your business, move to a bigger package.
•	 Reliable data backups: Data is stored in the cloud. If your computer crashes, or 
the business floods or is affected by fire, you can still access your data via the inter-
net. Note: Backups of your own important data should still be made — just think of 
the cloud backups as a trapeze you can grab. In a way (and with slightly mixed met-
aphors!), it’s a double safety net! In the case of Xero, you can manually download 
the complete General Ledger from Xero (see Chapter 9) or use an automated back-
up solution like LedgerBackUp (www.ledgerbackup.com — see Chapter 16 for 
more on add-ons).
•	 Cool factor: Getting out your iPhone after enjoying a coffee meeting with a client, 
taking a photo of a receipt and uploading it straight to your accounting package as 
an expense claim is pretty darn cool!
As with everything, you should be aware of some aspects of cloud computing. Here are 
some of the concerns of cloud computing:
•	 Availability of internet access: Access to the cloud is dependent on internet 
access. No, or slow, internet access may affect your decision to work in the cloud.
•	 Data storage questions: Because data can be stored anywhere in the world, you 
need clear information on its actual location. What country, and under what juris-
diction, is the data stored in? Note: Xero data is stored with Amazon Web Services 
in the United States, a leading hosting provider. The United States has sensible laws 
governing the protection and confidentiality of data.
•	 Longevity: Will the software provider be around to look after your data forever 
(well, as long as you need it to be, at least)?

Exploring Xero’s Different Editions
Xero offers a number of different editions. As your business grows, you can 
upgrade packages, or, if you decide you no longer need a larger package, after 
30 days you can downgrade.
The editions come in starter, standard and premium packages. The uses and fea-
tures of each package are as follows:
»
» Starter: The starter package is suited to the micro or start-up business, with 
limited transactions. This package allows you to send and receive 5 invoices 
per month and reconcile 20 bank statement lines per month.
»
» Standard: The standard package is suited to the typical small business. Using 
this package, you can send and receive hundreds of invoices per month, and 
reconcile hundreds of bank statement lines per week.
»
» Premium: This package size grows in relation to the number of employees to 
be processed through the system. As well as being able to send and receive 
hundreds of invoices per month and reconcile hundreds of bank statement 
lines per week, using the premium package you also have multi-currency 
capabilities, payroll direct deposit (in the US version), and auto-superannuation 
(in the Australian version).
Depending on the region, all three packages include payroll, which may be 
included in the package price or priced per employee. Check your region’s Xero 
package offerings for more information.
•	 Security: What security is being maintained over business data? Note: The security 
encryption of Xero is equivalent to that used by online banking. If you’re happy to 
use online banking, you should be happy to use Xero. All users require unique 
­passwords to access the application, and Xero logs users out after 60 minutes of 
inactivity. Xero also includes the option of two-step authentication.
•	 Ownership: Who has ownership of your data in the cloud? Note: With Xero, the 
direct subscriber to Xero owns the data.
Everything you do in business incurs some risk, including the way you operate. If you 
consider the risks of your own computer crashing, or being susceptible to a virus, 
floods, theft or fires, you may be far better off putting your faith in an organisation that 
has the infrastructure and systems in place to better protect and store your data.

14      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
All editions allow you to access your files anywhere online, invite unlimited users, 
use live bank feeds and to cancel online at any time.
All editions also include the following features:
»
» Automatic online backups
»
» Demo company files so you can explore options
»
» A free trial version before you sign up (only available if you sign up to Xero 
directly, rather than through an accountant or bookkeeper)
»
» No set-up fees, upgrade requirements or contracts
»
» Unlimited customer support
Depending on the regional option you select, you may have access to additional 
features in Xero. For example:
»
» The Australian version includes a robust in-built payroll, Activity statements 
(Chapters 6 and 10), and the premium version allows for automated superan-
nuation payments.
»
» The US version includes 1099 and GAAP compliance, as well as integration 
with the Track1099 e-filing and preparation tools (Chapter 10), and the ability 
to produce checks (Chapter 7).
»
» The New Zealand version includes GST Return functionality.
»
» The UK version includes VAT Returns, VAT Audit Returns and online filing 
facilities with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) (Chapter 10).
CHECKING THE COMPANY HISTORY PAGES
New Zealand is not only famous for rugby, spectacular scenery and hobbits scurrying 
around Middle-earth. Somewhere along the way, it has also become the incubator and 
launch pad for many digital enterprises, including Xero. Founders Hamish Edwards and 
Rod Drury first met in 2003, when Hamish was virtual CFO of Rod’s software company. 
In April 2006 co-founder Craig Walker joined the team. (His offer from Drury went 
something along the lines of ‘I’m doing my next big thing — you in? You start on 
Monday’.) Frustrated by clunky desktop-based accounting packages, technology evange-
list Drury wanted more. On 1 May 2006, Walker started writing code on what would 
become the first version of the yet to be named Xero. The fourth co-founder, Philip 
Fierlinger, joined in July 2006. By this time, accounting expertise plus technological

Homepage: Checking Out the Dashboard
Once you have set up your Xero account (see Chapters 2 and 3), you just have to 
log into your account, using your password, to access the My Xero homepage — 
what Xero calls the Dashboard. Across the top of the dashboard is the menu bar for 
quick access to all areas of Xero.
Here’s a quick overview of the different parts of the main dashboard’s menu bar:
»
» Dashboard: Provides an overview of bank, credit card and online payment 
gateway accounts; an Account Watchlist; and a summary of invoices owed to 
you, bills you need to pay, expense claims, and total cash in and out.
»
» Accounts: Shows bank account details, sales (Chapter 6), purchases 
(Chapter 7), pay run (Global edition only), inventory (Chapter 13), expense 
claims (Chapter 7) and fixed assets (Chapter 14).
»
» Payroll: Australian, New Zealand, United Kingdom and US users can access 
advanced payroll features.
»
» Reports: Access reports and the Budget Manager features (Chapter 12).
­ingenuity plus business acumen equalled Xero, revolutionising and simplifying how 
business owners run a business.
Discarding existing models, Edwards, Drury, Walker and Fierlinger started clean and 
built a single ledger online accounting system that enabled integration with bank feeds.
Xero has attracted an impressive board line-up, including Craig Winkler, co-founder of 
MYOB accounting software, and Peter Theil, co-founder of PayPal. The company has 
also hired a skilled in-house team and attracted a symphony of passionate ambassa-
dors to rally around their product. Jump on social media and you’re likely to find sugges-
tions and discussions, as many people offer ideas about what features they love and 
what they would like to see made available in Xero.
Due to the online nature of the software, no longer do users need to wait for annual 
updates. Online updates are implemented by head office in the wee hours of the morn-
ing. Businesses don’t need to waste time installing updates and upgrading files — they 
simply start their day accessing new features.
Xero is listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange and Australian Securities Exchange. It 
is available globally and has local teams in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, 
Asia, South Africa and Europe.

» Adviser: Can only be seen by users with Adviser access (see Chapter 4 for 
more on setting access for users).

» Contacts: Shows customers, suppliers and employees added as Contacts 
(Chapter 5) and a list-building feature called Smart Lists.
»
» Settings: Outlines general settings (Chapter 2).
Understanding Your Team’s Needs
‘Avast belay, yo ho, heave ho, A-pirating we go, And if we’re parted by a shot, 
We’re sure to meet below!’ . . . and that was my one line in the Singaporean pan-
tomime production of Peter Pan. In the theatre, everyone in the crew has a defined 
role, yet each role is interdependent on the other players. If the lighting guy had 
missed his cue, we would have been in darkness; if the sound guy flicked the 
wrong switch, we might not have been able to hear; and if I had forgotten my one 
line — well, the audience may well have wanted their money back! We supported 
each other, we improvised and we covered each other’s backs, for the greater good 
of the production and the audience’s enjoyment.
Xero is an innovative and time-saving product — but it doesn’t work on its own. 
If you set up and activate all your business bank accounts and maybe set up a few 
coding rules (see Chapter 4), you can save yourself a lot of time. But don’t think 
you can then ignore Xero and return in 12 months’ time to find everything done 
for you! If you try this approach, what you’re likely to have is lots and lots of 
pieces of a puzzle, waiting to be reviewed, coded and reconciled.
The Xero file needs to be processed on a regular basis, with reports prepared, taxes 
submitted, and data extracted to help with business decisions. Ideally, you need to 
establish a supportive Xero advisory team that’s focused on helping your business 
achieve its goals. The collaborative and transparent nature of Xero lends itself to 
working with this team of specialists, who in their own way support each other 
and your business. Your team might include:
»
» Accountants. Your accountant works from the top of your business down, 
looking at the overall business. Just like you can go to different types of 
doctors, you can also access different types of accountants for the health of 
your business:
•	 Tax accountants assist businesses in meeting compliance obligations, 
preparing financial statements and minimising taxation. Tax accountants 
can review reports and provide rolling tax advice during the year. They can 

CHAPTER 1  Getting to Know Xero      17
maintain the Fixed Asset Register and prepare depreciation schedules 
from within the accounts. Tax accountants can enter the end of financial 
year journals directly into Xero’s single ledger and confirm that your 
financial reports from Xero match your prepared financial reports.
•	 Management accountants assist businesses with strategic planning, 
business growth, cash flow budgeting and financial analysis. Management 
accountants assist in developing a useful chart of accounts — customising 
report layouts so information is presented in an informative manner — 
and issue monthly management reports. Using graphs, words and 
numbers, a management accountant can help you understand how the 
business is tracking and what can be done to improve it.
»
» Bookkeepers. They work from the bottom of businesses up, entrenched in 
the detail, assisting with data entry, reconciling reports, and following up with 
accounts payable and accounts receivable. Bookkeepers can identify compli-
cated transactions, such as a fixed asset purchase, and flag them for the tax 
accountant to review and approve.
Your bookkeeper may assist with the preparation of consumer tax reporting 
where relevant.
»
» Xero partner. Investing in up-front support from a Xero implementation 
specialist gets you started faster and ensures you’re heading in the correct 
direction. You may work with a few different Xero experts:
•	 Advisers gather your business data and help you efficiently and effectively 
set up your Xero data file. They also provide ongoing support and guidance 
on how to use Xero.
•	 Cloud integrators are able to suggest and install various add-on solutions 
that can benefit your business, and they provide you with ongoing IT 
support.
•	 Trainers instruct you in using Xero within your business environment.
You and your team need to clearly communicate with each other, maintain open 
relationships and respect each other, and you each need to understand the inter-
dependent nature of each other’s role. Avoid having people on your team who are 
always ready to lay the blame on other parties — it’s unproductive and drains 
resources. Working at the coal face of small business, I’m sometimes concerned 
by the animosity and disrespect some people show one another.
Here’s how each member of your team can use Xero to get along:
»
» The management accountant asks the bookkeeper to code all transactions in 
Xero related to a particular project to a specified tracking option (see 
Chapter 12 for more on tracking).

18      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
»
» The bookkeeper uses Xero’s Discuss feature to ask the tax accountant for 
advice on how to code the purchase of computers (see Chapter 8 for more on 
the Discuss tab and Chapter 14 for more on fixed assets).
»
» The tax accountant advises all users of your Xero file to code any cost relating 
to entertainment to the entertainment expense code — clearly detailing what 
it was for and who was in attendance — so she can review expenses at the 
end of the period (see Chapter 11).
»
» The Xero implementation specialist provides training to all users to show 
them how to effectively and efficiently use Xero!
For many start-ups and micro businesses, the ‘team’ could mainly be one person 
wearing several hats — that is, the business owner may play many of the roles 
mentioned in the preceding paragraphs. Or you may need a number of people in 
your team to suit the nature of your business. Working with a team of specialists 
provides you with leverage and a depth of knowledge in the business that can 
facilitate business growth.
FINDING, AND KEEPING,  
A GREAT ACCOUNTANT
I hate group assignments. I’m sure it’s just a technique teachers use to minimise mark-
ing. I always seem to end up with someone utterly incompetent on my team who slows 
everything down, and I end up carrying this person through the assignment. I first expe-
rienced this while at university when, for one of my subjects, I was the leader of our 
computer programming group assignment. Our group met, decided on a plan of attack, 
divided up the work and arranged to meet up again so everyone could pass their work 
to me. I would then just have to compile it.
When the day came for everyone to submit their work, one of the team members — I’ll 
call her the stunned mullet, because her total lack of interest was all she contributed to 
group discussions — handed me her computer programming submission. It was a 
print-out with someone else’s name on it. I asked around and eventually found the 
actual author. I approached him and a great friendship formed. And now (not so many 
years later), he has the great honour of doing my taxes!
The benefits of having a great relationship with an accountant who knows and under-
stands your business are many. Accountants provide advice over myriad topics and can 
assist with:

CHAPTER 1  Getting to Know Xero      19
•	 Developing tax-minimisation strategies
•	 Formulating business goals
•	 Identifying suitable key performance indicators (KPIs)
•	 Keeping you abreast of changes to financial legislation that affect your business
•	 Preparing budgets and cash flow forecasts
•	 Providing specialist advice to suit your business circumstances
Once you’ve found a good one, your accountant can form an integral part of your busi-
ness advisory board. Developing a consultative, positive, practical and effective working 
relationship with a modern tax accountant is critical for your business’s ongoing success.
So how do you find a modern, savvy, actively involved accountant? Most are in high 
demand and many have closed books, so ask around your business networks for rec-
ommendations and introductions. A list of Xero-certified accountants can be found on 
the Xero website (www.xero.com/advisors). If you have a couple of options, take a 
look at the accountant’s website — if you’re using Xero cloud software, you want the 
accountant to be technically sophisticated and a decent website is a basic requirement.
Once you think you’re ready to meet with a possible accountant for your business, here 
are some aspects you can find out more about:
•	 Does the accountant have experience in the industry your business is within? Some 
businesses are a little complicated; for example, e-commerce, import, export, gam-
bling and wine businesses have specific idiosyncrasies. Is the accountant aware of 
them, or will it be a steep learning curve that you end up paying for?
•	 How long has the accountant been established?
•	 How many existing clients does the accountant have using Xero?
•	 How well does the accountant know Xero?
•	 How will you communicate with each other and how often? Will the accountant 
monitor your business and offer timely insights on a regular basis or as and when 
you need them? What suits your requirements?
•	 What are the fees?
•	 What services does the accountant offer?
•	 What qualifications does the accountant hold?
Above all, make sure you feel comfortable with your accountant. And once you’ve found 
one you can work with, keep that accountant close to your business.

20      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Integrating Xero into Your  
Strategic Planning
Strategic planning is the exercise of defining the vision for your business and 
developing goals to move forward and bridge the gap from where you currently 
are to where you want to be. As a small business owner, you may see undertaking 
strategic planning as daunting, overwhelming, time-consuming and unneces-
sary. But wait there! By utilising Xero and inviting your team to view transparent 
data, and ensuring the data entered into Xero is accurate, you’re in a better posi-
tion to understand where your business is at and what it can achieve.
Generating accurate, complete  
and timely data entry
I have a client who went on a cruise around the Greek Islands. While he lay on a 
deck chair eating dolmades and drinking ouzo, he reflected on one of his many 
businesses that imported electronics and sold them in Australia: Why was the 
business not making money? The cheap electronics had a significant profit mar-
gin applied to them, so why was the business running up losses? He considered 
winding up the business, but before he pulled the plug he called me in to review 
the records. I examined and corrected the custom invoices. I delved further and 
realised the bookkeeper had overwritten the purchase price and entered the exact 
same purchase and sales price. (Bizarre but true.) The reworked accounts improved 
the bottom line by a quarter of a million dollars!
Running a successful business involves continually making correct decisions. 
While no magical formula exists for always making the correct decisions, I do 
know the process needs guts, foresight and intuition — and correct, timely data. 
So you bring the guts, foresight and intuition and this book shows you how to 
generate accurate, complete and timely data in Xero!
Introducing Management Reporting and 
the analysis capabilities of Xero
An older accountant told me a story. He worked for a large organisation producing 
and distributing monthly management reports. A cheeky upstart joined the com-
pany, took his reports, added colour to them, turned them into graphs and every-
one loved them. Imagine that! Well, Xero is that cheeky upstart. Colour and graphs 
guide you around your business reports. Teeny red and green indicators scattered 

CHAPTER 1  Getting to Know Xero      21
across many reports alert you to be pleased or concerned with comparative move-
ments. Management Reports highlight cash movements, profitability, perfor-
mance and the position of the business. (See Chapter  12 for more on Xero’s 
Management Reports and the Budget Manager tool.)
Taking Advantage of Support Options
If you have any questions about Xero, hopefully the following chapters in this 
book can provide all the answers. But, if your problem is perhaps beyond the scope 
of this book, you do have other support options available. Xero offers an amazing 
amount of support material on its website, including training videos — go to www.
xero.com/training, www.xero.com/tv and www.community.xero.com to check 
them out. You can also email Xero support around the clock at support@xero.com 
or, from the top far-right of the dashboard, you can access email support by click-
ing on the question mark icon and, at the bottom of the drop-down menu, clicking 
Contact Xero Support.
ACCESSING XERO ON YOUR IPHONE
You can download the Xero Touch app from the App Store and use it on Apple and 
android mobile devices. Limited features that can be accessed via the mobile version 
include the following:
•	 A dashboard view of bank account balances
•	 Bank reconciliation
•	 Ability to create new invoices, and view draft, unpaid and overdue invoices (see 
Chapter 6)
•	 Ability to view contact details — and call contacts from your phone (see Chapter 5)
•	 Ability to submit receipts (see Chapter 7)
•	 Ability to upload files to the organisation’s Files inbox and attach files to receipts or 
invoices
You can access full Xero features on your mobile device via a browser at m.xero.com. 
It is ubercool that Xero can be accessed on your phone!

22      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Once signed up to Xero, you’re sent regular e-newsletters updating you with all 
the relevant news. When you’re logged onto Xero, a small envelope also appears 
at the very top of the screen. Clicking on the envelope displays messages from 
Xero  — informing you, for example, about feature updates and any bank feed 
issues. If you have an issue when reconciling your accounts, you can also make use 
of the Discuss tab to leave a message for your Xero Adviser (see Chapter 8 for more).
Access any support you need to help your business. For example, an IT specialist 
can ensure you’re accessing a high-speed internet connection. This may involve 
reviewing your existing network and your internet provider’s plan. Technology is 
rapidly advancing, so reviewing this set-up on a regular basis can improve 
productivity.
Using Xero in a Training Environment
Xero For Dummies is a comprehensive resource for any Xero training environment. 
At the time of writing, no Xero training platform is available, so if you want to 
organise a training session you need to establish your own live Xero training 
file — which is easy to do.
I recommend taking the following steps as you prepare for a workshop-style 
training session:
1.	 Set up a single Xero file.
See Chapter 2 for more on setting up a Xero file. This file can also be re-used 
for different training groups — though you may prefer to start with a fresh file 
each time.
2.	 Before you start the session, invite students in as Users to the file.
Make sure students have time to accept their access to the Xero organisation. 
Let them know that if they already have access to another Xero file, they 
should use that same email address and password. Also, remind students to 
bring their email address and password to the training session.
Remind users that they’re entering information into a shared training file, so 
they shouldn’t enter private information.
You can access sample data and lesson plans at www.heathersmithsmallbusiness.
com/XeroTM; the password to access these files is ‘Charlie’.

Getting Organised: 
Setting Up Xero from 
Scratch
C
ustomers of mine, a husband and wife partnership who run an electrical 
importing business out of their small apartment, recently confided to me 
that, prior to investing in their business accounting system, they were close 
to divorce. Signing up to Xero was such a relief. They now know who owes them 
money and who they owe money to. They understand how different areas in the 
business are tracking and are more informed when making decisions. They no 
longer lie in bed awake at night worrying or having protracted discussions about 
the business. They are in control. Who knew investing in an accounting system 
could buy you a peaceful night’s sleep and save your relationships?!
So what are you waiting for? This chapter provides everything you need to know 
to set yourself up on Xero and start organising your accounts. I cover assessing 
your system requirements and making sure you have all the necessary informa-
tion at your fingertips before you start. I help you work through the basic steps 
required when signing up and take you through the Chart of Accounts dashboard. 
Chapter 2

24      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
I provide some help on adding options for that all-important matter — getting 
paid — and give a quick run-through of your consumer tax options.
The instructions for the Xero set-up process covered in this chapter and the appear-
ance of Xero’s set-up wizard shown in the figures were correct at the time of writ-
ing. Because of the cloud-based nature of Xero, processes and screen designs can 
change at any time, but don’t worry. Even if you’re looking at something slightly 
different to the screenshots shown in this chapter, the basic principles behind the 
set-up process, and the information required to complete it, will be the same. If in 
any doubt, check out the Xero Help Centre for information on the latest updates.
How do you eat an elephant? One chunk at a time. If you need to take a break dur-
ing the Xero set-up process, the file stays in place, so you can return to it later on. 
Sometimes it can be easier to tackle one section of the set-up process, understand 
this area fully, sleep on it, and then move onto the next area.
Preparing for Set-Up
Before jumping straight in to signing up to Xero, getting yourself organised and 
checking you have everything you need is worthwhile.
Checking your browser and system 
­requirements
Xero is accessed on the internet, so you don’t need to worry about how working on 
a Mac, a PC or a mobile device may change performance, or whether you have 
enough memory or space to install software. You simply need access to the inter-
net! However, to ensure efficient and effective access to Xero online, including 
viewing graphical charts, you may need to install or update to the latest versions 
of certain products or tools, or change settings to support requirements.
At a bare minimum, here’s what you need to use or set up (in the order you need 
to look at them):
»
» Supported internet browser: Options include recent versions of Internet 
Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome and, if accessing via a mobile 
device, Opera Mini or the device’s default browser.
»
» Javascript: You can activate this in your browser (further help can be found at 
www.activatejavascript.org).

through your internet browser preferences or settings options.
SNAPPY TIPS TO MASTER YOUR BROWSER
To optimise your Xero work time, I offer here a few tips I’ve gathered along the way with 
regard to working with monitors and browsers.
Firstly, I recommend working with two desktop monitors side by side, with one monitor 
in landscape and one in portrait position. (That is, the whole monitor turned on its side, 
not just the page shown in portrait view.) Some pages in Xero are long, and having the 
whole screen in portrait position allows an extended view.
Secondly, because you’re accessing Xero via a web browser, you can also make use of 
the pretty nifty shortcuts your browser offers. Each browser type may use slightly 
­different names, but here are some of the more useful features you’re likely to have 
available:
•	 Duplicate. Click on the address bar of a web page you already have open, press 
Alt–Enter, and the same page opens in a different window or tab. This option, avail-
able on Firefox, Internet Explorer and Google Chrome, allows you to open a single 
Xero file and access different pages within it via many tabs across the browser — 
useful if you want to work in one area, such as reconciling, and you want to see 
how your work affects another area, such as the reports.
•	 Paste and Go. Once you’ve copied a hyperlink, open a new browser window or tab, 
right-click in the address field, and choose the option Paste and Go. You’re taken to 
the address without having to paste and then press enter — saving you one key 
stroke. This option is available on Firefox and Chrome, and labelled ‘Go to copied 
address’ in Internet Explorer.
•	 Refresh/Reload. To view updated Xero data if you or someone else is working in 
Xero on another screen, simply click the Refresh/Reload symbol. All browsers 
should offer the refresh option, usually around the end of the address bar.
Finally, if you want to guide someone to look at a particular area of Xero, you can copy 
the hyperlink from the address bar in the browser and email the hyperlink to the 
person. If they click on it while logged into the same Xero file, and as long as they have 
the appropriate user access, they will go directly to the particular area you referenced.

26      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
For optimal performance, consider the following:
»
» Install Adobe Flash player (available at get.adobe.com/flashplayer).
»
» On a regular basis, refresh the browser by clearing the cache and cookies. You 
can do this by deleting your browsing history or clearing website data through 
the browser settings.
»
» Install Skype, so contacts can be called via Xero (this is optional but allows you 
to make free or cheap phone calls — see Chapter 5 for more).
»
» If using the Firefox browser, turn off Firebug because it can slow access.
If you’ve checked your requirements and set your browser up correctly and Xero 
is still not loading properly, check that you can access the internet! Xero does 
require access to the internet to work, and no offline option is available.
Collecting your business data
You’re probably champing at the bit to start setting up your Xero file. Before you 
jump in, gather some data so you can easily access everything you need as you 
need it.
If you don’t know where to find any of the data required by Xero at set-up (or 
don’t know what it is), your accountant, lawyer or business adviser may be able to 
assist. If your business is new, you may not yet have all the required data, which 
is fine.
Collect all you can of the following:
»
» Bank account details
»
» Business logo
»
» Business type
»
» Chart of accounts
»
» Conversion date and balances — the date the accounting records start from 
and balances at that date
»
» Details of accounts payable and accounts receivable
»
» Display name (this is usually just the name people use to refer to your 
business — see the section ‘Organisation Settings’, later in this chapter, for 
more)
»
» Financial year end date

CHAPTER 2  Getting Organised: Setting Up Xero from Scratch      27
»
» Last invoice number
»
» Legal or trading name
»
» Organisation type
»
» Terms and conditions for payment
»
» Time zone details
Table 2-1 shows the additional information you may need to gather, based on the 
region your business is based in.

Getting started
Follow these steps to get started:
1.	 Go to the Xero homepage (www.xero.com) and click the Free Trial button.
The Sign Up window appears (shown in Figure 2-1).
2.	 Fill in your contact details and other required fields.
All contact details must be complete before proceeding.
You need access to the email address you enter on Xero’s Sign Up window to 
complete the process, so make sure you enter the email address you can 
access the easiest.
The Country field reflects your location. You have the opportunity to enter 
where the organisation pays taxes later.
3.	 Read the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy and, if you’re satisfied with 
them, check the box to indicate you accept them.
You can access the Terms of Use by clicking the link on the Sign Up window or 
at www.xero.com/about/terms. You must agree to the Terms of Use before 
proceeding.

CHAPTER 2  Getting Organised: Setting Up Xero from Scratch      29
4.	 Click the Get Started button.
This submits your sign-up details. Once you’ve completed the Sign Up page, 
you should receive an email from Xero with the subject heading ‘Confirm your 
email address’, with a hyperlink to enable you to activate your account.
Here’s how to activate your account:
1.	 Click the hyperlink in the email from Xero.
You’re taken to the Activate Your Account window (shown in Figure 2-2).
2.	 Create your password.
Remember to use the typical security protocols, such as combining upper and 
lower case letters and numbers. The password needs to be at least eight 
characters long and include a number.
3.	 Click the blue Activate Your Account button.
You’re taken through to the Xero Dashboard. As soon as you’ve activated your 
Xero account, you can set up your first organisation in Xero.
You’re taken through to the Add Your Organisation to Start Using Xero Now 
window (see Figure 2-3). (If you are using the global edition of Xero, this 
window may look a little different.) Enter the commonly used name of your 
business and select the country where the business is registered and pays 
business or company taxes. This may also affect the currency of your Xero 
subscription, which will currently be in NZD, AUD, GBP or USD.
FIGURE 2-2: 
The Activate Your 
Account window.

30      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
At the time of writing, Xero has customised solutions available for Australia, 
New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom. The Canadian 
version includes cheques, and there’s a global edition that covers everywhere 
else. By selecting the country where your business is registered to pay taxes in 
the Business Location field, you enable Xero to customise your package to suit 
your tax reporting needs. For example, it reflects the consumer tax require-
ments of the location, where a customisation option is available.
After you’ve selected a country, the base currency is defined as that of the 
country selected. A base currency is the default currency for all transactions 
created in Xero and the currency shown in reports. If down the track you 
realise you want an alternative base currency, you’ll need to redo your set-up. 
Additional currencies can be added to Xero if you’re using multi-currency 
options in the Xero Premium edition (see Chapter 15).
Some of the field options change when you select a country. You have the 
option to say you’re registered for GST or VAT where relevant, and, with some 
countries, you can set the financial year end and the base currency.
4.	 Enter the time zone you’re working in.
Selecting a time zone in Xero customises the date stamps, which is useful for 
maintaining an audit trail. Click on the drop-down menu and select the closest 
location to where the business is registered to pay tax. Remember: One setting 
governs all users, no matter where they’re located.
5.	 Enter the type of business you’re operating in the What does your 
organisation do? field.
Completing this field is optional. As you start to enter your business type, the 
field suggests options, which you can override if you need to.

CHAPTER 2  Getting Organised: Setting Up Xero from Scratch      31
For some countries, the Add Your Organisation window also allows you to 
convert your existing accounting solutions files into Xero. If you’re moving from 
another system, see Chapter 3 for further guidance.
When adding your business details, you can access the Xero Demo Company. 
This is always available and is an opportunity to explore and test a working file. 
Click the Try the Demo Company hyperlink to access it from this screen.
6.	 Choose to start a trial or jump right in and commit to purchasing a 
subscription with Xero now.
What you choose is up to you! Grab your credit card and work through the 
Purchase Now option, or test the waters first and click Start Trial. You can 
commit to purchasing a Xero subscription during the trial period.
7.	 If you opt for Buy Now, enter a promo code.
Promo codes mean you save money on your Xero subscription, and you 
usually have a few places where you can source one. Try contacting a Xero 
partner (like myself) or Xero sales directly at sales@xero.com.
Choosing your trial or subscription option opens the You’re All Ready To Go! 
window. The suggested default settings for the Chart of Accounts, Conversion 
Date and Financial Year End are listed. They can be changed at any time, and 
these topics are covered in the following sections.
8.	 Click the green OK button.
Clicking this button brings you to the Xero Dashboard. At the top of the screen 
is a Help block. Here, you can find a ‘Getting Started’ video. Click the Show 
More link to display a list of short-cuts to:
•	 Connect your bank feeds
•	 Add your organisation details to keep in touch with your customers
•	 Design custom themes for all the documents you send to clients (see Chapter 6)
•	 Get paid by your customers instantly by setting up payment services
•	 Invite your Adviser, or find one in the directory (see Chapter 4)
•	 Edit or import your chart of accounts
•	 Import the customers and suppliers you regularly transact with (see Chapter 5)
If you click through any of these links and enter data in the relevant sections, 
when you return to the Xero Dashboard you’ll see that the short-cut is ticked 
green, indicating that you’ve used the short-cut to enter data.
I explain each of these areas in this book, though you may find that these are 
explained in slightly different ways to the guidance offered in the Xero Help 
section. The important thing is that you find the best approach for you, and 
you use the help available as a guide.

32      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Organisation Settings
Business organisation details, including organisation name, type of business, 
contact details and contact links, can be entered in the Organisation Settings 
dashboard (Figure 2-4). In this section, I go through how to complete most of the 
elements on this dashboard.
1.	 To access the Organisation Settings dashboard, select Settings on the 
menu bar and then select General Settings. Under the Organisation 
heading, click Organisation Settings.
During the sign-up stage (refer to the preceding section), you may have already 
completed some of this information. The first part of the Organisation Settings 
dashboard is the Organisation Name & Type area.
FIGURE 2-4: 
The Organisation 
Settings 
dashboard.

www.allitebooks.com

CHAPTER 2  Getting Organised: Setting Up Xero from Scratch      33
2.	 Click the Display Name field (in the Organisation Name & Type area) and 
enter your business name.
Your business name is typically the name Joe Public would use to refer to your 
business, and this name is what appears within Xero.
3.	 Enter the legal/trading name of the business in the Legal/Trading Name 
field.
This is the name that appears on documents produced by Xero. It may be a 
long and clumsy name and may include terms like atf (as trustee for) or trading 
as. If you’re a sole trader, your legal or trading name may be the same as your 
display name. If you’re uncertain, check with the business adviser who set up 
your business structure.
4.	 Upload your logo.
The optimal size is 140 pixels by 140 pixels — a square image. The image type 
can be .jpg, .png or .gif.
5.	 Select the Organisation Type from the drop-down list of options.
The Organisation Type field is optional, and is for information purposes only. 
The selection makes no difference to the file set-up, and can be changed at any 
time. A plethora of choices is available, so if you’re uncertain, leave this field 
and check with your business adviser.
The What is your line of business? field may have been filled out during sign-up.
6.	 Enter your business’s registration number, as required in your region.
Australian users need to enter their Australian Business Number (ABN) and 
branch details (if they operate from more than one location). UK users need to 
enter their VAT Registration Number. New Zealand users need to enter their 
New Zealand Business Number. United States/Global users have space to 
enter a Business Registration Number, and United States users have space for 
an Employer Identification Number (EIN) if they need to record one.
The next part of the Organisation Settings dashboard is the Contact Details area 
and this is quite straightforward — simply enter the postal and physical addresses 
of your business.
Enter your postal address information in the Contact Details area of the Organisa-
tion Settings dashboard and click Copy Postal to copy the details to the Physical 
Address/Registered Address column. You can then amend as necessary.
Capitalising the Town and/or City entries in your postal and physical addresses 
ensures correspondence is properly delivered — making this another efficient 
business practice.

34      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
The final block of the Organisation Settings dashboard is the Social Links area. 
This enables you to connect with your customers via the online invoices that you 
send them — they can ‘like’ you on Facebook, tweet you on Twitter, connect with 
you on LinkedIn and/or join your circle on Google+.
Before adding links within Xero to all the social networking sites you’re active on, 
you may want to consider your business’s social media strategy. For instance, you 
may opt to only add links to a Facebook business page rather than share your per-
sonal details by adding a link to your personal Facebook page.
After adding social links, check that the links work — see Chapter 6, where you 
can explore online invoicing, for more details. (I did this recently and realised my 
links weren’t working and I had to correct them. Practising what I preach!)
Once you’ve entered your details in the Organisation Settings dashboard, click the 
green button on the bottom right labelled Save.
Financial Settings
Financial information about the business that may affect reporting parameters 
can be defined in the Financial Settings dashboard. At the sign-up stage, you indi-
cated where the business is registered to pay taxes (refer to the section ‘Getting 
started’, earlier in this chapter, for more).
Where your business is registered to pay tax affects the options available through 
the Financial Settings dashboard in Xero. If at all unsure, seek specialist advice for 
your own particular circumstances.
To access the Financial Settings dashboard after your initial set-up, select Set-
tings on the menu bar and then select General Settings. Under the Organisation 
heading, click Financial Settings.
The first field to complete in the Financial Settings window is the Financial Year 
End. This date is the annual date that your business financial reports are prepared 
to. In many businesses, the financial year end aligns with the income tax year end 
for the country the business pays tax in. Enter your business’s financial year end 
date in the first field and tab to the next field to enter the month.
Xero next asks you to choose the consumer tax options for your region (refer to 
Table 2-1 for the options that may apply). If in any doubt about how to complete 
this section, check with your accountant or Xero Adviser.
The next block is the Tax Defaults for Sales and Purchases block. From the drop-
down menu, you can choose from four options: Based on Last Sale, Tax Inclusive, 
Tax Exclusive, and No Tax.

CHAPTER 2  Getting Organised: Setting Up Xero from Scratch      35
UK users need to enter their BACS Service User Number/Owner ID if they create a 
file from Xero that banks use to facilitate bulk payments, otherwise known as 
batch payments; see Chapter 7 for more.
Lock dates prevent users from altering accounts prior to and inclusive of the set 
date. Xero has two lock date fields. Use the first lock date to lock down the previous 
period. Use the second lock date to lock down the previous financial year. To do 
this, go to the Period Lock Date drop-down menu, select the date, and click Save.
Once the first lock date has been set by an Adviser, only users with Adviser status 
in Xero can edit accounts prior to and inclusive of this date. The Xero Adviser can 
also change the period lock date if required. Once the second lock date has been set 
by an Adviser, no user can make changes up to and inclusive of the lock date. The 
Adviser can change either lock date.
The final field in the Financial Settings window is the Time Zone field, which you 
set up during the sign-up process. This should already be populated.
When you’re happy with the details you’ve entered, click the green Save button.
Understanding Bookkeeping Basics
The single most important part of setting up any accounting system is the chart of 
accounts — think of it as the backbone of the accounting system, because all trans-
actions are coded through these general ledger accounts. Don’t get confused — a 
bank account is a type of general ledger account, but not all ‘accounts’ are bank 
accounts. Getting your head around some bookkeeping basics before you set up 
your chart of accounts in Xero — so you can get them set up correctly from the 
start — is a good idea. Of course, if you feel you already have a good grasp of these 
bookkeeping basics, feel free to skip ahead to ‘Setting Up Your Chart of Accounts’, 
later in this chapter.
Setting up your chart of accounts to reflect business operations allows you to easily 
identify the performance of all areas. Let me give you an example. A customer asked 
me to review their profit and loss statement. On this statement, they had one single 
line for income: Consultancy, $2 million. Nice! Underneath the lonely income line 
were many lines of expenses — and expenses had been broken down to such detail 
I knew they had spent $300 on office flowers that year. Fortunately, the customer’s 
invoices were very detailed, so it was an easy exercise of defining different types of 
income accounts, reallocating them to invoices and — ta da! — the owners now had 
details of the different income streams generated by the business.

36      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Knowing the different ways the business was making money highlighted which 
streams were the strongest — for example, the owners could now identify that a 
steady stream of income was being generated from a support contract with a 
­customer who was guaranteed a 48-hour response time. They promoted this 
s­upport-style contract to other customers and — you guessed it — a few took 
them up. This generated additional regular income for the business, with minimal 
extra effort on their behalf.
Working out how account types  
affect your reports
Each element of the chart of accounts, known as a general ledger account, is allo-
cated an account type, and the account type that’s allocated affects how the infor-
mation is grouped on financial reports. Figure  2-5 shows where the different 
account types are grouped on two popular reports: The Profit and Loss Statement, 
and the Balance Sheet.
Depending on how you set up your accounts, not a lot of difference may exist 
between some of the account types. Fixed Assets and Non-Current Assets, for 
example, could be deemed the same. Or you could have Fixed Assets defined as 
representing an asset with a medium life span and Non-Current Assets as an asset 
with a long life span.
FIGURE 2-5:

types are 
grouped on your 
reports.

CHAPTER 2  Getting Organised: Setting Up Xero from Scratch      37
The following sections provide a guide to the different account types. Grab a pad 
and pencil and, as you read through the lists, jot down how they apply to your own 
business, decide your interpretation and stay consistent.
Assets
Assets cover the following:
»
» Current Assets: Items owned by the business for less than 12 months — for 
example, accounts receivable, and inventory. If Xero is integrated with an 
inventory management solution, opt to set up the inventory against a current 
asset type rather than an inventory-type asset. This gives you more flexibility; 
for example, it allows you to create a manual journal against the account. 
Inventory may reflect the value of raw materials, work-in-process goods and 
completely finished goods.
»
» Inventory: The value of tracked inventory items on hand.
»
» Prepayments: Payments made in advance — for example, rent paid in 
advance.
»
» Bank Accounts: Accounts held at financial institutions. This includes credit 
card accounts, which would typically be classified as a current liability; 
however, in order to activate a bank feed, a credit card account needs to be 
classified as a bank account in Xero.
Using Report Layouts customisation, you can list the credit card account with 
the current liabilities on your balance sheet (see Chapter 9 for more on 
customising your reports).
»
» Fixed Assets: Owned by the business for between one and five years — for 
example, computer equipment.
»
» Non-Current Assets: Owned by the business for over a year — for example, 
motor vehicles, office equipment, furniture and fittings.
Liabilities
Liabilities cover the following:
»
» Current Liabilities: Monies owed by the business, to be paid back within 
12 months — for example, accounts payable.
»
» Liabilities: Monies owed by the business, to be paid back within one to 
five years — for example, car loans.
»
» Non-Current Liabilities: Monies owed by the business, to be paid back after 
a year — for example, a mortgage on the building premises.

38      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Equity
Equity covers the net worth of the business to the owner. As seen on the Balance 
Sheet, this is the assets minus the liabilities.
Revenue
Revenue covers the following:
»
» Revenue: Income other than sales.
»
» Sales: Monies earned from business operations.
»
» Other Income: Income not related to the operations of the income — for 
example, bank interest.
See the section ‘Developing your own chart of accounts’, later in this chapter, for 
more on how different income streams can be reflected in revenue accounts within 
your Xero Chart of Accounts.
Expenses
Expenses covers the following:
»
» Direct costs: Costs incurred in providing goods or services, inclusive of freight —  
for example, purchase of stock.
»
» Expenses: Costs associated with running the business — for example, 
telephone charges.
»
» Depreciation: The allocation of the value of capital assets to expenses, over the 
life of the assets — for example, depreciation on cars owned by the business.
»
» Overheads: Fixed costs associated with running the business — for 
example, rent.
See the following section for more on how direct costs relating to specific income 
streams can be reflected in expense accounts within your Chart of Accounts in Xero.
Creating a chart of accounts that  
works for you
By taking the time to define what you want to know, you can easily generate use-
ful information. Account types, excluding bank, credit card and online payment 
methods, can be altered at any time. So if you have been working with a file and 
realise you should make some changes, you can!

CHAPTER 2  Getting Organised: Setting Up Xero from Scratch      39
This section covers some points you can take into consideration when developing 
a suitable chart of accounts for your business.
Measure what matters
Think about the kind of information you need to help you understand how the 
business is performing and so improve your decision-making process. Can you 
easily identify specific income streams and the direct costs of products or services 
you provide relating to these separate income streams? This information allows 
you to identify gross profit per product or service on the fly. Understanding what 
area of your business is more profitable (and perhaps what area isn’t bringing in 
the cash) makes it easier to decide where energies and such costs as advertising 
budgets should be focused.
Keep it simple
The primary purpose of management reports is to help managers and business 
owners manage the business. Use language and terminology you understand. 
Override technical accounting speak and replace it with lingo that helps internal 
staff quickly understand and digest information. If you don’t like the term accounts 
receivable, for example, change it to dudes who owe us money. I promise the account-
ing secret police won’t come knocking at your door.
If business reports are required for outside bodies, you can extract the reports 
from Xero and easily reword any of the more individual terms you’ve used to suit 
the required accounting lingo. You, and any of your internal staff, being able to 
quickly view reports and understand what they mean on a day-to-day basis is 
more important for your business success.
Less is more
If, somewhere during the process, account lines have been generated that you are 
unlikely to use in the next couple of years, remove them. Adding new accounts is 
quick and easy — so, for example, don’t hang on to the Building Premises account 
line in hope that one day you may own your building. Live for today and develop a 
streamlined chart of accounts that suits your business now. Ask yourself whether 
the way you’ve split income or expense streams is really useful. Will this help you 
make efficient and effective decisions in your business?
Developing your own chart of accounts
When it comes to developing a chart of accounts, I like to start with a blank canvas, 
work out the essentials, and allow the chart to organically grow with the business. 

40      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Adding new accounts as you’re developing the business is easy — so don’t feel 
compelled to do it all now!
Speak with your accountant and ask if she has a preferred chart of accounts. I 
encourage all my clients to speak with their own tax accountant before developing 
a customised chart of accounts with them.
In this section, I share a few simple methods I use when I work with customers on 
developing a useful chart of accounts. Note: If your business is relatively straight-
forward, the insight you need about different income streams and the direct costs 
associated with these may be generated by simply using Xero’s Tracking features. 
(See Chapter 12 for more on Tracking in Xero.)
Looking at income and direct costs
Say I had a customer who needed to define a suitable chart of accounts for her 
catering business. I ask to look at her business card and work out the business 
involves the following services (in order of income generated):
»
» Full-service caterer
»
» Dinnerware and linens
»
» Chef and wait staff
»
» DJ
Of course, if she didn’t have a business card, I could ask to look at her website or 
other advertising material, but typically the back of a business card sums up the 
business — and, if it doesn’t, the conversation probably becomes about designing 
business cards to promote what the business does! Back on track, in this example 
the caterer clearly has four main streams of sales income, each with associated 
direct costs. These four income streams, and the direct costs associated with each 
stream, need to be reflected in the account types created within Xero (and so also 
reflected on Xero’s Chart of Accounts).
If, for example, the caterer wanted to understand the gross profit generated by 
offering the services of a DJ, in her chart of accounts she would allocate an account 
showing DJ sale income to account type Sale, and an account showing DJ direct cost to 
account type Direct Cost. To identify the gross profit, she can then deduct the direct 
cost of employing the DJ from the sales income generated through hiring the DJ.
Setting up a meaningful chart of accounts and ensuring data is allocated correctly 
means useful reports can be produced and analysed. Take the time to understand 
what your business does, and how allocating account types can affect your reports 
and enhance business decisions.

CHAPTER 2  Getting Organised: Setting Up Xero from Scratch      41
Understanding other expenses
Along with direct costs (refer to preceding section), three other expense account 
types are possible: Expense, Depreciation and Overhead. These represent the 
overall operating expenses for the business, and I like to break them up over four 
groups:
»
» Promotion: This relates to any advertising, marketing or promotional spend 
incurred by the business and is allocated to account type Expense. A catering 
business, for example, may include Facebook advertising and website 
design here.
»
» People: This relates to staff expenditure, including wages, amenities, and 
training advertising. Expenditure for full-time staff could be allocated to 
Overhead, while expenditure on casual staff is allocated to account type 
Expense. Continuing to use the catering business example, people expenses 
for this type of business may include wages, workers’ insurance and kitchen 
amenities.
»
» Place: This relates to all expenses associated with the location the business 
occupies and is allocated to account type Overhead. A catering business may 
include rent, electricity and rates here.
»
» Provisions: This relates to all the general expenses of the business and may 
be allocated to account type Expense, Depreciation or Overhead. For exam-
ple, a catering business may include telephone expenses, petrol expenses, 
depreciation, and subscriptions here.
Do not create promotion, people, place and provisions as account types. How these 
terms can be used is covered in Chapter 9, which discusses customising report 
templates.
Refer to the section ‘Working out how account types affect your reports’, earlier 
in this chapter, for details of what to include in the Equity, Assets and Liabilities 
section of your Chart of Accounts within Xero. See Chapter 9 for more on reporting 
outcomes.
Setting Up Your Chart of Accounts
In the following sections I take you through the two main ways of setting up your 
Chart of Accounts in Xero — using Xero’s default set-up, or customising it to 
meet your needs.

42      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
If in any doubt during this foundational step of setting up your Chart of Accounts, 
speak with some experts. A management accountant can help you ascertain what 
useful information can be generated from your business accounts, which in turn 
can assist in making business decisions. However, you should also speak with 
your tax accountant as she may have a default chart of accounts she prefers you to 
use. The fees you pay to your tax accountant may be significantly reduced if you 
use her suggested chart of accounts because your accountant will undertake less 
work during the annual tax preparation process.
Using Xero’s default Chart of Accounts
The Xero organisation includes a default Chart of Accounts. Xero’s default Chart 
of Accounts is perfectly suitable for simple straightforward businesses. If you 
choose not to use the default Chart of Accounts provided by Xero, you can import 
your own chart of accounts. Detailed information about converting from another 
accounting software system, including dealing with discrepancies, can be found in 
Chapter 3. Each of the options still allows you to edit the Chart of Accounts after-
wards (see the section ‘Adding a new account’ and ‘Deleting an account’ later in 
this chapter).
Australian and New Zealand users have the option of importing an existing chart 
of accounts file from Xero, MYOB or BankLink.
Interestingly, reports list accounts in alphabetical order, grouped by the 
account type.
Reporting within Xero isn’t driven by the account code structure. Selecting the 
appropriate account type and utilising reporting options is more important (see 
Chapter 9 for more).
Customising your chart of accounts
Here I take you through some ways you can customise either Xero’s default Chart 
of Accounts, or a chart of accounts you’ve imported.
Adding a new account
Your boss has just walked in and shared a brilliant way to monitor expenses in the 
business. He wants you to set up 30 individual accounts for all employees to ­monitor 
their taxi expenditure, another 30 accounts to monitor their telephone expenditure 
and so on. Frighteningly, this is a true story — but this is not how you want to 
monitor expenditure in the business! Your accounts list would become huge, unruly 
and unusable, and better ways are available to monitor that sort of expenditure (for 

CHAPTER 2  Getting Organised: Setting Up Xero from Scratch      43
example, a single expense account to track all taxi fare expenditure — see ­Chapter 12 
for more on Xero’s Tracking feature).
If you’re comfortable that it improves your reporting capabilities, here is how to 
add a new account:
1.	 From the dashboard, click on Settings on the menu bar, then General 
Settings. Under Organisation, click on Chart of Accounts.
The Chart of Accounts dashboard appears. If you scroll to the very bottom, you 
will notice this page defaults to show 200 items per page.
Note: If you’re using the set-up wizard and have moved to this step after 
inviting users, you simply start at the next step. (For more on the set-up wizard, 
refer to ‘Working through the Set-Up Guide’, earlier in this chapter.)
2.	 Click on the Add Account button on the top-left side.
The Add New Account window opens (see Figure 2-6).
3.	 Click in the Account Type field.
Refer to the section ‘Working out how account types affect your reports’, earlier 
in this chapter, for guidance on the appropriate account type to select. Adding 
a bank, credit card and online payment option account is covered in the section 
‘Adding Ways to Get Paid’, later in this chapter.

Account window.

44      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
4.	 Click the Code field and enter the identifying code you want to associate 
with the account.
The unique code can be alpha-numeric, up to ten characters long, and can 
include decimals and symbols if required. Once you start using Xero, however, 
you tend to rely on the account name rather than the number because Xero 
easily recognises these names and can suggest matching account names as 
soon as you start typing in the field.
5.	 Click the Name field and enter the account name.
This is your business, so don’t worry about using fancy accounting terminology —  
use words you know. For example, a customer of mine once asked why her accoun-
tant listed her office pot plants on the balance sheet. The accountant had used the 
term plant, referring to the building premises. Office pot plants, the garden variety, 
are unlikely to be listed on your balance sheet, but if the term (or any other) con-
fuses you, use another.
6.	 Click the Description field and enter any relevant information.
This field is useful for additional explanatory notes about the account, such as 
what should be coded here — an example could be a note that the account 
should include all overseas travel expenses, including flights. This field is 
optional.
7.	 Review the suggested tax setting.
Xero autofills a default tax setting when you select the Account Type. This 
setting can be overridden, so make sure it suits the account you’re creating. 
(See the section ‘Tax Rates’, later in this chapter, for help with selecting the 
correct tax rate.)
8.	 Check the box beside Show on Dashboard Watchlist (if desired).
The Account Watchlist is on the top-right corner of the Xero Dashboard. Select 
accounts you want to closely monitor to appear here, like Sales, Office 
Expenses and clearing accounts.
Only select about five accounts to appear on your Accounts Watchlist —  
otherwise, information overload occurs and the area loses its benefit.
9.	 Check the box beside Show in Expense Claims (if desired).
Checking this box allows the account to be selected when processing expense 
claims. This can be utilised to restrict what staff can allocate to an expense 
claim. (See Chapter 7 for more on expense claims.)

CHAPTER 2  Getting Organised: Setting Up Xero from Scratch      45
10.	Check the box beside Enable Payments To This Account (if desired).
Checking this box enables payments to be receipted into the account. Bank, 
credit card and online payment option accounts are automatically available as 
accounts into which you can receive money, but this option enables additional 
accounts to be available.
11.	Click the green Save button.
This saves the settings you have entered, but the account can be edited 
afterwards if necessary.
Deleting an account
Maybe you’ve realised that you have some accounts you never use. Streamline and 
simplify your Chart of Accounts, and permanently delete the ones you never use!
Here is how to delete an account:
1.	 From the menu bar, click on Settings → General Settings, then under 
Organisation click on Chart of Accounts.
The Chart of Accounts dashboard appears.
2.	 Check the box on the left of the account you want to delete, and click the 
red Delete button at the top of the list of accounts.
A confirmation window appears asking you to confirm you really want to 
delete this account. Once confirmed, this process can’t be undone, so make 
sure this is the correct account.
Some accounts can’t be deleted. If you’re trying to delete such an account, Xero 
automatically switches the process to the archive option (see following section).
3.	 Click the green OK button.
This removes the account from your active accounts list.
HANDLING YOUR CASH
Ideally, all business transactions should go through business bank accounts; however, 
the reality is that sometimes this doesn’t happen. To monitor personal spending on 
behalf of the business, or through the business, set up an owner’s loan account or a 
petty cash account. Select the Enable Payments option to enable recognition of busi-
ness cash transactions. Also, show these accounts on the Dashboard Watchlist to moni-
tor spending. (Refer to the earlier section ‘Adding a new account’ for more on how to 
select these options or settings.)

46      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Archiving an account
Maybe you’ve realised that you have some accounts you never use. If so, it’s time 
to streamline and simplify your Chart of Accounts, and archive the ones you never 
use (while keeping them in a retrievable format!). If you’re feeling nervous about 
permanently deleting an account, archiving an account so it’s stored in a retriev-
able format is the option for you!
To archive an account, follow these steps:
1.	 From the menu bar, click on Settings → General Settings, and then under 
Organisation click on Chart of Accounts.
The Chart of Accounts dashboard appears. Ensure the account balance is zero 
before you try to archive the account.
2.	 Check the box on the left side of the account you want to archive and 
click the blue Archive button.
A confirmation window appears notifying you that you’ve selected an account 
to be archived. It also lets you know that the account will be removed from any 
contacts who are using it as a default sales or purchases account. After you 
click Confirm, the account appears under the archive tab.
3.	 Click the green OK button.
This removes the account from your active accounts list.
Putting Your Accounts into Practice
The following sections take you through some practical aspects you may need to 
go through once you have the main aspects of your accounts set up — conversion 
balances, comparative balances and historical invoices.
Checking your conversion balances
Conversion balances are the account balances as at the conversion date, when you 
start using Xero. Conversion balances follow basic accounting principles in that 
the debits need to equal the credits. A simple conversion balance of a new start-up 
business recognises company shares and the value of those shares as follows:
Cash
DR $2
Shares in Company
CR $2

CHAPTER 2  Getting Organised: Setting Up Xero from Scratch      47
This entry is reflected in Figure 2-7, which shows the Conversion Balances dash-
board. If the business has been operational, the conversion balances are more 
detailed. If accounts haven’t been locked, users with Standard or Adviser status 
can save conversion balances — but if you’re at all unsure, engage an expert on 
your Xero support team to enter the conversion balance. Even if you don’t have all 
this information, you can start entering some now — any amount that doesn’t 
balance appears as an adjustment (called a Historical Adjustment in your Balance 
Sheet — or what those in the industry jokingly refer to as a hysterical adjustment!). 
Ask your accountant for the conversion balances or obtain a copy of your Trial 
Balance as at the date of conversion. The Trial Balance provides details of the bal-
ances of all the general ledger accounts.
Note: If you’re using the set-up wizard, Account Balances, which includes conver-
sion balances, is the window you’ll be taken to after you’ve set up your Chart of 
Accounts. However, entering and correcting conversion balances is likely some-
thing you’ll prefer to come back to after setting up the main aspects of your 
accounts, so the following steps also outline how to access the Conversion Bal-
ances dashboard after set-up.
To access the Conversion Balances dashboard, follow these steps:
1.	 Click Settings on the menu bar, select General Settings and under the 
heading Organisation and select Conversion Balances.
The Conversion Balances dashboard appears.
If you’re a brave soul and are still working through the set-up wizard, you’ll be 
taken to the next step.
FIGURE 2-7:

Balances 
dashboard.

48      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
2.	 Click the Conversion Date button and enter the relevant date.
If you’re working in the set-up wizard, click the green Next button.
If you were starting as at 1 July, the conversion month would be July, and you 
need to select the relevant Year.
Make sure you’re really comfortable with the conversion date you select. It can 
be changed, but doing so is a bit of a hassle and you may need a consultant to 
assist you.
Note: An added incentive of setting the conversion date for the start of the 
financial year is you have the opportunity to include comparative balances, 
because the balances are typically easy to access from financial reports 
prepared by you or your accountant. (See ‘Adding comparative balances’, later 
in this chapter, for more.)
3.	 Click on the blue Show All Accounts hyperlink and carefully enter the 
balances.
Show all accounts is written in very tiny letters beside the button Add a New Line.
Make sure you have a list of what all the account balances are and only enter 
positive balances. For example, a bank account’s ledger balance is typically 
debit in nature; however, if the balance is overdrawn, enter the balance in the 
credit column. Once all balances have been entered the debit and credit 
columns should equal, with the difference (if any) left over in the adjustments 
column. Keep in mind that your accountant can come back and update these 
balances at a later date if you don’t have the complete information at hand.
ADJUSTING CONVERSION BALANCES 
FURTHER DOWN THE TRACK
If you’ve entered conversion balances and then realise a big hairy mistake was made in 
an earlier financial year, don’t stress — you can go back and change the conversion bal-
ances. First, however, you need to check with your tax accountant on how the error 
should be dealt with, and whether amended records need to be submitted to the tax 
office or allowed for in the current period.
Once you and your tax accountant have agreed on a course of action, you can go ahead 
and change the conversion balances. Sound scary? It’s easy-peasy — simply follow the 
steps outlined in the nearby section ‘Checking your conversion balances’.
Note: When making changes to existing conversion balances in Xero, you need to 
uncheck the box beside Lock Balances At . . . before you begin (refer to Step 4 in the 
nearby section ‘Checking your conversion balances’).

CHAPTER 2  Getting Organised: Setting Up Xero from Scratch      49
4.	 Check the box beside Lock Balances At. . . .
This ensures no-one accidentally changes balances; however, an Adviser can 
change them if necessary.
5.	 Click the green Save button.
If you’re working through the set-up wizard, click the green Next button.
If conversion balances contain a balance for either the accounts payable or 
accounts receivable account, the detail behind the balances needs to be 
entered (see the section ‘Entering historical invoices, bills and credit notes’, 
later in this chapter). If you’ve no accounts payable or accounts receivable 
balance, congratulations! The set-up is complete.
Adding comparative balances
If your business was in operation prior to moving to Xero, the previous full-year 
balances for all or selected lines of the chart of accounts can be entered into your 
Xero file through the Comparative Balances function. In other words, you can add 
in the balances for accounts within your chart of accounts from before you started 
in Xero, as at the end of the previous financial year. If the detailed history of your 
business isn’t already in Xero, utilising the Comparative Balances function is an 
opportunity to incorporate summary level historical data into your reporting.
Historical insights assist with understanding trends in data over time, which aids 
your future decision-making processes in your business.
Note: Adding in comparative balances is different from adding in historical invoices 
(covered in the following section). Comparative balances show the overall balance 
of a specific account as at the end of the financial year. Invoices show a specific 
transaction within an account.
Before attempting to add comparative balances, ensure a conversion date has been 
set in Xero — refer to the earlier section on ‘Checking your conversion balances’.
To enter the comparative balances of your accounts as they were before moving to 
Xero, follow these steps:
1.	 Click Settings on the menu bar, select General Settings, go to the 
Organisation heading and select Conversion Balances.
2.	 Click the + Add Comparative Balances button.
The Comparative Balances window appears, where the dates of the previous 
financial year appear in a new tab (see Figure 2-8).

50      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
3.	 Click on the blue Show All Accounts hyperlink and carefully enter the 
relevant historical balances for each account.
You can access these balances in the final chart of accounts you or your 
accountant would have prepared at the end of the previous financial year.
4.	 Click the green Save button.
Entering historical invoices,  
bills and credit notes
If an Accounts Receivable conversion balance was entered, after saving the con-
version balances, the Conversion Balances Sales Invoices dashboard appears. 
At the bottom right of the screen, the red text reads Balance Out By #; the amount 
is the Accounts Receivable conversion balance entered. The objective here is to 
enter the historical invoice and credit note details, reducing the balance to zero.
Grab the details for the outstanding sales and enter them using the Add Invoice 
button and Add Credit Note button. (See Chapter 6 for guidance on entering sales 
invoices and credit notes.) Any details you add can be edited by clicking on the 
relevant row, or deleted by clicking the cross at the far right. The transactions 
entered here can also be entered via the normal Sales dashboard (see Chapter 6), 
and you can receive payment against them just as you would a normal invoice.
FIGURE 2-8:

Balances window.

CHAPTER 2  Getting Organised: Setting Up Xero from Scratch      51
Once total Sales Invoices match total Accounts Receivable, the green text at the 
bottom of the balance reads Matched and the balance is zero. The opportunity to 
proceed to the next step is now available via the highlighted green Next button. 
Your balance must be zero before you’re able to proceed.
If an Accounts Payable conversion balance was entered, after matching the total 
Sales Invoices and the total Accounts Receivable balance, you’ve the opportunity 
to enter supplier bills and supplier credit notes via the Add Bill and Add Credit 
Note buttons. It’s the mirror image of the Conversion Balances Sales Invoices 
dashboard, and the goal is to match the total Accounts Payable balance. Once 
matched, click the green Next button. Hurrah! The conversion balances should 
now be saved and you can click the green Finish button.
In Australia, the term credit note was replaced with adjustment note in 2000 with 
the introduction of GST, but I think people generally understand what’s meant 
when the term credit note is used.
Adding Ways to Get Paid
Whatever sort of business you run, money transactions are likely to be a critical 
element of running the business. Bank accounts, credit cards and online payment 
facilities can be set up in Xero — the following sections show you how.
Setting up bank accounts
To access the area to add a bank account, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on Accounts on the dashboard menu bar, then Bank Accounts.
The Bank Accounts dashboard appears.
2.	 Click on the Add Bank Account button on the top-left side.
The Find Your Bank window opens.
3.	 Enter your business bank name in the Search for Your Bank . . . field.
The field suggests bank accounts that it recognises. Carefully select the matching 
bank. If your bank is there, hurrah! You should have access to automatic bank 
feeds. If, however, the bank isn’t recognised, try alternative names or abbrevia-
tions. If that still doesn’t work, transactions need to be manually imported. 
Manually importing bank statements is covered in Chapter 4.
Once you have selected the correct bank name, the Enter Your Bank Account 
Details window opens.

52      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
4.	 Click the Account Name field and enter the business bank account name.
When naming a bank account, suffix it with the last four digits of the bank 
account number for easy identification — for example, ABC Business x1234. 
When you refer to source documents like shopping receipts or bank state-
ments, they may include the last four digits of the account you paid from. This 
crosscheck allows for easy identification.
If the bank name is recognised, you may get an option to add an Account Type 
as well. Click in the field and select from the drop-down box.
The remaining fields, while similar, are customised to the country the Xero file 
was set up for, as shown in Table 2-2. Currency options are available in all Xero 
Premium packages, irrespective of their region. The Code field does not appear 
if you set up the bank account from the Bank Accounts screen.
5.	 Select the Account Number fields and enter the required details.
Some Australian banks utilise direct entry user identification when the 
business makes batch payments. If you’re in Australia and your bank uses 
these, Xero allows you to enter the Direct Entry User ID in the DE User ID field. 
When processing a payroll batch payment, a DE User ID field is a requirement. 
Enter the information and then check the self-balancing transaction option 
underneath. If you intend to make batch payments but you’re unsure whether 
your bank has a Direct Entry User ID associated with the account, just ask your 
account manager at your bank. Also check whether you need to include a 
self-balancing transaction in the ABA file. This field is optional — if unsure, 
leave it blank. (Batch payments are covered in Chapter 7.)
Multi-currency options are only available in the Premium version of Xero. Refer 
to Chapter 15 for guidance on setting up different currencies.
6.	 Select the currency that you’re working with in the Currency field (if 
required).
You only need to select the currency if you’re working in multiple currencies.

If you need to add another account with the same bank, click the + Add 
Another Bank Account hyperlink and return to Step 4.
7.	 Click the blue Continue button.
Once saved, the account appears on the Xero Dashboard. (Make sure you also 
set up bank feeds for your bank accounts — see Chapter 4 for more.)
Including credit cards
Credit cards enable short-term loans for your business. To set up a credit card 
account in Xero, follow these steps:
1.	 Follow steps 1 to 6, skipping Step 5, from the ‘Setting up bank accounts’ 
section.
2.	 Enter the last four digits of your credit card in the Credit Card Number field.
3.	 Click the blue Save button.
Once saved the account appears on the Xero Dashboard. (The next step in 
setting up credit card accounts is setting up your bank account feeds — see 
Chapter 4.)
Online payment options
Xero enables feeds from online payment gateways (currently only PayPal, but 
there will be other online payment gateways soon!). To set up a PayPal account in 
Xero, you need to have a Business or Premier PayPal account. If you do, follow 
these steps:
1.	 Click on Settings on the dashboard menu bar, then General Settings. 
Under Organisation, click on Chart of Accounts.
The Chart of Accounts dashboard appears.
2.	 Click in the Account Name field and enter the relevant information.
3.	 If you’re working with multi-currency, select the currency that you’re 
working with in the Currency field.
The PayPal account can accept payment in multiple currencies, but these only 
feed into Xero in a single currency. If you have multiple PayPal accounts 
operating in multiple currencies, you need to add each one to Xero.
Multi-currency options are only available in the Premium version of Xero. 
Further information can be found in Chapter 15.

54      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
4.	 Check the box to the left of the Set Up Automatic PayPal Import option.
The Add PayPal Account window expands to reveal further fields (shown in 
Figure 2-9).
5.	 Enter your PayPal email address in the PayPal Email field.
The PayPal email address is the address you use to log into your PayPal 
account.
6.	 Enter your conversion date in the date field next to the Specify a Start 
Date option.
Refer to the section ‘Checking your conversion balances’, earlier in this chapter, 
for more on conversion dates. Up to 30 days of transactions can be imported.
7.	 Click the green Save button.
Note: Once you’ve added PayPal as a payment option, you’re sent an Activate 
Your PayPal Account in Xero email. Keep this on file, because you need it when 
setting up live bank feeds for PayPal within Xero (see Chapter 4 for guidance 
on defining your PayPal settings to get the feed to work).

Account window.

CHAPTER 2  Getting Organised: Setting Up Xero from Scratch      55
If when you use PayPal the money automatically sweeps into or out of your bank 
account for every transaction, your PayPal account is likely directly linked with 
your bank account. (This means your PayPal account operates like a debit card. If 
you receive statements from your PayPal account, you’ve set it up so it operates 
more like a credit card.) If money automatically goes into and out of your account 
from PayPal, you probably don’t need to add your PayPal account to Xero — doing 
so means you’ll just be doubling up on entries.
Depending on how you have PayPal set up, if you have multiple currency feeds, 
they may convert to your base currency — or you may need to set up a PayPal 
account for each of them. It is an evolving process, and so if you have any queries, 
contact Xero Support directly about this.
Tax Rates
Unfortunately, complying with the relevant consumer tax reporting requirements 
for the country your business is based in can be a burden that takes your focus 
away from the importance of utilising management reports. But the reporting 
element is a necessary evil for many businesses. One of the big benefits of using 
an accounting system is that it can easily assist in allocating and calculating con-
sumer tax — so you can focus on the bigger picture.
Globally, consumer tax has many guises: Good and Services Tax (GST), Value Added 
Tax (VAT) and Sales Tax. The overriding principles are generally the same — if 
you’re required to collect consumer tax, it’s added to the goods and services that 
you sell and procure — but different treatments and applications exist between 
jurisdictions. The preset tax rates available in Xero by country are outlined in 
Table 2-3.
If necessary, additional tax rates can be added via the New Tax Rate button.
You need to check that the available tax rates suit your business. You’re ultimately 
responsible for what you report to the tax office in the country your business is 
based in. Seek specific advice for your circumstances. Although you can’t alter the 
tax rates of your bank, credit card or online payment accounts set up through 
Xero, you need to check that the other accounts in your Chart of Accounts are 
associated with the correct default tax rates. Again, seek specific advice for your 
circumstances.

US users can access a Sales Tax lookup option, to calculate and add tax automati-
cally to US-based customer invoices. This service is provided by Avalara: www.
avalara.com.
You don’t need to create an extra tax rate for tax treatments that you’re unsure of. 
When processing the transaction, simply leave the transaction unreconciled, click 
on the Discuss tab and enter your query — for example, I purchased this overseas 
and am not sure how to code it — and ask your Xero advisory team to assist.
If necessary, additional tax rates can be added via the New Tax Rate button. If you 
opt to use Xero’s Global version, you may need to set up additional tax rates to 
comply with the tax laws of the country your business is based in. For example,

consumer tax is different in each Canadian province, so if your business were 
based in Canada and selling to different Canadian provinces you would need to add 
multiple tax rates for each province.
To add a new tax rate, follow these steps:
1.	 From the main dashboard, click on Settings → General Settings → 
Organisation → Tax Rates, and then click the New Tax Rate button.
The Add New Tax Rate window opens (see Figure 2-10).
2.	 Click in the Tax Rate Display Name field and enter the relevant 
information.
For example, you could enter ‘Tax on Sales — Quebec’.
3.	 In the Tax Components fields, enter the Tax, select Compound (if rel-
evant), and then enter the actual tax rate as a percentage.
If an additional tax component is required — if, for example, the area is 
governed by both a federal and a state tax — repeat Step 3 and add another 
Tax Component.
4.	 Click the Save button.

Converting to Xero from 
Another System
I
f you’ve been maintaining business records in a non-computerised system 
(okay, I mean a shoebox) or a computerised format, you can move your data 
across to Xero. Changing accountants or changing accounting systems is a sig-
nificant business decision — but don’t let this stop you! Empower yourself and 
take responsibility for the project. This chapter outlines what is involved in con-
verting to Xero from another system. You can simply bring opening balances into 
Xero or you can go through a more complex and involved conversion process, 
where you import historical transactions into Xero. Converting to Xero is an 
opportunity to detox your data — cleaning and streamlining it — and customise 
your data to generate useful business information. Have a specialist on call and 
give the conversion a go!
In this chapter, I take you through some tips for converting to Xero from a non-
computerised system and from a computerised system, including some general 
guidance on working with CSV files and preparing your data for importing. I then 
take you through the specific processes for importing data into Xero, and cover 
some common issues that arise when turning off your old system.
Note: The process for exporting data is different for each accounting system. For-
tunately, Xero can connect you with services that can help you convert some 
accounting files to Xero. For more information, check out Xero’s conversion

services at www.xero.com/marketplace/app-function/s/conversions. It’s worth 
chatting to your Xero Adviser to find out what the current deals are.
Preparing to Import Data from  
a Non-Accounting Program
If you’ve been in business a while but don’t have an existing computerised 
accounting system, the next few sections are for you. I discuss how you can utilise 
your paper- and/or spreadsheet-based records to assist in moving to Xero.
Converting paper-based records
If your existing records are paper-based — and I mean anything from a shoebox 
through to comprehensive documentation — gather the records and identify what 
needs to be entered into Xero. Use the last confirmed trial balance, which may be 
from the last time an accountant prepared financial records, as a basis for your 
chart of accounts (see the section ‘Confirming the switchover date’, later in this 
chapter, for more). It is like piecing together a jigsaw puzzle — once you start 
entering data into Xero, records should fall into place easily.
Moving from paper records to a computerised system is labour-intensive. All that 
data entry! Only enter what needs to be entered — if you’ve a historical list of 
clients, for example, don’t feel like they all need to be entered; simply enter them 
on an as-needed basis.
An alternative to entering data yourself is an extracting solution like Receipt Bank, 
where scanned receipts are uploaded and analysed, and data is extracted and 
pushed into Xero. (Refer to Chapter 2 for more information on manually entering 
data into Xero, and see Chapter 16 for more on extracting solutions.)
Working with spreadsheets
If you maintain accounting records using spreadsheets, and are considering con-
verting to Xero, the process you undertake is dependent on your spreadsheet lay-
out. Assess what accounting information can be extracted from it. If the 
information is in a database format — for example, customers are listed in rows, 
with their details stretched out across columns  — you may be able to easily 
manipulate data so it can be imported into Xero using templates available through 
Xero (see the sections ‘Downloading Xero templates’ and ‘Preparing data for 
import’, later in this chapter, for more information).

CHAPTER 3  Converting to Xero from Another System      61
If, however, your spreadsheets have been maintained in a random fashion, trans-
forming them to a suitable layout for importing data into Xero may be 
time-consuming.
It may be that you need to manually enter data, following the guidelines provided 
in Chapter 2. Alternatively, you may be able to adopt a hybrid approach, importing 
some data and manually entering the remaining data.
Getting Ready to Convert from 
an Accounting Program
At Christmas, our extended family gather to celebrate the festive season, and one 
of the highlights is the Ray Cresswell jigsaw marathon. The first jigsaw puzzle 
comes out on Christmas Eve — this is a 200-piece puzzle with large pieces, which 
suits the beginners and the kids. The family gathers, the kids get involved, pieces 
of the puzzle are turned over, the corners are found, the border is formed, scenes 
are created, and the puzzle is completed. The next puzzle commences on Christ-
mas Day (in that space after the presents have been opened and the bucks fizz 
drunk, and before Christmas dinner is served). This puzzle has a few more pieces, 
and these pieces are a bit smaller, but our approach is exactly the same. This scene 
repeats over the next few days, until the biggest, toughest and meanest puzzle, 
with 2,000 teeny-tiny pieces, is unboxed. We gather, eager and well-prepared for 
the marathon challenge. Applying our well-practised approach, we tackle and 
conquer the puzzle. Success is ours!
Essentially, all accounting systems are the same as jigsaw puzzles  — you just 
need to work out where all the pieces are supposed to go. Accounting systems are 
simply databases, or lists (or pieces) of data in different tables. To convert between 
solutions, you just need to export the data lists from the original system, review 
the format of the data, and import the data into the new system — in this case, 
Xero. With a systematic approach, you can work through each stage of the 
process.
The first part of the conversion is setting up your file framework for the imported 
data. Once you’ve done this, the conversion process moves through the following 
stages, regardless of the system you’re converting from:
»
» Export data: Export available data from your previous accounting system and 
save it to your computer (see the section ‘Setting up file directories’, later in 
this chapter, for information on how to set up your files).

62      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
»
» Prepare data for importing: Use the conversion as an opportunity to tidy up 
your data lists and trim dead wood. Delete unused accounts and contacts that 
are no longer around. If historical data is imported, associated records, like 
contacts, can’t be edited or deleted — otherwise, the records won’t match. 
Save updated files in CSV text file format (see the section ‘Understanding the 
CSV file format’, later in this chapter, for more).
»
» Import/update data into Xero: The Xero file needs to be created before data 
can be imported into it. Work through Chapter 2 before embarking on this 
section. As some of the data you need to import is reliant on or linked to other 
data, you should also import/update data in the following order:
•	 Tax Rates (review and manually update existing rates if necessary — the 
tax rates cannot be imported)
•	 Chart of Accounts
•	 Contacts
•	 Inventory Items
•	 Sales Invoices
•	 Purchases Bills
•	 Bank Transactions
•	 Manual Journals
•	 Fixed Assets
»
» Review and manually clean up imported data where necessary: If 
erroneous data is imported in error, select it to be archived. (And then review 
the process to identify what went wrong.)
»
» Repeat until finished.
You can’t save a back-up of your Xero file prior to import. While this may seem a 
bit scary, in most processes you have the opportunity to review data before finally 
importing it.
Table 3-1 provides a conversion checklist, and includes example file names for 
exported and imported data.
The conversion from your existing computerised accounting system to Xero is an 
exciting and immensely satisfying challenge. In the following sections, I provide 
information about the conversion process that can be applied to all conversions, 
regardless of what system you’re converting from. Once data has been exported 
and prepared from your old accounting system, the process for importing that 
data into Xero is the same — see the section ‘Importing Data into Xero’, later in 
this chapter, for more.

CHAPTER 3  Converting to Xero from Another System      63
If you know Xero will be connected to another business solution, research how the 
add-on syncs with Xero and establish if you need to be aware of any peculiarities. 
For example, when the commercial property management solution Re-Leased 
syncs with Xero, your contacts’ information is pushed into Xero, so the optimal 
Xero–Re-Leased set-up involves entering your contacts’ details into Re-Leased 
first and not entering them into Xero, and so avoiding duplication of work. For 
more information on add-on solutions, see Chapter 16.
Getting ready to convert
Before starting a conversion, you need to prepare yourself to ensure the process 
runs smoothly and you stay organised. The areas you need to understand initially 
are how to set up your file directories and how to access Xero templates. The fol-
lowing sections take you through these areas.
Before starting your data conversion, work through Chapter 2 and create a Xero 
file the data can be imported into. When you get to the point where you’re ready 
to import your own chart of accounts, you can jump back to this chapter.

Setting up file directories
Lots of files are created and used during the conversion process. Keep track of 
them by creating a simple file directory system that works for you. For example, 
you could create a high-level file directory called ‘CONVERSION-BusinessName’ 
and three sub-folders called ‘DataReadyForImporting’ ‘ExportedData’ ‘XeroTem-
plates’. You can then save all files used during the conversion to the relevant 
subdirectory.
When working with virtual teams, using an online storage solution makes it easy 
for all members of the team to access the conversion files. Simply set up a specific 
online storage folder and save a link to the folder in the ‘CONVERSION-­
BusinessName’ file. Online storage options include Dropbox, Google Drive and 
SugarSync.
I tend not to add spaces to folder names because sometimes the spaces mean the 
folder names don’t work across platforms, and these procedures are to be applied 
universally. If you prefer to add spaces or use different names, feel free to; how-
ever, I have used space-free examples throughout this chapter.
Keeping a copy of the original and converted data files can be useful if you need to 
review data at a later date.
Downloading Xero templates
Xero has a number of downloadable templates to assist with converting your files. 
By entering data from the old accounting system into these templates, and match-
ing unaltered column headings, you can organise your data in a format that’s 
easily imported into Xero.
Access the Xero downloadable templates by following these steps:
1.	 From the Xero dashboard, click on the relevant directions for the data 
you need to download, as provided in Table 3-2.
For example, to access the Xero Contacts template from the Xero dashboard, 
click on Contacts → All Contacts.
2.	 Click the blue Import button for the required template and then on the 
Download Template File link.
3.	 Save the template to your file directory.
For example, you could save the template within your ‘XeroTemplates’ folder 
within the ‘CONVERSION-BusinessName’ folder.
4.	 Repeat the three preceding steps until you’ve downloaded all required 
templates.

CHAPTER 3  Converting to Xero from Another System      65
As well as using the downloadable template for bank statements, you can create 
your own Excel template for importing bank statement information. Before doing 
this, however, see Chapter 4, which covers exporting bank statement information 
from your actual bank account. To create a bank statement template, list the fol-
lowing bank statement fields at the top of an Excel spreadsheet as column head-
ers: Transaction Date, Transaction Amount, Payee, Description, Reference, 
Transaction Type, Cheque No., Account Code, Tax Type, Analysis Code and Region. 
Populate the Excel spreadsheet with the relevant data and save the file in a CSV 
(comma delimited, for PC users) format.
On the CSV downloaded templates, the asterisks (*) at the left of the column 
header name indicate the field is mandatory.
When preparing the data for importing, sit your two Excel files side by side and 
carefully copy the data from the original file into the Xero template file, to ensure 
you’re copying data across to the correct fields.
Don’t ever change the header row of the template file — it must remain unchanged 
for fields to align correctly during importing.
Converting exported CSV files into Excel
When working with data from different software solutions such as accounting 
programs, understanding and being able to navigate and manipulate CSV file for-
mats is useful, because this is a common file format. You can then import the CSV 
file into a spreadsheet program such as Excel, making data manipulation easier.

Understanding the CSV file format
CSV is an initialism for comma-separated values. CSV is a simple file format where 
data values are separated by commas — similar to in a spreadsheet, where data is 
separated into columns. Most programs (such as MYOB, Sage and QuickBooks) 
allow you to import and export files in CSV format. The CSV files can then be easily 
edited and, if fields are correctly matched, can be imported into Xero.
CSV files are deceptive! They look like Excel files. Check as you save them that 
you’re saving to .csv format, not .xls format.
Using the Excel Import Wizard to  
convert text files to CSV files
When extracting data from an existing system, extracting it in Excel or CSV format 
is desirable. If that’s not an option, you may be able to opt to extract files in text 
file format. When a text file is then opened in Microsoft Excel, the Excel Import 
Wizard automatically activates and takes you through an extraction process to 
show data in Excel.
To view the text files in spreadsheet format, follow these steps:
1.	 Open Microsoft Excel and go to File → Open to search in your file direc-
tory of saved files.
The file directory is shown in Figure 3-1. As shown at the bottom right of 
Figure 3-1, select the Text Files option from the drop-down menu to access the 
text files. (If the Text Files option isn’t selected, the files don’t display, even if 
they are in the folder.)
2.	 Select the required file and click Open.
The Text Import Wizard window (Step 1 of 3) appears (shown in Figure 3-2).
Did your heart just skip a beat?! Don’t be terrified! The Text Import Wizard 
looks a lot scarier than it really is.
3.	 Click Next.
The Text Import Wizard window (Step 2 of 3) appears (shown in Figure 3-3).
4.	 Check the Comma box.
5.	 Click Next and then Finish.
Voila! Your Excel spreadsheet is populated with data that hopefully makes 
some sense to you!

CHAPTER 3  Converting to Xero from Another System      67
Once you have the data in Excel, you can manipulate the way it’s presented so you 
can see everything more clearly. Simply select all the data in the spreadsheet by 
hovering over the top left corner block and clicking it. With the data range still 
highlighted, resize the columns by hovering over the column border and double 
clicking the double-sided arrow (see Figure 3-4). The columns and rows resize to 
fit the data contained within them. Now you can easily see and edit your data.

68      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Once satisfied with your data, save the file by selecting Save As. Clearly identify 
the file — for example, by renaming it <FILE>Import.csv. Ensure the Save As type 
is CSV (comma delimited) and save the file into the appropriate folder  — for 
example, you could use a ‘CONVERSION-DataReadyForImporting’ folder. (Refer 
to the section ‘Setting up file directories’, earlier in this chapter, for more.) Micro-
soft Excel pops up with an alert box to make sure you really want to save the file 
as a text file. Click Yes to confirm.
Microsoft Excel is perhaps a little overzealous about making sure you’ve saved 
your changes before you close the file, and asks if you want to save the file before 
closing. If you’re positive you’ve saved it, and haven’t made any further changes, 
you can simply click Don’t Save!
Preparing data for import
After you’ve exported your data, and if necessary converted it to a CSV file (see the 
preceding section for some general information on these processes), you’re ready 
to prepare your data for importing.

CHAPTER 3  Converting to Xero from Another System      69
Here are some useful techniques for preparing data in Excel for importing into 
Xero:
»
» Convert dollar values to numbers — dollars values aren’t recognised.
»
» Enter dates in day/month/year format.
Users of the US version of Xero enter dates in month/day/year format.
»
» Import amounts as a single column — when data is split between deposits 
and withdrawals, for example, the columns need to be merged and the 
withdrawals recognised as a negative number, by prefixing them with a 
negative symbol.
»
» Remove consumer tax from values (if required). Most information extracted 
doesn’t include consumer tax — so this hopefully won’t be an issue for 
you — but may be required if you’re converting from MYOB.
Here’s how you can convert amounts to a single column, using the example of 
combining deposit and withdrawal columns:
1.	 Insert an additional column in the Excel spreadsheet, beside the 
Withdrawal column, and label it Amount.
The new column is shown in Figure 3-5.
2.	 Combine the Deposit and Withdrawal column by entering a formula in 
the Amount column to subtract Withdrawals from Deposits.
For example, using the spreadsheet shown in Figure 3-5, you could enter the 
formula ‘=+C2-D2’ in cell E2, combining data into a single cell. The withdrawal 
in this example is now represented by a negative number.
Here’s how to calculate the tax exclusive value from the tax inclusive value:
1.	 Calculate the consumer tax Exclusive Amount by inserting a column 
beside the Inclusive Amount column and using the formula Inclusive 
Amount/(Consumer Tax+100)%.
FIGURE 3-5: 
Combining data 
into a single cell. 
Source: Xero 2016

70      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Figure 3-6 shows an example of this calculation, including the formula required 
based on the Excel cells involved. In this example:
Inclusive Amount: $500
Consumer tax: 10%
Exclusive Amount: 500/1.1 = 454.54
2.	 Copy the formula to the end of the data list by clicking the small black 
box at the bottom of the cell and dragging it down alongside the existing 
data.
Don’t apply the Exclusive Amount calculation where the Selling Price is already 
exclusive of consumer tax, or the consumer tax is 0.
Mapping tax rates
The tax rates of the raw data need to reflect Xero’s own unique tax rates before 
importing. Refer to Chapter  2 for more detailed information on tax rates. To 
update the tax rates:
1.	 Identify how the tax rates should be mapped from the old system to Xero 
default tax rates.
You may wish to seek specialist advice here.
2.	 Update using the Find and Replace function within Excel.
Importing Data into Xero
Once you’ve exported and prepared your data from your existing solution, it’s 
ready for importing. At this point, undertake one last review of the data and/or

submit it to responsible parties for final approval. A cup of tea and fresh eyes may 
highlight issues to be rectified prior to import.
When you’re satisfied, follow the steps outlined in the following sections to import 
data into Xero.
Importing only up to 500 rows at a time is a good idea — doing so helps prevent 
any browser time-outs.
Chart of accounts
Follow these steps to import your chart of accounts into Xero:
1.	 From the Xero dashboard go to Settings → Chart of Accounts → Import.
The Import Your Chart of Accounts window opens (see Figure 3-7).
2.	 Answer the two questions on the window.
•	 What system are you importing from?
If you’re using a UK, US or global version of Xero, you only have the single 
option of choosing Xero at this point. If you’re importing from Sage or 
QuickBooks, or another system, choose Xero. Yup! A little confusing, but if 
you’ve completed the Xero Chart of Accounts template (refer to the section 
‘Downloading Xero templates’, earlier in this chapter), Xero is the option 
you need to select here. If you’re using an Australian or New Zealand 
version of Xero, you’re presented with three options here: Xero, MYOB or 
BankLink. If you’re importing from MYOB, select MYOB. If you’re importing 
from Sage or QuickBooks, pick Xero. The other option is BankLink, another 
type of accounting software.
•	 Does the file you are importing contain account balances?
Select No. It is preferable not to import balances because some checks are 
not repeatable. If your data has balances, don’t worry — Xero will ignore 
them if you select this option.
3.	 Click the Browse button to select the required file and then click the blue 
Import button.
For example, you could select the AccountsImport.csv file in the 
DataReadyForImporting folder within the CONVERSION folder.
Clicking the Import button brings up the Confirm Your Imported Accounts 
window, which provides a report on the impending import process. This is an 
opportunity to review the integrity of data prior to import.

72      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
4.	 Review data integrity by clicking the View link beside each report line.
You’re provided with an overview of the import, summarising what has been 
included:
•	 New accounts
•	 Updated accounts (the numbering may look odd, because the default Xero 
accounts will be archived, but don’t stress — continue the process and you 
will see the new accounts added)
•	 System and locked accounts that haven’t been updated
You’re also given a summary of what has been excluded:
•	 Accounts that can’t be imported due to error
•	 Accounts that have been deleted or archived
You have the option here to print errors and changes; however, the option 
only prints a list of the accounts that couldn’t be imported due to errors, not a 
comprehensive overview of the import anomalies.
Note: Xero only has a single consumer tax account in its Chart of Accounts. 
That is, all GST or VAT or sales tax (depending on where you’re based) is 
funnelled into a single consumer tax account. When importing from MYOB 
into Xero, various consumer tax accounts are merged into Xero’s single 
consumer tax account. Xero doesn’t recognise consumer tax lines imported 
from other systems. A default one is automatically created within Xero and 
any existing consumer tax lines aren’t used in future transactions.
If further editing of the data is required, click the grey Cancel button.

CHAPTER 3  Converting to Xero from Another System      73
5.	 Click the green Confirm button to continue with the import process.
6.	 Allocate the bank and credit card accounts.
At the Confirm your Bank and Credit Card Accounts stage, five Account Type 
options are available: Bank, Credit Card, PayPal, Current Asset and Current 
Liability. Select the Account Type/s required and enter account details. Refer 
to Chapter 2 for information on account types.
Note: The sales and purchases accounts aren’t imported during the importa-
tion of the chart of accounts — see the sections ‘Sales’ and ‘Purchases’, later in 
this chapter.
7.	 Confirm the bank and credit card Account Types by clicking the green 
Save button.
You’re returned to the Chart of Accounts dashboard and can view the 
imported accounts.
Contacts
Follow these steps to import contacts into Xero:
1.	 From the Xero dashboard go to Contacts → All Contacts and then click on 
the blue Import button.
The Import Contacts window opens.
2.	 Click the Browse button to select the required file and then click on the 
blue Import button.
For example, you could select <Contacts>Import.csv file from the 
DataReadyForImporting folder within the CONVERSION folder.
Select the option to Ignore Empty Fields — because this is new data, you have 
nothing to override.
Clicking the Import button displays a report on the impending import process 
in the Import Contacts window.
3.	 Review the report integrity.
If further editing of the data is required, click the grey Go Back button, and 
review the imported data file.
4.	 Once satisfied, click the green Complete Import button.
The imported contacts are displayed in Xero.

74      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
When importing contacts into Xero, you may also be importing the bank details 
for those contacts. Sometimes the number is so long it converts and imports as 
something like 4.4444E+58. To stop this from happening, enter dashes between 
the numbers to break up its length, for example xx-xxxx-xxxxxx-xxx.
Inventory items
If your business buys and sells inventory and doesn’t track what it has on hand, 
the conversion process simply requires importing inventory details. If the busi-
ness tracks both the value and the volume of inventory on hand, you need to 
import your inventory details and then, as a second step, import your tracked 
inventory opening balance.
Follow these steps to import your inventory items details into Xero:
1.	 From the Xero dashboard go to Accounts → Inventory → Import → Items.
The Import Items window opens.
2.	 Click the Browse button to select the required file, and then click the blue 
Continue button.
For example, you could select the InventoryImport.csv file from the 
DataReadyForImporting folder in the CONVERSION folder.
An inventory opening balance can only be added to tracked inventory items. To 
define an item as tracked it needs to have an account number listed in the 
InventoryAssetAccount and CostOfGoodsSoldAccount column. Before 
importing, open the file to be imported and double check that the items you 
want to track are set up as required. (If you’re using Xero’s default Chart of 
Accounts, the account numbers are 630 and 310 respectively.) Save the 
updated file.
Clicking the Import button displays a report on the impending import process 
in the Import Inventory Items window.
3.	 Review the report integrity.
If further editing of the data is required, click the Back hyperlink, and review 
the imported data file.
4.	 Once satisfied, click the green Complete Import button to import the data.
The imported inventory displays in Xero.
You now have the individual detail of each item but have not recorded the dollar 
value or volume of the tracked inventory items you have on hand.

CHAPTER 3  Converting to Xero from Another System      75
To import inventory opening balances, follow these steps:
1.	 From the Xero dashboard go to Accounts → Inventory → Import and from 
the drop-down menu select Opening Balances.
The Import Opening Balances window opens.
2.	 Click on the drop-down date box underneath the question ‘What is the 
date of your opening balances?’ and select the appropriate date.
3.	 Choose the asset account that holds the value of your business’s tracked 
inventory.
You have three options here. Generally, a business selects A Single Account, 
and the value of its counted inventory is held in a single inventory asset 
account. So a single account would be linked to a single asset account. 
However, if a business desires detailed analysis of its tracked inventory, it may 
choose to allocate the inventory items across multiple inventory asset 
accounts. If you’re unsure what option to select here, a single account linked to 
an inventory asset account is my recommendation; however, you can select 
the option I’m Not Sure, and speak with your business advisor.
4.	 Download the template containing your business’s tracked inventory 
items.
You see a small green spreadsheet block on the Import Opening Balances 
dashboard, with a file labelled Download template beside it. Click on this file 
and it starts to download. Open the downloaded file and enter the inventory 
item quantity into the Quantity on Hand column and the value of opening 
balances into the Total Value on Hand column. Do not edit the other columns. 
Save the updated file.
Note: Only tracked inventory items — those with the option ‘I track this item’ 
checked — are included in this template and can have opening and ongoing 
inventory asset values.
5.	 Click the Browse button to select the updated file, and then click the blue 
Continue button.
The Import Opening Balances window opens.
6.	 Review the report integrity.
If further editing of the data is required, click the Back hyperlink and review the 
file you tried to import.
7.	 Once satisfied, click the green Complete Import button to import the data.
The imported inventory opening balances display in Xero.

76      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Note: The value of the inventory asset account may be sourced from the 
conversion balance that you enter to record the opening value of the inven-
tory. The numerical value of your inventory asset account is unchanged by the 
import process described. What this import process does is align the individual 
inventory item values with the inventory asset account value.
Sales
Once Xero is set up, you will receive payments against outstanding sales invoices, 
so they need to be in the system to reconcile against when the money is receipted. 
Note: Xero groups the invoices you issue under the Sales area (see Chapter 6 for 
more details).
In the lead-up to a conversion, I encourage clients to chase all outstanding sales, 
pay what bills they can, and review any potential bad debts. This assists with 
detoxing the data and minimises transactional data being brought across into Xero.
Australian and New Zealand users have the option of importing MYOB Service and 
Item Sales invoices, exported directly from MYOB.
Follow these steps to import sales details into Xero:
1.	 From Xero’s Dashboard go to Accounts → Sales and click the Import 
button.
The Import Your Sales Invoices window opens.
2.	 Click the Browse button to select the required file.
For example, you could select the SalesImport.csv file from the 
DataReadyForImporting folder in the CONVERSION folder.
Before you import your sales details, you need to answer two questions about 
the file. Select Yes or No to ‘Would you like to update contact address details?’, 
and define whether the UnitAmount field is Tax Exclusive or Tax Inclusive.
Clicking the Import button displays a report on the impending import process 
in the Import Your Sales Invoices window.
3.	 Review the report integrity.
The import action can’t be undone if you proceed, though once imported the 
draft invoices can be bulk deleted if you make a mistake. If further editing of 
the data is required, click the grey Go Back button and review the imported 
data file.

CHAPTER 3  Converting to Xero from Another System      77
4.	 Once satisfied, click the green Complete Import button to import the data.
The imported sales are imported in Draft status and now display in Xero. You 
have the opportunity to enter additional data in each invoice, and approve 
them as outstanding. (See Chapter 6 for information on dealing with draft 
invoices.)
5.	 Enter credit notes.
Credit notes or negative sales can be imported in the same way. See Chapter 6 
for information on entering Credit Notes.
6.	 Manually update any imported records where the consumer tax wasn’t 
the standard rate.
Find the relevant imported invoices, click on them and update their details to 
reflect the correct allocation of consumer tax. See Chapter 6 for information on 
editing sales invoices.
7.	 Correct any issues by sorting out individual issues or deleting and 
re-importing the data.
The imported invoices only have a single line of transactional details. If you 
need to add additional detail, such as a different Due Date or additional 
transactional information, locate the invoice, click in to it to edit it and save it.
To delete a draft invoice you don’t need, click the check box to the left of it and 
click the red Delete button.
See Chapter 6 for more information on locating and editing sales invoices.
8.	 Check the import balance matches the balances of the data imported.
9.	 Approve sales invoices individually or as a batch.
See Chapter 6 for details on approving sales invoices.
Purchases
Once Xero is set up you can make payments against outstanding bills, so they need 
to be imported into Xero so you can reconcile them when the money is paid. Note: 
Xero groups the bills you receive under the Purchases area (see Chapter 6 for more 
details).
Australian and New Zealand users have the option of importing MYOB Service and 
Item Purchase bills exported directly from MYOB.

78      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Follow these steps to import purchase details into Xero:
1.	 From the Xero dashboard go to Accounts → Purchases and click the 
Import button.
The Import Your Bills window opens.
2.	 Click the Browse button to select the required file and then click the 
Import button.
For example, you could select the BillsImport.csv file from the 
DataReadyForImporting folder in the CONVERSION folder.
Before you import your purchases details, you need to answer two questions 
about the file. Select Yes or No to ‘Would you like to update contact address 
details?’, and define whether the UnitAmount field is Tax Exclusive or Tax 
Inclusive.
Clicking the Import button displays a report on the impending import process 
in the Import Your Bills window.
3.	 Review the report integrity.
The import action can’t be undone if you proceed, though once imported 
the draft bills can be bulk deleted if you make a mistake. If further editing of 
the data is required, click the grey Go Back button and review the imported 
data file.
4.	 Once satisfied, click the green Complete Import button to import the 
data.
The imported bills are imported in Draft status and now display in Xero. You 
have the opportunity to enter additional data in each invoice, and approve 
them as outstanding. (See Chapter 6 for how to deal with draft invoices.)
5.	 Enter Debit Notes.
Debit Notes or negative bills can be imported in the same way. See Chapter 7 
for information on entering Credit Notes. Note: Xero refers to debit notes as 
credit notes — don’t get confused!
6.	 Manually update any imported records where the consumer tax wasn’t 
the standard rate.
Find the imported invoices, click on them and update their details to reflect 
the correct allocation of consumer tax. See Chapter 7 for information on 
editing bills.

CHAPTER 3  Converting to Xero from Another System      79
7.	 Correct any issues by sorting out individual issues or deleting and 
re-importing the data.
The imported bills only have a single line of transactional details. If you need to 
add additional detail, such as a different Due Date or additional transactional 
information, locate the invoice, click in to it to edit it and save it.
To delete a draft bill you don’t need, click the check box to the left of it and click 
the red Delete button.
See Chapter 7 for information on locating and editing bills.
8.	 Check the import balance matches the balances of data imported.
9.	 Approve bills individually or as a batch.
See Chapter 7 for details on approving supplier bills.
An alternative to importing bills is to use a bills and expenses add-on solution like 
Receipt Bank. You scan the bills and submit the scans to the add-on solution, 
which extracts the core details and pushes them into Xero. Such add-on solutions 
normally have a 14-day free trial, so it’s a good way to check out whether you’d 
like to use the add-on for your business.
Bank transactions
Perhaps you’ve decided on a conversion date and set up your bank accounts in 
Xero; however, a gap occurs between the conversion date and the date the bank 
feeds activate, or perhaps your bank doesn’t offer bank feeds. In this case, you 
can manually import statements — see Chapter 4 for further guidance on how to 
do this.
Follow these steps to import Bank Transactions into Xero:
1.	 From the top menu bar, go to Accounts → Bank Accounts → Relevant 
Bank Account, click the Manage Account button on the top right, and 
select the Import a Statement link.
The Import Bank Transactions window opens.
2.	 Click the Browse button to select the required file and then click the 
green Import button.
For example, you could select the <Bank>Import.csv file from the 
DataReadyForImporting folder in the CONVERSION folder.
The Statement Import Options window opens (see Figure 3-8).

80      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
3.	 In the blue Statement Lines Imported from Your File box, under the 
Assign To column, click on the drop-down menu and select the Xero bank 
statement fields the imported data should be matched to.
The available bank statement fields in Xero are Transaction Date, Transaction 
Amount, Payee, Description, Reference, Transaction Type, Cheque No., Account 
Code, Tax Type, Analysis Code and Region. A Xero field can only be selected once.
The table on the right highlights the outcomes of your selections. Use the Next 
option to see the potential treatment of the next imported transaction. The 
statement fields can be reselected until you’re happy the transactions showing 
are correct.
4.	 Make sure that the date format reflects the transactions that you’re 
importing.
You are prompted to confirm the date format; remember that this format will 
be used in future. If you need to change it, click on the drop-down menu and 
select your preferred date format.
5.	 Check the box labelled Don’t Import the First Line.
You check this box because the first line is a column heading.
6.	 Once you’re satisfied the data suitably matches, click the green Save button.
A pop up window confirms statement lines were imported.
7.	 Click OK.
The Bank Reconciliation window opens, because the imported transactions 
need to be reconciled — see Chapter 8 for guidance on reconciling bank 
transactions.
8.	 Process the other bank transactions files by repeating Steps 1 to 6.

CHAPTER 3  Converting to Xero from Another System      81
Manual journals
Xero does not recommend importing manual journals during the conversion pro-
cess because, preferably, transactions should be allocated to the correct area 
rather than via a manual journal. If you do decide entering a manual journal is the 
best solution, remember that only a user with Standard user status and above can 
access the manual journal area.
To import manual journals into Xero, follow these steps:
1.	 From the dashboard, users with Adviser access go to Adviser → Manual 
Journals, and then click the Import button. Users with Standard user 
access go to Reports → All Reports → Journal Reports and then click the 
Add New Journal hyperlink.
The Import Manual Journal window opens.
2.	 Click the Browse button to select the required file and then click the blue 
Import button.
For example, you could select the ManualJournalsImport.csv file from the 
DataReadyForImporting folder in the CONVERSION folder.
To create a single draft manual journal, use the same date and narration for 
each line that you enter. To create multiple draft manual journals, enter a new 
narration, a different date, or both, for each separate journal you want to 
create.
Clicking the Import button displays a report on the impending import process 
in the Import Manual Journal window. It stresses the action cannot be undone!
3.	 Review the report integrity.
If further editing of the data is required, click the grey Go Back button and 
review the imported data file.
4.	 Once satisfied, click the green Complete Import button to import the 
manual journal(s).
The imported data is classified as a draft manual journal on the Manual 
Journals dashboard.
5.	 Post the journal entry by clicking on it, reviewing details are complete 
and correct, and clicking the green Post button.
This is a journal entry so debits must equal credits. Also, check the consumer 
tax has been applied as required. The manual journal is now listed as a posted 
manual journal.
6.	 Process the other imported manual journals by repeating Steps 1 to 5.

82      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Fixed assets
Only a user with Adviser status can tackle some of the processes related to fixed 
assets. To import fixed assets into Xero, follow these steps:
1.	 From the Xero Dashboard go to Accounts → Fixed Assets and click on the 
Import button.
To set up the Start Date, check out Chapter 14 (the Start Date is the date that 
you want Xero to start calculating depreciation on your registered fixed assets).
The Import Fixed Assets window opens.
2.	 Make sure that the asset types in the file exist in Xero.
To set up new asset types, see Chapter 14.
3.	 Select your preferred date format from the drop-down menu.
4.	 Click the Browse button to select the required file and then click the blue 
Continue button.
For example, you could select the FixedAssetsImport.csv file from the 
DataReadyForImporting folder in the CONVERSION folder.
Clicking the Import button opens the Import Fixed Assets window, which 
provides a report on the impending import process, and highlights the action 
can’t be undone.
5.	 Review the report integrity.
If further editing of the fixed asset data is required, click the grey Back button 
and review the imported data file.
6.	 Once satisfied, click the Import button.
The fixed assets are imported as a draft.
7.	 Review the imported fixed assets by clicking on the individual asset 
under the Draft tab and updating the details as required.
See Chapter 14 for guidance on fixed asset details.
8.	 Once satisfied, a user with Adviser status can move the fixed asset from 
the Draft tab to the Registered tab by clicking the check box beside it and 
clicking the Register button.
The asset is now a part of the Fixed Asset Register.
9.	 Check the details of the other imported fixed assets and register them by 
repeating Steps 7 to 8.

CHAPTER 3  Converting to Xero from Another System      83
Unpresented payments or uncleared funds
At conversion date, the bank balance in Xero should match the Trial Balance from 
the old system. The Trial Balance is a standard document you should find in the 
Reports section of your accounting system. If it does, hurrah! Break out the choc-
olate and skip this section!
If the balances don’t match, it may be because a supplier has been paid but the 
cheque or payment hasn’t been presented on the bank statement or, vice versa, 
you’ve paid a client by cheque and it’s not cleared yet. This payment or receipt 
eventually hits the bank statement, and the Xero bank balance. Follow these steps 
to prepare the accounts in anticipation of this:
1.	 Identify the balance of unpresented payments or uncleared funds by 
running a bank reconciliation in the old system as at the conversion date.
2.	 Create an asset account in Xero called Uncleared Funds and a liability 
account in Xero called Unpresented Payments.
Refer to Chapter 2 for information on creating new accounts. Select the option 
Show on Dashboard. The goal of this exercise is to return the balance to nil, 
and once at nil, you’d remove this option from the two accounts.
3.	 Enter the balances identified in Step 1 in the Uncleared Funds and 
Unpresented Payments conversion balance.
4.	 Pre-empt the transactions hitting the bank statement by entering the 
individual transactions identified in Step 1 as Spend Money and Receive 
Money transactions.
Allocate the Spend Money transactions to the Unpresented Payments account.
Allocate the Receive Money transactions to the Uncleared Funds account.
See Chapter 8 for information on Spend Money and Receive Money 
­transactions.
Consumer tax has already been reflected in your conversion figures, so 
allocate a not reportable tax rate to all transactions entered here.
5.	 When payments are recognised in the bank statements, code them in 
Xero to the Uncleared Funds and Unpresented Payments accounts.
6.	 Check off the payments as they’re recognised.
The amount entered into the conversion balance should be reduced to nil.
If that doesn’t sort out your balances, check transactions prior to the Trial Balance 
bank balance haven’t been included in Xero (which would mean they’ve been dou-
ble counted). Double counted transactions need to be deleted — see Chapter 4.

84      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Turning Off Your Old System
You and your staff may be feeling apprehensive about the big switcheroo — that 
is, moving your accounting operations entirely across to Xero. To ensure the move 
goes smoothly, you may need to manage staff expectations. If staff are involved in 
your accounting operations, incorporate them in the decision-making process, 
provide adequate training, and be prepared to answer their questions.
Questions staff (or you) may have may include the following:
»
» What if I need access to historical data?
»
» How can we move to the new system?
»
» When is the switchover date?
The following sections provide you with some answers.
Accessing historical data
You can still refer to the old system for detailed historical information. Although 
historical balances can be entered into Xero for comparative purposes, your old 
accounting system should be relied upon for a detailed history. Create a file direc-
tory entitled something like ‘Historical Financial Data’ and move all your histori-
cal information to the file for future access.
If you were using an accounting solution where you were paying an ongoing sub-
scription fee to them, you no longer have to make this payment — nice to be sav-
ing some money, hey?! — but you should still be able to access your data. As time 
goes by, however, if you upgrade your computer you may no longer be able to 
install ‘old’ accounting software on a ‘new’ platform. You’ll never have these 
problems with a web-based product like Xero, but they’re unavoidable with desk-
top software.
Moving to the new system
You can approach pulling the plug in a couple of ways:
»
» Set up Xero and switch over instantly: This means you’re no longer actively 
using the old accounting system, and you’ve focused all your energies on 
learning and using Xero.

CHAPTER 3  Converting to Xero from Another System      85
»
» Set up Xero but run the accounting systems in parallel: This means 
energies are divided between working on the old and new system and on 
learning Xero — and you’re probably going to spend extra time out of your 
day running two systems. However, it means you can compare reports 
produced. Once you’re confident Xero is capturing all data, you can turn off 
the old system.
You need to decide what suits your style and method of operation. Make sure Xero 
meets your business requirements, and review what you expect in accounting 
software. Then focus on getting your Xero file set up, activating bank feeds, defin-
ing a clear switchover date, and working towards the goal of moving completely 
to Xero as swiftly as possible — like ripping a plaster off!
Confirming the switchover date
Ideally, you want to move to a new system at the start of an accounting period — 
or, even better, the start of a new financial year. Activating automatic bank feeds 
may take up to ten business days, so if a suitable cutover date is looming in your 
calendar, start the process of setting up Xero early, with a focus on activating the 
bank feeds. Return to Xero as the impending day approaches to complete the set-
up process, and switch over on the first day of the next period.

Fine-tuning Your Set-Up
I 
met my husband-to-be during a glorious English summer. Our courtship 
involved touring the Cotswolds in a 1964 open-top white MG that he had 
impressively rebuilt with his own hands. Easy to understand how I fell in love 
with him! Without discounting the incredible talents of my husband, his being 
able to rebuild an MG was also because cars were created more simply in the six-
ties. The dashboard consisted of a speedometer, temperature indicator, oil pres-
sure gauge, full beam indicator, a radio with speakers and a glove box. My husband 
used to say if you needed to know anything else about the car’s performance, just 
listen! Compare the MG’s dashboard to a car of today — modern cars have every-
thing from a GPS navigational system to mobile phone connectors.
Simple or complicated, the purpose of a dashboard is to provide information in a 
single view, assisting you during the journey to reach your destination. If you 
ignore the warning signs on the dashboard, you’re unlikely to reach your destina-
tion. Xero utilises the concept of a dashboard to provide a quick overview and an 
insight into how the business is performing; further dashboards then provide 
details on Sales and Purchases and other areas of the business.
Chapter 4

88      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
As the user, you should review the dashboards to ensure the business is keeping 
on track, taking note of any warning signs. If necessary, as with driving, you may 
need to make changes, deal with the issue, and return to the journey. Just as the 
little flashing oil bottle doesn’t mean a genie has landed on your car, you shouldn’t 
guess or disregard the signs Xero gives you! Know what indicators are good and 
what indicators require your attention.
In this chapter, I provide all the information you need to be able to read your busi-
ness dashboards as quickly as you would the dashboard of your car. I also cover 
setting up bank feeds and bank rules, and making use of email templates.
Tools of the Trade: Understanding 
the Dashboard
When you log into Xero, you can’t avoid the Xero Dashboard! In a new organisation 
on the left side of the dashboard are the business accounts for banks, credit cards 
and online payment gateways (think PayPal) that have been set up in Xero. For 
some people, this may be a very short (or very long) list! Below this list, you find a 
Total Cash In and Out block. On the right side are overviews of (in this order):
»
» Accounts Watchlist — if you’ve not selected any accounts to show on the 
Dashboard Watchlist, this block won’t display (refer to Chapter 2)
»
» Invoices owed to you
»
» Bills you need to pay
»
» Expense claims
If you ever get lost in Xero and need to re-orientate yourself, return to the Xero 
Dashboard by scrolling to the top of the screen and clicking Dashboard on the 
menu bar.
The following sections cover each of the main areas of Xero’s Dashboard. Note: 
When I refer to bank accounts in the following sections, I mean this to include all 
bank, credit card and online payment gateway (such as PayPal) accounts — any 
accounts that you receive payments into.
Xero balance versus bank balance
On the left of the dashboard are the bank accounts that you’ve set up in Xero (refer 
to Chapter 2) and, from here, bank balances can be easily reviewed and reconciled.

CHAPTER 4  Fine-tuning Your Set-Up      89
The Statement Balance represents the actual bank account balance in your account, 
as per its last update within Xero. The Balance in Xero represents the balance of 
the transactions entered in the Xero bank account. Ideally, the two balances should 
be equal, and you should see a green tick and the word Reconciled. This means 
that all cash inflows and outflows from the account have been reconciled and 
coded within Xero. Alas, if the balances aren’t equal, you need to reconcile — and 
reconciling on a regular basis is essential to ensuring the accounting records are 
accurate. See Chapter 8 for full details.
If all transactions are reconciled but the Xero balance and the bank balance don’t 
equal, it may be a timing difference. This always happens when I pay off my busi-
ness credit card account from my business bank account. I reconcile the transfer 
in my bank account. The difference between the two balances is the transfer pay-
ment I made. The Xero balance recognises I’ve posted an entry to my credit card, 
but the credit card feed lags behind. Once the transaction appears and is recon-
ciled in my credit card, the balances match. (This normally sorts itself out within 
one business day.)
If the accounts are reconciled but the bank balance doesn’t reflect your actual 
account balance, you can run a number of different checks to find out why:
»
» Review your opening balance: Was the opening balance entered incorrectly 
and is this having a knock-on effect on the current balance? Review the 
opening balance and amend if necessary (refer to Chapter 2).
»
» Check for missing or duplicated statement lines: Compare the bank feeds 
to your bank account and identify what’s causing the problem. (For example, 
I had a client whose bank interest never appeared on her bank feeds — if you 
have multiple accounts, these accounts may have an inherent hierarchy that 
means interest only appears in the feed for one of the accounts, even if the 
other accounts aren’t related to this bank account feed.) Let Xero Support 
know if the issue occurs regularly but, if it’s a one-off issue, isolate and import 
the missing statement line, or delete it. (See the section ‘Managing bank 
feeds’, later in this chapter, for more information.)
»
» Look out for transaction that have been added incorrectly: It may be that, 
with the best of intentions, a transaction has been added manually in error. To 
identify manually added transactions, go to the Xero Dashboard and click on 
the three vertical dots (like a vertical ellipsis) on the Bank Account block. Click 
on Account Transactions and, in the column labelled Status, click the column 
header that sorts the transactions by their status. Search for transactions 
tagged Reconciled (with a User Created Bank Transaction). These transactions 
may indeed have been correctly imported, but if there appears to be a 
duplicate import, identify the data that needs to be deleted and see Chapter 8.

90      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
The out of balance amount may be made up of multiple errors, so you may not be 
searching for a single amount.
Review the statement exceptions on the third tab of the Bank Reconciliation report 
to investigate the transactions Xero has identified. This may assist you in identify-
ing the amounts, transactions or dates on which issues occurred. Refer to ­Chapter 8 
for insight into how to read and use the Bank Reconciliation report package.
If all bank accounts are not selected to be displayed on the Xero Dashboard, at the 
bottom of the accounts on the left of the dashboard is advice about how many of 
your bank accounts are showing on the dashboard and a link to the Manage Bank 
Accounts area.
Account Watchlist
The Account Watchlist is a snapshot of the monthly and year-to-date balances of 
accounts you want to keep an eye on. Any account (except bank, credit card and 
online gateway accounts) can be added to the Account Watchlist; however, adding 
more than ten may be overwhelming. It’s difficult to interpret a deluge of infor-
mation! This section provides some help on selecting which accounts to keep an 
eye on, and how to add them to your Account Watchlist.
Selecting accounts to add to your Account 
Watchlist
Only add the accounts that provide insights into business performance and any 
accounts that you need to track. This may include key sales accounts, payroll and 
tax liability accounts.
It’s up to you to decide the ones that affect your business most — for example, 
perhaps your upcoming tax obligations or loan balances are most useful. Once set 
up, you can change the accounts on the Account Watchlist at any time.
Adding an account to the Account Watchlist
You may want to add an account to your Account Watchlist for a number of 
reasons — for example, to monitor a short-term loan you have for a new computer. 
To add an account to the Account Watchlist, follow these steps:

CHAPTER 4  Fine-tuning Your Set-Up      91
1.	 From the Account Watchlist dashboard, click the dashboard heading to 
go to the Chart of Accounts dashboard.
2.	 Select the account to be added to the Account Watchlist.
The Edit Account Details window opens.
3.	 Check the box to the left of the Show on Dashboard Watchlist option at 
the bottom of the screen.
4.	 Click the green Save button.
5.	 View the added account by clicking Dashboard on the menu bar.
You should be able to see the added account on the Account Watchlist.
If you no longer need to track the account, repeat the above steps, but at Step 3 
uncheck the box to the left of the Show on Dashboard Watchlist option at the bot-
tom of the screen. This removes the account from the Account Watchlist.
Invoices owed to you
The Invoices owed to you dashboard is a mini summary of the Sales dashboard, 
showing draft invoices, overdue invoices and what money the business is cur-
rently owed. From here, you can quickly access the Sales dashboard and more 
detailed sales information, and add a new invoice.
See Chapter 6 for a detailed overview of the Sales dashboard.
Bills you need to pay
The Bills you need to pay dashboard is a mini summary of the Purchases dash-
board, showing draft bills, overdue bills and what money the business currently 
owes. From here, you can quickly access the Purchases dashboard and more 
detailed purchases information, and add a new bill.
See Chapter 7 for a detailed overview of the Purchases dashboard.

92      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Dealing with expense claims
The Expense Claims block is an overview of the Expense Claims dashboard, and 
the status of all expense claims can be seen here: Your current claim, the total of 
current claims, claims awaiting authorisation and claims awaiting payment. The 
block also provides quick access to adding a new receipt or viewing the Expense 
Claims dashboard: All you need to do is click the heading Expense Claims.
See Chapter 7 for a detailed overview of the Expense Claims dashboard.
Setting Up Users
A bookkeeper I consult for arrived at work on a sunny Monday morning. She 
started her normal work day but something wasn’t right. She was confused but 
couldn’t exactly work out what was wrong, so asked me to look at the file. I noted 
that a lot of changes had been made over the weekend by the business owner’s 
spouse. It transpired the wife had had some spare time so she thought she would 
access the file and fix a few things up! It took a few days to undo all these ‘fix ups’!
You may give some people access to Xero but still want to restrict what they can 
do and see, so they don’t inadvertently create errors or access sensitive informa-
tion. The following sections show you how to set user levels and how to add new 
users.
Understanding user access levels
When you set yourself or others up as users in Xero, you can achieve a level of 
protection by assigning access levels. You can choose between the following:
»
» Read Only: This level of access is useful for managers who want to view 
invoices, bills and reports but don’t want to accidentally change anything. Like 
a kid in a museum, the access allows them to view without touching!
»
» Invoice Only: This access is useful for administrative, sales or purchasing staff 
who enter invoices or bills. Furthermore, you can use four options within this 
type of access — you can specify whether staff with this level of access can 
only create the invoices and bills in draft format (this access is Draft Only), or 
can also approve and pay them (this access is Approve & Pay). As a user, staff 
with this access can also enter their own expense claims. Alternatively, staff 
can be given access to Sales Only or Purchases Only.

CHAPTER 4  Fine-tuning Your Set-Up      93
»
» Standard: This access is useful for the everyday user, such as the administra-
tion clerk who needs to access a variety of areas. Some of the processes they 
can’t do include publishing reports (except Bank Reconciliation Summary 
reports and the region-specific consumer tax returns), locking down accounts, 
processing some aspects of fixed assets, and editing organisational and 
financial settings. You have two additional options: The first is to allow 
Standard users access to Cash Coding (this access is called Cash Coding) or 
restricting access to this feature (this access is called Non Cash Coding). The 
second is to allow Standard users access to Reports (this access is called All 
Reports) or to restrict access to Reports (this access is called No Reports). If you 
set up Xero yourself, you’re automatically assigned Standard user access.
»
» Adviser: This is like VIP access to all areas, and is useful for the bookkeeper, 
accountant or business owner who wants full access to the accounts. Adviser 
status includes everything a Standard user can access and more. Full access 
means you can publish reports, lock dates or prepare manual journals — 
practically anything you want to do!
Standard and Adviser users can be given additional permission to:
»
» Add and remove users and change users’ permissions
»
» Administer payroll, including preparing and posting runs
»
» Add and edit customer and supplier bank account details
Inviting other users to access Xero
One of the truly amazing features of Xero is, when you’re setting up other people 
as users, you’re inviting these people to access your data online in real-time. This 
means you can invite someone to review your data and help you interpret your 
dashboard, sort out a tricky transaction, or process end-of-year reports. You no 
longer need to save the file to a USB stick and mail it to the accountant, for your 
accountant to then waste time working out what software type and version is 
needed to open the file. With a simple email invite, your accountant can access your 
files within a few minutes, and be talking to you in real-time about your live data!
If you’re set up on Xero but your accountant hasn’t used it, still encourage your 
accountant to work directly within the Xero environment. I have worked with 
accountants who, even if they had never seen Xero before, were happy to give it a 
go and soon found it simple to navigate. The feedback from the accountants was 
they found doing what they needed to do within Xero easy, once they had a look 
around. (You could also let your accountant know that an excellent Xero For 
Dummies guide on the subject is available!)

94      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Invite your accountant or Adviser to access your Xero account by following these 
steps:
1.	 From the Xero Dashboard, go to Settings → General Settings → Users.
This brings up the Users dashboard.
2.	 Click on the blue Invite a User button.
The Invite a User dashboard appears (see Figure 4-1).
3.	 Enter the required details under Enter their details.
Include your accountant’s name and email details.
4.	 Select the Adviser option and check the Manage Users and Payroll Admin 
options.
Checking the Payroll Admin option gives your accountant full access to your 
accounts. Note: Your accountant may need to invite some of her own staff 
members to get their hands dirty and work in your file. Checking the Manage 
Users option allows your accountant to invite these users (see Figure 4-2).
5.	 Click the blue Continue button.
This brings up the Personalise Invitation and Send window (see Figure 4-3).

6.	 Personalise your message to the invited user.
For example, you can add a reference to recent discussions about your 
business, and include your name and contact details.
If the invited user isn’t aware you’re intending to send this invite, adding further 
explanation is useful, as is making a follow-up phone call.
7.	 Click the green Send Invite button.

96      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Be aware that Xero is associated with one email address, and the invite email is 
sent as if it is from that email address.
Clicking the Send Invite button brings you back to the Users Dashboard. Here, you 
see the status of the invite  — either Pending or Active. If the invite recipient 
doesn’t respond, you can click on the recipient’s name, and then edit and resend 
the invite.
Once your accountant has accepted your invite, she can access your Xero file and 
any reports needed, including the Fixed Asset Register. She also has the ability to 
export all general ledger transactions.
You can follow similar steps to those outlined in the preceding list to invite other 
users into your Xero files. Just adjust the access option based on the person you’re 
sending the invite to.
When sending out user invites in Xero, if you send an email to a non-existent 
email address, you’re alerted via the email address used to log in to Xero. So check 
your email account first if you haven’t had a response to an invite.
If your outsourced services, such as your accountants, want you to set up a single 
login (for example, ‘The Brilliant Accountants’) for all their staff to use, I encour-
age you to say no to this. You want anyone accessing your Xero file and financial 
data to be accountable and tagged in the audit trail. As the small business owner, 
you don’t benefit from issuing one single login accessed by multiple people. If you 
were audited or reviewed by a court of law, a single login would be frowned upon.
Taking Advantage of Live Bank Feeds
If you’re familiar with internet banking, you know that when you log into your 
bank account in the morning, you view transactions from the previous day. This 
information is the source of your bank feeds. Through permission-based, highly 
secure encryption, this data is sent into your Xero accounts under the guise of 
bank feeds.
When you log into Xero, the data in your Xero Bank Statement is essentially iden-
tical to what you see on your bank statement online bank transaction history as at 
the last bank feeds imported. No more data entry! And no more waiting for bank 
statements to arrive by mail so you can work on a bank reconciliation. The data 
you view on the dashboard is essentially live, and you can confidently make deci-
sions using real-time data.

CHAPTER 4  Fine-tuning Your Set-Up      97
Note: Bank feeds can be set up for some bank accounts, credit card accounts and 
online payment facilities. For simplicity’s sake, I refer to all three as bank feeds in 
the following sections. Major high-street banks typically have bank-feed capabil-
ity, but some smaller institutions may have no feeds available. Most feeds are 
daily, or update when manually refreshed. Fortunately, the number of bank feeds 
available seems to be increasing every day. I recently set up a client who used a 
small country bank that didn’t have bank-feed capability when we set up her 
accounts. Within a few short weeks that had changed, and we were able to add the 
links and activate the bank feeds — revolutionising her accounting process.
Activating live bank feeds
Xero lets you activate live bank feeds from your bank, credit card and online pay-
ment options accounts.
Before starting the bank feed process, make sure the details you’re about to enter 
absolutely match the details from your accounts. Ensure relevant parties at your 
bank are in receipt of permission documentation and are processing it. Things can 
occasionally take longer than they need while setting up bank feeds, and you may 
need to manage the process to keep it on track.
Bank accounts
Here’s how to activate live bank feeds from your bank accounts:
1.	 From the Xero Dashboard, click Accounts → Bank Accounts and navigate 
to the relevant bank account.
The window has two options: Get Bank Feeds or Manually Import a Statement. 
If you can’t see the Get Bank Feeds option, you’re not able to activate bank 
feeds. Double-check that you’ve entered the details correctly (refer to 
Chapter 2) and then check with your Xero advisory team. If the Get Bank Feeds 
option still doesn’t appear, you need to manually import remaining data — see 
the section ‘Manually Importing Statements’, later in this chapter, for more.
2.	 Click the green Get Bank Feeds button.
Because you haven’t yet gone through your permission requirements, hitting 
this button at this stage takes you through to an information page. However, 
the bank you’re with affects what happens after that. Most likely, you’re able to 
link through to a Xero help area with the latest information on how to set up 
live bank feeds for that particular account, either through a partner bank feed 
or a Yodlee feed (see the sidebar ‘Where do bank feeds come from?’ for more). 
You may need to fill out a form and send it to Xero or your bank, or your bank 
may let you apply through online banking.

98      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
If it’s a partner bank feed, once permission has been processed you receive a 
notification email from Xero and statement lines start importing — between 
authorisation and activation, this process can take 10 working days!
If it’s a Yodlee feed, underneath the bank account you should see an 
‘Automatic bank feeds are available for this account’ note along with the green 
Get Bank Feeds button.
3.	 Click on the green Get Bank Feeds button (if required).
This now brings up the Setup Automatic Bank Feeds window.
4.	 Enter your actual bank login and your bank password in the Your Bank 
Login and Your Bank Password fields.
5.	 Read the automatic bank feed terms and conditions and check the box to 
confirm.
You can access the terms and conditions by clicking the link.
6.	 Click Next.
Xero is now connecting with your bank. This may take a few minutes. Read the 
prompts as they appear and act accordingly (these are different for different 
banks).
Once a successful connection has been made, a green Start Bank Feed Now 
button appears.
7.	 Click the green Start Bank Feed Now button.
An activation window opens.
8.	 Select the matching bank feed from the drop-down menu.
You’re given the option to import up to 90 days of transactions or transactions 
starting from a set date. Aim to import data back to your conversion date (the 
date you’re starting your Xero file from). If this option isn’t available, go as far 
back as you can, and then manually import any remaining data. (See the 
section ‘Manually Importing Statements’, later in this chapter, for more.)
9.	 Click the green OK button.
Credit cards
Here’s how to activate live bank feeds for your credit card:
1.	 From the Xero Dashboard, click Accounts → Bank Accounts and navigate 
to the relevant credit card account.
If the credit card is linked to your bank account and you’ve already entered 
bank account passwords, you still need to enter passwords again. However, 

CHAPTER 4  Fine-tuning Your Set-Up      99
if you’ve never entered passwords for this institution, you need to refer to 
permission requirements at Step 2 in the section ‘Bank accounts’, for an 
appreciation of the security steps you need to go through.
2.	 Click the green Start Bank Feeds Now button.
The Setup Your Bank Feed window opens.
3.	 Select the matching bank feed from the drop-down menu.
Make sure you select the correct feed! Don’t start importing your personal 
accounts.
You’re then given the option to import up to a maximum of 90 days or 
transactions starting from a set date. Aim to import data back to your conver-
sion date. If this option isn’t available, go as far back as you can and then 
manually import any remaining data. (See the section ‘Manually Importing 
Statements’, later in this chapter, for more.)
4.	 Click the green OK button.
You’re notified when the transactions are ready.
Online PayPal payment options
PayPal is an international facility for online payments and money transfers. Like 
your bank accounts, PayPal is an independent to Xero, and as such your account 
with them needs to be separately established. Here’s how to activate live bank 
feeds for your PayPal account:
1.	 Find the email ‘Activate your PayPal account in Xero’ sent when you 
included your PayPal account in Xero.
Refer to Chapter 2 for more on adding PayPal to your Xero set-up.
2.	 Click on the first hyperlink in the email to verify your email address.
This takes you to Xero and, if set up correctly, notifies you that the PayPal feeds 
for this account have been activated.
3.	 Log into your PayPal account and locate the My Selling Tools link.
The link’s location is dependent on the type of PayPal account you have.
4.	 Next to the API access, click Update, and in the Option 1 box select Grant 
API permission.
If there is already an added API, it says Add or Edit rather than Grant.

100      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
5.	 In the Third Party Permission Username field, type: paypal_api1.xero.com 
and click Lookup.
You then need to check the boxes beside:
•	 Obtain information about a single transaction
•	 Search your transactions for items that match specific criteria and display 
the results
6.	 Click Add.
It’s vital that the set-up is done in PayPal for the feed to work.
Organising bank accounts  
on your dashboard
To display bank accounts on the dashboard, click on Accounts → Bank Accounts 
and tick the checkbox beside Show Account on Dashboard. To conceal the bank 
account, untick the checkbox.
Prioritise the order of the dashboard bank accounts by following these steps:
1.	 Select the bank account by clicking on it.
2.	 Drag the bank account to move it up or down and drop it into the 
required position.
WHERE DO BANK FEEDS COME FROM?
Recognising the sort of feeds activated within Xero is useful because sometimes issues 
are reported with feeds and knowing what feeds you’re receiving means you’ll be aware 
if any delays in the data have been announced. Two types of bank feeds are possible:
•	 Partner bank feeds: If you’re required to complete a bank feed authority form, the 
feed is from a partner bank. (This means Xero has established a direct relationship 
with the partner bank.)
•	 Yodlee feeds: If you’re able to activate the bank feed while logged into Xero, the 
feed is from Yodlee. Yodlee is an online banking solution service.

CHAPTER 4  Fine-tuning Your Set-Up      101
Managing bank feeds
Even once your bank feeds are all set up and seem to be working fine, you may 
notice some odd gremlins. You still need to keep an eye on your bank feeds and 
manage any problems. Some of the actions you may need to take include the 
following:
»
» Refreshing Yodlee feeds: Occasionally, you may notice that the Yodlee bank 
feed seems a little outdated. Refresh the bank feed and, shortly afterwards, 
you’re notified that the bank feed has been refreshed. Some new unrecon-
ciled transactions may also pop up in your account. To refresh the bank feed, 
click on Manage Account and then click on Refresh Bank Feed.
»
» Re-entering passwords for Yodlee feeds: If your Yodlee bank feed banking 
passwords are changed, the connection to the bank feeds is affected, and you 
need to re-enter passwords. If you use a token or answer a security question 
every time you log in to your internet banking, your bank has Multi-Factor 
Authentication security functionality (try saying that quickly three times!). This 
means the bank feed in Xero needs to be refreshed on a regular basis. 
Realistically, refreshing the feed weekly is probably enough. This process can 
only be done by the user who entered the credentials to activate the feed. 
Each refresh brings in transactions that have occurred since the last refresh, 
up to a maximum of 90 days with most banks (some banks only allow up to 
30 days). A little bit of extra work, but it does provide peace of mind over the 
security of your bank feeds.
»
» Importing duplicate transactions: Importing data without inadvertently 
importing duplicate data can be tricky — even when you’re being very careful 
with the date ranges. If you spot duplications, identify the data that needs to 
be deleted and see Chapter 8.
»
» Deleting bank feeds: To delete a bank feed completely, you need to delete 
the bank account from your Xero accounts — refer to Chapter 2.
Some bank feeds don’t match up perfectly in Xero. Anomalies such as refunds, 
negative amounts and income from interest may be read incorrectly. Report the 
issue to the bank and to Xero, so each party can examine its matching process. If 
you don’t use internet banking, a CSV file can be created by recreating the bank 
statement data in Excel and converting it to a CSV file. Or you can use a tool like 
the CSV Converter (available at csvconverter.gginternational.net), which 
converts .CSV files so they’re suitable for importing into accounting programs. 
Basic CSV files can then be imported into Xero. (Refer to Chapter 3 for more on 
CSV files.)

102      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Manually Importing Statements
If your bank doesn’t offer bank feeds, or if you’re waiting for your bank feed to 
become live, you can manually import the bank data.
If you’re just waiting for your Yodlee bank feeds to become active, bear in mind 
that the data can be backdated. This means, if you can wait, all the data you need 
may become available and you won’t need to manually import the data. Make a 
decision based on what suits you.
To manually import bank statements, follow these steps:
1.	 Download the bank statements data from your online bank account in 
.OFX, .QIF or .CSV format and save it to your finance directory.
Ensure that you select the date range that you wish to import — ask your bank 
for help if you’re unsure about the process. Open up the file. The date column 
must be in the format DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY. If the transactional 
amounts are split between debit and credit columns and you have no total 
column, the import won’t work. Manually adjust the file so that you have a 
single column for the transactional amount total, with a positive figure showing 
money coming in and a negative figure showing money going out. The 
negative amounts must begin with a negative sign.
2.	 Within Xero, from the Xero Dashboard, click Accounts → Bank Accounts 
and navigate to the relevant bank account.
The window has two options: Get Bank Feeds or Manually Import a Statement.
3.	 Click the Manually Import a Statement link, click the green Browse 
button and select the file to be imported.
4.	 Click the green Import button.
Voila! All statement lines are imported just as if they were an automatic feed. 
Takes a little bit longer but still works a treat.
Bank Rules
Bank rules govern the treatment of imported bank transactions. Set up correctly, 
they improve productivity by automatically creating the transactions that match 
imported bank feeds. To complement this, Xero learns transactions as you go, and 
starts suggesting matches without a predefined bank rule.

CHAPTER 4  Fine-tuning Your Set-Up      103
Bank rules do have some limitations; they can’t, for example, be set up to transfer 
between banks accounts. Some people also have the misconception that bank rules 
result in automatically reconciling the transactions — quick and easy confirma-
tion is still required for each individual line, however. Although matches for 
transactions are suggested, now and then a suggestion is incorrect and needs to 
be edited or ignored.
Setting up bank rules
The simplest way to set up bank rules is during the reconciliation process, because 
the bank rule template automatically fills with suggested fields. However, in this 
section I take you through a cleanskin bank rule, so you can grasp how they are 
created and how to edit them if you ever need to. So reap the rewards of setting up 
correct bank rules in the initial months to improve ongoing coding and reconcili-
ation. (See Chapter 8 for guidance on reconciliations.)
Set up bank rules on bank feeds not on imported bank statements, because the 
fields of the bank feeds may be slightly different.
Here’s how to create a bank rule:
1.	 From the Xero Dashboard, go to the centre of the screen and click on the 
Manage button, and select the Bank Rules link from the drop-down 
menu.
The Bank Rules dashboard opens, where existing bank rules can be viewed.
2.	 Click the Create Rule button and select Spend Money Rule from the 
drop-down menu.
The Create Rule window opens. This bank rule template has a seven-part 
wizard to work through.
3.	 Set criteria for the bank rule by working through the drop-down fields at 
part one of the Spend Money Rule wizard.
Figure 4-4 shows these fields. For example, if you were creating a bank rule for 
petrol expenses, you’d need to choose the option All from the drop-down 
options offered in the ‘When money spent on the bank statement matches [All/
Any] of the following conditions . . .’ line. At the first field on the next line, you’d 
then select Any Text Field; at the second field, you’d select Contains and, in the 
final field, you’d enter the text PETROL (or something equally generic, to catch 
all petrol purchases).
Opting for Contains rather than Equals within part one of the Spend Money 
Rule wizard allows the rule to be as flexible as possible, while still correctly 
capturing the maximum number of transactions.

104      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
Sometimes the fields that bank feeds populate can change without notice. 
Opting for Any Text Field allows for potential switches.
Additional criteria can be added using the Add a Condition button, if relevant.
4.	 In part two of the Spend Money Rule wizard, select The Contact Will Be 
An Existing or New Contact option, and enter a generic term in the text 
field.
Figure 4-5 shows these options selected in the Spend Money Rule wizard.
Save time by using generic terms. For example, you don’t need to create a new 
contact for every petrol station you make a purchase at. Keep it simple and 
create a generic contact for regular little expenses like petrol, office stationery 
and milk by just using the generic term in the text field of part two of the Spend 
Money Rule wizard.
If a new contact is entered here, it is created as a new contact.
5.	 Include a fixed value in part three of the Spend Money Rule wizard (as 
required).
In this example of a petrol expense, part three of the wizard can be skipped 
because the transaction has no fixed value (the amount you spend on petrol 
may vary each week). If the expenditure included a fixed component, like 
telephone line rental, the value of this component can be defined here.
6.	 Allocate the transaction detail at part four of the Spend Money Rule 
wizard.
See Figure 4-6. For the petrol example, in the Description field enter Petrol 
Expenses; start typing in the account name in the Account field, and Petrol 
Expenses autofills. (Refer to Chapter 2 for more on adding Petrol Expenses to 
your chart of accounts.)

CHAPTER 4  Fine-tuning Your Set-Up      105
In the Tax Rate column, select the appropriate tax rate and allocate the 
required percentage. For this example, you’d leave the percentage at 100 per 
cent, so the entire transaction is allocated to petrol expenses.
The percentage column is useful if something is partially used for personal use 
and you’re able to determine an average split — that split could be added here. 
For example, in Australia I keep a detailed log book to determine that 20 per 
cent of my car use is personal and 80 per cent is business. So instead of 100 
per cent in the percentage column of the petrol expense line, I enter 80 per 
cent, add an extra transactional line and allocate the remaining 20 per cent to 
my personal loan account.
Tracking options can also be selected here, which allow you to departmentalise 
different transactions, hence enabling reporting on specific areas of the 
business. (Tracking is explained in further detail in Chapter 12.)
7.	 Select From the Reference from the drop-down menu at part five of the 
Spend Money Rule wizard.
Figure 4-7 shows this part of the wizard.
8.	 Select All Bank Accounts from the drop-down menu at part six of the 
Spend Money Rule wizard.
Figure 4-8 shows this part of the wizard.
Unless you have specific reasons, always opt for all bank accounts here. 
Otherwise, you can select specific accounts. For example, if insurance paid out 
of Account A is always car insurance and insurance paid out of Account B is 
always professional indemnity insurance, that could be specified here in the 
reference and on individual bank rules.

106      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
9.	Clearly name the bank rule at part seven of the Spend Money Rule 
wizard, including the customer/supplier and adding the typical type of 
deposit/expense.
This allows you to locate it in the bank rules list later on. For example, enter 
‘Petrol Station — PETROL EXPENSE’ in the text field.
10.	Click the green Save button.
If you created a bank rule to match an existing transaction, when you save the 
rule and return to the bank transaction window, an OK button should be 
between the two matching transactions. If not, the criteria of the bank rules 
may not entirely capture the transaction. Have you included the payee name? 
Have you been too specific, thus deselecting the transaction? Review the 
template and edit the options selected.
You can also use this process to set up Receive Money rules. You just select Receive 
Money Rule at Step 2 in the preceding list, and then the process mirrors that of a 
Spend Money Rule.
You can also set up bank rules during the reconciliation process, because the fields 
on the Bank Rule template automatically fill with suggestions, and you can then 
edit and save these suggestions, rather than create the rule from scratch as I’ve 
shown here.
Managing bank rules
To access a list of active bank rules, go to Accounts → Bank Accounts and click on 
the Bank Rules button. Bank rules are applied according to the order in which they 
sit on this list.
To edit a bank rule, click on the link in the bank rule name and the Edit Rule win-
dow opens. Edit accordingly and save. To change the order shown, click, drag and 
drop the bank rule.
To delete a bank rule, click in the checkbox and select the red Delete button.

CHAPTER 4  Fine-tuning Your Set-Up      107
Take care not to create duplicate bank rules. View Xero in two browsers, or even 
on two monitors, and have the Bank Rules screen open as you process bank rec-
onciliations to help you refine them.
Using File Storage and the Xero Inbox
All Xero solutions come with file storage. This storage offered by Xero means you 
can upload practically all types of documents to Xero and associate them directly 
with the relevant financial information in your Xero file. Within the File Storage 
area you can also create new folders, so you’ve the choice of attaching information 
to transactions or filing it away.
Here are some examples of how you can use Xero’s online storage feature:
»
» Attach a car lease document to the Contact who you have the lease with.
»
» Attach a telephone bill to the actual telephone expense.
»
» Attach calculations on a spreadsheet to a Manual Journal.
»
» Avoid collating and submitting supporting documentation to the accountant 
at the end of the year, because they’re already attached to the transactions. 
(See Chapter 6 for more on attaching a document to an invoice.)
I’ve even heard of one cheeky accountant who uses Xero to store the final back-up 
file from an old accounting solution. Imagine that!
The quickest way to upload documents to Xero is by utilising the Drag and Drop 
method, and the following steps show you how. In the example used in these 
steps, I show you how to attach an electricity bill PDF to a Xero bill recording the 
electricity expense.
Here’s how to upload a file to Xero:
1.	 Open your Xero Purchases dashboard and the file directory where your 
documents are stored and arrange them side by side on your screen.
Have the file directory area on one side of your computer screen and the Xero 
Purchases dashboard on the other side.
2.	 Locate the required PDF in the file directory.
In this example, you would locate the PDF file for the electricity bill.

108      PART 1  Getting Started with Xero
3.	 Locate the required transaction in the Xero Purchases dashboard.
Go to Accounts → Purchases → See All and search for the relevant transaction. 
In this example, you would locate the electricity bill transaction.
4.	 Click on the required transaction in Xero to open it.
In this example, you would click on the electricity bill. See Chapter 7 for further 
guidance on locating purchases.
5.	 Left click on the required file located in your file directory and drag it 
across to the open electricity bill in Xero.
In this example, the required file would be the PDF of the electricity bill.
A grey ‘+ Upload files’ window opens. Release your mouse, and the PDF 
attaches itself to the bill in Xero.
You can also email documents directly to the Xero Files area. Here’s how:
1.	 Click on the folders icon at the top right of the screen to locate your 
unique Xero email address.
This opens up the Files area, and on the right you can see an email address. 
Every Xero file has an email address associated with it — likely something long 
and quite complicated. This address can be used to email and upload docu-
ments directly into the Xero Files directory.
2.	 Save your Xero email address to your email management solution’s 
contacts area, with the name ‘Xero Inbox’.
3.	 Attach a document to an email and send the email to your unique ‘Xero 
Inbox’ email address.
Within moments the attached document arrives in the Files area Inbox (see 
Figure 4-9). From here, it can be attached to a new transaction. You can also 
attach the document by accessing the Files area from within a transaction.

CHAPTER 4  Fine-tuning Your Set-Up      109
Giving documents you’re uploading to Xero recognisable names helps when you 
retrieve and file them, especially if you’re completing your filing a little while 
after you originally sent the file.
Set up your work mailbox rules so that supplier bills are automatically diverted to 
your unique Xero Inbox email address.
The Files area can be accessed by all users with Invoice Only access and above, so 
don’t leave confidential information here. A user can only access files attached to 
a transaction if they have permission to access that transaction.
Xero doesn’t have an inbuilt feature for downloading several attachments at once. 
Quick Win Development (www.quickwindevelopment.com) offer an Excel Inte-
gration Tool as a Xero add-on that allows you to download several attachments in 
one go.
Another option is to upload financial documents to Receipt Bank (www.receipt-
bank.com), which can then extract the required data and push a summary of this 
data, along with the document, directly into the selected transaction type in 
Xero — saving you coding hours.

Managing Your Contacts
W
hat would your business be without contacts — the customers to buy 
from your business, suppliers to sell to your business, and employees to 
work within your business? Details of contacts can be set up in Xero and 
linked to all transactions. Capturing comprehensive information about contacts 
enhances your understanding of them and can improve relationships. For exam-
ple, knowing which suppliers tend to discount their products towards the end of 
the financial year, or offer discounts or free products if you buy in bulk, improves 
your bottom line. End result? Boosting your business!
In this chapter, I cover adding and managing all possible contacts for your 
­business — customers, suppliers and employees. I also show you how you can use 
Xero’s Smart List functionality to generate targeted email lists from your existing 
customer base.
Note: If converting to Xero from another accounting program, you can import your

Setting Up Customers
Businesses rely on customers in some shape or form to inject income into the 
business. Customers may be people, other businesses, government bodies or other 
entities.
To create a new customer contact in Xero, follow these steps:
1.	 Click Contacts on the Xero Dashboard menu and select Customers from 
the drop-down list.
The Contacts dashboard opens.
2.	 Click the green Add Contact button.
The Add Contact window opens. (This is a large window with multiple sections.)
3.	 Add the relevant details in the Contact Information fields.
This text field and the Contact Person field are shown in Figure 5-1. Enter the 
business name or, if a sole proprietor, enter the first and last names.
4.	 Add an account number.
If you’re connecting with add-on solutions, it can be useful to add an account 
number here. It’s an optional field.
5.	 Add details of the key Primary Person for this customer.
Enter the first and last name of the person you deal with most often at the 
business, and the direct email address. Note: If the business is a sole propri-
etor, this information may be a repeat of what you entered for Step 3.

6.	 Click the + Add Another Person hyperlink to add details of additional 
people associated with the contact.
You can add up to five additional people to the contact.
To the right of the added person’s email address is a checkbox; check this box 
if you want them included in emails sent from Xero.
7.	 Enter the relevant details in the Contact Details text fields.
These text fields are shown in Figure 5-2. Type in the contact information as 
required, remembering to capitalise the Town/City text. If the address is the same 
as the postal address, click the Same as Postal Address link and the fields autofill.

116      PART 2  Daily Activities
The Postal Address field for Australian and New Zealand users has a neat 
tool for finding addresses. Start entering the actual business address — for 
example, 299 Junction Road — and Xero’s in-built tool suggests possible 
complete addresses. Select from the choices offered and the rest of the fields 
autofill!
Enter the contact details of the person who approves invoices in the Attention 
field. This may be a repeat of the contact person information from Step 3. This 
is the name that appears on your Sales Invoice’s address details. Also, the 
Direct Dial field is meant to refer to the phone on the desk in an office 
situation, but you can use it for any extra contact information you have. Better 
to have more ways to contact customers who may become elusive when 
payment is due!
8.	 Enter the contact’s default account settings for Sales and Purchases in 
the Financial Details block (if required).
You have the option of associating a single default general ledger Sales and 
Purchases account and Tracking category to every contact. For example, if you 
sold training services to a school and on all new invoices you wanted the 
Account field for this sales line to populate as ‘Training Services Sales’, you’d 
use this feature.
To allocate a default Sales account, go to the drop-down menu below For Sales 
Default Account (see Figure 5-3). Continuing on with the preceding example, 
you’d select Training Services Sales. Likewise, to allocate a default Purchases 
account, go to the drop-down menu below For Purchases Default Account, and 
select the required account.
Underneath the Default Account field, you can also select a tracking category 
to associate with the Contact against both income and expenditure. The 
Tracking fields are only visible if you’ve previously set them up. See Chapter 12 
to learn more about tracking categories.
The Default Account and Tracking settings can be overridden on individual 
transactions. Refer to Chapter 2 for adding new general ledger accounts 
to Xero.
9.	 Enter the contact’s default tax details in the next block.
The fields available will depend on the country your Xero file is associated with 
(see Table 5-1).

block. (Note that this step is optional.)
You can override this default discount rate on individual transactions.
11.	If you have Xero Premium edition, select the default currency, if different 
from the file’s base currency, from the drop-down menu.

118      PART 2  Daily Activities
12.	Enter the contact’s bank details in the Batch Payments block.
Batch payments are typically made to a supplier (see Chapter 7 for more). The 
fields available will depend on the country your Xero file is associated with 
(see Table 5-2).
You may have two separate bank reference numbers associated with your 
bank details. For example, if your bank account is in Australia, you have a 
six-digit BSB number as well as a bank account number. In this case, all 
the numbers are added to the Bank Account Number field. Enter all the 
numbers — and use hyphens to break up the number to prevent Excel from 
reformatting the field. Remember to include zeros at the start of the number if 
relevant.
In the Reference/Details field of the batch payments section, enter ‘<Your 
business name>’. The reference appears on the contact’s bank statement and 
may help them identify the transaction.
13.	Select the default invoice branding for the contact from the Invoice 
Branding drop-down menu.
If you can’t see this option, you currently only have a single invoice associated 
with Xero. You can make changes to Xero’s default invoice branding and 
customise branding themes; Chapter 6 tells you more.
14.	Enter your bill due date requirements in the Bills Default Due Date 
(Optional) field.
You have a number of options here. For example, if you want bills paid within 
seven days (an option that works for most businesses), you can do this by 
entering ‘7’ in the first field and selecting Day(s) After the Bill Date from the 
drop-down menu. The due date will automatically be seven days after the bill 
date. However, if you’ve agreed on specific terms with a contact, enter those 
terms here.

15.	Enter your sales invoice due date requirements at the Sales Invoice 
Default Due Date (Optional) field.
As with the preceding step, you have a number of options here. Entering ‘7’ in 
the first field and selecting Day(s) After the Invoice Date from the drop-down 
menu means the due date will automatically be created at seven days after the 
invoice date.
Contacts can be both suppliers and customers! As you work through the steps 
of creating a new contact, you may be wondering why I refer to the customer 
as a ‘contact’ — why do I keep using the word contact? Great question. Thanks 
for asking. Once saved, the newly created contact is in limbo. Within Xero, it is 
merely defined as a Contact. It isn’t until you create a sales invoice that the 
contact is listed as a Customer. But wait — there’s more! A purchase invoice can 
be raised against the very same contact, and so it is also now listed as a 
Supplier. A single contact can be both a customer and a supplier.
To the right of the Contacts dashboard is a list displaying the number of 
contacts in each group: All, Customers, Suppliers, Employees and Archived. If 
you import a new contact, it’s listed in the All group until you allocate it to one 
of the other groups. It seems illogical, but if you add up the sub-groups you 
don’t get the total number in the All group for a couple of reasons: One, a 
contact can be included in more than one of these groups, and two, if the data 
has been imported, only active contacts are listed in the group.
MAKING USE OF HISTORY & NOTES
Take a look at the History & Notes section at the bottom of the Contacts window. You 
can see two buttons: Show History (# entries) and Add Note. Whenever you (or some-
one else) change any details for a contact, Xero automatically generates History Notes, 
which detail the changes, when they were made and who made them, as well as other 
details. When you click Show History, any History Notes for the contact pop up. The Add 
Note option is useful for adding your own notes — you can use it to record details of 
conversations, coffee preferences, birthday information, anything! When a period is 
locked, History & Notes is still accessible.
To view activity associated with History & Notes, users with Adviser status can go to the 
Adviser tab, and select History & Notes Activity. The History & Notes Activity dashboard 
opens, and at the top are three drop-down search options: Period, Items and User. If 
you wanted to know who in the last month has added Sales Invoices, from the Period 
drop-down menu select ‘Last Month’, from the Items drop-down menu select ‘Sales 
Invoice’, and then click the blue Update button to filter the results that match the search 
criteria. The matching data is listed under column headings Date, Item, Action, User and 
Notes. You can click in via the Item column to view individual underlying transactions.

120      PART 2  Daily Activities
16.	Enter the contact’s Xero Network Key in the key field.
If contacts also use Xero, they can supply a Xero Network Key, a long alpha-
numeric number. To help clients locate their Xero Network Key in their Xero 
file, ask them to go to the Xero Dashboard, and click on Settings → General 
Settings → Xero to Xero. Then click on the Send Xero Network Invite button 
and email the invite to you! More information about how the Xero Network Key 
enables Xero to Xero communication is provided in Chapter 6.
17.	Save the new Contact by clicking the green Save button.
An individual Contact dashboard appears. Interactive details of invoices and 
bills awaiting payment and a graphical representation of activity over the past 
12 months can be viewed on this dashboard (shown in Figure 5-4) once 
additional transactions have occurred.

CHAPTER 5  Managing Your Contacts      121
Your customer is set up and you’re good to go!
Xero has a few other helpful tips and tricks to help you manage your customers 
too. Below the graph on the contact dashboard, you see three useful tabs:
»
» Activity: The Activity tab lists summary details of the creation, editing, approval 
and payment of all transactions with your contact. Plus, you have the ability to view 
and copy the transactions. Click on the headers of each column to sort your data.
»
» Notes: Any notes you’ve added to the contact will appear under the Notes tab 
(and will also show under the Activity tab). You can sort your notes by date 
order. To add a note, click the Add a Note link on the contacts dashboard and 
write your note in the note window that opens (this has space for up to 2,500 
characters). You can cancel or save the note by clicking the buttons on the 
bottom right of the note window.
Notes cannot be edited or exported.
»
» Email: You can attach your Gmail or Office 365 email account to your Contact 
(see the later section ‘Connecting Your Email Account to Your Contacts’ for 
more) so you can easily view your correspondence with the contact while 
you’re working in Xero.
You can also use the individual Contact dashboard to take some other helpful 
actions:
»
» Create contact-related items: On the top left on the Contacts dashboard, you 
can click the green New button to create sales invoices, sales credit notes, repeat-
ing sales invoices, quotes, bills, bill credit notes, repeating bills or purchase orders.
»
» Obtain a summary of a contact’s information: Go to the right column of 
the individual Contact dashboard, where you can see a quick overview of their 
Contact Details, a Google location map, and the Contact Financial Details.
Finally, Xero provides three more ways to help you manage your contacts. If you 
look above the right column, you see three buttons:
»
» File Storage: Use this to attach various types of files directly to the individual 
contact (refer to Chapter 4 for more details).
»
» Options: Click here to merge or archive your contacts (see the later section 
‘Merging your contacts’ and ‘Archiving your outdated contacts’ for more 
information).
You can also send statements out from here. See Chapter 6 for more on how 
to use this option in your business.

» Edit: Click here to edit your contact’s details.

Setting Up Suppliers
To add suppliers into Xero, simply create a new supplier contact card by following 
the steps outlined in the preceding section. Too easy?! Seriously, suppliers and 
customers are set up using the same steps!
Connecting Your Email Account  
to Your Contacts
You can attach your Gmail or Office 365 email address to your contacts. By linking 
one contact, all contacts will be linked, when you access via your User name. To 
make the connection from the menu bar, click on Contacts → All Contacts and 
select a contact. Towards the bottom left of the Contacts screen, click on the Email 
tab and select the blue button labelled Connect. A drop-down menu appears with 
two options: Gmail or Office 365.
To connect a Gmail account to your contact, you select Gmail from the drop-down 
menu. You’re taken to Google to select the email account that you want to attach 
to Xero. You’re then presented with Google’s terms of service and privacy policies. 
If you’re happy to proceed, click the blue button labelled Allow.
To connect your Office 365 email, select Office 365 from the drop-down menu. 
You’re taken to Microsoft Online to select the email account that you want to 
attach to Xero. You’re then presented with Microsoft’s permission details. If 
you’re happy to proceed, click the blue button labelled Accept.
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF FREE  
OR CHEAP CALLS
When entering contacts into Xero, a field on the Contact Details section allows you to 
include the contact’s Skype name and number. Skype is a popular software application 
that provides free or cheap voice over internet calls (VOIP). Entering the Skype name 
and number for your contacts means these contacts can be called using Skype via Xero. 
To enable this feature, install the free Skype software (see www.skype.com for details), 
activate Skype, set up a Skype account, and click on the blue Skype logo on the Contact 
Details window to call the contact. Just remember: The Skype logo (and the functionality 
of this feature) isn’t viewable while contacts are in edit mode.

CHAPTER 5  Managing Your Contacts      123
Voila! Your email account is attached to Xero, and within the Contact’s details you 
will see any messages linked with the contact and that email address. From the 
Contacts dashboard, you can view all email correspondence between your con-
tacts’ email addresses and the email address you’ve link to Xero. Note: You can 
only add one email address to your Xero contacts.
It doesn’t end there! On the right of each email you will see a drop-down arrow. 
Click on this, and you’re presented with five additional options:
»
» Add email to activity: An email that’s linked to the connected email address 
will only appear when the person who connected the email address is logged 
into Xero. So when I connect to Xero using my email address, I am the only 
person who can see the correspondence. If I receive an email I consider 
important for all Xero users to access — such as a price list or agreement — 
I opt to ‘Add email to activity’ so that anyone who accesses the contact’s Email 
area on the individual Contact dashboard can view the email.
»
» Download attachments to contact: You can download any email attach-
ments and permanently attach them to the contact. By adding the attachment 
to the contact, all users with access to the Contacts dashboard can view it.
»
» Add email & attachments to a new invoice: You can add the email and any 
attachments to a new invoice as supporting information.
»
» Add email & attachments to a new quote: You can add the email and any 
attachments to a new quote as supporting information.
»
» Add email & attachments to a new bill: You can add the email and any 
attachments to a new bill as supporting information.
Tweaking Your Contacts after Set-Up
After you’ve added all your customers and suppliers into Xero (refer to preceding 
sections), you may still need to fine-tune your set-up, or streamline how you find 
and manage your contacts. The following sections show you how.
Finding your contacts
Contact relationships are key to running a successful business. You can quickly 
locate individual contacts in a number of ways. One way is to click on Xero’s 
Search button — the magnifying glass on the right side of the menu bar — and 
type in the contact’s name. Select it from the drop-down list and you should see 
all their details before you.

124      PART 2  Daily Activities
Alternatively, you can view all contacts by clicking Contacts on the Xero Dashboard 
menu and selecting All Contacts from the drop-down menu. This brings up the 
Contacts dashboard (see Figure 5-5).
From here, you can locate the contact by one of two options:
»
» Click on the Customers, Suppliers or Groups links listed on the right of the 
dashboard.
»
» Enter all or part of the contact’s name, email address or contact account 
number in the search field.
On the top right of the Contacts list block are the words Sort By, offering you sev-
eral options (they’re grey and a little easy to overlook!). If you click the blue linked 
option, a drop-down menu appears. As the name suggests, you have the option to 
sort your contacts by various contact fields, including Name, Acct#, Email, You 
Owe, You’re Overdue, They Owe, They’re Overdue, Skype and Address. For exam-
ple, if you select They’re Overdue and the down arrow, you can see a list of the 
contacts who currently owe you money — a pretty nifty way to see this at a glance!
Whichever method you use, the individual’s Contact dashboard appears.

CHAPTER 5  Managing Your Contacts      125
Managing your contacts
Contacts never stay still for long! Their details are always changing and need to be 
updated. Edit contact details by following these steps:
1.	 Click Contacts on the Xero Dashboard menu and select All Contacts from 
the drop-down menu.
The Contacts dashboard appears (refer to Figure 5-5).
2.	 Find and click on the contact you need to edit.
Refer to the preceding section for options on how to do this.
3.	 Click on the blue Edit button on the individual contact’s dashboard.
The contact details appear in an editable format.
4.	 Make the required changes and then click the Save button on the bottom 
right.
Grouping your contacts
Contact groups can be created for customers and suppliers (but not employees; 
see the section ‘Setting Up Employees’, later in this chapter). You can create quite 
a number of groupings, and contacts can be assigned to more than one group. 
Groups may be formed around different payment terms, franchisees, new clients, 
overseas contacts — anything that suits your business requirements. An identical 
invoice can be sent to all members of a contact group with one click of a button — 
perfect for processing annual memberships! Some New Reports include options to 
filter by contact groups too; see Chapter  9 for guidance on accessing these 
features.
To create a new contact group from the Xero Dashboard, select All Contacts from 
the drop-down menu. On the Contacts dashboard, click the New Group button, 
and then enter the group’s name. Click OK to save the new group.
To add contacts to a group, simply tick the check box beside the contact’s listing, 
click the blue Add to Group button, and select an existing group or create a new 
group.
To remove contacts from an existing group, from the Contacts dashboard, click on 
the Group tab, tick the check box beside the contact’s listing, and click the blue 
Remove from Group button.

126      PART 2  Daily Activities
Merging your contacts
Ooops! You’ve just realised two contacts in Xero are actually the same person or 
business. Sometimes a number of Contacts are created in error. For example, 
transactions are processed against different contacts and then you realise they 
should all be mapped against a single primary contact. Not to worry! To merge 
contacts and transactions into a single primary contact, follow these steps:
1.	 Click Contacts on the Xero Dashboard menu and select All Contacts from 
the drop-down menu.
The Contacts dashboard appears (refer to Figure 5-5).
2.	 Find the contacts that need to be merged.
Refer to the section ‘Finding your contacts’, earlier in this chapter, for options 
on how to do this.
3.	 Check the box to the left of the secondary contacts that are to be merged 
into the primary contact.
Don’t select the primary contact. Leave that for the following steps.
4.	 Click the Options link, and from the drop-down menu select Merge.
The Merge Contacts window appears.
5.	 Select the primary contact that the other contacts will be merged into by 
entering the contact into the Find Contact field.
6.	 Confirm the merger and click the blue Merge button.
The merged contacts are archived, and the transactions are merged into the 
single contact.
You can’t go back once you click Merge, so make sure you want to do this!
If you’ve set the period or end-of-year lock dates (refer to Chapter 1), after the 
contact merges the original transaction prior to the lock date is still tagged to the 
original contact. However, when you drill down on the Contact name, you link 
directly to the merged contact details.
Unpicking accidentally merged contacts
Even though you can’t unmerge your contacts (refer to preceding section), if you 
do realise you’ve merged in error, you can attempt to repair the damage and real-
locate key information.
Start by creating the new Contacts you need to allocate the transactional informa-
tion to (refer to the earlier section ‘Setting Up Customers’). Then refer to historical 

CHAPTER 5  Managing Your Contacts      127
records, report back-ups or financial information to identify what transactions 
relate to which Contact. Next, edit the transaction to correct the tagged Contact 
(see Chapter 6 for editing Sales transactions and Chapter 7 for editing Purchases 
transactions). If you’ve a lot of transactions to work through, this will be a time-
consuming process, so consider how far back historically you really need to go.
Archiving your outdated contacts
Contacts can’t be deleted, but they can be archived — which means they can be 
restored if needed. To archive a contact, follow these steps:
1.	 Click Contacts on the Xero Dashboard menu and select All Contacts from 
the drop-down menu.
The Contacts dashboard appears (refer to Figure 5-5).
2.	 Find the contact you want to archive.
Refer to the section ‘Finding your contacts’, earlier in this chapter, for options 
on how to do this.
3.	 Check the box to the left of the contact and click the Options link, and 
from the drop-down menu select Archive.
The Archive Contacts window appears.
4.	 To confirm the contact should be archived, click the red Archive button.
Egads! You made a mistake and archived a current contact. Not to worry — archived 
details can be restored. From the Contacts dashboard, click on the Archived link, 
click on your contact’s details, and click the Restore button.
Setting Up Employees
Xero has limited payroll functionality. Users who want a robust payroll may want 
to look at an add-on solution (see Chapter 16 for more on this). This section works 
through the process of setting up a new employee.
This section is only relevant for New Zealand, UK and global users (users outside 
of the United States and Australia). The Australian and US versions of Xero have a 
comprehensive integrated payroll solution, and although if you have this version 
you can still set up employees using the following instructions, don’t! Setting 
employees up within the payroll area is more efficient, which isn’t covered in this 
book. Ask your Xero advisory team for more information and check out  
www.dummies.com/go/xerofd3e for an online Appendix that focuses on this area.

To create a new employee, follow these steps:
1.	 Click Contacts on the Xero Dashboard menu and select Payrun 
Employees from the drop-down menu.
2.	 Click the blue Add Employee button.
The Add Employee window appears.
Only users with Payroll Admin access can view the Employee window (refer to 
Chapter 4 for how to set up access levels).
3.	 Add the employee’s details in the Contact Information block.
Enter the employee’s first and last name, and a personal email address. Avoid 
entering employees’ work email addresses, in case they leave and you still 
need to communicate with them.
4.	 Add the employee’s tax details in the Financial Details block.
The tax fields you’re required to fill out will depend on the country your Xero 
file is associated with (see Table 5-3).
5.	 Add the employee’s wage rate details in the Ordinary Rate field.
The rate of pay can be overwritten during a pay run.
6.	 Add employee payment details in the Payment Details block.
In the Reference/Details field, enter ‘<Your business name> WAGES’. The 
reference appears on the employee’s bank statements if payments are made 
via Xero batch payment facilities (see Chapter 8 for more on batch payments).
7.	 Click the green Save button.
Employee records can’t be merged or added to contact groups; however, they 
can be edited and archived.
New employees can also be created during a pay run.
You can import contact details from other accounting packages. Refer to Chapter 3 
for more information.

CONNECTING WITH CONTACTS  
WHILE YOU’RE CRUISING
While crossing the Sydney Harbour on a ferry (or cruising all sorts of places), you can 
touch base with your contacts using Xero Touch on your mobile device! You just need to 
download and install the Xero app for your mobile device, and then tap on the Xero icon 
to open the app. You’re asked to enter your email address and password, and then 
you’re prompted to create a four-digit passcode, which saves your details and makes 
future log-ins quick and easy — when you return again to Xero Touch, you just need to 
tap and enter the passcode to access Xero. iPhones with fingerprint sensors also allow 
you to log into Xero Touch using Touch ID.
The Xero Touch dashboard displays a summary of Accounts, Invoices and Receipts, with 
four icons along the base: Dashboard, Invoices, Receipts and Contacts.
All active bank, credit card and PayPal accounts are listed in the Accounts section. 
Additional information includes current balance, number of unreconciled transactions 
and the last date the bank feed updated. Click through on an individual account to 
access the reconciliation area. Here you have similar features available for reconciling as 
you do in the desktop version of Xero (see Chapter 8 for guidance on reconciling).
The Invoices section lists a summary of the Draft, Overdue and Unpaid invoices, and 
allows you to add additional invoices. Click through the detail of each individual invoice 
(see Chapter 6 for guidance on sales invoices).
The third section on the Dashboard is entitled Receipts and lists outstanding Supplier, 
Purchases, Spend Money or Expense Claims. (See Chapter 7 for guidance on entering 
Expense Claims.)
Tap the Contacts icon and a search screen appears. Enter the name of a contact and the 
screen autosuggests existing contacts. You can then click the desired contact and drill 
through to the contact information. You can’t edit the contact details, but you can do a 
few neat things: Tap a phone number to call contacts, tap an email address to email 
them, or click the street address and you’re taken to a Google map from your device. 
How geekilicious is that?!
Additional notes can also be added to the contact’s details — just click the blue 
History & Notes link at the bottom of the screen, click the blue Add a New Note link, 
enter notes in the blank screen, and then click the blue Add button. The screen returns 
with the new note added. Click the Contacts button at the top of the screen and then 
the Dashboard icon at the bottom of the screen to return to the dashboard.

Utilising Smart Lists CRM functionality
Smart Lists is an advanced search tool for your existing customer base that can 
help you create targeted customer profiling based on each customer’s history with 
your business. The tool, available on Xero’s Dashboard under Contact, allows you 
to run a conditional search that generates a specific selection of contact details — 
which, for example, can then be used in an email marketing campaign. It’s like a 
small in-built customer relationship management (CRM) system.
Say a jeweller wanted to identify clients who had previously purchased a wedding 
ring from the business so he could send these customers an annual email. The 
jeweller could use Smart Lists to identify these customers, searching for a ‘spe-
cific item’ (using the term ‘wedding ring’, for example). From the generated 
results, they’d also know the year of the wedding anniversary — meaning they 
could suggest the appropriate traditional and modern gift options for the specific 
anniversary the couple were celebrating. Statistically, targeted and insightful 
emails to an existing client base are more likely to generate additional sales.
Here’s how to create your own Smart List:
1.	 From the Xero Dashboard, select Contacts → All Contacts → New (next to 
Smart Lists).
The New Smart List dashboard appears. On the left are some example Saved 
Searches. Click on them to see the results for your own business.
2.	 From the drop-down menu within Find Customers Matching All/Any of 
the Following Conditions, select All.

5.	 Tick the box beside the hyperlink Select All [#] Customers.
Customers identified through a Smart List search can be identified for debt 
collection, contacted via a targeted marketing campaign and sorted into 
a contact group.
Once you have the results from a Smart List search, you can use this list of 
­contacts to create a new Contact Group within Xero, or add it to an existing 
­Contact Group. Here’s how:
1.	 At the Smart List search results page, select all the results and click the 
Options button, and from the drop-down list click the Add to Contact 
Group button.
The Add to Contact Group window opens.
2.	 Choose whether you want to add the list of contacts to an existing group 
or create a new Contact Group.
To add the list to an existing group, tick the box next to this group. (Refer to the 
section ‘Grouping your contacts’ for more on contact groups.) To use the list to 
create a new group, click on the Add to a New Group option.
To export Smart List search results as a CSV file, click the Export button at the top 
of the search results page. From the drop-down menu, select CSV. The CSV file 
transfers to your computer and you can locate it in your Downloads file.
Constant Contact (www.constantcontact.com) is an online marketing tool with 
options that include email marketing. You can export your Smart List search 
results to Constant Contact to take advantage of these options when marketing to 
your existing contacts. To export search results to Constant Contact, you need a 
Constant Contact account. Once you have that sorted, click the Export button on 
the Smart List search results page and from the drop-down menu select Constant 
Contact. Note: Email information needs to be complete for this to work.

Managing Your Sales
I
 had a customer who sold medical equipment and who was most pleased 
with himself. His small business had generated significant sales. Closer inspec-
tion, however, revealed a majority of the sales were to a single customer and 
much of the sales income was still outstanding. This raised concerns for me, and 
I ­suggested that, rather than continue selling to the customer, he should put his 
energies into actively chasing the money for the outstanding sales. The objective 
of a sale should always be having cold hard cash deposited in your business bank 
account. Other aspects of sales are nice (such as goods or services going out from 
your business), but your focus should be on moving customers to open their wal-
lets and give your business cash.
In this chapter, I take you through Xero’s invoice lifecycle — going from the quote 
to drafting the invoice, awaiting its approval, sending it to the client, awaiting its 
payment and it becoming overdue. I cover all the ways Xero makes invoicing your 
customers — and getting them to actually pay up — easier, including making use 
of the Sales dashboard, issuing invoices, recording payments and creating state-
ments. I offer guidance on cash transactions and provide help on more advanced 
invoice functions, such as invoice branding and invoicing groups. I also provide 
help on using invoice reminders and Xero’s email templates to chase overdue 
invoices.
Chapter 6

134      PART 2  Daily Activities
Cash accounting is when income and expenditure are recognised when cash is 
received or paid. Accrual accounting is where income and expenditure are recog-
nised when the actual transaction occurs — that is, the date of the transaction, 
not when the cash is received or paid. Many micro and small business owners have 
company taxes prepared on an accruals basis but prefer to look at review reports 
on a cash basis. Perhaps looking at reports on a cash basis gives them a more 
realistic view of what is happening in their business. If you’re operating a simple 
cash business such as a shop, you don’t need to issue invoices through Xero for 
each individual invoice, but you do need to record the takings through Xero so 
they match up with your bank statements. See the section ‘Recording income for 
a simple cash business’, later in this chapter, for more.
Navigating the Sales Dashboard
The Sales dashboard is a reflection of your business, and understanding what it 
tells you about sales and customers is critical to the ongoing success of your busi-
ness. Key areas on the Sales dashboard allow you to proactively invoice, chase 
incoming money, recognise significant debtors and stay mindful of debtor expo-
sure, and all should be monitored regularly. When you have strategic planning 
sessions, you can use the knowledge gained from your Sales dashboard to analyse 
key aspects of your business.
Spend time understanding the tools available on the Sales dashboard to help you 
understand and improve cash flowing into the business. Ask yourself questions 
about your business and the sales being tracked. Do you service a few big ele-
phants (and so are dependent on their continued support), or lots of little fish? Are 
all your eggs in one basket? Using information from your Sales dashboard, you 
may decide you need to expand or contract your customer base.
Access the Sales dashboard from the Xero Dashboard by clicking Accounts → Sales. 
The Sales dashboard (see Figure 6-1) is split into five blocks: Buttons, Menu Bar, 
Charts, Quotes and Billable Expenses (the latter is only shown if rebilling expenses 
is in active use; refer to Chapter 7).
The first block of the Sales dashboard contains four buttons: + New, Send State-
ments, Import and Search. The + New button gives you a few invoicing options: 
Click through to create a New Invoice, Quote, Repeating Invoice, Credit Note, 
Invoice to Contact Group (an option if you have existing Contact Groups; refer to 
Chapter 5) and to Add a Contact Group. The Send Statements button allows you to 
drill down to the Statements window. The Import button takes you to the import 
process (covered in Chapter 3). Clicking on the Search button opens the search 
pane. Here you can enter number, reference, contact name, amount and date cri-
teria, and use the unsent option to search for invoices.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      135
The second block of the Sales dashboard contains a combination of seven small 
and large tabs: Paid, Repeating, See All, Draft, Awaiting Approval, Awaiting Pay-
ment and Overdue.
The balances of key stages of the invoice lifecycle — Draft, Awaiting Approval, 
Awaiting Payment and Overdue  — are highlighted. (Remember that your cash 
flow is improved the more quickly your invoices move through these stages.)
Here’s how you can explore the Sales dashboard:
»
» View all paid invoice information by drilling down through the Paid tab. Paid 
invoices can be printed or emailed from this area.
»
» Sort columns by clicking on the row headers. Select an invoice by checking a 
single box or multiple boxes to the left of the invoice(s).
»
» View the invoice detail by clicking on the relevant invoice row. Return to the 
Sales dashboard by clicking on the Sales link in the top-left corner. (The Sales 
link is teeny-tiny, but will be there!)

»
» View all repeating invoice information by drilling down through the Repeating 
tab. Repeating invoices can be edited or deleted from this area.
»
» View all summarised invoice information by drilling down through the All tab.
»
» View a summary of draft invoices by drilling down through the Draft tab. A 
draft invoice is where the information has been saved, but no journal entries 
have been created against it. Draft invoices can be submitted for approval, 
approved, deleted, printed, emailed, or copied to a new invoice, quote, 
purchase order or bill from this area.
»
» View a summary of invoices awaiting approval by drilling down through the 
Awaiting Approval tab. Invoices awaiting approval can be approved, deleted, 
printed, emailed, or copied to a new invoice, quote, purchase order or bill 
from this area.
»
» View a summary of invoices awaiting payment by drilling down through the 
Awaiting Payment tab. Invoices awaiting payment can be printed, emailed, 
deposit-receipted or copied to a new invoice, quote, purchase order or bill 
from this area. Red due date text indicates that invoice collection has passed 
its due date. Additional notes can be attached to the invoice in the Expected 
Date column.
»
» View a summary of overdue invoices awaiting payment by drilling down 
through the Overdue tab (from the Sales dashboard). A search block appears 
above the list of overdue invoices to assist in finding invoices. Enter known 
criteria about the invoice and click the blue Search button to filter your 
invoices.
»
» Identify customers who have been allocated expenses yet to be on-billed. Drill 
down through the Billable Expenses at the bottom of the Sales Dashboard to 
see the underlying detail. Raise an invoice to recover the expense.
The third block of the Sales dashboard contains two areas: Money Coming In and 
Customers Owing the Most. The latter option can be shown as a list or pie chart.
To export all Sales Invoices in CSV format, drill down through Accounts → Sales → 
See All and click the Export button. The CSV file downloads to your Downloads file 
area.
Money Coming In
The Money Coming In bar chart represents current net monthly outstanding 
invoices determined by the due date. Each colour block within the month repre-
sents the main outstanding customer.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      137
Here’s how to explore the Money Coming In bar chart:
1.	 Hover over the colour blocks to view a summary of outstanding invoices, 
including contact name and phone details.
2.	 Click to drill down to invoice details.
The chart highlights long-term outstanding debtors and, hopefully, encourages 
you to chase payments!
Customers Owing the Most — list
The Customers Owing the Most list provides a summary of the top five outstand-
ing and overdue amounts owed by customers. You can click on any row to drill 
down to an individual customer statement, or click on the All link to drill down to 
the Statement window listing all customer statements.
Customers Owing the Most — pie chart
The Customers Owing the Most (or debtor exposure) pie chart reflects the net 
amount owed by your top five outstanding customers in relation to all monies 
owed. Each piece of the pie represents a different customer. Hover over the pie 
pieces to view a summary of the outstanding invoices, including contact name and 
phone details, and highlight the debtor exposure in the list on the right.
The charts on Xero’s Sales dashboard let you know who owes your business 
money, but you still need to proactively communicate with customers to remind 
them of any outstanding payments. Send statements, emails or text messages, or 
make phone calls — the squeaky wheel gets the oil!
Mastering Basic Invoice Functions
Invoicing is extremely important but it can drain a considerable amount of admin-
istrative time, so try to keep this function as simple and automated as possible. 
Maximise money coming in to the business by ensuring detailed invoices are sent 
out on a timely basis directly to the person responsible for approving the payment 
of the invoice. Maintain comprehensive contact details and ensure you invoice the 
entity to pay the bill.
The following sections cover all you need to know to invoice your customers effec-
tively, from creating new invoices to sending them out to customers, with lots of 
productivity tips thrown in along the way.

138      PART 2  Daily Activities
Creating a new sales invoice
Follow these steps to create a new invoice:
1.	 From the Sales dashboard select + New button.
The New Invoice window appears (see Figure 6-2).
The invoice number automatically fills for a new invoice. The Invoice Prefix and 
Next Number generated can be customised in the Invoice Settings area — see 
‘Setting up the basics’, later in this chapter, for more on this.
2.	 Enter the contact name in the To field.
If the customer is already in your Xero file, start typing the first three letters of 
the contact name and Xero autosuggests contact names, and the associated 
primary contact person’s first name, last name and email address. Select the 
relevant contact, or type in the name of a new contact. Refer to Chapter 5 for 
guidance on adding Contact details.
3.	 Fill out the Date box.
4.	 Fill out or accept the suggestion for the invoice Due Date box.
If you’ve defined a customer’s payment terms within the Contacts area (refer to 
Chapter 5 for more), the Due Date box autofills.
Keep payment terms as tight as possible. Offering extended credit terms is like 
loaning cash to another business. Can you really afford to do that? Payment 
up-front, or payment on the day of service, is ideal; however, net 7 or 14 days 
may be more realistic for your industry.

window.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      139
5.	 Fill out the optional Reference field.
This could be a purchase order number or the name of the contact who approved 
the invoice. If you don’t have a name, contact the organisation and check who’s 
responsible for approving the invoice. Don’t send an invoice in hope that some-
one will pay it! Help the business pay you by completing this field appropriately.
6.	 Click on the document symbol and attach any relevant files.
The documentation you’d like to attach could be a copy of the purchase order or 
something else relevant to the sale. This attachment process directly associates 
the file with the invoice, and the attachment can be accessed when viewing the 
transaction. Once the document is uploaded, click on the gear icon at the right and 
select ‘Include with invoice’ to include a link to the document within the emailed 
invoice. For further insights into file storage within Xero, refer to Chapter 4.
7.	 Select the invoice design from the drop-down Branding field options.
Xero offers default branding themes for invoices, but you can also customise 
these themes. See the section ‘Designing clear invoices for a positive cash flow’, 
later in this chapter, for more guidance.
If you have Xero Premium edition, you can select the invoice currency from the 
drop-down Currency field options.
8.	 Select the consumer tax status of the invoice from the drop-down 
Amounts Are field options.
The three available options are as follows:
•	 Tax Exclusive: The transaction line amounts are exclusive of tax allocated 
from the tax rate column. The calculated consumer tax is added at the 
bottom to the invoice subtotal to sum to the total figure.
•	 Tax Inclusive: The transaction amounts are inclusive of tax allocated from 
the tax rate column, and at the bottom of the invoice the included consumer 
tax is extracted and detailed between the invoice subtotal and total amount.
•	 No Tax: If this option is selected the default Tax Rates are replaced with 
the consumer tax rates for No Tax and no tax is allocated to the transac-
tion. You can’t change the tax rate defined in the Tax Rate column. If you 
switch back to a Tax Ex/Inclusive option, the consumer tax rates don’t 
switch back — so be careful!
9.	 Enter or select the inventory item from the optional Item field.
The other fields populate with the item details.
To add lines from the customer’s last bill, click the hyperlink Add Last Item 
under the Contact field. When the lines appear, they can be edited. A pop-up 
appears momentarily with the option to undo this action — but you have to be 
quick to click on it!

140      PART 2  Daily Activities
If you have outstanding billable expenses that need to be added to the invoice, 
click the Billable Expenses Can Be Added link and the Select Billable Expenses 
window opens. Click on the checkbox to select the billable expenses you want 
to include in the invoice. To add a number of billable expenses as a single line, 
select the button labelled Add As One Item. To add items individually, select 
the button labelled Add Items. The description, quantity and unit price details 
of the billable expense populate the invoice. Refer to Chapter 7 for guidance 
on adding billable expenses.
Minimise time spent on data entry by creating detailed items for regular sales. 
See Chapter 13 for guidance on creating items.
10.	Enter a comprehensive narrative in the mandatory Description field.
Include as much information as possible, such as dates, contacts, work 
completed, items supplied. If you provide something on a complimentary 
basis, still include it here, highlighting what great value you are!
11.	Fill out the mandatory Quantity and Unit Price fields.
If the sale is for a fixed-price product, enter the quantity as 1, and the full price 
in the unit price column.
12.	Enter any discount to be applied to the row in the optional Disc % field.
If the customer has a predefined discount, it autofills here (but can be 
­overridden).
By entering the percentage discount in the row, the discounted amount is 
posted to the account. If you want to see the amounts separated, don’t use the 
discount percentage option — run the discount as a separate row instead.
DUE DATE CALENDAR SHORTCUTS
You can speed up data entry when creating sales invoices by using shortcut keys in the 
due date field. Here are some possible shortcut keys and what they do:
•	 +[#]m: Adds a date [#] months after invoice date
•	 +[#]w: Adds a date [#] weeks after invoice date
•	 +[#]: Adds a date [#] days after invoice date
•	 [#]: Adds the [#] date in current month
•	 *[#]: Adds the [#] date in following month

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      141
13.	Enter the account name or number and select the desired account from 
the suggested drop-down list for the mandatory Account field.
After an invoice has been issued and money receipted against it, the To, Due 
Date, Reference, Branding Theme, Description, Account and Tracking fields are 
the only ones that you can still edit from within the invoice.
14.	Select the desired rate from the mandatory Tax Rate field.
15.	Select from options in the drop-down menus in the available Tracking fields.
Tracking is optional and you won’t see the field if the feature is not set up. See 
Chapter 12 for guidance on setting up Tracking fields. The Amount field can’t 
be edited. The subtotal, consumer tax and total automatically calculate.
Populate the remaining rows with sales information as needed. Within the 
invoice, you have the ability to drag and drop the individual lines. Note: In 
Figure 6-2 the Tracking field is called ‘Region’. Your Tracking field could be 
labelled something different.
16.	Click the Add a New Line button (as required).
This allows you to add additional lines to the body of the invoice.
If you work with multiple clients, and bill them based on the time you spend with 
them and on their projects, using a time tracking tool like MinuteDock can help 
you streamline your invoicing processes even more. MinuteDock enables you to 
capture the time you spend with different clients, collate the detail and push it 
through to Xero, generating a comprehensive invoice. See Chapter 16 for more on 
add-on solutions for Xero.
MAKING USE OF THE EXPECTED DATE 
COLUMN FOR INVOICES AWAITING 
PAYMENT
A customer called to tell me cash flow was tight and ask if it would be okay if she paid 
my invoice one month after the invoice date. While I prefer to receive payment on time, 
I understand the reality of business and was happy the customer talked to me about this 
issue. I told her I could agree to a late payment. To note this within Xero, I clicked on the 
Awaiting Payment tab on the Sales dashboard. I then clicked on the plus symbol in the 
Expected Date for the relevant invoice, which brought up the customer’s name and con-
tact details. In the Notes field, I left details of our conversation and, in the Expected Date 
field, I typed in +M, which meant a date one month after today’s date autofilled the field. 
Clicking Save meant the new invoice date appeared in the Expected Date column. If I 
need to review the notes at a later date, I can just click again on the Expected Date field.

142      PART 2  Daily Activities
Saving, approving and cancelling invoices
The life cycle of an invoice can include being created as a quote and then a draft 
invoice, which is submitted for approval, awaits approval, is approved, awaits pay-
ment and, finally, receipts payment. Xero also allows you to skip some of these steps 
and jump straight to the approval stage. This section covers each of the basic stages.
Saving
When creating an invoice, instead of saving the invoice first, you can simply 
approve it — see the following section for more. When saving an invoice after it’s 
been created (refer to the section ‘Creating a new sales invoice’, earlier in the 
chapter, for more), you have a number of options:
»
» To save the invoice and continue working on it, click the drop-down arrow 
beside the blue Save button, and select Save (continue editing). The invoice is 
saved and remains open so you can continue working on it.
»
» To save the invoice as a draft, click the drop-down arrow beside the blue Save 
button, and select Save as Draft. (The invoice is now listed under the Draft tab.)
»
» To save the invoice and submit for approval, click the drop-down arrow beside 
the blue Save button, and select Save & Submit for Approval. (The invoice is 
now listed under the Awaiting Approval tab.)
»
» To save the invoice and then create a new invoice, click the drop-down arrow 
beside the blue Save button and select Save & Add Another.
Approving
Only users with Adviser, Standard or Invoice Only with the options Sales Only or 
Approve & Pay access can approve an invoice. Refer to Chapter  4 for more on 
­setting user access levels.
When approving an invoice, you have a number of options:
»
» Simply approve the invoice by clicking the green Approve button.
»
» To approve the invoice and then create a new invoice, click the drop-down 
arrow beside the green Approve button and select Approve & Add Another.
»
» To approve the draft or awaiting approval invoice and view the next invoice 
(draft or awaiting approval respectively), click the drop-down arrow beside the 
green Approve button and select Approve & View Next.
Once you approve an invoice, Xero files it in the Awaiting Payment area.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      143
Cancelling, deleting or voiding
Here’s how to cancel, delete or void an invoice, dependent on the status of the 
invoice:
»
» If you want to cancel the invoice, during the original creation stage click the 
grey Cancel button.
»
» To delete a Draft or Awaiting Approval invoice (without payment applied), 
from the Dashboard click Accounts → Sales and then drill down on either the 
Draft or Awaiting Approval option, check the box beside the relevant invoice 
and select the button labelled Delete. At the Confirm window, click the green 
OK button, and the status of the invoice reverts to Deleted.
»
» To void an invoice Awaiting Payment, or Paid, first any payment made against 
the invoice needs to be removed (see the section ‘Removing allocated 
payments’, later in this chapter. The status of both types of invoices now 
reverts to Awaiting Payment, with no assigned payment allocation. Click on 
the invoice detail, and select the Invoice Options button, and from the 
drop-down menu select Void. At the Confirm window, select the green OK 
button and the status of the invoice reverts to Deleted.
The details of a cancelled invoice disappear entirely, while the erased details of 
cancelled and voided invoices can be found by searching under the grouping 
labelled All.
If you click the Cancel button on an invoice, no confirmation window appears, so 
you don’t have a chance to back out. The invoice is gone forever.
Sending an invoice to a customer
I prefer to email all documents, because emailing is quicker, traceable and envi-
ronmentally friendly. However, some customers refuse to receive emailed invoices, 
using numerous excuses — they don’t have a printer, or their printer isn’t con-
nected to the computer (seriously!). So you may need to use a mix of printed and 
emailed invoices. This section shows you how.
Printing customer invoices
Follow these steps to print customer invoices:
1.	 Go to the Sales dashboard, drill down on the Awaiting Payment tab to 
find the relevant invoice and check the box to the left of the document.
A single invoice or multiple invoices can be selected and processed at the same 
time.

144      PART 2  Daily Activities
2.	 Click the blue Print button.
The Confirm window opens.
3.	 If the invoice has not been marked sent, click the Mark as Sent button; if 
the invoice has been marked sent, click the green OK button.
The Print Invoice window opens.
4.	 Click the green Print Now button.
A PDF is created, which can then be printed in the PDF window.
Emailing client invoices
Emails sent from Xero are sent directly from Xero, so they don’t need to go 
through your email software! Check out the section ‘Defining your user email 
addresses’, later in this chapter, to understand which address you’re sending the 
email from.
If you don’t select the option at Step 9 in the following steps to be sent a copy of 
the email, you won’t be able to access a copy of the sent email.
To email customer invoices follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the Sales dashboard, drill down on the Awaiting Payment tab to 
find the relevant invoice and check the box to the left of the document.
2.	 Click the blue Email button.
The Send Invoice window opens filled out with the customer’s details.
3.	 Enter the email address in the To field (if it’s not autofilled from the 
contact’s details).
Multiple emails can be entered in this field, separated by a comma. If the To 
field was originally blank and you enter an email address at this stage, Xero 
automatically updates the contact details.
If multiple invoices are selected, the email addresses for all invoices are listed. 
To instantly remove an invoice from this grouping, click on the cross on the 
far right.
4.	 Select the Email template from the drop-down menu.
See the section ‘Taking Advantage of Email Templates’, later in this chapter, for 
guidance on customising the template. Click the Show Placeholder Info link to 
see the format of the data fields that you can include in the email.
5.	 Accept or overwrite the text in the Subject field.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      145
6.	Accept or overwrite the text to the customer in the Message field.
Use the Message field as an opportunity to touch base with customers, and 
motivate them to pay you fast!
7.	Select the required Send option.
You can also choose to include an online link and PDF attachment of the 
invoice at this step — see the following section for further information.
8.	Check the Mark as Sent box.
If multiple invoices are selected, the Mark as Sent option is listed for all 
invoices.
9.	Check the Send Me a Copy box.
This creates an email copy of the invoice for your own records.
10.	Click the green Send button.
The invoice is emailed to the contact.
How online invoicing works
Emailed invoices have the option to include either a
»
» Link that can be tracked when viewed
»
» PDF attachment
Opting to include a link creates a live link of the invoice that customers can access 
through their browser. (See the section ‘Setting up the basics’, later in this chap-
ter, for guidance on defining a link as a default option.)
You can view a live invoice link by opening the invoice and clicking the View 
Online Invoice link in the top right corner.
Here’s how you can explore the live invoice:
»
» View outstanding bills by clicking on the Outstanding Bills link on the 
top cyan bar.
»
» View the net amount owing, and the number of days payment is overdue by, 
on the wide white bar, just beneath the top bar.
»
» Start the payment process via PayPal (or other payment service) by clicking 
the green Pay Now button. (Actual customers would then enter their PayPal 
details.)

If customers you’re sending invoices to don’t have Xero software, they can save 
the invoice as a notification. If you click Save on an online Xero invoice, you can 
create a Xero account to store all such saved bills in an area created specifically for 
them!
You can also check out the social media links that were added during the set-up 
process (refer to Chapter 2) by clicking on each of them via the online invoices.
Because the linked invoice is live, as the invoice updates  — for example, with 
receipt of payments or changes to the invoice — the linked invoice also updates.
Notice the green tick beside invoices? A pale green tick indicates they’ve been 
sent. Dark green indicates the link has been clicked on.
Mastering More Advanced Invoice 
Functions
Invoice branding is not just about adding some creative flair  — ensuring all 
required information is present and easy to read can help ensure your invoices are 
paid on time. You can customise the default branding theme in Xero and use other 
functions in Xero to save time when you’re invoicing, such as using repeating 
invoices or invoicing groups. The following sections show you how.
Designing clear invoices for  
a positive cash flow
While I lived in Canada, I processed invoices at the local council office. The lack of 
information, or confusing information, on some invoices I tried to process amazed 
me. Basic information like banking details or who to contact if I had a query about 
the invoice weren’t included on the invoice.
Your invoice branding  — how you provide and present information on your 
invoices — can have a positive influence on your business’s cash flow. The invoice 
design needs to be fit for the purpose intended — that is, alerting customers how 
to pay the money they owe you. Customer quotes, invoices, credit notes and state-
ments can be customised to suit your business branding. They can share the same 
theme, or multiple themes can be created.
Available within Xero are basic and comprehensive invoice customisation options. 
Note: Default branding themes can be assigned to individual customers.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      149
Setting up the basics
Follow these steps to customise the basic elements of your business invoices:
1.	 Click on Settings → General Settings → Invoice Settings and click the 
Default Settings button.
The Default Settings window opens. In the top block you can customise the 
default Bills and Sales Invoice payment terms. The payment terms can be 
customised for individual contacts and overridden during the creation of the 
bill or the invoice.
2.	 Enter details in the Bill’s Default Due Date (Optional) field.
For example, you can click in the Due field, enter ‘10’ and then click on the 
drop-down menu and select Of the Following Month. This means the due date 
for future bills entered with no supplier payment terms defaults to the 10th of 
the following month.
3.	 Enter details in the Sales Invoice’s Default Due Date (Optional) field.
For example, you can click in the Due field, enter ‘7’ and then click on the 
drop-down menu and select Day(s) After the Invoice Date. This means the due 
date for future sales invoices entered with no customer payment terms 
defaults to seven days after the invoice date.
4.	 Enter details for the Automatic Sequencing block, if desired.
In the Automatic Sequencing block are four fields: Invoice Prefix, Credit Note 
Prefix, Quote Prefix and Next Number. You can customise the invoice and 
credit note prefix, but it’s not really necessary. If you don’t have a burning 
desire to change it, just leave it.
5.	 Enter the invoice number you want to generate when you create your 
first sale in Xero in the Next Number field.
If you’re just starting out, you could leave this field and the invoicing would 
start at one. However, you may want to give the impression of being a business 
that has been in existence for some time, so you can enter a higher number in 
the Next Number field, and tell no-one!
6.	 Check the box below Show Outstanding Bills.
Checking this box means that, when an invoice is sent from Xero, an online link 
to the invoice is created. Pretty exciting, huh? Refer to the section ‘How online 
invoicing works’, earlier in this chapter, to see this in action.
7.	 Enter details in the Quote Expiry Date field.
For example, you can click in the Due field, enter ‘10’ and then click on the 
drop-down menu and select day(s) after the quote date. This means that the 
quote expires ten days after the quote date.

150      PART 2  Daily Activities
8.	 Click the green Save button.
When customising invoices in Xero, don’t accidentally send them to a real 
customer. Instead, click the Print PDF button on the top right of the invoice.
Adding payment services
A number of different payment services can be customised to appear on online 
Sales Invoices. Like your bank accounts, the relationship with the payment service 
needs to be established outside of Xero. To add a payment service, click Settings → 
General Settings → Invoice Settings → Payment Services → + Add Payment Services, 
then fill out the fields, and click Save. You can add multiple payment services. Both 
credit card and PayPal payment services can be added to invoice themes via the 
customisation of invoices. Once a payment service has been added to an invoice, the 
branded invoice theme names are listed beside the payment service in the Payment 
Services dashboard, so you know which payment service is linked to which theme.
Customising the Branding Theme
To customise the default business invoice that is created when the file is set up, 
click on the button labelled Options on the right side of the Invoice Settings win-
dow and then Edit. This opens the Edit Branding Theme window. In this section, 
I show you how you can work through this invoice branding, setting up a simple 
yet professional standard themed invoice (of course, you’re free to override any 
customisation suggestions).
Once you’ve finished customising your standard themed invoice, you’re given the 
option to upload your business logo, for use on the invoice. If you’d like to make 
use of this option, having your logo ready to go before you start the customisation 
process is a good idea. The format of the logo you’re uploading to your invoice 
must be .jpg, .gif or .png, and the logo must be scaled to 400 pixels wide and 
120 pixels high. (The file size must be less than 200 KB.) If you’re not sure about 
how the uploaded logo will look on your invoice, talk to your graphic designer (or 
whoever designed the logo for you) about possibly resizing your logo.
Here’s how to set up a standard themed invoice:
1.	 Click on Settings → General Settings → Invoice Settings, click the New 
Branding Theme button and select Standard theme from the drop-down 
menu.
The New Branding Theme window opens (see Figure 6-3).
Clicking the drop-down arrow beside the New Branding Theme button presents 
you with two options: Standard theme and Custom .docx theme. The simplest 
option to set up is a Standard theme, so I recommend working through that 
one first.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      151
2.	 Enter a name for your branded forms.
It won’t be as hard as choosing a name for your first born, but you need to 
choose something. Keeping it simple is best — for example, use the prefix 
MAIN then the document’s name.
3.	 Select the typical page size for your invoices.
The choices are A4 or US letter.
4.	 Select the measurement unit and enter the invoice border size.
Choose a measurement unit (centimetres or inches) you’re comfortable with 
first, and then enter sizing for Top and Bottom margin, and Address padding. 
Ensure the margin size is at least 1 cm to give the invoice enough room to 
neatly print.
5.	 Choose your preferred default invoice font in the Font field and select a 
font size.

152      PART 2  Daily Activities
The stylish people choose Trebuchet but, of course, the choice is up to you! 
Font selection is an important element of business branding, so check with 
your design department when making this decision. My micro-business design 
department consists of one keen-eyed teenage daughter! If you don’t have a 
design department, have a look at the kinds of things you’ve had designed for 
your business in the past, such as your website, shop signage or even business 
cards, or throw it out on social media and let those you are connected with be 
your guide and choose a font that works with your overall brand.
When selecting the font size, only a few size options are available. Choose the 
maximum option of 11pt — anything less gets too hard for some people to 
read (and you don’t want people using the excuse they can’t pay you because 
they can’t read the invoice!).
6.	 Specify names for individual invoices.
You can adjust the names for the following (in the order shown on screen):
•	 Draft Invoice
•	 Approved Invoice
•	 Overdue Invoice
•	 Credit Note
•	 Statement
•	 Draft Purchase Order
•	 Purchase Order
•	 Draft Quote
•	 Quote
•	 Remittance Advice
•	 Receipt
Each naming field has 20 character spaces and already has a suggested 
name. To keep things simple, just add the overall name of your branded form 
(chosen in Step 2 of this list) to the start of each suggestion. So your draft 
invoice becomes [NAME] DRAFT INVOICE (and so on). Abbreviate the name if 
necessary to fit the field.
7.	 Move across to the second column and check elements that you want to 
appear on the invoice.
Select all the options you require and then remove ones that you decide you 
don’t want.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      153
8.	Select your Payment Services account from the two drop-down options.
Adding a Payment Service here allows you to let clients pay invoices via your 
online payment service. The first Payment Service option is for Credit Cards. 
The second Payment Service option is exclusively for PayPal accounts. (Refer to 
the preceding section for more on adding Payment Services.)
9.	Enter when and how you expect to be paid in the Terms and Payment 
Advice (Invoice) box.
The field is limited to 1,000 characters. If you can’t fit in everything you want 
to say, have your full terms and conditions on your website. That way, you can 
have the basics on your invoice and then include a link to them in this box.
10.	Enter your quoting terms in the Terms (Quote) box.
This field is limited to 1,000 characters.
If you can’t fit in everything you want to say, place your full quoting terms on 
your website. That way, you can have the basics on your invoice and then add 
a link to them in this box.
The terms and payment information is important so, once you’ve included it, 
print out the invoice and make sure you’ve entered the information correctly 
and it can be easily read. And remember to keep payment terms as tight as 
possible!
11.	Select your preferred logo alignment (if required).
If you choose to upload a logo for your invoice, how to do so is covered after 
these steps — for now, you just have to pick which side of the page you want it 
to sit on. If you’re not sure, select the right alignment.
12.	Select your preference at the Show Taxes As field.
Selecting the Inclusive option means all invoice amounts displayed are 
inclusive of consumer tax. What you select here may depend on how you’re 
legally required to show prices. With both options (Inclusive or Exclusive), the 
final invoice amount is shown inclusive of consumer tax.
13.	Enter your business contact details in the final box.
This may include your phone and email details.
14.	Check all your details and click the green Save button.
This saves your branding theme and the New Branding Theme window closes.
Congratulations! You’ve created a new invoice template. And the good news is you 
can have unlimited standard templates, so if your business has a number of 
­identities (or different strands), you can create a different standard invoice for 
each identity.

154      PART 2  Daily Activities
Once the template has been created, you’re given the option to upload a business 
logo by clicking on the Upload Logo hyperlink within the template block. If you 
want your logo to appear, click the link and follow the instructions for uploading 
the file.
Uploading a logo to your invoice means it’s now a customised invoice. To save it, 
just click the Save button. The Invoice Settings window now displays the custom-
ised invoice template block. Any additional template blocks you create will also sit 
in this area. The customised invoice templates can be edited, copied or deleted, 
and the logo can be changed or removed from the Invoice Settings dashboard by 
clicking the Options button.
If you have multiple templates and want to change the order of the templates 
shown in the Invoice Settings window, hover on the top left corner, and click to 
grab the template. Move it where you want.
If you need to access the Invoice Settings after you’ve created your invoice, click 
on Settings on the Menu Bar and select General Settings. Under the heading Fea-
tures, select Invoice Settings. There you have further invoice customisation 
options.
Fancy schmancy invoice branding
If you want to take your invoice branding to the next level, you can design up to 15 
DOCX invoice branding themes and use them with sales invoices, credit notes, 
statements, purchase orders, quotes, remittance advice statements and receipts.
Why on earth would you want 15 different themes? Well, if you sell different sorts 
of products, you can customise the invoice to the particular product. For example, 
when I sell one of my guides to starting a small business, I use an invoice that 
upsells appropriate products relevant to the purchase. Of course, it’s perfectly 
acceptable just to use a single branded invoice — but it’s nice to have options!
Note: Receipt branding is a little different to the other document types. You can’t 
send a receipt using a DOCX template from the Send Receipt area, though it is 
possible to send a standard branded themed document via this process. You can, 
however, customise a receipt using a DOCX template and then upload it to a paid 
invoice. Think of it as an invoice disguised as a receipt — with all the relevant 
acknowledgements and thank-you statements you’d expect on a receipt.
DOCX invoice branding allows you to work on invoices in a Microsoft Word ­format, 
which allows for greater scope of customisation. If you understand the concept of 
using mail merge features, you should be able to navigate your way around 
designing DOCX templates for your business.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      155
To create a new DOCX branded template from the Xero Dashboard, follow these 
steps:
1.	 Go to Settings → General Settings → Invoice Settings, click the New 
Branding Theme button, and select the Custom .docx Theme option from 
the drop-down menu.
The New Branding Theme window opens.
2.	 Name the new theme in the Your Title for the New Branding Theme field 
and click OK.
For this exercise, I’m calling the theme MAIN, but you can choose to call it 
something else.
3.	 Scroll to the bottom of the Invoice Settings screen to locate the newly 
created invoice theme.
4.	 Click the Download button from the <MAIN> Invoice block to download  
a template file.
The <MAIN> Templates zip file downloads to your computer.
The process used to open your zip file depends on your computer set-up. 
I simply double click on the zip file to open it.
5.	 Open the Microsoft Word document called Invoice.
Now you have the opportunity to customise your theme: Text surrounded by « 
» is a field that merges with data from your accounting system. Plain text 
appears as it is.
If during that process you think you lost the downloaded file, look in your 
downloads file directory — it should be there. If the invoice is in Protected View 
mode, click Enable Editing to allow you to edit the document.
6.	 Select fields as required to make adjustments.
Tinker with the invoice as you desire — you can change fonts, font sizes 
and other aspects of the invoice. Hover over and select the field «INVOICE 
TITLE» and change the colour of the text to a scandalous pink colour, if you 
want — because everything’s always better in pink! (Or is it just me who 
thinks that?!)
Many customisations can be incorporated into the invoice. Go as crazy as you 
think works, but make sure the invoice still does what it is supposed to — 
notify customers they owe you money and let them know how they can pay 
you! And don’t feel that you are under time pressure to complete all your 

156      PART 2  Daily Activities
customisation. You can close Xero down and work on the invoice, and then log 
back in and upload it at a later date.
7.	Save the document to your computer.
8.	Return to the Invoice Settings dashboard of Xero, and select the Upload 
button at the <MAIN> Invoice block.
The Upload .docx Template opens.
9.	Click Browse (underneath the word Invoice), select the edited file and 
click Open.
Notice the chosen file now appears on the Upload .docx Template window, 
beside the Browse button.
10.	Click the green Upload button.
Voila! The customised invoice appears as a branded .docx invoice on the 
<MAIN> Invoice block.
To customise the Credit Note, Statement, Purchase Order and Quote or to further 
edit the invoice, follow Steps 3 to 10.
WHY SEND FOUR INVOICES WHEN YOU 
CAN JUST SEND ONE?
Your workflow processes may lead you to generate multiple invoices for the same 
client; however, you (or your client) may only want to work with a single invoice. 
Fortunately, Xero makes it possible for you to select multiple invoices and merge them 
into a single invoice.
To merge your invoices, open up the Sales dashboard, select the invoices that you want 
to merge (by checking the checkbox beside them), and click the button labelled Copy 
To. . . . The ‘Copy & merge into a new . . .’ window opens up. Select the option Invoice, 
and click the button labelled Copy & Merge. A new invoice (with each individual line 
listed from the selected invoices) appears. Enter the contact name in the To field, check 
the invoice details and click the green Approve button.
Remember: Merging your invoices doesn’t delete the original invoices, so when you’re 
happy to commit to the new invoice you need to void the original invoices so as not to 
distort your sales figures.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      157
Working with repeating invoices
Some customers I work with sign up their customers to fixed monthly subscrip-
tions, meaning their customers are billed the same amount for this subscription 
every month. For these customers, I’ve set up a Repeating Invoice template, which 
automatically generates a new periodical invoice based on a saved template — so 
an automatic invoice is sent to the customer on the same day every month. I also 
use these templates for some of my own invoices and, once I’ve set them up, all I 
have to do is edit the Repeating Invoice templates annually for price increases — 
for the rest of the year, I can forget about them. My valuable time is used servicing 
the customer, not preparing invoices!
To create a repeating invoice, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the Sales dashboard, click on the drop-down menu beside the New 
Invoice button and select Repeating Invoice.
The New Repeating Invoice window opens (see Figure 6-4).
2.	 Fill out the Repeat This Transaction Every field.
You have a few options here. For example, if you want the invoice to repeat 
every month, enter 1 in the numeral field and select Month(s) from the 
drop-down menu.
3.	 Select the original invoice date by clicking in the calendar field.
4.	 Define the repeating invoice due date.
Again, you have different options here. For example, if you want the invoice to 
be due on the 7th of the following month, enter 7 in the Due field and select Of 
the Following Month from the drop-down menu options.
5.	 Fill out the optional End Date calendar field (if end date is known).
6.	 Select the Approve for Sending option.
Selecting this option means the invoice is automatically emailed to the 
customer every time it’s created. Note: This does not mean that the template 
has been saved — you still need to complete the remaining steps.

158      PART 2  Daily Activities
As you click in the Description and Reference fields, an option to Insert 
Placeholders appears. As an example of how to use this feature, in the Reference 
field click on the Insert Placeholder hyperlink to insert Week, Month, Year, Week 
Year or Month Year. Add the placeholder Month and then add the text ‘dues’. 
When the repeating invoice generates a new invoice, it appears with the actual 
month listed in the field (so in this case, for example, ‘September dues’). Additional 
customisation improves the professional look of your invoice for minimal effort.
7.	 Fill out the remainder of the body of the invoice following Creating an 
Invoice.
Use the reference field to give the invoice an identifying name.
8.	 Save the template by clicking the green Save button.
The template is filed under the Repeating tab.
Invoicing contact groups
I visited a customer who wanted an easy way to process 750 annual membership 
renewals. To add further complexity, the customer offered five levels of member-
ship pricing with dues increasing annually. My solution was to set up five differ-
ent contact groups and, using Xero’s Invoice to Contact Group feature, invoice 
each group. Voila! This created 750 individual annual membership renewal 
invoices easily and got rid of the nearly two days of creating and checking data 
that had been required when my customer was using another accounting system.
To invoice a contact group, follow these steps:
1.	 Create a contact group and allocate appropriate contacts to the group.
Refer to Chapter 5 for information on this process.
2.	 Click the New button on the Sales dashboard and select the contact group.
This means the whole contact group is going to receive the invoice.
3.	 Complete details on the invoice, for the group.
4.	 Select the blue Create Draft Invoices button.
The Draft invoices tab appears with draft invoices for all contacts in the group. 
If necessary, click on individual invoices to drill down and edit.
5.	 Select all draft invoices, click the green Approve button, and click the 
green OK button.
Refer to the section ‘Creating a new sales invoice’, earlier in the chapter, for more.
That was crazy easy!

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      159
Managing credit notes
If the invoice needs to be changed after being issued to a customer — for example, 
because the amount billed was incorrect or has since been renegotiated — a credit 
note can be raised to formally recognise the change. The credit note can offset 
outstanding invoices, or accompany a refund.
To process a credit note, follow the steps outlined in this section.
Allocating a credit note for a specific invoice
Follow these steps to apply a credit note to an existing sales invoice:
1.	 Go to Accounts → Sales → See All and click on the relevant invoice to 
open it.
If the invoice is approved, skip ahead to Step 3.
If the invoice is in Draft or is Awaiting Approval, you can simply edit the invoice 
details to reflect the change, rather than undertaking the burden of creating a 
credit note. If you still want to use the invoice to create a credit note, go to 
Step 2.
2.	 Click the green Approve button at the bottom of the invoice.
Before an invoice can have a credit note applied against it, it needs to be 
approved.
3.	 In the top right corner click Invoice Options and from the drop-down 
menu select Add Credit Note.
The New Credit Note window appears, mirroring the details of the invoice the 
credit note is to be applied against.
Note: The credit note doesn’t need to replicate the full amount of the invoice; it 
could be less, reducing the invoice. It could be identical, or it could be more — 
reflecting other amounts that need to be refunded and automatically raising a 
new credit note, waiting to be applied to another invoice for the respective 
customer.
4.	 Fill out the Date and Reference fields.
Enter a detailed reference of the relevant invoice in the Reference field.
5.	 Amend the credit note details as required and click the green Approve 
button.
The credit note is applied to the invoice.

160      PART 2  Daily Activities
Processing a credit note where no invoice exists
The practicalities of business mean that sometimes customers, for whatever rea-
son, realise they don’t need what they’ve paid for. With your permission, they 
return it. Rather than give them a refund upfront, you can raise a credit note to be 
applied against future purchases.
To create a new credit note without an existing transaction to apply it against, 
follow these steps:
1.	 On the Sales dashboard click the drop-down arrow beside the + New 
button and select the Credit Note button.
2.	 Complete the details on the Credit Note screen.
To comply with taxation requirements, include comprehensive details about 
why the credit note is being issued. Note: The values are entered as positive.
3.	 Save or approve the credit note.
Refer to the section ‘Saving, approving and cancelling invoices’, earlier in this 
chapter, for details on this.
Because no existing outstanding customer invoice relates to this credit note, 
the credit note simply saves. If at a future date a customer invoice is approved, 
the Allocate Outstanding Credit? window pops up. Click the green Allocate 
button if the credit note should be applied to this invoice, and the Allocate 
Credit to Invoice dashboard opens. A reminder of the outstanding credit on 
existing invoices appears; clicking the option to Credit this Invoice also opens 
the Allocate Credit to Invoice dashboard.
4.	 At the Allocate Credit to Invoice dashboard, enter the amount of the 
credit note in the Amount to Credit field.
5.	 Click the green Allocate Credit button.
The credit is applied to the new Sales Invoice.
6.	 Print or email the invoice.
Refer to the section ‘Sending an invoice to a customer’, earlier in this chapter.
Creating a new quote
Some business exchanges require an approved quote before a sale happens. A sales 
quote provides details of products and/or services offered, and outlines the 
expense involved.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      161
Follow these steps to create a new quote:
1.	 From the Xero Dashboard, click Accounts → Sales, and from the drop-
down menu beside the + New button, select Quote.
The New Quote window appears.
2.	 Enter the contact name in the Customer field.
Doing this allows Xero to populate the quote with your contact’s information.
3.	 Click the Add a Title & Summary link under the Customer field.
Two text block fields appear. In the first one, add details about who you’re 
providing the quote for. This may include their position title, for example. In 
the second block, add a summary of the product or service you’re quoting for.
4.	 Select the date from the Date field.
5.	 Enter the quote’s expiry date in the Expiry field.
Refer to the earlier section, ‘Creating a new sales invoice’, for guidance on 
completing the rest of your quote.
The quote number automatically fills for a new quote. The Quote Prefix and 
Next Number generated can be customised in the Invoice Settings area — 
refer to the earlier section ‘Setting up the basics’ for more on this.
6.	 Enter any unique provisions for the quote in the Terms text field.
Standard quote terms should feed in from your Invoice Settings area.
7.	 Send your quote.
The Send Quote window appears. Check that your quote meets your require-
ments, and click the green Send button.
Recording Payments
Receiving payment is always exciting! And recording payments received in a 
timely manner means you can be confident your reports showing invoices await-
ing payment are correct. You are also well placed to follow up on outstanding 
debts in a timely manner.
In the following sections, I cover recording payments against sales invoices for a 
simple cash business, and recording the payment of multiple invoices using the 
batch deposit feature.

162      PART 2  Daily Activities
Receipting against sales invoices
To record a payment against a sales invoice, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the Sales dashboard and click the Awaiting Payment tab.
2.	 Click the required invoice to drill down to the detail.
At the bottom of the invoice is a Make a Payment block. A full or part payment 
against the invoice can be recorded here.
3.	 Fill out the Amount Paid field.
4.	 Fill out the Date Paid calendar.
5.	 Select the general ledger account the money was paid into in the Paid To 
field.
Payment may be made to your bank, credit card or PayPal account, or any 
account set up to enable payments from the account. Refer to Chapter 2 for 
guidance on customising general ledger accounts.
6.	 Fill out the optional Reference field.
For example, you could include the cheque number here.
7.	 Click the green Add Payment button.
You’re returned to the Sales dashboard. At the top of the screen is a green 
block, confirming the details of the payment receipted. Two hyperlinks also 
appear: View Invoice, a short-cut to drill down and view the invoice details 
again, and Send Receipt. See the next section for guidance on sending out a 
receipt.
Payment can also be receipted during the reconciliation matching process, which 
I describe in Chapter 8. You may find that method quicker — I certainly do.
Sending receipts
A sales receipt formally acknowledges that customer payment has been received. 
Before you can send a receipt, you need to get your ducks in a row, as follows:
»
» Customise your receipts email template — see the section ‘Taking Advantage

To send a receipt after receiving payment against a single invoice, follow the steps 
outlined in the preceding section. At Step 7, once the payment has been added, 
click on the hyperlink Send Receipt and the Send Receipt window opens up (simi-
lar to Figure 6-5; jump ahead to the section ‘Sending a Batch Deposit receipt to 
customers’, and follow the instructions from Step 4 onwards).
Recording income for a simple  
cash business
Clients of mine are the owners of a small independent grocery store. They sell an 
amazing array of imported and local foods, and many customers flock to their 
shop. When they review their takings at the end of the day, they have received a 
combination of cash, debit card, credit card, AMEX and Diners payments from 
their wonderful customers. They have also used money from their cash takings to 
pay for expenses, such as cash-on-delivery items.
Of course, they don’t need to issue each customer an individual invoice from Xero, 
but the business still needs to account for the takings. To add to the complexity of 
this scenario, some payments take a few days to be received by the bank and some 
payments are subject to commission deductions. All this means the business is 
never exactly sure how much they’re going to receive and when they’re going to 
receive it in their bank.
To prepare for recording daily sales, I advised these clients to create a Cash Sales 
contact and then charge the daily sales to this contact.
If you operate a simple cash business and want to use the same approach, here’s 
how:
1.	 Obtain a copy of the cash register reading at the end of the day.
If you have multiple cash registers, you need the total for all of them. You may 
be able to get this information if you’re using a network system; otherwise, add 
it up on a spreadsheet.
2.	 Prepare a daily Sales Invoice charged to the Cash Sales contact, splitting 
out the different lines payment is going to be received from.
Payment could be received as cash, debit card, credit card and so on. Use the 
Unit Price field to enter the commission and bank charges as negative 
amounts deducted from the income.
3.	 As payment is receipted in the bank, record payment against the invoice.
Payment may be receipted in several stages, via the cash banking.

Making use of batch payments
The batch deposit feature in Xero can be utilised when recording cheques to be 
deposited, or a single payment against multiple invoices. Using the feature creates 
a single transaction in the Xero file, which can then be reconciled against a single 
transaction in the bank feed.
Recording a batch deposit against sales invoices
To record a batch deposit as a payment against a sales invoice, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the Sales dashboard and click on the Awaiting Payment tab.
2.	 Check the invoices to be included in the batch deposit.
Note: Overpayments cannot be recorded within a batch deposit, and credit 
notes cannot be included within a batch deposit. Refer to the section 
‘Managing credit notes’, earlier in this chapter, to record the credit note against 
an invoice, where relevant.
3.	 Select the Deposit button.
4.	 Fill out the Payment Date Paid calendar.
5.	 Fill out the compulsory Reference field.
Include summary details of the payment here.
6.	 Select a Bank Account from the drop-down options.
7.	 Fill out the optional Reference/Cheque No field, against individual 
invoices in the batch.
Once all required fields are filled, the green Deposit button becomes active.
8.	 Click the green Deposit button.
Once the deposit has been created, on the top right of the batch deposit 
appear the buttons Print Deposit PDF, Export CSV, Send Receipt and Options.
The add-on solution Hubdoc pulls cheque PDF images from your bank and 
pushes the PDF and its details into Xero.
Locating a batch deposit
Once you’ve recorded the batch deposit, you may want to locate it so you can edit 
it, print the deposit slip or send a receipt. Here’s how to locate a batch deposit:
1.	 Go to Accounts → Bank Accounts and select the relevant bank account 
the batch deposit was associated with.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      165
2.	 Click the Search button on the right side, and search for Payment: 
multiple items in the Description or Contact Name field.
A list of batch deposits appears. Click through on the relevant one.
Printing a deposit slip for a batch deposit
You can print a deposit slip from a batch deposit, and present it to the bank with 
the cheques. Here’s how:
1.	 Find the applicable deposit.
Refer to the preceding section for help with this.
2.	 Click on the relevant batch deposit, and select the Print Deposit PDF 
button on the top right.
The Print Deposit Summary button appears.
3.	 Click the green Print Now button.
The Deposit Summary can be located in your download folder and can be 
printed from there.
Sending a batch deposit receipt to customers
You can print or email a customer receipt from a batch deposit. Here’s how:
1.	 Find the applicable deposit.
Refer to the section ‘Locating a batch deposit’ for help with this.
2.	 Click on the relevant batch deposit, and select the Send Receipt button 
on the top right.
The Send Receipt window appears (see Figure 6-5).
3.	 Check that the email recipients, listed in the Email field, are correct.
Edit or add additional email recipients, using a comma (,) to separate. Uncheck 
the boxes against customers you don’t want to send a receipt to.
4.	 Select a branded theme from the drop-down options and then click the 
Use Branded Theme line.
Refer to ‘Customising the Branding Theme’, earlier in this chapter, for direction 
on branding themes.
5.	 Check and edit the Email template (if necessary).
See the later section ‘Taking Advantage of Email Templates’ for guidance on 
email templates.

166      PART 2  Daily Activities
6.	 Check and edit the Subject Line and Message (if necessary).
The Subject Line and Message are sourced from the email template, so assess 
whether the template needs to be edited for future use before making 
changes to this version. Remember this is an opportunity to thank a paying 
customer, and encourage them to re-use your services.
7.	 Check the box beside Send Me a Copy.
8.	 Click the green Send button.
This sends the receipt to your customer.
Removing allocated payments
You may find you’ve assigned a payment to an invoice and then need to remove it, 
because you need to change the details of the invoice or the payment was allocated 
incorrectly. To ‘unallocate’ a payment, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the Sales dashboard, click on Accounts → Sales, click the Search 
button on the right side, and use the criteria options that have appeared 
to search for the invoice.
2.	 Locate the invoice and drill down on it to see the invoice’s details.
3.	 Click on the relevant Less Payment hyperlink and the corresponding 
dollar amount at the bottom of the column headed Amount.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      167
The Payment Transaction window appears. If multiple payments have been 
assigned, multiple lines of payment transactions will appear, and each one 
needs to be individually removed.
4.	 On the relevant payment transaction, click on the Options button, and 
from the drop-down menu select Remove & Redo.
The payment is removed from the bill. If additional payments need to be 
removed, click your web browser’s back arrow twice and then refresh the 
screen to see the current transaction details. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to remove 
additional payments.
Taking Advantage of Email Templates
I engaged a funky young local graphic designer to do some work for an organisa-
tion I was working with. Her work was superb and I would happily recommend her 
to other contacts — until I got a two-page email from her, consisting of unrelent-
ing personalised abuse advising me I was late in paying her bill. I pay my bills on 
a timely basis. All my bills! So this was a shock to me. I reviewed incoming cor-
respondence and it turned out I had received an email from her but it included a 
foreign attachment created in specialised graphic software. Unbeknown to me I 
didn’t have the required software so I couldn’t read her attachment, and had no 
idea it was an invoice. Sadly, her unnecessary email destroyed our professional 
relationship and any future business dealings. If only she’d thought about how to 
chase outstanding invoices while in a calm frame of mind.
Recognising businesses need to deal with similar situations, Xero allows you to 
create customisable email templates to deal with typical business scenarios, such 
as the following:
»
» Here’s your invoice!
»
» Here’s your invoice — it’s due for payment soon!
»
» Here’s your invoice — payment is overdue!!
»
» Hey! Have you forgotten about my invoice?
»
» Has your dog eaten my invoice???
Alternatively, you can use the automated Invoice Reminders feature provided by 
Xero (see the later section ‘Setting up invoice reminders’ for details on this).

168      PART 2  Daily Activities
Documents can be emailed to contacts directly from within Xero. You don’t need 
to have an email system on your desktop — you can log in to Xero anywhere in the 
world, email contacts, and opt to have a copy of the email sent to you. Draft 
­templates are created by default, and you can override this to suit your 
requirements.
Defining your user email addresses
I’ve a client who oversees the operations of three separate businesses. She has a 
separate email address for each business, but accesses each of the three Xero 
business files with the same email login — her own personal email address. When 
she generates correspondence from the Xero business file, or receives email 
replies, she wants them to be associated with the individual business email 
address — not her personal email address.
Xero can be customised so her user name is associated with a different email 
address from within Xero. This means all correspondence sent from the individual 
Xero files can reflect the different businesses. This avoids confusion and tames 
email correspondence — and customers never know BrazilianBetty@Dmail.com 
is the logged-in user sending invoices from the business Xero file!
To add an email address to your user profile, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to Settings → General Settings → Email Settings.
The Email Settings window opens (see Figure 6-6). The top bar informs you the 
name of the logged-in user and the email address any replies from the 
correspondence will be sent to. (Replies will be sent back to this address even if 
they are sent from a different address.)
2.	 Click the blue Edit hyperlink at the end of the bar, and then click + Add 
Email Address hyperlink.
The Add a New Reply Email Address window opens. Enter the preferred email 
address in the Reply To email address field. Enter the name in the Name field 
and click the green Add Email button. The email holder receives an email from 
Xero notifying them that their email address has been added and, once they 
approve it, the preferred email address can be linked to any outgoing corre-
spondence from the Xero file.
3.	 Refresh the screen, select the default email address for the organisation 
and select the green Save button.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      169
Creating a new email template
To create an email template to follow up on an overdue invoice, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to Settings → General Settings → Email Settings → Template, click Edit 
and click the + Add Email Templates hyperlink.
The Add an Email Template window opens.
2.	 Select Sales Invoice from the Type drop-down menu.
Other options here relevant to the Sales area include: Credit Note, Purchase 
Order, Quote, Remittance Advice, Repeating Invoice, Statement and Receipt.
3.	 Enter the name FollowUp in the Name field.
This labels the email template as suitable to send with an overdue invoice.
4.	 Leave the box next to Default unchecked.
If you tick the box next to Default, this template would then become the 
default email sent with all invoices — which you don’t want in this case because 
this email is only suitable to send when invoices are overdue.
5.	 Complete the Subject Line and Message Body fields.
Insert the words ‘FOLLOW UP:’ at the start of the invoice message before 
working on the body of the message.
FIGURE 6-6: 
The Email 
Settings window.

170      PART 2  Daily Activities
Placeholders can be inserted into the template. They autopopulate with 
relevant data when the email becomes live. For example, the placeholder 
[Invoice Total] populates with the actual numerical total of the invoice. Pretty 
awesome! Each template type has its own relevant placeholders that can be 
used to customise the message body of the invoice. So check out the options 
that work best for you.
Here’s some sample text you could use in the message body:
Dear [Contact Name],
I wanted to check that you have received Invoice [Invoice Number] for 
[Invoice Total].
Can you please reply to this email to let me know that you have received 
the invoice?
Thank you,
<enter your name here>
[Trading Name]
6.	 Click the green Save button.
The email template has been saved and can be selected when you email an 
invoice.
Deleting customised templates
If you need to delete a customised email template, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to Settings → General Settings → Email Settings → Template, click Edit, 
click on the email templates not marked DEFAULT and, at the bottom, 
select Delete Template.
The Delete Email Template confirmation window opens.
2.	 Click the blue Yes button.
Connecting with contacts via social media
If you thought invoicing couldn’t get any better (refer to preceding sections if you 
need convincing), the cherry on the top of email templates is the ability to person-
alise invoicing with social media. For social media addicts like me, this feature is 
pretty cool. Yes — you can tweet me to tell me you have paid my invoice, from 
within the invoice! What a connected world we live in!

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      171
To add social media links to your invoicing, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on Settings → General Settings → Organisation Settings, scroll to 
the bottom of the page, click on the + Add Contact field, select required 
options from the drop-down list and enter your social media links in 
the fields.
Note: Mobile, fax and direct dial in (DDI) information can be added via this 
process.
2.	 Enter the vanity name of the business’s social media sites in the relevant 
fields.
If you don’t want an icon on your invoice, don’t complete the field. If you have 
your own personal social media presence, think about whether you want to 
include it here. Do you want businesses to know the real you?
Following Up on Outstanding Debtors
Receiving monies owed to the business in a timely manner is critical for the sur-
vival of your business. And you can utilise a number of features of your accounting 
system to help you follow up with outstanding debtors, including the following:
»
» The Invoice Reminders feature can automatically remind customers to pay, 
with options around how often you send a reminder, who you send the 
reminder to, and what amounts owing can trigger a reminder.
»
» Xero’s Dashboard highlights what money is owing. You can then drill down 
through the graphs to detailed invoicing information.
»
» The Sales dashboard highlights overdue invoices, and provides the contact 
details of who to call about the invoice.
»
» The Contacts area allows you to maintain comprehensive information about 
customers, including communication details — keep in mind that having 
multiple avenues you can use to contact customers when invoices are unpaid 
is very useful.
»
» The History & Notes area automatically maintains an audit trail against the 
contact. Furthermore, additional notes can be manually added. This can help 
you profile the payment habits of customers — for example, if they typically 
don’t pay during school holidays, invoice them early!
Refer to Chapter 5 for more on contacts and the History & Notes section.

172      PART 2  Daily Activities
As well as the features in the preceding list, Xero also offers two types of state-
ments that can be sent to customers as a reminder that monies are outstanding.
You should undertake a review of your overdue accounts, and areas within Xero 
such as your Aged Receivables report, on a monthly basis. See Chapter  10 for 
details on this.
Your accounting system is essential for keeping on top of outstanding debts; 
­however, the personal touch always works a charm when getting people to pay up 
and remain your customers. Hiding behind terse emails is not a nice way to run a 
business. Keep communications civilised and professional and always check the 
basics first — for example, make sure customers actually have your invoice before 
you scream at them about a missed payment! Also, make sure your recording of 
payments received is up to date (refer to the earlier section ‘Recording Payments’), 
so you can be sure your outstanding invoice details are accurate.
Setting up invoice reminders
Invoice reminders are a tool for improving cashflow in the business. Once you’ve 
set these up and defined your parameters for chasing cash owed, they’re a hands-
free way to gently prompt clients about outstanding money owed. After all, busi-
nesses are busy, and sometimes supplier bills slip to the bottom of the to-do list.
Invoice reminders help to keep the cash collection process low-maintenance, and 
they allow you to begin a dialogue with clients if they require further clarification 
on what’s owed. Depending on your business model, you may decide to send out a 
quick succession of reminders, or choose not to send any reminders until suppli-
ers are 60 days overdue — or a mixture of both. It’s usually smart to start com-
munications with customers early so that you can sort out any issues quickly: for 
example, by making sure that you’re sending the invoice to the appropriate per-
son for approval.
To set up invoice reminders, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on Settings → General Settings → Invoice Settings → Invoice 
Reminders.
The Invoice Reminders dashboard opens.
2.	 Click the checkbox beside ‘Email customers when an invoice is . . .’.
The area becomes active. You see four boxes labelled as follows: 7 Days 
Overdue, 14 Days Overdue, 21 Days Overdue and + Add Reminder.

CHAPTER 6  Managing Your Sales      173
3.	 Click Edit on the box you require; for example, ‘7 Days Overdue’.
The Edit Reminder window opens. Along the top, it reads ‘Send if an invoice 
is . . .’, and from the drop-down menu your options are Overdue By and Due In. 
Select the option you require (for example Due In), and in the next field enter 
the number of days you want to send reminders by. Selecting 2 in the case of 
selecting Due In results in a proactive reminder being sent out two days before 
the invoice is due to be paid.
Refer to the earlier section ‘Creating a new email template’ for guidance on 
editing the template.
You can add and customise up to five different email reminders.
4.	 Click the checkbox beside ‘Include a link to the invoice PDF’.
5.	 Click the checkbox beside ‘Don’t send reminders for amounts on an 
invoice under . . .’, and in the field enter 20.00.
By checking this box, you ensure that invoice reminders aren’t sent if the 
invoice is under your currency value of 20.00. The maximum value here is 
9999.99. If you’re owed those sorts of sums, it may be worth calling your client!
To stop Xero sending reminders for a certain invoice, open the invoice, click on 
the Invoice Options button, and select Turn Invoice Reminders Off.
To stop reminders being sent for a specific contact, open the Contacts dashboard 
and access the customers group by clicking on Customers on the right side. Click 
in the checkbox to the right of the customer, and then click the downward-facing 
arrow beside Invoice Reminders to access the drop-down menu. From here, select 
Turn Off Invoice Reminders. To turn reminders back on, go back to Invoice 
Reminders and click Turn On from the drop-down menu.
Making use of statements
Statements let customers know what invoices have been issued and how payment 
has been receipted. Two types of statements are available in Xero: Activity and 
Outstanding.
Activity statements are issued for a defined period, and display all activity for that 
period. They’re useful if you want to detail how payment has been applied to pre-
vious outstanding invoices.
Outstanding statements are issued as at a defined date and display all outstanding 
activity as at that date. These are useful if you simply want to let customers know 
how much is outstanding without confusing them with the detail.

174      PART 2  Daily Activities
If I’m chasing payment from a customer, and I’ve sent the customer multiple 
invoices, to avoid any confusion I send the customer an Activity statement so she 
can reconcile what she has paid me to date.
Once you’ve sent a statement (Activity or Outstanding), the contact’s History & 
Notes section is updated to reflect this. Live links are not an option with 
statements.
Creating an Activity statement
To create an Activity statement, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the Sales dashboard and click the Send Statement button.
2.	 Select Activity from the Statement Type field.
3.	 Enter the From and To period in the calendar fields and click the blue 
Update button.
This assigns the statement period.
4.	 Click the check box to the left of the customer row for the required 
customer(s).
One or many customers can be selected at this point.
5.	 Print or email the statement.
Follow the same steps as for printing or emailing invoices (refer to the section 
‘Sending an invoice to a customer’, earlier in this chapter, for more information).
Creating an Outstanding statement
To create an Outstanding statement, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the Sales dashboard and click the Send Statements button.
2.	 Select Outstanding from the Statement Type field drop-down options.
3.	 Click in the calendar field and check the box marked Default to Today’s 
Date, and then click the blue Update button.
4.	 Click the check box to the left of the customer row for the required 
customer(s).
One or many customers can be selected at this point.
5.	 Print or email the statement.
Follow the same steps as for printing or emailing invoices (refer to the section 
‘Sending an invoice to a customer’, earlier in this chapter, for more information).

Managing Your Payables
I
 work with a client who leads an active and generous life. While she often posts 
funny photos of herself on Facebook, showing her enjoying her next crazy 
adventure, she has always worked hard — really hard! She sent her kids to pri-
vate school, owned a lovely house and led an enviable life — and then, in a matter 
of a few months, lost everything. What happened? It sounds very simple, but she 
lost track of the bills. She overlooked paying suppliers, and soon unpaid suppliers 
stopped providing stock — and she was no longer able to run her business.
Inspirationally, the story has a great ending. She refocused her energies on under-
standing her numbers, took over the bookkeeping, and embraced her business 
reports. Over time, she repaid her debts — all of them — and slowly rebuilt her 
business. She’s now re-engaged a bookkeeper; however, at any point in time, she 
prides herself on knowing exactly how much money she owes her suppliers.
Xero can help you avoid the same pitfalls. In this chapter, I provide everything you 
need to understand your own debts, starting with working your way through 
Xero’s Purchases dashboard. I provide tips on utilising purchase orders, keeping 
track of bills and paying them in a timely manner, and finish off with advice on 
entering your expense claims into Xero.

176      PART 2  Daily Activities
Navigating the Purchases Dashboard
If all your bills are processed through the Purchases area (see the nearby sidebar 
‘Understanding your records’ for more on this), the first thing you need to know 
to manage your payables is: What do I owe? Xero gathers all that information on 
the Purchases dashboard, which you can access from the home dashboard by 
clicking Accounts → Purchases. (Figure 7-1 shows the Purchases dashboard, high-
lighting the features that are available if you process all bills through the ­purchases 
area.)
If you process all bills through Xero’s purchases area, the Purchases dashboard is 
split into three blocks: Buttons, menu bar and a bar chart.
The first block of the Purchases dashboard contains three buttons: New, Import 
and Search. The New button allows you to click through to create a New Bill, 
Repeating Bill, Credit Note and Purchase Order. The Import button begins the 
import process (covered in Chapter 3).
Clicking on the Search button opens the search pane. Here you can enter an 
amount, reference, contact name and/or dates criteria to search for bills or pur-
chase orders.
The second block of the Purchases dashboard contains seven tabs: Paid, Repeat-
ing, See All, Draft, Awaiting Approval, Awaiting Payment, and Overdue. Here’s 
how you can explore this area:

dashboard.

CHAPTER 7  Managing Your Payables      177
UNDERSTANDING YOUR RECORDS
The information available in Xero’s Purchases dashboard depends on how you choose 
to process bills. If all payments originate through transactions imported via the banks 
(either through live bank feeds or manually importing statements — refer to Chapter 4), 
you’re unlikely to have any data here. If occasional payments, such as tax payments, 
payroll or capital purchases are made via the Purchases area, you can access some lim-
ited information. If all bills are processed through the Purchases area, you can access 
lots of information through the Purchases dashboard, giving you insight into when and 
to whom you owe money. This can assist in cash flow planning and future negotiations 
with suppliers.
Businesses using cash accounting may never need to look at Xero’s Purchases area. 
(Cash accounting is where income and expenditure are recognised when cash is actually 
received or paid.) If your purchases are made against bank cards — so they’re easily 
­recognised and reconciled within Xero (see Chapter 8) — maybe you too don’t need to 
use the Purchases dashboard. Of course, if following this method, you need to keep 
tight control of your finances and know exactly how your cash flow is looking.
If you’re using accrual accounting, or want to include comprehensive details within Xero 
of the big ticket items you’ve purchased, or want complete control of your spending, 
read on. (Accrual accounting is where income and expenditure are recognised when the 
actual transaction occurs — that is, the date of the transaction, not when the cash is 
received or paid.) If not, this chapter may not be relevant to you and you can skip to a 
chapter more applicable to your business methods.
Remember: Your focus should always be on creating accurate records, not creating 
extra work!

INTERPRETING ICONS
Getting to know the icons used in the Sales & Purchases area is useful, and can help you 
move quickly through your payments. Here’s a list of the icons Xero uses and what they 
mean:
•	 File symbol: A PDF or image is stored within Xero
•	 Rectangle with yellow dot: A credit note has been applied
•	 Yellow CR: Credit note
•	 Slash through icon: The transaction has been voided.
•	 Red cross through icon: The transaction has been deleted.

CHAPTER 7  Managing Your Payables      179
Managing Your Supplier Bills
The mining boom has brought many interesting businesses to Brisbane, Australia 
(where my business is based). One such business, and a client of mine, is an export 
business that helps other businesses source large pieces of mining equipment. 
Everyone in the office speaks French, they make the strongest coffee imaginable, 
and they tell me where to find authentic French food in Brisbane. (You may be 
surprised to find out that Brisbane has a thriving French community!) For this 
business’s owner, monitoring current and future purchases is a critical part of 
running his business. It helps him forecast cash flow expenditure and claim back 
consumer tax in a timely manner.
A respectful relationship with suppliers, which includes paying them according to 
their payment terms, is critical for business success. Tracking purchases via 
Xero’s Purchases dashboard helps you know what you owe and when it’s due, and 
can help you maintain and nurture these relationships.
The life cycle of a bill in Xero can include being created as a draft, being submitted 
for approval, awaiting approval, being approved, awaiting payment and, finally, 
applying payment. Xero also allows you to skip these steps and jump straight to 
the approval stage (or your bill starts off as a purchase order and, once approved, 
it can be copied into a bill). The following sections cover each of the basic stages. 
I also cover how to generate a purchase order, which you can use to detail agreed 
spends for products or services.
Creating a new bill
When you receive an invoice for payment, you need to ‘create’ that invoice as a bill 
in Xero. Follow these steps to create a new bill within Xero:
1.	 Go to the Purchases dashboard by clicking Accounts → Purchases and 
select + New.
The New Bill window appears (see Figure 7-2).
2.	 Enter the contact name in the From field.
If the supplier is already in your Xero file, start typing the first three letters of 
the contact name and Xero autosuggests contact names and their associated 
primary contact person’s first name, last name and email address. Select the 
relevant contact, or type in the name of a new contact. (Refer to Chapter 5 for 
guidance on adding Contact details.)

180      PART 2  Daily Activities
If an existing unbilled purchase order has been assigned to the supplier, 
notification appears above the bill, and you can save time by bringing the 
purchase order details into a bill. If there’s a single unbilled purchase order, 
click the blue Copy Line Items hyperlink, and at the Copy Purchase Order to Bill 
window, check the box Mark as Billed and click the green OK button. If there 
are multiple unbilled purchase orders, select View as a List and a new tab on 
your browser opens at the Purchase Orders dashboard, where you can select 
the purchase order you may want to convert to a bill. Discard the original bill 
you were working with. See the section ‘Generating a purchase order’, later in 
this chapter.
3.	 Enter the Date in the date calendar box.
Today’s date automatically appears; you should override this with the actual 
bill date, if it’s different.
4.	 Enter the bill Due Date.
5.	 Enter the optional bill Reference field.
Purchase bills are not automatically numbered. You can use the text field for a 
mnemonic reference, or to repeat the supplier bill number or the name of the 
contact who issued the bill.
6.	 Scan a copy of the bill and attach it to the transaction via the document 
symbol.
The scanned copy is stored in a retrievable format.
Many countries allow records to be stored in digital format, and the practice is 
environmentally friendly too! Just check with your country’s tax regulations to 
make sure maintaining digital records is acceptable.
Select the bill currency from the drop-down Currency field options.

CHAPTER 7  Managing Your Payables      181
7.	Enter the total bill amount in the Total field.
If left blank, the Total field autofills the first time the bill is saved. If you 
subsequently update the transaction, you need to manually change the Total 
field.
8.	Select the consumer tax status of the bill from the drop-down Amounts 
Are field options.
The three options are Tax Exclusive, Tax Inclusive and No Tax (refer to 
Chapter 6 for an explanation of these options).
9.	Enter or select the inventory item from the optional Item field.
To add text from the supplier’s last recorded bill in Xero, click the hyperlink Add 
Last Item under the Contact field. You can edit them when the lines appear 
on the bill. A message appears momentarily at the top of the screen with the 
option to undo this action — but you have to be quick to click on it!
The other fields populate with the item details. Refer to Chapter 13 for 
guidance on setting up inventory items.
10.	Enter a comprehensive narrative in the mandatory Description field.
Include as much information as possible, such as dates, contacts, work 
completed and/or items supplied. Keeping serial numbers and warranty 
information here is also useful for future reference. Because this field is 
mandatory, if you’ve nothing to say just add a full stop.
11.	Fill in the mandatory Qty and Unit Price fields.
If the sale is for a fixed-price product or a service, enter the quantity as 1, and 
the full price in the unit price column.
12.	Enter the account name or number and select the desired account from 
the suggested drop-down list for the mandatory Account field.
After a bill has been issued and money paid against it, the From, Due Date, 
Reference, Branding Theme, Description, Account and Tracking fields are the 
only fields that you can still edit from within the bill.
13.	Select the desired rate from the mandatory Tax Rate field.
14.	Select from options in the drop-down menus in the available Tracking 
fields (if available).
Tracking is optional, and you won’t see the field if the feature is not set up. 
See Chapter 12 for guidance on setting up Tracking fields. The amount field 
can’t be edited. The subtotal, consumer tax and total automatically calculate. 
Populate the remaining rows with purchase information as needed. Note: In 
Figure 7-2 the Tracking field is called ‘Region’. Your Tracking field could be 
labelled something different.

182      PART 2  Daily Activities
15.	Click the Add a New Line button (as required).
This allows you to add additional lines to the body of the bill.
16.	To on-charge the bill, click the Assign Expenses to a Customer link.
The Assign a Customer to Any Billable Expense window opens. You see three 
columns: Description, Amount (tax excl) and Customer. For each line of the 
bill, you have three options: Leave blank, select a customer, or select Decide 
Customer Later. To confirm your selection, click the blue OK button. You can 
also come back and edit your customer selection, or add a customer later. If 
there are multiple rows of expenses, each row can individually be assigned to 
different customers.
The billable expense details appear on the bill.
When a sale is raised to a customer tagged with the billable expense, the link 
Billable Expenses Can Be Added appears. Click the option you require to assign 
the expense lines.
17.	Save the bill.
Xero gives you a number of options:
•	 If you want to just save the bill, click the blue Save button.
•	 To save the bill as a draft, click the drop-down arrow beside the blue Save 
button, and select Save as Draft. (The bill is now listed under the Draft tab.)
•	 To save the bill and continue editing, click the drop-down arrow beside the 
blue Save button, and select Save (Continue Editing).
•	 To save the bill and submit for approval, click the drop-down arrow beside 
the blue Save button, and select Save & Submit for Approval. (The bill is 
now listed under the Awaiting Approval tab.)
•	 To save the bill and then create a new bill, click the drop-down arrow 
beside the blue Save button, and select Save & Add Another.
Approving and cancelling bills
A lawyer I know spent a few weeks in bed recovering from a severe bout of pneu-
monia. As he lay there, with nothing to do but think, he mulled over his business 
performance. He wondered why the cash situation was so tight when he had been 
so busy. When he returned to work, he took a careful look at the books. The ami-
able bookkeeper, who regularly baked scrummy cakes for the office, had been 
siphoning off a considerable sum of the money from the business. Combining a 
gambling habit with forged cheques and erasable ink sooner or later ends up with 
a visit to jail.

CHAPTER 7  Managing Your Payables      183
Any bank accounts through which cash leaves the business should be appropri-
ately approved. In a micro or small business, approval of all payments may be the 
responsibility of the owner. In a larger business, different approval levels may be 
in place — for example:
»
» A junior manager is responsible for approving payments up to $1,000.
»
» A senior manager is responsible for approving payments up to $5,000.
The active word in the preceding examples is responsible. Approving payments 
should be treated with the utmost of importance and undertaken in a considered 
manner. Anything less may have a detrimental effect on cash flow. Within Xero, 
users who can approve a bill are those within the following user levels:
»
» Adviser
»
» Standard
»
» Invoice Only with the Option to Approve & Pay, or Purchases Only
Approving
When approving a bill, you have a number of options:
»
» Simply approve the bill by clicking the green Approve button.
»
» To approve the bill and then create a new bill, click the drop-down arrow 
beside the green Approve button and select Approve & Add Another.
»
» To approve the Draft or Awaiting Approval bill and view the next bill — if there 
is another one awaiting — (Draft or Awaiting Approval respectively), click the 
drop-down arrow beside the green Approve button and select Approve & 
View Next.
Once a bill is approved it is filed in the Awaiting Payment area.
Cancelling, deleting or voiding
Here’s how to cancel, delete or void a bill, dependent on the status of the bill:
»
» If you want to cancel the bill during the original creation stage, click the grey 
Cancel button.
»
» To delete a Draft or Awaiting Approval bill, from the home dashboard click 
Accounts → Purchases and then drill down on either the Draft or Awaiting 

184      PART 2  Daily Activities
Approval option, check the box beside the relevant bill and select the Delete 
button. At the Confirm window, click the green OK button, and the status of 
the bill reverts to Deleted.
»
» To void a bill Awaiting Payment or Paid, first any payment made against the bill 
needs to be removed (see ‘Removing allocated payments’, later in this chapter). 
The status of both types of bills now reverts to Awaiting Payment, with no 
assigned payment allocation. Click on the bill detail, select the Bill Options 
button, and from the drop-down menu select Void. At the Confirm window, 
select the green OK button and the status of the bill reverts to Voided.
The details of a cancelled bill disappear entirely, while the erased details of deleted 
and voided bills can be found by searching under the grouping labelled All, click-
ing the Search button and checking the Include Deleted & Voided tick box.
If you click the Cancel button on a bill, no confirmation window appears, so you 
don’t have a chance to back out. The bill is gone forever.
Generating a purchase order
While living in Cheltenham, I worked for an organisation that closely monitored 
promotional spends against budget. This process involved raising a detailed inter-
nal purchase order. The purchase order needed to be authorised by appropriate 
personnel, and my role involved checking the proposed account allocations.
A purchase order is a document detailing agreed spends for products or services. 
Internally, it monitors and controls spending; externally, it provides suppliers 
with authorisation to deliver their good and services.
The Purchase Orders dashboard is found below the Bills dashboard on the Pur-
chases dashboard. It’s quite sparse until you’ve created some purchase orders, but 
this section covers what it can include once it’s populated.
The high-level Purchase Orders dashboard is split into two blocks: Buttons and a 
menu bar. Click the blue See All hyperlink to see a detailed Purchase Orders dash-
board. At the top is a button for creating new purchase orders and across the top 
are five tabs: All, Draft, Awaiting Approval, Approved and Billed (see Figure 7-3).
Clicking the + New Purchase Order button brings up the Purchase Order form (see 
Figure 7-4). The steps for creating a new purchase order mirror the steps for cre-
ating a new bill — refer to the section ‘Creating a new bill’, earlier in this chapter. 
However, you need to be aware of the following three different options:

CHAPTER 7  Managing Your Payables      185
»
» Delivery Date: This field offers a pop-up calendar, and above it are four 
blocks: Today, + 7 days, + 14 days and + 30 days. Click on + 30 days and the 
field populates with a delivery date 30 days after the purchase order date.
»
» Order Number: This autogenerates from the default invoice settings. Refer to 
Chapter 6 for more insight into this.
»
» Theme: Check if your existing themes are appropriate. If they’re not, you may 
need to create a dedicated purchase order template. Further information 
about themes and templates can be found in Chapter 6.
The block at the base of the purchase order includes fields for the Delivery Address, 
general contact details and Delivery Instructions.
The Delivery Address and Attention fields populate from the Organisation Settings 
existing information. To change the Delivery Address, click on the drop-down 
options and select from None, + Add New Address, + Add One-off Address, + Search 
from Contacts, Postal and Physical.
The Delivery Instructions field is a 500-character text field where you can include 
specific instructions for the delivery company — so, for example, you can let the 
delivery person know to bring your goods to the red door at the back of the build-
ing while navigating the guard dogs!
Like a bill, a purchase order can be saved or approved.
Although a little less exciting than cicadas emerging from underground after 
17 years, understanding the life cycle of the purchase order is worthwhile. If you 
opted to save the purchase order as Draft, under the Draft tab, you have the option 
to Submit for Approval, Approve, Print, Send or Delete it.
At any stage in the purchase order’s life cycle, you can click on the Purchase Order, 
click the Options button, select Copy To . . . and copy the contents to a draft Bill, 
Purchase Order or Sales Invoice.

Orders

186      PART 2  Daily Activities
Once a purchase order is Awaiting Approval, under the Awaiting Approval tab you 
have the option to Approve, Print, Send or Delete it (refer to Figure 7-3).
Under the Approved tab, you have the Billed, Print, Send or Copy To options. The 
Billed option marks the purchase order as billed, but does not create a bill from 
this. Once a purchase order has been marked as billed, under the Billed tab, you 
have the option to Print, Send or Copy the order.
Making Payments
You can use Xero several ways to record payments: Recording individual pay-
ments, preparing batch payments or linking payments against bills directly from 
within your Bank Reconciliation dashboard. The following sections take you 
through the first two options (turn to Chapter  8 for more on bank 
reconciliations).
FIGURE 7-4:

Order form.

CHAPTER 7  Managing Your Payables      187
Recording an individual payment
To record a full or partial payment against a bill, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the Purchases dashboard and click Accounts → Purchases.
Bills need to be approved for payment before payment can be applied against 
them.
2.	 Select the bill to pay by drilling down through the Awaiting Payment tabs 
and click through to the detail of the bill.
The bottom of the bill features the Make a Payment block (see Figure 7-5).
3.	 Fill out the Amount Paid field.
4.	 Fill out the Date Paid calendar field.
5.	 Select the general ledger account the payment is to be made from using 
the drop-down list in the Paid From field.
Payment may be made from your bank, credit card or PayPal account, or any 
account set up to enable payments from this account (such as an intercom-
pany loan account). Refer to Chapter 2 for guidance on customising general 
ledger accounts.
6.	 Enter a useful reference in the optional Reference field.
This reference won’t be picked up in search results, but it can be seen on some 
reports.
7.	 Check the box beside the Pay by Check (US) (or Cheque, in Canada) field 
(if required).
Only United States and Canadian users have this feature (see the sidebar 
‘Payments made by check’ for more).
8.	 Click the green Add Payment button.
At the top of the screen, a green tick appears, along with confirmation details 
of the payment and a blue View Bill — Send Remittance Advice link. See the 
section ‘Sending remittance advice’, later in this chapter, for guidance on how 
to do this.
If the Pay by Check field was selected, the Pay by Check window opens.
FIGURE 7-5: 
The Make a 
Payment block.

188      PART 2  Daily Activities
The information on the check autofills, and the Check # and Pay To fields can 
be overridden. For traceability, adding further information to the optional 
Memo field is good practice.
9.	Click the blue Edit link to add or edit the recipient’s address details.
10.	Click the drop-down arrow at the Check Style field to select a check 
template style (if required).
See the section ‘Stylising your check’, later in this chapter, for information on 
different check styles.
11.	Select your print and/or save options.
You have three options: Save & Print PDF, Save, and Cancel. To print a check, 
click Save & Print PDF and, at the Print Check window, click Print Now.
The PDF of the check downloads to your computer’s download file. To finalise 
payment, email or mail it to the client.
Recording batch payments
Recording batch payments may not be as enticing as a batch of warm and gooey 
chocolate-chip cookies, but using this feature within Xero can really reduce 
­processing time.
Before processing batch payments, you need to have set up your bank accounts in 
Xero — refer to Chapter 2 for more on this. When preparing to make a payment, 
check that enough money is available in your business accounts. Check your bank 
account directly — the business account balances on the Xero dashboard may not 
include recent transactions.
PAYMENTS MADE BY CHECK
A check is a document authorising the bank to pay the named recipient money from the 
payee’s account. Two common spellings for this document are used: cheque (UK and 
Canada spelling) and check (US spelling). Because the feature in Xero was initially only 
available to US users, and it’s labelled Check, that’s the spelling I’m using here.
US and Canadian users can access the Checks dashboard to search and review checks, 
establish their current status, print to PDF, and void or delete checks if they are no 
longer valid or were created in error. When voiding a check, there is the option to 
choose the date you want the check to be voided on. From the Checks dashboard, you 
can also access the Spend Money button. To access the Checks dashboard, go to 
Accounts → Checks.

CHAPTER 7  Managing Your Payables      189
Creating a new batch payment
To record batch payments, follow these steps:
1.	 Check single or multiple bills to be paid in the Awaiting Payment area of 
the Purchases dashboard.
2.	 Click the Batch Payment or Make Payment button (for US and Canadian 
users).
The Confirm window opens.
For US and Canadian users, the Make Payment window opens with three 
options: Pay By Check, Batch Payment and Pay with Bill.com (US only).
3.	 Click the green OK or Batch Payment button (for US and Canadian users).
The New Batch Payment window opens (see Figure 7-6).
4.	 Enter the date payment will be made in the mandatory Payment Date 
calendar.
5.	 Select the account that payments will be made from in the mandatory 
Bank Account field at the top of the window.
6.	 Enter supplier bank account details in the Bank Account column.
Once a bank account has been allocated to a supplier payment, this account 
will save and be available the next time you make a batch payment. If you 
intend to use this process to transfer payments electronically, you must 
complete this field — see the next section.
7.	 Enter a payment or supplier reference in the optional Details field.
Details added to the optional Details field will appear on your bank statement.
FIGURE 7-6: 
The New Batch 
Payment window.

190      PART 2  Daily Activities
8.	 If required, override the amount to be paid in the Payment column.
The amount outstanding for the bill autofills in the payment field; however, if 
you’re simply making a part-payment or deposit, override the amount.
9.	 Click the green Make Payments button.
The batch payment is created.
Exporting a batch file to your bank
If you’ve never created a bank file, take a few moments to get your head around 
the process; it may save you a huge amount of time! A bank file is a file that can be 
uploaded to your internet banking. Payments are processed in Xero, and details of 
those payments (including full bank account details) are exported via a bank file. 
You then import the bank file into your online banking. But don’t worry  —  
­importing the file does not result in payments going out from your account like 
automatic balls from a baseball-pitching machine. Once the bank file is imported, 
you can see full details of pending payments and authorise them accordingly.
Note: Prior to being able to upload files to your bank, you need to contact your 
bank and let staff know you want to upload electronic bank files. Staff can then 
enable this feature. Depending on the bank, staff may need to provide you with a 
security code device and a direct entry user ID, and let you know if you need to 
include a self-balancing transaction.
After a payment is processed within Xero (refer to preceding sections), follow 
these steps to export a bank file:
1.	 Click Export Batch File from the batch payment window.
The bank file is downloaded to your computer.
Note: For this to work, business bank details and supplier bank details need to 
be entered into Xero.
2.	 Manually upload the file to your online internet banking.
Some financial institutions require you to use a banking security token at this 
stage. It generates a unique security code every few seconds. You need this 
code when you log in, along with your username and password.
3.	 Authorise the payments from within your internet banking.
After processing the bank file, you don’t need to store it, just delete it.

CHAPTER 7  Managing Your Payables      191
If you didn’t create a bank file immediately after the batch payment was pro-
cessed, you can return later to the payment. Locate it under the relevant bank 
account’s Account Transactions tab and click on the relevant payment (the 
Description is Payment: Multiple Items). At the top, you can access the Export 
Batch File button, and work through the preceding steps.
Removing allocated payments
You may find you’ve assigned a payment to a bill and then need to remove it, 
because you need to change the details of the bill or the payment was allocated 
incorrectly. To ‘unallocate’ a payment, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the Purchases dashboard, click on Accounts → Purchases, click the 
Search button on the right side, and use the criteria options that have 
appeared to search for the bill.
2.	 Locate the bill and drill down to see the bill detail.
3.	 Click on the relevant Less Payment hyperlink and the corresponding 
currency amount at the bottom of the column headed Amount.
The Payment transaction appears. If multiple payments have been assigned, 
there will be multiple lines of payment, and each one needs to be individually 
removed.
4.	 On the Payment transaction, click on the Options button, and select 
Remove & Redo from the drop-down menu.
The payment is removed from the bill. If additional payments need to be 
removed, click your web browser’s back arrow twice and then refresh the 
screen to see the current transaction details. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to remove 
additional payments.
Mastering Other Payment  
Considerations
As well as the basic functions of entering and approving bills, and making 
­payments, with Xero you can also master some more advanced options, such as 
working with repeating bills, scheduling payment and sending remittance advices. 
The following sections cover these aspects and more.

192      PART 2  Daily Activities
Printing bills
You’re unlikely to need to print the bill created in Xero on a regular basis, but if 
you ever need to, follow these steps to print your record of the supplier bills:
1.	 Go to the Purchases dashboard, drill down on the Awaiting Payment tab 
to find the relevant bill, and check the box to the left of the document(s).
A single bill or multiple bills can be selected and processed at the same time.
2.	 Click the blue Print button.
The Confirm window opens.
3.	 Click the green OK button.
The Print Bills window opens.
4.	 Click the green Print Now button.
You see a status window telling you that Xero is creating a PDF.
5.	 Print the PDF by clicking the Print icon in the upper-left corner.
Working with Repeating Bills
Unfortunately, many business bills arrive on an all-too-regular basis, but utilis-
ing Xero’s Repeating Bills function, which automatically generates new supplier 
bills based on a saved template, makes this a little less burdensome.
Once you’ve defined a Repeating Bill template, an automatic bill is created and 
saved as a draft or approved (as per the requirements you’ve defined within the 
template). Templates can be edited if terms change. All this results in you being 
able to use your valuable time to earn money rather than prepare bills!
To create a Repeating Bill, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the Purchases dashboard, click on the drop-down menu beside 
the + New button, and select the Repeating Bill option.
The New Repeating Bill window opens (see Figure 7-7).
FIGURE 7-7:

Repeating Bill 
window.

CHAPTER 7  Managing Your Payables      193
2.	 Fill out the Repeat this Transaction Every field.
You have a number of options here. For example, if you want the bill to repeat 
every month, enter 1 in the numeral field and select Month(s) from the 
drop-down menu.
3.	 Select the original Bill Date by clicking in the calendar field.
4.	 Define the repeating Bill Due date.
Again, you have a number of options here. For example, if you want the bill to 
be due on the 7th of the following month, enter 7 in the Due field and select Of 
the Following Month from the drop-down menu.
5.	 Fill out the optional End Date calendar field (if end date is known).
6.	 Click the file symbol and attach files relevant to the recurring 
transactions.
If the recurring transaction was for car lease payments, for example, you could 
attach the original supporting lease document here, and it would be associated 
with every transaction — without using up any extra storage space.
7.	 Select the Save as Draft or Approve option.
Selecting this option tells Xero whether you’d like the bill saved as a draft or 
approved when it generates, based on the dates you have entered.
Where the bill is the same every repeat instance, you would choose the option 
to approve. Where the bill might vary in value every instance — for example, 
a phone bill — you would choose to save it as a draft.
8.	 Fill out the remainder of the body of the bill by following the steps 
outlined in the section ‘Creating a new bill’, earlier in this chapter.
Use the reference field to give the bill an identifying name.
9.	 Save the template by clicking the green Save button.
The template is filed under the Repeating tab. When the bill is created, it 
indicates that it has been generated from a repeating transaction.
Scheduling payments
A business I worked for in London struggled to pay its bills. Suppliers sat in the 
reception area throughout the working day, desperate to collect what was owed to 
them. The situation was very depressing. As money was made available, it was 
released and applied to outstanding bills. The members of the Accounts Payable 
department had to pay close attention to who was to be paid. Suppliers with goods 
and services that were needed to keep the business operating were prioritised. 
Future payments were grouped together in bundles of £10,000 lots, so the 

194      PART 2  Daily Activities
business could easily identify and pay critical payments quickly. Batching future 
payments enabled the business to protect their cash flow during difficult times.
While this wasn’t a happy scenario for the suppliers, the payment system kept the 
business afloat and people employed.
Xero’s Schedule Payments feature enables you to develop a program of planned 
payments, helping you manage your cash flow. You’re able to see the total pay-
ments due on a particular day, and you can click on the date to see a list of scheduled 
payments planned for that day. Follow these steps to schedule future payments:
1.	 Check single or multiple bills to be paid in the Awaiting Payment area of 
the Purchases dashboard.
2.	 Click the Schedule Payment button and select the intended date in the 
calendar box.
The Planned Date column fills out with the selected data. Hovering beside the 
planned date reveals a blue plus and minus option and a red cross. Clicking 
the blue plus and minus options increases or decreases the date by one day. 
The date can be overridden by clicking it and selecting another date from the 
calendar box or erased by clicking the red cross.
Once you’ve entered future payments, a Schedule of Planned Payments block 
appears on the Purchases dashboard, with the payments grouped by payment 
dates. Each block clearly details the date and the total group payment. Click on the 
block to drill down to see the batch payments for that date.
Stylising your check
I was once told if you stamped the correct details on a cow, you could use the 
mammal in place of a typical paper-based check. Far easier to customise checks in 
Xero, and send them as payment!
Note: Only US and Canadian users can access the Checks dashboard in Xero and 
customise a check.
To customise a check, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to Settings → General Settings → Check Styles.
The Check Styles dashboard appears.
2.	 Click the Options button on the right.
Four options appear on the drop-down menu: Edit, Alignment, Copy and 
Upload Logo.

CHAPTER 7  Managing Your Payables      195
3.	 Click Edit.
The Edit Check Style window appears.
4.	 In the Name field, enter Company Check.
See if the address details are correct and leave all the other information as is.
5.	 Click the green Save button.
6.	 Set the check’s print area alignment in relation to the paper, by clicking 
the Options button and selecting Alignment.
The Check Alignment window opens (see Figure 7-8).
Note: After the first time of drilling through to Options (refer to Step 2), two 
additional options appear here: Remove Logo and Delete.
7.	 Align the check portion as required and click the green Save button.
Click in the Check area to activate the ability to edit the alignment. You have the 
option to click on the directional arrows, or enter absolute point values in the 
Top(y) and Left(x) box. Repeat this exercise for the Voucher area. Click the blue 
Reset button, if you need to start afresh.
The check doubles as a remittance advice, because it has room at the top for 
the check details and at the bottom is a voucher, with the reason for the 
payment. The recipient can give the check to the bank, and retain the voucher 
for record-keeping purposes.
8.	 Upload a logo to the stylised check by clicking the Options button and 
selecting Upload Logo.
9.	 Click Browse, select the logo, click Open and click the blue Upload button.

Sending remittance advice
A remittance advice notice lets your suppliers know that you’ve processed a pay-
ment against their bills, so they stop chasing you for payment! The notice details 
the supplier bills that payments have been applied against and can assist suppliers 
during their reconciliation process.
Send a remittance advice immediately after payment has been made by following 
these steps:
1.	 Click the Send Remittance Advice link or the Send Remittance button.
The Send Remittance Advice link appears at the top of the screen after making 
an individual payment and the Send Remittance button appears after making a 
batch payment.
Clicking the link or the button opens the Send Remittance Advice window.
If you need to resend a remittance advice, or didn’t send it directly after 
payment was made, access the Purchases dashboard and search for the 
relevant paid bill. Drill down to the detail, and click the blue Payment link on 
the bottom left. The Transaction: Payment window opens. At this stage you 
also have the option to View Remittance PDF, but it’s preferable to email it. 
Click Options → Send Remittance to access the Send Remittance Advice 
window. (This option isn’t available for US users.)
2.	 Fill out the Email Address field.
If the Contact already has an email address listed, it appears here. If an email 
address is entered as part of the remittance advice process, it is added to the 
contact’s details.
3.	 Select a remittance advice branded theme from the drop-down options 
for Use Branding Theme.
Refer to Chapter 6 for guidance on setting up branded themes.
4.	 Select an email template from the drop-down options for Email Template.
Refer to Chapter 6 for guidance on setting up email templates.
5.	 Edit the email Subject field and Message body as necessary.
6.	 Check the Send Me a Copy box.
This allows you to maintain a digital copy of correspondence.
Remittance advices are useful for reconciling purposes but, once I have receipted 
and reconciled payment, I shred any printed versions. I hate unnecessary paper!

CHAPTER 7  Managing Your Payables      197
Managing credit notes
If a change to a supplier bill occurs, you may request the supplier issues a credit 
note. The credit note can offset outstanding bills, or accompany a refund. (If you 
have accounting knowledge, then, yes, technically this is known as a debit note — 
don’t get confused by Xero’s terminology!)
To process a credit note, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the Purchases dashboard, click the drop-down arrow beside the + 
New button and click the Credit Note button.
2.	 Complete the details on the Credit Note screen.
Include a reference to what bill it is applied against, and enter positive values!
3.	 Save or approve the Credit Note.
Follow the same steps as with saving and approving bills (refer to the section 
‘Approving and cancelling bills’ earlier in this chapter, for more details).
If no outstanding supplier bill exists, the Approved Credit Note simply saves, 
and is listed on the Awaiting Payment grouping on the dashboard. If, at a 
future date, a bill is approved against the supplier, an Allocate Outstanding 
Credit? window opens, where you can select Allocate (or Skip if you don’t want 
to allocate now). Select Allocate and a window very similar to Figure 7-9 opens.
If, however, an outstanding supplier bill does exist, the Allocate Balance on 
Credit Note window automatically appears.
FIGURE 7-9: 
The Allocate 
Balance on Credit 
Note window.

198      PART 2  Daily Activities
4.	 If the credit note should be applied to this bill, allocate the amount 
accordingly.
In the example shown in Figure 7-9, the value of the credit note can be split 
across individual bills or treated as a cash refund. Once you enter the full credit 
amount against a bill, the Remaining Credit balance becomes zero.
Where a new bill was raised against an existing credit note, you only have the 
option to allocate the credit note amount to the recently raised bill.
5.	 Click the green Allocate Credit button.
The amount is applied to the Bill. Note: The amount allocated cannot be 
greater than the invoice.
Entering Expense Claims
In an ideal world, you’re able to enter all business transactions through your busi-
ness accounts and avoid cash transactions altogether; however, this rarely ends 
up being the case. Say, for example, an employee of your business fills the busi-
ness car up with $50 worth of petrol and then pays for it personally — so spends 
personal money on behalf of the business. The employee charging the purchase to 
a company credit card, so it then goes through the normal payment process, is 
preferable, but in real life that may not be feasible. Instead, the employee needs to 
claim the money back from the business and the payment needs to be processed 
as an ad hoc expense claim.
Processing expenses though Xero means your employees are responsible for 
entering their own expenses and are no longer bound to one petty cash tin (per-
haps kept at head office or locked away somewhere else). And accounts staff are 
freed of the time-consuming task of processing an old-fashioned, bothersome 
petty cash tin!
Xero’s Expense Claims dashboard (accessed via the bottom-right corner of the 
home dashboard) is where you process such claims. All claims need to go through 
the same process. A new expense claim is first added as a Draft claim. It then 
needs to be submitted for approval, approved, and authorised for payment. Finally, 
the claim is paid.
The Expense Claims summary dashboard (see Figure 7-10) contains four headings 
summarising the current status of expense claims, and an Add Receipt option.

CHAPTER 7  Managing Your Payables      199
Click through on the hyperlinks to drill down to the Expense Claims dashboard. 
Here’s a summary of the five headings on the Expense Claims dashboard (see 
Figure 7-11), and the information they provide:
»
» Current Claim: This field is context-sensitive to the user who has logged into 
Xero, so if you’re logged in, this field shows any expense claim you’ve lodged 
that’s still current. If you’re peeking over the shoulder of another user, this 
field displays that user’s current expense claim.
»
» Previous Claims: This field is the total of all the logged-in user’s current 
expense claims in the business. If you’re a micro business with only one user, 
this amount always equals the total shown under Your Current Claim. At this 
stage, you can’t access the underlying detail for the expense claims of other 
users.
»
» Awaiting Authorisation: This field details the total expense claims awaiting 
authorisation. The user must have the required authority level (assigned via 
their user role within Xero) to authorise and approve the expense claim.
»
» Awaiting Payment: This field details the total expense claims awaiting 
payment.
»
» Archive: This field lists archived expense claims.

200      PART 2  Daily Activities
Clicking the hyperlinks on the Expense Claims dashboard takes you through to the 
Expense Claims summary dashboard.
Several people may be involved in the processing of expense claims: The user who 
makes the claim, a first-level manager who authorises the claim, a second-level 
manager who approves the claim and the financial controller who makes the pay-
ment. Of course, if your business is very small, you may be wearing all the hats 
and performing most or even all these roles.
Adding a new expense claim
The process of claiming an expense starts with the user entering the payment as 
a New Receipt in Xero.
To enter a New Receipt, do the following:
1.	 Scan your receipt.
You don’t need to be able to upload a copy of your receipt to Xero to process 
your claim, but storing receipts safely is always a good idea — rather than 
leaving them on the car dashboard to fade away! Xero allows .pdf, .jpg, .png 
and .gif digital formats for the scanned receipts.
2.	 Go to the Expense Claims dashboard, go to Accounts → Expense Claims, 
and click the Add Receipt button.
The New Receipt window opens (see Figure 7-12). Multiple expenses can be 
entered and processed as a single batch at a later date.
FIGURE 7-12: 
The New Receipt 
window.

CHAPTER 7  Managing Your Payables      201
3.	 Attach a scanned copy of the receipt to the transaction by clicking on the 
document icon.
The source document is stored online in a retrievable format. This is an 
efficient method of storing source documents and legal in many jurisdictions. 
Plus, the expense approval process may require it. Check your own local laws 
and requirements. This step is optional but it’s a good habit to adopt.
4.	 Enter the relevant receipt data and save the transaction.
In the Receipt From field, enter the supplier name. If you have more than one 
receipt to enter, select the blue Save & Add Another Receipt button, return to 
Step 1 and repeat the process. To record a single receipt (or once you’ve 
entered your last claim), click on the green Save button.
Saving your last claim takes you to an expanded view of the Current Claim win-
dow, listing a summary of current expense claims. Note: The status of the claim at 
this stage will be Draft, and the claim now needs to be approved (see the section 
‘Submitting a claim for approval’, later in this chapter).
Making mobile expense claims
Keep on top of expenses while enjoying a latte by scanning and uploading expense 
receipts to Xero on your mobile device. (Now, to me, this sounds geektastic!)
Flatten your receipts and grab your mobile device — here’s how to upload the 
basics of an expense on your iPhone:
1.	 Tap on the Xero icon, enter your four-digit passcode or fingerprint and 
click the Receipts icon at the bottom of the screen.
A list of current receipts appears.
2.	 Click the + in the top-right corner of the screen.
If you’re adding subsequent purchases after this, you’ll just need to click the 
grey cross on the top right.
A receipt entry form appears.
3.	 Enter the purchase description in the first line of the What Was It For? 
field.
The field draws from popular receipts — so, you may be able to select an 
existing reason, or enter your own.

202      PART 2  Daily Activities
4.	 Enter your name in the Where’d You Spend? field.
The field draws from your existing list of contacts, so you may be able to select 
an existing contact. However, in reality, expense claims can come from lots of 
little suppliers that you don’t want populating your Contacts list, so you may 
prefer to just add your own name here and add the supplier name at Step 3 
(in the description field).
5.	 Select the date of the receipt when you click the Spent Today field.
6.	 In the How Did You Pay? field, select I Want to Be Repaid.
This receipt entry is for an expense claim. At this field, select the business 
account it was paid from and record it as a Spend Money transaction. You can 
also add a Tracking code if you know it; otherwise, leave the Tracking code field 
blank. (However, I suspect many employees are in a better position to know 
what account the expense should actually be allocated to than the book-
keeper, so allowing them to code expenses could be another time saver.)
7.	 Enter the amount, and edit the tax status of the Amounts, if required.
8.	 Click the grey Add Files button in the bottom-right corner. Three options 
appear: Take Photo, Choose Photo or Choose from Xero Files. Choose 
Take Photo and take a photo of the receipt.
The image of the receipt attaches itself to the claim. In many jurisdictions, this 
is a legally acceptable storage method for paper receipts. (If unsure, check with 
your accountant.)
Click the optional details section to access three additional options:
•	 Assign Expense to a Customer
•	 Split into Items & Quantities
•	 Add Reference
9.	 Click the Add hyperlink on the top right of the screen.
And you’re done.
Here’s how to upload expenses on an Android device:
1.	 Tap on the Xero icon on your mobile device, and enter your four-digit 
passcode.
The home dashboard screen opens. Across the top are four headings: 
Dashboard, Invoices, Expenses and Contacts. Note: If you move away from the 
mobile version of Xero, when you return you need to re-enter your four-digit 
passcode.

CHAPTER 7  Managing Your Payables      203
2.	 Click on the Receipts heading at the top of the screen.
A list of current receipts appears.
3.	 Click the + on the top-right corner of the screen.
A numbered Receipt screen opens. Refer to the section ‘Adding a new expense 
claim’, earlier in this chapter, for more. The fields available are What Was It 
For?, Where’d You Spend?, Date, How Did You Pay? and Categorise to an 
Account. Click the three dots ( . . . ) on the top right of the screen to add 
additional details: Split, Assign to a Customer, and Add a Reference.
As you’re entering the information, a comic image appears on the receipt to 
reflect the expense. For example, for a taxi charge, a man and dog in a yellow 
taxi appears!
On the middle right is a camera symbol to facilitate taking a photo or adding a 
file to the receipt.
4.	 Click the arrow that looks like a paper dart on the top-right corner to 
save the receipt.
5.	 Click the Xero icon at the top of the screen and then, on the top right, 
click Logout to securely log out of Xero.
What I’ve shown in the preceding steps is the bare basics, to get you (and your 
employees) in the habit of recording expenses straightaway. You can complete 
more fields in this type of expense claim — refer to the section ‘Creating a new 
bill’, earlier in this chapter, for guidance.
Submitting a claim for approval
Once the claim has been entered (refer to preceding sections), it needs to be sub-
mitted for approval, as follows:
1.	 Go to the Expense Claims dashboard and click on the Current Claim link.
This brings up the Current Claim table (see Figure 7-13).
2.	 Select the check box to the left of the expense claims that you want to 
submit for first-level approval and click the Submit for Approval button.
A confirmation box opens, informing you that you have selected items to be 
submitted for approval.
3.	 Click OK.
This moves the claim to the Awaiting Authorisation area in the Expense Claims 
window.

204      PART 2  Daily Activities
To view a summary of the claims awaiting authorisation, click on the Awaiting 
Authorisation link on the Expense Claims dashboard. Note: If you select 
multiple expenses for approval at the same time, they’re batched together in a 
single claim, so you only see one line here.
The claim still needs to be approved so the expense can be paid and included 
in the business financial statements — see the following section.
Reviewing and authorising the claim
After an expense claim has been created and submitted for approval (refer to pre-
ceding sections), a first-level manager needs to authorise the claim.
Users with Read Only and Invoice Only (Draft Only or Sales Only) roles (refer to 
Chapter 4) can’t authorise expense claims in Xero.
To select the transaction that needs to be authorised, click the Awaiting Authori-
sation link on the Expense Claims dashboard. This takes you to the Awaiting 
Authorisation table (see Figure  7-14). Click through to the detail. Select the 
expense claim to be approved by clicking the check box to the left of the Receipt 
and click the Approve button. (I know this is a little bit confusing — this transac-
tion was sitting under the Awaiting Authorisation link, so you probably would 
expect an Authorise button instead — but an Approve button it is!)
After clicking the Approve button, the status for the claim changes from Awaiting 
Review to Approved.

CHAPTER 7  Managing Your Payables      205
At the Awaiting Authorisation stage, you or the first-level manager who’s review-
ing the claim can decline or delete the expense claim — if, for example, you decide 
it’s not an appropriate business expense.
Declining the expense doesn’t notify the person who submitted the expense.
Once the claim has been approved, it can be authorised by the second-level 
manager.
To authorise a claim, go to the bottom of the Expense Claims screen on the home 
dashboard and click on the Awaiting Authorisation link. Click though on a claim to 
see the underlying detail. Below this detail, the Authorise Expense Claim block 
appears with two fields to complete: Payment Due Date and Reporting Date (see 
Figure 7-15).
Even though you’re processing the claim now, the expense may actually have 
occurred earlier in the year. To be correctly reflected in your financial reports, you 
can make the date in the Reporting Date field in the Authorise Expense Claim 
block different to the Payment Due Date (the date the payment is actually made).
Complete the two fields and click the blue Authorise button, and claims are now 
ready for payment (covered in the following section).
Paying the claim
Finally, you’re ready to pay the expense claim. Click on the Awaiting Payment link 
on the Expense Claims dashboard to view a list of expense claims awaiting pay-
ment. Click anywhere along the row to drill down to see the detail of the expense 
claim you wish to pay.

206      PART 2  Daily Activities
To complete the payment, you need to fill out the following four fields at the 
­bottom of the Expense Claims window:
»
» Amount Paid: This is the actual amount the claimant will be paid. Note: The 
expense claim can be partially paid, with the unpaid amount remaining in 
Xero as awaiting payment.
»
» Date Paid: This is the actual date the expense payment will be paid.
»
» Paid From: This is the account the expense claim will be paid out of.
»
» Reference: For audit purposes, always include a detailed reference.
US and Canadian users have the check box option to Pay by Check.
After completing the four fields, click the green Paid button. If opting to pay by 
check, the Pay by Check window appears. Refer to the earlier section ‘Recording 
an individual payment’ for details on how to fill out this window. The processed 
expense claim now sits in the archive summary area within Xero, and the claimant 
needs to be reimbursed for the claim, if that hasn’t already happened.
At the very bottom of many of the Xero windows sits the History & Notes area, 
which details the history of user activity in this area. You (and other users) can 
also add explanatory notes to this area, and these notes are tagged with the date 
and the user name. They’re excellent for audit tracking because they can’t be 
edited or deleted. All History & Notes activity can be searched for under Adviser → 
History & Notes Activity.

Reconciling Your Bank 
Accounts
R
econciling your accounts involves matching cash movements from your 
bank statement with transactions recorded through Xero. Reconciling on a 
regular basis is an essential part of ensuring the accounting records portray 
an accurate reflection of your business finances — you don’t want to waste time 
entering reams of incorrect data and producing gobbledegook. Instead, you want 
to produce accurate information such as management reports that you can use in 
your business to assist with business decisions and save valuable time — so, for 
example, you’re not chasing outstanding debtors when the Aged Receivables 
report is incorrect.
As well as clarifying your business’s accounts, reconciling helps you recognise and 
deal with fraud, errors, bank charges, bank interest, unpresented cheques and

208      PART 2  Daily Activities
money received. Once you have conquered reconciling, not only are you able to 
make better-informed decisions, but you also feel the immense satisfaction of 
knowing that your financial records are accurate, complete and up to date.
This chapter explains how to reconcile bank accounts in Xero, including accepting 
transactions that Xero has matched up correctly and troubleshooting those trans-
actions it hasn’t. I also cover cash coding and how to process spending and receiv-
ing money transactions. Lastly, I show you how to fix any errors you make along 
the way.
Note: Businesses may use a number of financial facilities to process transactions: 
Bank accounts, credit card accounts and payment gateways such as PayPal. Rather 
than constantly repeating this long list of possibilities, I simply use bank account 
to cover any sort of financial facility your business could use.
Preparing to Reconcile
Reconciliation is pretty easy with Xero, but a little bit of preparation makes it even 
easier. Make sure that you have everything on hand, including:
»
» Cheque books
»
» Deposit books
»
» Receipts
»
» Remittance advices
»
» Statements
»
» Supplier invoices
You should also have handy any notes from colleagues explaining transactions. 
For example, you may assume money received by a landlord from a tenant is 
rental income; however, if it is actually a bond or deposit payment you need to 
treat the transaction quite differently. These notes are important because they 
provide further guidance on how to accurately code the transaction (see the sec-
tion ‘Taking Advantage of Cash Coding’, later in this chapter, for more on this).
The corresponding detailed transactions automatically feed in from your bank 
once activated or they can be imported. (Bank feeds and manually importing 
statements are covered in Chapter 4.)

CHAPTER 8  Reconciling Your Bank Accounts      209
Any transactions that don’t pass through your bank accounts, such as cash pay-
ments for expenses, won’t be captured with this reconciliation process. Instead, 
you can enter those transactions via Expense Claims, covered in Chapter  7, or 
record them against a liability loan account.
Reconciliations should be done in a timely manner. Once you have your accounts 
set up in Xero and are taking advantage of automatic bank feeds (refer to Chap-
ters 2 and 4), reconciling your main accounts on a daily basis is hard to resist. If 
you have the time and the inclination, go ahead — once people get in the swing of 
it, many find momentum builds up and they happily reconcile daily. A client of 
mine who recently set up his business accounts on Xero told me the first thing he 
did when he got out of bed in the morning was reconcile his business accounts — 
doing so gave him such a feeling of satisfaction. (Of course, he could have even 
stayed in bed to do his bank rec, via the mobile app — refer to Chapter 1 for more.)
You may not wake up with the same ambition, of course. When deciding what 
accounts to reconcile when, keep the following in mind:
»
» If you want accurate Aged Receivable reports, you need to reconcile all bank 
accounts that take in customers’ payments. Typically, this is your main business 
bank accounts (including credit card accounts and online gateways — and it’s 
these accounts this chapter is focused on). Reconciling these accounts means 
the Invoices Owed to You dashboard is up to date, and you’re able to follow up 
on money you’re owed. Businesses focused on maintaining a positive cash flow 
(and, over the long term, all businesses should be) may reconcile these types of 
accounts in-house on a daily basis.
»
» If you want accurate tax reports, all reports that have tax-related transactions 
passing through them need to be reconciled. This may include high-interest 
accounts, loan accounts and credit card accounts, but may not include some 
accounts. For example, a foreign currency account may not have a consumer 
tax passing through it, so you don’t need to reconcile it to prepare an accurate 
consumer tax report. Most businesses reconcile these types of accounts on a 
weekly or monthly basis; however, with active bank feeds you’ll find you can 
easily do this reconciliation daily.
»
» If you want accurate financial reports, all accounts, including any owner’s loan 
accounts and clearing accounts, need to be reconciled.
Accounts such as suspense or clearing accounts are really easy to neglect. Do 
so at your peril! I recommend you make sure all accounts are reconciled at 
least once a month.
I cover reconciling accounts other than your main business accounts in 
Chapter 10.

210      PART 2  Daily Activities
Automagically Reconciling Accounts
Three bookkeepers walked into a small business. One of them sat down and pro-
cessed the paper records manually and, at the end of the day, she waved and said, 
‘I’ll see you tomorrow.’ The second bookkeeper sat down at a computer and man-
ually entered data into a desktop accounting package. At the end of the day, she 
waved and said, ‘I’ll see you next week.’ The last bookkeeper sat down at her 
computer, opened a Xero file, created some bank accounts with activated bank 
feeds, and reconciled the accounts in Xero. After a couple of hours she waved and 
said, ‘I’m finished. Let me show you how to reconcile — it’s easier than a game of 
space invaders. You just need to check the matches, click to reconcile and call me 
when you have any problems. I can remotely log in and help wherever you are, so 
you’ll probably never see me again! Toodle Pip!’ Seriously?! If you get your files 
set up correctly (as I show you throughout this book), it can be that easy!
The reconciliation process in Xero involves matching cash flows from your bank 
statement with transactions recorded through Xero. If Xero manages to match 
things up correctly (based on how you’ve set your files up), you can just whiz 
through your reconciliation, accepting these matches. Ideally, accepting Xero’s 
suggested matches should clear the bulk of your reconciliation. But always check 
them — don’t reconcile too quick!
Understanding the hierarchy for matching
Xero works through a preferential process when suggesting matching transac-
tions for reconciliation purposes. Understanding how Xero handles matches is 
useful so you can work quickly within the system.
Initially, Xero matches by amounts and word references. If the bank statement 
amount equals a transaction already entered in Xero, a match highlighted in green 
A COMMENT ON BUSINESS BANK ACCOUNTS
Keep your business bank accounts as simple as possible! One of my clients set herself 
up on Xero over about a month, and every few days she kept discovering another 
account. Once her accounts were fully set up, the dashboard showed her the tangled 
web of bank accounts and added level of complexity she had created for herself. To 
simplify her business, she shut down nearly half of the bank accounts. Moving from a 
shoebox to Xero can highlight how complicated your business banking is. So keep your 
business banking simple, maintain as few bank accounts as viably possible, and take 
this opportunity to review what accounts you actually need.

CHAPTER 8  Reconciling Your Bank Accounts      211
is suggested. If multiple Xero transactions exist that could match the transaction 
from the bank feed, an Other Possible Match(es) Found link appears. Drill down to 
select the correct matching transaction. Secondly, Xero refers to the first bank 
rule in the list of bank rules that matches the criteria. If you created a bank rule, 
and it doesn’t seem to match as expected, check the list of bank rules (go to 
Accounts and click Bank Accounts → Bank Rules) and identify what rule may be 
jumping ahead in the matching process. Edit or rename the bank rule if necessary. 
(Refer to Chapter 4 for more on bank rules.) Finally, Xero remembers historical 
reconciliations and autosuggests a similar treatment, although the suggestion 
isn’t highlighted.
Autosuggestions can’t be edited; however, you can update them to reflect the most 
recent match, and you can temporarily switch them off by unticking ‘Suggest 
previous entries’ at the bottom of the Reconciliation screen. I’ve a client who rec-
onciled a transaction using an incorrect tax code, so all future matches autosug-
gested re-using the same incorrect tax code. Once we intervened to reconcile 
using the correct tax code, all future autosuggestions were correct — phew!
Accepting transactions Xero 
has matched correctly
You don’t have to guess how many transactions you need to reconcile, because Xero 
has the number staring you in the face in a big blue button when you open your 
dashboard. In Figure 8-1, the dashboard’s Reconcile # Items button says I haven’t 
done my homework on 28 transactions. Subtle! The easiest way to whittle down 
that number is to first accept all the transactions Xero has matched correctly.
Here’s how:
1.	 Open at the Xero Dashboard and click on the blue Reconcile # Items button.
This button highlights the number of transactions waiting to be reconciled.

212      PART 2  Daily Activities
The first time you access the Xero reconciliation area, you’ll see a Getting 
Started box at the top of the screen. This has some help information about the 
topic. Click on the Hide Help option to access more real estate on your screen. 
You can always access online help again by clicking the question mark in the 
top-right corner.
2.	 Scroll down to the row of four tabs and click on Reconcile.
The row of four tabs gives you the following options: Reconcile, Cash Coding, 
Bank Statements and Account Transactions. If you have any transactions to 
reconcile, the Reconcile tab tells you how many by including the number within 
round brackets on the tab.
Note: You only see four tabs here if you have Adviser status or have been given 
access to cash coding in Xero. If you don’t have this status, you won’t see the 
Cash Coding tab. Refer to Chapter 4 for more about status levels.
By default, the Reconcile tab should be active. If it’s not, click on it to reveal all 
the information included on this tab.
Clicking on the Reconcile tab drills down to the bank account area, detailing 
transactions that are yet to be reconciled. On the left side is the header Review 
your bank statement lines . . . and under this are the transactions from your 
bank account. (These statement lines are created when you import your bank 
statement or through automatic bank feeds — refer to Chapter 4 for more.) On 
the right, underneath the heading . . . then match your transactions in Xero, are 
the transactions to be confirmed in your Xero software.
Xero tries to match up the transactions from your bank statement and your 
transactions in Xero in pairs, which saves you a massive amount of time. 
However, you have the final say when confirming these suggestions; that’s the 
reconciliation process!
At the base of the reconciliation window is a Suggest Previous Entries check-
box. Leave this box ticked if you want Xero to suggest how the transactions 
should be reconciled.
3.	 If unsure, explore a bank transaction.
Clicking on the blue More hyperlink opens the Statement Details pop-up 
window (see Figure 8-2). This provides further information on the transaction 
that the bank has collected, including as much of the following as is available: 
Transaction Date, Payee, Reference, Description, Transaction Amount, 
Transaction Type, Cheque No and Analysis Code.
This additional knowledge may assist you in the reconciliation process by 
helping you work out whether or not transactions have been matched 
correctly and whether you should go ahead and accept this matching.

CHAPTER 8  Reconciling Your Bank Accounts      213
Don’t worry if all the fields aren’t filled in within the Statement Details window. 
As bank institutions become more in tune to what businesses need, and what 
bank feeds can include, they’re likely to provide more complete information.
Click on the X in the upper-right corner to close the Statement Details window.
4.	 Reconcile any transactions that Xero has matched correctly.
When you’re satisfied the transactions accurately match up, record them by 
clicking the blue OK button in the middle, shown in Figure 8-3.
Once you click the button, a tick pops up, replacing OK. The box turns green and 
the matched transactions fade away, indicating that they have been reconciled.
5.	 Repeat Step 4 as often as needed.
Go through the entire list and reconcile all transactions that match correctly. 
(That’s the easy part done.)
After setting a business up, I typically find Xero takes about six weeks to learn all 
the regular transactions. Until that happens, the automagic of Xero can only go so 
far. Sometimes, after accepting all the transactions matched correctly by Xero, 
you still have outstanding transactions that need to be reconciled. In this case, you 
have to hunt for the matching information for payments in or out. This involves 
using the tabs in transaction boxes shown on the right side of the Reconcile tab — 
the Match, Create, Transfer and Discuss tabs — and the Find & Match function. 
How to use these features is discussed in the following section.

Tweaking Transactions to Reconcile
When you’re reconciling, the columns of transactions don’t always automagically 
match, and intervention is necessary. Xero offers a number of options that enable 
you to enter different types of transactions:
»
» Match: For when you need to match multiple transactions or create new 
transactions, or a mix of both.
»
» Create: For when you don’t think the transaction exists in Xero.
»
» Transfer: For transactions between bank accounts.
»
» Discuss: For sending an SOS to your Xero advisory team — you can use this 
tab to add comments and seek input.
Each of these options can be seen in Figure 8-4 and are discussed in the following 
sections. But first, I cover Xero’s hierarchy system for making matches.
BUSY? LET YOUR TEAM DO THE WORK!
If you have your Xero account linked to your Xero advisory team, they’re able to see the 
total number of unreconciled transactions in your business and react accordingly. 
Depending on the support agreement you have with your advisers, they may simply 
send you an email reminder or they may offer more detailed assistance to help you rec-
oncile any outstanding transactions. If you’d like to see how to link Xero to an advisory 
team, and how the support package you choose can affect your monthly charges, check 
out Chapter 1.

CHAPTER 8  Reconciling Your Bank Accounts      215
Matching misfit transactions
Sometimes Xero can’t find a simple match between the transactions shown in 
your bank statement and the transactions recorded through Xero. For example, a 
client may pay off multiple invoices with a single deposit; an annual insurance 
invoice may be paid off in monthly instalments; payments may be received via a 
payment processing solution that also charges against the transactions, so there 
is a mixture of income and expenses to match up against; or a partial payment or 
holding deposit may be paid off against a bill. You may even see a transfer that 
occurs between your bank accounts. Making a part payment can also create 
problems.
Here’s how to match multiple transactions against a single deposit transaction, as 
reflected in your bank statement:
1.	 Find the four tabs within the transaction box and click the Match tab.
The Find & Match button appears.
In reality, clicking the Find & Match option on the far right of the screen is a 
single-step process.
2.	 Click the Find & Match button.
At the top of the window, under the heading 1. Find & select matching transac-
tions, is a table with a list of possible transactions from Xero that may match or 
partially match the bank transaction (shown in Figure 8-5).
3.	 Narrow down the possibilities by using the search fields and clicking the 
blue Go button.
If a number of possibilities are displayed, the Match Options fields allow you to 
search by name or reference number, or by amount, to further refine your 
options. Possible matches to your search are returned in the ‘Find and select 
matching transactions’ table. Sort the transactions further by clicking on the 
column headings.
To reveal bills and spend money transactions, click the Show Spent Items 
checkbox.
Note: If you have multi-currency features, the check box Show Base Currency 
items only is visible. Uncheck this box to reveal transactions in different 
currencies.

216      PART 2  Daily Activities
4.	 If the relevant transaction(s) are displayed, check the box to the left of 
each transaction and the line is highlighted.
To further assist the reconciliation process, you may need to add an additional 
transaction. The total value in the bank feed may include bank charges, such as 
foreign exchange fees. If the total value represents a cash deposit, you may 
need to include money taken out of the till to pay for deliveries, or money 
passed to the business owner’s loan account. Click on the button labelled New 
Transaction to reveal the Spend Money or Receive Money, and the Transfer 
Money, options.
Alternatively click on the button labelled Adjustments to Add a Bank Fee, or the 
Minor Adjustment button (think under a dollar). (See the following sections for more 
on part payments and transferring money, and see the section ‘Using the Spend 
Money and Receive Money Options’, later in this chapter, for more on this topic.)
When the sum of the selected transactions matches the amount shown in the 
bank statement, the Reconcile button at the bottom of the screen turns green.
5.	 If you agree with the reconciliation, click the green Reconcile button.
Congratulations! You’ve just cleared another transaction from your 
reconciliation list.
6.	 Repeat these steps as appropriate.

CHAPTER 8  Reconciling Your Bank Accounts      217
Processing part payments
Say you’ve committed to purchase goods for $1,000. You make a 30 per cent deposit 
up-front, with final payment due on delivery. You enter the $1,000 bill into Xero, 
within Purchases, and make a $300 payment against the outstanding debt through 
your business bank account. So, according to Xero, the transactions don’t match 
up. To enlighten Xero, you need to split the allocation of the transaction.
To allocate this split transaction, follow these steps:
1.	 Within the Find & Match window, go to the table at the top part of the 
window and check the box to the left of the relevant transaction.
The word Split appears on the transaction line.
2.	 Click on the blue Split hyperlink.
The Split Transaction window opens (shown in Figure 8-6). If only a single 
transaction is selected, Xero automatically adds the amount per bank state-
ment to the Part Payment box and adjusts the remaining amount. The Part 
Payment amount can be overridden.
3.	 Click the green Split button.
This records the transaction through Xero and means the transaction within 
Xero now matches the one shown on your bank statement. The Reconcile 
button at the bottom of the screen turns green.
4.	 If you agree with the reconciliation, click the green Reconcile button.
Another one down! (Is it time for chocolate yet?!)
5.	 Repeat these steps as appropriate.

Transferring money
If you can’t find a match for a transaction showing on your bank statement with 
a transaction, set of transactions or part payment within Xero, you may realise 
that it doesn’t yet exist in the Xero account you’re reconciling and you need to add 
one or several more transactions. This brings you to the second part of the Find & 
Match window, signposted with the heading 2. View your selected transactions. Add 
new transactions, as needed. Clicking the New Transaction button to the right of this 
brings up the options to Spend Money or Receive Money, and to Transfer Money.
When I worked for a construction company in Singapore, every night our savvy 
accountant rang the bank, agreed a rate and transferred huge sums of money into 
a high-interest earning account overnight. The money worked hard while we 
slept! She then transferred it back in the morning. You may not have huge sums 
to transfer to a high-interest account, but if you do have excess money, your cash 
flow can benefit from utilising these sorts of account. When you transfer money 
between bank accounts (so the movement of cash shows on your bank statement), 
you also need to enter the transaction in Xero — using the Transfer Money option.
If you realise a transaction isn’t a simple transfer, you may need the Spend/
Receive Money options. Jump ahead to the section ‘Using the Spend Money and 
Receive Money Options’ section for a full explanation.
If you just need to transfer money from one account in Xero to the one you’re 
reconciling, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the New Transaction button on the Find & Match window.
This brings up the Spend Money, Receive Money, and Transfer Money options.
2.	 Select the Transfer Money option.
This brings up the New Transfer window (shown in Figure 8-7). The Date and 
From Account fields are filled by default with the matching information. Select 
an account and enter the transfer amount. If you want to add Tracking 
categories, click + Add Tracking and the fields appear.
The Transfer Money option can only be recorded between accounts set up as 
bank accounts, credit cards or online payment accounts within Xero.
3.	 Click the green Transfer button.
If the amounts match, the Reconcile button at the bottom of the screen turns 
green.
4.	 If you agree with the reconciliation, click the green Reconcile button.
Another transaction disappears from your reconciliation. (Just like chocolate 
disappears from your cupboard . . .)

CHAPTER 8  Reconciling Your Bank Accounts      219
Note: If you know you need to enter a money transfer through Xero, you can jump 
straight to doing so by using the Transfer tab (see the ‘Transfer’ section, later in 
this chapter, for more). This takes you through a slightly different process to the 
one described in the preceding list, but performs the same function.
Create
After Match (refer to the earlier section ‘Matching misfit transactions’ for more), 
the second option available if you need assistance matching transactions is Create. 
If you don’t think the transaction exists in Xero at all, you can create it under the 
tab of the same name. Figure 8-8 shows the Create tab and the three available 
fields within it: Who, What and Why.
To create a new transaction in Xero to match the transaction showing in your bank 
statement, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Who field and enter the business or individual name.
From the bank transaction, you may be able to identify the required name and, as 
you start typing, the field fills with suggestions if the name or similar names have 
been used previously. If you’re dealing with a new contact, enter the new name.
Once you’ve typed a new contact name into the Create window, it automati-
cally gets added to Xero, so make sure you use the specific name of the person 
or business rather than something generic — your bank’s name, for example, 
rather than just ‘bank fees’. If at a later date you need to edit the name, you can 
find it in Contacts. (Find out more about contacts in Chapter 5.)

2.	 Click the What field and select the account.
Select the relevant general ledger account from your Chart of Accounts or start 
typing the name of the account. As you start typing, auto-suggestions pop up 
in the field, or you can access a full list of options by clicking on the drop-down 
button.
3.	 Click the optional Why field to enter more detail.
After you’ve filled in the Who and What fields, the OK reconciliation button 
appears, meaning you’ve added enough information for Xero to match this 
transaction and reconcile it. However, for the purpose of maintaining a 
detailed trail of what you have done — otherwise known as an audit trail — 
filling out a reason for the transaction in the Why field area is a good idea.
If you’re using Tracking options, they’ll be available at the bottom of the Create 
box to be selected and associated with the transaction. (Find out more about 
Tracking options in Chapter 12.)
4.	 Check the tax rate applied to the transaction.
You can override the account’s default tax rate, which Xero will automatically 
apply to the transaction, if necessary.
5.	 Click the Add Details button (if required).
This opens the Direct Payment window, which essentially is a combined Spend/
Receive Money window. You may require this if the transaction is more 
complicated than a simple transaction match — say, you need to split pay-
ments over a number of transactions. Here, you can split out the money as 
necessary. (See the section ‘Using the Spend and Receive Money Options’ later 
in this chapter for a full explanation.)
6.	 Click OK to record the matching transactions.
Transfer
This option allows you to record a transfer that has already occurred between 
accounts set up as bank accounts, credit cards or online payment accounts within 
Xero. If you want to record a transaction to an account that has not been set up in 
this manner, you need to use another method.
After clicking on the Transfer tab, the Select a Bank Account option appears. 
Clicking on the drop-down menu shows you the available accounts that have been 
set up in Xero. Select the relevant option and the reciprocal match is highlighted 
on the other account.

CHAPTER 8  Reconciling Your Bank Accounts      221
However, if you need to add tracking categories, this method doesn’t allow you to 
do so. Instead, go to the dashboard, click the three vertical dots (like a vertical 
ellipsis!) to the top right of the relevant bank account, and click Transfer Money, 
which enables you to add a tracking option to the transaction. Follow the guidance 
in the preceding paragraph to complete the transfer.
Note: A bank rule cannot be set up for transfers. Refer to Chapter 4 for guidance on 
setting up bank rules.
Discuss
The Discuss tab can be used when you’re unsure how to code a transaction, such 
as a personal expenditure transaction. You can detail your queries in the text  
box under the Discuss tab (shown in Figure  8-9). Another Xero user with the 
required access, such as a tax accountant or senior staff member, can then go 
online, review the transaction, correctly code it or advise you what to do. You can 
revisit and code the transaction. After a number of transactions have been coded 
correctly in Xero, the software becomes increasingly intuitive and starts to ­suggest 
further matching transactions.
Reviewing other possible matches
When the transaction on the right side of your reconciliation screen is shaded 
green, you may also see a blue hyperlink suggesting that other possible matches 
exist. To drill down to the other possible matches, click on the hyperlink. You can 
then select the relevant one and, once you’re satisfied, record the transaction by 
clicking OK.
At the very bottom of the reconciliation screen is a Suggest Previous Entries 
checkbox. While ticked, Xero autopopulates possible matches with suggested 
transactions it’s learned. While unticked, Xero will only suggest existing matches 
and bank rules. If you (or any other users accessing your Xero file) have a ten-
dency to be overzealous playing this game of snap, leaving this checkbox unticked 
may be safer, to help avoid potential errors.

Taking Advantage of Cash Coding
The Xero account window includes four main tabs: Reconcile (covered earlier in 
this chapter), Cash Coding, Bank Statements and Account Transactions. The Cash 
Coding area isn’t as pretty as the main reconciling window — it’s formatted more 
like an Excel spreadsheet. However, using the spreadsheet format means the Cash 
Coding area is the ultimate processing spot for transactions in Xero, allowing for 
manoeuvrability and quick data entry options. Yes! You can reconcile even faster! 
Once your bank rules are set up (refer to Chapter 4) and you’re using your shortcut 
keys (see the nearby sidebar ‘Taking advantage of shortcut keys’), jump into the 
Cash Coding area and you’ll be zipping along!
Only users with Adviser status or Standard users who have been given access by 
their Xero adviser can access the Cash Coding area. In fact, if you don’t have this 
status, you won’t even see the Cash Coding tab on the account window.
Getting familiar with Cash Coding
The Cash Coding table (shown in Figure 8-10) contains exactly the same unrecon-
ciled data as the Reconcile tab area — the data is simply in a spreadsheet format. 
Across the top of the table are various column headings, including Date, Payee, 
Reference, Description, Account, Tax Rate, Tracking Categories (if activated), 
Spent and Received. Check the box beside Show Lines with Suggested Matches to 
show matching transaction suggestions here — the green tick indicates a poten-
tial match. Bank rules are automatically shown. Visit the Reconcile tab first, rec-
oncile invoices and matching transactions, and then pop into Cash Coding if 
you’re an expert.
Most of the columns on the Cash Coding table are self-explanatory. All fields are 
editable except the Date, Tracking categories, Spent and Received fields so, apart 
from these, you can click in and out of the fields as you wish, entering additional 
business data.
FIGURE 8-10: 
The Cash Coding 
table.

CHAPTER 8  Reconciling Your Bank Accounts      223
When adding data to the Cash Coding table, a good place to start is the Payee field. 
Tab across to this field, selecting the correct Payee. Then move to the Account 
field. Once the Account has been entered, the default tax rate automatically fills in. 
If a discussion note was entered on the Reconcile window, it appears as a tiny icon 
in the Date column. Hovering over the icon reveals the entered text.
At the far-right side of the table is a downward-pointing arrow. Click it to access 
the following options: Create Bank Rule, Split and Delete.
Once the transaction details have been entered, the transaction can be ticked and 
reconciled. But the reconciling goodness does not end there! (See the following 
section for more.)
Clicking on each individual column heading (Date, Payee, Reference, Description, 
Spent and Received) of the Cash Coding table allows you to sort the fields within 
that column. However, if bank rules override the underlying data and the sorting 
happens to the underlying data rather than the bank rules, it can start to look a 
little confusing!
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SHORTCUT KEYS
If you’re within the Xero Cash Coding spreadsheet, you can use a number of shortcut 
keys to help you quickly navigate around an active cell:
•	 Tab: Move forward to the next cell
•	 Shift+Tab: Move back to the previous cell
•	 Enter: Move down one row
•	 Shift+Enter: Move up one row
You can also use shortcut keys when editing data within Xero, as follows:
•	 + key: Copies Account, Tax Rate and Tracking fields from the row above into the row 
beneath
•	 Forward slash ( / ): Opens the Direct Payment window
•	 Shift+Down arrow: Ticks current row, and moves down to the row beneath
•	 Alt+Down arrow: Converts a Payee name to proper case
Utilising shortcut keys can really improve your productivity. In my travels, people who 
use shortcut keys are usually faster than people like me who use the mouse.

224      PART 2  Daily Activities
Understanding bulk coding
Bulk coding enables you to reconcile transactions at Xero-hero speed — however, 
you can also make mistakes at high speed too! Make sure you know what you’re 
doing before giving this a go. By selecting a number of transactions and making a 
change to a single transaction in that group, the same change repeats across all 
checked transactions. Sorting transactions allows for even more efficient coding.
To quickly bulk code a number of similar purchases made at the same store, follow 
these steps:
1.	 On the Cash Coding dashboard, sort the Payee data by clicking the 
header of the Payee column.
2.	 Check the box to the left of all the similar transactions.
All lines are highlighted.
3.	 Allocate the same account to all similar transactions by clicking the 
Account field of the first highlighted row and selecting the account the 
selected transactions are all to be allocated to.
Notice the Account and Tax Rate filled in for all highlighted transactions. This is 
bulk coding at its finest!
4.	 If you need to enter unique Reference, Description and Tracking informa-
tion for individual transactions, uncheck the transactions and enter 
relevant data in the fields.
Otherwise, you could continue to use the bulk-coding feature and enter 
duplicate information.
To apply a bank rule to a transaction, click the Apply Rule button and click on 
the relevant bank rule. (In the long run, it’s better to update the bank rule so 
that it’s automatically applied here.) Refer to Chapter 4 for guidance on setting 
up bank rules.
5.	 To reconcile the transactions, click the Save and Reconcile Selected 
button at the bottom of the screen.
Bulk coding doesn’t just apply to transactions from the same payee. Perhaps you 
spent a week at a conference and all expenses for the week have to be allocated to 
the same Expense account and the same Tracking account. Select all the transac-
tions, make the change in a single account, click Save and Reconcile and voila! 
Batched, matched and neatly reconciled.
If you don’t know what account or what tax code to use to code the transaction, 
ask your Xero advisory team or accountant. Leave a note for them in the Discuss 
box. (Refer to the section ‘Discuss’ earlier in this chapter.)

CHAPTER 8  Reconciling Your Bank Accounts      225
If you make a coding mistake, you can click on the Discard Changes button at the 
top of the table and reverse the changes that were just entered (but not if you’ve 
gone so far as to reconcile the transaction). If only everything in life was that easy.
The number of transactions displayed on the Cash Coding grid can be increased or 
decreased. By clicking on the Show More button on the top right of the screen, you 
can reveal all unreconciled transactions so that you can take full advantage of 
batch coding. This customisation doesn’t stick, however — you need to re-do it 
for each visit to the Cash Coding dashboard.
Viewing Bank Statements
The Bank Statements tab in your Xero account window (shown in Figure 8-11) 
lists imported statement line details. Click on the Statement Lines hyperlink and 
select Statement to instead see the start and end date and balance of all imported 
statements. If your bank feeds are automatic, you probably don’t need to visit this 
area at all, unless you’re investigating a gremlin. So, if you’re happy with your 
figures, don’t even waste your time looking here!
However, if you manually import bank statements or if something has gone amiss 
with your bank reconciliations, reviewing the Bank Statements area is worth-
while. After clicking on the tab, go over the information provided. If a gap appears 
between start and end dates or balances, or transaction dates overlap, you have an 
issue that requires further investigation. The final status column also reveals rec-
onciled, unreconciled, deleted and manually imported line transactions. Maybe a 
statement is missing or duplicate information was imported during a manual 
import, and now the statement needs to be found or duplicates deleted.
FIGURE 8-11: 
The Bank 
Statements tab.

226      PART 2  Daily Activities
When you reveal your statement lines, you will also see a search option in the top 
right corner of the screen. Click through here to search for transactions using the 
criteria Payee, Particulars, Code, Reference, Analysis Code, Amount and/or Date.
Viewing Account Transactions
The Account Transactions tab (shown in Figure 8-12) details the account transac-
tions that have been created in Xero. To the right of the transaction details, there’s 
a column labelled Bank Transaction Source, which identifies whether an entry is 
sourced from a bank feed, imported, or if a user has manually marked it as recon-
ciled. The final column labelled Reconciled (in green) indicates the transaction has 
been reconciled while Unreconciled (in orange) indicates an unreconciled transac-
tion, which may highlight the need for further investigation.
VIEWING PAGES OF DATA
When using Xero to view a table with a lot of information, you have a couple of different 
options for organising the information. At the bottom of the webpage displaying the 
table are two drop-down box options:
•	 Page # of # (# total items): Tells you the page you are on, and the total number of 
lines associated with this table.
•	 Showing # items per page: Tells you how many items are being shown per page. 
You have the option to change this, and can choose to show from 10 to 200 items.
Just don’t get confused — items here doesn’t refer to inventory items. Instead, the term 
just refers to the transactions that can be viewed on the page.

CHAPTER 8  Reconciling Your Bank Accounts      227
Using the Spend Money and 
Receive Money Options
I work with a lovely not-for-profit organisation and, because every payment has 
to be approved by the board, the accounts department are always late paying bills. 
One time, they overpaid my invoice. I contacted them and suggested I hold on to 
the extra and apply any future work I did for them against the overpayment. This 
meant that I didn’t have to waste admin time repaying them, and I didn’t have to 
chase them for payments for a while. Two wins for me!
The Spend Money and Receive Money options can be used to record overpayments, 
as well as direct payments and prepayments. The Spend Money option can be used 
to enter cheque transactions, for example, and the Receive Money option can be 
used to record cash deposited in the bank. Processing via these options means a 
transaction already exists in Xero to match, once the bank transactions hit Xero.
To access the Spend Money and Receive Money area, from the main menu click on 
Accounts → Bank Accounts and then the relevant bank account, and then click on 
the Manage Account button on the top far-right side. The Edit Account Details 
window opens (shown in Figure 8-13), giving you quite a lot of useful options, 
including the Spend Money and Receive Money options.
Click the Spend Money link to access the Spend Money window (Figure 8-14). At 
the top right corner of this window, a drop-down menu is provided, which allows 
you to select how the money was spent from the following options:
»
» Direct Payment
»
» Prepayment
»
» Overpayment
FIGURE 8-13:

Details window.

228      PART 2  Daily Activities
Supplementary information can be attached using the document icon for the 
Direct Payment, Prepayment and Overpayment options.
Direct payment
You can record cheque payments via the Spend Money Direct Payment option. 
Select Direct Payment on the drop-down menu and the standard entry options 
appear. Grab your cheque book, enter the information and save the transaction.
If you receive cash that’s not associated with open sales invoices, you can deposit 
the money into your bank and record this by selecting Receive Money → Direct 
Payment on the drop-down menu. Grab your deposit book or check your state-
ment online, enter the data associated with the deposit(s) and save the transac-
tion. If you’re recording multiple payments in a single deposit, still record them 
separately and make a note of the group deposit. The Receive Money area has the 
option to re-order lines, and once the transaction is recorded, a receipt can be 
issued via email or PDF to the payee. If you’re receiving money against a sales 
invoice, refer to Chapter 6 for guidance.
Prepayment
If you’ve made a payment in advance to a supplier, you can record this by clicking 
on the arrow to the right of Direct Payment, and selecting Prepayment from the 
drop-down menu. A pale-salmon background appears with standard entry 
options. Here you can fill in the transaction, allocate the amount to the prepay-
ment account and save the entry. After saving the transaction, the amount exclu-
sive of tax can be seen on the Balance Sheet as a current asset.
FIGURE 8-14: 
The Spend Money 
window.

CHAPTER 8  Reconciling Your Bank Accounts      229
Overpayment
An overpayment may occur when you’re paying a supplier and round up the 
invoice amount, which in turn overpays the bill. Or, alternatively, when you 
receive money from a client greater than the existing invoices for this client. You 
can record the overpayment via Spend or Receive Money, and when future work is 
undertaken with the supplier or customer, the overpayment can be applied to the 
invoice or bill when it’s raised.
Identify the details of the overpayment and record it by clicking on the arrow to the 
right of Direct Payment and selecting Overpayment from the drop-down menu.  
A pale-salmon background appears with limited options, and a pre-filled Account 
and Tax Rate. So you can’t actually do too much here — just add the description, 
date, amount (and Tracking option if relevant), and save. After saving the transac-
tion, the amount can be seen on the Balance Sheet in accounts payable.
Underpayment
An underpayment may occur when the money coming in for an invoice is slightly 
less than expected. It may be due to banking charges on the transaction or the 
­client mistakenly underpaying an invoice. Your options are the following:
»
» If you have an ongoing relationship with the client, prompt the client to pay 
the underpayment with the next payment.
»
» If your records are kept on a cash basis, you could choose to edit the original 
invoice so it matches the actual payment. (To do so, go to the Sales dashboard 
and click on the Awaiting Payment tab. Locate and select the invoice, click the 
Invoice Options button, select Edit and make the changes. Then click Update 
the Invoice and reconcile the transactions.)
»
» Use the underpayments feature to process the adjustment to the liability account.
To process an underpayment, follow these steps:
1.	 From the accounts reconciliation window, identify the incoming money 
and click the Find & Match link on the top far right side.
The reconciliation block opens.
2.	 Find the original invoice in the Find & Select Matching Transactions block 
and select it by checking the box.
Use the search function to the right of the block to assist in finding the original 
invoice if you need it. Scroll down the block, and you can see red text highlight-
ing how much the total is out by.

230      PART 2  Daily Activities
3.	 To process the underpayment, click the Adjustments button, select Minor 
Adjustment, and enter the underpayment in the field that appears.
The red alert text disappears, and the green Reconcile button is highlighted.
4.	 Click the green Reconcile button to record the underpayment and 
reconcile the transaction.
The underpayment is coded to a Rounding current liabilities account.
Processing prepayments  
and overpayments
Once recorded (refer to preceding sections), the prepayment and overpayment are 
processed by applying them to a Purchase or Sales Invoice from the same supplier. 
When a new Purchase or Sales Invoice is created and approved for a client with an 
outstanding prepayment and/or overpayment, the Allocate Outstanding Credit? 
window opens and you have the option to allocate the amounts.
Searching for a transaction
You may realise that you’ve entered a Spend Money or Receive Money transaction 
incorrectly, and need to edit the transaction to correct it. Or, even worse, you may 
just kind of have this feeling that something is wrong but may not realise what 
you’re looking for. So, you first need to find the transaction.
Make a note of everything and anything you know about the transaction — the 
available search fields are the following (listed in the order shown):
»
» Description
»
» Contact name
»
» Amount or amount range
»
» Date or date range
Jot these down on some notepaper. Then, with the gusto of Captain Cook or Chris-
topher Columbus, start searching for the transaction. Start at the home dashboard 
and then click on the three vertical dots (like a vertical ellipsis) on the right side 
of the relevant bank account. When the drop-down options appear, click on 
Account Transactions to access the search box. This brings up a list of transac-
tions, with a Search button at the top right side. Clicking on the Search button 
opens various field options: Description or Contact Name, Minimum Amount, 
Maximum Amount, Exact Amount (checkbox), Start Date, End Date, and Exact 
Date (checkbox) (see Figure 8-15).

CHAPTER 8  Reconciling Your Bank Accounts      231
Enter what you know about the transaction, and the list of filtered information 
returns possible candidates. If you don’t know what account the transaction 
occurred against, you’ll need to repeat this for all accounts until you locate the 
transaction. Click on the transaction that needs editing. To convert the transaction 
into an editable format, click on the Options button on the right side and select 
Edit Transaction. Once you’ve made any necessary changes, record the revised 
transaction by clicking the green Update button on the bottom right of the screen.
Fixing Errors
Everyone makes mistakes, and chances are at some point you will too — maybe 
you were overzealous, or were advised how to treat something incorrectly and you 
now need to retrospectively amend the transaction. No worries! Xero allows you to 
fix errors.
If you’ve already locked off an accounting period or submitted your reports to the 
Tax Office, you may not want to make changes in Xero within that date period. 
Check with your Xero advisory team if you’re concerned.
If you (or someone in your business) got trigger happy, you may find that bank 
transactions have been reconciled incorrectly. This can happen in one of two ways: 
Transactions of the same amount have been matched incorrectly and, therefore, 
need to be unreconciled; or a transaction was created and was incorrectly coded, 
and so needs to be deleted.
Resolving the difference between  
Xero balances and bank balances
The reasons behind any differences between Xero balances and bank balances are 
explored in Chapter 4; however, because resolving these differences is a problem 
FIGURE 8-15:

232      PART 2  Daily Activities
many users face, exploring how to resolve the issue in further detail is worth-
while. Essentially, you’re trying to solve a puzzle, and during the journey you 
gather information and try alternative options to identify the cause. You might 
resolve it at Step 1, or you may need to go through all the steps; that is the nature 
of puzzles.
Run through these steps and you should get to the bottom of your differences:
1.	 Refresh the bank feed by clicking Manage Account → Refresh Bank Feed.
This step only needs to be performed if using Yodlee feeds.
You may have to re-enter security details. Refreshing the bank feed option is 
not available for all accounts.
2.	 Reconcile outstanding transactions.
Hey, that’s what this chapter is about! (Refer to earlier sections for more.)
3.	 Identify the actual difference between the balances and see if it rings any 
bells.
If you run the amount through your head, you may be able to recognise what 
the transaction relates to.
Refer to the earlier section ‘Create’ if the amount relates to a transaction that’s 
missing from Xero.
As you gather more pieces of the puzzle, you can refer to the next section, 
‘Undertaking detailed searches to find and recode transactions’, and search for 
the amount and date range (if you can pinpoint that).
4.	 Confirm whether a known issue with the Xero bank feed exists.
Take a look at www.xero.com/blog/bank-feed-status to find out more 
about bank feed issues. Otherwise, contact Xero Support (support@xero.com).
5.	 Identify if transactions have been allocated to the account, but not yet 
reconciled.
Click on Accounts → Bank Accounts to identify the bank account in question. 
Click on Manage Account and then Account Transactions, and then click on the 
Status hyperlink on the far-right column until the small black arrow beneath it 
is facing upwards. If you see Unreconciled or Reconciled (and in the Bank 
Transaction Source column it says User), it may highlight an issue. Do they 
seem correct? Are these items duplicates? Are they old transactions?
Alternatively, you can run the Reconciliation Report up to the relevant date 
(accessed from Reports → All Reports), to identify outstanding payments, and 
receipts and transactions not yet reconciled.

CHAPTER 8  Reconciling Your Bank Accounts      233
6.	 Establish whether the transaction is correctly allocated to the account.
If necessary, click on the transaction to view more details.
If the transaction’s recently dated, the issue may just be timing, and you need 
to wait for the matching transaction to feed in.
If the transaction may be a duplicate created in error, make a note of the date 
and amount, and click on the Search button and enter in the identifying details 
you have.
To delete an erroneous transaction, see the section ‘Removing and undoing a 
bank transaction’, later in this chapter.
If you can confirm the transaction is correctly allocated but for some reason 
the bank feed has not fed in correctly, click into the transaction and click the 
Options button on the top right. Select Mark as Reconciled from the drop-
down options, effectively forcing the reconciliation.
Note: The Mark as Reconciled option may first need to be enabled — which 
you can do under the ‘?’ option on the top of the screen.
7.	 Go to Settings → General Settings → Conversion Balances to check the 
opening bank balance is correct.
An incorrect opening bank balance may be creating the difference. Only Users 
with Standard access and above can change conversion balances. Check with 
your Xero adviser if you’re unsure about this area, or refer to Chapter 2 for 
more details.
8.	 Compare the bank feed transactions line by line with the real bank 
statements to identify any lines missing from the import.
Add individual transactions with the Spend and Receive Money options. After 
you’ve saved the transaction, drill back into it, click the Option button in the top 
right corner, select Mark as Reconciled, and then confirm on the pop-up 
window to again Mark as Reconciled.
If bulk transactions are missing, identify the date range and import them 
again — refer to Chapter 4 for how to do this.
9.	 If issues are ongoing, contact Xero Support and, if required, deactivate 
the feed, refresh the screen and immediately reactivate it.
Contact Xero Support to see if they can identify the issue. You can then 
deactivate and reactivate the feed via the Manage Account button. Also let 
your bank know you’re having issues with the bank feed.

USING BANK RECONCILIATIONS TO 
IDENTIFY PROBLEMS
Reconciliation reports can help you find quick fixes for your reconciliation worries. The 
Bank Reconciliation Summary provides a collection of the current reconciliations of all 
your listed bank accounts. If your accounts aren’t reconciling or the balance isn’t what 
you expect, take some time to explore this area (see the nearby figure for an idea of 
how this area looks).
Source: Xero 2016
You can access bank reconciliation reports via the Reports dashboard. The following 
steps help you check out any outstanding or unreconciled items:
1.	 Open the Reports dashboard and select Bank Reconciliation Summary under 
the group labelled Accounting.
2.	 Choose a bank account from the Bank Account field drop-down menu.
3.	 Select a date in the Date field — perhaps the end of the month, or the last day 
of the bank statement — and click the blue Update button to generate the 
report as at that date.
A list of outstanding payments, outstanding receipts and unreconciled bank state-
ment lines appears. If the account is reconciled to the selected date and your 
records are in order, the few lines listed here will be due to timing issues. Older 
transactions or transactions you wouldn’t expect to see here may require further 
investigation, as they may indicate something that needs to be fixed. Essentially, 
you should be able to justify anything listed as outstanding or unreconciled, and 
you should investigate anything else.
4.	 Make a note of the questionable transactions and locate them in the bank 
account’s transactions area to review the underlying detail.
For example, if you’ve processed an invoice as closed but the money hasn’t been 
received via the bank feed, it’s listed as an outstanding receipt. Does the date and 
transaction make sense, or does it require further investigation?

CHAPTER 8  Reconciling Your Bank Accounts      235
Undertaking detailed searches to 
find and recode transactions
To search for transactions across multiple accounts using different criteria, use 
the Find & Recode option. The name suggests it’s for finding AND recoding, but 
don’t be fooled — it’s actually just a useful tool for finding a transaction, which 
you can then recode if you need to.
This feature is only available to users with Advisor status.
Follow these steps to find transactions, and, if necessary, to recode them:
1.	 To access the Find & Recode dashboard, click Adviser → Find & Recode.
The Find & Recode dashboard appears. At the top is the Find & Recode button. 
Beneath this button is the history of all recoded transactions.
2.	 To start the search process, click on the button labelled Find & Recode.
3.	 Define the parameters of your search. At the top of the screen, where it 
says ‘Find transaction lines that match All/Any of the following condi-
tions’, select All or Any from the drop-down menu.
Select All, so that all the conditions you define are applied to the search.
4.	 To add a condition, click on + Add a Condition, which lies beneath the 
defined criteria.
You can select from a number of different conditions, including Type, Status, 
Account, Date, Transaction Total, Rate, Entered By and Contact, as well as two 
You can also use the Bank Reconciliation Summary to create a list of unreconciled  
transactions for you to review. Click on the Bank Statement tab within the Bank 
Reconciliation Summary and, from the Date field, select the date range you want to 
review. Remember to uncheck the box labelled Reconciled Only — the unreconciled 
transactions are probably of more interest to you! Click the blue Update button to 
renew the report and review it, or export it to work on later.
The final tab of the Bank Reconciliation Summary, labelled Statement Exceptions, details 
transactions that, for various reasons, are exceptional — such as deleted, manually 
entered or duplicated transactions.
Reviewing bank reconciliation reports may highlight issues that you need to deal with to 
ensure your data is reliable.

236      PART 2  Daily Activities
different Tracking categories (if they’ve been set up). After you make a selec-
tion, for example Transaction Total, more options appear so that you can 
further refine your search.
For Transaction Total, a drop-down list appears, offering the following options:
•	 Is equal to
•	 Is less than
•	 Is more than
So, if you know the transactional amount, you could opt for ‘Is equal to’ and, in 
the next field, enter the amount. However, if you just have an approximate 
figure, one of the other options may be more useful.
5.	 Add another search condition by clicking + Add a Condition.
For example, from the options provided, you can select Date. The drop-down 
selection includes four options:
•	 Is between
•	 Is
•	 Is before
•	 Is after
Select ‘Is between’ and two date fields appear. For example, you can select the 
beginning of the month in the first field and select the end of the month in the 
second field.
You have now applied two conditions to your search.
6.	 Activate the transaction hunt by clicking the button labelled Search.
A list of transactions that meets the defined criteria appears. If you still can’t 
find the transactions you’re looking for, you can further refine your results by 
adding extra conditions or adjusting your existing conditions. Alternatively, 
click the cross on the right side of the screen to delete an unwanted condition, 
and run the search again.
If you’ve found the transaction you’re looking for, click on it and it will open in 
another window.
The search only returns transactions that aren’t in a locked period.
7.	 To recode the returned transactions, check the box on the left side and 
click the Recode button.
Two options appear: Recode Source Transactions or Recode with a Manual 
Journal. If you’re happy to change the original transaction, choose the first 
option. If you want to leave the original transaction untouched (perhaps it 
occurred at the end of the financial year), opt for the second option.

CHAPTER 8  Reconciling Your Bank Accounts      237
Note: If you recode the transaction with a manual journal, a reference note is 
added to the individual transaction stating that This transaction was recoded via 
a manual journal.
8.	 Select Recode Transactions.
The Recode Transactions window appears. The fields that can be recoded 
include Contact, Account and Tax Rate, and you can also add the two Tracking 
categories.
9.	 Click in a field and either start typing what you would like to recode the 
transaction to, or select it from the drop-down menu.
For example, if the accountant recommends expenses should be capitalised, 
the expense transactions can be recoded from expenses to assets. Do this by 
clicking in the Account field and selecting Assets to code the transaction to 
Assets. Select the blue button labelled Review to review the recoding, and then 
click the blue button labelled Confirm to confirm the recoding.
A blue clock pops up to advise you that the transaction recoding is taking  
place. A Recode Summary then appears, which details what changes have 
occurred. The changes are permanently noted in the list History of Recoded 
Transactions, which you find at the bottom of the Find & Recode dashboard 
(refer to Step 1).
There’s nothing to prevent the same transactions from being recoded by manual 
journals more than once, so be careful!
Unreconciling a bank transaction
To unreconcile the transaction, start at the home dashboard, and click on the bank 
account name (which takes you to the Account Transaction screen). Tab across to 
the list of account transactions. Use the search function and Xero’s column-
header sorting capabilities to find the transaction and drill down into it — on the 
top right you can see a button labelled Options, and from there you can unrecon-
cile the transaction.
Unreconciling a previously reconciled account removes the association between 
the transaction and the bank statement line it was reconciled against. It doesn’t 
delete the transaction or the bank statement line.
Removing and undoing a bank transaction
To delete a transaction, you first need to locate it — refer to the section ‘Searching 
for a transaction’, earlier in this chapter, for more. Once you’ve found the problem 

238      PART 2  Daily Activities
transaction in the list of possibilities (see Figure 8-16 for an example), click in the 
checkbox next to the transaction that needs to be deleted and click the Remove & 
Redo button. A confirmation window appears, asking if you really want to remove 
and redo the transaction. To confirm you’re sure, click Yes.
What Happens in Life Happens in Xero
Some small businesses run a bank account that’s a little bit business and a lot 
personal, and they occasionally pay for business items using cash and they don’t 
want to use the Expense Claims feature in Xero. This section outlines how I deal 
with this scenario.
Only transactions that specifically relate to the running of your business should go 
through your Xero account for that business. Ideally, you should have a business 
bank account that all business transactions go through, and this is certainly what 
Xero would advise. However, in reality, accounts and transactions can get a little 
complicated, so having a method to sort out the mess is worthwhile.
Read through the following steps and think about whether the method outlined 
may work for you — it’s a little bit tricky so not everyone’s cup of tea.
Here’s how to sort out business transactions from a mixed-use bank account:
1.	 Add the ‘mixed’ bank feed to Xero.
Refer to Chapter 4 for help with adding bank feeds to your accounts. In this 
example, I call mine the ‘*Name* Loan Account’, where *Name* refers to the 
individual partner.
2.	 Add a liability account and check the box Enable Payments to this 
Account.
Refer to Chapter 2 for more on adding new accounts. I call mine the ‘*Name* 
Loan Account’.
FIGURE 8-16:

CHAPTER 8  Reconciling Your Bank Accounts      239
3.	 Reconcile business transactions that feed through in a normal fashion.
4.	 Delete non-business transactions via the bank statements dashboard 
area.
Go to the home dashboard and click on the three vertical dots (the vertical 
ellipsis) on the top-right corner of the bank account, then select Bank 
Statements. Click on the bank statements with the yellow box to the left of 
them. A table of the detailed transactions appears. Check the box to the left of 
the transactions to be deleted, and click the Delete button.
Instead of deleting non-business transactions, you can also allocate them to 
Drawings, which still allows for the account to be reconciled.
5.	 Add cash transactions via the Spend and Receive Money functions and 
mark them as reconciled.
Refer to the section ‘Using the Spend Money and Receive Money Options’ for 
more on these functions.
Keep in mind that it doesn’t matter that the transactions did not go through 
the real bank account; this bank account ends up being a mixed bag of transac-
tions. Refer to ‘Resolving the difference between Xero balances and bank 
balances’ for guidance on marking transactions as reconciled.
6.	 Add and reconcile a transaction to bring the balance to zero.
This enables the financial reports to recognise all transactions that have 
passed through the account. Reconciling this account needs to be done 
regularly, to reflect accuracy in the financial reports; however, if you’re not too 
concerned because the amounts are small, you can just do the reconciliation 
periodically when you need to submit the reports.
For my business, for example, the liability loan account reflects how much 
money I’ve actually taken out of the business. I opt to use the liability account 
because I don’t like running numerous transactions from the equity account. If 
the liability account is positive it indicates the business owes me money, and if 
it is negative I owe the business money. There are tax implications here, so you 
should take guidance from your accountant as to how you will deal with the 
intersection of personal money and business money.

M
any business owners think accounting is simply about meeting tax 
­obligations. Unfortunately, you do need to be concerned about tax and 
that’s why a great tax accountant is a vital component of your business 
advisory team. However, tax isn’t the only thing accounting is concerned with — 
and it shouldn’t be your only concern either. The really exciting aspect of using an 
accounting package like Xero (imagine I’m jumping up and down on a soapbox, 
yelling this in delight) is that it enables you to produce timely and accurate 
­management reports that can help you make informed decisions.
In this chapter, I show you how to take advantage of all the reporting options Xero 
offers, including customising reports, knowing which version of a report to use 
when, and exporting data to view in other applications.

Understanding the Reports  
Available in Xero
Some people run their small business on the assumption that a positive bank bal-
ance means the business is healthy — and that’s all they need to know. Don’t be 
like them. Take a moment to think about what information, and in what form, 
would help you make decisions and, in turn, improve the performance of your 
business. If you need further advice, work with a Xero Adviser like myself to help 
you identify and access this useful information.
Xero offers a wide range of available reports, and is always updating the kind of 
reports offered. To see the kind of reports you can access, go to the main dash-
board and click on Reports → All Reports to access the Reports dashboard.
Accessing Xero’s business reports
You can access several useful reports from Xero’s Reports homepage. Note: The 
reports you can access depend on your user role — refer to Chapter 4 — and the 
features you’re using.
Your ability to access different reports changes between the old- and new-style 
reports (for more on these different report types, check out the nearby sidebar ‘A 
new generation of reports’). Referring to access levels across both generations of 
reports can get rather confusing, so in this chapter I describe the reports you can 
access with Adviser-level access to the Reports area. If you find something 
described here that you can’t observe, it may be because of your user access level.
A NEW GENERATION OF REPORTS
Periodically, Xero releases reports — easily identified on the Reports dashboard as they 
are labelled with New at the end of their name. As you move between different reports 
you see a clear distinction between the styling of the old and new reports. The original, 
or old, reports were released before the launch of the first iPhone. Xero is continually 
evolving, and is releasing new reports embracing the latest technology. Yes, you can still 
experience a benefit from using the old versions of the reports, as they contain data 
and features sometimes not available in the new version. It’s expected that the old 
reports will eventually disappear, but, in the meantime, you can take advantage of both 
versions. The more recent reports offer different data, sorting and filtering options. 
Explore them to see if they unlock further useful information and insights into your 
business finances and operations.

CHAPTER 9  Generating Reports      245
Financial Reports show key business performance indicators, such as stability, 
liquidity, and the ability to fund growth and generate cash. Xero’s financial reports 
include:
»
» Balance Sheet: The assets, liabilities and equity of the business at a point in 
time; forms part of Xero’s Management Reports. The New report allows up to 
36 previous period comparisons. A period may be a month, a quarter or a 
year, so you could go back 36 years!
»
» Budget Manager: An estimate of future financial outcomes for up to 
24 periods. (Refer to Chapter 10 for guidance on creating a budget.)
»
» Budget Summary: A summary of the monthly budget.
»
» Budget Variance: Your monthly income, expenses and profit compared to 
budget.
»
» Business Performance: Fourteen graphical representations of popular 
business ratios.
Some Business Performance reports require the general ledger lines mapped 
to report codes to work. Only a Xero partner can access report codes and 
make these changes.
»
» Cash Summary: Amount of cash received and spent in a given period; forms 
part of Xero’s Management Reports.
»
» Executive Summary: Includes monthly totals and some common business 
ratios; forms part of Xero’s Management Reports.
»
» Movements in Equity/Statement of Changes in Equity: Different names for 
different jurisdictions but the same report, this shows any changes in 
business equity during the year. The New report offers the options to select 
the period, allows up to 36 previous period comparisons, provides the option 
of the cash or accrual accounting method, and allows you to apply tracking 
options. The US and UK access the Statement of Changes in Equity report, 
which is in line with new reporting requirements.
»
» Profit and Loss/Income Statement: Income, expenses and profit for a 
month (or year); forms part of Xero’s Management Reports. The New report 
allows up to 36 previous period comparisons.
»
» Statement of Cash Flows: Shows the cash flows from operating, investing 
and financing activities.
»

Accounting Reports offer various ways to access transactional details across all 
accounts, as follows:
»
» Account Summary: Monthly balances over time for a single account.
»
» Account Transactions: Summary of all transactions and journals in Xero. The 
New report includes extra columns for consumer tax and account code 
details.

the business statement balance.
»
» Bank Summary: Summary of all money received and spent for each bank 
account.
»
» Detailed Account Transactions: Lists in detail all transactions entered into 
Xero, including invoices and bills, spend and receive money, payments, and 
journals.
»
» General Ledger: Summary of the debit and credit movements of individual 
accounts, and access to the General Ledger Exceptions report, which high-
lights transactions that deviate from the average.
»
» Journal Report: Details the journal entries entered into General Ledger, and 
can be filtered to show cash journals.
»
» Trial Balance: Balance for all accounts at a point in time.
Fixed Assets Reports summarise information related to the recording, deprecia-
tion and disposal of the business’s fixed assets. Xero’s fixed asset reports include:
»
» Depreciation Schedule: Schedule of depreciation for every fixed asset in 
your asset register. The New report version has additional fields available to 
display, group and filter.
»
» Disposal Schedule: Shows details of assets for a selected date range that 
have been sold, or discarded by some other means.
»
» Fixed Asset Reconciliation: Summary of your fixed asset balance compared 
to your Fixed Asset Register.
Sales Reports show the details of money owed to the business, as follows:
»
» Aged Receivables: Who owes the business money at the end of the selected 
month; forms part of Xero’s Management Reports.
»
» Aged Receivables Detail: Shows outstanding invoices as per a specified date. 
Additional columns for invoices details are available. (This is a new-style report.)

Inventory Reports show purchases, sales, movement and quantity-on-hand ­levels 
for tracked and untracked inventory items, and include the following:
»
» Inventory Item Details: Shows comprehensive purchase and sales details of 
tracked and untracked inventory items for a defined period.
»
» Inventory Item List: Lists details of inventory at a point in time, including 
account, tax rate and total value.
»
» Inventory Items Summary: Provides a detailed view of sales and purchases 
for each inventory item. Only the New version of this report includes tracked 
inventory details.
»
» Sales by Item: Where business income has come from, by inventory item.
Specific reports are also available based on your region, for example:
»
» Australia: Activity Statement, GST Reconciliation, Taxable Payments 
Annual Report
»
» New Zealand: GST Reconciliation, GST Return
»
» UK: EC Sales List, VAT Reconciliation, VAT Return
»
» US: Sales Tax Report, 1099 Report
These reports are further explored in Chapter 10.
Foreign currency reports show how currency fluctuations have affected your 
­foreign currency transactions. (These reports are only available to those on Xero 
Premium using multi-currency features — see Chapter 15.)
Payroll/Pay Run reports show details of your pay run transactions. (Only users 
with Payroll Admin status can see these reports  — see www.dummies.com/go/
xerofd3e for more.)
Selecting your favourite reports
When I’m working with a client, I like to present them with the following reports:
»
» Aged Receivables, as at the date of the end of the last month
»
» Aged Payables, as at the date of the end of the last month
»
» Balance Sheet, as at the date of the end of the last month

CHAPTER 9  Generating Reports      249
»
» Cash Summary reflecting the last period
»
» Profit and Loss (Accruals) reflecting the last period
I recommend that you make use of Xero’s Tracking features (see Chapter 12 for 
more on these). If these have been used by my client, I also provide copies of the 
Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss reports filtered by what’s being tracked.
Of course, I encourage you to choose other reports that suit your needs and add 
these to your list of favourites!
For quick access within Xero, you can select key reports to appear in the drop-
down list from the menu bar on Xero’s main dashboard. To add and remove 
reports from the drop-down list, go to the Reports dashboard and click the star to 
the left of the required report’s name. A blue star means the report appears from 
the drop-down Reports menu. A clear star means the report doesn’t appear on the 
drop-down menu.
Sorting and filtering
Once you’ve generated a report within Xero, you usually have a few sorting and 
filtering options. The options can be utilised to update and organise the informa-
tion the report presents.
Not all reports have all the options listed in this section! Check what’s available 
for the report you’ve generated by accessing the report and viewing the block at 
the top, then click the More Options link if it’s available.
The options available usually include the following:
»
» Sorting: Sort by account name or account code.
»
» Filtering: Sort by Tracking categories (see Chapter 12 for more on Tracking).
»
» Date Range: Compare different date ranges, including year to date, month to 
date, as at, and specific date ranges. And the data range can extend back over 
the life of the data file!
»
» Cash Basis: By default, all reports are presented on an accruals basis. The 
cash basis option lets you display the report on a cash basis. Smaller busi-
nesses and some countries’ tax systems tend to look at the reports on a cash 
basis — just make sure you don’t get the two options confused! (Refer to 
Chapters 6 and 7 for more on cash versus accrual accounting.)
»
» Show Budget: Compares the data to the relevant budget period. (See 
Chapter 10 for further information on budgeting.)

250      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
»
» Decimals: Offers you the option to display or hide decimal places.
»
» Grouping: Provides the ability to group by different report data. For example, 
you may decide to group all payroll or motor vehicle expenses together.
»
» Data: Allows you to add and hide columns of various data/information. For 
example, you may decide to add the contact name and phone number details 
to an Aged Receivables report given to staff who don’t have access to Xero, so 
they can call and follow up on outstanding items.
Customising Reports
Customise your reports so they do what they’re supposed to do — help you under-
stand the performance of your business. Use them to ascertain what you can do to 
set and achieve business goals and move the business in the direction you want.
Reports can only be customised in Xero prior to being Published — see the section 
‘Understanding Xero’s Different Reporting Options’, later in this chapter, for 
more on the different versions of reports available.
Customising report layouts
Xero allows you to customise the layout of your reports — meaning the placement 
of accounts can be altered or grouped and subtotalled by a customised layout tem-
plate. The new style reports offer additional flexibility around grouping, tracking 
and filtering options, and the ability to add extra columns and data.
When you’re creating reports for your business, opt to customise the reports with 
New at the end of their name; if you can’t get what you need with them, you can 
then try the old-style reports — or contact your Xero ninja for advice.
Layout options are like filters for reports, defining how they’re presented. This is 
useful if you’re highlighting different aspects of the information to different enti-
ties. For example, an organisation that approves grants may be happy to simply 
see a summarised view of a report, while a human resource manager may want to 
see the full details of personnel spending but isn’t interested in seeing details of 
other parts of the business.
Xero also allows you to group similar accounts together, and display a summary 
of their balance on reports. For example, I like to break business operating 
expenses into four groups: Promotion, People, Place and Provisions (refer to 
­Chapter 2 for what expenses are included in each group). Rather than see the full 

CHAPTER 9  Generating Reports      251
details of staff expenditure, including wages, amenities and training, I can group 
the accounts so the net balance is displayed as a People subtotal on the Profit and 
Loss report. I can group accounts for all four groups, so when I look at the operat-
ing expenses, I only see subtotals for each of the groups and can then drill down 
if I need further detail.
Once created, layout templates for old-style reports can be defined as the default 
layout for other users who access the file. Your Xero advisory team can share these 
templates with you too.
The following old-style reports can have their layout customised:
»
» Profit and Loss
»
» Balance Sheet
»
» Budget Variance
»
» Tracking Summary
The following new-style reports can have their layout customised:
»
» Profit and Loss
»
» Balance Sheet
»
» Statement of Cash Flows
»
» Movements in Equity/Statement of Changes in Equity
In this section, I cover some of the layout customisation options available in Xero.
Creating a custom report layout template  
(for old-style reports)
The following steps outline how to customise old-style report layouts:
1.	 Click on Reports → All Reports and then the name of the old-style report 
you want to customise.
For example, click on Profit and Loss to bring up this report.
2.	 Click the blue Layout Options button at the base of the report and select 
Create New Layout.
The New Layout window opens, asking you to complete the Layout Details (see 
Figure 9-1).

252      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
3.	Fill out the Layout Name field.
This gives the layout template a name — for example, you could choose 
Management.
4.	Fill out the optional Layout Description field (if desired).
Here you can describe the purpose of the template — for example, Report for 
general management.
5.	Check the Default box.
This makes this the default layout for all who view the report.
6.	Click on the Add Group button and fill out the Group Name field.
This allows you to create and name a new group of accounts. For example, if 
you wanted to group all expenses relating to people on the Profit and Loss 
report, you could choose PEOPLE for the group name.
7.	Select your required option from the Place In drop-down menu.
For example, for a group showing expenses relating to people, you need to 
select the Less Operating Expenses option.
8.	Check the Show Summary Only box.
This means a subtotal of the accounts within the group is displayed.
9.	Click on the green OK button.
This saves the newly created Group.
10.	Check the box beside required accounts to add these to the group.
For example, to group expenses relating to people, you need to select the 
accounts for wages, amenities, training, and any other accounts showing 
people-related expenditure.
11.	Click the Move Selected Accounts button and choose the required group 
from the drop-down menu.
The group you created in Step 6 comes up as an option on the drop-down menu.
FIGURE 9-1:

window.

CHAPTER 9  Generating Reports      253
12.	Click the green OK button.
The selected accounts are now tiered underneath the required group and, 
when viewed in the actual report, only the net amount is displayed.
13.	Click the green Save button.
You can also click Save at any point as you work on the layout template, to 
ensure you don’t lose your work.
Additional accounts can be added to the grouped accounts, or new groups created 
(for example, for Promotion, Place and Provisions groupings) by following Steps 
6 to 12  in the preceding list. Group settings can be edited by clicking on Edit 
Group, making the required changes and clicking OK to save the changes.
Creating a custom report layout template  
(for new-style reports)
The following steps outline how to customise new-style report layouts:
1.	 Click on Reports → All Reports and then the name of the new-style report 
you want to customise.
For example, click on Profit and Loss New to bring up this report.
2.	 Click the Edit Layout button on the bar at the base of the report.
An editable window opens. At the top is a tool bar with various icons for adding 
text, schedules, footers, rows and columns, sorting information, and deleting 
information.
In the middle of the screen you see the report rows, and to the right side is a 
context-sensitive pane, which reflects further details about the field your 
mouse cursor is active in; refer to Figure 9-2 to see this screen.
3.	 Tailor the editable report header field to suit your requirements.
This gives the report a name — for example; you could add Management to the 
end of the name that’s currently there.
4.	 To move an account line, click on the account line and drag and drop it to 
the desired area of the template.
5.	 To create a group of accounts, click on the Rows icon and select Group 
from the drop-down menu. This creates an untitled group. Click in the 
row labelled Untitled Group and fill out the Untitled Group Name field on 
the editable pane to the right.
This inserts grouping rows into the chart. This allows you to create and name a 
new group of accounts. For example, if you wanted to group all expenses 
relating to people on the Profit and Loss report, you could choose PEOPLE for 
the group name.

254      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
In the pane on the left, leave the check box beside Total ticked so the group of 
accounts is added together and the sum is listed beneath the grouping.
6.	 To move the group, select the grouped rows and drag them to the 
appropriate place in the template.
For example, for a group showing expenses relating to people, you need to 
drag the group to the Operating Expenses area.
7.	 Drag relevant rows and drop them into the row group.
This allows a subtotal of the group accounts to displayed.
8.	 Click the blue Done button to save the report.
You can also click Done at any point as you work on the layout template, to 
ensure you don’t lose your work.
To leave the report without saving the new layout, click the cross on the 
top-right corner.
9.	 To save the report as a custom template, scroll to the bottom of the 
report and click on the drop-down arrow beside the button labelled Save 
As. Select Custom to save your report as a custom report.
The Save as Custom Report window opens. Enter a useful name for the report. 
If you want all users to be able to select this new custom layout from the 
Reports menu, check the box beside the option Make this the default view for 
this report. Click the blue button labelled Save to complete the process.
Additional accounts can be added to the grouped accounts, or new groups created 
(for example, for Promotion, Place and Provisions groupings) by following Steps 
5 to 7 in the preceding list.

CHAPTER 9  Generating Reports      255
Optional extras for customising new-style reports
The tool bar across the top of the Edit screen of the new-style report layouts has 
additional options for customising the report:
»
» Text — click on the T icon (for adding text) on the tool bar to add a text 
box to the report.
The text box can include both a title header and body text. To add a title, 
simply type over Enter Title — for example, you could type Monthly reports. To 
add detailed information to the text box, type over Enter Text.
You can use the context-sensitive pane on the right to further customise your 
text box. For example:
•	 Remove numbering: Added text boxes are numbered by default to give 
structure to the report. If, however, you didn’t need or want the numbering 
(say, you simply wanted a paragraph of text), you can easily remove the 
numbers. To do this, while in the text box title row, click in the Text Block 
pane and click on the button labelled Standard to remove the numbering.
•	 Highlight text: Select the text you want to highlight and click the button 
labelled Highlight Text to highlight the text in yellow.
•	 Bold text: Select the text you want to place in bold and click the bold icon 
to bold the text.
•	 Add a table: From within the Text Block pane, click on the Insert Table icon 
to add a table to your text box. For example, you may want to use a table 
to disclose prior period arrangements, or to explain the before and after 
scenarios provided in different columns. Add extra rows and columns to 
the table by placing your mouse cursor within the table and clicking the + 
buttons within the context-sensitive Text Block pane. When the table is set 
up as you require, you can enter numbers and text into the grid.
Click out of the text box and it automatically saves.
»
» Schedule — click on the Schedule icon on the tool bar to add a supple-
mentary schedule to the report.
A schedule can offer supplementary details about the main financial report. 
For instance, it may include underlying depreciation details or motor vehicle 
expenditure details, which are simply summarised as a single line in the 
report.
Click in the header bar to activate the editing function on the context-sensitive 
pane. You don’t type directly into the report; you type into the editable fields 
on the side pane. Go over to the pane on the right of the screen, click in the 
Name field at the top and enter the name of your schedule. The Total and 
Numbered Headings check boxes are ticked by default; leave them that way.

256      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
Click + Add Accounts and the Insert Account window opens. Select the 
relevant accounts to add to the schedule and click the blue button labelled 
Insert to add the account to the schedule.
Stay in the Schedule box and click the Rows icon on the tool bar. From the 
drop-down menu select Custom and an untitled custom row appears in the 
schedule. Click on it and drag it to where you want it. Edit the name in the 
Custom Row pane – perhaps East Coast income to give further detail to the 
grouping.
Additional Row options available are context-dependent and include Group, 
Formula, Account and Custom. The up and down arrows assist with arranging 
the placement of the schedule on the report.
To change the order of the blocks added to the report, click on the row panel 
and, from the menu bar along the top of your screen, click on the directional 
arrows to move the blocks one step higher or lower. You can reorder the 
different blocks using these upward and downward arrows. You can add as 
many blocks as you need to your reports.
»
» Columns — click on the Columns icon on the tool bar to add a column to 
the report.
You have three customisable options when adding a column:
•	 Date: Once selected, the date column can be further defined as Month, 
Quarter Year or a customised date range.
•	 Formula: A formula utilising column headers and +, –, ×, ÷ and if. can be 
defined.
•	 Notes: The option to link to other areas in the report and added rows, 
such as footnotes.
»
» Bin — the Bin icon on the tool bar acts as an undo or delete option for 
many scenarios.
Viewing reports using the layout template
For old-style reports, when you’ve created a new layout template (refer to the 
earlier section, ‘Creating a custom report layout template (for old-style reports)’), 
you can view a report using the template. From the Reports dashboard, click on 
the report and select the Layout Options button. From the drop-down menu, 
select Choose Layout and from the Choose Layout window, select the template 
layout to apply to the report.
For new-style reports, when you’ve created a new custom report (refer to the 
earlier section, ‘Creating a custom report layout template (for new-style reports)’), 

CHAPTER 9  Generating Reports      257
you can view the report. From the Reports dashboard, click on the tab labelled 
Custom and select the relevant report. The default layout can also be accessed by 
selecting the default report layout from the Reports dashboard.
Editing and deleting layout templates
To edit the layout template of the old-style reports, click on the drop-down 
options on the blue Layout Options button at the base of the report and select 
Choose Layout. . . . Select the layout, and click the green Apply Layout button. 
Then, go back to click on the drop-down options on the blue Layout Options but-
ton at the base of the report and select Edit this Layout. From there, click on the 
red Delete Layout button at the base of the page to delete the entire layout tem-
plate. Click on the blue Edit Group link beside the group to edit the accounts within 
the group, and click on the blue Delete link to delete the group.
To edit custom reports (which are available within the new reports), click on 
Reports → All Reports → Custom Tab and then the name of the new-style report 
you want to customise. To delete a custom report, go to the Reports dashboard, 
click on the tab labelled Custom, click on the drop-down arrow to the right of the 
report and select Delete.
WHEN IS A PROFIT NOT A PROFIT?
Most small-business people are at least kind of familiar with the Profit and Loss report. 
They open the report and have a Zen-like moment when they spot the one figure at the 
bottom of the report they understand: Profit. But take a closer look at your Profit and 
Loss report and you can actually see three separate lines of profit: Gross Profit, 
Operating Profit and Net Profit. Each one can tell you something about the business.
Gross Profit represents the pure profit from selling products or services — that is, sales 
income less direct costs. If I bought a can and sold a can, the difference would be gross 
profit. If you aren’t making a profit at the gross profit level, you aren’t going to make a 
profit at the bottom line! The next level of profit is Operating Profit. This should repre-
sent Gross Profit less the operating expenditure of the business. To me, Operating Profit 
truly reflects the profit of running the business. The final line of profit is Net Profit, which 
includes all the legitimate income and expenses for the business that aren’t necessarily 
a part of running the business. For example, income may also include bank interest, and 
expenses may also include home office expenses or the expenses of running the busi-
ness owner’s other car. These are income and expenses that may not necessarily go 
with the business if the business is sold.

258      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
Adding reporting ‘bling’:  
Summaries and footnotes
Depending on your user access level, you may be able to add summaries and foot-
notes to reports. When saved, these appear on draft or published reports.
Summary notes
The summary notes you choose to add to reports could be generic and could apply 
to all customers. For example:
»
» Due to Easter, two public holidays occurred in the month
»
» Interest rates were cut by 25 basis points
»
» Elections to be held in the following month
These notes highlight aspects of the economy that may or may not impact the 
business. Notes specific to each company could also be included, enhancing the 
user’s understanding of your reports. A summary for a company that sold solar-
related items, for example, may include:
»
» Government rebates for solar installation were withdrawn during the month.
»
» Average rainfall was lower than average for the month.
»
» Temperatures were unexpectedly higher than average for the month.
To add a summary to the old-style reports, open a report and click the blue Add 
Summary button on the top left of the screen (you require Adviser level access to 
do this). A rich text editor opens. Numerous formatting features are available — 
including bold, italics, tables, numbering and bullet points. Go wild! The summary 
can be copied from another document and added, using the shortcut keys Ctrl/
Cmd+V. Save the summary using the green Save button and return to edit it by 
hovering across the summary and clicking directly into it. Delete the summary by 
clicking the cross at the top right corner.
To add a summary to the new-style reports, add a text box and place this at the top 
of the report. Delete the summary by clicking the cross in its top-right corner.
Footnotes
You can add extra detail to reports to assist or explain transactions via footnotes 
if you have Adviser-level access. For old-style reports, simply click the drop-
down arrow to the right of the data and add a footnote. Numbered notes appear at 
the bottom of the page.

CHAPTER 9  Generating Reports      259
In the new-style report layout, it is a two-part process to add or edit a footnote. 
Initially, you add a normal text box and include the footnote detail. Then, from 
the menu bar, you click the Columns icon, and from the drop-down options choose 
Notes. The added column appears to the far right of the report. Click in the 
field beside the relevant amount. The Notes Link To options appear. From the first 
field available, select the report from the drop-down menu. From the second field, 
select Link Target from the drop-down menu to define which footnote the note is 
being linked too. Click the blue Done button to save these updates. The final report 
lists the footnote number beside the general ledger line, and you can click on the 
hyperlink to quickly view the footnote.
Changing views
Xero allows you to view data within reports in different ways — by drilling down 
for more detail, stepping back for a wider view, or looking at the data visually 
using charts.
Drilling down on report information
To see further detail about individual transactions in a report within Xero, hover 
over the data and click on a link to drill down to an underlying transaction. Note: 
This doesn’t always work; if you click and the link ends with ‘false);’, the underly-
ing detail can’t be accessed.
Hover just to the right of entries on the old-style reports (if you have Adviser-
level user access) and a small drop-down arrow appears. Click on the arrow to 
highlight additional links and drill down on the links to access the information.
Adopting a wider view
Access an expanded view of the old-style reports by clicking on the Wide View 
button on the top-right corner. To return to a normal view, click the Standard 
View button.
The shortcut keys to access the wide view are as follows:
»
» PC users: Ctrl + Shift + F
»
» Mac users: Cmd + Shift + F
Displaying charts
Some reports have the additional option of displaying charts. When viewing the 
report, if you see a Show  .  .  .  button (or something like it), click on it and an 

260      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
interactive chart appears (see Figure 9-3). Click the cross on the top-right corner 
to hide the chart.
Understanding Xero’s Different  
Reporting Options
Reports can be produced within Xero in various formats: Draft, customised, pub-
lished, printed or exported. Your ability to make changes to reports will depend on 
your user access level.
Draft
Reports can be created or viewed and saved in draft format, capturing a snapshot 
of the business at a point in time. The draft version of the report includes any 
notes and annotations made on the report for other users to review.
Draft reports can be saved, viewed, edited, published and deleted.
To save a report as draft, open the report and click on the blue Save as Draft button. 
To access draft reports from the Reports dashboard, click on the Draft tab and select 
the report to view and/or edit. To delete a draft report, view the list of Draft reports 
and click on the drop-down arrow to the right of the report and select Delete.
Published
Publishing a report fixes it at a point in time, including any summary notes, 
annotations and criteria changes (where relevant). Published reports can be saved,

CHAPTER 9  Generating Reports      261
viewed and deleted. Although they themselves can’t be edited, you can copy and 
edit them. To do this, just click on the Copy & Edit green button.
To save an old-style report as published, follow these steps:
1.	 Open the report and click on the green Publish button.
The report template window opens with three blocks of criteria to customise: 
Title & Details, Contents; Cover & Table of Contents; and PDF Preferences.
2.	 Override the information in the Title & Details block, if necessary.
The Title, Subtitle, Report Date, Author and Published date appear on the 
summary listing on the Reports dashboard under the Published tab. The Title, 
Subtitle, Report Date and Author appear on the Contents page, and the Title, 
Subtitle and Report Date appear in the footnotes of the report.
3.	 Check Show Cover Page and Show Table of Contents Page as required.
The table of contents is useful when reports are connected (see the following 
section for more on this).
4.	 At the PDF Preferences block, click the tiny colour block under the 
heading Border Colour.
A colour chart opens and you can select the colour branding of the report. This 
is an opportunity to brand the report with your business colours. Next to the 
tiny colour block you can see the default hex code (a hex code is a method for 
specifying colours used on a web page) for reports is #00A0C6. If you have a 
business brand colour, find out what its hex code is and enter it here.
5.	 Enter any additional information in the Report Footer Text.
Footer text could be a disclaimer, a note that reports aren’t audited, contact 
details, or a reminder that it’s your birthday soon — just to check who’s 
carefully reading these reports! The footer text appears in a block at the 
bottom of the report.
6.	 Click the Publish button.
To access published reports from the Reports dashboard, click on the Published 
tab. To delete a published report, view the list of Published reports and click on the 
selected report. When the report opens, select the red Delete Report button.
To save a new-style report as published, follow these steps:
1.	 Open the new report and click on the drop-down arrow beside the Save 
As button, and select Published.
The Publish window opens, with four blocks of criteria to customise: Cover 
Page, Contents, PDF Styling and Numbers.

262      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
2.	 Edit the information in the Cover Page block, if necessary.
Here, you can edit the Title, Date, and Prepared By fields. The right side of the 
screen shows how the information appears (if the check box has been ticked to 
include this detail on the cover page).
3.	 In the Contents block, tick the checkbox to Include Contents Page (as 
required).
The table of contents is useful when reports are connected (see the following 
section for more on this).
4.	 At the PDF Styling block, select Custom from the drop-down menu 
options and click the tiny colour block that appears (labelled Title Colour).
A colour chart opens, and you can select the colour branding of the report. This 
is an opportunity to brand the report with your business colours. Next to the 
tiny colour block, you can see the hex code.
If you have a business branding colour code, find out its hex code and enter  
it here.
Alternatively, if no colour is desired, you can select Plain from the drop-down 
options provided.
5.	 At the Numbers block, you can check or uncheck the options to show or 
hide the decimals on all pages.
Reports typically don’t need the clutter of decimals, so hiding them is wise.
6.	 Click the green Save button.
The designed report appears under the Published tab.
Once published, the report can be exported to PDF, Microsoft Excel or Google Docs 
(see the section ‘Exporting Reports’, later in this chapter), archived, or copied to 
a new report and edited.
Connecting reports
To enhance your understanding of the data behind the reports, you can connect 
old-style reports. Only Xero partners can connect the new-style reports. For 
example, say you review the Aged Payables report and identify a customer who 
owes a significant amount of money. From the Aged Payables report, you can click 
on the customer’s name, drilling down to see the detail of their invoices. You can 
then click the Add to Report button, which links the reports. Numerous reports 
can be associated with the primary report.
Once you’ve published the primary report, you can access the linked reports when 
viewing the primary report in Xero via tabs at the top of the reports. When the 

CHAPTER 9  Generating Reports      263
primary report is published to PDF, the linked reports are included with the pub-
lished report. When the primary report is published to Microsoft Excel, the linked 
reports are included as additional sheets. (See the section ‘Exporting Reports’ for 
more on publishing reports in different formats.)
Archived
Published reports can be archived. To archive a published report, from the dash-
board, click on Reports → All Reports → Published, then click on the published 
report to open it. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and select the grey Archive 
Report button. Pretty quickly, the report is archived.
To access archived reports from the Reports dashboard, click on the Archived tab. 
Only users with Adviser status can delete an archived report.
To delete an Archived Report, from the Published tab on the Reports dashboard, 
click on the Archived tab and then click on the archived report to open it. Scroll to 
the bottom of the screen and select the red Delete Report button. Status update: 
Gone!
Exporting Reports
To export a report, open the required report, customise it, scroll to the bottom, 
and click the blue Export button to see the export options. Reports can be exported 
in three formats — Microsoft Excel, PDF and Google Docs — as follows:
»
» Microsoft Excel: Selecting the option to export a report in Excel format 
means Xero downloads an editable Microsoft Excel file, inclusive of live 
formulas, to your computer. Click on the download, or find it in your down-
load files, enable editing and start playing with it!
Exporting to Excel allows data to be easily manipulated to suit your needs, but 
it does mean any charts within the report won’t be included in the download.
»
» PDF: A PDF file (a Portable Document Format file) is an un-editable file format. 
Selecting the option to export a report in PDF format means Xero downloads 
a PDF file to your computer. Click on the download, or find it in your download 
files, to view it. If the report contains a chart, it appears very nicely on the PDF 
file. The PDF files exported from Xero are small in size and can be emailed 
easily.
Note: Only whole dollar amounts are exported in the PDF — that is, the cent 
amounts from any figures drop off.

264      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
»
» Google Docs: If you use Gmail, or have your email hosted through Google 
Apps, you have the option to export reports to Google Docs. The report is 
accessed online, can be edited like a typical spreadsheet, and can be shared 
with others. When you export the report from Xero to Google Docs, you  
then need to log in to your selected Google account and confirm Xero is a 
trusted site.
If you have numerous email addresses hosted through Google Apps, you need to 
log into Google with the email address you want associated with the downloaded 
document.
Accessing Management Reports
In addition to the reports you generate yourself in Xero, any users with Adviser 
status can access a predefined management pack of reports, for a selected period. 
The report includes the following (in this order):
»
» Executive Summary
»
» Cash Summary
»
» Income Statement/Profit and Loss
»
» Balance Sheet
»
» Aged Receivables
»
» Aged Payables
This report provides a good representation of the business’s performance. If you 
export it to Excel, a corresponding report is created — useful for those who like 
manipulating data! See Chapter 12 for more on Xero’s management report pack, 
and how to use it within your business.

Mastering Your Weekly 
and Monthly Tasks
A
recent client of mine has an interesting lifestyle business model  — he 
imports a container of shoes and travels the country selling them at 
­markets. One day, he arrived at my door with shoeboxes (oh, the irony!) 
filled with several years’ worth of paperwork and receipts relating to the 
­business — mostly just dirty, scrunched-up, faded bits of paper. What joy! It took 
my assistant hours just to flatten and sort all the information.
I completely understand that earning money and running your business is critical 
for business survival. Nevertheless, regular tasks need to be undertaken in the 
business to ensure your records are up to date, your tax authority is kept happy, 
Chapter 10

266      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
and you have access to information about your business operations. I don’t care 
who does this! It could be you, your assistant, a contract bookkeeper or a virtual 
assistant. But you (and/or your staff and advisers) need to develop and agree to 
processes that are undertaken regularly to ensure complete, accurate and reliable 
records are produced on a timely basis.
The complexity of your business determines the level of the weekly and monthly 
tasks you need to carry out, and whether you need to invest in additional solu-
tions. In this chapter, I provide a general overview of the tasks a typical business 
needs to do on a regular basis, guiding you through reports you may need to sub-
mit for tax purposes. I also provide an overview of using budgets within the busi-
ness. You can then adapt the tasks covered in this chapter to suit your business 
requirements.
Confirming Accounts are Complete
Reliable report preparation requires all accounts to be complete for the relevant 
period. I had a client working in the promotional industry who thought his 
accounts were all in order, and that he just needed a little extra assistance. I took 
a quick look and asked him why his bank charges were $70,000. We quickly 
worked out these charges were incorrect (surprise, surprise!). Whenever my client 
had an unknown transaction, he just allocated it to bank charges. The transactions 
incorrectly allocated to bank charges needed to be correctly allocated before any 
reports could be relied upon.
To ensure your records are complete, check the following:
»
» All relevant bank accounts are included in your chart of accounts — even 
high-interest loan accounts, foreign currency accounts and bank accounts you 
hardly ever use
»
» All transactions for the reporting period have been entered
»
» Bank reconciliations are up to date
»
» General ledger exceptions — transactions that are extraordinary or 
unusual — look in order in your business’s records
When you’re reviewing information, look at it with all the knowledge that you 
have about the business, but also ask yourself if the data seem ‘reasonable’. By 
that, I mean: ‘Does it seem fair and sensible for your business?’ I sometimes 
­suggest to a client to look at reports with ‘blurred eyes’ to more easily identify 

CHAPTER 10  Mastering Your Weekly and Monthly Tasks      267
numbers that seem too large or too small in comparison to the numbers around 
them. For example, bank charges of $70,000 would only really be reasonable if 
business turnover was in the billions!
Reconciling Bank Accounts, Credit Card 
and Online Payment Gateway Accounts
Weekly tasks include some time spent reconciling your bank accounts, credit card 
and PayPal accounts. Refer to Chapter 8 for more on how and when to reconcile 
these accounts. If your accounts are reconciled in Xero, but the bank balances do 
not match in Xero or against your real bank balances, initially check the conver-
sion balance was entered correctly (refer to Chapter 2) and then review the Bank 
Reconciliation Summary. (Access this by clicking Reports → All Reports → Bank 
Reconciliation Summary, and then selecting the relevant bank account.)
The Bank Reconciliation Summary compares your Xero bank statement balance to 
the conversion balance in Xero of the transactions (plus Outstanding Payments, 
Less Outstanding Receipts Plus Un-Reconciled Bank Statement Lines). Note: For 
some banks, where the statement balance is imported, it also includes these bal-
ances. The report runs for individual accounts and on any date. When accessing 
this report, you can also click on two additional tabs, revealing the Imported 
Statement Lines and the Statement Exceptions report. (The Statement Exceptions 
report highlights transactions that don’t match a normally imported statement — 
for example, manually reconciled transactions, duplicates or deleted entries.)
On a day-to-day basis, if you need to investigate why bank accounts aren’t recon-
ciling, these reports can assist in identifying issues that may cause a discrepancy. 
Using the reports, you can crosscheck the detail within Xero to your actual bank 
account detail. Duplicate or manually entered transactions may need to be dealt 
with (refer to Chapter 8).
Speed up processing by having multiple Xero screens open at the same time. To 
view separate Xero files simultaneously, open them in different browsers, such as 
Google Chrome and Internet Explorer.
The Uncoded Statement Lines report is a useful report for working with your busi-
ness team through unreconciled transactions. You can export the report into a 
PDF or CSV format, and it includes most transaction details, including any exist-
ing comments. Notably, it doesn’t include a running bank balance, which is useful 
if you want your staff to help you resolve transaction issues but you don’t want 
them to know the bank balance.

268      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
Follow these steps to produce your Uncoded Statement Lines report:
1.	 From the main menu bar, click on Accounts → Bank Accounts, and then 
click on the button labelled Uncoded Statement Lines to access the 
report.
The report opens, with search criteria options along the top and a list of 
uncoded statement lines beneath.
2.	 From the drop-down options, select the criteria that are relevant for the 
bank account and period under review, and update the report.
The search criteria fields along the top read Bank Account, From, To Order By, 
and Sort Order. Essentially, the type of information you can enter or select is as 
follows:
•	 Bank Account: Select the bank account you want to review or choose All 
bank accounts from the drop-down menu.
•	 Date Range: Enter the period you want to review.
•	 Order By: You can sort the data by either Date, Payee, Particulars 
| Reference | Code, Amount, and Comments. The Date option is the 
most useful.
•	 Sort Order: Choose to sort your data in either ascending or descending 
order.
3.	 Click the Update button.
4.	 Click the PDF or CSV button, depending on your export preference.
The report downloads to your computer in your desired format.
Reconciling Your Clearing Accounts
A clearing account is an account used to temporarily contain a transaction that’s 
eventually coded to another account. For example, the other day a client acciden-
tally paid an invoice twice, so I allocated the receipt of money to the clearing 
account, and when I refunded the payment, it was refunded from the clearing 
account. The net effect was zero! Using the clearing account meant I could avoid 
allocating the transaction to income, and distorting income figures for that period. 
To check the account is running smoothly, you need to reconcile your clearing 
accounts at least monthly. Refer to Chapter 2 for guidance on setting up a clearing 
account in your chart of accounts.

CHAPTER 10  Mastering Your Weekly and Monthly Tasks      269
To reconcile clearing accounts, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on Reports → All Reports. Click in the Search Reports box and enter 
Account Transactions and click on the report.
2.	 Enter the relevant criteria and update the report.
The information to enter or select is as follows:
•	 Account field: Select the clearing account to reconcile.
•	 Date range: Enter the period under review. If this is the first time review-
ing the account, the From date needs to be the conversion date — that is, 
the date you started to use Xero.
•	 Cash basis: Check this option if you’re running the business on a cash 
basis. With new-style reports, click on Report Settings on the right to access 
the cash basis option.
3.	 Check the closing balance.
If the closing balance is nil, the account is reconciled. Congratulations! (If the 
balance isn’t nil, work through the tips following this list.)
4.	 Click the Publish button.
5.	 Enter the clearing account name and date range in the Title field and 
click the Publish button again.
For example, I would enter ‘Clearing Account 1/10/2016–31/12/2016’ to indicate 
the Clearing Account is reconciled from 1 October 2016 to 31 December 2016. 
The report is listed on the Reports dashboard under the Published tab, and 
can be referred to at a later date.
If the closing balance for your clearing account isn’t nil (meaning the account 
isn’t reconciled), try these tips:
»
» Export the report to Microsoft Excel or Google Docs (refer to Chapter 9 for 
guidance on exporting reports). Once you can open the report in spreadsheet 
format, you can more easily see (and highlight) matching transactions. Keep in 
mind that a few transactions may equal a single transaction, so you may need 
to juggle with the number to match them.
»
» Check your unmatched transactions. Unmatched transactions are referred to 
as unreconciled transactions and if you don’t know what they relate to, you 
may need to investigate further. For example, check they’ve been entered 
correctly, and amend as necessary. Identify if any transactions should have 
been coded to the clearing account in Xero, and if so, recode them.
»
» Talk to your accounts department about any unreconciled amounts so you 
can gather information about them and resolve the issue.

270      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
Reconciling Your Consumer  
Tax Control Account
Consumer tax collected and consumer tax paid (this includes GST, VAT and sales 
tax) by your business is allocated to a single consumer tax control account within 
Xero. When consumer tax is reported by the business, it again hits the consumer 
tax control account. As all consumer tax obligations go in and out of the single 
account, you can easily determine what consumer tax you owe to, or are owed by, 
your tax authority.
Reconcile your consumer tax account on a monthly basis by following these steps:
1.	 Check your organisation’s Financial Settings are correct.
From the home dashboard, click Settings → General Settings → Financial 
Settings. (Refer to Chapter 2 for further information.)
2.	 Check that all Consumer Tax Statements up to the last reporting period 
have been published.
Check the Published tab on the Reports dashboard to check what’s been 
published and when.
Some taxation authorities require submissions to be made in round or whole 
numbers. If this is applicable to your business, ensure the published reports 
meet these requirements.
3.	 Generate the Consumer Tax Reconciliation report via the Reports 
dashboard.
Make sure the report is from the start of the required tax period, and include 
the conversion balance if relevant.
This report can only be accessed by users with Adviser status or Standard 
users with the All Reports option within Xero, and is only available if the 
Financial Settings indicate the business is reporting consumer tax. The report 
reflects the cash or accruals basis, depending on the Financial Settings.
4.	 Check the closing balance.
Hopefully the unfiled consumer tax is negligible for periods that have been 
processed — any other amount indicates the consumer tax in the records 
doesn’t match what was paid for the period. (See the Tip later in this section for 
what you can do if the closing balance isn’t nil.) Amounts manually entered in 
the Adjustment or Filed fields are not retained in the report.

CHAPTER 10  Mastering Your Weekly and Monthly Tasks      271
Xero’s Consumer Tax Reconciliation report details:
»
» The reporting period: The GST, VAT or sales tax period as defined by the 
Financial Settings.
»
» Tax collected: Total consumer tax collected, sourced from all transactions 
dated in the respective period.
»
» Tax paid: Total consumer tax paid, sourced from all transactions dated in the 
respective period.
»
» Tax on imports: Sourced from all transactions dated in the respective period 
coded to GST/VAT or sales tax on imports, or GST/VAT or sales tax on capital 
imports.
»
» Adjustments: This figure can be manually entered, but must be a figure your 
relevant tax authority has agreed to. Don’t just enter your own adjustment 
figure here.
»
» Filed: This autofills from consumer tax reported on the published Activity 
statements. The entry can be overridden or, if upon reviewing the report you 
realised published Activity statements are incorrect, the published Activity 
statements can be deleted and republished with the actual figures reported to 
your tax authority.
»
» Unfiled: This provides a running balance of consumer tax collected less 
consumer tax adjustments and consumer tax filed. In some countries, the tax 
authority only transacts in whole numbers, so any balances here may be due 
to rounding.
Assuming you’re running the report for published periods only, if the closing bal-
ance for your Consumer Tax Reconciliation report isn’t nil, you can review the 
report and identify the difference. If this difference is only small, don’t worry 
about it. If it is significant, try to identify where the difference is and what caused it. 
You may need to speak to your Xero advisory team and/or the tax authority in your 
country of business about submitting a revised consumer tax report.
Ideally, information for Xero’s Consumer Tax Reconciliation report is sourced 
from the accuracy of other published reports. If you have manually entered data, 
publish the report for future reference.

272      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
Reviewing Your Business Information
You need to perform a number of different business review tasks on a regular basis. 
Reviewing your business information, such as your General Ledger Exception 
report, your invoicing, and your aged receivables and payables should be per-
formed on at least a monthly basis.
Spend time looking at your business information while you’re sharp and produc-
tive (usually first thing in the morning for most people). Make sure you allocate 
enough time to check and analyse reports, but don’t think you have to get through 
everything in one session. Spend 90 minutes working on your review, take a break 
and have a cuppa, and then start again. Hitting your records in regular 90-minute 
power sessions can help keep your records up to date and in tiptop condition!
SOLVING PROBLEMS BY USING THE 
ASSURANCE DASHBOARD
A Xero Adviser can access the Assurance dashboard to review how Xero is being used 
and identify issues that may need attention. From the Adviser tab on the main menu, 
select the Assurance dashboard to view four tabs:
•	 User Activity: A visual display of who has access to the organisation and their 
­activity over the past 12 months. This tab may highlight someone who should no 
longer be able to access the data, or who has unexpectedly accessed the accounts.
•	 Bank Accounts: This tab lists deleted statement lines and transactions that have 
been manually marked as reconciled across all your business bank accounts.
•	 Contacts: This tab lists duplicate or edited contact bank accounts. It may indicate 
an unknown relationship between different contacts, which is useful to know 
during commercial negotiations. However, it doesn’t compare to employee data, so 
you may unwittingly have contracted services to a business related to an employee. 
For example, a real estate agent may engage gardening services, and the agent’s 
office manager may manage a gardening service on the side and be pushing work 
in that direction, rather than seeking quotes to select the optimal service.
•	 Invoices & Bills: This tab lists invoices and bills that have been backdated. It may 
indicate that the date has been entered incorrectly and since corrected, but such 
changes may impact other areas, therefore causing potential problems.

CHAPTER 10  Mastering Your Weekly and Monthly Tasks      273
General Ledger Exceptions report
As the name suggests, the General Ledger Exceptions report highlights extraordi-
nary transactions, or unusual variations, in your business records. These can be 
transactions that have been coded differently to the default tax code of the account 
they were posted too, or transactions that are 2.5 standard deviations higher or 
lower than the norm. That’s a fancy way of saying they’re a certain amount higher 
or lower than the average transaction posted to the account. (For example, a trans-
action of $60,000 appearing in an account where the average transaction is $200.)
Xero’s General Ledger Exceptions report can be accessed from the home dash-
board, by clicking Reports → All Reports → General Ledger and then clicking on 
the General Ledger Exception tab.
Select the relevant period and review the highlighted transactions to check whether 
you consider them to be correct. Transactional information provided includes: 
Date, Type, Reason, Transaction, Reference, Debit, Credit and Consumer Tax.
Invoicing
Ideally, getting paid up-front for the products or services you provide is the best 
solution but it’s not always possible! If you work with certain customers on an 
ongoing basis, keeping detailed records of what to bill them is vital. This can be 
done by creating a draft invoice and repeatedly editing and saving it during the 
period you work with the customer (on, say, a project that continues over many 
months), until it’s time to invoice the customer. To ensure positive cash flow for 
your business, invoicing needs to be undertaken on a timely basis.
Use a time tracking tool, such as MinuteDock or TSheets, to record time worked on 
different projects and for different clients. You can then push these details into 
Xero invoices on a periodic basis. It helps you keep on top of your invoicing, espe-
cially if you frequently move between projects.
If you’re working on a long-term project with a customer, don’t wait till the end 
of the project to invoice them. For example, your terms could include invoicing 
them with a running total at the end of every month. Establish invoicing terms 
and invoice regularly!
If your customer is a bigger fish than you, and in a stronger position to dictate 
payment terms, clearly understand the terms and enter them in the customer’s 
Contact details at the Sales Invoice Default Due Date field in Xero. And make sure 

274      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
you fit in with their terms to your advantage. If, for example, their terms are pay-
ment 60 days after end of month, make sure you send your invoices out at the end 
of the month, rather than at the beginning of the following month. It could mean 
the difference of 30 days for receiving payment! (Of course, the typical payment 
terms of Xero users are 7 days, 14 days or 30 days.)
Establish and maintain a regular time of the week or month for:
»
» Updating invoicing details
»
» Reviewing and approving draft invoices
»
» Issuing invoices
Refer to Chapter 6 for everything you need to know about creating and issuing 
invoices in Xero, including adding details to particular invoice fields.
Aged Receivables
If all outstanding invoices have been entered and bank reconciliations are up to 
date (refer to Chapters 6 and 8), the Aged Receivables report should be reviewed 
to follow up with customers who owe the business money. This outstanding 
invoice information can be found on Xero’s home dashboard, within the Money 
Coming In block. For more detail, you can access three Aged Receivables reports 
via the Reports dashboard area: The classic Aged Receivables, the new Aged 
Receivables Detail, and the new Aged Receivables Summary.
Chase outstanding invoices by following these steps:
1.	 View the Aged Receivables report and identify debts that have been 
outstanding the longest.
All current sales are listed on the Aged Receivables report. Identify outstanding 
debts by referring to transactions in the ‘older’ column on the right.
2.	 Access the detail for customers with the longest outstanding debts.
On the classic Aged Receivable report, click the drop-down arrow to the right of 
the invoice amount and select Show Invoices. Right-click and, at the drop-down 
arrow, select something similar to ‘Open in new tab’ to access the detail of the 
invoice with this customer.
On the new-generation Aged Receivables Detail report, hover over the line 
detailing the invoice, right-click and select something similar to ‘Open in new 
tab’ to see the detail.

CHAPTER 10  Mastering Your Weekly and Monthly Tasks      275
Using the method outlined in this step means you never have to close the main 
report, and you can repeatedly access the underlying detail.
3.	 Apply any available outstanding credits against the relevant invoice by 
clicking the blue Credit this Invoice link, entering the amount in the 
Amount to Credit field and clicking Allocate Credit.
If the credit amount is for a specific invoice, it should be matched against that 
invoice. After applying the credit, you return to the invoice detail.
4.	 Check the top-left corner of the invoice for a dark green tick and the 
word Sent.
This tick and Sent should appear beside Awaiting Payment, and they indicate 
the invoice has been emailed. If Sent doesn’t appear here, perhaps the 
customer hasn’t received their copy of the invoice. If the green tick is faded, 
the email link of the invoice has not been clicked on by the client. You need to 
review how you’re issuing invoices to this customer. Get in contact with them 
and confirm the email or mailing address you should be sending invoices to. 
(Aghhh! Drives me crazy, but some people still prefer to receive invoices by 
snail mail.)
5.	 Once you’ve established the invoice has been sent, and you believe the 
customer has seen the invoice, call the customer’s accounts payable 
department (or whoever is in charge of paying invoices).
Put on your friendly yet professional voice for the call. Confirm the customer 
has the invoice, ask if any issues exist with it, and establish when they intend to 
pay. Keep the conversation jovial, establish a connection and, once you’ve 
found out the person’s name, add it to the notes section of the customer’s 
Contact details in Xero (if this is new information).
The Money Coming In block on Xero’s home dashboard shows invoices due for 
payment, so you can check the ones that will be overdue soon. If I have spare 
time, I make my phone call to the person in charge of making payments before 
my invoice is overdue, to sort out any discrepancies ahead of time.
6.	 Repeat Steps 2 to 5 for the remaining debtors identified in Step 1.
You can also use other ways to encourage timely payment of invoices, such as 
activating the Invoice Reminder feature. I discuss these options in detail in 
Chapter 6.
Send out Activity statements to your customers through Xero on a monthly basis. 
Doing so is quick and easy, and provides another method of keeping in front of 
your customers. (Refer to Chapter  6 for guidance on sending out Activity 
statements.)

276      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
The Smart List feature (refer to Chapter 5 for guidance on how to use this feature) 
empowers you to create a list of outstanding debtors, and export the customer 
details to an online tool such as Constant Contact (www.constantcontact.com). 
This tool can then send out emails about the outstanding invoices. As well, various 
add-ons are available that plug into Xero, review aged receivables and automagi-
cally contact customers about outstanding debts, utilising emails, SMS and old-
fashioned telephone calls. See Chapter 16 for more on add-on solutions.
Aged Payables
If all outstanding bills have been entered and bank reconciliations are up to date 
(refer to Chapters 7 and 8), the Aged Payables report reveals who the business 
owes money too. The outstanding billing information can be found on the home 
dashboard, within the Money Going Out block, and in more detail on the Aged 
Payables report located on the Reports dashboard.
Follow up on outstanding bills by following these steps:
1.	 View the Aged Payables report and identify outstanding bills that need to 
be paid.
Some bills, such as insurance, may be recorded in the system and automati-
cally paid monthly, so you will see it here, but they don’t form part of your 
current payments due right now.
2.	 Identify if any credit notes have been received, or if any invoices have 
been issued to the contacts whom you owe money to, and apply these to 
the relevant bill.
UNDERSTANDING THE ‘DUDES  
YOU OWE MONEY TO’
An established Brisbane designer told me that, when she was dealing with family illness, 
her suppliers kept her business afloat and provided her with immense emotional sup-
port during the difficult times. Life never stays the same, and now life is good again — in 
fact, it’s better, because she has a really strong bond with her suppliers. The ‘dudes you 
owe money to’ can’t be defined so simply. They’re an intrinsic part of your business suc-
cess. Treat them with respect, pay them on time and communicate with them if pay-
ment is going to be late.

CHAPTER 10  Mastering Your Weekly and Monthly Tasks      277
3.	 Prepare and process payments.
If payments are likely to be delayed, communicate this with the contact. In 
some instances, this may hamper future supply of materials; however, 
communicating this information may also keep important channels open and 
enhance relationships.
Reporting to Your Tax Authority
During the 1990s I lived through several Canadian winters with my young chil-
dren. When we visited local shops, I’d zip my son into a thickly padded winter 
suit, clip him into a pram, step outside, pick up the pram and tramp through thick 
snow carrying the pram, my son, handbag and anything else needed for a trip to 
the shops. Once safely inside the shop doors (and central heating), clothes had to 
be hurriedly stripped off or we would overheat! Quite a bizarre daily ritual for a 
girl used to the sun and heat of Australia’s Gold Coast!
Whenever I purchased something in Canada, I never knew quite what I would pay. 
I could pay shelf price, or shelf price plus PST (Provincial State Tax) or shelf price 
plus GST (Goods and Services Tax) or a combination of PST and GST — and it 
seems they now have HST (Harmonized Sales Tax). It was so confusing.
Don’t let complex regulatory requirements dampen your entrepreneurial spirit. 
Xero has adapted its software to different jurisdictions and, depending on the 
option chosen when setting up the data file (refer to Chapter 2), features are avail-
able to suit your needs.
The following sections cover reporting in different countries. If your business is a 
multinational, you may be operating more than one Xero organisation and so you 
may need to read more than one section; if, however, you’re focused on local 
operations, just check out the section relevant to you.
Note: Over the next few pages I outline what features are available, where they are 
and how to use them, but I can’t tell you what to enter. Why? Firstly, you should 
seek specialist advice specific to your own circumstances and, secondly, this book 
would be out of date in a nanosecond if I tried to cover governments’ changing  
tax laws!
Prior to preparing a return for your tax authority, double check that your financial 
settings are correct — found at Settings → General Settings → Financial Settings. 
(Refer to Chapter 2 for assistance with completing the financial settings, or speak 
with your tax accountant.)

278      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
Australian reporting
Businesses based in Australia report to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). 
Depending on their operations and registration with the ATO, they may report on 
GST (Goods and Services Tax), PAYG (Pay As You Go) tax withheld, PAYG Instal-
ments, FBT (Fringe Benefits Tax) and WET (Wine Equalisation Tax). This is done 
via Instalment Activity Statements (IAS) and Business Activity Statements (BAS). 
Many combinations of registration options are possible, so not all IAS and BAS 
look the same.
If your business operates in the building industry, you’re also required to submit 
a Taxable Payment Annual Report to the ATO.
IAS preparation
An IAS is a form used to report PAYG tax withheld. It is prepared on a monthly 
basis and can only be prepared by users with Adviser status or Standard users with 
the All Reports option in Xero.
A business does not necessarily need to be registered for GST to prepare and sub-
mit an IAS; however, if you are not registered for GST, do not select None from the 
drop-down menu at the GST Accounting Method field within Financial Settings 
(refer to Chapter 2 for more). You must select either Cash Basis or Accruals Basis 
to access your IAS in Xero.
To complete the IAS, follow these steps:
1.	 Confirm accounts are complete for the relevant period.
2.	 Process all payroll for the period and print the Payroll Activity Summary 
report.
3.	 From the home dashboard, access the IAS by clicking Adviser → Activity 
Statement, entering the relevant period, selecting Instalment Activity 
Statement and clicking the Update button.
Standard users with the All Reports option need to click Reports → All 
Reports → Activity Statement.
4.	 Fill out the required fields in the IAS.
The W1: Total Salaries and W2: PAYG Withholding payroll fields autopopulate 
in the IAS. However, not everything filters through automatically. If you have a 
payroll opening balance or an employee termination payment amount that 
you need to add, for example, you can use the information from your Payroll 
Activity Summary report to double check and manually override the autopopu-
lated fields.

CHAPTER 10  Mastering Your Weekly and Monthly Tasks      279
You need to fill out the following fields in the IAS:
•	 W4: Amounts where no ABN is quoted
•	 W3: Other Amounts
•	 7 or 5B: Deferred Company/Fund Instalment or Credit from PAYG Income 
Tax Instalment Variation (the ATO will advise you if an amount needs to go 
in either of these fields)
•	 PAYG Instalment Income Tax
•	 Fringe Benefits Tax
•	 Fuel Tax Credits
•	 Wine Equalisation Tax
PAYG Tax Withheld information can autopopulate W1 and W2 on the Activity 
Statements. To activate, click Settings → Payroll Settings → Pay Items → 
Earnings, click on the relevant wage category, and check the box beside 
Reportable as W1 on the Activity Statement.
5.	 Publish the IAS.
Refer to Chapter 9 for guidance on publishing reports.
After publishing your IAS within Xero, you still need to submit the IAS to the 
ATO. The document can’t be printed from Xero and submitted. The information 
from the report needs to be entered onto the ATO business portal (bp.ato.gov.au) 
or onto the ATO’s paper copy of the form and submitted.
BAS preparation
A BAS is a form used by a business registered for GST in Australia to report GST, 
PAYG tax withheld, PAYG Instalments, FBT and WET. It may be prepared on a 
monthly, quarterly or annual basis, and can only be prepared by users with Adviser 
status or Standard Users with the All Reports option within Xero.
To complete the BAS, follow these steps:
1.	 Confirm all accounts are complete for the relevant period.
2.	 Process all payroll for the period and access the Payroll Activity Summary 
report so it’s available for you to cross-check data.
Make a note of payroll information for the reporting period, because this field 
doesn’t autofill.

280      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
3.	 From the home dashboard, access the BAS by clicking on Adviser → 
Activity Statement, entering the relevant period, selecting Business 
Activity Statement and clicking the Update button.
Standard users with the All Reports option need to click Reports → All 
Reports → Activity Statement.
4.	 Fill out the required fields in the BAS.
The GST and payroll fields autopopulate in the BAS. The W1: Total Salaries 
and W2: PAYG Withholding payroll fields autopopulate in the BAS. However, 
not everything filters through automatically. If you have a payroll opening 
balance or an employee termination payment amount that you need to add, 
you can use information from your Payroll Activity Summary report to double 
check and manually override the autopopulated fields.
You need to fill out the following fields in the BAS:
•	 W4: Amounts where no ABN is quoted
•	 W3: Other Amounts
•	 7 or 5B: Deferred Company/Fund Instalment or Credit from PAYG Income 
Tax Instalment Variation (the ATO will advise you if an amount needs to go 
in either of these fields)
•	 PAYG Instalment Income Tax
•	 Fringe Benefits Tax
•	 Fuel Tax Credits
•	 Wine Equalisation Tax
PAYG Tax Withheld information can autopopulate W1 and W2 on the Activity 
Statements. To activate, click Settings → Payroll Settings → Pay Items → 
Earnings, click on the relevant wage category, and check the box beside 
Reportable as W1 on the Activity Statement.
5.	 Request that your Adviser reviews the report (if required) by clicking on You 
Can Ask Your Adviser or Accountant to Review It in the green box above.
This option appears once the report data is prepared. If you click this link, the 
Request Review window opens.
6.	 Select the Adviser to review the BAS from the drop-down list, enter a 
message in the field box and click Send.
An email is sent to the adviser, requesting a review of the BAS and including 
instructions on where to find the report.
7.	 Once satisfied all details are correct, publish the BAS.
Refer to Chapter 9 for guidance on publishing reports.

CHAPTER 10  Mastering Your Weekly and Monthly Tasks      281
After publishing your BAS within Xero, you still need to submit the BAS to the 
ATO. The document can’t be printed from Xero and submitted. The information 
from the report needs to be entered onto the ATO business portal (bp.ato.gov.au) 
or onto the ATO’s paper copy of the form and submitted.
The data for the GST Reconciliation report within Xero is sourced from the pub-
lished BAS in Xero — another reason you should publish the report!
Australian Xero partners can submit the Activity Statement via Xero Tax, so you 
may want to utilise their BAS Agency services to assist you with submitting it.
Taxable Payment Annual Report
Australian businesses operating in the building industry are required to submit a 
Taxable Payment Annual Report (TPAR) to the ATO, declaring payments made to 
contractors.
Before accessing the TPAR, create a new Contact Group called Contractors and add 
to it all contractors that need to be reported on. (Refer to Chapter 5 for more on 
setting up Contact Groups.)
To then access the TPAR, from the dashboard click Reports → All Reports → 
­Taxable Payment Annual Report. Click on the blue Set up Rules button, and the 
Taxable Payments Rules window opens.
In the Payments To field, click on the drop-down menu and select the Contact 
Group Contractors. In the Paid From field, click on the drop-down menu and 
select the general ledger code associated with contractor payments. If necessary. 
add further rules to filter to the requirements. Click the green Save button and, if 
required, update contractor contact details (refer to Chapter 5).
Once the report is updated, click the green Export ATO Format button. The ­Confirm 
Your Details window opens. Confirm the details by clicking the green Confirm 
button. The report is exported to your desktop, and from there can be uploaded to 
the ATO portal.
New Zealand reporting
Businesses based in New Zealand report to Inland Revenue depending on their 
operations and registration. They may report on GST, FBT (Fringe Benefits Tax) 
and ESCT (Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax). The GST is reported via 
the GST Return and Provisional Tax Return.

282      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
A GST Return is a form used to report GST and is prepared on a monthly, bimonthly 
or half-yearly basis. It can be prepared by users with Standard and Adviser status 
within Xero.
To prepare your GST Return, follow these steps:
1.	 From the dashboard, access the GST Return by selecting Reports → All 
Reports → GST Return.
If you can’t see any tax report, it means the file has been set up without 
activating GST. No worries! Click on Settings → General Settings → Financial 
Settings and fill out the GST fields. If you’re unsure what goes here, ask your 
business adviser.
2.	 Enter your business’s GST details in the Enter Your GST Details block.
The available fields are as follows:
•	 GST Number: Your business’s GST registration number, otherwise known 
as its Inland Revenue number
•	 Accounting Basis: Choose between Invoice Basis and Payments Basis
•	 Frequency: Monthly, Two Monthly or Six Monthly
•	 Tax Form: GST Only (GST101) or GST and Provisional Tax (GST103)
•	 Next Period Due: Various period options, depending on filing frequency
Editing your GST details only needs to be done once, but they can be updated 
at any time. Once information has been entered in all fields, the Save button 
activates. Click the blue Save button to save the selected options.
The GST Returns dashboard opens. Across the top of this dashboard are tabs 
for Due Now and Final Reports, and on the far right is an Edit GST Details 
hyperlink. The relevant draft GST returns populate under the Due Now tab. If 
no GST Return appears, click on the hyperlink Preview Period So Far to view the 
data that has populated the return to date. Click through a draft GST return to 
access three report tabs: GST Return, Provisional Return and GST Audit Report.
These reports are used as follows:
•	 GST Return: An online worksheet for the GST portion of the Inland 
Revenue’s GST and Provisional Tax Return.
•	 Provisional Return: An online worksheet for the provisional tax portion of 
Inland Revenue’s GST and Provisional Tax Return.
•	 GST Audit Report: Provides summaries of the individual GST transactions 
that are reflected in the GST Return. From this report, you can drill down to 
the transaction detail.

CHAPTER 10  Mastering Your Weekly and Monthly Tasks      283
If the GST basis has changed, Xero is not able to calculate the adjustments 
required, so you need to do this manually. Also, the GST in this report is 
sourced from GST allocated to transactions during the relevant period. GST 
coded purely to the GST account is not reported here. The figures on the GST 
Return can’t be edited unless they’re sourced from adjustment fields.
3.	 Review the accuracy of the GST Return, Provisional Return, GST Audit 
Report, and Late GST Claims.
Not all these forms may be visible — it depends on whether they’re relevant to 
your current set-up.
4.	 To finalise the report, click the green Save button and select Save Final.
The Prepared By window pops open.
5.	 Beside the Author field, click on the drop-down options, choose the 
relevant Author and then click the green Save button.
The finalised GST Return report appears with the GST Return and Provisional 
Return tab at the top of the GST Returns dashboard. From here, you can check 
the report.
6.	 Once satisfied the report is correct, click the green File Now with IRD 
button.
You’re taken to the Inland Revenue login page to authenticate and file your 
return from Xero. You need an authorised myIR account for your organisation, 
and the relevant login details, to submit the return. Visit www.ird.govt.nz/ to 
register for one.
7.	 Click the blue Publish button, complete fields as necessary to publish the 
report (see Figure 10-1), and click the green Save button.
For guidance on publishing reports, refer to Chapter 9. Download the PDF, 
acknowledging that the GST Return has been submitted, and save it in your file 
storage area.
For future GST reports to be correctly generated, the current GST Return must be 
published in Xero!
When the GST Return has been filed, the underlying data is locked. If any changes 
are made after this point, they feed through to the next return (if the option 
Include Late Claims has been ticked for the next return).
For guidance on completing the GST Reconciliation report in Xero, refer to the 
earlier section ‘Reconciling Your Consumer Tax Control Account’.

US reporting
Businesses based in the United States report to the federal Internal Revenue 
­Services (IRS) and also a state-based department of revenue. Each state has dif-
ferent rates, jurisdictions and requirements. Depending on their operations and 
registration, they may periodically file Sales Tax reports.
Within Xero, two tax reports are available for US users: Sales Tax Report and  
Form 1099.
To view the Sales Tax Report, from the home dashboard click on Reports → Sales 
Tax Report. The Sales Tax Summary window then pops up with date range options 
and three options to define how the report is shown: Tax Rate, Tax Component 
and Account Type Show. The report summarises the financial settings of the busi-
ness, and the taxes by Tax Component for the period.
The Sales Tax Audit report appears on the second tab, detailing the taxes by Tax 
Component for the period. Prepare, review and publish the report as is required by

your jurisdiction. You must transfer the information from the Sales Tax Report 
form and file according to IRS and state requirements.
Xero’s US edition has Form 1099, which can be used to report different sorts of 
income to the IRS. Note: Only users with Adviser status can set up Xero’s Form 
1099, and only those on standard and premium plans have access to Form 1099.
The following steps show you how to set up your Form 1099 in Xero, using the 
example of reporting income paid to contractors. To set up Form 1099, follow 
these steps:
1.	 Create a Contact Group for contractors who may need to be reported via 
Form 1099.
Corporations should not be included in this group. Refer to Chapter 5 for 
guidance on creating Contact Groups in Xero.
2.	 From the home dashboard, go to Reports → All Reports and, in the box on 
the right, search for 1099 Report.
The first time you access the 1099 report, a set-up screen appears with 
guidance.
3.	 Click the blue Set Up 1099 Rules link.
The 1099 Rules window appears.
4.	 Select the contractors Contact Group in the Payments To drop-down field.
This is the group set up at Step 1.
5.	 Select All Accounts in the Paid From drop-down field and select Box 7: 
Non-Employee Compensation in the Report As drop-down field.
6.	 Click the Add Rule button (as required).
This allows you to add extra rules to meet your 1099 report requirements. 
If unsure, speak to your tax accountant about what additional requirements 
may be necessary.
7.	 Click the green Save button.
This saves the 1099 Rules. A summary of contractors and transactions 
captured by the rules appears on the 1099 Reports dashboard. Any transac-
tions not meeting the IRS threshold are filtered out.
8.	 Check for red Missing Details text and add text as required.
If the Missing Details text appears, click through and enter the required contact 
details, including Tax Id Number of the contact.

286      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
9.	Click the green Save button to update details.
Repeat Steps 8 and 9 for all contacts with missing details.
10.	Review included transactions by going to Reports → All Reports → 1099 
Report and clicking on an individual contact.
The transactions for the contact appear at the bottom of the screen.
11.	Untick any transactions not required in the 1099 Report.
PayPal, credit cards and foreign currency payments are excluded from the 
transaction list.
12.	Click the green Save button to update details.
13.	Click the green Use e-File Services button and click Track1099 or Tax1099 
to produce and file your 1099 Report online.
Xero is integrated with Track1099 (www.track1099.com) and Tax1099  
(www.tax1099.com), companies that can securely e-file Form 1099 to the 
IRS — ­helping you with your productivity.
The first time you click on either option, you’re taken to the sign-up page for a 
Xero client. Once you’ve created an account with the company of your choice, 
you can import the Xero data.
If you don’t want to file the 1099 Report electronically, click the blue Export 
button, and export a CSV file.
Sales tax in the United States is not a one-size-fits-all topic, because of the dif-
ferent state-based reporting requirements. For further information and resources 
on US sales tax, check out Avalara’s website (www.avalara.com/learn).
UK reporting
Businesses based in the United Kingdom report to HM Revenue and Customs 
(HMRC). Depending on their operations and registration with HMRC, businesses 
may report on VAT (Value Added Tax) via a VAT Return or a Flat Rate VAT Return.
Note: PAYE (Pay As You Earn) and Class 1 National Insurance contributions are 
reported via Payroll.
To prepare your VAT Return within Xero, follow these steps:
1.	 From the dashboard, access the VAT Return by selecting Reports → VAT 
Return.
The VAT Return dashboard opens. Across the top are two tabs, as follows:

CHAPTER 10  Mastering Your Weekly and Monthly Tasks      287
•	 VAT Return: An online worksheet for the VAT portion of the HMRC VAT 
Return.
•	 VAT Audit Report: Provides summaries of individual VAT transactions that 
are reflected in the VAT Return. From this report, you can drill down to the 
transaction detail.
2.	 Select the period month end from the Ending: field drop-down options 
and select Update to refresh the report.
The VAT in Xero’s VAT Audit Report is sourced from VAT allocated to transactions 
during the period. VAT coded purely to the VAT account is not reported here.
3.	 Review the accuracy of the VAT Return, and VAT Audit Report.
Check the Include VAT Late Claims box to include all late claims in the figures.
4.	 When you’re satisfied that the report is correct, click the green File VAT 
Now . . . button, complete fields as necessary to publish the report, and 
select the green File and Publish button.
The File VAT Return window opens. To file the VAT Return online, register with 
HMRC for online filing; you need to obtain a Gateway user ID and a password.
5.	 At the File VAT Return window, check the box ‘File now with HMRC’, enter 
your Gateway user ID and password, confirm your 9-digit VAT number, 
and click File & Publish.
The All Reports dashboard opens at the tab ‘Filed with HMRC’. The column 
headed Status highlights the stage the filed VAT Return is at with HMRC.
You also receive an email confirming receipt of successful submission.
To prepare your Flat Rate VAT Return within Xero, follow these steps:
1.	 Head over to Settings → General Settings → Financial Settings and change 
the VAT Scheme to either the Flat Rate Accrual or Flat Rate Cash Scheme 
option.
Click the green button labelled Save to save any updates here. Speak to your 
accountant if you need further assistance.
2.	 From the dashboard, access the VAT Return by selecting Reports → VAT 
Return.
The Flat Rate VAT Return dashboard opens. Across the top are two tabs, as 
follows:
•	 Flat Rate VAT Return: An online worksheet for the VAT portion of the 
HMRC VAT Return.

288      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
•	 VAT Audit Report: Provides summaries of individual VAT transactions that 
are reflected in the VAT Return. From this report, you can drill down to the 
transaction details.
3.	 Select the period or month end from the date options, enter the Flat Rate 
Percentage:, and select Update to refresh the report.
Follow the steps for preparing a VAT Return within Xero from Step 3 onwards 
(refer to preceding list).
For future VAT Reports to be correctly generated, the current VAT Return must be 
filed in Xero! If you choose not to electronically file your VAT Return with HMRC 
via Xero, you can still publish it and file it the regular way.
If you realise that the VAT Audit Report needs to be amended, you can delete the 
published report, and then rerun the report, adjust it and publish it. You can also 
check the box Include VAT Late Claims to include all late claims in the figures. 
However, you can’t file it with HMRC for the same period a second time; you’ll 
need to contact them about the adjustment.
The EC Sales Lists report provides detail and summary of sales made to customers 
within the European Community and produces reports that can be customised for 
filing with HMRC. Customer and sales details need to be complete to generate an 
accurate report. The report is for government monitoring imports and exports 
across the European Community, and no payment is required.
For further guidance on completing the VAT Reconciliation report, refer to the 
earlier section ‘Reconciling Your Consumer Tax Control Account’.
Recording payments to your tax authority
After preparing a submission for your respective tax authority, a payment or a 
refund is recorded. To enter the payment or refund in Xero, add the tax authority 
as a contact in your file. Enter a payment as a bill (refer to Chapter 7 for guidance 
on entering bills) and enter a refund as an invoice (refer to Chapter 6 for guidance 
on entering invoices).
Entering either a bill or an invoice for your tax payment or refund helps ensure 
your Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Bank Balance are correct.
If different sorts of tax have been paid or refunded, split out the transaction and 
allocate accordingly to ensure the accuracy of the account.

CHAPTER 10  Mastering Your Weekly and Monthly Tasks      289
Taking Advantage of Xero’s 
Budget Functions
When I lived in Cheltenham in the United Kingdom, I worked as a business-­
planning analyst for a FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) company. I was 
responsible for developing budgets for the Private Label division. (Private Labels 
are products repackaged with home-label branding.) I dealt with a wide range of 
items, including cheese, chocolate, coffee and custard! Calculating cost price was 
challenging, because each product had a slightly different recipe depending on its 
branding, and many ingredients were sourced from overseas, with freight and 
currency fluctuation implications. Every year, considerable time and effort went 
into developing an annual budget. Every month, actual results were compared to 
the annual budget forecast and anomalies were analysed and dealt with. Every 
quarter, the annual budget was revised to build in known changes (to the market 
for the goods, but also to the overall market and economy), so actuals ended up 
being compared to both the annual budget and the revised budget!
THINK GLOBALLY, ACT LOCALLY
While Xero offers several country-customised versions, a global generic version, avail-
able for the rest of the world, is also available. Whether the user be in Port Perry (home 
of the best hot chocolate I’ve ever tasted) or Paris, they can access all the basic function-
ality of Xero, which includes bank feeds and online access. Users of the global Xero ver-
sion need to be aware of three key aspects: Tax Rates, Tax Reporting and Add-ons.
Take, for example, Canada: Canadian consumer taxes are complicated because they 
differ across provinces and territories and may incorporate federal and provincial sales 
tax or a combination of both, known as a harmonized tax. If the business needs to 
record a particular consumer tax, the tax needs to be defined as a tax rate. (For insights 
into setting up tax rates, refer to Chapter 2.) Segregated tax information filters through 
to the Sales Tax report and can be transposed on to forms for submission to relevant 
tax authorities.
If you’re using the global Xero version and you have a particular requirement, such as 
you need to generate checks or run country-specific payroll, you can integrate a solution 
from the Xero marketplace (see www.xero.com/add-ons/ for further information). For 
guidance on using add-on solutions, see Chapter 16.

290      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
Fortunately, not all budgets need to be as complicated as the preceding scenario. 
However, preparing budgets and forecasts of planned business income and 
­expenditure, which also capture the macro-economy and its potential effect on 
the business, is good business practice. A budget can incorporate planning for 
future financing, evaluate business performance, encourage responsible spending 
and help set motivational goals.
Preparing and analysing a budget is like fine-tuning your own business radar. The 
process helps in understanding the business’s operating environment, and what 
has led to current performance and outcomes. Sitting back and being happy with 
outstanding business performance isn’t good enough! You need to understand 
what led to that outcome so you can repeat it again (and again and again).
In the following sections, I cover creating and reviewing a budget within Xero.
Initially, obtaining all the information required to prepare a budget may be diffi-
cult, so you can treat it as a work in progress. Add to the budget as you understand 
business transactions — just don’t ignore it because you think it’s too hard!
Creating a budget
To create a new 12-month annual profit and loss budget for the next financial year 
in Xero, follow these steps:
1.	 From the main dashboard, click Reports → Budget Manager.
This opens the Budget Manager dashboard (see Figure 10-2).
2.	 At the Select Budget field, click on the drop-down menu and select Add 
New Budget.
The Add New Budget window appears.
Note: You do have an Overall Budget just sitting there that you can edit; 
however, these steps explain how to create a budget from scratch so you have 
the knowledge to create a new one and edit the existing one.
3.	 Fill out the Name field.
Use something clear and simple, such as Annual Budget [year], replacing [year] 
with the relevant year.
If you’ve set up Tracking in Xero (see Chapter 12), you can filter the budget by 
the Tracking categories here. If you want to amend the Tracking options, or 
create a copy of the budget for another purpose, click on the blue Edit link 
beside the name of the budget on the dashboard.

CHAPTER 10  Mastering Your Weekly and Monthly Tasks      291
4.	 Click the green Save button to save the budget’s name.
5.	 Click on the Start field’s drop-down list and select the month your 
financial year starts in.
6.	 Click on the Actuals field’s drop-down list and select 12 months.
Once selected, your business’s actual data for the last 12 months fills out on 
the left of the spreadsheet.
7.	 Click on the Period field’s drop-down list and select 12 months.
Once selected, blank fields for 12 months open to the right of the spreadsheet. 
This is where you need to enter your budget figures.
8.	 Click on the blue Update button to update the criteria selected.
Review the data using the horizontal and vertical scroll bars. At the far right is a 
total column, summing the full 24 months of data.

9.	Enter data by cell or column, as follows:
•	 Enter data in the first blank cell and click the green arrow that 
appears beside the cell and the month heading.
The Apply Formula window opens, displaying short-cut options to adjust 
and copy the cell’s data for future months.
•	 Enter data in a column and click the green arrow that appears beside 
the month heading.
The Apply Formula to All Accounts window opens, displaying short-cut 
options to adjust and copy the column’s data for future months, or to clear 
all data.
As you’re entering budget data, intermittently click the green Save button to 
avoid timing out and losing data.
10.	Save, Delete or Cancel, as required.
The budget is saved by clicking the green Save button, deleted by clicking the 
red Delete button and editing is discarded by clicking the grey Cancel button.
Data can be manually entered in each cell, copied across other cells or columns 
through using the short-cut options, or added to CSV spreadsheets (such as 
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets) and imported into the budget.
Improve your productivity by downloading a template customised to the criteria 
of your newly created budget in Xero. Access the template by clicking the blue 
Import button on the Budget Manager dashboard, which brings up the Import a 
Budget screen. From here, click the Download Template button. The template will 
download to your Downloads folder and can be used to develop a budget within a 
CSV spreadsheet (such as an Excel spreadsheet). You can then import this file back 
into Xero at the Import a Budget screen. Click the blue Browse button, select the 
saved spreadsheet and click the blue Import button. (Refer to Chapter 3 for infor-
mation on working with CSV files.)
Reviewing and editing your budget
After you’ve created a budget (refer to preceding section), you need to review it on 
at least a monthly (if not weekly) basis, looking at budgeted versus actual figures. 
After reviewing your budget, you may need to edit it to more accurately reflect 
expectations for the business in the current climate.
To edit an existing budget in Xero, go to the Select Budget field on the home dash-
board, click on the drop-down arrow and select the required budget. The Budget 
Manager dashboard appears and you can edit fields as required.

CHAPTER 10  Mastering Your Weekly and Monthly Tasks      293
Xero offers reports such as the Budget Variance report, which details budgeted 
versus actual performance and helps give you a better understanding of your 
business — see Chapter 12 for more. You can add monthly, quarterly or yearly 
budget data to the new-style reports, and even customise the date range; refer to 
Chapter 9 for guidance on how to do this.
Setting a Period Lock Date
Lock dates prevent users from altering accounts prior to and inclusive of the set 
date. Advisers can set and change the lock date, selecting an earlier or later date 
as required.
To access lock dates, click Settings → General Settings → Financial Settings. There 
are two types of lock dates. The first one stops all users (except Advisers) making 
changes on and before a particular date. The second one stops all users (including 
Advisers) making changes on and before a particular date.
From the drop-down date menu, select the date and click Save. (For more on end 
of financial year reporting, and year end lock dates, see Chapter 11.)

End of Financial Year 
Reporting
A
 tax accountant once told me he’d saved his client $40,000 in taxes. He 
didn’t really save the client money. He did what a good tax accountant is 
supposed to do  — review the business to legitimately minimise tax 
expenses. Tax is a significant expense — if not the single largest expense — for 
many businesses. A tax bill has sent many a business into bankruptcy. Scary, huh! 
So you need to give your business’s preparation for the end of financial year the 
attention it deserves. With Xero (and your reliable Xero advisory team) by your 
side, all processes become a lot easier. You’ll be back to the money-making side of 
your business in no time!
In this chapter, I cover everything you need to know about the tasks you and/or 
your bookkeeper can undertake for the end of the financial year, and provide lots 
of tips for working with your tax accountant, helping you perform the Martha 
Stewart of all spring cleans of your accounts. I include information on the prepa-
ration your business can do in-house, including reconciling, reviewing and tidy-
ing up your records. I then outline what your tax accountant does with the data 
file at the end of the financial year.
Like regular cleaning that you perform year-round, you should take advantage of 
the collaborative nature of Xero and review any issues as they arise with your 
accountant on a regular basis throughout the financial year. However, for any 
issues you’ve been putting off, you have the opportunity to sort them out now or

make a note and alert your tax accountant to them — hence the spring clean nature 
of this activity.
Getting Ready for the End  
of the Financial Year
In Australia around the middle of the year, a commercial runs on TV wishing 
everyone a ‘Happy EOFYS!’ (EOFYS here stands for end of financial year sale.) So, 
what is the end of the financial year, and what does it mean for the small- 
business owner? The financial year is a 12-month period of a business’s accounting 
records. A business financial year may not align with the governing country’s 
financial year or a calendar year. If the business has ties with an international 
organisation, all associated businesses may opt to report across the same period. 
Or it may make more sense to align with a different period — for instance, many 
school-related operations, such as school canteens, align their financial year to 
the school year.
The end of the financial or fiscal year is an important date in the accounting and 
business calendar. Business-owners need to plan, prepare and deal with the end 
of the financial year, empowered with the trusted advice of their tax accountant.
The strategies covered in the following sections provide you with an opportunity 
to pull everything together and finalise the year.
Finding out where you’re at
In Chapter 10 I cover developing an annual budget and then reviewing your budget 
regularly and revising forecasts accordingly. In this section, I cover finalising your 
budget and forecast in the lead-up to the end of the financial year.
About two months prior to the end of the financial year, you should prepare a 
forecast of the full-year results and review your financial accounts. Using Xero’s 
Budget Manager function, you can easily create a suitable forecast for this 
purpose.
Here’s how:
1.	 From the dashboard, click Reports and go to the Budget Manager, click in 
the Select Budget field and select + Add New Budget.
2.	 Name this budget FORECAST 201X and click the green Save button.

CHAPTER 11  End of Financial Year Reporting      297
3.	 Select the Start date as two months before the end of the actual year.
If the financial year ends in June, the selected date would be May.
4.	 In the Actuals field select 12 months; in the Period field select 3 months.
In the Period field, ‘2’ would have been okay, but that’s not an option.
5.	 Click the blue Update button, and Export the data to excel.
You can now tinker with the spreadsheet  — add in an averaging formula, for 
example, for the last two months to create a 12-month forecast. You can then add 
an extra column at the end and tally the data for the 12-month period. Just make 
sure you don’t overstate the tally — only grab 12 months!
Refer to Chapter 10 for more information on Xero’s Budget Manager, and ask your 
accountant for assistance if required. Add-on solutions such as Spotlight Fore-
casting can also connect with Xero and assist with generating useful business 
forecasts.
Xero is a cloud-based solution, so trusted advisers who you’ve given Xero access 
to can jump in to your Xero file and collaborate with you on your budget 
development.
Being prepared early
Empowered with your actual results for the first ten months of the financial year 
and your forecasts for the last two months, make an appointment to speak with 
your tax accountant. In particular, discuss the following:
»
» Do your accounts have any issues that you need assistance with? Perhaps you 
have something like a pesky amortisation loan. Can your accountant sort out 
any issues prior to the end of the year?
»
» Do any tax-mitigating strategies need to be implemented during the current 
financial year?
Communicating with your accountant, be it via Skype, email exchanges or a face- 
to-face meeting, primes you for the approaching end of financial year.
A few other chores that can be done prior to the end of the financial year include:
»
» If you’ve not been working with your accountant on a regular basis, book an 
appointment around the end of the financial year with members of your Xero 
advisory team — especially if you think you’re going to need additional 
support at the end of the financial year.

298      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
»
» Review the Aged Receivables report (refer to Chapter 10). Identify customers 
who owe the business money and then urge them to make payment before 
the end of the financial year. (You may have to write off any long overdue 
debts — see the section ‘Processing a bad debt’ for more.)
»
» Start preparations for a stocktake on the final day of the year — if your 
business holds stock. (See Chapter 13 for more on managing inventory and 
Chapter 16 for inventory management add-on solutions.)
Reconciling tax payments for the year
If your business has made consumer tax payments during the year, you need to 
reconcile and review the full year’s submissions and payments and correct the 
final payment for the full year. Yikes! Why might you need to do this? If the period 
wasn’t locked down, transactions may have been accidently changed. Or incorrect 
figures could have been submitted to the tax authority. Errors do happen — take 
this as an opportunity to correct them. Refer to Chapter 10 for guidance on recon-
ciling consumer tax payments, and instead of reviewing a reporting period, review 
an entire year.
Your tax accountant is also likely to review and reconcile this account, and identify 
any adjustments required.
Processing a bad debt
Your business made a sale or you invoiced a customer for certain services and all 
efforts have been made to collect the outstanding debt, but you realise it’s futile — 
you’re more likely to see pigs fly than receive the payment. In this case, writing 
the invoice off as a bad debt is necessary to ensure your financial records correctly 
reflect the reality of the situation. Take a look at your bad debts quarterly and take 
a good look before the end of the financial year.
Here’s how to write off a bad debt:
1.	 Open the sales invoice that needs to be written off and make a note of 
the number and date.
Refer to Chapter 6 for more information on accessing sales invoices.
2.	 Apply a credit note to the invoice by clicking Invoice Options and select-
ing the Add Credit Note option from the drop-down list.
3.	 Enter the last date of the reporting period in the Date field.
4.	 Enter the original invoice’s number and date in the Reference field.

CHAPTER 11  End of Financial Year Reporting      299
5.	 Process the bad debt according to the accounting basis used.
How you process the debt depends on whether you use an accruals or cash 
basis, as follows:
•	 Accruals basis: If the business operates on an accruals basis, create an 
expense account called Bad Debt (refer to Chapter 2 for guidance on 
creating accounts). Make a note of the tax rate, change the account to the 
bad debts account and change the tax rate to the original tax rate amount.
•	 Cash basis: If the business operates on a cash basis, use the same account 
and tax coding from the original invoice. (This will have been autopopu-
lated for you — so, in fact, do nothing else.)
6.	 Apply the bad debt to the invoice by clicking the green Approve button.
The outcome of this within the accruals method is the invoice is closed off; the 
Profit and Loss/Income statement displays the income and the bad debt 
expense as separate lines that offset each other. The consumer tax nets itself 
off in the Balance Sheet, and the Consumer Tax report reflects the consumer 
as a sales and purchases line.
The outcome of this within the cash method is the invoice is closed off; no 
trace of the transaction comes up in your Profit and Loss statement displays. 
The consumer tax nets itself off in the Balance Sheet/Income Statement and 
the Consumer Tax report.
Preparing Accounts for  
Your Tax Accountant
During the year, hopefully you’ve taken advantage of the collaborative nature of 
Xero and liaised with your accountant to iron out and deal with any issues in your 
Xero file. However, when it comes to the end of the financial year, and as company 
taxes need to be prepared, you still need to review a few aspects of your Xero data 
file. This gives you a better understanding of your business and cuts down on the 
time your accountant takes (and charges) to prepare everything that’s required. In 
this section, I take you through some areas of Xero that may need to be reviewed 
or worked on before you ask your accountant to access Xero and undertake the end 
of financial year review.
Your tax accountant can help you with many of the chores discussed in this sec-
tion and, yes, your tax accountant’s fee is tax-deductible! But if you have the time 
and energy, you can do some of the basic housekeeping yourself. (If not, hire a 
good bookkeeper to do it for you, rather than leaving it all for the accountant. You 

300      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
can find a list of Xero-certified bookkeepers here: www.xero.com/advisors/
list/bookkeepers/.) You’re just throwing your money away if, for example, you 
ask your tax accountant to review your accounts while a balance is still showing in 
the suspense account, bank accounts are unreconciled, or accounts have been left 
forlorn and forgotten. The other danger is that, if you hand everything over to 
your accountant, he may end up making some assumptions or needing to ask you 
about issues he can’t sort out.
The following list outlines some of the areas that often pop up as issues when I do 
end of financial year reviews. Keep a record of your own issues that you need to 
alert your accountant about as you work through the points in the list.
Here are some actions you may need to perform before asking your accountant to 
finalise your accounts:
»
» Clear transactions allocated to any suspense or miscellaneous accounts so the 
balance is zero and your records are complete and accurate.
»
» Review the General Ledger Exceptions report for the full period. Look for 
account balances that seem out of the ordinary or unexpected. Check 
whether you can understand or explain the balance. Compare the balance to 
the previous period — are they comparable? If it’s reasonable to expect a 
deviation of, say, 10 per cent year on year, anything different should be 
reviewed.
Search for transactions across the whole of the ledger using the Find & 
Recode feature described in Chapter 8. This handy tool enables searches 
across multiple accounts using different criteria.
»
» Upload any important source documents — like car lease agreements — and 
attach them to the relevant transaction, so your tax accountant can easily 
review them and ensure they’ve been coded correctly (refer to Chapter 4 for 
more on file storage).
»
» From the home dashboard, go to the top active bank account and click 
Manage Account → Reconciliation Report to access the Bank Reconciliation 
Summary. Review the summary for all bank, credit card and online payment 
gateway accounts like PayPal, as at the end of the financial year. The Balance 
in Xero and the Statement Balance should equal. If they do, as in Figure 11-1, 
publish the reports as at the last day of the financial year. (Refer to Chapter 10 
for guidance on what to do if the balances don’t reconcile — that is, they’re 
not equal.)
»
» From the home dashboard, go to the top active bank account and click 
Manage Account → Reconciliation Report and click the Statement Exception 
tab. This report identifies transactions that may cause the reconciliation to be 
out of balance. The report highlights the source of the transaction — auto 

CHAPTER 11  End of Financial Year Reporting      301
(bank feed) or manual — and the reasons for the discrepancy, including 
duplicate or deleted entries. Review the exception statement for all bank, 
credit card and online payment gateway accounts like PayPal, as at the end of 
the financial year.
»
» Review the balances of the consumer tax account and payroll liability accounts 
(if relevant — refer to Chapter 10). Do they seem ‘reasonable’?
»
» Review the Aged Receivables report from the Reports dashboard. Do you 
need to write off any accounts as bad debts?
»
» Review the Aged Payables report from the Reports dashboard. Do you still 
owe money to creditors and need to deal with this?
»
» Review your fixed assets — from the home dashboard, go to Accounts → 
Fixed Assets. Have any assets been purchased or sold during the year? Are 
they reflected on the Fixed Assets dashboard? Make a note of anything you 
need to mention to the accountant. (See Chapter 14 for guidance on dealing 
with fixed assets.)
Ideally, your tax accountant, with Adviser status, is processing the business’s 
Fixed Asset Register within Xero. Doing so is simpler and fully utilises this 
feature in Xero. However, if you’ve still not brought your Fixed Asset Register 
details into Xero, take this opportunity to check if your accountant can give 
you a depreciation schedule so you can enter this schedule into Xero. (Also 
continue to encourage your accountant to work directly into Xero, rather than 
use an external solution — and to buy a copy of this book, too!)
»
» Review the Balance Sheet as at the date of the end of the year, as compared 
to the previous year (if you have those accounts). Do the balances seem 
reasonable? Do the suspense, miscellaneous or historical adjustment 
accounts have balances? Can you explain these balances? If questionable

302      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
balances exist, click and drill down to review them. (To access the report, click 
Reports → All Reports → Balance Sheet.)
»
» Review the Profit and Loss/Income Statement report for the full financial year, 
compared to the previous year (if you have those accounts). Do the balances 
seem reasonable? Do any suspense or miscellaneous accounts have bal-
ances? Can you explain these balances? (To access the report, click Reports → 
All Reports → Profit and Loss/Income Statement.)
»
» Review the ‘reasonableness’ of other reports that you use on a regular basis.
»
» If you track your inventory, undertake a physical stocktake and update the 
stock values. (See Chapter 13 for guidance on updating stock figures.)
»
» Review data from any partner solutions and identify and justify any differ-
ences. Check with the add-on solution if they have any guidance from their 
perspective regarding what you need to do with your accounts near the end 
of the financial year. If you’re using a bill scanning solution (for example 
Receipt Bank) that pushes supplier bills into Xero, you should check that 
nothing outstanding needs to be pushed across and dealt with. If you’re using 
a POS solution (like Kounta), check that sales are correctly recorded across 
both solutions. If you’re using an inventory solution (such as Unleashed), 
reconcile your balance sheet’s stock on hand to the solution’s stock on hand. If 
you’re using a job management solution (for example, WorkflowMax), ensure 
that all the work in progress (WIP) is accounted for.
»
» Perform a back-up of Xero data by exporting a detailed General Ledger report 
for the full financial year and save it to Microsoft Excel. Access the General 
Ledger report from the home dashboard — click Reports → All Reports → 
General Ledger. Select the correct date range and the Show YTD option so 
opening and closing balances and a running balance appear on the report. 
Then click the Update button, scroll to the bottom of the screen and click the 
white Export Detailed General Ledger to Excel button in the middle. (Just don’t 
get confused and click the blue Export button on the right.)
»
» Prepare your consumer tax report for the final period of the year (if relevant).
»
» Finalise and enter any payments that need to be made. After reviewing the 
consumer tax account, liaise with your tax accountant to clarify any payments 
that need to be made to taxation authorities. Likewise, after reviewing payroll 
liability accounts, you may need to make payments to the relevant authorities.
After you’ve run through the areas for review in the preceding list, let your 
accountant know you’re ready for him to work his wonders on your Xero data file.
Alert your accountant to any issues you’ve not talked to him about during the year 
that he should be made aware of, like the purchase of a new fixed asset or signifi-
cant changes to operations. Ask him for feedback on your record keeping — can 
you make any improvements or do anything differently?

CHAPTER 11  End of Financial Year Reporting      303
Helping with Tax Accountant Tasks
When I initially review a customer’s data, I check to see if the end of the financial 
year has been finalised in the records by the tax accountant. Customers may have 
paid a tax accountant a lot of money to prepare financial accounts; however, fre-
quently the job is unfinished. Telltale signs include no depreciation accounts, no 
manual journal entries on the last day of the end of the financial period, and no 
lock-down dates set on the accounts.
What happened? It’s likely the tax accountant extracted data from the business 
owner’s system, reviewed it, made various assumptions, applied various tax laws, 
prepared the end of financial year reports and gave them back to the business 
owner in a folder or on a USB stick many months after the end of the financial 
THE BENEFITS OF SOME EXTRA  
XERO HOUSEKEEPING
I always like to practise what I preach. Even though I review my accounts regularly, here 
are some extra things I noticed when performing my own end-of-year housekeeping 
(covered in the section ‘Preparing Accounts for Your Tax Accountant’):
•	 I had 10 cents sitting in a liability account, so I (with my Adviser status) prepared a 
manual journal (see the section ‘Entering manual journals’, later in this chapter, for 
guidance on using manual journals) to transfer the balance to a petty cash account. 
An extra 10 cents in my petty cash account isn’t a major concern and it clears a 
bothersome liability account.
•	 I also had a balance in the Overpayments account. I clicked on the amount and 
drilled down to see details of the account for the full year. I realised I needed to 
refund the overpayment and repaid my customer to clear the balance. (Refer to 
Chapter 8 for more on this.) The payment happened after the end of period date, 
but at least I knew it was sorted out.
•	 My electricity account seemed lower than previous years. I reviewed the bills and 
realised I’d missed entering a quarter that I had not paid using my business bank 
accounts. I located the bill and added it to Xero. I then set the bill up as a repeating 
draft bill so I’d never miss it again! (Refer to Chapter 7 for information on setting up 
repeating bills.)
•	 I had a balance in my reimbursable expenses clearing account. I realised I hadn’t 
properly allocated a parking expense to the account, so I edited the invoice and 
changed the account allocation.

304      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
year. If I’m lucky, the business owner has spent a couple of hours entering the end 
of year adjustments directly into the accounting system.
Alas, many don’t understand or have the time to do this step and, year on year, 
layers of incompleteness build into their business records. (And the tax accoun-
tant probably charges a little bit more every year, because the poor business 
­owner’s accounts aren’t up to date — and the cycle goes on!)
With Xero, you can make this process run a lot more smoothly. This is because 
your accountant can work with you through the year, directly within Xero, using 
Xero’s single ledger accounting system. (So no more USB sticks months down 
the track.)
In the following sections, I cover the advantages of enabling your accountant to 
access your Xero data directly in more detail. If your accountant still prefers to 
finalise your accounts in another program, I also cover exporting Xero data for 
your accountant to import into another specialised tax software program. Plus, 
I cover the whole process of finalising your end of financial year accounts, from 
entering manual journals to working with a locked account.
Enabling your tax accountant  
to work directly in Xero
Xero introduces the concept of a single ledger accounting system. This is a system 
where both your accountant and you (as the business owner) can access and work 
on the same data. Your tax accountant finalises the end of year accounts directly 
into your business’s Xero file. No time is wasted extracting or re-entering data, 
and no danger exists of the accountant working on the wrong data file, or the file 
getting lost on a USB stick.
Xero’s single ledger accounting system means, as a business owner, you’re better 
positioned to reflect on what adjustments have been made. (Shhhh! By this I really 
mean question the assumptions made by your tax accountant.) I’m one of those 
obsessive-compulsive people who questions and analyses everything. I want to 
understand, for example, why two cars are being depreciated differently, or why a 
certain business expense has been omitted from the records. Sometimes I pick up 
areas where an accountant has made the wrong assumption. But also, knowing 
the answers to these types of questions helps you run your business better — if 
the business can’t legitimately claim an expense, you need to know that for future 
years, so you don’t mistakenly overspend. (Yes, I am talking about entertainment 
expenses!)

CHAPTER 11  End of Financial Year Reporting      305
Your tax accountant accesses Xero in the cloud. He can be at your office, his office 
or halfway around the world — it’s all in the cloud, so your accountant could be 
anywhere! He enters the end of financial year adjustments directly into source 
documents, and general journals directly into Xero’s single ledger via a manual 
journal and, therefore, the business owner’s financial reports become the pre-
pared financial reports.
Exporting general ledger transactions
Typically, your tax accountant prepares the business’s tax reports in specialised 
software — either Xero Practice Manager or other software used by accounting 
practices. The Xero data may need to be exported and then imported into this 
software so he can prepare the tax requirements for your business and generate 
reports to be submitted to the relevant tax authority.
In New Zealand and Australia, if your tax accountant is a Xero partner, they can 
perform tax processing on their side of the Xero platform via the Practice 
Manager.
My accountant, who’s not a Xero partner, exports the data from Xero and imports 
the data into Handiledger. This system then autofills the Australian Taxation 
Office forms. Your accountant is likely to use their own Handiledger-style system, 
which autofills the relevant taxation forms for your country.
Extracting data from Xero is quite simple — although you can only do so if you 
have Adviser status within Xero. To extract data, follow these steps:
1.	 From the home dashboard, click Adviser → Export.
The Export Transactions window opens.
2.	 Select the appropriate software file format for exporting.
3.	 Select the date range for the full year in the From and To fields.
4.	 Export the general ledger transactions by clicking the blue Download 
link.
The file saves to the file downloads directory.
After you’ve exported your data, your accountant can log into his own accounting 
system and import the downloaded Xero general ledger transactions.

306      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
Entering manual journals
I adored my accounting teacher. She neatly filled the blackboard with journal 
entries and trial balances. These days, you could spend your entire career working 
on accounting software and never see a general journal entry. They are there, 
happening behind the scenes, allocating debits and credits to the relevant ledgers, 
but you don’t see them as such. However, on a few rare occasions, an entry is 
made that looks like a good old-fashioned general journal entry  — a manual 
­journal. A manual journal could be entered to
»
» Finalise the end of financial year requirements
»
» Add Tracking to conversion balances (see Chapter 12)
»
» Distribute profits or allocate dividends
»
» Sort out minor rounding issues
Users with Standard user status and above can enter their own manual journal in 
Xero by following these steps:
1.	 Access the Manual Journal dashboard by clicking Reports → All Reports → 
Journal Report and clicking the Manual Journals button. Create a new 
journal by clicking the New Journal button.
A general journal template opens (see Figure 11-2).
2.	 Clearly describe the purpose of the journal in the Narration field.
Use something like ‘EOFY G/J financial year prepared by [accountant’s name]’. 
So, as shown in Figure 11-2, my narration would say EOFY 20XX/XX prepared by 
Dickensons.

CHAPTER 11  End of Financial Year Reporting      307
3.	Check the Default Narration to Journal Line Description box to allow the 
description to autofill all transaction fields.
Override fields as required.
4.	Record the date of the manual journal in the Date field.
This date should be the last day of the financial year.
5.	Define the accounting basis the journal is to use.
Check the Show Journal on Cash Basis Reports box if you want the journal to 
reflect a cash and accrual basis; leave the box blank if you want the journal on 
an accrual basis only.
6.	Specify whether the values entered in the journal are Tax Exclusive or 
Tax Inclusive by selecting the drop-down option from the Amounts Are 
field.
If the transaction doesn’t have tax on it, don’t select the No Tax option in the 
Amounts Are field, which intuitively seems to be the correct choice. If you do, 
you won’t have the option to select the correct tax rate or the ability to exclude 
the transaction from the consumer tax reports.
Lines of the journal entry are detailed in the block beneath the Amounts Are 
field. Each line should include a Description, Account and Tax Rate (tracking 
categories are optional — see Chapter 12). The line values must be allocated to 
either the debit or credit column.
At this stage, you can attach supporting documentation to the journal; for 
example if you’ve calculated a complex depreciation outside of Xero, you may 
want to attach the excel spreadsheet calculations and a PDF of the summary 
depreciation schedule.
7.	Add extra lines to the journal entry by clicking the Add a New Line 
button.
8.	Delete lines of the journal entry by overriding the entry or clicking on the 
cross to the right of the entry.
9.	Leave the Auto Reversing Date field blank.
The entry will not be reversed. (The automatic option to reverse journal entries 
is useful for businesses running on an accruals basis that need to create a 
journal on the last day of the month, and then reverse it on the first day of the 
next month.)
10.	Click the blue Save as Draft button.
You can save an out of balance journal (that is, one where the debit and credit 
columns don’t equal) as a draft. Sometimes journal entries are arduously 
long — you may need to take a water cooler break before you have them all 
fully entered.

308      PART 3  Making the Routine, Routine
You can click the Save as Draft button at any time. If you’re entering a long 
­journal, clicking this button regularly is a good idea to avoid timing out and 
losing work.
11.	Edit the journal entry (if required).
Access the journal entry from the home dashboard — click Adviser → Manual 
Journals → All, and click on the relevant journal. At the top right of the journal, 
click on the Journal Options button and access options to repeat, reverse, void, 
copy or edit the journal (if those actions are required).
12.	Post the journal entry to the ledger by clicking the green Post button.
A manual journal can’t post to an Accounts Payable or Accounts Receivable 
account. In fact, the only time you can post directly to either of these accounts is 
when you’re processing an overpayment (refer to Chapter 8) or entering a conver-
sion balance (refer to Chapter 2).
Special Considerations
The following sections cover some extra areas you may need to look at before your 
accounts are completely finalised, depending on how your accountant works — 
end-of-year reports and account lock dates.
Publishing end-of-year reports
After your tax accountant has posted any adjustments and finalised the accounts 
(but before you start whooping with joy), he should publish the Profit and Loss/
Income Statement and Balance Sheet reports for the financial year through Xero, 
and triple-check that they agree with the business’s financial reports submitted 
to your tax authority.
If your accountant doesn’t do these things, you can publish the reports yourself 
and check the figures — refer to Chapter 9 for guidance on publishing reports. 
Note: Only someone with Adviser or Standard with All Reports Access status can 
publish these reports.
Locking down accounts
Lock dates prevent users from altering any accounts prior to and inclusive of the 
set date. Once the End of Year Lock Date has been set, if you (or anyone else) try 
to enter transactions in the period prior to the lock date, you’re notified the 
accounts are locked, and the transactions must occur after the given date.

CHAPTER 11  End of Financial Year Reporting      309
Here’s how you lock down the accounts after submitting your business’s tax 
reports (if you have Adviser status in Xero): Click Settings → General Settings → 
Financial Settings and then, from the Stop All Users Making Changes On and 
Before drop-down menu, select the date and select Save.
The date selected for this field is typically the last day of the financial year. Usu-
ally, the lock date is set when your tax accountant has finalised and submitted the 
accounts for the end of financial year submission.
When the lock date has been set, you can edit it if you have Adviser status in Xero. 
So, you can change it, make any necessary changes, and set it again. However, 
only do so if absolutely necessary. In most cases, avoid making any changes, 
especially after reports have been filed, because these changes can then lead to 
inconsistencies in your figures.
If your tax accountant doesn’t lock down the end of year period after the end of 
the financial year, make sure you do (or someone else on your Xero advisory team 
with the required permission does).
HANDLING YOUR XERO FILE WHEN  
YOU SELL YOUR BUSINESS
If you sell your business, you may be wondering what you do with your Xero file. Don’t 
give the file to the new owner of the business! You can extract records from the file for 
them, such as a Chart of Accounts, the customer list and some reports, but the file 
should remain with you.
If you’re no longer running the business, you have two options regarding your Xero file:
•	 Finalise your accounts and the sale of the business with your accountant, download 
all necessary information from your Xero file, and then end your Xero subscription. 
The Xero data file is converted to read-only and stored on Xero servers. If you need 
to access the files again, you can pay Xero an activation fee to reactivate the file.
•	 Keep the file going indefinitely by continuing to pay your Xero subscription. (You 
could save money and downgrade to the Starter package.) If you start or buy a new 
business, however, you’ll still need to create a new ledger (and Xero file) for this 
new business.

Monitoring Your 
Business
I
n the mid-1990s, my husband and I ventured on a road trip from Toronto, 
Ontario, to Boston, Massachusetts. With a car, a credit card, a rough idea of how 
we would get there and a two-week time frame, we set off on our journey. 
The trip was pretty uneventful for the first few hours (you have to either travel 
on the main road or go swimming in the freezing cold Lake Ontario!). After cross-
ing the border into the United States, we had time to explore and to deviate from 
our route when the fancy took us; so, we changed course and spent a few days in 
Montpelier, Vermont (foodies’ heaven!). Getting back on track, we made it to the 
beautiful city of Boston (and, disappointingly, found the worst bed and breakfast 
I have ever stayed in).
A business can be like a road trip — you may start with a particular destination in 
mind, but then change course and achieve something that you would never have 
contemplated at the start of the journey. And sometimes that’s okay. However, 
when you can clearly define the destination for your business, you’re likely to find 
navigating a course, and focusing all energies on reaching it, much easier.
In this chapter, I provide help on establishing a road map for your business and 
recognising metrics that can help keep the journey on track, using Xero’s tracking 
Chapter 12

314      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
and reporting functions. You can leverage information generated from Xero’s 
transparent and accessible dashboards to support all business decisions. Monitor 
your business’s journey, and readjust and refine as necessary.
Identifying Key Metrics
Business strategy enables you to understand what needs to be done to achieve 
your business goals and get the business where it needs to be. In the simplest of 
terms, outlining a business strategy means you’ve defined a vision for your busi-
ness, recognised the current business position, and undertaken a gap analysis 
between where the business is now and where you want the business to be.
Identifying the direction the business needs to move in then assists in defining 
goals and formulating tasks that you (and other staff members) can work towards 
to achieve the business vision. All activities undertaken by you or your business’s 
staff should align to the strategic plan to ensure that the focus and direction of the 
business is maintained.
If you employ staff and you’re trying to make sure their activities align with the 
overall goals and strategies of your business, find ways that engage and motivate 
them, and recognise their achievements (refer to the nearby sidebar ‘Focusing 
yourself and your team on specific targets’ for more).
With this in mind, you can develop key performance indicators (KPIs) to help keep 
the business on track. KPIs are a quantifiable measurement that can be set as a 
target to assist the business with achieving goals. They don’t necessarily need to 
be a dollar value — they could be average debtor or average creditor days, or num-
ber of invoices issued per month. My husband used to manage airline safety, and 
the numero uno performance measurement for his job was whether take-offs 
equalled landings!
Using Xero to set realistic  
targets and strategies
Xero can assist you in achieving your business strategy. Here’s how: You define an 
inspiring strategy, break it down into goals and then use the rich transparent data 
available in Xero to set targets that align to those goals. Through regularly review-
ing the data, you can refine your operations and fine-tune your business’s KPIs to 
achieve desired outcomes.

CHAPTER 12  Monitoring Your Business      315
It’s not the largest of businesses that survive, or the most innovative, or those 
that spend the most on marketing. The businesses that survive are the ones most 
responsive to change. You need to adapt and refine your strategy to the ever-
changing environment in which you operate.
Setting KPIs and rewarding success
When looking to set and track KPIs, keep it simple: Identify KPIs, focus staff on 
targets, and reward success.
To identify KPIs for your business, have a think about what KPIs are most likely to 
assist you in achieving the main goals of your business. What KPIs are likely to 
FOCUSING YOURSELF AND YOUR  
TEAM ON SPECIFIC TARGETS
To start thinking about ways you can move your business in the direction of achieving 
your goals and overall strategy, have a look at this example. A training organisation 
offers study packages that, when taken up, attract government funding. The funding is 
paid in instalments — at sign-up, midway through the 14 training units, and at sign-off 
completion. Students would frequently complete all aspects of training and assessment; 
however, they could only be signed off once staff had completed all administration 
requirements.
The manager of the training organisation realised his cash flow was directly linked to 
signed-off training units. So, he found ways to motivate lecturers to move their students 
through training units. He continually stressed the importance of training unit sign-off 
targets with staff. He publicly praised and rewarded lecturers who achieved high train-
ing unit sign-offs. By dangling this carrot, he cultivated a motivated team focused on 
achieving a single target: Signed-off completed training units.
To identify this simple KPI, the manager reviewed the Sales By Items report in Xero 
(found on the Reports dashboard), and customised it for the relevant period. The 
Quantity Sold column reflected completed units for the period.
Not once did he mention cash flow, or profit and loss, or bank balances to the staff. 
Instead, he dissected the organisation processes and identified key targets that directly 
affected cash flow. He extracted an easily digestible concept and kept the lecturers 
focused on that simple target. Of course, he was concerned about the business’s cash 
flow, profit and bank balances, but he was aware staff eyes would likely glaze over if 
they were provided with too much information or too many targets.

316      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
assist you in the decision-making process and keep you aligned with the business 
vision? Your KPIs could relate to sales, cash on hand and return on investment, for 
example.
KPIs that align to your business vision, and ways you can use Xero to track these, 
could include the following:
»
» Achieving a monthly cash surplus of $10,000 for six consecutive months to 
fund extension plans. To review this KPI in Xero, from the dashboard go to 
Reports → All Reports → Cash Summary. Set the criteria to compare six 
months by selecting the previous month in the Date field. In the Period field 
select 1 Month, in the Compare With field select Previous 5 Periods and click 
the blue Update button to view the customised data. Scroll to the bottom of 
the report to see the Net Cash Movement for each month. This is the monthly 
cash surplus KPI. If the cash surplus is not meeting the desired goals, you 
need to increase cash coming into the business and decrease cash flowing out 
of the business. (See the sidebar ‘The power of positive cash flow’, later in this 
chapter, for more.)
»
» Maintaining a return on investment percentage between 20 and 25 per cent to 
meet investor requirements. To review this KPI in Xero, from the dashboard go 
to Reports → All Reports → Executive Summary. Set the criteria for the report 
by selecting the previous month in the Date field, and in the Show field select 
Summary and Ratios. Click the blue Update button to view the customised 
data. Scroll down the report to the line headed Return on Investment (p.a.).
»
» A Debt ratio of under 25 per cent indicates the business is minimising its 
exposure to loans and other financial obligations. To keep an eye on the Debt 
ratio’s movement, click on Reports and search for the Business Performance 
report. Open it up, and the Debt ratio is listed in the second block.
The Return on Investment ratio (or ROI for short) is my all-time favourite ratio. 
I use it to analyse all business spending. You have to spend money to make 
money but, whenever you spend, you should ask yourself what income is 
generated as a result of the investment. A desirable return on investment 
should be higher than current bank deposit interest rates. If they’re lower 
than these rates, you need to justify why — and question whether you’d be 
better off selling the business and depositing all the money in a bank. For 
example, at the time of writing, bank deposit rates in England are hovering 
around 1.7 per cent. If a car yard has £8 million invested in business assets, it 
needs to generate income of at least 1.7 per cent of the value of these assets 
to achieve a return on investment that outperforms bank deposit rates. 
Running a business involves high levels of risk and time commitment — so, 

CHAPTER 12  Monitoring Your Business      317
ideally, the business owner would want the Return on Investment ratio to be 
significantly higher than the bank deposit rates.
Note: I selected the previous month in both scenarios because data for the 
current month is likely to be incomplete and reflect a distorted reality.
See the section ‘Delving deeper into the Executive Summary report’, later in this 
chapter, for more on tracking performance margins and variances.
The KPIs for your business need to reflect where your business is in the business 
cycle. (A business cycle refers to the general economic fluctuations of the business, 
reflected in the business moving between stages of expanding and contracting, 
with constant fluctuation between the two.) A start-up business is focused on 
expansion — for example, spending as much money as it can on promotion while 
trying to build up sales. (Facebook, now a billion-dollar enterprise, ran at a loss 
for five years!) A contracting business may have steady sales, with minimal money 
spent on promotion or seeking out new business activities. The KPIs you select 
should reflect where your business is in the business cycle.
Reviewing your business strategy
Gazing into my mystical crystal ball, I could ponder the optimal moment to review 
a business’s strategy, goals and KPIs — but, alas, I dropped it and it broke.
Developing a business strategy is like setting a car’s GPS. Just like you need to 
check that your GPS is sending you in the direction you need to go, reviewing goals 
and KPIs when implementing strategic change is essential. Adjusting your busi-
ness’s goals and KPIs helps you align the business and ensure it reaches its new 
destination.
Use the reports and customisation available in Xero discussed throughout this 
chapter to review your goals and KPIs, and do so on at least a quarterly basis.
The business landscape is constantly changing, and new business models are 
always emerging. Those who adopt rapid changes in innovation and technology 
leave other businesses in their wake.
Generating Useful Information
For information to be useful, it must be complete and accurate. Incomplete data is 
unreliable and can lead to unsupported decisions. (Review Chapters 10 and 11 for 
guidance on undertaking the required tasks to ensure your data is complete and 
accurate, and your financial records are complete.)

318      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
Within Xero, you have access to a plethora of reports, and if you feel comfortable 
swimming in the numbers and data, jump in and enjoy them. If, however, you’re 
not sure where to start, read on. Don’t be that person who erects blinkers and 
ignores their business reports!
If you’re feeling reluctant about diving into Xero’s sea of data, set yourself a daily 
15-minute challenge. Allocate 15 minutes each day to work through an area, and 
continue in 15-minute blocks until you grasp the concepts. This is how I find time 
to learn something new — and it may take a few days of 15-minute challenges 
before I fully understand something. Sleep can also be immensely beneficial in the 
learning process. If I’m trying to learn something, I often find that the next morn-
ing a few of the pieces of the puzzle have fallen into place.
Make a cup of tea, settle yourself down and spend 15 minutes every day reviewing, 
understanding and identifying how you can use Xero’s reports in your business!
Taking advantage of management reports
For a brief moment I lived in Wolverhampton in the United Kingdom. In the job I 
was working at, I was responsible for preparing MMRs — the monthly manage-
ment reports. Every month, I produced a bound book of monthly reports that I 
would distribute to managers — whether they liked it or not — a few weeks after 
the end of the month. By the time I could distribute the reports, the next month 
was almost over and, overwhelmed by so much information, I swear some man-
agers used the books to prop up their computers.
How times have changed — using a cloud-based real-time system, management 
reports can be accessed when the manager wants to see and review them. Note: Data 
needs to be completed for the period you’re reviewing for the reports to be accurate.
Users with Adviser status in Xero can access a predefined six-page Management 
Report. This report is a neat compact set of management reports that highlights 
all the general areas a business should be aware of. The reports contained within 
the Management Report are the following:
»
» Executive Summary
»
» Cash Summary
»
» Profit and Loss
»
» Balance Sheet
»
» Aged Receivables
»
» Aged Payables

CHAPTER 12  Monitoring Your Business      319
Figure 12-1 shows the first page of Xero’s six-page Management Report — the 
Executive Summary.
Here’s how to access the Management Report if you have Adviser status: From the 
dashboard, click Adviser → Management Reports. From here, you have access to 
Xero’s predefined selection of six reports. Click on the field beside Page 1 of 6 to 
select the individual reports.
If you have Standard user access in Xero, you can still access the individual reports 
on the Management Report from the Reports dashboard. Simply click Reports → 
All Reports and locate the required report.

Delving deeper into the Executive  
Summary report
Access the Executive Summary report in Xero via the Management Report. From 
the home dashboard, click Adviser → Management Report. It opens at Page 1 of 
6, which is the Executive Summary report. In the Date field enter the previous 
month, in the Show field enter Summary and Ratios, and click the blue Update 
button to update the report. The far right column displays a current month 
­versus prior month variance analysis, or the percentage change between the 
two months.
THE POWER OF POSITIVE CASH FLOW
A positive cash flow is necessary for business survival — profitable businesses can go 
bankrupt due to a lack of positive cash flow. If you have concerns about your cash indi-
cators after looking at your Executive Summary report in Xero, take a look at how you 
can improve cash flow. For example, you could:
•	 Identify and escalate collection disputes more quickly. To identify overdue 
invoices, from the home dashboard view the Money Coming In dashboard and click 
on overdue invoices to drill down to further detail on the invoice and customer con-
tact information.
•	 Review customer credit terms. To edit all customer credit terms, from the home 
dashboard go to Settings → General Settings → Invoice Settings and click the 
Options button on the Standard themed invoices and then edit. In the Terms and 
Payment Advice block, update customer credit terms by minimising the number of 
days they have to pay — for example, to Net 7 days — and save the branding 
theme. The updated information is on all future invoices using this theme. Do this 
for all invoices used. Click the Default Settings button to set a default due date for 
all sales invoices.
•	 Review cash collection procedures. Review a typical invoice print-out the cus-
tomer receives and assess if payment details are clearly stated. To view an invoice, 
from the home dashboard click Accounts → Sales → Paid, double click on a typical 
invoice to open it, and select the Print PDF button and then the green Print Now 
button. The invoice PDF downloads to your computer; click on the file to open and 
view it. If you decide the invoice could be improved, you need to update your 
invoice branding.
•	 Review supplier payment terms. Ensure the supplier’s bill default due date is cor-
rectly entered in the contact details, and withhold paying supplier bills until close to 
their due date. To view the supplier’s bill default due date, from the dashboard click 

CHAPTER 12  Monitoring Your Business      321
The colours Xero uses for current month versus previous month variances give 
you a high-level understanding of the businesses performance: Green is good (for 
example, current income is above previous income), red indicates this area needs 
some attention (because, for example, current expense is higher than last month), 
and blue indicates no information is available, the variance is nonsense, or no 
change has occurred.
In the following sections, I look at the individual blocks from Xero’s one-page 
Executive Summary report in detail and identify how you can extract useful infor-
mation that can assist with business decision-making. Note: The following sec-
tions only cover blocks of the Executive Summary. To see some of these elements 
in more detail, and customise them to your needs, see the section ‘Customising 
the Management Report’, later in this chapter.
Cash
The first block of the Executive Summary report highlights business cash vari-
ances and the cash flow being generated by the business. If the cash spent (flow-
ing outwards) is greater than cash received (flowing inwards), you have a negative 
cash flow. When looking at this area, also check the closing bank balance shown, 
sourced from bank, credit card and online payment style accounts. If the bank 
balance is low, do you have access to funds in case of unexpected needs? Should 
you arrange a line of credit that can be drawn on in emergencies? In most cases, 
having a positive cash flow and bank balances to cover several months’ expenses 
is desirable (refer to the sidebar ‘The power of positive cash flow’ for more).
Profitability
The second block of the Executive Summary report highlights significant figures 
from your business’s Profit and Loss Statement.
The usefulness of the information that appears on your Profit and Loss Statement 
in Xero, and so on the Profitability area of the Executive Summary, depends on 
how accurately you’ve applied account types to the Chart of Accounts in Xero. (For 
more information, refer to Chapter 2, where I explain the different account types 
and how to apply them.)
Contacts → Suppliers, and click on a supplier. Select the Edit button and scroll to 
the bottom of the information. At the Invoice Setting block, check the Bills Default 
Due Date field and, if required, customise it to the supplier terms.
Refer to Chapter 6 for information on invoicing and using the Money Coming In dash-
board, and to Chapter 7 for more on paying suppliers.

322      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
If your Gross Profit line on the Executive Summary report shows a loss, this means 
you’re actually losing money with every transaction — the more business you do, 
the more money you lose. You need to drill down into the data and identify what 
is causing the loss and take a course of action to avoid further loss (see the nearby 
sidebar ‘Addressing a negative gross profit’ for more).
Balance Sheet
The third block of the Executive Summary report summarises the significant 
­figures from your business’s Balance Sheet. The Debtor figure in this block reflects 
who owes the business money and gives you an indication of how much money 
the business may receive in the future. Keep in mind that this figure may incor-
porate potential bad debts. So, when looking at this area of the report, ask yourself 
whether all this money is guaranteed.
If you’re entering bills into Xero prior to their due date, the Creditors figure in this 
block reflects who you owe money to. Does the business have the cash to make 
these payments?
Finally, the Net Assets line within this block is essentially the net worth of the 
company.
Income
The fourth block of the Executive Summary report highlights business income 
variances. Two performance indicators are available here: Number of Invoices 
Issued and Average Value of Invoices. What you want to see here is dependent on 
your business’s operations. Are you looking for yield or volume?
Xero is designed for hundreds of invoices and bills each month, which doesn’t suit 
some business models. If, in order to recognise bulk invoices, a summary invoice 
is entered in Xero, the metrics mentioned in the Income block of the Executive 
Summary report may not be representative of your reality.
If a stable business selling a stable product wants to improve its profit, it needs to 
increase either yield or volume, or both. Think about how this relates to the busi-
ness you operate. For example, a hairdresser who sells her time by the hour can 
only sell a finite number of hours. She has little scope to increase her volume. To 
increase her profitability, she needs to increase her hourly rate; her yield. To 
increase her yield even further, perhaps she can upsell exclusive salon-quality 
hair and beauty products. Without changing the number of invoices issued, by 
increasing her hourly rate and selling products she can increase the average value 
of each invoice.

CHAPTER 12  Monitoring Your Business      323
ADDRESSING A NEGATIVE GROSS PROFIT
A cut-and-dried response to a negative gross profit isn’t possible. Some business’s pric-
ing strategies incorporate a loss leader — for example, food stores may sell essentials 
like milk or bread at ridiculously low prices to attract customers into their store, where 
they can entice them with other profitable merchandise. (How often have you popped 
into the shops for milk, and left with a trolley full of groceries?!) However, your business 
needs some lines to be profitable for this strategy to work, so a gross loss at the high 
level shown on Xero’s Executive Summary report (Figure 12-1) is cause for concern.
Of course, another aspect of profitability is recognising that everything spent in the busi-
ness comes off the bottom line.
Strategies to implement if you have concerns about your profitability include
•	 Increasing your selling prices
•	 Increasing the number of clients
•	 Increasing the dollar value of sales to existing clients
•	 Increasing the number of times existing clients return
•	 Increasing income streams or selling additional services
•	 Minimising expenditure by comparison shopping, negotiating purchases and plan-
ning for expenditure
•	 Reviewing expenses
•	 Reviewing security around cash-handling procedures
By the way, don’t discount the effectiveness of the last point on this list. A franchised 
café chain I know of implemented some impressive cash-handling procedures. Staff 
have to undergo rigorous training in appropriate cash handling, and video surveillance 
monitors any areas in the café where a staff member could touch cash. If the cash 
drawer is open for longer than a minute, head office is alerted and the café manager is 
called. If expected benchmarks aren’t achieved, a team from head office is sent to the 
store to observe the store, review procedures and re-train staff. The chain has 275 
stores, so even if only, say, $5 was misappropriated from each of the stores, every day, 
the business would lose over half a million dollars over the year. Minor theft can easily 
affect cash flow and change the course of the business!

324      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
Performance
The fifth block of the Executive Summary report is a high-level indicator of per-
formance margins and variances, as follows:
»
» Gross Profit Margin: This is calculated by dividing Gross Profit by Income 
figures sourced from the Profit and Loss Statement. This margin indicates 
how efficiently direct costs are being used by the business. A high gross 
margin provides a buffer for operating costs. A low gross margin indicates you 
need to review all aspects of the business involving income received and 
direct costs.
»
» Net Profit Margin: This is calculated by dividing Net Profit by Income figures 
sourced from the Profit and Loss Statement. It reflects the monetary value of 
sales income left after all expenses have been paid. Fingers crossed this figure 
is positive. A high net profit indicates sales income is high in relation to 
expenses. Maybe you’re first to market and exploiting a competitive advan-
tage? Watch this figure — over time, business expenses tend to blow out and 
this figure can slip unnecessarily.
»
» Return on Investment (p.a.): This represents Profit/Loss divided by Net 
Assets multiplied by 12, sourced from Profitability and Balance Sheet figures.
The figures in the Performance block of Xero’s Executive Summary report are 
relative indicators of your business’s performance and, ideally, you want to see 
improvement.
Position
The final block of the Executive Summary report highlights business position 
variances, as follows:
»
» Average Debtor Days: This is calculated by dividing Debtors by Income 
multiplied by the days in the month, with data sourced from the Profit and 
Loss Statement and the Balance Sheet. The figure reflects the average 
number of days the business takes to collect payment from customers. The 
ideal figure here is zero! Essentially, however, the lower the better — if the 
figures are high, you could face the risk of bad debts in the account.
Keep your accounts in Xero up to date so your management reports are 
accurate and useful. I had a client who invoiced for a significant amount of 
work that they had performed unauthorised. No problem with the work, but 
without a purchase order in place, the customer refused to pay my client, and 
the invoice needed to be written off as a bad debt — otherwise, the informa-
tion on the management report would always be distorted.

CHAPTER 12  Monitoring Your Business      325
»
» Average Creditor Days: This is calculated by dividing Creditors by Purchases 
multiplied by the days in the month, with the data sourced from the Profit and 
Loss Statement and the Balance Sheet. If bills are entered prior to payment, 
this figure reflects the average time the business takes to pay suppliers. If 
your number here is low, maybe the opportunity exists to delay payments a 
little and improve cash flow? If your figure is high, do you have cash flow 
issues? Do you need to sort out a line of credit? Are you treating your suppli-
ers with respect?
»
» Short Term Cash Forecast: This shows Debtors less Creditors, sourced from 
the Balance Sheet, and provides a quick snapshot of your business’s cash 
flow. A positive result here is desirable. A negative result highlights concerns 
about paying suppliers — and, if you’re unable to pay suppliers, you may run 
out of stock to sell.
»
» Current Assets to Liabilities: This is calculated by dividing Current Assets 
by Current Liabilities using data sourced from the Balance Sheet. Commonly 
referred to as the current ratio, this figure indicates the liquidity of the 
­business — that is, how quickly money can be accessed in the business. 
A high positive result (a figure above 1) is desirable.
Assessing your performance
Xero’s performance reports show how the business is positioned based on assets, 
liabilities and equities. One of the performance reports is included in the six-page 
Management Report: The Profit and Loss Statement, which reflects the profit for 
a period in time (the classifications on the Profit and Loss Statement are outlined 
in Chapter  2). The report can be generated over more than one financial year, 
which is useful for project tracking.
The Profit and Loss Statement can highlight that you are spending too much 
money in a particular area. It can also highlight areas where opportunities exist to 
leverage overperforming income streams.
Evaluating your position
As with Xero’s performance reports (refer to preceding section), its position 
reports show how the business is positioned based on assets, liabilities and 
­equities. Three of the position reports are also included in the six-page Manage-
ment Report: Balance Sheet, Aged Receivables and Aged Payables.
A Balance Sheet is a statement at a point in time of the business’s assets, liabilities 
and equity. (The classifications on the Balance Sheet are outlined in Chapter 2.) 
For more on the Aged Receivables and Aged Payables reports, refer to Chapter 10.

Unpicking the details
Xero’s detail reports show the detail of the transactions in the accounts. If you 
need to further examine why something has happened, you can turn to the detail 
reports.
Customising the Management Report
The management reports covered in the preceding sections highlight the main 
reports you should be looking at on a regular basis. In this section, I cover cus-
tomising particular sections of the six-page Management Report to show the 
most useful information.
Only users with Adviser status can access Xero’s Management Report. To access 
this report if you have this status, go to the home dashboard and click Adviser → 
Management Report. The report opens at page one, the Executive Summary.
Here’s how you can customise the Executive Summary:
»
» In the Date field, select the relevant month from the drop-down options
»
» In the Show field, select Summary and Ratios from the drop-down options
UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOUR 
ACCOUNTANT CAN DO FOR YOU
Partners of Xero users (that is, accountants working with their clients in Xero) have 
access to the Report Packs feature, which enables the roll-out of a customised set of 
reports across all clients. This is done through applying report codes across the charts 
of accounts for individual businesses. The charts of accounts for each business are then 
linked through to defined report pack templates and the findings can be passed on to 
clients.
This means your Xero partner could provide valuable information that’s specific to, and 
gathered from, businesses in your field or with your scope. For example, a Xero partner 
could create a Customised Report Pack for all sole trader clients, extrapolate insightful 
comparative information, and efficiently help all the businesses it works with using the 
same report pack.
At the time of writing, Xero has plans to roll access to Report Packs out to partners in 
the UK and the US, so contact your Xero partner for further information.

IT’S ALL ABOUT THE NUMBERS!
With your accounting solution producing timely accurate and accessible data, exploring 
the add-ons available in the Xero ecosystem to see what other analysis options are 
available is worthwhile. For example, to build and review cash flow forecasts, consider 
Float or Calxa. To assess performance, monitor trends and KPIs, and identify improve-
ment opportunities, look to management reporting and financial analysis tools such as 
Fathom or Microsoft’s Power BI.
You can also create visually appealing financial and management reports using soft-
ware like Spotlight Reporting or CrunchBoards. You can view social media and CRM 
analytics alongside your management information by integrating Grappster or Moxy 
Cloud Reporting into your Xero records. Customise your financial data within Microsoft 
Excel using Quick Win Excel Integration Tools or Diga, and compare multiple Xero enti-
ties, such as in a franchise situation, by applying Fathom, Spotlight Multi or Qvinci to all 
the relevant files. Visit www.xero.com/add-ons/category/reporting/ to view avail-
able Xero reporting add-on solutions, and check out Chapter 16 for general information 
about the Xero add-ons available.

CHAPTER 12  Monitoring Your Business      329
Unravelling the Business  
Performance dashboard
The Business Performance dashboard contains bar graphs of the monthly averages 
of different financial ratios, reflecting various aspects of the business’s health. If 
you ever did anything as advanced as a high school business subject, you’ll be 
familiar with some of the standard ratios shown here.
To access the Business Performance dashboard from the home dashboard, click on 
Reports → All Reports, go to the Search Reports field on the top right, and then 
search for Business Performance. You then click on Business Performance Report 
to drill down to the Business Performance dashboard and see the 12-month trends 
for each graph.
For the ratio calculations on the Business Performance dashboard to work prop-
erly, transactions need to be accurately coded to the correct account type. Report 
code mapping is something only a Xero Adviser has access to. Generally, the 
default mapping is reliable, but you should check with your Xero Adviser in case 
your mapping needs to be refined.
The graphs that shows each ratio in action are set up in a similar way:
»
» Star: On the top left is a star. The ratio appears on the home dashboard when 
it’s clicked blue.
»
» Full year ratio: The ratio calculations for the last 12 months appear in the top 
right-hand corner.
»
» Monthly ratio: Hover on the month bars to see the ratio relevant to that 
month; this replaces the 12-month ratio.
To see the underlying details behind each graph, click on the graph’s title. At the 
top of the screen you find a simple explanation of what the graph shows. Xero also 
provides the relevant ratio equation. Click on any month bar to see your monthly 
values populate the equation; the monthly split is listed below the graph. Click the 
back arrow to return to the Business Performance dashboard and access the other 
graphs.
Xero provides eight standard ratios:
»
» Current Liabilities to Net Worth: An indicator of the business’s ability to pay 
its debts.
»
» Current Ratio: A liquidity and efficiency ratio indicating whether the business 
can access assets that can be utilised to pay off its liabilities.

330      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
»
» Debt Ratio: Indicates the level company assets are financed by debt. A low 
ratio means that the business is not highly leveraged and not reliant on 
loans or other people. A high ratio means that the business is reliant on 
outside loans.
»
» Debt to Equity Ratio: Indicates the level of debt the business is using to 
finance assets. A lower ratio typically indicates stability.
»
» Fixed Assets to Net Worth Ratio: The ratio measures the solvency of the 
company; that is, its ability to meet its long-term financial obligations.
It’s important that transactions are correctly coded to the appropriate fixed 
asset account type for this ratio to work.
»
» Gross Profit %: Indicates a business’s profitability, as well as how efficiently 
resources are being used and how effectively costs are being controlled within 
the business.
»
» Net Profit on Net Sales %: Also known as the Net Profit Margin, this ratio 
shows the amount of sales dollar left over after you’ve paid out all your 
expenses. It’s a profitability indicator that expresses how well a business 
converts its sales into profit — essentially, it’s your business’s net income.
»
» Working Capital to Total Assets %: A liquidity ratio indicating the business’s 
ability to cover short-term financial obligations. A low or decreasing ratio 
suggests that liabilities are too high and may need to be reviewed.
By default, you see the standard ratios when you view the Business Performance 
report. You can also ask your Xero Adviser (someone like me) to reveal an addi-
tional seven advanced ratios (they simply need to log in to the Business Perfor-
mance dashboard and click the button labelled Make Visible). These seven advanced 
ratios then appear at the bottom of the Business Performance dashboard:
»
» Net Operating Profit Rate Return: A profitability ratio indicating how 
efficiently the business uses its assets.
»
» Quick Ratio: A liquidity ratio measuring the liquid assets available to cover 
the business’s current liabilities. Essentially, it shows how easily the business 
can pay bills; a high ratio indicates the business is in a strong liquidity position.
»
» Return on Capital Employed %: A profitability ratio indicating how efficiently 
the business uses its capital.
»
» Accounts Receivable Days: The average number of days it takes to collect 
outstanding invoices.
»
» Management Rate Return %: Indicates how efficiently assets are used 
within the business.

CHAPTER 12  Monitoring Your Business      331
»
» Retained Earnings to Total Assets %: An indicator of how dependent the 
business is on debt. A low ratio indicates that the business is reliant on debt, 
rather than using the retained earnings within the business.
»
» Return on Investment %: A performance measure evaluating how efficiently 
the business’s investments are used.
To arrange the ratios on your Business Performance dashboard, scroll to the bot-
tom of the dashboard and click on Add, Remove or Arrange Items to access an 
editable area:
»
» To conceal a graph, click Hide
»
» To redisplay a graph, click Show
»
» To rearrange the blocks on the dashboard, select the square block containing 
two rows of three dots and drag and drop it to the desired area
When you’re satisfied with the structure, click the green Done button.
Understanding Xero’s Tracking Options
For Christmas, my daughter gave me an iPhone case with a circular turret filter 
attachment that fits across the camera lens. It has multiple crazy filters — reds, 
blues, yellows, swirls and love hearts. So, taking the same portrait of Charlie my 
dog while changing the filter produces pictures with a different perspective.
Xero Tracking options work a bit like a camera filter. Using the same business 
data, they enable you to see information from different perspectives. The Tracking 
options also allow you to departmentalise different transactions, enabling report-
ing on specific areas of the business.
You can create up to two separate Tracking categories, and define unlimited cat-
egory options. All transactions can be allocated to a Tracking category, and this 
field can be edited for unlocked periods. For example, if your business operates 
over multiple states, you could track the state a transaction occurs in by setting up 
a Tracking category called STATES and the category options could be Alabama, 
Alaska, Arizona and so on (or New South Wales, Victoria and so on).
Tracking enables you to produce reports that compare the performance and prof-
itability across different categories, and view the position of the category. Con-
tinuing with the STATES Tracking category example, you or key members of your 
staff could use this information to manage businesses or staff located in different 

332      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
states, and reward and replicate good performance while identifying and adjust-
ing poor performance. Furthermore, monthly budgets for Tracking categories can 
also be created.
In the following sections, I take you through all the options available using Xero’s 
Tracking functions.
Using Tracking
To start you thinking about how you can use Xero’s Tracking options to better 
understand your business, I can give you an example using a mining company. 
Mines are required to provide financial reports defined by individual projects and 
tenements. (Tenements are exploration licences.)
Here’s how the company could use Tracking:
»
» Two separate Tracking categories can be set up to define the Project and 
Tenement options.
»
» A single invoice can have transactions allocated to both Project and Tenement 
simultaneously.
»
» If an invoice needs to be split across multiple Tracking options, the individual 
line items of the invoice can be allocated to different options using a percent-
age (‘%’) rather than a unit (‘1’) in the Unit Price field to easily enable this 
allocation. For example, one line could list the quantity as 0.85 (85 per cent) 
and the next line could list the quantity as 0.15 (15 per cent), totalling 100 per 
cent. With the Unit Price the same at each line, you can easily allocate the 
percentage.
You can then produce reports to reflect Project performance and Tenement per-
formance as required.
Working out what your  
business should track
Deciding what areas of your business you need to track through Xero is a good thing 
to ponder over a coffee (with your management accountant, if you have one!).
A good place to start is by looking at whether your business has preordained 
groupings. Would information identified by such groups as geographical areas, 
sales staff, events, promotions, cars, wholesale versus retail, rental properties, 
grants, or expenses that need to be on-charged be useful?

CHAPTER 12  Monitoring Your Business      333
You’re able to apply two Tracking categories to transactions. Think about how you 
could use this feature in your business. For example, you could compare how
»
» Grants are applied to different geographical areas
»
» Different events affect retail sales
»
» Staff perform over different projects
»
» Sales staff perform during different promotions
With the insights gained through using Xero’s Tracking options, you may recog-
nise, for example, that particular sales staff need additional training, events that 
aren’t resulting in sales need to be cancelled, or some areas are missing out on 
grant funding.
Setting up Tracking
To set up Tracking options, follow these steps:
1.	 Access the Tracking dashboard from the home dashboard and click on 
Settings → General Settings → Tracking.
The Tracking dashboard appears.
2.	 Create a new Tracking category by clicking Add Tracking Category and 
filling out the Tracking Category Name field.
If you want to track sales across different states, for example, you could enter 
STATES in the Tracking Category Name field.
3.	 Add Category options for the three available fields.
If adding states, you could enter Alabama in the first field, Alaska in the 
second and Arizona in the third.
Both the Tracking Category Name and Category Options fields allow for more 
characters than you could possibly want. So, you don’t have to use abbrevia-
tions if the full name works better for you.
4.	 Add more category options by clicking on the Add Another Option button 
and filling out the new field that appears.
See Figure 12-2 for where the Add Another Option button appears. Repeat this 
step for any additional category options required. (Remember: The number of 
additional categories you can add is extensive, but don’t go crazy — too many 
would be unmanageable.)
5.	 Click the green Save button.
This saves the newly created Tracking category.

334      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
Editing, deleting and applying  
Tracking options
If you need to edit specific Tracking category names or options in Xero, you can do 
so from the main Tracking dashboard. Simply access the name or option that 
needs editing, click the Rename link, edit the field, and click the Rename button 
to save the changes. This updates all existing transaction entries. Note: Tracking 
options cannot be combined.
To delete a Tracking name or option completely, access the specific Tracking 
option that needs deleting from the Tracking dashboard and click on the cross to 
the right. If the Tracking category has been used against any transaction, it will be 
archived. Click OK and the Archive tab appears, with the archived transaction 
listed underneath. This transaction is still viewable on reports and can be restored 
from the Archive area, but it cannot be allocated to any new transaction. If the 
Tracking category has never been used, you simply confirm the deletion by click-
ing Delete when the confirmation window pops up. All reference to the deleted 
name or option disappears from Xero.
Tracking options can be applied to new transactions or retrospectively to existing 
transactions. Apply Tracking allocations by accessing a transaction, clicking in the 
Tracking column and selecting the option from the drop-down menu.
Continuing the example from the preceding section, say you have created a Track-
ing category called STATES and have added the names of all relevant states as 
FIGURE 12-2: 
Xero’s Tracking 
Category window. 
Source: Xero 2016

CHAPTER 12  Monitoring Your Business      335
category options within it, so you can track your sales by the states they took place 
in. If you know a sales transaction relates to a sale that took place in Alabama, 
click on the Tracking column within the transaction and select ‘Alabama’ from the 
drop-down menu.
You can then finish processing the transaction as normal.
Reviewing Tracking reports
One specific report in Xero is dedicated to Tracking: The Tracking Summary 
report. To access this report from Xero’s home dashboard, click Reports on the 
menu bar and click All Reports → Tracking Summary Report. The report displays 
a single Tracking option by a selected account group for a defined period. You can 
use this report to identify how Tracking is allocated to accounts.
Some of the new generation reports can filter by Tracking category. The older 
management reports that filter by Tracking category include:
»
» Account Transaction
»
» Balance Sheet
»
» Bank Summary
»
» Budget Variance
»
» Cash Summary
»
» Depreciation Schedule
»
» Fixed Asset Reconciliation
»
» Income Statement/Profit and Loss
To view customised Tracking on the Balance Sheet, follow these steps:
1.	 From the home dashboard, click on Reports → All Reports → Balance 
Sheet (New).
2.	 At the Balance Date field, select the current month and year.
3.	 Click on Report Settings.
Various filtering criteria appear.
4.	 Click on + Add a Filter and select the desired Tracking category from the 
drop-down menu.
5.	 Beside the Tracking field, select Is from the drop-down menu.

336      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
6.	 At the next field, click on the drop-down arrow and select the desired 
Tracking option.
If you need to add a second (and final) Tracking category, repeat Steps 4 to 6.
7.	 Update the report criteria by clicking the blue Update button.
The Balance Sheet report displays a single list of numbers that meet the 
Tracking criteria.
Identify transactions that don’t have a Tracking account assigned to them by 
selecting the Unassigned option at the two Tracking fields and clicking Update. 
You can drill down on the numbers to see further detail, edit the transaction and 
assign the Tracking option. Of course, not all transactions need to have a Tracking 
option assigned to them, but if you’re relying on Tracking information, reviewing 
unassigned accounts to ensure information is complete is good business practice.
To view customised Tracking on the Income Statement/Profit and Loss report, 
follow these steps:
1.	 From the home dashboard, click on Reports → All Reports → Income 
Statement/Profit and Loss.
2.	 Click on one of the Tracking name links on the customisation dashboard.
Choose between Compare [Category Name 1] or Compare [Category Name 2]. 
The report updates immediately.
The Income Statement/Profit and Loss report displays a comparative list of 
numbers that meet the selected Tracking criteria.
If using lots of Tracking options in one category — for example, the 50 states of 
America — viewing reports online can be overwhelming. Exporting the report 
in spreadsheet format makes it easier to tackle the comparative information. 
To do this, generate the desired report in Xero, click the blue Export button at 
the bottom of the screen and then select Excel to download the spreadsheet to 
your computer. After opening in Excel, you can also click the cell beneath the 
heading of the first Tracking option and select the Freeze Panes option. The 
headers remain fixed in place as you scroll to the right, making it easier to read 
the report.
Tracking conversion balances
If you moved to Xero from another system and have existing Tracking balances, 
you may want to enter these balances in Xero so the Tracking reports balances are 
complete to date.

CHAPTER 12  Monitoring Your Business      337
To enter the Tracking balances, follow these steps:
1.	 Identify existing Tracking balances as at conversion date, split out by 
account.
Refer to Chapter 2, where I explain conversion dates and accounts, for more 
on this.
Using the example of Tracking a state from America, the data for the Tracking 
option Alabama could include:
•	 Account type
•	 Account name
•	 Amount
•	 Income: Consulting income, $1,500 (CR)
•	 Direct costs: Consulting COS, $700 (DR)
Tracking options can be allocated to all account types, and the Net Income/
Loss automatically calculates. You need to be able to identify whether the 
account balance is debit or credit in nature and, ideally, the debit amounts 
should equal the credit amounts. However, if a difference does exist, it’s 
allocated to the automatically created Tracking Transfers liability account. Don’t 
stress if this happens — the allocation isn’t creating any new transactions in 
your system but is simply accounting for what has not already been allocated.
The Tracking allocations opening balance is entered via a manual journal. 
Users with Adviser or Standard status in Xero can enter a manual journal.
2.	 Check the respective Tracking option exists in your data file by clicking 
Settings → General Settings → Tracking.
If the Tracking option is not listed, refer to the section ‘Setting up Tracking’, 
earlier in this chapter, for guidance.
3.	 If you have Adviser or Standard user status, you can create a new journal 
from the home dashboard by clicking Reports → All Reports → Journal 
Report and then clicking the + Add New Journal link.
A new manual journal template opens.
4.	 In the Narration field, enter text to describe the purpose of the journal.
For example, possible text could be Tracking option opening balance of Alabama.
5.	 Check the Default Narration to Journal Line Description box to allow this 
description to autofill all transaction Description fields.
6.	 Record your conversion date in the Date field.

338      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
7.	Check the Show Journal on a Cash Basis Reports box to define the 
accounting basis the journal is to use.
8.	Specify the values entered in the journal are Tax Exclusive by selecting 
the drop-down option from the Amounts Are field.
9.	At the journal line, click in the Description field to activate the default 
narration to automatically fill the field.
10.	Click in the first Account field, start entering the account description and 
select the correct account from the drop-down options.
In this scenario, it would be Consulting Income, and as it’s selected the tax code 
autofills the Tax Rate field.
11.	Click in the Tax Rate field, and select a consumer tax rate that is not 
reported.
12.	Click in the Tracking field, and select the Tracking option that the 
opening balances are being entered for.
In this scenario, the option would be Alabama.
13.	Enter the account balance in the relevant Debit or Credit column.
In this scenario, 1500 is entered in the Credit column.
14.	Drop down to the next line and repeat Steps 9 to 11.
15.	Leave the Tracking field blank, because this line is not allocated to a 
Tracking code.
16.	Enter the account balance in the opposite column that was selected 
at Step 13.
In this scenario, 1500 is entered in the Debit column.
For the Tracking conversion to work, the two entries in the Credit and Debit 
columns must result in the total debit and credit balance at the bottom of the 
journal being equal. If the total balances are not equal, review the steps, and 
check amounts entered are identical and no consumer tax has been inadver-
tently generated by the transaction. The net effect on the general ledger and 
the tax account is zero, and the conversion Tracking balance is allocated.
17.	Add extra lines as necessary to the journal entry by clicking the Add a 
New Line button.
18.	Post the journal entry to the ledger by clicking the green Post button.
To check the process worked, click Reports → Balance Sheet, select the criteria 
Compare [Tracking option] and compare it to the original numbers for the 
conversion date. In this scenario, the criteria would be Compare Alabama. 

CHAPTER 12  Monitoring Your Business      339
If Asset and Liability balances were entered, the Balance Sheet also needs to be 
reviewed. To check the Balance Sheet, click Reports → Balance Sheet. For the 
criteria, select the Balance Date as at the conversion date, click the More 
Options link and, at the Filter By field, select the relevant Tracking option.
Maintaining Budget Control:  
Budget Manager
In Chapter  10, I describe how to create an annual budget and review forecasts 
using Xero’s Budget Manager. Xero also allows you to produce a Budget Variance 
report to help you review budget figures against actual results — helping you to 
explain the past and understand the future of your business.
You can access the Budget Variance report from the Reports dashboard. Once you 
have it open, select the Actual vs Overall Budget criteria.
You can then select the Wide View link at the right corner to see the full report on 
screen, if necessary.
Xero’s Budget Variance report shows the following:
»
» The ‘Actuals’ column is the actual results for the month.
»
» The ‘Budget’ column is the budget figures for that month.
»
» The ‘Var’ is the dollar value of the difference between the actual results and 
budget figures.
»
» The ‘Var%’ is the percentage difference between the actual results and budget 
figures.
Xero uses colours to help you quickly identify differences between forecasts and 
actuals, with green indicating a positive difference (actuals were higher than 
forecasts) and red a negative difference.
Read together, the ‘Var’ and ‘Var%’ columns highlight the difference between 
actual results and what was budgeted. Ideally, you want the variance in either 
direction to be minimal. While a positive variance may be great, it may also sug-
gest that the budget wasn’t challenging enough for the business and you may 
need to increase it to keep yourself (and staff members) motivated. Red (negative) 
variances are cause for concern and should be reviewed, understood and dealt 
with if necessary.

340      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
Sometimes reviewing variances on a year-to-date (YTD) basis is more useful, 
because the budget may have been simply calculated and split across 12 months, 
leading to wide distortions. In particular, you should use variances on a YTD basis 
if you didn’t have specific details to set your budget on a monthly basis. (A large 
business should have the resources to develop a budget on a monthly basis; how-
ever, a smaller business averaging out figures across a year is totally reasonable.)
If variances are minimal, congratulations! This demonstrates budget preparations 
were acutely aligned with business operations, and you should have added confi-
dence the year should continue as the budget has mapped out.
Reviewing budget information assists you with developing your budget for the 
next year, and helps you plan the business’s journey. For example, reviewing the 
budget helps you decide whether you have the capacity to employ additional staff, 
the funds to move from serviced offices to a rented office, or the capacity to deal 
with planned promotions.

Managing Your 
Inventory Items
I
 worked with a client who provided computer information technology support to 
businesses around Brisbane. It bought in various low-value items such as cords, 
wires, adapters and connectors, which could be used to set up and maintain 
information technology installations on client sites. These accessories are high 
volume and low cost, so the business invoiced its customers without tracking the 
inventory volume  — as such, the business managed this inventory using the 
untracked inventory function in Xero. Occasionally, my client bought and sold 
hardware such as laptops and iPads for its customers. These items are high in 
value, and so my client monitored the number on hand using tracked inventory in 
Xero — at any point in time, it knew the value and volume of its stock of these 
high-value items.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the Inventory Items dashboard in Xero, where 
tracked and untracked items are created and pricing is set. (Details of how invoices 
and bills are dealt with are provided in Chapters 6 and 7.)
Chapter 13

342      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
Xero offers a simple inventory management solution for monitoring and process-
ing services and uncomplicated physical inventory. Even if you don’t use inven-
tory, understanding how items are used can help save data-processing time. 
However, if you have a retail store or significant physical inventory to manage, 
don’t try to get Xero to manage business processes it was never meant to. Instead, 
integrate Xero with one of the many add-on inventory management solutions 
available. (I cover these add-ons briefly in this chapter, and in more detail in 
Chapter 16.)
Understanding Inventory Items
From Xero’s home dashboard, you can access the inventory functions by clicking 
Accounts → Inventory. From here, items can be created, imported, exported or 
searched for. A list details the Item Code, Item Name, Cost Price, Sales Price and 
Quantity. Clicking column headers sorts the columns.
I cover creating an inventory item later in this chapter, so you can skip ahead if 
you like. However, if you’d prefer to get more of an understanding of inventory 
and how it’s reported, read on.
Periodic and perpetual inventory
Two methods of managing inventory are generally accepted: Periodic and 
perpetual.
A periodic inventory system doesn’t keep a count of the inventory as it is pur-
chased or sold. Inventory is recognised as a direct cost when it’s purchased, and 
sales income when it’s sold. A stocktake is needed to update the value of any 
inventory reported on the balance sheet. In Xero, this is known as untracked 
inventory.
A perpetual inventory system undertakes continuous counts of inventory within 
the business, updating inventory values, and applying the cost of the item against 
the sale price in the month it’s sold. In Xero, this is known as tracked inventory.
Depending on your business, you may have a mixture of both periodic (untracked) 
and perpetual (tracked) inventory.

CHAPTER 13  Managing Your Inventory Items      343
Defining inventory accounts
Grouping different sorts of items helps you in your decision-making process 
around inventory, giving a clearer idea of income, cost of sales and gross profit at 
a group level in your Profit and Loss reports. You can also monitor the perfor-
mance of groups of inventory items using Xero’s Tracking feature (covered in 
Chapter 12).
However, Xero only allows two Tracking categories, and perhaps you’ve used 
them already — maybe you’re tracking sales by sales location and by sales staff. 
If so, here’s a workaround that gives you additional reporting functionality. Note: 
If you have an available tracking category, use that! Only use this suggestion if 
you’re using tracking categories elsewhere.
The method suggested in this section of grouping inventory accounts isn’t suit-
able for a retail store!
One of my client’s income streams is self-publishing books; she has self-­published 
three books, and each book is defined as a different grouping. This means inven-
tory can be spilt into three groups: Book 1, Book 2 and Book 3. Her Chart of 
Accounts includes additional general ledger accounts to reflect the inventory 
groupings, as you can see in Table 13-1.
When items are created, setting up inventory groupings means transactions are 
automatically posted to the appropriate account. This is easy to set up and quickly 
generates useful information. (Refer to Chapter 2 for guidance on setting up gen-
eral ledger accounts, and Chapter  9 for more information on grouping similar 
accounts using report layouts.)
When it comes to considering the best inventory groupings for your business, the 
process may take some thought — and it could be something that you come back 
to. At a minimum, I suggest three groups, and probably at a maximum ten groups. 
Detailing each individual item in the Chart of Accounts isn’t required, and doing 
so means your reports become noisy and you’re unable to glean useful informa-
tion. By setting up the Chart of Accounts with basic groupings, you can view

inventory at a group-detail level, or create subtotals and view the information at 
a summary level.
If you’re unsure how to allocate your inventory, speak to your Xero Adviser.
Setting Up a Xero Inventory Item
In order to set up inventory items within Xero, gather together details relating to 
the items, including description, and purchase and sales information.
Creating inventory items
To create a new item, follow these steps:
1.	 From the home dashboard, click Accounts → Inventory.
This takes you to the Inventory dashboard.
2.	 Click the + New Item button.
The New Item window opens (see Figure 13-1).

CHAPTER 13  Managing Your Inventory Items      345
3.	 Enter the item code in the mandatory Item Code field.
Think about how you plan to name inventory items — make sure they’re identi-
fiable and easy to find. Mnemonic codes that utilise informative alphanumeric 
combinations are useful when deciding on a naming convention. For example, 
using AU, USA or NZ to suffix an inventory item could indicate a source country. 
When products are sourced from a single main supplier, consider using the 
supplier number as the item code or name. Note: Some reports display item 
lists in item code/name order. If the item code/name starts with zeros, the 
zeros are dropped from the code when exported to Excel. This may have 
knock-on effects elsewhere.
4.	 Fill out the Item Name field.
5.	 If you want to track the item, check the box marked I Track This Item. (If 
you don’t intend to track the value or quantity of your inventory items on 
hand, you don’t need to enter tracking details and can skip to Step 6.)
It’s good practice to allocate inventory to an asset account, and you need to 
select the Inventory Account Type if you intend to use Tracked Inventory. If 
you’re using Xero’s default Chart of Accounts, the asset account is called 630: 
Inventory. If you’ve imported or created your own chart of accounts, you may 
need to create a new account if you don’t already have one. Refer to Chapter 2 
for guidance on setting up accounts.
After you record an inventory transaction, you can’t change the allocated asset 
account. Refer to the section ‘Defining inventory accounts’, earlier in this 
chapter, when selecting an account.
6.	 If the item will be purchased, complete the next five steps; otherwise, 
jump to Step 12.
If you’re using inventory items to record standard service descriptions to 
quickly populate your invoices, you don’t need to enter purchase details and 
can skip to Step 12.
7.	 Leave the box beside I Purchase This Item checked.
The purchase detail fields remain.
8.	 Enter the unit price of up to four decimal places in the Unit Price field.
Some businesses have contractual purchase agreements in place. It’s useful to 
enter the agreed price here, as a crosscheck that supplier bills are indeed 
correct.
9.	 Select the purchase account from the drop-down Account field.
Refer to the section ‘Defining inventory accounts’, earlier in this chapter, when 
selecting an account. If you intend to track the inventory, the account is a Cost 
of Goods Sold account; if you don’t intend to track the inventory, the account is 
a Purchases account.

346      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
10.	Select the default tax rate from the drop-down Tax Rate field.
This rate can be overridden when processing a bill.
11.	Enter a detailed item description in the Purchases Description field.
The description automatically appears on bills and can be overridden. 
Including extensive details here, which can be edited when the bill is created, 
can save data entry time.
For example, a bookkeeping business could create a service item called 
‘Bookkeeping’ with the description, ‘Data entry, filing, bank reconciliation, 
review accounts payable, review accounts receivable, payroll, stock control and 
training’. When the description autofills on the invoice, additional details can be 
added (for example, ‘bank reconciliation — savings account’), or some descrip-
tions could be deleted (for example, ‘filing’). This saves you (or other users) 
time, and prompts you to leave a detailed invoice.
12.	If the item will be sold, complete the next five steps; otherwise, untick 
the box beside I Sell This Item and jump to Step 18.
13.	Leave the box beside I Sell This Item checked.
The sales detail fields remain.
14.	Enter the unit price of up to four decimal places in the Unit Price field.
This amount appears on invoices and bills. Changing the Tax Inclusive/ Tax 
Exclusive option on the invoice/bill affects how the item is treated for con-
sumer tax and the total for the transaction.
15.	Select the sales account from the drop-down Account field.
Refer to the section ‘Defining inventory accounts’, earlier in this chapter, when 
selecting an account.
16.	Select the default tax rate from the drop-down Tax Rate field.
This rate can be overridden when processing an invoice.
17.	Enter a detailed item description in the Sales Description field.
The description automatically appears on invoices and can be overridden.
18.	Click the green Save button.
Importing and exporting item details  
and importing opening balances
Inventory item details can be exported from and imported into Xero, and opening 
balances for tracked items can be imported into Xero. This is a useful feature if 
you have existing data and are converting to Xero, or if you need to make bulk 

CHAPTER 13  Managing Your Inventory Items      347
changes to item details (such as increasing selling prices). Inventory files can be 
exported to CSV and PDF files and can be imported from CSV files. Refer to 
­Chapter 3 for instructions on how to export and import CSV files into Xero, how to 
convert CSV files into an editable spreadsheet format, and how to import opening 
balances.
To export the inventory items as a PDF report, go to the Inventory Items dash-
board, click on the Export button and select Export to PDF from the drop-down 
list. You can then locate the Inventory Items PDF in your downloads folder.
Managing Inventory Items
Once set up, you may need to occasionally review and update your inventory in 
Xero. The following sections show you how.
Making use of inventory items reports
Xero has five reports relating to inventory item information. Xero’s inventory 
items reports detail the following:
»
» Inventory Item Details (New): This report shows inventory item details, 
including value movement, quantity on hand, unit cost and sales price, and 
the margin and profit per item.
»
» Inventory Item List (New): This report lists all the core details of the 
inventory items, including average cost, total value and quantity on hand.
»
» Inventory Item Summary (New): This report shows purchase and sales 
details, including quantity and profit per item.
WHEN IS INVENTORY NOT REALLY 
INVENTORY?
Inventory items don’t need to be physical objects; they can be services. For example, I 
could set up Training, Half-day training or One-on-one training as items in Xero but, in fact, 
they are services. Setting up services as inventory items saves time populating the 
description area of an invoice. Inventory items don’t have to be something you can hold 
or throw at a wall!

348      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
»
» Inventory Item Summary: This report shows purchase and sales details, 
including net total. In the old-style reports, you also have the option to show 
inventory in the currency it was purchased or sold.
»
» Sales by Item: This report details current unit price, quantity sold, total sales 
and the average price of the inventory item for a selected period. The last two 
values are exclusive of consumer tax. Below the inventory sales information is 
an interesting summary, splitting out sales between item sales, other sales, 
cash sales and credits. Drilling down on the Item Name displays details of 
sales during the period selected of that item. In the old-style reports, you also 
have the option to show inventory in the currency it was sold.
The two old-style reports — the Inventory Item Summary report and the Sales by 
Item report — don’t include tracked inventory items. If you use tracked inventory 
in your business, refer to the three new-style reports.
To access the inventory reports, go to the home dashboard menu bar, click on 
Reports → All Reports and select the relevant report from the Reports dashboard.
Searching for and reviewing  
inventory items
To locate an item, go to the Inventory dashboard and use the search bar. As you 
start to enter a description, Xero automatically searches and starts making 
suggestions.
Editing and deleting inventory items
To access an individual inventory item, simply go to the Inventory dashboard and 
click on the relevant item.
To attach a file, click on the file storage symbol on the top right and follow the 
process of adding a file. Note: This facility is not available when creating a new 
inventory item.
At the bottom is a section headed Recent Transactions, which lists transactions 
against the selected inventory item, including details of the quantity and unit 
price. If you have multi-currency, you click on the foreign currency unit in the 
Total column to reveal the exchange rate used. (For further insights into multi-
currency, see Chapter 15.)

CHAPTER 13  Managing Your Inventory Items      349
To edit an item, click the Edit Item button. The Edit Item window appears (see 
Figure 13-2). Make any changes here as required and, once satisfied, click the Save 
button to record the changes.
Items on repeating bills and invoices can’t be deleted. The repeating bill or invoice 
needs to be deleted, or the item removed from the repeating template, before the 
item can be deleted. (Refer to Chapter 6 for information on invoices and Chapter 7 
for more on bills.)
To delete an item, go to the Inventory Items dashboard, check the box to the left 
of the item and click on the Delete option. A confirmation window opens, and you 
just need to click the red Delete button to confirm that the items should be deleted. 
Tracked items that have transactions, adjustments or opening balances recorded 
against them can’t be deleted.
Once deleted, items are no longer available to allocate to transactions and can’t be 
viewed on the Inventory Items dashboard. Furthermore, if you edit an approved 
bill, invoice or credit note (adjustment note) or have transactions in Draft or 
Awaiting Approval status, the item does a Bermuda Triangle on your records and 
vanishes!

350      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
To mark an item as inactive, go to the Inventory Items dashboard, check the box 
to the left of the item and click the Mark as Inactive option. The item turns grey. 
If you later change your mind, follow this process and opt for Mark as Active 
instead.
Adjusting Inventory Balances
While living in Toronto, I had a friend who managed a warehouse of expensive 
make-up and perfumes. He’d tell me of the creative way stock was pilfered by 
staff. They’d carve pages out of books to encase perfume bottles perfectly, wear 
overcoats during summer or bring massive lunch boxes to work! (My friend also 
used to invite me to awesome VIP discount days, so my make-up bag misses him 
big time!)
Inventory requires adjusting for a variety of reasons — including recognising an 
opening balance, damage, theft and technological obsolescence. Adjustments to 
quantity and/or dollar values of inventory need to be reflected in your records.
Periodic stocktakes
Every year around the world, accountants gather clipboards, travel to distant 
locations, put on yellow safety vests and infiltrate storage rooms, with the pur-
pose of counting stock. Stocktakes happen in the weirdest of places: I’ve donned 
winter coats, boarded cherry pickers and travelled through massive warehouse 
freezers counting frozen sausage rolls and party pies. (I much preferred the times 
I was counting chocolate bars or make-up sets. Fortunately, my client who 
­distributes guano  — the poo from cave-dwelling bats, and a highly effective 
­fertiliser — has never called me in for a stocktake!)
A stocktake is a count of the business inventory on hand, typically done at the end 
of the financial year, though some businesses do it more regularly. A periodic 
inventory system (refer to the section ‘Periodic and perpetual inventory’, earlier 
in this chapter) relies on stocktakes to manually update the Asset and Direct Cost 
accounts in Xero.
The update provided by the stocktake gives the business an accurate idea of stock 
quantity owned by the business, and so allows your accountant to reconcile physi-
cal stock to the inventory records and calculate the difference. With accurate 
knowledge about stock movements and stock on hand, you can make informed 
decisions about your inventory.

CHAPTER 13  Managing Your Inventory Items      351
Determine a regular date to undertake a stocktake. Typically, this date is at the 
end of a period — for example, the end of the financial year. Determine actual 
stock levels and multiply the results by the purchase value to determine actual 
value.
Use a connected inventory solution to determine whether inventory adjustments 
should happen directly into the add-on solution or directly into Xero, and process 
accordingly.
Before you adjust your stock values, check that your accountant agrees with the 
changes you propose. (Yearly opening and closing stock values need to be included 
in your Profit and Loss report.)
Adjusting untracked inventory values
To adjust stock values, you first need to undertake a physical stocktake to deter-
mine the actual value of inventory on hand (refer to the preceding section). You 
then follow these steps to adjust untracked inventory values:
1.	 Check the current stock value in Xero by reviewing Inventory Accounts 
on the Balance Sheet as at the stocktake date.
2.	 Compare the actual value determined from the stocktake to the book 
value of inventory and calculate the difference (if any).
3.	 Record a manual journal to adjust inventory account values.
Refer to Chapter 12 for details on how to enter a manual journal. For specific 
fields within the manual journal, note the following:
•	 Narration field: Add a clear description, such as Adjusting Stock Value
•	 Date field: Add the date of the stocktake
•	 Amounts: Select Tax Exclusive
Typically, the debit entry is written above the credit entry in a journal entry.
4.	 Check the Inventory Accounts on the Balance Sheet as at the stocktake 
date reflect the actual stocktake value.
If balances don’t match, check and correct the journal entry.

352      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
Adjusting tracked inventory quantities
To adjust the quantity of tracked inventory items, follow these steps:
1.	 From the home dashboard, click Accounts → Inventory, and then from 
the Inventory dashboard click on the tracked inventory item to open it.
2.	 Click on the button labelled Options and, from the drop-down menu, 
select New Adjustment.
The New Adjustment window opens.
3.	 At the Adjustment Type drop-down menu, select Decrease Quantity or 
Increase Quantity.
4.	 Select the date of the adjustment from the Date field.
The inventory journal’s entry is as per this date; however, the change in 
quantity reflects the date when it’s recorded.
5.	 Enter the adjustment details in the next block.
The quantity adjustment is entered in the Adjustment field (or alternatively 
in the New Qty on Hand field). When adjusting for increasing quantity, enter 
the cost price per item in the Cost Price field. When adjusting for decreasing 
quantity, the cost price is dependent on the average cost at the exact moment 
of the transaction. This value is exclusive of consumer tax.
As an example, if you make a quantity adjustment to reduce inventory by 
50 units, and the value of each unit is $2, the valuation of the inventory reduces 
by $100 while the volume of the inventory reduces by 50 units.
6.	 Select the Adjustment Account that the revaluation should be allocated 
to at the block below.
Refer to Chapter 2 for guidance on setting up new accounts. Typically, the 
account type will be a Direct Cost account.
7.	 Enter the reason for the adjustment in the compulsory Notes field.
8.	 Save the revaluation by clicking the blue button labelled Review 
Adjustment.
The Review Adjustment window opens, with a summary of the adjusting 
inventory journal entry you’re making. Click the green button labelled Post 
Adjustment to accept the revaluation into your records. Click Back if you wish 
to make changes.
Note: This process creates an inventory journal. You can view it in the Journal Report 
on the Reports dashboard (not via the Manual Journal dashboard).

CHAPTER 13  Managing Your Inventory Items      353
Xero processes the transaction as a quantity adjustment. To ensure that you end 
up with the desired quantities, check the Inventory Item Summary report. If you 
can’t find the adjustment, review the entry you recorded.
The quantity or value can never fall below zero; therefore, you can never sell more 
stock than you have on hand. However, some businesses sell their stock and raise 
a Sales Invoice before they’ve purchased the stock; if this happens, the value falls 
below zero. If your business operates like this, you may need to explore an inven-
tory solution that integrates with Xero.
Adjusting tracked inventory values
If you need to change both the quantity and the value of inventory, first change 
the quantity and check your records (refer to the preceding section) before adjust-
ing the value. To adjust the value of tracked inventory items, follow these steps:
1.	 From the home dashboard, click Accounts → Inventory, and then from 
the Inventory dashboard click on the tracked inventory item to open it.
2.	 Click on the button labelled Options and, from the drop-down menu, 
select New Adjustment.
The New Adjustment window opens.
3.	 At the Adjustment Type drop-down menu, select Revaluation.
4.	 Select the date of the revaluation from the Date field.
5.	 Enter the revaluation in the next block.
This is the total revised value of this inventory item. The value is exclusive of 
consumer tax. You can make the entry in the Average Cost or Total Value 
fields.
6.	 Select the Adjustment Account that the revaluation should be allocated 
to at the block below.
Refer to Chapter 2 for guidance on setting up new accounts. Typically, the 
account type will be the Direct Cost account.
7.	 Enter the reason for the adjustment in the compulsory Notes field.
8.	 Save the revaluation by clicking the blue button labelled Review 
Adjustment.
The Review Adjustment window opens, with a summary of the adjusting 
journal entry you’re making. Click the green button labelled Post Adjustment to 
accept the revaluation into your records. Click Back if you wish to make 
changes.

354      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
To ensure that you end up with the desired valuation of the Inventory account, 
check the Balance Sheet report. To ensure that you end up with the desired valu-
ation of your inventory items, check the Inventory Items List report. If you can’t 
find the adjustment, review the entry you recorded.
Accessing Add-On Solutions
If you want to manage a robust inventory management system, you need to use 
Xero with an add-on solution. All solutions offer comprehensive inventory man-
agement solutions, and in some cases they have extensive capabilities in other 
areas. See Chapter 16 for more, and visit www.xero.com/add-ons for the latest list 
of inventory systems.

Working with Fixed 
Assets
O
ne of the first work projects I undertook was a fixed asset audit. I was 
given a list of assets, and told to find them and update their status. It was 
like a game of hide and seek. I made my way around the various buildings, 
searching for the assets and checking them off the list. I searched high and low for 
one particularly asset and, eventually, found it in an unopened wooden box under 
a table. It had never been used and no-one even knew what it was for — it just 
arrived one day and slotted itself under the table and into the Balance Sheet, 
absorbing valuable cash. Perhaps not the wisest of investments!
In this chapter, I cover Xero’s Fixed Asset Register and explain how you can use it 
to keep track of fixed assets and depreciation through the year.
Recognising Fixed Assets
A fixed asset is an asset that has an expected life of more than a year. It is a signifi-
cant investment for any business because it utilises cash that could be used else-
where in the business. This is why maintaining an accurate Fixed Asset Register is 
so important for your business. Typical small business fixed assets include cars, 
buildings, computers and office equipment.
Chapter 14

356      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
Entering a fixed asset into the register
Assets need to be assigned to the Fixed Asset Register in Xero so you can monitor 
them and depreciation can be applied. In this section, I outline how to create fixed 
assets accounts and enter a fixed asset purchase in Xero. Note: In the steps out-
lined in this section, I use the example of entering a motor vehicle on Xero’s Fixed 
Asset Register. The motor vehicle was purchased on 1 November for $10,000 (tax 
exclusive).
Creating fixed asset accounts
Before entering fixed assets into Xero, you need to create your several different 
accounts to deal with your fixed assets’ lives in your books.
Refer to Chapter  2 for guidance on creating a new account. Refer to your tax 
adviser for guidance on the tax treatment of your purchases.
As an example, here are the accounts that you need to set up to deal with a simple 
car investment:
»
» Fixed Asset account (account type: Fixed Asset). Assign the purchase costs 
of the asset to this account.
»
» Accumulated Depreciation account (account type: Fixed Asset). This is a 
negative, or contra, account. Assign the depreciation that accumulates over 
time to this asset.
WHEN IS AN ASSET NOT AN ASSET?
For some purchases, you may have flexibility about whether the purchase is classified 
as a fixed asset or an expense. Work with your tax accountant (who should have expert 
knowledge of the tax rules in your country) to determine whether business purchases 
are fixed assets or expenses. I’ve seen clients purchase what appear to be assets, and 
then work with their tax accountants to (legally) classify these as an expense, and vice 
versa. What you may prefer in a particular case depends on the outcome of the treat-
ment of the purchase.
If treated as a fixed asset, the purchase is allocated to your business’s balance sheet and 
depreciation is written off against profit over the deemed life of the asset. If treated as 
an expense, the purchase is written off against the profit in the year incurred, thus 
reducing company tax in that year.

CHAPTER 14  Working with Fixed Assets      357
Contra is an accounting term for accounts with a balance that’s opposite to the 
typical nature of their account type. A fixed asset may have its own unique 
fixed asset and contra asset account, depending on how you want to display 
them in your chart of accounts. By selecting account type Fixed Asset and 
allocating adjacent account numbers, they appear together in the Fixed Asset 
block on the Balance Sheet.
»
» Depreciation Expense account (account type: Depreciation). Allocate the 
annual depreciation expense to this account.
»
» Capital Gain on Disposal account (account type: Revenue). Assign the 
gains on parting with the asset to this account.
»
» Gain on Disposal account (account type: Revenue). This account recog-
nises any payments received for disposing of the asset.
»
» Loss on Disposal account (account type: Revenue). This account recognises 
the loss incurred for disposing of the asset (this is a contra account).
»
» Sales Proceeds account (account type: Revenue). You only need to create 
this account when you sell an asset.
Using the licence plate in the individual asset account name helps you identify 
individual motor vehicles.
When you’re designing reports (refer to Chapter 9), group the relevant fixed asset 
accounts together and subtotal them.
Choosing a date to start recording fixed assets
Before you start using the Fixed Asset Register in Xero, you need to select the 
financial year you want to start recording your fixed assets. If you’re unsure when 
to start, speak to your accountant.
To set a start date in the Fixed Asset Register:
1.	 From the home dashboard, go to Accounts → Fixed Assets and click on 
Set Start Date.
The Choose Start Date window opens. From the drop-down menu, choose the 
first day of the financial year in which you want to start calculating depreciation 
on your fixed assets.
2.	 Click the green Save button.
Later, you can come back and edit this date; however, if you change the date 
it  reverses all existing entries. Ideally, you want to get this date correct from 
the start.

358      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
Setting up asset types
Asset types provide a template for new assets, and save time during asset set-up. 
You can predefine an asset type, so when you create a new asset it’s set up in the 
same way as similar existing assets. The asset type allocates three accounts to the 
new fixed asset: Fixed Asset, Accumulated Depreciation and Depreciation Expense 
accounts. Refer to the earlier section ‘Creating fixed asset accounts’ for an expla-
nation of these accounts. By setting up an asset type, you also prescribe how 
depreciation will be calculated on the asset, including the method used (the per-
centage rate or the effective life in years).
To create an asset type, follow these steps:
1.	 From the home dashboard, go to Settings → General Settings → Fixed 
Assets and click on the Asset Types tab. Click the button labelled + New 
Asset Type.
The Add Asset Type form opens.
If you’ve already created an asset type, the button is labelled + Asset Type.
2.	 Enter the name of the fixed asset group by clicking in the field under 
Asset Type.
For example, type in Motor Vehicles.
3.	 At the next block, select the accounts (from the drop-down menu 
options) that you want to assign to the asset type.
For example, for a vehicle, you can allocate accounts as follows:
•	 Asset Account: Fixed Asset account (Motor Vehicle)
•	 Accumulated Depreciation Account: Less Accumulated Depreciation 
account (Motor Vehicle)
•	 Depreciation Expense account: Depreciation Expense account
4.	 Select the depreciation method you want to use for this fixed asset 
template from the Depreciation Method drop-down menu.
Xero offers several depreciation methods, depending on the country where 
your Xero file is based. (Refer to the later section ‘Dealing with depreciation’ 
for more information on depreciation.) These methods are variations of these 
two main approaches:
•	 Straight Line depreciation: The depreciation amount in the first year is 
the same for all subsequent years. If $10,000 is allocated a depreciation 
rate of 20 per cent, for example, every year the depreciation expense 
allocated to the asset is $2,000, meaning the asset is written off in 
five years.

CHAPTER 14  Working with Fixed Assets      359
•	 Diminishing Value depreciation: In this method, the depreciation rate 
(say, 20 per cent) is applied to the diminished value of the fixed asset. The 
first-year amount (20 per cent × $10,000 = $2,000) is identical to that used 
in the straight line depreciation scenario. In the second year, the deprecia-
tion rate is applied to the reduced value of the asset (in this example, 
20 per cent × $8,000 = $1,600). The depreciation expense gradually gets 
smaller and smaller, and the fixed asset remains on the books for a 
significantly longer period of time than if the straight line depreciation 
method had been used. This process may also be known as Reducing 
Balance (UK) or Declining Balance (US).
For the motor vehicle example, choose straight line depreciation.
5.	 Click into the Averaging Method field and, from the drop-down menu, 
select Actual Days.
The options available here depend on your Xero organisation’s region and may 
be impacted by the depreciation method selected.
6.	 Define the percentage depreciation rate you want to apply to your fixed 
asset by clicking in the Rate field and entering the figure.
If you want to opt for effective life instead of a percentage, enter the usage life 
in the next field. The options available here depend on the depreciation 
method selected.
7.	 Save the asset type by clicking the green Save button.
Once you have saved the asset type, you can click back on it to edit or delete it. 
In editing mode, a link to Assigned Assets appears on the top right, with an 
indication of the number of registered assets assigned to this asset type. Click 
on the hyperlink to drill down and see the assigned registered assets.
Purchasing and recording a fixed asset
After you’ve created your fixed asset accounts (refer to the preceding sections), 
you can ‘purchase’ your asset through Xero. To do so, you just need to process and 
approve the bill that records the purchase of the fixed asset, allocating it to the 
required fixed asset account. In this example, you’d allocate the purchase to the 
Fixed Asset account (Motor Vehicle), dating it 1 November. Refer to Chapter 7 for 
guidance on processing bills.
You can’t attach documents to a fixed asset; instead, you attach them to the sup-
plier bill, which is linked to the fixed asset when a fixed asset originates from the 
bill reflecting the asset’s purchase.

360      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
Technically, a fixed asset can be added to the Fixed Asset Register without record-
ing a purchase; however, doing so means the original value isn’t reflected in the 
Balance Sheet. Processing a purchase to a fixed asset account automatically cre-
ates it as a draft fixed asset — this is best practice. If you initially allocate a pur-
chase to an asset account, save it, then re-allocate it to a different account, it still 
remains in the asset register as a draft fixed asset. Once tagged as a draft asset, 
you need to manually remove this asset from its limbo state in the asset register 
(see the section ‘Deleting a draft asset’, later in this chapter, for more).
Note: A Standard user can record asset purchases.
To register a fixed asset already ‘purchased’ in Xero (refer to the preceding 
­section), follow these steps:
1.	 Access the Fixed Asset Register by clicking on the menu bar Accounts → 
Fixed Assets.
The purchased asset is sitting in the draft area.
2.	 Click on the Asset Number field to understand how the Fixed Asset 
number was created.
See Figure 14-1. The account name, description from invoice, purchase date 
and price will autofill. Note that the purchase price is exclusive of consumer tax.
The Asset Number prefix can be defined, and the automatic numbering of 
fixed assets is sequential and can be overridden. Just don’t confuse this with 
the account number found on the chart of accounts.
If you’re entering an asset in the Fixed Asset Register — that is, for some 
reason it hasn’t been generated from a purchase document — from the Fixed 
Assets dashboard, click on + New Asset and fill out the account name, descrip-
tion, purchase date and price fields.
3.	 Click in the Warranty Expiry date field and enter the date the warranty 
expires (if relevant).
4.	 Click in the next field, labelled Serial Number, and enter a serial number 
(if relevant).
Many assets have a bar code, identification number or serial number associ-
ated with them that can help you identify the date and place of manufacture.

CHAPTER 14  Working with Fixed Assets      361
5.	 To allocate your chosen depreciation method, select the asset type from 
the Asset Type drop-down menu options.
For example, select Motor Vehicles. Note that you have the option to set 
up another asset type if necessary. The account fields populate and are 
­un-editable.
All depreciation must be set up through asset types; refer to the earlier section 
‘Setting up asset types’ for more information.
6.	 Enter a detailed description in the Description field.
This is an opportunity to enter any warranty details.
7.	 At the next block (Book Value), define the depreciation start date in the 
Depreciation Start Date field.
If the asset’s depreciation begins before the Fixed Asset Register start date, you 
can enter the numerical value of the accumulated depreciation up to the start 
date of the Fixed Asset Register in the Accumulated Depreciation As At (start 
date) field. For reference, the book value of your fixed asset also appears. This 
may occur if you migrated across to Xero from another solution and had an 
existing Fixed Asset Register schedule and associated depreciation calculations.

8.	 To enter the cost limit or the residual value, click the blue hyperlink + 
Show More Options next to the Depreciation Start Date field and the two 
fields appear.
The cost limit is a ceiling value applied to an asset, to limit the amount of 
depreciation that can be claimed.
The residual value is the remaining value of the asset after it has been fully 
depreciated. Essentially, it reflects what you could sell it for.
9.	 Click the green Register button to register the Fixed Asset.
The registered asset appears now under the Registered tab. Alternatively, you 
can save the details and come back and work on them later by clicking on the 
blue Save as Draft button.
Refer to Chapter 3 for guidance on importing fixed assets on a .csv file.
Editing a fixed asset
To edit an existing fixed asset, follow these steps:
1.	 Access the fixed asset by clicking on the menu bar Accounts → Fixed 
Assets and click on the Registered tab. Select the asset you want to edit.
The fixed asset’s details appear. Across the top of your screen are two tabs: 
Summary and Value.
2.	 Click the Options button on the top right of the screen, and from the 
drop-down menu, select Edit.
You can edit all fields except the allocated accounts and book value. For 
example, if the depreciation rate changes, you can edit the depreciation rate 
field at any time during the life of the asset.
3.	 Click the green Save button to save your changes.
Dealing with depreciation
As assets are expensive and used for an extended period of time, allocating the full 
cost of an asset to a single year doesn’t accurately reflect business performance. 
And doing so minimises profit for that year. A more realistic representation is to 
allocate part of the cost of the asset to each year over its life. Depreciation is an 
accounting tool used to allocate the cost of a fixed asset over the life of the asset.

CHAPTER 14  Working with Fixed Assets      363
Processing depreciation
You can process depreciation monthly or elect to process it for several months in 
the run-up to the end of the financial year. Depreciation is automatically allocated 
across each month, rather than as a single lump sum at the end of the year.
To process depreciation, follow these steps:
1.	 Access depreciation by clicking on the menu bar Accounts → Fixed Assets 
and clicking on the Run Depreciation button.
The Run Depreciation window opens. The asset types with depreciable assets 
in the period are listed on the Fixed Asset Register. The date in the From field 
represents the date the assets were last depreciated from, or the date that 
depreciation starts from — whichever is the earliest.
2.	 Enter the end of the financial year in the To field.
You can only run depreciation to the end of a financial year, so if you need it 
run for a longer period, like into the next financial year, you’ll need to repeat 
the process. If you want to run depreciation for a shorter period, just enter the 
date you want to run it to.
If you’re entitled to claim a full year’s depreciation, select Full Depreciation at 
Purchase for the depreciation method. (Check with your accountant if unsure.)
3.	 To process the depreciation, click the green Approve button.
You’re alerted that depreciation is being processed and the date it is current to. 
If you open the Profit and Loss or Income statements for the relevant year, you 
can see the depreciation expense. The Balance Sheet should also reflect the 
accumulated depreciation.
Note: Only users with Adviser status in Xero can allocate and process depreciation.
Rolling back depreciation
If depreciation has been incorrectly recorded, it can be rolled back to the point 
where you started. To process a depreciation rollback, follow these steps:
1.	 Access the Fixed Asset Register from the menu bar by clicking on 
Accounts → Fixed Assets.
2.	 Access the Run Depreciation window by clicking the Run Depreciation 
button in the top-left corner of your screen.
3.	 Click the Rollback Depreciation button.
4.	 At the Rollback To field, select the date depreciation needs to be rolled 
back to from the drop-down list.

364      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
5.	 Click the green Save button.
All depreciation is rolled back to the selected date.
Selling or removing a fixed asset from 
the register
Assets may be sold or disposed of — in which case, they need to be removed from 
the Fixed Asset Register. Note: Assets can only be removed from the register by 
users with Adviser status in Xero.
Deleting a draft asset
Pending assets haven’t been recorded on the Fixed Asset Register. If you initially 
allocate a purchase to an asset account, save it, then decide not to treat it as a fixed 
asset and re-allocate it to an expense account, the purchase stays in limbo in the 
draft fixed asset area. So, it’s just going to sit in pending, until you delete it. Clean 
up your Fixed Asset Register and remove the bogus pending assets. To delete a 
draft asset, follow these steps:
1.	 From the menu bar, click on Accounts → Fixed Assets and select the Draft 
Items tab.
2.	 Select the checkbox beside the entry to be removed and click the red 
Delete button.
The Delete Draft Asset window appears. Click the red Delete button.
This won’t delete purchase bills related to the item.
Setting up default journal accounts for disposing 
of assets
The first step for recording the disposal of an asset involves setting up a journal 
template, which links the default journal lines to the relevant accounts. If you’re 
unsure of the implications of doing this, speak to your accountant.
To set the default journal accounts to prepare for the disposal of a fixed asset from 
the register:
1.	 From the home dashboard, go to Settings → General Settings → Fixed 
Assets and click on the Accounts tab.
Three labels appear: Capital Gain on Disposal, Gain on Disposal, and Loss on 
Disposal. Click on the drop-down option beside the label and link the fields to 

CHAPTER 14  Working with Fixed Assets      365
the fixed asset accounts created earlier in this chapter. These accounts were 
created using the same namesake, so the label Capital Gain on Disposal is 
linked to the account Capital Gain on Disposal.
2.	 Save the default journal accounts by clicking the green Save button.
Selling or disposing of a fixed asset
Assets can be sold or deemed as disposed of for a number of reasons: Technical 
obsolescence, no longer working, they’re damaged or they’re given away to a 
charity. Recognition of the disposal needs to be recorded in Xero. Note: Only users 
with Adviser status in Xero can record the sale or disposal of an asset.
Processing the sale of an asset in Xero is tricky and involves allocating capital gain 
on the sale of the asset, so you may want to refer this process to your tax 
accountant.
To record the sale of a fixed asset, follow these steps:
1.	 From the main menu bar, click on Accounts → Fixed Assets and select the 
Registered tab.
2.	 Select the asset to be sold.
The Fixed Asset detail window opens (see Figure 14-2).
3.	 Click on the Options button in the top-right corner and select Dispose 
from the drop-down menu.
The Dispose window opens (see Figure 14-3).
4.	 Enter the date sold in the Date Disposed field.
5.	 Enter the sale price, exclusive of consumer tax, in the Sale Price field.
If the asset is to be disposed of, enter 0.00 and skip to Step 7.
6.	 Select the suitable revenue account in the Sales Proceeds Account 
drop-down menu.
7.	 Choose whether to allocate part or no depreciation.
Here you have the opportunity to allocate depreciation to the fixed asset up to 
the date of sale for the part of the financial year the fixed asset was owned by 
the business, or no depreciation, as follows:
•	 To allocate no depreciation, select No Depreciation.
•	 To allocate depreciation for part of the financial year, select All 
Depreciation Up To and Including and select the date in the Date field.

CHAPTER 14  Working with Fixed Assets      367
8.	To review the disposal journal created by the sale, click the blue Show 
Summary button, and if everything is in order click the blue Review 
Journals button.
The Review Journal window appears, summarising the history and disposal of 
the asset.
9.	The Loss/Gain on Disposal is allocated to a suitable account.
You define the account when you set up your default journal accounts for 
disposing of assets (refer to the earlier section ‘Setting up default journal 
accounts for disposing of assets’).
10.	Once you’re satisfied, post the journal by clicking the green Post button.
The asset now appears under the Sold & Disposed tab on the Fixed Asset 
Register. Details of any Gains & Losses and Capital Gain recognised appear in 
the Profit and Loss Statement.
Accessing Fixed Asset Reports
I’ve worked with a consulting business in the city for many years. The business 
engages an expensive accounting firm to prepare the company tax reports. One 
year, the tax accountants sent out a detailed depreciation schedule. (In the past, 
the accountants had only sent through a summary, which was simply accepted.) 
Therefore, the owners were interested and surprised when they looked at the 
detailed depreciation schedule. The listed fixed assets included items that the 
business no longer owned or no longer worked, or were part of the fit-out at a 
previous occupancy. Furthermore, identical assets were being depreciated at vari-
ous rates. Grrrr! We reviewed the schedule and worked out that the fixed assets 
were overstated by about $16,000. The owners asked the tax accountant to adjust 
the accounts, which resulted in $16,000 being allocated to the financial year’s 
depreciation expense account, profits being reduced by the said amount and, 
accordingly, company tax also being reduced.
It’s essential you review a detailed Fixed Asset Register and depreciation schedule 
for your business at least annually, to ensure depreciation is accurately allocated. 
By incorporating the Fixed Asset Register into your accounting system, you have 
the opportunity to stay closer to these accounts.
Your fixed assets tie up a significant amount of capital, and accurately maintain-
ing the Fixed Asset Register is essential. Whenever you look at a report, ask your-
self whether the numbers seem reasonable. If not, investigate further!

368      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
Xero offers several reports to view information about your fixed assets:
»
» Depreciation Schedule: The Depreciation Schedule report details actual or 
estimated depreciation allocated to fixed assets via the Fixed Asset Register. 
Depreciation that has been entered by an alternative method, such as a manual 
journal, isn’t shown here — so avoid using manual journals for depreciation!
To access the Depreciation Schedule reports, from the menu bar, click on 
Reports → All Reports → and search for Depreciation Schedule in the search box.
»
» Fixed Asset Reconciliation: The Fixed Asset Reconciliation reports on the 
difference between fixed assets listed on the Fixed Asset Register against the 
fixed assets listed on the Balance Sheet. Ideally, the difference is nil. A 
difference signifies an asset may not be registered or depreciation hasn’t been 
correctly processed through the Fixed Asset Register.
To access the Fixed Asset Reconciliation reports, from the menu bar, click on 
Reports → All Reports → and search for Fixed Asset Reconciliation in the 
search box.
»
» Disposal Schedule: The Disposal Schedule report details fixed assets that 
have been disposed of during the period. Using the report settings customisa-
tion options, you can view details of the fixed asset, like purchase and disposal 
date, cost and sale price, capital gain and loss figures.
The Disposal Schedule is a new report to Xero. To access the Disposal 
Schedule report, from the menu bar, click on Reports → All Reports and 
search for Disposal Schedule in the search box.
»
» Balance Sheet: The Balance Sheet reports on the fixed assets and the 
accumulated depreciation assigned to that fixed asset. Use the customise 
layout options (refer to Chapter 2) to group and subtotal the fixed assets.
To access the Balance Sheet reports, from the menu bar, click on Reports → 
and search for Balance Sheet in the search box.
»
» Profit and Loss: The Profit and Loss reports detail the depreciation expense.
To access the Profit and Loss report, from the menu bar, click on Reports → 
and search for Profit and Loss in the search box.
For guidance on customising reports, refer to Chapter 9.

Working with Multi-
Currency Transactions
I
love freesias so I was over the moon when asked to help a client who imported 
this delicately perfumed flower. Due to space constraints, however, we worked 
next to the flower fridge (brrrr!), and I soon discovered the flowers, while still 
looking lovely, have minimal scent when cold. But onto the accounts. The ­business 
owner seemed to be in a good space — cash flow was positive, the bank balance 
was healthy and the business appeared to be booming. But those bothersome 
books needed updating and ‘Xero Hero’ moi arrived on the scene and started 
­tidying up the accounts for the business. We were both shocked by what was 
uncovered. The business actually only just broke even on what the lovely flowers 
were bought and sold for — all profits were generated from favourable currency 
movements during the year. In a different market environment where the ­currency 
fluctuated in an adverse direction, this flower business would incur significant 
losses.
Expanding a business overseas or selling imported products is an exciting step, 
but you need to fully understand and plan for exchange rate implications. Unex-
pected currency fluctuations can be favourable, or can critically drain your cash 
flow and profit. Just because you’re busy and selling lots of stock, it may not mean 
that your business is profitable!

Setting Up Multi-Currency in Xero
Multi-currency features are only available in the Premium subscription Xero 
packages. If you’re on a smaller plan, you can opt to move up to a larger one. After 
you upgrade, you can choose to downgrade after 30 days. (Downgrading ends the 
currency feeds into Xero, but the existing multi-currency transactions remain in 
the file.) Only the original subscriber for your Xero plan can arrange for you to 
move to a Premium subscription.
So, to enable the multi-currency options and add currencies (covered in this 
­section), you may first need to upgrade.
Upgrading your Xero plan
To upgrade your Xero plan, follow these steps:
1.	 Log in to Xero and go to the MyXero area.
You can also access this area on mobile by typing my.xero.com into your 
browser.
2.	 Click on the blue Upgrade link.
3.	 Select the Premium plan.
4.	 Confirm billing details.
Voila! You are upgraded and can access multi-currency features.
Adding currencies to Xero
Currency is a system of money in general use in a particular country. The official 
currency of many countries is the dollar unit; however, each country’s dollar is 
valued differently. You can’t go to the United States, for example, with one New 
Zealand dollar and purchase one US dollar’s worth of goods. Furthermore, curren-
cies aren’t all in dollar units; they may be in yen, baht, pounds or euros.
Adding currency feeds
Your base or home currency in Xero is set when you create your file (refer to 
­Chapter 2). Once selected, your base currency can’t be changed — if you do need 
to change it, you need to start your Xero accounts all over again. If you want to 
transact in multiple currencies, you need to add them individually to the file.

CHAPTER 15  Working with Multi-Currency Transactions      371
To add currency feeds, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on Settings → General Settings → Currencies and click the Add 
Currency button.
The Add Currency window opens.
2.	 Select a new currency from the drop-down menu.
Keep it tidy and only add the actual currencies needed. The business may 
trade with a variety of countries, for example, but may only transact in the 
American dollar. In this case, just select USD United States Dollar from the list.
3.	 Add the currency by clicking the green Add Currency button.
Defining the currency rate
When you add an additional currency to Xero, you can choose to override the  
XE.com exchange rate:
1.	 Click on Settings → General Settings → Currencies and click on the 
Exchange Rate hyperlink.
The Set Exchange Rate window opens, which shows the current XE.com 
exchange rate, and provides you with the option to define an exchange rate.
2.	 Enter the desired exchange rate.
3.	 Click on the blue hyperlink labelled Set Start & End Dates, and from the 
drop-down date options select the dates the exchange rate should start 
and should finish.
4.	 Select the green Save button.
The defined exchange rate applies to all new transactions for the period.
Changing the exchange rate doesn’t update the rate applied to existing 
transactions.
Setting up multi-currency contacts
The default currency that contacts transact in is defined in their settings and can 
be overridden for individual transactions. Therefore, a single contact can transact 
in multiple different currencies. This can keep your contact list very neat — but 
keep in mind that some reports, such as the Aged reports, don’t split out the dif-
ferent currencies owed for a single contact. If you want this information, you need 
to create a contact associated with each currency.

372      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
To allocate a default foreign currency to a contact card, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on Contacts → All Contacts, locate the client and click Edit.
2.	 Select from the Default Currency drop-down menu.
3.	 Click the green Save button.
Processing Multi-Currency  
Transactions in Xero
If your business has agreed to sell goods in a foreign currency, an invoice is raised 
in the foreign currency, which has implications for tax rates and exchange rates.  
I cover these implications in the following sections, as well as creating an invoice 
in a foreign currency, receiving part payment against this invoice and purchasing 
in a foreign currency. Note: You’re unable to assign a default currency to an inven-
tory item, only to invoices.
Understanding tax rates
To assist in processing and interpreting any tax implications, many clients I’ve 
worked with apply separate tax rates for individual currency sales and purchases. 
This is not necessary but may help you clearly identify what rates were applied.
For example, tax rates for US$ and NZ$ transactions could be set up with the 
­criteria shown in Table 15-1 (the initial file created will have 0 per cent in the % 
column).

CHAPTER 15  Working with Multi-Currency Transactions      373
Working with foreign currency  
exchange rates
Foreign currency exchange rates (or forex rates) represent the relationship 
between two different currencies. For example, if the Australian dollar is trading 
at 0.765 to the US dollar (AUD/USD 0.765), a single Australian dollar is only worth 
US$0.765. (Taking that a step further, in this case you need AU$1.31 to buy US$1.)
Foreign currency exchange rates feed into Xero via a currency translation service 
known as XE.com, updated every hour. Once connected, historical exchange rates 
are available. Of course, the rate from XE.com, the rate published by financial 
institutions and the rate actually applied to the transaction may vary, so the 
XE.com rate can be overridden.
Creating a foreign currency invoice
In this section, I cover creating a new invoice in a foreign currency, using the 
example of a sale for US$1,000.
To create an invoice in US dollars, follow these steps:
1.	 Create the Sales Invoice.
Refer to Chapter 6 for more on creating invoices. In this example, you would 
enter the sales amount as $1,000.
2.	 Enter the Invoice Date.
3.	 Enter the Invoice Due Date field.
Entering +1M in this field means the Invoice Due Date field should autofill with 
a date one month after the Invoice Date. Refer to Chapter 5 for guidance on 
setting up default due date information.
4.	 Click on the Currency field and select from the drop-down menu.
Only currencies already set up are available in the drop-down menu; however, 
you can add additional currencies by clicking the + Add Currency . . . option and 
select the desired currency from the Select a Currency drop-down menu. Click 
the green Add Currency button and the currency is added to the invoice.
For this example, you’d select USD United States Dollars. Beside the currency 
field, the XE.com exchange rate as per the invoice date appears. For example, 
‘1 AUD = 0.765 USD (14 Aug 2016)’. Note: If the invoice date changes, the 
exchange rate automatically updates.
Selecting US dollars means USD is clearly stated in the Amount column and 
beside the total figure.

374      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
5.	 Click the green OK button.
6.	 Complete the remaining sections of the invoice, and select the tax rate.
In this example, you’d choose $US Export (refer to Table 15-1).
7.	 Click the green Save button.
At the bottom of the invoice is information about the foreign currency transaction 
translated into your base currency:
»
» Realised
»
» Unrealised
»
» Net
Beside those numbers are tiny green (good) and red (negative) movement indica-
tors, so you can quickly see if the exchange rate changes have had a favourable 
effect on the transaction. (See the following section for more.)
Currency gain or loss
When the original date of a foreign currency transaction is different to the settle-
ment date, the movement in the exchange rate between the two dates results in a 
currency gain or loss. If the transaction hasn’t yet been settled, it’s defined as an 
unrealised currency gain or loss and fluctuates in line with the current exchange 
rate feed. Once the transaction has been finalised, the currency gain or loss is 
realised and no longer fluctuates. Both realised and unrealised currency gains or 
losses are reported in the Profit and Loss Statement as an operating expense called 
Foreign Currency Gains and Losses.
As long as no payment is received against this invoice, the unrealised and net 
amount detailed at the bottom of the invoice remain the same. If part payment is 
received against the invoice, the related currency gain or loss is realised, and 
summing the realised and unrealised amounts equals the net amount. Once full 
payment is received, finalising the transaction, the currency gain or loss is realised 
and the realised amount equals the net amount.
The Balance Sheet in Xero reflects the base currency dollar value of the outstand-
ing amount in the Accounts Receivable account. This fluctuates depending on the 
current exchange rate. The Balance Sheet also includes a notation that details 
rates and the date used to convert the balance into your base currency dollar.
The Profit and Loss Statement reflects the Unrealised Currency Gain account, split 
out across the periods that it occurs. A loss is reflected as a positive amount, and 
a gain is reflected as a negative amount.

CHAPTER 15  Working with Multi-Currency Transactions      375
Manually changing invoice exchange rates
Most Xero users accept the default exchange rate provided by XE.com — and this 
is the simplest option! However, some tax accountants I work with prefer to use 
the Australian Taxation Office average foreign exchange rates published monthly, 
so the invoice exchange rate needs to be manually changed every time. Check with 
your tax accountant and the regulations of your jurisdiction about the exchange 
rates to use in your business. It’s quicker to opt for XE.com’s default exchange 
rate; however, if you want to override the exchange rate, here’s how to do it:
1.	 When creating a foreign currency invoice, override the suggested 
exchange rate (if required) by clicking on the blue Exchange Rates link 
beside the Currency field.
The Set Exchange Rate window (see Figure 15-1) opens, with details of the  
XE.com exchange rate provided.
2.	 To override the XE.com exchange rate for this specific transaction, select 
the option below the XE.com rate and enter the desired exchange rate.
You then also have the option to apply the edited rate to all new transactions 
on the applicable date.
Once payment has been applied, the currency and exchange rate can’t be 
changed.
Receiving part payment against the sale
In some cases, you may receive a deposit, or part payment, against a foreign 
­currency invoice. For example, and following the example in previous sections of 
a sale for US$1,000, say you receive a US$500 part payment against this sale.
FIGURE 15-1: 
The Set Exchange 
Rate window. 
Source: Xero 2016

376      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
To process a deposit, follow these steps:
1.	 Record a partial payment against the invoice by entering the payment in 
the Amount Paid field.
In this example, you’d enter US$500 in this field.
Non-base currency invoices can be paid in either the invoice currency or the 
base currency of your bank account, but you can’t receipt in other currencies. 
In this example, if the Xero file was set up in NZ dollars, payment against the 
invoice could be received in NZ dollars or US dollars, but no other currency.
2.	 Enter the invoice due date in the Date Paid field.
3.	 Select the bank the payment was deposited into from the drop-down list.
4.	 Enter the applicable exchange rate, if required.
You need to include the applicable exchange rate if the money is receipted into 
a non-US dollar account.
Aa an alternative to the preceding steps, you can record a part payment against a 
foreign currency invoice by reconciling the payment via the bank statement. Just 
make sure you uncheck the Show Base Currency Items Only option while reconcil-
ing. Refer to Chapter 8 for more guidance.
The Balance Sheet in Xero reflects the receipt of payment in the respective bank 
account and the remaining outstanding amount in the Accounts Receivable 
account.
The Profit and Loss now reflects three currency accounts:
»
» Bank Revaluations
»
» Realised Currency Gains
»
» Unrealised Currency Gains
If you don’t override the day’s exchange rate and compare against the Profit and 
Loss Statement before and after applying the payment, the net effect is the same. 
However, once the payment is made, a partial currency gain or loss is realised in 
the Realised Currency Gains account.
The Bank Revaluations account reflects the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on 
the balance(s) of foreign currency bank account(s). Even if no transactions were 
recorded against the foreign currency bank account(s), if the exchange rate 
moved, the value of foreign currency bank account(s) is readjusted in the Balance 
Sheet, and the Bank Revaluations in the Profit and Loss Statement would reflect 
the movement every month.

CHAPTER 15  Working with Multi-Currency Transactions      377
Receiving the payment directly into a base currency dollar account has no effect 
on the Bank Revaluation account.
Once payment has been fully received against an invoice, no unrealised gains are 
recorded. If the transaction occurred over a period of time, any unrealised gains 
recorded in earlier periods are netted off to a balance of zero once the transaction 
is finalised.
Transferring between foreign and  
base currency bank accounts
To transfer money between a foreign bank account to your base currency bank 
account, follow these steps:
1.	From the dashboard, locate the bank account the unreconciled money 
transfer transaction belongs to and click on the blue Reconcile Items 
button.
Access this transaction from the dashboard (refer to Chapter 8 for more).
2.	Create a match for the money transfer by clicking on the Transfer tab on 
the left.
3.	From the drop-down menu, select the other bank account.
If the default currencies of the accounts are different, a Currency Conversion 
panel opens below the transaction (see Figure 15-2).
4.	Enter the amount as it appears in the base currency statement in the 
Amount field.
The exchange rate automatically adjusts. Entering the transaction this way is so 
simple, because you enter the actual amounts as they appear on the state-
ments, and leave it to Xero to do the hard exchange rate calculations. However, 
you should still check that the exchange rate appears correct.
Unfortunately, when currency is converted, the banks stick their hands out and 
charge a fee. The associated fee of the originating bank can be entered in the 
Include Bank Fees panel.
5.	Enter the bank account the bank fees are being charged through in the 
To field.
6.	Enter text in the description field.
For example, you could enter Currency conversion charges here.
7.	Select the required account from the drop-down Accounts list.

378      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
8.	Select the appropriate tax rate for bank charges in the Tax Rate drop- 
down list.
To identify foreign currency transaction expenses, using the $US Export tax 
rate makes sense.
9.	Enter the bank charges in the Amount field.
The bank fee of the recipient bank is added separately because this panel 
doesn’t allow for alternative currencies in the amount field.
10.	To record the transfer, click the green Reconcile button.
Purchasing in a foreign currency
The processes undertaken to record purchases in a foreign currency mirror the 
Sales processes. Just use the import tax rate to aid in identifying any purchases 
made. (Refer to the section ‘Creating a foreign currency invoice’, earlier in this 
chapter, for more information.)
Global custom bills can be tricky transactions to process. The invoice may be 
entirely for consumer tax — unlike normal transactions that have standard rates 
applied to them.
To process a customs bill, follow these steps:
1.	 Process the bill.
Refer to Chapter 7 for more information on processing purchases.
2.	 Don’t worry about multi-currency transactions.
The customs bill is typically paid in the business’s base currency, so multi-­ 
currency isn’t an issue.

CHAPTER 15  Working with Multi-Currency Transactions      379
3.	 Select the consumer tax account in the Account field.
Yes — this will be allocated directly to consumer tax.
4.	 Select Consumer Tax on Imports in the Tax Rate field.
5.	 Allocate the full consumer tax amount to the transaction line.
Be careful not to get other small charges like admin mixed up in this 
­transaction.
6.	 Process the bill as per normal.
The consumer tax should appear on the consumer tax report. When the actual 
payment for the goods purchased is processed, make sure the tax code allocated 
excludes this payment entirely from the consumer tax report.
If you’re aware that the business will have an obligation to pay a debt in a differ-
ent currency at a future date, you can minimise the risk of currency fluctuation by 
purchasing a forward contract — an agreement whereby you purchase the foreign 
currency at a pre-agreed future rate. Essentially, you’re purchasing a commit-
ment to a future-dated transaction. You may opt not to record the obligation until 
the contract matures. Once the contract has matured, you record the exchange 
rate and purchase transaction as described in Chapter 7. Alternatively, if you want 
to record the commitment in Xero, set up a current asset account named The right 
to receive foreign currency. Then, record a bill in the foreign currency, as at the date 
of the contract, assigning the obligation to the new asset account. When it’s time 
to pay the debt, you can then void the bill that recognises the forward contract and 
record the transaction as normal.
Refer to Chapter 7 for more information on processing purchases.
Conversion Balances and  
Multi-Currency Bank Accounts
If you had an existing multi-currency bank account when your Xero account was 
created, you need to enter the account’s conversion balance. However, you need to 
add the multi-currency bank account to the data file before you can add a conver-
sion balance (refer to Chapter 2 for more on setting up accounts).

380      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
After adding the multi-currency bank account, to enter a multi-currency conver-
sion balance follow these steps:
1.	 From the menu bar go to Settings → General settings → Conversion 
Balances.
2.	 To add the multi-currency bank account, click the Add a New Line button 
and select the multi-currency bank account.
A nil balance appears as a blue link.
3.	 Click on the balance of the multi-currency account, and enter the 
originating currency amount and the exchange rate as at conversion 
date.
The base currency amount can’t be edited. To achieve the correct base 
currency amount, edit the originating currency amount or the exchange rate.
4.	 To accept the balance, click the green OK button.
Viewing Reports in Foreign Currency
Foreign currency can quickly become complicated, and many implications with 
regards to tax, currency and exchange rates are involved. As multi-currency has 
been built into the core engine of Xero, it calculates real-time gains and losses on 
the fly. Work closely with your accountant or adviser to understand the effect for-
eign currency has on your business reports.
From the reports available within Xero, one report specifically highlights how 
currency fluctuations are affecting foreign currency transactions. This is the For-
eign Currency Gains and Losses report.
To access the Foreign Currency Gains and Losses report from the menu bar, go to 
Reports → All Reports → Foreign Currency Gains and Losses. This brings up the 
report (see Figure  15-3). The amounts receivable and payable are split out by 
currency.
Other reports affected by an unpaid foreign currency transaction, such as the Bal-
ance Sheet, include within them the foreign currency transaction translated as per 
the exchange rate provided by XE.com.
To access the Aged Payables report from the menu bar, click Reports → Aged Pay-
ables. At the bottom of the report are notation references detailing the exchange 
rate applied to the transaction.

CHAPTER 15  Working with Multi-Currency Transactions      381
When the multi-currency feature is utilised in Xero, Bank Revaluations, Realised 
Currency Gains and Unrealised Currency Gains accounts are automatically cre-
ated. You can’t post directly to these accounts, nor can you find them in your chart 
of accounts. They are shown in the Profit and Loss report, and grouping them 
together makes viewing them easier (refer to Chapter  9 for more on grouping 
items).

Xero Online Network
I
have a friend who is a simultaneous Japanese-to-English translator. Many 
people can translate languages, but only a rare few can do it simultaneously. As 
Barack Obama speaks to the United Nations audience, for example, his English 
words are translated into the world’s different languages by simultaneous trans-
lators. The non-English audience wear headphones and hear Obama’s translated 
words in real-time, and the whole audience feels the emotion of the speech and 
reacts together.
Xero networks operate in a similar manner: Information can flow seamlessly from 
one solution to another. This allows you to view completed jobs from a job man-
agement solution translated into Xero sales invoices (refer to Chapter 6 for more 
on sales invoices), see Xero financial data translated into colourful graphs in a 
reporting solution (refer to Chapter 9) or integrate with a robust inventory solu-
tion for managing stock (refer to Chapter 13). Double handling of data doesn’t 
occur, and crosschecking between systems isn’t necessary — minimising errors 
and saving time. Utilising networks can transform your business’s ability to man-
age operations and interpret management and financial reports — in other words, 
it could be a game changer! Network connections can be achieved through import-
ing data, application programming interface (API) technology, and general and 
specific connectors.
Chapter 16

384      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
In this chapter, I explain how the Xero to Xero network works, and share what you 
need to know about API technology. I explore the different types of apps (connec-
tors and add-on solutions) and highlight what to consider when deciding on a 
solution. To exploit and extract full value from integrated systems, you need to 
ensure they’re set up correctly and stay curious about what’s possible  — this 
chapter points you in the right direction.
The apps available to work with Xero are constantly changing. For a current 
list  of  what’s available in the specific area you require, see www.xero.com/
marketplace/s/app-functions.
Working with Xero to Xero Networks
Xero files can be connected with other Xero files utilising a network key. My web 
designer uses Xero, for example, and so she sent me a Xero network invite so our 
Xero files could connect. When she sends me an invoice, she opts to simply send 
it via the Xero network. I’m notified via email that I received a draft bill from my 
web designer and simultaneously a draft bill automatically appears in my Xero. 
I still need to allocate an account and consumer tax code to the bill and approve it, 
but utilising Xero to Xero connection minimises data entry, improves cash flow, 
and eliminates the excuse that the dog ate the bill! (Refer to Chapter 5 for guid-
ance on sending a network invite, Chapter 6 for more on emailing invoices, and 
Chapter  7 for processing and coding draft bills.) Note: The PDF of the invoice 
doesn’t automatically import. If you want it stored with the transaction, you need 
to manually add it; refer to Chapter 7 to find out how to add supporting documents 
to bills.
I’ve seen the Xero to Xero connection work particularly well with associated busi-
nesses that do interrelated (and sometimes confusing!) transactions. For exam-
ple, I work with a client who runs two businesses  — one business hires out 
packaging containers, and the other business ships freight. The freight business 
frequently hires the packaging containers, so the hiring business sends draft sales 
invoices through the Xero to Xero network to the freight business. The freight 
business approves the sales invoices and payment against the invoices can be 
made by cash, as in a normal business relationship, or offset by intercompany 
loans, as is typical for interrelated businesses. Refer to Chapter 2 for guidance on 
enabling payments against loan accounts.

CHAPTER 16  Xero Online Network      385
Understanding the Benefits  
and Risks of Add-On Solutions
Implementing business management solutions is an important decision and a 
major investment for a business, so make sure you pick the right solution and get 
it set up properly. The following sections cover some aspects you should consider 
before you commit to an add-on solution.
Ascertaining implementation costs
When selecting a solution, ascertain the initial implementation and ongoing costs. 
Sometimes people say to me, ‘I’m not investing $25 a month in this — I can do it 
myself.’ However, as a person, your one natural resource restriction is time — you 
can’t create more time for yourself. If you value your time at, say, $50 per hour, 
and investing $25 a month in a solution frees up 30 minutes of your time in the 
month, it’s a good investment. You’ve an extra 30 minutes to work on other areas 
of the business — or perhaps run sand between your toes.
GETTING UNDER THE HOOD: 
UNDERSTANDING API
Application programming interface (API) is technology that acts like a key, unlocking dif-
ferent software solutions and allowing them to talk with other software solutions. API is 
a protocol that enables fields to be matched and data to flow from one system to 
another system, opening up real-time communication channels.
Xero has a published API — meaning other software developers can look at the API and 
match their software solution to it. As Xero continues to evolve, accessibility to areas of 
the API continues to expand — so if you couldn’t do something yesterday, you may be 
able to do it today! Some add-on software solutions that link in with Xero are created to 
directly sync with Xero; other solutions are more generic in nature, and you use a con-
nector to help them talk, match fields and click together (a bit like building blocks). Some 
developers can also create customised software solutions tailored to meet specific busi-
ness requirements.
Unless you’re a developer, you don’t need to worry about how API technology works — 
you simply need to understand what it’s capable of. And the possibilities are endless. 
Implementing integrated Xero solutions unleashes the power of intelligent business 
­systems, including data mining capabilities and predictive analysis. Ultimately, this 
means small businesses can compete with the big boys!

386      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
When comparing costs across options, also identify the time and money saved 
from investing in a solution.
Working out if the solution is right for you
Look beyond the marketing claims and assess if the solution actually does what 
you need it to do. Yes, it may suggest it will make your life easier — but how will 
it do this?
Talk to the solution provider, run through demonstrations that illustrate how the 
solution works, test your own work flows upon it, and read reviews from other 
users.
Don’t assume that the solution is tax compliant — I’ve found out the hard way 
that some of them aren’t, and therefore they require a huge amount of manual 
input to ensure your final figures are accurate and won’t get you into hot water 
with your tax authority. This extra and unexpected work can detract from savings 
made in other areas.
Looking at longevity
You need to check the longevity of both the product and its provider. For example, 
check whether additional users can access the product if your business grows. 
Likewise, check whether downsizing with the product is practical if your business 
downsizes.
If the business is likely to grow — be it with more employees, product offerings, 
transactions or locations — ascertain if the solution is able to scale up and per-
haps across different branches. Identify limitations and assess if workarounds are 
acceptable. Keep in mind, of course, that technology is evolving so quickly that 
restrictions can dissipate overnight — meaning today’s issue may be non-­existent 
tomorrow.
You may be satisfied with the longevity of the product and it being able to provide 
for your future needs, but what about the longevity of the provider? The provider 
may look great today but try to get an idea of their future plans. If Xero updates are 
required in the add-on solution, will the provider be around to implement them? 
Check the version release — if the release is ‘1.0’ (or similar), they’ve only released 
one version and, if you try it, you may be the guinea pig testing the solution in a 
live environment! Look for a solution that has gone through a few version releases.
Do an online search using the solution’s name and read feedback about them in 
forums. Do they appear to be responsive to their existing customers?

CHAPTER 16  Xero Online Network      387
Checking response times
Check out the support options the add-on solution provider offers — for example, 
telephone, live chat, email or an account manager. Don’t confuse sales support 
with ongoing technical support — the sales areas may operate totally separately 
to the support area, once you’re committed to the product. Test the provider out 
by sending in a technical question via the support area and see what the response 
is like.
Understanding intellectual  
property security
Determine the controls in place over entering, accessing, editing and extracting 
information from the solution. You want to ensure a disgruntled employee can’t 
extract customer information, and erase business data in one fell swoop.
Making Use of Online Cloud  
Integration Specialists
If you don’t want to undertake an add-on implementation on your own, online 
specialists can help your business quickly get up and running with integrated 
add-on solutions. These experts can assist with:
»
» Answering questions
»
» Providing feasibility studies
»
» Defining work flow processes
»
» Field mapping
»
» Training and ongoing support
»
» Turnkey implementation
Many of the websites for specific add-on solutions can point you in the direction 
of experts on their product — such as their own in-house gurus, bookkeepers, 
add-on partners and advisers. Your existing Xero advisory team may be able to 
help you with the implementation, but using an expert in a particular product may 
be faster and cheaper! Find a Xero Cloud Integrator at www.xero.com/advisors/
list/cloud-integrators/.

388      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
Getting a Feel for Available Solutions
Xero has an approved list of add-on solution ‘partners’ that have demonstrated 
their product integrates with Xero, and they have appropriate end-user documen-
tation. Other products are also available that can communicate with Xero — but 
these haven’t gone through the process of being listed as add-on solution 
partners.
You may hear the ubergeeks using the terms horizontal and vertical when referenc-
ing add-ons. A horizontal add-on works across all industries or businesses. 
Examples of horizontal add-ons include Debtor Daddy, which actively chases 
accounts receivable; Quotient, which enables businesses to generate quotes; and 
Spotlight Reports, which provides insightful reporting to businesses. A vertical 
add-on specialises in niche industries — for example, Coreplus, which is health 
practice management software, or Deputy, which manages rosters and timesheets. 
Of course, it’s not always that simple, and some solutions may be a little bit 
­horizontal and a little vertical — but you get the general gist of how these terms 
are used!
In this chapter, I cover various apps from the Xero marketplace; however, I’m not 
endorsing any particular solution. The purpose is to open your mind to the 
­possibility of what features are available, and how you could use them in your own 
business to improve productivity.
The following sections look at solutions that have been listed as add-on solution 
partners, grouped by function.
Connectors
General and specific connectors are available. A general connector lets you connect 
numerous applications to Xero through one device. Data synchronises automati-
cally across business systems, automating work flow, minimising time-consuming 
data entry and reducing mistakes — if you’ve set it up correctly!
I’ve found some connected systems may have the required fields, but a defined 
link hasn’t been built into the connection — meaning the data can’t flow from one 
solution to the other. You need to identify what information you actually want to 
be synchronised and check if it’s possible with the solution provider.
A general connector like OneSaas or Zapier enables integration across multiple 
solutions — so, for example, a client can purchase products via eBay, which auto-
matically updates Batchbooks CRM, and feeds invoicing and customer data into 
Xero. This automation means the business operator doesn’t need to manually 

CHAPTER 16  Xero Online Network      389
recreate every sale. These one-way connectors are typically activated by a trigger, 
such as someone buying a ticket on the ticket management site Eventbrite. The 
ticket’s sales data is pushed across into Xero.
Updates to the original transaction, such as changes to your contact details, may 
not result in a trigger, so this data then needs to be manually updated in Xero. In 
many cases, the price of a connector that pushes the data across is significantly 
cheaper than the price of a connector that syncs the data in both directions, so you 
may need to weigh up the cost against the additional work that may be required.
A specific connector links Xero to a single solution. For instance, ACT! is a popular 
CRM (see following section). ACT! Link by Xact Software is software linking the 
two solutions. Or another available option is RM Importer, a product allowing a 
retail store to remain with MYOB Retail Manager for their existing POS system, 
but change their accounting system from MYOB AccountRight to Xero.
With all connectors, you typically have the option of hourly or daily syncs. The 
syncs depend on matching the fields of data — for instance, if you want to transfer 
information about inventory, item fields need to be available to link both 
solutions.
The capabilities of the general connectors are truly astonishing  — visit their 
­websites to see all the different solutions they work with.
CRMs
A customer resource management (CRM) system centralises customer 
­information  — essentially, it’s a customer-focused knowledge base. These 
­systems allow the business to understand and serve clients efficiently and 
­effectively — hopefully maximising profits!
In a business, client information can be sourced from contact history, sales track-
ing, marketing result, customer profiles and — ta da! — accounting software.
The business benefits of a CRM include the following:
»
» Assist in preparing responses to common queries
»
» Avoid customers falling through the cracks
»
» Ensure staff know the complete history between the business and the client
»
» Manage opportunities in the pipeline
»
» Measure lead to customer conversion and response time

390      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
Xero has an inbuilt link via its Smart Lists function to the online marketing com-
pany Constant Contact. Refer to Chapter 5 for an overview of how this integration 
works.
Debtor tracking
A debtor tracking solution reviews existing accounts receivable data and, from 
that insight, can produce visuals and charts; automatically follow up on receiv-
ables via email, SMS or phone; or apply fees to outstanding invoices. These solu-
tions rely on accounts being reconciled on a timely basis, and combined with 
online invoicing have been proven to reduce debtor days, in turn improving cash 
flow. Following up on outstanding invoices is never a pleasant task; an automated 
solution is much less confronting and can be a massive time-saver.
The business benefits of a debtor tracking solution include the following:
»
» Eliminate repetitive administrative tasks around debt collection
»
» Improve cash flowing into the business
»
» Reduce the time and cost involved in collecting debts
»
» Vanquish awkward conversations with customers
e-commerce
The term e-commerce (or electronic commerce) refers to the selling of products or 
services over the internet, with e-commerce generally revolving around a shop on 
a website.
An online shop on a website typically creates invoices when orders are received, 
and sends the invoices to customers in real-time. Customer information can then 
be populated or updated in Xero from the transactions. Solutions are also available 
for specific industries, such as Checkfront, which offers a hosted booking system 
solution.
The business benefits of integrating e-commerce with Xero include
»
» A mobile store open and accessible 24/7
»
» Improved cash flow management, and updated cash flow information
»
» Reduced data entry, because invoices, orders and payments are linked 
together — making reconciliations a breeze

CHAPTER 16  Xero Online Network      391
Bills and expenses
Typically, the bills and expenses add-on solutions work like this: You send receipts 
in, they’re scanned, and data is extracted and coded. The coding may include cod-
ing to your Chart of Accounts, or tracking codes and consumer tax. The data and 
codes are then imported into Xero. If you have lots of receipts, using these solu-
tions minimises data entry and reduces paper storage!
Also, a solution like Receipt Bank puts the power of this technology into the palm 
of your hand. While at the local coffee house, you can upload images of business 
receipts to your iPhone, submit them for processing, and they’re coded and ready 
to be published into Xero by the time you’re back at the office.
Inventory
Xero only offers a simple inventory management solution, so if you have advanced 
inventory management requirements, you definitely need to look at one of the 
available add-on solutions. Essentially, an inventory management solution can 
offer some or all of the following features:
»
» Assist with stocktakes, including count sheets, and the ability to update stock 
and adjust stock
»
» Scan bar codes
»
» Maintain a bill of materials, like a recipe for combining components to create 
a new inventory item
»
» Maintain detailed records of inventory, including restocking levels
»
» Manage all aspects of the purchasing functions, including suppliers, 
­shipments, consignment stock and returns
»
» Create multiple price tiers, allowing you to sell products at different prices to 
different clients
»
» Record periodic and/or perpetual inventory
»
» Sell items without reducing the balance of the item (suitable for non-­ 
diminishing products)
»
» Group products, allowing you to categorise products by group
»
» Assess stock value, including average cost stock valuation
»
» Track inventory’s location, from bins through to multiple locations
»
» Transfer stock between warehouses

392      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
Inventory add-ons’ integration with Xero should update the Balance Sheet inven-
tory accounts, and cost of goods sold on the Profit and Loss report. If just starting 
out, TradeGecko has an innovative on-boarding training platform, which quickly 
outlines all the inventory basics you need to know and should expect from within 
an inventory solution.
In addition to some of the features mentioned in the preceding list, simPRO has 
up-to-date catalogues and pricelists for major wholesale suppliers available 
through their system, which can save you time and help you minimise costs. Star-
Ship prints shipping labels, allowing the business to track and trace shipments.
Job tracking
Job management software tracks the income and expenses related to a single job, 
so the job profit or loss can be accurately identified and the invoicing information 
can be transferred to Xero for timely billing. It includes the creation of the job, 
efficient dispatch to available staff and locations, and management and progress 
updates. A clear understanding of work in progress (WIP) means your business 
can communicate progress to clients and assign resources as necessary. Detailed 
monitoring of the financial performance of jobs also helps you develop accurate 
quotes for future work.
Several time-tracking, inventory and CRM solutions include robust job costing and 
job management features. A number of add-on job tracking solutions link with Xero.
Payments
An online payment gateway lets your business accept credit card payments against 
sales invoices. This facilitates receipting international currency without the need 
to open foreign bank accounts, and enables quick and easy transaction reconcili-
ations within Xero. The payment services that Xero currently has integration with 
include Authorize.Net, Braintree, DPS, eWAY, GoCardless, PayPal and Stripe. Xero 
also offers a custom URL option, which can be used for payment services that 
don’t require customers to log in to make payment. Solutions like PayPal and 
eWAY, for example, can automate recurring transactions and connect to online 
shopping carts. Solutions such as Chargify, uCollect and Ezidebit can actively col-
lect payments from customers (when you have a prior agreement in place). You 
can find more information here: https://help.xero.com/PaymentServices.
Documents
Using cloud document management, you can manage your files, emails and client 
documents, and, to varying degrees, you may also be able to connect to Microsoft 

CHAPTER 16  Xero Online Network      393
Office 365 or Gmail, and connect with Xero and other solutions from the Xero 
marketplace. For example, you may use a solution like SuiteFiles, which integrates 
Xero, Xero Practice Manager and Microsoft Office, so data can be integrated, 
staff can work on the same documents, and files are centrally located and can be 
found fast.
Some cloud document management systems have the ability to extract data from 
your business platform and populate standardised forms, which can be used to 
collect information and push the data back into Xero. So, you can use a solution 
like Formitize to generate a different style of invoice from the ones found in Xero. 
As it’s linked to Xero, it can pull in your Contact and Items details, and once 
the invoice has been created it pushes the relevant accounting information back 
into Xero.
Payroll
A payroll solution can manage your business’s full payroll function, including 
maintaining detailed employee records, timesheets, processing pay runs, moni-
toring payroll entitlements, and providing pay slips and any reporting necessary 
in your jurisdiction.
For most users, Xero has a limited payroll function, so an add-on solution may be 
required. (Australian users can access an inbuilt payroll system that should be 
sufficient for many user’s payroll requirements  — see www.dummies.com/go/
xerofd3e for more information. Users based in the United States may also have 
inbuilt payroll functionality  — check with your Xero advisory team for more 
information.)
Payroll is a complex area governed by many rules and regulations. You need to 
identify a payroll management system compliant to the territory your business 
operates in. PaymentEvolution provides a complete Canadian payroll solution, for 
example, while SimplePay offers a South African–specific solution.
A number of add-on payroll solutions link with Xero, specific to the country you 
do business in.
Point of sale
A point of sale (POS) solution streamlines the way you record sales in a retail 
management environment. Typically, the solution syncs customer and supplier 
records and sales, and payment records, between the solution and Xero. It works 
with normal retail tools, such as barcoders, scanners, cash drawers and receipt 
printers, and allows for customisation of customer receipts and other documents. 

394      PART 4  Getting the Most Out of Xero
Additional features may include customer loyalty rewards tracking, stock man-
agement and sales reports.
Financial services
By accessing your business data, financial service providers can assess and offer 
you a line of credit, access to working capital, invoice financing or other financial 
solutions to help you grow your business.
Time tracking
A time management system can tie into timesheets, calendars, rostering and 
appointment scheduling, and online booking capability. The system enables 
employees to track their time against jobs, clients and accounts, and can empower 
managers to monitor project workflow and allocate employees to complete set 
tasks within projects. A time management system may include payroll and job 
costing within the solution, or lend itself to seamless integration. Contacts and 
transactions can by synced across systems.
A graphic design business, for example, could use a time management system like 
MinuteDock to allocate tasks to graphic designers, and the designers could log or 
dock time spent on tasks. This helps managers budget and track expenses for the 
project. MinuteDock also includes the option of enabling clients to view time being 
billed to their project. The business is then able to easily collate and push detailed 
invoices across into Xero.
Xero has its own solution, WorkflowMax, which offers quotes, time sheets and job 
management invoicing. It is utilised by businesses that want a deeper control over 
their professional services businesses.
Reporting
Add-on reporting tools dissect, interpret and translate real-time Xero informa-
tion into easily digestible formats, including graphs, charts and snapshots. These 
business intelligence tools aid with strategic planning and help you monitor 
financial metrics, key performance indicators (KPIs) and benchmarking  —  
­essentially, they allow you to maintain a general scorecard for business goals.
Visual data in the form of beautifully coloured charts helps any non-financial 
people involved in the business understand their own financial situation, and 
assists them with making informed business decisions and proactively dealing 
with their future. As well as financial data, you can also analyse non-financial 
data and social media data.

CHAPTER 16  Xero Online Network      395
Solutions are also available for specific areas or industries. The reporting tool 
Calxa, for example, enables the creation of budgets and cash flow forecasts 
­particularly useful for not-for-profit board reporting. FathomHQ facilitates inte-
gration with numerous Xero files, enabling analysis, alerts and benchmarking 
across the files — useful for a franchisor, for example, comparing the perfor-
mance of different franchisees.
Looking at Custom Integration
If none of the available solutions meet your business’s needs, you can also look at 
the custom integration option  — that is, where you hire someone to design a 
solution for your specific requirements. But before you explore custom integra-
tion, take a step back and reflect on what the business is doing. Can your processes 
be simplified and adapted to an existing solution? Custom integration can be 
expensive and, with every upgrade of Xero, it may need to be adapted as well. Of 
course, after careful consideration, you may decide a custom solution perfectly 
suits what you require and will save you money and time!
To ensure a successful custom integration, you need to clearly detail what opera-
tional performance you want and any assumptions you may have for the solution. 
Invest the time to explore and define your requirements up-front. What appears 
to the layperson as a minor change may in fact require a major re-write by the 
solution provider, which bumps up costs!

Ten (Plus One!) Tips 
for Long-Term Success 
with Xero
I
n this chapter, I highlight practices that you should adopt when using Xero to 
improve your productivity and ensure ongoing success. I’m never dictatorial in 
how you should or shouldn’t run your business — but I do know that utilising 
the factors outlined in this chapter can help you free up your time so you can focus 
on more important aspects of your business, like business and strategy 
­development. And incorporating the information produced can then assist you in 
making decisions.

Embrace the Cloud
Once you’re set up on Xero, you can access it anywhere you can access the 
­internet. So take a few moments and install the Xero app on your mobile devices. 
Once you’ve set up the Xero app, you can send out sales invoices onsite, engage a 
mobile work force, reconcile while travelling abroad or email contacts while 
catching a bus. Free yourself from your office desk and get comfortable using Xero 
remotely while waiting for a coffee at your local café.
Make Use of Networking Technology
Take the time to step back from Xero and from your business. Monitor your busi-
ness processes and identify what’s consuming time and whether it can be replaced 
through networking technology. Utilising the Xero to Xero network and add-on 
solutions can dramatically increase productivity if doing so can replace manual 
processes. An add-on Xero solution like Receipt Bank, for example, extracts infor-
mation from receipts and bills, securely stores scanned copies of the document, 
and seamlessly populates Accounts Payable, Spend Money and Expense modules 
within Xero. Refer to Chapter 16 for the different add-on possibilities available.
Export Data to Create Graphs
A lot of data in Xero can be exported into Google Docs or an Excel spreadsheet. 
Once you have it in Excel, you can utilise the features of spreadsheets; data can be 
customised and graphs created. This means you can present information in a 
user-friendly manner  — because, of course, preparing awesome, accurate and 
timely data is pointless if no-one’s looking at it!
Many non-financial people prefer colourful graphs and charts over numbers — 
because they’re able to interpret, say, the relationship between different colour 
block comparisons more easily than the same information presented in numbers.
I’ve found people tend to have a few charts they understand and like to see on a 
regular basis. So explore this option and work out what you prefer. And if you’re 
exporting to spreadsheets on a regular basis, explore some of the add-on report-
ing tools because they may save you time (refer to Chapter 16).

CHAPTER 17  Ten (Plus One!) Tips for Long-Term Success with Xero      401
Set up Bank Feeds and Reconcile  
Regularly
One of the star features of Xero is bank feeds. Once you have set up and authorised 
bank feeds in Xero, all the transactions that have passed through the banks pass 
directly into Xero — massively reducing data entry. All you need to do is code the 
transactions and reconcile them.
I recommend you reconcile all bank accounts in Xero regularly to ensure informa-
tion is up to date and any transactional issues are dealt with on a timely basis. It’s 
far easier to recall what a transaction is about and deal with any issues if the 
transaction is recent — versus trying to sort out something that happened six 
months ago. Regular reconciliations also ensure the Money Coming In dashboard 
is correct, highlighting clients who need to be followed up for outstanding 
­payments, so you can boost cash flowing into the business. (Refer to Chapter 8 for 
more on reconciliations.)
Setting up bank rules is also useful. Bank rules recognise incoming transactions 
and suggest the default treatment of those transactions. They only take a few 
minutes to set up, and focusing on setting up bank rules in the early days usually 
means, within about six weeks, all typical transactions are quickly reconciled. 
This again speeds up your processing time in Xero. (Refer to Chapter 4 for more 
on setting up bank rules.)
Use the Batch Payments Feature
Another time-saving technique you should adopt is electronic banking payments. 
Batch payments can be created within Xero and uploaded to online banking via 
electronic banking payments. You need to contact your bank to set up electronic 
banking with them — and then process transactions within Xero and produce a 
batch payments file, which you then upload to the bank. (Some New Zealand 
banks even allow the batch payment file to be sent directly to online banking — 
they certainly seem to be leading the way with online automation!) This process 
is another time-saver, as data isn’t being duplicated.
Keep Bank Accounts for Business Use
This tip is simple, yet it really makes a big difference to your accounts. Here it 
is:  Use business bank accounts exclusively for business use. I agree  — not 

402      PART 5  The Part of Tens
particularly earth-shattering. But time and again I see accounts mixed up with 
personal spending, which is confusing and leads to expenses being overlooked or, 
worse, accidentally being claimed. By not processing personal expenditure through 
business bank accounts, when you reconcile the account you’re confident all the 
transactions are business related — even if you sometimes still struggle to work 
out what they are!
Embrace Change
Because of the online nature of Xero, changes can be implemented overnight. 
Typically, you’re notified of the general nature of the changes; however, a change 
in one area may have an unexpected effect in another area. If things look different 
but seem to work okay, don’t stress over it — accept it and work with it. It’s a 
natural part of Xero’s evolution and a unique feature of cloud solutions.
Overnight changes result in many benefits for you, the user. It means you don’t 
have to wait for new software releases and then waste time with manual upgrades. 
I’ve done my fair share of desktop-based upgrades and they are just a huge waste 
of time! Xero’s effortless evolution means new features are available for you to 
use right here, right now. The change may be the exact thing you wanted, or 
something that you never knew you needed, but that now makes processing your 
accounts a little easier.
Use Tracking to Sharpen Reporting
The Tracking feature is super easy to set up and use, and leads to more powerful 
reporting. Xero has two available tracking categories, and numerous tracking 
options can be included for each category. All transactions can be allocated to a 
tracking option. Many reports can be customised to show comparative or 
­individual tracking options. (You can delete tracking categories but you can’t 
mark them as closed or inactive. If you still want the option of being able to 
access historical tracking information after you’ve finished using the tracking 
categories, you can add a Z to the front of the name so they drop to the bottom of 
the list.) Refer to Chapter 12 for more on setting up tracking options.

CHAPTER 17  Ten (Plus One!) Tips for Long-Term Success with Xero      403
Take Advantage of Repeating  
Bills and Invoices
Repeating bills and invoices can be set up for regular transactions. You can define 
them to save as a draft and edit them every period, or, if the amount is known, 
default them to be approved and automatically sent out every period. Set it up — 
then forget about it and watch the cash come in! (Refer to Chapter 6 for more on 
setting up repeating invoices.)
Collaborate with Your Xero  
Advisory Team
Empower experts to help you! The online nature of Xero enables specialists with 
permission to collaboratively support your business. Accountants, bookkeepers, 
virtual assistants, online integration gurus and others can jump online and into 
Xero, and assist as and when you need them to.
All of your business accounts are stored in the one place and, depending on the 
user permission levels, everyone is accessing identical data — reducing any con-
fusion. The location of your Xero advisory team is no barrier — you don’t have to 
rent extra office space to accommodate them — and if you have assistants located 
in different time zones, you can set them work in the evening, and it’s ready for 
you the next morning. Xero works hard for you while you sleep!
Effectively Tap into Online  
Storage Features
Traditionally, if your accountant wanted to check a financial record, they’d email 
you, and you’d then find some time to hunt down the paperwork, scan it, and send 
the accountant a copy. Maybe several days later the accountant would have the 
desired information details. Utilising the storage solution inside Xero enables 
users to access source documents online, eliminating the need to hunt through 
paperwork and filing cabinets. Multiple records can be attached to single 
­transactions — and we’re not just talking about PDFs. Images, Excel and Word 
files can all be uploaded and kept in Xero.

404      PART 5  The Part of Tens
So you can attach Excel calculations to a complicated transaction, or include lease 
documents with a car purchase. Financial records can also be organised by 
­creating folders within the Files inbox. Using this feature you can, for example, 
create folders for individual motor vehicles, or end of financial year accounting 
records, effectively sorting similar documents.
The biggest problem you’ll have with Xero’s online storage is working out what to 
do with all that freed up cupboard space — stationery versus shoes!

Ten Common Mistakes 
Made in Xero and How 
to Avoid Them
I
n this chapter, I highlight mistakes, myths and misconceptions about working 
with Xero. And I explain how you can identify and avoid them  — ensuring 
you’re working efficiently and effectively.
Not Making Use of Expert Help
The philosophy behind using Xero is, because it’s in the cloud, you can invite 
experts to work on your data and provide ongoing advice during the year about 
your financial position. No longer do you need to wait till the end of the year to 
speak to your accountant!
Chapter 18

406      PART 5  The Part of Tens
So make sure you take advantage of expert help, when and where you need it. If 
you need help with the set-up, contact a Xero-certified adviser (check out 
www.xero.com/advisors for options) to work with you during the process. This 
adviser can assist in identifying issues you need to be aware of, and work with you 
to set the file up to suit your specific business processes.
Engage a Xero-certified accountant for help with setting and monitoring goals, 
developing tax-mitigating strategies, and preparing financial year accounts.
If your existing accountant doesn’t know Xero, introduce them to it and encour-
age them to embrace the cloud with you. I’ve worked with a number of accoun-
tants who’ve got their first taste of Xero from a client  — and they’ve all said 
working with Xero was straightforward and that they picked it up quickly. (Of 
course, you could always get them to buy a copy of this book!)
Refer to Chapter 4 for more on inviting other users (such as your accountant) to 
access your accounts, and Chapter 11 for more on working with your accountant on 
end of financial year reporting.
Not Understanding Terminology 
Differences
I’ve been fortunate enough to work in accounts departments all over the world, 
and work with numerous accounting software — from ACCPAC to Xero, and lots 
in-between! Debits and credits are an international accounting language but, as 
you move through different systems, different clients and different countries, 
terminology changes. Income becomes Revenue and Proprietorship becomes 
Equity — you can have lots of terms with generally the same meaning.
In Australia, for example, the term credit note was replaced with adjustment note 
with the introduction of GST — but people colloquially still call it a credit note.
In the same area, debit notes are issued to a supplier to reduce the amount you owe. 
The terminology Xero uses for both adjustment notes and debit notes is simply 
credit notes.
Pay slips are referred to as payslips in Xero, which seems to be the US rendering. 
You may uncover other instances; however, because of the areas the terminology 
is within, you should be able to easily understand what Xero is referring to. Some-
times, as with the Chart of Accounts, you can override the default terminology and 
replace it with what you’re comfortable with. However, some of the terminology 

CHAPTER 18  Ten Common Mistakes Made in Xero and How to Avoid Them      407
can’t be changed. The important thing is to understand what is meant — and, 
hopefully, you won’t even notice it after using Xero for a while.
Messing Up Bank Reconciliation 
Autosuggestions
Xero helpfully recognises regular transactions and, when you’re reconciling these 
transactions in the future, makes autosuggestions appear beside the transactions. 
Where this can cause problems is if you incorrectly code a transaction, or code it 
in an unusual manner. Xero may remember the mistake and keep suggesting it for 
similar transactions. (Dammit, Janet!)
You can’t delete Xero’s autosuggestions, but you can overwrite them in the bank 
reconciliation screen. If Xero has memorised an incorrect autosuggestion you 
need to avoid using it — otherwise, you perpetuate the situation. The next time 
you see the incorrect autosuggestion while reconciling, you need to carefully 
­correct and record over the autosuggestion so that it replaces the one you don’t 
want remembered.
Alternatively, at the bottom of the reconciliation screen, uncheck the box beside 
Suggest Previous Entries — this turns autosuggestions off.
Using a Communal User Account
If all users access via a communal, generic user name, such as ABC Bookkeeping, 
you can’t tell who is actually accessing your file or what they are doing. You want 
anyone accessing your Xero file and financial data to be accountable and tagged in 
the audit trail.
So, instead, make sure everyone who accesses your Xero file uses their own user 
account, set up specifically for them with the access level you’ve allocated.
Not Deleting Old User Accounts
As soon as you have an inkling someone no longer needs access to your Xero file, 
you need to promptly act, and remove their access. Sometimes even the most nor-
mal of people end their time with a business in an unfavourable manner and do 

408      PART 5  The Part of Tens
some terrible things out of spite. While users can’t actually access any of your 
financial funds through Xero, and a limited trace of their user activity is main-
tained in Xero, it’s much better to be careful than sorry.
To delete a user in Xero, follow these steps:
1.	 From the home dashboard, go to Settings → General Settings → Users 
and click on the name of the user to be deleted from the file.
The Users dashboard opens.
2.	 Click the red Delete User button.
The Delete User window opens, checking if you’re sure you want to delete the 
user. Confirm by clicking the red Delete User button again. You’re returned to 
the Users dashboard and the deleted user has vanished!
Thinking Your Xero Emails Are Stored
The details of emails sent from Xero are not stored anywhere within Xero, although 
a note about the email sent is maintained in the History & Notes area. If you deal 
with hundreds of transactions, this is probably fine. If you’re bespoke and like to 
personalise your messages, you may want to keep a copy of the email — in this 
case, when you send an email, simply opt for a copy to be sent to your defined 
Xero email address (which is the email address you log in to Xero with) by check-
ing the Send Me a Copy box (refer to Chapter 6 for more information).
Not Realising the Subscriber Owns  
and Controls the Data
If you pay your Xero subscription to a Xero partner — let’s call her Katherine — 
due to Xero’s legal framework, the subscriber (Katherine) owns and controls 
access to the data. Check out Xero’s Terms and Conditions (www.xero.com/about/
terms) to see how this is clearly spelt out.
Let’s play devil’s advocate — if the partner sold her business, she would sell on 
the subscriptions, and thus the control of your data. If the new owner did not pay 
the Xero bills, your Xero data file would be deactivated — even if you had paid the 
partner. You may have some trouble reactivating your data file because you don’t 
own and control the data. Of course, many people subscribe through a reseller and 

CHAPTER 18  Ten Common Mistakes Made in Xero and How to Avoid Them      409
the relationship works without a hitch, but data ownership, control and access is 
something I highlight to all my clients and is something to think about.
Trying to Make Xero Do What  
Your Old System Did
If you’re moving from another accounting system or a paper-based system, 
adapting to a new system can be difficult. But don’t get stuck in a rut of trying to 
make Xero do what your other system did. Work towards learning the new pro-
cesses and names within the Xero system, so you’re working with it rather than 
against it.
Try to find 15 or 30 minutes each day for learning new aspects of Xero. Pick an 
issue (or a section of a chapter from this book) to work on. Embrace the change.
Watching Your Bank Feeds Refresh
If you’re using third party bank feeds, you may benefit from refreshing these on a 
regular basis. If they’re taking too long to refresh, cancel the refresh and give it 
another go. If you know your bank feed refreshes can take a few moments, don’t 
sit and watch the screen twiddling your thumbs. If you have a high-speed internet 
connection, you can open another tab on your computer and carry on working 
while the bank feed refreshes. If you have a slow connection, plan to have some-
thing productive you can do without touching your computer — while still staying 
close by (because you’re still logged in to Xero). Sort out your paperwork, return a 
phone call or brainstorm goals on a whiteboard.
Paying Full Price If You’re a NFP
If you’re a charity, not-for-profit or have multiple Xero subscriptions, you’re 
­eligible for a discount on your monthly subscription charge! For more informa-

small-business rock stars who educate, motivate and inspire me — I’m elated to 
be a part of your journey. Thanks to Kerry Laundon for refreshing the existing 
text, and editing the new writing. Thanks to Ingrid Bond for efficiently managing 
this project. Also, thanks to the rest of the team at John Wiley & Sons Australia 
Pty Ltd.
Many thanks to the Xero staff around the world who have answered queries, called 
me and jumped online with me to run through processes, and those who have 
technically checked the book.
This is the 3rd edition of Xero For Dummies, and my heart warms to know that so 
many of you have supported me from the beginning of this journey. So thanks to 
the extraordinary staff and partners of Xero — particularly Andrew Hirst, Justin 
Campbell and Steven Leaney, with special mention going to the remarkable and 
inspirational Trent Innes.
Special thanks to the Xero community who are together with me on this journey: 
The ORANGILICIOUS Catherine Walker, who — from the other side of the world — 
answers my queries with a chipper ^OG when I’m up at lonely hours tapping away 
at my keyboard; the award-winning #SmokinHotBookkeepers; my Xero Heroes 
Gillian Rossouw, Lisa Martin and Melanie Morris, who are still here with me; my 
mentors and friends who’ve helped me on this journey — Jason Forbes, David 
New, Tracey Brittain Newman, Chris Wheatley, Cassandra Scott and the account-
ing maverick Wayne Schmidt; and the transcendent Sally Schmidt.
Thanks to everyone who answers my queries in the Xero Mastermind community 
on social media or shares their insight with me over coffee — with special men-
tion to new friends across the ocean Sharon Pocock, Alex Falcon Huerta, Dan 
Schmidt, Amanda Aguillard, Blake Oliver and, finally, Giles Wilson, who used his 
super-hero powers to turbo-boost my internet speed — what every cloud consul-
tant wants!
Thanks also to my writing mentor and friend Valerie Khoo and the Australian 
Writers’ Centre community — who challenge and believe in my writing. If you 
have a desire to write, do a course with the AWC!

Thank you to my family: Simon, Christopher and Charlotte. Christopher, you’re 
hilarious and bring laughter and happiness into our lives — thank you for being 
you. Charlotte, your energy and creativity light up a room — stay confident and 
unpredictable and thank you for being you. Charlie, thanks for nuzzling my feet 
for endless hours, keeping me company and pestering me to take you on walks. 
And thank you to my husband, Simon, who’s accommodated all my crazy writing 
hours. None of this would be possible without you.
Thanks also go to you — for reading this book. If you take a selfie with the book, 
share it on Twitter and tag @HeatherSmithAU — I’d love to hear from you. All the 
best on your Xero journey.
