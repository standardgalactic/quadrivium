About the Authors
Joanne Bagshaw is a psychotherapist, writer, and promoter of
attachment parenting. She has a master’s degree in Forensic
Psychology from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New
York City and a post-graduate certificate in Trauma Studies from
New York University. She is also in her final year of a four-year 
certification in Core Energetics, a body-centered psychotherapy.
Her psychotherapy practice focuses on trauma treatment, and
how emotional and energetic issues manifest in the body.
Her inspiration for writing this book came from her love of massage
and experience as a mother caring for her newborn daughter.
Joanne lives with her husband, Tim; her daughter, Ava; and her 
dog-daughter, Dakota, in Brookhaven, New York. She loves yoga
and skiing and grudgingly practices Pilates. She can be reached at
jbgshw@optonline.net.
Ilene S. Fox, LMT is a New York State Licensed Massage Therapist.
She graduated from the New Center for Wholistic Health, Education
and Research in 1998. She holds certifications as an Infant Massage
Instructor and in Pre/Post Natal Massage. In addition to her private
massage practice, Ilene is employed at the State University of New
York at Stony Brook as a massage therapist in the Department of
Pediatrics/Division of Infectious Disease. Here she teaches infant
massage instruction to caretakers of HIV-exposed newborns and
provides massage therapy to HIV/AIDS-infected children, adoles-
cents, and young adults.
Ilene wanted to write this book because she believes massage ther-
apy adds peace and calm to a world of chaos. Creating a book that
teaches parents to massage their babies can only make the world a
better place.
Ilene loves music, travel, yoga, and, of course, massage. She lives
on Long Island and can be reached at peacepipe62@hotmail.com.
Dedication
From Joanne: For Ava — this book is so much about you.
From Ilene: To all of the babies and the people who care for them.


Authors’ Acknowledgments
From Joanne: I want to thank my husband, Tim, for his never-ending
support and encouragement for me to do whatever I need to be
happy . . . even if that means everything else becomes “just too
much” before a deadline.
To Ava, I thank you for sharing your beautiful smile in Mommy’s
book. 
Thank you to my subs, Ginger, Jillian, and Mariah, for giving Ava
loving and nurturing care when I needed to write and she needed to
squeak and play.
To my coauthor, Ilene — without your experience and knowledge,
we couldn’t have written this book. It has been my pleasure to get
to know you better — thank you.
To Anna Damaskos, for giving my name to Grace Freedson, thank
you; and to Grace, my literary agent, thank you for your support in
getting this project.
To Joan Friedman, our project editor, I want to say that I couldn’t
ask for a better editor — thank you. 
Thank you to Kathryn Born and Margie Pillar for the beautiful illus-
trations and photographs.
To my family, friends, and Core Community: Each of you, in your
unique way, helps me reach for the stars.
From Ilene: Terence, I want to thank you for putting up with me for
the past eight-plus years, for being my massage subject when I was
still a student and didn’t know what I was doing, and for your sup-
port when I thought I couldn’t do it.
To my clients, I want to say that I appreciate you giving me the
honor of working with you. Because of your receptivity and our
shared wisdom, we have the opportunity to learn how we can
heal ourselves through the power of touch: with compassion,
care, presence and tenderness. 
Thank you, Joanne, for making this possible with all your hard work
and determination. To Ava, thank you for being so good-natured all
the time.
Thank you to all the babies, my parents, and my friends.

Introduction
T
he fact that you’ve picked up this book and are reading this
page tells us that, most likely, you’ve heard of baby massage.
You may not know why or how to do it, but you’re curious to find
out. That’s great: That’s what we’re here for!
If, on the other hand, you picked up this book because you had
some time to kill browsing in the bookstore and never realized that
such a thing as baby massage existed, that’s fine, too. We’re an
equal opportunity informer, and we welcome you to our pages.
In case you need convincing that this book is worth taking home,
consider this: Baby massage is a practice that has been around for
centuries, and recent research indicates that it provides both emo-
tional and physical benefits for your little one (and a wonderful
opportunity to increase the bond between the two of you).
We save the details for the chapters that follow, but before we get
to the meat and potatoes of baby massage, we need to explain a bit
about how we put this book together.
About This Book
Our goal with this book is to enhance a wonderful longstanding 
tradition with contemporary knowledge — essentially, to fuse the
past and the present. (How’s that for a tall order?) We want to
help you, as a parent or caregiver, realize that you have the ability
to positively influence your baby’s health and that the steps to
accomplishing that aren’t very complicated. Our hope is that we
can encourage you to make massage part of your everyday rela-
tionship with your baby so you can reap the many benefits.
You’ll notice that throughout the book, we tie together the techni-
cal aspects of massage — the specific hand positions and strokes
you use — with both medical and philosophical reasons for doing
them. But don’t let a little philosophy make you nervous; we don’t
expect you to automatically feel comfortable with every idea we
present. Our purpose is to offer a holistic approach to massage so
you can decide what works for you and your baby.

How To Use this Book
Like every For Dummies book, this is a reference book. No, that
doesn’t mean it’s like an encyclopedia; it means that we don’t
expect you to read it from cover to cover. (Of course, if you find
it so compelling that you can’t miss a single word, we won’t com-
plain!) This book is designed so you can pick and choose which
chapters you really want to focus on, and within each chapter you
can find all the information you need to understand that particular
subject.
You’ll notice that we include lots of artwork in this book. That’s
because we realize you may have an easier time understanding
what we’re saying if you can see examples. But while the photos
and illustrations are a great complement to the text, they can’t 
substitute for the step-by-step instructions for each massage tech-
nique. We encourage you to use the words and images together to
perfect each technique.
How this Book Is Organized
This book is divided into the following five parts.
Part I: Nothing Quite Like Touch
In this part, we share with you all the wonderful reasons to massage
your baby. We detail the benefits for you, the parent or caregiver,
as well as for your baby. You discover how your baby’s develop-
ment is influenced by touch, as well as the steps you can take to
prepare for giving your first massage.
Part II: Different Strokes
for Different Folks: 
Massaging Baby
In this section, we show you the actual techniques for massaging
your baby. We cover all parts of your little one’s body, from head
to toe, front to back. What works for some babies won’t work for
others, so we offer a smorgasbord from which to choose so you
can find out what techniques work best for you and your baby.

Part III: Making Massage Part
of Your Baby’s Life
Babies change so dramatically during their first years that we can’t
simply assume that the massage your baby enjoys at 3 months
will still satisfy her at 2 years. And babies who are born early have
special needs and limitations. In this part, you find in-depth infor-
mation about massaging your preterm baby, as well as your older
baby or toddler. We also discuss how you can work massage into
your everyday life.
Part IV: Easing Health Problems
with Massage
One of the great benefits of baby massage is that it can help alleviate
many common health problems, from constipation to teething pain.
It can also have positive effects on emotional issues and reduce
stress and encourage development in babies with high-risk issues,
such as fetal alcohol syndrome and drug addiction. We cover each
of these topics in this part.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Each For Dummies book has a Part of Tens, and this is no exception.
This last part offers you quick information on different massage and
stretch techniques to add to your repertoire, as well as massage

 Realizing the importance of attachment
 Getting a brief introduction to massage technique
 Anticipating the benefits of massaging your baby
You have so many good reasons to massage your baby, and
this chapter introduces you to the biggies. We discuss how
and why you can use massage as a tool to foster and enhance your
attachment with your baby. We also touch on the physical benefits
of baby massage — including how you can use massage to help
treat and prevent certain illnesses.
Along the way, we introduce you to the basics of Swedish
massage — the foundation of the techniques we demonstrate in
later chapters. And we explain how you can adapt your massage
routine to accommodate the needs of babies at different ages and
stages of development.
Focusing on Quality, Not Quantity
If you recently became a parent, you may have spent the last nine
months preparing for birth and connecting emotionally with your
baby. Or maybe your pregnancy was unplanned and your experi-
ence has been laced with anxiety and self-doubt. Perhaps infertility
plagued your attempts to get pregnant, and now your dreams of
parenthood are finally realized, either through birth or adoption.

Regardless of how your baby came into your life, or what your par-
enting circumstances are, baby massage is a great way to create
a relationship with your little one. Spending even five minutes 
massaging your baby each day creates a space for bonding and
relaxation for both of you that can stay in your baby’s memory
for a lifetime.
We have all heard that the quality of time we spend with our 
children — not the quantity — makes a difference. There is no
greater manifestation of this truth, no better example or opportu-
nity, than to give love to your child through massage. Time spent
massaging your baby involves genuine, undivided attention that is
experienced as love and pleasure. Intend your massage as a gift,
and it will be received as such.
Recognizing the Need for Touch
In other cultures — which some people might label primitive —
mothers typically carry their babies with them all the time. These
mothers are very attuned to their babies’ needs and respond to
them quickly and naturally with ease. This bonding approach to
parenting breeds intuition and compassion, and it begins with
touch.
Considering our changing values
Before the inventions of anesthesia and baby formula, all mothers
felt the birth of their children and the sensation of their children
suckling on the breast. Since these inventions, values have changed
in our culture, as have conventional wisdoms.
The choices many parents now make when giving birth are based
on cost- and time-effectiveness — if not for the parents themselves,
at least for the hospital and its staff. Nature’s primal callings have
been minimized by a healthcare profession that has to manage
huge demands on its time. Epidurals (a form of anesthesia deliv-
ered through the spine) are the norm, and Caesarean deliveries are
performed in as many as a quarter of all pregnancies. During much
of the twentieth century, formula was touted as the best option for
mother and baby; breastfeeding was considered an inferior feeding
method and an inconvenience.
We certainly understand that sometimes Caesareans and epidurals
are medically necessary, and some of the changes that have
occurred have resulted in greater health for mothers and babies.

However, we also recognize another result of our changing values:
Opportunities for touch and bonding between parent and child
have been reduced.
Another factor that impedes the bond between parent and child
is a detached approach to parenting, which nurtures laziness or
apathy. Parents are only human, and the demands of everyday
life, particularly with an infant or young child, are enormous.
Detachment parenting is an invitation to do and care less. We all
have within us the capacity to be lazy or believe we deserve a
break. That’s why it’s important to consciously make a commit-
ment to attachment-focused nurturing and bonding. If you invest
energy today, you will reap rewards throughout your life.
Choosing attachment parenting
So what exactly does the term attachment parenting mean?
Attachment parenting is a philosophy of parenting that emphasizes
creating a secure attachment with your baby. Just about all the
advice we give in this book is aimed at encouraging attachment
parenting. This parenting style is about being sensitive to your
children, getting to know them and their needs, and relying on
your own intuition as a parent.
Using the right tools
While there aren’t any specific rules or guidelines to follow to prac-
tice attachment parenting, here are some tools you can use that
make a secure attachment with your child more likely:
 Massage your baby.
 Breastfeed.
 Avoid separations.
 Co-sleep (see Chapter 3).
 Wear your baby in a sling (see the sidebar “The art of baby
wearing” later in this chapter).
 Bond with your baby immediately after birth (see Chapter 3).
 Respond to your baby’s cries.
 Feed your baby on cue, not on a schedule.
Not all these tools will work for you, your baby, or your family.
That’s why relying on your intuition is so important. You can 
formula-feed your baby and sleep in separate rooms and still be
practicing attachment parenting.

Seeing the benefits
To many people, the term attachment parenting probably sounds
scary. After all, we want our children to grow up and be independ-
ent, not attached to our hips for the rest of our lives, right?
A better term to describe this parenting style would probably be
healthy interdependent promoting parenting. But that’s just too
much of a mouthful.
Whatever you want to name it, this approach to parenting has
many benefits:
 Your baby learns to trust you.
 Your baby grows into a sensitive and empathic child and
adult.
 Your baby learns interdependence: how to care about and con-
nect with others in a compassionate and cooperative way.
 Because attachment-parented babies spend less time crying
than others, their energy goes into growing and learning.
Attachment-parented babies also tend to be more alert and
focused.
 Attachment-parented babies are more confident.
 You become more sensitive.
 A deep attachment between you and your baby is formed.
 You have a happy baby whose needs are met and feelings are
respected.
Spoiling your baby?
New parents sometimes hear advice from older generations — and
child development experts — about not spoiling their children by
giving them too much attention and responding immediately to their
needs. Theories about child development have changed radically
through the years. Not long ago, new parents were advised to ignore
their babies’ cries to be fed in order to create a strict feeding sched-
ule. And recently, sleep trainers have become popular, helping new
parents get their babies onto a sleep schedule as early as possible.
While these practices serve a purpose — creating predictable rou-
tines early in an infant’s life — they can contribute to a sense of
separation between parent and child. This is just one more reason
to make a conscious choice to devote time to bonding through touch
and massage.

In Vimala McClure’s book Infant Massage, she writes, “As with fruit,
neglect rather than attention spoils a child.” You are the center of
your baby’s world (and she is the center of yours!). Your baby relies
on you for everything: food, love, safety, nurturing. We believe that
if spoiling refers to giving your baby lots of love and attention and
responding to her needs, then by all means, you should spoil away!
Massaging Your Baby 
from Head to Toe
The techniques we show you in this book fit under the category of
Swedish massage. They have been adapted to be useful for babies
and toddlers.
Using Swedish massage techniques
The origins of Swedish massage can be traced to Per Henrik Ling
(1776–1839), the “Father of Massage,” who cured himself of rheuma-
tism with a brand of massage that he called medical gymnastics.
Today, a Swedish massage performed on an adult consists of 
specific strokes done in the following order:
Chapter 1: The Wonderful World of Massage 11
Bringing infant massage
to the Western world
The founder of the International Association of Infant Massage, Vimala McClure,
discovered infant massage during her travels in India in the early 1970s. In Indian
culture, the mother massages everyone in the family and passes the tradition down
through her daughters. McClure found that massaging babies was a wonderful way
to soothe and communicate nonverbally with them. When McClure contracted
malaria, all the local women massaged and sang to her. The feeling in her body
resulting from the massage stayed in her memory.
What McClure experienced in India simply didn’t exist in Western culture at the
time. She wrote Infant Massage in 1979 to remind us that love, security, and com-
passion are a type of wealth. She created the International Association of Infant
Massage to offer opportunities for this type of touch to anyone. Infant massage
instruction now takes place all over the world. We want to acknowledge and thank
Vimala McClure for bringing infant massage to our attention. Her work reminded us
of what we once knew but learned to forget.

1. Effleurage. These gliding strokes can be deep or superficial
and help to warm the superficial muscles.
2. Petrissage. These strokes reach the deeper layers of
muscle tissue by lifting the muscle.
3. Friction. By working with the fibers of the muscle, friction
releases any scar tissue that may restrict movement.
4. Tapotement. These strokes include tapping or hacking the
muscles and can either stimulate or sedate depending upon
the rhythm and pressure used.
5. Vibration. This technique involves shaking or rocking the
muscles to induce either a stimulating or sedating effect on
the body.
6. Joint motion. Putting a joint through its complete range of
motion helps alleviate any restrictions in movement.
With babies, you don’t need to use all the strokes of Swedish mas-
sage, and you may move the order of the strokes around. Slow,
rhythmic strokes are the most soothing to a baby. For a very young

Researching the benefits of touch
The Touch Research Institute (TRI), located at the University of Miami School of
Medicine, was founded in 1992 by Tiffany Field, Ph.D. TRI conducts research on the
effects of touch and works to apply these findings to science and medicine.
Here are some of TRI’s findings:
 Newborns who are exposed to cocaine in utero gain weight faster and show
less signs of stress if they are massaged.
 Fathers who massage their babies for 15 minutes daily experience more favor-
able interactions with their infants.
 Depressed mothers touch their babies differently than mothers who aren’t
depressed, which can negatively affect growth patterns in newborns. Research
studies show that if depressed mothers massage their infants, the babies gain
weight more quickly, have more organized sleep/wake behaviors, are less fussy,
are more sociable and easily soothed, have better interaction behaviors, and
have lower levels of stress hormones.
 Premature babies receive the most significant benefits from massage. These
infants gain more weight, sleep better, and are discharged from the hospital
sooner if they receive massage.
 Newborns exposed to HIV gain more weight if they receive massage.

infant, holding and rocking (a form of vibration) may be enough.
Being present and aware of your baby’s responses and needs will
guide you in your choice of strokes.
Some strokes, if performed too vigorously, can be harmful to a
baby; for example, you never want to use deep friction or heavy
tapotement on an infant.
Any kind of contact with your infant — even just having him near
your body — is the basis for beginning to massage your infant. As
your baby gets older and more used to massage, he can tolerate
more strokes, and you will be able to massage your baby from
head to toe.
Acing Massage 101
The goal of Swedish massage is to increase the circulation of blood
and lymph fluids in the body. The fluids are pushed out of the
muscle tissue, back into the circulatory system, and out of the
body through the elimination process.
Toxic material (in the form of lactic acid) accumulates in our
bodies — specifically in our muscle tissues — as a result of poor
diet, overmedication, exercise, illness, or dehydration. This toxic
material results in knots, trigger points (tender, painful spots located
on a very tight muscle), adhesions (areas where muscle and fascia —
which we define in a moment — adhere to one another), and scar
tissue. These problems cause pain, discomfort, and restriction
of movement. Injury and poor posture can put muscle tissue into
spasm to protect the area from further harm, causing patterns
of pain.
Massage therapy works the soft tissues of the body so they can
function optimally. Massage therapy is the only form of bodywork
that addresses the soft tissue specifically, putting the body back
into homeostasis (balance).
Consider this analogy: Think of the body as a sweater. If you pull
one corner of the sweater, it changes the shape of the entire sweater.
Massage puts the soft tissue — your sweater — back into its proper
shape.
The body is lined with fascia, which is like a netting that holds
everything in place. Keeping the integrity of the fascia is one of the
main goals of massage therapy. Injury, adhesions, scar tissue, illness,
disease, and spasms all pull on the fascia, resulting in stretching
the sweater out of shape.
Chapter 1: The Wonderful World of Massage 13

Benefiting all ages: Preemies 
to toddlers
Baby massage is a wonderful form of touch for babies of all ages.
Even babies in utero can benefit from massage (see the sidebar on
“Prenatal massage”).
Preparing yourself mentally
No matter how old your baby is, be genuine, present, and attentive
with him. Massaging your baby without intention is, frankly, a
waste of time. Intention is simple, but it requires sincerity, focus,
and presence. You can establish intention by saying something
like, “I am here for you my little one, to love you, to care for you,
to make you feel comfort and love.” Be sure you are fully present
as you say the words; infuse them with feeling and sincerity.
Most of us don’t realize how often we detach ourselves from the
world. While we sit in the presence of others, we spend a lot of
time drifting off or becoming distracted. This is so common it is
regarded as normal. Unfortunately, our interaction with others 
suffers silently; our connections are compromised.

Prenatal massage
Pregnant women experience extreme changes in their bodies. Prenatal massage is
a great way to alleviate some of the discomforts caused by pregnancy, such as sci-
atica, joint pain, fatigue, hormonal imbalances, edema, leg cramps, and constipation.
Make sure that your massage therapist has training in prenatal massage, because
she needs to be aware of some things to avoid. For example, it is not safe to mas-
sage the belly during the first trimester. In addition, some points in AMMA (an Asian
type of massage) can trigger a miscarriage. As long as your massage therapist is
properly trained, massage during pregnancy is perfectly safe.
An added bonus of prenatal massage is being able to lie on your belly. Some mas-
sage therapists use a special type of cushion (placed on top of the massage table),
which can allow you to safely lie on your belly even in the third trimester!
Your coauthor Joanne highly recommends receiving regular prenatal massages:
During my recent pregnancy, I had weekly massages and found that the more I
relaxed, the more relaxed my baby became. After Ava was born, I used a stroke on
her belly that was similar to the stroke used on my abdomen. She loved the stroke,
and I believe it was familiar to her. She melted like butter on the changing table!

You will find this to be true when you are challenged to stay
100 percent present with your baby during massage. Breathe deeply,
powerfully, and steadily, and project love toward and into your
baby as you massage her. Keep your entire attention focused on
your presence and interaction with your baby. This is a challenge,
but it is completely within your capability. With practice, you will
quickly become more aware, more regular in your breathing, and
more focused.
Working with a premature baby
A study conducted by Touch Research Institute in 1986 showed
that premature infants who receive some kind of touch in the hos-
pital gain up to 47 percent more weight than those who don’t. The
sooner premature babies gain weight, the sooner they are able to
come home.
If you have a premature baby, all you need to do to bring massage
into his life is to touch him with your finger. Believe it or not, just
the touch of your finger stimulates his growth and development.
Being touched increases circulation in any area on your baby’s
body. Increased circulation is physically stimulating, as well as
encouraging to overall growth and good health. Gentle massage is
a basic and loving method to help your preemie along. It is also a
great way to bring physical connection into your baby’s world.
Watch your baby react in wonder and pleasure, and you’ll know
you’re on the right track.
Chapter 1: The Wonderful World of Massage 15
The art of baby wearing
You have probably seen other moms and dads carrying their babies around in slings.
Wearing your baby in a sling offers a feeling of comfort and safety similar to what
is experienced in the womb.
Let’s be blunt: Being born is stressful. Labor can be difficult, everything is new, and
babies have to learn how to get their needs met. Wearing your baby provides her
the comfort of motion and close contact with you. It also strengthens bonding. You
can begin to use a sling with your newborn right away. It’s an easy and convenient
way to nurture your baby while you do errands or just move about your house. (Your
coauthor Joanne wrote many pages of this book wearing her baby in a sling!)
Wearing your baby is also an easy way to be sure that your baby has all the touch
and contact she needs as a newborn. Baby wearing can be likened to a hands-free
massage!

Massaging newborns and infants
Holding, rocking, and gently stroking are usually enough to create
an attachment and calm and soothe your newborn baby. If your
baby is crying, remember to maintain a deep, self-nurturing, steady
breathing. This prevents you from becoming stressed and over-
whelmed, which makes it easier for your baby to relax.
As your baby grows older and is able to tolerate more touch and
stimulation, you will be able to use the massage techniques we
show you later in the book (see Chapters 5, 6, and 7). Even if you
have just started to massage your infant, have fun, and don’t be
afraid to experiment!
Touching your toddler
When your baby is no longer a baby, you can add more strokes to
your repertoire depending on your baby’s attention and tolerance
level. If you have been massaging your toddler since infancy, you
will know her needs for touch very well by this point. You can
increase the length and frequency of your sessions. Don’t be sur-
prised when she begins to ask you for a massage!
If you haven’t been massaging your young one up to this point, it’s
not too late to begin. In Chapter 9, we offer all sorts of tips to help
you keep your mobile 1- or 2-year-old interested long enough for
you to massage her.
It’s also not too late for your toddler to reap the benefits of baby
massage. You can use this time to strengthen your bond, teach her
how to relax, and soothe her hardworking muscles!
Healing and tending 
to special needs
Baby massage is a great holistic tool to use — always in conjunction
with medical advice, of course — to help your baby with common
ailments and different developmental needs.
Some massage techniques are effective when medicine isn’t. Anyone
with a colicky baby will attest to the fact that they would do any-
thing to stop their baby from being in pain, and to stop the crying.
A simple belly massage may feel good to your baby and ease the
pain. Obviously, massage isn’t a substitute for professional medical
care, but offering massage is a conservative way to begin treating
common ailments.

Offering preventative medicine
Massage is a great way of preventing your baby from becoming
sick or stressed by maintaining his health. Regular massage keeps
the body in homeostasis (balance) by increasing circulation,
improving the efficiency of the elimination process, relieving
stress, and improving immune function. Massage is a simple and
effective way of preventing illness.
Treating physical problems
In Chapter 11, we focus on common ailments or physical problems
that massage can help alleviate. Massage can be an effective treat-
ment for the following problems common to babies:
 Slow weight gain
 Teething
 Colic
 Sleep problems
 Stress
 Digestive troubles
 Chest and sinus congestion
Easing emotional stress
As we discuss in Chapter 12, massage can also help babies deal
with emotional issues, such as the following:
 Attachment/bonding
 Socializing
 Relaxation
Having faith
Faith is an elusive quality. We invite you to have faith in massage as
an approach to healing, as well as in your ability to administer it.
Your baby can and will enjoy your loving touch, and using this
opportunity to heal and help your loved one is a powerful and
empowering experience.
In the United States, we tend to turn to doctors, hospitals, and the
pharmaceutical industry for health and healing. But for centuries,
the Asian cultures (particularly the Chinese) have relied rather
successfully on holistic, hands-on healing practices. Massage is
both a medical and a holistic treatment.

Unleashing endorphins
Endorphins are our bodies’ natural painkillers. A release of endorphins (commonly
referred to as a runner’s high) leaves you feeling euphoric instead of fatigued, over-
worked, or exhausted. The deep relaxed state that massage induces triggers the
release of endorphins. Keep this in mind when your baby is teething or stressed
from colic. With massage, you can treat the cause of the pain and its symptoms,
plus you can provide your baby with a natural, drug-free painkiller.

aby massage isn’t just something that you do to your baby;
it’s a way of communicating through touch how much love you
have for your little one. Massage offers almost as many benefits to
you, the caregiver, as it does to your baby. This chapter explains
the many wonderful reasons to bring massage into your baby’s life,
from promoting a positive bond to reducing your baby’s stress.
Bonding with Your Baby:
It’s a Good Thing!
Many new parents, upon arriving home with their babies, are in awe
of the responsibility of parenthood and — to be perfectly honest —
terrified by it. If you know many couples who have had children,
chances are you’ve heard at least a few of them admit to looking
at each other after their homecoming and saying, “Now what?”
Getting in touch
A hospital is not always an ideal setting for beginning the bonding
process with your newborn. Even if you had zero opportunity to

bond with your baby in the hospital, you can start doing so as soon
as you get home, and touch — including massage — is the ideal way
to begin.
All you really need to do to begin bonding is to touch your baby a
lot. Hold him, rock him, wear him in a sling, or sway with him every
chance you get. Bonding can occur during feeding, changing, and
sleeping, as well as during times when you’re massaging your little
one. Young babies aren’t frequently alert and attentive, but luckily
you don’t have to wait for these times to promote bonding. Your
intention, and how much energy you are willing to direct toward
your baby, are the key factors.
Bonding with your baby creates a secure and healthy attachment
between you two. Your baby internalizes this feeling of safety, which
leads to him being easier to comfort and more affectionate.
Releasing a bonding hormone
The bonding benefits of touch and massage aren’t strictly emotional.
There is a physical basis for the connection that develops between
mothers and babies during massage.
Massage stimulates the release of oxytocin in a mother’s body.
Oxytocin is a hormone that serves some key functions during and
after pregnancy. For example:
 Oxytocin stimulates the mother’s uterus to contract during
labor.
 Oxytocin promotes the let-down reflex during breastfeeding —
the reflex that moves milk into the breast so the baby gets
food when he sucks.
 Oxytocin is continually released whenever a mother nurses,
and it helps to relax the mother and nurture the bond between
mother and baby during breastfeeding.
When a mother massages her baby, she stimulates the release of
oxytocin in her own body, which facilitates attachment and bond-
ing. Through physical touch, she promotes a deeper emotional
connection with her infant.
Promoting trust
Babies need a lot of touch and holding. The best advice we can
offer new parents is to approach each day of parenting with a clear
understanding of how important touch is — especially in the first
Part I: Nothing Quite Like Touch 
20

six weeks to two months of life, when many babies need constant
holding or touch during their awake time.
With that said, you want to also realize that touch and holding are
only part of the picture — the physical part. If you touch your
baby frequently but do so without paying any attention to what
you’re doing, you (and your baby) aren’t reaping the full benefits of
the contact. You must also be attuned to your baby. By attuned we
mean being as present as possible whenever you hold, touch, and
carry her. Doing so will satisfy her need for comfort and safety
more fully than touch alone.
Through her earliest interactions with you, your infant discovers
what it means to count on other people — to trust. Babies who are
massaged tend to develop strong feelings of trust for their care-
givers, and as a result they also tend to have experiences with other
people that are warm, nurturing, and loving. Your first experiences
in touching your baby are essential in creating a trusting relation-
ship between the two of you. These early moments truly lay the
foundation for your relationship.
Communicating
As we all know, communication can take many forms; we pick up
messages in a variety of ways, not all of them verbal. When you
massage your baby, you and your baby have many opportunities
to express yourselves nonverbally.
Here are just two examples of nonverbal communication that can
be expressed during a massage:
 Babies learn to see themselves through their caregivers’ eyes.
Providing eye contact during a massage gives your baby the
opportunity to feel loved and to have his sweetness and vul-
nerability mirrored back to him through your eyes.
 When you massage your fussy baby, you model relaxation
with your relaxed and soothing touch.
During massage, your baby picks up cues from you. Don’t underes-
timate how much information your baby absorbs through observa-
tion. Babies are like sponges, absorbing everything within reach.
Becoming a More Confident Parent
Lots of parents are unsure about what to do with a baby; if you’re
anxious about your perceived lack of parental skills, you have lots
Chapter 2: Understanding the Benefits of Baby Massage 21

of company. Baby massage offers parents an easy way to have nur-
turing, loving contact with their babies.
Spending quality time with your baby gives you the chance to
figure out his cues. You discover things like:
 His likes and dislikes
 Good (and not-so-good) times for massages
 Indications that he is tired or hungry
 Meanings behind his expressions
The more you know your baby, the easier it becomes for you to
respond to his needs, which in turn gives you more confidence as
a parent.
No matter how many books you read or how many other parents
you talk to, you’re bound to have insecurities when you become a
parent. Touching your baby is a basic, primal, and effective way to
build a positive relationship. Throughout infancy and into child-
hood, most young ones want and need to be touched frequently.
Massage is simply a systematic approach to satisfying your child’s
basic needs.
Keep in mind that massage isn’t just for moms and babies. Fathers
sometimes feel left out during a baby’s early years, especially if the
baby is being breastfed. If you’re a new dad, you may assume that
your baby’s needs are being met already and you don’t have much
to contribute. But your baby needs your touch, too! Baby massage
gives dads — as well as other caregivers — an opportunity for
bonding and intimacy that is all their own. If you work full-time and
don’t always feel like a vital part of the parenting team, baby mas-
sage gives you the opportunity to spend irreplaceable quality time
with your baby.
Managing Stress
Stress is what we all experience when we are faced with challenges
or feelings that we find potentially overwhelming. Stress can be
created by either positive or negative situations. Think about plan-
ning a wedding and filing for divorce. Although one situation is
assumed to be positive and the other negative, both situations
create a lot of stress. Many causes of stress are unforeseeable;
we can’t possibly predict everything that can bring stress into
our own lives, let alone the lives of our babies.
Part I: Nothing Quite Like Touch 
22

Are you surprised that babies experience stress? Consider that
infants experience new feelings and situations every day — many
of which create excitement, joy, and wonder, but others of which
aren’t quite so pleasant. Babies also feel stress when they have
colic, are teething, or have a depressed caregiver.
Babies’ bodies accumulate stress, just like yours and mine.
Identifying your baby’s stress cues and responding to them with
massage are effective ways to help her relax and let go of that
accumulated stress.
Taking Stress 101
Stress is the culprit behind most of the illnesses and issues that
baby massage helps to alleviate and prevent. At the risk of getting
a little technical, we thought you’d like to understand why that’s
the case.
The autonomic nervous system
The stress response is regulated by the autonomic nervous system
(ANS), which consists of two separate systems: 
 The sympathetic nervous system: When we experience a
threat, the sympathetic nervous system is engaged by the
release of the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol
(which we explain in the next section). Our heart rate and
blood pressure increase, our muscles become contracted,
and we are on alert. The sympathetic nervous system is con-
cerned with activities that expend energy stored in the body.
 The parasympathetic nervous system: The parasympathetic
nervous system kicks in when the threat is gone. The job of
this system is to conserve energy to allow for relaxation. Our
heart rate and blood pressure decrease, and our muscles
begin to relax. Through relaxation, this system increases the
energy stored in the body.
Stress hormones
There are two major stress hormones: adrenaline, which puts you
on alert for danger, and cortisol, which provides you with energy to
take on the threat.
During stress, adrenaline is secreted through the adrenal gland and
is responsible for increasing our heart beat and blood pressure,
among other things. The release of adrenaline activates the famous
fight or flight response, and we are on the lookout to either stand
our ground or run away from danger.
Chapter 2: Understanding the Benefits of Baby Massage 23

In order to create more energy so we can handle the next stressful
situation, our adrenal gland also secretes cortisol. The secretion of
cortisol triggers the release of amino acids, which raises our blood
sugar level in order to have more glucose for energy. The excess
energy created is our way of physically trying to handle stress.
Realizing the serious effects of stress
Stress wreaks havoc on both adults’ and babies’ bodies. The effects
of stress can include physical problems, such as chronic illnesses,
as well as emotional difficulties, such as attachment issues. We 
discuss these issues (and how to use massage to alleviate them)
in Part IV of this book.
While you can’t possibly remove all stress from your baby’s life,
you can help to manage and alleviate stress through touch and
massage. Massaging your baby activates the parasympathetic
nervous system to bring on relaxation and lowers the levels of
stress hormones in your baby’s body.
Identifying signs of stress
Now that you understand why your baby experiences stress and
the reasons you want to help her deal with it, how do you know
when it’s happening? Following are some typical signs that your
baby is stressed:
 A heightened startle response: It’s normal for babies to have
a startle response; reacting to new noises or experiences
shows that the nervous system is working. You’ll know that
your baby’s startle response is heightened or exaggerated if
she is jumpy or reacts in fear to noises or situations that are
familiar to her.
 Fussing/complaining: Babies can fuss for a lot of reasons.
However, if your baby is cranky and whiny in addition to
showing some of the other indications we list here, she may
be stressed.
 Crying: Babies have different kinds of cries to alert their 
parents that they are hungry, bored, tired, or hurt. Stressed
babies are difficult to soothe immediately; they continue to
cry and fuss even when held.
 An arched back: Squirming and arching the back (like a cat)
are signs of stress.
Part I: Nothing Quite Like Touch 
24

 An increased breathing rate: Babies have tiny lungs.
Prolonged crying increases their breathing rate, and stress
increases their heart rate.
 Shaking/twitching: If your baby is shaking or twitching,
chances are that she is frightened. We suggest that you hold
her for comfort to calm her down before giving a massage.
If you see that your baby is stressed, gentle strokes used in a down-
ward direction (like the Dolphin Stroke we present in Chapter 4) can
help your baby learn to relax.
The effects of massage are cumulative: The more your baby
receives massage, the easier time she’ll have being able to relax.
After she receives consistent, regular massage, your baby will
remember and look forward to your cues for relaxation: the feel of
the oil, the sound of soft music, the sound of your breath, and the
feel of your hand on her body. She’ll also start to remember what it
feels like to be relaxed, helping to ensure that she can relax herself
in between sessions.
Keeping your own stress level
in check
Babies are very sensitive to energy. Your own emotional state and
level of relaxation affect how your baby feels. To massage your
baby effectively, with the goal of reducing his stress, you must take
the time to breathe and relax before you begin.
Have you noticed that when you feel stress, you hold your breath?
Holding your breath is a common way to avoid feeling something
uncomfortable or painful.
Chapter 2: Understanding the Benefits of Baby Massage 25
The simplicity of touch relaxation
One of the best ways to help your baby cope with stress is also the easiest. To trig-
ger feelings of safety and warmth, gently and securely hold your baby — help her
feel as if she were still in the womb. Look into her eyes and tell her something like,
“It’s okay, I understand how hard it is to be a baby. I’m here with you, and you can
relax now.”
Use this touch relaxation technique anytime: during a massage; while bathing, 
holding, or rocking your baby; while the baby is in a sling; during a diaper change;
or whenever you sense that your baby is becoming overstimulated.

Following is a simple exercise in diaphragmatic breathing for you to
use just before you massage your baby, or anytime you feel stressed:
1. Place one hand on your lower belly, and the other on
your chest.
2. Breathe in through your nose, and imagine your belly is
a balloon that you are filling with air. Notice with your
hand that your belly rises before your chest.
3. Let the breath move up from your belly into your chest.
4. Feel the breath move up from your chest to your throat.
5. Exhale through your nose.
6. Repeat as necessary.
Diaphragmatic breathing is the way that babies breathe naturally —
until they experience stress, that is, and learn to hold their breath to
avoid feeling. This breathing exercise elicits relaxation by engaging
the parasympathetic nervous system, which we explain in the
“Taking Stress 101” section earlier in the chapter.
Another technique you can use to reduce your own stress is called
the relaxation response. This meditation asks you to focus on a cer-
tain word or phrase in order to take your mind off the stress you’re
experiencing. In Chapter 4, we walk you through this meditation
step-by-step.
Aiding with Postpartum Depression
Lots of women experience mood changes, anxiety, difficulty focusing,
and increased sensitivity after giving birth. These emotional changes,
which usually go away within a few weeks of birth, are typically
signs of the baby blues and are not necessarily cause for concern.
Postpartum depression, however, is a much more serious matter.
The onset of postpartum depression is usually caused by a combi-
nation of hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, change in lifestyle,
and a sense of being overwhelmed with parental responsibilities.
The symptoms of postpartum depression are similar to the symp-
toms of major depression; the defining difference is that the onset
of symptoms of postpartum depression occurs within four weeks
of giving birth. Following are symptoms of major depression:
 Feeling depressed and crying a lot
 Losing or gaining weight
Part I: Nothing Quite Like Touch 
26

 Lacking interest or pleasure in the baby or other activities
 Experiencing insomnia or, conversely, sleeping more than usual
 Feeling suicidal and/or having thoughts about death or hurting
the baby
 Having very little energy
 Having difficulty focusing
Mothers who have postpartum depression typically do not touch
their babies often. Subsequently, the mother/infant interaction is
minimal and lacks nurturing and warmth.
If a mother with postpartum depression can consciously create a
time and space to touch her baby through the use of massage, the
bond between mother and child is strengthened, and the infant
begins to respond to his mother with warmth and pleasure. Being
on the receiving end of a baby’s love helps depressed mothers
begin to feel the joy that is part of motherhood. That joy, in turn,
can help to reduce the symptoms of depression.
If you know a mother with postpartum depression, help her initiate
contact and touch with her baby. The symptoms of the depression
make it next to impossible for her to attempt to touch or massage
her baby on her own. However, with the help of a partner or family
member, she can create a daily routine for touch and massage. It’s
important for the partner or family member to play a supportive
role and to let the mother actually massage the baby.
Promoting Growth, Development,
and Overall Health
Massaging your baby on a regular basis encourages alertness,
increases weight gain, aids in digestion and neurological develop-
ment, and increases sensory awareness. That’s quite a package!
Stimulating your little one
Even with so much to see and do that is completely new, babies
can get bored. Massage increases circulation, enhances you baby’s
alertness, and provides a new learning experience. Massage gives
babies an opportunity to discover the different parts of their bodies,
as well as to explore their feelings. Massage promotes an appropriate
level of arousal for babies; they learn to be more attentive and less
distracted.
Chapter 2: Understanding the Benefits of Baby Massage 27

In Chapter 4, we show you how to keep your baby’s interest and
stimulate him with music and singing during your massage.
Encouraging weight gain
When gauging a newborn baby’s health, one of the first signs doc-
tors look for is weight gain. If you want to impress your doctor
with how fast your little one can gain weight, incorporate a 5- to 
15-minute massage into your daily routine. Massage relaxes your
baby and aids in digestion (which we discuss next), so food is
better absorbed. Better absorption gives your baby a better than
average chance of gaining weight.
In addition, massage stimulates growth-enhancing hormones. Have
you ever wondered why animals lick their young just after birth?
Touch is nature’s way of stimulating growth. Remember this every
time your dog starts to lick you and won’t stop: Your pet is just
responding to his intuition. (Maybe he thinks you could stand to
gain a few pounds!)
Helping with digestion
Massage stimulates the digestive system. When anyone (including
a baby) is under stress, the sympathetic nervous system shunts
blood away from the belly to the larger muscles. The lack of blood
and oxygen in that area shuts down the digestive system in order
to provide energy elsewhere in the body.
The increased circulation that massage provides in the abdomen
brings blood and oxygen to the intestines, which improves your
baby’s ability to digest and eliminate food.
Your digestive system works like a muscle. The smooth muscles
contract to push food down through the esophagus to the stomach
and out of the body through elimination. Massage encourages 
peristalsis — the pushing out of food stuffs in an orderly way
through smooth muscle contractions.
Enhancing neurological development
Massage enhances your baby’s brain growth. Studies have shown
that massaging your baby speeds nerve myelinization — the growth
of the fatty insulating material that encloses certain nerve fibers.
When this insulating material — the myelin sheath — appears, nerve
impulses can travel at a faster rate.
Part I: Nothing Quite Like Touch 
28

How does a speedy nerve myelinization translate into enhanced
development in your baby? Look for some of the following signs:
 An ability to stay focused and alert for reasonably long peri-
ods of time
 Enhanced curiosity
 Strong memory skills
 Accelerated developmental skills
Bringing on sensory awareness
Massage enhances body awareness — it helps babies become
more knowledgeable about their bodies in relation to the world.
For example, babies discover their range of motion — what their
limits are and what they can do. Massage also teaches them about
having or experiencing pleasure in their bodies.
Strengthening the immune system
You may have noticed that you become more vulnerable to illness
during stressful times. The same is true for babies. Massage
increases the immune function by strengthening the relaxation
response and decreasing stress hormones.
Because massage also aids the effectiveness and efficiency of other
body functions (such as the circulatory and elimination systems),
massage can strengthen your baby’s body to fight off illness. In
addition, massage increases your baby’s lymphatic flow, which
strengthens her body’s ability to fight infection.
Chapter 2: Understanding the Benefits of Baby Massage 29
Getting defensive
In Chinese medicine, the body’s immune system is called Wei Chi, and it is created
by the lungs and kidneys. This system is our natural defense mechanism. Imagine
Wei Chi as a fence around you; if there is a hole in the fence, what is threatening you
can get in. When your body is weakened and fatigued, your Wei Chi becomes vul-
nerable and can no longer protect you effectively. Disease and illness can enter
your system. In Chinese massage and acupuncture, the Wei Chi is strengthened by
balancing the lung and kidney energy, which protects you from becoming ill.

Providing self-soothing skills
Thumb-sucking, rocking, and carrying a blanket or stuffed animal
are ways that babies and toddlers soothe themselves. Adding mas-
sage to your baby’s experience provides another self-soothing skill.
The ability to calm himself down and deal with his emotions will
help your child well into adulthood. Self-soothing skills help children
become more resilient: Your child will be better able to handle and
recover from stressful situations.
Massage helps your baby calm himself down by teaching him what
it feels like to relax. The more frequently your baby experiences
relaxation in his body, the easier it becomes for him to bring his
body back into a relaxed state on his own.
Simply holding your baby teaches him valuable self-soothing skills.
The more frequently your baby experiences feeling safe and secure,
the easier it is for him to create these feelings for himself as he gets
older.

Making your child more resilient to stress
Following are some ways you can begin increasing your child’s resiliency to stress
as early as infancy:
 Create a relationship with your baby that promotes trust. You can do this by
taking your child’s needs seriously and responding to them in a timely manner.
 Have empathy and compassion for your baby, especially when your baby is
crying or has colic. Being on the receiving end of empathy encourages your
baby to feel empathy for others and compassion for herself.
 Keep in mind that your baby takes in everything that you do and learns from
your actions. Be a role model in handling stressful situations.

 Anticipating your baby’s emotional development
 Understanding the need for touch at every age
 Using massage to meet your baby’s needs
W
hether your baby is a newborn or heading into the toddler
years, her emotional needs are essentially the same: She
needs to feel loved and secure. But as she grows and changes, the
means of providing her that love and security can grow and change
as well.
Massage is a great tool for helping you meet your baby’s emotional
needs at every stage. In this chapter, we show you how to combine
knowledge of your baby’s emotional development with knowledge
of her desire for touch so you can meet her changing needs.
Keep in mind that we don’t go into a lot of detail in this chapter
about your baby’s development; we hit the highlights so you can
start thinking about how massage can work at any stage of infancy.
If you’re looking for more specifics about what to expect from your
baby at any given age, check out Parenting For Dummies by Sandra
Harding Gookin and Dan Gookin (Wiley).
Tuning In to Your Newborn’s Needs
If you are like many parents, you have prepared for your baby’s
arrival by decorating the nursery, deciding whether to use a crib
or co-sleep, and securing the infant seat in your car. You have
researched breastfeeding versus using formula, completed your

childbirth education classes, and are practicing your labor breathing
techniques. You have done everything you can think of to prepare
for the birth of your baby and welcome him home. What’s left?
Thanks to years of research on child development, you have the
opportunity to know and anticipate what your baby’s needs are
going to be. This means you can consider how you will be best
able to fulfill them before you even get home from the hospital.
Most information about child development tends to focus on what
a baby should be able to do by a certain age. This information is
important, because it indicates how well your baby is developing
and alerts you to potential developmental problems that need
attention. However, equally important is information about babies’
emotional development, and this information isn’t always as read-
ily available. In the following sections, we discuss both types of
development.
How you handle your baby’s emotional needs helps determine
how easily your baby handles life’s stresses, especially in regards
to relationships. You are your baby’s role model for how relation-
ships should be.
It’s gonna be alright: Comforting
your little one
When babies come into the world, they have little awareness of
you, their selves, and their surroundings. Their task is to become
accustomed to life outside of the womb. Your job is to make this
process a gradual one. Here are a few things to do that can make
your job easier:
 Get attuned: Attunement literally means tuning in to your
baby’s energy and emotions — having a rapport with your
baby. If you’re lucky, you and your baby are a good fit from
the beginning: For example, you want to hold and comfort
your baby as much as she wants you to.
Parents who do not have such an easy fit need to make extra
efforts to see the problem, understand it, and make changes
to fit their baby’s needs. For example, if your baby doesn’t
like to be held a lot, and you want to hold him day and night, try
not to take it personally. Your baby is not rejecting you; in fact,
he literally doesn’t know that you exist as a separate person yet!
It’s just that his needs for touch may be different than yours.
 Reduce stimulation: Fortunately, most babies are born with a
“stimulus barrier” that screens out distractions and protects
Part I: Nothing Quite Like Touch 
32

them from becoming overstimulated. For example, on the day
your coauthor Joanne and her husband brought their daughter
home from the hospital, they set the car alarm off while she was
inside, buckled in the car seat. She didn’t even flinch, nor did
she seem to notice the noise. (Of course, we were horrified at
our mistake!)
As babies’ nervous systems develop, they are able to take in
and handle more and more distractions and noises. Until then,
and at least for the first six weeks or so, your job is to keep
the stimulation level low. However, keep in mind that the
womb is a very noisy place, so you don’t need to maintain
silence around your baby. Just be mindful of a lot of distrac-
tions that could be overstimulating.
If you have toddlers or other older children around, make
them aware of the need to keep the noise level a little lower
than normal, for example. Soon enough, your baby will come
to enjoy their antics, and you will find yourself thanking them
for distracting and stimulating your little one!
 Be prepared for a lack of schedule: Very young babies tend to
get their days and nights mixed up, plus they need to feed every
two to four hours (depending on if you are breastfeeding or
using formula). The first six weeks or so can be a nightmare
for any parent. Have patience: Remind yourself that your baby
isn’t behaving this way to make your life hard; she’s just figuring
things out. Remember that this is just a period of development,
and things will change. It won’t always be this hard!
Chapter 3: Getting to Know Your Baby Better 33
Your baby has a job to do
According to experts in infant development, babies have certain tasks to complete
in each stage of life before they move on to the next. If the baby doesn’t achieve a
task (such as learning to trust, for example), that may be an issue throughout child-
hood and into adulthood. For your baby to move on to toddlerhood, he needs to com-
plete the following tasks:
 Learn to trust
 Learn to feel good about himself
 Manage the stress from different developmental stages (such as handling 
separation from you)
 Become aware of his body and begin to use it
 Express his emotions

You can definitely use massage as a way to attune with your baby
and sensitively manage his stimulation level. Unfortunately, mas-
sage can’t help you get your baby onto a feeding and sleeping
schedule any sooner. However, Chapter 2 offers suggestions for
relaxing and breathing through stressful times when you are feeling
overwhelmed and sleep-deprived.
Easy does it: Calming 
the jumpy baby
If you’re one of the lucky parents whose baby was easy from the
beginning, count your blessings! If not, and your baby screamed
constantly from the minute you arrived home, she needs extra care
and sensitivity. Following are some suggestions to help:
 Wrap your baby in a burrito. Very nervous babies like to be
swaddled, because it reminds them of the womb. Swaddling is
an effective way of giving your baby the sensation of being
held. Jumpy babies have frequent startle responses: Your
baby’s arms and legs will flail about, which scares her even
more. She isn’t even sure about having her own body at this
age, and all that uncontrollable movement can be frightening.
Here is how to swaddle your newborn:
• Lay out a thin cotton or flannel receiving blanket.
• Fold the top right corner about 6 inches.
Part I: Nothing Quite Like Touch 
34
Bonding in a hospital bed
Chances are that your experience with delivering a baby in a hospital will be much
different than the experience your mother had. For example, most hospitals today
are sensitive to the effects of lighting and noise on newborns. In many labor and
delivery rooms, you find soft lighting and nurses speaking quietly. The reason for
this is we want to welcome babies into the world with warmth and sensitivity.
Emerging into this world can be shocking and sometimes even traumatic, and harsh
lights and loud voices certainly don’t help.
Another significant change is that most hospitals and birthing centers now encour-
age bonding through touch right away. Rather than a newborn being taken imme-
diately to the hospital nursery, in many cases the baby is placed on the mother’s
chest just after birth. Also, new parents are encouraged to share a room with their
newborn. Keeping your baby at your side during the hospital stay, rather than in the
nursery (which is sometimes located on a separate floor!), promotes bonding by
giving you more opportunities to touch and hold your baby.

• Place your baby on her back in the center of the blanket
with her head above the fold.
• Pull the right bottom corner across her body and tuck
the edge under her back on her left side.
• Fold the bottom corner up (under her chin, if you
need to).
• Bring the left corner over your baby’s right arm and tuck
it under her back on the right side.
Some babies don’t like their arms tucked in, so you can just
leave their arms free.
 Get support. High need babies are super sensitive. If your baby
is jumpy from birth, screams a lot, needs to be fed every hour,
and seems to rarely sleep, you may have a high need baby. If
so, you have our understanding, and you will probably need a
lot of support. Check out The Fussy Baby Book: Parenting Your
High-Need Child from Birth to Age Five by William and Martha
Sears for strategies and survival tips. You can also find lots of
helpful information on their Web site: www.askdrsears.com.
Good luck!
Because jumpy and high need babies are so sensitive, it’s a good
idea to keep your massages gentle and soothing. In Chapter 8,
we give you suggestions for how to give a massage and prevent
overstimulation.
The power of touch: Responding to
your baby’s need for contact
In the first month of life, your baby needs to be held a lot. Feeling
safe and secure in your arms keeps him warm and gives him the
gradual adjustment to life outside the womb that he needs. If you
find the constant holding difficult to manage, invest in a sling (see
Chapter 1) and carry your baby around.
We think it’s a great idea for you to introduce massage to your baby
at this young age. However, you must keep the following in mind:
Babies feel vulnerable (and cold!) without their clothes on. You
may want to try the massage techniques we show in Chapters 5, 6,
and 7 with your baby’s clothes on. Your baby will still enjoy the
contact and reap lots of benefits from it. But he will also feel
secure, and you are less likely to overstimulate him.
Chapter 3: Getting to Know Your Baby Better 35

Getting Into a Routine (6 Weeks
to 3 Months)
When your baby passes the six-week mark, you should notice that
life starts getting a little easier. Your baby should begin making pat-
terns in behavior that start to look like a routine.
Part I: Nothing Quite Like Touch 
36
Considering co-sleeping
Under the right conditions, co-sleeping — sleeping in the same bed with your
baby — is not only safe but can actually reduce the risk of sudden infant death 
syndrome (SIDS) and crib-related accidents.
If you decide to share your bed with your baby, keep in mind that research has
shown mothers tend to demonstrate more protective behaviors toward their babies
than fathers do during the night. In other words, it’s often best if a mother sleeps
next to her baby because mothers tend to be more aware (even in their sleep) of
their babies’ movements.
Here are some more safety tips to make co-sleeping work for you:
 Use a firm mattress, and don’t use a fluffy comforter or pillows.
 Never, ever smoke in bed.
 Do not sleep with your baby if you use sleeping medication or are under the
influence of drugs or alcohol.
 Do not sleep with your baby if you are sleep-deprived.
 If you want to co-sleep but are uncomfortable sleeping with your infant in bed
with you, purchase a co-sleeper or three-sided crib that can act as a sidecar.
 Use guardrails on your bed, and/or place your mattress on the floor.
There are many benefits to sleeping in the same bed with your baby. For one, if you
are a nursing mother, you will get more sleep (a big plus) because you won’t have
to get up to breastfeed. Here are some others:
 Your breathing regulates your baby’s breathing. Because your baby hears you
breathe, it reminds him to breathe (which helps reduce the risk of SIDS). Plus,
babies spend less time in deep sleep when they co-sleep due to mom’s move-
ments during the night. (Deep sleep can be dangerous for babies at risk for SIDS.)
 Babies sleep better, too. Because they do not have to cry to get their mothers’
attention for feedings, they don’t fully wake up, and they fall back asleep faster.
 Co-sleeping fosters attachment (which we discuss in Chapter 1).
 Your baby continues to receive comfort and nurturing from you throughout the
night.

This is a good time to start incorporating massage into your baby’s
routine. Experiment and find a time that works for both of you. For
example, your coauthor Joanne found that during the first three
months of giving her daughter massages, the massages’ effect was
very energizing. For that reason, it was better to schedule massage
time early in the day. Your baby, however, may enjoy a massage
before a nap if the massage helps him to sleep.
If you’re reading this section while tending to the needs of a brand
new baby, you may be wondering how you’ll ever know when
“before a nap” is? If your baby is like most, at this age she will
probably sleep about 16 hours a day (although not in one chunk of
time!). You will notice that sleeping tends to occur after a feeding,
so as you get into a more predictable feeding routine, you should
be able to better anticipate her sleeping schedule as well.
One problem that you may experience during this time period is
the dreaded colic. Colic typically runs its course between the age
of 6 weeks and 3 months. In Chapter 11, we provide you with infor-
mation about colic and some massage techniques that can help to
alleviate the discomfort.
I’m talking to you! Understanding
your baby’s cries
Babies cry because they need something, and this is the only way
they can get your attention. At this age, babies do not have the
cognitive development or ability to manipulate. They depend on
you responding to their cries so they can get their needs met.
You may notice that your baby’s cries seem to be different now
than during the first few weeks of life. Early on, you probably felt
the demand and desperation in her cries. Now that you have been
responding to her needs, she is beginning to learn to wait for you
to respond, as she expects her needs to be satisfied. Her cries usu-
ally start to sound more like requests.
At this age most babies’ cries usually mean that they are:
 Hungry
 Tired
 Bored
 Needing to be held
 Overstimulated
At this age, a baby’s cries usually stop when you pick her up and
hold her.
Chapter 3: Getting to Know Your Baby Better 37

It’s playtime: Encouraging joy,
pleasure, and fun
Your baby is just beginning to notice that he has a body (although
he isn’t yet aware that his body is separate from yours). His hands
start to open and grasp for things (like your hair!). You can encour-
age body exploration and fun by making massage part of your 
playtime. Begin by naming body parts as you massage them: “This
isn’t a turkey drumstick — it’s your leg!” You and your partner may
be the only two to get the joke, but your baby will pick up on your
enthusiasm and enjoy it.
Your baby is also beginning to learn the difference between pleasure
and pain. Yet, he hasn’t completely figured out that you are typically
the cause of both. (Nursing brings pleasure; 2 a.m. diaper changes
in February bring, if not pain, at least discomfort.)
At around the age of 3 months, your baby’s smile response peaks,
and you will feel rewarded for all the hard work and love you have
given your baby.
Changing from Caterpillar to
Butterfly (3 to 6 Months)
At this age your baby is becoming increasingly sociable. Her sen-
sory awareness has increased, so she has discovered her body and
is aware of the world around her. She gurgles, screeches, babbles,
and coos. You no longer have a little newborn around the house,
but a new member of the family!
Making friends
In an attempt to stimulate their babies, many parents spend a lot of
time and money shopping for toys developed to raise their child’s
IQ or teach babies how to perform a specific task.
The most important kind of stimulation your baby can receive
involves people and relationships. In fact, the kind of relationships
she has and what she learns from them (such as trust versus mis-
trust) establish the foundation of her future personality.
If your social butterfly is bored and craving contact, give her a
massage! She’ll appreciate the social contact, and you don’t have
to buy another toy to provide the stimulation she needs.

38

Secure babies love to meet other people and are especially fasci-
nated by other children. However, they are also becoming pickier
about who they socialize with. Don’t worry, your baby isn’t becoming
a snob; instead, she’s in the early stages of separation individuation.
What does this mean? At around 6 months of age, you will notice
your baby becoming more active and wanting to explore all kinds
of new stuff. In psychology, we call this hatching. This means your
baby is getting ready to see new things and separate from you —
not physically, mind you, but your baby is in the very early stages
of realizing that she is a separate person.
What’s next? Relieving boredom
Babies need to play. Play activities help to stimulate and rescue
them from long, boring days of nursing and sleeping.
You may find your baby’s demands for stimulation exhausting, but
remember: At this age her needs and wants are the same. Your
baby does not know how to ask for something that is more than
she needs.
At this age, your baby is stimulated by objects that are slightly dif-
ferent than those she is familiar with (such as a teething ring of a
different color than her other ones). Introducing something new
and unfamiliar is fairly easy to accomplish.
From 3 to 6 months, babies are fascinated by people’s faces. They
love to watch people’s expressions and body language. Your baby
is beginning to notice that there is a world outside of her relation-
ship with you.
Chapter 3: Getting to Know Your Baby Better 39
Good enough parenting
Thankfully, you don’t have to be perfect to be a good parent. You just have to be
“good enough.” In fact, it’s good for both you and your partner to provide just enough
frustration for your baby to learn that he has to ask for what he needs, and that all
his needs are not going to be met.
But you don’t have to force the matter, either. Try not to create situations where your
baby’s needs won’t be met; these situations occur naturally. For example, your baby
may need to be held now! but you are stuck in rush hour traffic and can’t pull over.
You can try to soothe him by talking to him, but he will have to wait and bear the
frustration of not being held when he needs to. You will probably feel guilty or pained
by his frustration, but keep in mind that you are helping him grow and tolerate 
frustration by being nurturing and sensitive.

As part of this early stage of separation, you may notice that as
you hold your baby, she pulls back to scan your face and grab onto
your hair (quite hard, unfortunately!) or even your earrings if you
wear them. Your baby is checking to see how you and she are dif-
ferent from one another.
You can use massage to satisfy a couple of needs. Massage gives you
and your baby something to do each day, and you can vary the tech-
niques you use in order to keep her interest. Plus, you can give your
baby a massage on the front side (see Chapter 5), which affords her
plenty of “face time” while protecting your hair and jewelry!
Getting a workout
Now that your baby has discovered her body, she is also figuring
out that she has some control over her movements. Gone are the
days that your little munchkin bounces all over the place without
control. Now she is able to see an object, recognize it as something
familiar, and grasp it. This may seem simple to you, but to a baby,
hand–eye coordination is huge!
You probably can’t remember having the ability to put your big toe
in your mouth, nor can you imagine how much pleasure this activ-
ity involves, but your baby will remind you!
All this grasping, batting, kicking, and attempting to roll over can
wear a baby out and create physical stress. Your baby needs your
help to release any tension and stress from her body with a daily
massage.
Drooling, sucking, crying. . .
I’m teething!
Somewhere between the age of 4 months and 2 years, most babies
begin to teethe. How will you know when it starts? Your baby will
have a constant need to suck on something, produce lots of drool
(enough to soak a bib), and possibly cry out in pain unexpectedly.
When teething starts, a parent’s first response is to want to do
something — anything — to alleviate the baby’s obvious discomfort.
Want some great news? You can use massage to soothe away your
baby’s stress from teething. In Chapter 11 we explain techniques
you can use to help your baby endure teething discomforts.

Becoming an Individual
(6 Months to 1 Year)
The second half of a baby’s first year is action-packed. And even
as your baby grows into a little person who can crawl, explore,
and maybe even walk on his own, the opportunities for massage
continue — as long as you make the effort to keep up!
Look out! Gaining mobility
By 6 months, most babies have the neuromuscular control to be
able to get into a sitting position by themselves. However, balanc-
ing their bodies in a sitting position is still an issue, so many topple
over until they gain full control. Around the same time that they
are perfecting sitting up, babies begin to practice crawling.
Babies vary greatly in their development during this age range:
Some babies begin to pull themselves up and stand before they
even begin to crawl. At almost 6 months, your coauthor Joanne’s
daughter crawled on her back by arching her back, lifting her
pelvis, and propelling herself across the floor. Babies thoroughly
enjoy the newfound freedom of movement!
Chapter 3: Getting to Know Your Baby Better 41
Person permanence
Your baby is not able to hold a mental image of you in her mind until around 12 to 18
months. Until that age range, babies are not cognitively able to understand that you
exist if they can’t see you.
Keep this in mind when your child is experiencing separation anxiety. What triggers
the anxiety is a lack of understanding why or where you have gone, which creates
a feeling of loss for babies who are not yet autonomous (independent) at this stage.
It’s not that your baby thinks you won’t come back when you leave for a while; she
simply doesn’t have the ability to put together the concept that you will be back later.
Every time that you leave and come back reinforces person permanence. Your baby
will not be completely comfortable being separate from you until age 3, which is
when most children begin nursery school.

Your baby’s new ability to control her body means that most likely
she will become more interested in moving around and exploring
the environment than being held. This fact may lead you to believe
that your days of bonding through massage are over. Not true.
Mobile babies still need touch. They may not need to be held as
much as newborns, but at this stage, their need for touch is about
reconnection. Massage helps you let your baby know that you
encourage her exploration, but you are still there to love and com-
fort her when she gets back.
Create a ritual by massaging your baby at the same time daily or
weekly. Your baby will look forward to the contact, which will make
it easier for you to keep her still long enough to be massaged.
Understanding separation anxiety:
It’s a two-way street
One day you may try to drop off your 9-month-old at the babysit-
ter’s, and as you start to leave, your baby will turn to you, grab
your leg, and start screaming. You’ll probably feel terrible about
leaving her, knowing that you have to go to work, and uncertain
why she is so upset because she has never reacted this way before.
Unless your baby is having a premonition that you are about to
leave her with the babysitter from hell, chances are that you and
she are both experiencing separation anxiety. (See the sidebar
“Person permanence” for more information about this normal
developmental stage.)
Before the first episode of separation anxiety occurs, you may notice
that your baby becomes more and more affectionate with you and
begins to realize when you leave the room. These are signs that the
separation process is beginning. Not until your baby experiences
distress at your absence does it really become a problem for both
of you.
How you handle the separation can make all the difference in how
your baby responds. Be sure to make all “bye-byes” feel positive to
your baby by smiling and showing happy body language when you
leave, not just when you come back.
If you need to leave your baby with a sitter, be sure to find a nur-
turing and warm caretaker who can best substitute for you in your
absence. Don’t switch sitters frequently; let your baby form an
attachment with a consistent caretaker.
Part I: Nothing Quite Like Touch 
42

Securely attached babies sometimes have very strong reactions to
separation. Very simply, these babies have learned that they feel
good when they are with you, and they want those good feelings to
continue!
Making massage routine after a separation gives you both a chance
to reconnect and strengthen your attachment. (For more on attach-
ment, see Chapter 12.)

Preparing for the 
Big Massage
In This Chapter
 Making sure you’re in the right mood
 Choosing a good time for the massage
 Getting the materials you need
 Recognizing when to avoid massage
G
iving your baby a great massage involves more than using
the techniques we show you in Part II of this book. It involves
preparing yourself and your baby for the experience.
The timing of a massage matters, as does your mood. And although
you don’t have to buy a lot of fancy equipment to give a massage,
you do want to make sure you have at hand everything to make the
experience enjoyable for both of you.
In this chapter, we walk you through the things you need to con-
sider before you schedule your first massage with your baby. We
also help you get your feet wet by showing you a simple massage
technique you can try your first time out.
Good Vibrations: Getting 
in the Mood to Massage
Have you noticed that whenever you are having a stressful day,
your baby is too? That’s because babies are very sensitive to our
moods and energy. The best way to begin to prepare for giving your
baby a massage is by being honest with yourself about whether the
timing is right for you. If you know that you’ll feel rushed, annoyed,
or impatient, it’s best for you and your baby that you skip the mas-
sage for now.

If, however, you want to try to improve your mood so you can give
the massage despite the stresses you’re feeling, using the sugges-
tions in the following sections may help.
Identifying readiness cues
Before you work on getting yourself ready to offer a massage, try to
determine if your baby is ready for one. How do you know? Later in
the chapter, in the section “Knowing When Not to Massage,” we
discuss some specific situations when it’s best to wait before mas-
saging. But following are a few basic signs that indicate your baby
is amenable to massage:
 She isn’t fussy.
 She makes eye contact with you.
 She is interested in what you are doing — she’s not trying to
crawl away, roll over, or grab a nearby toy.
If your baby is distracted, you can certainly try to get her attention;
the suggestions in Chapter 9 may help. However, if she doesn’t
seem ready for a massage and you aren’t in a great mood either, it
may be best to wait for a better time.
Clarifying your intentions
As we discuss in Chapter 2, there are lots of reasons to give your
baby a massage. However, when you prepare to actually give a
massage, it’s best to push aside all those details about the benefits
regarding health and bonding. Obviously, you’ll keep the benefits
in the back of your mind, but your goal should be to focus simply
on the experience of sharing your love for your baby through
touch.
Working from a place of kindness, compassion, and care is all you
need to be able to give your baby a wonderful massage.
Moving slowly and smoothly
You want to move gently and slowly during your massage. Don’t
rush through the techniques we show you in upcoming chapters:
Take the time to feel your baby’s skin and let your baby feel and
get used to your touch.
Part I: Nothing Quite Like Touch 
46

Be patient! Massage is a new experience for both of you. In the
beginning, your baby may be able to tolerate only a few minutes of
massage. This is perfectly normal because massage can be very
stimulating. Try to avoid feeling like you have to complete a cer-
tain number of techniques in order for the massage to “count.” It’s
fine to work only the baby’s legs or arms, or even just his feet!
Your baby’s tolerance level will increase with each massage. You
will recognize that your baby’s tolerance level is increasing by
watching his body language. Notice how relaxed he is and whether
he is making eye contact with you. (A tired or overstimulated baby
may avoid eye contact.) Trust your instincts, and follow his cues.
How much pressure is too much for your baby? You want to use
light to moderate pressure with a gentle touch. Think about turn-
ing an omelet: You need focus (so as not to break the egg), and you
need to be decisive but careful. You will know when to increase the
pressure of the massage by watching your baby’s cues: His level of
eye contact and relaxation are key.
You need to find the amount of pressure that’s just right for your
baby. If the pressure is too great, you’ll know because it will leave
red marks on your baby’s skin. If you’re not using enough pressure,
you’ll tickle your baby — the giggling will give it away!
Breathing properly: The 
relaxation response
In Chapter 2 we give you a simple instruction for diaphragmatic
breathing that can help you relax in any situation, including before
a massage. Here we want to share an exercise that can deepen
your relaxation: the relaxation response.
Defined by Herbert Benson, MD, the relaxation response is a simple
meditation designed to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous
system — which we discuss in Chapter 2 — to evoke relaxation.
You can create the relaxation response by practicing the following
exercise for 5 to 20 minutes per day. The more you practice relax-
ation, the easier it will be for you to relax into a deeper state in
less time:
1. Find a comfortable place to relax and close your eyes.
2. Begin diaphragmatic breathing (as we describe in
Chapter 2 — see “Keeping your own stress level in
check”).
Chapter 4: Preparing for the Big Massage 47

3. Progressively relax all the muscles in your body. Begin
with the top of your head, and imagine relaxation spread-
ing down throughout your body, all the way down to your
toes. Focus on each body part as you work your way down.
4. To avoid letting any distracting thoughts enter your
mind, begin to say (either silently or out loud) the word
“One” on your out breath.
You may replace the word “One” with any other word or
phrase that feels right. For example, you may say, “I am
here” or “Relax.”
We recommend that you use this technique on a regular basis. While
it would be ideal to use it just before you massage your baby, we
realize how impractical that could be. But if you can find the time to
meditate regularly, your level of relaxation will increase, and all you
will need to do before and during the massage is practice your
diaphragmatic breathing (see Chapter 2).
Having good posture
No matter what your mother may have told you, having good pos-
ture means more than just sitting up straight! Good posture helps
your breathing and level of relaxation. You can maintain good 
posture whether you are standing or sitting. The following tips
should help:
 Keep your shoulders down away from your ears.
 Relax and soften your belly, but keep your spine long so you
are not slouching.
 If you are standing, be sure to keep your feet parallel and your
knees slightly bent. Make sure that you are not putting most
of your weight on one leg, as doing so affects your posture.
 If you are sitting on the floor, you can sit cross-legged with
your butt on the edge of a pillow. The pillow helps support
you to keep your spine long with little effort.
Massage therapists learn to work from their hara, which is a
Japanese word for “abdominal center.” This area is the solar 
plexus — the energetic and physical center of your body. When
you are breathing properly and working from your hara, you are
able to move calmly, with confidence, and you are more likely 
to sense your own energy and the energy of your baby.
Part I: Nothing Quite Like Touch 
48

To get in touch with your hara, slightly pull your navel in toward
your spine. Doing so, along with proper breathing, gives you the
sensation of being in touch with the center of your body. You don’t
have to suck in your stomach (as if you were going to do a set of
crunches) or scoop out your abdomen (as in Pilates).
Finding the Right Time to Massage
Choosing the right time to massage your baby is essential to
achieving a good massage. Following are some guidelines to keep
in mind:
 Avoid giving a massage immediately after your baby has
eaten. Wait at least one hour before starting a massage.
 Try to work a massage into your daily schedule. Some of the
best times to do so include:
• Before or after a nap
• Before or after a bath
• After a diaper change
We discuss nap, bath, and diaper time massages in detail in
Chapter 10.
 Determine if your baby becomes stimulated or sedated during
massage, and keep this in mind when choosing the time of day.
You obviously don’t want to massage a baby who becomes
stimulated just before bed or nap time.
 Make sure that you have plenty of time to give the massage. If
you’re in a rush, your baby will sense your stress level, and
the massage won’t be as enjoyable or effective.
 Select a time of day when you won’t be easily distracted, such
as by other family members or other responsibilities.
 Find a time of day when you can turn the phone ringer off.
Finding the Right Place 
for Massage
The ideal place for you to massage your baby is where you both
will be the most comfortable. The ideal place may depend on your
baby’s age and developmental skills. For example, your coauthor
Chapter 4: Preparing for the Big Massage 49

Joanne massaged her daughter Ava on a bed until she began 
crawling. Now that Ava is on the go, the carpeted floor feels safer
to me, because I don’t have to worry about her falling off the bed.
(Crawling babies are fast!)
Here are some suggestions for where to give a massage:
 On your bed
 On a carpeted floor
 On the changing table
 On a hard surface floor, using the pad from your changing
table or some other cushioning material
 On your lap (see Chapter 7 for positions)
Massaging Safely
Obviously, you don’t want to cause your baby any harm during a
massage, and practicing safety is fairly simple. Here are some tips
to follow before every massage:
 Wash your hands.
 Remove any rings or jewelry that may interfere with the mas-
sage or scratch your baby.
 Keep your nails filed.
 Make sure your baby isn’t too hungry or too full. Either condi-
tion could cause him to spit up or even throw up.
 Pour the oil you will be using into a small bowl, and place it
near your massage space. This way, you can quickly dip your
fingers in and still maintain contact with your baby.
Selecting an Oil to Use
Skin is the largest organ in the body and can absorb toxins. For
this reason, it’s a good idea to use only natural products when
massaging your baby. Following are examples of vegetable- or 
nut-based oils that are appropriate to use:
 Almond
 Grape seed
 Jojoba
Part I: Nothing Quite Like Touch 
50

 Olive
 Safflower
Your coauthor Ilene uses grape seed, almond, or jojoba oil. You can
find these oils in supermarkets or natural food stores.
Because skin absorbs toxins, we do not recommend using baby oil
or anything else made from petroleum products. If you can’t eat it,
don’t use it!
If you are concerned about an allergic reaction to using a new oil
(especially a nut-based oil), try a spot test. Massage oil onto a
small patch of your baby’s arm or leg. Wait 24 hours to see if any
redness or other allergic reaction develops before using the oil on
the rest of your baby’s body.
See the section “Applying the oil” later in the chapter for instruc-
tions on how to put oils to use during a massage.
Setting the Tone
In this section, we show you some extras that you can include
during your massage that help create the right mood for you and
your baby.
Playing music
If you think that music will help relax you and your baby, consider
before the massage begins what type of mood you’re trying to
create. For example:
 Classical massage music: What we’re talking about here isn’t
necessarily Mozart or Bach. Instead, we’re talking about stan-
dard massage music — music that is very relaxing and perfect
for a serious massage. Your local music store probably carries
CDs of massage music, which are usually located in the 
New Age Music section and typically have flute or harp 
instrumentals.
 Fun massage music: Instead of instrumentals and serious
music, you may want to opt for lighthearted children’s songs.
You can find children’s CDs at music stores and discount
stores. Before you know it (and are ready to admit it!), you’ll
have all the words memorized and will be singing along to the
CD, much to your baby’s delight.
Chapter 4: Preparing for the Big Massage 51

 Calm lullaby massage music: Playing lullabies is perfect if
you’re giving a massage before a nap or bedtime.
You can also purchase a sound machine that plays prerecorded
white noise that simulates rain, ocean waves, a heartbeat, or even
noises that babies hear in utero!
Singing favorite songs
If you’re a great singer, your baby will love to hear your voice and
will find it soothing and relaxing. And even if you’re tone deaf or
have a terrible singing voice, chances are your baby will still love
to hear you sing. Your coauthor Joanne (who is terribly tone deaf)
massages her daughter, Ava, while singing Ava’s favorite song:
Frère Jacques. (Yes, even babies can have a favorite song!)
As you’re singing, feel free to get creative and to personalize the
lyrics. For example, here are the traditional lyrics to Frère Jacques:
Frère Jacques (Brother John)
Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques,
Dormez vous? Dormez vous?
Sonnez les matines. sonnez les matines,
Din din don, din din don.
Your coauthor Joanne changes the lyrics for her daughter by
singing:
Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques,
Dormez vous? Dormez vous?
Ava Amanda, Snowflake loves you,
We do too, we do too.
You may also incorporate nursery rhymes into your massage,
which are especially entertaining to older babies and toddlers. 
We talk more about using rhymes during massage in Chapter 9.
You can find lyrics to many children’s songs and nursery rhymes
online at www.mamalisa.com. You can even create your own lullabies
for your baby and have them recorded. You can find this service
online as well at www.babybaby.com. The most important thing is
to let yourself be creative and have fun.

Using aromatherapy
Aromatherapy uses essential oils to balance the mind, body, and
spirit. How is an essential oil different from other oils? The essence
of a plant is extracted and used to treat and prevent various diseases.
There are literally hundreds of different types of oils (some of which
are blends) that are used to treat illness. A commonly used essen-
tial oil is tea tree oil, which is often used to treat infections and to
boost the immune system.
For adults, essential oils can be applied directly to the skin or
heated in the room during a massage to release the scent. In our
opinion, babies’ skin is too sensitive to apply essential oils during
a massage. However, if you want to use aromatherapy to enhance
the atmosphere, we think that’s fine.
We recommend that you wait until your baby is 6 months or older
before you begin using aromatherapy. Essential oils contain power-
ful scents that may interfere with your baby’s ability to recognize
your scent.
If you would like to use aromatherapy during your massage, here
are some tips to get you started:
 Invest in high quality oils, even though you will not be apply-
ing the oil to your baby’s skin. We recommend Young Living
Essential Oils; you can purchase them online at www.young
living.us or look for them at natural food stores. These oils
are made from high quality ingredients.
 Use a mild oil, such as lavender, which helps create a calm
and relaxing atmosphere.
 Before you start your massage, take a trial run and test
the amount of oil you’re using. The aroma should not be 
overwhelming.
 Use a diffuser for the oils rather than a burner that relies on
tea lights. A diffuser is safer because you don’t have to worry
about remembering to blow out a candle (losing your memory
is part of being a parent!) or knocking the candle over. A dif-
fuser releases oil slowly into the air by electrically heating a
small plate where you place the oil.
Electric diffusers range in price from about $20 to $120. You
can find a nice selection at www.botanical.com.
Chapter 4: Preparing for the Big Massage 53

Knowing When Not to Massage
Giving your baby a gentle, loving massage is never harmful (as long
as you follow carefully the techniques we describe). However, at
certain times that gentle, loving massage simply won’t be received
as well as at other times. In the sections that follow, we explain
how to determine when it’s best to set aside your massage plans
until your baby is better prepared.
Using abdominal massage wisely
You want to use abdominal massage techniques carefully. If your
baby is hungry when you try one of these techniques, she will
probably become overstimulated or angry, and she (and you) will
not enjoy the massage. On the flip side, if you massage your baby
when she has just eaten, chances are she’ll spit up or vomit. You
must allow your baby at least one hour to digest whatever she has
eaten before beginning the massage.
When you work on your baby’s abdomen, always work in a clock-
wise direction. In Chapter 5, we give you the specifics of how to do
so and why.
Overstimulation: Following 
your baby’s cues
Your baby becomes overstimulated when he has had too much
excitement from play, socializing, or other activity. When your
baby is already overstimulated, you want to avoid massaging him
until he’s had a chance to calm down.
Following are some cues that your baby is overstimulated:
 He does not make eye contact with you; he may close his eyes
or turn away.
 He fusses, whines, or cries.
 He arches his back.
 He tenses his body.
 He gets the hiccups.
 He yawns or falls asleep.
Part I: Nothing Quite Like Touch 
54

All babies have different stimulation levels. Baby massage helps
to increase the amount of stimulation a baby can tolerate, and it
helps parents become more sensitive to their baby’s tolerated
level of excitement.
When in doubt, leave it out: 
Using your common sense
If, at any time, you don’t feel like a particular technique, stroke, or
exercise is right for you or your baby, or if you are just unsure
about doing it, we want you to skip it. Your baby certainly won’t
notice that you’ve left out a specific technique, but she will notice
if your stress level rises during the massage because you’re doing
something that doesn’t feel right.
When your baby has an injury of any kind, be especially careful to
avoid any techniques that may aggravate it:
 Be sure to massage around — not over — any cuts, bruises, or
rashes.
 Obviously, you also don’t want to massage over a broken
bone. Depending upon what bone is broken, you may want to
avoid massaging the entire limb. If, for example, your baby
has broken her wrist, you could leave the whole arm alone
and massage the rest of her body. 
In addition, do not massage your baby if she has a fever. 
Massaging your baby fine-tunes the sensitivity you have as a
parent, giving you more confidence and sharpening your instincts.
In other words, it confirms your common sense.
Trying Out Your First Massage
In Part II of the book, we describe specific techniques for massag-
ing each body part. But before we get there, we want to help you
practice the steps you’ll take to prepare for each massage you do.
Setting the scene
The first decision you need to make is whether to take off your
baby’s clothing, including his diaper. If you’re massaging a very
young infant, you may want to keep his clothes on so he doesn’t
become too stimulated.
Chapter 4: Preparing for the Big Massage 55

If you remove your baby’s clothing and diaper, lay your baby down
on a couple of towels (in case of an accident!) on the changing
table, the bed, or the floor. Have a clean diaper, wipes, and a fresh
change of clothes nearby. Make sure your oil and a towel for your
hands are within reach.
Check to be sure the room temperature is warm enough for your
baby to be comfortable, especially if you’re removing all his 
clothing.
Create a mood for the massage — perhaps by choosing music to
play, plugging in an aromatherapy diffuser, and dimming the lights.
You may find that after you begin, your baby starts to fuss. Just
follow his cues. If he’s hungry, you may have to stop and feed him.
If he’s becoming overstimulated, take a deep breath, relax yourself,
and stop the massage. Pick him up and gently hold him until he
calms down.
Applying the oil
Following are the steps for applying oil that you can use before
starting any massage:
1. Place a small amount of oil (approximately one teaspoon)
on one hand, and vigorously rub both hands together to
warm the oil and your hands. If you feel any friction
between you and your baby during the massage, repeat
this step as often as you need.
2. Hold your hands open with your palms facing your baby.
See Figure 4-1 for an example of how to position your hands.
3. Make eye contact with your baby and say something like,
“Would you like a massage?”
With your hands open in this way, you are sending your baby your
loving energy. Asking her if she wants a massage and creating eye
contact engages her and creates a space for bonding. For maxi-
mum energy flow, imagine sending love to your baby through the
palms of your hands.
Practicing your technique: The
Dolphin Stroke
Now that you have all the information you need to get started, 
we want to give you the opportunity to try out a simple massage
technique.
Part I: Nothing Quite Like Touch 
56

Figure 4-1: Position your hands with your palms 
facing your baby. 
The combination of the oil on your hands and movement in one
direction on your baby’s soft skin creates a feeling similar to
stroking the skin of a dolphin. Hence, the name: The Dolphin
Stroke.
This soothing stroke can be used on a baby of any age, including
very young babies who need to keep their clothes on during the
massage.
Besides being a simple technique for you, this stroke is a gentle
way to introduce massage to your baby. It increases the circulation
in her body and gives your baby the opportunity to feel and sense
all her body parts.
You can use this stroke as a technique by itself, or you may use it to
transition between strokes that we detail in Part II of this book. In
other words, rather than just moving from one stroke to the next,
you can incorporate the Dolphin Stroke in between. Your baby will
be very impressed by your finesse as a budding massage therapist.
Chapter 4: Preparing for the Big Massage 57

This stroke can also be used as a finishing stroke — the last stroke
used in a series of techniques. Here’s how you do it:
1. Place your left hand (palm down) on the left side of
your baby’s chest, with your fingers on the front of the
shoulder.
2. Place your right hand (palm down) on the right side of
your baby’s chest, with your fingers on the front of the
shoulder (see Figure 4-2).
Figure 4-2: Place your hands 
on each side of your baby’s 
chest, with your fingertips near 
the shoulders.
3. Gently glide your hands across your baby’s shoulders
and down the lengths of the arms, all the way to the
hands. 
4. Repeat steps 1 and 2.
5. Glide your hands down through your baby’s chest, belly,
legs, feet, and toes (see Figure 4-3).
6. Repeat this entire sequence three to five times, as your
baby will allow.
If your baby keeps his arms overhead (see Figure 4-4), you can
start your stroke from the hands and work down the length of the
body, rather than starting at the shoulders and doing the arms 
separately.

hile any type of baby massage affords the opportunity to
bond, massaging your baby’s front side provides a special
closeness because you can make eye contact. Your little one will
be able to see your face while experiencing your loving touch.
Another benefit of massaging the front side is that very young babies
are sometimes uncomfortable lying on their bellies. Because most
babies are happy to lay on their backs, you should have no trouble
trying out the techniques in this chapter.
As with all the chapters in Part II of this book, we don’t expect you to
use every technique listed in this chapter every time you massage
your baby. (Chances are that he won’t stay still long enough for that
to happen anyway!) Start by trying one or two techniques — maybe
just massage your little one’s feet or shoulders. Try the others the
next time around. Your baby’s interest and stimulation level will
determine how many techniques, as well as how many strokes per
technique, to use.
And remember that even if your technique isn’t perfect, what’s
most important is for you to stay grounded and present. You
achieve this by breathing steadily and keeping eye contact at all
times (see Chapter 4). Above all, enjoy what you are doing.
Soothing the Feet and Legs
If this is your baby’s first massage, you may want to start with the
feet or legs because these areas are less prone to overstimulation
than, for example, the belly or chest.

Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
64
Before you begin a massage, take a look at Chapter 4, which con-
tains essential information about preparing for the experience,
asking your baby’s permission to massage her, deciding which oils
to use, and determining whether your baby is becoming anxious or
overstimulated.
When massaging your baby’s legs, it’s best to perform all the strokes
you will be using on one leg before switching to the other leg.
The Taffy Pull
The Taffy Pull is a nice introduction to massage for both of you, as
it works only the superficial layer of muscles. This technique is
simple and won’t overstimulate your baby. In addition, it helps to
release relaxation hormones, so don’t be surprised if your baby
falls asleep. If that happens, you can continue to give the massage
if you wish. Just be sure to move slowly and gently, and be ready to
offer a warm smile if she wakes up.
The Taffy Pull is an effleurage stroke, which means a gentle, gliding
stroke. Any effleurage stroke can be used to warm up the superficial
muscles, as well as to apply the oil to your baby’s body. (After all,
you want to apply the oil in a relaxing and soothing way, not just
smear it on your baby!) Effluerage calms and soothes the nervous
system and is a nice way to begin and end a massage.
Following are the steps involved in The Taffy Pull. Note that you
massage just one leg at a time.
1. Place one hand on the outside of your baby’s hip with
your palm facing in (see Figure 5-1).
2. Move your hand down the outside of her leg to her foot
using a gentle gliding stroke. 
3. When your first hand reaches the baby’s ankle, use your
other hand to stroke the inside of her leg, starting at the
top and moving down.
4. Alternate your hands in a continuous motion. Move your
hands continuously to maintain a smooth and rhythmic
motion.
If you notice your baby’s skin becoming a little red on the surface,
this may be an indication that there was some tension in the muscle
that was released.
Unless you want a tickle-happy baby, apply a bit of gentle pressure.
Find a fleshy part of your own body to practice using different
amounts of pressure.

Figure 5-1: Always make sure your palm is 
facing the baby.
Kneading Dough
This massage works the deeper layers of the muscle. Use this tech-
nique after you have warmed up the superficial muscles with a
stroke such as The Taffy Pull. Working the deeper layer of muscle
removes toxins and increases blood and oxygen circulation, thereby
relaxing the muscles. Believe it or not, babies are under a lot of
stress: Everything is new to them, and their daily lives are filled with
developmental changes. Stress accumulates in your little one’s body
just like it does in yours. This technique is a gentle way to release
some of it.
Kneading Dough is considered a petrissage stroke, which is a knead-
ing stroke used on loose, heavy musculature tissue. These strokes
often involve lifting, picking, rolling, squeezing, wringing, and
kneading. The kneading motion squeezes out toxins in the muscle,
moving the waste materials (lactic acid) back into the circulatory
system where the waste can be excreted through urination.
Chapter 5: Massaging the Front Side 65

Here are the steps involved in Kneading Dough. Note that you mas-
sage just one leg at a time.
1. With one hand (palm facing in), gently scoop up the
muscle tissue on the outside of your baby’s leg, as if you
are kneading dough (see Figure 5-2).
2. Continue scooping up the muscle as you work your way
down the outside of your baby’s leg.
3. When step 2 is complete, use your other hand to scoop up
the muscle tissue and work down the inside of the leg.
Squeeze and Twist
The Squeeze and Twist technique works all the muscles in the leg.
Because all the muscles are being massaged, this stroke increases
circulation and deepens relaxation.
Even though relaxation is the goal, your baby could become
stressed by this technique if he becomes too stimulated. If your
baby becomes stressed, speak to him in a soothing voice, and stop
the massage if you need to.
Figure 5-2: Gently scoop up the muscle tissue.
Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
66

Here are the steps involved in the Squeeze and Twist technique.
Note that you massage just one leg at a time.
1. With both hands, hold onto your baby’s leg between your
thumbs and forefingers. One hand is on the outside of the
leg (near the hip), and the other is on the inside. Your
thumbs are parallel to each other, with little distance
between them. 
2. Twist your thumbs and forefingers to your right and
then to your left, moving down toward the ankle (see
Figure 5-3). Your hands are moving in opposite directions.
Figure 5-3: Twist your fingers as you move down the leg.
If your baby is enjoying this massage technique, you can also use
upward strokes (moving your hands toward the baby’s belly). If
your baby starts to fuss, simply change the direction of the stroke
to move down toward the feet.
Thumb Circles
Like Kneading Dough and Squeeze and Twist, this stroke works
the deeper layers of muscle and increases circulation. Using this
technique on a very young baby introduces her to a new kind of
touch. As with the Squeeze and Twist technique, notice if your
baby becomes stressed by the increase in circulation, especially if
your baby is very young. If so, stop the massage and use a more
soothing technique like The Taffy Pull. Sometimes babies respond
unfavorably to being touched in a new way.
Chapter 5: Massaging the Front Side 67

Following are the steps involved in using the Thumb Circles tech-
nique. Note that you work on just one leg at a time.
1. Grab onto your baby’s thigh with fingers from both of
your hands.
2. Place your thumbs, side by side, on top of your baby’s
thigh, near the hip.
3. Moving from hip to ankle, make small outward circles
with alternating thumbs (see Figure 5-4).
4. When you’ve almost reached the ankle, change direction.
Use alternating thumbs to make outward circles back up
the leg.
Ankles Away
Massaging the ankles helps to lubricate the joint and increase the
mobility of your baby’s foot. If your baby is not walking yet, this
massage is a nice way to passively work the joint to keep it lubri-
cated and in full function. Ankles are weight-bearing joints and
hold the weight of the entire body. Massaging the joints can
strengthen them in preparation for walking.
Figure 5-4: Make small circles with alternating thumbs.
Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
68

Never massage directly on a bone because you can cause your
baby pain. Be sure to work around the ankle bone when you do
this massage.
Following are the steps involved in the Ankles Away technique.
Note that you work on only one ankle at a time.
1. Cup your baby’s ankle in your hands.
2. With one forefinger on each side of the ankle, make small
circles around the ankle working from the middle of the
foot around the ankle bone (see Figure 5-5).
Figure 5-5: Make small circles around 
the ankle with your forefingers.
This Little Piggy
Each of our feet contains more than 70,000 nerves, which makes
them sensitive to stress. You can release stress in your little one’s
feet by incorporating this stroke into your massage.
Practitioners of reflexology believe that the nerve endings on
the bottom of the foot correspond with the organs in the body.
Massaging the tip of the pinky toe, for example, can affect one’s
sinuses. Therefore, a foot massage can become a holistic treat-
ment, improving health throughout the body. Also, in Chinese 
medicine, all of the meridians (energy channels) begin and end on
the hands and feet. Therefore, massaging the extremities affects
different areas of the body.
Chapter 5: Massaging the Front Side 69

Following are the steps involved in doing the This Little Piggy 
technique. Note that you work on only one foot at a time.
1. Cup your baby’s foot in your hands, and make little 
circles on top of the foot with alternating thumbs (see
Figure 5-6). For very small babies, use only one thumb.
2. Continue cupping your baby’s foot and stroke down the
foot to your baby’s toes with your thumbs.
3. Grab each toe, one by one, and gently pull (just enough
to straighten the toe being pulled).
4. Sprinkle your baby’s yummy foot with lots of kisses.
Figure 5-6: Make little circles on top of your baby’s foot.
Raking
This stroke is soothing, relaxing, and a great way to end a massage
session or get your little one ready for bed.
In baby massage, finishing strokes such as this one are used to end
the treatment with a sedating effect. These strokes also balance
out the entire massage by bringing closure to the treatment. After a
while your baby will know that the massage is coming to an end by
remembering which stroke you are using.
To perform this technique, use one or both hands, apply gentle
pressure, and glide your fingertips down from the top of your
baby’s leg to the ankle (see Figure 5-7). Note that your hand is
simply moving on top of your baby’s leg. Use enough pressure so
as not to tickle your baby.
Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
70

Figure 5-7: Glide your fingertips down the 
length of your baby’s leg.
If your baby becomes a little anxious or cranky, you can use a
touch relaxation technique: Grab onto both legs and gently shake
them to relax the muscles. Be sure to maintain eye contact with
your baby and talk with her in a soothing voice.
Combining strokes
Be creative when massaging your baby’s feet and legs. When you
become comfortable with the techniques we describe here, you
won’t need to follow our instructions step by step. You’ll be able to
switch from one stroke to another with ease, and you can combine
strokes or even create your own routine to suit your baby.
There is no one right way to massage your baby. Just be aware of
whether your strokes are moving toward or away from the heart.
Strokes moving away from the heart are less stimulating to your
baby.
Chapter 5: Massaging the Front Side 71

Relaxing the Belly
Using abdominal massage can relax your baby and increase her
digestive functioning. Relaxation isn’t the only benefit here; con-
cerns such as constipation, colic, and diarrhea can be safely
addressed with massage. Refer to Chapter 11 for more techniques
to aid common health concerns.
The goal of each of the techniques in this section is the same: to
move stool and gas out of the colon. Because they share common
results, you can use these techniques in the sequence shown,
switch the order around, or just use one or two.
Massaging your baby’s belly stimulates digestion. Assuming you
don’t want spitting up to be part of the massage experience, we
suggest waiting an hour after a feeding before beginning the 
massage.
Always move strokes on the belly in a clockwise direction. Working
in a clockwise direction ensures that you are working in the same
direction as the intestinal tract. Picture a clock on your baby’s
belly. You want to move your hands up the ascending colon (from
7:00 to 11:00), across the transcending colon (from 11:00 to 1:00),
and down the descending colon (from 1:00 to 5:00).
Your baby may release gas or have a bowel movement while you are
working on this area. These are signs that your massage is working.
We suggest that you keep a diaper on or open underneath your baby
while working the abdomen, or else have one nearby!
The Water Wheel
The Water Wheel is used to push out any gas or stool that may be
stuck in part of your baby’s colon. Because your baby’s digestive
system is still developing, he may have excess gas, especially if he
drinks formula. (A breastfed baby can also have trouble with gas if
he is allergic or sensitive to certain foods that you eat. The book
Breastfeeding For Dummies by Sharon Perkins and Carol Vannais
[Wiley] contains lots of information about how breast milk and for-
mula can affect a baby’s digestive system.) For information on how
abdominal massage helps digestion, see Chapter 2.
Following are the steps involved in The Water Wheel:
1. Place your right hand (pinky side down, palm facing you)
just under your baby’s left breast, making sure to stay
under your baby’s ribs.
Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
72

2. Use a paddling motion and stroke down your baby’s belly
toward the pelvis (see Figure 5-8).
3. Switch hands and repeat the first two steps. Alternate
hands, and keep the movements continuous. Be sure to use
a little bit of pressure.
Use your baby’s reactions as a guide to how much is too much
pressure. If she becomes unhappy or looks uncomfortable, make
the pressure lighter.
Thumbs to Sides
Thumbs to Sides also pushes gas and stool out of your baby’s
colon, but this technique works the entire large intestine. This
stroke compliments The Water Wheel by addressing the entire
colon.
Figure 5-8: Stroke the pinky side of your hand 
straight down toward your baby’s pelvis.
Chapter 5: Massaging the Front Side 73

Here are the steps involved in the Thumbs to Sides technique:
1. Place each hand with the outside of your thumbs down
on either side of your baby’s belly button. Note that you
are only using your thumbs in this stroke.
2. Using the outside of your thumbs, stroke out toward your
baby’s sides (see Figure 5-9).
Make sure to use a little bit of pressure when using this technique.
Watch your baby closely; she will let you know if the pressure is
too much.
Figure 5-9: Stroke out toward baby’s sides using the outside of your thumbs.
Sun and Moon
With this stroke, you are helping Mother Nature with the elimination
process. All portions of the colon are addressed in one sweeping
movement. This is an efficient way to massage the colon.
Following are the steps for performing the Sun and Moon technique:
1. Imagine that your baby’s belly is a clock. 
2. Place your right hand at 7:00.
3. With your right hand, stroke up and around your baby’s
abdomen (in a clockwise motion) toward 4:00. You are
making a horseshoe pattern.
4. Repeat this motion with your left hand (see Figure 5-10).
Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
74

Chapter 5: Massaging the Front Side 75
Figure 5-10: Your left hand follows your right 
hand in a horseshoe pattern.
I Love You
The strokes we’ve discussed so far in the “Relaxing the Belly” section
work the ascending colon first. The I Love You stroke begins working
the colon from a different angle. By working the descending colon
first, you are releasing pressure that has built in the baby’s intestines.
Working the colon from the descending colon first is called uncork-
ing the bottle. If you think of the end of the colon as a corked bottle,
releasing the cork relieves any pressure that has gathered in the
colon.
Here are the steps involved in the I Love You stroke:
1. Imagine that your baby’s belly is a clock.
2. Using gentle pressure, start at 1:00 and stroke with one
or two fingers straight down your baby’s belly to 5:00.
You are making an “I.”
3. Next, start at 11:00 and stroke across to 1:00 and down
toward 5:00 with one or two fingers. You are making an
upside down “L” (see Figure 5-11).

Figure 5-11: With two fingers, make an 
upside down “L.”
4. Finally, stroke from 7:00 up, over, and down to 5:00,
making an upside down “U.”
Make sure to say “I love you” often as you are doing this stroke.
Opening the Chest and Shoulders
We think it’s logical to talk about the chest and shoulders together
because the major muscles of the chest attach directly to the shoul-
ders. Bringing the shoulder into a chest stroke creates a nice flow
during the massage. Most babies love this.
Massaging the chest increases breathing functions and moves out
any congestion that may have accumulated. The shoulder is a ball-
and-socket joint, so working the shoulder lubricates the joint and
increases range of motion.
Many practitioners of massage and other therapies believe that we
hold emotions in our muscle tissues. Even babies can hold feelings
and energy around their hearts. Because of this, don’t be surprised
if you find your baby becoming very stimulated during a chest
massage.
Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
76

The Heart Stroke
The Heart Stroke opens the chest, which makes breathing easier
and relieves congestion from colds. Any stored stress in this area
is pushed back out into the circulatory system and released during
elimination.
Following are the steps you take to perform the Heart Stroke:
1. Using both hands, make a triangle with your forefingers
and thumbs by placing your hands palm down on your
baby’s sternum. Your forefingers are pointed toward your
baby’s chin (see Figure 5-12).
2. Move the triangle up toward the baby’s chin, then sepa-
rate your hands and move them down around the nipples.
You are tracing the shape of a heart on your baby’s chest
(see Figure 5-13).
3. Finish the shape of the heart by bringing your hands
together at your baby’s belly button.
Figure 5-12: Make a triangle with your 
forefingers and thumbs.
Chapter 5: Massaging the Front Side 77

Figure 5-13: Separate your hands and move 
them down around your baby’s nipples.
The Open Book Stroke
The Open Book Stroke stretches and opens the major muscles of
the chest and the shoulders. This is a deeper massage because it
incorporates joint movement along with stretching. The muscles
are elongating, and the shoulder joint is moving within its range of
motion.
Here are the steps involved in the Open Book Stroke:
1. Place both hands palms down on your baby’s chest, with
your fingers facing your baby’s chin.
2. Move your hands away from each other, toward your
baby’s shoulders, and down the length of his arms until
you reach his hands (see Figure 5-14).
3. Return to the starting position and repeat the stroke as
often as your baby will allow.
Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
78

Figure 5-14: Move your hands toward your baby’s shoulders 
and down the length of his arms.
The Butterfly Stroke
The Butterfly Stroke lengthens the major muscles of the chest.
The flow of this stroke also includes the top of the shoulders (the
trapezius muscles), which makes for a smooth and rhythmic stroke.
Following are the steps for performing the Butterfly Stroke:
1. Place your right hand on your baby’s left lower belly.
Your palm should be down and your fingers facing your
baby’s right shoulder (see Figure 5-15).
2. Glide your right hand up toward your baby’s right shoul-
der and cup your hand over the shoulder.
3. Glide your right hand back to your starting position
(the left lower belly).
4. As your right hand returns to starting position, your left
hand mirrors the stroke. Start your left hand at your baby’s
right lower belly and move it toward her left shoulder (see
Figure 5-16).
You create a rhythm with this stroke by keeping your hands
moving continuously.

baby’s left lower belly.

Reaching for Arms and Hands
Before you know it, your baby starts to use her hands to reach for
things, and she begins pulling herself up to practice standing (which
means walking isn’t far behind). You want to work your baby’s hands
to help her get ready to use her fine motor skills. Massaging your
baby’s arms strengthens the muscles so she will be able to pull her
body weight up into a standing position. For more information on
your baby’s development, refer to Chapter 3.
Just as with your baby’s legs, we suggest you complete all the strokes
you will be using on one arm before switching to the other arm.
Alternating Hands
Alternating Hands is a great stroke to begin working on this part
of the body. Like The Taffy Pull (which we describe earlier in the
chapter), this is an effleurage stroke — it warms the superficial
muscles to prepare for deeper work. You want to apply oil to the
areas you’re massaging.
Here are the steps involved in the Alternating Hands technique:
1. Place your left hand on the outside of your baby’s right
shoulder.
2. Place your right hand on the inside of your baby’s
right arm.
3. Glide your left hand down toward your baby’s hand.
4. As your left hand is approaching your baby’s hand, your
right hand starts gliding down (see Figure 5-17).
5. Return to the first step and continue to move your hands
in an alternating rhythm.
The “C” Stroke
This stroke works the deeper layer of the muscles. As you move
down your baby’s arm, you are wringing any toxins out of his mus-
cles. Because you are twisting in opposite directions and moving
across your baby’s muscle fibers, you are increasing the relaxation
response. For more on stress, see Chapter 2.
Chapter 5: Massaging the Front Side 81

1. With each hand cupped in the shape of a “C,” place your
fingers around the top of your baby’s arm. Pretend that you
are holding tiny cups between your thumb and forefingers.
2. Gently squeeze and twist your way down your baby’s arm
to the wrist. Your hands are moving in opposite directions
(see Figure 5-18).
Do not squeeze and twist your baby’s wrist.
Figure 5-17: When your left hand is approaching your 
baby’s hand, glide your right hand down.
Figure 5-18: Squeeze and twist your hands down your baby’s arm in 
opposite directions. 
Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
82

Wrist work
The wrist is similar to a tunnel, where nerves run through to acti-
vate the muscles in the hand. You want to work your baby’s wrists
to maintain fluidity and free range of movement. Although the wrist
is a small area, it contains many nerves, muscles, and bones.
Following are the steps for performing Thumb Circles on your
baby’s wrists:
1. Hold your baby’s left wrist with both of your hands. Your
baby’s palm is facing down.
2. Using one or both thumbs, make tiny circles on your
baby’s wrist (see Figure 5-19).
Figure 5-19: Make tiny circles on your 
baby’s wrist with your thumbs.
3. Turn your baby’s hand over, and make tiny circles with
your thumbs on the bottom of the wrist.
4. Switch hands, and massage your baby’s right wrist.
Hands on hands
Your baby’s hands stay clenched until she is ready to use them.
Even if your baby’s hands aren’t in use yet, the act of keeping them
clenched creates stress. When your baby does start using her hands
Chapter 5: Massaging the Front Side 83

to grab objects, the hand muscles are being used constantly, and
she is fine-tuning her motor skills. Massaging your baby’s hands
helps to strengthen, tone, and relax the muscles.
If your baby’s hands are clenched, do not try to pry them open.
Your baby is still developing and may not be ready to open them.
Try to gently stroke or kiss the tops of her fingers to see if they
will open.
Hand stroking
This soothing stroke is a good beginning technique, as well as one
you can use anytime. Simply holding your baby’s hand between
yours is comforting and relaxing.
To perform this stroke, use the following steps:
1. Place your baby’s left hand between both of your hands
(like a sandwich).
2. With the tips of your fingers, stroke the top of your
baby’s hand from wrist to fingers (see Figure 5-20).
3. Repeat these steps on your baby’s right hand.
Figure 5-20: Stroke the top of your baby’s hand 
from wrist to fingers.
Finger stroking
There are a lot of joints in the fingers, so it is important to work
each finger separately to ensure that each joint is working to its
full capacity.
Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
84

Use these steps for stroking your baby’s fingers:
1. With your thumb and forefinger, grab one of your baby’s
fingers near the knuckle and gently pull down toward the
baby’s nail (see Figure 5-21).
2. Continue this stroke on each of your baby’s fingers.
Figure 5-21: Grab your baby’s finger with 
your thumb and forefinger and pull down 
toward the nail gently.

Massaging the Face
and Neck
In This Chapter
 Relaxing muscles around your baby’s mouth
 Releasing tension around the forehead and eyes
 Massaging your baby’s ears, chin, and neck
I
n this chapter, we show you plenty of techniques to relax the
muscles in your baby’s face. After all, it can be a workout for
your little one to feed, laugh, and show off his dimples all day long.
In this chapter, as in Chapters 5 and 7, you should keep in mind
that you’re free to experiment with the order of the techniques we
present. And, of course, you don’t have to do them all. You and
your baby will figure out together which ones are the most sooth-
ing and in what order.
Proceeding with Caution
Before we present all the great techniques you can use to relieve
the stress in your baby’s facial muscles, we want to offer a few
words of caution. Generally, babies are very sensitive about having
their heads touched. Because a baby’s skull and brain are still
developing, the head is a vulnerable and sensitive area. (More than
50 percent of the total growth of your baby’s head occurs in the
first year of life.) For this reason, we focus in this chapter on the
face and neck — areas that most babies enjoy having touched.
In particular, you want to avoid massaging your baby’s soft spot —
called a fontanel — which is where the bones of your baby’s skull
have not joined completely. The fontanel allows room for your baby’s
rapidly growing brain to develop. Typically, you can see and feel a
pulse in the fontanel. Two spots are usually large enough to be
noticeable:

Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
88
 Posterior fontanel: Located on the back part of your baby’s
head. This soft spot should close by 4 months of age.
 Anterior fontanel: The diamond-shaped soft spot on top of
your baby’s head, toward the front. Usually, this soft spot
closes between 9 and 18 months.
The fontanel is protected by a tough, fibrous membrane, so it is
safe to touch and wash the area. But massaging the fontanel is
simply too risky.
If you want to include the head in your baby’s massage, we recom-
mend light stroking (around — not on top of — the soft spot) only
if your baby seems to like the touch. If not, just leave the head out
of the massage until your baby begins to enjoy the touch.
Soothing Your Baby’s Smile
The muscles in your baby’s face hold tension from nursing, suck-
ing, laughing, and teething. Also, each time your baby expresses an
emotion, his facial muscles contract to change his expression,
which creates tension.
Relaxing the jaw
Your baby’s jaw area can contain lots of tension, especially if you
have a baby with high sucking needs! The following techniques are
easy and useful for relieving stress in the jaw.
Ears to Chin
This is a good beginning stroke to familiarize your baby with the
feeling of having your hands on her face. It is a smooth, flowing,
and gentle stroke. Use very little pressure; you want your hands to
feel like feathers on your baby’s skin. If your baby happens to be
very sensitive from teething, this stroke may be the only one you
can use on her face.
Here are the steps involved in the Ears to Chin technique:
1. Place your baby on his back, with his feet closest to your
body.
2. Place your right hand (palm facing baby’s head) behind
your baby’s right ear.

Chapter 6: Massaging the Face and Neck 89
3. Place your left hand (palm facing baby’s head) behind
your baby’s left ear (see Figure 6-1).
4. Glide both hands (simultaneously) down toward your
baby’s chin.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 multiple times, depending on
your baby’s level of tolerance.
Figure 6-1: Cup your baby’s head with your palms.
Small Circles
This massage technique soothes the muscles that babies use for
sucking, and it also relieves discomfort from teething. It accom-
plishes these things by increasing circulation by moving the
muscle in all directions, down the length of the jaw line.
Here are the steps involved in the Small Circles technique:
1. Choose how many fingers to use, depending on the size
of your hand compared to the size of your baby’s face.
You may use one, two, or three fingers (your pointer, fore-
finger, and middle finger).
2. Place one, two, or three of your fingers from your right
hand just below your baby’s right earlobe.
3. Place one, two, or three of your fingers from your left
hand just below your baby’s left earlobe (see Figure 6-2).

Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
90
4. Make small clockwise circles with your fingers as you
move down slowly, following the baby’s jaw line.
5. You may repeat this sequence three to five times, if your
baby likes this technique.
Figure 6-2: Place your fingers just below your baby’s earlobes.
Tapping the Jaw Line
Tapping along the jaw line helps to sedate the sensitive nerve end-
ings in your babies gums and to increase circulation in this area.
This technique can soothe your baby’s discomfort from teething,
sucking, and crying. Here are the steps to take:
1. Place the forefinger and middle finger of your left hand
under your baby’s left earlobe (palm side in).
2. Place the forefinger and middle finger of your right hand
under your baby’s right earlobe (palm side in) — see
Figure 6-3.
3. Swiftly tap your fingers (from both hands) alternately
down your baby’s jaw line. In other words, one finger from
each hand is touching your baby’s jaw line at a time. Be
sure to use gentle pressure.
4. When you reach the bottom of the jaw line, tap your fin-
gers back up your baby’s jaw to the earlobes.
5. Repeat this sequence three to five times.
A variation of this stroke is to tap both fingers from each hand at
the same time, down and back up your baby’s jaw line.

baby’s earlobes.
Loving those sweet cheeks:
The Smile Stroke
Your baby uses a lot of facial muscles to express emotions such as
wonder, pleasure, frustration, and anger. You can use massage to
relax and soften the muscles of the face.
You’re probably aware that it takes more muscles to frown than to
smile. If your baby pouts or frowns frequently, this is a great stroke
to use to relax your baby’s upper lip and cheeks. Here’s how:
1. Place your left thumb (palm facing in) just under your
baby’s left nostril.
2. Place your right thumb (palm facing in) just under your
baby’s right nostril.
3. Using both thumbs, stroke outward toward the apples of
your baby’s cheeks (see Figure 6-4).

Figure 6-4: Stroke your thumbs out toward 
your baby’s cheeks.
4. Continue to glide your thumbs up toward your baby’s
temples. Imagine you are drawing a happy face on your
baby (see Figure 6-5).
5. If your baby allows, repeat this sequence three to five
times.
Figure 6-5: Draw a smile on your baby’s face.
You can complete the smile by repeating the sequence but begin-
ning with your thumbs just under your baby’s lower lip.

Relaxing the Eyes
When you think of muscles, the eyes may not leap to mind. But
we all use our eye muscles to express emotion, which can create
tension.
If your baby tends to move around a lot, make sure that you move
very slowly when you attempt this massage technique, and pro-
ceed with great caution.
Following are the steps for the Circling the Eyes technique:
1. Place the forefinger of your left hand on the left side of
the bridge of your baby’s nose.
2. Place the forefinger of your right hand on the right side
of the bridge of your baby’s nose.
3. Simultaneously, gently sweep your forefingers down the
bridge of your baby’s nose (see Figure 6-6).
Figure 6-6: Sweep your fingers down the bridge 
of your baby’s nose.
4. Move your fingers down and out underneath the lower
eyelids.
5. Glide your forefingers up and around the top of your
baby’s eyebrows (see Figure 6-7).
Chapter 6: Massaging the Face and Neck 93

Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
94
6. Your fingers will meet in between baby’s eyebrows.
7. Repeat this sequence three to five times, if your baby
allows.
Figure 6-7: Glide your fingers up and around.
Smoothing Out the Forehead
Your baby’s forehead can be very expressive, showing emotions
like surprise or wonder, or indicating a serious state of mind.
Consequently, your baby’s forehead can also hold a lot of tension
in times of distress, especially if you have a colicky baby. It’s a
good idea to make massaging your baby’s forehead a part of your
routine.
The Open Book Stroke
This stroke smoothes and relaxes the muscles of the forehead.
There are two variations.
Following are the steps for the first variation of the Open Book
Stroke:
1. Place the fingertips (palms down) of both your hands in
the center of your baby’s forehead (see Figure 6-8). The
tips of your fingers are just below your baby’s hairline.

2. Simultaneously glide your hands slowly away from one
another, out to the sides, across your baby’s forehead
(see Figure 6-9). 
3. Repeat this sequence three to five times if your baby
likes it.
Figure 6-8: Place your fingertips just below your baby’s hairline.

Here are the steps for the second variation of this stroke:
1. Place the fingertips (palms down) of both your hands in
the center of your baby’s forehead, midway between the
hairline and eyebrows.
2. Simultaneously glide your hands slowly away from one
another, out to the sides, across the baby’s forehead —
see Figure 6-10.
3. Repeat this sequence three to five times if your baby
likes it.
Figure 6-10: Place your fingertips midway between your baby’s hairline and 
eyebrows and glide your hands apart.
Big Circles
This stroke works the deeper layers of muscles that lie in the fore-
head. Here are the steps to take:
1. Using the fingertips of either your left or right hand,
place your fingers (palms down, fingertips facing the
hairline) on the left side of your baby’s forehead (see
Figure 6-11).
2. Move your fingers in a clockwise circular motion,
moving from the hairline down toward the eyebrows
(see Figure 6-12).
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 three to five times if you can.

Figure 6-11: Place your fingertips on the left side of 
your baby’s forehead.
Figure 6-12: Move your fingers in a circular 
motion toward the eyebrows.
4. Using either the fingertips of your left or right hand,
place your fingers (palms down, fingertips facing the
hairline) in the center of your baby’s forehead.
5. Move your fingers in a clockwise circular motion,
moving from the hairline down toward the eyebrows
(see Figure 6-13).

9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 three to five times if you can.

Figure 6-14: Place your fingers on the right side of your baby’s 
forehead and circle your fingers down toward the eyebrows.
The Temple Stroke
The muscles located on the side of your baby’s forehead hold a lot
of tension, which can create headaches. The Temple Stroke can
help your baby relax and relieve any tension in this area.
Here are the steps involved in the Temple Stroke:
1. Place your right fingertips (palm side in) on your baby’s
right temple.
2. Place your left fingertips (palm side in) on your baby’s
left temple.

Ear infections
Many babies and children are plagued with ear infections. Ear infections typically
affect the middle ear and the Eustachian tube — a long tube that connects the ear
to the nose and throat, allowing fluids to drain out of the middle ear. Babies are par-
ticularly susceptible to infections because the Eustachian is short and horizontal. If
fluids build up in the middle ear (usually from a sinus or respiratory infection), bac-
teria can grow and create an infection.
It can be difficult to identify what is wrong with a preverbal baby, but here are some
common symptoms of an ear infection to look for:
 Fussiness
 Crying
 A slight fever
 Pulling or tugging at the ear lobes
 An unwillingness to suck on a pacifier or bottle, or to nurse
 A recent bout with a cold or sinus infection
 Diarrhea
 An unpleasant odor coming from the ear
Most ear infections aren’t serious, and they do go away as your baby grows older.
However, babies with chronic ear infections are at risk for ear drum damage or
hearing loss.
Antibiotics are sometimes used to treat ear Infections. New guidelines for treating
ear infections suggest using a pain reliever first and administering antibiotics only
if the infection doesn’t improve. If your baby isn’t in too much pain, you can help to
improve the infection with massage. Try a gentle massage along the back of the ear,
down along the jaw bone, and in front of the ear using a circular motion with one or
two fingers. You can also use a gentle massage on the back of your baby’s head,
near the base of the skull. These techniques can help clear the fluid out of the
Eustachian tubes to improve healing.
If you want to treat the infection with alternative therapies, acupuncture and chi-
ropractic care have been successful in treating and preventing ear infections. Also,
if you breastfeed your baby for at least six months, your baby’s chances of getting
ear infections are lessened due to the immune-building antibodies that are present
in breast milk.

3. Move the fingertips of both hands in a circular, clockwise
motion (see Figure 6-15).
4. Create six small circles.
Figure 6-15: Move your fingertips in a circular, clockwise motion.
While you’re using this technique, make your movements smooth
and flowing to increase your baby’s relaxation. (The same holds
true for all the techniques in this chapter.)
Paying the Ears, Chin, and Neck
Some Attention
At first glance they may seem incidental, but the ears, chin, and
neck hold tension and energy too! Don’t forget to devote some time
to each during your massage.
The Ear Stroke
Following is a simple technique to use on your baby’s ears:
1. With your left thumb and forefinger, gently take hold of
your baby’s left earlobe.
2. Roll your baby’s earlobe between your fingers, using a
kneading motion (see Figure 6-16).
3. Do this technique for three to five seconds.
Chapter 6: Massaging the Face and Neck 101

Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
102
4. With your right thumb and forefinger, gently take hold of
your baby’s right earlobe.
5. Repeat steps 2 and 3.
Figure 6-16: Use a kneading 
motion to roll your baby’s 
earlobe between your fingers.
Chinny Chin Chin
Your baby’s chin is an extension of the jaw line, which means there
are a lot of muscles in this area that contain tension because of
nursing, crying, and laughing. Here are the steps involved in this
stroke:
1. Place the pads of the fingers from your left hand on the
right side of your baby’s chin.
2. Place the pads of the fingers from your right hand on the
left side of your baby’s chin (see Figure 6-17).
3. Create small circles with your fingers. The fingers of your
left hand move in a counterclockwise direction, and the 
fingers of your right hand move in a clockwise direction.
Move your hands away from each other (see Figure 6-18)
and up along the jaw line.
4. Move your fingers back down the jaw line to your starting
position.
5. Repeat the sequence three to five times in each direction.

Figure 6-17: Place your fingers on both 
sides of your baby’s chin.
Figure 6-18: Move your hands away from one 
another as you create small circles.
Here’s a variation of the Chinny Chin Chin stroke:
1. Place the pads of the fingers from your left hand on the
right side of your baby’s mouth.
2. Place the pads of the fingers from your right hand on the
left side of your baby’s mouth.
Chapter 6: Massaging the Face and Neck 103

Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
104
3. Move your fingers down to the point of your baby’s chin
with small circles (see Figure 6-19).
4. Continue the circles back up the chin to your starting
position — near the corners of your baby’s mouth.
5. Repeat this sequence three to five times in each direction,
if your baby allows.
Figure 6-19: Starting with your hands on either 
side of your baby’s mouth, circle your fingers 
down your baby’s chin.
Working the neck
Think of what an enormous burden it must be for your baby to
support his big, heavy head! As your baby develops more neck
strength, tension and stress can be held here too. Massaging your
baby’s neck releases tension and makes it easier for him to learn
new movements.
The strokes we describe here can be used anytime, even when
your baby is sitting or lying on your lap. On very young babies, it is
difficult to even find their neck, so you can skip these techniques
until your baby is about 6 months old.
Small Circles
This stroke massages your baby’s lymph nodes. Here are the steps
to follow:

1. Use your left hand and place the pads of your fingers just
below your baby’s right ear.
2. Make small circles with your fingers in a clockwise 
direction.
3. Move your fingers down your baby’s neck, all the way to
the collar bone (see Figure 6-20).
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 with your right hand, beginning
under your baby’s left ear.
5. Repeat the entire sequence three to five times if possible.
With this technique, you can work one side of the neck at a time
or both sides simultaneously. A nice variation is to start the circles
at the back of your baby’s ears and work down toward the back of
the neck.
Scooping
The following technique creates length and space in the muscles
of the back of your baby’s neck. Done correctly, it feels great.
However, be certain to gently grab onto your baby’s neck!
Figure 6-20: Move your fingers in a clockwise direction, 
down toward the collar bone.

1. With either your right or left hand, gently pinch the back
of your baby’s neck between your thumb and forefinger
and lift up the skin and muscle.
2. Repeat this motion three to five times if your baby
allows.

B
efore you know it, your baby is rolling over, laying on her
belly, and trying to crawl. In this chapter, we invite you to
take advantage of your baby’s natural curiosity and growing abili-
ties to move her body.
In addition to showing you how to massage the back of your baby’s
body, we supply tips to make your massage experience the best it
can be and suggest ways to incorporate massage into your daily
activities.
Taking Advantage of Tummy Time
Unless you have been practicing yoga regularly for many years,
your baby is much more flexible than you! He can bend his back
forward, backward, and sideways, and he can twist around to see
what’s going on behind him.
Besides providing agility, the many muscles of your baby’s back
help to protect his spine and keep his body upright. Using massage
to ease the tension and stress out of your baby’s back and neck
muscles will not only make him more comfortable but will help him
maintain good posture as he develops and matures.
If your baby has been trying to stand or walk , you can imagine
how much stress his body experiences with each attempt (and
tumble!). Massage is a good way to make the exciting adventure of
standing and walking smoother for your baby.

Many babies under 6 months are uncomfortable lying on their bel-
lies for very long. You can use different positions to massage your
baby’s back, such as having him sit in your lap or holding him on
your shoulder. You don’t have to postpone massaging your baby’s
back until he begins to enjoy tummy time!
Massaging the Legs and Feet
It’s good to massage the back of your baby’s legs because of the
connection between the lower back and the hamstrings — the mus-
cles in the back of her legs. If the hamstrings become tight, your
baby may experience some discomfort in the lower back.
As your baby begins to practice standing, she is using muscles that
haven’t been used before. Massaging the muscles on the back of
the body increases your baby’s body awareness.
The techniques that you can use to massage the back of the legs and
feet are essentially the same techniques we discuss in Chapter 5 for
massaging the front of the legs and feet. Here, we show you how to
use these techniques on the back of the body.
The difference is your baby’s position while you massage her.
Whereas the only option for massaging her front side is to have
her lie on her back, here you have a few options:
 Place your baby sideways (belly down) on your lap (see
Figure 7-1). This position is wonderful because you can liter-
ally massage your baby anywhere!
Figure 7-1: Lay your baby on her belly sideways on your lap.
Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
108

 Place your baby on his belly on a flat surface, such as a bed,
changing table, or soft carpet (see Figure 7-2).
 Lean your back against a wall or piece of heavy furniture for
support. Place your baby belly down between your legs, with
her head near your feet (see Figure 7-3).
This is a great position to use if you’ve had a cesarean section
or have any other health condition that makes it difficult for
you to stand.
Figure 7-2: Lay your baby down on a flat surface.

between your legs. 
Chapter 7: Massaging the Back Side 109

The Taffy Pull
Use this gliding stroke to warm up the muscles (see Figure 7-4).
Refer to Chapter 5 for the steps involved.
Kneading Dough
As we explain in Chapter 5, you can gently release accumulated
stress in your baby’s legs by using the Kneading Dough stroke.
Figure 7-5 shows how to perform this stroke on the back of the legs.
Thumb Circles
The Thumb Circles stroke is great for increasing circulation in your
baby’s legs. However, when you massage the back of your baby’s
legs, be sure not to use deep pressure on the back of the knee
because of the veins and nerves that are in this area. Figure 7-6
shows how this technique, described in Chapter 5, can be used on
the back of the legs.

baby’s hip to the ankle.

Ankles Away
As we describe in Chapter 5, this technique increases mobility in
your baby’s feet. Remember never to massage directly over a bone;
massage around the ankle bone (see Figure 7-7).
Figure 7-7: Use your forefingers to make 
small circles around the ankle bone.
Bottoms Up! Kneading Your
Baby’s Bottom
The largest muscles in anyone’s body are the gluteus maximi — the
muscles commonly known as the buttocks. (See, no one is picking
on you — everyone’s got a big backside!)
The buttocks are the muscles that propel your baby when he
walks, and they are the muscles that connect the back and legs
together. Your baby uses these muscles a lot: when he sits, lays,
walks, and even crawls.
Alternating Thumbs
You can release the tension held in your baby’s bottom with this
simple stroke.
Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
112

1. Place your thumbs side-by-side on the top of one of your
baby’s cheeks (near the lower back).
2. Moving from the top of the buttock down toward the
crease of the leg, make small outward circles with alter-
nating thumbs (see Figure 7-8).
3. Repeat the first two steps on your baby’s other cheek.
Figure 7-8: Make small outward 
circles with alternating thumbs.
Circular Palmer
This is a great stroke to use if you have a baby who is mobile. By
bracing your hand against her hip, you are helping to keep her still
until she learns to relax into the massage.
1. Hold your left hand palm side in, and brace your baby’s
left hip.
2. Place your right hand palm down on your baby’s right
cheek with your fingers facing your baby’s head.
3. Use your whole palm to make small counterclockwise cir-
cles down your baby’s buttock (see Figure 7-9).
4. Hold your right hand palm side in and brace your baby’s
right hip.
Chapter 7: Massaging the Back Side 113

5. Place your left palm down on your baby’s left cheek with
your fingers facing your baby’s head.
6. Use your whole palm to make small counterclockwise 
circles down your baby’s buttock.
Figure 7-9: Make small circles using your 
whole palm.
Keep one hand on your baby at all times. Doing so ensures that
your baby feels you, even though she can’t see you!
The Large Bottom Stroke
The name of this technique describes the stroke used — it isn’t for
large bottoms only!
1. Place your right hand on your baby’s right cheek with
your palm down and fingers facing your baby’s head.
2. Place your left hand on your baby’s left cheek with your
palm down and fingers facing your baby’s head.
Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
114

3. Stroke your baby’s bottom using the entire palm of both
hands if possible. Alternate your hands by moving your
right hand in a clockwise direction and your left in a coun-
terclockwise direction (see Figure 7-10).
4. Repeat this stroke as often as your baby likes.
Figure 7-10: Make large circles 
with your palms.
Finger stroking
This is a relaxing technique to use as a finishing stroke during your
massage. Here are the steps involved:
1. Place your right hand on the top of your baby’s right
cheek, with your palm down and fingers facing your
baby’s head.
2. Place your left hand on the top of your baby’s left cheek,
with your palm down and fingers facing your baby’s head.
3. Gently stroke down each cheek with both of your hands
(see Figure 7-11).
4. Immediately repeat steps 1 through 3 to maintain a
smooth flow.
5. Repeat this sequence as often as your baby likes.
Chapter 7: Massaging the Back Side 115

Figure 7-11: Stroke your fingertips 
down each of your baby’s cheeks. 
Doing the Back Stroke
Have you noticed how perfect your baby’s posture is? Slouching is
learned behavior; babies naturally sit up straight and tall when
their muscles are strong enough to support sitting. Regular mas-
sage helps to maintain your baby’s perfect posture — plus, you
can give your baby a back massage anywhere!
When we talk about the anatomy of the spine, we typically divide it
into three segments: the cervical spine (where most movement
occurs), the thoracic spine, and the lumbar spine. Below the lumbar
spine lies the sacrum, which is part of the pelvis.
Each segment of the spine is made up of vertebrae that are sepa-
rated by discs, which act as cushions. There are seven vertebrae
in the cervical spine, twelve in the thoracic spine, and five in the
lumbar spine (see Figure 7-12).
The spine develops from birth through young adulthood — it usu-
ally completes its development around 18 years of age. You never
want to massage directly on your baby’s developing spine. The
techniques we describe in this section all involve massaging
around the spine.

The next time your little one gets bored in the waiting room of the
doctor’s office, place her sideways on your lap and massage her
back. You’ll see how fast that fussy behavior goes away!
Depending on the direction of your movements, a back massage
may be stimulating or sedating. Try moving your hands toward
the buttocks to quiet your baby, or move the strokes toward your
baby’s head for a stimulating massage.
The Long Effleurage Stroke
This stroke is a fact-finder, meaning it gives you the opportunity to
become familiar with the muscles in your baby’s back and where
she may be holding tension. You may also use this stroke to apply
oil to your baby’s back.
1. Place both your hands palm side down on your baby’s
back, with your fingertips near the shoulders.
2. Stroke both hands gently down the back toward the
sacrum, just above your baby’s buttocks (see Figure 7-13).
Figure 7-13: Stroke both hands down your baby’s back.
Part II: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Massaging Baby 
118

3. Stroke both hands gently back up the back toward your
baby’s neck.
4. Repeat this sequence three to five times.
For maximum relaxation, glide your palms smoothly over your
baby’s back in one sweeping motion.
Back and Forth
With this stroke, you are working against the grain of the muscle
fibers, which really helps to warm up the muscles, as well as to
reduce tension.
1. Place both hands palms down perpendicular on your
baby’s back, near the neck (see Figure 7-14).
2. Alternate moving your palms in a sawing movement
down your baby’s back (see Figure 7-15).
Figure 7-14: Place both hands perpendicular on 
your baby’s back.
Chapter 7: Massaging the Back Side 119

3. Work your hands up your baby’s back toward the neck,
and repeat back down again.
4. Repeat this sequence three to five times if possible.

Using front carriers wisely
If you are considering wearing your baby, we suggest that you use a sling (which
we discuss in Chapter 1) because the sling protects your baby’s spine by keeping
his weight evenly distributed. We like front carriers (such as Baby Bjorns) too, but
prolonged use (a few hours or more a day) may place too much stress on your baby’s
spine and create a condition called spondylolisthesis, which occurs when one ver-
tebra slips over another vertebra, causing a lot of pain. To safely use a front carrier,
make sure that your baby is able to hold her head upright, and keep the length of
time your baby is in a front carrier to a minimum.

Swooping
You can use this easy stroke anywhere to soothe, relax, and quiet
your baby. Here’s how:
1. Place one hand perpendicular on your baby’s back, near
the neck.
2. Place your other hand, palm down, over your baby’s 
buttocks.
3. Swoop your hand down your baby’s body, from the
neck to the butt, as if you are petting a dog or cat (see
Figure 7-16).
4. You can vary this technique by placing one hand on your
baby’s ankles instead of the buttocks, and swoop down
from the neck to the ankles (see Figure 7-17).
5. Repeat this sequence three to five times if possible.
Figure 7-16: Swoop your hand down toward your 
baby’s buttocks.

Small Circles
This stroke helps you work some of the deeper layers of the back
muscles. Here are the steps to take:
1. Place the finger pads of both your hands facing down,
with your hands perpendicular on your baby’s back.
Your fingertips will be above the spine, beginning at the
neck area (see Figure 7-18).
2. Using medium pressure, make small clockwise circles
with your fingers, and work your way down toward the
buttock (see Figure 7-19).
3. Work back up toward the neck.
4. Repeat the first step, but this time place your fingertips
underneath your baby’s spine.
5. Repeat steps 2 and 3.
6. Repeat this sequence three to five times.

Sacral stroke
The sacrum is a triangular-shaped bone located just below the
lumbar spine and just above the buttocks. This is a great stroke
to use to alleviate constipation. Plus, it feels nice to your baby!
1. Place your thumbs, palm side down, on either side of the
sacrum.
2. Alternate thumb circles over and around the sacrum
(see Figure 7-20).
3. For a nice variation, you can make the circles in either a
clockwise or counterclockwise direction.
4. Repeat the sequence three to five times.

Considering chiropractic care
Chiropractors adjust subluxations in the spine, which are partial dislocations in the
spinal vertebrae. When the vertebrae dislocate, the nervous system is affected,
which can affect tissues and organs throughout the body.
Subluxations can occur in babies and children as a result of a difficult birth, tumbles
and falls during the crawling and walking years, falls from learning to ride a bicy-
cle, and emotional stress.
Adjusting or manipulating the spine places the misplaced vertebrae back into place.
Gentle chiropractic adjustments are safe for babies’ fragile and developing spines
and have been effective in aiding common discomforts in babies and children, such
as the following:
 Earaches and frequent ear infections
 Bed wetting
 Colic

 Constipation

Raking
This is a nice finishing stroke, as it tends to produce a sedating
effect if the sequence is repeated a couple of times.
1. Place one hand, palm down, near your baby’s neck
with your fingers facing toward your baby’s head
(see Figure 7-21).
2. Comb or gently rake your fingers down toward the 
buttocks. Keep in mind that you don’t want to massage
directly over the spine.
3. Add a variation by starting at your baby’s head and
raking down toward the feet.
4. Make the pressure of the stroke lighter as you continue.
5. Repeat the sequence as often as you both like (or until
one or both of you fall asleep!).

Relaxing the Neck and Shoulders:
Long Strokes
In Chapter 6 we show you how to massage your baby’s neck. Here
we show you how to massage both the neck and shoulders in one
technique.
This stroke creates space between your baby’s ears and shoulders
by elongating the muscles in the neck. You can use this stroke even
though your baby’s neck is not very long!
If you have a lap baby, take advantage of your baby’s natural
curiosity to look around by incorporating this stroke whenever
her head is turned to one side.
1. Place the finger pads of your right hand just below your
baby’s right ear.
2. Place the finger pads of your left hand just below your
baby’s left ear.

You can choose to work both sides of the neck simultane-
ously or one at a time.
3. Using one long soothing movement, gently stroke down
the sides of your baby’s neck, all the way to the shoulder
area (see Figure 7-22).
4. Repeat this sequence as often as you and your baby like.

Preemies and Newborns
In This Chapter

 Handling your preemie with care
 Massaging your newborn
 Making sure that your baby is thriving
I
n this chapter we show you how you can incorporate touch and
massage into your routine and relationship with your baby even
before you leave the hospital. We pay close attention to special
considerations for premature babies, and we discuss how to make
sure your baby is thriving.
Handling an Early Arrival
A healthy full-term pregnancy lasts approximately 40 weeks. Babies
born anywhere between 38 and 42 weeks are usually developmen-
tally normal. Babies born prior to 36 weeks are considered premature
and may have physical problems, such as the following, that require
longer hospital care:
 An inability to breathe properly
 Difficulty retaining heat and staying warm
 An inability to breastfeed
 Underdeveloped lungs
Despite these potential complications, babies born after 32 weeks
typically have a high survival rate with few long-term effects.
Keep in mind that babies born prematurely look different than
babies born at term. Their skin can be very red, and you may be
able to see the blood vessels through their skin because their
bodies haven’t yet developed fat.

When a baby is born prematurely, the experience can be very
stressful — possibly even traumatic — for both you and your baby.
Here are some of the reasons why:
 Your baby is not developmentally or emotionally ready for life
outside of the womb.
 Your baby may have serious health concerns.
 Your labor was undoubtedly stressful and may have been
delayed with the use of medicine that slows down uterine 
contractions.
 You may not feel emotionally ready to be a parent.
 You may not have had a chance to physically prepare for your
baby’s arrival by setting up the nursery or installing the car
seat.
In addition, when a baby is born prematurely, you don’t experience
the normal process of welcoming your newborn into the world.

Risks for premature labor
Sometimes babies just come early, and there isn’t anything that you could have done
differently to prevent it. However, following is a list of some risk factors that can
increase the possibility of having a premature labor. If any of these risk factors apply
to you, talk with your doctor about how to address them so you can reduce the risk
of a premature birth.
 Giving birth to multiple babies (such as twins or triplets)
 Smoking during pregnancy
 Being malnourished during your pregnancy
 Having a health issue such as diabetes or high blood pressure
 Experiencing high levels of stress during pregnancy
 Using drugs or alcohol during pregnancy
 Dealing with a health concern during pregnancy such as placenta previa
(where the placenta covers part of the cervix) or preeclampsia (whose symp-
toms include high blood pressure and protein in the urine).
 Having a previous premature baby
 Being underweight or overweight during your pregnancy
 Having an infection with a fever during your pregnancy

Premature babies need special care, which begins as soon as the
delivery is complete. For example:
 Instead of being handed to you right away, your baby may be
taken for tests immediately.
 You may have to be moved to a different hospital in order to
be placed in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
 Bonding between you and your baby may be interrupted due
to an early separation in the hospital. Premature babies are
often placed in incubators, where they are kept warm and
given the opportunity to further their development.
 You may even have to leave the hospital without your baby.
The hospital where your coauthor Ilene works is one of the few
medical centers that offers a nurturing touch program in its NICU.
This means that a trained and qualified provider teaches caretak-
ers and parents how to be involved and to bond with a premature
baby. If your baby comes early, we recommend that you ask your
healthcare provider if a similar program is available in your area.
Finding time for touch 
in the hospital
If you and your baby have been moved to the NICU, the hospital
staff will explain how and why you need to touch your baby. If you
are reading this section to prepare for the possibility of a preterm
baby, or if you don’t need to be transferred to the NICU, we show
you what you need to know.
Benefiting your preemie
Your premature baby experiences plenty of benefits from receiving
your touch, including the following:
 Increases in weight gain
 Improved breathing patterns
 Stabilized heart rate
 Stabilized body temperature
 Decreases in stress levels
 Improved sensory awareness
 Improved sleep patterns
Chapter 8: Preemies and Newborns 133

 Less chance of developing touch aversion, which some pre-
mature babies develop due to their sensitivity to touch and
uncomfortable experiences in the hospital
Premature babies are often isolated upon birth, unlike other
babies, which is why incorporating touch right away is so impor-
tant! Research conducted by the Touch Research Institute (see
Chapter 1) indicates that, on average, premature babies who are
massaged gain almost 50 percent more weight and are released
from the hospital at least six days earlier than premature babies
who are not massaged.
Benefiting the caregiver (that’s you!)
Your baby is not the only one who benefits from your touch. When
you have a premature baby, you get the following benefits from
touch as well:
 You have an opportunity to bond with your baby.
 You have support from the hospital staff and the team that is
working with your special family.
 Your baby is able to come home with you sooner!
 You feel more confident and able to take care of your prema-
ture baby.
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
134
Bonding with your preemie
Even though your baby may be separated from you, it is still possible (and impor-
tant!) to create a warm and loving environment for your preemie that facilitates
bonding. Here are some suggestions:
 If your baby is in an incubator, take some receiving blankets and sleep with them
for a night. The next day, roll them up and place them around your preemie so
she begins to associate your smell with feeling safe and held.
 Talk to your baby often! Your preemie has heard your voice for months and will
feel reassured by hearing it now. You can softly sing lullabies, too.
 Pump and store your breast milk. (For guidelines on storing breast milk, see
www.lalecheleague.org.) If you are separated from your baby, pumping
will keep your breast milk supply flowing.
Because your baby was born early, your breast milk will be different than if your
pregnancy went full term — it will contain different nutrients and be a different con-
sistency. However, your milk will still help your baby’s developing immune system.

Using three types of touch
When you have a premature baby, the hospital staff shows you
three basic types of touch you can use. Your doctors will recom-
mend which type of touch is best for your baby, depending on your
baby’s size, age, and medical status.
At this stage, any nurturing touch is beneficial to both you and
your baby. By including touch in your baby’s first days and weeks,
you are creating a foundation for a stronger, healthier baby who
will thrive from massage!
Here are the three basic types of touch you will use:
 Hand containment: Simply lay your hands on your baby while
he is in the incubator. Depending on the position of your baby
and your baby’s ability to tolerate touch, you may be able to
hold his head in the palm of one hand while your other hand
rests on your baby’s bottom or belly. Or you may introduce
touch just by placing one hand (or a couple of fingers) on
your baby.
A firm touch is more beneficial (and easier tolerated!) than a
light ticklish touch.
This is typically your baby’s first introduction to touch. By
experiencing hand containment, your baby begins to find your
touch and smell familiar and feels more safe and secure each
time you touch him.
Containment helps your baby hold his energy. Preemies and
newborns need help containing their energy because they
lack any control over their bodies. It seems like there isn’t a
relationship between body parts in very young babies; they
are loose and limp. Young babies also haven’t yet learned
skills to deal with stress and emotions. Any time your baby
is in a position similar to being in the womb, he is “held
together,” and his energy is contained.
Babies who are able to contain their energy are more able to
be organized, meaning they are able to regulate their systems
and stay balanced. Organized babies are more focused, learn
faster and easier, and cry less often. This is because their
energy is used for developing, learning, and growing.
 Kangaroo care: When you’ve been given the okay to remove
your baby from the incubator (usually for short periods of
time in the beginning), you may place her on your bare chest.
(You probably want to have her in a diaper!) The name kanga-
roo care comes from the way a kangaroo mother feeds her baby.
Chapter 8: Preemies and Newborns 135

Having close contact with the caregiver regulates a premature
baby’s breathing and heart rate. In this position, your baby
also is affected by your body warmth, which increases your
attachment.
Kangaroo care helps mothers and fathers feel more bonded
and capable as parents. Also, mothers who use kangaroo care
with their premature babies tend to be more successful with
breastfeeding.
 Nurturing touch: As your baby grows, you will be able to
incorporate more touch into his experiences. While you are in
the hospital, your touch will be mostly about holding your
baby and having skin-to-skin contact. This type of touch is
important to create a foundation of safe and nurturing contact
for your baby that will later build into a massage.
Moving slowly
Premature babies come into the world before their neurological
systems have fully developed. The reason babies are first held
instead of touched is for containment (which we explain in the 
previous section). Because their neurological systems aren’t fully
developed, premature babies may not be able to handle touch.
Containing their bodies and energy gives them the safe, secure
feeling they experienced in the womb.
Don’t be discouraged if your baby reacts negatively to your touch.
Just remember to move slowly and be patient. Your patience will
pay off as you watch your baby become more active, alert, and
responsive to your touch.
Continuing contact when 
you get home
When your baby is well enough to go home with you, it is impor-
tant to continue the skin-to-skin contact and holding techniques.
Move softly and slowly. Just a few minutes (or even seconds) of
some kind of tactile stimulation and nurturing touch, such as hold-
ing, rocking, or massaging, will do you and your baby a world of
good!
Creating a positive experience
Here are some tips to make massage and nurturing touch for your
preemie a good experience for both of you:
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
136

 Keep your movements slow and gentle.
 Don’t use any oils yet. You may use warm water to reduce the
friction of your hands on your baby.
 Keep your baby very warm. You may want to massage your
baby with his clothes on (see the upcoming section
“Providing contact through clothing”).
 Start the massage on your baby’s legs, or on her fingers and
toes. These areas of the body are less stimulating and are non-
invasive. You may even begin just by holding these areas of
the body.
 Avoid upward strokes (those that move toward the head).
They may be too stimulating to your preemie. Keep your
strokes moving in a downward (toward the feet) direction.
 Your baby will probably be very stimulated by a back mas-
sage, so avoid this area until your preemie is able to tolerate
the stimulation of a massage on the front of the body.
 Try to avoid too light of a touch. Tickling your baby is very
stimulating!
 As your baby becomes stronger, you can begin to massage her
buttocks while you are holding her. Just lightly rubbing your
full palm over her whole butt will suffice.
 Most of your touch with your baby will be given while he is
lying on your chest in a reclining position. Your baby will most
likely be too small to lie by himself on a bed or on the floor.
 Keep the lights and your voice low. Avoid using music until
your preemie is less easily stimulated.
 Maintain eye contact and reassure your baby with positive
affirmations like, “Mommy (or Daddy) is here, and everything
is okay.”
Your preemie may be so tiny that you can only touch him with a
finger. That’s okay: Use your judgment and follow his cues (which
we discuss next) to give him the level of stimulation he needs.
Responding to your baby’s cues
While you are in the hospital, you have two key ways of knowing if
your baby becomes overstimulated. First, you can observe that
she has a negative response; see Chapter 4 for a discussion of the
cues that indicate a baby is overstimulated. Second, the monitors
she’s hooked to keep track of your baby’s vital signs.
Chapter 8: Preemies and Newborns 137

When you come home from the hospital, you no longer have the
benefit of monitors, so you must keep a close eye on your baby’s
reactions to touch. By now you should have a good idea of how
much stimulation is too much and how your baby responds if she
is overstimulated.
If you see that your baby is becoming overstimulated, change her
environment by reducing the amount of stimuli:
 Dim the lights.
 Stop talking or singing.
 Quiet other noises in the room, such as the television, the
radio, and people talking or coming in and out of the room.
 Hold your baby without moving your hand(s) across her body.
Welcoming Your Newborn
Bundle of Joy
Preemies aren’t the only babies to benefit from skin-to-skin contact
and touch. Here are some suggestions to help you provide touch
for your newborn in the hospital:
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
138
Failure to thrive syndrome
When you bring your baby to your pediatrician for well-baby visits, your doctor doc-
uments your baby’s weight, length, and head circumference and compares his
development with other babies his age using a growth chart. If a baby is not grow-
ing or loses weight, he may be diagnosed with failure to thrive syndrome. Your physi-
cian will track when the lack of development occurs and help you find ways to
encourage your baby’s growth.
With a premature baby, a corrected age may be used to plot his growth. The cor-
rected age is figured by subtracting the number of weeks of prematurity from the
postnatal age. Growth charts are available just for premature babies, but they may
not be reliable due to the small number of premature babies used to compile the
statistics. Whichever method your doctor chooses (to adjust the baby’s age or to
use a preemie growth chart), make sure she uses it consistently.
Most premature babies catch up to the growth of other newborns by the age of 2. 

 Ask the delivery room nurse to place your newborn on top of
your bare chest as soon as possible after delivery so you can
immediately have skin-to-skin contact.
After natural childbirth, a newborn placed on your chest will
most likely crawl to your nipple and begin to suck.
 Ask your healthcare provider to delay tests and vaccinations
for as long as possible (approximately one hour) so you can
have more immediate bonding time with your baby. (See the
sidebar “Routine hospital tests” for a rundown of the proce-
dures that take place shortly after delivery.)
Holding your baby just after birth increases the production of
oxytocin and endorphins, the hormones that create mothering
feelings and increase attachment.
 Use this early bonding time to gaze into your baby’s eyes.
You’ll be surprised at how alert he is!
The more time you spend with your newborn in the hospital, the
stronger your attachment will be, and the greater your sensitivity
toward your baby’s needs and cues will be.
Chapter 8: Preemies and Newborns 139
Routine hospital tests
Just after birth (and hopefully after a little mother–baby bonding time), the hospital
performs routine exams, tests, and vaccinations on your baby. Here are some of the
most common procedures:
 The Apgar test: Designed to determine whether your baby needs to be closely
monitored, the Apgar measures heart rate, breathing, color, muscle tone, and
response to stimulation.
 Vitamin K shot: Because newborns may be deficient in vitamin K, it is routine to
give babies an injection that aids in blood clotting and reduces the risk of abnor-
mal bleeding.
 Eye ointment: An antibiotic is put into your baby’s eyes to prevent any germs
that she may have had contact with during labor from causing an infection.
 Blood tests: Most hospitals test for your baby’s blood type, Rh factor, sickle cell
disease, phenylketonuria (PKU), hypothyroidism, and galactosemia. Many hos-
pitals routinely check for other diseases as well.
 Hearing screening test: Many hospitals routinely offer hearing screening tests
immediately after delivery.

Providing contact through clothing
If you deliver a healthy, full-term baby, you can actually begin to use
simple massage techniques while you’re in the hospital. However,
keep in mind that newborns, like preemies, are sensitive to over-
stimulation. For this reason, it’s a good idea to keep your baby’s
clothes on when you first begin to massage.
Why can removing a baby’s clothes cause overstimulation? There
are several possible reasons:
 Very young babies lose heat rapidly. They simply feel too cold
and uncomfortable with their clothes off.
 Removing clothes from a very young baby can be difficult.
Because your baby doesn’t have control of his head, slipping
a onesie off an infant or preemie is hard!
 Many babies seem to feel vulnerable with their clothes off.
If you massage your baby with his clothes on, you also don’t have to
worry about using oils or finding the right place to do your massage.
A good stroke to start off with in the hospital is the Dolphin Stroke
(see Chapter 4), which is easy to do and relaxing for your baby.
Establishing a massage routine
at home
The easiest way to make massage part of your newborn’s life is
to establish a routine early. It’s easy to do: Simply set aside a few
minutes in your day for massage. If you can create a regular time
to give your baby a massage, she will begin to look forward to it —
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
140
Rooming in
You’ll have an easier time incorporating touch and strengthening your attachment
with your baby in the hospital if you elect to room in — meaning that your baby stays
in the hospital room with you rather than in the nursery. You may be unsure about
making this choice because you will need to rest after labor. However, while you
are in the hospital, the staff does routine visits around the clock for your entire stay,
so you really won’t get the rest you need until you get home. Keeping your baby in
the room with you makes it easier for you to touch, hold, cuddle, and feed him as
much as your little one needs.

even to expect it! In Chapter 10, we show you how to incorporate
massage into daily or weekly rituals, such as changing diapers and
bathing.
When you first bring your newborn home, we suggest that you use
the techniques we describe in Chapter 5, beginning with your baby’s
legs. These techniques are easy to use, less stimulating than some
of the others in this book, and noninvasive. You can use any of them
on your baby while keeping her clothes on.
Your coauthor Joanne has been massaging her baby, Ava, since
birth. As I write this, Ava (at 7 months) “asks” for a massage by
going into position: lying on her back with her arms up over her
head and making eye contact. She nearly always does this after a
bath (our regular massage time) and on the changing table.
Because she has been receiving regular massages since she was
born, Ava is able to tolerate a full massage (to both the front and
back sides of her body) without becoming overstimulated. In fact,
the massage relaxes and grounds her. (See the sidebar on
“Grounding.”)
Using touch while you nurse
your baby
In the early weeks of your baby’s life, much of his awake time will
be spent eating. If you are breastfeeding, be prepared to nurse your
baby every two to three hours around the clock. If you are using
formula, feedings occur less frequently (because formula isn’t as
easily digested as breast milk) — around every three to four hours.
Chapter 8: Preemies and Newborns 141
Grounding
To be grounded means to be fully present in the moment. Your energy is down low
in your body. You are aware of your feelings, your thoughts, and the people around
you, and you feel your feet on the ground.
You can tell that your baby is grounded when she seems settled, alert, and focused.
To ground yourself, take a look at the section on “Keeping your own stress level in
check” in Chapter 2. While you practice the breathing technique described there,
remove your shoes and stand with your legs hip width apart. Bend your knees a
little and tip your pelvis forward slightly. As you breathe, visualize your energy
moving down through your body and through your feet. Imagine that you are con-
nected to the earth through your feet. 

Nursing is quiet time that you spend cuddling, loving, and feeding
your baby all at once. You can nurse your baby whether you are
breastfeeding or using a bottle. Dads can nurse their babies, too!
If you are breastfeeding, and/or if this is your first baby, you may
need some time to settle in and become used to feeding your baby.
After the two of you become familiar with nursing and it becomes
second nature, you can incorporate touch into your nursing 
schedule.
During your baby’s first weeks and months, you are building up to
giving him a full massage.
Here are some tips for incorporating nurturing touch while you
nurse your baby:
 While holding your baby, use a free hand to stroke down your
baby’s body.
 If you are breastfeeding in a side-lying position, you can make
small circles on the bottom of one of your baby’s feet using
your thumb. When you switch to the other breast, massage
the bottom of your baby’s other foot.

The advantages of breastfeeding
Breastfeeding offer many benefits to both you and your baby. We certainly recog-
nize that everybody’s situation is different, and for some women (due to health
issues, work schedules, or other concerns), breastfeeding is out of the question.
But if breastfeeding is possible for you, or if you are on the fence about whether to
breastfeed or use formula, keep these things in mind:
 Breastfeeding significantly reduces the risk of you developing breast cancer.
 Breast milk is more easily digested than formula and produces less allergies in
your baby.
 Breast milk contains antibodies that boost your baby’s immune system.
 Breast milk is free!
 Your uterus will shrink back to its normal size faster if you breastfeed.
 Breastfeeding burns approximately 500 to 1,000 calories a day.
 Breast milk helps premature babies “catch up” faster!
 Breastfeeding releases hormones that help mothers relax.
For much more information about breastfeeding, see Breastfeeding For Dummies by
Sharon Perkins and Carol Vannais (Wiley.)

 If she can tolerate having her head touched, lightly stroke
your baby’s head and gaze into her eyes as she nurses.
 If you are bottle-feeding your baby (with breast milk or formula),
your partner can become part of the bonding experience by
stroking your baby’s legs, feet, and hands while she eats.
It’s not a bad idea if your partner massages you during nursing as
well. New parents need rest and relaxation, too!
If you are just too exhausted from late night feedings and new 
parenthood in general to even think about massage while you’re
feeding the baby, take care of yourself and just rest during nursing.
There will be plenty of time for massage as your baby develops.
Adding to Your Massage Routine
Throughout this chapter, we provide suggestions for incorporating
massage into your preemie’s or newborn’s life without overstimu-
lating him. At this point, you may be asking, “How do I know when I
can increase the amount of massage time and add more techniques
to the routine I’m already using?”
Here are some pointers to answer that question:
 When your baby’s muscles and facial expressions are relaxed
during the massage, that means he’s comfortable with what
you’re doing and may be ready for more.
 With your preemie or newborn, introduce only one or two
new techniques at a time. This way, you are better able to
gauge her stimulation level before it’s too late and she’s over-
stimulated. Plus, you’ll be able to keep track of which specific
techniques are overstimulating.
 If you have used only downward strokes on your baby so far,
try one of the techniques that uses an upward stroke, and
watch your baby’s reaction.
 If you have tried most (or all) of the techniques for the front
side of the body (see Chapter 5) and your baby doesn’t
become overstimulated, and if your baby likes to lay on his
tummy, you may want to try out techniques on the back side
of the body (see Chapter 7).
 When your baby begins to enjoy having his head and face
touched, introduce some of the techniques we show in
Chapter 6.

 Creating rhymes and introducing games
 Making massage a family affair
 Using massage to set limits with your toddler
I
n earlier chapters, we caution you to be sure to keep your
baby’s stimulation level to a minimum if possible. In this chap-
ter, we change our tune. With older babies and toddlers, you need
to use stimulation to keep their interest so they’ll stay still long
enough to receive a massage.
In this chapter, we include some information about your child’s
development — particularly about her growing interest in play and
games — to help you be creative in finding ways to stimulate your
baby or toddler during the massage. We suggest incorporating
rhymes and games into massage time, as well as bringing other
family members into the mix. Finally, we discuss how you can use
massage to help set limits with your toddler.
Holding Still: Keeping Your
Child’s Interest
Do you remember the days when you knew where your baby was
every second (because you were holding her almost all the time)?
Now your baby is constantly on the move, and your time and
energy is spent making sure that your house is child-friendly and
your little one doesn’t get bored. Sometimes you may long for the
good old days, filled with lots of quiet cuddle time!
If you have been massaging your baby since infancy, you’ll have an
easier time now getting her attention and holding it long enough for
a massage. For babies who are experienced at receiving massages,

it is just part of the daily routine, much like taking a bath. However,
now that she is older, you need to be creative and introduce some
fun ideas to keep her interest.
If you bought this book so that you can begin massaging your 
2-year-old, your task of keeping her still long enough for a massage
will be challenging, but the rewards will be great. Be patient, and
know that whatever touch you bring to her at this age will benefit
both of you.
Massaging your older baby
When we refer to an older baby, we’re talking about a child who is
6 to 12 months old. In this section, we show you some behaviors
you can expect to see in your older baby and ways to incorporate
his interests during a massage.
Anticipating your baby’s development
Here are some developmental milestones and interests you can
expect to see from your older baby:
 Your baby spends less time on your lap and becomes more
interested in his environment.
 He starts to crawl probably between the ages of 6 and 9 months,
and shortly thereafter he begins pulling himself up to stand.
 He becomes more interested in his body and loves to put his
toes in his mouth.
 Your baby grabs everything within reach!
 He notices when you leave and is becoming shy around
strangers.
 His language is developing, so you hear a lot of cooing and
babbling.
 Your baby begins teething.
Occupying your baby during a massage
To continue to fit massage into your baby’s day, our best advice is
to get creative. You know your baby best; use whatever she is
interested in to keep her attention. Here are some examples:
 Babies love encouragement as they learn to do new things.
While your baby is learning to crawl, give her a few minutes
to practice while you encourage her. When she becomes frus-
trated, reward her attempts and ease her frustration with a
massage.
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
146

 Older babies love to see their reflections in mirrors. You can
place your baby (who can now sit on her own!) in front of a
floor-to-ceiling mirror and massage her neck and shoulders or
back while she laughs at her reflection.
 Teething may cause serious discomfort for your baby at this
stage. You can massage your baby’s gums (see Chapter 11)
and cheeks (see Chapter 5) to ease the teething pain.
 Older babies love to put things in their mouths. Give your
baby a safe teething toy while she is on her back, and let her
suck away while you massage the front side of her body.
Incorporating rhymes into massage
Most older babies love rhymes. They are just beginning to practice
their language skills, and they love to play games with words.
Rhymes can help keep your baby interested as you give a massage,
and an added bonus is that you are teaching your baby language
and rhythm at the same time.
Following are two examples of rhymes that you can sing or chant
during the massage. They each refer to movements that you can
incorporate into the massage.
You can choose from literally hundreds of children’s rhymes. If
you’re in the mood to learn some new ones, we suggest a quick
search on the Web. For example, you can find lyrics to many chil-
dren’s songs and nursery rhymes online at www.mamalisa.com.
Roll Over
There were three on the bed
And (your baby’s name) said,
“Roll over, roll over.”
(Roll your baby over and begin massaging the other side.)
So they all rolled over and one fell out.
(Roll your baby over again, or keep him on that side for the 
massage.)
There were two on the bed
And (your baby’s name) said,
“Roll over, roll over.”
So they all rolled over and one fell out.
(Roll your baby over again, or keep him on that side for the 
massage.)
Chapter 9: Older Babies and Toddlers 147

There was one on the bed
And no one said,
“Roll over, roll over.”
Horsey Horsey
Horsey, horsey don’t you stop
Just let your feet go clippety clop.
The tail goes swish
(Roll your baby onto her belly and massage her bottom.)
And the wheels go round.
Giddy up, we’re homeward bound.
Ain’t in a hurry, ain’t in a scurry,
(Slowly roll your baby onto her back and massage the front side.)
We’ll be on our way. Hey!
Horsey, Horsey on our way,
We’ll be traveling many a day.
The tail goes swish
(Roll your baby onto her belly and massage her bottom.)
And the wheels go round.
Giddy up, we’re homeward bound.
(Pull your baby up to sitting or standing, and finish with a hug.)
Massaging your toddler
A toddler is 12 months to 2 years old. In this section, we show you
some behaviors you can expect to see in your toddler and ways to
incorporate her interests during a massage.
Toddlers have a natural curiosity and a short span of attention.
Limit your massages to just a few minutes, and you will find it
easier to keep your toddler’s attention.
Anticipating your toddler’s development
Here’s what you can expect to see during this age:
 Your baby has transformed into a walking (and falling!) toddler.
 She is your little helper — eager to try to dress herself and do
things around the house.
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
148

 No is her favorite word.
 She parrots everything you say.
 Your older toddler can run and climb.
 She loves physical games.
 Your older toddler loves to jump and practice gymnastics.
 She enjoys creating art and playing with shapes.
Incorporating rhymes and songs into massage
As with an older baby, you can use rhymes and songs to try to
keep your toddler’s interest during a massage. Your toddler will want
to be part of the action whenever possible, so consider saying or
singing rhymes that encourage him to interact. For example, you
may want to try “If You’re Happy and You Know It.”
If You’re Happy and You Know It
If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands. (clap clap)
If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands. (clap clap)
If you’re happy and you know it, then your face will surely
show it.
If you’re happy and you know it clap your hands. (clap, clap)
You can incorporate the body parts you wish to massage by chang-
ing the verse to something like, “If you’re happy and you know it
touch your leg.”
If you don’t feel like hearing your own voice all the time, you can
also sing along with your toddler to popular children’s music while
giving him a massage. CDs such as these are fun to sing along to:
 Peter, Paul, & Mommy by Peter, Paul, and Mary (Warner
Brothers)
 Free to Be. . .You and Me by Marlo Thomas and Friends (Arista)
 All You Need Is Love: Beatles Songs for Kids by Various Artists
(Music for Little People)
 Singable Songs for the Very Young: Great with a Peanut-Butter
Sandwich by Raffi (Rounder Records)
 Beauty and the Beast: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack by
Various Artists (Disney)
Reading books during massage
If you are not yet reading to your toddler on a regular basis, we
strongly recommend it! You can use reading time to give your toddler
Chapter 9: Older Babies and Toddlers 149

a massage. Place your toddler in your lap and let her turn the pages
for you while you give her a massage.
If you need some suggestions for classic kids’ books to have in
your library, here are just a few:
 Are You My Mother? by P.D. Eastman
 Any stories by Dr. Seuss
 Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak
 Goodnight Moon by Margaret Wise Brown
 Will You Be My Friend? A Bunny and Bird Story by Nancy Tafuri
Unless your toddler has been receiving massages regularly for a
while, she may be stimulated by the massage and not ready to go
to sleep immediately afterwards. Avoid massaging your toddler
before bedtime if this is the case.
Playing games during massage
With a little creativity, you can make massage a game. Here are
some ideas to get you started:
 Play “Simon says” and tell your toddler to stay still while
mommy massages his shoulders.
 Play horsey by letting your toddler bounce on your knee and
massage his back while he bounces away.
 Play hide-and-seek with the rule that whoever gets caught
receives a massage.
 Ask your toddler to lie on his belly over a beach ball, and give
him a back massage. Encourage him to have fun bouncing and
rolling on the ball before and after the massage.
Another way you can sneak a massage into your toddler’s day is to
catch him while he is watching his favorite video.
Making Massage a Family Affair
So far in this book, we’ve focused on massage as a one-on-one
experience between a parent or caregiver and a child. But you can
use the massage techniques and ideas we suggest in this book to
encourage stronger bonds between siblings and the entire family.
In this section, we explain how to accomplish this goal.
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
150

Including your older child
If you have older children, we encourage you to include them in
the giving and receiving of massages. Here are some benefits:
 You can keep a sibling’s natural jealously toward a new baby
to a minimum.
 You teach your children how to give and receive nurturing
and compassionate touch.
 The bond between the siblings is enhanced.
 You may be able to take a much-needed break!
The bond between siblings is a strong one, and massage can help
make it stronger. Although many siblings have ups and downs in
their relationship from childhood to adulthood, the bond typically
outlives the parental relationship and lasts longer than most 
marriages.
If you’re going to ask your older child to give your younger one a
massage, obviously you need to keep in mind the age and abilities
of the older child, along with your younger child’s needs. For exam-
ple, you may be able to teach a 7- or 8-year-old some of the more
complicated techniques we cover in this book (like The Taffy Pull
we describe in Chapter 5), but younger children need to stay with
easier techniques (like the Dolphin Stroke we show in Chapter 4).
Here are some tips for getting an older sibling started with massage:
 Have your older child choose which massage technique he
loves the best and let him be “in charge” of giving your
younger child that particular massage.
 Have your child practice his technique on you first, so you
can help him determine the right amount of pressure to use.
 Encourage your child to practice massage strokes on her
favorite doll.
If the sibling giving the massage is fairly young, we strongly recom-
mend that you supervise the massage at all times. Children may
not be able to read cues of overstimulation (which we discuss in
Chapter 4), and they may use too much pressure during the mas-
sage. Both children involved in the massage may need you to guide
them and make sure that the touch they are giving and receiving is
safe and loving.
Chapter 9: Older Babies and Toddlers 151

Getting creative with family 
massages
If you want to include more members of your family in the giving
and receiving of massages, that’s terrific. There really isn’t one 
particular way to make that happen because everybody’s family is
different. We encourage you to experiment and find the best way
for everyone in your family to benefit.
Here are some ideas that may help get your creative juices flowing:
 While one parent is reading a toddler or older baby to sleep,
the other can give her a massage.
 During TV time, have siblings take turns giving each other
massages, and the parents can do the same.
 Use massage to give a step-sibling the opportunity to bond
and connect with a new baby.
 Encourage massage during family vacations. A new schedule —
even a fun one — can throw everyone’s sleep patterns off, so
use massage as a way to bring relaxation and quiet time into
your vacation plans.
Using Massage to Your Toddler’s
Advantage
Toddlers struggle to reconcile their need for autonomy with their
need for their parents’ help and guidance. One of the many ways
that kids in this age group express their autonomy is by saying no.
Sometimes toddlers say no to everything, even things that you know
they want. You may find that your toddler says he doesn’t want a
bowl of cereal, for example, only to turn around and demand that
same bowl a few seconds later.
Your job as a parent or caregiver is to set limits and boundaries for
your toddler. You may sometimes doubt this, but it’s good for your
toddler to experience the frustration of not getting everything he
wants and to have limits set. At the same time, it’s good for you to
respect your toddler’s no. Listening and responding to your tod-
dler’s words teaches him that he has power in the world and some
control over his environment.
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
152

You can avoid power struggles with your toddler by choosing your
battles wisely. For example, if your toddler wants to wear a winter
hat in the summer, let her. However, if she wants to cross a busy
street without holding your hand, that’s obviously non-negotiable.
What if your toddler refuses a massage? We encourage you to
respect what she says. Doing so sends her some clear messages:
 Her body is hers, and she has a say over who touches it. This
is a very important message to give any child. The statistics
on childhood sexual abuse indicate that 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6
boys will be sexually abused by the age of 18. Perpetrators of
sexual abuse are most often people that the child knows, not
strangers. Teaching your toddler to say no to unwanted touch
Chapter 9: Older Babies and Toddlers 153
How to protect your child
from sexual abuse
Because the incidence of childhood sexual abuse is so prevalent, education and
awareness of the facts and risks can help you to protect your family. Following are
some tips to keep your children safe:
 Teach your child about touch. There is a difference between safe touch and
touch that doesn’t feel right. Make sure your toddler knows that no one should
touch his private parts. Let your child know that he can say no to anybody who
wants to touch him.
 Let your child show affection to friends and family members on his own terms.
Don’t make him kiss or hug someone.
 Let your child know early on that secrets are not okay. Most offenders try to
trick children into thinking they can’t tell anyone about what is happening
because it is a secret. If your child knows that keeping secrets is not okay, he
will know that something is wrong.
 Trust your child. Children don’t lie about abuse. If your child tells you that some-
one touched him and it didn’t feel right, believe him!
 Remember that most perpetrators are people that you or your children are famil-
iar with. The statistics show that it is not strangers we have to be aware of, but
people who our children are taught to trust.
 Teach your child the proper names of body parts. You can begin by using the
words vagina and penis during diaper changes. Having the right words to use
makes communication between parents and children easier.

will decrease her vulnerability to being abused. For more tips,
see the sidebar “How to protect your child from sexual abuse.”
 You respect her feelings and her boundaries.
 You encourage her to be autonomous.
We also encourage you to respect your toddler when she specifically
requests a massage. If you can’t do it at that exact moment, tell her
when you will be able to. Accommodating your toddler when she
comes to you with such a request shows her that you are sensitive
to her struggle with independence and dependence and that it’s
okay for her to have needs. Keep in mind that childhood needs that
are met tend to go away. Needs that are not met are carried with us
into adulthood.
Setting and respecting boundaries
Boundaries are what separate me from you; they simplify life and
define expectations. Creating and setting boundaries for toddlers
helps them be safe and lets them know what their limits are.
Here are some examples of common family boundaries:
 Knocking on a closed bedroom door before entering
 Asking permission before giving physical touch
 Prohibiting hitting and biting
Boundaries can also be rules and limits:
 “You must hold my hand while crossing the street.”
 “You have to wear a coat in freezing weather.”
 “You can’t play with Daddy’s laptop.” 
Babies and toddlers learn by watching how others behave. If you
model clear and consistent boundaries with your partner and your
other children, your younger children find out how to behave and
have healthy relationships.
Here are some tips to help you be effective in setting boundaries:
 Be consistent. Toddlers and children get confused if your
limits and rules are constantly changing.
 Be aware of your child’s development. Knowing what she is
capable of emotionally and physically lets you set realistic
boundaries.
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
154

 Remember that setting boundaries is not about controlling
your children. It’s about keeping them safe and helping them
learn self-discipline.
When massaging your older baby or toddler, you can set bound-
aries and let him know that you respect his by doing the following:
 Ask his permission to give him a massage.
 If your children are giving each other massages, make sure
both are willing participants.
 Stop the massage if your child shows signs of overstimulation
or is bored and looking for something else to do.
 Adhere to his requests. Sometimes toddlers have requests
that may seem silly to us but are a way for them to express
and practice their autonomy. For example, your toddler may
be fine with you massaging his arms but refuses to let you
touch his legs. This is a perfect opportunity for you to respect
his boundaries.
Teaching discipline through massage
Massage gives you a consistent opportunity to create the kind of
relationship your child needs in order to be receptive to gentle 
discipline. Here are some things that a child needs in order to
respond favorably to loving guidance:
 Your child needs to trust you.
 He needs to recognize clear and consistent boundaries
between you.
 He needs to learn how to communicate with you (both ver-
bally and nonverbally).
 He needs to know that you are sensitive to his needs.
The word discipline literally means “to teach.” Massaging your
older baby or toddler actually helps you teach her about disci-
pline, because massage helps children find out about boundaries,
trust, and nonverbal communication. In fact, even a newborn or
infant picks up lessons about discipline through massage.
Parents who massage and touch their children regularly become
sensitive caretakers attuned to their children’s needs. This type of
parenting builds a relationship based on trust. Because you have
responded to your children’s needs with compassion and sensitiv-
ity, your babies grow up to respect (instead of fear) and count on
your positive authority.
Chapter 9: Older Babies and Toddlers 155

You create positive authority by doing the following:
 Not engaging in power struggles
 Setting appropriate limits and boundaries
 Disciplining your child with sensitivity and compassion
None of this means that you need to be a pushover. In fact, when you
need to express your positive authority, it’s best to be firm without
being controlling or overbearing. Each time that you express posi-
tive authority, you strengthen trust and mutual respect with your
children in a non-adversarial and cooperative way.
Continuing to massage your children enables you to stay attuned,
sensitive, and aware of their changing needs. Your relationship will
grow and evolve as they do.
For more information regarding discipline, we recommend the fol-
lowing books: 
 Natural Family Living: The Mother Magazine Guide to Parenting
by Peggy O’Mara (Pocket Books)
 The Discipline Book: How to Have a Better-Behaved Child from
Birth to Age Ten by Martha and William Sears
Handling tantrums
The key to responding to temper tantrums appropriately begins
with understanding why they occur. Toddlers typically have temper
tantrums when they become overwhelmed with feelings that they
do not know how to handle. Some things that trigger these intense
feelings are being tired, hungry, frustrated, and angry.
Unfortunately, many times your toddler will have a tantrum in a
public place, and you may feel overwhelmed with the responsibility
of figuring out how best to handle the situation with people watch-
ing. Tantrums are very stressful for both you and your child.
Here are some suggestions to keep in mind for when a tantrum
strikes:
 You need to try to remain as calm and objective as you can.
 You may need to literally hold your toddler so he doesn’t hurt
himself, or to carry him to somewhere safe and private.
 You don’t want to just ignore the tantrum. Remember, your
toddler is having a tantrum because he doesn’t know how to
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
156

handle intense emotions. Stay with him during the tantrum
and do your best to remain loving. Use your intuition: Soothing
words may help, but so may firm ones like “I know that you
are angry and tired, but we have to finish shopping. If we
don’t finish, there won’t be anything for dinner tonight.”
 After your toddler has calmed down, spend some time talking
with him and helping him find words for his feelings so you
can both understand what happened.
 Because your toddler has experienced a lot of stress, you
can help him release it by giving him a massage. Don’t worry:
You are not rewarding the tantrum by doing so. After he has
calmed down and you have talked about what happened,
giving him a massage reminds him that he does have the skills
to calm himself down.

F
inding the right time to massage your baby is key to making
the experience a success. In this chapter, we show you how to
determine the best time based on several factors that may affect
your massage. We demonstrate ways you can bring massage into
your baby’s life on a daily (or at least routine) basis, and we walk
you through a five-minute massage. Finally, we have brainstormed
about — and experimented with! — times and places you can mas-
sage your baby other than the usual culprits, and we share our
insights with you.
Choosing the Right Time
To identify the right time to massage your baby, you need to take
several factors into consideration:
 Your baby’s age: We discuss this topic in the following sec-
tion, “Deciding Whether to Stimulate or Not.”
 Your baby’s tolerance level for stimulation: We cover this
topic in detail in the following section as well.
 Your family’s schedule: If mornings are a hectic time for your
family, for example, you may want to massage your baby in
the late afternoon.

 The goal of your massage: Whether you want to stimulate your
baby, put him to sleep, or address a common health ailment
(which we discuss in Chapter 11) will help you determine the
right time.
 Any health or attachment issues your baby may have:
Chapters 11 and 12 cover issues that may affect when would
be the best time for your baby to receive a massage.
Deciding Whether to Stimulate
or Not
One of the first things you want to consider when deciding when to
massage your baby is how your baby may respond to the stimulation
of the massage. Age is a key factor: Some babies are very sensitive
to stimulation, and some older babies and toddlers crave it.
Very young babies
In your baby’s early weeks, it’s best to keep the stimulation level to
a minimum. If your baby is very sensitive to stimulation, just hold-
ing her may be enough in the beginning weeks, or you may use a
limited massage routine with your baby’s clothes on.
If you do use massage during your baby’s first few weeks of life,
here are some tips to keep in mind:
 If your young baby enjoys baths, try giving the massage
before she takes a bath.
 If your young baby finds baths stressful, keep your massage
and bathing experiences separate. For very sensitive babies,
you may even want to bathe and massage on different days.
(Later in this chapter, we offer tips on taking the stress out of
the bathing experience.)
 You want to avoid giving a massage before naptime or bed-
time because your baby may have trouble falling asleep.
 If you have a busy day of errands or visitors, you may want to
skip the massage altogether because your own stress level
may be too high.
 It’s best to give the massage when the house is quiet and you
are relaxed.
 You’re better off skipping the massage altogether if finding the
“right time” today is becoming stressful.
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
160

 You don’t want to massage your baby during diaper changes
until your baby is a little more experienced at receiving mas-
sages. Very young babies find diaper changes (and getting
undressed) stressful. Adding stimulation on top of an already
stimulating and stressful situation may be just too much.
More experienced babies
After you’ve been giving your baby massages for a while — one to
three months — you won’t have to be so careful about her stimula-
tion level. If she hasn’t already, she’ll soon begin to relax during a
massage, regardless of what time of day it is.
Keep in mind that relaxed doesn’t necessarily mean sleepy. Your
baby may be relaxed yet alert and wanting to play after a massage.
On the other hand, with the right technique, you can put your
relaxed baby to sleep in no time by using massage.
If you are not worried about stimulating your baby too much, here
are some tips to keep in mind:
 You can massage your baby throughout the day by focusing
on different parts of his body during each diaper change.
 You can start off a busy day with a bath followed by a mas-
sage. Your baby will be relaxed and alert, making the day
easier for both of you.
 It’s possible to use a bath and massage to cure the boredom
blues for both of you!
Massaging Baby Before
or After Nap
You are the best judge of whether to massage your baby before or
after he takes a nap, based on his potential for stimulation. In this
section, we help you determine if your baby is getting enough
sleep and how you can help him get more if he has trouble nap-
ping. Also, if you choose to massage him immediately prior to or
after a nap, we offer some suggestions for which massage tech-
niques to use.
Studies conducted by the Touch Research Institute in 2001 indicate
that babies who receive a massage by a parent before going to sleep
fall asleep with less difficulty and have better sleep quality.
Chapter 10: Fitting Massage into Nap, Bath, and Diaper Time 161

Knowing how much sleep to expect
You can determine how much sleep your baby should be getting
by his age. Below are the ranges of sleep that babies need, on aver-
age, at certain ages:
 Birth to 3 months: 15 to 18 hours per day
 3 to 6 months: 13 to 16 hours a day
 6 months to 2 years: 12 to 14 hours a day
Realizing the importance of naps
You want to encourage your baby to nap during the day so that
the quality of her nighttime sleep is better. Babies who skip naps
become overly tired and have a difficult time falling and staying
asleep.
Newborns nap frequently; they typically sleep after every feeding,
which means every two to four hours (depending on your baby
and whether you are using formula or breastfeeding). As your baby
grows older, she needs less frequent naps.
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
162
When will my baby sleep 
through the night?
This may be the question parents most frequently ask of doctors and other parents.
The truth is that when babies are young, “sleeping through the night” really means
sleeping for about a five-hour stretch. Babies simply aren’t wired to sleep for much
longer at one time. They have shorter sleep cycles than adults and wake repeat-
edly through the night. Sleep problems often arise for the parents because some
babies have difficulty falling back to sleep.
You can try a variety of methods and follow many different philosophies to help your
baby fall back asleep. We are advocates of the gentle approach to parenting your
baby back to sleep. Your coauthor Joanne has used massage to successfully help
her daughter Ava get back to sleep. On the few occasions that Ava woke up in the
middle of the night wanting to play, giving her a massage proved tremendously help-
ful in coaxing her to go back to sleep.
You can find more gentle approaches to helping your baby sleep in The Baby Book
by William and Martha Sears and The No-Cry Sleep Solution: Gentle Ways to Help
Your Baby Sleep Through the Night by Elizabeth Pantley (Contemporary Books).

Around 6 to 9 months of age, your baby will probably settle into a
routine of taking two naps per day: one in the morning and one in
the afternoon. Sometime around 12 months, she may begin to have
only one longer nap per day, perhaps in the early afternoon.
Timing your massage right
If you want to give your baby a pre-nap massage, be sure to time it
right. It doesn’t take long for your baby to develop a general rou-
tine: You’ll begin to notice that he typically takes naps around the
same time every day, and you can look for the following signs that
he’s getting sleepy:
 He becomes fussy.
 He rubs his eyes.
 He stares off into space.
 He’s easily frustrated.
You want to plan your massage in advance so that the massage
isn’t pushing him past his nap time, which may actually keep him
awake. Instead, use the massage to gently lead him into sleep.
We don’t recommend that you give your baby a massage before
every nap. He may become accustomed to falling asleep this way
and begin to rely on a massage to sleep.
Sometimes babies refuse to nap. If yours does, you may need to
establish a routine for him. For example, around the time he
should be napping, begin a massage to relax him. At other times,
use other methods to induce sleep such as rocking him, wearing
him in a sling, or taking him for a walk in the stroller.
It’s easy to take the power struggle out of nap time. Actions like
massaging your baby or wearing him in a sling let him fall asleep
naturally.
Giving a great massage before a nap
Certain techniques are naturally more soothing to babies than
others, and in this section we’ve put together some techniques from
Chapters 5, 6, and 7 that we think are great to use before naptime.
For a massage before naptime, use only strokes that move in a
downward direction. Strokes that move up (toward the heart) are
too stimulating.
Chapter 10: Fitting Massage into Nap, Bath, and Diaper Time 163

The sequence of techniques that we recommend in this section are
for babies who have been receiving massage regularly for some
time and are able to tolerate it.
The Sleeper
Even for a baby experienced at receiving massages, there are a lot
of techniques in this sequence. Feel free to omit some if time and
your baby’s tolerance level do not allow all of them.
1. Massage both the front and back side of the legs using
the following techniques (see Chapters 5 and 7):
• The Taffy Pull
• Thumb Circles
• Raking
2. Massage the belly using the following techniques
(see Chapter 5):
• The Water Wheel 
• The Open Book Stroke
3. Massage the buttocks using the Large Bottom Stroke
(see Chapter 7).
4. Massage the back using the Long Effleurage Stroke
(see Chapter 7).
5. Massage the hands using the following strokes
(see Chapter 5):
• Alternating Hands 
• Hand stroking
• Finger stroking
6. Massage the neck and shoulders using Long Strokes
(see Chapter 7).
7. Massage the face using the following techniques
(see Chapter 6):
• Small Circles
• Tapping the Jaw Line
The Little Sleeper
Here is a pre-nap massage sequence for your little one who is just
beginning to receive massages and may be easily stimulated.
Use this sequence on the front side of the body only. All these tech-
niques are shown in Chapter 5.
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
164

1. Massage the legs using the following techniques:
• The Taffy Pull
• Ankles Away
2. Massage the feet using This Little Piggy.
3. Massage the arms using the following strokes:
• Alternating Hands
• Finger stroking
The abdomen and chest are high stimulation areas. We have pur-
posefully left these parts of the body out of the above massage
sequences.
Giving a great massage after a nap
After a nap is a perfect time to use some techniques that stimulate
your baby. In this section we show some sequences to try.
One difference between a massage that’s stimulating and one that
isn’t is the use of petrissage strokes — kneading strokes that are used
on loose, heavy musculature tissue. You can find out more about
petrissage strokes in the “Kneading Dough” section in Chapter 5.
Another key to creating a massage that’s stimulating is using some
of your strokes in an upward direction: moving them toward your
baby’s head.
Let’s Go!
This sequence creates an ideal massage for older babies who have
had a lot of massages and have a high tolerance for stimulation.
However, you always have to keep in mind that not all babies are
the same: Your baby may love all the techniques, become bored
halfway through, or even become too stimulated. Keep an eye out
for signs that your baby has had enough.
In this list of techniques, we have indicated that some are good to
use in both upward and downward strokes.
1. Massage the front of the legs using the following tech-
niques (see Chapter 5):
• The Taffy Pull
• Either Kneading Dough (using downward and upward
strokes) or Thumb Circles (using downward and
upward strokes)
2. Massage the feet using This Little Piggy (see Chapter 5).

(see Chapter 5):
• Thumbs to Sides
• Sun and Moon stroke
5. Massage the chest and shoulders using the Butterfly
Stroke (see Chapter 5).
6. Massage the arms and hands using the following tech-
niques (see Chapter 5):
• The “C” Stroke
• Hand stroking
7. Massage the back side of the legs using Kneading Dough
or Thumb Circles using upward and downward strokes
(see Chapter 7).
8. Massage the buttocks using the following techniques
(see Chapter 7):
• Alternating Thumbs
• Finger stroking
9. Massage the back using the following techniques
(see Chapter 7):
• The Long Effleurage Stroke

• Swooping (moving upward and downward)
Let’s Go Jr.
If the previous sequence seems like too much for your little one,
here is a sequence that is just stimulating enough for most babies.
To reduce the stimulation level further, work only the front or back
side of the body at one time. You can even split the massage
between naps. For example, after your baby wakes from her morn-
ing nap, massage the front side of her body. Save the back side for
when she wakes from her afternoon nap.
1. Massage the front of the legs and feet using the following
techniques (see Chapter 5):
• The Taffy Pull (using upward and downward strokes)
• Thumb Circles (using downward strokes only)
• This Little Piggy
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
166

2. Massage the belly using The Water Wheel (see Chapter 5).
3. Massage the chest and shoulders using the Open Book
Stroke (see Chapter 5).
4. Massage the arms and hands using the following tech-
niques (see Chapter 5):
• Alternating Hands
• Finger stroking
5. Massage the back of the legs using Thumb Circles in
downward strokes only (see Chapter 7).
6. Massage the buttocks using Alternating Thumbs
(see Chapter 7).
7. Massage the back using the following techniques
(see Chapter 7):
• The Sacral Stroke
• Swooping
• Raking
If you have very little time but want to give your baby a quickie mas-
sage, just use the Raking technique in both downward and upward
movements. You can even do this with your baby’s clothes on.

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
Most new parents are keenly aware that SIDS is an as-yet unexplained cause of
death in babies 12 months and under. Here’s how you can reduce the risk of losing
your baby to SIDS:
 Always place your baby on his or her back to sleep.
 Breastfeed. (Frequent feedings increase the amount of contact during the night
between you and your baby, reducing the risk of SIDS.)
 Avoid keeping toys and stuffed animals in the crib.
 Don’t let anyone smoke around your baby.
 Don’t use fluffy comforters or blankets in your baby’s crib.
 Consider co-sleeping with your baby (see Chapter 3).
 Make sure that your baby doesn’t get overheated during sleep.
You can find more information on SIDS at the National SIDS/Infant Death Resource
Center’s Web site (www.sidscenter.org).

Waking your baby gently 
with massage
“Never wake a sleeping baby” is usually good advice. However, at
times you’re going to have to wake your baby to take him to the
sitter or to a “Mommy (or Daddy) and Me” class. What better way
to wake your little one than with a massage?
Babies sleep the safest on their backs (see the sidebar on “Sudden
infant death syndrome [SIDS]”). We’re assuming that your baby is
on his back as you begin this massage.
Here are the steps to take to gently wake your baby:
1. While he is sleeping, greet your little one with sweet and
soothing words while you gently place your hands on his
chest and hold them there for a moment or two.
2. Slowly and gently, use the Raking technique described in
Chapter 5 down the length of your baby’s entire body.
Repeat this technique three to five times.
3. Make sure that you have a loving smile on your face and
gaze softly into your baby’s eyes when he begins to wake
up and see you.
If your baby tends to cry when he wakes up, stop here and
pick him up. (Chances are that he will stop crying when he
wakes if this massage is what he has to look forward to!)
4. If your baby likes to have his face touched, use the Small
Circles and Circling the Eyes techniques shown in
Chapter 6.
5. Use the Open Book Stroke shown in Chapter 6 on your
baby’s forehead.
6. Finish with a hug!
Taking Baby in the Bath with You
Bathing with your baby is a convenient way for you to mix play,
skin-on-skin contact, warmth, and massage all at once. In this sec-
tion, we show you how to do so in ways that are safe and enjoyable
for both of you.
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
168

Playing it safe
Here are some tips to help you make bathing with your baby safe:
 Always check the water temperature before you bring your
baby into the tub.
 Plan ahead for the bath and have everything you need nearby:
shampoo, washcloth, car/infant seat (to place your baby in
while you get in and out of the tub), towels (one for you, too!),
soap, and tub toys.
If you plan to give your baby an after-bath massage (which we
discuss in upcoming sections), place a diaper and change of
clothes near where you will be giving the massage, such as
near the changing table.
 If you’re bathing with a newborn, have your partner or a
helper nearby.
 Check the perimeter ledge of the tub beforehand and make
sure that everything your little one can reach with her hands
is safe. (Move those razors!)
 Keep in mind how slippery your little one will be when she’s
soaped up!
Bathing with a newborn
A baby’s first bath can be very stressful: Your baby may be terri-
fied of being placed in a small tub of water, and you may feel like a
bad parent for making him cry. You may be able to skip the stress
by taking your baby in the bath with you. Most newborns love this
experience; the combination of feeling the warm water and hearing
your heartbeat and voice makes your baby feel as if he is back in
the womb.
Be sure you wait until your baby’s umbilical cord falls off before
giving him a full bath. If you are unsure about this, ask your family
doctor or pediatrician. And keep in mind that newborns need to be
bathed only once or twice a week.
The first couple of times you bring your newborn in the bath with
you can be a little nerve-racking because of the combination of your
baby’s slippery, soapy skin and lack of head control. But with prac-
tice, you can make the experience comfortable and fun. (Your co-
author Joanne can attest: She’s been taking her daughter in the bath
Chapter 10: Fitting Massage into Nap, Bath, and Diaper Time 169

with her since she was just a couple of weeks old.) Here are some
tips to make it a safe and pleasurable experience for both of you:
 For your first couple of baths, have someone with you who
can help you bring your baby in and out of the tub and soap
him up.
 Fill the tub approximately two-thirds full before you get in,
and check that the temperature is warm but not too hot.
Be sure to watch the water level when your baby is placed on
your chest. If it’s too close to his mouth and nose, let some
water out.
 Keep an infant or car seat near the tub, and place your baby’s
towel inside the seat. Before you get in the bath, put your
baby in the seat.
 Get in the tub first by yourself. If you’re taking your first bath
since giving birth, go ahead and take a few minutes by your-
self before bringing your baby in with you. You will really
appreciate the break!
 Have your partner (or helper) slowly and gently place your
baby chest-down on top of your chest.
Your baby responds to your emotions. If you are calm and
relaxed, your baby will be, too.
 Gently hold your baby and feel him relax and melt into your
skin.
 Have your partner or helper soap up a soft baby’s washcloth
and gently wash your baby. Keep a squirt bottle nearby to
help rinse your baby off.
In the early days, it may be difficult to wash the front side of
your baby’s body. You can wash his belly on the changing
table with a sponge bath if necessary.
 Spend a few minutes just holding your little one and rubbing
his back.
 When it’s time to get out of the bath, have your helper or part-
ner take the baby out first and immediately place him in the
car seat. Wrap the towel around him (like a cocoon) to keep
him warm.
Some people recommend breastfeeding during the bath. It is a very
pleasurable experience for your baby to be nursed and surrounded
by warm water. However, most newborns’ elimination process
occurs immediately following a feeding, so nursing in the bathtub
may not be so pleasurable for you!
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life

Giving your newborn an 
after-bath massage
When you have finished bathing with your baby, you can take her
to a flat surface (still wrapped in the towel) and give her a gentle
massage. Use the towel to keep the parts of her body that are not
being massaged covered.
Because you are massaging a newborn, use downward strokes on
the front side of the body only and keep the length of your massage
short. Also, speak softly and sweetly to your baby throughout the
massage, and be sure to make a lot of eye contact.
Here are the steps involved in a great after-bath massage:
1. Uncover one leg at a time from the towel, and use
The Taffy Pull and This Little Piggy strokes shown in
Chapter 5.
2. Take one arm out from under the towel at a time, and use
the Alternating Hands technique we show in Chapter 5.
You’re finished! This short massage is enough stimulation for most
newborns.
Keep a clean diaper and fresh clothes nearby so when you are 
finished with the massage you can quickly diaper and outfit
your baby.
Bathing with your older baby
When your baby begins to gain some head control, you can bring
eye contact and play into your bath. By bending your knees and
placing your baby with her back against your thighs, you and she
are in a good position to give and receive smiles, laughter, and
love. You can also wash her belly!
Here are some tips to make bathing with your older baby fun
and safe:
 Place a car/infant seat (with your baby’s towel inside) next to
the tub.
 Put your baby in the car/infant seat, and after you are in the
tub, reach over the side and pick her up. You will be able to
put her back in the car/infant seat the same way after you’ve
finished bathing.
Chapter 10: Fitting Massage into Nap, Bath, and Diaper Time 171

 Have some brightly colored floating toys in the tub for her to
play with. Encourage splashing!
 If your baby is 6 months or older, place him or her in a seated
position on your extended legs, facing out. This will make
your baby feel like a big boy or girl!
 Finish the bath chest-to-chest with your baby. Let her feel her
legs and arms floating, and watch her relax.
Giving your older baby an 
after-bath massage
The type of massage you give your older baby after his bath will
depend on his experience with massage and whether you would
like to stimulate him or put him to sleep. See the sections “Giving a
great massage before a nap” and “Giving a great massage after a
nap” earlier in this chapter for ideas. Be sure to use your baby’s
towel to keep him warm during the massage.
We encourage you to follow your baby’s cues and your instincts.
With an older baby, you can begin to experiment with different
techniques and see how he responds.
Try only two or three new strokes at any time with your baby. By
doing so, you’ll have an easier time getting a feel for which ones
your baby likes and dislikes.
Bringing Massage to the
Changing Table
Let’s face it: There is going to be a lot of diaper changing in your
future — newborns typically urinate every hour and can have
bowel movements five to ten times a day. You may as well make
diaper changing a fun experience for you and your baby! In this
section, we show you how.
Changing your newborn
For newborns, a diaper change is a stressful thing. Everything is
brand new to them, and they don’t understand why every hour or
so they are undressed, moved around, wiped, and dressed again.
You can help make diaper changing a better experience for your
newborn by practicing these tips:
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
172

 Make sure you have everything you need nearby: diapers,
wipes, diaper rash cream, and a clean outfit in case of a leak.
 Move slowly and gently and use a calm, soothing voice.
If you are anxious about changing a newborn and are experienc-
ing stress, your newborn will feel it and become stressed, too.
 Use a baby wipe warmer: Your newborn will show her appreci-
ation by crying less.
 Keep some stuffed animals and musical toys nearby so you
can play with your newborn during or after the diaper change.
 Sing nursery rhymes.
 Incorporate massage into the process, as your baby tolerates.
Bringing massage to the changing table with a newborn is easy. We
make it even easier for you by listing here the techniques from
Chapter 5 that are appropriate for a newborn.
Use only one or two techniques at a time — using downward strokes
only — for your newborn. You can add more as her tolerance for
stimulation is increased. Here are the strokes to try:
 The Taffy Pull
 Ankles Away
 This Little Piggy
 Raking
 Alternating Hands
 The “C” Stroke
 Thumb Circles
 Hands on Hands
 Finger stroking 
It’s a good idea to try these strokes out on your baby first with his
clothes on, so wait to begin the massage until after you have finished
changing his diaper (and outfit, if necessary). With the exception
of This Little Piggy, any of the above strokes can be done on your
newborn with his clothes on.
You can also try to include massaging your baby’s face while on
the changing table. He may not like this at all at first, so be patient;
you can always use these strokes later on. Here are some strokes
from Chapter 6 to try:
Chapter 10: Fitting Massage into Nap, Bath, and Diaper Time 173

 Small Circles
 The Open Book Stroke (first variation)
 The Temple Stroke
Changing your older baby
By now you and your baby have shared many diaper changes
together. To continue making diaper changes a good time for con-
tact and bonding, plus to relieve boredom, here are some tips:
 Babies love to practice their new skills. When your baby is
able to sit up, let her do so on the changing table while you
keep her stable with one hand. Use this opportunity to mas-
sage her back while you acknowledge what a big girl she is.
 Warm up your baby’s legs for standing with the following
strokes (see Chapters 5 and 7):
• The Taffy Pull
• Kneading Dough
• Squeeze and Twist
When you are finished with these strokes, lay her on her back
on the floor (so you avoid getting your baby used to standing
on the changing table), grab onto her wrists, and gently pull
her up to standing. Tell her what a big girl she is.
 Help your toddler learn names for his different body parts by
making it a game. Ask him: “Where is your arm?” When he
shows you, reward him with a stroke such as Alternating
Hands or the “C” Stroke (see Chapter 5).
Making Daily Massage Routine
If you’ve read this whole chapter, you should have some good
ideas on how to massage your baby daily. There are plenty of
opportunities for massage around naps, baths, and diaper changes.
In this section we show you how to use massage to create rituals
with your baby, plus we walk you through a five-minute massage
you can do anytime.
Creating rituals
Rituals help you to create tradition in your family, as well as to
establish consistency and routines for your children. Your baby
Part III: Making Massage Part of Your Baby’s Life 
174

will quickly become familiar with your routines and come to count
on rituals to help her feel secure, to know what’s coming next, and
to learn new things.
Keep two things in mind when creating rituals:
 Rituals are repetitive.
 Rituals are positive: They make your baby feel good.
By including massage in your routine, you are creating a ritual with
your baby that makes her feel good. Here are some ways you can
make massage a ritual in your family:
 Give your baby a massage after every bath.
 Whenever your baby achieves a developmental milestone, cel-
ebrate with enthusiasm and a massage.
 Make massage part of your nighttime sleep ritual.
 Make changing diapers fun for you and your baby by including
singing, games, and a massage.
Giving a five-minute massage
Whenever you have five free minutes and want to make it great
quality time for you and your baby, try this massage sequence.
You can position your baby on a bed, a changing table, or your lap.
1. Massage the front side of the legs using the following
techniques (see Chapter 5):
• The Taffy Pull
• Kneading Dough
2. Massage the belly using the Sun and Moon technique
(see Chapter 5).
3. Massage the chest using The Open Book Stroke
(see Chapter 5).
4. Massage the arms and hands using the following tech-
niques (see Chapter 5):
• Alternating Hands
• Hand stroking
• Finger stroking
5. Massage the back side of the legs using Kneading Dough
(see Chapter 7).
Chapter 10: Fitting Massage into Nap, Bath, and Diaper Time 175

6. Massage the buttocks using the Large Bottom Stroke
(see Chapter 7).
7. Massage the back using Swooping (see Chapter 7).
8. Massage the face using the Open Book Stroke (first varia-
tion; see Chapter 6).
Identifying More Good Times
and Places for Massage
There are so many times and places to massage your baby that we
thought we would give you just a few more ideas. Let these spark
your own creativity:
 Take your baby to the park for a picnic, spread out a blanket,
and begin your massage.
 Massage your baby while waiting in the doctor’s office. You
can do this by laying your baby sideways on your lap (see
Figure 7-1 in Chapter 7).
 Massage your baby on an airplane. For an older baby, let him
sit on your lap, facing out. With one hand, you can massage
his back.
 Place your baby on your lap sideways and massage her back
while you are talking on the phone.
 If your baby begins to fuss in a restaurant, take him out of the
highchair, place him on your lap, and massage his back.
 If you are waiting in a long line in a supermarket, keep your
baby seated and buckled safely in the cart, and use Hands on
Hands and Finger stroking (see Chapter 5) to keep her busy.
 When you wear your baby in a sling, use one hand to do the
Circling the Eyes stroke (see Chapter 6) and the Open Book
Stroke (see Chapter 5).
 If you are traveling a long distance in a car, sit in the back with
your baby and massage his legs, arms, and face while he stays
safely in the car seat.

assage can be used to treat common illnesses and
health problems in your baby. In this part, we show
you how to use massage to treat conditions like colic,
asthma, and congestion. We also explain why attachment
is crucial and how you can use massage and touch to help
you bond with an adopted or foster baby. Babies with
developmental delays have special needs for touch and
massage that we cover here as well. Finally, we show you
how to use massage and touch techniques to help babies
who are addicted to drugs, exposed to alcohol, or affected

Massage for Common
Ailments and Problems
In This Chapter
 Using abdominal strokes to relieve constipation
 Addressing colic and asthma with massage
 Soothing the pain of teething
 Clearing congestion
 Calming the fussy baby
 Treating dry skin
A
t one time or another, most babies experience constipation,
congestion, dry skin, or fussiness. And all babies experience
teething, of course. Massage is an easy and effective way to help
your baby feel better as he deals with these common ailments and
developmental milestones.
In the case of colic or having a high need baby, we believe that
taking care of yourself is just as important to your family’s health
as taking care of your little one. For this reason, in this chapter we
also offer ideas on how you can find support and take steps to care
for yourself until you and your baby get past these stressful stages.
Always check with your pediatrician or family practice doctor if
you are using massage to treat a health issue, to be sure there
aren’t any contraindications.
Relieving Constipation
Constipation in infants and babies typically means having stools
that are hard, dry, infrequent, and sometimes painful. As we
explain in this section, babies who are exclusively breastfed don’t
tend to have this problem; babies who become constipated are
usually formula-fed, just beginning to eat solids, or both.

Bypassing the problem 
with breastfeeding
Babies who are breastfed exclusively don’t usually become consti-
pated because breast milk is easily digested. Breastfed babies also
have some other advantages when it comes to digestion:
 Breastfed babies have bacteria in their intestines that break
down proteins and create softer stool.
 Breastfed babies also have higher levels of the hormone motilin
than formula-fed babies. Motilin helps keep the bowels moving.
Recognizing discomfort 
in formula-fed babies
Formula-fed babies have a higher risk of constipation than breast-
fed babies because formula is not as easily digested as breast milk.
Also, allergies to formula can cause constipation. Here are some
signs that your baby may be allergic to formula:
 Your baby continues to be fussy after a feeding.
 Her belly is distended, and she is gassy.
 She has a red rectum that diaper rash cream won’t clear up.
 She spits up frequently.
 Her bowel movements tend to be either very hard or watery.
Spitting up, fussiness, and gas may also be signs that your baby is
getting too much formula in one feeding.
Saving solids until baby is ready
Some babies are introduced to solids at an early age, before their
digestive systems are fully formed. Sometimes solids can create
dehydration as your baby’s digestive system becomes used to
digesting a particular food.
Most babies are ready to start solid foods sometime around the
age of 6 months, although each baby is slightly different. Talk with
your pediatrician about the right time and way to introduce solids
to your baby, and when you do, pay careful attention to any
changes in his stools. If he starts to experience constipation when
solids are introduced to his diet, he may not be ready for them yet.
Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
180

Counteracting constipation
Several massage techniques that we demonstrate in Chapter 5 are
effective in alleviating constipation:
 The Water Wheel
 Thumbs to Sides
 Sun and Moon
 I Love You
Try giving your baby a belly massage for constipation after she
takes a warm bath.
Always use strokes in a clockwise direction on the abdomen. And
be sure to use a little pressure to avoid the tickle response!
In addition to using these massage techniques, you can incorpo-
rate the following tips to keep your baby’s bowels moving:
 Place your baby on his belly on your knee. The pressure from
this position will help move the gas or stool out of his intes-
tinal tract.
 Place your baby lying face down with his belly on your fore-
arm and his head near your elbow. Put pressure on his belly
with your arm and hand (visualize how a football player cra-
dles his football). Rub his sacrum with your other hand. (If you
are unsure where the sacrum is, take a look at Figure 7-12 in
Chapter 7.)
 Place your baby on your chest or over your shoulder and
massage his sacrum and lower back.
 While your baby is on his back, imagine a clock on his belly.
Use your fingertips to make tiny clockwise circles that being
at 7:00 and work around to 5:00.
The above techniques can all be done while your baby’s clothes
are on.
Recognizing and Responding 
to Colic
Approximately 25 percent of babies experience colic — a condition
that causes babies to cry inconsolably for at least three hours a
Chapter 11: Massage for Common Ailments and Problems 181

day at least three days a week. Keep in mind that this is the mini-
mum amount of crying for a diagnosis; some babies cry for hours
on end with no apparent reason — they simply will not stop.
If your baby has colic, he may cry, scream, and kick for hours. He
may arch his back and tighten his stomach. He seems like he is in a
lot of pain, and you can’t find the cause of it. Needless to say, colic
is stressful for the whole family.
The best news we can offer is that most cases of colic disappear
somewhere around 3 to 4 months of age. Hang in there!
Looking for causes of colic
The truth is that no one really knows what causes colic. Following
are some common theories:
 An immature digestive system
 Emotional stress
 An immature nervous system
 Food allergies — for example, if a breastfeeding mother is
drinking cow’s milk and eating dairy products, or if an infant
is drinking formula (either milk- or soy-based)
 Your baby’s temperament
 Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — a condition that
affects babies and adults alike and is commonly called reflux
We believe that colic is probably caused by a combination of these
factors.
Massaging to ease colic
Regular abdominal massage may lower the frequency and severity
of your baby’s colic episodes. You can use any of the belly mas-
sages we show in Chapter 5 (which are listed in the “Counteracting
constipation” section earlier in this chapter) to help prevent an
episode of colic. These techniques help you stimulate your baby’s
colon and push gas and stool through the intestinal tract.
Here are some additional massage, exercise, and holding tech-
niques you can use during a colic attack:
Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
182

 Hold your baby in the football hold. Place your baby lying
face down with his belly on your forearm and his head near
your elbow. Put pressure on his belly with your arm and hand
(visualize how a football player cradles his football). Rub his
sacrum with your other hand.
 Place your baby on his back, and bring both knees to his chest
by bending his legs. Your hands are on the outside of your
baby’s knees. Hold his knees on his chest for a few seconds.
You can also do this technique one leg at a time.
 Follow the instructions in the previous bullet and, with both
legs together, circle your baby’s knees clockwise (in the direc-
tion of the colon).
Offering your baby additional relief
Here are some other ways that you can try to comfort your baby
during an episode of colic:
 Wear your baby in a sling (see Chapter 1).
 Run the vacuum.
 Swaddle your baby (see Chapter 3).
 Take your baby for a ride in the car.
 Use an infant swing or an Amby Baby Motion Bed (see
www.AmbyBaby.com).
 Take a warm bath with your baby (see Chapter 10).
 Try feeding your baby more slowly (and possibly less) during
each feeding.
Try to alternate comfort measures. For example, you may wear
your baby in a sling for a while, then take a warm bath together,
and then go for a ride in the car.
We know how stressful colic can be, but we do not recommend let-
ting your baby cry it out. If you have tried everything you can
think of to calm him and your baby is still crying, simply hold him
and speak soothingly throughout the episode. If your frustration
level has peaked, ask your partner, your friends, and your family
for help. Being held while crying is a much different and better
experience for a baby than being left alone in a crib.
What’s the risk of letting your baby cry it out? Your baby will not
learn important self-soothing skills, and unfortunately he may
learn that his needs will not be met and his environment is not
safe. He may also learn to shut down his feelings.
Chapter 11: Massage for Common Ailments and Problems 183

No matter how frustrated you may get, do not ever shake your
baby. A baby can die or suffer permanent brain damage after being
shaken. If you are overwhelmed and start to feel yourself getting
angry at your baby, place him in a safe place (such as his crib or
playpen) and go into another room to give yourself time to calm
down. Practicing the breathing techniques we show you in
Chapters 2 and 4 can help as well.
Easing your own stress
Colic is most definitely a family affair. For this reason, we want to
offer some suggestions on how to cope so the stress doesn’t over-
whelm you:
 Take a break. Find a way to spend at least an hour away from
your baby each day.
 Get support. Locate other parents of colicky babies — perhaps
through La Leche League meetings, Mommy and Me classes,
or other local groups that bring new parents together. If you
don’t know where to look for this type of organization, contact
the hospital where you delivered your baby and ask for help
finding a support group.
 If you’re not able to find a support group that meets your
needs, at least find one person you can share your feelings of
frustration with.
 Let someone give you a massage!
 Remind yourself not to take your baby’s crying personally —
it is absolutely not a reflection of your parenting abilities.
Breathing Easy: Coping 
with Asthma
Asthma is a chronic condition where airways become inflamed and
filled with mucus that causes wheezing and difficulty breathing. If
your baby has an asthma attack, she coughs and her lungs spasm
to remove the mucus.
The most common type of asthma is caused by allergies. When
exposed to an allergen (like mold or pollen), the body creates an
antibody that releases a chemical substance called a mediator.
Mediators cause the airways to become inflamed, which results in
asthma symptoms.
Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
184

Reducing asthma triggers
You may not be able to prevent your baby from getting asthma,
but you can help her by removing some of things in your home
environment that may trigger it. Here are some things you can do:
 Never smoke near your baby.
 Limit her exposure to dust.
 If you are a breastfeeding mother, avoid eating foods that
many people are allergic to, such as eggs, nuts, and shellfish.
 Do not use a wood stove or fireplace.
 Monitor your baby’s stress level. Stress can create anxiety
symptoms like shortness of breath, which can trigger an
asthma attack or make a current attack feel worse. 
It typically takes six months of exposure to a potential allergen for
an allergy to show up. That’s why babies 6 months and older may
begin to show allergies to pets or particular foods. Children don’t
get seasonal allergies until around the age of 4 or 5.
Seeing signs of asthma
Diagnosing asthma in very young babies can be difficult, so many
infants’ asthma goes undiagnosed. Following are some symptoms
that your baby may display if he has asthma:
 Frequent chest colds
 A rattly cough
 Difficulty feeding
 Rapid breathing
 A whistling or wheezing noise when exhaling
 Shortness of breath
If you are at all concerned that your baby may have asthma, con-
tact your pediatrician and describe exactly the types of symptoms
your baby is experiencing. It’s crucial to have asthma diagnosed as
soon as possible.
Chapter 11: Massage for Common Ailments and Problems 185

Recognizing asthma attacks
Asthma attacks are frightening for both parents and babies. When
your baby is having difficulty breathing, neither of you feels like
you have any control over the situation.
Typically, doctors classify asthma attacks in three categories:
 Mild: Your baby’s breathing is affected; she has some wheez-
ing, coughing, and shortness of breath. She is alert, and her
skin color is normal.
 Moderate: Your baby’s skin becomes pale, and she experi-
ences more wheezing, whistling, and shortness of breath than
in a mild asthma attack. She is still alert.
 Severe: Breathing is extremely difficult. Wheezing and cough-
ing are severe, and your baby is no longer alert — she may be
very drowsy. Her skin color may be blue or extremely pale.
Talk with your pediatrician about the steps you should take during
an asthma attack; she will help you create an action plan.
Massaging for asthma
To help alleviate the symptoms of asthma, you want to focus on
massaging your baby’s upper chest. The chest-opening techniques
that we show you in Chapter 5 are appropriate to use during mild
asthma attacks and are good preventative care to prevent attacks
from occurring:
 The Heart Stroke
 The Open Book Stroke
 The Butterfly Stroke
If your baby is having a moderate or severe asthma attack, we 
recommend calling your healthcare provider. Giving your baby a
relaxing massage after the asthma attack can help reduce the
effects of the stressful attack.
Ouch! Helping Teething Pain
Sharp tiny teeth poking through your baby’s gums can cause a lot
of pain. Some babies seem to suffer tremendously during teething,
while others experience only mild discomfort. In either case, know-
ing how to respond to your baby’s pain begins with identifying
whether your baby is truly teething or not.
Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
186

Anticipating their arrival
Your baby actually starts teething while still in the womb; that’s
when tooth buds (all 20 of them) begin to form under the gum.
But a baby’s teeth usually don’t cut through the gum until at least
several months after birth.
You can expect to see signs of teething and your baby’s first teeth
erupt around 6 months of age. But keep in mind that 6 months is
just an approximation; some babies cut their first tooth at 3 months
(or even earlier)!
Typically, the first teeth you see are the upper and lower incisors,
followed by the first molars, the canine teeth, and then your baby’s
2-year molars.
Your child’s permanent teeth won’t be ready to come in until some-
where around the age of 6.
Recognizing signs of teething
Many signs can point to the fact that your baby is teething. Here
are some of them:
 She drools a lot — so much that she may need to wear a bib.
The excessive drooling may cause diarrhea or loose stools.
 She is very fussy.
 She wants to chew on her toys (and anything else she can get
her hands and mouth on).
 She pulls on her ears.
 She may have a slight fever.
 She has a dry cough.
 She may suddenly cry out in pain.
 She may wake up at night more frequently than normal.
 She may start biting.
If you suspect that teeth are on their way, use the finger test: Make
sure your finger is very clean, and rub it along your baby’s gums. If
a tooth is twisting its way through, you will feel it!
Chapter 11: Massage for Common Ailments and Problems 187

Massaging to ease the pain
Keep in mind that your baby’s gums, mouth, and facial muscles
may be very sensitive during teething. Try one or two of the follow-
ing techniques and note your baby’s response and sensitivity level.
If he responds well, continue. If not, try one of the other suggestions
we offer later in this section.
Massage techniques that focus on your baby’s face, forehead, and
neck are appropriate when focusing on teething pain; each of these
areas is prone to the effects of teething stress. Try any of the fol-
lowing techniques, which we show you in Chapter 6:
 Ears to Chin
 Small Circles
 Tapping the Jaw Line
 The Smile Stroke
 Circling the Eyes 
 The Open Book Stroke
 Big Circles
 The Temple Stroke
 The Ear Stroke
 Chinny Chin Chin
 Scooping

Breastfeeding and teething
Some breastfeeding moms think they need to stop nursing when their babies begin
teething. The truth is that you can continue to nurse even if your baby has a full set
of teeth! If your baby is latched onto your breast correctly, he cannot bite while he’s
nursing because his tongue covers his gums between his lower teeth and your
breast.
It is those brief moments just before and just after nursing that you need to look out
for. If your baby does bite you, your startle reaction may be enough to stop him from
doing it again. But be sure not to pull your baby away quickly — you may really hurt
yourself if he latches on. Instead, pull your baby close to you, which prevents him
from breathing through his nose momentarily and forces him to de-latch himself.
You can also de-latch him by inserting your pinky finger into your baby’s mouth to
release the suction.

Here are some other ways you can help your baby through
teething by using touch:
 Let your baby gnaw and chomp away on your clean finger. 
 Use a clean finger to push down gently on your baby’s gums
to help relieve some of the pressure.
 Hold and cuddle with your baby a lot.
 Wear him in a sling.
 Consider co-sleeping (see Chapter 3) because you are better
able to comfort your baby during the night.
Offering additional relief
Together with massage and touch, you can also use some of the
tried-and-true methods of helping teething pain:
 Give your baby a cold object to chew and suck on (such as a
washcloth, teething ring, or spoon).
 Use a homeopathic remedy like Hyland’s teething tablets or
gel. Hyland’s teething remedies are 100 percent natural and
safe to use (see www.earthbaby.com/hylands).
Illness is a sign that something is wrong and your body is trying
to heal itself. Homeopathic remedies stimulate your body to heal
itself. 
Alleviating Chest and 
Sinus Congestion
While babies’ immune systems are developing, they are especially
vulnerable to catching colds. Common symptoms of colds include
chest and sinus congestion. The goal in using massage to help con-
gestion is to move the mucus out of the chest or sinus area, which
enables your baby to feel and breathe better.
Knowing the difference: 
Cold versus flu
When your baby isn’t feeling well, you may struggle to figure out
whether she has a cold or the flu. We strongly recommend that you
Chapter 11: Massage for Common Ailments and Problems 189

have your healthcare provider make a definitive diagnosis, but we
also think it is important to understand the differences between
the two because they have symptoms in common.
Colds
A cold is caused by one of more than 200 viruses (not bacteria).
Most of the symptoms of a cold are above the neck. The most
common symptoms are nasal stuffiness, a runny nose, and sneezing.
Young babies and toddlers may carry a low-grade fever. Antibiotics
are not used in treating colds; they may actually make the cold
worse by killing helpful bacteria in the body.
Flu
The flu is caused by a single virus: the influenza. The symptoms of
flu are all over the body, such as fever, body aches, lack of energy,
and dizziness. In most cases, after a few days the body symptoms
disappear, and the flu settles in the respiratory system with a hack-
ing cough. Symptoms that resemble a cold usually emerge after the
respiratory system becomes affected.
Massaging to ease chest congestion
To help alleviate chest congestion, keep your massage strokes
moving toward your baby’s head to push out any mucus that may
be in the lungs.
You can use any of the chest-opening techniques that we show in
Chapter 5:
 The Heart Stroke
 The Open Book Stroke
 The Butterfly Stroke
You can also use strokes on your baby’s back, such as this one:
1. Beginning from your baby’s sacrum, using a Raking
stroke (see Chapter 7) up toward your baby’s head. Your
baby may either be lying down or sitting up and facing
away from you.
2. Add a tapping motion by using two fingers from one or
both hands and tapping up your baby’s back.
Your baby may begin to cough during these strokes.
Coughing may be an indication that the massage is loosen-
ing up the mucus.
Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
190

3. Place your baby on his back and open his arms up and
out over his head to further open his chest and aid in
breathing.
Massaging to ease sinus congestion
All the techniques in Chapter 6, which focuses on the face and
neck, are useful in helping to drain the sinuses. You can also use
the Sinus Relief Stroke:
1. Have your baby lying on his back or sitting up
facing you.
2. Place two fingers from each hand on either side of the
bridge of your baby’s nose.
3. Sweep your fingers down and out under your baby’s
cheek bones, to pull out and down any mucus in the
sinus.
Have tissues or a rubber bulb syringe handy when using this 
technique.
To further help your baby’s breathing, use a drop or two of 
eucalyptus or peppermint essential oil in a vaporizer or your
baby’s bath.
Minimizing your baby’s risk
You won’t be able to prevent your baby from catching colds, but
you can minimize her vulnerability to getting sick by practicing the
following tips:
 Breastfeed your baby. Breastfed babies are sick less often
than formula-fed babies because breast milk contains
immune-building antibodies.
To ensure that your baby receives all the benefits of breast-
feeding, the World Health Organization recommends breast-
feeding for at least two years, and the American Academy of
Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding for one year.
 If you have a newborn, make sure that you (and your friends
and relatives) wash your hands often.
 Don’t smoke around your baby.
 Keep your baby well hydrated.
Chapter 11: Massage for Common Ailments and Problems 191

Helping Your Fussy Baby
All babies are fussy from time to time, but some babies seem to be
fussy more often than others. These babies don’t have colic, and
they also don’t have any medical concerns. They’re just. . .fussy!
Identifying fussy factors
Here are just some of the culprits that can make your baby fussy:
 Overstimulation
 Understimulation
 Hunger
 Tiredness
 Loneliness
 Being too hot
 Being too cold
 Diaper rash
 Food allergies
 Thrush
 Wet/soiled diaper
 Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
We could go on and on with this list, but we’re sure you get the
point: Your baby could be fussing over a lot of different things.
One important reason your baby may fuss is that she may not be
getting her needs met. If you have a baby who needs to be held a
lot, and she is kept in a mechanical swing or car seat for most of
the day, you are going to have a fussy and unhappy baby.
Keep in mind that your baby is fussing in order to tell you some-
thing. You may not understand what she is telling you, so she gets
more frustrated as she is trying to get her needs met and whatever
you offer her is not what she is asking for.
Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
192

Offering comfort through 
touch and massage
Fussy behavior can often be progressive. If you respond to your
baby’s requests early, you may manage to avoid your baby becom-
ing upset. But if your baby has been telling you for a while that
she needs something, and you haven’t responded until the fussy
behavior intensifies, you will have an upset baby to calm down.
Keep a log of your baby’s fussy times. If you find that she fusses
during a particular time of the day, plan ahead to give her a relax-
ing massage during that time. Relaxing her ahead of time may make
her forget to be fussy.
Chances are that if you have been massaging your baby on a fairly
regular basis, you are attuned to her needs and will respond to her
requests promptly (before they become high pitched demands!).
However, all babies (and adults, for that matter) do have fussy
moments from time to time. Here we list ways to use touch and
massage to calm and soothe your fussy baby:
 Wear your baby in a sling (see Chapter 1).
 Nurse in motion — nurse your baby while she is in a sling and
you are on the go.
 Nurse frequently.
 Sing to your baby while you rock and gently dance with her.
 Carry your baby in the football hold (which we describe in the
section “Massaging to ease colic” earlier in the chapter).
 Hold your baby over your shoulder and, with your free hand,
make Raking strokes down his back (see Chapter 7).
 Place your baby sitting up on your lap, facing out. Push her
forward a little (while your support her with one hand), and
with your free hand make small circles down her back in a
clockwise motion.
 Take a warm bath with your baby, followed by one of the
after-bath massages we describe in Chapter 10.
Alternate ways to soothe your baby, just as you would if your baby
had colic.
Avoid massaging your baby’s face during a fussy episode. Face
and head massages can overstimulate babies and may make them
fussier.
Chapter 11: Massage for Common Ailments and Problems 193

Dealing with high need babies
High need babies are wired differently than other babies; they
seem to be worried, intense, and easily overstimulated from birth.
If you have a high need baby, in this section we show you ways to
love your baby and take care of yourself.
Recognizing high need characteristics
Some parents think they have a baby with high needs until they
meet other parents who really do! Here are some common charac-
teristics that set high need babies apart from other babies:
 They are intense.
 They have high energy levels.
 They nurse frequently, sometimes several times an hour.
 They need to be held and comforted a lot.
 They are highly sensitive.
 They awaken frequently.
 They are demanding.
 They refuse to be left alone in a car seat, swing, or bouncer.
Loving a high need baby
If you have figured out that yours truly is a high need baby, you
need a change of perspective: Try to consider yourself blessed to
have such a special baby! The situation doesn’t have to be nega-
tive. These babies are definitely challenging, but they are easy to
love if you let go of expectations you may have about how your
baby “should” be. Your relationship with your high need baby can
bring out the best in both of you.
Here are some ways you can love your high need baby:
 Listen to him. High need babies don’t give up until their
needs are met. So if your baby doesn’t stop crying unless you
are holding him all the time, invest in a sling and carry him
around with you.
 Share sleep with your baby. Co-sleeping (see Chapter 3)
makes it easier for you to keep up with all the extra feedings
and night wakening, while making it possible for you to get
the sleep you need.
 Bathe with your baby. See Chapter 10 for tips on doing so
safely.
Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
194

 Massage your baby! High need babies usually thrive on a lot
of touch, so use your massage skills frequently.
Following is a massage sequence — the High Contact Massage —
that your high need baby will be sure to love. Your baby is on his
back and able to see you throughout the entire sequence, which is
filled with gliding, gentle strokes to help soothe your little one.
Be sure to talk lovingly to your baby during this massage. He will
be delighted by all you are able to give him.
 The Dolphin Stroke (see Chapter 4)
 The Taffy Pull (see Chapter 5)
 Ankles Away (see Chapter 5)
 This Little Piggy (see Chapter 5)
 I Love You (see Chapter 5)
 The Heart Stroke (see Chapter 5)
 The Open Book Stroke on the chest (see Chapter 5)
 Alternating Hands (see Chapter 5)
 Hand stroking (see Chapter 5)
 Finger stroking (see Chapter 5)
 Circling the Eyes (see Chapter 6)
 The Open Book Stroke on the forehead (see Chapter 6)
Be sure to finish with lots of cuddling. Keep in mind that this
sequence contains a lot of techniques: Trust your instincts, and
skip any strokes that don’t feel right to you or your baby.
Comforting yourself
Much like having a baby with colic, having a high need baby can
take a toll on you and your family over time. Don’t forget to take
steps to lower your own stress level whenever you feel yourself
getting frustrated:
 Ask for help when you need it.
 Take care of your own physical and emotional needs.
 Find some alone time — time when you are not taking care of
anyone but yourself.
Chapter 11: Massage for Common Ailments and Problems 195

Healing Your Baby’s Skin
Babies are prone to dry skin because their oil-producing glands
aren’t fully developed yet. Frequent bathing, dry air, static electric-
ity, and harsh detergents can also contribute to dry skin.
If your baby has dry skin, you can use massage as an opportunity
to rehydrate your baby’s skin. Here’s how:
 Massage your baby after bathing. Be sure to keep your bath
time short; the hot water could be drying out your baby’s skin.
 Use only 100 percent natural oils (see Chapter 4), which will
not affect your baby’s sensitive skin.
 If your baby’s skin is very dry, consider massaging him with oil
twice a day. Even if you are short on time, you can do this by
incorporating massage on the changing table (see Chapter 10).
Following are a few additional ways to protect your baby’s skin:
 Use only gentle baby soaps and shampoos on your baby’s
skin. You may also want to switch to a mild laundry detergent.
 Run a humidifier during the winter months. The extra moisture
will not only help your baby’s skin but may also prevent her
from catching a cold.
 Nurse your baby frequently. If you are formula-feeding your
baby, you may need to give her a daily water bottle.
 If you are a breastfeeding mother, try increasing the Omega 3
fatty acids in your diet, which are found in salmon, flax seed
oil, canola oil, or supplements.
Treating eczema
Eczema is one of the most common forms of rashes that children
have. It is a form of dermatitis caused by a combination of genetic
and environmental factors. An overreactive immune system
responds to certain environmental or food allergies with very dry
skin and a rash.
Some symptoms of eczema are:
 Tiny white bumps that you can feel on the skin
 Dry white or red patches on the skin
 Frequent flare-ups when the dry skin patches and bumps may
become irritated and oozy
Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
196

If your baby has eczema, talk with your pediatrician about treat-
ment options. Here are some suggestions for caring for his skin:
 Bathe your baby in short, lukewarm (not hot) baths. Avoid
using soap unless you absolutely need to. During an eczema
flare-up, your baby may not be able to tolerate a bath at all.
In this situation, use a water-free cleanser.
 After a bath, pat your baby dry with a very soft towel —
100 percent cotton is best. Never rub excessively.
 Always follow a bath with a massage using a heavy (and
gentle) moisturizing cream or lotion, such as Kiehl’s Baby
Nurturing Cream for Face and Body (see www.kiehls.com)
or Little Forest Natural Products for Baby Skin Care (see www.
littleforest.com). Massage the cream into your baby’s
damp skin.
 Use a humidifier.
 Use only 100 percent cotton clothing and sheets for your
baby. Especially avoid wool.
 Breastfeed your baby if possible, and delay introducing solids
until he is at least 6 months old.
Caring for cradle cap
Cradle cap is a rash found on the scalps of many babies beginning
between birth and 3 months. The skin cells of newborns can grow
faster than they fall off, leaving a crusty layer.
Seborrhea is a skin condition that can show up behind the ears or on
the knees, underarms, eyelids, face, neck, or diaper area. When it
occurs on top of the head, it is called cradle cap. Forms of seborrhea
on teenagers and adults can include dandruff and dry flaking skin.
You can use a gentle scalp massage along with oil to treat cradle
cap. Here’s how:
1. Use a mild oil, such as vegetable or olive oil, for most
cases of cradle cap. Heavier oils may leave a residue that
could irritate the cradle cap.
2. Massage the oil onto your baby’s scalp using gentle but
vigorous strokes.
3. Leave the oil on your baby’s scalp for about 10 to 15 min-
utes. You can use this time to massage the rest of your
baby’s body. 
Chapter 11: Massage for Common Ailments and Problems 197

4. Use a soft toothbrush or baby’s hair brush to gently
loosen the skin.
5. Wash your baby’s hair with a mild baby shampoo.
Use this treatment on your baby a couple times each week until
the cradle cap disappears. Be sure to massage gently over your
baby’s soft spot.
Most cases of cradle cap disappear by the time the baby turns 1.

Chapter 12
Massage for Emotional and
Developmental Issues
In This Chapter
 Aiding attachment with massage
 Handling developmental delays
 Managing sibling relationships
I
f you’ve read some or all of the chapters that come before this,
you are already aware that infant massage has many benefits.
(If you haven’t read it, Chapter 2 offers a great introduction to this
topic.) In this chapter, we take you deeper into a discussion of the
benefits of massage — specifically the emotional benefits.
In this chapter, we discuss what attachment really means in a baby’s
world, how circumstances such as adoption and foster parenting
affect attachment, and how to strengthen your relationship with
your baby. We also show you that massage is an important tool in
a parenting style that emphasizes bonding and interdependence.
Finally, we explore how to use massage to help a developmentally
delayed baby in concrete ways.
Overcoming Attachment Issues
When you bond with your baby, you are creating a relationship
based on love and trust. That bond is tested throughout your
baby’s development, but if your attachment with your baby is
strong, the bond will only grow with time.
In Chapter 1, we talk about using an attachment parenting style.
Attachment is created by showing your baby affection, mirroring and
reflecting your baby’s emotions, touching him, helping him soothe

Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
200
himself during times of stress, and nurturing him. Attachment is a
process that both you and your baby participate in, and the qual-
ity of the attachment is determined by how sensitive you are and
how responsive your baby is.
We offer suggestions throughout this book for ways to use mas-
sage and other techniques to build attachment with your baby. But
in some circumstances, building attachment is especially challeng-
ing. For example, babies and older children who have been placed
for adoption or who are in foster care have unique needs. Because
they have already experienced profound loss and separation, cre-
ating a foundation of trust in order to develop an attachment can
be difficult.
In the sections that follow, we show you how to use massage and
touch to help create trust in order to form attachments even in
these challenging situations.
Recognizing patterns of attachment
Not surprisingly, research shows that parenting styles affect the
quality of attachment between parents and their children. Adopted
and foster children may come to their new parents with an existing
pattern of attachment — meaning that their ability to bond has
already been influenced by the parent(s) they knew before you.
We want you to be familiar with patterns of attachment so you can
not only recognize them but redirect them in healthy ways using
touch and massage.
The way that a baby or child attaches to a caregiver forms the
basis of her relationships throughout her adult life. We don’t say
this to create stress for you — only to emphasize how crucial it is
that you take every step possible to create a positive attachment
with your little one. (As you prepare to be the best parent or care-
giver possible, we strongly encourage you to reflect on your own
childhood and how it may influence your parenting style.)
Securely attached babies
Sensitive caregivers generally produce securely attached babies.
What does it mean to be a sensitive caregiver?
 Having the ability to see things from the baby’s perspective
 Responding to the baby’s needs promptly
 Being consistent and positive

 Tending to leave a contented baby alone during play, and
responding supportively when the baby needs help with diffi-
cult emotions, such as frustration or anger
Securely attached babies look to their caregivers for comfort.
When they’re upset, if their caregivers are nearby they are usually
easily calmed down.
Insecurely attached babies
Insensitive caregivers often create insecure attachments with their
babies. What are the characteristics of insensitive caregivers?
 They respond to their babies’ needs based on the caregivers’
feelings and needs.
 They are inconsistent.
 They reinforce positive behaviors and ignore negative ones.
In a misguided effort to teach children how to control their
behavior, insensitive parents teach their children rejection.
Insecurely attached babies may ignore, actively resist, or cling to
their caregivers.
Bonding with an adopted
or foster child
Even if you are a sensitive parent, your adopted or foster baby may
come to you with an insecure attachment pattern. Or perhaps after
reading the previous section you recognize that you exhibit some
characteristics of an insensitive caregiver. Either way, you can
work to improve your situation by recognizing these attachment
patterns and taking action to bond with your new addition in a
positive way.
Attachment is co-created: The combination of your child’s tempera-
ment and your sensitivity determines the quality of attachment.
Adopting a newborn or infant
So if you’ve adopted a newborn or infant, where do you begin the
bonding process? Cuddling, holding, massaging, touching, stroking,
kissing, and hugging are all wonderful ways to create an attachment.
The more often you touch your baby in a nurturing way, the sooner
you will build the trusting relationship you need to form a secure
attachment.
Chapter 12: Massage for Emotional and Developmental Issues 201

Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
202
Here are some suggestions:
 Wear your baby in a sling (see Chapter 1).
 Avoid separations if possible.
 Make a lot of eye contact.
 Co-sleep (see Chapter 3).
 Massage your baby every chance you get:
• Before and/or after baths
• On the changing table
• Before naps
• While she is in the sling
• During breaks from long drives in the car
 Nurse your baby often.
Does this seem like strange advice? Yes, it is possible for
some women to breastfeed an adopted baby. If you’re inter-
ested in finding out how, visit the La Leche League Web site
(www.lalecheleague.org) for more information, or see
Breastfeeding For Dummies by Sharon Perkins and Carol
Vannais (Wiley).
 Bathe with your baby (see Chapter 10).
 Give your baby a transferential object — a fancy name for a
blanket or stuffed animal that he can hold during times when
you can’t hold him.
Sleep with the transferential object before giving it to your
baby so the object picks up your smell.
Adopting an older baby or child
Older babies and children obviously bring more experiences and
history with them than babies do. Some of these experiences may
include trauma, abuse, and neglect. Children with this type of back-
ground need you to show them how to bond and attach. You can
respectfully and sensitively bring safe touch and massage to the
relationship.
Here are some suggestions to get you started:
 Avoid separations until you have a secure attachment with
your child.
 Go slowly. Don’t overwhelm your child with a lot of touch.
Respect her boundaries and her right to say no, but don’t
stop trying to touch your child.

 Include siblings and other family members in creating safe
and appropriate touch (see Chapter 9).
 Massage your older baby’s feet. The feet are often a safe and
noninvasive place to start massaging your child.
 Co-sleep if you can. If doing so creates too much closeness for
your child, read to her before sleep, and stay in bed with her
until she falls asleep. Or simply try watching television with
your older child while you are both lying in bed.
 Make a lot of eye contact.
 Respond to tantrums appropriately; don’t ignore the behavior
(see Chapter 9).
 Rock your child in a rocking chair.
 Comb or brush her hair.
 Go swimming together.
 Dance!
Adopting a child from another country
In the United States, international adoption has become very 
popular. In 2002, approximately 20,000 international children were
adopted by U.S. citizens.
International adoption allows you the opportunity to love and parent
a child who desperately needs a home and family. But when you
adopt a child from another country, attachment may bring special
challenges. Here are some obstacles you want to prepare for:
 You and your child may speak different languages.
 You may learn little or nothing about your child’s background
and medical history.
 If your child has been institutionalized prior to adoption, he
may be developmentally delayed.
 If you adopt an older baby or child, the transition into your
home will seem sudden. Cognitively, your child may not be
developed enough to understand why she is living in a new
home.
 Everything your child experiences after coming to live with
you will be new: He’ll need to adjust to a new country, culture,
language, food, and smells.
Chapter 12: Massage for Emotional and Developmental Issues 203

Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
204
Children who live in institutions in other countries are often used
to very rigid routines, little or no emotional and sensory contact,
and neglect. (In some Eastern European countries, orphanages
have only one caretaker per 50 infants.) Most of these babies live
in institutions because their parents are extremely poor; their fami-
lies literally cannot afford to feed them. Living in an orphanage for
even a short period of time may profoundly affect a baby’s or
child’s ability to attach.
Do not lose hope. Many children who have lived in institutions do
very well after being placed with a loving family. It takes time to
deinstitutionalize your child. He needs a lot of physical and emo-
tional contact with you to be able to reattach.
Here are some ways you can make your child’s transition easier:
 Have a cuddly transitional object (a blanket or stuffed animal)
ready for your child right away.
 Plan on sleeping in the same room as your child at first; he’s
probably used to sleeping with a roomful of other children.
 Realize that you are responsible for teaching your baby about
touch: when, where, and how.
 Find out about your baby’s cultural attitudes regarding touch
before you bring him home.
 Be careful not to overstimulate your new baby. 
 Avoid separations.
 Recognize that your baby may reject your touch at first due to
sensory defensiveness. Don’t take it personally or give up.
 Create and stick to a routine.
 Use play with objects that have different textures and shapes
to introduce touch and provide an opportunity for physical
closeness.
 Plan on you and your partner being your child’s only caretakers
at first.
Caring for a foster child
More than 500,000 children are in foster care in the United States,
and only about half will be returned to their families. Some babies
and children in foster care have been placed for adoption and are
waiting for a family. Others have been removed from their biologi-
cal families because they have been abused or neglected or their
parents have died.

When you become a foster parent, you must keep two critical
issues in mind:
 Unless you plan to adopt, the child’s placement with you is
temporary.
 The child may have an attachment related disorder when she
is placed with you.
Even though your foster child may be moving on to a permanent
home soon, it is important for you to use touch in your relation-
ship. You want to begin with safe, noninvasive touch, especially if
your foster child has experienced trauma or abuse. Even newborns
can be hypersensitive to touch and may find even a little contact
too much too soon.
Many of the suggestions we offer in the previous sections on bonding
with adopted babies also work with foster children. Keep in mind
that to create a trusting relationship you must respect the child’s
boundaries, but don’t give up if he rejects physical contact at first.
Children who have loving and sensitive foster parents are more
likely to flourish in permanent homes.
Dealing with Reactive Attachment
Disorder
Children diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) have
experienced extreme chaos, neglect, deprivation, and abuse in their
early lives. They may become violent, fearful, and hypervigilant.
Symptoms of RAD, which can be seen even in babies, include the
following:
 Constant crying or colic
 Failure to thrive
 Refusal to be comforted or held
 Little to no responsiveness; the baby does not even return
smiles
 A tendency to become enraged when held
 A preference for being left alone in a playpen rather than
being held
Chapter 12: Massage for Emotional and Developmental Issues 205

Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
206
Babies and children with RAD physiologically cannot calm them-
selves down. They are in a constant state of terror and react vio-
lently to their feelings.
If you suspect that your adopted or foster baby has RAD, you need
to seek professional help. Treating an attachment disorder typically
requires working with a team of professionals. You can find more
information about RAD and where to find appropriate treatment
at the Institute for Attachment & Child Development’s Web site:
www.instituteforattachment.org.
Ultimately, direct approaches using safe and nurturing touch, along
with physical and emotional contact, will help your baby heal from
trauma.
Coping with Developmental Delays
When babies lag behind in expected developmental milestones
(such as those we discuss in Chapter 3), they may be considered
developmentally delayed. Babies and children may experience
delays in all areas or in specific areas. Some babies catch up to
their expected abilities, while others have limitations for their
whole lives. Whether a delay becomes a disability may depend on
whether the baby receives needed resources or on the cause and
seriousness of the delay.
Delays can affect your baby’s gross and fine motor skills, speech,
language, and social skills. Global delays occur when all areas of
development are affected.
Identifying causes of developmental
delays
Some frequent causes of developmental delays include:
 Premature birth
 Low birth weight
 Down syndrome
 Fetal alcohol syndrome
 Mental retardation
 Neglect and physical abuse

 Cerebral palsy
 Rett syndrome
Realizing effects on attachment
As we explain earlier in this chapter, attachment is a reciprocal
dance between parents and their baby. Developmental delays can
affect your ability to attach and bond with your baby.
It is challenging to form an attachment with a baby who is unable
to return a smile or coo, or a baby who can’t hear you speak lov-
ingly to him. Part of the dance of attachment involves responding
to your baby responding to you. Babies with developmental delays
may not be able to respond in ways you expect, if at all. All babies
need to form secure attachments, but babies with delays need you
to work even harder.
When you have a baby who experiences developmental delays,
touch may be your most important tool of communication.
Trusting the benefits of touch
and massage
Because developmentally delayed babies may have both health
issues and attachment concerns, you may need to address both.
(See Chapter 11 for information about using massage to address
health issues.)
Massage can help you accomplish the following:
 Lower your baby’s stress levels
 Communicate with your baby
 Create a bond and attachment
 Learn to accept your baby’s limitations and appreciate new
gains in development
 Discover what your baby needs
 Stimulate learning
 Encourage your baby to gain weight
 Feel less helpless
 Strengthen your baby’s immune system
Chapter 12: Massage for Emotional and Developmental Issues 207

Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
208
Some developmental delays specifically affect muscle tone. As we
explain in the following section, you can use massage to either
stimulate or relax muscle tone, depending on your baby’s condition.
Working with muscle tone 
Muscle tone is what allows us to move. Muscles may be either soft
or tense. Some developmentally delayed babies have very loose or
floppy muscle tone, while others have stiff, tense muscles.
Hypotonia refers to muscles that are loose and limp. Hypertonia
refers to overly tense and tightened muscles. Some babies alter-
nate between loose and limp muscles and very tense muscles.
Premature babies may experience hypertonia or hypotonia, as well
as babies with the following conditions:
 Cerebral palsy
 Fetal alcohol syndrome
 Down syndrome
 Mental retardation
We discuss massaging premature infants in Chapter 8, and we
cover fetal alcohol syndrome in Chapter 13. Here, we focus on
using massage for babies with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, and
mental retardation.
Down syndrome
Down syndrome is the most frequently diagnosed cause for devel-
opmental delays. Approximately 5,000 babies born in the United
States each year have Down syndrome. According to the National
Down Syndrome Society, 80 percent of babies born with Down syn-
drome are born to women younger than age 25. That’s because the
majority of births occur with women in this age group. The risk of
Down syndrome actually increases with a woman’s age; the inci-
dence of Down syndrome rises dramatically for women over 35.
Causes and prevention
Down syndrome is caused by a chromosomal abnormality.
Although different types of Down syndrome exist, all involve an
error in cell division. The most common type of Down syndrome
involves a baby being born with three copies of chromosome 21.

Research indicates that some cases of Down syndrome may be due
to inadequate supplies of folic acid, a B vitamin. Mothers who have
a low supply of folic acid have a 300 percent higher chance of
having a baby with Down syndrome.
Folic acid helps to support the rapid growth of cells during preg-
nancy. Your amino acids need folic acid to aid in conversion.
Without it, you end up with too much homocysteine in your blood,
which is thought to create birth defects. Your baby needs folic acid
for the proper functioning and production of DNA.
Start taking 400 mcg of folic acid a day before you plan on conceiv-
ing. After you get pregnant, take 600 to 800 mcg of folic acid a day.
(Most prenatal vitamins contain 1,000 mcg.)
Here are some common food sources of folic acid:
 Dark, leafy green vegetables, including broccoli, asparagus,
and collard greens
 Lentils and chickpeas
 Oranges, bananas, and strawberries
 Carrots, tomatoes, and potatoes
 Fortified grains and cereals
 Nuts
 Eggs and milk
 Fish
Symptoms
Down syndrome can cause many different symptoms. Some new-
borns have only a few; others have many. Here are a few common
physical expressions of Down syndrome:
 Loose, limp muscles (muscle hypotonia)
 Eyes that slant upward
 Hyperflexibility
 Abnormally shaped ears
 A flat area on the back of the head
If your doctor suspects that your newborn has Down syndrome,
she will most likely order a karotype, an analysis of the baby’s chro-
mosomes, to confirm the diagnosis.
Chapter 12: Massage for Emotional and Developmental Issues 209

Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
210
Some of the major medical problems associated with Down syn-
drome are:
 Heart defects
 Weakened immunity
 Hearing and vision problems
 Intellectual handicaps
 Digestive problems
 Proneness to spinal injuries due to weakened vertebrae
Massage techniques to use
If your baby has Down syndrome, consult with your pediatrician to
find out if there are any strokes you may need to avoid using, espe-
cially if your baby has a heart problem.
A key thing to keep in mind is to use gentle massage techniques
on a baby with Down syndrome. The following techniques are
appropriate:
 The Dolphin Stroke (see Chapter 4)
 The Ear Stroke (see Chapter 6)
 The Taffy Pull (see Chapters 5 and 7)
 Ankles Away (see Chapters 5 and 7)
 This Little Piggy (see Chapter 5)
 Raking (see Chapters 5 and 7)
 Sun and Moon (see Chapter 5)
 I Love You (see Chapter 5)
 The Open Book Stroke (see Chapters 5 and 6)
 Alternating Hands (see Chapter 5)
 Thumb Circles (see Chapter 5)
 Hands stroking (see Chapter 5)
 Finger stroking (see Chapter 5)
Go slowly, and introduce techniques one or two at a time. Just a
minute or two of massage, followed by holding and cuddling, may
be enough with a developmentally delayed newborn.

Here are some more tips to keep in mind with your Down syn-
drome baby:
 Dry skin is a problem for babies with Down syndrome. You can
find tips on how to handle dry skin in Chapter 11.
 Babies with Down syndrome have difficulty regulating their
body temperature. You can massage your baby with his
clothes on, but make sure he doesn’t overheat.
 Down syndrome creates sinus and chest infections. See
Chapter 11 for tips on dealing with these ailments, and con-
sider running a humidifier in your baby’s room.
 Frequent massage helps your baby develop muscle tone.
Cerebral palsy
Cerebral palsy (CP) is caused by brain injury or abnormal brain
development that occurs either before birth or within the first two
to three years of life. The United Cerebral Palsy Association esti-
mates that 500,000 people in the United States have CP.
Causes
CP is caused by an injury to the part of the brain that controls
movement. Following are some common causes of this type of
injury:
 Severe oxygen shortage to the brain
 Jaundice
 Rh incompatibility
 Infections during pregnancy
Babies with CP are unable to control their movements and posture.
Some babies with CP may have learning problems, mental retarda-
tion, or difficulty seeing. CP is not a progressive disorder.
Types of CP
There are three types of CP:
 Spastic: The muscles are very tight and movement is stiff,
especially in the legs. Babies with spastic CP cannot relax
their muscles.
 Athetoid: Movement throughout the entire body is affected.
Movement is slow and uncontrolled with low muscle tone.
Chapter 12: Massage for Emotional and Developmental Issues 211

Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
212
 Mixed: Involves both too much and too little muscle tone.
Movement is stiff and difficult to control, making balance and
coordination difficult to impossible.
Babies and children with CP are at risk for seizures. Seizures are a
sign that the nervous system is not working correctly. Seizures can
be difficult to notice in a newborn or baby. Here are some signs
that your baby may be having a seizure:
 His eyes are rolling.
 His body is stiff.
 He is crying in a way that sounds very different than usual.
 His arms and legs are moving in a jerking fashion.
 He is staring.
 His movements look unnatural.
 His skin color changes.
 He stops breathing.
If your baby has a seizure, here’s what you need to do:
 Try to stay calm and breathe.
 Turn your baby onto his side.
 Make sure there is nothing in his mouth.
 Place your hand on him for comfort, but don’t try to stop the
jerking.
 After the seizure is over, hold and cuddle your baby while you
call the doctor.
Seizures aren’t necessarily dangerous, but they are very scary to
watch.
Treatment
Babies develop remarkably fast during their first few years. If your
baby has CP, it is important to receive intervention as soon as pos-
sible. Seeking intervention can make a dramatic difference in your
baby’s development.
There isn’t a cure for CP, but treatment for children can help
reduce the effects of the brain injury. Physical and speech therapy,
along with equipment such as braces and splints, are helpful. Ask
your doctor to show you how to do physical therapy exercises
with your newborn at home.

Some parents find that acupuncture and CranioSacral Therapy
are effective treatments for the symptoms of CP. Acupuncture bal-
ances and stimulates the flow of energy (Oi) throughout the body’s
meridians, or energy channels. Acupuncturists either use fine, sterile
needles to stimulate energy flow at acupuncture points (the spe-
cific places where the meridians are easily located), apply heat to
these points, or use a technique called cupping. Cupping stimulates
points through suction, with the use of a jar. To find an acupuncturist
in your area, log onto www.acupuncture.com.
CranioSacral Therapy is a gentle and powerful hands-on therapy
that improves central nervous system functioning and reduces
stress. The gentle touch helps to balance the cerebrospinal fluid
and the tissues around the brain and spinal cord. You can learn
more about CranioSacral Therapy or find a therapist in your area
at The Upledger Institute’s Web site: www.upledger.com.
Massage and touch techniques to use
Massaging your baby with CP can help to reduce muscle tone,
increase muscle control, and improve posture. Regular massage
therapy with your baby can also improve brain and body 
communication.
Here are some techniques you can use on your baby with CP:
 Help your baby’s posture by teaching her how to sit. In
Chapter 14, we show you how.
 Stretch your baby’s arms and legs to prevent contractures
(shortening of the muscles). You can find these stretches in
Chapter 14.
 Avoid constipation, a common effect of CP, by using the tech-
niques we discuss in Chapter 11.
 Use any of the massage techniques we show in this book to
alleviate pain from muscle contractions.
Your baby may be hypersensitive to both touch and stimuli. Be
sure to move slowly and gently and watch her cues.
Mental retardation
People who are mentally retarded have a below-normal IQ (less
than 75) and have considerable difficulty functioning in everyday
life. Statistics show that 3 out of 100 people have some level of
mental retardation (MR). MR is 10 times more common than cere-
bral palsy.
Chapter 12: Massage for Emotional and Developmental Issues 213

Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
214
The severity of someone’s MR used to be determined solely by an
IQ score. Today, the severity of the MR is determined by how much
assistance a person needs. People with MR may need intermittent,
limited, extensive, or pervasive support.
The majority of people with MR have only a mild level of retardation.
They are a little slower than the average person, but most people
wouldn’t even notice that they have MR.
Causes and prevention
A few factors may cause mental retardation, including:
 Genetics
 Severe malnutrition
 Maternal health problems
 Health problems with the baby 
 A difficult birth
Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a common cause of MR in babies.
We cover FAS in Chapter 13.
Many screening tests are available that, if performed early, may
detect a health issue that could progress into MR. Ask your doctor
about these tests.
Symptoms
Because there are many different reasons your baby may have MR,
it may be difficult to diagnose a newborn. Some of the symptoms
won’t present themselves until your baby reaches school age and
her level of intelligence and ability becomes more obvious.
Common signs that something could be wrong are the same as
signs that your baby is developmentally delayed:
 Your baby sits, crawls, or walks far behind schedule.
 She has a very difficult time learning to speak.
 She has difficulty feeding.
Some toddlers with mental retardation or autism bang their heads
against something before they go to bed, usually in an effort to self-
soothe. If your toddler is into head-banging, there are some ways
you can help her:

 Create a relaxing bedtime routine by combining massage with
a warm bath to teach her how to self-soothe.
 Sometimes babies who bang their heads love rhythm. Find
music that your baby enjoys. Play it and dance with your
baby before bath, massage, and bedtime.
Tools for parenting a baby with MR
Your baby with MR needs extra love and attention from you.
Children with MR are at a high risk for low self-esteem as they
grow. They can tell that they are different from other children and
won’t have the same life that others do.
Children with MR also need extra help learning the following:
 How to take care of themselves (such as dressing, feeding,
and going to the bathroom)
 How to communicate
 How to respect boundaries
 How to interact socially (including how to play)
Chapter 12: Massage for Emotional and Developmental Issues 215
Can babies learn sign language?
The answer is absolutely. Teaching babies sign language gives them an important
communication tool to use before they are able to speak. Have you seen a 10-month-
old wave goodbye? Babies learn to wave through repetition. Every time you or a
family member leaves, you wave and say “bye bye.” Pretty soon, your baby starts
to wave back.
You can begin teaching your baby to sign at any age, and you can expect to see
results when they are between 7 and 9 months old. You don’t have to know American
Sign Language either. You can simply make up simple hand gestures as a form of
communication.
Why sign with your baby? Here are some advantages:
 Your baby will be less frustrated as he is able to communicate his needs easily.
 Signing stimulates learning.
 Signing can be fun.
 It enhances your bonding and relationship.

onto www.signingbaby.com or www.babysigns.com.

Most people with MR can lead productive and fulfilling lives. You
can assure a fulfilling life for your baby by providing him with all
the love and support he needs. Here are some ideas for accom-
plishing this goal:
 Practice attachment parenting (see Chapter 1).
 Encourage your toddler’s independence.
 Hold, cuddle, and touch your baby as much as you can.
 Use massage to teach your older baby about boundaries and
touch.
 Have realistic expectations.
 Teach your baby sign language (see the sidebar “Can babies
learn sign language?”).
Handling Special Needs
and Siblings
Jealousy is normal when a child learns that another baby is on the
way. And when you bring a special needs baby into your home, the
jealousy can intensify. If your new baby has a disability, it can have
a profound effect on your family. Plus, your other children may not
understand what is wrong with the new baby.
Being honest
It’s important for you to communicate honestly with your children
about the new baby. Use words they will understand, and keep
things simple.
Tell your children the truth, and encourage them to express their
feelings. Being honest with your children helps them to feel like
equal members of the family. It’s your job to help your children
cope with what they are feeling.
For example, if you have an older birth child and are adopting a
baby, you need to explain what adoption is. You can start by
saying, “Adoption is when a baby lives with another family after
being born.” As your children grow older, plan on adding more of
the truth to the statement: “Your brother’s birth mother wasn’t
able to take care of him, and that’s why we adopted him.”

If your new child has a disability, you need to explain to your other
children everything you can about the condition: What it will be like
for the child, how her health may affect the family, and how any
changes that may need to be made will affect your other children.
Minimizing rivalry
Even though your new baby has special needs and may require a
lot of attention and outside support, make sure that you don’t give
your new baby all your attention. Even though this baby has special
needs, he doesn’t need to be your favorite. If you are giving him all
your attention, he will grow to feel like the favorite, and your other
children will feel that way, too. You will be setting the stage for
resentments, competition, and conflicts between your children.
Here are some ways you can minimize sibling rivalry:
 Enlist the help of your child(ren) in preparing for your new
baby’s arrival. For example, if your new baby will have a nurs-
ery, ask your child(ren) to help decorate it.
 If you are adopting a baby from another culture, share learn-
ing about that culture with your child(ren).
 Teach your child(ren) how to give the new sibling a massage
(see Chapter 9).
 Keep in mind that siblings can co-sleep, too! (See Chapter 3
for more on co-sleeping.)
 Understand that your new baby’s disability is stressful on
your other children.
If you have been giving your children massages and practicing
other tools of attachment parenting, they are more likely to be
compassionate and sensitive. In other words, your children are
more likely to regard the presence of a new baby with special
needs as a gift.
Don’t worry about treating all your children exactly the same.
Celebrate the differences between them by highlighting their 
special skills and uniqueness.

Risk Babies 
In This Chapter
 Helping babies addicted to drugs and alcohol
 Assisting babies affected by HIV and AIDS
 Using resources to help you and your baby
T
he unfortunate truth is that poor prenatal judgment can and
does expose babies to drugs, alcohol, and HIV. Too many new-
borns still suffer from the effects of their mothers’ decisions to
take drugs and consume alcohol and from exposure to the HIV
virus in utero.
Babies born in these circumstances need a lot of extra attention
and compassion. In this chapter, we show how touch and massage
can help give these babies a fighting chance of survival.
Babies Born to Addiction
Unborn babies are vulnerable to the care their mothers give them.
If a mother uses drugs or alcohol during pregnancy, chances are
her baby will be born with a lot of problems. The good news is
that massaging a drug- or alcohol-affected baby can have a strong
positive impact on the health of the baby and on the parent–child
relationship.
Helping the drug-addicted baby
Even over-the-counter drugs can affect the health of an unborn
baby. For example, aspirin taken during the last trimester of preg-
nancy may increase the likelihood of a stillbirth or prolong labor.

Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
220
And certain prescription drugs are addictive to a fetus and lead to
withdrawal symptoms after birth; the number of babies being born
addicted to oxycodone, for example, is increasing rapidly.
You can imagine, then, the dangerous impact of illegal substances
on a baby’s health.
Short- and long-term symptoms
Drug withdrawal is a serious and sometimes dangerous experi-
ence. A baby who is born drug-addicted craves the drug that her
mother used. Because the drug is no longer available, the baby’s
central nervous system is overstimulated, producing withdrawal
symptoms. Adults who are addicted to drugs often feel terrified of
withdrawal. Imagine a baby born with the same feelings, only with-
out the cognitive ability to understand where they came from.
Babies born with drug addictions may have the following symptoms:
 Uncontrollable shaking and sweating
 Vomiting
 Diarrhea
 Nonstop crying
 Difficulty nursing
 Seizures
 A smaller head size than is normal for a newborn
 An increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
 Proneness to respiratory distress
 Strokes
After the immediate concerns of the drug withdrawal are taken
care of, the addicted baby is still at risk for long-term effects. Some
of these effects include:
 An inability to regulate emotions
 An inability to delay gratification
 Poor impulse control
 Social problems
 Difficulty focusing
Often the drug-addicted baby’s mother may be going through with-
drawal as well. If this happens, the newborn may be faced with the

additional trauma of being placed in foster care. If he does stay in
his mother’s care, her ability to be emotionally available to her
baby is diminished.
So in addition to the physical effects of the drugs, these babies
often suffer from separation or emotional abandonment from their
mothers. The effects of an insecure attachment (which we discuss
in Chapter 12) can last a lifetime.
Benefits of massage and touch
Many drug-addicted babies spend a good deal of time in the hospi-
tal, where they are treated for withdrawal. Much of the treatment
they receive is the same as for a premature baby (see Chapter 8).
The difference is that many of these babies may be given Valium,
phenobarbital, or Thorazine to ease the suffering of the withdrawal.
It may take up to a month for a drug-addicted baby to go through
withdrawal. Any touch this baby receives will take place in a
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). These babies need to be
treated very gently and carefully; they are fragile. Some drug-
addicted babies go into spasms and convulsions just from being
touched.
Chapter 13: Massage for High Risk Babies 221
The effects of epidurals on newborns
You may not want to think of an epidural as a drug that affects your baby, but it is.
An epidural is injected into the lumbar region of the mother’s spine. A large amount
of the drug enters her bloodstream and passes through the placenta, where it enters
the baby’s circulatory system. Although epidurals are widely used by many doctors
and hospitals, the effects of the drug have not been adequately studied or routinely
talked about. Epidurals can cause the following effects in newborns:
 Lack of responsiveness
 Decreased visual skills and alertness
 Breastfeeding difficulties
 Decreased heart rate
In addition, an epidural decreases the mother’s ability to push, which raises the inci-
dence of using forceps or vacuums during delivery.
Some studies have indicated a correlation between drugs used during labor and
addiction problems for the baby later in life. Obviously, more research is necessary,
but we strongly encourage you to ask lots of questions of your doctor and nurses
before making the decision to use drugs during delivery.

When a drug-addicted baby is through withdrawal (and out of
danger), you can begin to use some of the massage techniques we
show in this book. Be sure to keep the following in mind during
your massage:
 Keep the stimulation level low. Make sure the lights are dim,
and avoid playing music. (You may be able to hum or sing
softly during the massage.)
Watch closely for signs that your baby is overstimulated
(see Chapter 4). You want to stop any activity before your
baby becomes distressed.
 Use only gentle massage techniques. The following strokes are
safe to use:
• The Dolphin Stroke (see Chapter 4)
• Ears to Chin (see Chapter 6)
• Circling the Eyes (see Chapter 6)
• The Open Book Stroke on the forehead (see Chapter 6)
• The Ear Stroke (see Chapter 6)

The Hale House
“These babies don’t know anything but fear and pain. I try and change that.”
Mother Hale
The Hale House is a nonprofit organization that offers free supportive services to
families in trouble in Harlem, New York. The Hale House began through the work of
one woman, Clara McBride Hale, known simply as Mother Hale. In the late 1960s,
while running a day and respite care program from her home, Mother Hale took in
an infant whose mother was addicted to heroin.
Mother Hale created the Hale House Center for the Promotion of Human
Development, Inc., in 1972, in part to offer help to babies who are either affected by
drugs and alcohol or addicted to these substances.
Mother Hale passed away in 1992. The Hale House continues to run, led by her
daughter, Dr. Lorraine Hale. Today it is flourishing under the care of a board of direc-
tors, Executive Director Randolph McLaughlin, Esq., and a dedicated staff.
Services at the Hale House have expanded over the years to include offering help
and programs to children whose parents are incarcerated or infected with HIV or
AIDS, and to babies and children who need loving homes.
If you’d like to learn more about the remarkable work of the Hale House, you can

 Wear your baby in a sling (see Chapter 1).
 Feed your baby often (at least every three hours).
 Introduce new things only when your baby is in a calm and
relaxed state.
 When rocking your baby, move slowly and gently.
 Make gentle contact with your baby if she tends to space out.
Use eye contact or a soft touch.
Sometimes even eye contact is too stimulating, especially with
babies born addicted to cocaine.
Addressing fetal alcohol syndrome
Babies who suffer from severe effects of maternal alcohol use are
diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) — a lifelong and dis-
abling syndrome. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimate
that as many as 3 out of 2,000 babies born in the United States
have FAS.
Chapter 13: Massage for High Risk Babies 223

The cause of FAS
Alcoholism is a serious problem in the United States. Alcohol
abuse during pregnancy causes devastating results in babies and
children. Despite our knowledge of the effects of alcohol on a fetus,
as many as 1 in 30 pregnant women in the United States reports
having seven or more drinks per week during pregnancy.
When a pregnant woman drinks, the alcohol enters her blood
system, crosses the placenta, and is passed on to her fetus. In a
fetus, the alcohol breaks down slowly. The alcohol stays in a
fetus’s body longer than in an adult’s.
In the first three months of pregnancy, alcohol can cause the 
physical defects of FAS. During the second trimester, the mother
is at risk of losing her baby to a miscarriage. And during the last
trimester, severe growth deficiencies can occur.
Although there is no proven safe amount of alcohol that pregnant
woman can consume, cases of FAS are usually seen in babies
whose mothers are alcoholics or binge drinkers.
Symptoms
The effects of alcohol on a baby are severe and devastating. Three
general areas of development are affected:
 Facial appearance: A baby with FAS usually has small eye
openings, a small face, a short upturned nose, a flat mid-face,
a wide nose bridge, and a thin upper lip. The FAS facial char-
acteristics tend to become more normal-looking in adolescence.
Babies with FAS are at risk for a cleft palate and underdevel-
oped jaw.
Even though many woman stop drinking during the first
trimester (as soon as they learn they are pregnant), this is
when the eyes develop. The eyes are the first facial feature to
be affected, and the damage is irreversible.
 Central nervous system: Babies with FAS experience develop-
mental delays (especially in balance and coordination) and
decreased muscle strength. They usually experience tremors,
and children with FAS have low intellectual functioning and
skills. Some of the issues they suffer with include AD/HD,
behavior problems, poor impulse control, and poor judgment.
As they grow into children and young adults, they typically
have difficulty forming relationships and suffer from other
mental health problems.
Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
224

Children with FAS can be unpredictable and impulsive. They
often need 24-hour monitoring.
 Growth: Low birth weight is common among babies with
FAS; so is less-than-average height and head circumference.
Although the facial features of babies with FAS tend to change
when they reach adolescence, the height and head circumfer-
ence do not, and the measurements stay well below normal.
Although many of the obvious physical effects of FAS are no longer
apparent in adulthood, the behavioral and cognitive problems are
lifelong. FAS is the most common cause of mental retardation (see
Chapter 12).
Treatment and healing
Because FAS is a permanent diagnosis, treatment options are lim-
ited. Some deformities can be changed with surgery, but others
cannot. Psychotropic medication can help some behavioral and
mental health issues.
The majority of babies and children with FAS are raised by relatives
of the birth mother, foster parents, or adoptive families.
Helping babies diagnosed with FAS includes aiding in forming
attachment with the caretakers, as well as either stimulating or
calming the central nervous system. Massaging a baby with FAS
can help you accomplish both.
It may be hard to identify a newborn with FAS. Withdrawal symp-
toms may not occur until the baby is home from the hospital.
Also, many of the identifying characteristics do not show up until
2 to 3 years of age. If you are adopting or have a foster child whose
mother has a history of alcoholism, you may want to assume the
baby could have at least a mild case of FAS. Assuming the possibility
of FAS at least ensures that you will carefully monitor the growth
and development of your baby.
If your baby has been diagnosed with FAS, keep these things in
mind:
 You want to practice attachment parenting and use as many of
the attachment parenting tools as possible (see Chapter 1).
 Children with FAS seem to do well with families who are low
key, quiet, and stable.
 You need to set consistent boundaries and serve as a role
model.
Chapter 13: Massage for High Risk Babies 225

Massage techniques for FAS
The goal of massage for FAS is to foster an attachment and to
either calm or stimulate the central nervous system. You don’t
need to use any special stroke to foster an attachment; simply
spending extra time touching and making contact with your baby
will help you bond.
The nervous system is a different story: You need to be careful
when choosing massage techniques to use because you want to
tailor your touch to your baby’s specific needs.
Stimulating the central nervous system
If your baby’s nervous system is slow, you can use strokes to stim-
ulate it. However, you don’t want to risk overstimulating your baby,
even if he has an underactive nervous system. As always, look for
cues of overstimulation (see Chapter 4), and trust your intuition.
Here are some massage techniques you can use to stimulate the
nervous system:
 Use petrissage strokes (which involve kneading, wringing,
rolling, or squeezing), such as:
• Kneading Dough (see Chapters 5 and 7)
• Squeeze and Twist (see Chapters 5 and 7)
• Thumb Circles (see Chapters 5 and 7)
• The C Stroke (see Chapter 5)
• Alternating Thumbs (see Chapter 7)
Always begin a petrissage stroke by warming up the muscles
with an effleurage technique, such as the Dolphin Stroke
(Chapter 4), The Taffy Pull (Chapters 5 and 7), or Alternating
Hands (Chapter 5).
 Use abdominal or chest strokes (see Chapter 5).
 Alternate using strokes in an upward (stimulating) and down-
ward (relaxing) flow.
 Massage your baby after a nap.
 Include games, rhymes, and music during your massage
(see Chapter 9).
 Be sure to give your baby a massage during tummy time.
 Massage your baby at unexpected times, as well as during
your daily routine. For example, massage your baby every
morning after a nap and then several times throughout the
day at the changing table.
Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
226

 Use some of the massage techniques from Chapter 14 to add
variety to your massage sequence.
Calming the central nervous system
If your baby has an overly sensitive nervous system, you need to
practice techniques to soothe it. Here are some examples:
 Spend a lot of time holding and cuddling your baby before
beginning to use any massage sequence. When your baby can
tolerate touch, start introducing gentle massage strokes.
 In the beginning, introduce effleurage strokes one at a time:
• The Dolphin Stroke (see Chapter 4)
• The Taffy Pull (see Chapters 5 and 7)
• Raking (see Chapters 5 and 7)
• Alternating Hands (see Chapter 5)
• Hand stroking (see Chapter 5)
• Finger stroking (see Chapter 5)
 Massage your baby’s face, but only if she enjoys it. Some
babies love having their faces and heads touched and mas-
saged. Others find it too stimulating. Watch your baby’s cues,
and stop if it becomes too stimulating for her. Some techniques
(from Chapter 6) to try include:
• The Smile Stroke
• Circling the Eyes
• The Open Book Stroke
• The Ear Stroke
• Chinny Chin Chin
 Use strokes in a downward direction only.
 Be sure to give the massage in a dark and quiet room.
 Give your baby a massage after a bath.
 Massage your baby with one hand while you are holding him.
 See Chapter 9 for our recommendations on how to handle
temper tantrums.
Caring for the caregiver
Parenting a child with FAS means providing constant supervision,
setting boundaries, getting medical care for the baby, finding finan-
cial help, and working with outside agencies to make sure your
Chapter 13: Massage for High Risk Babies 227

baby receives the proper intervention. It can be exhausting. Be
sure to join a support group, ask for help when you need it, and
keep realistic expectations.
The National Organization of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (NOFAS) offers
a listing of community support groups and resources in the United
States. Contact NOFAS at 202-785-4585, or visit www.nofas.org.
Babies Exposed to HIV
The good news is that a pregnant mother who is HIV-positive can
give birth to a baby who is HIV-negative, if she carefully follows
specific procedures. The bad news is that many women still pass
on HIV to their babies.
Assuming the mother follows the procedures she should, after the
baby is born he needs to receive vaccinations, medication, and
testing to ensure that he remains HIV-negative.
Many babies whose mothers are HIV-positive also cope with other
issues from the time they are born, such as drug or alcohol addiction
or placement in foster care or an adoptive family. Using compas-
sionate touch and massage can help these babies navigate all
these transitions more successfully.
Navigating pregnancy with HIV
When a pregnant woman has HIV, she will most likely pass on the
virus to her baby unless she follows certain protocols. HIV can be
passed on to babies during pregnancy, during delivery, or through
breastfeeding. Most incidences of HIV transmission occur during
labor.
The medication that an HIV-positive mother and her baby need
to take to prevent transmission of the virus could possibly have
serious side effects. Doctors and researchers don’t yet know the
extent of the side effects because of the relatively short time they
have been providing treatment and prevention.
Steps to prevent transmission
An HIV-positive mother may continue to take her HIV drugs or stop
her medication early in the pregnancy and restart it later during
pregnancy. If she is newly diagnosed with HIV, she may consider
waiting until the second trimester to begin medication.
Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
228

Certain HIV medications are known not to be safe to take during
pregnancy:
 Efavirenz
 D4T
 ddI and d4t combined 
 Amprenavir (oral liquid)
 Hydroxyurea
Assuming the mother is taking medications other than those listed
above, the reason for not taking medication during part of the
pregnancy is that the effects of other HIV medications on a fetus
are largely unknown. Because transmission of HIV usually occurs
late in pregnancy, the mother may opt to reduce potential risks to
the fetus by stopping her medication for a short time.
An HIV-positive mother should talk with her doctor about taking an
antiviral medication like AZT, which, if taken during the last six
months of pregnancy, reduces the transmission rate to about 4 per-
cent. So far, birth defects and long-term side effects to the fetus
from AZT use during pregnancy have not been observed.
Even more effective than taking AZT during pregnancy is following
a short course of treatment during labor and delivery that combines
drugs like Nevirapine and AZT. Using this treatment reduces the
transmission rate to 1 to 2 percent.
Chapter 13: Massage for High Risk Babies 229
HIV, AIDS, and women
The Centers for Disease Control estimates that 280 to 370 children are born with HIV
each year in the United States. Here are some other disturbing statistics regarding
women, babies, HIV, and AIDS, pulled from the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric Aids
Foundation Web site (www.pedaids.org):
 Worldwide, 50 percent of all people now living with HIV or AIDS are women.
 Ninety-one percent of children who are HIV-positive in the United States got
the virus from their mothers.
 AIDS is the leading cause of death for African American women ages 25 to 34.
 Worldwide, approximately 2,000 children are infected with HIV every day.
 An estimated 13 million children have been orphaned due to AIDS.

However, taking HIV medications during the pregnancy can affect
how successful the later treatments (if needed) will be for both
the mother and baby, if the virus develops a resistance to the 
medication.
The mother can also take other steps to help ensure that HIV will
not be transmitted to her baby, including:
 Maintaining excellent prenatal care
 Exercising
 Not smoking
 Getting adequate rest
 Scheduling a C section (to avoid the baby coming in contact
with the mother’s blood during delivery)
However, women with a low viral load who are taking a combi-
nation of medications can have a vaginal birth. What is a low
viral load? Viral load tests measure the progression of HIV in
the body by testing the amount of the virus in the blood.
Infants born to HIV-positive mothers test positive for HIV anti-
bodies in a viral load test until 12 to 18 months of age because
they carry their mothers’ antibodies. Mothers with higher
viral loads are more likely to infect their babies than those
with low viral loads.
 Feeding the baby formula. Although controversy exists
regarding breastfeeding, the current recommendation in the
United States is that the safest way to avoid infection after
birth is not to breastfeed.
In developing countries, where clean water is an issue, breast-
feeding is considered the better choice. Even though the risk
of infecting the baby is serious, the effects of drinking contam-
inated water are more serious.
HIV tests
Standard HIV tests detect the presence of antibodies that fight HIV;
they do not detect the presence of HIV itself. Because babies carry
their mothers’ antibodies until approximately 18 months, a baby
whose mother has HIV may test positive for the virus shortly after
birth, even if he is not infected. For this reason, it may not be pos-
sible to determine whether a baby has been infected with HIV until
he has reached 18 months of age. Babies who are infected with HIV
continue to test positive beyond 18 months.
A different kind of test — the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
test — actually looks for HIV in the body, not antibodies. The pre-
ferred method of testing is to offer a first PCR test 48 hours after
Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
230

delivery and, if it is positive, to retest at 14 days. This procedure
helps achieve an earlier diagnosis.
Why doesn’t everyone get the PCR test? Whether you are offered a
standard HIV test or a PCR test may be determined by where you
live. The PCR test is expensive, requires the healthcare provider to
have specialized training, and is labor-intensive.
Symptoms of HIV-positive babies
Babies with HIV may begin showing flu-like symptoms within a
month of birth. Other signs of HIV may start to become evident at
around 6 months of age, including:
 Slow growth and lack of weight gain
 Yeast infections
 Severe diaper rash
 Developmental delays
 Neurological problems
Severe symptoms, such as chronic diarrhea or lung disease, may
not appear until the baby is 2 years old.
Due to poor immune functioning, HIV-positive babies are at risk for
catching the flu and other illnesses. In particular, the herpes virus
cytomegalovirus (CMV) can be deadly to HIV-positive babies. Most
healthy people come in contact with CMV and experience few or
no symptoms. But babies with compromised immune systems may
come down with pneumonia, stunted brain growth, and other severe
problems. There seems to be some interplay between HIV and CMV:
Babies with HIV catch CMV more easily, and some researchers
believe that CMV may contain a protein that helps HIV spread.
Symptoms of CMV are:
 Lung problems
 Growth and developmental delays
 Dental abnormalities
 Poor weight gain
 Swollen glands
 Hepatitis
 Blood problems
Chapter 13: Massage for High Risk Babies 231

As with HIV, many babies do not show symptoms of CMV right
away. However, premature babies may show symptoms early.
Massaging babies with
(or exposed to) HIV
The massage treatment for babies exposed to HIV and babies who
have the virus is the same. HIV-exposed babies are placed on med-
ication to prevent the transmission of the virus, even though they
may be HIV-negative. These babies are under stress and affected
by the medication just as babies with HIV are.
Massage benefits HIV-positive babies in the following ways:
 It improves immune system functioning.
 It increases relaxation hormones.
 It promotes weight gain.
 It helps the baby sleep.
 It increases the baby’s attachment with the caregiver.
 It positively affects intellectual developmental.
Babies who may not have the virus but are taking HIV medication
preventatively receive the following benefits from massage:
 It increases their relaxation hormones.
 It helps babies under stress to sleep better.
 It creates a bond between the baby and the caregiver.
There aren’t any particular massage strokes or techniques that you
need to use to help your baby. Generally, you can choose any of
the strokes or sequences we list throughout the book. However,
here are a few tips to keep in mind:
 Babies typically begin taking medications like AZT right after
birth. The type of medication they take depends upon what
medication the mother was taking during pregnancy. Drugs like
AZT can have serious side effects to the baby, such as anemia
or congestive heart failure. If your baby experiences such side
effects, check with your healthcare provider about strokes you
would like to use to be sure there aren’t any contraindications.
 Potent medications may make your baby ill in other ways as
well; diarrhea and vomiting are common side effects. If your
Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
232

baby is sick from medication, holding and cuddling will be
enough initially. You need to wait to introduce a massage
sequence.
 Stability and consistency are very important to the health of
these babies. You can use massage to create a routine of nur-
turing, loving touch.
Babies often have to take medication three or four times a
day. In order to help them take the medication, a routine must
be established. You could help make the routine a little nicer
by rewarding taking the medication with a nurturing massage
afterwards.
 HIV-positive babies often have associated illnesses that may
affect their health. Some of these illnesses and conditions
could be:
• Cardiovascular problems
• Behavioral problems
• Anemia
Less severe conditions, such as chronic sinusitis and diges-
tive troubles, can be eased with massage techniques (see
Chapter 11).
 Some infants and children get headaches as a side effect of
medications. Following is a massage sequence just for
headaches:
• The Dolphin Stroke (see Chapter 4)
• Ears to Chin (see Chapter 6)
• Circling the Eyes (see Chapter 6)
• The Open Book Stroke (see Chapters 5 and 6)
• Big Circles (see Chapter 6)
• The Temple Stroke (see Chapter 6)
• Long Strokes (see Chapter 7)
If your baby won’t tolerate a whole massage sequence just
yet, try only one or two strokes. Good choices would be The
Open Book and Temple strokes.
Be sure to include the neck and shoulders in your headache
massage. Tension held here could contribute to a headache.
Finish your headache relief massage by holding onto your
baby’s feet for a few moments and breathing. Imagine you
can feel your baby’s energy moving down through her body
to her feet.
Chapter 13: Massage for High Risk Babies 233

 Many HIV-positive babies’ lives are in transition; they may be
waiting for permanent home placements. Massage techniques
and tips from Chapter 12 may be helpful.
The majority of babies diagnosed with HIV — about 80 percent —
experience a slow progression of the disease and show very few
symptoms as they grow older. About 20 percent of babies diag-
nosed with HIV become very ill within their first year and have a
short life expectancy. Factors that determine how the disease pro-
gresses include how early the diagnosis was given and the type of
care the baby received.
Using other complementary 
therapies
The term complementary therapy refers to therapies that comple-
ment traditional treatments. Massage therapy is typically considered
a complementary therapy (as well as a preventative therapy because
regular massage can prevent many stress-related illnesses).
In addition to massage, you can use other complementary thera-
pies along with traditional treatments to maintain the health of
your HIV-positive baby. Some of these therapies are:
 Acupuncture, which we discuss in Chapter 11
 CranioSacral Therapy, which we also discuss in Chapter 11
 Nutrition and vitamin therapy, which you can research online
at sites such as www.hivresources.com and www.doctor
yourself.com
 Baby yoga, which you can read about at www.itsybitsy
yoga.com
 Chiropractic care, which we explain in Chapter 7
Always let your regular healthcare provider know when you are
using complementary therapies.
Taking universal precautions
Using universal precautions prevents contact with the HIV virus.
While it is important for you to touch and massage your baby, you
must also protect yourself, other caregivers, and family members
from the virus. We recommend that you read the following list and
use your judgment as to what precautions are right for your family
and situation.
Part IV: Easing Health Problems with Massage 
234

We realize that the following suggestions seem very clinical. We do
think they are important, however, because practicing universal
precautions is a reality when a loved one has HIV or AIDS.
 Use barrier protection (such as gloves) if there is a potential
of your skin coming in contact with the baby’s blood.
 Wash your hands (or other body parts) immediately and thor-
oughly if they come in contact with the baby’s blood.
 Do everything possible to avoid your baby having accidental
injuries. Keep sharp objects well out of reach, for example.
Additional Resources
Drug or alcohol addiction and HIV/AIDS are serious issues that
affect families in profound ways. Adding baby massage to your rou-
tine will no doubt help you and your baby significantly. However,
you still need a ton of support.

Trying Massages from Other Parts
of the World
Infant massage is practiced in many cultures throughout the world.
In this section, we offer just a sampling of the variety of massage
techniques used.
Indian massage
This type of massage is based on Ayurvedic philosophy. First, a bit
of background: Ayurveda (meaning “the knowledge of life”) seeks
harmony by balancing the body’s energies through diet, exercise,
yoga, and massage. The body’s three energies are called Vata, Pitta,
and Kapha. Each of us has all three energies, but we usually have
one or two predominant ones. Ayurveda teaches how to balance
these energies by appreciating and working with our body’s true
nature.

Followers of Ayurvedic philosophy give their newborns a daily
massage before their bath. The massage consists of dipping a soft
wheat dough ball in almond oil (along with a dash of turmeric) and
rolling the ball along the infant’s back (lengthwise). The purpose of
the infant massage is to energetically cleanse and to increase circu-
lation, eliminate toxins, and assist in digestion.
When the newborn is a month old, the baby’s daily massage
changes. The focus of this massage is on the muscle groups used
to support the body (in the back, neck, abdomen, arms, and legs).
In Indian culture, massage is recommended for babies until 
approximately 2 years of age. You can find more information on
this type of massage by reading Ayurvedic Massage: Traditional
Indian Techniques for Balancing Body and Mind by Harish Johari
(Healing Arts Press).
Tui Na massage
Like acupuncture (which we discuss in Chapter 12), Tui Na mas-
sage (Chinese massage) works by balancing the body’s energy,
called Oi. Unlike acupuncture, it doesn’t use needles!
Chinese massage is touted as an excellent remedy for colic and
fussiness. People who use this type of massage believe that a
baby’s energy channels (called meridians) can be affected by the
many developmental changes that occur from infancy through
childhood. They believe that balancing your baby’s flow of energy
adds harmony to the body and lessens the effects of blocked
energy flow.
If your baby is restless, try using the following Tui Na stroke on his
forehead:
1. Place both thumbs on their sides with your fingertips
facing each other in the center of your baby’s forehead,
just above the middle of his eyebrows.
2. Use slight pressure and move one thumb up towards the
hairline, immediately followed by your other thumb.
3. Use this same motion — one thumb stroking up toward
the hairline, followed by the other — for a few minutes.
Because your baby is restless when you start this treatment, he
may become slightly more restless or agitated when you begin and
then show signs of calming down.
Part V: The Part of Tens

Handbook of Chinese Massage: Tui Na Techniques to Awaken Body
and Mind, by Maria Mercati (Healing Arts Press).
Shiatsu massage
Shiatsu is a form of Japanese massage. It is similar to Chinese
(Tui Na) massage in that pressure points are stimulated in order
to balance energy. What makes Shiatsu unique is the addition of
lifts, twists, and stretches to the massage sequence.
You can add a simple Shiatsu technique to your repertoire by using
the following leg stretch:
1. Lay your baby on her belly.
2. Place one hand on her sacrum. (See Figure 7-12 in
Chapter 7 to see where the sacrum is located.)
3. Lift and bend both of your baby’s legs to bring her feet in
towards the buttocks.
4. Apply gentle, downward pressure onto your baby’s
lower back.
African massage
In some African cultures, babies are massaged with hot com-
presses to relax their muscles. You can do this at home by running
a washcloth under water that is not too hot, rolling it into a ball,
and gently pressing it onto your baby’s body.
Keep the unmassaged parts of your baby’s body covered so she
stays warm.
Stretching
Generally speaking, stretching is good for everyone. It relaxes your
muscles, reduces stress, and increases flexibility. You don’t really
have to teach your baby to stretch, because babies do it naturally.
However, you can incorporate assisted stretches into your mas-
sage routine. In this section, we show you how.
Arm stretches
Stretching your newborn’s arms helps to relieve stress and lengthen
unused muscles. Older babies love it just because it feels good.
Chapter 14: (Almost) Ten Special Techniques 243

The Arm Cross is an easy stretch to incorporate into your massage
routine:
1. While your baby is lying on her back, take hold of her
right arm and pull the arm gently across her chest
toward the opposite side of her body.
2. As you are pulling the right arm across her chest, simul-
taneously pull her left arm gently across her chest toward
the opposite side of her body (see Figure 14-1).
Figure 14-1: Simultaneously stretch both arms across your baby’s body.
Leg stretches
You can assist your baby as he develops muscle strength in his
legs by including stretches in your massage.
Use the Leg Cross stretch during your regular massage or even
on the changing table. Here’s how:
1. Cross your baby’s lower legs.
2. Gently push both knees toward his chest, making
sure to keep his bottom on the floor, bed, or table
(see Figure 14-2).
3. Cross your baby’s legs the other way, and repeat Step 2.

Figure 14-2: Gently push both legs toward your 
baby’s chest.
Helping Your Baby’s Posture
You can help your baby protect her developing spine by supporting
her when she is learning to sit. In this section, we show you how.
Supported sitting
When babies are first learning to sit, they slump and slouch and
wind up sitting more on the spine than their legs. You can help
your baby’s spine by gently pulling her body forward a bit and
placing her hands on the floor in front of her. Watch her spine
lengthen into its natural curve.
Even if your baby looks secure in this posture, stay close by to
catch her in case she topples over.
Chapter 14: (Almost) Ten Special Techniques 245

Unsupported sitting
After your baby has mastered sitting, you can help keep her hips
open by spreading her legs a little wider than usual in front of her.
Push her forward slightly, and use this opportunity to give her
back and neck a massage.
Even babies who can sit by themselves tend to slide down and
slouch when they get tired. Keep an eye on your baby’s posture;
if she slides down onto her lower back, she may need a nap or a
change of scenery.
Bringing Baby into Your
Yoga Routine
If you practice yoga, you’re in luck! When you bring your baby into
your yoga routine, you are able to spend quality time relaxing and
bonding with your little one physically, emotionally, spiritually, and
energetically. Of course, babies aren’t able to practice the postures
on their own, but get creative and find ways to bring your baby
into your yoga postures — see Figure 14-3 for an example.
Figure 14-3: Let your little one mold to your body in Navasana (Boat Pose).
In Chapter 15, we recommend a video on postnatal yoga that offers
lots of great ideas for making your baby part of your yoga routine.

Ten Great Massage
Resources
In This Chapter
 Finding resources online
 Locating great organizations
 Watching useful videos
I
f this book has piqued your curiosity and you’re interested in
finding out even more about baby massage, you’re in luck —
you have a variety of resources to choose from. In this chapter,
we direct you toward some of our favorite sources of information,
including Web sites, organizations, and videos.
Surfing the Web
A plethora of baby massage-related information is available online.
Following are some of our picks for the most useful Web sites to
visit.
www.InfantMassage.com
You can find virtually everything you need to know about infant
massage on this Web site. It includes a directory of infant massage
classes available in your area, and if you are a massage practitioner,
you can become a certified Premature Infant Massage Instructor
through this site’s program.

www.AskDrSears.com
Dr. Bill and Martha Sears, along with two of their sons (who are
pediatricians), offer information on this site about baby massage,
attachment parenting, co-sleeping, nursing, and the basics of sensi-
tive parenting and childcare.
www.HealthyFamily.org
A Foundation for Healthy Family Living (AFHFL) offers infant 
massage education and training to parents, families, hospitals,
and interested organizations. We like this foundation because it is
dedicated to creating healthy families and communities through
education about respectful communication and nurturing touch.
www.LittleForest.com
Did you know that some baby lotions contain formaldehyde and
some tearless shampoos contain numbing agents? That’s why
Little Forest creates 100 percent natural baby products that you
can use to massage and bathe your baby. This company has an
extensive list of products that you can purchase online.
Finding Massage Associations
Following are several associations that you can contact if you’d
like to know more about massage or body work.
American Massage Therapy
Association
The American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA) exists to
advance the practice of massage therapy, set ethical standards,
and promote health. This organization is located in Evanston,
Illinois. You can reach its offices at 847-864-0123 or contact AMTA
online at www.AMTAmassage.org.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
248

International Association 
of Infant Massage
We introduce you to the International Association of Infant Massage
(IAIM) in Chapter 1. This organization is located in Ventura, California
and can be reached at 805-644-8524 or by visiting the Web site at
www.iaim-us.com.
International Loving 
Touch Foundation
The International Loving Touch Foundation (ILTF) offers training
programs for infant massage instructors and information on where
to find one in your area. You can also order books, videos, oils, and
music from its Web site, www.lovingtouch.com. ILTF is located in
Portland, Oregon and can be reached at 502-253-8482.
Associated Bodywork & Massage
Professionals
Associated Bodywork & Massage Professionals (ABMP) is similar
to the American Massage Therapy Association in that it offers
resources and support for massage and bodywork professionals.
We really like the magazine this organization publishes, Massage
and Bodywork, and think it’s worth the membership fee just for the
subscription. The ABMP is located in Colorado and can be reached
at 800-458-2267 or online at www.abmp.com.
Using Videos
The following videos are useful in helping you to learn new tech-
niques and bring your baby into your yoga or exercise routines.
They can all be purchased at www.FitnessBeginnings.com.
Baby Massage and Exercise
This video gives you easy and clear instructions to follow. The
massage sequence is relaxing and nice to use just before bedtime.
Chapter 15: Ten Great Massage Resources 249

Infant Massage/Postnatal 
Yoga Combo Pack
This video combination pack includes the hour-long Infant Massage
video, which shows you some basics, as well as techniques to help
with colic, gas, and other common ailments, in an easy-to-follow
format.
Yoga Journal’s Postnatal Yoga video, which also comes in this
combo pack, is almost perfect for new moms wanting to start their
postpartum yoga practice safely. Our only issue is that it is an hour
long, and most new mothers don’t have that much time! Several
props are recommended for the sequences in this video: a blanket,
block, mat, bolster, and chair.
Exercise with Daddy & Me
We include this video because it’s a great way to encourage fathers
to massage, stretch, and exercise with their babies. This 45-minute
videotape was designed by a nurse and a pediatrician, and it con-
tains warm-ups, exercises, cool-downs, and massage techniques.
