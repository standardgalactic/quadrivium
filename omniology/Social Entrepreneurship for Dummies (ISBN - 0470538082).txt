About the Authors
Mark B. Durieux, PhD: Mark is an applied and clinical sociologist who 
teaches and consults widely with community groups and the public concern-
ing the contemporary study and practice of compassion and social entrepre-
neurship. He also teaches a comprehensive range of sociology courses at the 
university level — everything from social statistics and research methods to 
social psychology and leisure. But his courses in the areas of the sociology 
of compassion, social entrepreneurship, and grounded theory methodology 
are well known for their innovative content and delivery. Mark is currently 
collaborating with a number of extremely supportive and well-respected 
academic and frontline colleagues in developing and creatively extending the 
last three areas.
Robert A. Stebbins, PhD: Robert is faculty professor in the Department of 
Sociology at the University of Calgary. He has also taught at the University 
of Texas at Arlington and Memorial University of Newfoundland. Robert 
received his doctorate in sociology in 1964 from the University of Minnesota. 
Among his 35 books are A Dictionary of Nonproﬁ t Terms and Concepts (with 
David H. Smith and Michael Dover) and Serious Leisure: A Perspective for Our 
Time. Robert was elected Fellow of the Academy of Leisure Sciences in 1996 
and, in 1999, elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. His own seri-
ous leisure includes volunteering in Calgary’s French-language community. 
He has helped establish two social enterprises and served on the boards of 
directors of several others.


Dedication
To Friedel (mom); Barney (dad); Sherry (wife and very best friend); Meghan, 
Matthew, and Emma (fantastic children, really!); Bob Stebbins and Jaber 
Gubrium (super-supportive colleagues); and the truly compassionate and 
social entrepreneurial friends and folk I encounter daily.
—Mark Durieux
To Karin.
—Robert Stebbins

Introduction
W
elcome to Social Entrepreneurship For Dummies!
If you’re browsing through this book, chances are good that you’re 
more than a little worried, anxious, or frustrated about a world that is abso-
lutely bristling with problems. Maybe you’re not exactly mad as hell — yet — 
but on some days you feel like you’re getting close. It’s a good bet that you’re 
also feeling that it’s about time you stepped up to the plate and tried to make 
a positive difference.
Maybe you’ve already dipped a toe in these waters. Maybe you’ve volun-
teered, but didn’t feel quite fulfilled. Volunteers tend to work on already 
recognized issues, whereas you, on the other hand, may be dismayed by 
problems that not enough others see. Or maybe the problems you see have 
been recognized, but reaction times in addressing them seem soooo slooow 
that you just have to shake your head.
Things needed to be done yesterday! You sense the urgency. Doesn’t anybody 
else? Is it that others just haven’t got around to it yet? Is there a lack of know-
how or available resources? At this point, it doesn’t much matter. Somebody’s 
got to do something. And you have a feeling that somebody is you.
About This Book
If we’ve just sketched a portrait of you, in however rough an outline, this 
book is intended for you. You may not know it yet, but you’re a social entre-
preneur in the making.
Very simply put, a social entrepreneur is someone who uses business prin-
ciples to address social or environmental problems. Social entrepreneurs 
become experts on the problems they fight — whether those are local, 
regional, national, or global — and, as often as not, they’re visionaries. Social 
entrepreneurs see that we’re all our brothers’ and sisters’ keepers, and they 
form effective organizations to carry out missions to demonstrate that in one 
form or another. This book walks you through what it takes to become one 
of these visionaries and lays out many of the principles and strategies social 
entrepreneurs employ, both practical and philosophical.

Conventions Used in This Book
To make this book as easy to use as we can, we try to define each new term 
as it comes up. We also use the following conventions:
 
✓ Italics are used when we introduce new terms (which we define shortly 
thereafter, often in parentheses).
 
✓ Boldface words and phrases in bulleted lists and numbered steps help 
you pick out the keywords at a glance.
 
✓ Web addresses, or URLs, are in a special monofont typeface. The link 
may be only one page of a larger, interesting Web site, so take advantage 
and explore the rest of the sites we mention in this book.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break 
across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that we haven’t put in 
any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using 
one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book, 
pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
You’re busy — we know that. So if you need to skip over sections of the book, 
you can safely skip the sidebars and any chapters that just don’t seem rel-
evant. You can also skip anything marked by a Technical Stuff icon (for more 
on icons, see “Icons Used in This Book,” later in this Introduction).
Foolish Assumptions
If you’ve read even this far, we assume the following:
 
✓ You want to become a social entrepreneur, or at least want to know 
enough about it to make a decision. You may be moving in this direc-
tion because you’re concerned about the state of the environment or 
because you recognize that creating an organization is the best way to 
battle poverty, for example, or homelessness, or the issues of hunger or 
drinking water availability in some far-off land.
 
✓ You don’t have a lot of experience running an organization. That’s 
why we slow down and address many fundamental concepts that go into 
the effective operation of organizations.

 Introduction
 
✓ You want to look for ways to give your existing business a social 
entrepreneurial slant. You have a for-profit business and you’re think-
ing about your corporate social responsibility and how to implement it.
 
✓ You’re committed to making a difference, and you’re not attached to 
the status quo. You’re ready for change and willing to take risks to get it.
 
✓ You’re curious. You want to discover more about what you don’t know. 
You’re reading this book to expand your thinking about the various 
ways of tackling your chosen issue.
 
✓ You’re willing to put some real effort into this. You’re not an armchair 
quarterback anymore. You realize we can’t give you your social enter-
prise or run it for you, and we can’t even cover everything you need to 
know in the limited space we have here. You’re ready to continue your 
research after reading this book.
How This Book Is Organized
We’ve organized this book in five parts. Each part builds on the one before, but 
don’t feel like you have to read the chapters in order. Each chapter stands on 
its own as an examination of a piece of the social entrepreneurial puzzle.
Part I: An Introduction to 
Social Entrepreneurship
In Part I, we introduce the fundamental concepts of social entrepreneur-
ship and the social context within which it takes place. Compassion is at the 
heart of social enterprises, and it’s the main theme of Chapter 2. Motivation 
is another important component, and Chapter 3 presents a set of ideas and 
concepts aimed at helping you understand what motivates people to become 
social entrepreneurs.
Social entrepreneurship is almost always a group effort, and in Chapter 4 we 
cover the vital issue of communication within an enterprise. The final chap-
ter in this part, Chapter 5, examines the multitude of trends that currently 
bear on social entrepreneurship. They can subtly influence how your own 
enterprise will evolve and whether it’s likely to fail or succeed.
Part II: Establishing Your Organization
In Chapter 6, we set out a smorgasbord of areas in which social entrepreneur-
ship has succeeded over the years, while pointing out that more work of this 
kind remains to be done. The intent is to help you zero in on the specific area 

4
Social Entrepreneurship For Dummies 
of life where you’d like to generate significant social change. We get down to 
discussing the initial planning of your enterprise, including setting your 
mission and goals, in Chapter 7 and help you answer the question of whether 
to organize as a nonprofit group or one that seeks a profit in Chapter 8.
Finding the money necessary to run your enterprise is invariably an early 
concern, especially if you choose to be a nonprofit organization; various 
ways of obtaining money are the subject of Chapter 9. In Chapter 10, we look 
at the importance of establishing the identity of your new enterprise and cre-
ating your own unique brand; we also explore ways of achieving these things 
effectively.
Part III: Growing Your Organization
Getting something up and running is one step, but keeping it alive and grow-
ing requires more knowledge and skills. The main theme of the chapters in 
Part III is finding out how you can make your organization into a continuing 
success. Networking is an important strategy for reaching this goal (Chapter 
11), and so is working effectively with the media — newspapers, radio, televi-
sion, magazines, the Internet, and other public outlets (Chapter 12).
The dreaded concept of bureaucracy is often a necessary part of a social 
enterprise, and keeping it under control can sometimes be difficult, as we 
explain in Chapter 13. Bureaucracy is usually part of a formalized social 
enterprise — one that is incorporated, has a constitution, and perhaps has 
governmental charity status — which we discuss in Chapter 14.
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization 
Running for the Long Haul
It takes leadership and good management to keep an organization on course 
for the long haul. Chapter 15 takes a close look at the entrepreneur side of 
social entrepreneurship, including the fundamentals of capitalism, the need 
for innovation, and the development of relevant knowledge.
All strong organizations have, or should have, a good set of leaders. In Chapter 
16 we explore the principles of leadership and the power of charisma, and we 
address problems stemming from overusing power. We give broader consid-
eration in Chapter 17 to the management of social enterprises — of recruiting 
and managing paid staff and volunteers, whipping up morale, and looking after 
your organization’s expenses. The final chapter in this part, Chapter 18, cen-
ters on teamwork and the roles of passion and compassion in motivating effec-
tive coordinated group efforts.

 Introduction
Part V: The Part of Tens
If you’re inspired to start a social enterprise, but you haven’t yet found a 
social problem around which to organize it, look at Chapter 19 for a list of 
ten great areas for social entrepreneurial action. And always steer clear of 
common mistakes in this field, a helpful list of which appears in Chapter 20. 
Finally, the appendix lists many useful further resources for starting and run-
ning a social enterprise.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, you’ll see little pictures in the margins, called icons. 
Icons are there to grab your attention. Here’s what each of the icons means:
 
Ideas next to this icon help you move your social enterprise forward or high-
light especially relevant information that can save you time.
 
Paying attention to the tidbits next to this icon saves you time, money, and 
perhaps even some heartache. This icon warns you about possible problems 
or glitches you may encounter on the way to becoming a social entrepreneur.
 
This icon flags information that you should keep in mind in the long term, if 
not memorize, as you explore social entrepreneurship.
 
This icon indicates more advanced, arcane, or difficult stuff, such as deeper 
details or background, which may or may not interest you. You can safely skip 
this material.
 
Throughout the book, we use concrete or hypothetical examples to illustrate 
important concepts. Seeing the idea in action often gives you a better idea 
how to apply it.
Where to Go from Here
Are you ready to get started? Although you can start with any chapter, here 
are a few suggestions to get you off to a good start.

6
Social Entrepreneurship For Dummies 
If you’re new to the whole concept of social entrepreneurship, we suggest 
starting with the chapters in Part I. Heck, start with Chapter 1, if you like, and 
don’t look back.
If you have a fairly good idea what social entrepreneurs do and what you 
care about in particular, you might start with the chapters in Part II to wade 
straight into ideas on forming your own organization.
Feel free to use the book’s handy Table of Contents or Index to look up your 
specific areas of interest and dive straight in that way.
However you use this book, and wherever you start your exploration, we 
hope you become as enamored and inspired as we are about the possibilities 
of social entrepreneurship. And we wish you the best in your future success.
Now, read on!

Part I
An Introduction to 
Social 
Entrepreneurship

In this part . . .
W
e believe that laying some groundwork for the 
foundations of social entrepreneurship before 
building your organization is a good idea. And that’s what 
this part is all about.
Chapter 1 is an overview of what social entrepreneurship 
is and how it works. Chapter 2 wades — gently — into 
some important aspects of social entrepreneurship theory 
that we believe can be crucial to your success. Chapter 3 
takes on the issue of motivation, because knowing why 
people do what they do in the field of social entrepreneur-
ship can have untold long-term benefits. Chapter 4 
explores the currency of any enterprise: communication. 
And Chapter 5 gives you some insight into the larger 
forces currently at work that affect all social 
entrepreneurs.

Chapter 1
Social Entrepreneurship: 
A Calling for You
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering what social entrepreneurship is all about
▶ Seeing where you fit in and how to get started
▶ Being inspired by examples of social entrepreneurs
▶ Preparing to move forward with your passion and ideas
A
t the most basic level, social entrepreneurs want to fix problems. What 
kinds of problems? Well, what kinds of problems might you be con-
cerned with? Some problems are nuisances or pet peeves, like overcrowded 
roads, outrageous dress, rude drivers, barking dogs, and telephone solicitors. 
Other problems threaten or degrade our way of life: environmental pollution, 
crime, corruption in business and government, economic crises, and so on. 
And then there are the problems that threaten life itself: climate change, war, 
famine, genocide, disease, and natural disasters — a grisly list for sure.
It’s probably true that the world today is plagued with more problems of all 
three types than at any other time in history. We face challenges like never 
before. The world’s “to do” list is enormous and growing. For social entrepre-
neurs, that means take your pick — please! You can start small, focusing on a 
narrow, local issue, and work your way up to bigger and broader goals, build-
ing on your successes. The good news — and the bad news, of course — is 
that there is no shortage of problems around, waiting to be tackled.
What Is Social Entrepreneurship?
Social entrepreneurship and its methods, borrowed from the world of busi-
ness, are becoming more and more popular among morally conscious people 
itching to solve a particular social problem and possibly make money in the 
process. Social entrepreneurs execute innovative solutions to what they 
define as social problems — be they local, regional, national, or international.

10
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
In social entrepreneurship, people use the principles of enterprise — business 
principles and even capitalism itself — to create social change by establish-
ing and managing a venture. Some are altruists. They set up small, medium, 
or large nonprofit groups designed to ameliorate a difficult situation threat-
ening certain people, flora, fauna, or the environment — or sometimes a 
combination of these. Others are profit seekers with a heart, who manage to 
establish a money-making enterprise that improves a situation in one of these 
four areas.
Whether starting and running a nonprofit or for-profit social enterprise, these 
entrepreneurs are usually practical. Each entrepreneur has a mission, typi-
cally one that is powerfully felt with urgency and compassion, and each takes 
concrete action leading to solution of the problem targeted in that mission.
We’ve just described the scope of social entrepreneurship, or what social 
entrepreneurs do. But what is the nature, or essence, of social entrepreneur-
ship? One way to answer that question is to look at its three essential ele-
ments: motivation, organization, and society.
Social entrepreneurship is motivation
Any discussion of social entrepreneurship and its entrepreneurs must 
include why people get involved in it in the first place. Sure, they’re trying to 
solve a pressing problem, one that bothers them and probably other people. 
But look at the desire to be a social entrepreneur in still broader terms.
Some entrepreneurs hope to develop a for-profit social enterprise — they’re 
seeking a livelihood of some sort. It may not be much at first, but they hope it 
brings reasonable success in the long run.
For other entrepreneurs, eventually becoming a for-profit social enterprise 
may be a side effect, even an unexpected one, of their first efforts. And 
some are only interested in working toward building a successful nonprofit 
enterprise.
These possibilities of for-profit and nonprofit organizations raise the ques-
tion of what the entrepreneur gets out of all this, besides solving a problem 
and changing the world as a result of the solution. What is that person’s moti-
vation? Motivation has long-term effects. Why you do something often deter-
mines how and how well you end up doing it.
We discuss this matter of motivation in several ways throughout this book. 
It comes up when we consider the feelings or urgency and compassion that 
inspire social entrepreneurs. It comes up when we explain social entrepre-
neurship as either a special form of leisure (the nonprofit form) or a special 
form of work (the for-profit form). And it comes up when we look at commit-
ment and obligation.

11
 Chapter 1: Social Entrepreneurship: A Calling for You
Social entrepreneurship is organization
A social enterprise is an organization, often one that is legally incorporated 
(see Chapter 14 for more on that). As in all successful organizations, lead-
ers of social enterprises must engage in careful planning, organizing, and 
building their group’s identity. They have to decide on the structure of the 
enterprise, the nature of its constitution, and the elements of its bureaucracy. 
Sooner or later, they have to decide whether to be a for-profit or nonprofit 
entity — a decision that has implications for the organization’s status as a 
tax-deductible charity. The organization needs a mission statement, which 
sets out its vision, and a clear set of goals toward which to work. Those are 
the minimal things that must be done in order to have much of a chance at 
success.
The nature of organizations requires that there be leaders and followers. 
The principles of good leadership apply as much to social enterprises as 
to any other kind of organization. The same may be said for managing the 
people who participate in them. In for-profits, these people, or staff, are paid; 
whereas in nonprofits, they’re either paid or serve as volunteers. Some non-
profits rely on both paid staff and volunteers.
Social entrepreneurship is society
Social entrepreneurship doesn’t take place in a vacuum — far from it. 
Working with others is the whole idea, and not just internally within the orga-
nization itself. As with other organizations, social-enterprise leaders must 
adapt to and take advantage of the organization’s external environment. In 
practice, this means publicizing the enterprise and establishing networks of 
communication and influence with like-minded groups and with private and 
governmental sources of power, all of which can help or hinder the enter-
prise’s goals.
A multitude of large-scale trends currently bear on social entrepreneurship. 
They include the international movement of national populations, decline 
in amount and sources of money, and patterns of communicable disease, 
among others. Trends can subtly or not so subtly influence how your own 
enterprise evolves, and even whether it eventually fails or succeeds.
Note that for-profit social enterprises are, at bottom, capitalistic entities. Their 
leaders must necessarily be familiar with the fundamentals of capitalism, the 
need for innovation, and the need to remain abreast of relevant information 
about and knowledge of the world of business. The biggest difference is that 
whereas normal businesses exist to serve one bottom line — profit — social 
businesses add two more: social and environmental impact. (We discuss the 
three bottom lines at length in Chapter 8.)

Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
Social Entrepreneurship: 
How Do You Get Started?
Don’t get us wrong. We’re not asking you to do the Clark Kent thing and 
transform yourself into a superhero — or become a saint. Not at all. We 
are asking you to free yourself enough, to be deviant enough, to find the 
suffering of others, and the state of our world, objectionable. After you do 
that, what you plan to do about it is up to you. People all over the world are 
claiming this responsibility and inalienable right to address social and other 
problems — a right that comes simply from being a person on this precious 
planet. If you feel like it’s time for you to step up to the plate, then you’ve 
come to the right place. Stepping up starts here. Object to the crummy, mis-
erable things going on. You have that right and responsibility. No one else is 
going to do it for you — or at least, not the way you’d do it. Refusing to rely 
on governments and other organizations to take care of your objection is a 
big part of the decision to become a social entrepreneur.
As a social entrepreneur, you’ll challenge the status quo, to be sure. Some 
people may even object to you, and that’s probably a good sign. The important 
thing is that your journey as a social entrepreneur will have begun. You’re not 
simply bothered about something and leaving it at that. You object. That objec-
tion is a precondition for your commitment to positive change.
But how do you change things? Wow. That’s where the rubber hits the road. 
That’s where, for you, the plot thickens. If your “deviance” takes you to the 
threshold of a strange land, you’ll cross over into that land when you try to 
change things for the better. You won’t be alone, though. We’ll be here with 
you, in this book, at your shoulder.
You may already have an idea of which problem you want to address, 
change, or fix. Coming to grips with how to tackle that problem is basically a 
three-phase process: recognizing and stating your objections to the problem, 
taking action to try to solve the problem, and starting a social enterprise.
Recognizing and stating objections
First, you have to see the problem clearly enough to determine what action 
to try to take. That means finding out everything you can about it. In complex 
problems, such as those motivating the International Red Cross or Ryan’s 
Well Foundation (both profiled later in this chapter), getting a clear view of 
the problem may take considerable research.
You aren’t going to be able to effectively fight against something until you 
have a decent idea of what you’re fighting against. Doing your homework also 

13
 Chapter 1: Social Entrepreneurship: A Calling for You
focuses your sense of urgency and compassion. And it helps you define what 
you object to about the problem. Write down as clearly and completely as 
possible what the problem is and why you feel so passionately about it.
Here’s an example of what we’re talking about.
 
Project Laundry List (www.laundrylist.org) is a nonprofit social enter-
prise incorporated in the United States, with official charitable status. Its mis-
sion is to make hanging out laundry to dry in the open air a respectable and 
environmentally friendly practice in America. Project Laundry List further 
recommends using cold water to wash clothes, which it sees as an easy but 
effective way to save energy.
One of the conditions inciting the founders of Project Laundry List was the 
enactment of local rules that prohibited drying laundry in the open air. 
The arguments for such regulations included the belief that laundry openly 
exposed results in a decline in property values, is unsightly, and is unneces-
sary given the widespread availability of mechanical, indoor clothes dryers.
The local rules opposed by Project Laundry List are mainly community cove-
nants, landlord prohibitions, and zoning laws. Though it operates only in the 
United States, the leaders of this social enterprise also point to the existence 
of similar restrictions in Canada and elsewhere in the world. It’s time, they 
say, to enact “right to dry” legislation. Project Laundry List also operates as 
an advocacy group for this cause. The best dryer of clothes, claims the orga-
nization, is the solar dryer — hanging out clothing in the sun. By the end of 
2009, clothesline legislation had been debated in at least nine states. Project 
Laundry has also established a National Hanging Out Day in both the United 
States and Canada.
How did such an unusual and interesting venture get started? Project Laundry 
List was born when students at Middlebury College in New Hampshire 
reacted to plans by Hydro-Quebec to build some major dams in Canada and 
U.S. plans for expanding use of nuclear power. The students protested by 
hanging political messages on clotheslines.
The following is another fairly typical, hypothetical example of how a social 
enterprise might get its start.
 
Say you’ve noticed that homeless people tend to congregate around the 
entrance to your local library. For everyone, trips to the library involve nego-
tiating some half-dozen panhandling requests and perhaps some closer-than-
comfortable, close-range scrutiny from strangers. You find that you object to 
the fact that these folks have nowhere else to go and nothing else to do. And 
maybe you object to having to interact with strangers who place continual 
demands on passersby, or even see the situation as a safety hazard. Maybe 
you start limiting your trips to the library, and maybe other people do too. 
What can you do about this? Read on for one potential way to address it.

14
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
Taking action
Once your objection is clarified and galvanized by urgency and compassion, 
you then enter phase 2 — making some initial attempts to solve the problem. 
You ask yourself, and probably other people, two questions: What should be 
done, and what can be done?
In practice, answering these questions means first trying to solve the prob-
lem through existing arrangements. It may mean that you, as an objector, 
learn that appropriate governmental, private-sector, or nonprofit organiza-
tions for solving the problem either don’t exist or are inadequate for the job. 
In our hypothetical example, maybe the library says its property is open to 
the public, and perhaps you find that there’s no effective law against panhan-
dling in your town. Moreover, the only homeless shelter nearby has closed, 
and no community center is currently open. Maybe you even ask the home-
less people why they gather there, and they tell you that they were kicked 
out of the park a few blocks away, and there’s nowhere else for them to go.
Trying to solve the problem by taking action through ordinary, existing chan-
nels is an important step. But it’s because of this step that most people both-
ered by a particular problem fail to get beyond objecting to it. One reason for 
doing little other than objecting to the problem is that, often, the objector is 
unable to answer the questions about what should and can be done about it. 
Put another way, objectors may see no action in which they’re both willing 
and able to engage.
In our homeless-at-the-library example, if the library is no help, and neither 
is city hall or the police, and nothing else exists that could easily replace the 
activity, what should be done? Maybe you think there should be a safe place 
for homeless people to get together, but maybe you go further and think 
there should be a way to prevent your fellow community members from 
being homeless in the first place. What can be done about that? If there’s no 
shelter, community center, or job-training program, as a social entrepreneur 
that should set some bells ringing.
Why aren’t there those resources? And you finally realize: You can be the 
one to get them started. At that point, it occurs to you that if you really want 
to fix the problem, you’ll have to organize a more coherent and effective 
approach to solving it. You will, in fact, need to establish a social enterprise. 
The time has come to engage in some social entrepreneurship and move on 
to phase 3. If you succeed, you will have helped the homeless people and 
achieved your goal of taking action to address a perceived problem in your 
community.

15
 Chapter 1: Social Entrepreneurship: A Calling for You
Starting a social enterprise
Social entrepreneurship is, says Muhammad Yunus, winner of the Nobel 
Peace Prize and pioneer of the idea of microcredit, “any innovative initiative 
to help people.” Let’s look at another very simple example to see this defini-
tion in action. As you’ll see, what qualifies as a “social enterprise” can be 
quite informal.
 
A neighbor’s dog spends most days outside, often with no apparent food or 
water. The poor creature barks out of sheer despair and boredom. It’s driv-
ing you nuts — both the animal’s sad, pleading noise and its lonesome lot in 
life. With your objection clarified, you enter the second phase: action. First, 
you speak about the problem with the dog’s owner, but he tells you to get 
lost, that he works all day, that the dog would chew his furniture if he left him 
inside, and that he can’t afford to hire someone to watch the dog. You call 
animal control, but they say they can’t do anything. You even consider moving 
away from the neighborhood, but that’s not a realistic option. Kidnapping the 
dog and letting him loose in the country flicks briefly through your mind, and 
now you’re horrified at yourself. Perhaps there is a municipal bylaw about 
cruelty to animals in your town? But your search reveals that there is nothing 
that applies to this situation. You’re at the end of your rope, right? Wrong. 
You aren’t a hapless, wilting objector — you refuse to let the dog’s problem go 
unsolved. What you need is help. Problems often begin to be solved when you 
reach out to others.
You talk to other neighbors and learn that they’re as irritated with the neigh-
bor as you are. You get organized and hold a meeting to map out some strate-
gies. It turns out that several of you have some free time at least one day a 
week. What if you got together and provided some free doggie day care for 
your community? You have a garage you could convert into a place where 
dogs could congregate. And one of the concerned neighbors knows someone 
on the city council who may be able to provide some funding. She’ll talk to 
this person to see what can be done. Another woman is a lawyer who sug-
gests a bylaw on dog neglect be written and submitted to the city council 
in order to add some leverage to the idea that’s forming. You volunteer to 
write a letter to the editor of the local newspaper, explaining the need for 
this municipal bylaw pertaining to neglected animals — and announcing your 
plan for you and other neighbors to help take care of animals during the day. 
Someone else says he’s starting a local blog on the matter, as a way of sway-
ing public opinion toward enacting the suggested bylaw.
Let’s give this a happy ending: These measures are sufficient to pressure 
the city council member for your district to propose an amendment to the 
municipal noise bylaw pertaining to dogs left alone outside during the day. 
This measure passes. The city council agrees to help offset your costs in 

16
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
converting your garage, and you and the other neighbors work out a sched-
ule whereby one of you is there every weekday to take care of animals whose 
owners work and would otherwise leave their dogs alone.
You may not realize it, but what you’ve done is use social entrepreneurship 
to solve a problem. You didn’t make any money doing it, but maybe that’s the 
next step. Maybe you could begin charging a small fee after you run through 
the city’s stipend. (We talk about earning money from social entrepreneur-
ship throughout this book.)
The Beginnings of Social Enterprises
Why do some people devote huge amounts of time and sometimes personal 
funds to solving a social problem? You could argue that, in the case of for-
profit entrepreneurs, the answer is obvious: They want to make money. But, 
if profit is the motive, keep in mind that nearly all social enterprises are 
substantially risky ventures. If you want to be sure to make even a modest 
amount of money, there are far more secure businesses than ones that try to 
solve social problems, too.
 
Social entrepreneurship becomes necessary when objectors find that appro-
priate governmental, private-sector, or nonprofit organizations for solving the 
problem don’t exist or are inadequate for the job. Objectors discover these 
weaknesses during phase 2, the action phase.
In the illustration about the neglected dog, government help was inad-
equate. The objectors, forced by these circumstances, decided to try the 
entrepreneurial route, or phase 3. It’s this basic impulse that spurs social 
entrepreneurial action. Making money may be a nice bonus, but it’s not what 
motivates social entrepreneurs in the first place.
The homeless and animal-neglect examples were local issues used to illus-
trate typical small-time social entrepreneurial action. Of course, many of the 
opportunities for social entrepreneurship are broader than that and of much 
greater import for humanity.
 
The founding of the Light Up the World Foundation (www.lutw.org) is an 
example. It’s a nonprofit humanitarian organization dedicated to providing 
lighting to poor people in remote areas who currently rely on kerosene lamps 
or even wood fires. In addition to improved nighttime lighting, this utility 
brings physical, educational, and financial benefits.
As you’re probably beginning to see, social entrepreneurship is, in some 
ways, limited only by your imagination and determination. We round out 
this chapter with four more examples of how some of today’s social enter-
prises first sprang into being. These examples show how broad and conse-
quential — and inspiring — social entrepreneurship can be.

The International Red Cross
It wasn’t until the mid-19th century that an attempt was made to develop a 
system for nursing casualties among combatants in war. What existed prior 
to this time were sporadic nursing stations, which were unprotected from 
enemy action. Swiss businessman Jean-Henri Dunant set out to ameliorate 
this situation for men wounded on the battlefield. He was inspired, or more 
accurately, horrified, by the carnage he observed in June 1859 during the 
Battle of Solferino, a particularly ugly part of the Austro-Sardinian War.
Dunant had been on his way to Algeria to tend to his business interests. But 
now he saw that approximately 40,000 soldiers on both sides died in this 
engagement or were left wounded on the field. Yet there was next to no medi-
cal service or even basic care for these men. Dunant abandoned his plans to 
go to Algeria. Instead, he spent several days helping to treat and care for the 
wounded.
Subsequently, Dunant managed to organize a massive system of relief assis-
tance. This he accomplished by persuading local people to aid the wounded 
and to do this for soldiers on both sides. Upon returning to his home in 
Geneva, he wrote A Memory of Solferino, a book he published in 1862 with his 
own money. He sent copies of it to main political and military figures every-
where in Europe. In his book, he argued for the establishment of national vol-
untary relief organizations whose mission would be to help nurse wounded 
soldiers. He also pointed to the need for international treaties that would 
protect neutral medics and establish field hospitals for soldiers wounded in 
battle.
Then, in 1863 in Geneva, Dunant set up the Committee of the Five, which also 
consisted of him and four other leading members of well-known Genevese 
families. The committee’s goal was to study the feasibility of Dunant’s ideas 
and then to hold an international conference to consider the possibility 
of implementing them. To better communicate its mission, the committee 
renamed itself the International Committee for Relief to the Wounded.
The committee submitted resolutions to a diplomatic conference sponsored 
by the Swiss government, to which national governments throughout Europe 
and those of the United States, Mexico, and Brazil were invited. The confer-
ence resulted in the signing of the first Geneva Convention by 12 governments 
and kingdoms. Now, for the first time, legally binding rules would be enforced 
during armed conflict involving neutrality and protection of wounded soldiers, 
field medical personnel, and certain humanitarian institutions.
Soon, the signing countries established their own national societies devoted 
to implementing the Geneva Convention and to using what had become their 
common symbol — a red cross. In 1876, the international body became the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which is the name still used

to this day. Today the ICRC (www.icrc.org) also provides relief assistance 
in response to emergency situations not caused by war, including disasters 
caused by human and natural forces.
Ryan’s Well Foundation
Ryan Hreljac claims he’s just a “regular, average kid.” And he is. And he 
isn’t. When Ryan was a mere 6 years old, he learned from his elementary 
school teacher that people were dying because they didn’t have clean water 
to drink. All it would cost, Ryan figured, was $70 to drill one well that could 
make a huge difference. So Ryan did tons of chores, and soon enough he had 
his money. Unfortunately, he learned that $70 wasn’t nearly enough. He actu-
ally needed about $2,500 to make his dream come true. No problem, Ryan 
declared. He’d just do more chores.
Well, it wasn’t quite that easy, but where there’s an indomitable child’s will 
to do good, it seems people are quick to follow. Soon, with the steadfast sup-
port of his family, friends, neighbors, and folks from afar, Ryan’s Well began. 
Ryan garnered attention for his cause early on, beginning with a friend of the 
family who starting e-mailing her friends about it.
The rest, as they say, is history. Today, at age 18, Ryan is recognized by 
UNICEF as a Global Youth Leader. He has twice been a guest on Oprah and 
has appeared frequently in many other forms of media. More important, of 
course, is the good that Ryan’s vision continues to do. Believing that every 
person on this planet deserves clean water, Ryan’s Well Foundation (www.
ryanswell.ca), founded in 2001, has now contributed to building 461 wells 
in 16 countries, bringing clean water and sanitation services to more than 
600,000 people so far.
My Life My Soul
Ivette Attaud-Jones, a former Army wife, is a survivor of 20 years of domestic 
violence. Sadly, Ivette lost a daughter during this unpleasant period of her 
life. Now Ivette speaks out against this social epidemic to raise awareness. 
She is also the founder of and program director for My Life My Soul, The 
Unspoken Journey of Life after Domestic Abuse, an empowering nonprofit 
support group for women, established as a program of the Church of the 
Resurrection and incorporated in 1970.

19
 Chapter 1: Social Entrepreneurship: A Calling for You
After abused women leave their abusers, what happens? Attaud-Jones 
believes that before turning to the police, they look to faith-based com-
munities. So she established a training program to help those communities 
address domestic violence in their services. She also wrote a book about this 
situation entitled Silent No More.
Ivette is, not surprisingly, deeply committed to women’s justice issues, 
involving herself in many ways. My Life My Soul (www.mylifemysoul.com), 
whose headquarters are in New York, is also committed to raising sensitivity 
to domestic violence through public education and community awareness 
projects.
The Lost Boys and Girls of Sudan
The previous examples — and many more that you’ll encounter in this 
book — document the cases of individual social entrepreneurs. However, 
one of the most fascinating and historically important examples of social 
entrepreneurship involves a large and impressive cohort of young men and 
women, some 15,000 strong. These are the Lost Boys and Girls of Sudan.
They’re refugees and, too often, orphans of the Second Sudanese Civil War — in 
many ways, the precursor to the current round of mass killings in Darfur — 
which claimed more than 2 million lives and displaced an estimated 4 to 5 million 
civilians. As victims of this civil war, almost 26,000 little boys and girls between 
the ages of 4 and 12 years of age fled for their lives, heading east toward a hoped-
for safe haven. But along the way, almost 10,000 of these children died. Only little 
friends were there to bury those lost.
Few Westerners growing up today can imagine the atrocious — let’s say hell-
ish — conditions faced by these children. And yet virtually all the Lost Boys 
and Girls of Sudan share one mission, one purpose, one dream: to keep the 
promise they made as children to the refugee-camp elders and return home 
to take part in the redevelopment of their beloved homeland. That, in itself, is 
a magnificent phase 1 rebuttal of the powers that would eradicate them and 
their people.
From there, the Lost Boys and Girls of Sudan moved into phase 2: collabo-
rating with each other and Westerners and mobilizing their resources in an 
effort to prosper in their new homes, primarily the United States, Australia, 
and Canada. The Chicago Association for the Lost Boys of Sudan (www.lost
boyschicago.com) is a striking case in point.

Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
With a firmer foundation in place, these heroes are now entering phase 3: the 
social entrepreneurial phase. From fundraising to building schools, churches, 
roads, wells, and much more, the Lost Boys and Girls of Sudan are taking 
every opportunity to rebuild Southern Sudan under the tenuously protec-
tive umbrella of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in 2005. The 
Valentino Achak Deng Foundation (www.valentinoachakdeng.org) is 
today one of the better-known examples of these efforts.
Moving Forward with Your 
Ideas and Passion
If you already have one or more social problems in mind to solve through 
social entrepreneurship, the process of expanding and moving forward is 
simple: Read those parts of this book that best fit your needs. But, assuming 
that you’ve read this chapter because you were curious about social entre-
preneurship without having a particular social problem in mind, what’s your 
next step?
 
Well, you should read the rest of this book, or as much as interests you. But 
overall, here’s what you’re going to be doing, in five broad steps, all of which 
are covered in detail in this book:
 
1. Identify a social problem for which you have substantial passion and 
a sense of urgency.
 
 The chapters in Part I address this issue. If you need to further stimu-
late your imagination, turn to Chapter 19 for a list of ten great areas for 
social entrepreneurial action.
 
2. Develop a plan for solving the problem you’ve identified.
 
 Your plan will be rough and preliminary, sure, but you have to start 
somewhere. You may want to consult with someone else as you prepare 
this plan. The idea in general is to put something on paper sufficient to 
show others in an initial meeting.
 
 Chapters 7 through 9 in this book are designed to help you plan. 
Additionally, Chapters 1 through 6 give you different kinds of useful 
background information that can help you sell your ideas to others 
whose assistance you may need, to family and friends whose opinion of 
your project you value, and last, but not least, to yourself.

21
 Chapter 1: Social Entrepreneurship: A Calling for You
 
3. Decide whether to try to solve this problem alone or with the help of 
some other people.
 
 If you’re going to need help, then who might want to help? Whom do you 
know who shares your passion and sense of urgency about the problem? 
Do they have some time to commit to helping you solve it? Will they 
bring some critical expertise to the table? Will they be team players? Are 
they able to work well with others?
 
 Several chapters in this book can help you reach out and lead others, 
including Chapters 4 and 11 and the chapters in Part IV.
 
4. Call a meeting to discuss your preliminary plan.
 
 The idea here is to find sufficient agreement on a more final plan among 
those who want be involved in your evolving social enterprise. In other 
words, your draft plan, initially conceived alone or mostly alone, is your 
starting point in this step. Bear in mind that it may change. It’s possible 
that not everyone will like it. Some may drop out right there because the 
project isn’t what they thought it was going to be. But others will stay 
on longer. It’s among this latter group that you must find agreement on a 
draft of the plan. All this may take a series of meetings.
 
5. Execute your plan.
 
 With your plan and team in hand, you’ve developed a significant con-
sensus among a group of people ready to work with you on setting up 
a social enterprise. Now it’s time take action. At this point, it would be 
good to reread Chapters 7 through 9 in light of the new plan.

B
efore getting into the nuts and bolts of building your social enterprise, 
we want to step back and consider the lay of the land. And by land, we 
mean the social environment in which your social entrepreneurship takes 
place. After all, you’ll be setting up and running your enterprise within the 
surrounding culture, and the more you understand the interaction between 
your enterprise and the attitudes that are all around it, the better you can 
focus and direct your efforts.
But we know, we know. . . . Lots of people, including, no doubt, a few social 
entrepreneurs, despise anything that smacks of “theory.” Why? Well, theory 
is seen by many as over-the-top, abstract, and irrelevant. As one young social 
entrepreneur we know put it recently: “It’s hard for me because, as I have 
commonly seen it, theory has been something that professors in school ask 
you to use in papers, but never truly expect you to apply to everyday situa-
tions, or to really use ever again.”
We understand. We hear it all the time. But think about what Kurt Lewin, the 
pioneering social psychologist once said: “There is nothing so practical as a 
good theory.” Lots of people, for example, try to help chronically homeless 
youth. In our experience, Marilyn Dyck, executive director of The Doorway 
(www.thedoorway.ca), succeeds admirably in doing that. That agency, now 
in its 20th year of operation and boasting a 70 percent success rate, deliv-
ers the goods because she understands and applies many of the theoretical 
strands we discuss in this chapter to almost every aspect of her agency’s 
workflow.

24
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
The stuff we cover in this chapter is meant to be practical, meant to help you 
put your social enterprise in context. The social theorist Charles Lemert once 
said that “Social theory is a survival skill,” precisely because it can orient us 
to the world in useful ways. What we cover in this chapter will enhance the 
survivability of your social enterprise. Theoretical insights can set the bar, 
giving you important information about where you need to go and how you 
can get there. It’s true that the abstractness of theory can make it difficult 
to achieve, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that it’s often still worth 
striving for. We do our best to make this tour as painless as possible.
 
If you ignore all the research and findings that abound with regard to the 
social half of social entrepreneurship, you may find that, before too long, the 
wheels start falling off your wagon. You’ll wonder why your months or years 
of well-intentioned efforts came crashing to the ground. That may be because 
you missed some crucial truth about the way social culture affects social 
enterprises. We invite you to at least browse through this chapter as soon as 
you can. We think it’s that important.
Public Compassion as the 
Groundwork for Success
Social entrepreneurship is often about pulling off a complex and challenging 
social project or program. A big part of the challenge and complexity lies in 
the context of the work, especially the social context regarding the public 
capacity for compassion.
 
Your success rests in part on tapping into the public capacity for compassion — 
and strategically contributing to that capacity.
Like it or not, we’ve entered a new era in human history, one in which tra-
ditional “saintly” compassion has lost its exalted place within the concept 
of “doing good.” That’s not to say that we deny the importance of special 
people. We agree with Margaret Mead’s advice: “Never doubt that a small 
group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. . . .” But we 
might challenge what Mead next went on to say: “Indeed, it is the only thing 
that ever has.”
That may have been true back in the day, but it doesn’t hold as much water 
now. The sheer variety and enormity of the problems that the world is facing 
today demand that compassion become publicly participatory — in other 
words, today’s problems are so widespread and pervasive that they require 
public participation in their solutions.

25
 Chapter 2: Building Public Compassion
What compassion is
Most people have a pretty good sense of what compassion means. But just to 
set the record a little straighter, for the purposes of this book we define com-
passion as follows:
 
Compassion is a deep awareness of and feeling for another’s suffering, com-
bined with an active, engaged desire to alleviate it. Compassion is about more 
than acknowledgment — it’s about action.
Compassion begins with a generous promise made from one party to 
another. The promise is generally that the caring party will be there for the 
care recipients.
Compassionate engagement can be as large as Al Gore’s attempts to promote 
global climate-change policy and innovations. It can be a nation’s apology 
and assurance of assistance to its wronged indigenous peoples. Or it can be 
as small as helping an elderly person in the last stages of Alzheimer’s — rub-
bing her back, holding her hand, or stroking her hair, just to let her know that 
someone is close by.
Note that immediate success or failure is not part of the compassion equa-
tion. You can be compassionate and fall short in your bid to help others 
(although we hope you don’t, and that’s why we’re here). The deep desire to 
do something truly positive for others and the promise and willingness to get 
out into the world and actually do just that are what compassion is about. 
Compassion tests character and integrity — but it also builds them up.
Why compassion is everybody’s responsibility
We believe it’s time to move beyond the traditional dependence on the iso-
lated efforts of saintly folk. And in many ways, as a society, we’ve begun that 
process — one of the great accomplishments of our times has been to insist 
that receiving compassion, in the face of violating and unwarranted suffer-
ing, is everyone’s birthright, and that such a right should be institutionalized 
and formalized (as in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights). As a 
result, vast international cooperatives like the United Nations, mammoth gov-
ernmental bureaucracies, and many professions have tried to marshal their 
resources in order to guarantee that birthright.

26
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
But two things have happened with that goal:
 
✓ We, the public, have become dependent on these institutional 
responses, which has made us complacent about divesting ourselves 
of our own compassionate responsibilities.
 
✓ We’re now regretting that complacency as we realize that those same 
institutional responses are proving, for any number of reasons, to be 
quite limited in terms of what they can achieve.
There’s a serious incongruity to all of this. In its saintly version, delivering 
compassion was reserved for only the most reverent and dutiful. Today, com-
passion is often “ghettoized” into enclaves, and the public, which should be 
the linchpin of the whole process, is still not seriously involved.
The result has been a move away from public compassion, not toward it. With 
these developments, grassroots movements face enormous challenges in 
energizing themselves for compassion. But beyond that, every corner of soci-
ety must begin to contribute to an ongoing productive social dialogue on the 
practice of compassion.
 
You, the social entrepreneur, are one of the most important keys to invigorat-
ing grassroots action and enabling dialogue on the widest possible scale. Lead 
the way! If enough people do so, policymakers will be forced to pay attention 
and lend a hand.
How social entrepreneurs fit in
If you’re the social entrepreneurial type, don’t think of yourself as just 
another “subcontractor” in the ghettoizing of compassion. Instead, you’re 
more like the organizer and catalyst of a unifying, synergistic, and creative 
public compassion. We can’t overstate your importance.
 
As a social entrepreneur, you must always pursue two interlocking goals:
 
✓ Succeed at your social enterprise. This goal is first and foremost, of 
course.
 
✓ Get others to share your compassion. A secondary goal is to advance, 
directly or indirectly, everyone else’s capacity for compassion.
 
Achieving that second goal is more than the right thing to do — it actually 
helps you reach the first goal. Practically speaking, you need the broad-based 
support and resources of a compassionate public if you’re going to sustain 
and succeed in your efforts.

27
 Chapter 2: Building Public Compassion
A brief history of social compassion
Almost 400 years ago, philosopher Thomas 
Hobbes claimed that man’s life is filled with 
“continual fear and danger of violent death.” 
Famously, he described human existence as 
“solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” There 
continues to be some truth to this. Nevertheless, 
the historical record also shows that humans, 
and even their predecessors, have always been 
compassionate. Simple, brutish self-interest is 
not the whole story here.
Archaeologist Terisa Green relates the story of 
a Homo erectus woman identified as KNM-ER 
1808. Apparently, this individual suffered and 
died from lesions and growths on her limbs. 
The condition was probably caused by vitamin 
A overdosing — the result of eating the livers of 
carnivores. Green notes that the condition leads 
to nausea, dizziness, and cramps, followed 
slowly by bone swelling and great pain. Poor 
KNM-ER 1808 wouldn’t have been able to care 
for herself. Yet, despite her advanced condition, 
she still survived to a relatively advanced age 
and quite a distance away from water, where 
the carnivores would have hung out. How? She 
had to have had at least one caregiver. We’re 
talking between 1 and 2 million years ago.
Then there’s the case of “Nandy” the 
Neanderthal. The Neanderthals never had it 
easy. As hunters of large, fierce game, they 
led dangerous lives and suffered the traumatic 
injuries to prove it. Nandy had it doubly hard. 
He was born with a useless right arm, which 
was amputated below the elbow, and was 
likely blind in one eye (he suffered an earlier 
nasty blow to the head), so it’s hard to imagine 
how he would have been able to fend for him-
self. Nevertheless, Nandy lived to be a ripe old 
40-something, which in today’s terms would 
be like pushing 80. How was that possible? 
Archeologists believe that Nandy must have 
been accepted and supported by his people up 
to the day he died from a rock fall in the com-
munal cave. The discovery of Nandy radically 
changed our appreciation of the complexity of 
Neanderthal social behavior.
Then there are the examples from well-loved 
sacred texts. Judaism promotes the concept 
of tikun olam, or “repairing the world,” and the 
Torah conveys God’s commandment to “be 
kind to the stranger in your midst for you were 
strangers in the land of Egypt.” Christianity has 
the story of the Good Samaritan. Islam has the 
prophet inquiring about the well-being of one 
who had tormented him daily. Buddhism has 
Prince Siddhartha Gautama teaching a simple 
truth: “A generous heart, kind speech, and a life 
of service and compassion are the things which 
renew humanity.”
What are the historical lessons here for the 
social entrepreneur? One is to take heart, 
knowing that you’re carrying on one of human-
ity’s noblest traditions. Another is to realize that 
voluntarily taking on the mantle of compassion 
can be fulfilling in its own right. Cynics point to 
the shackle of obligation created by compas-
sion, but compassion is voluntary. You don’t 
have to fear that the “real you” will be swal-
lowed whole and vanish. The real you has 
already willingly embraced compassion, and 
compassion brings out the best in all of us.
You also have to broaden your own compassion beyond your pet 
issues. Social entrepreneurs can’t help but compete as they pursue 
scarce resources, but it would be a contradiction if someone claim-
ing to promote compassion cared about only one particular cause. 
That doesn’t wash — compassion isn’t narrow.

Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
Breaking Down Exclusionary 
Social Distance
Some people practice compassion all right — but only for people they believe 
are like them. They don’t mind helping out someone from their hometown, 
say, who shares their ethnicity and goes to their church. But others — those 
who are “different” — are on their own. This tendency is called exclusionary 
social distance, or just social distance for short. We’re talking about the very 
old habit of circling the wagons against outsiders.
Understanding the reality of social distance
For you as a social entrepreneur to exercise compassion, you may well need 
to breach or violate the reality of exclusionary social distance. The Good 
Samaritan, after all, crossed the road in order to help someone who wasn’t 
his “kind.”
Social distance operates vividly everywhere you look. As of this writing, the 
world is in a protracted economic crisis, the likes of which haven’t been seen 
since the early part of the 20th century. In Europe and elsewhere, masses of 
people have marched in the streets, outraged at the greed and lack of moral 
compass demonstrated by modern financial elites and governments. We 
heard of bailouts, stimulus packages, and big bonuses for upper-echelon jobs 
poorly done. Along with that came job losses for millions. Is this the world 
we want our children to inherit, many ask, in which the rich get richer and 
the poor get table scraps, misery, and shorter lives?
The problem of social distance and a related phenomenon called the politics 
of exclusion (the systematic sidelining or elimination of certain groups or 
points of view) continue to define and divide social life. Back in the 1930s, 
the American sociologist Emory Bogardus showed that it was a culture’s 
promotion of social distance — not twisted, individual psychologies — that 
lay behind widespread prejudice, discrimination, and racism. Since then, 
hundreds of studies have shown that social distance is firmly fixed in the way 
people live, from the way people tip in restaurants (with minority servers 
earning smaller gratuities) all the way up to “old boy” networks and interna-
tional relations.
To put it mildly, many refuse to “get it.” Why? It may be as simple as the fact 
that they have a vested interest in not getting it. Certainly, once upon a time, 
stockpiling scarce resources for family, kin, and tribe against the marauding 
hordes just over the mountains or across the water made sense. From there, 
it may have been just a short hop to the creation of social hierarchies, strati-
fication, and structured inequality — all of which, over time, came to seem 
both natural and real. Old habits do die hard.

29
 Chapter 2: Building Public Compassion
Tearing down social distance 
through social entrepreneurship
Some signs of hope do exist. More and more people, especially younger 
people, are finding social distance less attractive. And regardless of your 
political leanings, it’s hard to deny the notion that the election of Barack 
Obama was part of an attempt on the part of the American people to break 
down the barriers of social distance, both within the United States and 
between the United States and the rest of the world.
We believe that, given the amplified problems of today, exclusionary social 
distance may have run its course. As a social entrepreneur, you get to be on 
the vanguard of helping it along toward its demise.
Start decreasing social distance by thinking and acting inclusively. By that we 
mean including more and more kinds of people in your endeavors, of course, 
but also keeping social distance in mind and including it in your calculations 
about where and how to focus your efforts.
 
In the following list, we take a look at a few people who are committed to bat-
tling social distance:
 
✓ James Nachtwey is one of the greatest war and social-conflict photo-
journalists of our time, having worked in more than 30 countries. He 
says that he is privy to “unmitigated pain, injustice, and misery.” Why, 
then, does he do what he does? Because, he says, he wants to “shake” 
people out of their indifference — in other words, out of their exclu-
sionary social distance. That is the function of a war photographer, as 
Nachtwey sees it — to allow people to “be there just once to see for 
themselves what white phosphorus does to the face of a child, or what 
unspeakable pain is cause by a single bullet, or how a jagged piece of 
shrapnel can rip someone’s leg off.”
 
✓ Brian Steidle served as an unarmed military observer in Darfur before 
his photographs of the atrocities there broke the story open, in The New 
York Times, to the United States and the world. Ryan Spencer Reed has 
powerfully documented the genocidal civil wars and tremendous suf-
fering in both southern Sudan and Darfur. Ryan notes that “images are 
powerful statements by witnesses who were present as these events 
unfolded. . . . Yet an image becomes powerful only after it is given an 
audience.”
 
✓ Internationally known video-journalist and social entrepreneur Rick 
Castiglione left a lucrative career as a broadcast journalist to found 
Cielo Pictures. His passion is to tell stories about prospering social 
entrepreneurs. One of his most important messages is that social entre-
preneurs should model social inclusiveness to the rest of the world. 
When Castiglione is invited to speak publicly, he makes a point of chal-
lenging his audience. “If there were 100 people living next to you, or just 

30
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
down the street, in extremely dire circumstances, would you help them 
out?” His audiences always reply yes, of course. “Well,” he replies, “Most 
of those in dire need are only about 10 to 20 hours away. You’d drive 
that to visit your relatives and friends, right? Why not make an equiva-
lent trip to help the two-thirds of the world who have so little and who 
are also your neighbors?”
 
✓ Dr. Gopa Kothari is a Mumbai baby doctor who has devoted her life to 
bettering the lives of India’s poorest and most unfortunate. The caste 
system in India has to be one of the most extreme examples of social 
distance in the world. But being born into the high Hindu Brahman 
caste has not kept Dr. Kothari from working to dismantle negative social 
distance against seemingly insurmountable odds. In 1982, Dr. Kothari 
founded the Child Eye Care Charitable Trust, which brings family health, 
nutrition, treatment, and education programs to India’s urban and rural 
poor. As a result of Kothari’s efforts, 68,000 children have been pro-
tected from preventable blindness, more than 1.3 million women have 
received health education to protect their children, and more than 5,000 
Indian children have received informal school education. Dr. Kothari is a 
perfect example of what fighting social distance can do.
 
✓ In 1998, 6-year-old Ryan Hreljac was appalled and saddened when he 
learned in school that many African children had to walk great distances 
every day just to get water, and that the water they fetched wasn’t even 
fit for drinking. In fact, the water was the cause of tremendous suffer-
ing. It brought numerous illnesses, blindness, and death to many, many 
Africans. Ryan decided to build a well for a village in Africa. By earning 
enough money doing household chores and doing some public speaking 
on clean-water issues, Ryan’s first well was built in 1999 at the Angolo 
Primary School in a northern Ugandan village.
 
 Now a young man, Ryan has torn down the idea of the so-called “distant” 
needy. Ryan’s Well Foundation has helped dig a total of 502 wells in 16 
developing countries and brought clean-water services to more than 
600,000 people.
 
 The work of the foundation continues to inspire young and old every-
where. As Ryan puts it: “Youth today want to be more involved in 
society. . . . [They] are working to support positive change in their com-
munities and in the world. Adults now recognize that kids and teenagers 
can and do add value. And young people recognize that they will benefit 
from the advice and support of the world’s leaders and change makers.”

 Chapter 2: Building Public Compassion
Attachment: Emotional Bonds 
and Public Compassion
There is a flip side to exclusionary distance. The fact is that exclusion runs 
counter to one of the most basic human tendencies: our deep-rooted need 
and desire to attach to each other. As a social entrepreneur, you can use 
attachment as a powerful tool in your enterprise.
The emergence of attachment theory
Harry Harlow, the controversial American psychologist, tested the biblical 
aphorism “Man does not live by bread alone” on infant rhesus monkeys. 
What Harlow did was separate the babies from their mothers 6 to 12 hours 
after birth. He then reared them in the company of two types of artificial 
replacement or surrogate mothers — one of which was made of wire, and the 
other of soft terry cloth. The monkeys in the experiment preferred the soft 
terry-cloth mother, even if only the wire mother provided milk.
The experiment showed that the monkeys needed what he called contact 
comfort, even at the expense of nutrition. And so do humans, of course. 
Seeking out and satisfying a need for contact comfort is essential to primate 
survival. Beyond that, contact comfort is vital to establishing thriving, prop-
erly functioning, fully integrated members of families and communities.
The incredibly important lesson in this was not lost on John Bowlby, Mary 
Ainsworth, and many other eminent scholars who have gone on to develop 
and refine what they call attachment theory. From cradle to grave, humans 
need attachments — the emotional bonds that have their origins in contact 
comfort. From the infant’s cries to the dying person’s desire for loved ones to 
gather ’round, attachments are the heartstrings that link our lives together.
When attachments don’t form properly
The importance and value of early, successful emotional bonds simply can’t 
be exaggerated. These bonds are central to a child’s emotional, cognitive, 
and behavioral development. Emotionally, attachments are the basis of posi-
tive and respectful close adult relations, including those that become the 
foundation of the intimate partnerships that later lead to a new generation of 
parent-child relations.
Cognitively, successful attachments are closely linked to developing the con-
fidence needed to engage, creatively explore, gain knowledge from, and inno-
vatively adapt to the world. In fact, the desire and ability to push limits often 

32
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
arises out of knowing that there is a fallback position — the safe haven of a 
secure base — to retreat to if needed before striking out again. Behaviorally, 
impaired attachments put trust at risk. When that happens, participation in 
the family unit and in communities of all sizes is compromised.
 
Because the effects of infant attachments are so far-reaching, they’re neces-
sary to individual and collective social functioning and to the ultimate health 
of every society. This claim is corroborated by a massive amount of clinical 
and observational literature. In fact, the cross-cultural and international study 
of human attachments is by now, after 50 years of inquiry, so widespread that 
a child’s universal primordial needs for parental or caregiver love and protec-
tion, known as affectional bonds, are now globally recognized.
Suffice it to say that children who are deprived of secure bases or who grow 
up feeling unsure about the integrity of the affectional bonds with caregiv-
ers end up exhibiting very important deficits. These deficits make it much 
harder for them to establish positive, mutually supportive, and long-lasting 
relationships with others. And these deficits have immense implications for a 
person’s health, social behavior, and participation in organizational and com-
munity life.
Applying attachment theory 
to social entrepreneurship
So, what does all this information on attachments have to do with social 
entrepreneurship? When something goes wrong with attachments, it usually 
leads to trouble for the individual, and that often ends up meaning trouble 
for society. Many social ills are either rooted in attachment difficulties or are 
often unaddressed because of attachment difficulties. On the other hand, as 
you foster or work with individuals who are well attached, you’ll find that 
those individuals are more likely to help you push social limits in a positive 
and confident manner.
This leads to the important idea of a politics of attachment, a blend of poli-
tics, psychology, social sciences, and moral philosophy. In this arena, social 
entrepreneurs and others are applying attachment theory to communities 
in need and promoting much more satisfying fixes between individuals and 
their societies.
 
In his wide-ranging New York Times bestseller, Social Intelligence, Daniel 
Goleman discusses human attachments in great detail and draws connec-
tions from the theory to everyday life for business people, parents, educators, 
health professionals, and community leaders. Check out this book to further 
your understanding of social intelligence.

 Chapter 2: Building Public Compassion
 
Andrea Pound, in an article titled “Hope in the Inner-city: Towards a New 
Deal,” looks at three broad groups of children living in urban centers. The 
three groups are the children of depressed mothers, children whose parents 
have divorced, and children living in poverty. Pound describes a number of 
parent support schemes that have grown out of attachment research. These 
schemes are successful enough that they should be informing policy and help-
ing to prevent the accelerating cycle of disadvantage for society’s children 
and youth.
 
If such children are your target, we highly recommend exploring Pound’s 
article for ideas. You can find it as Chapter 4 in The Politics of Attachment: 
Towards a Secure Society, edited by Sebastian Kraemer and Jane Roberts (Free 
Association Books).
The sociologist Ray Pahl notes that the simple idea of friendship is an expres-
sion of community that, in turn, is deeply rooted in attachments. Pahl pro-
poses that putting friendships on the political agenda would presumably lead 
to something sorely needed: greater social cohesion. Friendships and other 
attachments serve as a life-sustaining remedy to the absolute dominance of 
states over individuals. Whereas state and other kinds of bureaucracies tend 
to strip people of social capital — the connections within and between social 
networks — friendships and attachments do just the opposite.
 
  Some visionary philanthropists believe so strongly in attachment theory that 
they put their money where their mouths are. Case in point: The very much 
theory-based FHL Foundation of New Mexico explicitly promotes “attachment 
theory as a guiding principle toward understanding and solving societal prob-
lems.” Named for Frederick H. Leonhardt, an organic chemist and former pres-
ident and chairman of the board of Fritzsche Brothers (purveyors of essential 
oils, flavors, and fragrances), the foundation extends the Fritzsche Brothers’ 
original corporate philosophy: Ensure that technological advances support 
people’s striving for home and belongingness. Today, the foundation works to 
alter the basic ways in which Western societies tend to function. It wants to 
see sweeping changes in our current social arrangements and institutions so 
that human attachments can acquire the safety, security, and nurturing they 
need and deserve. The foundation’s funding activities cover everything from 
infant and child development research and programs to youth transition pro-
grams, from community art initiatives to the YWCA to Habitat for Humanity. 
You can visit the FHL Foundation online at http://128.121.62.12.
Some organizations choose their targets based on what will grab and yank at 
folks’ heartstrings — and human attachments certainly qualify in that regard. 
Hence, attachment issues are quite marketable. But as we argue through the 
rest of this chapter, as a social entrepreneur you need to draw on more than 
heartstrings to really make a difference.

Supercharging Public Compassion: 
The Secret’s in the Culture
As you know by now, forming healthy attachments is essential to lessening 
social distance and ultimately building more successful social relationships 
and communities. But despite the fact that we’re driven to form attachments 
from the very beginnings of our lives, attachments still don’t happen auto-
matically. What we know from studying feral children and children who have 
faced prolonged social isolation confirms that attachments need the right 
kinds of social and cultural contexts to survive and flourish. It turns out it 
really does take a certain kind of village to raise a well-attached child. And 
when villages are culturally flying apart at the seams, children — and future 
generations — are in trouble.
Why culture matters
So, enshrining the practice of forming and sustaining attachments within 
families or neighborhoods and communities doesn’t just happen. It only hap-
pens through the trigger of culture. In other words, without the nourishing 
water of an appropriate cultural context, the full potential of attachments 
only wither and die on the vine.
 
Although ballet, professional wrestling, and stamp collecting are technically 
examples of culture, generally speaking we talk about culture in the broader 
anthropological sense. By culture we mean the things people in communities 
do and feel and think — the ways of living that are socially shared, transmit-
ted, and learned by members of communities.
If all this seems obvious to you, that’s fantastic! But in our experience, not 
nearly enough people, including social entrepreneurs, fully appreciate the 
power of culture. Beyond the link to healthy attachments, culture can be 
reshaped, sometimes in a hurry, to produce rapid and breath-taking shifts in 
historical direction. This quality is something that every social entrepreneur 
should be trying to tap into. More than anything else, how you “do culture” 
can make or break you.
“Doing” culture
How do you “do” culture? The first principle is that you take advantage of 
humans’ innate ability to imitate and learn from others by imaginatively put-
ting themselves in other people’s shoes — something called role taking. 
Even very young children can do this. They can empathetically infer the 

35
 Chapter 2: Building Public Compassion
intentions behind the actions and words of others. With that, they can imi-
tate in uncanny ways. So, be a good role model! People are always watching 
and learning from you.
Next, be explicit — but not heavy handed — in your socialization toward 
others. Socialization simply means teaching or conveying to others what is 
socially expected. Given our innate propensity to imitate, the job of learning 
social norms is already half done by genetics. All you need to do is learn how 
to help imitative learning along, avoiding punitive sanctions as much as pos-
sible while encouraging successful role taking with appropriate rewards.
If you’re wondering what such socialization might look like, it could involve a 
creative combination of leadership (see Chapter 17) and leisure (see Chapter 
3). Walk ahead. But if you take the time to stop and invite others to join you 
on a journey worth sharing, you may find that they’ll do more than simply 
follow — they’ll race to catch up and walk at your shoulder.
 
How do you ensure that your journey is invitational? This is where leisure — 
especially serious, project-based leisure — comes in. Consider, for example, 
the fact that much of what nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) do with 
their supporters involves leisure principles and practices. Sure, there are the 
usual fundraising galas. But there’s much more, and the possibilities are really 
mushrooming. Some NGOs take their supporters spelunking or rappelling 
down the side of an office building, on weeklong retreats, on excursions to 
build affordable housing, and so on. You’re limited only by your imagination!
 
It’s in your efforts toward cultural and social change that the hidden compas-
sionate potential of humanity can be unlocked. As a social entrepreneur, the 
key to spreading the truths of attachments and healthy societies, inclusivity, 
and compassion lies in your ability, as a social change agent, to shape culture.
 
Jeroo Billimoria, founder of Childline, India’s phone emergency outreach ser-
vice for children in need of care and protection, has repeatedly used culture 
and socialization to advance awareness. For example, when it became evident 
that police, health, and other officials in communities were doing little to 
assist Childline efforts, despite administrative promises of support, Billimoria 
went on the cultural offensive.
Childline designed a series of training workshops for frontline workers at 
police stations, hospitals, schools, and train stations. The workshops were 
designed to encourage a more sympathetic response to the plight of children 
in distress. During training, children were brought in to tell their moving 
personal stories — which brought out the role-taking abilities of the work-
ers. Childline further developed the role taking through role-playing with 
the youngsters. Discussion about children’s rights under Indian law, which 
strengthened the idea of social norms, followed. Finally, after some 700 train-
ing sessions dramatically transformed these public sites into safe havens 

36
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
for India’s troubled children, awards were presented to those deemed most 
“child friendly.” See? Cultural change isn’t easy, but it can be done and it can 
bring impressive results in relatively short periods of time.
The ever-changing forms of culture have to do with agreed-upon conventions, 
socialization processes, and empathetic and imitative learning. Culture is 
incredibly plastic and open to change. This turn-on-a-dime quality is useful 
to social change agents like you. For example, a decade ago, who was talking 
about sustainability? No one, really, except a few intellectuals. Nowadays, 
sustainability is all the buzz. That’s another example of changing culture.
 
The point here is that social entrepreneurs like you should be first in line to 
identify and shape those aspects of culture that influence attachments. Social 
and traditional media, for example, are practically tailor made to do this. 
(Chapter 11 includes discussion on using social media, and Chapter 12 is all 
about using the media to advance your goals.)
Spreading Public Compassion: 
The Clarity of Social Insight
Having promoted the notion of culture as a tool you need to use, we’d like 
to qualify that a little bit: You can almost always take culture — and for our 
purposes we mean culture promoting attachment, inclusion, and public com-
passion — to a higher level. As a matter of principle that’s consistent with 
compassion, try to be more effective and more efficient in your attempts to 
keep your generous promises and make a positive difference in the world, 
even though you may still fall short in the attempt. This area is where the 
considerable muscle of human intelligence comes into play.
Discovering social insight
Consider the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: “True compassion is more 
than flinging a coin to a beggar; it comes to see that an edifice which pro-
duces beggars needs restructuring.” In other words, culture may teach you 
that certain actions, such as flinging a coin to a beggar, are compassionate. 
But if you use intelligence to think critically about these things, you may 
develop the social insight to realize that, in flinging the coin, you may be help-
ing to pay for lunch but you’re also perpetuating social problems and not 
dealing with the real and often hidden issues.

37
 Chapter 2: Building Public Compassion
The Dr. King quote challenges you to think your compassion through and be 
more fully generous by understanding that you must consider the realities 
of social institutions and social structures in your compassionate response. 
Because this kind of thinking and practice is rarely straightforward — typi-
cally involving social research and analysis — resource costs are involved. 
Even more frustrating, the need for social insight often comes at a time when 
people need your help immediately — and the last thing you want is to get 
caught up in “analysis paralysis.”
Still, we caution you not to scrimp on achieving social insight. Doing so will 
only come back to haunt you because your understanding of the situation 
won’t fit or work as well as it could — and you could end up wasting people’s 
time or even hurting them. Ignoring social insight produces only irrelevant or 
contradictory efforts. Communicating for social change (see Chapter 3), how-
ever, helps enormously in developing social insight because, done properly, 
it puts your finger on the pulse of people’s real-life experiences. That focus 
provides your organization with a powerful value proposition, and knowing 
what the real problems are enables you to set out to fix things.
Seeing social insight in 
action (and inaction)
 
A classic example of what happens when good intentions lack social insight 
comes from Lake Victoria, Africa’s largest lake and the third largest lake in the 
world. Back in the 1950s, British colonial officers thought it would be a good 
idea to stock the lake with Nile perch. These predatory perch multiplied dra-
matically and killed off many indigenous species in the lake.
The increasing numbers of perch encouraged the development of a large 
commercial-fishing industry for Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya, the countries 
bordering the lake. In fact, this industry eventually grew to encompass 35 
fish-processing plants to meet the growing demands of local and European 
Union markets. Somewhere along the way, as at least a partial reaction to 
these market dynamics, the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organisation (LVFO) was 
formed in 1994 in order to manage Victoria’s fish stock.
But that wasn’t good enough. Planners and officials didn’t fully grasp the 
demand for the perch and the rising numbers of Lake Victoria fishermen who 
would rush to supply that demand. So, the numbers of boats on the lake shot 
up, and uncontrolled fishing, often with illegal gear, was soon rampant. Is this 
fiasco an unintended consequence as well? Not at all. We argue that critical 
social insight was missing.

38
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
Today, Lake Victoria’s fish stocks are seriously depleted. Ten factories have 
closed, and the remaining 25 are operating at between 30 percent and 50 
percent capacities. With rising freight charges and fuel costs, and the open-
ing of new export markets in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Central 
Africa Republic, and Southern Sudan, even the price of perch fish heads is 
now beyond the reach of most locals. The livelihoods of some 40 million East 
Africans are threatened. Tensions and conflicts are growing. These develop-
ments could have been predicted and, perhaps, avoided.
 
A compelling, positive example of the importance of working with culture and 
doing so in a socially insightful way can be found in Jürgen Griesbeck’s social 
entrepreneurial efforts. Griesbeck was called to change the world for the better 
in 1994, when his good friend, Andres Escobar, a Colombian national soccer 
player, was murdered. Escobar had accidentally scored on his own goal in a 
World Cup first round loss to the United States and, with that loss, his team 
was eliminated from the tournament. Many Colombians, including gambling 
syndicates that had bet large amounts of money on Colombia to qualify for the 
second round, blamed Andres for the team’s quick exit from play. On arriving 
back home in the city of Medellín, Escobar was shot 12 times outside of a bar.
Medellín is known as a violent, crime-plagued city. Griesbeck knew that he 
couldn’t take on the whole crime establishment, but he also recognized that 
a big part of the problem behind Escobar’s death was the general culture 
of sport surrounding soccer. This, he thought, he might be able to change. 
Griesbeck started Football for Peace, a soccer program that emphasized 
breaking down gender barriers, promoting fair and nonviolent play, and keep-
ing children out of gangs. With 10,000 children involved and local leaders 
trained to continue the program, Griesbeck eventually moved on to spread 
his version of soccer culture worldwide, using it to battle social exclusive-
ness, xenophobia, and racism.
Griesbeck realized that children’s positive experiences playing soccer 
around the world were not being shared and celebrated across ethnic and 
geographic boundaries. He created Streetfootballworld (www.streefoot
ballworld.com), a Web-based platform for spreading the good news of 
kids’ participation in soccer around the worldToday, Streetfootballworld 
has achieved a cultural coup. It is now partnered with FIFA — a French acro-
nym for International Federation of Football Association, which organizes 
the World Cup. FIFA’s corporate social responsibility strategy now focuses 
explicitly on social development. In many ways, Jürgen Griesbeck has man-
aged to transform the cultural institution of soccer at the highest levels and 
on a global scale, demonstrating remarkable social insight. Andres Escobar, 
still known as “The Immortal Number 2” and “The Gentleman of Football,” 
would certainly be proud of his good friend’s efforts.
 
There are many other examples of social entrepreneurs who have used social 
insight to great advantage, but we’d like to mention just one more: Mahatma 
Gandhi. Gandhi was the trailblazing architect of satyagraha (resistance to tyr-
anny through mass civil and nonviolent disobedience).

39
 Chapter 2: Building Public Compassion
Gandhi thought long and hard about the nature and dynamics of Britain’s 
institutionalized colonial oppression of India’s people. He determined 
that Britain could justify its treatment of Indians only on the basis of a 
Eurocentric, elitist, objectifying, and socially distanced conception of 
the Indian population. To the British, the Indians were uncivilized, lesser 
humans. This cultural lens justified British rule by force.
Gandhi’s nonviolent methods were designed not simply to protest British 
rule but also to resist it through non-cooperation that was carried out from 
the highest moral ground of nonviolent love and compassion. This meant 
that when British authorities physically beat protesting — but completely 
nonviolent — Indians, they betrayed their own high cultural self-esteem. In an 
earlier campaign in South Africa, which Gandhi had used to experiment with 
his initial ideas on nonviolence, Jan Smuts, then South Africa’s interior minis-
ter, summed up the power of Gandhi’s approach when he privately admitted 
to Gandhi: “You reduce me to helplessness. How can we lay hands on you 
without looking like villains?”
Developing your own social insight
Social insight is definitely out-of-the-box thinking. It’s innovative and creative 
and difficult to do properly. It does, however, relate directly to what it means 
to be “entrepreneurial” and it does model leadership, subjects we consider in 
later chapters.
 
Where does social insight come from? It’s not crystal ball magic. It’s the rea-
soned ability to connect the dots from specific facts on the ground — what’s 
happening to real people — to the social realities they’re caught up in as cul-
tural members of a complex number of groups embedded in institutional reali-
ties. In a nutshell, you start by answering these basic questions:
 
✓ Who’s doing what to whom, when, and where?
 
✓ How and why are these things happening?
By the time you get to the why, you’ll have achieved a bird’s-eye or big-pic-
ture understanding — which is, trust us, far too rare.
 
You need to work toward achieving social insight. If you fail to truly consider 
the why of social problems, you’ll be stuck in providing band-aid solutions and 
handouts when hand-up interventions are what people need. Without social 
insight, you’re relegated to just doing charity work — treading water.
 
Fostering social insight decreases social distance and increases social inclu-
sion by improving your appreciation of what others are going through. It also 
enhances your ability to make the most appropriate plans and take the most 
appropriate actions in the name of compassion. As such, you can think of it as 
the capstone test for compassion.

Motivation and the Volunteer Spirit
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering the elements of motivation for social entrepreneurs
▶ Seeing social entrepreneurship as serious leisure
▶ Finding rewards and costs in serious leisure
▶ Working as a devotee in for-profit entrepreneurship
▶ Becoming a social entrepreneurial volunteer
K
nowing what motivates social entrepreneurs and volunteers can pay 
untold dividends down the road. If you’re reading this book, you’re 
probably already motivated to some extent by the passion you have for 
your chosen issue or project. But to actually put your passion into prac-
tice requires a lot more than a desire to fix something. To begin with, other 
people you may hire or work with may have different motivations, along with 
different ideas about what they’re willing to do. Getting a handle on the kinds 
of motivation in the social enterprise is key to your success.
In this chapter, we go over many of the elements of motivation and the will 
to volunteer. Here you find information that can help you understand what it 
takes to succeed in social entrepreneurship. Some questions we consider are
 
✓ What impels people to take on the different roles that make up a social 
enterprise?
 
✓ What makes some people want to devote their lives to it, and others to 
devote a few leisure hours per week to it?
 
✓ How can you use knowledge about the different types and levels of moti-
vation to maximize success in your social enterprise?
What Motivates Social Entrepreneurs?
Would-be social entrepreneurs have a vision of what the world would be like 
if they succeeded in effecting the change they want. That vision drives them 

42
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
onward to see that change put in place. In this sense, it’s simple: They want 
to solve the problem that’s bothering them and help their target of benefits 
get what is currently lacking. (The target of benefits is the group or cause 
you’re trying to serve — we discuss this concept in detail in Chapter 7.)
But that’s not the end of the story. Social entrepreneurs also have a very 
human desire for something interesting and fulfilling to do in their free and/
or work time. Social entrepreneurs may be driven by one or more of the fol-
lowing motives:
 
✓ Altruism
 
✓ Community engagement
 
✓ Generosity
 
✓ Compassion/sympathy
 
✓ Leisure
 
✓ Volunteerism
The first three motives in this list invariably inspire social entrepreneurs. 
The fourth — compassion/sympathy — although exceedingly common, is 
not a universal motive in the world of entrepreneurship. We cover these four 
motives in this section. The final two — leisure and volunteerism — are com-
plex; we cover those motivations later in this chapter.
Altruism
Altruism is the selfless pursuit of the well-being and interests of others.
 
Altruism in the natural world has been a difficult topic in biology and zoology: 
Some scientists have said that it contradicts Darwin’s notion of the survival of 
the fittest, whereas others have described ways in which altruism is compat-
ible with Darwin.
All altruism consists of a mix of humane caring and sharing of oneself and 
one’s resources with others exclusively for their benefit. Altruism rests on a 
deep sensitivity to certain needs and wants of a target of benefits. In social 
entrepreneurship, we see two main forms of altruism: pure altruism and rela-
tive altruism.

43
 Chapter 3: Motivation and the Volunteer Spirit
Pure altruism
Pure altruism is the ideal form of altruism, which is only rarely achieved in 
human beings. The purely altruistic person is totally focused on helping and 
satisfying another person, group, or other target of benefits, with no sense 
whatsoever of personal satisfaction that might flow from the altruistic act.
Mohandas Gandhi might be the most famous example of someone displaying 
pure altruism. (By the way, Gandhi was an extremely active social entrepre-
neur.) True, he gained considerable acclaim, even power, as a national leader 
in India, but for him, this status was coincidental. It was not something he 
sought for its own sake, though he must have subsequently found power to 
be useful for reaching certain social goals.
Relative altruism
In relative altruism, by contrast, the altruist gains a degree of personal sat-
isfaction through the altruistic act. For example, through relative altruism a 
person may feel good about being altruistic; acquire valued skills, knowledge, 
or experience; or enjoy the satisfaction of the people who have been helped. 
The relative altruist gains these benefits while helping the target of benefits 
experience some satisfaction of their own.
In practice, most altruism is relative. Usually, it’s a reciprocal process offering 
a level of satisfaction for both the altruists and the targets of their benefits.
Community engagement
The social entrepreneur working with a target of benefits wants to change 
the community in a particular way. This is true even if the entrepreneurial 
efforts are directed toward the environment. Community engagement means 
The desire to help
Abraham Maslow, one of the world’s best-
known psychologists, said that human needs 
are ranked by their priority, such that basic 
needs like food and shelter must be met before 
meeting advanced needs like self-esteem and 
achievement. These last two needs can be 
satisfied by participating in serious leisure, 
including nonprofit social enterprises, and devo-
tee work, which includes for-profit social enter-
prise. Moreover, altruism can be expressed 
in these two kinds of work and leisure, both 
of which we discuss in later sections of this 
chapter.

44
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
performing a civic duty, responsibility, or obligation by working toward ame-
lioration of a community concern.
The motivational platform of community engagement is built from one or 
more of the following three planks:
 
✓ A desire to solve a community problem
 
✓ A desire to give back to the community, often in the sense of wanting to 
return what the entrepreneur feels she has gained from it
 
✓ A desire to be part of the community by becoming involved in it and 
interacting with its members
 
By the way, the community in which one becomes engaged doesn’t necessarily 
have to be your local community. It could be located elsewhere — in a differ-
ent city, state, region, or country.
All three community engagement planks rest on the vision of working 
through the community to make it a better place to live. However, differ-
ent people sometimes have different notions of whether something makes 
the community better. For example, some people oppose the fluoridation of 
municipal water; they consider it to be poisoning (whereas other people, 
including many dentists, believe it’s an important strategy for reducing tooth 
decay). Coming to terms with the different points of view in a community is 
an important aspect of community engagement.
Generosity
People who give liberally of their time, money, or other possessions are 
generous. All generosity is altruistic, though the reverse is not true — that 
is, a person may altruistically give money or time, but in amounts that may 
appear to others as ungenerous. Yes, even stingy people can be altruistic, 
provided they give something.
 
If you want your enterprise to succeed, you’d better be prepared to be gen-
erous with all the resources you have. Others in the enterprise may well be 
required to do the same, but you, as the founder, usually have the 
biggest stake in its success, so you need to be the most generous. People tend 
to notice outsized contributions. Your success may well rest on especially 
notable expenditures of time, if not money and, depending on the target of 
benefits, other resources.

 Chapter 3: Motivation and the Volunteer Spirit
Compassion and sympathy
Compassion means “to suffer with,” and sympathy means “to feel with.” 
Compassion and sympathy are generated by sensing another person’s 
suffering, leading to an inclination to show mercy for, give aid to, or care for 
that person — in other words, they lead to altruistic action. We discuss com-
passion in detail in Chapter 2. Here we focus on its motivational properties as 
they bear on starting a social enterprise.
 
We use the term sympathy to refer to the compassion toward animals, 
birds, and other living creatures, reserving compassion for inter-human 
feelings.
Compassion is expressed in response to one or more of three human core 
values. Human core values revolve around humane caring, sharing, and social 
support. They help motivate social entrepreneurs to act and establish goals 
in line with their missions. We divide human core values into the following 
categories:
 
✓ Social religiosity: Compassionate people may, through religious teach-
ings, become concerned about the suffering of others.
 
✓ Sociability: Compassionate people may want to interact directly with 
the objects of their feelings. This, they feel, is the most rewarding and 
effective way of expressing these sentiments.
 
✓ Personal social service: Compassionate people may want to satisfy the 
needs and wishes of others.
Some social entrepreneurs have no need to be compassionate. For example, 
some aspire to better the environment for aesthetic reasons — maybe 
they’re running a campaign to remove signboards along highways or organiz-
ing a club to pick up the litter found on public beaches.
 
Take some time to examine your own motivations for wanting to engage in 
social entrepreneurship. Write down what you come up with. You may be 
surprised by what you find. You may even discover that you can use the infor-
mation to refocus your goals, change your direction or target of benefits, or 
seek a different career path that fits better with what you want. If you’re run-
ning a social enterprise, encourage your volunteers and other hires to write 
down their own motivations. Doing so could help you make your enterprise 
more efficient.

Serious Leisure: Social Entrepreneurship 
as a Career Choice
As a social entrepreneur, just what are you doing? Sure, you’re trying to solve 
a pressing problem — one that bothers you and perhaps others who are 
important to you. And yes, you’re trying to change the world or a small part 
of it. But in a career sense, what are you doing?
If you hope to develop a for-profit social enterprise, then the answer to your 
question might be work, or at least something that’s work-related. But if 
you’re not sure you’re building a for-profit social enterprise — if you don’t 
know whether that’s even conceivable, or you don’t need or want money 
from it — then is it really work? How do you place your proposed nonprofit 
activity in the context of your community? These are important questions to 
answer because why you’re doing something can affect every aspect of how 
and how well you do it.
If you don’t know the answers to these questions, you’re not alone. From 
our own observations on social entrepreneurship, we know that many entre-
preneurs never even inquire into the nature of what they’re doing. But we 
The Fresh Air Fund: The compassion of 
Reverend Willard Parsons
The Fresh Air Fund came into being in 1877 as 
an independent nonprofit organization. Its mis-
sion was simple: to give children living in the 
poorer urban communities a chance to escape 
the heat and noise of the street by enjoying free 
summer vacations in the countryside.
At the time the fund was established, New York 
City had large numbers of poor children living in 
overpopulated apartment buildings. Among other 
miseries, they were susceptible to the tuberculo-
sis epidemic of the day, the cure for which was 
believed to lie in getting some “fresh air.”
Around 1875, the Reverend Willard Parsons 
was serving as minister of a small, rural parish 
in Sherman, Pennsylvania. Reverend Parsons 
encouraged members of his congregation to 
volunteer as host families, and in this manner 
provide the neediest of the children of New 
York with a country vacation. From this altru-
ism, the Fresh Air Fund was born. Its success 
was almost immediate. By 1881, the fund was 
growing so rapidly that Parsons appealed for 
financial help from The New York Tribune. With 
its largesse, the fund was incorporated in 1888 
as “The Tribune Fresh Air Fund Aid Society.”
Today the Fresh Air Fund provides thousands 
of inner-city young people with escape from 
the mean streets in which they live. Volunteer 
host families still help with this project, along 
with five camps that the fund now operates in 
upstate New York.

 Chapter 3: Motivation and the Volunteer Spirit
believe that having a deeper understanding of what you’re doing and why 
you’re doing it can be most clarifying and helpful in your attempt to reach 
your goals, for three main reasons:
 
✓ It can tell you more about your own motivation for doing what you do.
 
✓ It can show how your efforts fit with other parts of community life.
 
✓ It can help justify your entrepreneurial mission and your zeal for pursu-
ing it.
If what you’re doing isn’t exactly work, what is it? Well, in a way it’s leisure. 
Leisure is uncoerced activity engaged in during free time. In other words, lei-
sure is what you want to do, using your abilities and resources in a way that 
fulfills you. Unlike work, most leisure is free of obligation — that’s where the 
uncoerced part comes in. You’re obligated to work for a living, unless you’re 
independently wealthy. But you’re not obligated to help humanity.
Now, we’re not talking about vegging out in front of the boob tube. We define 
serious leisure as the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volun-
teer activity that people find so interesting and fulfilling that they launch 
themselves on a (leisure) career. Staying with an activity such as developing 
a social enterprise takes considerable effort because you have to stick with 
it long enough to acquire the special skills, knowledge, and experience you 
need to succeed.
Serious leisure — what social entrepreneurs engage in — requires the follow-
ing six traits:
 
✓ You need to have the drive and the commitment to persevere at the activity.
 
✓ You need to have or be aiming at a career that you can pursue.
 
✓ You need to be willing to put in effort in order to gain skill and knowledge.
 
✓ You need to be able to realize special benefits, such as self-fulfillment, 
self-expression, and group accomplishment.
 
✓ You need to be cultivating an attractive personal and social identity.
 
✓ You need to maintain a unique ethos and be involved in your social world.
 
By social world we mean an internally recognizable set of participants, orga-
nizations, events, and practices that have coalesced into a shared sphere of 
interest and involvement. The social world of a social enterprise might include 
its funding contacts, suppliers, repair people, service partners, relevant gov-
ernmental connections, and, of course, the target of benefits (beneficiaries of 
the work of the enterprise).
To find serious leisure through social entrepreneurship, you must have a 
sense of commitment and a moral obligation to your enterprise and its target 
of benefits. These two attributes are key in motivating you to serve as a vol-
unteer in your own social enterprise.

48
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
A strong sense of commitment
Many social entrepreneurs have a strong commitment to their enterprise and 
to their mission. They most certainly want to do it, so they choose to do it. 
Yet, it’s something they could deny themselves, perhaps because they decide 
they lack the time, energy, money, knowledge, or other resources needed for 
such an undertaking.
 
Commitment and leisure may sound like an odd couple, but in serious leisure, 
commitment is a central condition.
A sense of moral obligation
A strong sense of moral obligation drives some people to develop social 
enterprises. To the extent that they feel “coerced” by their own conscience 
into social entrepreneurship, they aren’t doing it as leisure. Entrepreneurs 
may be fired up by strong religious convictions, beliefs about social injustice, 
or a sense of imminent environmental disaster, for example. They feel they 
have no choice but to act, so they become determined to get a social enter-
prise up and running. They’d rather be doing something else in their free 
time. So, it’s not really leisure in these cases, but neither is it work exactly 
because very few of these advocates (dare we say crusaders?) will earn a 
livelihood through their cause. Still, their compulsive drive can be said to be 
a kind of personal obligation — one they’re powerfully committed to.
Volunteering: Working for something 
other than money
As you acquire the skills, knowledge, and expe-
rience necessary to build a social enterprise, a 
sense of career emerges. And this career — the 
career of serious leisure that nonprofit social 
entrepreneurs pursue — is often that of the vol-
unteer. A volunteer is someone who offers unco-
erced altruistic help, either formally or informally 
and with little or no pay, for the benefit of both 
the target of benefits and the volunteer. We dis-
cuss volunteers in more detail later in this chap-
ter, but here we want to fit them into our picture 
of social entrepreneurial careers.
Remember: Volunteering social entrepreneurs 
are not volunteers for someone else’s group 
or organization. They’re volunteering their time 
and expertise in their own enterprises.

 Chapter 3: Motivation and the Volunteer Spirit
It’s Not All Altruism: Rewards 
and Costs of Serious Leisure
Why do social entrepreneurs — yourself included — engage in serious lei-
sure? Never fear — people have actually looked into this. Years of research 
have identified ten rewards of serious leisure. When you engage in serious 
leisure, you get the following:
 
✓ Personal enrichment from cherished experiences
 
✓ Self-actualization through the development of skills, abilities, and 
knowledge
 
✓ Self-expression by using the skills, abilities, and knowledge that you’ve 
already developed
 
✓ Enhanced self-image by becoming known to others as a particular kind 
of serious leisure participant
 
✓ Self-gratification via a combination of enjoyment and satisfaction — also 
known as fun or, for the slightly more hip, flow
 
✓ Re-creation or regeneration of oneself, often especially gratifying after 
an obligatory workday
 
✓ Financial return, often a minor payment for a serious leisure activity
 
✓ Social attraction by associating with other serious leisure participants 
and in the social world of the activity
But I thought leisure meant relaxation and fun?
Remember the qualifier serious. Serious leisure 
is one of three forms of leisure — the other two 
are casual leisure and project-based leisure. 
People “volunteer” in all three forms, but their 
volunteering is most complex and substantial in 
the serious form. Serious leisure is a systematic 
pursuit that can lead to a career.
Casual leisure is short lived, immediate, pleasant 
activity (think naps, gossiping, or watching TV). 
It requires little or no skill or knowledge to enjoy. 
Casual volunteering includes stuffing envelopes, 
distributing leaflets on a street corner, or taking 
tickets at a charity event.
Project-based leisure is a short-term, moder-
ately complicated, occasional creative under-
taking carried out in free time. It requires some 
planning, effort, and sometimes skill or knowl-
edge, but it’s not intended to become serious 
leisure. Common projects include throwing 
a surprise birthday party, working on a home 
improvement project, learning an instrument, 
or volunteering at festivals and sporting events.

50
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
 
✓ Group accomplishment derived from a sense of helping with a group 
effort in accomplishing a serious leisure project
 
✓ Contribution to the maintenance and development of the community, 
including senses of helping, being needed, and being altruistic in making 
the contribution
Note that the first seven rewards are personal and the last three are social. 
Social rewards are enormously important for volunteer social entrepreneurs. 
When asked about their own motivations, most social entrepreneurs place 
the last two items at the top of the list, though for-profit entrepreneurs also 
stress the importance of financial return. By comparison, amateurs and hob-
byists tend to place the first three items at or near the top.
 
The drive to find fulfillment in serious leisure is the drive to experience the 
rewards of a given leisure activity. Get enough rewards, and the cost of achiev-
ing them become worth it. These rewards are nothing to sneeze at, either. The 
desires to realize talents and develop oneself — to find personal fulfillment — 
are powerful interests, described by psychologists as being among our basic 
needs.
Some costs also come from engaging in serious leisure in general, and social 
entrepreneurship in particular. For example, many social entrepreneurs have 
had to face the disappointment of failing to receive funding from a foundation 
or other granting agency. Moreover, entrepreneurs find some aspects of their 
serious leisure disagreeable, among them: filling in reports for government 
to justify charitable status, having to dismiss incompetent paid staff or vol-
unteers, and dealing with community opposition to their social goals. There 
may be tensions, too. For example, some members of the enterprise can be 
difficult to get along with and there may be tense relations at times with the 
targets of your group’s benefits.
In short, you will also face various costs and you need to consider whether 
experiencing the rewards and pursuing the social goals is worth it. It prob-
ably will be, but examining your social enterprise from this negative angle of 
costs is a good idea.
The costs of leisure may also be seen as one kind of leisure constraint. Leisure 
constraints are those things that limit your participation in leisure activities, 
your use of services (for example, limits of bank financing, accounting fees, 
costs of utilities), and your satisfaction or enjoyment (such as sense of achieve-
ment, personal enrichment, and group accomplishment). In volunteering, for 
example, money, transportation, scheduling, and even your gender can be 
constraining. (All cultures promote beliefs about what is considered appropri-
ate activity for men and women. So, a woman whose social enterprise revolves 
around promoting certain religious views would probably not be taken seri-
ously in societies where religious interpretation has always been done by 
men.) Costs, constraints included, dilute the enjoyment and fulfillment that you 
experience in pursuing certain leisure activities. This is true even if such costs 
are overridden by the powerful rewards you get.

 Chapter 3: Motivation and the Volunteer Spirit
For-Profits: The Entrepreneur as 
Occupational Devotee
The distinction between a serious leisure pursuit and really, really loving 
your paycheck-generating job is not always clear.
Occupational devotion is a strong, positive attachment to a form of self-
enhancing work, where achievement and fulfillment are high, and the core 
activity has such intense appeal that the line between work and leisure is 
virtually erased. An occupational devotee is someone inspired by this kind of 
occupational devotion. Devotee work — the core activity of the occupation — 
is work that’s capable of inspiring occupational devotion.
Work and leisure are not so easily separated. Although casual leisure and 
nondevotee work can be seen as separate “coins,” serious leisure and devo-
tee work are really two sides of a single, separate coin (see Figure 3-1).

Occupational devotees turn up chiefly, though not exclusively, in four areas 
of the economy, as long as their work there is not too bureaucratized (see 
Chapter 13 for more on bureaucracy):
 
✓ Certain small businesses
 
✓ Skilled trades
 
✓ Consulting and counseling occupations
 
✓ Public- and client-centered professions
Occupational devotees are, by definition, people who have a passion for their 
work. Unfortunately, most people work at jobs that they aren’t particularly 
passionate about. But as someone who’s interested in starting or running 
a socially conscious business, you may be one of the lucky ones — you’ve 
found work that meets the following six criteria:
 
✓ The valued core activity is profound. A core activity is the set of inter-
related actions or steps that you must follow in order to achieve the 
outcome or product you find attractive (that is, enjoyable, satisfying, 
and fulfilling). In order to perform the core activity well, you need sub-
stantial skill, knowledge, or experience — or a combination of these.
 
✓ The activity offers significant variety. You’re not stuck at a desk doing 
the same thing day after day. Instead, your job involves many different 
activities. One day is never the same as the next.
 
✓ The activity gives you the chance to be creative or innovative in your 
work — your work becomes an expression of your individual per-
sonality. What you’re doing on a daily basis results in something new 
or different that you can shape. You’re using your imagination to carry 
out daily routines. As an added bonus, you’re not likely to be bored as a 
socially conscious entrepreneur.
 
✓ You have control over the time you invest in your job, which means it 
never becomes a burden. Medium and large bureaucracies tend to not 
provide this criterion. In the interest of the survival and development of 
their organization, managers often feel they must deny their employees 
this freedom and force them to accept stiff deadlines and heavy work-
loads. No activity, be it leisure or work, is so appealing that it invites 
unlimited participation during all waking hours.
 
✓ You’re good at the work you’re doing — and you like it. One man’s meat 
is another’s poison. John finds great fulfillment in being a physician, for 
example — an occupation that holds little appeal for Jane who, instead, 
adores her for-profit social enterprise (work that John finds unappealing).
 
✓ You work in a physical and social environment that encourages you to 
focus on the job at hand. This criterion refers to the working conditions 
in your enterprise, to its lighting, temperature, level of noise and the 
like, and to the people with whom you work, including their personali-
ties, behavior, and commitment to their roles in your enterprise.

53
 Chapter 3: Motivation and the Volunteer Spirit
A number of things can happen that transform what was a devotee job into 
one that becomes largely disagreeable. There may be a reduction in the vari-
ety or level of inventiveness the job once offered, for example. A lawyer in a 
firm may be assigned only one kind of case, whereas before she was handling 
a variety. Or the lawyer is told to follow a certain model of legal procedures 
that eliminates the inventiveness of being able to choose her own. Someone 
may have to work significantly longer hours — even serious leisure can’t be 
pursued indefinitely without rest and rejuvenation. Or the physical and social 
environment can change for the worse, such as increased ambient noise or 
heat or reduced quality of air. Or maybe a new colleague comes to work in 
your enterprise who turns out to be unlikeable or uncooperative.
 
If any of these changes happen, and you nevertheless stay with the enterprise 
and its mission, you become an entrepreneur driven by disagreeable obliga-
tion. In other words, it becomes just a regular job like so many others. Keep 
this in mind as you pursue a career in social entrepreneurship: The devotee 
and leisure qualities of the activity can become undermined by uncontrollable 
external forces. (We examine many of these potentially damaging external 
forces in Chapters 13 and 18.)
But this is a two-way street. You may currently be employed in a nondevotee 
job — whether it’s one that was formerly highly attractive to you or one that 
never was. Starting and running a social enterprise can become one way of 
escaping this unpleasant situation. At first, this is likely to be serious leisure, 
carried out after stints of disagreeable employment. Later, it may become 
devotee work, as the enterprise becomes more profitable.
Leisurely Volunteering
So far, this chapter has mentioned three kinds of social entrepreneur: volun-
teer, obligated, and for-profit. Whichever kind you are, it is highly probable 
that, at least in the early stages of development of your enterprise, you’ll also 
seek volunteers to help realize your mission.
To the extent that your enterprise becomes driven by profit motives, reliance 
on volunteers tends to decrease and may even disappear. In fact, volunteer 
workers of the casual and project-based variety are almost exclusively found 
in the nonprofit sector of the economy. And this only makes sense, as the 
altruistic motive of selflessly giving your time to an endeavor squares poorly 
with the business ethic of labor compensation.
Defining what a volunteer is
Volunteers are people who feel that they’re engaging in enjoyable serious, 
casual, or project-based leisure for an activity that they can accept or reject 

54
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
on their own terms. (We’re not talking about social entrepreneurs here, but 
about people who give some of their time to help the social entrepreneur.)
A key element in the leisure conception of volunteering is the absence of 
coercion, moral or otherwise, to undertake a particular activity.
 
The preceding paragraph is sometimes called the volitional definition of volun-
teering. (The more common economic conception of the volunteer just means 
people who don’t get paid, avoiding the messy, though critical, question of 
motive that we’re examining in this chapter.)
A volunteer performs, for a period of time, a valued service or benefit in 
either an informal or formal setting. It’s through volunteer work that the 
volunteer provides a service or benefit to a target of benefits. He usually 
receives no pay (though people serving in volunteer programs are sometimes 
compensated for out-of-pocket expenses), and it must be actual work. Giving, 
say, blood, money, or clothing may be altruistic and even generous, but it’s 
not volunteering.
Identifying what volunteers 
get out of the deal
As a social entrepreneur, you as a volunteer and the people you engage as 
volunteers are, in both instances, altruistically providing a service or benefit 
to others who are also benefiting from the rewards mentioned earlier in this 
chapter (pleasant social interaction, self-enriching experiences, a sense of 
contributing to nonprofit group success, and the like).
 
Volunteering is motivated by both altruism and self-interest.
The self-interested component of volunteering is important because personal 
interest is a main explanatory element in leisure motivation. To prove this, 
you only have to consider that many people want to help others, but they 
tend to gravitate toward “interesting” altruistic opportunities, from which 
they believe they’ll reap some positive, personal, nonmaterial rewards — 
such as experiencing pleasure, developing themselves by acquiring a new 
and valued skill, or expressing their skills and knowledge in satisfying ways.
Volunteer activities in the world of social entrepreneurship can be divided 
into six types of interest. Volunteers develop an interest in activities focused 
on one or more of the following:
 
✓ People
 
✓ Ideas
 
✓ Things

55
 Chapter 3: Motivation and the Volunteer Spirit
 
✓ Flora (trees and other plants)
 
✓ Fauna (fish, birds, mammals, and other animals)
 
✓ The natural environment
Each type offers its volunteers an opportunity to pursue, through altruis-
tic action, a particular area of personal interest. Thus, volunteers who like 
working with certain ideas are attracted to idea-based volunteering (such as 
spreading a religion or teaching a language), whereas those who like certain 
kinds of animals are naturally attracted to faunal volunteering (saving the 
seals, the whales, the polar bears, or the whooping crane).
 
Any one of these six kinds of interest may be pursued by following any of the 
three kinds of volunteering: casual, project-based, or serious.
Searching for volunteers
Volunteers are not all the same. They differ in their reasons for volunteering — 
they may be pursuing serious, casual, or project-based leisure through their 
volunteer activity. And, depending on which of these three they’re pursuing, 
their contributions to your enterprise will vary.
Serious leisure volunteers
Social entrepreneurs, as we’ve mentioned, are volunteers of the serious lei-
sure variety. They may also need to engage other, similar types of serious 
leisure volunteers to serve as lobbyists, legal advisors, publicity specialists, 
secretaries, or treasurers on a board of directors, to give just a few examples. 
The social entrepreneur usually recognizes such people as kindred spirits, 
who find the same kinds of rewards and levels of commitment in their leisure.
 
Consider environmental volunteering, which entails either monitoring or 
changing a particular set of external conditions that affect people, flora, or 
fauna. Serious leisure volunteering in this case might include maintaining 
hiking trails and trout streams as well as organizing and conducting envi-
ronmentally related publicity campaigns. These campaigns might include 
anti-smoking, clean air, clean water, anti-logging, or anti-mining campaigns; or 
promoting access to natural recreational resources such as lakes, forests, and 
ocean frontage. Any of these could also be pursued as leisure projects. The 
casual volunteer finds plenty of opportunities in these examples, seen in door-
to-door distribution of leaflets promoting a clean air campaign, for example, or 
picking up litter in a park or along a highway.
 
If you don’t bump into these kindred spirits in the course of establishing your 
social enterprise, you may want to turn to organizations that train serious lei-
sure volunteers. One such organization — Social Entrepreneur Corps — was 
established to train such volunteers for work in development, a fancy term for 
assisting less developed countries. The company was founded as a worldwide 

56
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
organization for social entrepreneurs. The founders, former Guatemala Peace 
Corps volunteers, worked for many years to create intelligent entrepreneurial 
and educational solutions for long-standing developmental challenges. Social 
Entrepreneur Corps provides university students, recent graduates, and 
young professionals with the means to experience and participate in innova-
tive developmental work. The organization has been able to assemble highly 
effective teams in which all members — interns, volunteers, travelers, and 
locals — gain from their participation in the common project. You can find 
out more about Social Entrepreneur Corps at www.socialentrepreneur
corps.com. You may also want to consider VolunteerMatch (www.volunteer
match.org) or One Brick (www.onebrick.org), two organizations that try 
to match the needs of nonprofit organizations with volunteers who can help 
meet those needs.
 
You can also try local volunteer centers. Such groups often offer training or 
steer you to sources of training for volunteers serving in certain positions, 
particularly those on boards of directors. Usually, though, you train your own 
volunteers (see Chapter 18).
Casual and project-based leisure volunteers
Nonprofit social entrepreneurs often need one or both of the other two types 
of volunteers — those serving in casual roles and those serving in projects. 
True, the serious volunteers could also conceivably act in these ways, but as 
you see in Chapter 18, if you rely too heavily on your serious volunteers, you 
risk overusing these valuable people. So the wise entrepreneur searches for 
other helpers to meet casual needs and those associated with projects.
Casual and project-based volunteers are all looking for their own leisure 
experiences, of the sort described earlier.
Building things is one activity with a lot of project-based volunteering. Some 
material volunteers organize their work for Habitat for Humanity as a project, 
as do those who donate their trade skills to fix plumbing or electrical prob-
lems at their church or help construct the set for a high school theater pro-
duction. More examples of material volunteering as serious leisure include 
regular volunteers who repair and restore furniture and clothing donated to 
the Salvation Army, prepare meals for the indigent, and perform secretarial 
or bookkeeping services for nonprofit groups.
Volunteers providing water filters and electrical lighting to developing coun-
tries are engaging in serious leisure material volunteering, as are volunteer 
firefighters (when they’re not rescuing people or cats up trees). Casual mate-
rial volunteering refers to such activities as regularly stuffing envelopes for a 
nonprofit group mailing, picking up trash along beaches or roadsides (which 
could also be classified as environmental volunteering), and helping keep 
score at youth sporting matches.

57
 Chapter 3: Motivation and the Volunteer Spirit
Casual and project-based volunteers are looking for their own leisure experi-
ences — not careers. Casual and project volunteers can certainly become 
committed to the tasks they’ve agreed to perform, but in order for this to 
happen the tasks must be short term. If these volunteers were looking for 
long-term altruistic involvement, they would seek opportunities to volunteer 
for serious leisure positions. (See Chapter 18 for a lot more on managing vol-
unteers in your enterprise.)
Mixed-interest volunteering
Many volunteer activities bridge two or more of 
the types described in this chapter. One exam-
ple would be pro bono legal service, which 
deals with both ideas and people. Volunteer 
consultants also work with ideas and people, 
as do zoo and museum guides and volunteer 
teachers and instructors.
Missionary work invariably centers on both 
ideas and people and may also involve mate-
rial work, such as building a school, church, or 
hospital. Conceivably, missionary work could 
extend across four kinds of interest: people, 
ideas, things, and the natural environment. In 
this situation a missionary would work with 
local people to establish safe water practices 
and resources, which would require cleaning 
up the surrounding environment.
Membership in certain nonprofit groups 
brings with it many different types of activities. 
Examples include Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, 
in which youth are instructed in such diverse 
endeavors as knot tying, leadership skills, 
outdoor survival, and identifying plants and 
animals.

Communicating for Social Change
In This Chapter
▶ Being your own muse by talking to yourself
▶ Communicating with small groups and hierarchies
▶ Breaking down barriers to communication
▶ Communicating for the common good
C
ommunication has a central place in achieving social change. Initially, 
many might react skeptically to that statement. Talk and things get 
better? Aren’t we supposed to walk the walk, not just talk the talk? Isn’t talk 
cheap — and don’t actions matter more? “Sticks and stones may break my 
bones,” we’re told as kids, “but names will never hurt me.”
Well, as we hope to show in this chapter, even the very naming of things 
in the world does have a transforming power. In many respects, the world 
changes — rapidly — as a direct result of human communication.
 
As a social entrepreneur it behooves you to master the world-changing power 
of language, so that your communication is powerful and effective. This chap-
ter aims to show you some ways of harnessing your communication capabili-
ties in the field of social entrepreneurship.
We think a good place to start is close to home. That is, with you.
Talking to Yourself Helps 
More Than You’d Think
Before you can communicate effectively with others about changing the world, 
you need to figure out how to communicate effectively with yourself. After all, 
if you don’t know what you’re talking about, how will anybody else? You have 
to develop a healthy and productive internal dialogue with yourself.

60
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
Sometimes this internal conversation happens automatically — you may not 
even mean for it to happen. Depending on your worldview, the welling-up 
origins of unexpected internal conversations might be found in your deepest 
spirituality, your unconscious mind, your evolutionary programming, your 
innate capacities for creativity, a chance remark made by someone — or 
whatever. The ancients used to call this internal voice the muse.
Your muse may strike in profoundly emotional ways that shake you up and 
demand your attention. You might then go on to debate with yourself, for 
example, a flash of insight about your enterprise — or not. You might turn it 
over in your mind before deciding what to do about it. Or you might simply 
trust it implicitly and wholeheartedly from the beginning.
Maybe you have a little voice in you that tells you to do something (similar to 
Leymah Gbowee — see the nearby sidebar, “The market women of Liberia”). 
Great! But take that as a starting point, not the end of the discussion. 
Psychological research shows that your success in such matters depends 
to an important degree not so much on your optimism — though pessimism 
can certainly have a negative impact! — but on your keeping your mental 
nose to the grindstone and maintaining self-regulation. According to social 
cognition psychologist Alain Morin, it’s through sustained self-observation, 
setting clear and reasonable goals, avoiding distractions (such as the desire 
for immediate gratification), and avoiding self-control depletion (through, for 
example, fatigue) that you achieve the self-regulation you need to succeed.
And the key to self-regulating is your self-talk — your internal conversation. 
Simply put, self-talk enables you to keep focused on what you need to pay 
attention to. By exercising an active and controlled internal conversation 
with yourself, you engage your working memory capacity, a fancy term for 
your capacity to keep vital information in an agile, rapidly recoverable form. 
Communication begins with you. By routinely accessing your internal com-
munication guidance system, you maintain focus and keep yourself on task.
 
What’s the most effective way to talk to yourself? Don’t leave the process to 
chance or whimsy; keep track of it. Start journaling. As a social entrepreneur, 
you need to continually make sense of your efforts and their context. To do 
that, you’ll need to routinely tap into the knowledge embedded in the practice 
and know-how of your own experience and the experience of others.
Stay with it. The groundwork knowledge that you draw on will only grow and 
develop to its fullest potential when you systematically record what you’re 
experiencing and learning. What you’re finding must be kept available to your 
agile working memory capacity throughout your journey. Journaling as self-
talk allows for that to happen. Socrates claimed that, “The unexamined life is 
not worth living.” So keep examining yours — and talking to yourself about it.

 Chapter 4: Communicating for Social Change
Communicating in the Social Enterprise
As a social entrepreneur — heck, as a human being functioning within almost 
any social context — you’re constantly sending and receiving information 
through talking, gesturing, writing, signing, singing, taking videos and photos, 
touching, making eye contact, and, yes, even ignoring someone. There 
really can’t be any meaningful communication unless there is a sender and 
a receiver. They work together in a commonality. To show that such a com-
monality exists, the receiver of communication generally provides feedback.
There also needs to be some sort of medium or channel through which the 
communication takes place. At one end — let’s say it’s your end — you need 
to have an idea that you want to share, for whatever reasons. You deliver 
your message as clearly as possible in a format that’s understandable. At the 
other end, it helps if the receiver of your communication is ready for your 
communication. For example, let’s hope they’re not distracted by a hungry 
baby or a radio blaring in the kitchen.
The market women of Liberia
Social entrepreneur, Leymah Gbowee had 
a dream a few years ago. Her people — the 
people of Liberia — had suffered enormously 
during the 1990s and early 2000s in a civil war 
between the corrupt and ruthless government 
of Charles Taylor and warlords battling to over-
throw him. Untold tens of thousands were killed 
during those years, and Liberia under Taylor 
was a country in ruins. The women of Liberia, 
led by the likes of Etweda “Sugars” Cooper, 
Vaiba Flomo, Asatu Bah Kenneth, and Leymah, 
were desperate for their families and the wel-
fare of the country and weary of a life that 
had become a living nightmare. That’s when 
Leymah had her vision.
“It was like a crazy dream,” she remembers in 
the internationally acclaimed, award-winning 
documentary film Pray the Devil Back to Hell. 
“It was somebody telling me to get the women 
of the church together to pray for peace.” That 
dream became a rallying call for one of the most 
inspiring women’s movements in history — the 
“market women” of Liberia.
Every day for 21⁄2 years, these women organized 
close by the fish market where they earned 
their meager livelihoods and sustained their 
families. They prayed and talked about peace, 
networked to get their word out, and rallied to 
pressure Taylor to negotiate a peace agree-
ment. Ultimately, the women would play a major 
role in ousting Taylor and replacing him, in 2006, 
with Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the first woman 
president of any African country. Whether 
divinely inspired or not, the point is that a fun-
damental social change in African and Liberian 
history was aided by a social entrepreneur’s 
unexpected internal conversation — a “crazy” 
dream.

Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
You’d think that would be enough to constitute communication. However, 
even if your message has been delivered well and the receiver is ready to 
accept it, it still has to be decoded correctly. As you know, interpreting a 
poem, a work of art or architecture, or even a simple conversation isn’t 
always easy. Finally, your message has to be responded to — that feedback 
thing. Knowing whether the receiver “got” your message is vital, and feed-
back usually conveys whether accurate understanding took place.
You may think this stuff is simple and obvious. But we see many social entre-
preneurs who never even get this far into practicing effective communication. 
And they wonder why dealing and working with others is such a struggle.
The etiquette of communication
According to linguists, a large part of communication has to do with eti-
quette. A listener will go to almost any length to give a speaker the benefit 
of the doubt regarding whether something said actually makes sense — but 
the listener will often take offense at the smallest perceived slight, which is 
of course almost always unintentional on the part of the speaker. That’s why 
communication is filled with elements like “please” and “if you don’t mind” 
and “I hope I’m not bothering you, but . . .” and so on. It’s also why people 
use smiley faces in e-mail messages.
 
To make communication in your enterprise flow more easily, everyone needs 
to follow a few basic rules:
 
✓ Operate under the assumption that all incoming and outgoing messages 
have value. No message should be regarded as pointless or boring. When 
you’re sending a message, keep in mind what your audience wants to
hear — what’s going to seem most important to them. And when you’re 
receiving a message, try to grasp why the sender thinks that what he’s 
saying is important enough to communicate with you.
 
✓ Always clarify things when they seem muddled, and confirm things 
when you think you`ve got things right. Nip any potential for misunder-
standing in the bud, or it can snowball into misunderstanding. That may 
be all right for a sitcom plot, but you’ve got an enterprise to run.
 
✓ If you’re going to be critical, be positive first. Finding the value in the 
other person’s messages and building on that is a good idea.
 
✓ Communicate to gain trust. Remember that no social entrepreneur will 
succeed without strong collaboration — and collaboration won’t happen 
without trust, a basic building block in all human relationships and, 
therefore, societies. So, be sure that your communication with others 
is always honest and transparent. Anything veiled or two-faced will not 
only quickly dismantle the collaborative bridges you need to be building 
but also destroy your credibility as an entrepreneurial leader and com-
munity role model.

63
 Chapter 4: Communicating for Social Change
Communicating in small groups
Working day in, day out with small groups of 3 to 15 people is the lifeblood of 
social entrepreneurship. Basically, there are two kinds of small groups: those 
with leaders and those without.
Groups without leaders
Leaderless groups, such as those you might find in a circular configuration 
where you tend to communicate only with your neighbor, tend to be pretty 
slow in getting things done. With everyone working as equals, there is little 
need for a coordinator of information, making it hard for a leader to emerge. 
On the other hand, the team spirit of leaderless groups tends to be high and 
these groups show flexibility when it comes to solving problems.
Groups with leaders
On the other hand, leadership in small groups tends to arise where there 
is a need for an information hub or coordinator of communications. The 
presence of a leader certainly speeds up the communication process and 
produces good results when confronting relatively straightforward prob-
lems, but it doesn’t necessarily work well when problems are very complex. 
Group members who find themselves farthest away from the group leader (in 
terms of communicating over physical distance or across cultures) may feel 
alienated. When convoluted, unforeseen problems demand large amounts of 
information sharing, the “leadership-as-hub” structure tends to bog down, 
bringing the system back to a more or less leaderless type.
Communicating in hierarchies: 
Directions and grapevines
As you move into more elaborate organizational structures or hierarchies, 
formal and informal communication takes on direction. In hierarchies, the 
direction of formal communication is typically downward, with order givers 
issuing directives to order takers. Understandably, regardless of the content, 
downward communication doesn’t usually make for close relations among 
organizational members.
 
A common feature of hierarchies is that communication, whether formal or 
informal, is documented. Hierarchies are the home of the paper trail — or 
nowadays, the e-mail trail. Rarely is there ambiguity in a hierarchy regarding 
who said what to whom.

64
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
 
But formal communication can also be upward and sideways. More progres-
sive managers these days encourage solicited and unsolicited, informal, 
upward communication. Tasks and decisions are often merely delegated 
rather than micromanaged, for example. This situation is a kind of empower-
ment, and it’s motivating and satisfying to organizational members. Knowing 
that a decision or suggestion is treated appreciatively as that information 
makes its way up the hierarchy is highly rewarding. Needless to say, you want 
to create an organizational culture that values and provides genuine opportu-
nities for upward communication.
Sideways, or lateral, communication occurs as bureaucratic levels and 
departments becoming increasingly interdependent. In these situations, you 
find more personal conversations, small-group get-togethers, troubleshooting 
sessions, and so on.
Hierarchies can also exhibit more informal “diagonal” communication that 
bridges people and departments on different levels. The flow is multidirec-
tional and requires trading lots of information. Working on a major project 
that pulls together many organizational resources and calls for speedy 
exchanges is a natural fit for diagonal communication.
Grapevines, on the other hand, are nearly impossible to control and can 
spread all over the place, including outside the organization, regardless of 
chains of command. Information often flows much faster through grapevines 
than it does through formal channels for a couple reasons:
 
✓ In grapevines there is no documentation, which means that informa-
tion is easy to create and modify — and is open to ridiculous varia-
tions in interpretation. There’s a natural tendency to fill in the gaps in 
information that is often fragmented and incomplete.
 
✓ Grapevines grow through chained small clusters of people. When 
information quickly works its way along the chain and hits a cluster, 
boom! — it’s off in a whole bunch of new directions.
Naturally, grapevines can be dangerous and can create massive headaches 
for managers, especially those who tend to be control freaks. But grapevines 
do have an upside: They can be very useful in supplementing more formal 
channels of communication. They can tap into people’s imaginations, satisfy 
people’s most basic curiosities about what’s really going on, and provide a 
safe place to vent fears and frustrations.
 
If grapevines get out of hand, it’s generally because of misinformation or ambi-
guity surrounding an issue. So, work hard to be clear about what’s really going 
on. And if things aren’t so clear, if things are still being worked out, then admit 
to that, clear the grapevine air by telling the truth, and make a commitment to 
filling people in regularly.

65
 Chapter 4: Communicating for Social Change
Overcoming barriers to communication
Despite the importance and power of communication, successful communi-
cation doesn’t necessarily come easily. In fact, many, many barriers to suc-
cessful communication can spring up unannounced at any time. You should 
always make every effort to anticipate these barriers before they appear or 
manage them when they do. Broadly speaking, communication barriers come 
in two forms, which we call noise and bias.
Noise barriers tend to be physical, biological, or social system issues such as 
loud undesirable sounds, speech difficulties, poor eyesight, time constraints, 
physical distance, organizational complexity, language differences, and so 
forth. Noise barriers are often easily remedied, but because not everyone 
reports such problems, they can go unnoticed.
Bias barriers, on the other hand, are quite complex. They’re rooted in culture 
and tend to manifest in terms of individual choices — for example, using 
jargon, awkward sentence structure, poorly organized ideas, emotional bar-
riers born of aggression or fear; selectively filtering or distorting informa-
tion (as in hearing what one wants to hear); making false assumptions about 
motives; paying attention to communications from managers but not under-
lings; and communicating in gendered or culturally specific ways. All these 
problems can degrade the operation of your enterprise, so watch out for 
them.
 
How can you anticipate or overcome noise- and bias-related communication 
barriers? Well, as trite as the advice may sound, there are three important and 
very basic principles to observe. The first relates to noise, the second to bias, 
and the third to both:
 
✓ Know and control your setting as much as possible. If, for example, 
you’re getting ready to speak to seniors in an auxiliary hospital or facility 
for transitional care, you may want to be sure that you’re in close proxim-
ity to your audience and emphasize a friendly, audible, physical presence. 
Take a moment to assess the physical surroundings or communication 
technology you’re using and make adjustments as necessary.
 
✓ Know your audience. To continue with the seniors’ example, double-
check to be sure that your communication is not demeaning or in any way 
threatening to your audience’s sense of capability. Elders often strongly 
resist being treated as incompetent, so you need to temper your concerns 
with tact — especially when dealing with sensitive subjects.
 
✓ Ask for and give frequent feedback. View every communicative 
attempt as a pilot project, tentatively made and always subject to revi-
sion. And keep the big picture visible. As the writer Antoine de Saint-
Exupery put it: “If you want to build a ship, don’t herd people together 
to collect wood and don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach 
them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.”

66
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
Communication in Social Development
No discussion of communication and how it relates to social entrepreneur-
ship can be complete without looking at the place of communication in social 
development — the fancy name for the process of transforming social struc-
tures to improve the capacity of societies to reach their potential.
Development communication versus 
communication for social change
Over the years, some interesting differences in terminology have developed. 
Academics, planners, and other “experts” tend to talk about the discipline of 
development communication. More grassroots-oriented communication spe-
cialists, such as Alfonso Gumucio-Dagron, tend to refer to communication for 
social change.
Although both approaches respect culture and tradition, local knowledge, 
and dialogue between development specialists and communities, develop-
ment communication, according to Gumucio-Dagron, has become institution-
alized and often implies a static, inflexible “blueprint” for social development. 
Communication for social change, however, “does not attempt to anticipate 
which media, messages, or techniques are better, because it relies on the 
process itself, rooted in the community from which the proposed action 
must emerge.” We prefer to go with the more grassroots approach of com-
munication for social change, which features many elements of participatory 
informal or popular education, while respecting any contributions that can 
also be made by the academics and planners.
As the recent documentary film What Are We Doing Here? (directed by 
Brandon, Daniel, Nick, and Tim Klein) demonstrates in frustrating detail, 
when social entrepreneurs , nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), philan-
thropic foundations, and others attempt to deal with serious health and 
poverty issues in Africa, the lines of communication — and related policy-
making — typically run from the top down. In other words, the Western 
“experts” end up dictating terms to the local peoples on the ground. This is 
often a recipe for disaster, and we have the failed development aid initiatives, 
spanning several decades now, to prove it.
 
But when local voices prevail — when local interventions are coordinated 
by local, truly democratic, participatory, and emerging policies and lines of 
communication — social development efforts have a tendency to “fit” and 
work much, much better.

67
 Chapter 4: Communicating for Social Change
Participatory democracy: The foundation
Communication dynamics work much better with the context of participa-
tory democracy firmly in place — and people the world over are waking up to 
that reality. That is, if communication has a central place in effecting social 
change, that communication will happen more effectively and efficiently 
within participatory democratic structures. Whether you’re working at home 
Homemaker’s Union and Foundation
A superb example of how communication for 
social change models can work comes to us 
through the efforts of a group of Taiwanese 
homemakers. Homemakers? Yes, as we’ve 
seen elsewhere in this book, women, especially 
mothers, are often on the forefront of social and 
environmental change. Many grassroots social 
and environmental change initiatives organize 
around the compassionate undercurrents of 
what’s sometimes called motherwork, which 
centers on family, children, and future genera-
tions. (We expand on this topic, among others, 
in Chapter 5.)
Four decades of oppressed homemaker social 
energy was unleashed with the lifting of mar-
tial law in 1987. Formerly socially marginal-
ized, a group of Taiwanese women became a 
force to be reckoned with as they founded the 
Homemaker’s Union and Foundation (HUF), a 
potent organization responsible for developing 
an environmental, consumer, and educational 
reform movement.
HUF’s tremendous success was a direct result 
of the way in which members communicated 
with each other and their public. The group 
initiated contact with academics, planners, 
and other experts in order to learn as much as 
they could about their many pressing issues. 
They then brought what they learned back to 
their communities, educated their neighbors, 
and communicated for social change through 
demonstrating, petitioning, distributing pam-
phlets, being interviewed on radio and televi-
sion, meeting with local politicians to influence 
policy — and much more. It was their commu-
nication strategy that enabled them to achieve 
reforms.
HUF also pursued other, more action-oriented 
avenues. “Talking the talk” — called advocacy, 
the pursuit of influencing outcomes — can lead 
to action. But starting out with action can also 
end up reaping huge returns. In 1993, HUF initi-
ated cooperative buying of two products: rice 
and grapes. Within seven years, the group had 
expanded its buying to 300 items and, through 
local word of mouth, had attracted 6,000 mem-
bers to its co-op.
This, by the way, was also the method of Jim 
Grant, former CEO of UNICEF. Millions of chil-
dren’s lives were saved as the result of simply 
going out and making vaccinations cheaply 
and widely available. Prior to Grant’s tenure, 
all the advocacy in the world wasn’t having the 
needed impact. With Grant, however, advocacy 
arose in waves, spontaneously, often through 
sheer word of mouth, after the good work was 
done.

68
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
or abroad, this means that in a globalized and highly interconnected 
world, you can expect that a participatory ethos will be framing much of 
your communications.
As Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General and CEO of CIVICUS, South Africa, put it 
recently: “Although faith in traditional political institutions is waning, this 
should not be taken as a sign of citizen apathy. On the contrary, people are 
finding new and more direct ways to get involved in public life and decision-
making — marking a shift from representative democracy to what is often 
called participatory democracy.” CIVICUS (www.civicus.org) is an inter-
national alliance of organizations that works to strengthen citizen action and 
civil society throughout the world, especially in countries where democracy 
is weak.
Establishing just such a context, then, is a high priority. That’s why the 
United Nations’ Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific 
(ESCAP) currently promotes the Urban Forums movement, which aims to 
help cities and countries achieve sustainable and effective development 
around social, economic, and environmental issues. (Visit the commission’s 
Web site at www.unescap.org.) Another example is the Korat Forum. (Korat 
is the nickname for the Thai city of Nakhon Ratchasima.) Through its activi-
ties, designed to enhance public awareness of the principles of participatory 
democracy, Korat is today a healthier, friendlier, more livable city than it was 
in the past.
Communicating trends and tipping points
The next chapter, Chapter 5, discusses the use of trends in social entrepre-
neurship. Here we want to look briefly at communication’s place in promot-
ing social trends. One of the most hoped-for developments among social 
entrepreneurs is that their message will be propagated and listened to, and 
that their efforts will be supported or replicated by many others over time. 
Using communication to start and contribute to a noticeable cultural shift is 
probably the secret wish of most social entrepreneurs.
You know you’re really promoting social change when the average Jane and 
Joe accept and celebrate what you do. Although achieving such status isn’t 
the sole or even most important criterion for success, given the scale of 
problems today it is entirely natural to want to feel that your efforts amount 
to more than a drop in the ocean.
The publication of Malcolm Gladwell’s book The Tipping Point (Back Bay 
Books) increased the popularization of social trends. Now, it seems, people are 
keener than ever before to spot the “levels at which the momentum for change 

69
 Chapter 4: Communicating for Social Change
becomes unstoppable,” as Gladwell puts it — the points at which one more 
straw will break the camel’s back. One of the book’s themes is that the commu-
nication dynamics between people can be compared to an epidemic, or a viral 
outbreak. An idea takes on a life of its own and replicates itself through com-
munication networks. As a social entrepreneur, you should try to capitalize on 
and promote your ideas via this phenomenon whenever you can.
Another point Gladwell makes is that three types of people — “Mavens” 
(information experts), “Salesmen” (charismatic endorsers), and especially 
“Connectors” (social relationship hubs) — work together to disseminate 
information to larger groups. Whereas Gladwell plays up the role of “con-
nectors,” Duncan Watts, a network theory sociologist, shows that other, less 
socially connected members of networks, and perhaps the networks them-
selves, are at least as important in driving emerging trends.
 
Trends tend to spread to the larger culture out of small groups that adopt 
and encourage early versions of trends. Our advice for you, the social entre-
preneur, is this: Get thee into trendsetting groups and tell your story there. If 
you’re successful, your story will spread outward.
 
The Lost Boys and Girls of Sudan have been able to garner increasing rec-
ognition and support for their cause by taking their message to university 
campuses, coffee houses, and bistros all over Europe, North America, and 
Australia. These remarkable social entrepreneurs, intent on redeveloping a 
homeland catastrophically decimated by decades of civil war (more than 2 
million dead and 5 million displaced), have become widely recognizable and 
are the subject of a good deal of media buzz. Couple that trend-seeking com-
munication strategy with the capacity building that the Lost Boys and Girls 
are doing in Southern Sudan, and you have the makings of an authentic and 
significant emerging social trend.

W
hen you’re starting or running a social enterprise, your objective 
should be to ensure, to the best of your ability, that your efforts 
today fit the needs of tomorrow. A correct reading of future trends makes it 
much more likely that you’ll remain in a position to cooperate with others 
in making the world a better place. It also helps you maximize the resources 
that are available to you. Appropriately plan for the future, and your enter-
prise will profit in many, many ways.
Paying close attention to trends will make a big difference in the success 
of your enterprise. Trends paint a picture of what’s happening today. They 
indicate broad patterns of regularity and changes in direction or movement, 
including revisions to human needs and behaviors. The earlier you can 
identify, participate in, and respond to these changes, the more proactive, 
instead of reactive, you can be in effectively developing and maximizing new 
social entrepreneurial opportunities for yourself.
Identifying Major Trends 
Facing the World Today
In this section, we cover the kinds of trends that you can count on, not the 
“here today, gone tomorrow” garden variety. Many prognostications come 
and go, and their authors often seem to have simply generated them in order 

72
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
to bring attention to themselves. But the trends we cover here are large-
scale, global trends that have shaped our world for some time and will con-
tinue to do so for the next decade or more. In other words, we consider these 
particular predictions about trends to be relatively solid. You can probably 
bank on them being around for some time and return to them as you envision 
the future contexts of your social ventures.
 
Get together regularly with other social entrepreneurs to discuss these and 
other trends. You just may find that you achieve a sophisticated view of major 
trends that rivals that of the experts, so don’t sell yourself short. Discussing 
trends enables you to work smarter (not harder), steer clear of nasty sur-
prises, minimize your weaknesses, and play your strengths to the hilt.
 
Before we look at specific trends, we need to preface those vistas with a few 
disclaimers:
 
✓ We don’t claim to accurately anticipate specific future events here — 
that’s why they’re called trends. What we do hope to do is provide you 
with reasonably plausible — good enough — scenarios that will allow 
you to align and influence your future:
 
• Alignment: Alignment has to do with understanding that perhaps 
more often than not, you can only know how things are developing 
and go with the flow.
 
• Influence: Influence recognizes that, if you know the course of his-
tory, you may, especially with the right allies, be able to change 
that course somewhat, at least as it pertains to you.
 
✓ What we’re up to is not technically forecasting, which relies on quan-
titative, statistical modeling. Though we do draw somewhat on these 
methods, in this chapter we’re essentially trying to provide some intui-
tive foresight into the conditions that may well impact you and other 
social entrepreneurs over the next few years.
 
✓ When it comes to predicting the future, definitions and methods are 
imprecise, right across the board. In principle, this is because we’re 
extrapolating beyond any available data, which is always a dangerous 
and iffy practice. Indeed, some may claim that, given that reality, it’s not 
worth the bother. We disagree, simply because although trend watching 
is far from certain, the alternative — not paying attention to trends — 
can be deadly to your efforts.
Globalization of science and technology
The term globalization is one of the greatest buzzwords of our times. 
Different people define the term differently. Here’s how we define it: the 
increasing integration and interdependency of human culture.

73
 Chapter 5: Using Trends to Harness the Next Big Things
Thanks to advancing communications technology — especially sophisticated 
cellphones, cable television, and the Internet — economic, political, social, 
and environmental cultures are all able to spread rapidly all over the globe. 
Perhaps the most permeating culture sweeping the world is the globalization 
of science and technology itself.
 
By science we mean the systematic study of the natural world through experi-
mental observation. By technology, we mean the practical application of 
scientific knowledge to understanding our environment and developing and 
producing artifacts.
Understanding how science and technology affect everything else
Of course, the spread of technical knowledge has been going on for much of 
the history of our species. Even our earliest ancestors were very likely capa-
ble of observation, categorization, pattern recognition, prediction (hypoth-
esis testing), and causal reasoning — in other words, all the hallmarks of 
scientific thinking. Yet it wasn’t until relatively recently, with the advent of 
the Industrial Revolution from the 18th to the early 19th century, that things 
really began to take off. With the Industrial Revolution, major changes in agri-
culture, manufacturing, mining, and transport had a profound effect on the 
socioeconomic and cultural conditions in the United Kingdom, Europe, North 
America, and eventually the world. As a result, our daily lives have never 
been the same.
Today, continual and accelerating innovation in technology is almost univer-
sally seen as a basic determinant of globalization. And, of course, science and 
technology also play an important role in the spread of other cultural forms 
such as politics, economics, the arts, and so on.
Compare the possibilities for life today versus those of even 100 years ago. 
The standard of living that many people enjoy today would’ve been totally 
inconceivable back then. In fact, some scholars claim that half the population 
of the United States is alive today simply because of 20th-century technologi-
cal improvements to the delivery of public health.
Beyond that, just consider some recent scientific/technological achieve-
ments: high-energy subatomic particle physics, sequencing the entire human 
genome, the Hubble telescope, sending spacecraft out of our solar system, 
and much more.
Even human intelligence, as measured in IQ tests, seems to have leapt beyond 
the confines of its genetic limits. IQ gains are shown to increase dramatically 
from one generation to the next, which isn’t supposed to happen. This remark-
able phenomenon seems to be very closely tied to the power of human culture 
and socialization — and at least in part, to the rise of scientific literacy.

74
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
Using science and technology in social entrepreneurship
How can you use and further such interesting developments? Be a leader and 
an innovator and build new enterprises. And do one more thing: Accomplish 
these goals while retaining your moral compass and leaving a lasting legacy 
for tomorrow. You’ll find all these themes addressed in detail throughout this 
book, with the moral compass issue covered in the next section. The nearby 
sidebar “Innovator in rural electricity: Fabio Luiz de Oliveira Rosa” contains a 
particularly stellar example of what we’re talking about.
Science and technology: Neutral tools
For all its marvelous successes, the globaliza-
tion of science has also become an enormous 
problem, thanks to the proliferation of powerful 
knowledge and technologies that can cause 
untold destruction. This is not science’s fault, 
though. Science is, at its core, just a tool — it 
simply shows us how to get from A to B. It has 
nothing to say about why we’ve decided we 
need to get to B in the first place. The why is 
a matter of our values. In a world of compet-
ing value spheres, dishonorable ends can too 
easily displace honorable ones. The fact that 
Nazi doctors conducted horrific medical experi-
ments on Jews, for example, shows that even 
the healing arts can be bent to deadly aims. 
That’s why scientific work is so heavily scruti-
nized by ethical review committees worldwide.
With a tool, you have to keep the ends in mind. 
But as the classical social thinker Max Weber 
pointed out, sometimes no explicitly held ends 
exist. This might be the case now, when rapid 
competitive innovation and social change 
create such a sense of flux that we’ve “lost 
our way.” Or maybe it happens when we lose 
our ability to socialize each other toward some 
common end. Regardless, in those situations 
of an “ends” vacuum, the means can become 
the ends. It can be argued that scientific means 
have become their own ends.
As a social entrepreneur, when you embrace 
science to get things done, you should never 
forget the honorable ends you’re pursuing or 
allow them to be displaced by scientific means, 
as enticing and powerful as they may be.
Perhaps one of the best examples of this 
needed balance coming to life is the growing 
push to democratize the Internet through social 
and participatory media and citizen journalism. 
There’s a whole world at stake. The futures of 
inequality, community, politics, organizations, 
and even culture itself may well hang in the 
balance, depending on how the remarkable 
technology of the Internet continues to develop. 
For starters on further investigation, you may 
want to visit the Media Consortium (www.the
mediaconsortium.org) or MediaShift 
Idea Lab (www.pbs.org/idealab), both 
of which are excellent and frequently updated 
resources for keeping abreast of these issues.

 Chapter 5: Using Trends to Harness the Next Big Things
Innovator in rural electricity: 
Fabio Luiz de Oliveira Rosa
Fabio Luiz de Oliveira Rosa is a social entrepre-
neur of almost legendary proportions in south-
ern Brazil. His story begins when a friend’s 
father, Ney Azevedo, was elected mayor of 
Palmares do Sul, a rural municipality in Brazil. 
Azevedo soon invited Rosa to take on the post 
of secretary of agriculture for the municipality. 
After accepting his new position, Fabio set out 
to talk to local farmers and other rural residents. 
He discovered that where politicians talked of 
building roads, impoverished rural folk talked 
of needing to boost local agricultural output, 
family incomes, and quality of life.
Why was agricultural output so low? The vast 
majority of arable land in Palmares was low-
land, useful only for growing rice. But the water 
needed for growing rice was held by wealthy 
landowners who kept it behind dams and in pri-
vate irrigation channels. They would sell their 
water, but the cost to local farmers was exorbi-
tant. So, no water, no rice production.
Eventually there did prove to be a way around 
this problem: A college professor in the region, 
Ennio Amaral, had, some years earlier, devel-
oped an electrical amplification technology that 
could inexpensively deliver electricity from the 
public grid to rural areas. When Fabio turned 
up Amaral’s solution, modified it, and put it into 
practice, the beneficiaries were hundreds, then 
thousands, then more than half a million fami-
lies who could now afford refrigeration, indoor 
plumbing, water pumps for irrigation, common 
household and farm electrical appliances, and 
so on. Affording the water pumps meant fewer 
expenses in growing crops, more production, 
and in some cases increases of more than 400 
percent in farm incomes.
This situation not only boosted local consump-
tion, industry, and commerce, but demon-
strated that rural life was once again feasible. 
That reversed the flow of migration from rural 
to urban areas and also proved to be great for 
Brazil’s cities, because the burden placed on 
their social services was lightened.
As fate would have it, though, when Brazil’s 
public electricity system was suddenly priva-
tized in the 1990s, rural electrical delivery was 
immediately viewed as unprofitable. Services 
were directed toward cities, large industries, 
and farms. Fabio’s initiatives ground to a halt.
But he was undeterred. Now the problem was 
how to affordably get off-grid electricity to rural 
areas. The answer was solar panels. In 2003, 
Rosa’s market research established that rural 
Brazilians spent an average of $11 per month 
on batteries and other nonrenewable energy 
sources such as candles and kerosene.
Rural Brazilians weren’t interested in buying 
solar panels, for a number of different reasons, 
but they were ready to rent the technology if it 
could be made affordable on a monthly basis. 
So Rosa, through his for-profit The Sun Shines 
for All (TSSFA) venture, charged custom-
ers an initial modest installation fee and then 
micro-leased (offering low rent over long peri-
ods of time) a photovoltaic energy system to 
rural households for less than $10 per month. 
The program was a success, overcoming local 
suspicions about the affordability and reliability 
of solar electricity.

Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
Urbanization
In learning to collectively and culturally use science to master the world (or 
at least better survive in it!), it was sensible and efficient, and perhaps inevi-
table, that humans would continually rethink the division of labor. Along with 
a whole host of factors, the increasingly sophisticated specialization of inter-
dependent labor created a need for larger and more complex human settle-
ments that enabled closer communication, mutual regulation, and proximity 
to valuable resources.
Bigger, denser, more problematic
Both developments — more sophisticated divisions of labor and more com-
plex forms of human settlement — have contributed to the continual rise of 
science by taking advantage of our social and cultural leanings. Throughout 
human history, people have been living in larger and more dynamically dense 
settlements — a process called urbanization. The world is rapidly becoming 
a city — and the gargantuan megalopolis (an extensive metropolitan area or a 
long chain of continuous metropolitan areas) is here, springing up all around 
the world, to prove it.
Current trends indicate that new births and rural out-migration (people 
moving from the country to the city) are boosting urban populations every-
where. The United Nations estimates that more than half of the world’s 
population now lives in urban areas — towns or cities — for the first time 
in history. This first 100 years of this new millennium is, according to 
UN-HABITAT (the United Nations agency for human settlements), the “Urban 
Millennium.”
The urbanization trend represents an enormous change from the beginning 
of the 19th century, when cities of 100,000 or more inhabitants housed less 
than 2 percent of the world’s population. By 2050, the same UN body esti-
mates that more than 6 billion people, or about two-thirds of humanity, will 
be living in urban settings.
 
Some experts think those estimates might be high because rapid urbanization 
can be messy and unsustainable. In worst-case scenarios, though, rapid urban-
ization outpaces any functionally available supporting infrastructure, resulting 
in pseudo-urbanization (when a large city comes to exist where there’s no sup-
porting infrastructure to support it), which only aggravates the usual urban 
problems of overcrowding, poverty, unemployment, crime, social upheaval, 
and environmental degradation. Under those conditions, many people who’ve 
migrated to cities looking for a better future will end up leaving. Right now, 
if anyone is leaving cities, it’s the affluent and socially mobile. By “counter-
migrating” to suburban and satellite areas, they benefit from improvements in 
rural electrification and Internet service, while at the same time taking advan-
tage of public transit for commuting.

77
 Chapter 5: Using Trends to Harness the Next Big Things
What social entrepreneurship can do about urbanization
Solving the infrastructural problems of urbanization and the basic physical 
and organizational conditions that cause counter-migration are possible only 
with the help of various levels of government, which can network scientific 
and technical expertise on a large-enough scale. In 2006, for example, the 
Indian government sought a whopping $60 billion to finance, among other 
things, the water and electrical system installations required for Mumbai’s 
distant suburbs and satellite areas. Projects like that are, of course, beyond 
the abilities of even the most deeply pocketed social entrepreneur.
Nevertheless, every social entrepreneur and member of the public should 
keep in mind that government — which is, like science itself, a tool — ought 
to be the means to ends, not the ends themselves. The urbanization of the 
world packs with it enormous challenges, and governments are, on their 
own, relatively powerless to meet those challenges. Governments need moral 
direction from all of us — including you, the compassionate social entrepre-
neur, listening so closely to community needs. (We continue considering 
the role of government in the section “Swamping governments,” later in this 
chapter.)
Where governments fail in producing adequate means to achieving honorable 
ends, you have to hold them accountable — and you should also be ready 
to pick up the slack until the government gets its act together and helps out. 
You can see, then, the tremendous responsibility that you shoulder as a 
social entrepreneur! Often somebody has to get the ball rolling, and count-
less examples abound of exactly this kind of situation prompting the efforts 
of some of our most heroic social entrepreneurs. (See the nearby sidebar 
“Innovator in AIDS treatment: Veronica Khosa” for an example.)
Innovator in AIDS treatment: Veronica Khosa
In 1990, Veronica Khosa, a nurse to those suf-
fering from HIV/AIDS in South Africa’s Gauteng 
province, saw that the needs of those patients 
were overpowering her own capacities to 
provide care, not to mention the capacities of 
a completely ineffective healthcare system. 
Hospitals, in dealing with what the UN called 
the “worst infectious disease catastrophe since 
the Bubonic Plague,” were sending HIV/AIDS 
sufferers home without so much as a dressing 
or ointment for open sores or aspirin for pain.
Knowing that something had to be done and 
that government at all levels was ill-equipped 
to deal with the problems, Khosa decided to 
completely reinvent fundamental healthcare 
around a community-, family-, and home-
based nursing model. Today, Khosa’s Tateni 
Home Care Nursing Services, in partnership 
with SOS Social Centre, delivers care to thou-
sands of people living with HIV/AIDS as well as 
orphaned children. Just as important, Khosa’s 
model is so successful that the Gauteng provin-
cial government has widely adopted it in policy 
and practice.

78
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
Urbanization carries with it other impressive opportunities for social entre-
preneurs — which you may well want to tap into. In our current global 
knowledge economy, prosperity cannot exist without constant innovation. 
But that innovation depends on social investment in the talent and creativity 
of a nation’s people and its future generations — that means all its people 
and everyone to come, not just a select and homogenous few. It’s the cross-
fertilization of ideas spanning cultures and different ways of looking at the 
world that will drive innovation and prosperity in the future. Societies, there-
fore, will need to create environments of inclusion in which all citizens can 
contribute with their particular skills and ideas if they’re going to get ahead. 
(See the nearby sidebar “Innovator in immigrant education: Judy Koch” for 
an example.)
Population growth
Go forth and multiply? Check. We’re at almost 6.8 billion and counting — 
that’s despite China’s one-child family planning policy (introduced in 1979).
The rising tide of humanity
Some experts believe that rising population is the number-one trend affecting 
the world today, but we think current population issues are an unsurprising 
outcome of the first two major trends we’ve discussed so far in this chapter.
Over the past few centuries, the global population has been growing. 
Gradually, life grew less brutish, harsh, and short, and fewer infants and 
women died in childbirth. For a long time, human populations had grown 
Innovator in immigrant education: Judy Koch
Judy Koch, former English teacher turned CEO 
of RSP Manufacturing Corporation, understood 
the importance of the urban multicultural reality 
and its place in social productivity. Eighty per-
cent of her employees were Hispanic, so she 
concerned herself with helping them and their 
children improve their language skills.
But when Koch retired after selling RSP 
in 1997, she took things much further. She 
founded the Bring Me a Book Foundation, a 
self-sustaining social enterprise that provides 
read-aloud workshops and libraries to 
underserved English, Spanish, Vietnamese, 
Mandarin, and Cambodian communities. The 
Bring Me a Book Foundation (www.bring 
meabook.org) has served more than 480,000 
families to date in more than 850 libraries in 
such diverse settings as preschools, child-care 
centers, homeless shelters, clinics, hospitals, 
community centers, Boys & Girls Clubs, and 
businesses throughout the United States and 
elsewhere.

79
 Chapter 5: Using Trends to Harness the Next Big Things
slowly, and thanks to high rates of disease and violent death, these popula-
tions tended to be young. But then science began to turn the tide in our 
favor. To an extent much greater than ever before, we could affect nature 
and transform the world in ways that benefitted us. Humanity has adaptively 
succeeded to such a great extent that the reality in which we live today is 
very much one that we, as technicians and toolmakers, have fashioned for 
ourselves.
As a result of our increasing scientific prowess, infant mortality decreased and 
life expectancy increased. Humans became victims of our own success at sur-
vival, and our numbers began to explode. It wasn’t all about science, however. 
Along with that and just as important, women, under the unswerving regula-
tion of pre-modern traditions, continued to bear and raise large numbers of 
children, doing so over about 70 percent of their adult lives. This potent meet-
ing of new and old culture explains how the Earth’s population soared in 150 
years from fewer than 1 billion in 1800, to 2.5 billion by 1950 — and then shot 
through the roof in just 50 years to 6 billion by 2000. If that’s not incredible 
enough, in less than a decade, as of mid-July 2009, we’ve gained another three-
quarters of a billion! According to the Web site Worldometers (www.world 
ometers.info), which provides world statistics updated in real time, the 
world’s population is increasing at a rate of about 150 per minute. That’s 9,000 
per hour; 216,000 per day; or 78,840,000 per year.
Although we should be clear that most Western countries have achieved 
virtually zero population growth without immigration (see the upcoming sec-
tion, “The nuclear family”), this same potent meeting of new and old cultures 
scenario is now especially at work in developing countries, where the popu-
lations are soaring to previously unimagined heights. For example, China’s 
population, by 2050, is expected to reach 1.4 billion. India’s, by 2030, will 
surpass even that — by 2050 it should be about 1.6 billion. All told, our global 
population is expected to top 9.2 billion by the midpoint of the 21st century.
However, substantial population decreases are being seen in certain areas, 
due to changes in governmental policies; the rising cost of raising children 
in industrializing, industrialized, or post-industrial societies; and women’s 
desire to work rather than only have babies. Western societies are either not 
growing or are declining in population. And part of the reason for India’s pop-
ulation overtaking China’s is because China’s population is already in decline. 
Figure 5-1 graphs these trends.
Social entrepreneurship and population issues
The coming slowdown doesn’t mean that the global population is reversing. 
No, as Figure 5-1 shows, our numbers will continue to increase over the next 
few generations, just not as rapidly. There will continue to be a huge need for 
population control measures and sexual and reproductive healthcare — and 
for innovative solutions to the problems brought on by population increase.

This area is one in which social entrepreneurs have made and will continue 
to make a difference. There will still be a need for efforts like Population 
Action International (www.populationaction.org) and Population 
Connection (www.populationconnection.org), both of which seek to 
bring our numbers into balance with our environment and help reduce global 
poverty by advocating for women’s rights and social justice issues such as 
providing access to sexual and reproductive health.
Innovator in health products: David Green
As a Schwab Fellow of the World Economic 
Forum, David Green has worked to sustainably, 
affordably, and accessibly bring medical tech-
nology and healthcare services to the poor, who 
make up two-thirds of humanity. His humanized 
capitalism or compassionate capitalism makes 
use of business production capacity and sur-
plus revenue to meet the needs of many.
For example, in 1992 Green helped establish 
Aurolab in India. As a nonprofit, Aurolab manu-
factures intraocular lenses (IOLs) which are 
implanted into the eye as a replacement lens 
during cataract surgery. Today Aurolab is one 
of the world’s largest manufacturers of IOLs 
(with 10 percent of the global market share) 
and sells its lenses for $2 to $4, whereas in 
developed countries those lenses would sell 
for $150. Just as importantly, Aurolab, under 
Green’s guidance, manufactures sutures 
and has reduced the price of ophthalmic 
sutures from $200 to $25 per box. With that, an 
enormous imbalance is beginning to be 
addressed — only 10 percent of suture 
products are sold to developing countries, 
which are home to 70 percent of the world’s 
population.

81
 Chapter 5: Using Trends to Harness the Next Big Things
 
If you’re not factoring in population numbers into your efforts, then you’re 
probably missing a big chunk of the social context that will almost surely 
affect you. In many cases, you’ll be faced with the problem of ever-expanding 
scale; needs and wants may well outpace your ability to respond — unless 
you’re prepared.
Issues Arising from the Major Trends
Globalizing science, urbanization, and population growth are gigantic forces 
shaping our collective futures. They’re so powerful they can spawn “storms” 
of change in other areas. The good news is that social entrepreneurs are lead-
ing the way in facing up to these more focused challenges.
Consumption and waste
The big three trends discussed so far are responsible for tremendous con-
sumption and waste-producing stresses that are rapidly and dramatically 
degrading our planet’s environment and ecology. Consumption and waste are 
linked by many to what U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon calls “the great-
est collective challenge we face as a human family”: climate change.
Some say consumption and waste are Western phenomena, where 15 per-
cent of the world’s population hoards 85 percent of the planet’s resources. 
Consumption and waste aren’t population issues, they claim — they’re cul-
tural greed issues.
We say yes and no to that. Not too long ago, it may have been the case. But 
with globalization, the Asian rim, Indian subcontinent, and many parts of 
Africa are all racing to jump onto the Western-style consumption bandwagon. 
Cultural greed is no longer exclusively Western. Some estimate that humanity 
would need five planet earths to support the full process. No wonder we’re 
looking longingly at our moon, Mars, and beyond. In the meantime, we need 
to keep our eye on the ball — this ball called Earth.
 
Many people are working to remind us of this truth. Here’s one example: 
Conceived by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Sydney Morning Herald 
in 2007, Earth Hour is held every year on the last Saturday of March from 
8:30 to 9:30 p.m. It asks people around the world to voluntarily turn off their 
nonessential lights and other electrical appliances for one hour. In 2009, the 
Philippines topped Earth Hour participation as 647 cities and towns and more 
than 15 million Filipinos were estimated to have joined in the hour-long lights-
off campaign to raise awareness about human energy consumption patterns 

82
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
and its link to climate change. Globally, participation in Earth Hour increased 
ten-fold from 2008 to 2009; in 2008, 400 cities participated, while in 2009, 4,000 
cities in 88 countries participated.
Some may say, “What? Turning off clocks and lights for one hour? Is this the 
best we can do in meeting the ‘greatest collective challenge’?” No, it’s not 
the best we can do, but culturally speaking it’s a hugely important step in the 
right direction, especially when we look at the phenomenal increase in Earth 
Hour participation over a short period of time.
Clearly, people are getting the message. And in large part that’s due to local, 
smaller-scale social entrepreneurs everywhere organizing families, friends, 
neighbors, communities, and businesses to hold candlelight or light-emitting 
diode (LED) parties, sell eco-friendly products for charity, or host eco-
friendly office events. For more ideas on how to start something that helps, 
search the Web for “Earth Hour party ideas.”
 
Another person who is pushing the idea of responsible consumption, trying to 
make it a cornerstone of meeting environmental challenges, is Helio Mattar, of 
the Akatu Institute for Conscious Consumption (www.akatu.org.br). Mattar 
is moving social and environmental change forward using a two-pronged 
approach. On the one hand, the Akatu Institute promotes conscious consump-
tion by demonstrating to the public how our consumer habits challenge the 
limits of the natural world and threaten life on our planet. And on the other 
hand, Mattar partners with consumer and other social organizations, govern-
ments, and investors to press for changes in the way that companies measure 
success. This is done most importantly through the Akatu Scale of Business 
Social Responsibility, a 4-category, 60-item scorecard that companies use to 
demonstrate to consumers their BSR practices.
The nuclear family
One of the most important and fascinating global population developments 
revolves around the nuclear family (parents and their children). The number 
of nuclear families has been increasing from generation to generation as 
more healthy children grow up to have families of their own. Large families 
used to be the norm because more children meant more people to help with 
the work that needed to be done. In many parts of the world, these extended 
families persist because of cultural tradition.
Yet, as global population growth is beginning to slow, family size has been 
shrinking. Two of the more important population-growth countries — China 
and India — have instituted one- and two-child policies. Women are becom-
ing more and more involved in mainstream economic activities, and the cost 

83
 Chapter 5: Using Trends to Harness the Next Big Things
of raising children in modern economies is rising. Did you know that raising a 
child to the age of 18 in Western countries costs about $300,000?
What are the implications of these troubling family trends? It seems quite 
likely that tremendous numbers of families of small sizes, coupled with 
increasing family insecurity as both parents work in low-wage economies, are 
going to dramatically push up the value of each and every child worldwide. 
More and more, children will be seen as more precious.
 
We envision, then, a world where the “pro-family” voice will become louder 
and stronger with every passing year, and social entrepreneurs will be 
in the thick of things. Any threats to the family, whether in terms of eco-
nomic, social, or environmental instability, will become more unacceptable. 
Remember the earthquake in China’s Sichuan province in 2008? Tragically, 
some 90,000 people were killed or went missing in that terrible quake. But you 
may also remember not only the normal extreme anguish but also the great 
anger of the parents of more than 5,000 schoolchildren who were also killed 
or went missing in the quake when it was revealed that the children had died 
under the collapse of poorly constructed schools in a known earthquake zone. 
We see this pro-family trend increasing worldwide, including in the U.S.
Families will continue to push for the creation of family-supportive commu-
nities and better integration into those communities in attempts to shore 
up their diminishing resources. There will be lots and lots of work — and 
support — here for family-oriented social entrepreneurs. In the case of the 
Sichuan earthquake, volunteers, led by Beijing-based artist and social entre-
preneur Ai Weiwei, have investigated, recorded, and accounted for the loss of 
children’s lives. This group’s social insight is apparent: “Once you have the 
basic facts, you know who is responsible for those kids,” Ai told CNN.
The ever-rising concerns of growing numbers of families are going to be a 
major impetus for positive social change more than at least the next couple 
of generations. Consider that families themselves are the most potent and 
fundamental socializing force shaping the hearts, minds, and practices of 
future generations. Countless small nuclear families will be enormously con-
cerned about the dehumanizing effects of misplaced, forgotten, or usurped 
ends. These families will also be quick to criticize negative urbanization and 
environmental effects.
Families will need more support and execution from governments at all 
levels. Despite their allegiances to other competing interests, such as those 
of big business, governments will likely have to attend to pro-family concerns 
and join with them in demanding far greater corporate social responsibility 
(CSR) from the private sector (which we address in the “Trends in Social 
Responsibility and Corporate Social Responsibility” section, a little later in 

84
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
this chapter). Family is, after all, the backbone of every society — and the 
voting base of every democratic one.
 
Not surprisingly, then, many social entrepreneurs are already working to pro-
tect and develop children and their families, and nurture and support commu-
nities. Here are just a couple of examples:
 
✓ Joseph Terry Williams spent his professional career helping low-income 
families. In 2007, when Williams retired, he set up a nonprofit program to 
help low-income families buy their own homes and achieve financial self-
sufficiency. The Wyoming Family Home Ownership Project (www.wywf.
org/WYFHOP.html) works with local churches and businesses 
to educate low-income families about their finances and helps them 
to contribute monthly, over two years, to a home-ownership account, 
which allows for a house down payment as well as a modest emergency 
fund. Williams says this about the project’s efforts: “This is about the 
power of local people to take action and own solutions. It is also a 
chance to change reality for a generation of children who deserve to 
grow up in a safe and stable environment, and whose futures hinge upon 
the financial stability enabled by home ownership.”
 
✓ Vera Cordeiro started Renascer Child Health Association (www.
criancarenascer.org.br/ingles/Inicial-Ing.htm) in 1991. 
At the time, she had been working in a public hospital in Rio de Janeiro. 
But Vera was dismayed when children, apparently treated successfully 
for infectious diseases, were soon returned to the hospital where they 
died from the disease because they become re-infected at home. It was 
obvious to Vera that whole families needed to be treated, not just the 
sick kids. Today Renascer furnishes families with an impressive range 
of social services, seeing approximately 1,000 people per month. The 
model is so successful that it’s currently being replicated in at least 24 
other independent centers. A further dozen or so new centers will be 
added to the network by the end of 2011.
Families, of course, have deep affiliations with at least three other vocal 
demographic groups:
 
✓ Educated youth and young adults
 
✓ Women who no longer have child-rearing responsibilities
 
✓ Older adults (including the massive baby boomer population), who are 
today healthier and more keenly aware of social and environmental 
issues than any previous similar generation
These groups will likely join with the family in championing its causes. In the 
next section we briefly consider these groups.

85
 Chapter 5: Using Trends to Harness the Next Big Things
The discerning youth and young adults of the world
From the civil rights movement, Vietnam War protests, and social move-
ments of the 1960s and early 1970s, to the Tiananmen Square massacre in 
China, to the recent pro-democracy protests in places like Myanmar and 
Iran, students continue to voice their displeasure with governments and big 
business alike. Sometimes students even shed their blood and lives for their 
causes.
Students and young people around the world are committing even further to 
positive social change. Many are counseling or talking to their peers about 
drug and alcohol abuse and addiction, safe sex and HIV/AIDS, alternatives to 
violence, poverty, staying in school, and much more.
These commitments among youth are also translating into dramatic shifts in 
professional and career choices. These days, for example, it’s increasingly 
common for students to get college and university educations in disciplines 
such as environmental science and in community, international, and sustain-
able development, among other similar fields. Educated youth are on their 
way to bettering the world in profound ways, building bridges between the 
“academy” and local communities.
 
Kjerstin Eriksson is one of the young adults to watch — and emulate. Kjerstin, 
as a 20 year-old junior studying public policy at Stanford University, founded 
Facilitating Opportunities for Refugee Growth and Empowerment (FORGE) 
in 2003. Today, FORGE is an official operating partner of the United Nations 
Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and is working in three different South African refu-
gee camps, serving 60,000 refugees.
Innovator in energy efficiency: Avery Hairston
Avery Hairston and his friends founded 
RelightNY when Avery realized how slow the 
United States has been in adopting compact 
fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs. CFLs, Avery dis-
covered, reduce the cost of electric bills, gen-
erate less heat, and last far longer than ordinary 
incandescent light bulbs. In fact, according to 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
Web site, “If every home in America replaced 
just one incandescent light bulb with an Energy 
Star–qualified CFL, it would save enough energy 
to light more than 3 million homes and prevent 
greenhouse-gas emissions equivalent to those 
of more than 800,000 cars annually.”
With these kinds of justifications in mind, and

Women, demanding their proper place
Just as students have for years been at the forefront of social change, so 
too have women. From the ones who confronted the Love Canal polluters in 
1977, to the anti–cruise missile protests of the Greenham Common Women’s 
Peace Camp in the 1980s, to the women who blocked MacMillan Bloedel from 
clearcutting Clayoquot Sound — the dissenting voices of women have been, 
and continue to be, unflinching. Women, as the deeply socialized bearers of 
the caring ethic, understand and respond when family and community are 
threatened.
Boomer power
As families have fewer children, and life expectancy increases (U.S. males 
are now living, on average, 75 years, only 5 years less than their female coun-
terparts), older adults will make up a larger share of their societies. In 2006, 
those 65 and over numbered 500 million. By 2030, more than 1 billion of the 
world’s population, or one in eight people, are estimated to be in that age 
category.
In Western societies, the graying phenomenon will be largely the result of 
aging baby boomers — in the United States alone, boomers comprise the 77 
million people born between 1946 and 1964. Demographers have been franti-
cally waving their arms in the air about this phenomenon for some time now.
We need to catch on: Boomers are the largest generation in human history. 
Imagine the good that could come from encouraging and supporting their 
civic engagement. The same opportunity awaits many other boomer societ-
ies around the world. What a favorable moment for social entrepreneurs to 
leverage their skills and philosophy!
Innovator in young women’s rights: Olga Murray
Olga Murray of Sausalito, California, is an 
80-something on a mission. That mission? 
Through her social enterprise, Nepalese Youth 
Opportunity Foundation, Olga is trying to end the 
kamlari system in Nepal, which sees thousands 
of young girls every year sold into bonded ser-
vitude by their poor parents. NYOF’s method of 
ending kamlari is perhaps a little unusual, but 
it works: The foundation simply offers each 
family a piglet or a goat if the family allows a 
daughter to stay home and receive an education. 
The exchange works because the animals are 
easy to keep, and can ultimately be sold for 
more money than might be received from their 
daughter’s labor.
NYOF’s efforts are paying off on a national 
level as well. The foundation’s Web site (www.
nyof.org) recently announced a major vic-
tory in its campaign to free Nepalese girls from 
servitude. After much lobbying, the Nepalese 
government pledged $1.6 million toward elimi-
nating the kamlari system and educating those 
young girls who’ve been sold into bondage.

 Chapter 5: Using Trends to Harness the Next Big Things
 
Boomers are a bit of an enigma. They’re renowned for their independence, 
entrepreneurial work ethic, and consuming habits. But they’re far less likely 
than their parents (Tom Brokaw’s “Greatest Generation,” which battled the 
Great Depression, fought in World War II and the Korean War, and built up the 
Western industrial world) to involve themselves in volunteer activities. Some 
estimates claim that somewhat less than one in three baby boomers plan to 
give back in terms of community service after retirement.
 
This lack of boomer interest in community service might be due to a few factors:
 
✓ Boomers and other older adults may see a serious lack of resources 
available to support their involvement. If boomers were to start engag-
ing in community services, many agencies would be scrambling to 
handle the influx. Perhaps, sensing the lack of infrastructure to facilitate 
their involvement, and not wanting to face endless frustration, boomers 
are opting out before even joining. (Charlotte Holstein would certainly 
agree with this idea, as we explain in the nearby sidebar “Innovator in 
local sustainability: Charlotte Holstein.”)
 
✓ The global economic recession of the late 2000s has also eroded many 
boomers’ retirement funds dramatically and forced them to continue 
working into their planned retirement.
 
✓ Many boomers see themselves as self-starters, preferring to work on 
their own rather than through agencies as volunteers.
Now, somebody, maybe you, can step up and take advantage of this latent, 
untapped talent.
Swamping governments
It goes without saying that governments, especially democratic ones, will be 
the target of the demands issuing from families, students, women, and older 
adults. There’s a rising sense that people are questioning where the heck 
we’re all going — concerns over ethics, transparency, and sustainability are 
a huge part of that — and that governments should either facilitate that pro-
cess or get out of the way.
In the United States, the Obama Administration, with its United We Serve 
nationwide campaign, has decided to facilitate that process. Perhaps it will 
model real governmental-civic partnership to the rest of the world. The 
administration is calling on all Americans to participate in the nation’s recov-
ery and renewal by serving in their communities.
 
There is even a very explicit place for the social entrepreneur in this scheme 
of things. If you have a service opportunity of your own, you can register it 
with www.serve.gov and invite others to join.

88
Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
Trends in Social Responsibility and 
Corporate Social Responsibility
If governments are getting the message and aligning themselves with the 
grass roots and communities in a general insistence that we all need to prac-
tice social responsibility (an admittedly hopeful but debatable statement), 
then it should come as no surprise that business should have similar expec-
tations placed upon it. No one can or should be exempt. We don’t anticipate 
that the calls for increasing CSR will quiet down anytime soon, regardless of 
whether that responsibility for the impact of business activity on the envi-
ronment, consumers, employees, communities, stakeholders, and all other 
members of the public is ultimately self-regulated. In fact, a recent Institute 
for Corporate Culture Affairs (ICCA) CSR Globe survey of the top 100 multi-
national corporations indicates that 49 percent of the companies have CSR 
governance systems in place (www.csrglobe.com/pdf/Report.pdf).
Not everyone buys CSR as a reality. Some people believe that CSR is a farce, 
nothing but a public-relations campaign — all talk, no action. Others in the 
business community insist that the attempt to link CSR to long-term profit-
ability is pie-in-the-sky. They claim it can’t be achieved because it contradicts 
the bottom line, or is easily superseded by the imperative to turn a profit and 
keep shareholders happy.
Innovator in local sustainability: Charlotte Holstein
You might want to follow Charlotte Holstein’s 
inspiring example. In 1998, Charlotte estab-
lished Forging Our Community’s United Strength 
(F.O.C.U.S.; www.focussyracuse.org), a 
nonprofit designed to engage local citizens and 
organizations in the major economic, social, 
and environmental issues facing the Syracuse, 
New York, region.
After much public discussion involving literally 
thousands of people, almost 90 goals relating 
to building sustainable community were devel-
oped and put into action. Among them, F.O.C.U.S. 
created a no-cost ten-week Citizens’ Academy 
that would boost community member participa-
tion and help folks recognize how government 
actually functions. Related to that, F.O.C.U.S. is 
actively involved in partnering with Syracuse 
University’s College for Human Development and 
Health Professions, the New York State Office for 
the Aging, and various national agencies in pre-
paring communities nationwide for the economic 
and social impact of baby boomer retirement and 
civic involvement.

89
 Chapter 5: Using Trends to Harness the Next Big Things
Yet, more and more businesses, governments, and communities believe that 
CSR is
 
✓ An absolute social necessity, not open to debate anymore — an idea 
whose time has come
 
✓ Ultimately good for the bottom line, even though the positive results 
may not be immediately evident
It seems inevitable that the heavy hitters in the corporate world will have 
increasing expectations placed on them by humanity at large and its gov-
ernments, to join with everyone else in achieving social responsibility. And 
if those corporations would serve as role models to everyone else on the 
supply chain and pass on those expectations as well, then we may well be on 
the way toward a better world.
 
The final sections here in this chapter discuss a few important ways in which 
CSR is being realized. Every one of them offers you, the social entrepreneur, 
many potential avenues for involvement. (For more information on CSR, see 
Chapter 8.)
Social impact assessments
One of CSR’s most straightforward applications is the social impact assess-
ment (SIA). SIAs are, as the name suggests, attempts to determine the impact 
on human populations before, during, and after development projects.
SIAs are tools that everyone should be picking up and using. It’s incumbent 
on businesses to move beyond the bottom-line-only mentality and consider 
the impact of their ventures on communities. Just because you can make a 
profit doesn’t mean that you should.
Remember the bit about how means shouldn’t govern ends? The SIA pro-
vides a way to determine whether we should, for example:
 
✓ Build the Three Gorges Dam Project (the largest dam in the world) on 
China’s populated Yangtze River
 
✓ Expand one of the world’s busiest airports, Heathrow Airport, in London
 
✓ Open up South Africa to tourism
 
✓ Bring oil down from the Arctic through the Mackenzie River Valley
 
✓ Introduce predatory Nile perch stock for commercial fishing purposes in 
Lake Victoria, Africa

Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
Ethical investing
Most people would love to invest in a startup company that would pay us 
handsome dividends as it grew! But at what cost to society and personal 
integrity are we willing to do so if the company operates unethically? The fol-
lowing types of investing attempt to address this issue:
 
✓ Socially Responsible Investing (SRI): SRI is about investing while follow-
ing your values and ends up being a defensive posture against so-called 
“sin stocks” — stocks from companies that are in some way thought to 
be involved in unethical or immoral activities.
 
✓ Sustainable Investing (SI): SI is about proactively investing in triple-
bottom-line stocks — ones that promote environmental, social, and prof-
itable ends.
Both vehicles allow investors to invest in companies that are socially respon-
sible and promote positive change even as they go about making money. 
(Chapter 8 discusses this topic in a bit more detail.)
Philanthrocapitalism
Wealthy people often want to pitch in, and tax incentives are usually a big 
reason why. People with deep pockets are finding new ways to dramatically 
redefine the relationship between capitalism and philanthropy, ushering in a 
new age of philanthrocapitalism (venture capital financing, high-tech business 
management, market economics, and an expectation of return on investment 
either over the long term or through secondary benefits such as corporate 
recognition, as these apply to social programs and philanthropic causes).
When, in 2006, Warren Buffett donated $40 billion of his holdings to the Bill 
and Melinda Gates Foundation, already valued at $37.6 billion, Buffett and 
Gates showed the world only a glimpse of philanthrocapitalism’s financial 
might. However, there is a great debate today about the role of philan-
throcapitalism in making the world a better place. Business interests and 
democracy have long had a tenuous relationship, and some people are 
understandably suspicious of philanthrocapitalism’s motivations, arguing 
that it gives the wealthy even more power over the lives of others and the 
policies that govern them.
But even the philanthrocapitalists — at least the good ones — are humble 
in assessing the place of their practice in the grand scheme of things. The 
founder of eBay, prominent philanthrocapitalist Pierre Omidyar, has said, “I 
don’t believe there is a for-profit answer to everything, but if for-profit capi-
tal can do more good than it does today, foundations can concentrate their 
resources where they’re most needed.”

91
 Chapter 5: Using Trends to Harness the Next Big Things
 
How should social entrepreneurs go about forging productive relationships 
with this new philanthropy? You need to determine whether you need philan-
throcapitalism and in precisely what way. Keep in mind that pursuing profit 
should be, first and foremost, for the purposes of sustaining the social enter-
prise. Only after that base is covered should profit flow back to the venture 
funders. And if it doesn’t, it doesn’t. At that point, as Bill Gates himself once 
pointed out, it may have to be enough for philanthrocapitalists to be content 
with seeing their return in terms of positive social recognition. Chapter 8 talks 
more about venture philanthropy in the context of funding social entrepre-
neurial activities.
Microcredit and microfinance
Western Banks have, for eons, been reluctant to lend money to the world’s 
poor, citing concerns over the lack of collateral and entrepreneurial ethic. 
Luckily for the world, Muhammad Yunus challenged those patronizing 
assumptions — and jointly won the Nobel Prize in 2006, with the Grameen 
Bank he established, for doing so — by developing the notions of microcredit 
and microfinance, making very small loans (microloans) available to the poor 
and otherwise assisting them with a wider range of financial services (micro-
finance) so that they can engage in entrepreneurial enterprises and conse-
quently lift themselves out of poverty. (For more on this remarkable social 
entrepreneurial innovation, see the nearby “Innovator in affordable business 
credit: Muhammad Yunus” sidebar). Kiva (www.kiva.org) has taken the 
microloan idea a creative step further by allowing individuals to personally 
loan money to low-income entrepreneurs.
Open access and open source
One final trend is the movement toward open access (equal access to infor-
mation) and open source (equal opportunities for production). This may not 
be a completely new phenomenon but rather an extension of a long-standing 
trend in the way that societies govern themselves. That is, once upon a time, 
violence in the hands of elites was the key to social control and order. But 
these days, after generations of internal strife, the tendency is to achieve 
these same outcomes through equitable, widespread, nonviolent democratic 
dialogue (open access) and participation (open source).
It’s only a very short hop from these historical developments to the prosumer 
movement. Here, consumers achieve an “open access” of sorts to businesses 
for a couple of reasons. Either they are sophisticated enough — professional-
like in their knowledge — that their consumer demand actually shapes supply 
(as with prosumer digital cameras), or they’re actively involved in the design

Part I: An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship 
Innovator in affordable business credit: 
Muhammad Yunus
As a young economics professor at Bangladesh’s 
Chittagong University, Muhammad Yunus 
was dismayed because his knowledge of eco-
nomics meant nothing to those in Bangladesh 
suffering from widespread famine and poverty. 
Villagers were borrowing from loan sharks, and 
it wasn’t uncommon for defaulters to become 
enslaved.
While visiting the village of Jobra, Junus made 
a list of 42 people who, all together, owed no 
more than $27. He gave each of them the money 
they owed, asking only that they concentrate 
on their work and repay him when they could. 
Later, Yunus served as guarantor for a larger 
loan to the villagers. It was not charity, not a 
handout. It was a hand up to those with an 
entrepreneurial spirit who were being system-
atically denied the small-business basic oppor-
tunities necessary to develop their ideas.
Grameen Bank loans, by Western standards, 
are usually tiny, often in the neighborhood of 
$50 to $100. But with the help of a local network 
of supporters who serve as loan “collateral” — 
in the sense that they cooperate to ensure that 
individuals repay their loans — these financial 
boosts are enough to get people started while 
making credit a basic human right. But do the 
people ever repay these loans? Repayment 
rates typically are more than 95 percent. Today, 
Yunus and Grameen Bank are leading defend-
ers of the global poor, having loaned out more 
than $5.1 billion to 5.3 million people.
and production of goods, although not as staff. Nudie Foods in Australia (www.
nudie.com.au), for example, has developed a close, even interactive, continu-
ing dialogue with its customers that blurs the boundary between the two enti-
ties. The focus is on sharing a passion for mutually accomplishing something 
different and meaningful with fruit — yes, fruit — including developing and 
playing a new online game like “Bananarama Drama,” browsing interactively 
through the company story, suggesting new ideas or recipes for fruit smooth-
ies, providing “Nudie addict” testimonials, and much more.
From there, it’s not too far an additional hop to “open source” research, devel-
opment, and production of goods and services, whereby the public actually 
produces the goods it consumes. The open-source philosophy seeks, as much as 
possible, to replace rigid corporate organizational hierarchies and exclusive own-
ership circles with fluid communities of owning, producing, informal networks.
Open source, then, is not limited to Linux-type software, which today makes 
up so much of the world’s computing infrastructure. It’s about how the 
empowerment of software communication — the ability to make words do 
things in the world — is viewed by global citizens as a free (economically 
and politically speaking) birthright for all humanity. And with that, of course, 
open source becomes a political manifesto for a new, collaborative, and 
hopeful way of doing things that just might help us meet challenges we face.

Establishing Your 
Organization

In this part . . .
S
o you have some idea of how social entrepreneurship 
works, and how others approach it. But how do you 
start?
Chapter 6 identifies the core types of social entrepreneur-
ial organizations and offers advice on finding your niche. 
In Chapter 7, we tackle the important issue of initial plan-
ning in the enterprise. We address the question of 
whether to aim for profits in your enterprise in Chapter 8. 
The tricky but common problem of funding nonprofits is 
the subject of Chapter 9. Chapter 10 rounds out this part 
with a discussion of creating your brand and identity — 
the face you show the world, which can affect everything 
else.

Finding Your Focus: 
Civil Society’s Many Faces
In This Chapter

▶ Checking out groups promoting family and youth issues
▶ Looking into women’s and minorities’ organizations
▶ Discovering poverty, humanitarian, and development organizations
▶ Greening the planet with environmental enterprises
I
f you’re anxious to get started but you haven’t fixed on an exact direction 
yet, this chapter is for you. Here we offer a simplified map of a very large 
and rapidly expanding territory.
Social entrepreneurs and the enterprises they start are an important part of a 
larger social phenomenon known as civil society (a sector of volunteer fellow-
ship and society building that exists outside the relatively controlling state 
and business sectors). Our hope is that briefly outlining the efforts of a large 
number of civil-society organizations will suggest avenues for you to begin 
exploring in your own enterprise.
This chapter is organized into six very broad, though not exhaustive, areas 
for social entrepreneurs to move into:
 
✓ Service, community, and social organizations: This is a general 
umbrella category for organizations that are peopled by volunteer mem-
bers who provide gifts of friendly assistance, either through hands-on 
involvement or by raising money for other organizations. Examples 
include Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, local community associations plan-
ning for the future of their neighborhoods, and the United Way. These 
affiliations are the pillars of civil society.

96
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
 
✓ Health and wellness organizations: These are organizations focused on 
improving health and alleviating health-related issues. Examples include 
elder-abuse hotlines, organ transplant peer-support groups, or jogging 
clubs that share healthy eating tips.
 
✓ Family, children’s, and youth organizations: These organizations 
include the YMCA and YWCA, social activity programs for preschoolers 
in a community hall, and countless other religious establishments.
 
✓ Women’s and minorities’ organizations: In this category, we include 
groups such as the American Association of University Women, Pacific 
and Asian Women’s Forum, and local chapters of the NAACP.
 
✓ Poverty, humanitarian aid, and development: Organizations in this area 
include those promoting advocacy for low- and moderate-income families; 
the National Indian Youth Leadership Project, which attempts to alleviate 
rural poverty; and groups such as the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks 
Foundation, which preserves historic buildings and neighborhoods.
 
✓ Environmental organizations: These organizations defend the environ-
ment from threats on all fronts. Examples include Friends of the Fox 
River Environmental Coalition, the Illinois Recycling Association, and 
America’s Clean Water Foundation.
 
As you read this chapter and reflect on the six broad areas we cover, start 
creating some goals for yourself. What would success look like to you? For 
example, if you’re environmentally inclined, which natural waterways or 
watersheds around you desperately need cleaning or restoration? For more 
help with goals as well as vision and mission statements, see Chapter 7.
Service, Community, and 
Social Organizations
Countless service, community, and social organizations (SCSOs) can be found 
all over the world. What do they all do? More than ever before, they work 
toward one big idea that can be summed up in two words: service delivery, by 
which we mean the provision of various kinds of human services.
In generations gone by, such organizations concentrated on providing local 
voluntarily organized benefits, self-help, or mutual aid (in the form of relief 
assistance). The Freemasons are a classic example of an SCSO. With obscure, 
secretive origins in the early 17th century, today the Freemasons still enjoy 
a membership estimated at around 5 million, including just under 2 million 
in the United States and half a million in England, Scotland, and Ireland. 
That old idea of service, then, is still around. (If you’re curious about the 
Freemasons, check out Freemasons For Dummies, by Christopher Hodapp 
[Wiley].)

97
 Chapter 6: Finding Your Focus: Civil Society’s Many Faces
But these days, with governments and business professionals having a tough 
time living up to their own human service mandates, modern SCSOs are about 
much more than being “neighborly.” They’re recruiting themselves to col-
laboratively ensure that social justice reaches as many people as possible in 
practical ways. These organizations see their task as pulling society toward 
delivering services that are socially just, while providing ways to get there that 
value collaboration and recognize the importance of being pragmatic.
You can find SCSOs working in all the areas we look at in this chapter, too, 
and there are almost endless possibilities for social entrepreneurs to create 
similar organizations in any of these areas.
Our first examples combine issues relevant to both minorities and health and 
wellness (two areas covered in more detail later in this chapter).
 
Of those surviving a prolonged critical illness, more than 50 percent die 
within the next year, and 90 percent of those have never made it home to live 
independently.
Believing that “no one should end the journey of life alone, afraid, or in 
pain,” the Nevada Multicultural End-of-Life Care Coalition (NMELC; www.nv
multiculturalcoalition.org) provides a forum for organizations and 
community leaders to improve access and education on end-of-life healthcare 
services for diverse, multicultural communities. NMELC provides forums for 
resource sharing, continuing education for Nevada healthcare providers, 
giving members the opportunity to network and collaborate, and developing 
strategic plans and implementing activities that directly involve or relate to 
the members and their respective organizations.
The clear takeaways here for social entrepreneurs are that end-of-life issues 
should not be lost in discussions about healthcare spending. They should, 
instead, be discussed openly and commonly within society. And more pri-
vately, end-of-life discussions should always fully include the patient and 
their personal and family belief systems, but this is an especially neglected 
consideration for minorities. The role of the physician is simply to assist 
informed decision making by providing the best available information. 
Finally, whether patients should be dying in hospitals after recovering from 
a critical illness needs to become much more of a community and national 
debate.
 
A person cannot survive long without water — only around 72 hours — 
whereas he can survive without food for almost a month. Almost half the 
people in the world live in water-scarce countries, although on average there 
is enough water for everyone.
The University of Malawi’s Lucy Chipeta notes that in Blantyre City, Malawi, 
Africa, the urban slum areas of Mbayani and Ntopwa were faced by a water 
crisis in 2007. Water scarcity meant that all available water was filthy, unsani-
tary surface water. This crisis left poor women and children at great risk of 

98
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
disease and death because they couldn’t afford the firewood needed to boil 
the water (and kill the deadly organisms living in it). The Blantyre Water 
Board couldn’t meet the cost of financing water-main extensions throughout 
the city, so it encouraged poor communities to raise their own funds through 
membership drives, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), donors, and 
other funding agencies in order get water into their areas.
Because Malawi is one of the world’s poorest countries, it comes as no sur-
prise that, despite these efforts, the installed water mains were plagued by 
substandard materials, poor workmanship, leaks, and low water pressure. 
To deal with the problem of unsanitary surface water at the source, Habitat 
for Humanity works in partnership with local communities and governments 
to build simple, decent houses — including latrines. Habitat provides all the 
materials and skilled labor, but not as a giveaway; locals repay Habitat for the 
costs, and that money is then put into a revolving fund that stays in the com-
munity to build more houses and latrines.
Obviously, much more can be done in Blantyre and many other water-scarce 
and poor parts of the world. A very good start to making a difference is to 
make sure that your community observes and celebrates World Water Day 
on March 22 each year. Also, don’t be fooled by claims that desalination 
will solve the problem of global water scarcity. The technology is currently 
energy intensive, increases emissions, and damages coastal and river habi-
tats. Social entrepreneurs should direct their efforts to developing and pro-
moting appropriate and sustainable water catchment (water conserving) and 
water-filtration technologies.
Another area of interest in this context would be diaspora (scattered) popu-
lations who emigrate out of their homelands. The three largest diaspora 
migrations have been the British (more than 50 million), Chinese (about 20 
million), and East Indian (about 20 million). These and other immigrants typi-
cally maintain contact with their homelands, travel back and forth, and send 
money home (an act known as remittance). In other words, they’re trying to 
keep up participation in their original social, cultural, and political lives back 
in their home countries. Social entrepreneurs can make that experience more 
positive at both ends.
In the new country, social entrepreneurs can strengthen ethnic communities 
against financial uncertainty (often caused by sending remittances home), 
racism, family difficulties, and so on.
When diaspora communities are more viable, they can better give back. And 
what can they give back to? You might be surprised to know that immigrant 
remittances are an extremely important source of development aid. Not only 
does money go to families back home, but it also goes to villages, communi-
ties, and larger regions. The World Bank calculates that in 2007 emigrants 
sent $251 billion back home. Kathleen Newland, a director at the Migration 
Policy Institute (www.migrationpolicy.org) in Washington, D.C., reports 
that many governments, including those in Mexico, the Philippines, and 

99
 Chapter 6: Finding Your Focus: Civil Society’s Many Faces
countries in Latin America and Africa, exploit remittances to the fullest. The 
Mexican government’s Tres por Uno (Three for One) fund-matching initiative 
is a shining example. In 2005, local associations raised some $20 million for 
development, which other levels of government matched with another $60 
million.
 
What this means is there are social entrepreneurial opportunities to close 
the circle in the homeland. The Norwegian government is one entity that has 
this figured out. It’s making Norway’s Pakistani diaspora part of its aid strat-
egy. Through Pilot Project Pakistan, the Norwegian Agency for Development 
Cooperation is collaborating with Norwegian-Pakistani organizations and 
various NGOs to make sure aid flows to approved projects that make the emi-
grants proud. This is certainly a model that could be emulated with other dias-
pora populations, working local-to-local, with or without formal government 
involvement.
 
Somewhere in the middle there may also be social entrepreneurial oppor-
tunities. In late 2009, the Italian Mando soldi a casa (“I send money home”) 
Web site (www.mandasoldiacasa.it/english) was unveiled at the 
International Conference on Remittances, held in Rome. The Web site allows 
Italy’s immigrants to send money to their country of origin using a process 
that is clear and transparent. Because this is likely a first-time offering, it’s 
clear that much more social entrepreneurial work could certainly be done in 
this area.
 
Other groups are actively looking to collaborate with grass-roots organiza-
tions in order to meet, justly and practically, human needs:
 
✓ Healthcare professionals: Counseling psychologists, for example, 
are increasingly recognizing that mental-health interventions must be 
bundled with social integration that also pays attention to the need 
for advocacy, social action, and social change. Some psychologists 
are in the early stages of doing just that and could probably benefit 
from alliances with social entrepreneurs who might be more familiar 
with local social terrain — especially as it applies to the complex reali-
ties of stigma. Perhaps you’re one of those social entrepreneurs? For 
more guidance in this area, we recommend having a look at the Ashoka 
Foundation’s 2009 Changemaker report titled “Rethinking Mental Health: 
A Discovery Framework,” available at http://is.gd/5GhHz.
 
✓ Corporations, colleges, and universities: Corporate social responsibil-
ity (CSR), through such vehicles as employee volunteer programs, is 
fast becoming popular in business circles (as we point out in Chapters 
5 and 8). Somewhat related to CSR is higher education’s concept of 
service learning (a method of teaching, learning, and reflecting on 
how meaningful community service can combine with educational 
classroom instruction). Both are structured programs that promote 
social engagement and both are typically seen as benefitting the par-
ticipants, employers, and recipient communities. As such, they may 
prove to be fertile collaborators for creative social entrepreneurs. A 

100
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
forward-thinking example of this kind of attempt to link academia and 
community is Belmont University’s recently opened Center for Social

✓ Philanthropists: These days, philanthropists are looking to do more 
than just donate money to nonprofits. They want to increase their com-
munity involvement and even invest in community initiatives. One pos-
sible outcome here is public-private partnerships (PPPs), which are 
designed to empower undercapitalized communities.
 
 Social entrepreneurs such as R. K. Misra show how PPPs can work. 
In 2005, when he turned 40, Misra left the corporate world in order to 
concentrate on giving back to his home country of India. Through his 
social-entrepreneurial efforts, Misra advocates for and succeeds with 
instituting PPPs in the areas of infrastructure and job creation, work-
ing in collaboration with various levels of government and industry. 
To catch up with R. K. Misra’s efforts, check out his blog at http://
rajendramisra.blogspot.com.
 
✓ Trade unions: Trade unions — very much aware of their fading political 
status in Western societies — are anxious to partner with other commu-
nity organizations and social movements, especially on issues of social 
justice and service delivery. This is extremely evident in the area of 
healthcare reform, where the unions are battling the “marketization” of 
healthcare, raising awareness on the issue, and attempting to mobilize 
resistance to the idea.
Health and Wellness Organizations
Broadly speaking, health refers to the general condition of a person in all 
aspects, which the World Health Organization (WHO), in 1948, defined as “a 
state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the 
absence of disease or infirmity.”
But when you consider the common modern uses of the terms health and 
wellness, it turns out that, often, people are really talking about health manage-
ment (the kinds of things that doctors and nurses and other practitioners do 
to make us better) or wellness as associated with wellness management and 
optimizing our health the best we can. How big a deal is wellness management? 
According to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lifestyle — which 
is a wellness management issue, not a health management issue — accounts 
for more than half of all premature deaths in adults in the United States. When 
social entrepreneurs (or health professionals) intervene, then, in many areas of 
human functioning, they can do so in one of two basic ways:
 
✓ They can avert or remove crisis conditions and restore things to some 
minimum acceptable standard.

101
 Chapter 6: Finding Your Focus: Civil Society’s Many Faces
 
✓ They can go well beyond that and push toward the fullness of human 
flourishing and positive outcomes, which are valuable in their own right, 
but also useful in terms of the economics of prevention. After all, an 
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
 
The concept of flourishing can apply to many of the ideas discussed in this 
chapter. Families, children and youth, men and women, minorities, the poor . . . 
all these groups want to be “flourishing,” don’t they? Social entrepreneurs can 
help people flourish in all these areas.
 
There is a further aspect to health and wellness managements these days: 
Both are being heavily commoditized (turned into commodities that turn a 
profit). Something’s going on with health and wellness that might be laying the 
foundation for how we deal with other human challenges in the future. This 
transformation is something for social entrepreneurs to think about because it 
may challenge many of our most sacred assumptions about how we help one 
another.
Health and wellness management becoming commoditized can be seen very 
easily in one booming area of business: medical tourism. For a price, the folks 
at corporations such as WorldMedAssist (www.worldmedassist.com) can 
set patients up in places such as India for procedures — such as high-quality 
liver transplants or disk replacements — which patients otherwise would 
have to wait and wait and wait for at home, perhaps in vain.
Everyone is jumping onto this bandwagon. At a 2009 MedHealth & Wellness 
three-day international exhibition, some 65 companies from 17 countries 
touted their ability to make top-notch privatized medical tourist services 
available to consumers around the world.
Wellness is also huge business. Wellness entities are contracting out to health 
plans and convincing corporations that investment in employee wellness 
should be at the top of their agendas, along with commitments to financial 
and organizational health. Alere (www.matria.com), for example, is a market 
leader in the United States for delivering comprehensive health-enhancement 
(wellness) programs to top corporations and health plans. Employers are more 
involved in promoting worker health than ever before. Some 90 percent have 
some sort of health initiative for employees, ranging from a smoke-free work-
place to education and training to health risk assessment.
 
Where do these trends leave you as the social entrepreneur? Well, you should 
get involved! Can you set up the next WorldMedAssist or Alere? All over the 
booming commercialization, privatization, and individualization trends in 
health, we’re starting to see services, whether for-profit or not, coming to the 
fore. These services are offering anxious consumers the kind of critical infor-
mation they need in order to make informed and intelligent decisions that are 
right for them.

FitSense Australia, a corporate wellness provider, suggests that there are ben-
efits to customers receiving regular e-mails containing “specific exercise and 
nutrition recommendations.” Given what we talk about in Chapter 11, on col-
laborative learning using social networking and social media, it only makes 
sense that such a service could easily be picked up by social entrepreneurs 
like you.
 
How about setting up something like what Outdoors Queensland (www.qorf.
org.au) is up to? Its Web site is a one-stop shop for anybody interested in 
the outdoors in Queensland, Australia — which fits in perfectly with the idea 
of wellness. As a subsidiary of Queensland Outdoor Recreation Federation 
(QORF), any profits generated by Outdoors Queensland are returned to QORF 
to further its aims and objectives.
Although privatization has its benefits in terms of getting health and 
wellness services and products to market, history shows that “buyer 
beware” — especially in matters relating to well-being — is wise counsel. 
Someone representing consumers, or affiliations of consumers, will need to 
stand up for reasonable regulation, equity, and community concerns, typi-
cally the purview of health promotion. Professionally, organizations such as 
the National Wellness Institute (www.nationalwellness.org) play this 
role. Organizations that develop independent quality standards for the well-
ness market might also provide social entrepreneurs with a citizen-oriented 
template that can be applied to all of health.
Family, Children’s, and 
Youth Organizations
No other social institution is changing as quickly or as fundamentally as 
the family. One of the most compelling changes in the family has been the 
increase in dual-wage-earner families, to the point where most American fami-
lies depend on both husband and wife to be family breadwinners. Very close 
to 60 percent of the 121 million women over the age of 16 are working or 
looking for work, and women are projected to make up 47 percent of the U.S. 
labor force by 2016. Otherwise, with the numbers of single-parent, blended, 
cohabiting, and same sex-parent families continuing to rise, people’s percep-
tions of what constitutes a family continue to change.
For these reasons and more, the state of the family is a hot topic. Some would 
go so far as to say that today’s Western family — long considered by social 
scientists to be the backbone of Western society — is threatened with extinc-
tion. That may be overkill, but the prospects for children, who are the future 
of every society, look disconcerting.

103
 Chapter 6: Finding Your Focus: Civil Society’s Many Faces
So what’s happening? Families are changing because the world out there is 
putting tremendous pressure on them. In an increasingly expensive and eco-
nomically unstable world, single-family wage is a luxury of the distant past. 
For the sake of family economic stability, most families require that both 
partners work — and work hard. Single-parent families, especially those that 
are the product of divorce or death, become more prone to experiencing 
poverty.
Many other factors are affecting the family as well. Cultural influences pro-
moting heightened individualism and consumerism among parents and their 
children, along with increasingly hectic schedules, are leading to families 
torn and distracted by many competing demands. Pervasive technology 
such as e-mail, online chat, cellphones, and so on mean that the boundar-
ies between public life and private family life are becoming more flexible, 
blurred, and open. And when families look beyond themselves to formal 
social supports, they find less and less assistance, thanks in large part to 
government cuts not only to public services but also to community and faith-
based services.
 
If you’d like to get involved in helping families, you’ll find no shortage of chal-
lenges and opportunities.
Before we look at particular examples, we want to mention a basic organiz-
ing device you may find useful. As with the health and wellness distinction 
we mentioned — between crisis and restoration versus flourishing and 
prevention — assistance to families and children follows a similar pattern 
of intervention: crisis and restoration on the one hand, and ongoing commit-
ments to a better future on the other. Although the bulk of SCSO work tends 
to focus on deficits and problems (crises and restorations) within the family 
and with children and youth, some important attention is now being paid to 
what is being called positive family, child, and youth development — another 
way of talking about flourishing. So, aside from the traditional emphases and 
opportunities, new ones are opening up for social entrepreneurs in the area 
of family, children, and youth welfare.
 
All that said, a good number of SCSOs do concern themselves with families 
who are in difficulty or crisis. There are few things more difficult for a family 
than homelessness, for example. Homeless Families Foundation (www.
home lessfamiliesfoundation.org) is a family shelter in Columbus, 
Ohio. Homeless families can benefit from shelter and support services and 
a tutoring and enrichment program for their children. HFF provides shelter, 
support, stability, and nurturing for homeless families as they transition to 
permanent housing.
For families in severe crisis, SCSOs rally with a range of service delivery 
options ranging from therapeutic foster services to in-home interventions 
to behavioral health services, adoption services, training and education ser-
vices, and more.

Specialized Alternatives for Families and Youth (www.safy.org) is a non-
profit leader in the emergency services area and is expanding into communi-
ties across the nation by providing programs and services that go beyond 
therapeutic foster care.
 
Sometimes the help for families in difficulty can be quite subtle: Santa’s Four 
Helpers (www.santafourhelpers.com) is a registered charity that puts on 
events for children from limited-income and single-parent families. Since 2005, 
the organization has been partnering with others such as the Boy’s & Girl’s 
Club, Children’s Aid Society, Our Kids Count, and the Dilico Ojibway Child and 
Family Services.
The idea of positive family development is about more than seeing individual 
families flourish — it’s also about seeing communities flourish.
 
Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.; www.great-online.
org) is an important U.S. Department of Justice initiative (not a social enter-
prise or NGO). The program’s commitment to immunizing families and com-
munities against delinquency, youth violence, and gang membership provides 
the strongest possible legitimacy for any social entrepreneur wanting to do 
something similar within the larger community.
 
Houston Family Foundation (www.houstonfamilyfoundation.org), a 
Christ-centered organization dedicated to helping parents raise children and 
build families with virtue, would, in theory, fill that “larger community” bill, as 
would almost every religious organization.
The existence of organizations such as we’ve profiled previously suggests 
many opportunities for social entrepreneurs to get involved proactively in 
community, family, child, and youth development before relationship trou-
bles spiral out of control.
 
On the “difficulty and crisis” side of service delivery to children and youth 
are many more possibilities. Aside from more direct interventions, advocates 
serve an important middle-man role, giving a voice to voiceless children. Here 
are some examples:
 
✓ Kentucky Youth Advocates (www.kyyouth.org) is a nonpartisan, non-
profit children’s advocacy organization. Believing that Kentucky’s youth 
deserve the opportunities and resources necessary to ensure their 
productive development and health, KYA works on behalf of Kentucky’s 
children with the state legislature, the community, and the media.
 
✓ Because being hospitalized can be a traumatic experience for children 
and youth, Lollipop Theater Network (http://lollipoptheater.
org), a nonprofit organization, brings the enchantment of new-release 
movies to children in hospital beds.

105
 Chapter 6: Finding Your Focus: Civil Society’s Many Faces
 
✓ Foster-care placement can also be a stressful ordeal. Kids in care might 
be better helped with a more holistic approach than the typical state-
run process. Children Youth and Family Collaborative (www.cyfcla.
org) works collaboratively with youth-centered organizations to link 
volunteers with more than 4,000 foster and at-risk youth in Los Angeles 
and Compton, California. This holistic approach enriches the lives of the 
young participants and benefits academic and social development.
 
Within the concept of positive youth development, the key is to look at chil-
dren and youth not as problems to solve, but rather as assets to develop.
 
The Laidlaw Foundation (www.laidlawfdn.org) promotes positive youth 
development by engaging youth in activities related to the arts, the environ-
ment, and the community. As part of that process, the foundation funds, 
through catalyst and project grants, youth-led initiatives for social change.
Women’s and Minorities’ Organizations
 
Why are we grouping women with ethnic minorities? Well, although women 
make up roughly half the world’s population, their traditional subordination 
and historically distinct identity have earned their classification by social sci-
entists as a minority group.
Some of the difficult issues facing women today — which occupy SCSOs — are
 
✓ Human and employment rights and equity (including concerns for wom-
en’s safety and exploitation)
 
✓ Health rights and equity (including sexual and reproductive health and 
rights)
 
✓ Women’s place in social, cultural, and environmental development (with 
a strong interest in developing women’s leadership and entrepreneurial 
capacities)
Much of women’s difficulties in the world can be traced to the violence they 
are routinely subjected to. In March 2006, the World Health Organization 
(WHO) released its “Multi-country Study on Women’s Health and Domestic 
Violence against Women” (available at www.who.int/gender/violence/
who_multicountry_study/en). The results indicate not only that many 
parts of the world are frightening and dangerous places for women but also 
that the violence perpetuated against them has rippling and damaging effects 

106
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
on women’s physical, mental, sexual, and reproductive health. Plus, in the 
United States, the leading cause of injury to women aged 15 to 44 is domestic 
violence.
 
Here’s what just a few SCSOs are up to in these areas of concern:
 
✓ The Women’s Aid Organization (WAO; www.wao.org.my) is an indepen-
dent, nonreligious, NGO in Malaysia. WAO is committed to challenging 
and ending violence against women, which it recognizes as a crime and 
a violation of women’s human rights. Their mission is to “promote and 
create respect, protection, and fulfillment of equal rights for women.”
 
✓ Vital Voices Global Partnership (VVGP; http://70.32.91.35) empow-
ers domestic-violence victims and the women working to defend them. 
The VVGP also works from crisis and restoration to positive futures 
and prevention. In its own words: “Vital Voices Global Partnership . . . 
identifies, trains, and empowers emerging women leaders and social 
entrepreneurs around the globe. . . . We provide these women with the 
capacity, connections, and credibility they need to unlock their leader-
ship potential.” This organization covers many of the issues outlined in 
this chapter, so it should be of special interest to social entrepreneurs 
interested in the challenges facing women today.
 
✓ The nonprofit International Organization for Women and Development 
(www.iowd.org) is committed to bringing into being a sustainable pro-
gram that surgically repairs, supplies post-operative care, and then reha-
bilitates (by providing literacy and vocational skills) the “fistula women” 
of Nigeria. (Fistula refers to vesico vaginal fistula, a rupture or hole that 
develops between the vagina and bladder during prolonged obstructed 
labor.) These women are constantly leaking urine and for that they are 
routinely ostracized by their communities. It’s imperative to realize that 
this problem is widespread (not specific to Nigeria), and yet this organi-
zation is fighting the good fight almost single-handedly.
When you look at ethnic minorities, two dominant themes emerge: On the 
one hand are increasing diaspora populations (people spreading out from 
their original homelands) and the rise of a modern, demanding, multicultural 
reality. On the other hand are threats to cultures across the globe. If you 
have any doubts about the enormity of this problem, just ask Wade Davis, 
National Geographic Explorer in Residence. He’ll tell you that the extinc-
tion of indigenous languages and cultures is a problem every bit as crucial 
to humanity’s future as our planet’s environmental degradation. All in all, 
social entrepreneurial second- and third-generation immigrants, especially, 
just need to look to their own families, communities, and homelands to find 
scores of opportunities for their involvement.

107
 Chapter 6: Finding Your Focus: Civil Society’s Many Faces
Partnering with government
You might notice that poverty reduction, aid, 
and development initiatives are either gov-
ernmental or nongovernmental. Obviously, the 
nongovernmental side of it is where you’d fit in. 
We mention this because although, in theory, 
the boundaries between the two forms of assis-
tance are distinct, in practice those boundaries 
are being continually redefined as the rela-
tionship between the two arenas is constantly 
renegotiated.
In fact, if there is a general trend, it is 
for governments to more often partner with 
nongovernmental efforts. The reasons for this 
trend are pretty simple: When those partner-
ships work, governments look like geniuses for 
backing winners and providing valuable cash, 
expertise, and other resources. When things 
don’t work out so well, governments don’t have 
to worry about cleaning up the mess because 
they, as “silent partners,” are far less exposed 
on the front lines than social entrepreneurs like 
you would be.
 
Here are a couple of organizations that are trying to address these concerns:
 
✓ Multiculturalism Community Service (MCS; www.mcsdc.org) was 
founded in 1997 by a group of concerned Washington, D.C., residents 
who wanted to build on the strength of the city’s diversity. Since then, 
MCS has grown and assists in parent involvement, offering language 
access, youth peacemaking, and facilitation and mediation services.
 
✓ Native Planet (www.nativeplanet.org) is an NGO “dedicated to 
the self-empowerment of indigenous peoples and the preservation of 
world ethnic cultures.” This organization helps these groups speak for 
themselves to the world. Not only is this crucial to their protection, but 
it may also even be key to the survival of the rest of us. Why? Because 
these traditional groups understand and can teach us a great deal about 
successful conservation, consumption, and stewardship of what remains 
of the Earth’s wilderness and biological diversity.
Poverty, Humanitarian Aid, and 
Development Organizations
The patterns of social and economic inequality in our world are striking, to 
say the least. When 80 percent of the world’s population takes in only 20 per-
cent of the world’s income, and half of those folks take in a mere 4 percent of 

108
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
that income, it’s easy to see why poverty, humanitarian aid, and global devel-
opment issues — and the question of social justice — should be near the 
very top of humanity’s agenda for today and the foreseeable future.
How can you get involved? Well, to start with, hundreds, if not thousands, 
of organizations worldwide are working valiantly to fight and reduce local 
and global poverty — and having a really hard time with that — so there are 
many places for you to volunteer your services.
 
By volunteering, you begin to expose yourself to the scale and complexity of 
the problems and, as a result, become much better equipped to make your 
own social entrepreneurial contributions when the time comes.
Here are the poverty, humanitarian aid, and development organizations we 
want to bring to your attention:
 
✓ Action by Churches Together International (www.act-intl.org): 
ACT is a worldwide union of churches and their connected service agen-
cies, all working during times of emergency to save lives and support 
communities. ACT members are from Protestant and orthodox churches 
drawn from the membership of the World Council of Churches and 
Lutheran World Federation.
 
✓ ActionAid (www.actionaid.org): ActionAid is an international anti-
poverty agency formed in 1972. Since that time, ActionAid has been 
working in 42 countries, helping many millions of the world’s poorest 
and most disadvantaged people.
 
✓ Aga Khan Development Network (www.akdn.org): AKDN is a group of 
development agencies with a broad set of directives. It works in the fol-
lowing areas: the environment, health, education, architecture, culture, 
microfinance, rural development, and disaster reduction. It also pro-
motes private-sector enterprise and revitalize historic cities.
 
✓ Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (www.adpc.net/general/adpc.
html): ADPC is a nonprofit organization that supports safer communi-
ties and sustainable development. The group accomplishes its goals 
through programs and projects aimed at reducing the impact of disas-
ters on Asian and Pacific countries and communities.
 
✓ Directory of Development Organizations (www.devdir.org): lists 
more than 53,000 development organizations, with downloadable con-
tact information. The idea behind the directory is to facilitate knowledge 
sharing and international cooperation regarding social and economic 
development and poverty reduction.

109
 Chapter 6: Finding Your Focus: Civil Society’s Many Faces
 
✓ German Foundation for World Population (www.weltbevoel
kerung.de/en): The foundation aims to “reduce extreme poverty 
and help young people achieve universal access to sexual and 
reproductive health.” The group is involved in development projects
 in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It also produces advocacy 
campaigns, special events, and publications on population and repro-
ductive health.
 
✓ Global Development Network (www.gdnet.org): GDN is an interna-
tional organization of research and policy institutes that contributes 
to improved international development by advancing the production, 
sharing, and application of multidisciplinary development knowledge.
 
✓ Grameen Bank (www.grameen-info.org): GB takes a very different 
stance on conventional banking by not requiring collateral from the 
poor. The entire loan system is based on “mutual trust, accountability, 
participation, and creativity.” The bank and its founder, Muhammad 
Yunus, were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October 2006. As of 
October 2009, GB has almost 8 million borrowers, 97 percent of whom 
are women. GB’s borrowers own 90 percent of its shares; the rest are 
government owned.
 
✓ IASC Humanitarian Early Warning Service (www.hewsweb.org): 
HEWSweb is an interagency partnership that tries to warn of impending 
humanitarian and natural hazards using the most credible global-level 
information possible.
 
✓ Interchurch Organization for Development Cooperation (www.icco.
nl/delivery/icco/en): ICCO works toward the global eradication of 
poverty and injustice and, with that, a future where people live in dignity 
and prosperity.
 
✓ Institute for International Cooperation and Development (www.iicd-
volunteer.org): IICD is a nonprofit volunteer organization active in 
Africa, Central America, and Brazil. IICD’s emphasis is on humanitarian 
development and community work.
 
✓ Mercy Corps (www.mercycorps.org): Mercy Corps supports those 
affected by disasters, conflicts, and poverty by providing emergency 
relief and development initiatives.
 
✓ Novartis Foundation for Sustainable Development (www.novartis
foundation.org): NFSD aims, through networking and via its 
own think tank, to encourage stakeholder development policy 
dialogue intended to improve the quality of life in developing 
countries. The foundation also has a specific interest in healthcare 
and social development.

110
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
 
✓ People In Aid (www.peopleinaid.org): PIA is a network of interna-
tional humanitarian assistance and development agencies. The organiza-
tion helps other poverty relief organizations by improving their people 
management and support. PIA facilitates this process by helping these 
organizations see how they might improve their standards, accountabil-
ity, and transparency in meeting their many challenges.
 
✓ United Nations Development Programme (www.undp.org): UNDP 
provides vital information on the UN’s Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) through publications and special initiatives.
 
As you browse the preceding Web sites, you’ll note that some of these folks 
are on the constant lookout for volunteers. Contact them for an opportunity to 
start really learning the ropes.
Although the organizations in the preceding list are large and well estab-
lished, you should have a look at ventures that are somewhat smaller, but 
often just as innovative:
 
✓ Boulder-Lhasa Sister City Project (www.boulder-tibet.org): BLSCP 
was formed in 1986 by the City Council of Boulder, Colorado. This non-
profit public charity allows sister cities Boulder and Lhasa, Tibet, to 
develop and implement mutually beneficial (but nonpolitical) exchanges 
in the areas of “health care, education, environmental protection, sci-
ence and technology, agriculture and animal husbandry, and culture 
and art.”
 
✓ Give Us Wings (www.giveuswings.org): This organization is a small, 
grass-roots nonprofit organization working in Kenyan and Ugandan vil-
lages. Areas of assistance include funding community development proj-
ects, meeting the educational and medical needs of adults and children, 
and training folks for economic self-sufficiency. Volunteer trips may 
involve poverty education and assistance with sustainable development 
programs.
 
✓ Mary Slessor Foundation (www.maryslessor.org): This group con-
tinues the legacy of Mary Slessor’s work in Nigeria, where, despite the 
country’s wealth of resources, the masses remain poor. The foundation 
focuses its efforts on medical problems, employment and training, and 
agriculture.
 
✓ The Bangladesh Relief Fund (www.bangladeshrelief.org): The 
BRF is an Ohio nonprofit corporation founded by Mr. Muhit Rahman, 
an expatriate Bangladeshi who has emigrated to the United States. Mr. 
Rahman, horrified by the devastating floods in Bangladesh in 2004, orga-
nized to raise and distribute funds for poverty alleviation in his home 
country. To date, the BRF has expanded and funded a number of pro-
grams including a fishery, a chicken farm, and a cow-lending microcredit 
operation.

 Chapter 6: Finding Your Focus: Civil Society’s Many Faces
Issues to watch in aid and development
Beware of “phantom aid.” In 2006 ActionAid 
estimated that almost half of global aid — $37 
billion — was aid that was not “genuinely avail-
able to poor countries to fight poverty” because 
it was tied up in technical assistance (in other 
words, consultants, research, and training). 
ActionAid concluded that “technical assis-
tance is often overpriced and ineffective, and in 
the worst cases destroys rather than builds the 
capacity of the poorest countries.” ActionAid 
goes on to say, “. . . donors continue to insist on 
large technical assistance components in most 
projects and programs they fund.”
Why? A couple of reasons:
 ✓ Technical assistance provides a “soft” 
lever that allows donors to direct and 
supervise the policies of the governments 
of developing countries.
 ✓ Technical assistance gives donors the 
opportunity to “own” reforms that they feel 
are worthwhile.
The moral of the story is to be aware that orga-
nizations that are fighting poverty with techni-
cal assistance may have ulterior motives, and 
that these may detract from actually getting the 
job done.
Another issue arises from the fact that humani-
tarian aid and development aid are quite differ-
ent things:
 ✓ Humanitarian aid (sometimes called just 
aid) is relief that follows disasters or civil 
unrest or warfare. It’s about saving lives in 
the face of calamity, pure and simple — it’s 
crisis and restoration work.
 ✓ Development aid (or just development), 
on the other hand, works toward positive 
human and social flourishing: building infra-
structure, putting up schools and hospitals, 
creating roads and dams, and so forth.
The relationship between aid and development 
is not always a happy one. In fact, over the past 
few years, a lot of development aid money has 
been diverted toward humanitarian aid, with 
the result that longer-term initiatives have often 
been shelved due to a lack of funds. And at 
least in the aftermath of conflict, it doesn’t seem 
clear that humanitarian aid actually decreases 
violence — Darfur remains a chilling case in 
point, as increased aid to the area often invites 
more slaughter from marauding militia.
If you like brain-teasers, here’s one to mull over: 
Research indicates that reducing poverty leads 
to improvements in participatory processes, 
such as civil society and politics, and in social 
capital (the usefulness of one’s social relation-
ships). However, the opposite holds, too: Work 
on improving civil society, participation, and 
social networks, and you reduce poverty. This 
suggests that not only do social entrepreneurs 
have another good reason to “sell” poverty 
reduction, but that you might actually reduce 
poverty by working on the things that poverty 
reduction claims to bring about.
Huh? We’ll put it another way: As you reduce 
poverty and see benefits in civil society and 
social relationships, seize on and maximize 
those gains because they’ll be the basis for 
further poverty reductions. Sounds like a good 
deal, doesn’t it?

112

Environmental Organizations
Unquestionably, the fate of our planet is the issue beyond all others. If we 
don’t get that right, none of the other earthly concerns we’ve also got to 
tackle will matter. And there’s so much more. Just consider the scope of 
the environmental problems we face. We need to undo the polluting ten-
dencies of humanity and, with that, reduce carbon emissions while moving 
quickly to construct environmentally responsible buildings and other lived 
environments — just for starters.
 
Since its founding in 1961, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF; www.world
wildlife.org) has grown into the world’s largest private international con-
servation organization, with almost 5 million supporters distributed on 5 conti-
nents and with offices in more than 90 countries. It’s safe to say that the WWF 
has played a starring role in the development of the planetary preservation 
movement.
With people like them on the case, do you even need to worry about helping 
out? In fact, with the large number of organizations worldwide devoted to 
issues related to the environment, ecology (the relationships between organ-
isms and their environments), habitat, threatened species, and so on, there 
might be a tendency to relax and leave the environment to all those mighty 
capable people. Fight that tendency because the stakes couldn’t be higher.
Let’s say that as a social entrepreneur you’d like to do something to help the 
environment, but you’re not sure where to start. You might begin by increas-
ing your environmental literacy through discussion with others more knowl-
edgeable than yourself, whether they’re close by or far away. Here are some 
resources that can help you begin:
 
✓ Environmental Literacy Council (www.enviroliteracy.org): The 
Environmental Literacy Council is an independent, nonprofit organiza-
tion that helps teachers, students, policymakers, and the public find 
reliable cross-disciplinary information on a wide range of environmental 
science topics.
 
✓ Association of University Leaders for a Sustainable Future (http://
ulsf.org): The ULSF is the Secretariat for signatories of the Talloires 
Declaration (signed in 1990, accessible at http://ulsf.org/pdf/
TD.pdf). This declaration was agreed to by more than 400 college and 
university presidents and chancellors from around the world. The ULSF 
advances the resolution’s ten-point execution plan for integrating sus-
tainability and environmental literacy in learning, inquiry, operations, 
and outreach in higher education. This is accomplished through ULSF 
publications, research, and assessment. Its Web site is a great place to 
find out about what the academy is committed to (as well as a great way 
to hold the academics in your community accountable).

 Chapter 6: Finding Your Focus: Civil Society’s Many Faces
 
✓ Wiser Earth (WE; www.wiserearth.org): WE is a free online commu-
nity space that works toward a just and sustainable world by connecting 
concerned people, nonprofits, and businesses. On the Wiser Earth Web 
site you can find others who may share your passions; raise your vis-
ibility; and generate support for your projects, network, or community 
action group.
 
✓ National Environmental Education Week (http://dev.eeweek.org): 
EE Week is the “single largest organized environmental education event 
in the United States.” In 2009, almost 2,600 schools, nature centers, 
museums, zoos, and other educational institutions got together during 
NEE Week to bring environmental education to millions of students 
across America. The high-quality resources on this Web site — and it 
contains lots of them — are aimed at educators of every stripe. That 
should include you, the social entrepreneur.
 
✓ Second Nature (www.secondnature.org): Second Nature moves 
people toward a sustainable future by helping senior college and univer-
sity leaders make healthy, just, and sustainable living the basis of higher 
education’s learning and practice. Lots of ideas abound on this Web site, 
especially with regard to constructing environmentally friendly (green) 
buildings and enabling higher education to successfully interact with 
surrounding communities on the topic of sustainability.
Here are some other quality resources to explore that have a more interna-
tional focus:
 
✓ International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN; www.iucn.
org): IUCN, the world’s oldest and largest global environmental net-
work, “is made up of more than 1,000 government and NGO member 
organizations, and almost 11,000 volunteer scientists in more than 160 
countries.” Consequently, it represents an enormous bank of informa-
tion and expertise in promoting conservation and finding pragmatic 
solutions to pressing environmental and development challenges. The 
union supports scientific research and manages field projects all over 
the world. But it does even more, bringing governments, NGOs, United 
Nations agencies, companies, and local communities into alignment in 
order to develop and implement policy, laws, and best practices.
 
✓ United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP; www.unep.org): 
Through its leadership and willingness to partner around the world, 
UNEP encourages global caring for the environment. One of its basic 
messages is that people and nations everywhere can improve their qual-
ity of life without risking the quality of life of future generations. UNEP is 
a remarkable resource for social entrepreneurs.
 
✓ Living Earth (www.livingearth.org.uk): Living Earth is an interna-
tional organization that encourages practical, bottom-up, and participa-
tory solutions to environmental issues. The important point emphasized 
by this organization is that every situation is different and may require a 
unique approach. Social entrepreneurs can learn a lot from these folks.

114
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
We leave you with three more examples of encouraging social entrepreneur-
ial/NGO efforts:
 
✓ Blue Ocean Institute (BOI; www.blueocean.org): BOI urges ocean 
conservation through science, art, and literature, inspiring solutions and 
a deeper connection with nature. The reliable information on this Web 
site is intended to better inform personal choice, instill hope, and help 
rebuild living ecological richness in the oceans.
 
✓ Bushmeat Crisis Task Force (BCTF; www.bushmeat.org): BCTF seeks 
to eliminate the illegal commercial bushmeat trade (which kills rare and 
endangered animals for food). A growing global network allows BCTF to 
inform nations, organizations, scientists, and the general public about 
the catastrophic effects of the illegal bushmeat commerce. Though 
habitat loss is a huge threat to wildlife, for-profit hunting wild animals 
for their meat is now the most important present threat to the future of 
wildlife in Africa and perhaps worldwide. The pursuit of bushmeat has 
already led to local extinctions in Asia and West Africa.
 
✓ Forest Stewardship Council (www.fsc.org): FSC is an independent, 
nongovernmental, nonprofit organization that promotes the responsible 
management of the world’s forests. Founded as a concerned response to 
global deforestation in 1993, FSC is considered one of the planet’s best 
organizations for promoting responsible forest management.

Chapter 7
The Ground Floor: 
Doing the Initial Planning
In This Chapter
▶ Creating an organizational strategy
▶ Considering whether to aim for profit
▶ Identifying who (or what) will benefit from your efforts
▶ Defining your organization through mission and vision statements
▶ Establishing your goals
You’ve probably heard the saying, “Failing to plan is planning to fail.” We 
couldn’t agree more.
This chapter centers on planning for your social enterprise during its early 
stages. Planning can be boiled down to three steps:
 
1. Identify future goals.
 
2. Evaluate various means for reaching those goals.
 
3. Choose the best course of action.
After you complete these three steps, you’ve arrived at your basic plan for 
establishing your social enterprise.
Of course, planning isn’t something you do just once in the life of your orga-
nization. After you reach Step 3 of your basic plan, you’ll inevitably discover 
the need to back up and redo steps 1 and 2. Many organizations undertake 
formal planning annually, but the reality is that you’ll be planning (and 
replanning) your endeavor on a daily basis.
In this chapter, we start by looking at ways you can think strategically about 
forming a social enterprise. We help you consider if profit will be one of your 
goals or if you plan to live without it. We show you how to identify the people 
(or animals or parks or whatever) who will benefit from your efforts, and we 
walk you through the process of developing mission and vision statements. 

116
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
Finally, we get you thinking about how to set realistic goals that are just lofty 
enough to keep you inspired for the long haul.
Planning Strategically
Whether your ultimate goal is to develop a for-profit or nonprofit organiza-
tion, you need to think strategically. (Strategy isn’t something you can ignore 
if you’re planning to start a nonprofit.) A strategy encompasses a long-range 
set of some or all of the following:
 
✓ Goals: Desired ends or results
 
✓ Policies: Courses of action adopted because they’re advantageous or 
expedient
 
✓ Programs: Planned sets of activities and actions
 
✓ Actions: Doing what is necessary to realize goals (including setting time-
lines for taking these actions)
 
✓ Decisions: Settling or resolving a question in dispute
 
✓ Allocation of resources: Allotting the means to solve a problem
You need to think broadly enough that you cover all these items. For exam-
ple, you shouldn’t consider goals without also considering the resources and 
programs you need to reach those goals.
 
A social enterprise’s strategy describes what it is, what it does, and why it does 
it. More specifically, strategy refers to setting long-term, overall planning goals 
and implementing the means of achieving them.
Strategic planning in social enterprises is an ongoing process. After you come 
up with your initial plan (by thinking about your goals, policies, programs, 
and so on), you continue to plan strategically. This continued strategic plan-
ning commonly includes the following:
 
✓ Setting broad policy and direction for the enterprise: Decide on advan-
tageous courses of action that will lead to realization of the enterprise’s 
goals.
 
✓ Allowing for internal and external assessment: Successful enterprises 
arrange for routine evaluations of their programs, first from internal 
sources (such as a supervisor, division head, or respected senior 
member) and then from expert individuals or groups outside themselves.
 
✓ Paying attention to key stakeholders: Stakeholders are those people 
and groups who have an interest in the success of your social enter-
prise. Be sure to learn about what they think of it and what they want 
from it.

117
 Chapter 7: The Ground Floor: Doing the Initial Planning
 
✓ Identifying critical issues: Determine the most important problems that 
your enterprise must deal with. These problems typically include find-
ing funding, reliable and effective volunteers, avenues of influence with 
government, and ways to sensitize the public to the enterprise’s mission 
and goals.
 
✓ Developing strategies to deal with critical issues: Create strategies that 
will solve as effectively as possible the important problems facing your 
enterprise.
 
✓ Making decisions: Organize and direct members of your enterprise so 
that they can find a way to settle or resolve the issues facing it.
 
✓ Taking action: Having made a decision on how to solve an issue, take 
the necessary steps to reach the solution.
 
✓ Monitoring the results of those actions: Successful problem solving 
requires giving continuous feedback to the people involved about how 
they’re progressing toward resolution of the issue.
 
Part of a social enterprise’s strategy is to develop a clear set of goals (a topic 
we cover in the next section), but equally important is to evaluate periodically 
the means by which you’re reaching these goals. With a critical eye, examine 
the means you’ll be using to meet your goals and ask yourself some questions 
both at startup and at least once per quarter after that:
 
✓ Are the means for reaching our goals appropriate?
 
✓ Are more effective means available?
 
✓ Are certain means generally effective but in need of some tweaking to 
make them better?
This kind of evaluation is often left to the board of directors, if there is one. 
(We discuss boards of directors in Chapter 14.) If your organization doesn’t 
have a board of directors, evaluation falls to you and/or other senior leaders 
of the organization.
Such an evaluation will also be helpful in determining how well your enter-
prise is moving along toward reaching its goals. After you’re up and running, 
you’ll want to ask yourself the following questions:
 
✓ How far have we come toward reaching our goals?
 
✓ How long has it taken us to reach this point, and is that faster or slower 
than we had planned?
 
✓ How much more time will we need to achieve your goals?
 
✓ Are there any ways of speeding up the achievement of our goals?

118
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
 
Funding bodies (which provide money to nonprofit enterprises — see Chapter 
9) often request assessments with information of this sort, which is just 
another reason to be sure that you periodically assess your progress.
Strategic planning at startup and from then on tends to be most effective in 
larger social enterprises of around 30 or more members. Why? In smaller 
organizations, especially nonprofits, good planning can often take place with-
out having to be strategic — planning can occur without setting broad policy 
and direction for the enterprise, without allowing for internal and external 
assessment, and without paying attention to key stakeholders (three impor-
tant subprocesses of strategic planning).
Setting Goals: The Foundation 
of Planning
We note earlier in this chapter that goals are desired ends or results. In this 
section, we focus on the nature of the official ends, results that your enter-
prise is striving to realize, and the nature of the unofficial ends and results 
that some of your organization’s members are also hoping to achieve.
 
When you’re in the midst of planning, you’ll likely hear people using two words 
to refer to your organizational aims: goals and objectives. As far as we’re con-
cerned, the two terms are synonymous. Some people try to differentiate their 
definitions, but we suggest treating the terms as if they mean the same thing.
Official goals: What you tell the 
world about where you’re headed
In social entrepreneurship, the goal is to change society in such a way that 
this change will benefit a target (the beneficiaries of your work). (We explain 
what a target is in the “Anticipating Who Will Benefit from Your Work” sec-
tion, later in this chapter.) State clearly and in writing the official goals — 
those presented in formal statements — of your enterprise. Set out your 
goals in a separate formal statement that is distinct from your mission and 
vision statements (see “Developing Mission and Vision Statements,” later in 
this chapter).
 
The very act of writing about your goals helps clarify them for yourself and 
others.

119
 Chapter 7: The Ground Floor: Doing the Initial Planning
The best way to start setting goals for your enterprise is to list, as clearly 
and simply as possible, the concrete changes you want your enterprise to 
achieve for your target. Try to list these changes in order of importance (but 
don’t worry if some goals seem equally important). Keep it brief — two or 
three concrete, manageable goals are better than five or six goals that you 
can’t effectively pursue at the same time.
 
Make sure that your list consists only of the goals you can actually achieve — 
set aside your pie-in-the-sky thinking for now. How do you know if a goal is pos-
sible or impossible to achieve? Consider the following:
 
✓ The actions that you must take to reach the goal: For each goal you’ve 
listed, also list the actions you (or someone in your organization) will 
need to take to reach that goal. Ask yourself how the target group will be 
realistically affected by those specific actions.
 
✓ The financial costs of reaching the goal: Identify how much money you 
need and where the money is going to come from.
 
✓ The people you need to put your goals into action: Ask yourself:
 
• Who in the enterprise is going to do what to bring a given goal to 
reality?
 
• What kind of person or persons will we have to recruit to help 
reach a given goal?
 
• What will the target of our benefits have to do to bring to frui-
tion the pursuit of a particular goal? (For example, if education 
in a third-world village is a goal, students must study; if political 
change in your government is a goal, politicians must vote in new 
legislation.)
 
 Write down the answers to these questions next to each goal.
If you discover that you don’t have the resources to achieve a particular goal, 
you know that it’s unrealistic — at least for now. But don’t throw away the 
list — down the road, the resources you need may become available.
 
You’ll have time for your pipe dreams later. At the start, you need to develop 
clear and obvious objectives — objectives that you can easily measure the 
progress of.
 
Clear evidence that your enterprise is advancing toward a goal is an inspira-
tion for everyone in the enterprise. Taking time to carefully set up a detailed, 
achievable plan can be a great source of motivation for the people in your 
enterprise.

120
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
Unofficial goals: Stuff you 
secretly hope to also achieve
Note that your official goals may not be the only goals driving your enter-
prise, even at the beginning. Unofficial goals may exist at that time as well. 
Unofficial goals are unstated, secret, or hidden objectives that are neverthe-
less important for some of the people personally involved with your enter-
prise. They may include your pie-in-the-sky goals.
For example, you may have the official goal of developing a number of micro-
businesses in a poor South American community. But also, some of the 
women in the enterprise intend to work hard to involve local females in these 
undertakings. Having that secondary, or unofficial, goal is perfectly okay and 
natural. You’ll pursue unofficial goals through your operating procedures, 
whether intentionally or not.
Identifying unofficial goals in an enterprise often requires special effort, per-
haps even including some research using interviews with its members or 
drawing inferences from expenditures of resources such as time and money.
Getting off-track: Avoiding goal displacement
Nonprofit social enterprises, as well as in other 
kinds of nonprofits, tend to stray over time from 
pursuing official goals into seeking such unof-
ficial goals as maintaining the group’s current 
personnel arrangements, organizational pro-
cedures, or organizational structure. This ten-
dency is known as goal displacement.
We can explain this tendency, in part, by the 
fact that nonprofit groups find it extremely dif-
ficult if not impossible to actually achieve some 
of their official goals — so they just add in goals 
that they can achieve. For example, maybe the 
official goal of raising money is displaced by a 
more realistic goal, such as living off of govern-
ment grants.
Nonprofit groups are capable of seeking and 
even achieving many goals, but ones that are 
especially hard to reach involve money. For 
example, David Horton Smith, a well-known 
researcher on nonprofit organizations, notes 
that, however prominent the objective of raising 
money, most nonprofits have difficulty raising 
much of it (and none can collect taxes).
Avoiding goal displacement in your enterprise 
requires constant vigilance. Your best defense 
is in knowing that this tendency exists in orga-
nizations of all kinds, and that you have to keep 
official goals front and center in the minds of 
all your staff and volunteers (more about this in 
Chapter 18). Be on alert for actions on the part 
of your personnel that suggest they have unof-
ficial goals that could undermine the organiza-
tion’s pursuit of its official goals.

121
 Chapter 7: The Ground Floor: Doing the Initial Planning
 
Unofficial goals can become a problem when they come into conflict with the 
organization’s official goals. If you suspect that some of the members of your 
organization have hidden agendas that may be hindering the enterprise’s pur-
suit of its official goals, a common and often effective solution to the problem 
is to meet with them face to face to discuss those agendas and their effects on 
official goals. An example of a conflicting unofficial goal would be where a 
member wants your enterprise to use his or her professional service, when 
that same service is available elsewhere at significantly reduced cost.
 
Only you can judge the compatibility between your official and unofficial goals.
Planning on Profit — Or Not
Chapter 8 is devoted to the question of whether you should develop your 
social enterprise as a nonprofit or a for-profit business (one from which 
you’ll be able to gain all or part of your livelihood). We briefly introduce the 
question here so that you recognize that you need to deal with this question 
in your initial strategic planning work.
 
What we have said to this point about basic planning applies to both nonprofit 
and for-profit social enterprises. Still, some entrepreneurs at this stage of 
developing their enterprises have already begun to think about making them 
profitable. More and more, their early strategic planning centers on profitabil-
ity within the altruistic framework of social entrepreneurship.
What exactly is profit? We define profit as the money left over after expenses 
have been covered — money that is not plowed back into financing the 
enterprise. Profit is money that, if your enterprise’s legal status permits, may 
go into your pocket. Of course, the legal status of a nonprofit prevents this 
kind of transfer of proceeds. (We discuss the different types of legal status in 
Chapter 14.)
 
Even if you envision for-profit status at the get-go, you may still want to begin 
as a nonprofit, with the long-range goal of converting to a business when finan-
cial conditions warrant. (This possibility is an advantage that social entrepre-
neurs have over traditional businesses.) Starting as a nonprofit enables you 
to receive funding from nonprofit funding sources while testing the waters to 
see how difficult it is to make a profit from your goods or services. If you real-
ize that your enterprise can profit — that is, make more money than you need 
to run it — you’ll have proof of that fact. At that point you can approach a 
bank for further profit-oriented funding, if you need it. Alternatively, you might 
create a for-profit arm of the enterprise so that the nonprofit status of the 
main organization is maintained.

122
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
 
Our advice is this: If at startup you know that your enterprise is going to need 
funding, strive as soon as possible to make money if you can. If, down the 
road, you find you’re routinely bringing in more cash than needed to meet 
expenses, you can decide at that point whether to become a for-profit enter-
prise — in other words, a business.
 
Here are two blunt facts:
 
✓ The vast majority of nonprofits need money to operate.
 
✓ The vast majority of nonprofits are chronically short of money.
Many nonprofits try to survive on grants from public or private sources, or 
both. The problem is that grants are too often undependable. In the mean-
time, income from the sales of goods or services can help reduce dependence 
on these sources. (See Chapter 9 for more on grants and funding nonprofits.)
Anticipating Who Will 
Benefit from Your Work
Part of generating a solid strategic plan is identifying who or what will benefit 
from the work you plan to do. If you want to impress your friends and family 
with jargon, refer to the beneficiaries as your target of benefits (or target 
group, or simply target).
Your target may be a specific population, a group of people, or a set of orga-
nizations — for example, all elementary-age children in your city or all of its 
agencies that serve abused women. But some targets aren’t people at all. We 
explain the array of possibilities in this section.
Defining a human target
Say the social problem you’re trying to address is homelessness in your city. 
You set up End Homelessness, which aims to assist men, women, and chil-
dren who hang out and sleep in public places. Your target population is very 
clear, and you even know how to locate them: You can often find homeless 
people on park benches, in doorways, in alleys, in spaces under bridges, and 
near heating grates (in the winter).
On the other hand, you may find that your target is easier to define than to 
locate. For example, say you want to initiate a social enterprise designed to 
educate female high school dropouts. You know from data published by the 

123
 Chapter 7: The Ground Floor: Doing the Initial Planning
local school board that a certain percentage of females in local high schools 
never earn a high school diploma. But how do you find these people so you 
can encourage them to take advantage of your services? That’s a challenge 
you must address in your strategic plan.
 
Think through the possible avenues of contact with your target population 
before you set up shop. Otherwise, you’re throwing a party without an invita-
tion list.
Focusing on nonhuman targets
The beneficiaries of your work don’t have to be humans. Many environmental 
enterprises have targeted trees, rivers, birds, animals, and even the air we 
breathe. You can make the argument that these organizations do, ultimately, 
target humans, because we all benefit from improvements to the natural 
world. But in terms of strategic planning, you want to focus your energies on 
the first-tier beneficiaries, whether they’re human or not.
 
Just to make things really interesting, keep in mind that ideas may be your 
target of benefits, too. For example, many social enterprises have been formed 
to fight for the teaching of either evolutionary science or creationism in 
schools. And enterprises whose mission is to convert people to a particular 
religion may be regarded as targeting ideas because they try to change how 
others think about supernatural powers. (See the nearby sidebar, “A creation-
ist social enterprise,” for an example.)
A creationist social enterprise
You may think social enterprises are always 
liberal and progressive undertakings, but that’s 
not necessarily the case. Consider the example 
of a conservative idea-based social enterprise 
established by Paul Abramson called Biblical 
Creation Apologetics Program at Master’s 
Divinity School. The object of this program is 
to instruct students on creationism, or what 
Abramson calls creation theory. The social 
problem he sees and is trying to solve is the 
dominance in Western societies of the evolu-
tionary theory of human origin and develop-
ment. He believes that theory is wrong and that 
people in the West should be informed about 
the alternative creation theory and why, in his 
opinion, it’s a better explanation.
Abramson’s plan for reaching his entrepreneur-
ial goals has been to establish the Master’s 
Divinity School. That plan also includes a Web 
site he established for disseminating the cre-
ationist view (www.creationism.org), 
which provides links to other creationist sites 
and even a few evolutionist sites. Abramson 
has written numerous books and articles on 
the creation theory.

124
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
Moving on to new frontiers: 
Understanding goal succession
Sometimes a social enterprise changes one or 
more of its basic goals. When this happens, it’s 
known as goal succession. Goal succession 
can occur when an enterprise has achieved 
one of its original goals, or it can occur because 
a goal has been made irrelevant by changes in 
the surrounding social or physical environment 
of the enterprise.
Goal succession becomes more likely as the 
group ages. Changes in the social or physical 
environment can take place any time, raising 
the possibility that certain goals may become 
obsolete.
Here’s an example of goal succession in a 
social enterprise: The Marching Mothers of 
Ontario conducted their Canadian campaign in 
the 1950s and 1960s. It was part of the larger 
North American March of Dimes, whose fund-
raising mission was to collect money to be used 
to find a cure for polio — a highly contagious, 
disabling, and sometimes fatal disease. The 
money raised went toward research on polio. 
The Marching Mothers and their counterparts 
elsewhere in Canada and the United States 
went door to door in their neighborhoods, 
collecting donations (often much larger than 
a dime) for the March of Dimes. These funds 
supported the research of Dr. Jonas Salk, who 
eventually developed a polio vaccine, which 
brought a halt to the polio epidemics that 
had been plaguing North America. Suddenly, 
the volunteer work of the Marching Mothers 
was no longer needed; their goals had been 
reached. If their enterprise were to continue, it 
would need to find a new goal — or arrange 
for goal succession, which is what they did. Still 
marching, the Mothers now collect donations 
that support a wide range of vital services for 
adults and children with physical disabilities.
Look to the future to anticipate which, if any, 
of your present goals are soon likely to be 
reached. As you engage in initial planning for 
your social enterprise, you can’t anticipate all 
the possible developments that may happen 
down the road. Besides, your time and energy 
are better spent dealing with the immediate and 
diverse challenges of reaching goals, conduct-
ing evaluations, and carrying out many of the 
other aspects of strategic planning. Still, it’s 
good to be mindful that the world can change, 
sometimes suddenly, and successful goal suc-
cession requires a lot of advance planning if the 
transition is to be smooth and effective.
On the other hand, many nonprofit social entre-
preneurs, when they’ve reached their goals, 
are quite content to call it a day. They set out 
to solve a finite problem — for example, to 
clean up a river, build a shelter for the home-
less, or establish a set of summer recreational 
programs for children with physical handicaps. 
After your goal is reached, you may decide to 
move on to another social problem requiring a 
new enterprise for its solution. After all, you’ve 
already proven you can do it!

125
 Chapter 7: The Ground Floor: Doing the Initial Planning
Developing Mission and 
Vision Statements
The mission of your social enterprise is, quite simply, its central purpose as 
defined now. The vision is how you foresee your organization operating in 
the future — the needs it fulfills, the target it serves, and so on.
As you develop a strategic plan for your enterprise, your challenge is to craft 
a mission statement and a vision statement that capture your ideas effec-
tively enough to convey them to the rest of the world. In this section, we 
show you how.
 
Mission and vision statements aren’t carved in stone. Although you want to 
strive toward consistency, especially in your mission, you can modify these 
statements if your enterprise’s mission or vision changes.
Short and sweet: Crafting a 
mission statement
Mission orientation is the basic distinguishing characteristic of nonprofit 
groups — it’s what sets them apart from the for-profit organizations, which, 
not surprisingly, have as their central purpose the pursuit of profit. (That’s 
not to say that corporations and companies don’t also see themselves as 
having missions — usually serving customers and so on — but their real 
bottom-line mission is to make a profit.)
 
Some businesses start out purely as businesses with a mission to make 
money. Some of these, especially in today’s moralistic climate, have later 
added social missions (see Chapter 8). But they aren’t social enterprises. 
Other organizations — both nonprofit and for-profit — start out as organiza-
tions designed to solve a particular social problem.
Coming up with the mission of your social enterprise may be easy: It’s simply 
a statement of what you want to change in this world and why. For example, 
say your organization’s goal is to fight homelessness. The mission statement 
of such an enterprise may read: “The mission of End Homelessness is to 
establish suitable shelter for all street people in Seattle.”
Not all social issues are as easy to communicate to the public, though, and 
not all mission statements are so simple to craft. So if your mission statement 
hasn’t popped into your head already, read on.

126
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
Recognizing the characteristics of a great mission statement
Your challenge is to present your mission in such a way that it’s easily and 
quickly understood by the people who will benefit from your work, your 
funders, potential volunteers, and anyone else who can influence your suc-
cess. The best statements are
 
✓ Short
 
✓ Simply worded
 
✓ Unambiguous
 
✓ Interesting to read
 
Although shorter is better, you may need a longer mission statement if your 
work is more difficult to explain. Some mission statements, for example, must 
contain definitions of key concepts that are not widely known. Otherwise, they 
risk being misunderstood or clashing with definitions that are too simplistic or 
inconsistent with the organization’s mission.
Drafting a mission statement of your own
 
See what you can do in, say, 25 or 30 words to create a succinct and catchy 
mission statement, using the criteria in the preceding section. Practice writing 
mission statements for other organizations — not just your own. Writing effec-
tive mission statements is a skill that you can polish with a little practice.
After you have something written down — a mission statement that applies 
to your organization — circulate it to others in your enterprise for their 
evaluation. And don’t forget to show drafts of the statement to folks outside 
the enterprise because the statement will ultimately be read by all sorts of 
outside people who must also understand it. Getting feedback from some out-
siders early in the game can help you avoid having to redraft the statement 
later.
 
Here are three model mission statements for three different kinds of social 
enterprises. Each statement has been written to be short, simply worded, 
unambiguous, and interesting to read.
 
✓ Human target: Self-Directed Learners League (SDLL). The SDLL was 
formed to promote self-directed learning at all ages.
 
 Mission statement: Self-directed learning — learning that is intentional, 
planned, and controlled by the learner — is a main highway to deep 
personal development. The Self-Directed Learners League encourages 
self-directed learning at all ages in all areas of life, fosters opportunities 
to learn in this way, and develops and promotes resources by which this 
can be achieved.

 Chapter 7: The Ground Floor: Doing the Initial Planning
 
✓ Idea as target: The Jazz Appreciation Society (JAS). The JAS was estab-
lished to promote understanding of and love for jazz music in all its 
forms
 
 Mission statement: Jazz is one of the world’s most original and vibrant 
forms of music. The Jazz Appreciation Society encourages people to 
listen to this exciting art — both live and recorded — as well as to learn 
about its nature, history, styles, and key performers.
 
✓ Non-human target: Save the Black-Footed Ferret. This organization was 
born to find ways to save from extinction one of North America’s most 
endangered mammals.
 
 Mission statement: The black-footed ferret — once a lively, omnipres-
ent resident of the Great Plains from Mexico to Canada — is now on the 
verge of disappearing. Save the Black-Footed Ferret sensitizes politi-
cians, environmentalists, and the general population to this imminent 
tragedy. We also foster research into habitat preservation for and opti-
mal breeding practices of this mammal.
A glimpse of your future: 
Writing a vision statement
Unlike a mission statement, a vision statement is future oriented. Your vision 
statement presents your enterprise’s ideal picture of itself in the future, as an 
entity that’s already successfully carrying out its mission. It provides an ideal 
toward which you’re striving.
The same criteria that guide your construction of a mission statement (see 
the preceding section) also apply here: You want a vision statement that’s 
short, simply worded, unambiguous, and interesting. However, your vision 
statement will undoubtedly be longer than your mission statement.
 
Your mission statement and vision statement will most often be presented in 
tandem on your marketing materials, your Web site, your grant applications, 
and so on. For this reason, you don’t want the two to overlap significantly.
As with your mission statement, we suggest that you draft a vision statement 
or two as an exercise in forming such a document.
 
Vision statements center on already realized goals. Therefore, your draft 
should portray this outcome, while also saying something (quite general) 
about the actions you took to reach them. Here, too, practice makes perfect.

128
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
 
The three model social enterprises, whose mission statements we review in 
the preceding section, also have vision statements. As with a mission state-
ment, a vision statement should be short, simply worded, unambiguous, and 
interesting to read, as exemplified here:
 
✓ Self-Directed Learners League: People of all ages everywhere in the 
community routinely shaping their own education by reading, listening, 
and viewing material that interests them and leads to their growth as 
unique individuals.
 
✓ The Jazz appreciation Society: People throughout the community listen 
to live and recorded jazz and learn about it by reading, listening, and 
watching informative books, articles, CDs, DVDs, videos, and television 
programs.
 
✓ Save the Black-Footed Ferret: A healthy, reproducing population of 
black-footed ferrets is distributed throughout its original native habitat 
such that it fits well within the larger ecosystem.
Marketing reusable shopping bags for profit
Judy Lazar, a mother of three, was looking for 
a new business opportunity. She had aban-
doned a career in Montreal’s fashion industry 
to be a full-time mother. One day while she was 
grocery shopping, she realized that the super-
markets shared considerable responsibility for 
the proliferation of plastic bags, which pollute 
urban environments everywhere.
Judy knew that reusable plastic bags were 
catching on in Quebec in supermarkets and 
other businesses. Still, the produce section 
of the supermarkets and the various farmers’ 
markets presented a special problem. 
Dispensers holding rolls of plastic bags were 
all over the produce aisles, and even shoppers 
with reusable grocery bags used the plastic 
ones to wrap their produce.
So Judy decided to create produce bags that 
would change grocery shopping, making it 
more environmentally friendly. She developed 
a bag consisting in part of cotton. At the time of 
this writing, Judy has sold more than 30,000 of 
her produce bags.

For-Profit and Nonprofit: 
Considering Your Options
In This Chapter
▶ Realizing what it means to be a nonprofit
▶ Identifying various forms of for-profit businesses
▶ Assessing the pros and cons of nonprofit and for-profit status
▶ Weighing the moral dimension and capitalist concerns
E
veryone needs money, and everyone likes to be paid for doing what they 
like. So, the question naturally arises: Should you try to personally profit 
from your proposed social enterprise? For some entrepreneurs, the answer 
is “Of course!” For others, the answer is an equally strong “Of course not!” If 
you’re not sure, this chapter’s for you.
Here, we explain the key differences between running a nonprofit business 
and running a for-profit business. We help you consider how your decision 
will affect the people or things you’re trying to benefit. We also lay out some 
pros and cons of each option for you to consider. Then we turn to consider-
ing the moral dimension of running a social enterprise, including choosing 
which and how many bottom lines to consider when making decisions about 
how to run your organization.
Introducing the Different Types of 
Socially Conscious Organizations: 
Nonprofit and For-Profit
When you’re getting ready to launch a socially conscious organization, one 
of your first decisions needs to be whether to profit. Nonprofit and for-profit 
social enterprises both have pros and cons, but before we launch into our 
discussion of these pros and cons, you need some background information.

130
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
At startup, you can choose from one of three types of organizations. (Later, 
you may want to change to a different type, but we’re getting ahead of our-
selves.) We cover these organizations in the following sections. For more-
detailed information on these types of organizations, turn to Chapter 14.
Unincorporated nonprofit groups
An unincorporated nonprofit group is a group that has no legal status and 
whose mission is to solve a social problem.
 
When we refer to a group here, we’re talking about two or more individuals 
who share one or more goals and have a sense of common identity (distinct 
from other groups and the population at large). The group is organized 
around a set of rules and roles.
Nonprofit corporations
No, nonprofit corporation is not an oxymoron — it’s actually a legally estab-
lished group (that is, a nonprofit organization that has a charter and may 
also have a governmental tax-exempt status). The people responsible for 
directing the organization (often called the board of directors or trustees) can’t 
be paid — they’re volunteers. They may, however, hire staff for pay, includ-
ing an executive director, who implements board decisions and policy. The 
executive director doesn’t direct the organization, though — that function is 
filled by the volunteer board of directors.
For-profit corporations
A for-profit corporation is a legally established group. The key difference 
between a nonprofit corporation and a for-profit corporation is that, in a 
nonprofit corporation, members of the board of directors, owners, and share-
holders (if there are any and if they also help direct the group) are legally 
prohibited from being paid from the profits gained by the corporation. In a 
for-profit corporation, everyone may be, and usually is, paid for his work, 
including the board of directors, owners, and shareholders. A for-profit cor-
poration, therefore, cannot qualify as a charity and doesn’t have governmen-
tal tax-exempt status.
Profit is the money left over after all the expenses of the enterprise have been 
met, including the wages and benefits of paid staff.

131
 Chapter 8: For-Profit and Nonprofit: Considering Your Options
Weighing the Pros and Cons of Nonprofit 
and For-Profit Organizations
Being a social entrepreneur doesn’t necessarily mean you’re going to spend 
the rest of your life in jeans, T-shirts, and a beater car. But here’s what you 
need to know: If you incorporate as a nonprofit organization, you and other 
members of your group who own it or on your board of directors cannot 
legally receive personal income or other financial benefits funded by your 
organization. Instead, any profits from sales of goods and services must be 
returned to the enterprise for use in ways that advance the enterprise. If you 
incorporate as a for-profit enterprise, you and the members of your group 
can be paid and can receive a share of the profits.
 
By profit we mean the money left over after all the expenses of the enterprise 
have been met, including the wages and benefits of paid staff.
Nonprofits: Everything goes 
back to the organization
The idea of the nonprofit group has been around since the dawn of the for-
profit corporation (which we discuss in Chapter 14), when it became neces-
sary to distinguish the two kinds of organizations. The nonprofit has since 
acquired a rather saintly aura of fostering good in the community rather than 
blindly pursuing profit. But here we take a more realistic and detailed view of 
nonprofits, looking at their advantages and disadvantages.
The advantages
Here are some of the key benefits you gain by opting for nonprofit status:
 
✓ A clear conscience: You avoid the potential uncomfortable feeling of 
making money off the social problem you’re trying to solve.
 
✓ A keen focus on your target population: Any money the organization 
makes is funneled back into solving the social problem and helping your 
target population.
 
✓ Lifestyle balance: Commitment to running a nonprofit social enterprise 
is very likely to take a good deal of time away from making a living. 
Under such conditions, some social entrepreneurs experience a shift in 
values as the “hobby” gains in importance compared to the “job.” You 
may decide that you and your family can live comfortably on a smaller 
income. The lifestyle of a nonprofit social entrepreneur is rarely opulent, 
but you don’t have to take a vow of poverty.

132
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
 
✓ The ability to nurture the enterprise: You can invest some of the earn-
ings from your enterprise in a bank account, mutual fund, or money 
market fund to increase the value of your idle money (money not imme-
diately needed for operations or that is ineligible for the support of your 
operations, such as restricted endowments — see Chapter 9). To retain 
nonprofit status, all interest on such investments must be returned to 
the enterprise and not to individual members.
 
✓ Decreased financial risk: As a nonprofit social entrepreneur, you avoid 
the risk and hassle of going into business and taking on the responsibil-
ity of running an enterprise for profit. You probably aren’t investing 
your own cash in the organization, so you aren’t risking losing your own 
money if it doesn’t succeed.
 
✓ Less bureaucracy: When profit is removed from the picture, you may 
have an easier time keeping your enterprise small and the bureaucracy 
minimal.
 
✓ Credibility: As mentioned in the introduction to this section, the non-
profits have acquired a rather saintly aura compared with profit-seeking 
businesses.
The disadvantages
Running a nonprofit isn’t a cakewalk. Here are some of the disadvantages to 
setting up and running a nonprofit organization:
 
✓ You’re limited when it comes to how much money you can make.
 
✓ Free time may be a thing of the past. Because you can’t make a ton of 
money when you’re running a nonprofit, you may need to hold down a 
day job while you’re running the organization. Every spare minute you 
have when you’re not at your day job will have to be poured into your 
nonprofit, which doesn’t leave you much time for a life outside the 
nonprofit.
 
✓ The growth of your organization is limited. Because you don’t have 
much to risk (see the preceding section), you can grow only so big, 
which means the number of people you can help may be limited as well.
 
✓ You must rely on volunteers. Although some entrepreneurs may con-
sider volunteers purely as an advantage, others give them a mixed 
review. As we discuss in Chapter 17, volunteers do pose some special 
managerial problems.
Helping society while turning a profit
You may be more familiar with for-profit corporations than you are with non-
profit groups. We all know about businesses, which seem to be everywhere in 

133
 Chapter 8: For-Profit and Nonprofit: Considering Your Options
life, but many people have little if any contact with nonprofits. Most of 
your friends and relatives probably work for a for-profit organization of some 
kind. But specifically what are the advantages and disadvantages of the 
for-profits?
The advantages
Here are some advantages of running a for-profit business:
 
✓ The money: You can use the profits from your social enterprise to 
achieve a more comfortable life for yourself and your family. In fact, 
your social enterprise may enable you to devote yourself full time to 
your entrepreneurial work — something that may or may not be pos-
sible in a nonprofit.
 
 In for-profit organizations, financial returns from invested idle money 
(see “Nonprofits: Everything goes back to the organization,” earlier 
in this chapter) may be distributed among owners, paid staff, or 
both.
 
✓ Access to credit: Banks and other financial institutions will lend money 
and issue credit cards only to legally established groups who show a 
level of profit sufficient to repay a loan.
 
✓ Greater benefits for your target population: Running a for-profit enter-
prise lets you expand faster and have a bigger impact on your target 
population, partially because you can afford to pay salaries and haul in 
more investment capital.
 
✓ Stability: For-profit organizations have greater stability, with less 
employee turnover, than their nonprofit counterparts because the 
for-profits are supplying a livelihood. Except when jobs are plentiful, 
employees are reluctant to leave positions that, for example, pay well 
and offer adequate benefits.
If you’re entertaining the possibility of making your enterprise a for-profit 
business, you probably don’t feel particularly hamstrung by the moral issues 
of making a profit from the social problem at hand or channeling profits away 
from your target population. Rest assured that we don’t take a stand one way 
or the other in this book: Both nonprofits and for-profits contribute to soci-
ety in positive ways.
 
If you’re considering becoming a for-profit corporation, head over to Chapter 
14 to find out the ins and outs of legally incorporating.

134
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
The disadvantages
So, what are the negative effects of seeking profit in the field of social enter-
prise? Here are a few to consider:
 
✓ Complexity: One major consequence of seeking profit is the accompany-
ing complexity of operating procedures. Profit-seeking enterprises have 
to pay taxes, which certainly adds a layer of bureaucracy. For-profits 
also have more access to credit than nonprofits, which means debt can 
become more of an issue. And because banks are often involved in fund-
ing for-profit businesses, you may have to do more formal (and more 
frequent) financial reporting.
 
✓ Tighter markets: The market is much more competitive and restrictive 
for for-profit businesses than it is for nonprofits — if for no other reason 
than that ordinary businesses are much more dependent on sales than 
nonprofits.
 
✓ The risk of tyranny: Businesses are not democracies. Nonprofits, by 
dint of their constitutions (see Chapter 14), are democracies. In 
nonprofits, groups of members govern. Nonprofits experience more 
leadership turnover than for-profits as a result, but that’s not neces-
sarily a bad thing. In for-profits, the risk is that one person (or a small 
group of people) rules, and that person simply may not be the best 
leader for the group.
Aiding the poor in a profitable way: 
The Kuroiler chicken
In March 2009, The Economist ran a story about 
the Indian social entrepreneur Vinod Kapur. 
To help feed India’s rural poor, Kapur invested 
$1 million to breed a super-chicken called the 
Kuroiler. Kuroilers are disease-resistant and 
cheap to feed. They also produce twice as 
much meat and lay five times as many eggs as 
regular Indian chickens do.
Kapur established a firm called Keggfarms 
(Kegg is a combination of Kapur and egg), 
which produces the Kuroiler. The chick-
ens have been welcomed by 700,000 rural 
households in various states in northern India. 
The system Kapur set up works like this: Kegg 
Farms supplies chickens to 1,500 mother units 
located throughout northern India. Local entre-
preneurs own these units, buying between 400 
and 2,000 birds in a single purchase. The entre-
preneurs then sell them in the nearby villages, 
via vendors on bicycles. The typical entrepre-
neur of a mother unit makes a profit of 3 Indian 
rupees (about 6¢) per bird, and so does the 
vendor on the bike.

135
 Chapter 8: For-Profit and Nonprofit: Considering Your Options
 
✓ Resentment among your target population: If the people you’re trying 
to help know that you’re making a profit, they may feel exploited. They 
may lament or even vocally protest that outsiders are making money 
from their misery.
 
✓ A snowballing preoccupation with profit: All the time and effort that 
you put into thinking about how to get more or bigger subsidies or maxi-
mize return from investments, products, or services may come at the 
expense of more effectively serving your target population.
 
The wise and thoughtful entrepreneur (that’s you, right?) steers a course 
between two distinct goals: making money and serving the target population. 
If you keep your enterprise’s mission squarely in sight, you should be able to 
steer your organization successfully.
A delicate balance: Nonprofits 
that charge user fees
User fees are fees that a nonprofit organization 
charges for the use of its services. Examples 
include park and museum admissions, hospi-
tal bills, daycare fees, and even college tuition 
fees. When you’re trying to decide whether to 
charge user fees, you have to weigh the cost 
of administering them. The organization either 
has to pay someone to collect the fees or find 
volunteers to do it.
An even bigger problem with user fees is that 
they sometimes run counter to a nonprofit 
group’s mission. You want people to use your 
services — that’s why your social enterprise 
exists in the first place, right? Token fees may 
not be much of a hindrance, but substantial 
user fees can discourage would-be patrons, 
patients, students — whoever your users are.
The decision you have to make is whether the 
additional revenue from user fees is worth the 
loss of some users. This dilemma is unique to 
nonprofit enterprises because most for-profit 
ones have no choice but to rely on such fees as 
a main part of their revenue.
One way around the dilemma is to try to deter-
mine what level of fee users will tolerate — in 
other words, at what price level will they refuse 
to patronize your nonprofit enterprise? There’s 
no magic formula here — each case is differ-
ent. All you can do is ask a sample of patrons 
what they think of a fee set at a certain amount. 
Or start charging the fee and watch what hap-
pens to your patronage.
You may want to consider charging based on 
the ability of different categories to pay. For 
example, you may charge less for children than 
for teenagers or adults. Or you may want to 
charge based on a sliding scale (higher fees for 
families with higher incomes).

136
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
Looking at the Moral Dimension 
in For-Profit Enterprises
Running a social enterprise has a moral dimension to it. This moral dimen-
sion stems from the fact that social enterprises — whether they’re nonprofit 
or for-profit — are created because someone wants to solve a social problem 
(feed the hungry, house the homeless, care for those in need).
The moral side of for-profit social entrepreneurship is expressed in, among 
other ways, the kinds of bottom lines that the entrepreneur seeks. We 
discuss three bottom lines in the following sections. The moral issues sup-
porting the mission of your enterprise help determine which type of entre-
preneurial organization you’ll want to create. These moral issues also help 
determine which bottom lines you choose to favor.
Plus, the moral dimension in for-profits extends well beyond the concern 
about bottom lines. So, later in this section we also discuss practicing corpo-
rate social responsibility and marketing with a conscience.
Double and triple bottom lines: Adding 
social and environmental good to your 
goal of turning a profit
Traditional corporations have one bottom line:
How much money are we making after paying everyone we have to pay?
The for-profit social business has that same bottom line, but it adds a second 
bottom line to it:
How much good is the enterprise doing? In other words, how much is the 
target being helped?
Adding that second bottom line is very impressive — it’s like riding a uni-
cycle and juggling at the same time.
Can a for-profit social enterprise not only earn money (the bottom line) 
and serve a social good (the second bottom line), but also serve an 

137
 Chapter 8: For-Profit and Nonprofit: Considering Your Options
environmental good (the third bottom line)? Isn’t that like juggling while 
riding a unicycle along a tightrope? The environmental benefit we’re talk-
ing about is, for example, an improvement in the condition of some part of 
nature such as water, air, soil, or animals. You accomplish this improvement 
in a way that is sustainable, that will endure over time, and that does not, in 
the process, undermine another part of nature.
Is a triple bottom line possible? Yes! Two nearby sidebars — “Terra Nova: 
A Brazilian success story” and “Symbio Impex: The triple bottom line in 
agriculture” — give examples.
Terra Nova: A Brazilian success story
André L. Cavalcanti de Albuquerque estab-
lished an organization in São Paulo, Brazil 
called Terra Nova Regularizações Fundiárias. 
He wanted to establish a procedure to legalize, 
in a sustainable way, urban land that is illegally 
occupied, most notably in favelas (urban slum 
communities).
Terra Nova mediates between the people who 
legally own a piece of property and those who 
have come to live on it illegally. The goal is to 
find a solution to this problem that both par-
ties can accept. Terra Nova is the first non-
governmental organization in Brazil to become 
involved in land regularization. Before, the ser-
vice was almost exclusively offered by govern-
ment, but given inefficiency, shortage of funds, 
and overloaded staff, government was often 
unable to deliver as needed. Those deficiencies 
were part of the social problem that inspired de 
Albuquerque to found Terra Nova.
Terra Nova has been a success story. Every 
community regularized by de Albuquerque has 
seen a rise in the quality of low-income family 
life. As soon as the town council sees a title 
deed provided by the local land office, it begins 
offering such necessities as water, electricity, 
basic sanitation, public transport, and even a 
postal code.
What is environmental and sustainable 
about the Terra Nova project? What is its triple 
bottom line? Local soil and water have been 
improved by providing sanitation services and 
purified water from an external source. Other 
benefits relate to the second bottom line: 
improvements in public transport, mail service, 
and lighting.
For-profit enterprises have a bad reputation in 
Brazil, so it took courage for de Albuquerque 
to establish a social business. He says that 
Terra Nova is not out to build up and hang on 
to capital. He believes the problem should be 
viewed independently of the power and attrac-
tiveness of money. With a for-profit approach 
to solving this kind of social problem, he can 
make enough money to stretch the service to 
many more people than would be possible were 
the enterprise founded on a nonprofit basis. 
De Albuquerque says that, if his profits allow, 
he would like to expand Terra Nova’s opera-
tions to the rest of Latin America and to Africa.

138
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
Practicing corporate social responsibility
The phrase corporate social responsibility (CSR) means different things to dif-
ferent people. We define it as the way businesses (including for-profit social 
businesses) coordinate their organizational values and actions with the 
needs and expectations of the stakeholders (customers, shareholders, other 
investors, employees, regulators, the community at large, and special inter-
est groups).
If you plan to set up a for-profit social enterprise, you may want to develop 
a statement describing and proclaiming your CSR. Doing so demonstrates to 
your stakeholders a commitment to monitoring the effects of your operations 
on your local community and society at large. Your statement should declare 
how you’ll maximize societal benefits while minimizing the costs to the com-
munity. For example, your statement may emphasize the large number of 
people you employ who make a reasonably priced product using pollution 
controls that keep local air and water acceptably clean.
Enlightened employment policies can also be a part of your enterprise’s CSR. 
Your statement on CSR may contain information on, for example, how your 
company fairly handles employee grievances, assures equity in pay and pro-
motion, and exceeds industry-wide health and safety standards.
Symbio Impex: The triple bottom line in agriculture
Tokya E. Dammond is the president of Symbio 
Impex Corporation, which he, Symbio Polska, 
and Artur Tyminski founded in 1998 in the United 
States. Using a Polish/American venture-cap-
ital fund, the three created a company that 
contracted small family-owned farms and land-
scape parks to produce and process Polish-
grown organic fruits and vegetables.
Symbio started with 20 farms, but today the 
company works with more than 300 farms, sell-
ing produce to the European Union and North 
American industrial and retail markets. The 
company gained $4.5 million in revenues in 
2006 — taking care of the first bottom line.
The company also helps solve a social problem 
by paying a fair price to small family farms for 
their organic produce, which addresses the 
second bottom line. Small family farms are in 
danger of disappearing in the face of competi-
tion from giant factory farms.
And, when it comes to the third bottom line, 
Symbio achieves environmental sustainability 
through organic farming. Healthy soil is cre-
ated to produce healthy plants, which have 
high immunity against plant diseases and 
pests. Organic farming recycles natural materi-
als back into the soil, thereby sustaining fertility 
and creating a natural approach to controlling 
pests and disease. This cyclical process, say 
the Symbio executives, eliminates the need for 
artificial fertilizer, chemical pesticides, growth 
hormones, and similar unnatural additives.

139
 Chapter 8: For-Profit and Nonprofit: Considering Your Options
Some CSR statements contain passages concerning a company’s relations 
with the community — for example, in support of the arts, youth activities, 
or municipal parks. The statement may include information about how your 
company helps workers’ families and provides them with company-sponsored 
events such as Christmas parties, summer picnics, and special outings.
 
Post your CSR statement conspicuously on your Web site, summarize it in 
your corporate brochures, and speak about it at public gatherings involv-
ing your enterprise. Remember: You’ll always have to live down the popular 
image that businesses are greedy entities strictly concerned with their own 
interests, and your CSR statement can help you do exactly that.
Because CSR statements, at least in the larger corporations, tend to be lengthy, 
we suggest you go online to view examples. For example, McDonald’s has 
one at www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/csr.html. Ford Motor Company 
pitches its CSR in terms of corporate sustainability at www.ford.com/about
ford/company-information/corporate-sustainability. And Walmart 
Canada offers a 24-page report titled “Corporate Social Responsibility” at www.
walmart.ca.
 
Showing CSR is not pure altruism. Certain advantages accrue to companies 
that parade their CSR. Some of these advantages include the following:
 
✓ CSR can improve access to capital. People like to invest their money in 
companies that show CSR.
 
✓ CSR can reduce bad publicity. Showing social responsibility can lower 
the risk of opposition from parties outside the company who are upset 
with a company’s disagreeable policies and practices.
 
✓ CSR can increase good publicity. The public relations impact of high 
CSR can be worth its weight in gold. That is, the company’s product 
basks favorably in the light of exemplary behavior in the community.
 
✓ CSR can expand markets and save money. Exemplary CSR may even 
generate new markets for a company’s product. CSR may also gener-
ate previously unknown opportunities for saving money in production, 
manufacturing, or distribution. (For example, switching from oil-based 
to soy-based manufacturing can save a company money.)
 
✓ CSR can help recruitment and hiring. Many people want to work for an 
enterprise known for its fine CSR. Conversely, they don’t want to work for 
companies whose CSR leaves much to be desired, such as those who have 
a bad reputation for environmental pollution or exploitation of employees.
 
The form of CSR that may be of most interest to you as a social entrepreneur 
could be a partnership between your for-profit social enterprise and a pri-
vate company with no social mission. Such a partnership can create profit 
and social value. Can you team with a corporation to advance your entrepre-
neurial mission so that the corporation can both profit and demonstrate its 
responsibility to community or society? It may be worth a try.

140
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
Some companies, inspired by the principles of CSR, prefer to support a social 
enterprise related to their interests instead of giving unspecified donations 
to foundations and other nonprofits. Philip Kotler and Nancy Lee present a 
variety of examples of successful partnerships in their book Corporate Social 
Responsibility: Doing the Most Good for Your Company and Your Cause (Wiley).
Marketing with a conscience
The most obvious and common way for your social enterprise to become 
involved with the market and make some money is to try to sell one or more 
of your products or services. (We illustrate this approach in the sidebar 
“Aiding the poor in a profitable way: The Kuroiler chicken,” earlier in this 
chapter.) But you have to sell with a conscience. In addition, there are sev-
eral other approaches that social enterprises may take to exploit the market.
 
Beyond just starting to sell your goods and services in the marketplace, you 
can market your products or services with a conscience. The main idea is that 
you want both to promote your enterprise and make some money in a manner 
that is morally acceptable to you, your colleagues in the enterprise, other 
stakeholders, and the wider community:
 
✓ Rent out your brand. A social enterprise can make available to a for-
profit (non-social) enterprise its reputation as a trustworthy and socially 
beneficial organization. The business then pays the social enterprise for 
use of this asset. Affinity credit cards are a well-known example, as are 
some minibuses that serve disabled people.
 
✓ Endorse someone else’s brand. A social enterprise can endorse a par-
ticular business brand and receive payment from the company selling 
the branded good or service. The American Cancer Society entered 
into such an agreement with several manufacturers of nicotine patches. 
What would prevent a hospital from naming a visitors’ lounge in recogni-
tion of the local corporate sponsor who pays for its construction and 
operation? (You could imagine the “Caravel Room,” after a local dairy, 
or the “Lakers Lounge,” after the professional basketball team.)
 
✓ Form an exclusive brand partnership. A social enterprise may sell or 
license its services to a corporate sponsor, for which the corporation 
pays the nonprofit. A common example these days is corporate support 
of educational programs and institutions, such as Coca-Cola gaining the 
exclusive rights to the sale of soft drinks on a university campus or a 
caterer gaining exclusive access to all catered food in a large museum.
 
✓ Sell or license intellectual property rights. A social enterprise may earn 
money from certain intellectual property rights. This contested practice 
is evident, for example, when a company offers a research grant contract 
to a university if the university gives privileged access to the results of the 
research. There may even be some advantages for the company in terms 
of eventually gaining patents through such an exchange.

 Chapter 8: For-Profit and Nonprofit: Considering Your Options
What do non-social businesses get out of such liaisons? If all goes as planned, 
they can add to their profits in new ways. They may also want to bask in the 
greenwashing effect, or enhanced public image that can sometimes develop 
from being positively linked with a respected community good or service.
 
These ideas are best suited for established social organizations. If you’re 
a small startup, you won’t be able to do these things until you grow large 
enough.
 
Sometimes, making liaisons like this can be like selling your soul to the devil. 
Such partnerships can change the culture of the nonprofit. People who raise 
money through these external funding sources can easily lose sight of the 
enterprise’s goals. Plus, if they succeed in getting the funding, they’re likely to 
get all kinds of kudos within the enterprise — possibly at the expense of other 
volunteers and employees whose contributions are directly related to the 
enterprise’s mission, which can send mixed messages about what the group 
really values.
Considering Capitalistic Concerns 
in Nonprofit Enterprises
Capitalism, it turns out, can be quite useful to the development and run-
ning of social enterprises. The traditional goal in investing is simply to make 
money, but making money isn’t always possible in social entrepreneurial mis-
sions, which may make a little money, break even, or lose money. Here’s the 
good news: Some capitalists with a conscience and funds to donate want to 
help organizations reach their socially oriented missions. Their chief interest 
is to make the world a better place, and they’re willing to put their money 
where their mouths are.
Philanthrocapitalism: 
Capitalism with a twist
Philanthrocapitalism is different from mainstream for-profit capitalism. 
Philanthrocapitalism is the realm of individual philanthropists who have 
money to burn and a burning desire to help solve key social or environmental 
problems, but who are — for one reason or another — unable to tackle these 
problems on their own. They can work with nonprofits to reach their chari-
table goals.

142
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
 
Philanthrocapitalism is about applying business principles to using large 
amounts of money in solving social problems and, in the course of doing so, 
fostering social change.
Still, the philanthrocapitalist’s relationship to nonprofit social entrepreneur-
ship is complicated. A philanthrocapitalist is not opposed to making money 
through a social enterprise, even though his first goal is to help solve a social 
problem. Philanthrocapitalists, when not working through government, work 
through the nonprofit sector — but if a good or service produced there also 
becomes profitable, they’re typically quite pleased to make money on their 
investments.
Among the most celebrated philanthrocapitalists today are Warren Buffett, 
Bill Gates, and Bill Clinton. Buffett gave a large proportion of his enormous 
fortune to the foundation established by Gates: the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation. Internationally, that charity has donated large sums of money 
to social enterprises whose missions are to enhance healthcare and reduce 
extreme poverty.
Founded on the financial acumen of Bill Clinton, the William J. Clinton 
Foundation operates in four areas: health security; economic empowerment; 
leadership development and citizen service; and racial, ethnic, and religious 
reconciliation. The William J. Clinton Foundation works mainly in partnerships 
with like-minded individuals, organizations, corporations, and governments.
These are among the most dramatic and publicly visible manifestations 
of philanthrocapitalism. But smaller fortunes may be deployed the same 
way, usually directed to problems more local in scope. Mathew Bishop and 
Michael Green’s book, Philanthrocapitalism: How the Rich Can Save the World 
(Bloomsbury Press), profiles a number of philanthrocapitalists, all of whom 
have vast fortunes to give to social entrepreneurial causes.
 
The point in all this for you is that you can’t overlook philanthrocapitalism — 
large scale or small — as a source of funding for your mission. But how 
do you find a philanthrocapitalist? A good way is to write to them. You 
can reach Matthew Bishop and Michael Green, for example, at www.
philanthrocapitalism.net/contact. Or write the New York office 
of the Clinton Foundation at William J. Clinton Foundation, 55 West 125th 
Street, New York, NY 10027. Whomever you write, tell them who you are 
and what your enterprise does, and ask whether they would be interested in 
receiving a more detailed proposal for funding. It can’t hurt, and you’d be sur-
prised at the response a modest personal request can generate.

Venture philanthropy: The work 
of fairy godcapitalists
In venture philanthropy, a capitalist applies venture capital approaches 
among nonprofit groups to help them obtain not just grants but also tech-
nical assistance, networking opportunities, and other support services. 
Venture philanthropy is a way to improve the effectiveness of philanthropic 
foundations. Such philanthropy becomes a kind of social investing because 
it uses the discipline of the investment world in a field that has traditionally 
relied on trust and good faith.
 
Venture capital, by the way, is risk capital, or money put up for speculative 
investment.
So what’s the difference between a venture philanthropist and a charitable 
foundation? The equity holders in venture capital enterprises serve as part-
ners, coaches, and guides of the new business supported by their capital. 
In other words, they don’t just give money the way foundations do — they 
follow the money and make sure it’s being spent wisely. In addition, this kind 
of hands-on approach leads to long-term sharing of risk and investment in 
organizational structure and growth.
 
If you want to establish your enterprise as a business, and you can find ven-
ture philanthropy to support your mission, consider yourself very lucky. Go 
for it! In the United States, check out the National Venture Capital Association 
(www.nvca.org) and search for those capitalists possibly interested in 
investing in social enterprise. The Canada Venture Capital and Private Equity 
Association provides a long list of members (venture capitalists) on its Web 
site (www.cvca.ca/membership/directory).
 
Foundations often fail to gives grants as effectively as venture capitalists do. 
Foundations often invest haphazardly in new ideas. Plus, they rarely give orga-
nizational support or demand accountability.
Granting agencies never move out of the role of funder to that of part-
ner. Whereas a partner — a venture philanthropist — shares the risks of 
the enterprise. Of course, that partner also shares in any successes and 
hopefully, as a result, makes a profit. This kind of partner takes an active 
role investor role there. For example, Cordova Ventures says its partner-
ship includes ownership with “a minority stake” in the funded enterprise. 
Moreover, venture capitalists usually provide expertise on how to achieve 
entrepreneurial success and make valuable connections to people, agencies, 
and organizations that can also help you reach this goal.

Socially responsible investing
Socially responsible investing (SRI) is an investment process that considers 
the social and environmental consequences of investments, both positive 
and negative. Consideration of the consequences takes place within the 
framework of rigorous financial analysis. SRI involves both nonprofit and for-
profit organizations through different arrangements.
 
SRI is often referred to as a holistic approach to investing because it takes 
account of financial, social, environmental, and ethical criteria when choosing 
investments.
What does SRI have to do with social entrepreneurship? As a social entrepre-
neur, you stand to benefit from SRI in two ways:
 
✓ Some investors seeking responsible investments donate their money 
to venture philanthropic organizations. Individual philanthropic ven-
ture capitalists are, by definition, engaging in SRI. For example, the 
Investor Education Fund lists “community investment” as a method 
of social investment. In this case, a person invests money in commu-
nity development or micro-enterprise initiatives that contribute to the 
growth and well being of specific communities. Your enterprise could 
become the object of such investment.
 
✓ Your enterprise may want to invest money that’s not immediately 
needed for operations or not eligible for support of operations. 
Investing using SRI is a perfectly legitimate process for nonprofit organi-
zations of all kinds.
 
When a nonprofit enterprise hires a new financial advisor or new manager 
of its investment portfolio, the board of directors has to make sure that the 
person is qualified and that she’s serving your enterprise well. When consider-
ing any financial expert:
 
✓ Make sure you understand all the risks associated with any investment 
made by you and your enterprise.
 
✓ Never turn over money to a manager whom you believe lacks experi-
ence, appears incompetent, or is known to be unethical.
 
✓ Always assess on your own each investment made by your enterprise 
and the manager of your enterprise’s portfolio. This rule is especially 
important when she’s still new on the job.
 
Your enterprise, when and if you eventually turn it into a business, won’t ever 
be a typical for-profit corporation. It has an important public mission, and this 
mission may well be expected by the public to influence its investment deci-
sions. Therefore, always consider socially responsible investing as it relates to 
that mission.

Funding Nonprofits
In This Chapter
▶ Finding out about charitable status
▶ Setting dues and dues structures
▶ Raising funds
▶ Getting donations and battling donor fatigue
▶ Seeking out external support
▶ Coming up with good grant proposals
T
he vast majority of social enterprises need external funding of some sort. 
By external funding, we mean financial support that comes from sources 
other than (a) the pockets of the social entrepreneur and his partners, or 
(b) the revenues from sales that are plowed back into the operating costs of 
running the organization. Most social enterprises need to supplement such 
internal funding with money from outside sources.
 
Exceptions include the diverse small enterprises that are formed to make lim-
ited changes in the local community. These social enterprises are sometimes 
established to transform an aspect of municipal government, local industry, 
school policy, or community habit (such as littering, panhandling, speeding, 
or loitering). Don’t get us wrong — such undertakings may well require con-
siderable time and effort, but they’re often all-volunteer affairs and can suc-
ceed with little or no money.
If your social enterprise is a nonprofit, you’ll likely need outside funding — 
and this chapter is for you. (If your enterprise is a social business or is a 
small, limited concern such as the ones just described, and you don’t think 
you need to raise money to succeed, you can safely skip this chapter.)

146
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
Achieving Charitable Status
A social enterprise can obtain charitable status only after becoming a legal 
entity — that is, after it has been officially incorporated. Charitable status 
refers to legal recognition of a social enterprise as a special kind of nonprofit 
group known as a charity. (We cover the details of different types of legal 
status in Chapter 14.)
Legal and charitable statuses are closely intertwined with funding. To obtain 
external funding, your enterprise must usually
 
✓ Be incorporated: Becoming legally incorporated establishes your legal 
status.
 
✓ Be established as a charity: Many, though not all, funders require chari-
table status for funding.
 
Most of the best funding out there depends on having charitable status.
A charity usually has the following characteristics:
 
✓ It’s formally organized as an incorporated nonprofit.
 
✓ It provides one or more public benefits (as opposed to member 
benefits).
 
✓ It receives a significant amount of its revenue from donations.
In the United States, many charities (technically called public charities) are 
registered with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as 501(c)(3) groups and 
qualify as such under IRS Section 509(a). Charities registered like this are 
eligible to receive tax-deductible charitable gifts of money or in kind. (In-kind 
gifts are something other than money, such as goods or services. Donating 
rare books to a public library or land for a nonprofit homeless shelter are 
examples of gifts in kind.)
 
If a charitable gift is tax-deductible, it means the donor gets to deduct the 
amount of the donation from her taxable income, thus lowering her own tax 
bill. Tax deduction is a substantial incentive for potential donors. Of course, 
people or organizations may donate to nonprofit enterprises that lack chari-
table status, and some individuals and groups do precisely that — but they 
don’t get a tax deduction for it. The possibility of a tax deduction, especially 
for large donations, is a powerful incentive to give. So, if you can achieve 
501(c)(3) status, you should — it’ll increase your chances of getting charitable 
donations.

147
 Chapter 9: It Doesn’t Grow on Trees: Funding Nonprofits
Be aware, however, that 501(c) identifies 26 types of nonprofit organizations 
exempt from some federal income taxes. The types vary as to their impact on 
the mission of your enterprise. For example, a 501(c)3 cannot lobby a legisla-
tive body (or endorse a specific candidate for president), but others can.
 
Several of the grants available are open only to 501(c)3s that have been in 
existence for more than a year. If your organization is newly formed, you may 
want to “borrow” the charitable status of another organization. This is per-
fectly legal, and there are organizations, such as Acterra (www.acterra.org) 
that openly advertise for this type of fiscal sponsorship. Going this route is a 
way to get around those grants requiring a minimum period in business.
You Gotta Pay Your Dues
Many social enterprises require their members to pay dues — normally an 
annual fee — for rights of membership in the group. Dues are usually the 
main source of revenue for national enterprises. For smaller, grassroots 
enterprises, dues are often the only source of revenue. A major question, 
then, especially at the beginning of a dues-based social enterprise, revolves 
around how much a member pays in dues.
By way of example, to join Amnesty International, members must make a 
donation. Benefits include a subscription to Amnesty magazine, members-
only specials at the Amnesty online store, and exclusive access to the 
Members Area at www.amnestyusa.org. The Sierra Club — dedicated to 
protecting America’s natural resources — gives the following benefits to its 
dues-paying members: a one-year subscription to Sierra magazine; access to 
members-only outdoor adventures; automatic membership in the local chap-
ter; and discounts on Sierra Club calendars, books, and other merchandise. 
People who pay the fee to join the Association of Children’s Museums, which 
represents and advocates for children’s museums, receive various benefits. 
These include: access to the members-only Web site, discounts on publica-
tions and programs, subscription to Hand to Hand (a professional and schol-
arly journal), and subscription to E-Forum (a newsletter of museum news and 
marketing opportunities).
Deciding how much to charge in dues
Where dues are the only source of revenue, they must cover your overhead 
(the costs of operating your enterprise).

148
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
 
One way of keeping dues to a minimum — which helps attract and keep 
members — is to minimize your costs. Of course, you have to be careful that 
your cost cutting doesn’t lead to inefficient or ineffective delivery of benefits 
to the target, because that could undermine your mission and upset your 
members. You have to strike a balance.
 
Your members have joined the enterprise to help it achieve its mission. So the 
ball is often in your court as leader of the enterprise to try to persuade mem-
bers to accept annual dues that are high enough to enable its work, but not so 
high that they turn off potential members.
The more members you have, the more dues the enterprise takes in. So, 
another approach to keeping dues as low as possible is to recruit more mem-
bers. This strategy spreads the expense of running the enterprise across 
more pocketbooks. Plus, increasing membership is a good strategy, as long 
as you can find enough new members — and as long as you can still manage 
the organization when it grows in size.
Maximizing the efficiency of your dues
You have a few ways to tinker with your dues in order to find that perfect bal-
ance of enough members paying reasonable dues.
Membership drives
One way of raising the number of members is to conduct a membership drive 
(a formal campaign designed to bring in new dues-paying members). In a typi-
cal membership drive, each dues-paying member may be asked to recruit one 
or two new members. Alternatively, a member who brings in more — say, five 
new members — would get a free membership for that year or win a prize.
 
For smaller grassroots enterprises, membership drives are often disappoint-
ing. The fact is, raising money for any cause is difficult. The average citizen 
is bombarded almost daily with such requests. Plus, he doesn’t have nearly 
enough money to give to his favorite causes, let alone to the others that are 
(sometimes disagreeably) brought to his attention. Professional fundraisers 
are trained to avoid the many hurdles that spring up while trying to raise 
money in the community, but their services aren’t cheap.
Dues structure
Another option for raising enough money through dues is to develop a dues 
structure (a sliding scale of payment that changes according to the annual 
income of members). The size and range of categories of income depend on 
how well off your members are.

149
 Chapter 9: It Doesn’t Grow on Trees: Funding Nonprofits
If your enterprise consists of lower-income people trying to establish micro-
financing for local small businesses, then maybe your members will pay noth-
ing, or very little. (An exception might be asking higher dues from those with 
viable businesses that the enterprise helped develop.) On the other hand, if 
your enterprise attracts compassionate people from the middle and upper-
middle classes, then you may be able to ask for an increasingly higher mem-
bership fee based on their annual income.
 
A sliding scale like the following is common, with each successive level paying 
higher dues:
 
✓ Under $40,000
 
✓ $40,000 to $59,999
 
✓ $60,000 to $79,999
 
✓ $80,000 to $99,999
 
✓ More than $100,000
That’s just a typical setup. Feel free to invent your own scale to suit your 
members’ economic situations. A sliding scale is also typically used for com-
panies that join as members, and is based on each company’s revenue.
 
The income category a member claims is self-reported. Don’t try to try to 
verify the figures using some external measure because that can lead to 
awkward revelations and even confrontations. A dues structure is an honor 
system among people eager to do their best for the social enterprise and its 
cause.
Keeping dues low with additional funding
You may be able to keep dues affordable if 
you can find other money to supplement them. 
Eliminating dues is not usually a viable alterna-
tive, and keeping some dues can actually help 
you find additional funding: Funding agencies 
normally like to see some tangible commitment 
from members, and dues are clear evidence of 
that.
The average number of volunteer hours per 
member may also serve the same purpose. In 
that case, funding agencies may ask that, using 
a standard formula, you estimate the monetary 
value of the hours your volunteers have given 
to your enterprise during a specified period of 
time, often the past fiscal year.

150
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
Special corporate fee
Still another option is to establish a special fee for corporate members — this 
fee is typically higher than the fee paid by ordinary members. A special fee 
works well in situations where having corporate members is feasible. Here, 
too, the amount of the fee depends on what the traffic will bear, as well as 
what the corporate members get from participating in your enterprise and 
whether they’re willing to pay the special fee.
Dues can often be offset by “member benefits” — when you donate to PBS, 
for example, you get a free DVD or tote bag. Other social organizations secure 
a discount at sympathetic business (for example, a 10 percent discount at a 
local bookstore for members), which is another way to maximize dues effi-
ciency. Additional examples of such benefits were presented earlier in this 
section on paying dues.
Putting the Fun in Fundraising
Simply put, fundraising is successfully persuading an external individual or 
organization to provide financial support for your enterprise. There are four 
basic types of fundraising:
 
✓ Ongoing funding
 
✓ Episodic funding
 
✓ Capital campaign
 
✓ Planned giving
Ongoing funding
There are four types of ongoing funding:
 
✓ Annual fund: You make an annual appeal to known or likely contributors.
 
✓ Ongoing sales of products or services: Girl Scout cookies are a well-
known example of ongoing sales of products. More ordinary examples may 
include holding a weeklong car wash every May, selling chocolate bars in 
September, and conducting a recycling drive at six-month intervals.
 
✓ Program and project grants: This type of funding is earmarked for a 
certain program or project and is commonly designed to last for the 
duration of the project or, in the case of programs, a specified number 
of years.
 
✓ Raffles, lotteries, and auctions: In each of these events, your enterprise, 
as sponsor, keeps a portion of the money that people pay to participate. 

151
 Chapter 9: It Doesn’t Grow on Trees: Funding Nonprofits
In the typical raffle, each participant buys a ticket that has a chance of 
being randomly selected. The holder of the winning ticket wins some-
thing (for example, two passes to a cinema or dinner for two at a local 
restaurant). The money collected also pays for the prize. With a lottery, 
a sum of money is usually the prize. In a charitable auction, people 
donate objects of value such as art, books, or recordings that are auc-
tioned off to the highest bidder.
 
 We classify raffles, lotteries, and auctions as ongoing funding. Some 
enterprises may hold them as one-shot or sporadic events, which would 
be episodic funding (see the next section).
Episodic funding
Episodic funding may occur as a one-shot grant given by a foundation or cor-
poration. A program or a project of yours may benefit from episodic funding, 
but you also may look for such funding for special events (such as confer-
ences, festivals, or training sessions). The sometimes lavish awards given 
nowadays by a variety of corporate donors for excellence in social entrepre-
neurial work are also a kind of episodic funding.
 
Google social entrepreneur awards to find lists of donors and their programs.
Capital campaign
A capital campaign is solicitation of money for something specific that is 
important to your mission, such as a building, parcel of land, or expensive 
piece of equipment. Fundraising of this type also includes money to augment 
an endowment fund or to support a major research project.
Capital campaigns can be very successful, even if the amount of money 
you’re seeking is substantial. Often what makes contributing to them enticing 
for donors is the prospect of receiving permanent recognition for their gen-
erosity. For example, you name a building, room, endowment fund (see the 
next section), or space (such as a park, forest, or garden) after the principal 
benefactor.
You can use a sliding scale for these campaigns — smaller donations are 
given relatively minor recognition (such as the donor’s name etched on a 
brick or a chair or bench, whereas larger donations are recognized by, for 
example, naming a room or building after the benefactor.

152
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
 
Another way to make capital campaigns more effective and more appealing to 
donors is to locate matching funding from, say, government or the private 
sector. For example, if your enterprise can raise $10,000 for a piece of equip-
ment, there may be a program in your state government that will match that 
sum, giving you the $20,000 you need to buy it. The fact that matching funding 
exists is a selling point for would-be individual donors because they see that 
they may double the value of their donation.
 
Make sure to frame the capital campaign in terms of your mission and the 
needs of your target of benefits. In considering the possibility of donating 
money for research or a new building, for example, donors may lose sight of 
the larger purpose of your enterprise. So you should be sure that they under-
stand how that research or building will aid in the pursuit of your mission.
Planned giving
In planned giving a donor arranges to legally give money or other assets to a 
social enterprise at a specified time in the future, such as upon the death of 
the donor.
 
A bequest like this one can also be said to be a kind of episodic funding — 
because you die only once.
Planned giving may wind up in an endowment. In an endowment, one or more 
donors give money to a nonprofit group. They typically intend for the fund’s 
principal to be held in an interest-bearing account for a long period of time, 
if not permanently. They also intend for earnings from investments of the 
principal to be used to cover operating expenses, which may include those 
incurred in getting grants. Endowments, whose principals are not to be used, 
are usually invested in some way, the interest from which is often restricted 
to helping further the mission of the enterprise.
Social enterprises may also use the interest from their endowments to run 
certain aspects of the organization, as long as they conform to the conditions 
of the endowment. Colleges and universities are examples — they sometimes 
use interest from their endowments to finance professorships (“chairs”) as 
well as scholarships and fellowships for students.
Hiring out your fundraising
You may try your own fundraising or rely on the efforts of an intermediary. 
A fundraising intermediary, itself a nonprofit group, is an organization that 
specializes in raising funds from the public. It uses the money gathered to 

153
 Chapter 9: It Doesn’t Grow on Trees: Funding Nonprofits
make philanthropic grants to other nonprofits. The most celebrated example 
of a fundraising intermediary in North America is the United Way. Catholic 
Charities USA and the Combined Federal Campaign are also intermediaries.
If you’re interested in seeking funding from a fundraising intermediary, 
contact it directly about this interest. For the United Way, visit www.
unitedway.org/worldwide, where you can contact your local branch. 
The Combined Federal Campaign invites national and international indepen-
dent organizations to apply to participate in its annual campaign.
Fundraising intermediaries generate money by way of payroll deductions. In 
the typical case, workers authorize deduction of a portion of their paychecks. 
The money accumulated in this manner is sent to the intermediary. The char-
ity then distributes the money to various charities in the local community.
A fundraising alternative is a nonprofit organization that attempts to serve as 
a viable alternative to the larger, well-established federated fundraising inter-
mediaries like the United Way. Alternative federated funds are usually distinc-
tive in their focus on a coherent set or “package” of charities and nonprofit 
groups as the ultimate recipients of the money raised. Health charities, inter-
national aid/development charities, nonprofits focusing on women’s issues, 
African American nonprofits, and environmental nonprofits are all examples 
of fundraising alternatives. Many alternative federated funds are social-
change-oriented and, thus, are naturally receptive to social entrepreneurial 
initiatives.
Finding a fundraising alternative suitable to your needs may take a bit of 
research. As is often the case, the Web is as good as a resource as you’ll find. 
Using charities as your base word, search for the package that best describes 
your enterprise. If it’s in the field of religion, for example, search for “reli-
gious charities” or “Jewish charities.” In the area of sports, search for “sports 
charities” or more specifically, “baseball charities.”
 
The United Way strongly resists such alternative federated funds competing 
for charitable donations gained through corporate and governmental pay-
roll deductions. As a result, alternative funds, which are smaller and more 
focused, have found it difficult to gather money in this way. One reason is that 
they lack the broad, traditional acceptance in industry and government that 
the United Way and the other well-established federated intermediaries enjoy.
 
There are professional fundraisers for hire who raise funds for profit. They 
typically act like agents and take a percentage of what they bring in. In order 
to work with your organization, they’ll want to make sure your mission, goals, 
and messaging are all in order before they’re willing to work with you.

Finding Donors and Preventing 
Their Fatigue
A donor is a person or group who makes, not surprisingly, a donation. In the 
eyes of the person or group receiving the donor’s donation — in other words, 
you! — the donor is a benefactor. In social entrepreneurship, donations (also 
called philanthropy) tend to be gifts of money, goods, or property to a non-
profit group without expectation of direct, immediate economic benefit for 
the donor. Donations are a central source of revenue for charities.
Strictly speaking, a donation is a non-labor contribution — meaning, it 
doesn’t involve volunteer time. Many donations qualify as charitable contri-
butions and are tax deductible, though that’s only the case — and you know 
this by now, right? — if the enterprise has acquired charitable status.
Donors are great, but often they’re people who have a lot of money, which 
means you aren’t the only enterprise vying for their attention. Sometimes 
donors get tired of being donors and feel they’re being asked to do too much 
for too many organizations. Donor fatigue is the reluctance of a donor to give 
any more money to a particular charity. Such a condition commonly results 
when a charity has made excessive financial demands on the donor — and 
the definition of excessive is really dependent on the donor (some donors 
tolerate more requests for money than other donors do). When donor fatigue 
hits, the result is temporary loss of interest in making donations. Donors suf-
fering from such fatigue have made one or more previous donations but have 
decided that they’ve now reached their monetary limit. (Donor fatigue differs 
from compassion burnout — see Chapter 18.)
Fundraisers often focus on donor renewal, targeting return donors, in their 
attempt to attract them again to a particular cause. Donor renewal requires 
significantly less effort than trying to entice new donors does. The logic 
behind this strategy is that fatigued donors are usually still sympathetic to 
your cause — they’ve just run out of money. With the passage of time, they’ll 
probably be in a position to give again. Give the wallets of fatigued donors a 
rest, and given their favorable attitudes toward your charity, they may con-
tribute anew.
What about trying to find new donors? The only problem here is that you 
don’t know how potential new donors feel about your cause. Some people 
will be inclined to give, and others won’t. So, spending time and money trying 
to generate new donations often has an even lower rate of success than 
trying it with fatigued donors does.
So how do you combat donor fatigue?

155
 Chapter 9: It Doesn’t Grow on Trees: Funding Nonprofits
 
You might want to try persuading government entities to create temporary tax 
breaks for contributions made to specified causes — a strategy that works 
well with natural disasters and other emergency hardship situations. Visit 
www.irs.gov and search for the file entitled “Disaster Relief — Resources for 
Charities and Contributors” (or go to www.irs.gov/charities/charitable/
article/0,,id=149938,00.html). You may also want to allow donors to 
direct their money toward certain aspects of the target of benefits. Maybe if 
they know that their money is going directly to buy school supplies for kids 
this fall, they’ll be more likely to donate.
 
Another good way to keep a fatigued donor involved is to ask her to donate 
her time and connections instead of money for a specific fundraising event. 
For example, opening up the donor’s home for a fundraising dinner party 
allows the organization to acknowledge the past generosity of the fatigued 
donor, while being introduced to several potentially new donors.
 
In the final analysis, relieving donor fatigue is most effectively accomplished 
by getting to know your donors and learning what motivates them to give 
to your enterprise. We aren’t suggesting that you mount a research project 
to gather such information — although that might well produce some useful 
results. But you can accomplish a great deal by chatting informally with a 
reasonably representative, but small, sample of potential donors about how 
they view your enterprise and its mission. Such information can help you 
frame a donor appeal to these people, in harmony with their views on life and 
your target of benefits, such that they’ll be more inclined than otherwise to 
respond with a donation.
Finding External Financial Support
If dues, fundraising, and donors don’t cut the mustard, you may want to seek 
external support for your social enterprise. You may do this by contacting 
one of more of the following sources:
 
✓ Foundations
 
✓ Government entities
 
✓ Private sector sources
 
✓ Individuals or corporations who will give in-kind donations
Foundations
The word foundation has a variety of meanings, but in terms of social entre-
preneurship, we mean a nonprofit group, usually one with a substantial 
endowment and (in the United States) a special tax status as a private 

156
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
foundation. Basically, a foundation is an organization that manages a pool of 
money and gives it away through philanthropic grants to individuals, non-
profits, or both. Such foundations have a long history in the United States 
and many other countries.
Many foundations are national in scope. Community foundations are local 
nonprofit organizations established to grant money to other, usually local 
or regional, service-producing nonprofit groups. These foundations differ 
mainly in their lack of a sizeable endowment that is the hallmark of large 
private foundations. Community foundations raise money through (mostly 
local) donations and grants. They also receive money from donors who don’t 
care to bother establishing an independent foundation themselves, whatever 
its geographic scope.
Another kind of foundation not to be overlooked is the family foundation. 
Its funds come from members of a certain family, typically with at least one 
family member being on the foundation’s board of directors/trustees and 
playing a significant role in governing the foundation. It is the most common 
type of foundation in the United States. Among the many family founda-
tions in the United States are the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and the 
Rockefeller Foundation. These charities often are devoted to a funding a spe-
cific category.
 
A good place to start looking for foundations in your community or country 
is the Internet. Entering the name of your community or state plus the word 
foundations into your favorite search engine is likely to turn up a number of 
foundations. You can also check published directories of national and local 
foundations — many libraries stock these directories — but the Internet gives 
more complete and updated results and is certainly easier to access.
 
Foundations have specific annual deadlines for their grant application pro-
cess. In doing your research, note the deadlines ahead of time and create a 
grant-writing calendar, so you’re prepared and don’t miss any deadlines.
Examples of published directories include The Foundation Directory, 29th 
Edition, edited by David G. Jacobs (Foundation Center) and The Europa 
International Foundation Directory, 17th Edition, by Cathy Hartley (Europa 
Publications). Local, state, and regional foundations also publish directories, 
as do foundations devoted to supporting certain groups such as Jewish inter-
ests, educational research, and the disabled. See also the Foundation Center 
(www.foundationcenter.org), with offices around the country offering 
free or cheap classes for organizations looking for funding.
 
If you’re fortunate enough to run a large, long-established social enterprise, 
you can establish your own private foundation. Many such social entrepre-
neurial foundations have earned fine reputations in their fields of operation. 
Some people with money are more willing to donate to a foundation that has 

157
 Chapter 9: It Doesn’t Grow on Trees: Funding Nonprofits
been specifically established to aid the enterprise in question. Naturally, to do 
this you have to do some considerable searching and persuading — first to 
find and then to move potential donors to the point of giving to your founda-
tion and its cause. Charitable status for both your enterprise and its founda-
tion is absolutely essential.
Governmental entities
Governments, unlike some corporations, don’t normally have one big spe-
cialized unit whose mission is to give money or services to social causes. 
Instead, at least in democratic countries, governments operate programs 
through various related departments or other, often far-flung units that are 
aimed at helping target groups in the population.
Government help may be advisory or monetary or both. The groups tar-
geted are often the poor, handicapped, elderly, undereducated, underem-
ployed, people in need of recreational instruction and facilities, and so on. 
Government or, more precisely, politicians may want public acknowledgment 
of any help they give you. Funding operating expenses usually generates little 
obvious benefit for politicians, whose chances at the polls may be favorably 
influenced by more evident, splashy generosity. Still, most governments do 
have a few programs designed to fund such costs.
If your social enterprise bears on such a target and you want governmental 
advisory or monetary aid, your first step is to track down the relevant gov-
ernmental unit. Unfortunately, doing so isn’t always easy. The Web pages of 
the government in question are a good place to begin. Here are a handful of 
places to start:
  
✓ Grants.gov (www.grants.gov): This Web site offers the closest thing to 
one-stop shopping for U.S. government aid for various activities. Use the 
search function to enter appropriate keywords relating to your field of 
interest.
 
✓ USA.gov (www.usa.gov): This is the overall Web site for the U.S. 
government, with many, many links to its various branches, bureaus, 
departments, programs, and agencies.
 
✓ Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (www.cfda.gov): This site 
provides online access to more than 1,800 programs administered by 
federal agencies and links to many offerings for nonprofit groups seeking 
grant money.
 
✓ Your state or city government: The URLs will vary, but Googling the 
name of your state usually brings up the official state Web site, which 
should link to funding agencies. It may require some digging to find 
them.

158
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
Google can also come to the rescue if you search for your specific criteria 
and include the word grant. The unit in question may also publish a bro-
chure or, more rarely, maintain a phone line for inquiries. We discuss differ-
ent kinds of grants later in this chapter.
 
Set up a free Google Alert to search for the words grant and your area of 
involvement (go to www.google.com/alerts and enter your information). 
Google then e-mails you any time those words pop up in their news crawlers. 
This is a great way to keep abreast of new grant opportunities.
The private sector
The private sector is the business, or corporate, part of society. As a social 
entrepreneur, you may want to approach a corporation to get monetary help 
for your enterprise — say, for an event, project, service, or piece of equip-
ment. You can get funding out of the private sector but only certain kinds, 
and it’s tricky.
Private enterprise is seldom interested in funding your operating expenses, 
which tend to be publicly invisible and, therefore, unlikely to call attention to 
the corporation’s generosity. They will always want some credit.
In order to get a private corporation to donate to your operating costs, you 
should offer the company some placement — such as adding their logo to 
your Web site and to every piece of printed material you distribute. Be pre-
pared to answer questions as to how the corporation will be recognized. You 
may want to prepare a sponsorship package in advance, illustrating how the 
corporate logo will be featured on your Web site and brochures. If the corpo-
ration doesn’t want its logo listed alongside its competitors (called an exclu-
sive sponsorship), ask for a larger donation to guarantee that.
To get corporate monetary help, you have to contact the unit in the corpora-
tion responsible for charitable donations. That’s often easier said than done. 
Most corporations are involved in some kind of community work — the 
most notable examples of which they often promote prominently on their 
Web sites. But it usually takes some digging to find the name of the person 
you should contact. Note that many large corporations have established an 
independent foundation to handle their numerous requests for charity. Most 
external inquiries are sent to that foundation. Home Depot set up its Home 
Depot Foundation to fund affordable housing projects, for example.
Though you should research and pursue grants through its foundational arm, a 
large company may also be willing to provide money to sponsor specific things 
for a social enterprise. These requests are handled through that company’s 

159
 Chapter 9: It Doesn’t Grow on Trees: Funding Nonprofits
marketing department. For example, the marketing department might be will-
ing to sponsor a cocktail reception fundraiser for your organization if their 
logo is prominently displayed on the invitation. Find the name of the VP of 
marketing for that company because he or she will be the appropriate con-
tact for such requests. Ask friends, board members, and volunteers if they 
have connections to a specific company you’re targeting. A personal intro-
duction into a company will be handled much more swiftly than a cold call 
from a stranger.
 
Don’t simply e-mail your request. Follow up with a phone call, asking for a 
time to present your proposal to the company. Again, they’ll direct you to 
their grant-giving foundation arm, but make it clear this request is for a spe-
cific event or purpose.
 
Start on the particular Web page of the corporation’s site that discusses its 
history and general structure (as opposed to the pages devoted primarily 
to selling its goods or services). If there is a site map, explore it for pages 
with titles such as Community Involvement, Benefits to the Community, and 
Corporate Social Responsibility. Some corporate sites also have a Frequently 
Asked Questions (FAQ) section, which may contain an answer to the ques-
tion of how to contact the corporation for charitable support. You may e-mail, 
make a phone call, or write a letter, but the key is to keep at it until you find 
your way in.
 
When you find information on the company’s charitable work, you might be 
able to tell where the corporation’s interests lie. That can be a valuable way of 
seeing which areas the corporation has been attracted to in the past. If your 
new proposal falls outside the corporation’s past involvement, don’t worry — 
they may still be interested. You never know — a contribution might follow.
Gifts
Gifts may be monetary or in kind — such as equipment or building space — 
and may be donated by individuals or corporations. Legal charities are nor-
mally in a position to issue a tax receipt for such donations, which enhances 
the likelihood of receiving them.
 
The better known and the more celebrated your social enterprise, the better 
your chances of receiving individual or corporate gifts, especially monetary 
ones. Donors typically want their largesse to be publicly visible and honored. 
Big contributions to well-known causes tend to have this effect. If you’re just 
starting up, the chances of receiving a large monetary or in-kind gift are rather 
slim. But small gifts such as a hand-me-down computer or a check for, say, 
$100 are certainly possible.

160
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
In-kind contributions
In-kind contributions are made to nonprofit groups and typically take the 
form of physical commodities or physical space or facilities. More rarely, a 
special service might be donated, with pro bono legal and accounting ser-
vices being two common examples. Legal charities may issue tax receipts for 
in-kind contributions as well; that way, the monetary value of the gift can be 
estimated.
Both the United States and Canada have major organizations devoted to 
making in-kind gifts to other charities. Gifts In Kind International (GIK) is the 
seventh-largest charity in the United States, according to the Chronicle of 
Philanthropy. In 2006, GIK generated and placed close to $900 million in in-
kind donations. In Kind Canada (IKC) is a nationwide Canadian charity whose 
mission is to provide smaller charities and nonprofits with access to practi-
cal resources typically only available to larger organizations. Both operate 
with donations received from numerous large and small companies. At the 
time of this writing, GIK distributes donations to more than 150,000 com-
munity charities across the United States and, because it is an international 
organization, to charities in many other parts of the world.
 
To learn more about how organizations like GIK and IKC function and whether 
you might want to contact them to help fund your enterprise, check out their 
Web sites: Gifts in Kind International is at www.giftsinkind.org; In Kind 
Canada is online at www.inkindcanada.ca.
 
Keep in mind that there are some minor legal restrictions on in-kind dona-
tions. For example, the organization can’t resell donated materials for profit.
Writing Successful Grant Proposals
So, how do you get your hands on the grant money we’ve been making you drool 
over? Well, you have to tackle the fine art of grant proposal writing. Writing grant 
proposals is a tremendously involved and exacting undertaking — so much so 
that numerous books have been published on the subject, and entire Web sites 
are devoted to it. For a far deeper look into this process than we have space 
for here, we recommend Beverly A. Browning’s Grant Writing For Dummies, 2nd 
Edition (Wiley).
 
Grants follow the 80/20 rule. Grants will consume 80 percent of your time, 
and provide only about 20 percent of your funding. But that effort is worth it 
because grants are reliable and can be a consistent source of funding for an 
organization.

161
 Chapter 9: It Doesn’t Grow on Trees: Funding Nonprofits
 
In the meantime, to get you started on the right track, here are ten essential 
tips for writing successful proposals:
 
✓ Read a decent sample of previous grant proposals in your area, espe-
cially ones you know have succeeded. Proposals are rarely available 
online to the public. Instead, seek out the nonprofits you know (they 
may be local or national) that have been awarded grants and ask permis-
sion to read their proposals.
 
✓ Be sure to write your proposal so that it harmonizes well with the 
granting agency’s mission and goals. You’ll need to look up the mission 
and goals of the granting agency. You should be able to find both on 
the Web site of the agency you intend to approach. But, if not published 
there, e-mail them.
 
✓ Write your proposal so that it will stand out as much as possible 
against the many competing proposals. This means, in part, stressing 
the uniqueness of your enterprise and its mission.
 
✓ Show your compassion/sympathy for the target of benefits (but don’t 
overdo it), and convey clearly the urgency of your mission. Try to 
make your would-be benefactor feel obligated to help.
 
✓ Show your commitment and your determination to realize your goals. 
Show how much time (days, months, years) has so far been devoted to 
realizing your mission, how many people have been involved, how much 
money has been spent in the process, and so forth. You may also men-
tion some of the more difficult problems you’ve faced and how you man-
aged to solve them.
 
✓ Write simply and as non-technically as possible. The reviewers of your 
proposal may be unfamiliar with all the terminology and issues of your 
particular field and enterprise. And everyone appreciates an easy-to-
understand style of writing.
 
✓ Closely follow all technical requirements set out by the granting 
agency. These guidelines may be as detailed as using the right type size 
and page margins. If sections of the proposal have word limits, never 
exceed them.
 
✓ Keep the proposal as short as possible. In fact, there is often a pre-
scribed page or word limit, which you should religiously respect.
 
✓ Have other people read your proposal before sending it. Someone 
from outside your enterprise should be among the critical readers.
 
✓ Hire a professional grant writer if you have the resources and don’t 
trust yourself or your partners in the enterprise to do the job needed 
to succeed. You can Google grant-writing services to pull up an exten-
sive list. Ask for references and find out how successful the grants have 
been in getting money for the applicants.
 
 If you can find a local grant-writing service, all the better. You can meet 
face-to-face, which may help personalize your relationship with the 

162
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
writer and possibly enable that person to gain a more profound sense of 
your enterprise and its uniqueness. For these reasons, we suggest you 
first try a local service and, if not satisfied, then go online. Whichever 
approach to grant writing you end up selecting, ask around among 
friends, relatives, and acquaintances about their experiences with writers 
and agencies, whether local or online.
Grants take time to apply for and more time to wait for the results. Expect it to 
take a year for the fruits of your labor to result in funds being granted to your 
organization. Due to this timing, start your grant writing early on in the devel-
opment of your enterprise and from then on do it continually and regularly.
 
As laborious as it seems, every single grant proposal should be tailored to the 
specific grant application. Don’t think you’re going to be able to make one master 
proposal and submit it as is to each granting organization. Do your research and 
customize it to the unique requirements of each grant. It’s worth it.

Getting grants in hard times
We can’t ignore the fact that, at the time this 
book is published, a major recession is raging 
worldwide. Moreover, there is plenty of evi-
dence that the nonprofit sector is taking a 
beating. The investment base of many foun-
dations has withered, and many governments 
are putting money into job creation rather than 
into social enterprises relying on volunteers. 
Furthermore, a recent issue of The Economist 
raises the specter that the rich, who have also 
taken a sizeable hit on their wealth, may be 
growing much less charitable.
However, the cloud has a silver lining, and the 
situation can also be worked in your favor. 
True, such dire conditions put a premium on 
superior grantsmanship, because there is now 
much less money to share among ever more 
applicants. And ever more applicants are turn-
ing up because social needs are greater today 
than they are in economically stable times. 
More people than before are greatly stressed 
by their lack of work, loss of a home, decline in 
investments, reduced income, and other woes. 
And many are falling into categories needing 
help that may very well fit your target. For such 
reasons, the ingenuity of social entrepreneurs 
like you to institute change remains in high 
demand. But you may have to rely more than 
usual on volunteers and minimal funding (low 
dues, ongoing sales of product and services, 
money from your own pocket and those of your 
partners), especially at startup.
Angel-investor groups and networks may be 
interested in the social entrepreneurial work 
that you do or want to do. (An angel investor is a 
wealthy person who provides capital from his or 
her own resources to start a business. Some of 
these people organize themselves into groups 
or networks.) Among them are Investors’ Circle 
(www.investorscircle.net) and Good 
Capital (www.goodcap.net). True, they 
receive hundreds of applications annually and 
accept only a handful. But they definitely won’t 
accept yours if you don’t submit it.

Chapter 10
Creating Your Brand
In This Chapter
▶ Selecting a name
▶ Using the Internet to your advantage
▶ Crafting your paper identity
▶ Marketing and imaging your enterprise
A
s a social entrepreneur, you have the fire and determination to con-
vince many people you meet about the urgency of the problem you’re 
trying to solve. The problem is, you can’t be everyplace at once. In order for 
your organization to thrive, you need your message to be heard even when 
you aren’t around.
Getting your message across effectively requires creating a strong organi-
zational identity, or brand, from the start. That brand needs to make your 
mission clear to the people you’re trying to serve, the funders you’re trying 
to persuade, the volunteers you’re trying to recruit, the community you’re 
trying to get support from — from absolutely everyone who potentially influ-
ences your work.
Starting with the name of your enterprise, you have only one chance to make 
a first impression. People will make judgments about you and your mission 
based on surprisingly little information. That’s just the way it goes, and it 
means marketing (the way you define and control how customers perceive 
your goods and services) is critical to your success. You control your image 
as a social entrepreneur largely through marketing.
In this chapter, we show you how to craft your brand expertly, from choos-
ing a name to using the Internet to creating brochures, posters, and business 
cards that represent you well. This is all part of marketing and promoting 
your group’s external image, and it’s a process in which you simply have to 
invest time and money.

164
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
What’s in a Name?
We can answer Shakespeare’s question in two broad ways:
 
✓ If your enterprise is a nonprofit, description is a primary consider-
ation in naming it. Your name must convey to all interested parties 
what your enterprise does and for whom or what, such as animals, 
birds, the homeless, the environment, and so on.
 
✓ If your enterprise is a for-profit entity, sales are the primary consid-
eration. You want to choose a name that promotes the good or service 
you’re selling. An element of description is involved here, too, but 
appeal is the main thing you’re after. In short, a for-profit’s name should 
help attract buyers.
 
Consider an example: What does the name Secular Humanists of the 
Lowcountry tell you about this social enterprise’s mission and goals? The 
Secular Humanists of the Lowcountry, based in Charleston, South Carolina, 
was established in 1994. Its members consider themselves free thinkers on a 
wide range of subjects. Some identify themselves as agnostics; others as athe-
ists; and still others as skeptics, secular humanists, rationalists, or scientific 
naturalists.
The mission of the enterprise — which is classified as nonprofit and edu-
cational — is “to promote the non-theistic, human-centered viewpoint as 
a valid contribution to public discourse and to strive to maintain the First 
Amendment guarantee of separation of state and church.” The organization 
is committed to the use of science, reason, and experience as the best way 
to understand this world and the universe, as well as to conquer social prob-
lems. It scorns any attempt to deprecate the human intellect, as in claims 
that “God knows best.”
When seeing only the name of this enterprise, you might mistake it for a 
club formed strictly for the benefit of its members instead of an external 
target (a set of ideas). In fact, we think that this group might be able to find a 
better name — for example, Society for Secular Humanism or Society for the 
Advancement of Secular Humanism. Compared with its present name, either 
of the other names makes clearer the educational, political, and philosophi-
cal aims of the organization.
 
Here are some points to keep in mind when considering what to call your 
enterprise:
 
✓ Short is good. Your name is best kept short. This rule applies to both 
for-profits and nonprofits.
 
✓ Simple is good, too. Your name should not be ponderous, drawn out, 
too ornate, or filled with jargon or big words. Small words in everyday 
language communicate best.

165
 Chapter 10: Creating Your Brand
 
✓ The name should mean something. Especially if you’re a nonprofit, 
your name must be meaningful to the people you hope to help, as well 
as to any involved and potentially involved third parties, such as founda-
tions, corporations, or investors. Any enterprises named after a person 
or town or identified by a number run the risk that the name won’t be 
meaningful to the people who need to support it.
 
✓ Catchy is good . . . usually. Your name should be attractive, if not down-
right catchy. But be careful: Catchiness can obscure the nature of the 
enterprise. Believe it or not, Throx of San Francisco sells colorful sox in 
packs of three as a cure for a missing sock, and Yelo of New York City 
offers harried urbanites reflexology, massage, and 20- to 40-minute naps 
in sleep pods.
 
 Creating a catchy name can be inappropriate when your enterprise’s mis-
sion is a sobering one, such as eliminating starvation or stopping genital 
mutilation or child slavery. In those cases, direct and simple are best.
 
✓ Exciting is good. Your name should communicate the urgency and com-
passion of the enterprise’s mission.
 
✓ Grandiose isn’t always good. Your name must acknowledge the scope 
of your enterprise. The name Save the Children suggests that the scope 
of the enterprise is universal. But if you plan to work toward saving chil-
dren only in Germany, the name of your enterprise should reflect that.
If you manage to honor all these points in naming your own enterprise, you’ll 
be off to a great start! Reflect on each of these points as you cast about for 
the best name.
Trademark and copyright considerations are also important. A quick search 
of the U.S. Patent and Trademark office Web site (www.uspto.gov) is a great 
place to make sure no one else is using your desired name in a conflicting 
manner.
Finally, don’t forget to decide on the domain name that you’ll use for your 
Web site — and make sure that someone else doesn’t already own that name. 
You want your domain name to bear a decent resemblance to, if not be the 
same as, your organizational name. You have to pay to register the domain 
name you want (multiple domain name registrars offer this service, including, 
for example, Register.com). If the name you want is available, buy it as soon 
as possible to prevent it being claimed by someone else.
 
We cover the legal process of registering your enterprise’s name in Chapter 14. 
Note that the name you choose can be changed if necessary, but if your enter-
prise is incorporated, the new name will have to be filed with the governmental 
agency responsible for registering corporations. Ideally, you’ll get it right the 
first time because changing an enterprise’s name can create confusion in the 
target group and interested third parties.

166
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
 
Some unforeseen change could force you to modify your group’s name — total 
success being one of them. As we discuss in Chapter 7, some social enter-
prises eventually manage to eradicate the problem they set out to conquer. 
Not wanting to cease operations, they then find a new problem to master, 
which may force them to tinker with their name.
Creating an Online Presence
These days it seems like every person and organization on the planet is 
somehow involved with the Internet. Your social enterprise has to be online, 
too. And by online, we mean in the following ways:
 
✓ E-mail: At an absolute minimum, your enterprise should have an e-mail 
address. And even when you first start out, don’t make it your personal 
e-mail address. Not only does using a personal e-mail address look unpro-
fessional, but it leads to intrusion into your personal or familial account. 
Get a free Gmail or Yahoo! Mail account and use it only for your enter-
prise. The address should include the name of your enterprise, a recogniz-
able abbreviation, or maybe a short, memorable, pertinent phrase.
 
✓ Web site: Be honest: When you’re looking for information about an orga-
nization or company, if you can’t find its Web site, do you even take it 
seriously? The public expects you to have a Web site, and you almost 
certainly should have one. We discuss details of social entrepreneurial 
sites in the “Creating content” section, later in this chapter.
 
✓ Blogs and social networks: Efficiently and effectively taking part in 
“Web 2.0” features has become much easier in recent years. Your Web 
site likely should feature a blog or discussion board, for example, that 
discusses subjects that relate to the goals of your enterprise. As Chapter 
11 points out, you can and should also think about joining social net-
working services such as Facebook (www.facebook.com), LinkedIn 
(www.linkedin.com), and Twitter (www.twitter.com).

(Wiley), to find out a whole lot more about using the Internet in your market-
ing efforts.
Reaching the right folks
Ask yourself this question: Who do I want to attract to my enterprise’s Web 
site? The pool of visitors should include the following:
 
✓ The target of benefits: Of course, some targets may have little or no 
access to the Web. If you’re in the for-profit sector, your target is your 
market — the buyers of your good or service.

167
 Chapter 10: Creating Your Brand
 
✓ Interested third parties: These include the media, as well as potential 
funders and investors. For some entrepreneurs, politicians also consti-
tute an interested third party.
 
✓ Potential new members: These are the people who can contribute to 
realizing your mission by participating in your social enterprise.
 
✓ Potential employees: This audience may be especially important for 
enterprises relying on paid staff.
Reaching these four categories of people is the entire purpose of your online 
presence.
Creating content
What should you put on your Web site? at a minimum, the following should 
be there, pretty much in the order in which the following sections appear.
Home page
On your home page, you present a short, crisp introduction to the site that 
encourages visitors to click at least a few of the other pages. You should also 
include an overview of what the site covers. And, of course, the home page is 
where most of your links to the rest of your site are, in one handy place.
 
Your home page is much like a cinema marquee or the cover of a book. It should 
invite potential viewers or readers to venture inside. To see examples of social 
entrepreneurial Web sites that exhibit all or nearly all the features in this sec-
tion, visit the following Web sites and poke around to see how they did it:
 
✓ Keggfarms (www.keggfarms.com) raises and sells chickens in India.
 
✓ IONA Senior Services (www.iona.org) aids seniors.

Mission and vision statements
You should put your mission and vision statements on their own separate 
page of your Web site. You may also put your organizational goals, or a 
sample of them, on this page.

168
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
 
You may be tempted to put your mission and vision statements on your home 
page, but if you do, you may end up cluttering it excessively. They’re better off 
on their own separate page.
For more on writing a mission statement and vision statement, turn to 
Chapter 7.
Your products or services
For-profit enterprises should at least promote the goods and services they’re 
selling, including prices and information on how and where to purchase 
them. You should also seriously consider selling directly on your site.
 
If you’re interested in really getting into selling on the Web, check out Web 
Stores Do-It-Yourself For Dummies, by Joel Elad, and Starting an Online Business 
For Dummies, 5th Edition, by Greg Holden (both published by Wiley).
History
Your Web visitors may be curious about how your enterprise came to be and 
how it reached its present stage of development. But avoid excessive detail 
and length in this portrayal — the typical visitor isn’t that fascinated with 
your history.
Founder
If your enterprise has existed for many years, and its initial entrepreneur and 
founder (is that you?) has become well known, a separate biographical page 
on this person is usually of interest.
News and events
This page shows the level and scope of your enterprise’s activity. It may 
contain a list of pertinent conferences, major successes related to mission, 
recent funding arrangements, noteworthy changes in leadership, new publi-
cations by the enterprise or its members, and so on.
You may decide to make your news and events page a blog instead, which 
will allow readers to subscribe to an RSS feed in a feed reader. If you want 
to find out more about blogs, check out Blogging For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
(Wiley).
Links
On this page, you link to other Web sites that are related to your mission. 
And to help spread the word about your enterprise, encourage those other 
sites to reciprocate with a link to your own. There’s no guarantee they will, 
but it doesn’t hurt to ask.

169
 Chapter 10: Creating Your Brand
Contacts
This is where you list all the fax, e-mail, snail-mail, and telephone contacts for 
your enterprise. From the standpoint of the people in your enterprise, e-mail 
contact is the most vital, flexible, and least obtrusive of these four. But if your 
enterprise has an office and someone regularly on hand to deal with faxes, 
snail mail, and telephone calls, then also listing the other three enhances effi-
ciency of communication with third parties.
Donations
One common and surprising mistake many organizations make is forgetting 
to include a page that asks for donations. So, include a Donate page! You can 
set up a PayPal account to receive the donations and include an address for 
donors to send checks. If you’re ambitious, you can even set up an e-com-
merce section and accept credit and debit card donations.
Developing an appropriate appearance
Your home page should lure visitors, but the allure should be appropriate. 
Web sites of nonprofit social enterprises don’t need the commercial flash 
that at least some for-profits may find necessary.
For-profits may require entertaining mechanisms on their sites (such as 
catchy music, short videos, and professional, cutting-edge graphic design) 
that could be regarded as poor taste for many nonprofits. Imagine such flash-
iness on the home page of a social enterprise whose mission is to ban cruelty 
to animals or end political corruption. For those enterprises, education — 
not entertainment — is a top priority.
 
You may be creative, but when it comes to marketing your enterprise online 
you probably shouldn’t do it all yourself. Matters of online taste, aesthetics, 
and design should not be left to amateurs. Plenty of professional services are 
available on the Internet and in the Yellow Pages that can help you set up your 
enterprise’s Web site, often quite reasonably.
 
If you’re a bit of a Web geek, though, go for it. You can buy Web page templates 
at sites such as www.buytemplates.net and www.metamorphozis.com.
Focusing on functionality
Your Web site won’t be successful if it isn’t functional — in other words, if 
visitors can’t get the information they need there. Functionality is complex 
and beyond the scope of this book — we’ll leave it to your professional Web 
site designer, should you hire one, to ensure it.

170
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
Because Web sites of for-profit enterprises tend to be more elaborate than 
the Web sites of nonprofits, for-profit enterprises have a greater interest in 
establishing decent functionality. But very broadly you want two kinds of 
functionality, whether you’re a nonprofit or a for-profit enterprise: content 
management and reporting.
Content management
Through content management, you can manage the content of your Web site 
without having to acquire the special skills and knowledge of design and 
programming. The key here is to develop a simple interface (the product of a 
well-developed content-management system), which allows you to maintain 
and update the structure, navigation, and content of all the pages comprising 
your Web site.
Reporting
Reporting is an extremely important part of your enterprise’s Web site. 
Reporting provides vital information about the many features of your site 
and how well they’re working. In other words, your well-functioning Web site 
should automatically and routinely provide you with information about every 
aspect of its performance, including all sorts of useful data about who is visit-
ing your site and what they’re doing on it. Reporting tells you what is working 
and what could be working better.
Seeking commercial support 
and advertising
On a Web site, commercial support is usually accomplished through selling 
advertising on the site. You can then use the proceeds from those advertise-
ments as a source of revenue for your enterprise.
You have three options for pursuing external commercial support:
 
✓ Advertising directly on your site
 
✓ Acknowledgment on your site
 
✓ Advertising on other Web sites
The first two options bring in revenue directly to your enterprise through 
fees paid by others (usually for-profits and regular businesses) whose goods 
or services you advertise or who supply goods or services to your group. 
The third option should produce revenue indirectly after you spend the 
money on advertising. You hope for an increase in visits to your site and a 
corresponding increase in sales of your own goods or services.
We cover each of these options in greater detail in the following sections.

171
 Chapter 10: Creating Your Brand
Advertising directly on your site
This includes placing ads in sidebars, interstitials (separate Web pages that 
display just before an expected content page appears), and pop-ups.
The main bone of contention here — of concern primarily for nonprofit social 
entrepreneurs — is whether trying to make money by such commercial 
means is a good idea. Would including direct advertising on your site deflect 
attention from the messages you’re trying to convey? Would such advertising 
reduce the sense of urgency and seriousness of your enterprise’s mission? Is 
that mission too important, too dignified, to be keep company with anything 
commercial? Or should you accept the consequences of advertising, justify-
ing it as a necessary evil that comes with bringing in badly needed money to 
run the enterprise and succeed at your mission? We can’t answer this ques-
tion for you, but you should certainly think about it.
There is also the touchy matter of your appearing to endorse the goods and 
services advertised. That could be risky, depending on the good or service 
being advertised. For example, if your social enterprise is devoted to promot-
ing improved nutrition for children, and you inadvertently accept advertising 
from a company that produces an energy drink that causes dangerous eleva-
tions in heart rate, you’re sending a mixed message to your visitors. An enter-
prise that animal lovers have established to save the grizzly bears of the Rocky 
Mountains should definitely avoid advertisements aimed at promoting the sale 
of hunting guns and ammunition — even if bear hunters are also interested in 
such a project (because its success should give them more grizzlies to hunt).
Acknowledgment on your site
This is public acknowledgment on your site of commercial sources of ser-
vices and equipment purchased by your enterprise.
Acknowledgment, if reasonably subtle, probably avoids most of the conse-
quences associated with direct advertising. But then, because of low vis-
ibility, the commercial enterprise you’re acknowledging probably receives 
a lower return on its money compared with direct advertising, such as a 
pop-up or interstitial. Because of this possibility, that commercial enterprise 
will probably offer a smaller fee to your social enterprise for acknowledging it 
than it would if you accepted its advertising.
Put simply, you probably won’t make as much money on an acknowledgment 
as you would on an ad.
Advertising on other Web sites
Here you purchase ads on other sites in order to promote your enterprise.
Buying advertising space on another Web site is a calculated chance at suc-
ceeding in drawing more hits on your own site. This is spending money to 
make money, and you can think of it as a sort of investment.

172
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
Getting Your Identity on Paper
Your paper identity is created mainly in the form of brochures, flyers, posters, 
banners, and business cards. For all the popularity and utility of the Internet, 
paper doesn’t appear to be going away. Your paper marketing efforts offer 
certain advantages: They’re portable, they don’t require electricity, and they 
can be larger and more attractive than a computer screen. Perhaps paper’s 
greatest advantage is that it’s easy to distribute on the spot — such as at a 
rally, meeting, conference, spontaneous gathering, or even along a pedestrian 
thoroughfare.
 
Use the same designer for all your paper marketing, if possible. It provides 
an overall consistent look, and it makes it easy to make changes to all your 
marketing at one time. You may also get a discount on design and printing ser-
vices if you become a loyal customer at one place.
Brochures
Brochures may be slick pamphlets with multiple pages or a single (usually 
folded) page printed on both sides. Compared with flyers, brochures com-
monly take more time and effort to produce, pack more information, and 
have a more polished look about them. But for those reasons, they’re also 
not as flexible for addressing immediate events and developments. Brochures 
are more permanent. Brochures are usually more expensive to produce than 
flyers, although modern computer technology has narrowed this gap.
Flyers
You can think of flyers as cheap brochures. You can use them wherever 
brochures are appropriate, but if you have a choice, the brochure better rep-
resents your enterprise. Still, there are occasions when the flyer is the more 
effective tool. One is mass distribution — for example, as a handout to people 
exiting a concert or sporting event; giving out brochures in this number may 
be too expensive. Another is when you want to take immediate advantage of 
recent events. Maybe your enterprise against environmental pollution wants 
to show how it relates to an oil spill that has just occurred. Your strategy 
would be to distribute flyers showing this relationship.
Posters and banners
As with brochures, making attractive, informative, inspiring posters and ban-
ners takes time, effort, and often a good bit of money. For posters and ban-
ners, use the services of a professional designer and printer.

173
 Chapter 10: Creating Your Brand
Even more than most brochures, posters and banners are destined to have 
a long life. Some are even so attractive and artistic that they become collec-
tors’ items. But they’re the least versatile of the various forms of paper iden-
tity (or “fabric identity,” in the case of some banners). By and large, they’re 
limited to being hung on walls and then, if ideally displayed, only where there 
is proper space and lighting and the social environment is compatible with 
the message you’re trying to disseminate. Plus, both posters and banners are 
susceptible to being damaged and soiled, which tends to undermine the posi-
tive publicity you’re looking for. Finally, they’re often subject to theft, which 
increases your cost.
Business cards
Your enterprise’s business card is the most portable of the five kinds of 
paper identity and conveys the least amount of information. Most com-
monly it serves to associate a member of the enterprise with the enterprise 
itself, doing so with a personal name linked to the enterprise’s name, street 
address, e-mail address, and Web address.
 
With the space on the front of the card largely consumed by that information 
(especially if you also place a logo there), consider printing a short version of 
your mission statement on the back.
Business cards sometimes end up where the other four identity media fail to, 
such as on the dressers and kitchen tables of the people you give them to. In 
general, a business card is especially useful in interpersonal relations, includ-
ing parties, meetings, informal gatherings at conventions, and spontaneous 
conversational encounters with people who show an interest in your mission. 
Good times to give out your card are on airplanes, in restaurants, and while 
waiting in lines.
Letterhead stationery
Letterhead stationery should have, at minimum, your enterprise’s name, 
street address, telephone number, e-mail address, and Web address. Letters 
may go to people and organizations that would otherwise have little oppor-
tunity to contact your enterprise on the Internet or by means of your other 
paper identifiers. Examples may include city officials, members of the clergy, 
school administrators, local businesses and organizations, and government 
offices. The more attractive your letterhead, the better it will serve your 
enterprise as one of its paper ambassadors. For this reason, you may want to 
hire a professional designer to create this kind of paper identity.

174
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
 
It doesn’t hurt to ask the printer to consider making an in-kind donation of ser-
vices in exchange for acknowledgment on your organization’s Web site. The 
printer may not be able to provide the printing for free, but it should be able 
to provide it at cost or at a discount.
Marketing the Old-Fashioned Way
Traditional marketing methods are the tried-and-true, old-school tools that 
can still be an important part of promoting your enterprise. Typical ones 
used by social entrepreneurs include logos, networking, slogans, and apparel.
Logos
An attractive, versatile logo is a wonderful marketing tool. By versatile we 
mean a logo that can be easily placed on the various forms of paper identity, 
as well as online.
You have to be able to reduce or enlarge the logo without losing its visual 
impact. It should be colorful, though tastefully so. A garish logo can easily 
overwhelm the rest of the content on your business card, poster, letterhead, 
and so on. Here, too, we recommend that you seek expert advice, especially 
because the most effective logos visually communicate both mission and 
goals. The best logos summarize visually, though abstractly, what a social 
enterprise is all about. Good logos can power your marketing.
 
Services that design logos are available on the Internet and in your city’s 
Yellow Pages. Logoworks.com offers a commercial online service for design-
ing logos, business cards, stationery, brochures, and a variety of promotional 
products (including apparel, discussed later in this section). The site also 
features online galleries containing numerous specimens of these different 
kinds of paper identity. To register your logo, look in the Yellow Pages for 
“Trademark Agents — Registered.”
 
Don’t copy someone else’s logo. Many logos (among some other kinds of 
paper identity and marketing devices) are trademarked, which means some 
person or group owns them. To use such a logo without its owner’s written 
permission could have unpleasant legal repercussions. (Later in this section, 
we discuss finding professional help for copyrighting and trademarking paper 
and marketing identities.)
In a pinch, and if you have no money, the Web site www.vistaprint.com 
offers free logo design. You won’t find a unique or great one here, but you 
will possibly find one that is attractive.

175
 Chapter 10: Creating Your Brand
Networking
We devote an entire chapter to networking (Chapter 11), but we want to men-
tion it here, because it relates to marketing your social enterprise. As you 
and members of your enterprise circulate in your daily rounds, you do so, in 
part, as links in various social networks of friends, business associates, and 
acquaintances. Sometimes you’ll make contacts within a network and you’ll 
have the chance to talk, perhaps only briefly, about your enterprise and its 
work. If you’re given that chance, do so, always. You may, in these encoun-
ters, even hand a flyer or brochure to other people present, but usually you 
spread information on your enterprise simply by talking about it.
 
Here you want to be concise. So consider the elevator pitch. Create a 
30-second statement that crisply explains your organization’s mission and 
goals. Know how to effectively explain your enterprise to someone in an eleva-
tor in under 30 seconds.
Slogans
Slogans, mottos, taglines, punch lines, catchphrases — these are all snappy 
verbal utterances that ring well in the ear and can simultaneously communi-
cate something of the essence of your enterprise. A good slogan is worth its 
weight in gold.
 
Earlier in the chapter, we list four impressive social entrepreneur Web sites. 
Two of them have pretty good slogans. IONA Senior Services goes by the 
slogan of “Experts on Aging.” That makes it sound reliable and informed — 
the slogan provokes confidence when you hear it. LetITHelp has a somewhat 
longer slogan: “Providing financial and spiritual transformation to Mindanao’s 
youth.” Not too grandiose — it acknowledges the local focus. The Keggfarms 
slogan — “Engineering rural prosperity” — is more vague, but it has the merit 
of being accurate, short, and catchy.
 
Your slogan should be short, clear, and contain wording that everyone can 
understand.
You and your collaborators in the enterprise will probably enjoy many lively 
sessions trying to think up an acceptable slogan. If you hit a wall, you may 
want turn to a professional for assistance — such as the online service www.
kristofcreative.com (click Services and then Branding). This company 
also offers service in the design of logos, stationery, posters, T-shirts, and 
other marketing and identity tools.

176
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
 
Slogans, like logos, are very likely to be protected, in this instance copy-
righted, as you’ll probably want yours to be. To obtain copyright protection 
for a slogan, look in the Yellow Pages for services that design and copyright 
logos as well as on the Internet.
Apparel
As with the other forms of marketing and paper identity, custom-designed 
apparel — T-shirts, caps, sweatshirts, and so on — wind up being viewed in 
places where other promotional items fail to reach. Wear your T-shirt with 
your enterprise’s name and logo on it to the supermarket, the dry clean-
ers, the bookstore, to lunch, and while playing golf or doing other activities 
with friends. Your friends may know about your enterprise, but how many 
other people who saw your shirt that day knew about it? Obviously, this is 
another fruitful way to market your social enterprise. You may even be able 
to sell your apparel and multiply this effect. You can find services for custom-
designing apparel in the Yellow Pages under such headings as “Apparel,” 
“Caps,” and “T-Shirts.” Or go online to CafePress (www.cafepress.com) for 
such products.
Public Relations: Imaging 
Your Enterprise
In the business world, you hear a lot of talk about corporate image, which 
refers to how third parties perceive a particular for-profit enterprise. 
Concern about image is a matter of marketing, promotion, and public rela-
tions. A favorable image is believed to increase sales of goods and services. 
After all, people are more inclined to buy a product from a company they 
like, right? Promoting a product or service is easier when the company sell-
ing it is respected — or at least not particularly disrespected. A good corpo-
rate image also helps ease public relations problems with third parties, such 
as politicians, consumer groups, regulatory agencies, and environmental 
activists.
You may think that corporate image applies mostly to for-profit social enter-
prises because their nonprofit counterparts often have nothing to sell and 
profit from. But the picture is more complicated than this. Some nonprof-
its do have goods or services for sale, even if the money made this way is 
returned to the operating budget of the enterprise. And whether they sell 
something or not, nonprofit enterprises must still tend to their organizational 
image for the same reasons.
Nonprofit social enterprises may not be marketing products, but they are 
marketing their missions and their capacity to make a difference and solve a 

177
 Chapter 10: Creating Your Brand
social problem. Having a favorable image helps a great deal in your marketing 
effort. Imagine what might happen to your image — and therefore to market-
ing efforts — if your enterprise were publicly exposed for internal embezzle-
ment, or if a bitter power struggle among its leaders spilled out into the 
media? That most definitely wouldn’t help you sell or promote your mission.
 
Unfavorable events and problems with a social enterprise demand skillful han-
dling. They demand extraordinary efforts in public relations. Consider these 
two examples:
 
✓ In May 1995, The New York Times reported a case of embezzlement 
by an erstwhile treasurer of the Episcopal Church to the tune of $2.2 
million. The money, taken over a period of five years, belonged to the 
church. The treasurer spent it on trips, clothing, jewelry, real estate, 
and limousine services. The fact that no one discovered the embezzle-
ment for so long was traced by the bishop of the church to the “absolute 
control” the embezzler had over auditing at church headquarters. This 
condition prevented other people from scrutinizing the books.
 
✓ In August 2007, The Chronicle of Philanthropy reported on fraudulent 
activities in the United Way of East Lansing, Michigan. The report 
observed that, had this charity divvied up the responsibilities of its 
department of finance, the culprit, a former vice president, might have 
been apprehended earlier. As it was, she alone controlled this unit of 
this chapter of United Way. She ran its internal accounting system, 
through which pledges were recorded, as well as a computer program 
that registers the donations given to the group. She also routinely bal-
anced the checking account, though she lacked the authority to write 
any checks.
In both instances, the two charities involved seem to have pulled through 
their moral ordeals without long-term negative consequences. But those 
ordeals did discourage some donations in the short run.
Even if all is going well, public relations is still an essential process for effec-
tively imaging nonprofit enterprises. Your marketing is, in effect, a part of 
your public relations portfolio. The same may be said for demonstrating cor-
porate social responsibility. Public relations usually involve working through 
third parties, normally the media. The media sector of the third-party group 
is so important that we devote a chapter to it (Chapter 12).
Beyond the media, keep in mind that public relations may need special atten-
tion with reference to labor unions. (For coverage of enterprises that are 
unionized or contemplating unionization, see Chapter 18.) Another group 
meriting delicate handling is governmental agencies and the elected politi-
cians who ultimately are responsible for them. And don’t forget your rela-
tions with other kindred social enterprises and nonprofit groups. They can 
be important allies in helping you realize your mission but will act that way 
only if they respect your group.

178
Part II: Establishing Your Organization 
 
Should you seek professional help for imaging your enterprise? You can prob-
ably wait until trouble strikes, or if your image in third-party circles is some-
how tarnished. Professional services of this sort are costly, and many 
nonprofit social enterprises have far too little money for their missions, let 
alone for propping up their images professionally. Just keep in mind the ideas 
in this section and market, promote, and foster public relations where you can 
in the course of routinely pursuing your mission. That should suffice in normal 
circumstances.
If the need does arise for professional help, waste no time in seeking it. The 
Yellow Pages typically contain a fairly long list of public relations services 
and agencies — as does the good old Internet (search on “public relations 
services”).

In this part . . .
W
hen you have your basic plan going, if you’re like 
most entrepreneurs, your job becomes improve-
ment, expansion, and growth — as long as those things 
don’t come at the expense of the folks you’re trying to 
help.
Chapter 11, on networking, acknowledges that nobody 
works in a vacuum — and that goes double for social 
entrepreneurs. Chapter 12 is chock-full of advice on work-
ing with the media to achieve your goals. In Chapter 13, 
we look at that monster called bureaucracy and see that it 
can be beneficial if kept in check. And if you want to really 
go for it and formally organize as a corporation, Chapter 
14 is your ticket to finding out your options.

t’s not what you know but who you know that makes the difference. That 
old cliché is just as true in the field of social entrepreneurship as it is in 
the rest of the world.
As we mention in Chapter 2, humans as a species are intelligent, sure, but 
the real wealth in our intelligence comes from its social and cultural aspects. 
The fact that we can share our intelligence, collaborate, and see that wealth 
multiply many times has got to be one of the greatest joys and enchantments 
of the human experience. That’s the reason why “who you know” makes the 
difference. And that’s also where social networking comes into play.
What is social networking? A social network is a group of people held together 
by something they have in common. Social networks are all around — most 
of us are embedded in a whole web of them. Family life, work, church, school, 
volunteer work — even chatting with neighbors, shopping, group e-mailing, 
you name it. Wherever you’re having a conversation with someone in one of 
your social networks, you’re doing a basic kind of social networking.
Social networks are powerful tools in social entrepreneurship, and now is the 
perfect time to harness the power of the latest form of social networking — 
online sites such as Facebook and Twitter, which are called social media. You 
need to mine all your social networks to your advantage. In some ways, your 

182
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
success as a social entrepreneur will hinge on your ability to tap into conver-
sations and social networks of one kind or another. In this chapter, we look 
at how you can develop your social networks through online social media as 
well as face-to-face interactions.
Social Networking and Social Media
Unless you’ve been held captive by aliens for the past half decade, you’ve 
probably at least heard about, if not experienced, Web 2.0, the type of online 
networking and collaboration also known as social media. The first wave of 
applications of the World Wide Web (called Web 1.0) was mostly about just 
putting information “out there” — getting corporate, educational, govern-
ment, entertainment, and seemingly every other kind of information online 
and distributed as widely and as quickly as possible.
Web 2.0 is about making it possible for people to do stuff with what they 
encounter online, which includes, at a basic level, the ability in engage in 
group conversations. More and more such interaction takes place in real 
time, boasting an immediacy that’s very close to what you find in a face-to-
face conversation. Web 2.0 represents a phenomenal advance in communica-
tion technology, and just about everyone is embracing it.
Signing up with the most 
popular social media sites
Social media today includes the following online tools (although this list does 
not by any means exhaust the possibilities of the fast-growing world of social 
media):
 
✓ Blogs: Online journals, kept by individuals or groups, which give readers 
the means with which to respond, often resulting in lively conversations
 
✓ Discussion boards: Sites designed to foster conversations about specific 
topics, often connected to products or services
 
✓ Social bookmarking services: Places to share and discuss favorite links 
and other online resources, often focused on specific topics
 
✓ Facebook (www.facebook.com): A vastly popular social networking 
site revolving around each participant’s social network (called friends) 
and enabling everyone to share their thoughts and observations, along 
with photos, videos, links, and other content

183
 Chapter 11: Mixing It Up: Using Social Networking and Social Media
 
✓ Flickr (www.flickr.com): A public space to share photos and keep in 
touch with those who are interested in them
 
✓ LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com): A mostly business-oriented networking 
site, in which you expand your social network to include your contacts, 
plus their contacts, and their contacts. . . .
 
✓ Meetup (www.meetup.com): A network of more than 5 million members 
in 11,500 cities, who meet in the real world because of their shared inter-
est or circumstance (for example, new moms, environmental activists, 
or book lovers)
 
✓ MySpace (www.myspace.com): Similar to Facebook, though somewhat 
more geared to groups (bands use it to share their music) and featuring 
a younger user profile
 
✓ Skype (www.skype.com): A free communication platform that hosts 
telephone-like abilities, chat, and live video feeds
 
✓ Twitter (www.twitter.com): A “microblogging” service, in which users 
write short (140-character) messages, can “follow” anyone on Twitter, 
and search for topics being discussed
 
✓ Wikis: User-generated, collaborative knowledge centers where people 
share and discuss what they know about a topic (www.wikipedia.org 
being the biggest and most famous)
 
✓ YouTube (www.youtube.com): A huge online video-sharing site, where 
users post videos and viewers respond with comments — and some-
times videos of their own
We recommend you get started by visiting each of the sites listed in the pre-
ceding section and signing up. Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn, Twitter, Skype, 
and YouTube all feature easy-to-use interfaces that are self-explanatory and 
that have detailed help links if you have trouble. You’ll likely have hours of 
fun setting up your accounts and watching as your social networks in each 
medium begin to grow. That’s the easy part, actually.
 
We also recommend signing up for Google Alerts. All you need is a Google 
account (if you don’t have one go to www.google.com/accounts/
NewAccount). After you’ve got your Google account, go to the alerts sign-up 
page (www.google.com/alerts) and enter some keywords you’re inter-
ested in monitoring. From then on, every time your keywords make a new 
appearance on the Web, you’ll be notified by receiving a link through e-mail, 
along with enough information to see whether that’s something you’d like to 
have a further look at. We recommend choosing the once-a-day notification 
option — that way, all your results are compiled together, and you just get 
one message a day (as opposed to being peppered with e-mails throughout 
the day).

184
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
Many other news services (BBC, CNN, The New York Times), Web sites, and 
blogs will alert you about new material as well if you sign up with them. Some 
do this through what are called Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds, indi-
cated by an orange RSS icon usually located at the top of the organization’s 
home page. You can certainly sign up with as many of these as you want, 
though we recommend signing up with Google Alerts at the very least.
The four functions of social media 
for the social entrepreneur
As a social entrepreneur, using and engaging with social media boils down to 
a four-function approach:
 
✓ Research: Investigating issues and developments via social bookmark-
ing, a method for Internet users to share, organize, search, and manage 
bookmarks of Web resources
 
✓ Integration: Becoming directly involved in various social networking 
outlets
 
✓ Production: Creating and distributing original content on blogs and 
wikis
 
✓ Notification: Staying up-to-date on developments via e-mail alerts, RSS 
feeds, and microblogs such as Twitter
The research function is important in gathering the information your social 
enterprise and like-minded people in your social network. Social bookmark-
ing sites are a key part of this function, and we return to that subject later in 
this chapter. We cover the integration function in the next section.
The production function involves creating and disseminating various interac-
tive knowledge pieces. Over time, production can include the development of 
a collection of learning that you and your collaborators have pulled together. 
You can post this information and supporting opinion or commentary to 
blogs and/or wikis (which may be the perfect social media expressions of the 
production function). Producing collaborative content is the natural expres-
sion of the process begun by the research function and sustained by the 
integration function. It is also the legacy of that whole process, what is left 
behind for others, which may be relevant enough to fuel more bookmarking 
research by your community or someone else at some point.
The process of collaborative learning through social media is made conve-
nient through the notification function. Here, you and your collaborators can 
update each other — and the public or other groups if you want — about 

185
 Chapter 11: Mixing It Up: Using Social Networking and Social Media
your activities in adding to the mutual learning process in nice, short, easy-
to-receive-and-digest bursts of communication. E-mail is still the old standby 
for being notified (and really struts its stuff with e-mail lists). RSS feeds and 
micro-blogging (with Twitter as the archetypal example) are also becoming 
incredibly valuable in keeping everyone updated.
If social media began as a way of creating new and ever more fanciful ways 
of conversing online, many services are now edging more toward providing 
a technological platform that can support real collaborative work on many 
levels.
 
The startup Power Text Solutions (http://iresearch-reporter.com) 
provides a cluster of Web-based individual research tools, such as informa-
tion categorization and summarization. Its goal is to roll out an unprecedented 
platform supporting collaborative Web research.
 
Google Wave (http://wave.google.com) — as of this writing, the “next big 
thing” in social media — is intended to allow people from all over the globe 
to interact, collaborate, and exchange almost any type of information in real 
time.
 
Perhaps no one has signaled the advent of the trend toward flexing the mus-
cles of social media better than President Barack Obama. His 2008 presidential 
campaign was a pioneering model in “government 2.0,” where citizens collab-
oratively learned and contributed to the campaign decision-making process.
Following Followers on Twitter
You may well ask: “Being all modern and fancy with social media is well and 
good, but how do I move past keeping in touch to making things happen for 
my social enterprise?”
The most basic first step is to find others who share your concerns. People 
you should be collaboratively learning with are out there. How do you find 
those folks?
 
Probably the easiest, fastest, and most productive way to get started in col-
laborative learning via social media is through Twitter (www.twitter.com). 
If you’re new to social media, Twitter will get you up and running, meeting and 
talking with like-minded folks, in very short order. Even if you’re a veteran to 
social media but haven’t really given Twitter a sustained shot, we urge you to 
do so for reasons that will soon become clear.

186
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
When you’re on Twitter (the signup is simple from the home page) you can 
begin finding people who should be in your social network. To start finding 
others who share your interests, we recommend doing a keyword search 
at http://search.twitter.com in the box at the top of the page. Use 
combinations of words that are of interest to your organization (for example, 
search for sustainable development, community hospitals, or soup kitchen 
Detroit).
 
You should get at least a page full of relevant tweets (what the mini-blog posts 
on Twitter are called). Take a good look at the results, focusing on those that 
boldface the terms you searched for in ways that are meaningful for you. Of 
the good hits, look to see if there is a hashtag embedded in those tweets. 
(If you’re not up on Twitter hashtags, have a look at the nearby “Twitter 
hashtags” sidebar.)
 
When you’ve found hashtags you can relate to, make a note of them for later 
use because you can easily forget what they mean. For example, you naturally 
might want to try a Twitter search for social entrepreneur. Pretty quickly 
you’ll notice that the hashtag #socent often appears. Clicking the #socent 
hyperlink confirms that this particular hashtag is one that is used, appropri-
ately, to refer to topics of interest to social entrepreneurs.
Why all the emphasis on Twitter and Google Alerts and RSS? We’re trying to 
get you acquainted with online communities of your choice so that you can 
begin to collaborate on learning with others who share the concerns of your 
social enterprise. You’ll very likely find individuals and communities through 
Twitter hashtags and Google Alert links.
Twitter hashtags
A hashtag is a small alphanumeric string pre-
ceded by the number sign (#). A hashtag serves 
as a topic identifier for finding and tracking 
tweets on Twitter. People looking for tweets on 
the 2009 Copenhagen United Nations Climate 
Change Conference, for example, would search 
for #Copenhagen and find all sorts of tweets 
on the summit. Note that a long hashtag like 
#Copenhagen eats up some of the precious 
140-character limit on Twitter. A better hashtag 
might be something like #cop15. And, in fact, 
that was the hashtag for that conference (the 
conference being the 15th one on climate 
change). The problem, though, is that unless 
you were in the know and realized that “cop15” 
was the official moniker of the Copenhagen 
conference, you might not see the significance 
of the hashtag. You can remedy that problem by 
clicking the hyperlink and checking the context 
in which the hashtag is being used.
The generation and use of hashtags is not offi-
cially supported by Twitter — no one is really 
keeping track of their use. Instead, hashtags 
are a user convention. It may require a bit of 
detective work to figure out what a particular 
hashtag means to the folks using it.

187
 Chapter 11: Mixing It Up: Using Social Networking and Social Media
Becoming a valued tweeter
After your inbox is filling up with Google Alerts, if you see something of 
urgent interest to you and others who are like-minded, why not open up your 
Twitter account and tweet about the alert? Say a few (a very few) words to 
grab reader attention and then invite them to click your link to read more.
 
That 140-character tweet limit can be a killer. Check out http://140it.
com if you need help shortening your prose. And what about that long Web 
address you copied from your Google Alert e-mail — the one that’s 800 char-
acters long? Copy that humungous monster, take it to http://tinyurl.
com, http://bit.ly, or http://is.gd and paste it into the little boxes 
provided. Then click the conversion button, and presto! You’ve got a teeny-
tiny Web address that you can now paste into your tweet.
Don’t forget to include those hashtags you made a note of before. Squeeze as 
many as you can into your tweet; with each one, your tweet will be picked up 
by more members of the communities that understand and are looking for 
the hashtag topics of interest.
If you tweet in the way we’ve just described, regularly and fervently, some-
thing really important will start to happen: You’ll be followed. Unlike being 
stalked, being followed is potentially a very good thing. It means someone 
has chosen to receive all your tweets automatically. Sometimes a single tweet 
can generate a handful to a dozen or more followers. Before you know it, 
you’ll have dozens, or even hundreds, of followers.
Turning followers into collaborators
Followers are the key to using Twitter for social networking. You’ll be sent an 
e-mail notification every time someone chooses to follow you, which includes 
a hyperlink to that person’s profile. Click that link — this is the moment 
you’ve been waiting for! Browse your follower’s tweets, and if you like what 
you see, follow them in return. The two of you are now part of the same 
social network. Voilá!
Your collaborative learning can even now take a more personal turn because 
when people follow each other they can send direct messages to each other 
(small private messages). After getting to know each other a little, the time 
will come for one of you to direct message (or DM) the other to say hello and 
express admiration and appreciation for the other’s tweets. See how recep-
tive they are to your friendly introduction. If there seems to be an open door 
to further communication, then you may be ready to take the next step.

188
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
 
What might a next step be? Think of a problem or issue about which you both 
are mutually interested in learning more and suggest swapping information on 
that topic. If you can do this with two or three or more others, you’ll have the 
basis for a Twitter group. That just means that if everyone’s agreeable, you can 
assign yourselves a unique hashtag of some sort and then designate a time to 
chat together. Pick a mutually acceptable time and log in to http://tweet 
chat.com or http://tweetgrid.com. Enter the hashtag you’ve assigned 
yourselves, and start tweeting back and forth to each other in real time. This 
is all very cool, of course — but also potentially very valuable to your enter-
prise. You never know who you’ll meet or what they can offer you.

Laura Fitton, Michael Gruen, and Leslie Poston; and Twitter Marketing For 
Dummies, by Kyle Lacy (both published by Wiley).
Networking, Online and Off
As you are increasingly followed on Twitter, and participate in and perhaps 
even coordinate Twitter groups (not to mention friended on Facebook, linked 
on LinkedIn, and so forth), you might wonder what’s behind your growing 
popularity. Well, it’s nothing but a whole lotta whuffie. No, really.
Whuffie is sort of an arcane buzzword meaning social capital or reputation 
(good or bad) within or specific to a particular online community. Positive 
whuffie refers to how helpful and therefore esteemed you’re perceived to be 
by that community. Your whuffie is one of the measures of how much people 
take you seriously, and you should guard and protect it.
On the photo-sharing site Flickr, for example, your whuffie might go up with 
the number of photos you post, the tags you place on photos, the helpful 
comments you make about other people’s photos, the number of useful gal-
leries you create, and so on. With Twitter, if you follow the suggestions we 
make in this chapter, you should be on your way to increasing your whuffie 
dramatically. People who follow you, and especially people in your Twitter 
group, will come to see you as helpful and valuable to their own learning and 
progress. Other Twitterers, looking on from outside who may have searched 
for the topics you’ve hashtagged in your own tweets, will feel more comfort-
able following you and then joining in. The more the merrier, right?
Balancing your physical and digital lives
You do need to be careful about certain tendencies inherent in online social 
networking. We dropped in recently on a young psychologist and social 
entrepreneur we know. As we entered her office, she turned away from her 
computer screen and said, “I don’t know why I do this to myself.” She 

189
 Chapter 11: Mixing It Up: Using Social Networking and Social Media
gathered up a whole mess of stickies that were adorning her monitor and 
stuck them all to her ten fingers, with sometimes more than one to a digit. 
“These are all the online favors I’ve committed to doing for people just this 
morning. What am I going to do?” Then she paused and said, “I just hope it’s 
good for my whuffie.”
 
Collaborative learning is something that needs to be shared. You can’t do it 
all. As the old expression goes, “Many hands make light work.”
Some people worry that all this online social media stuff is robbing us of our 
real-world sociability. Are we forgetting how to just sit down in F2F (that’s 
face-to-face, of course) situations to relax, chat, and brainstorm? After all, 
relationships in the physical world are based on real trust and rapport — 
how does it work in social media, where others are not much more than a 
username, or at most (with Skype) a disembodied smiling face and distant 
voice?
 
Walter Schwabe, social entrepreneur and CEO of FusedLogic, the social media 
strategy outfit behind North America’s largest fringe festival, takes the trust 
and rapport problem seriously. That’s why after building up a followership 
through his online blogging and tweeting, he suggested at one point that 
the folks in his online community get together — gasp, yes, in real life — on 
a monthly basis to talk about social media in friendlier confines. So on a 
warm September evening, 14 people from his local area (Edmonton, Alberta, 
Canada) got together as the newly formed group Social Web Meetup. Today, 
that group is the second largest in the Edmonton area with nearly 160 mem-
bers, and it continues to grow. A big part of the group’s success is the use of 
the interest-group finder Meetup (www.meetup.com).
Not surprisingly, a ton of great ideas typically fly around the room at any 
given Social Web Meetup meeting, and the synergy level is high. Out of that 
come many opportunities for further collaborative learning as people from 
all walks of life and level of Internet savvy attend to find out more about the 
impact of social media. “We invite members to take one of four 15-minute pre-
sentation slots,” Schwabe says. “The rules are simple: Present on anything 
social media– or Web 2.0 application–related.” The group is exposed to new 
applications being developed locally, projects looking for collaborators, or 
just interesting developments in the space. Attending bloggers and tweeters 
write about what they learn and promote others within the group. Schwabe, 
for example, routinely blogs and comments on Twitter about the activities 
and people he meets through the meetings, always pushing to promote col-
laborative learning among members as well as their businesses or projects.
Rapport: The key to keeping it real
Always work to identify key personal traits of new contacts you make online 
and then follow up offline if possible. Building rapport is far easier if you 

190
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
“listen” to others and learn what’s important to them. For example, let’s say 
that someone on Twitter explains that they enjoy a particular type of food, 
hobby, or point of view. If those things align with your perspective, there is a 
foundation for rapport.
 
Don’t overlook the little things that could create an atmosphere that’s condu-
cive to establishing rapport. The interesting thing about social media is that 
by its sheer power of numbers it has exponentially increased this capability.
If whuffie is your personal form of social currency, rapport is your interper-
sonal form. Both forms are steeped in the emotions that go with human rela-
tionships. People who make their livings as negotiators, for example, know 
well that humans are immersed in currents of emotion and that these emo-
tions are vital to the social world.
 
Look to increase trust online through whuffie building. But in face-to-face 
meetings, generating rapport is another vital way to keep relationships and 
collaborative learning friendly, lively, and engaging.
But what exactly do we mean by rapport? Dictionaries may say something 
like “a relationship of mutual understanding or trust and agreement between 
people.” We say it’s a harmonious and freely given mutual trust and apprecia-
tion between people. The classic example is you know you have a rapport 
with someone when you have the feeling that you’re hitting it off almost 
instantly with them.
 
Bob Rosenthal, professor of psychology at the University of California, 
Riverside, has found that rapport always entails three elements:
 
✓ Mutual attention
 
✓ Mutual friendliness and caring
 
✓ Mutual coordination
Mutual attention at the outset is critical — it jump-starts the process. But 
mutual attention isn’t likely without empathy; all parties have to have the 
ability to relate to each other, to imaginatively put themselves in the other 
person’s shoes. When this happens, people feel that others are “getting” 
them, appreciating them not only in terms of understanding them but also in 
terms of feeling good about them.
When the empathy and appreciation are there, it’s no surprise that friendli-
ness and caring emerge, and people align themselves with each other (which 
Rosenthal calls coordination). People with rapport don’t interrupt each other, 
for example. Each person’s body language may naturally mirror the other’s. 

191
 Chapter 11: Mixing It Up: Using Social Networking and Social Media
Nonverbal signals don’t clash and get in the way of engaging and communi-
cating. Turn-taking may happen: One person allows the other to lead, and 
when that generosity is reciprocated, there is the potential for some real 
chemistry.
Building whuffie and rapport
 
Want some other ideas on establishing whuffie and rapport? Here are a few 
suggestions:
 
✓ Ask questions about the other person, listen carefully, and talk about 
the other person as much as you can. Be generous without being com-
pulsive about it.
 
✓ Bringing your whuffie with you to a new community can be difficult if 
that group has no knowledge of who you are or what your reputation is, 
so draw on your friends — they can promote your authentic reputation. 
That helps build trust in you, which is basic to rapport. Aside from that, 
here’s another great way to build rapport with a new group: Offer to 
speak to them on a topic of common interest.
 
✓ Dress well. It may sound either silly or obvious, but first impressions do 
count. If you and a friend are attending a networking event in which your 
friend has a vested interest, make every effort to add to and not dimin-
ish your friend’s own prestige. When in doubt, opt for a professional 
look and demeanor and you’ll serve your friend and yourself to your 
advantage.
 
✓ Keep up on the news, especially if it’s related to the community you’re 
trying to introduce yourself to. You probably shouldn’t start off trying 
to pass yourself off as an expert, but when you know something about 
people’s professional lives, they’ll be flattered. The friend you’re with 
can probably brief you on a few pertinent subjects beforehand.
 
✓ Have a great attitude. Be charming and exude enthusiasm, confidence, 
and the passionate thought of the charismatic social entrepreneur. 
When people see this in you, and your focus remains solidly on them, 
you should have little trouble building rapport.
 
✓ Let others know you care. Find some way, however small, to help who-
ever you’re meeting. Is there some favor that you can do for them? Build 
that whuffie — just don’t overdo it. If you’ve been listening closely and 
asking the right types of questions, something should suggest itself.
 
✓ Keep at it. The rapport you establish should not be a one-off deal. You 
shouldn’t hesitate to let the people you meet know that you’ve appreci-
ated getting to know them. Exchange business cards and follow up with 
a professional and thoughtful “it was great to meet you” e-mail. A hand-
written note would probably make an even better impression.

Collaborative Intelligence and 
Collaborative Learning
Many people these days give social networking a try either because they 
hope it will somehow raise their marketing or public relations profile — or 
because they’ve been told they should and they find that they enjoy the fun 
and fascination of it all. These motivations have their place, whether you’re a 
business entrepreneur or just someone looking for casual leisure, but social 
entrepreneurs need to get into social networking because doing so is a great 
way to make good use of collaborative intelligence.
Collaborative intelligence — the cumulative problem-solving power of a group 
of people working together toward the same goal — can help solve very dif-
ficult, seemingly intractable social problems. Collaborative intelligence is the 
result of collaborative learning, the enhanced ability of a group to discover, 
absorb, and share information.
Committing to collaborative learning
Social entrepreneurs who commit to collaborative learning through their 
social networks find that their profile is, indeed, raised and that they can 
have fun and be fascinated along the way along, too.
 
So how do you start collaboratively learning? To create an atmosphere in your 
social enterprise that’s conducive to collaborative learning, keep the following 
principles in mind as you go:
 
✓ Commit to change and enjoy the process of changing.
 
✓ Recruit diversity of opinion and thought.
 
✓ Make space for candid, respectful, and thoughtful communication.
 
✓ Always respect confidentiality.
 
✓ Value and obtain consensus and respect the role of compromise.
 
✓ Develop a shared vision and mission with your collaborators.
 
✓ Aim for clearly identified and doable outcomes, make specific action 
plans, and clarify roles.

193
 Chapter 11: Mixing It Up: Using Social Networking and Social Media
Using social bookmarking 
sites to collaborate
 
When you establish and include others in your quest to achieve collaborative 
learning, a logical point of departure might be to involve networked friends in 
the research function first (see the “Four functions of social media for social 
entrepreneurs” section earlier in this chapter if you’re not sure what we mean 
by research function).
Someone might propose a question or topic of shared interest, for example. If 
everyone agrees on the importance of the suggestion, collaborators can then 
begin to comb the Web for information, bookmarking, and sharing their find-
ings. Eventually, those findings may become collaboratively compiled into 
a collection. Starting with the research function allows for your group to set 
clear and doable parameters for success, which, if the project is important 
enough in the first place, will help to sustain the effort invested along the way.
In case you’re not too familiar with the idea of social bookmarking, what’s 
involved is that you save Web page links that you want to remember and pos-
sibly share with others. If you’re thinking about sharing your bookmarks, you 
can choose to make them public or save them privately to your account, in 
which case you can then choose to keep them to yourself or share them with 
specified people or groups.
Many browser-based social bookmarking services are available. The follow-
ing are some of the better-known ones:
 
✓ Delicious: http://delicious.com
 
✓ Digg: www.digg.com
 
✓ Diigo: www.diigo.com
 
✓ Mr. Wong: www.mister-wong.com
 
✓ Simpy: www.simpy.com
 
✓ StumbleUpon: www.stumbleupon.com
You can generally view your bookmarks chronologically or arrange them by 
category or even tag them (assign keywords to them). The advantage of tag-
ging is that you and others can know how often certain tags are used and, 
in the case of public tags, access the associated bookmarks. All in all, social 
bookmarking proves to be a great way to get your collaborative community 
researching and sharing knowledge. To start, just visit one of the Web sites in 
the list just given and follow the directions to join the service. It’s really easy, 
trust us.

194
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
What you need to look for in a bookmarking service is the ease of gather-
ing bookmarks, researching features (capturing, annotating, highlighting, 
tagging, and so on), cataloging and retrieval capabilities, and the ease with 
which you can share, follow your fellow collaborators’ activities, and collabo-
rate to compile results.
With successful social bookmarking can come the recognition and celebra-
tion of a growing learning network’s accomplishments. Documenting the 
growth and legacies of that community can take place through a social net-
working site such as Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, or LinkedIn, for example. 
Each member can have a personal profile, of course, but there should also be 
a hub-like group profile page to which all members of the learning community 
link. In this way, members can be integrated into the group’s life and activi-
ties. The hub can also provide an invitational presence to those who might 
become aware of the group’s activities and want to participate.
Whatever is happening within your learning community, be sure to always, 
always, always communicate to get your full advantage of social media. Like 
a pulse, the notification function (e-mail, blogging, Twitter, Facebook) is a 
measure of the life and rhythm of your enterprise or group. No notifications 
over a prolonged period of time? Be worried. On the other hand, when your 
learning community’s lively pulse is noticed by others, it may start to spread 
the word about your efforts far afield. Who knows? Something your group is 
up to might garner so much attention that it goes viral (takes on a life of its 
own, spreading far and wide). That would be something. No marketing money 
can top that.
Six degrees of separation
A key idea in networking is that the world of 
social relationships is really a lot smaller than 
we think. How long a chain does it take to con-
nect one arbitrary person to another arbitrary 
person anywhere in the world? Approximately 
six people. This is the famous six degrees of 
separation idea initially researched by psy-
chologist Stanley Milgram. Milgram asked for a 
message to be passed from randomly selected 
people in Kansas and Nebraska to a particular 
target person in Boston who was completely 
unknown to the initial message recipient. By 
using a chain of acquaintances, it took only an 
average of 5.5 intermediaries to successfully 
deliver the message to the target. Weak ties 
can get difficult jobs done.
In his best-selling book The Tipping Point, 
Malcolm Gladwell argues that you can boost 
your six degrees’ chances of success if one or 
more of the people you interface with is what 
he calls a connector — an extraordinary hub of 
a person enmeshed in large networks of con-
tacts and friends. Connectors can boost your 
movement along the human web, whereas 
others may slow things down. So pay particular 
attention to any well-connected people in your 
social network — they’re your connectors.

Greenroom Strategies: 
Winning with the Media
In This Chapter
▶ Considering your media outreach strategy
▶ Creating media materials, including media releases, media kits, and media advisories
▶ Holding media conferences
▶ Following up on your efforts and successes
W
e place a lot of emphasis in this book on the importance of culture 
and communication. In order to get your message out to any target 
audiences you may be interested in reaching, it’s good for you to think in 
terms of introducing or entering conversations. Conversations are inviting, 
non-threatening, fluid, and often fun ways of communicating within culture. 
No matter who you’re talking to, conversations can provide you with remark-
able opportunities to promote your world-changing views and practices, 
often while laying the groundwork for mutual benefit.
Conversations are effective ways of socializing toward positive social change. 
This approach stands in contrast to, for example, paid advertising or marketing 
campaigns, which have the disadvantage of being perceived as naked attempts 
at social engineering, as sneaky “spin” or even heavy-handed propaganda.
In this chapter, we help you prepare for those times when you want to 
communicate with your public through various conventional, if sometimes 
independent, media outlets such as the press, television, and radio. For an 
introduction to the complex and ever-changing world of social media, see 
Chapter 11.
Why Media Relations Matters
Let’s face it — you’re not selling deodorant or soft drinks. So, you have to 
be subtler in your use of the media to get your message out. As a social 

196
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
entrepreneur, you appreciate how important it is to affect social change in 
a cooperative way that doesn’t get people’s hackles up. So it makes sense, 
then, to stay away from heavy handedness and steer toward more consider-
ate, nuanced ways of communicating your message.
 
One of the best ways to engage in conversations with people who will be inter-
ested in your message is by channeling your messages through the media, 
especially independent (or alternative) media. There’s a good reason for this: 
Independent media are free, or freer, of the perceived biases of corporate- or 
government-owned media.
On the other hand, independent media (including radio, print, TV, and the 
Internet) are often perceived as being more critical. So, if a report on what 
you’re up to passes the litmus test of the integrity of independent journalism, 
then what you have to offer is presumably worth knowing about.
 
Here are a couple of starting points with which social entrepreneurs have had 
some success:
 
✓ Independent Media Center: If you have a story, a story idea, or an alert 
of national or international interest, the best place to begin may be with 
the widely respected Independent Media Center (www.indymedia.org).
 
✓ The Indypendent: Another option is New York City Independent Media 
Center (IMC), which puts out The Indypendent (www.indypendent.
org), an award-winning bi-weekly “free paper for free people,” which 
is, these days, the most widely circulated underground paper in North 
America.
 
✓ WireTap: If your communication has a youth twist to it, try WireTap 
Magazine (www.wiretapmag.org).
 
There are many independent print, TV and video, radio, online, local, ethnic, 
and student, kinds of media producers who would love to hear from you. 
Search the Web for “independent media” and the name of your city or state. 
You should find something of interest to you very quickly. (For example, 
searching for “independent media Florida” immediately turns up the Miami 
Independent Media Center, along with a number of other Florida IMCs.)
Social entrepreneurs are often seen as friendlier to the independent media 
side of things than the corporate world is. It’s kind of like when a friend 
introduces you to someone else he knows well. Your friend is vouching for 
you, and that makes it easier for the stranger to accept you — at least 
provisionally — and that’s an important foot in the door. Independent media 
tend to be friendlier and more receptive toward the goals of social entrepre-
neurs than corporate media are.

197
 Chapter 12: Greenroom Strategies: Winning with the Media
 
Overall, of course, in terms of your credibility, the more positive things about 
your cause that are communicated through any kind of media, the better.
There are other reasons why you should engage in media relations, espe-
cially through independent media:
 
✓ Getting your message out through independent media is a really 
cheap way of conversing with your target audience. It’s essentially 
free.
 
✓ When you provide the media with trustworthy and interesting infor-
mation, they gain as well, which is great for everyone. In Chapter 2, 
we talk about creating public compassion, and in this context it’s nice to 
know that those who help you will be around to help others.
 
✓ As journalism goes through its current economic crisis, the reputation 
of independent media is likely to continue growing. This trend will 
probably only further the reach of anything you have to say, through 
them, in the future.
 
✓ As you develop your media relations, and as you get your foot into 
more and more doors, you’ll find that other people will be contacting 
you from non-media organizations to learn more, which is what you 
wanted in the first place, right? Political representatives; chambers of 
commerce of various kinds; tourist associations; consulates or embas-
sies; the United Way; and other nonprofit or public-sector agencies, 
professional associations, civic groups, and university departments will 
be increasingly aware of what you’re up to. This provides more grist for 
both your work and the public compassion mill.
 
✓ The more media coverage you have, the higher and more favorable 
your profile will be to current and future volunteers, supporters, and 
financial donors, and, of course, to those you serve.
The next obvious question is: “How do I do that?” First, and only briefly as a 
basic foundation, you need to refine your pitch or story and build out some 
very basic assets for the media to use, such as team biographies complete 
with bullet point highlights and headshots. Next comes more methodical 
work on two major fronts:
 
✓ Outreach: This front deals with the very human process of making and 
keeping contact with the media.
 
✓ Production: This front deals with producing and disseminating trust-
worthy and interesting content into the hands of media people.
In the next sections we take a look at each of these.

Part III: Growing Your Organization 
Focusing on Your Media Outreach
There are two main ways to reach out to media:
 
✓ You can suggest material to them.
 
✓ You can be the go-to organization whenever the media is interested in 
something that has to do with your work.
 
Although you should definitely try to gain access to the media in both ways, 
the passive route (being the go-to organization) is actually much more valu-
able in the long run. After all, it’s not going to do your cause much good to 
simply hand a couple of good stories to the media and then ride off into the 
sunset. But if you’re a proven and reliable source of information for them — 
and you can also supply them with stories — then you’ll be worth your weight 
in platinum. And that will establish valuable recognition for your cause among 
the media folks.
 
If you do manage to become a media point person for your cause, the biggest 
cost to you won’t be financial. It’ll be the cost of your time and commitment. 
You’ll need to be on call 24/7/365, or very nearly. That is, if the media tries to 
reach you, you need to respond very promptly. Media have deadlines, so if 
you’re not available, they don’t wait for you — they call someone else. But if 
you’re easy to reach, they’ll learn to go to you first because it saves them time.
 
Be quotable and keep in mind that you’re helping them write the story, so 
offer suggestions and other people to contact. Make the job of media people 
easier, and they’ll come back to you again and again.
Sometimes you need to play things cautiously. If you’re put on the spot, you 
either need to answer as best you can, refer the matter to someone more 
qualified to respond, or decline with a polite “no comment.” Be warned, 
though, the media people are generally really put off by the “no comment” 
tactic, so use it incredibly sparingly and only when you absolutely must.
 
What are the best media to approach? Here are the five main options:
 
✓ Print: Newspapers, magazines, newsletters, internal, and trade 
publications.
 
✓ Television: News programs (regional and cable), talk shows, and public 
service announcements.

199
 Chapter 12: Greenroom Strategies: Winning with the Media
 
✓ Radio: News programs (regional and local), interview shows, and com-
munity calendar announcements.
 
✓ Wire services: Examples include the Associated Press (www.ap.org), 
United Press International (www.upi.com), Reuters (www.reuters.
com), and PR Newswire (www.prnewswire.com).
 
✓ Online news publications and blogs: Examples include Yahoo! News 
(http://news.yahoo.com), Google News (http://news.google.
com), The Huffington Post (www.huffingtonpost.com), and Daily 
Beast (www.thedailybeast.com). Do some research to figure out 
what media your target audience reads and listens to. Doing so helps 
you figure out which sources to target first. Many online publications 
such as The Huffington Post don’t take pitches because they have no 
staff reporters per se (yet). In those cases you need to write an article 
and submit it for consideration (though that’s hard to accomplish — 
they may accept material only through invitation).
Within each media type, try to identify who specializes in covering stories on 
topics that have something to do with your efforts. Generally, these folks are
 
✓ Journalists or reporters (the front-line investigators and writers)
 
✓ Editors or producers (who coordinate the efforts of journalists)
Both kinds of media contacts are assigned to specific areas or desks, such 
as city/region/national news, health, consumer, lifestyle, and environment 
areas.
Features — usually human interest stories or investigative pieces — are the 
responsibility of editors, and talk shows are the responsibility of producers.
 
Try to identify the journalists or reporters first. Get to know them better 
by visiting their Web sites and possibly accessing their archived writings. 
Nowadays, many journalists put their e-mail addresses right there in their 
bylines. Send an e-mail, making it short and to the point. You can also contact 
the appropriate editors. To figure out who’s who, have a look at the media 
mastheads or credits.
You need to identify and keep an updated list of all the media outlets that 
you might be interested in approaching. You should do this well before you 
ever make contact with any of them. A short list of the data you may consider 
collecting includes the following:
 
✓ Media organization name
 
✓ Media contact name and title

200
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
 
✓ Area of expertise/interest
 
✓ Address
 
✓ Phone and fax numbers
 
✓ E-mail address
 
✓ Personal notes
 
✓ Contact log
 
A spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, is a good way to organize 
this information. You may want to assign this task to a team of volunteers, 
with each volunteer researching a different media sector, such as print, radio, 
television, online news services, and so on. Contact other partner organiza-
tions and share your lists with each other.
When you have your list, be selective when you send out material (discussed 
later in this chapter). Pick your spots. The media is all about audiences. They 
serve audiences and they buy and sell them to advertisers. Know who will be 
most interested in your material because it connects to their audiences.
 
Don’t make the mistake of sending everybody everything all the time. That 
either annoys media folks because you’re adding needlessly to their work 
load, or desensitizes them to anything you send. And the last thing you want 
them to do is stop paying attention to you.
Creating a media outreach calendar
It’s also a great idea to develop a media rela-
tions outreach calendar. This calendar sets 
out important upcoming dates. Once they 
are established, you should plan on getting 
your press releases out two to four weeks in 
advance of the dates for daily and weekly 
publications, and eight weeks in advance for 
monthly publications.
And who do you send it to? Refer to your media 
contact spreadsheet. Typical contacts include 
calendar editors, assignment editors, beat 
reporters (always keeping in mind their inter-
ests), and radio stations that broadcast a com-
munity calendar or have a public affairs bent. 
For those radio stations that are music only, 
consider event partnerships, where the station 
sponsors and promotes the event.

 Chapter 12: Greenroom Strategies: Winning with the Media
Feeding the Media Monster: 
Producing Your Materials
In this section, we look at how to create trustworthy and interesting content 
for media. Keeping in mind that this content is designed to advance some 
sort of program, event, or newsworthy effort of yours, you need to think in 
terms of producing that content before, during, and after the effort you want 
to promote.
At a minimum, you want to create press releases. A press release is a short 
and snappy article sent to media outlets about something with purported 
news value — your latest project, for example. You should also make a media 
kit, or press kit, which contains updated contact info and other information 
about your organization. If you’re planning a media event such as a media 
briefing or conference, you’ll create and send out a media advisory, followed 
by a release, in anticipation of the event.
Here we briefly consider planning, execution, and follow-up.
Planning your materials
Above all, if you’re going to help reporters and other media representatives 
help you reach your target audiences, you need to provide them with concise 
and complete media content.
In order to deliver that kind of content, besides identifying media sources, 
which we discussed in the previous section, you need to keep these things 
in mind:
 
✓ Your target audience: Whose awareness do you want to raise? Whose 
attitudes or actions do you want to influence? Write down a description 
of who you’re trying to reach. What do you know about these people? 
What are their core values, beliefs, social expectations, and sought-after 
benefits? And, most important, given where they’re at, how does your 
content meet them there and deliver?
 
✓ Your media materials and message: In order to figure out whether 
you’ve got something worthwhile to send to the media, ask yourself 
pointed questions about the following:
 
• Size of impact: How many people do your news items and/or pro-
grams impact?
 
• Newsworthiness: There are lots of other things going on around 
you. Compared to them, how important is your message?

202
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
 
• Locality: Is the story relevant to people living in local communities?
 
• Expressiveness: What is eye-catching, action oriented, or intui-
tively and humanly engaging about your message?
Writing press releases
The press release has been around forever because it’s one of the most effec-
tive ways to get the media interested in the efforts of citizens like you. More 
often than many people realize, press releases serve as the basis, if not the 
bulk, of news stories. To be effective, the press release must contain informa-
tion that’s newsworthy and not just glorified advertising.
 
When producing a press release, strive for journalistic merit, making what you 
say timely, important in terms of service to others, warm, engaging, and full of 
human interest.
Brevity is the soul of wit, and it’s also the soul of press releases. It’s common 
for media people to reject or ignore releases simply because they’re too long. 
These people are as busy as you are, so keep your release down to a single 
double-spaced page. That doesn’t mean that you can’t add extra background 
material, but the news contained in that first page should be brief and hit-
’em-over-the-head transparent.
Figure 12-1 shows a generic example of a press release you can use to get 
started.
 
Be sure to write a strong lead sentence or intro. Many media folks see hun-
dreds of releases a week, so they learn to quickly skim them and almost never 
read them thoroughly until they’ve decided to pursue the story.
Here are a couple of examples of strong leads, drawn from real media 
releases:
 
✓ Who says our community is indifferent? See for yourself the compas-
sion and spirit of people in our area who are making a real difference in 
the lives of others near and far. Join us as we celebrate and witness the 
spirit of social entrepreneurship among us on October 15, 2010, at the 
North-South Inn, 123 Center Street, Metropolis, NY.
 
✓ The Ministry of Community Development will be committing $10 million 
in the coming year to support capacity building within the social enter-
prise sector. This comes after the Ministry reviewed and overwhelm-
ingly accepted 20 recommendations put forward by the National Social 
Entrepreneurship Committee chaired by Mr. Phillip Smith and made up 
of members from the public and private sectors.

203
 Chapter 12: Greenroom Strategies: Winning with the Media
Don’t worry about trying to write the story for the media. They won’t use it 
exactly the way you’ve written it anyway — they’ll likely want to do things 
their own way. Just make sure you get the media’s attention and let them 
know how to get in touch with you or some other contact person.
 
If you have any history or familiarity with the professional you’re approaching, 
use it to your advantage. Target the press release so that it fits that particular 
person’s interests.

Part III: Growing Your Organization 
Assembling a media kit
Do the media know what they need to know about you or your organization? 
It’s up to you to provide the media with accurate, up-to-date contact informa-
tion and details about your enterprise. If you don’t, you’re leaving it to them 
to make something up. Make sure, then, that they have easy access to your 
media kit you. Media kits, sometimes called press kits, are used by media rep-
resentatives in putting together their stories.
Your media kit should be a package of compact and pertinent material that 
includes
 
✓ Your organization’s contact information, including contact person, 
phone number, address, e-mail address, and Web site
 
✓ Your mission statement
 
✓ Your organization’s objectives
 
✓ Your organization’s notable activities
 
✓ Short biographies of significant personnel
 
✓ Recent press releases, news articles, brochures, and any other materials 
that might help the media understand who you are and what you do
You should also put all that stuff online on your Web site and include the 
Web address, in case the media contact mislays some of your printed materi-
als (see Chapter 10 for more on branding and your print and Web content).
 
Don’t go overboard. Keep the material in the press kit thorough, but always 
relevant to the purpose at hand. Nobody likes to wade through reams of what, 
for them, is superfluous garbage, especially with deadlines looming.
Get feedback from others in your organization about ideas on what to include 
in your media kit. Anyone associated with you has to be on the same page 
with the information contained there. You don’t want anyone else telling a 
different story — that can make your efforts look disorganized and confused. 
You may want to develop a set of guidelines — maybe even a formal policy. 
You may also want to assign key people to be the media relations contacts 
for your organization; if you do, everyone else should funnel media inqui-
ries to those people (see the nearby sidebar, “Assigning a point person,” for 
more). These assigned folks should know and keep up-to-date on the central 
media and reporters covering your efforts.

205
 Chapter 12: Greenroom Strategies: Winning with the Media
Sending out your stuff
When you’ve convinced yourself that you’ve got something of interest and 
you’re ready to send it the media, stop. Are you remembering that media 
people are always on deadline and are constantly being bombarded by other 
interests vying for their attention? Do you have something short, enthusias-
tic, authoritative, punchy, and clear on the ways your message stands apart 
from others? If so, read on.
Send your media releases and media kits by mail, fax, e-mail, telephone, Pony 
Express, or however your media contacts prefer — and find out their prefer-
ences beforehand.
Holding a media event
A media event is an agreed-upon occasion, either spontaneous or planned, 
for mass media organizations, particularly television news, newspapers, and 
radio, to learn more about some important and newsworthy matter. There 
are two forms of media events: media briefs and media conferences. There 
are only two good reasons why you would want to hold a media event:
Assigning a point person
If you find that you’re too busy to handle the 
duties associated with being the media “go-to” 
or point person, you need to assign one or more 
spokespeople to interact with the media in your 
place. Everyone else should funnel media inqui-
ries to those people. And those spokespeople 
should know and keep up-to-date on the cen-
tral media and reporters covering your efforts. 
It should also go almost without saying that 
spokespeople should also keep in very close 
contact with you, the social entrepreneur, and 
report to you often.
Be very picky about who should be spokes-
people for your efforts. They should know their 
stuff about your work and the issues involved 
inside and out. They should also be person-
able, articulate, and unflappable under media 
fire. And try not to have more than two spokes-
people. Having too many folks speaking for you 
risks not only diluting or convoluting your mes-
sage but also confusing the people you want to 
reach with your message — your target audi-
ence. There should be a limited number of faces 
or voices officially associated with what you do.
Spokespeople serve as vital resources for the 
media — and target audiences — so they must 
be deeply involved, extremely knowledgeable, 
and comfortable appearing in front of cameras 
and microphones. Make sure, though, that your 
spokesperson’s reputation is stellar; a good 
deal of your organization’s reputation can be 
wrapped up in the spokesperson’s.

206
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
 
✓ You’ve got something really, really important to say — and it’s only with 
that expectation in mind that media will bother to attend. It goes with-
out saying that you’d better not disappoint if you go this route.
 
✓ You need to get your message out very quickly because something fast-
moving and high-profile is happening.
If neither of these circumstances is truly the case, then you don’t probably 
need to hold a media event. Instead, you need to stick to the normal media 
outreach channels we’ve covered so far.
If you’re going to hold a media event, you also send out a media advisory. 
A media advisory is simply an invitation for media to attend your briefing/
conference. You should include all pertinent details about your conference 
and should send out your advisory three to four weeks before your event. 
Your advisory should be attention grabbing, but also extremely to the point. 
And of course, you need to describe your event in a way that clearly demon-
strates its newsworthiness as well as that of your program.
Figure 12-2 shows one way to structure your media advisory.
 
After you send your media advisory, follow up quickly with a press release 
and then, just prior to the event, provide a media kit.
Media briefings
A media briefing is one of the best ways to have a positive impact on some-
one from the media. A media briefing is a short, personal, face-to-face, and 
dynamic meeting with a media contact. With a media briefing, you can 
exchange information efficiently, nip off any misunderstandings in the bud, 
and address further questions.
 
Plan ahead and set aside plenty of time: Scheduling one-on-one briefings can 
be tremendously time-consuming. Organizing just a handful of them can take 
up an entire morning or even a day if scheduling time with the media folks 
proves difficult.
Press conferences
A press conference is an event that you organize with the purpose of briefing 
several members of the press at once. A press conference is a lot more effi-
cient than scheduling one or more media briefings because you get to quickly 
exchange information with several people across various media at once. A 
level of synergy and excitement can develop around a media conference that 
can do wonders for generating publicity and awareness for your campaign.

WHERE: Name of building (street address, room number)
CONTACT: List contact person’s name, phone number, Web

sponsor(s), who the event is targeted toward, the event’s goal,
parking information, or anything else that media needs to
know about the event.
Your organization name and contact
information (includes address,
telephone numbers, Web contact links)
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
(Or speciﬁc date in future)
 
If you plan to hold a press conference, keep in mind the following:
 
✓ Be well organized. Things have to go off basically without a hitch, or the 
media will start to wonder who they’re really dealing with, and why.
 
✓ Provide opportunities for strong media involvement, such as photo 
opportunities, interviews, visual demonstrations, and so on.
 
After you’ve scheduled your conference, be sure that at least a couple of days in 
advance you’ve got all the details for the event down pat, including the following:
 
✓ The point person, often called a primary program coordinator, which 
could be you or someone you’ve assigned
 
✓ Contingency plans for unexpected surprises, including technology 
glitches

208
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
 
✓ Setup and rehearsal scheduled well before the media arrive — including 
mock run-throughs of demonstrations or speeches and reviewing critical 
messages and statistics
 
✓ The event parameters, such as who’s participating, their credentials, 
what they’ll be addressing, and what, if anything, the conference isn’t 
about
 
✓ An agenda covering all of the important details, along with a finalized 
media kit to distribute to attendees
 
✓ Reminder e-mails that go out a few hours before the event begins
 
One potential downside of a press conference is that it can, especially with 
extremely emotional issues, manifest the phenomenon known as pack jour-
nalism. One vocal reporter may have a mistaken idea about something or a 
partisan axe to grind, and soon enough the whole agenda is taken over by that 
issue. If you have any sense that things might come to this, take extra time at 
the beginning of the conference to outline the parameters and prepare to stick 
to them absolutely. Any digressions from the planned agenda can be nipped 
in the bud and dealt with later by sending out press releases and arranging 
for more personal media briefings. This approach is more time-consuming, of 
course, but it’s also far more manageable.
Following Up to Make Sure 
Your Message Gets Out
After you’ve sent out your press release or held your media event, you have 
to stay in touch with the media people just in case they need help focusing 
their story or obtaining vital but missing information. It shows care and dili-
gence when you follow up.
Even the most compelling information requires follow-up to make sure that 
the material was received and was satisfactory. Be sure you’re ready to field 
any inquiries and follow up any conversations with an e-mail or phone call. 
Continue to check in periodically, without making yourself a nuisance, in 
order to maintain interest.
 
Be prepared for fading enthusiasm. You don’t control the media, of course, 
and it may be that for any number of reasons the commitment to your story 
that seemed so strong at first has declined. This is where you have to be ready 
to spring into action. Your last chance to ensure coverage for your program 
may rest on following up on your event or release. Don’t wait too long — a few 
days — to do so. Be careful not to nag. Concentrate on being informative and 
concise.

209
 Chapter 12: Greenroom Strategies: Winning with the Media
 
Be prepared to be misquoted or to have points raised that you prefer to not 
be mentioned. Remember that anything you say to the press is likely to get 
used, so be mindful of your words. A casual slip in friendly conversation could 
become the focus of the story.
Despite your need to present yourself in the best possible light, always be 
honest when dealing with the media. If you’re not, you lose credibility, trust, 
and respect — and you could be looking at a very negative story about you 
that could seriously compromise the success of your organization. Asking 
that a story that went awry be “killed” won’t help you — it’s viewed as an 
insult to journalistic integrity and freedom of speech.
If media reports do actually develop out of your efforts, congratulations. 
You’ve taken a step toward using the culture to advance your goals and the 
interests of your target of benefits.
 
Always catalog and archive your media coverage. Doing so gives you a chance 
to assess what kind of progress you’ve made with your media campaign and 
provides valuable reference material for future endeavors. It’s a good idea to 
recap everything in a single document that outlines
 
✓ What you hoped to accomplish with your media relations campaign
 
✓ What you ended up accomplishing
 
✓ Which media contacts you garnered or successfully used again
 
✓ Suggested future directions for similar activities in the future

Keeping Kafka at Bay: Dealing 
with Bureaucracy
In This Chapter
▶ Defining and identifying bureaucracy
▶ Understanding your organization’s own bureaucracy
▶ Keeping bureaucracy flat instead of fat
▶ Finding alternatives to bureaucracy
▶ Dealing with external bureaucracies
F
ormer U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy once said, “The only thing that 
saves us from the bureaucracy is inefficiency. An efficient bureaucracy 
is the greatest threat to liberty.”
To us, bureaucracy shouldn’t be thought of as an inevitable mass of annoying 
rules and procedures, but rather as an arrangement among people in a social 
enterprise that helps them carry out its mission and goals. This rather benign 
view of bureaucracy works as long as you don’t allow the bureaucracy to get 
more complicated than necessary.
 
Bureaucracy can be mighty useful, as long as it doesn’t eat into your free-
dom to pursue your mission. But you have to always watch and control it. 
Bureaucracy left untended has a way of swelling itself into a monster.
In this chapter, we examine different types and tendencies of bureaucracies 
as they relate to the social enterprise and offer tips for getting and keeping a 
handle on it.
Bureaucracy and the Chain of Command
Organizations, whether they intend to or not, establish bureaucracies to 
administrate the pursuit of their goals. So, the bureaucracy in your 

212
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
organization is composed of the people in your organization who carry out, 
or staff, this administration.
Note that these administrators (also known as staff or bureaucrats) don’t set 
the organizational goals, and they don’t set the policies for reaching those 
goals. Instead, they administer what the social entrepreneur — the owner, 
president, directive council, secretary general, chief executive officer, or 
other top leader in the organization — develops as the enterprise’s mission, 
goals, and policy. So, bureaucracies typically consist of people lower in the 
organization’s chain of command.
 
Bureaucrats do what they are told — they don’t make the rules, they follow 
them.
Among bureaucrats you find advisors, managers, supervisors, division heads, 
directors of task forces, chairs of committees, and similar personnel. These 
workers may set rules and procedures to implement policy — though not the 
policies themselves — although rules and procedures to implement policies 
are sometimes set by the leaders at the top as well.
Hierarchically speaking, people in the organization serving below the bureau-
cracy are the ones who actually carry out policy and directly try to reach 
its goals. Sometimes called line workers, they actually produce the organiza-
tion’s goods or services by working within the rules and procedures set by 
the administrators. The administrators are responsible for seeing that the 
line workers perform as expected according to the rules and procedures.
Not all social enterprises are bureaucratized in any significant degree, but 
those that are generally look like this:
 
✓ Leaders: These are the mission and goal setters, as well as the policy 
makers. They’re the social entrepreneurs — the ones who have an idea 
for a socially conscious business and are working to make that idea a 
reality.
 
✓ Administrators: Below the leaders are the bureaucrats — the people 
who make sure that the leaders’ goals are met.
 
✓ Line workers: At the bottom of the totem pole are the line workers, or 
producers. They do what the administrators tell them to do, in order for 
the organization to reach the leaders’ goals.
This chapter centers primarily on the middle section — the bureaucracy and 
its administrators.
Large and complex social entrepreneurial organizations often also have other 
kinds of personnel whose functions lie outside this chain of command. They 
include people providing cleaning, repair, and security services who, though 
not directly involved in reaching organizational goals, may nevertheless 
report to an administrative unit.

213
 Chapter 13: Keeping Kafka at Bay: Dealing with Bureaucracy
 
Many social enterprises have no bureaucracy. All the administrative services 
they need are supplied by the leaders. One or a few people set the mission 
and goals, make policy, and manage everyone. These leaders may even per-
form some line functions. In fact, the vast majority of social enterprises start 
out this way, and, typically, at this point, the founders give little or no thought 
to bureaucratizing.
Whereas many social enterprises never bureaucratize, some eventually do. 
They may develop administrative units staffed by only a handful of people — for 
example, a manager and a couple of committee chairs. At the other end of the 
scale of bureaucratic complexity are large organizations like the International 
Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International. The former presently 
has around 13,000 administrative and line workers, whereas the latter employs 
approximately 500 staff. The bureaucratic structure of the social enterprise can, 
under certain conditions, become enormous.
 
Bureaucracy tends to grow. At any point, new rules, procedures, and positions 
may be established, such as when a department head creates a new secre-
tarial post or the director of finance institutes a new accounting procedure. 
As bureaucracy grows, the social entrepreneur and other leaders of the enter-
prise may lose more and more control over the administrative expansion. 
They may also lose more and more control over how their enterprise is man-
aged in its routine operations. This growth of bureaucracy isn’t necessarily a 
bad thing, as long as the administrative group remains attuned to the mission, 
goals, and policy of the enterprise and respects budgetary limits.
Flat Bureaucracy: Keeping Things Lean
Don’t get us wrong: Even continued growth in bureaucratization is not neces-
sarily a bad thing. As the enterprise succeeds, its initial flat bureaucracy may 
naturally begin to bulge a bit, simply because new needs emerge and new 
people must be found to meet them.
For example, there may come a time — after your organization has funding — 
when you appoint a treasurer to handle the accounting for the annual budget 
and explain its use to paying members and would-be funders. Incorporation 
as a nonprofit group (see Chapter 7) will require a formal board of directors, 
probably a paid executive director, and some paid staff. Similarly, the need 
for a recruitment officer or organizational unit could develop as the demand 
grows for more volunteers and paid staff.
 
The individuality of social enterprises makes it difficult to generalize about 
just how and where your flat bureaucracy will start to bulge. But you should 
expect that it will.

214
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
Over-bureaucratization and bureaucratic bloat come from adding more orga-
nizational functions than required and/or more people to carry them out 
than needed. In fact, through the ages, over-bureaucratization is what has 
provoked most of the unkind comments about bureaucracy — not its useful 
flat version.
Setting limits
One of the biggest problems in organizing a social enterprise is that, as the 
charismatic social entrepreneur inspires others to rally around and help 
reach the organization’s goals, efforts to manage and sustain these grass-
roots initiatives tend to become increasingly bureaucratized. One conse-
quence of this tendency is that the heart and soul of social change — the 
founding nucleus of enthusiasts — may become disenchanted. When those 
people start to lose their spark, the humanity and vision behind the initia-
tives for change can start to erode. And so can your chances for success.
Enterprises destined to grow into large organizations usually can’t avoid this 
bloat, which is sometimes called bureaucratic creep. Their very size demands 
an increasing number of specialized units and subunits. Typical ones include 
the following:
 
✓ A financial department staffed by various tax, bookkeeping, and account-
ing specialists
 
✓ A hiring department charged with recruiting and retaining volunteers
 
✓ A human resources department to look after the needs of the swelling 
gang of paid workers
Unfortunately, this transformation tends to push the original, free-spirited 
heart and soul of the enterprise into the organization’s least bureaucratized 
corners, if not out the door altogether. Even you, the founding charismatic 
entrepreneur, may find that you’re increasingly shackled by these inescap-
able transformations.
Heavily bureaucratized enterprises may well be over-bureaucratized, but 
they may also still be mostly filled with volunteers and paid staff who are 
used to functioning under the new conditions. The founding cluster of free 
spirits may have adapted, found their own island of relative freedom, or left 
the organized side of the cause — the social enterprise itself — to work 
independently.
Nevertheless, whatever the stage of growth, you want to try to prune excess 
bureaucratic limbs. Over-bureaucratization adds needless costs while grind-
ing down the people who have to try to get things done within it.

215
 Chapter 13: Keeping Kafka at Bay: Dealing with Bureaucracy
Staying on a bureaucratic diet
What if your enterprise is not necessarily destined to become a bureaucratic 
monster? Can the organization accomplish all that the founders and present 
leaders ever wanted without moving beyond the flat stage of organization? Yes.
Organizations that take this route try to preserve the inventive enthusiasm 
characteristic of the founding leaders, administrators, and workers, while 
meeting organizational needs with minimal addition of offices, departments, 
divisions, specialized personnel, and so on. Such enthusiasm flourishes best 
in an open environment that is receptive to new ideas as well as criticism.
 
Maintaining a flat bureaucracy is a delicate process. Those enterprises that 
manage it well constantly monitor the bureaucracy and its growth, a task that 
usually falls to the leaders. These kinds of leaders typically have a keen sense 
of oversight and an unwavering focus on the mission. And they use these two 
qualities to not only enable their enterprise to realize its goals, but to maintain 
the enthusiasm among volunteers and paid staff.
Avoiding the Tendency to 
Over-Bureaucratize
In this section, we discuss three main ways you can avoid creating a fat, or 
bloated, bureaucracy.
Having realistic expectations
One unexpected advantage of nonprofits, especially ones that struggle with 
funding, is that budgetary constraints themselves go a long way toward 
dampening leader and administrator enthusiasm for over-bureaucratization. 
When too little money is available for spending on underproductive arrange-
ments or purchases of any kind — be they office rent, state-of-the-art elec-
tronic equipment, volunteers, or paid staff — then there likely will be no 
bloating problem in the first place.
 
One way to avoid the tendency to over-bureaucratize is to inquire, of every 
proposal that crops up: “Is it financially realistic for us to do this?” The trea-
surer is typically the person who asks this question (and even answers it), but 
any member of the enterprise may ask it. In fact, other people must ask it if 
the treasurer doesn’t. An accountant familiar with the mission and everyday 
operations of the enterprise also often weighs in.

216
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
Asking if you can do without expansion
The group may eventually say yes to the question of whether a proposed 
expansion is realistic — they believe the money is there. Okay, fine. Time for 
another question: “Can we do without the proposed expansion?”
Even though the group may be able to afford it, expansion may not be unnec-
essary. The question is a reminder that, before any organizational damage is 
done, you need to nip the tendency for over-bureaucratization in the bud.
 
The “whether we can do without it” question puts up a second roadblock on 
the path toward fat bureaucracy. But this second question also eventually 
may get answered with a yes, following plenty of level-headed discussion. 
The group decides that the proposed new function is feasible and desirable 
both financially and organizationally, and no, they can’t do without it (which 
more often means, they don’t want to do without it). Expansion proceeds as 
planned. But down the road a year, two years, the bureaucratic addition turns 
out to be less than what had been hoped for.
A third way of avoiding the tendency is to revisit past expansion decisions 
(see the next section).
Assessing expansion
A good social entrepreneur must have the wisdom and courage to put an 
end to any expansion that has turned out to be anything less than promised. 
Governments often deal with such things through sunset provisions. When a 
law has a sunset provision, the default decision is to cancel it after a certain 
amount of time. After a specified number of years, new positions, depart-
ments, policies, procedures, and so on are automatically terminated, unless a 
case can be made for retaining them for another period of time. This method 
forced proponents of expansion to justify themselves.
 
If you want to maintain a flat bureaucracy, adopt sunset provisions in your 
policies. If you don’t, you’ll have to find the courage to reevaluate bureau-
cratic growth on a case-by-case basis.
Avoiding over-bureaucratization is not easy. Frequently the leader and other 
members of the enterprise must summon considerable courage and wisdom 
to respect — sometimes it’s hard to even remember — the ideal of retain-
ing their good old flat bureaucracy. Even preventing it from bulging further 
requires strong leadership.

217
 Chapter 13: Keeping Kafka at Bay: Dealing with Bureaucracy
 
Conflict can arise during reevaluation of expansions. People don’t always 
agree that a recent addition or the one being proposed was bad for the enter-
prise. Some may want to grow in certain ways for reasons other than advanc-
ing the mission and may even band together to push for expansion. Catering 
to their special interests can strike others as favoritism (a managerial problem 
we take up in a bit more detail in Chapter 18). Trying to prevent these alli-
ances from sabotaging the practical good sense of keeping the bureaucracy 
flat can test even the best of leaders.
Adhocracy: Alternatives to Bureaucracy
There are ways of organizing that avoid bureaucracy, but they’re really effec-
tive only in the short term. In this section, we talk about temporary alter-
natives to bureaucracy. From the start, every participant in these types of 
organization knows that
 
✓ The arrangement is aimed at accomplishing a particular, practical goal.
 
✓ The arrangement will cease to exist once the goal is reached.
Task forces
A task force is a temporary unit within an enterprise that is assembled to 
complete a special informational task or work on a particular activity or 
problem. Senior administrators are the ones who establish task forces and 
set the goals the task forces are supposed to pursue. A task force may be 
established to gather information on the legal situation of the group’s goals, 
to identify the most productive ways to work with politicians, or to gather 
information about, say, the South American tribe with which the enterprise 
intends to work with on a water purification project.
Task forces are now common in government, industry, and the nonprofit 
sector. Their duration varies depending on the nature and difficulty of the 
work they’re assigned to accomplish. Because they’re technically outside the 
bureaucracy, they’re intended to disappear — though only when their work 
is completed.
Task forces are a special kind of team (see Chapter 17 for more on team-
work), but they’re considerably more autonomous than most teams. Task 
force members are high enough in the bureaucracy of your enterprise to be 
regarded as capable of working with minimal direction or need to report to 
superiors. Plus, members of task forces often have to be mobile; they must 
be able to travel on sudden notice or even temporarily relocate somewhere 
to accomplish the goals of their group.

218
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
Task force members must also be flexible in their approach to realizing 
these goals, using their abilities and knowledge in creative ways. Because 
of this requirement, task forces are often staffed with people who repre-
sent a range of outlooks and backgrounds that bear on the central interest 
of the task force. In short, a typical task force is like a prism, where each 
face, or member, brings a different perspective of experience and expertise. 
Consequently, some task forces may be staffed with people who are not even 
in your enterprise.
Committees
A committee is a body of two or more people from a larger group or enter-
prise, formed to carry out a special, often temporary service. Typical com-
mittees include decorating, welcoming, nominating, planning, and organizing 
committees. In some enterprises, committees may be called groups.
In practice, some administrators — the people who usually set up committees — 
establish ones that are much like task forces in scope and specialization. 
However, committees are generally unlikely to be intentionally stocked with 
experts chosen for their varying points of view, whose flexibility and mobility 
are vital for the success of the unit. Some committees acquire a degree of per-
manence that’s characteristic of bureaucratic departments and divisions.
Committees are handy little groups. They’re comparatively easy to establish 
and disband, easy to add members to or take members from, and capable of 
giving some people in your enterprise a special identity and valued sense of 
participation in your mission.
Assignments
An assignment is a directive given to an individual member of a social enter-
prise to complete a special informational task or offer a temporary service. 
The person agrees to do something that may, in other circumstances, be 
assigned to a task force or a committee. When the enterprise is small, and 
only a handful of people are available to help with its operations, assign-
ments become a useful alternative to expanding the bureaucracy.
Assignments are also useful when a member shows exceptional talent, apti-
tude, or training relative to the subject of the assignment. For example, some-
one in your organization may have the talent and skills necessary to set up 
a Web site for the enterprise. By assigning the task to her, you avoid hiring 
someone permanently. Of course, a Web site has to be maintained, and when 
the assignment is finished, the person assigned to it usually goes back to her 
old job. But at least it’s up and running, and you may decide an intern or vol-
unteer is sufficient to keep the site up to date.

219
 Chapter 13: Keeping Kafka at Bay: Dealing with Bureaucracy
Co-options
A co-option is a process whereby one or more outsiders are invited into a 
social enterprise to perform a specified task. Like the other examples of 
adhocracy, a co-option is a temporary arrangement. Many organizations 
co-opt an expert to give the group needed information or guidance on, 
for example, how to conduct a publicity campaign, approach foundations 
for funding, invest wisely, manage volunteers, or deal with government. A 
co-opted expert is like a consultant. Co-optees are sometimes said to be 
“absorbed” into an enterprise, albeit only temporarily.
Though co-opted experts rarely have voting rights in a social enterprise, they 
often do get to know in considerable depth how it works.
Co-option often carries no pay — it’s a charitable, pro bono service provided by 
the expert — though enterprises with some cash may try to hire their advice.
 
Sometimes an alternative arrangement turns out to work so well that it 
becomes permanent. But keeping in mind the specter of fat bureaucracy, you 
should closely examine any transformation of that sort using the principles 
mentioned in the “Avoiding the Tendency to Over-Bureaucratize” section, 
earlier in this chapter. In other words, don’t let alternatives sneak in the back 
door to become (unexamined) additions. If they are to become additions, let 
them properly earn their new organizational status.
Dealing with External Bureaucracy
Most social enterprises must deal with one or more external bureaucracies. Any 
entrepreneur who wants to influence a governmental entity, for example — be 
it local, national, or international — must work through the bureaucracy and 
line workers who administer and carry out his organization’s mission, goals, and 
policy. The same goes for dealing with foundations, businesses, granting agen-
cies, other nonprofit organizations, religious groups, and similar entities.
So, bureaucracy gets you coming and going.
To succeed, you need to learn about and live with the workings of external 
bureaucracies. They may be exasperating at times. You may face excessive 
procedures, regulations, and operational positions. You may begin to think 
they were intentionally created to make life difficult for social entrepreneurs. 
The same bureaucratic problems you’re trying to avoid may have already 
consumed those you’re dealing with.

220
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
Dealing with external bureaucracies is an area of entrepreneurial life where 
perseverance (see Chapter 3) is very much in demand. You can’t reach your 
mission by railing against established institutions and their bureaucracies. 
These giants are very difficult to change.
In the short run, to get what you want from external bureaucracies, you have 
to find out how they work and learn how to cut red tape. Doing that often 
requires careful study and could make a worthy assignment for a willing 
colleague who shows talent and aptitude for it. Tap the experience of other 
people already familiar with the peculiarities of the bureaucracy in question. 
Getting to know personally some of the key bureaucrats involved is another 
way of expediting your interests — and face-to-face contact is the ideal way.
Governmental bureaucracy
Governmental bureaucracies have certain unique features that are relevant for 
social enterprises. For one thing, politicians must answer to those who elect 
them (in democracies, anyway) — and the bureaucratic units for which the 
politicians are ultimately responsible have to answer to the electorate, too.
Let’s say a governmental department honors a request from a social entre-
preneur to change a certain procedure, but then people affected by the 
change complain to their elected representatives. What happens? The 
change may ultimately be reversed. When you’re working through govern-
mental bureaucracies, you have to try to predict how your proposals will be 
received by the larger population.
Proposals unpopular in the larger community may eventually fail, even if they 
temporarily succeed at the administrative level. A good example would be 
the prohibition of alcohol in the early 20th century. At first the Temperance 
Movement — something akin to a social enterprise and the prime mover 
behind the legal change — was successful in enacting a constitutional amend-
ment banning liquor. However, the amendment was eventually repealed 
because it was unworkable and caused a backlash among the public.
 
When working with governments, you have to think ahead , because they may 
change their minds.
Governments, unlike some corporations, do not commonly have a special 
bureaucratic unit whose mission is to provide money or services to social 
causes. Government aid is spread out through numerous departments and 
agencies. (In Chapter 9, we discuss the special challenge of seeking govern-
ment help for your enterprise.)

221
 Chapter 13: Keeping Kafka at Bay: Dealing with Bureaucracy
 
Some social entrepreneurial causes, when faced with stubborn governmental 
authorities, have resorted to civil disobedience tactics, such as marches and 
sit-ins. Civil disobedience is active but nonviolent refusal to abide by particular 
laws, requirements, or orders set out by a government, whether the legitimate 
government of the country or that of an occupying power. It is one of the cen-
tral tactics used in nonviolent resistance. Mohandas Gandhi used civil disobe-
dience to help change the attitude of the British governmental bureaucracy 
toward his campaign to win the independence of India.
Corporate bureaucracy
You may face a corporate bureaucracy if you’re trying to get the corporation 
to change how it operates. For example, maybe you’re trying to persuade an 
industry to reduce air or water pollution. In this case, your best bet is usually 
to avoid the corporate bureaucracy entirely and schedule a personal visit 
with the leaders of the corporation. You may also need to organize a public 
pressure campaign, possibly using media sources (see Chapter 12), influen-
tial politicians or other public figures, leaflets and flyers, and the like.
 
Civil disobedience may be the last recourse against a stubborn corporation. 
For example, protesters against logging companies that clear-cut large sec-
tions of forest have sometimes taken up temporary residence in selected 
trees as a way of preventing them from being cut down. Earth First, a radical 
social enterprise, has used, among other tactics, this form of civil disobedi-
ence. Operation Rescue, a pro-life Christian activist organization, occasionally 
engages in civil disobedience to discourage and even block access to clinics 
where abortions are performed. And Greenpeace has used nonviolent tactics 
in its attempts to bring an end to seal hunting and whaling.

I
n Chapter 13, we touch on the subjects of formally organizing a social 
enterprise and going corporate. This chapter is where we present the ins 
and outs and pros and cons of these potential transformations of your enter-
prise. Formal organization and incorporation are quite involved undertakings 
with far-reaching consequences. But a formal organization and a corporation 
are two very different things. And your social enterprise might not even be 
a formal organization yet. In this chapter, we sort all this out and help you 
decide which path is right for you.
Forming a Group: Formal or Informal
Forming a social enterprise is really about forming a group, which is just two 
or more people who share at least one goal, have a sense of common iden-
tity, and are organized around a set of rules and roles. A two- or three-person 
social enterprise, if it meets these criteria, would qualify as a group.

224
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
Groups can be formal or informal. According to David Horton Smith, an 
expert on nonprofit organizations and the nonprofit sector, a formal group is 
one that has
 
✓ A proper and unique name: The carefully chosen name publicly identi-
fies the group.
 
✓ Clear membership boundaries: These boundaries outline who the mem-
bers are or how large the group can be. The members are those people 
who regularly provide services that help meet the group’s goals.
 
✓ A clear leadership structure: This structure is how the group makes 
binding group decisions.
 
Eduardo Fritis’s family exemplifies an informal social enterprise. As reported in 
the Calgary Herald, Fritis, his wife, and his 19-year-old son plan to sail through-
out the Pacific handing out shoes, clothes, and eyeglasses to children living in 
poverty. He calls his enterprise Shoes for the World. The idea came to him after 
he saw a photograph of a happy boy showing off the first pair of shoes he ever 
owned. Fritis has sold nearly all his possessions to finance this humanitarian 
voyage. At the time of this writing, he plans to set sail over the next two years 
to Mexico, South America, French Polynesia, and elsewhere in the South Pacific. 
His enterprise does have a unique name and clear membership boundaries, but 
it lacks a clear leadership structure, so the group is informal.
Many social enterprises are no more formally organized than Fritis’s. Indeed, 
he and his family might not even think of themselves in social entrepre-
neurial terms. They just want to mobilize themselves and distribute certain 
humanitarian necessities to children in need.
Consider another example, this time a formal group, but unincorporated. It, 
too, fits our definition of a social enterprise.
 
The Emeritus Association of the University of Calgary was founded in 1992 
to serve its members, the university, and the public. Its objective is to be a 
vehicle that brings together emeriti for the betterment of the membership and 
their families, and to foster ways for its members to contribute to the life of 
the university and the larger community. This group has both a constitution 
and a set of bylaws, annually elects a slate of officers, holds an annual general 
meeting, collects dues each year, and has many other attributes of a formal 
group. But it isn’t incorporated, even though it has successfully operated for 
17 years as a lively outlet for the interests and concerns of former university 
faculty and administration.
These two examples show that you can solve problems and achieve social 
change, even if your enterprise remains unincorporated.
So, should you turn your social enterprise into a corporation? To answer this 
question, first you have to know what a corporation is.

225
 Chapter 14: Going Corporate: Formally Organizing and Incorporating
Introducing Corporations: 
Nonprofit versus For-Profit
A corporation is a formal organization with a charter (a written document 
that creates an organizational entity such as a nonprofit group or a for-profit 
company). A nonprofit corporation may also have a governmental tax-exempt 
status — which means that the corporation doesn’t have to pay federal and 
state or provincial taxes on money left after all expenses have been met.
All types of corporations are legally established entities within political juris-
dictions such as a state, province, or national government. The key differ-
ence separating a nonprofit corporation from a for-profit corporation is that 
distribution of profits gained by nonprofit corporations to members of those 
corporations is prohibited. Instead of being paid out, profits must be retained 
by nonprofit corporations and used strictly for financing further production 
of the services that the group was founded to provide.
The nonprofit may use its profits to hire paid staff (see Chapter 13). These 
people are not members of the organization — they’re employees. (Members 
of a nonprofit are the people responsible for directing the organization — the 
board of directors or trustees — and other volunteers, who may not be paid 
by it; see Chapter 8.) Otherwise, nonprofit corporations are similar to for-
profit corporations.
 
There are four main types of corporations:
 
✓ Nonprofit corporations: These corporations are unable to distribute 
profits to members — that is, to its directors (see “Identifying and 
recruiting directors and trustees,” later in this chapter). They can earn 
money; they just have to reinvest it back into the organization. But 
employees of the nonprofit are paid, just as are employees of busi-
nesses, but then they are not members of the corporation.
 
✓ General corporations: This is the most common corporate structure. The 
general corporation is a separate legal entity owned by stockholders, who 
are protected from the creditors of the business. A stockholder’s personal 
liability is usually limited to the amount the person has invested in the 
corporation. General corporations are large-scale organizations.
 
✓ Close corporation: The close corporation tends to be limited to, say, 30 
to 50 stockholders. The close corporation is well suited for one or more 
owners of a small corporation, usually a small business, only some of 
whom will actively manage it.
 
✓ Limited liability company: In this type of corporation, the owners’ per-
sonal assets are protected from the corporation’s liability for business 
debts. The owners may also benefit from the tax advantages of corpo-
rate partnerships.

226
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
 
Very recently a hybrid of the nonprofit and for-profit corporation has been 
created in certain states: the low-profit, limited-liability company (L3C). The 
L3C is designed for for-profits with a social purpose — groups for which profit 
is a secondary goal. Profits can be distributed to shareholders, but L3Cs pay 
income taxes, and contributions to them are not tax deductible.
Weighing the Pros and Cons 
of Incorporation
We can’t tell you whether to incorporate. But we can fill you in on the pros 
and cons, so that you know your options. Your decision will depend on a 
variety of conditions, including the nature of governmental regulations on 
incorporation, the need for external funding, the amount of help you can 
expect from other leaders, and the necessity of insuring against risk faced by 
members working in service of the enterprise’s mission. Your personal pref-
erences will also enter into your decision.
 
If, after reading this section, you want still more information about the pros 
and cons of incorporation, visit the Web site of Score, Counselors to America’s 
Small Business (www.score.org). And don’t forget the Internal Revenue 
Service (www.irs.gov), which offers many details on incorporation for chari-
ties that will also help you decide for or against taking this step.
What people mean when they talk 
about legal and charitable status
The legal status of a nonprofit social enterprise 
refers to whether it is formally incorporated 
within a state, province, nation, or other gov-
ernmental jurisdiction. In the case of nonprof-
its, legal status may also refer to whether the 
enterprise is formally tax-exempt. Paid-staff 
nonprofits are nearly always incorporated and 
tax-exempt, whereas many grass-roots associ-
ations are not incorporated and, therefore, not 
officially tax-exempt. Small grassroots orga-
nizations are usually “informally tax-exempt,” 
however — they generate little money and 
don’t always report to the tax authorities any 
money they do generate.
If your social enterprise is incorporated, it may 
apply to government for formal exemption from 
taxation and thereby be recognized as a chari-
table group, or charity. A charity is formally 
organized, provides one or more public benefits 
(as opposed to member benefits), and receives 
a significant amount of its revenue from dona-
tions. Charities are also legally empowered to 
issue official statements to donors verifying the 
amount they gave to them. This is a substantial 
incentive for many potential donors, because 
they can claim a tax deduction against the 
amount they’ve given.

227
 Chapter 14: Going Corporate: Formally Organizing and Incorporating
The pros
The main advantage of incorporating is that doing so usually makes it easier 
to bring in money. Only incorporated social enterprises
 
✓ Are eligible for official charitable status (but only if they’re nonprofit).
 
✓ Are eligible for special advantageous tax rates, if they’re taxable at all.
 
✓ May invest in venture philanthropy (see Chapter 8).
A brief history of the corporation
According to Lee Drutman, an expert on the 
history of the corporation, the origin of the 
modern form may be traced to 1601. This was 
when Queen Elizabeth I established the East 
India Trading Company. At the time, the idea of 
the corporation bore little resemblance to the 
modern conception. The typical corporation 
was linked with the British government, which 
granted it a charter to undertake a particular 
project. The goal was to attract investors eager 
to finance large commercial projects, many of 
them involving geographic exploration.
Drutman says that in post-revolutionary 
America, corporations continued to be small 
organizations commonly chartered by one of 
the states for pursuing particular projects. They 
operated in such relatively restricted areas as 
banking and seafaring. They had a limited life, 
could make no political contributions, and 
couldn’t hold stock in other companies. Their 
owners were responsible for any criminal 
acts committed by the owners or employees 
when working in the name of the corpora-
tion. Moreover, there was no principle of lim-
ited liability, which states that investors are 
exempted from any responsibility for harm and 
loss brought about by their corporation.
There have been many changes since then, 
leading to the present day, in which the cor-
poration has become an ascendant institution 
in many modern societies. Nowadays we’re 
highly dependent on the products and services 
the corporation typically provides. Many corpo-
rations, using advertising, public relations, and 
the mass media, have the capacity to influence 
the ways we see the world and each other. 
We often entrust our finances and healthcare 
to corporations, and they’re often a central 
link in our communication with other people. 
What’s more, most people work for a corpora-
tion. In some countries — mostly in the West — 
corporations greatly influence the legislative 
process, sometimes more than any branch of 
government. These days they’re the source of 
many of our essential services such as water 
and electricity. In the United States, corpora-
tions have constitutional rights, can be of unlim-
ited size, and can live forever.
Informal social enterprises have undoubtedly 
existed since mankind first faced social prob-
lems, and someone took the initiative to solve 
them — with or without someone else’s help. 
But formal incorporation could have been pos-
sible only with development of the arrange-
ments just described. Thus, in 1869, Florence 
Nightingale, with Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, was 
able to open the Women’s Medical College, an 
incorporated entity. This was the world’s first 
school of nursing.

✓ Are eligible to receive donations from either traditional or venture-
philanthropic foundations (see Chapter 8).
 
✓ May enter into partnerships with private companies for the purpose of 
creating profit and social value.
 
✓ May issue shares to members who buy them at a specified rate. This 
arrangement gives the enterprise needed cash with which to operate.
 
✓ Can enter into legal contracts and other long-term agreements with 
other organizations.
 
✓ Are eligible for full banking privileges.
 
✓ May own real property.
 
✓ May insure members against the risks that may be incurred while work-
ing for the enterprise.
 
✓ Can protect their officials against having to use their personal posses-
sions to pay off the debts of the enterprise in the event of liquidation.
 
✓ Can protect their individual members against lawsuits lodged against 
the organization.
 
✓ Can ensure that all members have, in the event of liquidation, equal 
access to the proceeds from the sale of all organizational assets.
You can see from this list — which is just a sample of the advantages of 
incorporating — that if you’re the leader of a large-scale social enterprise, 
you probably do want to incorporate. Your organization’s visibility, scope 
of operations, size of membership, financial needs, and other attributes are 
likely pushing your toward becoming a corporation.
 
Many of the advantages of incorporation have to do with particular legal 
conditions, which vary from state to state. For this reason, you should seek 
professional advice to ensure that you properly navigate the inevitable maze 
of rules and regulations that will come to bear on your social enterprise in 
the state where you live. The terrain is legal, but good advice and much of the 
paperwork need not necessarily come through a lawyer. (We come back to 
this subject in the “Incorporating Your Social Enterprise” section, later in this 
chapter.)
The cons
For some social enterprises, many, if not all, of the advantages listed in the pre-
ceding section don’t have much appeal. These organizations have no money 
to invest, no interest in pursuing profit, and no assets of any significance to 

229
 Chapter 14: Going Corporate: Formally Organizing and Incorporating
liquidate. Sure, they’d be thrilled if a foundation gave them a hefty donation, 
but maybe not at the expense of the time it would take to do the paperwork 
that accompanies such largesse. Some social enterprises may also have an 
aversion to some or all of the conditions restricting use of the money they 
receive when they’re incorporated.
 
Many social entrepreneurs can recite a litany of the disadvantages of incorpo-
ration. Here are some examples:
 
✓ Incorporation requires considerable initial legal paperwork as well as 
more of the same over the lifetime of the corporation. This requirement 
cuts into time that could be devoted to realizing the enterprise’s mission.
 
✓ There are often legal restrictions on the activities legally established 
charitable organizations may engage in. In general, their activities must 
relate to the basis on which they’ve been incorporated as a charity.
 
✓ With incorporation, the enterprise may tend to become too big and too 
bureaucratic. As a result, many of participants may be alienated from its 
mission. (See Chapter 13 for more on the perils of bureaucracy.)
 
✓ Incorporation, because of additional responsibilities toward government 
and members of the enterprise, often requires hiring special full- or part-
time personnel to do such things as the accounting and examining and 
establishing various legal arrangements.
 
✓ In some countries, incorporated groups can be held liable for certain 
risks such as medical risks of members carrying out the mission, a kind 
of liability that unincorporated groups escape. Of course, the risks are 
there for unincorporated groups, but they would be, in this situation, 
borne by individual members who may be required to sign waivers free-
ing the enterprise from such responsibility. Note, too, that U.S. corpora-
tions operating in foreign countries must abide by the laws regulating 
these risks that have been established in those countries.
 
✓ Incorporation often calls for formalizing certain operating procedures. 
For example, meetings may have to be run using, say, Robert’s Rules of 
Order, and it may be required that minutes be taken. In formal proce-
dures, these minutes are subject to approval and official signature at the 
next official gathering of the group.
 
✓ Incorporation for nonprofits requires that a board of directors or trust-
ees be established, and, in the case of for-profit enterprises, this may 
necessitate recruiting a group of shareholders.
 
✓ Incorporation may set in motion forces that eventually stifle your inge-
nuity and drive. It can lead to increased bureaucratization of your efforts 
to manage and sustain.

Part III: Growing Your Organization 
Incorporating Your Social Enterprise
Incorporation is a series of steps. First up is the process of registering the 
name of your enterprise. Then you have the matter of identifying its direc-
tors, or trustees. After that, you have to consider your enterprise’s constitu-
tion or, if a for-profit group, its articles of incorporation. Finally, your social 
enterprise will need bylaws.
 
Of course, we can’t in one chapter tell you everything you need to know to 
incorporate your social enterprise. If you want to go further in your research, 
we recommend Incorporating Your Business For Dummies, by The Company 
Corporation (Wiley), as well as Anthony Mancuso’s How to Form a Nonprofit 
Corporation (NOLO Press).
Registering your enterprise’s name
The process of incorporation begins with choosing a name (discussed in 
detail in Chapter 10) and then doing the paperwork to legally establish 
the name you’ve selected. Although the paperwork of incorporation can 
be annoying, choosing a name is usually very much the opposite. You and 
others close to you can have a great time brainstorming over the best pos-
sible designation for your enterprise.
You need to choose a name that’s not the same as, or even similar to, the 
other legal names on file with the governmental office where you’re register-
ing. Most governments require you to follow their formal procedure for deter-
mining whether your proposed name is sufficiently distinctive.
 
If your proposed name is similar to the name of another organization, and you 
still want to use it, the government will probably require you to get formal 
assurance from the other organization that it won’t challenge your proposal. If 
you don’t follow this advice, you may face all kinds of legal repercussions.
 
A good place to start your name search is by searching your state govern-
ment’s Web site for the branch that deals with corporate registration. 
Instructions for corporate registration are likely available online at the Web 
site of the state office dealing with incorporation. You can find this office by 
Googling “incorporating in the name of your state.”
If you’re setting up a for-profit social enterprise, you’ll also have to decide on 
the kind of for-profit legal entity it will be. Will it be a nonprofit corporation, a 
general corporation, a close corporation, or a limited liability company (see 
“Introducing Corporations: Nonprofit versus For-Profit,” earlier in this chap-
ter)? Will it be, for example, XYZ Incorporated or XYZ Limited?

231
 Chapter 14: Going Corporate: Formally Organizing and Incorporating
The typical procedure is to send your chosen name to the appropriate 
governmental office in the state in which you intend to incorporate your 
enterprise, which will then check its database of all corporations within its 
jurisdiction. If there are no red flags — no identical or similar names in the 
jurisdiction — you’ll be free to seek incorporation under your proposed 
name. If the government office sends you a list of names identical and similar 
to the one you’ve proposed, you’ll have to go back to the drawing board.
 
There may be a time limit on how long you have to submit another choice; if 
you go beyond it, you’ll have to reapply.
Identifying and recruiting 
directors and trustees
We use the terms director and trustee interchangeably to refer to the mem-
bers of a board of directors or board of trustees. These are the people who 
set organizational goals and policies, see to financial need, establish budgets, 
and report on the organization to its stakeholders, among other functions. 
The number of directors/trustees required for an incorporated nonprofit 
social enterprise varies somewhat by political jurisdiction: Some require only 
one; others require two, three, or four. Whatever the number of directors 
required, that number will have to be stated either in your constitution or in 
your bylaws (keep reading to find out about these).
Though you aren’t obligated to be a director, you probably want to be one. 
After all, the directors in an organization have the greatest power in it — 
especially the president. Only as a director can you participate in the pro-
cesses discussed in the preceding paragraph. If you’re required to have other 
directors, it’s up to you to find people who are passionate about the mission 
of your enterprise and can give the time needed to help realize it.
 
Finding directors/trustees may prove to be difficult. Start by checking with the 
appropriate governmental office to see whether it stipulates that a specified 
number of directors must be centrally interested in the mission. The regula-
tions may allow for one or more directors whose role is only to serve as volun-
teers to help run the organization on a routine basis, and who don’t also have 
to meet the requirement of being passionate about its goals.
A good director will be as passionate as anyone on the board about the goals 
and mission of your enterprise. Ideally, a director will also have had experi-
ence on other boards and show a capacity for working with others on the 
board. In the democratic give-and-take at board meetings, patience is often a 
virtue. Plus, a good director is seldom absent from board meetings, arrives 
on time at each one, and doesn’t leave early.

232
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
Directors may also have to meet a residency requirement, such as a specified 
proportion of the board must live within the jurisdiction of the governmental 
office. There may also be an age requirement as well as rules about whether 
close relatives of directors may join their ranks. Finally, in for-profits, rules 
may exist about people who get paid for services rendered to the enterprise 
and whether they may also be directors. That such people do get paid for 
services is, however, an uncommon arrangement. If they’re allowed, there 
may be an additional regulation stating the proportion of paid personnel who 
may serve on a board of directors.
 
Knowing in advance about all contingencies is a good idea. It would be awk-
ward if, in your enthusiasm for incorporating your enterprise, you invited 
someone to be a director only to find out later that the governmental office 
didn’t allow that category of person to participate. Again, you’ll find much of 
the information you need on the Web site for your appropriate state govern-
mental office.
Research in nonprofit studies has revealed three common approaches to 
recruiting directors to the boards of nonprofit organizations. One conclusion 
from these studies is that some form of democracy is the best way to choose 
a new director, even though other methods can also be effective. The fol-
lowing are all democratic approaches because directors in nonprofit boards 
must, by constitutional fiat, either eventually stand for election at an annual 
general meeting (discussed later in this chapter) or, more immediately, be 
approved by a vote by the board itself.
 
✓ The active approach: You advertise for your directors, choosing the 
best from among the candidates who present themselves. You might do 
this, for example, in your monthly bulletin, on your Web site, in the bul-
letins of kindred organizations, or in local print media.
 
✓ The passive approach: You wait for suitable candidates to emerge by 
whatever route is available (for example, they offer their candidacy to 
you or to a member of your enterprise).
 
✓ The co-option approach: You may want to co-opt one or more people 
you’re convinced will make fine directors. In other words, you and your 
board members invite such people to join the board, commonly with 
the provision that, at the next annual general meeting or board meeting, 
they have to be voted in.
Which method you choose may depend on advertising costs, how much 
time you have, the urgency of filling the post, and the availability of suitable 
candidates.
Except where governmental regulations allow otherwise, the board of direc-
tors of your social enterprise must be staffed with people who are highly 
dedicated to its mission. These people must also be clear of any personal 
conflict of interest with that mission. You may also want to have members on 
the board who are also members of the target of benefits.

233
 Chapter 14: Going Corporate: Formally Organizing and Incorporating
 
For enterprises that serve a membership group, such as a profession or a 
trade union, board members are usually elected from among the larger mem-
bership for a limited term. In this case, directors, by dint of their voluntary 
involvement with the enterprise, automatically espouse its goals and mission.
Many people who volunteer their time for a social enterprise do so with a 
commercial interest — although the work may be personally fulfilling, they 
also enjoy the networking and résumé benefits of being on the board. This is 
not a problem unless it hampers the operation of the organization. For exam-
ple, a board member may push for the organization to hire a company to per-
form a service that the board member would stand to financially gain from.
 
Don’t allow members on boards who have commercial interests in your enter-
prise or other personal goals that are incompatible with or marginal to it. Do 
your research and vet your candidates thoroughly. For example, you might 
think it’s a good idea to recruit John Doe to your board, until a member of the 
board observes that, some years back, Doe started an organization whose mis-
sion clashes with yours.
 
Staffing boards of directors in social enterprises and other nonprofit groups 
remains a difficult endeavor. You’re probably caught up with the details of 
reaching your mission and goals, so you may find yourself giving short shrift 
to recruiting members to your board of directors. Even when you find people, 
you may be slack about educating them so that they participate in the board 
effectively. You should always be looking to build and identify potentially 
good board members. Set aside considerable time to find your candidates and 
fill them in on what’s required. You’ll be glad you did.
Drafting your constitution
We use the term constitution to refer to the body of written rules prescribing 
the major elements of the structure of an organization and its principal activi-
ties, either for nonprofit or for-profit groups. (In your readings and discus-
sions you may occasionally run into other terms. Sometimes the term articles 
of organization is used to refer to the constitutions of incorporated nonprofit 
groups, whereas articles of incorporation is reserved for the constitutions of 
incorporated for-profit groups.) A constitution is a democratic document that 
defines and protects the rights of members of the collectivity, whether it be a 
country, corporation, or social enterprise.
 
In your readings and discussions, you may occasionally run into other terms. 
Sometimes articles of organization is used to refer to the constitutions of incor-
porated nonprofit groups, whereas articles of incorporation is reserved for the 
constitutions of incorporated for-profit groups.

234
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
What do corporate constitutions typically contain? The following list of 
articles will suffice in most cases, though you may certainly add others you 
believe are necessary (for example, a clause about signing authority for checks, 
procedures for grant applications, or a clause about non-remuneration of 
volunteer members). The main idea in forming the constitution of a nonprofit 
is to establish its identity and basic operating procedures using principles 
that are unlikely to change. Changing your constitution (depending on its 
clauses pertaining to changing it) may be done through a formal amendment 
procedure, which is unwieldy and may provoke dissent, or done through a 
formal vote during a board meeting.
Your constitution should cover the items in the following sections.
Name
Be sure to include any official acronym designating your enterprise’s name, 
the official shortened versions of the name, and, with for-profits, the legal 
commercial designation (such as Ltd., Co., and Inc.). For more information on 
choosing your name, see “Registering your enterprise’s name,” earlier in this 
chapter, as well as Chapter 10.
Mission statement
The mission statement proclaims the purpose of your enterprise — in other 
words, what you’re doing for your target of benefits. (See Chapter 7 for more 
information.)
 
Mission orientation is the basic distinguishing characteristic of nonprofit groups.
Goals or objectives
Goals and objectives are what your enterprise is trying to achieve by follow-
ing its mission. In social entrepreneurship, the goal is generally to change 
society to benefit a human, animal, or environmental target.
Membership
Here you define who may become a member of your social enterprise. That 
person could simply be anyone who pays the annual dues, with the amount 
set out in the bylaws. But you may also want to specify additional criteria 
such as age, commitment to your goals, and other identifiers related to your 
mission. But be sure that your country or state does not prohibit exclud-
ing people based on the criteria you choose. For example, if your enterprise 
centers on women helping women, then you may want to limit member-
ship to women — just make sure such exclusion is legal. If it organizes 
people against crime in a certain neighborhood, then membership might be 
restricted to those who live there.
In addition, you may want to consider a category of lifetime membership (cri-
teria and dues to be set out in the bylaws). Finally, you may want to allow 

235
 Chapter 14: Going Corporate: Formally Organizing and Incorporating
for honorary members (who would pay no dues) and corporate members 
(who would pay dues, sometimes quite substantial). You can set out in your 
bylaws whether honorary and corporate members will have the right to vote
Officers
An officer in the nonprofit sector is someone who holds an office and, by dint 
of that position, participates in the management or direction of a nonprofit 
group. Here are the most common officers of such groups and their minimum 
responsibilities:
 
✓ President: The president sets the agendas for and presides at meetings 
of the board and those of the executive committee, oversees all board 
functions as well as the responsibilities of the executive director (if 
there is one), and may be the person who represents the organization to 
the outside world.
 
✓ Secretary: The secretary takes notes at board and executive committee 
meetings and writes them up as minutes for approval of the board.
 
✓ Treasurer: The treasurer monitors the flow of money in and out of the 
organization, keeps books related to these processes, and works with an 
accountant to prepare the annual audited financial report. In small orga-
nizations, the posts of secretary and treasurer are sometimes filled by 
the same person.
Some nonprofits and social enterprises name a vice president, and some 
don’t. Even if you see no need for this position when framing your constitu-
tion, we still recommend that you include it there. A vice president, apart 
from substituting for the president (which might happen only rarely), is also 
a director as well as part of the executive committee (see later in this list). 
In some organizations, the vice president, after serving a specified term, will 
become the president and then, possibly, the past president.
Once your organization is up and running, all officers are elected, whether by 
the membership as a whole or by a committee elected by the membership. 
Still, organizations starting out don’t have a membership, so the founders 
must appoint the initial board.
Board of directors/trustees
The board of directors, or board of trustees, consists of the officers of the 
enterprise along with a specified number of other members. Everyone on this 
committee is a director or trustee. In many nonprofit groups, the board is the 
highest policymaking and administrative unit.
 
Experts in nonprofit research consider boards of directors to be central to 
nonprofit effectiveness. Nonetheless, expanded boards tend to be unwieldy in 
small enterprises, which can usually be managed by a handful of officers.

236
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
Directors at large — members who are not officers — are also commonly sub-
ject to election in the same way as the officers.
Every constitution should contain a clause for provisionally appointing direc-
tors when a vacancy occurs mid-term, a process usually carried out by the 
board itself. Appointed directors are then officially accepted or rejected by 
an election held at the next annual general meeting.
Executive committee
Your enterprise’s executive committee is a subcommittee of your board 
of directors. The typical executive committee is composed of the officers: 
the president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer. It acts between 
board meetings, being charged with implementing policy set by the board. 
Executive committees are common, especially in large boards of directors 
(those with 15 or more members).
Fiscal year
The fiscal year is your enterprise’s financial year. By and large, modern gov-
ernments and organizations conduct their financial business according to 
fiscal years. As soon as you have a budget, you need to account to members 
and funders for the ways it’s spent. That accounting is commonly reckoned 
according to the fixed 12-month period.
You may want your fiscal year to coincide with that of the federal govern-
ment, from whom you may receive some funding — in the United States the 
fiscal year runs from October 1 through September 30 the next year. Or you 
may find it more convenient to set year fiscal year with the calendar, starting 
in January. Maybe it makes sense to harmonize it with that of your principal 
corporate or foundational source of funding. In short, determining your fiscal 
year should be carefully thought out.
Annual general meeting
Holding an annual general meeting (AGM) to which all members are invited is 
traditional. Constitutions usually specify the month in which such a meeting 
must occur, which tends to be coordinated with the group’s fiscal year. The 
AGM is where
 
✓ Officers and other directors stand for election.
 
✓ Treasurers make their reports.
 
✓ Members may question all their directors on matters of financial concern.
 
✓ Chairs of committees (set out in the bylaws) report on what they’ve 
accomplished since the previous AGM.

237
 Chapter 14: Going Corporate: Formally Organizing and Incorporating
Amendment procedures
Constitutions are supposed to have a sort of permanency about them. But 
the world changes, members of the enterprise develop new perspectives, and 
as a result, constitutions must occasionally be modified. You may need to 
add a director to the board, change the fiscal year, or redefine membership 
criteria. Typically, in nonprofit groups, the board of directors develops pro-
posals for such changes. These proposals are then presented to the member-
ship for their ratification at the next AGM.
Constitutions must also allow for proposals for amendments that emanate 
from the general membership. Such a clause serves as an additional demo-
cratic check on the board. If the amendments are ratified, the constitution is 
then rewritten accordingly.
Because your constitution contains your legal articles of incorporation, 
changes made to it through amendments must ordinarily be filed with the 
governmental agency enabling your incorporation. The steps to be followed 
for doing this are usually available on the Internet, though you’ll have to send 
in signed paper copies of the changes.
Laying down the bylaws
A bylaw is a rule created for and adopted by a nonprofit group, primarily 
for governance of its members and regulation of its routine affairs. A set of 
bylaws consists of all the formal internal rules and procedures for operating 
and governing a nonprofit corporation.
 
In some governmental jurisdictions, a set of bylaws is known as a code of regulations.
There are no set criteria for bylaw content. Nevertheless, the Citizens Media 
Law Project (www.citmedialaw.org) has set out some general areas of 
nonprofit life where bylaws are commonly written:
 
✓ Responsibilities of nonprofit corporate officers and directors
 
✓ Board size and how they’re elected
 
✓ The timing and methods of board meetings
 
✓ Methods of functioning for the board of directors
 
✓ Distribution of grant monies
Drafting bylaws can be a complicated and, hence, intimidating undertaking. But 
strategies exist for writing satisfactory bylaws without need to hire a lawyer. 
We recommend Anthony Mancuso’s book How to Form a Nonprofit Corporation 
(NOLO Press). Mancuso, a lawyer, guides you through the process of creating 
bylaws appropriate to nonprofits, including nonprofit social enterprises.

238
Part III: Growing Your Organization 
Unlike constitutional amendments, changes in an organization’s bylaws don’t 
have to be filed with any governmental agency, so bylaws are much more easily 
changed than constitutions are. Still, you have to keep a record of your origi-
nal bylaws and all changes you make to them. In the United States, the people 
responsible for incorporating a nonprofit and/or its initial directors (if named in 
the articles of incorporation) typically have the authority to set and adopt that 
group’s original bylaws at its initial organizational meeting. Though not a legal 
requirement, some organizations require that this original document be ratified 
at the first AGM (see the preceding section for more on AGMs).
Sets of bylaws are typically quite lengthy, as well as highly detailed and 
specific. You can find samples of them on the Internet. We recommend that 
you start by visiting the Web site of the Foundation Center at http://
foundationcenter.org/getstarted/faqs/html/samplebylaws.
html, which features links to several samples. Additionally, you can use your 
favorite search engine to search for “sample nonprofit bylaws.” Keep in mind 
that bylaws are, of necessity, highly particular documents, setting out rules 
and procedures peculiar to the organization to which they pertain.
Cutting through the red tape
You may feel that all this detail about constitu-
tions and bylaws is leading to a life of red tape 
and the need to adhere excessively to bureau-
cratic procedures and formalities. Plus, don’t 
we argue in Chapter 13 that you should avoid 
over-bureaucratization and bureaucratic bloat? 
Aren’t we contradicting ourselves in promoting 
the need for a constitution and set of bylaws for 
your social enterprise?
Over-bureaucratization comes from adding 
more organizational functions than required 
or more people to carry them out than needed. 
Creating a constitution and a complemen-
tary set of bylaws is in no way excessive or 
superfluous. Instead they serve as the very 
organizational foundation of your nonprofit. 
Constitutions and bylaws also help ensure that 
your enterprise functions democratically.
Nonetheless, bits of over-bureaucratization 
might creep into the framing of your bylaws 
or the bylaws themselves. Bylaws, among 
other things, regulate routine behavior in the 
organization, and it’s common for the organiza-
tion to try to control member behavior that might 
be harmful to its goals and mission. This could 
happen, for example, when setting the number 
of directors or the number of signatures (usually 
those of directors) required on checks issued 
by the enterprise. The treasurer and president 
normally do the signing, but a third person might 
be appointed as a substitute when one of the 
first two is unavailable. Over-bureaucratization 
may occur when a super-cautious director 
insists on requiring, say, a fourth signature.
Authors of bylaws sometimes want to set more 
rules than necessary for effectively running 
board meetings. The best antidote we know 
of to enacting unnecessary rules or rules that 
are too constraining is for you and board mem-
bers to constantly ask yourselves whether your 
enterprise can do without the rule being con-
sidered. Another way of living by this precau-
tion is to always try to find the simplest way of 
achieving the purpose of the proposed rule.

A 
social enterprise is like any other ongoing endeavor 
— it needs to be nurtured and tended in order to 
survive. This part focuses on the best ways of doing that.
Chapter 15 offers insight into the business end of social

Chapter 16, we explore the concept and application of 
leadership, a key aspect of the success of any organiza-
tion. In Chapter 17, we go over the critical concepts of

Chapter 15
Putting the Entrepreneur in Social 
Entrepreneurship
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out what an entrepreneur is
▶ Discovering what makes social entrepreneurs different
▶ Cultivating pragmatic creativity
W
e may be about to land in hot water with some people. Problems 
sometimes crop up when we try to define the term entrepreneur. 
There’s a very popular misconception that an entrepreneur can only be a 
special form of capitalist, one who tries to set up a new business — or per-
haps save and revive a failing one — with the ultimate goal, of course, of 
pursuing a profit.
We don’t exactly argue with that position — it’s correct as far as it goes. 
We just think it’s insufficient and incomplete, especially for our purposes. 
Business entrepreneurs are certainly one kind of entrepreneur. But they’re 
not the only kind. In this chapter, we tell you our definition of an entrepre-
neur. Then we explain how social entrepreneurs are different from the rest. 
Finally, we cover the important social entrepreneurial principles of creativity 
and pragmatism.
Defining What an Entrepreneur Is
What’s fundamental about entrepreneurs is that they embody and exhibit 
an entrepreneurial mindset or spirit. This mindset can be applied within 
four large domains of human activity — not only to general economic and 
business (that is, for-profit) concerns but also to solving social and cultural 
problems (as is the case with social and political entrepreneurs), contribut-
ing to scientific knowledge, and improving the ways in which information is 
shared across the other domains. These different entrepreneurial domains 
are shown in Figure 15-1.

242
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
 
Figure 15-1: 
The four 
domains of 
entrepre-
neurship.
 
Domains of Entrepreneurial Practice
Scientiﬁc
Entrepreneurship
Information-based
Entrepreneurship
Economic/Business
Entrepreneurship
Social/Cultural
Entrepreneurship
But even more than that, the entrepreneurial mindset can range freely across 
all the domains. You can be mostly a social entrepreneur whose work is pri-
marily nonprofit, while at the same time find ways to generate a profit that 
can sustain your efforts. (We talk about this possibility in Chapter 8.)
Social entrepreneurs may also, for example, find themselves practicing politi-
cal (another form of social/cultural entrepreneurship) and knowledge entre-
preneurship along the way. All these possibilities and more are suggested 
in Figure 15-1. In short, entrepreneurship can express itself widely and cre-
atively in many areas of human activity.
 
A tremendously important example of a hybrid entrepreneur — in this case, 
working across scientific and social/cultural domains — is Dr. Norman 
Borlaug, winner of the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize. Dr. Borlaug is credited with 
saving the lives of at least a billion people. A key figure in the green revolution, 
Borlaug, a microbiologist, worked tirelessly until his death in 2009 to bring the 
world spectacularly successful new strains of high-yielding, disease-resistant 
wheat. Today, revolutionary yields are now harvested in Latin American coun-
tries including Mexico, the Middle East, and Africa, though plenty more places 
could benefit from Dr. Borlaug’s ideas.

243
 Chapter 15: Putting the Entrepreneur in Social Entrepreneurship
Doing more than minding the gap
So, what are the characteristics of an entrepreneurial mindset?
Things start off with a gap between what is and what ought to be — between 
reality and imagination. The world seems out of whack, and not what it 
could or should be. To the entrepreneur, this gap often causes a powerful 
emotional response — sometimes even anxiety and frustration. The solution 
can’t be to simply “mind the gap,” as the British say about stepping between 
a subway car and platform. In the entrepreneur’s view, the gap has to be 
repaired.
You may be thinking, “But isn’t that just discontent? After all, aren’t our lives 
filled with unlimited needs, wants, and desires that we struggle daily to sat-
isfy? We’re hungry, we’re homeless, we’re lonely, we want to have kids, we 
want the joys of family and community, we want spiritual rewards, and on 
and on. . . . And we’re constantly trying to find ways to gratify all these urges. 
So, are we all entrepreneurs then?”
No, and here’s why: Although we all feel the initial discontent that moti-
vates entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs organize to do something about it. 
Entrepreneurs seem to be cut from a different cloth. Many people, if they 
sense that can’t get from Point A (what is) to Point B (what ought to be), 
downgrade their expectations so that getting to somewhere short of Point B 
becomes doable and acceptable.
And that isn’t necessarily a bad move. The problem, of course, is that it 
means settling for less, which isn’t what they really wanted in the first place. 
So they’re still left with a gnawing, half-empty feeling. And that emptiness still 
irritates them and can cause more dissatisfaction.
Identifying the characteristics of 
the entrepreneurial mindset
Entrepreneurs see challenges differently from most folks. Coping has its 
place, but not here and not for them. If a problem is important to them, 
for whatever reasons, entrepreneurs don’t cope. They won’t settle for 
less. Lowering their expectations in order to work with limited ability and 
resources is not an option for entrepreneurs. Instead, entrepreneurs fix 
firmly on their ideals and vision and work on upgrading their own abilities, 
those of others, and the resources around them, in order to repair the gap. 
That’s hard work — the entrepreneur’s vision may be quite lofty, and the 
abilities and resources, at least initially, meager.
But hard work is not a deterrent to entrepreneurs. They stubbornly cling to 
their vision and are resilient and enthusiastic in believing, perhaps beyond

apparent reason, that they can materialize it. They believe they can improve 
themselves and others and marshal the resources they need in order to real-
ize their dreams.
 
When Thomas Edison was working on a prototype of the electric light bulb, 
he remarked after one success, “If it will burn that number of hours [4 1⁄2] now, 
I know I can make it burn 100!” This self-assurance was not really a sudden 
result of his success with that particular bulb. The self-assurance, the convic-
tion, the integrity, all existed long before — even before the electric light bulb 
was nothing more than a glimmer of an idea in a notebook.
In psychological terms, entrepreneurs have a tremendous internal locus of 
control. This means they believe that, in the end, success or failure depends 
on their own efforts. Very simply, they believe in themselves and don’t give 
up at the first sign of trouble.
Entrepreneurs are also simultaneously creative and pragmatic. It can’t be any 
other way. If they’re going to realize their ambitions, they must creatively 
overcome the limitations of their current abilities and resources by rethink-
ing what they have at hand and what they need in order to succeed — and 
they must do so in practical, down-to-earth ways. This stuff is off-road, and 
there are no maps.
 
In a nutshell, the entrepreneurial mindset can be summarized as follows:
 
✓ The sense of a lack between is and ought to be and the motivation to 
repair that gap.
 
✓ The conviction that lowering expectations solves nothing; instead, the 
answer is to change and improve the world to conform to one’s vision.
 
✓ The acceptance that changing the world is awfully hard work because 
abilities and resources are inevitably in need of great development.
 
✓ The internal locus of control to develop deficient abilities and resources 
through constant, creative, and pragmatic innovation.
 
The qualities discussed in this section are the qualities you should cultivate in 
yourself from now on if you want to be the best entrepreneur you can be.
Knowing What Makes a Social 
Entrepreneur Different
So, how is the social entrepreneurial mindset different from the general 
entrepreneurial mindset we cover in the preceding section? We spell it out in 
this section.

245
 Chapter 15: Putting the Entrepreneur in Social Entrepreneurship
Focusing on what is and what ought to be
One difference is the specific type of is versus ought to be troubles that moti-
vate a response from social entrepreneurs. Social entrepreneurs are deeply 
concerned with the social problems and issues of the world, such as poverty, 
equitable distribution of food, shelter, health, education, human rights, and 
so forth. They are, in short, humanitarians who envision a far better, kinder, 
more tolerant, and cooperative world. This is not necessarily so for the gen-
eral entrepreneurial mindset, or for other types of entrepreneurs (refer to 
Figure 15-1).
Feeling people’s pain
At the same time, social entrepreneurs tend to be deeply distressed, per-
haps more so than other entrepreneurs, by the lack of their own and others’ 
abilities and external resources to meet the desperate and visceral needs of 
others. People’s lives, or quality of life, are at stake, and this is more than 
just an abstract problem, as it might be for a business entrepreneur seeking 
profit for profit’s sake. Put it another way: Helping someone escape poverty, 
for example, is a heavier, more serious burden to bear than helping someone 
light her home or office, as Edison was concerned with.
Facing trying conditions
After you leave the Western democratic umbrella, the work to be done in 
social entrepreneurship is, in many cases, beset by difficult political and eco-
nomic environments. Business entrepreneurs, in contrast, generally operate 
under the good graces of democracy and generally supportive political and 
economic agreements. That’s not necessarily the case for social entrepre-
neurs who may be operating in extremely hostile or unfavorable conditions.
 
Lingana Foundation (www.lingana.org) and its supporters are trying to 
assist Darfurian refugees just inside the border of eastern Chad. Doctors 
Without Borders often intercedes in areas where violence and displacement 
are widespread and where other humanitarian organizations have failed to 
meet massive and extremely urgent needs. This kind of risk is not normally 
borne by business entrepreneurs (though there are exceptions).
Being inventive out of necessity
In social entrepreneurship, the level of creative and pragmatic innovation 
involved, thanks to the heroic efforts required, can be nothing short of aston-
ishing. If necessity is the mother of invention, you can see that played out 

246
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
remarkably in some of the emerging technologies being developed by initially 
small-scale eco-entrepreneurs to mitigate the effects of climate change and 
other forms of ecological degradation.
 
Take, for example, the work of a former engineer for the oil industry, now 
known as China’s “Solar King,” Huang Ming. Thanks to Ming’s life-changing 
decision to leave the oil industry and concentrate on building a clean-air 
legacy for his newborn daughter, Dezhou City in the province of Shandong, 
China, is now 70 percent solar powered. It’s popularly known as Solar Valley. 
Ming changed his thinking from oil to solar power, which resulted in stagger-
ing technological change. He employs 60,000 people at Himin Solar Energy 
Group, where the corporate headquarters is the world’s largest solar-powered 
building. Ming’s mission is nothing less than to promote a global cultural and 
environmental revolution that will energize China and the world through solar 
power.
Thinking local, no matter where
Social entrepreneurship is definitely not always the same thing as familiar 
high-profile international aid programs. Far-reaching social entrepreneur-
ship has to always place a value on entrepreneurship at the local level. 
The nearby sidebar “Is creative capitalism social entrepreneurship?” men-
tions the difference between entrepreneurship and the history of Western 
attempts to aid poorer nations. Daniel Lavin, director of the Community 
Initiative Program (CIP; http://cipsierraleone.blogspot.com), and 
his partners Manfred Musa in Sierra Leone and the Fig Tree Foundation 
(www.figtreefoundation.org), show how “real development” must favor 
all forms of local entrepreneurship over everything else. Their own brand of 
social entrepreneurship, through CIP, lends a hand to local entrepreneurs 
who typically have a business focus (though this, in theory, need not always 
be the case) and who always look to strengthen local community projects.
Lavin has developed five keys to determining whether local entrepreneurship 
is really being benefited when Western organizations and companies arrive 
with their solutions (restated here with his kind permission):
 
✓ Local: Who’s driving the priority? The donor, the organization, or the 
individual, group, or community? Are materials locally available or 
imported? Are methods appropriate for the local environment? External 
funding organizations love to erect buildings, which look great in pam-
phlets but later leave locals responsible for their maintenance and 
repair, even though there are no means for upkeep.
 
✓ Ownership: Does the individual, group, or community you’re working 
with have an investment at stake? Does the project create an unfair 
advantage? When external donor agencies approach locals, money 
seems to be no object, and so recipients have no stake in the resources 

247
 Chapter 15: Putting the Entrepreneur in Social Entrepreneurship
that flow their way. Irresponsible use can result. Local business plans 
fail in practicality, profitability, and accountability.
 
✓ Repeatability: When the project is over, could the individual, group, or 
community replicate what was done? Could others, and surrounding 
communities, without additional support, replicate the “development”? 
If rebuilding is necessary, is the knowledge available locally to do that? 
Can other local entities emulate the success of the project elsewhere 
without assistance? True development comes from projects completed 
autonomously.
 
✓ Profitability: Does the project generate a sustaining profit? Does it actu-
ally cover true costs? (Ignoring capital costs paid for by outsiders is 
unrealistic and can lead to disaster.) If profitability occurs only with out-
side influence and contributions, when that support stops, the project 
will fail.
 
✓ Sustainability: If outside supporters walk away, what happens to the 
project? Only when funding organizations or donors are absent can true 
development happen. Real development happens over the long term 
when everyone but the recipient of support has walked away.
Fostering Pragmatic Creativity
In the “Being inventive out of necessity” section, earlier in this chapter, we 
tell you that a primary characteristic of social entrepreneurs is their creative 
and yet down-to-earth, practical ability to innovate, brought on by the enor-
mous real-life challenges they face. In this section, we look at ways in which 
your pragmatic creativity can be fostered.
Recognizing the power of story
The first, most important step to take in developing your pragmatic creativ-
ity is to get your story in order. That is, weave your passion and drive into 
a compelling narrative that engages people. Your story should be clear and 
true and authentic to the core.
As we’ve pointed out, entrepreneurship lives in the wide uncertainties 
between is and ought to be. Entrepreneurship embraces the unknown, chaos, 
and out-of-the-box thinking. As anthropology tells us, whenever humanity 
crosses the threshold from the comforts of everyday life into uncertain ter-
ritory, our finely honed ability to take seemingly disconnected events and 
weave them into our life stories sustains us through the journey.

248

In one of his songs, Emmanuel Jal, child soldier, survivor of horrific genocide, 
internationally renowned rap artist, social entrepreneur, and founder of GUA 
Africa (www.gua-africa.org) sings, “I believe I’ve survived for a reason, to 
tell my story to touch lives.”
In the case of entrepreneurs, their unyielding vision, acknowledgment of 
inadequate capacities, and paradoxical sense of potential lead to a practical 
urgency that is woven into the fabric of their stories — which they’re happy 
to tell over and over to themselves and anyone else who will listen. In that 
telling, the power of the story to sustain the enterprise thrives and grows. 
Is “creative capitalism” social entrepreneurship?
Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates 
recently argued that a hybrid form of business 
and social or ecological entrepreneurship in 
pursuit of a double or triple bottom line (profit 
plus social and environmental good) is a viable 
approach to meeting some of the world’s most 
pressing problems. He calls this approach cre-
ative capitalism.
Bill Gates is a big deal and commands a lot of 
respect, so his notion of creative capitalism 
has sparked a lot of interest. Creative capital-
ism suggests that many Western multinational 
corporations, by tapping into their tremendous 
pools of human and other resources, can meet 
the challenges of our day and still turn a profit. 
Although this sounds extremely attractive, it 
may not be, by definition, particularly entrepre-
neurial — especially at the local level where it 
counts the most.
Why not? Because the approach basically calls 
for re-allocation of already existing talents and 
resources, instead of the promotion of local 
entrepreneurial activity that demands the best 
creative and pragmatic responses from those 
directly affected. The entrepreneurial mindset 
at the heart of dignity, integrity, adaptability, and 
social development could be seriously compro-
mised. Unhealthy dependencies could result 
from the hopes that some corporate-backed 
cavalry will be riding in to save the day. A lot of 
research bears out our criticism here. The his-
tory of corporate interventions is littered with 
failures that lacked local entrepreneurial “fit.” 
The documentary What Are We Doing Here? 
provides an eyewitness account of the failures 
of Western intervention in Africa, in particular.
We don’t mean to denigrate the possibilities 
for large corporations, universities, and gov-
ernments to help. But if that help is to move 
from just a new form of charity to real devel-
opment of broken societies, it must move from 
being another fancy form of handout to being a 
legitimate hand up. Tied aid — aid with strings 
attached — or Western investments with 
expectations of financial return are not social 
entrepreneurship. In our opinion, fostering local 
and autonomous entrepreneurship is the way 
to go.
Local entrepreneurs may be looking for assis-
tance as they innovate. They’re not looking, 
however, to have things done for them by 
distant, faceless institutions, whether for or not 
for profit. This is where the poor “fit” comes in. 
Western corporations know little if anything of 
local cultures, experiences, or dreams. The gap 
between is and ought to be, which is what must 
be dealt with after all, is the entrepreneur’s, 
often embodied and storied in his own life and 
culture.

249
 Chapter 15: Putting the Entrepreneur in Social Entrepreneurship
Someone who calls herself an entrepreneur but who doesn’t develop a practically 
urgent story to tell is probably an armchair moralist, not a true entrepreneur.
 
In telling a practical and urgent story to others, the entrepreneur now has the 
potential to galvanize a community and organize and mobilize them to action. 
With a single narrative stroke, the whole becomes greater than the sum of its 
parts.
Looking at whether creativity 
can be learned
The classic view of creativity is that it’s really the stuff of solitary genius. It 
comes naturally — or not — and can’t be taught. People believe they’re not 
creative, and so they aren’t. However, recent thinking on the subject of cre-
ativity seems to disagree. Increasingly, researchers are telling us that creativ-
ity is contextual and emerges from within the four entrepreneurial domains 
mentioned in the “Defining What an Entrepreneur Is” section, earlier in this 
chapter. In other words, creativity is cultural, learnable, and socializable. 
Boosting confidence with the Thomas theorem
The most important thing you can do to boost 
your confidence is expect to succeed. Too 
often, expectations are either of mediocrity, 
indifference, or helplessness. Clearly, if anyone 
has to avoid these negative expectations, it’s 
you because you must succeed where there is 
little but a history of indifference or failure.
According to a classic little theorem called 
the Thomas theorem, devised by the American 
sociologist W. I. Thomas, situations that are 
defined as real are real in their consequences. 
The classic example is when a rumor of a bank 
failure starts a stampede to withdraw money 
from the bank — the crisis has become real, 
even though it was just a rumor. So, expect-
ing to succeed means defining your success 
as really real, not as if it merely could be real. 
When you consistently treat your eventual suc-
cess as real, real consequences will flow from 
that, which might not otherwise. One reason for 
that is because other people will be far more 
apt to take you seriously and treat your success 
as real if you do. Treasure the support of those 
who, like you, see the reality of your success. 
They may be able to provide you with critical 
resources when you most need them.
When you’re not succeeding, however — and 
these times will occur — you must not give up, 
but instead should seek out the best possible 
help. So-called help-seeking behavior is a sign 
of confidence and self-esteem. Those who don’t 
seek help, or don’t know how to seek help when 
they’re in trouble, are in very deep trouble.
When you’re succeeding, expect more 
success — this is the basis of any winning 
streak.

250
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
Plus, the more interdependent these domains are, the greater the possibilities 
become as practical creativity flows from one domain to another.
Finally, you can only really measure creativity against the value it has in 
specific social contexts. This is why some people argue that the best way 
to promote creativity is in environments that are playful and trusting and 
that promote freedom of action, application across a wide range of contexts, 
interactive exchange, and a concentration on real-world applications. More 
and more, this seems to be the direction that the promotion of creativity has 
to take.
 
In short, most people are potentially creative, given the right kind of nourish-
ing cultural soil.
Ah, but where is this soil? The soil can be found in the idea of shared creative 
literacy. Everyone associated with entrepreneurial efforts should be “literate” 
with respect to creativity. That means being familiar with the lifestyles and 
practices associated with creativity, including developing the communication 
skills to inject out-of-the-box thinking into the conversation.
How can you do that? The old-fashioned way is a good start: Read lots, dis-
cuss lots, collaborate lots. The new-fashioned way — in the age of Web 2.0, or 
collaborative communities and social networking — only adds possibilities: 
Set up collaborative wikis (people-powered collaborative knowledge centers) 
and get onboard with Google Wave (http://wave.google.com), harness 
the power of face-to-face social networking to solve problems, visually map 
complex ideas and their relationships in teams (see, for example, www.mind 
meister.com or www.xmind.net), and so on. Robin Good’s Collaborative 
Map of Best Online Collaboration Tools for 2009 provides an exciting over-
view of the possibilities (http://is.gd/5ESAm).
You can promote creative literacy and overall public awareness even more 
widely through the idea of social looping. This is where you demonstrate the 
positive impact of your efforts to financial, social, and political supporters 
and give those folks the tools to inspire others to do likewise. For example, 
charity: water (www.charitywater.org) encourages supporters to send 
e-cards to friends and loved ones while also giving a person or a family clean 
water for 20 years. All in all, the opportunities for Web 2.0 techniques in 
social entrepreneurship are mushrooming. (See Chapter 11 for more on Web 
2.0 and social media.)
 
Here are some practical ideas for fostering your own creativity:
 
✓ Juggle multiple projects. Keeping your plate full of variety allows you 
to think from many different angles and provides opportunities to cross-
pollinate — apply what you’re learning in one setting to others.

251
 Chapter 15: Putting the Entrepreneur in Social Entrepreneurship
 
✓ Borrow from giants. Because the materials you use to solve problems 
have a huge impact on the quality of your eventual solution, working 
with the best available materials is always a good idea. Don’t reinvent 
the wheel when you don’t have to. If someone has thought about prob-
lems like yours in a different domain, seek him out and learn from his 
successes and failures. Imitation, to borrow from something author 
Stephen King wrote a long time ago, precedes creation.
 
✓ Maintain your enthusiasm and focus. Realize that your creative entre-
preneurial efforts will result in practical value to others. By being of 
service to others, you realize the importance of your work, and that 
helps to maintain your enthusiasm and focus. Thomas Edison’s personal 
credo reflects this: “My philosophy of life is work — bringing out the 
secrets of nature and applying them for the happiness of man. I know of 
no better service to render during the short time we are in this world.”
 
✓ Stay confident. Cling to your moral convictions and sense of urgency. You 
know things are not what they ought to be. If your confidence in that basic 
starting point is shaken, the strength and solidity of your entrepreneurial 
identity will melt away. At the same time, nobody wants to be Chicken 
Little (“The sky is falling, the sky is falling!”), so be sure your position is 
rock solid and unassailable by every fair-minded skeptic.
 
✓ Shrug off setbacks. There will be trials and tribulations, as well as fail-
ures (yes, realistically, most projects and ventures inevitably face failure 
or extinction). Don’t get caught in the dumps, or even on emotional 
roller coasters. Lean on your friends. Celebrate and piggyback accom-
plishments, learn from failures, and then stay ahead of the great tsunami 
of uncertainty that threatens to sweep everyone away by constantly 
focusing on the process of your next practical creation.
 
✓ Be open to serendipity. It’s long been accepted by creative folks of all 
kinds that serendipity can yield far more important results for the best-
laid plans, so it’s always good practice to make yourself available to 
serendipity. So, what’s serendipity? Serendipity is artfully profiting from 
something accidental. It’s unexpected, practical (in that the accident is 
profitable or useful) and artful (while the positive end result can’t be 
thoroughly planned, that doesn’t reduce it to “dumb luck” either). No, 
we’re talking about chance favoring the ready mind.
How can you make yourself ready for serendipity?
 
✓ In a world of probabilities, pay attention to exceptions. They may 
have a great deal to tell you. Where you might expect commonalities, 
watch out for differences. And conversely, where you’d expect differ-
ences, be sensitive to hidden commonalities.

252
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
 
✓ Practice free association, which is simply allowing ideas in the form 
of words or images to suggest other words or images, and letting those 
new ideas suggest even more, and on and on. You can productively let 
your mind drift and wander in wonder, connecting one thing to another 
in an almost “sacred” time of leisure and reverie. Going for unhurried 
walks or listening to relaxing music might help to induce this creative 
drift. Or you can connect to other people’s ideas which can, in turn, 
spark all kinds of serendipitous associations.
 
✓ Look for occasional opportunities to just get things done, initially, as 
best you can. This approach isn’t about settling for less — at least not 
over the long run. It’s about getting your feet set. That’s the pragmatic 
part.
 
 Be realistic when you have to. You may have to do things in less-than-
optimal ways, not always in terms of best practices — but at least things 
are getting done. At least you’re showing that you’re responsive, reli-
able, and compassionate. This is how being pragmatic attracts more 
support, which is useful in terms of your enterprise’s big picture. You 
may not get things quite right and hit the bull’s-eye the first time, or the 
second time, or even the third time. But the feedback you get along the 
way is invaluable in terms of constantly innovating and improving what 
you do.
 
 Similarly, don’t wait for perfection before you bring these learning expe-
riences back to those who share your creative literacy. Your quick, regu-
lar, and perhaps more modest contributions will add up to far more for 
everyone concerned than any single brilliant insight.
 
 Be sure to demonstrate your improvements to all your supporters. 
Some form of social looping, discussed earlier in the section “Looking 
at whether creativity can be learned” would be an ideal way to go about 
this, whether that involved face-to-face networking or the use of social 
media.
Managing your entrepreneurial knowledge
All the practical creativity in the world won’t 
amount to a plugged nickel if you lose track 
of its products. You shouldn’t ever have to 
reinvent the wheel. Whatever new ways you 
develop to tackle social and environmental 
issues becomes your intellectual capital that 
will form part of your legacy. Record and keep 
all such innovations so that you’re always in the 
position of building on your practical creativity.
All information associated with your social 
entrepreneurial efforts should be archived, 
stored, and backed up safely, on- and off-site, 
in multiple locations, on CD-ROMs, and in extra 
hard drives. If you keep handwritten journals, 
get yourself a digital camera or scanner and 
capture those pages in digital form so that 
they’re also more useful and mobile.

▶ Understanding how leadership and other forces drive social change
▶ Exploring the varieties of charismatic leadership
▶ Checking out the important roles and methods of servant leaders
▶ Harnessing the power of distributed leadership
▶ Boosting your own leadership
S
ocial entrepreneurs like you often share a particular and commendable 
mindset that challenges the status quo and strives for extraordinary 
change. But as valuable as that mindset may be for drawing up the blueprints 
for social or environmental change, no one can do it alone. Those blueprints 
won’t amount to much if others are unwilling to help you make something 
extraordinary happen. If you want to build houses for the homeless and 
everybody else wants to go hot-air ballooning, your plans are in trouble.
 
How do you coax other people’s priorities to line up with your own? That, in 
a nutshell, is the problem of leadership, and it’s what distinguishes leadership 
from management (the subject of Chapter 17). Leadership determines what we 
ought to do — the ends we should be striving for — and why. Management is 
about how we get there.
When it comes to promoting social change, you have to establish, through 
leadership, the goals that people will work collectively toward before dealing 
with how, through management, you’re going to get where you’re going. Of 
course, in a real world of rapidly changing and competing interests, lining up 
purposes and priorities with your own can be a very difficult task. Leadership 
is hard — but it must be done.

254
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
In this chapter, we look at how social entrepreneurs, as leaders, can bring 
potential helpers together under one banner. In particular, we focus on two 
types of leaders — charismatic and servant leaders — and then we look at 
the promise of a third kind, called distributed leadership.
Building a Leadership Model 
for Social Change
Given the strength and virtue of your entrepreneurial mindset, the process of 
aligning the priorities of your potential helpers with your own priorities usu-
ally demands that they follow your lead, at least in the broadest forms, and 
not the other way around. Otherwise, the whole idea of your social entrepre-
neurship will be in jeopardy.
To understand how to get other people to change their priorities, you need 
to know something about how social change becomes possible. For that, we 
draw loosely on the work of the great social psychologist Kurt Lewin. Bear 
with us as we try to gently apply some unavoidable theory here.
Balancing driving and restraining forces
Achieving social change, even just changes in priorities, is a lot like walking. 
Forces that drive us toward what ought to be are what compel us to move for-
ward. But these driving forces clash with rival restraining forces — the ten-
dency to stick with the status quo — which try to take us in other directions 
(see Figure 16-1). You have to manage both forward momentum and upright 
balance while you walk. Similarly, moving forward for social change requires 
a delicate balance between driving and restraining forces. Too much driving 
force and you pitch forward and fall on your face. Too much restraining force 
and you don’t get anywhere.
 
The very important and unusual lesson in this is that resistance to change is an 
enduring, expected, and necessary feature of any effort toward social change.
Change is difficult to achieve. It requires constant communication and nego-
tiation — and it takes time. Simply ramming through driving forces to bully 
restraining forces into submission is next to impossible, regardless of the 
power or virtue behind the driving forces. The difficulty of actually address-
ing the global climate change issue, which would seem to be a no-brainer, 
is a good illustration. Too many entrenched industrial, energy, and trans-
portation interests have too much on the line to simply abandon their long-
term goals (which may be in conflict with a more sustainable world) simply 
because scientists are convincing politicians that they should. That’s resis-
tance, and it’s entirely natural and to be expected.

For every push forward instigated by driving forces, you can expect a cor-
responding push back from restraining forces. The important takeaway idea 
here is that where a more traditional view of social change might see conflict 
as destructive and unnecessary, this more contemporary view not only sees 
conflict as inevitable and central to positive social change but also claims that 
it also produces better-quality results.
Making sure driving forces win
In every case, changing priorities become possible through continual commu-
nication between the opposing forces. But the driving forces (that’s you!) still 
have to win in the end. Change becomes possible as driving forces become 
stronger while the hardened and crystallized structures of restraining forces
 
✓ Reframe, or become seen in a new light so that they’re now understood 
to conform to or support driving forces
 
✓ Unfreeze, or become weaker
 
✓ Become part of a negotiated “win-win” solution (in which both sides 
appear to have gained)
We explore each of these possibilities as we consider the question of leader-
ship in this chapter.

256
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
Social Change and Charismatic 
Leadership
Charismatic leaders are leaders whose personal qualities include a certain 
magnetism that allows them to light the way for others. These types of lead-
ers are often the first and most direct expression of driving forces. They seek 
mainly to unfreeze or weaken restraining forces, but they’re also active in 
reframing and transforming them and possibly in negotiating win-win out-
comes. (See the preceding section if you’re not sure what these terms mean.)
Rarely seen or heard from during good times, charismatic leaders leap to 
the forefront during times of uncertainty and crisis, when the promise — the 
ought to be — of addressing human needs through existing social institutions 
is broken too much. Frustrated populations often start to oppose the status 
quo by abandoning or, in fancy talk, disconfirming the status quo and finding 
charismatic leaders to begin charting new directions.
This process is powerful feedback to the status quo restraining forces. The 
rational aspects of the disconfirming feedback are “coolly” logical and self-
evident — so they’re seen as trustworthy and effective. But charisma itself is 
not “cool” in the sense of cold and logical. Charisma is a form of hot cognition, 
or passionate thought, as are its social origins. Heated by broken promises 
of human betterment and compassion, the growing critiques begin attacking 
complacency and setting new priorities and directions.
When restraining forces resist, driving forces can use the “heat” of that resis-
tance to strengthen the charismatic message.
 
Don’t think you can pull off tricks or shortcuts: Trying to create a false sense 
of urgency is a sure way to waste your social change efforts. This can happen 
when the charismatic leader is not selected by the upset population but is 
only self-proclaimed — in other words, when the leader lacks credibility 
among those demanding change.
The basis for driving forces’ sense of urgency comes out of those forces’ 
internal discussions. That is, the charismatic leader’s legitimate social selec-
tion is often thought to rest on an inspired, sometimes even divine, mandate. 
This results not in a pharaoh (anymore), but in a powerfully felt “calling” on 
the part of the supporters and the leader. This mutual support — “we call 
you” and “I honor your call” — energizes and unifies the group to the advan-
tage of the driving forces because the restraining forces are typically less 
driven and organized. This slow process is more or less why progress, even 
though it seems glacial, does in fact happen throughout history.

257
 Chapter 16: Leading Indicators: Leadership and Your Organization
 
You as a social entrepreneur may well be a charismatic leader, even if that 
talent is latent. Your ability to express and share your vision and to exercise 
sound practical and ethical judgment every step of the way will be critical to 
realizing that talent. However, beyond that, your success will depend on your 
legitimate and freely chosen social “selection” by at least the people you want 
to assist — your target of benefits. If and when you’re selected, you’ll experi-
ence the double commitment of your own compassionate response (as in, 
“How could I not respond to this need?”) and the strong social expectation 
that goes with the calling.
Switching allegiances and reframing
Due to their social backing, charismatic leaders may weaken resistance by 
bringing out feelings of shame and guilt in members of the restraining forces. 
Though causing this kind of shame and guilt may not be the goal, it doesn’t 
hurt. In trying to rid themselves of those negative and conflicting emotions, 
the guilt-ridden and shamed parties may switch allegiances, align themselves 
with the charismatics and their supporters, and endorse the driving forces. 
This is what we mean by reframing — a self-perceived weakness among 
restraining forces is suddenly seen, by them, as evidence of their character 
and integrity (or lack thereof).
 
One classic example comes from the civil rights movement, which reached 
its peak in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1959 and 1960. Driving forces included the 
African American boycott of Nashville businesses and a deluge of negative 
publicity surrounding segregation itself. The weakened restraining forces were 
revealed in the futile backlash of mass arrests and the shocking bombing of 
a prominent African American lawyer’s house. This struggle motivated black 
students to join the driving forces by marching on city hall and confronting 
Nashville’s mayor, Ben West (a conservative symbol of restraining forces). 
Charismatic student leaders vehemently argued with West against the valid-
ity of the racist status quo. The mayor — likely shamed and guilt-ridden in the 
face of so much opposition (not only among the assembled protesters but also 
across Nashville’s black community and the United States as a whole) — con-
ceded that segregation is wrong. Shortly thereafter, Nashville began to deseg-
regate — though not without resistance, which was anticipated by civil rights 
organizers, who went to great lengths to help formerly whites-only businesses 
save face in the transition.
Restraining force denial and resistance shouldn’t be surprising to anyone. 
After all, those whose priorities are being challenged want to protect their 
years of investment in self-identity, their fragile egos (which cringe at admit-
ting to errors in judgment), and the group norms themselves — traditions 
and rituals that mark shared membership in social life. There will always be 

258
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
resistance to driving forces because of the learning curves associated with 
investing in change. As a result, inducing guilt alone may produce short-term 
gains, but probably little in the long run, as defensive mechanisms kick in to 
protect the priorities that are under siege.
The other-attentive and the self-absorbed
Charismatic leaders have a purpose that makes their lives important, coher-
ent, and worthwhile. Their lives make emotional sense, and they meet the 
demands and challenges of their lives with energy and commitment. These 
characteristics are tremendously attractive to others. Charismatic leaders 
typically have substantial and widely recognized interpersonal skills such as 
charm, magnetism, and powers of persuasion. History tells of two main kinds 
of charismatic leaders, and they have funny names:
 
✓ Other-attentive (OA): Other-attentive charismatic leaders are inclined to 
social inclusivity (they don’t reject anyone), full participation, and the 
flourishing of others. Examples include Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, and 
more recently Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Teresa, Martin Luther King, Jr., 
and Nelson Mandela.
 
✓ Self-absorbed (SA): Self-absorbed leaders are inclined to social exclu-
sion (they reject some people), elitism, domination, and subjugation 
(they oppress people). This is the dark side of charisma. Think Hitler, 
Mussolini, Pol Pot, Joseph Stalin, Kim Jong-Il, and even “small-timers” 
like David Koresh and Jim Jones. You get the picture.
Frequently, charismatic leaders of either stripe (OA or SA) manage to get 
restraining forces to reframe their resistance into benefiting driving forces. 
When restraining forces have been weakened by the urgency of the charis-
matic, some people on the restraining side feel their resistance weakening. 
Combining that development with the basic human attractions that charis-
matic leaders offer — their meaningfulness and life purpose, their easy social 
skills and ability to promote a sense of fellowship — creates an inviting form 
of leadership that is hard to resist (given the human need for affiliation — see 
Chapter 2). These same qualities can be used to build adoration and unity 
among driving forces.
 
So what’s the difference between the two types of charismatic leaders? The 
crucial difference between OA and SA charismatic leadership types revolves 
around respect for what the experts call boundaries of identity (the outlines 
and limits of who people understand themselves to be), both for individuals 
and groups. OA charismatic leaders respect boundaries and build bridges 
across them, valuing the differences among people while promoting core com-
monalities. SA charismatic leaders do not tolerate such boundaries; they’re 
colonizers — boundaries are threats to be attacked, not unique features to be 
celebrated.

259
 Chapter 16: Leading Indicators: Leadership and Your Organization
With OA charismatic leaders, everyone is born acceptable, and from such a 
safe position it’s easy to admire charismatic leaders and voluntarily join with 
them and the driving forces they represent. The same cannot be said for the 
SA charismatic. Some of the best and worst leaders in human history illus-
trate this distinction.
Social Change and Servant Leadership
In their social origins, selection, and sense of calling, all charismatic leaders 
are leaders who, in some broad sense, serve communities. With those who 
display OA charisma, though, there is a special inclination toward what lead-
ership scholars today call servant leadership. Simply put, servant leaders are 
leaders whose main purpose for leading is to serve others. Their leadership 
is an investment in the development, well-being, and good of others. There 
seems to be a strong relation between a servant leader’s “other focus” and 
the inclusiveness of the OA charismatic.
Distinguishing servant leaders 
and charismatic leaders
Where servant leaders differ from OA charismatics is in the way they serve 
others. Other-attentive charismatic leaders motivate, inspire, galvanize driv-
ing forces, and passionately critique restraining forces, creating doubt among 
them. They may lead protest marches, for example, or give public speeches 
and communicate through popular media. When OA leaders retire from 
public view or die, they leave behind a legacy for others to continue.
 
Martin Luther King, Jr., challenged a set of restraining forces in 1968 when, 
in collaboration with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, he orga-
nized the Poor People’s Campaign. The campaign strove to achieve economic 
justice for African Americans, starting with sanitation workers who were, at 
the time, making $1.70 an hour. Proper economic justice called for a much 
higher minimum wage, which the organizers suggested should be $9 per hour. 
The campaign took the form of a cross-country march, ending in Washington, 
D.C., with a demand made to Congress to establish a bill of rights for poor 
people and to grant aid to the most impoverished communities in the United 
States. As the march progressed from its starting point in Marks, Mississippi, 
it gathered more and more participants, coalescing into what Dr. King called 
“a multiracial army of the poor.”
The Poor People’s Campaign strove to help the destitute segments of every 
minority. Poor Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Native Americans, and even poor 
whites were targeted in the campaign. King described it as the “second 
phase” of the civil rights movement (the first phase having focused on ending 

260
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
racial segregation). Dr. King intended this campaign to be the largest, most 
widespread manifestation of the civil rights movement. And though Dr. King 
was assassinated on April 4, 1968, the campaign continued. Less than a 
month after his death, demonstrators reached Washington, D.C., where they 
engaged in two weeks of lobbying at various federal agencies.
Servant leaders, on the other hand, are more engaged in the daily lives of 
those they serve. They’re capacity and skill builders, as well as educators, 
who help create priority-setting growth among both driving and restraining 
forces. If OA charismatic leaders can be said to till the soil, servant leaders 
sow the seeds. They tend to work far more personally, in more intimate, 
interactive, and face-to-face settings such as classrooms and workshops, and 
they may sustain their efforts over multiple encounters.
That isn’t to say that OA charismatics can’t be servant leaders. Certainly, the 
two roles can be combined in one person, so that a lot of switching hats may 
go on. Mahatma Gandhi and Mother Teresa are excellent examples of leaders 
who exhibited both OA charismatic and servant leader traits. Both worked 
diligently and in very practical and prolonged ways to educate others about 
the goals and objectives of their compassionate ways of life.
Charismatic leaders tend to be “home grown” — committed members native 
to the populations they want to help — whereas the quieter, more hands-
on servant leaders, although they can be home grown as well, can also be 
“parachuted in” to serve, or may accidentally arrive on the scene and end up 
helping. An enormous amount of development work being done by Western 
organizations in economically disadvantaged countries is being done by 
parachuted servant leaders. This situation requires sensitivity because of 
cross-cultural differences, and so in those cases it’s best if servant leaders 
work in support of local OA charismatic leadership.
Can parachuted-in or accidental servant leaders become OA charismatics? 
Possibly, but not without legitimate social selection, which usually takes 
quite a while to come to fulfillment. Gandhi’s work in South Africa was defi-
nitely of the accidental kind, because he arrived there at only 24 years of 
age and then experienced firsthand a racism that he felt compelled to serve 
against.
 
Nothing is more embarrassing than aid workers/servant leaders who believe 
and act as if they’ve been called as OA charismatics when they’re virtually 
unknown, are not yet trusted, and lack legitimacy. The same mistake can 
happen on a larger scale, in the case of Western nations who mistake servant 
leadership for OA charisma. These situations often lead to enormous animos-
ity and end up actually strengthening restraining forces.

261
 Chapter 16: Leading Indicators: Leadership and Your Organization
The nuts and bolts of servant leadership
Although servant leaders help strengthen the membership of driving forces, 
perhaps their most important work is with those who represent restraining 
forces and yet may be waffling or fence-sitting as a result of charismatic 
messages.
Four general areas of involvement for servant leaders are key:
 
✓ Educating and communicating
 
✓ Enhancing participation and involvement
 
✓ Facilitating and supporting
 
✓ Negotiating and moving toward agreement
Servant leaders are often involved in starting conversations, perhaps for the 
first time, about goals of cooperation, fair play, appreciation of diversity, 
tolerance, and so on. They may be restating similar OA charisma points, but 
it’s more likely to be in an intimate office setting across a table than before 
thousands of people.
Servant leaders also engage in simple cost-benefit conversations with resistors 
in an attempt to show the rewards of changed priorities. Servant leaders may 
also broker win-win agreements or they may work with mature individuals who 
are perhaps more set in their ways, in order to reduce anxiety over adjusting 
to and embracing new priorities. Ideally, through reframing, servant leaders 
can demonstrate that much of the fear of change is unfounded or exaggerated.
Servant leader “interventions” can also be done with solidified social institu-
tions, such as patriarchies (male-dominated societies), which have formalized 
rules and procedures or highly structured organizations, including bureau-
cracies. Finally, servant leaders often deal with the “smaller stuff,” such as 
misunderstandings, entrenched self-interest, lack of trust, and so on, helping 
those mired in restraining forces to see, in nonthreatening ways, that change 
is possible while maintaining integrity and dignity.
Social Change and Distributed 
Leadership
Distributed leadership is an increasingly popular alternative to other current 
understandings of leadership. Distributed leadership says that leadership and 

262
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
influence don’t come from individuals so much as from within the holistic 
qualities of groups. In other words, in this view, leadership emerges from a 
whole that is greater than the sum of its parts — from a general culture or 
lifestyle that is shared, practiced, and achieved by entire organizations or 
communities of people.
 
Leadership, then, is a latent potential in any social organization, and leaders 
emerge from that potential.
Distributed leadership is an extension of the close relationship that com-
munities have with leadership, and that we discuss earlier in terms of char-
ismatic and servant leaders. However, researcher Nigel Bennett reminds us 
that, unlike the case of charismatic and servant leaders, with distributed 
leadership the boundaries of leadership become permeable — that is, who 
plays which leadership role in promoting changes in priorities is not fixed. 
Proponents of distributed leadership emphasize that leadership is involved 
in small-scale daily activities and interactions, as well as the large-scale plans 
of many people.
 
In an educational setting, the question of school leadership is often flexible as 
ideas on direction are set by parents, students, and the surrounding community, 
as well as by teachers and administrators. In these ways, the leadership becomes 
a full, inclusive, culturally sensitive, and democratic social construction.
When applied to driving forces, distributed leadership has the potential to 
strengthen those forces through continuing conversations that enhance col-
laborative learning and shared understandings. As a result, leadership is 
returned to social organization where it properly belongs.
Extending distributed leadership to involvement with restraining forces 
reveals many possibilities for reframing, weakening, or negotiating win-win 
outcomes. With reframing, for example, driving forces leaders might invite 
restraining forces to help them combat “group think” among those promot-
ing change by offering up new information and understanding. This invitation 
might serve as a powerful incentive to weaken or resistance to driving forces. 
With that incentive, the likelihood of bringing others to your side increases 
dramatically.
Developing Your Own Leadership
Both charismatic and servant leaders need to work toward creating a culture 
of distributed leadership, but make no mistake: Developing that culture is 
never a simple task. In fact, leadership development is an area that could 

263
 Chapter 16: Leading Indicators: Leadership and Your Organization
benefit from the efforts of social entrepreneurs all around the world. Nobody 
in all of history has had a patent on how to practice leadership — yet it 
always desperately needs to be done.
 
Leadership is constantly reinvented by everyone who engages in it. That 
includes you.
We have two modest suggestions that might help to piece some of the puzzle 
of leadership development together. The best leadership development efforts 
will do both of the following:
 
✓ Promote public compassion, social inclusion, attachment, the discern-
ing use of culture, and social insight at every turn (see Chapter 2). 
Remember that asking people of any age to change and grow as leaders 
involves dynamic challenges and tensions that must be dealt with 
sensitively.
 
✓ Intentionally incorporate child, youth, and adult learning theory into 
any curriculum (see Chapter 4). Leaders in training need to earn their 
stripes in deeply embedded, contextual, and practical circumstances. 
What they do should not be pie-in-the-sky but rather social entrepre-
neurial — in other words, aimed at making real, concrete change — and 
feedback and evaluation should, at the very least, come from those most 
affected by their leadership efforts.
 
Natural relationships exist among the three types of leadership we discuss in 
this chapter, especially in their attempts to bring positive and extraordinary 
social change on behalf of any community that might be in need.
Our model suggests that out of frustrated community needs and crises, char-
ismatic leaders emerge who contribute to the driving forces of change and 
deal with restraining forces in particular ways. These leaders, in turn, work 
with servant leaders who strategically promote a culture of distributed lead-
ership that makes its way deep into the heart of the community in need and 
strengthens it to the core. In Figure 16-2, that progression runs in sequence 
from 1 to 4.
However, the connections among the leadership forms and the frustrated 
community can be varied. Community frustrations don’t necessarily have to 
be the only point of departure. For example, distributed leadership (4) could 
give rise to servant leadership (3), which could heighten awareness and frus-
tration in a community (1). From that could emerge charismatic leadership 
(2), which — well, you get the picture.

264
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
Working to change priorities is complicated and dynamic stuff, but in the 
end, these components and their interrelations are central, especially as 
they deal with the dynamics of driving and restraining forces.

I
t’s one thing to start a social enterprise, but it’s quite another to manage 
one well enough to successfully fulfill its mission.
In this chapter, we look at several issues that tend to spring up when manag-
ing both for-profit and nonprofit social entrepreneurial organizations. Even 
small social enterprises can develop managerial problems, so we encourage 
you to read this chapter if you’re serious about achieving your goals — 
regardless of the size of your enterprise.
Recruiting Paid Staff
When it comes to recruitment of paid staff, your goal, quite simply, is to find 
the best person for the job at a level of pay that both you and that person 
can accept. Many times, you can find candidates through word of mouth and 
networking (see Chapter 11). But if networking doesn’t work, you’ll also want 
to take the steps we outline in this section.
Writing a job description
When you’re recruiting new paid staff, your first step is to identify and write 
down the tasks of the job. The time you spend doing this will be time well 
spent. Make sure to

266
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
 
✓ Describe, as precisely as possible, what the candidate will be expected 
to do.
 
✓ State the skills, knowledge, and experience required.
For example, don’t just say you want a secretary. You want one who will type 
all letters, copy material for board meetings, make appointments for the top 
leaders, handle telephone calls, and so on. The candidate must have two 
years of formal clerical training and three years of experience.
 
The more specific you can be, the better. These details can help eliminate 
unhappy surprises later on. Candidates who’ve been selected for interviewing 
must read this job description, which should also be used later in reviewing 
the employee’s job performance and determining his role and responsibilities 
in the organization.
After you’ve written a full description of the job, come up with a summary 
of that job description. Your summary should be as short as possible — the 
length is commonly determined by the word limit set by the media in which 
you intend to publish. Still this summary must be informative and clear. Be 
sure to indicate how long the recruitment phase will last, including when 
you’ll end your search and start interviewing applicants.
 
When you’re coming up with your job description, it may help to browse other 
job posting boards for ideas, such as Monster.com, craigslist (www.craigs
list.org), IdeaList (www.idealist.org), and CareerBuilder (http://
nonprofit.careerbuilder.com). Look for nonprofit job listings.
 
Make the post specific in your requirements to avoid having to wade through 
hundreds of applicants to find the right one. Don’t be afraid to put the feel 
and personality of the organization into the ad to help attract like-minded 
people. And if the job has special criteria, state them in the notice as well. For 
example, people suffering from allergies to animals should be advised that the 
advertised post requires them to work with animals or work in spaces where 
animals live.
 
The following is a sample of a typical job notice that may be used in recruiting 
paid staff to a social enterprise:
Receptionist/secretary: Competitive salary; starting date: December 1, 
2010; minimal qualifications: two years post-secondary education, two-
years experience; bilingual English/Spanish preferred. Send résumé and 
two references to name of social enterprise by e-mail at e-mail address or 
by ordinary mail at mailing address. Deadline: November 1, 2010.
Notices should be short and to the point. Traditional media charges by 
the word, which reinforced the short and sweetness, but in the Age of the 

267
 Chapter 17: Managing a Social Enterprise
Internet, you don’t really pay by word anymore. Instead, you pay for featured 
ads and bold headlines.
 
Really think more about using the best, most accurate search terms, bear-
ing in mind that prospective job seekers will type in certain words to pull up 
results. Choose the proper wording in the ad to make sure your ad comes up 
in the proper results. Also, be clear in the ad how you want to be contacted. 
If you leave a fax number, be sure to keep the machine stocked with paper. If 
you hate being bothered by phone calls, be sure to specify “No calls, please.” 
Crafty and competitive job seekers will even show up unannounced at your 
location after Googling your office address.
Posting a want ad
Circulate the want ad, or job notice, wherever you think it might attract quali-
fied candidates. The Internet is the obvious place to start these days. Here 
are a few of the better-regarded job boards on the Internet:
 
✓ Career.com: www.career.com
 
✓ CareerBuilder: www.careerbuilder.com
 
✓ craigslist: www.craigslist.org
 
✓ Hound: www.hound.com
 
✓ Jobs at Change.org: http://jobs.change.org
 
✓ Job Central: www.jobcentral.com
 
✓ Monster: www.monster.com
 
✓ Opportunity Knocks: www.oppotunityknocks.org
 
✓ Yahoo! Hot Jobs: hotjobs.yahoo.com
 
Be sure to put all job notices on your own Web site and link to these job open-
ings from your site’s home page. If you have a newsletter, you might want to 
list your job openings there.
Consider the various employment services in your community, whether 
private or governmental. Contact related or compatible enterprises and 
organizations and see if they’ll allow you to list your job openings in their 
newsletters. Depending on the vacancy to be filled and the appropriateness 
of the location, good old-fashioned bulletin boards can also be an effective 
showplace for job notices.

268
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
 
In a down economy, it’s a good idea to contact other organizations that may 
be downsizing. When you’re faced with having to lay off good people, it may 
help them for you to come along and provide a job opportunity. This method 
is especially good for finding short-term (per-project) positions — to help 
other orgs keep good staff members busy in slow times.
Creating a job application
You’ll probably want to state in your ad certain criteria that candidates 
must speak to when applying. For example, you might want to ask them to 
indicate their
 
✓ Educational background
 
✓ Languages spoken, written, and read
 
✓ Citizenship and country of origin
 
✓ Any other information you believe is relevant to the mission and goals of 
your enterprise and is legally permissible to ask for
 
Many countries and states prohibit asking the age or sex of applicants.
 
If you want to use a prepared application form or develop your own, check out 
the samples and free forms online at www.entrepreneur.com/formnet.
Interviewing candidates
After you have some applications trickling — or flooding — in, you need to 
review résumés and cover letters. Separate out the ones that aren’t qualified 
so you can focus on those who are. You’re looking for people who can do the 
job and who also have demonstrated a commitment to social and community 
causes, especially yours. You may also be looking for people who stand out 
in some way from the crowd. Narrow your choices to three candidates and 
call them in for interviews.
Try to bunch the interviews together as much as possible — see if you can 
do them all in one week, or over two weeks at most. The closer the interviews 
are together in time, the better — you want the interviewers to note every-
thing that’s important about every candidate, so memory is critical.
 
Don’t do it all yourself. Ask at least one or two colleagues to be present at each 
interview session. Two heads are better than one when it comes to forming 
impressions about people in the interview process.

269
 Chapter 17: Managing a Social Enterprise
Hold the job interviews at the work site where the candidate, if hired, will be 
employed. Dress well for the occasion out of respect for the candidate and 
for your enterprise. You want to impress the candidate in every way possible 
with the importance of both the job opening and the mission of your organi-
zation. Make notes directly on each résumé to help you in your evaluation. 
Some interviewers even take simple photographs of qualified candidates 
to help keep track of each meeting (but be sensitive — some people dislike 
having their photo taken).
 
Good candidates are often in demand, so use the interview to sell them on why 
they want to work for you. If the job is on the low end of the salary spectrum, 
make a point of explaining the other perks or benefits to working for your 
organization. Some people place as much value on quality of the work envi-
ronment as they do on the salary amount, so be sure to tell them about your 
casual-Friday dress code or the monthly cookie party you hold for the staff. 
They’re interviewing you as much as you’re interviewing them.
Create a short list of acceptable candidates, review it with any staff who were 
involved in the interviews, and offer the job to the top person immediately.
Drafting an employment contract
Develop a contract that sets out, at minimum:
 
✓ Conditions of employment and its termination
 
✓ Conditions of leaves (sick, maternity, personal development), advance-
ment, and similar matters as they relate to working in your enterprise
 
You may also want to include the full job description in the contract. If you 
do, be sure to also give your new hires copies of their job descriptions sepa-
rate from their contracts — employees are likely to refer to their job descrip-
tions more often than they will their contracts, so a separate copy of the job 
description will come in handy.
The contents of the contract should be discussed during the hiring interview, 
and the new hire should receive a copy and be given a chance to discuss 
it further. Both you (the employer) and the new employee should sign two 
copies of the contract; give one copy to the employee and keep the other in 
your files.
 
LawDepot (www.lawdepot.com) offers free detailed advice on preparing con-
tracts as well as samples of contracts that you might want to create. It also 
provides sample employment offers, employment termination letters, and 
many other helpful samples of business documents.

Managing and Training Paid Staff
Managing staff is a huge subject — people get MBAs and PhDs in this stuff — 
so we can’t tell you all there is to know about management in this chapter. 
Hundreds of books have been written on the topic. So, after you read this 
chapter, we recommend you check out Managing For Dummies, 2nd Edition, 
by Bob Nelson, PhD, and Peter Economy (Wiley).
The five fundamental areas of management that are especially germane to 
social enterprises are planning, organizing, directing, monitoring, and train-
ing paid staff — and we cover these in the following sections.
Planning
Planning is so important and complex that we devote an entire chapter to the 
subject (Chapter 7). There we make the point that good planning in social 
enterprises revolves around their mission and goals. But after you’ve deter-
mined your official goals, remember to consider the following as you manage 
your employees:
 
✓ Who in the enterprise is assigned to do what to bring each goal to fruition?
 
✓ What kind of person or persons should be asked to reach each goal?
 
✓ How should these people work with your target of your benefits to 
achieve each goal?
In the course of managing your employees, you also want to consider how 
far your enterprise has come in realizing its goals. Ask yourself how your 
employees’ performance figures into your answers to these three questions:
 
✓ How long has it taken you to reach this point, and is that faster or slower 
than you had planned?
 
✓ How much more time will be needed to achieve those goals?
 
✓ Are there any ways of speeding up achievement of your goals?
Organizing
The good organization of work tasks is what will help you and your group 
meet your goals. Organization also leads to worker satisfaction and mini-
mizes employee burnout. Good, everyday organizing involves
 
✓ Identifying and assigning workable tasks for members of your enter-
prise to carry out: Workable tasks are those that a worker can 

271
 Chapter 17: Managing a Social Enterprise
accomplish with the skills and knowledge brought to the job, doing so in 
a time frame that allows the tasks to be carried out effectively and 
without stress.
 
✓ Finding and mobilizing the best people to do so.
 
Over-bureaucratization and bureaucratic bloat come from adding more orga-
nizational functions than required and/or more people to carry them out than 
needed. In other words, as you organize your tasks, don’t forget the merits of 
flat bureaucracy (see Chapter 13).
Directing
After you’ve organized your people, you need to give them some direction. 
People who’ve been mobilized to carry out a particular task — whether as 
individuals, members of a team, or part of a work group — must be told how 
to do it. In some cases, you can achieve this kind of direction through written 
instructions (for example, a manual), but face-to-face explanation is the way 
it’s typically done — especially for tasks that are somewhat complex.
 
Be sure to provide all the information your employees need to complete the 
tasks they’ve been assigned. Share with your workers your hard-earned tricks 
of the trade and talk about effective shortcuts, ways to work smarter, and 
tried-and-true ways of meeting deadlines. Be sure to tell them where the tasks 
they’re working on fit in the larger picture of how the enterprise functions and 
pursues its goals. Give constructive criticism of people’s performance at those 
tasks and don’t forget to pile on the praise when they do a good job.
Monitoring
When the individual, group, or team gets to work on the assigned task as 
directed, you (or someone you assign) must monitor the progress toward the 
task’s completion. We’re not saying you should be an overbearing microman-
ager (someone who obsesses over every detail of the work of others). Your 
monitoring doesn’t even have to be intense, especially if you have confidence 
in the workers you’re managing.
 
Part of the art of management is deciding how much looking-over-the-shoulders-
of-workers is necessary. Too little monitoring, and you risk losing control. 
Too much, and you can annoy your workers and maybe even shake their self-
confidence, both of which can reduce their motivation to perform well.
Annual performance reviews of work performance are probably the most 
formal kind of monitoring. You or other managers should review the perfor-
mance of all employees at least once a year. Create written evaluations to 

272
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
be filed away, but be sure to talk with each employee face to face about his 
performance review. Make sure the employee agrees with everything in the 
review, and both of you should sign it. Performance reviews can become the 
basis for promotion and pay raise decisions, as well as the difficult task of 
terminating employees.
Use the reviews as a chance to get feedback on the management of the orga-
nization as well. Reviews are two-way streets — they’re more than just a 
chance for you to tell employees everything they did wrong this past year. 
Use the review to show employees how their work helped the organization 
achieve a larger success, but also be constructive in your criticism of things 
they could do to improve in the future.
 
Schedule and honor the dates for reviews. Some employees get tense and ner-
vous when the date of a much-anticipated review passes by silently. Be proac-
tive in scheduling the reviews and make it a fun and worthwhile experience for 
everyone involved.
 
For much more information on conducting these kinds of reviews, check out 
Performance Appraisals & Phrases For Dummies, by Ken Lloyd, PhD (Wiley).
Training paid staff
Training paid staff is another important managerial function. Most people 
have some formal training — through a university, trade school, or spe-
cial high school program. They may have undergone on-the-job training in 
another organization or taken one or more courses through a continuing edu-
cation program. The job with your enterprise has unique features, though, so 
you’ll need to do at least some training.
You might require the workers to take a formal course or program of 
courses, work with a mentor or coach, or engage in some self-education 
through reading manuals or books, to mention a few possibilities. You may 
have to give the needed training yourself.
 
Depending on your organization’s function, the staff may be required to 
undergo formal training from an outside education provider. Plan for these 
expenses in your annual budget and ask staff members to take notes. Over 
lunch or a staff meeting, staff members can return and give brief overviews of 
the items covered and learned in the training.

 Chapter 17: Managing a Social Enterprise
Recruiting Volunteers
Volunteers work for social enterprises out of different motives than paid staff 
(see Chapter 3 for more on volunteers) and must be managed differently (see 
the next section for more on this). But recruitment procedures often start 
out similarly for both categories of workers. As described earlier, you need 
to start by describing your volunteers’ roles — the tasks they’re supposed to 
carry out.
Create detailed volunteer “job” descriptions in summary form that you can 
disseminate through various media to attract potential recruits. Instead of 
a job announcement, this is known as your call for volunteers. As with paid 
positions, the Internet is the obvious place to start.
 
Put the call for volunteers on your own Web site.
You want to circulate your call for volunteers wherever you think it might 
pay off, but because most if not all of your volunteers will be local people, 
you should also place notices of volunteer positions with local (or regional) 
volunteer centers. A volunteer center is a local nonprofit organization whose 
goals include promoting volunteerism as well as coordinating, recruiting, 
placing, and recognizing volunteers. A modern volunteer center almost cer-
tainly has a Web site as well as a physical location where hard-copy lists and 
descriptions of volunteer work are available for walk-in inquiries.
Dealing with unions
Many if not most social enterprises have little 
or no direct contact with organized labor. 
That’s because the majority of social enter-
prises are nonprofit groups employing so few 
paid employees that unionization would result 
in scant benefit for either party.
Large social enterprises with many paid 
employees, however, may become unionized. 
For example, the Red Cross in the United States 
must work with the unions who represent its 
front-line blood-drive event workers. If you’re 
managing a large social enterprise, you have 
to strive, through negotiations with unions, to 
harmonize unionized-employee interests with 
the enterprise’s goals.
Look ahead and try to avoid generating worker 
dissatisfaction so that unionization is not seen by 
employees as the only remedy to their grievances.
Remember: When you’re running a socially 
conscious business, you have to be more sen-
sitive to union concerns than other types of 
businesses have to be. Your organization’s goal 
probably has something to do with alleviating 
human difficulties, so you need to be especially 
alert to difficulties that crop up within your own 
confines.

274
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
 
VolunteerMatch.com is a Web site that helps organizations meet potential 
volunteers.
 
Look for volunteers who fit, so as to avoid burnout (see the “Avoiding burn-
out” section, later in this chapter). Ask trusted members of your enterprise 
about possible recruits to volunteer posts, and then have them help you 
screen for the best candidates.
 
Unlike in paid employment, contracts are uncommon for volunteers. If you 
were to put a contract in front of your volunteers, you’d give the impression 
that the commitment (on their part and on yours) was greater than it really 
is. When contracts are signed by the volunteer and the organization, they 
usually amount to no more than a list of responsibilities formally agreed to 
by both parties.
Managing Volunteers
Organizations that engage volunteers commonly treat them as if they were 
paid staff. But managing volunteers is an entirely different job. Here are sev-
eral critical reasons why you need to manage your volunteers as volunteers 
rather than as paid staff:
 
✓ Volunteers can much more easily say “I quit” than paid staff can, 
because they aren’t dependent on the money they earn from the 
position. Volunteers are pursuing a leisure activity (see Chapter 3) — 
they’re doing something they want to do because they like it. If a vol-
unteer in your enterprise starts to find the work disagreeable, she’ll be 
inclined to look for leisure activities elsewhere.
 
✓ Because they receive no pay, volunteers expect some nonmonetary 
rewards. The rewards experienced by serious leisure participants 
include the following:
 
• Personal enrichment from cherished experiences
 
• Self-actualization through the development of skills, abilities, and 
knowledge
 
• Self-expression using the skills, abilities, and knowledge they’ve 
already developed
 
• Enhanced self-image by becoming known to others as a particular 
kind of serious leisure participant
 
• Self-gratification via a combination of enjoyment and satisfaction — 
also known as fun or, for the slightly more hip, flow
 
• Re-creation or regeneration of oneself, often especially gratifying 
after an obligatory workday

275
 Chapter 17: Managing a Social Enterprise
 
• Social attraction by associating with other serious leisure partici-
pants and in the social world of the activity
 
• Group accomplishment derived from a sense of helping with a 
group effort in accomplishing a serious leisure project
 
• Contribution to the community, including senses of helping, being 
needed, and being altruistic
 
 Some people volunteer for less than purely altruistic reasons. One 
such reason is to gain experience in an area that will lead eventually to 
a paying job. They may be hoping to put their volunteer work at your 
enterprise on their résumé and may later even ask you for a letter of 
reference. Although their motives differ from those volunteers who are 
serving for more purely altruistic reasons, their contributions can still 
be valuable.
 
 Paid staff would like to experience these rewards, too, but that’s uncom-
mon in the modern workplace because the typical job today fails to 
meet the six criteria of occupational devotion (see Chapter 3). Paid staff 
stay on, by and large, because they’re attracted by the money they 
make, and equivalent work may be hard to find elsewhere.
 
✓ Because they’re substantially motivated by altruism, compassion, and 
urgency, volunteers are more inclined to persevere when the going 
gets tough than paid employees are. As we note in Chapter 3, such 
perseverance is a distinctive characteristic of their serious leisure. By 
contrast, some employees may be interviewing for jobs at competitors 
while having learned how to avoid work difficulties that demand perse-
verance. (Volunteers may even agree to do the work for the very oppor-
tunity to work directly with the founder, especially if that founder has a 
bold vision.)
In smaller social enterprises, managing volunteers commonly falls to the 
founding entrepreneur and later, possibly, to another senior leader. In larger 
enterprises this function is usually assumed by volunteer coordinators, who 
may themselves be volunteers or full- or part-time paid staff members. The 
volunteer coordinator’s job is to develop and run the organization’s volun-
teer program as well as supervise the volunteers working within it.
The role of the volunteer coordinator: 
Knowing what makes volunteers tick
In common with managers of paid staff, volunteer coordinators must con-
sider the four principles of planning, organizing, directing, and monitoring. 
But some additional features of volunteer management make it unique.

276
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
In organizations with lots of paid staff, the post of volunteer coordinator 
tends to be unsung and, at times, nearly invisible. The emphasis in such 
environments is on work and career, with volunteering commonly seen as 
a sort of adjunct or afterthought. One of your roles as the leader of a social 
enterprise is to prevent your coordinator from being marginalized in this 
way. If your group depends heavily, perhaps even exclusively, on volunteers, 
because they’re so central to its mission they must be managed in the best 
way possible.
 
The job of volunteer coordinator must, like the volunteer roles to be filled, be 
carefully defined.
Volunteers have their own personal needs that have to be addressed in their 
task descriptions, and your organization has needs as well. Because volunteers 
have the freedom to quit without financial consequence, you want to make 
sure to give them assignments that don’t conflict with their family life, their 
other serious leisure interests, or their moral principles. Serious leisure volun-
teers want to develop themselves, and they see their volunteer roles as a major 
route to this goal. Time and flexibility of duties, for example, are as important 
to a volunteer as they are to a paid employee, and that importance should 
never be offhandedly disregarded or dismissed by a volunteer administrator.
 
Volunteer coordinators need top-notch interpersonal skills. They have to get 
to know the volunteers in their charge in order to avoid tensions and 
disappointments.
One main reward of volunteering is its social side: Volunteers enjoy the 
contact they have with other people while they’re volunteering — and that 
includes the volunteer coordinator.
 
Believe it or not, we’ve known some volunteer coordinators who were insult-
ing, sarcastic, distant, angry, and underhanded when dealing with volunteers. 
If your volunteer coordinator exhibits any of these traits, he’ll definitely spoil 
the social side of volunteering — and you’ll lose plenty of good volunteers as a 
result.
Because of the altruistic component in volunteering, volunteers are signifi-
cantly more likely to be motivated by the enterprise’s mission than paid staff 
are. So, volunteer coordinators must be sure that volunteers are always kept 
informed of the mission, its associated goals, and any changes made to them. 
Accomplishing a group goal is a valued achievement for volunteers. The vol-
unteer coordinator needs to do everything possible to help volunteers feel 
part of achieving the group’s goals.

277
 Chapter 17: Managing a Social Enterprise
 
What happens when your volunteers are tasked with doing things that fall 
under the jurisdiction of your paid staff? Should the volunteer coordinator 
manage them in these situations? In this case, no. Always let your paid staff 
supervise the work of volunteers whose activities fall within their jurisdiction. 
Paid staff working in the same area as the volunteers tend to understand best 
the challenges of reaching organizational goals that they both face and the 
rewards that come from successfully meeting them. (See the nearby sidebar 
for more on helping your paid staff and volunteers work well together.)
 
As with the management of paid staff, the management of volunteers has been 
the subject of a great deal of writing. If you want to go deeper into this subject 
than we have the space for here, we suggest the book The (Help!) I-Don’t-Have-
Enough-Time Guide to Volunteer Management by Catherine Campbell and Susan 
Ellis (Energize, Inc.). The authors have considerable experience in this area, 
and as its title suggests, the book is especially helpful for volunteer coordina-
tors who also have other responsibilities in the enterprise — the lot of many 
entrepreneurs trying to run small or medium enterprises. Indeed, almost 
every entrepreneur faces this situation during the startup period.
Training volunteers
Your serious leisure volunteers will require the most substantial training. 
That means you can assign casual and even project-based volunteers much 
simpler tasks that take comparatively little time to learn. (See Chapter 3 for 
more on the different kinds of volunteers.)
 
Serious leisure means the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or vol-
unteer activity that people find so interesting and fulfilling that they launch 
themselves on a (leisure) career.
One of the rewards for the serious-leisure volunteer is self-development (the 
acquisition of new skills, knowledge, and experience). In social enterprises, 
training is one of the main ways this development occurs. Even before train-
ing begins, however, new volunteers need to be inducted into your enter-
prise, and the enterprise needs to be prepared for their arrival.
Create a code of conduct, or code of ethics, for volunteers in your enterprise 
and make sure volunteers learn it. This code may include statements about 
confidentiality, honesty, punctuality, taking breaks, and giving notice of 
intent to leave the volunteer post.

278
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
 
You can see a good example of a volunteer code of conduct on the Special 
Olympics Web site: www.area3specialolympicsva.org/files/
volunteer%20code%20of%20conduct.pdf.
Make sure your volunteers get a sense of the history of not just your enter-
prise and its range of services for your target of benefits. Don’t be afraid to go 
into the strengths and weaknesses of your enterprise. Obviously the volun-
teers are already interested, or they wouldn’t be volunteering.
 
Bring in some of your staff to share with the volunteers their own perspectives 
on the enterprise and its mission.
Can’t we all get along? Helping your staff and 
volunteers work together
A major area of potential friction in social enter-
prises with large groups of paid staff and volun-
teers are the relations between the two. And a 
major managerial concern in nonprofit groups 
and volunteer programs is to develop smooth 
working ties and mutual respect between paid 
staff of the larger organization and participants 
in the volunteer program. Friction between the 
two groups can arise on occasion. When it 
does, the volunteer coordinator and manage-
ment as a whole should stamp it out as quickly 
as possible.
Reward staff who work well with volunteers. 
It may not always be possible to do this with 
money (as in a bonus), but good work should 
be prominently noted on the employee’s annual 
performance review, acknowledging her spe-
cial value to the enterprise.
Volunteers can’t be disciplined as paid staff 
sometimes must be. You can fire them, but short 
of that, it’s impossible to force them to work 
extra hours or dock their pay. With volunteers 
you have to handle disciplinary problems more 
informally, such as through discussion, negotia-
tion, compromise, and similar accommodations. 
Frequently, volunteers in trouble in these ways 
are unaware that they’re in the wrong, which 
can often be traced to inadequate training or 
supervision.
Because volunteers tend to not follow a regular 
or full-time schedule, be mindful when assign-
ing a volunteer a time-dependent task. Be clear 
with them that this needs to be done by a cer-
tain date in case they aren’t able to finish it 
within the time allotted.
Some problems rest on a personal incompat-
ibility with the volunteer activities to which the 
individual has been assigned — which was 
your job as manager to avoid, right? For exam-
ple, it’s possible that a volunteer has little taste 
for certain activities, finds them boring, lacks 
the required skills or knowledge, or is unable to 
do them at a level that meets her expectations.
College students may be able to earn col-
lege credit for their volunteer work with you. 
Embrace this option, and contact your local 
university and colleges for possible volunteer/
college-credit programs. These programs could 
become a perennial source of good volunteers.

279
 Chapter 17: Managing a Social Enterprise
Let staff who will be working with the volunteers help design volunteer training 
programs. Ensure that all staff know how to properly and effectively use the 
volunteers with whom they’ll be working, and that volunteers know the staff 
have received these instructions. If you have one, you should ask your volun-
teer coordinator to look after such training. Otherwise, you or a manager must 
do it. In general, this involves familiarizing staff with their volunteers’ strengths 
and weaknesses (such as education, background experience, and time limita-
tions) and with the points on morale we cover in the next section.
Volunteers should understand that they can ask questions of and challenge 
the staff about the volunteer work. Likewise, you should inform new vol-
unteers about the basic responsibilities of the staff they’ll be dealing with. 
Managing volunteers is an opportunity for a staff member to demonstrate 
managerial skills and potentially move on to a formal management role.
Be sure to tell new volunteers, where relevant, about the volunteer program’s 
policies concerning liability and management of risk. Some volunteer roles 
may be hazardous — for example, if they’re working in a disease-infested or 
violent environment, or if they’re subject to extreme weather. You and your 
board of directors (if you have one) must formulate policies of this sort. 
Regularly update the policies in light of new information bearing on organiza-
tional and personal risk and liability.
Serious leisure volunteers are usually subject to routine evaluation, some-
thing they should be made aware of. Let them know how those evaluations 
will be conducted. It doesn’t have to be as formal as the employee perfor-
mance reviews we mention earlier in this chapter, but you can use those as a 
springboard for considering volunteer performance.
Whipping Up Morale
Part of managing a team — whether paid staff, volunteers, or a mix of the two — 
is generating and maintaining high morale (the positive sense of optimism 
and achievement). You can do this by keeping your organizational and team 
goals visible, giving constructive feedback on performance, recognizing and 
rewarding people when they do a good job, and avoiding burnout. In this sec-
tion, we show you how.
 
One easy way to get the ball rolling on raising morale is to encourage every-
one to express new ideas for running the enterprise and reaching its goals, as 
well as to give feedback on how they the feel present arrangements are work-
ing. A suggestion box is one classic way to accomplish this. But if relations are 
warm among staff and volunteers, face-to-face discussion is the more effective 
and personally rewarding way.

280
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
Keeping goals visible
Getting lost in the minutiae of the everyday running of a social enterprise is 
all too easy. There are countless details associated with keeping it going: the 
demands of immediate events, the effects of external forces, and the naviga-
tion of interpersonal exchanges all day long. In the midst of day-to-day activi-
ties, your enterprise’s goals may get pushed aside — at least in the minds of 
your staff and volunteers.
 
What can you do to keep the mission clear at all times? Here are a few ideas:
 
✓ Create and hang posters that spell out the mission and goals of your 
enterprise throughout the work space. They should be unobtrusive and 
attractive, but visible from almost anywhere. The idea is to ingrain these 
words into the workday, into the very environment in which people 
work, so no matter what’s happening, the enterprise’s main purpose is 
never forgotten.
 
✓ Talk about the mission and goals frequently in one-on-one and group 
meetings of staff and volunteers. Don’t worry about repeating yourself — 
you need to. Incorporate the mission and goals into broader discussions 
about, say, recruitment practices, media policies, or choices of funding 
sources. This repetition not only reminds your staff and volunteers of 
the importance of your mission and goals, but it also places the mission 
and goals in different contexts that are readily graspable and real.
 
✓ Bring up the mission and goals even during informal interactions with 
staff and volunteers. You can easily slip in a reference or two to one or 
more goals while engaging in light shoptalk at an organizational picnic, 
holiday party, or after-hours get-together with them at a nearby bar or 
restaurant.
 
✓ Ask individual paid staff and volunteers to review, however briefly, 
the enterprise’s goals every day. Printing up and distributing small 
cards entitled something like “What are we here for?” with the goals 
listed below can serve as a quick reminder of what the social enterprise 
is trying to accomplish. Conspicuously placed in offices or work spaces, 
this notice can work wonders in keeping all personnel pointed in the 
direction of your mission.
Giving constructive feedback
Don’t forget that your serious leisure volunteers and paid staff are all striving 
to improve themselves through their assignments in your social enterprise. 
In effect, both groups are looking for personal enrichment, self-actualization, 

281
 Chapter 17: Managing a Social Enterprise
and self-expression (see Chapter 3). Giving them constructive feedback 
on how well they’re doing in their assignments helps them realize these 
rewards.
Constructive feedback consists of two main components:
 
✓ Content: The pointers and helpful criticism you give to employees or 
volunteers must be useful — they have to be able to use this feedback to 
actually improve. That means your feedback should be clear, detailed, 
and logically presented. You don’t want to say, for example, “You must 
do this task better.” Instead, set out clearly what the person has to do, 
step by step if necessary, to perform the task better.
 
✓ Style: Your feedback should be delivered in a friendly, well-meaning 
tone, whether it’s written or oral or both. The spirit of the feedback 
suggests that you care about both the enterprise and the volunteer or 
employee. If you’re angry or indifferent in your delivery of feedback, 
volunteers and staff may come away from such exchanges knowing 
more about your mood than they do about the deficiencies in their own 
performance.
Recognizing and rewarding 
people for a job well done
So, some variables are beyond your control. One thing that is within your 
control is the way you recognize and reward your paid staff and volunteers. 
Recognition and reward are both motivating, and both encourage personnel 
to perform well and stay with your enterprise.
Recognizing achievements
Recognition hinges on the fact that your volunteers and paid staff want to 
feel that they’re contributing to the enterprise and its mission. Recognizing 
people for their contributions is critical.
 
Here are some ways you can give this recognition to your staff and volunteers:
 
✓ Present individuals with certificates, plaques, or letters acknowledging 
their contributions over a certain period of time.
 
✓ Hold an across-the-board recognition in the form of a dinner for all 
personnel who have served for one, three, five years or however 
long is appropriate to your situation. Note: Although this approach 
expresses appreciation and recognition, it doesn’t address individual 
contributions, which you still need to do in some way.

282
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
 
✓ Call good personnel into the office individually to tell them how well 
they’re performing and how valuable they are for your enterprise. 
You don’t have to give this informal pat on the back in the formal envi-
ronment of the office — you can do it at any time and any place.
 
 Of course, the formal annual review may well contain what amounts to 
pats on the back (see “Monitoring,” earlier in this chapter for more on 
performance appraisals). But positive feedback where merited should 
come far more often than once or twice a year. You should give it when-
ever people are doing a great job.
 
✓ Pay compliments for a particular job well done. You can do this any-
time that seems appropriate — in an office, while alone together, in a 
team or general meeting. It doesn’t have to be long-winded. “Mary’s fine 
work on the fundraising project has enabled us to . . .” (spoken during a 
meeting) would be great. The point is to be sure to compliment where 
compliments are due. They’re greatly appreciated.
Rewarding people for a job well done
Rewarding means giving people something of monetary value. Recognition is 
great, but money talks.
 
How can you reward the paid staff and volunteers in your enterprise? Here are 
some suggestions:
 
✓ For paid staff, a raise in pay is the ultimate reward.
 
✓ Reward paid staff with bonuses at the end of the year. Don’t feel like 
you have to give bonuses every year. Do what you can — even small 
bonuses are appreciated.
 
✓ Give gifts of significant monetary value, such as artwork, gift certifi-
cates, tickets to a play or a game, books, or a free trip somewhere. 
Make sure it has real value — a plate of home-baked cookies, however 
delicious, doesn’t quite cut it. This reward works for paid staff and 
volunteers.
 
Volunteers are, by definition, eligible only for the third type of reward. They 
aren’t in it for the money, anyway. The most rewarding of all, for them, is a 
good volunteer experience as they define it. Gifts can never equal this.
Avoiding burnout
No matter what kind of organization you’re running, it’s common for people 
to get burned out — they’re physically and emotionally exhausted because of 
the long-term stress, frustration, and excessive obligation they face at their 
jobs or volunteer roles.

283
 Chapter 17: Managing a Social Enterprise
For volunteers, the leisure character of the volunteering undergoes a meta-
morphosis — it slowly becomes an overbearing obligation and takes on a 
work-like quality instead of pleasure or fulfilment. In social enterprises, burn-
out invariably also leads to a substantial reduction in a person’s compassion 
for the target group — which is the biggest loss of all.
Burnout among paid staff commonly stems from being given more respon-
sibilities than the exhausted worker can effectively handle in the time avail-
able. Often, when burnout is an issue, the increase in responsibilities is not 
accompanied by a raise in pay, even though more hours of work may be 
demanded by the employer. But the burnout of paid staff is not usually the 
compassion burnout of volunteers. Most staff work for social enterprises 
because they need and like the job.
 
Whether with paid staff or volunteers, you want to do everything possible to 
avoid burnout. The good news is that wise management can go a long way 
toward controlling the conditions that lead to burnout. Here are some sugges-
tions you can try to keep your volunteers and paid staff from burning out:
 
✓ Know your personnel. Learn as much as you can about each employee 
and volunteer, and write it down. The more you know about a person’s 
skills, knowledge, and experience, the better you’ll be able to find the 
best fit between that person and his role in the enterprise, lessening the 
chance of burnout.
 
✓ Be realistic about expectations. Assignments for employees and vol-
unteers need to be manageable. Ones that are too difficult, too compli-
cated, or too large risks burning someone out.
 
✓ Use committees to spread out responsibilities and involve different 
people in everyday operations. Committees are a good testing ground to 
see how much work is involved for a volunteer assigned to a committee.
 
✓ Be clear in what you ask for. Your paid staff and volunteers should 
know what you think they can do and what you think they’re good at. 
There shouldn’t be any ambiguity. Write it down and talk about it face-
to-face with new employees and volunteers to get their buy-in.
 
✓ Issue plenty of reminders about when things are due, and check in 
often. Whether by phone or e-mail or face-to-face, make sure you know if 
someone has fallen behind in time to catch up and help that person get 
back on track. Give constructive feedback that will remedy the situation. 
Or, better yet, get someone help before he fails.
 
✓ Highlight the importance of any project you’ve assigned. Everyone 
wants to be valued.
 
✓ Be a role model. For example, demonstrate through your own work 
habits a reasonable pace for meeting responsibilities and an ability to 
maintain a cool head while doing so.

Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
Managing the Finances
Financial management (administering income and expenses) is very complex 
in large, paid-staff nonprofit and for-profit organizations alike. In small enter-
prises, financial management can be very simple, primarily because there is 
seldom much money to manage.
Regardless of the size of your enterprise, you need a treasurer, even if (in 
extremely small groups) it’s someone who informally fills that function.
Putting your treasurer to work
Treasurers are appointed or elected (depending on the system of governance 
at work in the enterprise) to administer the funds. In practice, treasurers 
receive revenues and donations sent to the group and then use them to pay, 
for example, wages and bills.
In smaller enterprises, the treasurer also keeps the enterprise’s accounts: 
a monthly list of the money, goods, and services received; its expenditures; 
and other payments made to outside receivers. The treasurer balances the 
credits and debits on the two sides of the financial ledger.
In larger organizations, the income and outflow of money, goods, and ser-
vices is so complicated that an accountant is usually hired to keep track of 
them. Smaller organizations often use accountants to verify the treasurer’s 
work, typically at the end of the fiscal year.
Being closer than anyone in your enterprise to the flow of cash in and out, the 
treasurer is likely to become a sort of financial advisor as well. Treasurers can 
say, “Wait a minute, we can’t afford that.” They can say, “We can afford this 
because at the end of next month, certain large bills will have been paid.” In 
other words, before spending money, consult your treasurer. Definitely consult 
your treasurer if you’re having thoughts of giving pay raises and bonuses to 
paid staff and gifts of significant monetary value to volunteers.
 
Managing finances and people are intimately entwined. If the treasurer advises 
effectively about the use of money, there may be enough for raises, bonuses, 
or gifts, thereby easing some managerial concerns about motivation. There 
may even be enough to hire more paid staff or engage more volunteers, head-
ing off possible burnout among present personnel.
 
Needless to say, there are limits to what a treasurer can do. Treasurers have 
little control over revenues — they just record what comes in and goes out. 

285
 Chapter 17: Managing a Social Enterprise
Attempts at generating new revenue and keeping current sources from dete-
riorating usually fall to someone else in your enterprise, most commonly the 
board of directors (see Chapter 14). Treasurers only advise — their advice 
can be ignored by others who have the power to authorize expenditures. If 
this happens, the treasurer is forced to duly note those expenditures, even 
though he’d rather not.
Cutting costs
The treasurer is at the center of your enterprise when it comes to advising on 
how to reduce costs and on how to make your money go as far as possible. 
The treasurer knows better than anyone else how much money the group 
has, how much will probably be received, and how much will have to be 
spent paying bills and financing projects. But unless your treasurer is some-
how intimately involved with every operation in your enterprise (an impos-
sible requirement in large organizations), she likely doesn’t know where 
costs can be cut while still retaining optimal effectiveness in reaching the 
enterprise’s goals. The people who know best what could be cut are the ones 
routinely working in a particular operation.
 
For example, in an enterprise whose mission is to interest children in the fine 
arts, the person responsible for the media-based publicity of its programs may 
have a good idea where money could be saved without seriously reducing the 
effect of the publicity. Maybe publicity expenditures in a certain newspaper 
could be cut, because few parents or teachers who are interested in the fine 
arts actually read that paper. Or maybe Internet advertising is now more effec-
tive than TV advertising, and a savings could be found by switching to the 
former. These details aren’t the kind that treasurers are normally familiar with.
 
Try to schedule regular meetings between your treasurer and various leaders 
in your enterprise. Doing so raises the chances of finding great ways of cutting 
costs, and also integrates your treasurer better in the organization.
 
Try to keep the goal of reducing costs in perspective. Cost-cutting should not 
be the end-all and be-all of your organization. A good rule to follow is to reduce 
costs where the reduction would save money that could be used to pursue 
other organizational goals — but not where the reduction would weaken pur-
suit of one or more of those goals. Budget cutting sometimes becomes a goal in 
itself. Your enterprise has important social goals to accomplish, and too little 
money available for this purpose will eventually spell failure.

Taking a Hard Look at Your 
Managerial Ethics
As a manager, you need to set some ground rules for yourself about what 
you will and won’t do — for fairness and consistency’s sake if nothing else.
Ethics are a set of moral principles that serve as a guide to acceptable 
behavior — in this case, behavior related to social entrepreneurship and 
the management of people who work in your enterprise. Being ethical means 
doing the right thing according to ethical principles.
 
Business ethics is a huge topic we don’t have room to cover in much detail 
here. For a good read on the subject, see Managing Business Ethics: Straight 
Talk about How to Do It Right, by Linda K. Trevino and Katherine A. Nelson 
(Wiley), or Essentials of Business Ethics: Creating an Organization of High 
Integrity and Superior Performance, by Denis Collins (Wiley).
In this section, we briefly touch on three ethical issues around which prob-
lems frequently emerge in social enterprises: honesty, fairness, and avoiding 
exploitation of volunteers.
Talking the talk: Being honest 
with your team
Lying, cheating, stealing, and similar morally reprehensible behaviors are 
looked askance at in nearly all walks of life. But their presence in a social 
enterprise is especially disturbing. After all, your enterprise has come into 
existence based on its goal of correcting imperfect conditions, some of which 
may be morally wrong themselves. Dishonesty, especially by a social enter-
prise’s leaders, is extremely unsettling. It undermines the group’s mission by 
revealing that its leadership is hypocritical and two-faced, and it undermines 
morale among those who work for the enterprise.
Moral problems can occur in organizations of all kinds. Of course, many 
white lies are told sometimes to avoid, for example, hurting someone’s 
feelings or provoking discussion of a trivial matter. Sometimes a white 
lie is useful and justified; other times it’s useful but not justified, and still 
other times it’s neither useful nor justified. Because such minor dishonesty 
revolves around particular situations, all we can advise in general is to be 
sure that your own white lies are both useful and justified. Otherwise, here 
too, honesty is the best policy.

287
 Chapter 17: Managing a Social Enterprise
 
It may seem obvious that organizational leaders should be honest. But it’s also 
obvious if you’ve even glanced at headlines through the years that a number 
of leaders — including some high-profile people — choose the opposite ethical 
position.
Who’s the fairest of them all: Treating 
your team members fairly
Fairness is probably a more elusive goal than honesty because what’s consid-
ered fair is often a matter of interpretation. In theory, people act fairly when 
they treat others impartially or equitably according to commonly held rules 
or standards. A main problem in applying rules or standards of fairness is 
that some people may feel that they’ve been applied inconsistently or out of 
ignorance of certain critical information. The manager accused of unfairness 
may disagree, arguing that she is consistent or is aware of the information.
The best advice we can offer is that you recognize that, as a leader in your 
enterprise, you may at times be called unfair. Do your utmost to avoid 
this charge, of course, but having made the effort, you may still arrive at 
an impasse with an employee or volunteer claiming that unfairness has 
occurred. At the same time, catering to any particular person because he’s 
crying foul may smack of favoritism. If a belief that favoritism has occurred 
gets around, it can undermine the larger organization.
Usually when one employee cries “unfair” about a policy or other employee, 
it’s because she wasn’t told about how she would be judged. For example, in 
giving a promotion to a recent but hardworking employee, a more tenured 
employee may complain or cry foul, thinking that the promotion should go to 
whoever had been there the longest. The problem in such a case is that the 
staff wasn’t told the criteria for how promotions would be given.
 
Watch out for your own communication failures in not explaining (or even 
realizing you need to explain) something to the team. Don’t assume everyone 
holds the same virtues and values as you do. Be clear with everyone about 
your expectations, which should be set out in the contract and job description 
(see “Drafting an employment contract,” earlier in this chapter).
 
Favoritism can cause no end of resentment among the employees of an enter-
prise. It can spawn the poisonous feeling that however well a person does 
his job, it makes no difference — instead it is the person’s “connections” that 
count. The perception that some people have ties to the people in manage-
ment (such as you) who can elevate their chances for promotion and reward, 

288
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
and some don’t, must never be allowed to exist. Morale can slip, and the next 
area to be hit could be employee productivity as members of the enterprise 
give up striving for excellence.
 
When all is said and done, if you’ve done your best to show fairness to every-
one who works under you, then you can, with a clear conscience, stick to your 
position.
Making sure you’re not exploiting 
your volunteers
By exploitation of volunteers, we mean taking undue advantage of their altruism 
and their willingness to serve the enterprise. Many volunteer coordinators or 
managers have erred in thinking that the cheery cooperation of a particular 
volunteer signals that she has unbounded enthusiasm for the volunteer role. 
The coordinator then piles on more responsibilities, which volunteers often 
accept because they’re altruistic and want to serve. But that can’t go on 
forever.
All volunteers have other things to do in life, even if they’re retired from their 
careers and even if they truly love working in your enterprise. Many volun-
teers also volunteer elsewhere and engage in other serious leisure activities. 
Some have families, who make demands on their time. An all-too-common 
outcome of this situation is burnout among those volunteers who find it hard 
to say no. Don’t push volunteers too far or exploit their good will toward the 
enterprise.
 
Check in once a month with your volunteers to make sure that they see their 
responsibilities as manageable. Doing so shows not only that you’re concerned 
about keeping them from burning out, but also that you want to maintain the 
leisure quality of their volunteer experience (see Chapter 3 for more on leisure). 
Checking on stuff like this with your volunteers is particularly important during 
the first year or so that a person spends with your enterprise.

▶ Collaborating with your team

T
eamwork is one of today’s buzzwords and a highly prized one at that. 
Like motherhood and apple pie, teamwork seems to have no negative 
associations. It’s often viewed, especially in sports and management circles, 
as an unalloyed good.
Fair enough. For the most part in this chapter, we agree and consider team-
work in this positive light. But we also note those cases in which teamwork 
can become problematic.
 
A team is a small number of people (from two to a couple dozen) formed to 
work, often temporarily, in a joint effort to achieve an end. Teamwork refers to 
acting as a team, which means that many of the members must have comple-
mentary skills.
Whether members of the team work independently or interdependently 
(through collaboration, discussed later in this chapter) to help the team 
reach its goal is one teamwork variable in social entrepreneurship. Most 
teams in social entrepreneurial organizations work independently — that is, 
the members pretty much do their own thing as they work on their parts of 
the project — although they’re dependent on each other for the overall suc-
cess of the project they’re working on.

290
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
 
Three people working independently might make up a publicity team for their 
social enterprise. One of them contacts print and online media, another deals 
with radio and TV media, and the third sees to the design and printing of 
flyers and other promotional materials. Most, if not almost all, teamwork in 
social enterprises appears to be of this kind. Rarely is there the sort of team-
work typified by rigorous, interdependent roles, observed in sports teams.
Being a Team Player
Given that social enterprise teams around the world are overwhelmingly of 
the independent variety, being a team player boils down to carrying out as 
well as possible each individual role. Breaking it down a bit, being a team 
player means that the participant
 
✓ Has the required skill, knowledge, or experience to fill his or her role
 
✓ Is willing to do his or her best for the group
 
✓ Is willing to do so in a cooperative, pleasant manner
When such participation is a part of volunteering — when it’s leisure-based 
(see Chapter 3) — the desire to be a team player follows logically from the 
participant’s involvement.
When a person’s participation is obligatory — not leisure — then you can’t 
assume that the team member is naturally inclined to be a team player. It 
becomes necessary to monitor that person’s contributions to the group.
 
Playing on a school sports team is often a person’s first experience of being a 
team player. Trevor Dudley, a panelist on the African Economic Forum Panel 
(AEFP), once joked that he didn’t realize he was a social entrepreneur until a few 
years ago when he was given a grant by the Ashoka Foundation (www.ashoka.
org) for being a social entrepreneur. Dudley’s entrepreneurial mission is 
Is that a team or a committee?
Some may use the term committee for their 
teams. Independent teams could be considered 
committees, though the idea of a team implies 
that it’s generally a more temporary group than 
many committees are. A steering committee or 
hiring committee, however, would be tempo-
rary. We don’t think it matters much what you 
call your groups. If calling a working group a 
team instead of a committee gives it a certain 
cachet, go ahead. The idea is to inspire further 
its members to carry out the group’s assign-
ments and be proud of this involvement with 
your enterprise.

291
 Chapter 18: No Man Is an Island: Teamwork
called the Kids League, in which he uses sports to generate confidence and life 
skills in the children of Uganda. Many of these children live in poverty — often 
with the psychological consequences of prolonged civil hostilities. Dudley 
became concerned that, because Ugandan schools face considerable pressure 
to better the academic performance of their students, they’ve been cutting 
back on sports as part of their curricula. Dudley believes that if students don’t 
learn to be effective team players, they may not grow up to work with others 
cooperatively or become as competent at setting goals and acting as leaders.
Being a Coach: Managing Teams
Teams don’t exist in a void. They’re given their goals by someone, report 
back to someone, and have their results assessed by someone. In other 
words, teams must be managed. Most of what we have to say about the 
broader aspects of managing social enterprises is covered in Chapter 18. This 
section focuses on managing teams.
The basics of team management
Because individual team members sometimes tend to stray off in their own 
direction, you as the leader of the social enterprise may find it necessary to 
coordinate your teams. One way to do this is to assign a team leader or cap-
tain; this person may be you or someone else, and she may or may not be a 
member of the team. A team leader must, of course, be able to work well with 
others and have a decent understanding of the team’s purpose.
To assess how the work of the team is going, you want the team to meet regu-
larly. Use agendas to track items and updates. There is an old saying, “You 
can’t manage what you can’t measure.” So, critical items, tasks, and to-do’s 
should be measured, and regular meetings help you do that. Holding regular 
meetings also helps with setting goals and deadlines and coordinating fund-
raising campaigns.
If used sparingly — not so many meetings that they become a burden — team 
meetings can be motivating in and of themselves. In the meetings, mem-
bers learn not only what teammates have accomplished toward the team’s 
purpose, but also about problems encountered and the effectiveness of the 
solutions invented to meet them. Team meetings are social gatherings and 
they’re often occasions for storytelling, in which members recount inter-
esting experiences in carrying out team goals. This camaraderie helps to 
develop a sense of progress toward realizing the team’s purpose.

292
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
 
Team progress should be documented, but the documentation doesn’t always 
have to be formal. Teams and their members must be accountable for what 
they do in the name of the team, but often reviewing the accomplishments of 
each member suffices as a record of the team’s work (as in the publicity team 
we gave as an example in the introduction to this chapter).
For some teams, documentation is more critical. For example, a team formed 
to examine the financial records of the enterprise should at least produce a 
report; indeed, some nonprofits are permitted by law to use such an informal 
audit procedure. Also, a team that’s sent into the community of the target of 
benefits to investigate their situation as it relates to the mission of the enter-
prise should keep a record of daily efforts and accomplishments, as well as 
write a report on their visit.
 
Daily records and final reports can be motivating, and anything that’s motivat-
ing makes team management easier. Records and reports are a kind of stock 
taking, giving feedback to players about how well they’re doing. Research on 
volunteers indicates that keeping records and reports plays a major role in 
whether volunteers remain interested in their assignments.
Firing up teams
When people talk about social entrepreneurs, they often say that social 
entrepreneurs must have a “passion” for what they’re doing. The passion you 
share with those working with you may well be the key driving force needed 
to see the enterprise through to success, over the many hurdles along the 
way. How do you communicate passion and fire up your teams?
What fires up teamwork is often a combination of
 
✓ Passion for the mission of the enterprise
 
✓ Compassion or sympathy for its target of benefits
 
✓ A sense of urgency about your goals
The advantage of teams is that they bring teammates together face to face, 
where they can share these feelings to spur each other on. Small social enter-
prises may be able to act as one team.
Large-scale social enterprises — especially those whose membership 
includes participants in a social movement, which can draw thousands of 
members — usually lack this interpersonal intimacy. Here, members are at 
best able to interact directly with only a small number of like-minded enthu-
siasts. Becoming a member of a team in this situation helps counteract the 
estrangement inevitably felt in vast entrepreneurial projects. Remaining fired 
up with passion and urgency for a cause is a lot easier if you’re routinely 
brought face to face with others of the same persuasion.

293
 Chapter 18: No Man Is an Island: Teamwork
 
Habitat for Humanity (www.habitat.org) is a social enterprise whose mis-
sion is to build decent, affordable housing for low-income families throughout 
the world. Each house is built by a team of volunteer builders and finishers, 
including the family whose application for housing has been accepted by 
Habitat. Along with this family, the volunteers contribute to the project 
according to their skills. Those lacking skills in construction who nevertheless 
want to help are trained by Habitat to, for example, frame walls, install roofing, 
or sand and paint interior surfaces. All people recruited to build a house func-
tion in a coordinated manner as a team — that is, they perform their skills at 
the appropriate time, when the structure being built by their teammates has 
reached the stage where they can use it (for example, when the structure is 
now ready for the plumbing to be installed, the drywall to be painted, and the 
carpet to be laid).
All team missions are urgent in some degree. Otherwise, there’d be no need 
to establish them. Nevertheless, the urgency of a team’s work may not always 
be evident to its newest members. Sure, in social enterprises formed to deal 
with natural disasters, health epidemics, and urban violence, for example, 
the urgency of the cause is obvious to all. But not so obvious is the urgency 
surrounding, say, improving reading skills, cleaning polluted air whose impu-
rities can’t be sensed without technical aid, or controlling largely invisible 
political corruption.
 
Sometimes you have to create, as much as possible, a sense of urgency for 
your teams. A high degree of urgency can galvanize a team into action, gener-
ating a corresponding level of excitement. New members have to be informed 
of the urgency of the team’s work, so that they’re inspired. Team leaders 
Sharing passion and urgency
Aseem K. Chauhan, chief executive of the Amity 
Innovation Incubator (www.amity.edu/
aii), places passion and making money in 
for-profit social enterprises in perspective. He 
believes that social entrepreneurship has to do 
with making money. Nonetheless, he says the 
best entrepreneurs are those who pursue pas-
sion over money. The money will follow if they 
follow their ideals. Chauhan holds that such 
people develop remarkable businesses and, of 
course, make money while doing so. Because 
of the depressed economy, many are searching 
for a business that they can quickly get under-
way through private investment or releasing 
an initial public offering (IPO), which is when a 
company issues common stock or shares to the 
public for the first time to generate capital. Not 
all these businesses will succeed in the long 
run. To succeed, Chauhan maintains that they 
must have not just passion but long-term vision.  

294
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
shouldn’t take for granted that all team members understand and share a 
sense of urgency. It’s up to the team leader to
 
✓ Present relevant facts and statistics on the urgent matter
 
✓ Show what might happen if the problem isn’t promptly solved
 
✓ Identify who or what conditions have created the critical problem
 
✓ Identify the team’s allies and resources and indicate how they can help 
deal with the problem
 
✓ Present a plan for solving the urgent problem in a timely way
 
Both passion and urgency can be contagious, spreading from team member to 
team member. Light a fire, and it’ll spread!
Using the Power of Persuasion
How do you get your teams to do what you want them to do? When working 
with volunteers, using persuasion and influence are generally more effective 
than using your power of authority. Sure, you could lay down the law and try 
to force them to do what you want. But you’ll get a lot farther if you convince 
them to see things your way.
When volunteers are persuaded by the reasoning of their leader that the 
course of action he wants them to take is effective and justified, volunteers 
become fired up. When colleagues are equals, influence is the only way of 
getting others to act in a certain way. But even where there are differences 
in power, you’re often better off trying to persuade the less powerful to do 
something than you are trying to force them with threatening consequences.
In Chapter 16, we examine the nature of charisma and the role of the char-
ismatic leader in social entrepreneurship. Charisma — the exceptional 
powers and qualities of a leader, beyond those of an ordinary person — 
where it exists, can be a potent basis for influence and persuasion on teams, 
especially in the early stages of an enterprise. Unfortunately, we’re not all 
charismatic. And what works to persuade and influence during one stage of 
development of your enterprise may not necessarily work in other stages.
 
The Social Enterprise Knowledge Network (SEKN; www.sekn.org) studied 
team leadership and concluded that every leader develops his or her own 
style to carry out the roles for each stage of an enterprise’s development. 
Mandatory formulas don’t exist. Different leadership styles respond more 

295
 Chapter 18: No Man Is an Island: Teamwork
effectively than others to management needs as the organization grows. 
Start-up processes are helped along by charismatic leaders exerting personal 
influence. During a later stage, social ventures benefit from managerial leader-
ship (see Chapter 17 for a discussion of managerial leadership).
 
Power is hierarchical authority to demand actions from others. It can be a 
mighty handy resource because it allows you to get people to do something 
they would prefer not to do, but that you want them to do anyway. When you 
use power — and you should use it only as a last resort — try to avoid its 
more caustic applications. Don’t insult, demean, or manipulate your team 
members. Refrain from sarcasm.
Collaborating with Your Team Members 
to Work toward a Common Goal
When you collaborate with other people, you work with them on a task or 
project. Teamwork is, by definition, collaboration. Collaboration happens 
through two types of teamwork:
 
✓ Independent teamwork: Independent teamwork involves team members 
working more or less on their own and coming together regularly to 
share what they’re doing.
 
✓ Interdependent teamwork: Interdependent teamwork involves routine 
coordination and, depending on circumstances, timing of individual 
actions. Sports like hockey and basketball are examples of interdependent 
teamwork.
More than the sum of its parts
A main hurdle faced by teams in the United 
States, and possibly some other countries, is 
bias toward individual performance in groups 
instead of toward true teamwork. A glance at 
how Americans, for example, honor the supe-
rior performance of certain star players on 
sports teams demonstrates this attitude.
The message in this for you is to try to com-
mend teamwork wherever it occurs, but also 
to recognize outstanding individual effort and 
accomplishment.

296
Part IV: Keeping Your Organization Running for the Long Haul 
Independent teamwork is — not surprisingly, given its name — less col-
laborative than interdependent teamwork. However, even in independent 
teamwork, individual contributions to the team’s goal are collaborative, in 
the sense that they result in an overall group accomplishment. In the public-
ity team example mentioned earlier in this chapter, a sense of collaboration 
is shared by everyone on the team when it becomes evident that, throughout 
the community, the enterprise’s visibility has risen noticeably thanks to the 
team’s efforts.
 
To undertake some team building in your social enterprise, try organizing a 
session of staff lunchtime slideshows where you show images of people bene-
fiting from your efforts. If you have a monthly newsletter, feature a different 
staffer every month describing his or her reasons for working for your organi-
zation. For a list of game and other activities designed to build teamwork, go 
to www.wilderdom.com, click “Index to Group Activities and Games,” and 
then select the team-building category.
Collaboration often involves team members sharing practical tidbits about 
how to accomplish the team’s goals. Useful tips, gained from experience, are 
passed along to others in team meetings to enhance their effectiveness.
Joining a team is one way to become empowered within a social enterprise. 
People become empowered by acquiring the power, authority, or license to 
do something. In teams, empowerment is limited by the need to collaborate 
with teammates in carrying out the team’s business. But just being part of a 
team, having a role in achieving its goals, can be empowering.
The special power of teams: Team idioculture
The social psychologist Gary Alan Fine once 
observed that small groups, including teams, 
whatever their size, generate their own idi-
ocultures (distinctive sets of shared ideas that 
emerge in small groups).
Because idioculture is local culture, devel-
oped within and as an expression of a small 
group such as a team, it consists of a system 
of knowledge, beliefs, behaviors, experiences, 
and customs peculiar to that group of people 
and shared by them. Members use this idiocul-
ture system when interacting with one another, 
expecting that they will be understood by other 
members.As a social entrepreneur, you should 
encourage and develop the power of team 
idioculture.

Empowering the target of benefits
One of the goals of your enterprise may be 
to empower your target of benefits, as in 
the example of Principia (see the sidebar, 
“Principia’s mutual healthcare,” at the end 
of this chapter). Professor Marie Lisa M. 
Dacanay is Program Director of Social and 
Development Entrepreneurship at the Asian 
Institute of Management (AIM) Asian Center 
for Entrepreneurship. One of the goals of AIM 
is to encourage practitioner-oriented research 
that produces practical and easily applicable 
results.
Dacanay’s work at AIM concentrates on 
empowering the poor and other marginalized 
people to benefit from their own social enter-
prises. She works with them to help them start 
and successfully run these organizations. 
Dacanay points out that the communities where 
the enterprises operate often experience posi-
tive social change, stemming from the fact of 
created jobs and an increased sense of well-
being among employers and employees.
As always, at their best, social enterprises 
become a catalyst for broader changes in 
the community. For more information about 
the goals and accomplishments of AIM, go to 
www.aim.edu.ph.
What does empowering the target of benefits 
have to do with teams in social enterprises? 
Well, the goal of teams is often just that — to 
produce results that empower those targets. 
The Principia example shows how this can be 
done in the field of healthcare. But empowering 
a target doesn’t always need to be reached by 
way of a team in a social enterprise. Dacanay’s 
work suggests that her enterprises foster 
empowerment of their targets through efforts 
of the entire entrepreneurial group.
 
Online tools, both the free kind and ones that cost money, are available for the 
social entrepreneur. Check out the free online wiki site PBworks (www.
pbworks.com), Huddle.net, Google Documents (http://docs.google.
com), ProjectSpaces (www.projectspaces.com), and especially Basecamp 
(www.basecamphq.com) for some terrific online collaboration action.
 
As an entrepreneur, you’re automatically the boss. Therefore, you’re empow-
ered (by yourself) to make decisions and proceed toward the goals of your 
enterprise. You’re also empowered to empower others, and a good way to do 
this is to form teams and give them goals to achieve.

298

Principia’s mutual healthcare
In 2005, following publication of a report by the 
National Health Service in Britain, a group of 
physicians formed a nonprofit social enterprise 
called Principia. Principia’s mission was to try 
to solve the critical problem of optimal delivery 
of local primary-care services. The services in 
place at the time were judged inadequate for 
the job. Something had to be done.
Early on, a member of Principia came up with 
the idea of mutual healthcare. In this model, 
patients — one target of benefits — would 
be empowered by the opportunity to say how 
services affecting them should be planned 
and delivered. The other target, the physicians 
attending these patients, would become empow-
ered to give more effective care and to perform 
their jobs with greater success. Principia formed 
a team to develop a workable response to exist-
ing government policy. This team strove to find 
ways that would enable fruitful collaborations 
between physicians, other healthcare profes-
sionals, and patients and their families.
Principia has been highly successful. It has 
since applied its model to dental practices, 
optometric and pharmaceutical care, and 
several other services established to promote 
healthy living.

M
aybe you’re coming to this book because you know you want to help, 
but you’re just not sure how or where. You want your life to matter. 
You want to make a difference. You’re just having trouble focusing on one 
problem when you see so many worthwhile causes competing for attention. 
We don’t blame you. In fact, we applaud you! You’re coming to this subject 
with your heart in the right place. But before you can start your enterprise, 
you need to get focused on one problem, one cause, one issue that you’ll 
work on.
In this chapter, we help you focus on ten key areas that are worthy of atten-
tion. We can’t tell you what kind of business you should run, but we can give 
you some background information on areas you may not have considered. 
Read this chapter and see if any of these areas catches your attention. Then 
use this as a springboard to find out more information on those subjects, 
until you find the one area that’s right for you.
You’ll find occasional overlap between the areas, which means that your 
enterprise could kill two or more problems with one stone.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Culture Clash: Solving Cultural 
Problems in Your Community
You can focus your enterprise’s efforts on your community’s culture — 
either on matters that are philosophical or that have to do with language, 
literature, history, or the arts.
A social enterprise aimed at addressing an ethical issue in, say health (the 
abortion question), education (teaching evolution), or politics (corruption) 
would be tackling a philosophical question. Trying to facilitate retention and 
use of a foreign language in your community and establishing an enterprise 
to reach this goal, for example, is a linguistic concern; the goal may be to 
preserve competence in and use of the mother tongue of immigrants living 
in a society dominated by English speakers. You may even set up a group 
to promote a genre of literature, underappreciated events in history, or the 
love of certain kinds of little-known music. The problem to be solved by these 
enterprises is to correct what you see as a critical lack of understanding of an 
important art or field of knowledge.
 
Think about what’s going on in your local culture. Do certain cultural prob-
lems keep cropping up in your community? Don’t be afraid to think outside 
the box. Each local culture is different. Maybe yours has a unique challenge 
that no social enterprise has addressed yet.

Social problems emerge around our use — or misuse — of the natural envi-
ronment: air, water, land, ice and snow, flora, and fauna. Climate change is 
also a growing environmental problem. Polluted air, water, and soil have 
long caused resource troubles and misery around the world, and numer-
ous social enterprises have sprung up to help remedy those concerns. But 
there is plenty of room for more action on this front. Pollution alone remains 
a vital area for entrepreneurial action, as does the conservation of natural 
resources.
For example, erosion is an important, if relatively unsexy conservational issue. 
It’s not the same process as pollution, but its results have a similar effect: 
depletion of the amount and quality of usable soil, especially for agriculture.

 Chapter 19: Ten Great Areas for Social Entrepreneurial Action
Water conservation, primarily for drinking, cooking, and industrial needs 
(including agriculture), is a growing challenge in many parts of the world. 
The need to conserve water goes beyond human supplies, extending to the 
supplies available in nature so that animals, plants, and trees may thrive. 
Even where water is plentiful, drawing it from lakes and rivers and providing 
it to people and industries that rely on it is often fraught with problems.
Questions of water purity and its additives (such as fluoride and chlorine) 
are also important ones we have to answer, and many social entrepreneurs 
are doing just that.
Protecting certain flora and fauna is ever more challenging due to the misuse 
of the environment, encroaching human habitation into previously wild 
areas, and the emerging effects of climate change. Efforts to identify and 
protect specific endangered species of fish, birds, and animals continue. 
Despite the good work done by big social entrepreneurial organizations like 
Greenpeace and the Sierra Club, we aren’t winning the battle on many of 
these issues, which means much work remains to be done. Greenpeace uses 
nonviolent, but confrontational, methods to expose global environmental 
problems. The Sierra Club mounts major national campaigns to generate 
change in several problems areas — among them health and the environ-
ment, protection of biodiversity, and transition to a sustainable economy.
But more work remains to be done in all these areas. You could be the one to 
do it!
Providing the Comforts of Home: 
Food, Clothing, and Shelter
What can you do as a social entrepreneur to make family and community life 
better in your part of the world (or elsewhere)? For example, you may want 
to raise the quality of life of a target group by providing improved lighting, 
heating, water, heating, housing, clothing, or food.
Many social enterprises are already at work in these areas. Some of the big-
gest ones include
 
✓ Habitat for Humanity, which provides housing to families in need. 
Habitat volunteers work alongside the future homeowners to build their 
new homes, and in turn for their sweat equity (working not only on their 
own homes but on the homes of others), the future homeowners receive 
the homes at a greatly reduced cost. They still have to provide a down 
payment and make monthly mortgage payments to Habitat, and Habitat 
uses those mortgage payments to build houses for other families.

304
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Oxfam, which works with people to secure their basic human rights. 
It believes that citizens of the world can end poverty and injustice by 
working together in solidarity to assert their basic human rights. People 
blocked from opportunity often need to change laws, customs, and 
policies. Without these changes, real progress against poverty can’t 
be achieved. Oxfam’s economic and political analyses help change the 
minds of powerful decision makers.
 
✓ The Salvation Army, which seeks to bring Christian salvation to the 
poor, destitute, and hungry by meeting both their physical and spiritual 
needs. It has a semi-military structure that operates to extend a reli-
gious ministry to all people, regardless of ages, gender, color, or creed. 
A main part of its mission is to advance the Christian religion. Although 
the Salvation Army started as a mission to alleviate poverty, it now has 
other charitable objects that are beneficial to society or to mankind as a 
whole.
 
✓ The Light up the World Foundation, which believes that economic and 
sustainable light and energy solutions can offer significant opportunities 
to impoverished individuals and their communities. Sustainable light 
and energy lead to advances in education, household safety, cleaner 
indoor living, and significant economic savings. For local distributors, 
sustainable light and energy products translate into livelihood and 
family support. Globally, these products contribute to reduced green-
house gases and other kinds of pollution.
Although these organizations are doing great work, they can’t do it all them-
selves. A lot remains to be done in the area of basic living standards. After all, 
if the big organizations had solved the problems, they wouldn’t be needed 
anymore, right?
 
You can use the successes of the big guys as a model for your own enterprise. 
You may start up an enterprise to solve problems in standard of living that 
they have yet to tackle. For example, water quality, which is both an envi-
ronmental issue and one of comfort at home, must always be tackled locally 
(because water quality differs from one community to the next), and it’s one 
problem crying out for entrepreneurial action. Another entrepreneurial area 
that may be ripe for consideration is controlling dangerous insects, plants, 
and animals where they threaten people. Perhaps there is more to do in your 
local area than a big organization could hope to tackle.
Heal Thyself: Tackling Health Problems
It’s no secret that healthcare is a major problem. Many Americans are unin-
sured and have limited access to quality care. If healthcare is your passion, 
you may want your social enterprise to hone in on this arena.

305
 Chapter 19: Ten Great Areas for Social Entrepreneurial Action
If you want to get involved in the healthcare field, you can focus your efforts 
in one of two main areas:
 
✓ Injuries and the chronic and infectious diseases: Here you might create 
an organization that fights cancer, heart disease, malaria, HIV, or various 
sexually transmitted diseases. Numerous social enterprises focus their 
efforts on this area of healthcare, but there’s plenty of work left to go 
around.
 
 Social enterprises can also be established to foster change and solve 
problems in lesser-known fields. You might consider starting an organi-
zation to promote medical use of an alternative form of treatment, such 
as using traditional herbs, vitamin therapy, massage, or even spiritual 
healing. Or you might work for the betterment of patients’ rights, closer 
physician-patient relations, or improvement in a particular community 
health facility.
 
✓ Preventive medicine: Here you would focus on ways to prevent people 
from getting sick in the first place. This area encompasses such diverse 
fields as personal and public sanitation, mental and physical fitness, 
nutrition, tobacco use, workplace health and safety, or other community 
health measures. Areas such as quality garbage collection, water qual-
ity, and safety in public transit could also be filed under this heading.
 
 Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) as well as various anti-smoking 
and anti-fluoridation groups exemplify social enterprises in preventive 
medicine.
Movement of the People: 
Migration and Immigration
The movement of people within and between countries has never been 
greater than it is today.
 
Migrants move within their society or country, whereas immigrants and refu-
gees move between countries. Refugees are distinguished from immigrants by 
the fact that they’re forced to move, typically through threats of death, tor-
ture, starvation, disease, and the like. People emigrate (become immigrants in 
another country) for less life-threatening reasons, though they’re still driven 
to find, for example, employment, live under a more acceptable political 
system, or join relatives who have already emigrated.
All these folks can use help wherever they can get it. Social enterprises are 
often established to help immigrants and refugees integrate themselves into 
their host societies, to try to alleviate racial and ethnic tensions that may 

306
Part V: The Part of Tens 
arise there, and, in some countries, to promote multiculturalism as a way 
of reducing these tensions. Many such enterprises operate locally, working 
directly with the newcomers. The United States is a land of immigrants, many 
of whom don’t always get fair treatment, which means plenty of opportunity 
is there for your social enterprise to target them.
Migrants, in part because they’re presumed to know their own country, are 
much less commonly targets of such help. The Welcome Wagon, a North 
American social enterprise that welcomes homeowners who are new to a 
community, has mostly served migrants. You might know of migrants in your 
community who could benefit from a social enterprise.
Ways of Living: Addressing 
Lifestyle Issues
Social enterprises have sprung up around a problem inherent in daily or 
routine living. Many social entrepreneurs hope to solve problems related to 
race, religion, birth control, consumption and consumer waste, the concerns 
of age groups such as youth and the elderly, and even leisure activities.
For example, you might organize to promote the importance of religion (or 
some aspect of a particular religion), to educate people on safe birth control 
and its methods, or to point out the wastefulness of our consumer ways.
Many social enterprises have been set up to help youth, people with disabili-
ties, and the elderly; some of these groups try to steer their targets toward 
fulfilling leisure activities appropriate to their age.
Other groups exist to advance a particular kind of leisure, usually educa-
tional. Consider the Share the Universe project of the Astronomical Society of 
the Pacific, whose mission is to promote amateur astronomy.
What lifestyle issues do you see as problematic in your community?
Working for a Living: 
Helping Folks Find Work
Work is, directly or indirectly, vitally important for almost all the world’s 
population. People need work for their livelihood, and, if they can’t get it, 
they need social entrepreneurs like you to help provide the goods and 

307
 Chapter 19: Ten Great Areas for Social Entrepreneurial Action
services that make their living possible. Often you’re dealing here with the 
question of right livelihood: What is a just wage and what are the proper 
working conditions for the employee on the job?
Social enterprises often spring up around the need for jobs. Small for-profit 
enterprises help provide job leads, and social entrepreneurial credit arrange-
ments often help finance these for-profits. You may be able to help solve 
problems in the workplace, too — for example, worker exploitation, work-
place health and safety, and worker health and pension plans.
 
Most labor unions started as social enterprises bent on solving such 
problems.
Blessed Are the Peacemakers: Working 
for Peace and Reconciliation
There is ample opportunity for entrepreneurial work intended to prevent 
or put an end to war, terrorist activity, torture, and the like. Amnesty 
International and the International Committee for the Red Cross famously 
serve in these areas.
 
Working in this area can be highly risky. Risk is something you have to con-
sider very carefully. Only you can determine what level of potential danger 
you’re comfortable with.
In general, you can probably have the greatest impact trying to promote 
peace and reconciliation by striving to eliminate the causes of conflict found 
in living standards, health, lifestyles, personal and community development, 
urban life, making a living, and the environment. Be aware, however, that 
enterprises in this area are often controversial. They may overlap political, 
spiritual, and social boundaries inside of which are some emotional differ-
ences in attitude and belief.
Back to School: Education and Personal 
and Community Development
Social entrepreneurs have created organizations that cover all types of 
formal education: primary through secondary, university, and technical. 
Many enterprises are devoted to adult and continuing education, as well as 
to civic education. Some organizations even teach people how to be good 
citizens.

308
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Social enterprises may focus on less formal personal development as it 
relates to community development. For example, one area is encouraging 
civic engagement (as in meeting civic obligations). This might include get-
ting out the vote in elections, keeping domestic property clean and neat, and 
beefing up lighting to make parking areas safe. Enterprises may be developed 
to stimulate community involvement or participation in any aspect of com-
munity life (such as singing in a community chorus, playing baseball in a 
city-wide league, and volunteering at a residence for the elderly). A social 
enterprise established to foster a certain kind of corporate social responsibil-
ity (see Chapter 8) constitutes yet another kind of community development.
Enterprises formed to solve governmental problems — for example, corrup-
tion, inadequate electoral representation, and weak representation of a politi-
cal point of view — also fit in this category.
The Big City: Alleviating the 
Problems of Urban Life
Cities generate a variety of problems that often, in turn, give rise to social 
entrepreneurship. Groups have been formed to reduce theft or violence 
(such as block-watch programs and organizations such as Guardian Angels, 
which enlists unarmed volunteers to patrol neighborhoods), to build new 
urban housing or reduce existing housing density, and even to foster a 
greater sense of community in cities, so that people know their neighbors 
and look out for one another instead of being indifferent.
Public transit has its own set of problems — including violence, robbery, lack 
of hygiene and cleanliness, and scheduling — which are capable of generat-
ing entrepreneurial action. Other urban services that operate in the spheres 
of health, recycling, trash collection, and leisure and recreation can also 
become causes for social entrepreneurs to take up.

Chapter 20
Ten Common Mistakes to Avoid
In This Chapter
▶ Managing to avoid managerial mistakes
▶ Averting organizational mistakes
▶ Looking out for outlook mistakes
▶ Avoiding mistakes in personal relations
U
nfortunately, the road to successful entrepreneurship has some sharp 
curves and big potholes, any of which are capable of seriously delaying 
you as you strive to reach your destination — which is fulfilling your mission. 
In this chapter, we put some orange cones up around these areas so you can 
steer clear and be on your way.
Overlooking Potential Leaders
You put yourself at a great disadvantage when you fail to recognize potential 
leaders in your enterprise.
 
Constantly be on the watch for individuals who show exceptional commitment 
to your mission, work well with others (especially the target of benefits), are 
able to take charge of a task or assignment, and show signs of leadership abil-
ity (see Chapter 16 for more on leadership). Manning such a “lookout” should 
be a routine procedure for you and other leaders in your enterprise; in fact, 
this senior group of leaders should regularly discuss which people may be 
admitted to their ranks.
 
Encouraging and promoting leadership from within your organization is key to 
building its future.

310
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Mismanaging Volunteers
Ineffective management of volunteers is another serious mistake when run-
ning nonprofit social enterprises. If you’re the one who personally manages 
volunteers, be sure to adhere as faithfully as possible to the principles set 
out in Chapter 17 — including carefully training, directing, and monitoring 
the efforts of your paid staff and volunteers in an ethical and honest manner.
If someone else manages your volunteers, you must, using these same prin-
ciples, routinely monitor him to make sure he’s managing the volunteers well.
Getting Too Bureaucratic
Over-bureaucratization is a common mistake that many entrepreneurs make, 
whether the enterprise is a nonprofit or a for-profit establishment. In Chapter 
13, we describe the many problems that the subtle process of creeping 
bureaucratization can create.
 
You have no choice but to be aware of this unwanted tendency toward more 
and more bureaucracy and do everything you can to counteract it. Make sure 
that other leaders and administrators in the enterprise also remain conscious 
of the perils of over-bureaucratization.
Incorporating When You Don’t Have To
Incorporating when incorporation is unnecessary is a more common mistake 
than many people realize. Why do businesses incorporate if they don’t have 
to? Because there’s something glamorous about having your own legally rec-
ognized enterprise, with its distinctive seal and, where possible and useful, 
its special charitable status expressed as a unique identification number. For-
profit entrepreneurs have no choice but to seek such incorporation — but 
many nonprofit entrepreneurs do have a choice.
Small social enterprises, usually those driven by a local mission, can accom-
plish their goals without becoming legally established. They can, among 
other things, establish and adhere to their own democratic procedures, col-
lect dues, develop a budget, hold annual general meetings, and still not be 
incorporated groups.

311
 Chapter 20: Ten Common Mistakes to Avoid
 
Before launching into the corporate form of organization, consider very care-
fully the advantages and disadvantages of incorporation that we set out in 
Chapter 14.
Failing to Spot Trends
You can easily get caught up in the routine operations of your enterprise — 
after all, they’re what move you along toward your goals. However, if you 
keep your head down too much and ignore the broader trends and social 
context affecting your enterprise, you’re likely setting yourself up for failure. 
In Chapter 5, we examine some of today’s important trends, including wom-
en’s issues, multiculturalism, and corporate social responsibility.
Important demographic changes may also be at work — for example, changes 
in age, sex, education, and ethnicity of your target population. You have to 
stay abreast of these changes and their effects on your enterprise.
Being Unrealistic about Funding
Research has shown that nonprofit groups are often unrealistic about fund-
ing. They’re inclined to think that finding money to support their enterprise 
and its mission is easier than it really is. So, when you’re seeking government 
or foundation grants, for example, go into it with a positive attitude, but don’t 
count on success.
Competition for funding is typically fierce, and granting programs may be 
fickle — they may change their requirements on short notice. By all means 
apply for funding, but have alternatives in mind in case you get rejected, 
because you often will be. Even raffles, auctions, bake sales, and so forth can 
have disappointing results.
 
To avoid facing impossible financial commitments, be realistic about the out-
come of any funding ventures.
Failing to Innovate
Failing to innovate is another grievous mistake — and a tricky one to boot. 
It’s tricky because, though you can’t really know it in advance, some inno-
vations turn out to be duds. Our advice: Constantly look for and carefully 

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
consider new ways of running your enterprise and trying to reach your goals. 
In fact, you can never improve too much in seeking ways to innovate. On the 
other hand, don’t make innovation your religion.
 
Change for change’s sake alone — by which we mean change merely to have 
something new in your enterprise — could be harmful to its health and to its 
mission.
Choosing the Wrong Name
In Chapter 10, we cover the ins and outs of choosing a name for your enter-
prise, and we caution against selecting a name that’s uninformative. Cutesy 
names that fail to quickly, clearly, and imaginatively reveal the nature and 
mission of their enterprises are all too common. What’s worse is when such 
mis-names actually suggest quite different entities than their leaders are 
trying to develop. Don’t follow examples of this sort (see Chapter 10).
Not Having a Good Web Site
In this digital day and age, being without a Web site can spell disaster for a 
social enterprise, no matter how small. More and more people are turning 
to the Internet in search of information, and they expect to learn about your 
organization online. True, some old-school enthusiasts who really want to 
track you down may persevere by turning to a phone book, social network, 
or other online resources that may mention you. But most would-be mem-
bers won’t be so motivated, which means you’ll lose them. In Chapter 10, we 
cover the minimum features your Web site should have.
Not Using the Media to Your Advantage
If you don’t take advantage of the media — and by media we include social 
media such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other similar services — 
you’re making a potentially big strategic mistake. In Chapter 12, we set out 
in detail various strategies and ways of harnessing the media to your entre-
preneurial advantage. Dealing with the media requires extra effort, to be 
sure, but it can also generate significant payoffs. Social enterprises and their 
missions require visibility. Media visibility brings the group to the attention 
of funding bodies and individual benefactors. It promotes the social cause of 
your organization and the need for change in a particular sphere of commu-
nity life. Finally, it can inspire people to join you in your work toward better-
ment of the target.

Appendix
Resources
M
ost of the resources we list in this appendix have either easily acces-
sible books or Web pages. Some are also mentioned elsewhere in this 
book. We’ve compiled them all here to provide a quick reference for you.
Before we dive into more specific categories of resources, we start you off 
with some important direct supporters of social entrepreneurs, including 
foundations, alliances, resource centers, and more:
 
✓ Ashoka (www.ashoka.org) is a nonprofit organization devoted to 
developing social entrepreneurship as a profession. So far, it has elected 
and supported more than 2,000 Ashoka Fellows in 60 countries.
 
✓ Authenticity Consulting’s Social Entrepreneurship Toolbox (www.
authenticityconsulting.com/npbd/toolbox.pdf) is a rich com-
pendium of many more social entrepreneurship resources, some of 
which are free, and some of which cost money. The site also lists several 
books and workbooks, consultants in the nonprofit area, and organiza-
tions on the Web.
 
✓ Business Exchange, an online service offered by BusinessWeek magazine 
(http://bx.businessweek.com/social-entrepreneurship) has 
an extensive section on for-profit social entrepreneurship. It covers a 
large range of subjects of interest to commercial social entrepreneurs.
 
✓ Echoing Green (www.echoinggreen.org) is another fellowship-
oriented nonprofit that supports social entrepreneurs. Whereas Ashoka 
Fellows are often high-profile figures, Echoing Green supports undiscov-
ered social entrepreneurs. The organization emphasizes seed funding 
for new organizations at their earliest stages.
 
✓ The Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship (www.schwab
found.org) does not give grants, but it supports social entrepreneur-
ship through research, publications, media, and organized events. 
Professor Klaus Schwab and his wife, Hilde, created this nonprofit, inde-
pendent organization in 1998 in order to promote social innovation.
 
✓ Serious Leisure (www.soci.ucalgary.ca/seriousleisure) has its 
own Web site at the University of Calgary. Here you can find out more 
about serious, casual, and project-based leisure. Articles 16, 17, and 21 
in the “Leisure Reflections” series in the Digital Library contain espe-
cially useful information on volunteers and volunteering.

314
Social Entrepreneurship For Dummies 
 
✓ The Skoll Foundation (www.skollfoundation.org) was created in 
1999 by Jeff Skoll, the first president of eBay. The foundation supports 
social entrepreneurs and related researchers in an attempt to build 
social-sector capacity and infrastructure. The foundation makes grants 
in excess of $40 million per year.
 
✓ Social Enterprise Alliance (www.se-alliance.org) is a membership 
network that advocates for social entrepreneurs, acts as an information 
and education hub (see its online Knowledge Center, which is open to 
everyone), and hosts the large and popular Social Enterprise Summit.
 
✓ Social Venture Network (www.svn.org) is a membership network, but 
is designed for “leading social entrepreneurs,” including CEOs and social 
investors. Its online Tools & Best Practices library is open to everyone.
The Foundation Center (www.foundationcenter.org) is another impor-
tant, terrific resource, which we discuss later in this chapter.
Finding Funding
Gifts In Kind International (www.giftsinkind.org) in the United States 
and In Kind Canada (www.inkindcanada.ca) represent in-kind funding, in 
which an organization matches contributions made by others. This type of 
funding can be of great benefit to social enterprises. Both organizations are 
devoted to making in-kind gifts to other charities, and both are nationwide 
charities whose mission is to provide smaller charities and nonprofits with 
access to practical resources typically available only to larger organizations.
One of the trickiest aspects of funding is writing grant proposals. For a 
deeper look into this process than we can provide here, we recommend 
Beverly A. Browning’s Grant Writing For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley). 
We also urge you to explore Nonprofit Guides: Grant Tools for Nonprofit 
Organizations (http://npguides.org/guide), a set of Internet links to 
grant makers, grant-seeking resources, and glossaries.
Also consider the various “angel-investor” groups and networks, which are 
interested in the social entrepreneurial work that you do or want to do. 
Among them are Investors’ Circle (www.investorscircle.net) and Good 
Capital (www.goodcap.net).
See Chapter 9 for many more ideas on funding nonprofit social enterprises.

315
 Appendix: Resources 
Creating an Identity
In Chapter 10 we devote several pages to the process of creating an iden-
tity for your social enterprise. An important component of your identity is 
developing an attractive and effective home page for your Web site. There 
are plenty of free Web site templates on the Internet (try Googling free web 
template), but not all are appropriate or professional enough in appearance. 
If you’re interested in shelling out a bit of cash for something better, try Buy 
Templates (www.buytemplates.net).
Advertising and marketing bureaus provide services such as designing logos 
and other aspects of branding — you can find them by searching the Internet 
and, if your community is large enough, in your local phone book as well.
Interbrand (www.interbrand.com), in business since 1974, maintains a 
collection of informative articles on many of the different facets of successful 
branding (www.interbrand.com/best_global_brands_intro.aspx).
Don’t reinvent the wheel: Use the Internet to find inspiration when creating 
your identity. Try Googling catchy slogans. You’ll find innumerable pithy 
mottos from a wide variety of areas of commercial life.
Incorporating Your Social Enterprise
If you’re planning on incorporating as a for-profit social enterprise, we sug-
gest you read Incorporating Your Business For Dummies by The Company 
Corporation (Wiley).
Also, check out the guide to corporate bylaws written by the Citizens 
Media Law Project (www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/bylaws-
nonprofit-corporations). Bylaws, as we discuss in Chapter 14, are the 
rules and procedures for how corporations, including nonprofits, should be 
governed and operated. The Citizens Media Law Project says you can write 
satisfactory bylaws without hiring a lawyer.
We also recommend Anthony Mancuso’s book How to Form a Nonprofit 
Corporation, 9th Edition (NOLO Press). Mancuso, a lawyer, guides you 
through the process of creating bylaws appropriate to nonprofit organiza-
tions, including nonprofit social enterprises.
Because bylaws are typically quite lengthy and detailed, we recommend that 
you look at some examples. The Foundation Center (http://foundation
center.org/getstarted/faqs/html/samplebylaws.html) is a good 
source of links to several samples.

Social Entrepreneurship For Dummies 
Managing Paid Staff and Volunteers
Resources dealing with many aspects of the management of small and 
medium-size enterprises of various kinds abound in print and online. We 
recommend starting with Managing For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Bob Nelson 
and Peter Economy (Wiley).
As we point out in Chapter 17, there are differences between managing paid 
staff and managing volunteers. Most management books focus on paid staff — 
for details on managing volunteers, we recommend a book by Katherine 
Noyes Campbell and Susan J. Ellis called The (Help!) I-Don’t-Have-Enough-Time 
Guide to Volunteer Management (Energize). This slim volume is especially 
helpful for administrators who have to tack volunteer management onto a 
long list of other tasks, which is the reality for many social entrepreneurs.
An excellent treatment of the problems related to volunteers is available 
in a free PDF from Voluntary Works called “Dealing with Volunteer Problems” 
(http://www.voluntaryworks.org.uk/action-southbeds/
documents/DealingwithVolunteerProblems.pdf).
The Volunteer Development Agency (www.diycommitteeguide.org/
category/tags/volunteers) provides several free documents that deal 
with many aspects of working with volunteers, including inducting, recruit-
ing, and developing volunteers in your enterprise.
Burnout is a perennial problem for volunteers — and it’s obviously a prob-
lem you want to avoid in your enterprise. The Risk Management Association 
(www.rmahq.org/RMA/Chapters/managing_volunteers.htm) pres-
ents a range of helpful suggestions for keeping volunteers busy, happy, and 
rewarded.
Pursuing an Education in 
Social Entrepreneurship
Major universities, especially through business schools, are now investing in 
research and teaching social entrepreneurship, especially from the for-profit 
side. The following are some of the more committed schools:
 
✓ Canadian Centre for Social Entrepreneurship at the University of 
Alberta: http://apps.business.ualberta.ca/ccse
 
✓ Center for the Advancement of Social Entrepreneurship at Duke 
University’s Fuqua School of Business: www.caseatduke.org

✓ Social Enterprise Initiative at Harvard Business School: www.hbs.
edu/socialenterprise
 
✓ Social Enterprise Program at Columbia University’s Business School:

There are at least two academically oriented networks — intent on develop-
ing social-enterprise intellectual capital through research, education, and 
networking — that are well worth visiting:
 
✓ The Social Enterprise Knowledge Network: www.sekn.org/en
 
✓ The University Network for Social Entrepreneurship: www.
