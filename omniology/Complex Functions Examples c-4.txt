Introduction
Introduction
This is the fourth book containing examples from the Theory of Complex Functions. In this volume
we shall only consider complex power series and their relationship to the general theory, and ﬁnally
the technique of solving linear diﬀerential equations with polynomial coeﬃcients by means of a power
series.
Even if I have tried to be careful about this text, it is impossible to avoid errors, in particular in the
ﬁrst edition. It is my hope that the reader will show some understanding of my situation.

Some simple theoretical results concerning power series
Every analytic function f(z) deﬁned in an open domain Ω can locally be described by a convergent
power series. Thus, if z0 ∈Ω is an interior point, and rz0 denotes the distance from z0 to the boundary
of Ω, then we have the alternative description
f(z) =
+∞

n=0
an (z −z0) ,
for |z −z0| < rz0,
where the coeﬃcients an, n ∈N0 are uniquely determined corresponding to f(z) and the point of
expansion z0.
The two descriptions complement each other. They have both their advantages and their drawbacks.
First consider complex series without any connection to analytic functions. For given z0 ∈C and a
given complex sequence {an} such a series is formally given by
+∞

n=0
an (z −z0)n .
We deﬁne the number of convergence λ by
0 ≤λ := lim sup
n→+∞
n
|an| ≤+∞.

Then
Theorem 1.1 The power series
+∞

n=0
an (z −z0)n
is absolutely convergent for every z ∈C fulﬁlling
λ |z −z0| < 1,
thus for |z −z0| < 1
λ := R,
where R denotes the radius of convergence, and it is divergent for every z ∈C, for which λ |z −z0| > 1.
One shall always be more careful, when one considers the points on the circle λ |z −z0| = 1, because
almost everything may occur here. concerning convergence/divergence. There exist examples of series
being absolute convergent, being divergent everywhere, or conditionally convergent in some points
and divergent in all others, and ﬁnally, there even exist examples in which the series is conditionally
convergent everywhere on the circle of radius R. Notice, however, that it the series is absolutely
convergent in just one point on the circle of convergence, then it is absolutely convergent everywhere.
Hence, the advice is to avoid this set, unless one is explicitly asked to investigate it.
There are three main types of power series:
1) If λ = +∞, then the radius of convergence is R = 0. In this case the series is only convergent
for z = z0, and since a point never is an open domain, it does not make sense in this case to talk
about an analytic function. Hence, this case is not at all interesting in this connection, and we
shall avoid it.
2) If 0 < λ < +∞, then the radius of convergence is ﬁnite, R = 1/λ. The prototype of such series is
the geometric series,
1
1 −z =
+∞

n=0
zn,
|z| < 1,
with the point of expansion z0 = 0. We note that the distance between z0 = 0 and z = 1, where
the denominator is zero, is precisely the radius of convergence 1.
In a sense all power series of ﬁnite positive radius of convergence is a variant of the geometric
series.
3) If λ = 0, then the radius of convergence is R = +∞, and the series is convergent in C. The
prototype for such series is the exponential series,
exp z = ez =
+∞

n=0
1
n! zn,
z ∈C.
If one can stretch one’s imagination one may say that every series of inﬁnite radius of convergence
in some sense is very much like the exponential series.
Concerning rules of computation for series one must always be very careful to have the same point of
expansion z0 for all the series involved. This is typically chosen as z0 = 0, so one hardly discovers that
one may get a problem here. Furthermore, they shall all be convergent in the same neighbourhood of
z0.

Theorem 1.2 Choose for convenience z0 = 0. Assume that
f(z) =
+∞

n=0
anzn
and
g(z) =
+∞

n=0
bnzn,
are two series, both convergent for |z| < r. Then f(z) ± g(z) and f(z) · g(z) also have convergent
power series expansions, which (at least) are convergent in the same disc |z| < r. Furthermore, they
are given by
(f ±g)(z) := f(z)±g(z) =
+∞

n=0
{an ± bn} zn,
and
(fg)(z) := f(z)g(z) =
+∞

n=0
cnzn,
resp.
where we by the Cauchy multiplication deﬁne
cn =
n

k=0
akbn−k,
n ∈N0.
We only know that we have convergence in the original domain |z| < 1. However, if we roughly
speaking, remove a singularity for e.g. f +g or for f ˙g, then we may get a larger radius of convergence.
It is left to the reader to go through the examples
f(z) = −g(z) =
1
1 −z
and
f(z) + g(z),
and
f(z) =
1
1 −z and g(z) = 1 −z
og
f(z) · g(z),
where the radii of convergence become bigger than for f(z) or g(z). The readers who have just started
on the topic of Complex Functions are advised to avoid the Cauchy multiplication. Without some
experience one usually makes lots of errors, and the method will only be necessary in very rare cases.
One of the main results concerning power series is
Theorem 1.3 Given a power series of radius of convergence r > 0 and point of expansion z0. Then
the sum function
f(z) =
+∞

n=0
an (z −z0)n
for |z −z0| < r,
is an analytic function. Its derivative is obtained by termwise diﬀerentiation,
f ′(z) =
+∞

n=0
n an (z −z0)n−1
for |z −z0| < r.
It follows by iterating the latter expression that the series, an hence also the analytic function itself, is
inﬁnitely often diﬀerentiable in its open domain of convergence, and that one obtains all its derivatives
by termwise diﬀerentiation, i.e. by diﬀerentiating under the sum.
By diﬀerentiating n times and then putting z = z0, it follows that
f (n) (z0) = n! an,
dvs.
an = 1
n! f (n) (z0) ,

Theorem 1.4 Let f(z) be the sum of a power series of point of expansion z0 and radius of convergence
r > 0. Then f(z) is equal to its Taylor series expanded from z0,
f(z) =
+∞

n=0
1
n! f (n) (z0) · (z −z0)n
for |z −z0| < r.
This theorem implies the important
Theorem 1.5 The identity theorem. If two power series
+∞

n=0
an (z −z0)n
and
+∞

n=0
An (z −z0)n ,
of the same point of expansion z0, are convergent and equal for |z −z0| < r, where r > 0, then
an = An for every n ∈N0, and the two series have the same radius of convergence.
We have so far introduced two parallel theories, partly the analytic functions as continuous diﬀeren-
tiable functions in the complex variable z, and partly the analytic functions as the sums of a convergent
series. We shall now unite these two theories.
Theorem 1.6 Assume that Ω is an open domain, and let f : Ω →C be analytic. Given any z0 ∈Ω,
the Taylor series of f with z0 as point of expansion, is convergent in (at least) the largest open disc
of centrum z0 contained in Ω. Furthermore, in this disc,
f(z) =
+∞

n=0
1
n! f (n) (z0) · (z −z0)n .
In other words: If we start with a convergent series, then it is equal to the Taylor series from the
chosen point of expansion of the analytic sum. Conversely, if we start with an analytic function f(z),
then the corresponding Taylor series of point of expansion z0 ∈Ω is precisely the series with the sum
f(z).
We assume again that f(z) is analytic in an open domain Ω, and we let z0 ∈Ω. We call z0 a zero of
order n for f(z), if
f (j) (z0) = 0
for j = 0, 1, . . . , n −1
and
f (n) (z0) ̸= 0.
This deﬁnition is supported by the fact that if z0 is a zero of order n, then the Taylor series can be
written
f(z) =
+∞

j=n
aj (z −z0)j = (z −z0)n
+∞

j=0
an+j (z −z0)j .
Theorem 1.7 Assume that f : Ω →C is analytic and not the zero function. Then, to every z ∈Ω
there exists an n = n (z0) ∈N0, such that f (n) (z0) ̸= 0.
Every zero z0 for an analytic function, which is not identically zero, is isolated.
Contrary to the case in the real analysis it is not possible to have curves in the complex plane, on which
the complex function f(z) is zero, unless it is identically zero. Note, however, that it is still possible
for its real or imaginary parts to be zero on some curves. This is important for the applications,
because this can be used in practice.
A consequence of the theorem above is

Theorem 1.8 The identity theorem. Assume that both f : Ω →C and g : Ω →C are analytic in
the open domain Ω. If the set {z ∈Ω | f(z) = g(z)} has an accumulation point in Ω, then f(z) = g(z)
everywhere in Ω.
We shall ﬁnally mention a strange, and at the same time important property of the non-constant
analytic functions f : Ω →C. If Ω is open, then the absolute value |f(z)| cannot attain its maximum
in an interior point of Ω:
Theorem 1.9 The maximum principle. Assume that f : Ω →C is analytic in an open domain Ω.
If |f(z)| has a local maximum at an inner point z0 ∈Ω, then f(z) is constant in Ω.
Of course, we also have a minimum principle, but this is more complicated:
Theorem 1.10 The minimum principle. Assume that the analytic function f : Ω →C is not a
constant in the open domain Ω. If |f(z)| has a local minimum at an interior point z0 ∈Ω, then
f (z0) = 0.
The maximum principle does not hold for unbounded domains. There exists, however, a useful version
Theorem 1.11 Phragm´en-Lindel¨of’s theorem. Assume that f(z) is analytic in the right half
plane Re z > 0, and assume further that f(z) can be extended continuously and bounded to the
boundary, i.e. |f(i y)| ≤M on the imaginary axis. Furthermore, assume that we can ﬁnd constants
a < 1 and K > 0, such that we have the estimate
|f(z)| < K · exp (ra) ,
for Re z ≥0, hvor z = r eiθ.
Then, everywhere in the right half plane,
|f(z)| ≤M,
for Re z ≥0.
There exist actually some practical applications of Phragm´en-Lindel¨of’s theorem in the technical
literature.
Finally, we mention the following theorem, which again shows that it is a very exclusive property of
a function being analytic.
Theorem 1.12 Schwarz’s lemma. Assume that f : B(a, R) →C is analytic and f(a) = 0 and
|f(z)| ≤M for every z ∈B(a, R), i.e. in the open disc of centrum a and radius R. Then we have the
estimate,
(1) |f(z)| ≤M
R |z −a|
for ethvert z ∈B(a, R).
If we have equality at just one point of z ∈B(a, R) \ {a} in (1), then we have equality everywhere in
(1), and there exists a constant θ, such that
f(z) = eiθ · M
R (z −a),
for every z ∈B(a, R).

Example 3.1 Give (without proof) examples of the various possible forms of convergence on the
boundary of the domain of convergence.
We choose the point of expansion z0 = 0 and the radius of convergence ϱ = 1, thus the series shall all
be convergent for |z| < 1, while we are focussing on their behaviour on the circle |z| = 1.

Hence the series is convergent for all |z| < 1.
If |z| = 1, then
|cnzn| = np →+∞
for n →+∞,
which shows that the necessary condition for convergence is not fulﬁlled, and the series is divergent
for |z| ≥1.
Remark 3.5 It is possible to ﬁnd the sum for every given p ∈N, though a general expression is
diﬃcult to derive. ♦
(b) If q = 0, we deﬁne 00 := 1, and we get the trivial series

and the series is convergent for every z ∈C.
Remark 3.6 It follows immediately that if |q| = 1, then the radius of convergence is 1. It is only
possible to ﬁnd the sum for special values of q, |q| = 1.
If |q| > 1, then the radius of convergence is 0, and the analytic sum function does not exist. ♦

Remark 3.8 The essential point is of course that the series has the structure of a power series.
It is of no importance for the radius of convergence that the expansion is taken with respect to
another point than 0. ♦
(c) This is a so-called lacunar series, which means a series in which inﬁnitely many of the coeﬃcients
are 0, and inﬁnitely many of them are ̸= 0. Here,
cp = 1
for p = 2n
and cp = 0 otherwise.
It is not possible to apply the criterion of quotients in its usual form, because we must never divide
by 0.
Instead we use the criterion of roots in its general form,
r =
1
lim sup
n
|cn|
= 1,
and it follows that the radius of convergence is 1.
Alternatively it follows that if |z| ≥1, then |z|2n does not converge towards 0 for n →+∞, so
the necessary condition of convergence is not fulﬁlled. This shows that the series is divergent for
|z| ≥1.
Then assume that |z| < 1. We have the trivial estimate
|z|2n ≤|z|n
for every n ∈N.
Then

|z|2n ≤



|z|n =

Hence the series is convergent in the domain of convergence
{z ∈C | |z| < 1},
corresponding to the radius of convergence 1.

Remark 3.9 It is of no importance for the determination of the radius of convergence that the
expansion in all three cases is taken form another point than 0. The sum function of the latter two
series cannot be expressed by elementary functions, and the sum function of the ﬁrst series cannot be
expressed as a known function at this stage of the development of the theory. ♦
(a) It follows from
cn = (−1)n+1
2n −1 ,
by the criterion of quotients that

2n −1 →1 = r

Alternatively we may apply the criterion of roots,

hence the radius of convergence is 1.
(b) Since

the criterion of quotients does not look too promising. Instead we get by the criterion of roots,

(a) Since cn = nn, we get by the criterion of roots that

Since the radius of convergence is 0, the series does not have a sum function.
(b) Since
cn = n
2n > 0,
it follows by the criterion of roots that
1
n√cn

n√n = 2 = r,

(c) It follows from the structure cn = {3 + (−1)n}n (> 0) that the criterion of quotients is not the
right one to apply.
Instead we use the extended criterion of roots. First note that
n√cn = 3 + (−1)n =
⎧

⎩

4

This implies that

Remark 3.11 It is in fact also here possible to ﬁnd the sum. If |z| < 1

Remark 3.12 The former two series are lacunar series, and it is not possible to express their sum
functions, which exist in both cases, by using elementary functions. ♦
(a) The series is trivially convergent for |z| < 1 and divergent for |z| ≥1, hence the radius of
convergence must be 1. ♦
(b) The series is lacunar (inﬁnitely many coeﬃcients are zero in an irregular pattern). This means
that the criterion of quotients cannot be applied. Instead we use the extended criterion of roots.
We get from cn! = 2n and cm = 0 otherwise that
n!
|cn!| = (2n)1/(n!) = 21/((n−1)!) =
(n−1)!√
2 →1
for n →+∞,
and
m
|cm| = 0, if m ̸= n!, n ∈N. Hence lim sup
n
|cn| = 1, and the radius of convergence
becomes r = 1
1 = 1.

If a ∈]0, 1], then it follows from the ﬁrst equality sign that the radius of convergence is r = 1.
If a > 1, it follows from the latter rearrangement that the radius of convergence is r = 1
a. Summing
up we can write
r = min

We shall not write down the sum function, but leave it to the reader as an exercise. ♦
(a) The structure cn = n!

criterion of roots. Instead we apply the criterion of quotients to get the radius of convergence

Then the “smaller series”

uniformly convergent, we conclude that ζ(z) is analytic in the same domain. This holds for every

2) Find the set K ⊂C, for which the series

1) If |z| > 1, then
				
1

condition of convergence is not satisﬁes. We therefore conclude that R ≤1.

The right hand side is ﬁnite and independent of |z| ≤1, hence the convergence is absolute and
uniform in the closed disc
{z ∈C | |z| ≤1},
and the radius of convergence is R = 1.
2) By (1) the series is convergent, if and only if
|enz| = enx ≤1,
i.e. if and only if x ≤0. It follows that
K = {z ∈C | Re(z) ≤0},
and we have convergence in the closed left half plane.

Example 4.6 Find the Taylor series from z0 = −1+i for Log z. Determine the radius of convergence
of the series as well as the radius of the largest disc of centrum z0 = −1+i, in which the series converges
towards Log z.
A Taylor series is of the form
f(z) =
+∞

n=0
f (n) (z0)
n!
(z −z0)n .
If we put f(z) = Log z (which is analytic in a neighbourhood of z0 = −1 + i), then
f (n)(z) = (−1)n−1(n −1)!z−n,
n ∈N.

Since Log z has its branch cut along the negative real axis with a discontinuity when we cross over
it, the series found does not converge towards Log z in that part of the disc of convergence which
lies below the x-axis, i.e. in the third quadrant. The radius of the largest (open) disc of centrum
z0 = −1 + i, in which the series is convergent towards Log z, is therefore the distance between the

(c) sin z
cos z .
Hint: Let
1
cos z = a0 + a1z + a2z2 + a3z3 + · · · .
Multiply (b), and possibly also (c) by the power series expansion of cos z, and then ﬁnd the coeﬃcients
a0, a1, a2, a3.

= 1 + z + z2
6 + 0 · z3 + · · · .
(b) Here
1
cos z is analytic for |z| < π
2 , so
1
cos z = a0 + a1z + a2z2 + a3z3 + · · · .
Since cos(−z) = cos z is an even function, it follows immediately that a1 = 0 and a3 = 0, and the
series expansion is reduced to
1
cos z = a0 + a2z2 + o

z3
.
Therefore, if |z| < π
2 , then
1
=

thus
1
cos z = 1 + 1
2 z2 + 0 · z3 + · · · ,
|z| < π

Alternatively we ﬁnd f (n)(0) for n = 0, 1, 2, 3:
f(z) =
1
cos z ,
f ′(z) = sin z
cos2 z ,
f ′′(z) =
1
cos z + 2 · sin2 z
cos3 z ,
f (3)(z) = sin z · {· · · },
from which follows that
f(0) = 1,
f ′(0) = 0,
f ′′(0) = 1,
f (3)(0) = 0,
so by insertion,
1
cos z = 1 + 1
2! z2 + 0 · z3 = · · · = 1 + 1
2 z2 + 0 · z3 + · · · .

Alternatively,

f ′′(z) = 2 tan z + 2 tan3 z,
f (3)(z) = 2


hence
f(0) = 0,
f ′(0) = 1,
f ′′(0) = 0,
f (3)(0) = 2,
and we get
tan z = 1
1! z + 2

for |z| < π

Since e−w ̸= 0, this equation is equivalent to the simpler equation,

Finally, by insertion into Taylor’s formula we obtain in a neighbourbood of z0 = 0 that

3! z3 · · · = z + z2 + 3

Example 4.16 Lad M ∈R. Prove that if f(z) is analytic in C, and
Re(f(z)) ≤M
for every z, then f(z) is constant.
Hint: Apply Liouville’s theorem on exp(f(z)).
When we split f into its real and imaginary part, f = u + i v, it follows from the assumption that
u(x, y) ≤M
for every (x, y).
Since exp(f(z)) is analytic and
exp(f(z)) = eu · (cos v + i sin v),
we conclude that
| exp(f(z)) ≤eu ≤eM
for every (x, y),
thus exp(f(z)) is a bounded analytic function. Then it follows from Liouville’s theorem that exp(f(z))
is constant, and since f is continuous, we conclude that f(z) is also constant.

Find B0, B1, . . . , B4.
Prove that Bn = 0 for n ̸= 1 odd.
Determine the radius of convergence of the series.
Since
ez −1 = z + 1

is diﬀerent from zero for z ̸= 2i p π, p ∈Z, we conclude that

2 z2 + o (z2) = lim

2 z + o(z) = 1 = B0.
It follows that B0 = 1. Furthermore, the power series is convergent in the largest open disc of centrum
at 0 which does not contain any number of the form 2i p π, p ∈Z\{0}. The two closest singularities of
the point of expansion z0 = 0 are ±2i π, so we conclude that the radius of convergence is |±2i π| = 2π.
Assume that |z| < 2π. If we multiply the equation by

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

3) Find the Laurent expansion of f in the circular annulus |a| < |z| < |b|.
Figure 9: The disc and the annulus deﬁned by a (to the right) and b (to the left). The disc is considered

which gives us some feeling of where a and b are lying, cf. the ﬁgure. The purpose of the example is,
however, that it is possible not to apply the exact values of a and b. ♦

Second method. Integrating factor. If the diﬀerential equation is multiplied by e−z ̸= 0, then we
get by some small manipulation the equivalent diﬀerential equation
0 = e−z f ′(z) −e−zf(z) = e−z df
dz + f(z) d
dz e−z = d
dz

e−z f(z)

.
We then get by integration,
e−z f(z) = c,
thus
f(z) = c · ez,
c ∈C arbitrary constant.
Third method. Determination of f (n) (z0). We have clearly one degree of freedom, so we choose
f(0) = c ∈C, arbitrary. We get by successive diﬀerentiations of the given diﬀerential equation
and rearrangements
f (n)(z) = f (n−1)(z),
for every n ∈N,
hence by a simple recursion,
f(n)(0) = f (n−1)(0) = · · · = f(0) = c,
n ∈N.
Then the Taylor series from z0 = 0 is formally given by
f(z) =
+∞

n=0
1
n! f (n)(0) zn = c
+∞

n=0
1
n! zn = c · ez,
z ∈C,
where we immediately recognize the exponential series with its domain C.
Fourth method. Determination of a recursion formula for a series solution. We assume that the
equation has a power series solution
f(z) =
+∞

n=0
anzn
where
f ′(z) =
+∞

n=1
n an zn−1
for |z| ≤ϱ,
where we also shall ﬁnd ϱ. We get by insertion into the diﬀerential equation,
0

n=1
{n an −an−1} zn−1,
where these computations are legal, if only |z| < ϱ. Hence, we have a power series expansion of
the zero function, and since this is unique, we conclude that we have the recursion formula
n an −an−1 = 0
for every n ∈N.
We multiply this formula by (n −1)! ̸= 0. Then by a rearrangement and recursion,
n! an = (n −1)! an−1 = · · · = j! aj = · · · = 0! a0 = a0,
thus
an = a0 · 1
n!
for every n ∈N,

and we derive the formal series solution,
f(z) =
+∞

n=0
an zn = a0


n=0

n! zn.
If we recognize this series as the exponential series, then we have ﬁnished our task, because we
know that the exponential series is convergent in C. Otherwise, we split into the cases a0 = 0
(where we get the not so interesting zero series which is convergent everywhere) and a0 ̸= 0, where
ϱ =
lim
n→+∞
				
an
an+1
				 =
lim
n→+∞(n + 1) = +∞,
and the domain of convergence is C.
Alternatively the recursion formula can be solved less elegantly in the following way:
an = 1
n an−1 = 1
n ·
1
n −1 an−2 = · · · = 1
n ·
1
n −1 · · · 1
2 · 1
1 · a0 = 1
n! a0,
and then we proceed as above.
Example 5.2 Solve the diﬀerential equation
(1 −z)f ′(z) = f(z)
by e.g. inserting a formal power series f(z) = &+∞
n=0 anzn.
First method. Inspection. We get by a small rearrangement,
0 = (1 −z)f ′(z) −f(z) = d
dz {(1 −z)f(z)},
the primitive of which is (1 −z)f(z) = c ∈C, and thus
f(z) =
c
1 −z ,
for z ̸= 1.
Second method. Determination of f (n) (z0). The expansion point is z0 = 0, and the coeﬃcient
of f ′(z) is only zero for z = 1, so the Taylor series is at least convergent for |z| < 1. When we
diﬀerentiate the diﬀerential equation it follows after a rearrangement that
(1 −z)f ′′(z) = 2 f ′(z).
This gives us the hint that we possibly in general have
(1 −z)f (n)(z) = n f (n−1)(z),
n ∈N.
This is true for n = 1 and n = 2, and if we diﬀerentiate the conjecture, we get after another small
rearrangement the same structure of the equation, where only n has been replaced by n + 1, and
the claim follows by induction.

Since z0 = 0, it then follows by recursion that
f (n)(0) = n f (n−1)(0) = · · · = n! f(0),
and the Taylor series is the same one as we found above,
f(z) =
+∞

n=0

n! f (n)(0) zn =
+∞

n=0
1
n! · n′! f(0) zn = f(0)
+∞

n=0
zn,
where the radius of convergence again is seen to be ϱ = 1. The series is a quotient series of quotient
z, where |z| < 1, hence
f(z) = f(0)
1 −z ,
for |z| < 1,
though it is obvious that we can extend it to C \ {1}, because the diﬀerential equation is also
fulﬁlled here.
Third method. The method of power series.
We assume that the solution has the power series
expansion
f(z) =
+∞

n=0
an zn
where
f ′(z) =
+∞

n=1
n an zn−1
for |z| ≤ϱ.
When these expressions are put into the diﬀerential equation and we assume that |z| < ϱ, then
0
=
(1 −z)f ′(z) −f(z) =
+∞

n=1
n an zn−1 −

+∞

n=0
(n + 1)an zn =
+∞

n=0
(n + 1) {an+1 −an} zn.
It follows from n + 1 ̸= 0 for every n ∈N0, that we can divide by n + 1 in order to obtain the
simpler recursion formula
an+1 = an,
n ∈N0.
It follows by recursion that
an+1 = an = an−1 = · · · = a0,
n ∈N0,
an our formal series is given by
f(z) = a0
+∞

n=0
zn.
If a0 = 0, we get the zero series which is convergent everywhere.
If a0 ̸= 0, then
ϱ =

n→+∞
				
an

a0

Example 5.3 Examine the inhomogeneous linear diﬀerential equation
z2f ′(z) −f(z) = −z,

So far, so good, but then everything goes wrong, because it is not possible to ﬁnd a primitive
of the left hand side in any neighbourhood of z0 = 0. The problem is that the Laurent series
expansions starts with the term −1/z, so we shall consider a (complex) logarithm. These will all
have a branch cut to z0 = 0, and it will follow from a later book in this series that it is impossible
to obtain a Laurent series around the point z0 = 0.

Second method. Formal determination of the Taylor series. If we put z = 0 into the diﬀerential
equation, then f(0) = 0. We proceed by diﬀerentiating the diﬀerential equation,
z2 f ′′(z) + (2z −1)f ′(z) = −1,
f ′(0) = 1,
z2 f (3)(z) + (4z −1)f ′′(z) + 2 f ′(z) = 0,
f ′′(0) = 2,
z2 f (4)(z) + (6z −1)f (3)(z) + 6 f ′′(z) = 0,
f (3)(0) = 12.
Then it follows by induction (left to the reader) that
z2 f n+1)(z) + (2n z −1)f (n)(z) + n(n −1) f (n−1)(z) = 0,
m ≥2,
hence for z = 0,
f (n)(0) = n(n −1) f (n−1)(0),
n ≥2.
When we divide this recursion formula of f (n)(0) by n!(n −1)!, then we get by recursion,
f (n)(0)
n!(n −1)! =
f (n−1)(0)
(n −1)!(n −2)! = · · · = f (2)(0)
2!1!
= 2
2 = 1,
and the Taylor coeﬃcients become
1
n! f (n)(0) = (n −1)!,
n ∈N,
so the formal Taylor series is
+∞

n=0
1
n! f (n)(0) zn =
+∞

n=1
(n −1)! zn.
Hence, the radius of convergence is
ϱ =
lim
n→+∞
(n −1)!
n!
=
lim
n→+∞
1
n = 0,
so the Taylor series expanded from z0 = 0 is only convergent for z = 0, and we cannot use the
series expansion to anything.
Third method. The power series method. Assume that the solution has a convergent power series
expansion,
f(z) =
+∞

n=0
an zn
for |z| < ϱ.
Then by insertion into the diﬀerential equation,
z2 f ′(z) −f(z)
=

If this expression is put equal to −z, then −a0 = 0, and 0 · a0 −a1 = −1, thus a1 = 1, and
an = (n −1)an−1,
n ≥2.
We get by recursion, an = (n −1)! a1 = (n −1)!, so the formal series becomes
+∞

n=1
(n −1)! zn.
It is immediately seen that this series is divergent, whenever z ̸= 0, so we cannot use the series
expansion to anything.
Remark 5.2 In particular, the example demonstrates that we have never ﬁnished this method of
power series solution, if we have not also found the corresponding open domain of convergence. ♦
Example 5.4 Solve the diﬀerential equation
f ′(z) −z f(z) = 0
by assuming that its solution can be written as a (formal) power series f(z) = &+∞
n=0 anzn.
Remark 5.3 As usual we shall again demonstrate all three possible solution variants. ♦
First variant. Inspection. In the neighbourhood of any point in which f(z) ̸= 0, we see that the
equation is equivalent to
f ′(z)
f(z) = z.
Since Log f(z) is locally deﬁned in the neighbourhood of any such point, the primitive exists and
is given by
Log f(z) = z2
2 + c,
so we have locally,
(4) f(z) = C · exp

z2
2

,
C ∈C.
Then we check the solution. Any solution must have the structure (4). On the other hand, if
f(z) is given by (4), then f(z) is clearly analytic in C, and it follows by diﬀerentiation that (4)
fulﬁls
f ′(z) −z f(z) = 0,
so (4) gives us all solutions of the diﬀerential equation.

Second variant. Determination of the Taylor coeﬃcients. We get by a rearrangement,
f ′(z) = z f(z).
Then a diﬀerentiation gives
f ′′(z) = z f ′(z) + f(z),
and thus
f (3)(z) = z f ′′(z) + 2 f ′(z).
We shall now show by induction that
(5) f (n+1)(z) = z f (n)(z) + n f (n−1)(z).
It follows from the above that (5) holds for n = 1, 2. Assume that (5) holds for some n ∈N. Then
by another diﬀerentiation,
f (n+2)(z) = z f (n+1)(z) + (n + 1)f (n)(z),
which has the same structure as (5), only with n replaced by n + 1. Then the claim follows by
induction (the bootstrap principle).
Now, if we put z = 0 into (5), then
(6) f (n+1)(0) = n f (n−1)(0).
It follows from the original equation that
f ′(0) = 0 · f(0) = 0,
hence we conclude from (6) that
f (2n+1)(0) = 0
for every n ∈N0.
We still have to ﬁnd f (2n)(0). However,
f (2n)(0) = (2n −1)f (2n−2)(0),
so by recursion,
f (2n)(0)
(2n)!
= 1
2n · f (2n−2)(0)

By using the identity theorem we get a1 = 0 and the recursion formula
(7) (n + 1)an+1 = an−1,
n ∈N.
Since a1 = 0, and since there is a leap of 2 in the recursion formula (7), we conclude that
a2n+1 = 0
for n ∈N0.
For even indices we get instead the recursion formula
2n a2n = a2(n−1),

Example 5.5 Solve the diﬀerential equation

Remark 5.4 We shall as usual go through all three standard solution variants. ♦
First variant. Inspection. When z ̸= 1, we multiply by 1−z ̸= 0 and obtain the equivalent equation

Second variant. Determination of the Taylor coeﬃcients. It follows by a diﬀerentiation of
(1 −z)f ′(z) −2f(z) = 0
that
(1 −z)f ′′(z) −3f ′(z) = 0.
Then we prove by induction that
(8) (1 −z)f (n)(z) −(n + 1)f (n−1)(z) = 0.
Assume that (8) holds for some n ∈N. Then a diﬀerentiation gives
(1 −z)f (n+1) −(n + 2)f (n)(z) = 0,
which has the same structure as (8), only with n replaced by n + 1. Since (8) holds for n = 1, the
claim follows by induction (the bootstrap principle), so (8) holds in general.
If we put z = 0 into (8), then
f (n)(0) = (n + 1)f (n−1)(0).
We divide by (n + 1)! and then obtain by recursion that
f (n)(0)
(n + 1)! = f (n−1)(0)
n!

2!

where the coeﬃcients an and the radius of convergence R > 0 are the unknown.
Since z = 1 is the only singular point, we may expect that the radius of convergence is either
R = 1 or R = +∞, if the solution can be extended beyond z = 1.

This is divided by (n + 1)(n + 2) ̸= 0 for n ∈N0, and then we immediately get by recursion that

Remark 5.5 In this case it is rather diﬃcult directly to ﬁnd the Taylor coeﬃcients, so we shall only
demonstrate the other two solution variants. However, ironically (left to the reader), it can be shown
that the determination of the Taylor coeﬃcients actually is the easiest method in the actual case,
which is far from evident. Hence, one will not always be able in advance to judge which method is
the easiest to apply. ♦
First variant. Inspection. This method is also diﬃcult, because one shall divide by the not so obvious
polynomial (2z −1)2z3 (here I have been guided by the coeﬃcient of the term of highest order of
diﬀerentiation). If we do this, then we get for z ̸= 1

Second variant. The power series method. The method of inspection relies on a rather nasty trick,
and the method of determination of the Taylor coeﬃcients does not look promising (however, cf.
the remark in the beginning of the example). Therefore, one would usually start with the power
series method, in particular because the assumptions of the existence theorem are not fulﬁlled at
the singular point z0. And even by the power series method one must be very careful, because the
radius of convergence could be R = 0. In fact, the roots of the polynomial coeﬃcient 2z3 −z2 are
0 and 1
2, so the possible radii of convergence are 0, 1
2 and +∞.

It follows from the identity theorem that we have a0 = 0 and the recursion formula
(9) (n −2) {2(n −4)an−1 −(n −1)an} = 0,
n ∈N.
Remark 5.6 Notice that we here have kept the common factor. The reason is that if n −2 is
removed, then we latently divide by 0, when n = 2. This is one of the pitfalls of the power series
method. ♦
We have proved that a0 = 1. Then put n = 1 into (9) in order to get
(−1) · {2 · (−3) · a0 −0 · a1} = 6 · 0 + 0 · a1 = 0,
which clearly holds no matter the choice of a1, thus a1 is an arbitrary constant.

Then put n = 2 into (9). In this case we get the trivial identity
(10) 0 · {−4a1 −a2} = 0,
so a2 is also an arbitrary constant. This shows why we shall keep the factor n −2 in (9), because
we otherwise would obtain a false solution of (10).
If n > 2, then n −2 ̸= 0, and n −1 ̸= 0, hence we get by solution of (9),
(11) an = 2(n −4)
n −1
an−1
for n ≥3.
If n = 4, then a4 = 0, and then we get by induction of (11) that an = 0 for every n ≥4.
We still have to consider the case n = 3. Here,
a3 = 2(3 −4)
3 −1
a2 = −a2,
and the complete solution then becomes
f(z) = a1z + a2

z2 −z3
.
This solution is a very trivial power series with the domain of convergence equal to C. A check of
the solution shows that it is indeed the complete solution in C.
Remark 5.7 Here the reader should pay attention to another pitfall in the computation.
If
an ̸= 0, then it follows from (11) that
an−1
an

Therefore, one may be misled to believe that the radius of convergence is

2 · n −1

However, this computation is only correct, if an ̸= 0 for every n, and this was not the case here.

Remark 5.8 In case of linear diﬀerential equations of order ≥2 it is very rare that the method
of inspection is successful, and the same can be said about the method of determining the Taylor
coeﬃcients. In the present case we even end up with a series expression which cannot be expressed

Remark 5.9 Here, the power series method is the safe method, However, we shall later show that it

time on the inspection method. ♦
First variant. The power series method. The singular points are the roots of 1 −z2, hence ±1. We

(n + 2) {(n + 1)an+2 −(n −1)an} zn.
Since n + 2 ̸= 0 for n ∈N0, it follows by the identity theorem that we have the recursion formula
(n + 1)an+2 = (n −1)an,
n ∈N0.
Thus, the structure is given by
({n + 2} −1)an+2 = (n −1)an,
n ∈N0.
If we split into n = 2p even and n = 2p + 1 odd, it follows by recursion that
(2p −1)a2p = · · · = (0 −1)a0
and
2pa2p+1 = · · · = (1 −1)a1 = 0,
thus a2p+1 = 0 for p ∈N, and a1 is an arbitrary constant, and
a2p = −

2p −1 a0,
where a0 is also an arbitrary constant. Therefore, the formal power series is

Second variant. Determination of the Taylor coeﬃcients. When we diﬀerentiate the equation

a couple of times, then

1 −z2

f (5)(z) −8z f (4)(z) −10 · f (3)(z) = 0,
which are special cases of the formula
(13)

1−z2
f (n)(z)−2(n−1)zf (n−1)(z)−n(n−3)f (n−2)(z) = 0
for n = 2, 3, 4, 5.
Assume that (13) holds for some n ∈N \ {1}. Then by diﬀerentiation,

1−z2
f (n+1)(z)−2(n+1−1)zf (n+1−1)(z)−{n(n−3)+2(n−1)}f (n−1)(z) = 0,
where
n(n −3) + 2(n −1)
=
n2 −3n + 2n −2 = n2 −n −2
=
(n + 1)(n −2) = (n + 1)({n + 1} −3),
and it follows by induction that (13) holds for every n ∈N \ {1}.
If we put z = 0 into (13), then
f (n)(0) −n(n −3)f (n−2)(0) = 0,
for n ≥2,
and the Taylor coeﬃcients are given by the recursion formula
an = f (n)(0)
n!
= n(n −3)
n!
f (n−2)(0) = n −3
n −1 · f (n−2)(0)
(n −2)! = n −3
n −1 · an−2,
thus
(n −1)an = (n −3)an−2 = ({n −2} −1)an−2.
If n = 2p + 1, p ∈N, is odd and > 1, we get by recursion,
(2p + 1 −1)a2p+1 = · · · = (1 −1)a1 = 0,
where a1 is an arbitrary constant.
If n = 2p, p ∈N, is even, then
(2p −1)a2p = · · · = (0 −1)a0 = −a0,

2p −1 z2p,
and it is again obvious that the domain of convergence is {z ∈C | |z| < 1}, if a0 ̸= 0, and C, if
a0 = 0.
The determination of the sum function is the same as in the ﬁrst variant, so it shall not be repeated
here.

Linear differential equations and the power series method
where the corresponding series is easily shown to have the radius of convergence +∞.
If n = 4p + 3, p ∈N, then we also get by recursion that

(4p + 3) · 4p a4p−1 =

(4p + 3)p a4(p−1)+1 = · · · =
(−1)p
p!(4p + 3)(4p −1) · · · 3 a3,
and the corresponding series has also the radius of convergence +∞.

The classical diﬀerential equations
Example 6.1 By the Bessel equation of order 0 we shall understand the diﬀerential equation

Find a power series solution

of this equation, for which f(0) = 1 and f ′(0) = 0, and then determine its domain of convergence.
This solution is called the Bessel function af order 0 and it is denoted by J0(z).
We get by termwise diﬀerentiation in the domain of convergence |z| < R,
f ′(z) =

Remark 6.1 Strictly speaking the example is over-determined, because we again derive that a1 = 0
without any assumption at all, and yet it is assumed that f ′(0) = a1 = 0. We note in particular, that
if our request had been f ′(0) ̸= 0, then this problem would not have a solution. ♦
It follows by recursion from a1 = 0 that
a2n+1 = 0
for n ∈N0.
Since f(0) = 1, we get a0 = 1, hence by recursion,
a2n = (−1)n
(n!2n)2 = (−1)n

for every z ∈C, so the series is convergent everywhere in C, and the domain of convergence for

so the domain of convergence is C, and Jm(z) is analytic in C.
Example 6.3 We deﬁne the Hermite diﬀerential equation by
f ′′(z) + 2m f(z) = 2z f ′(z),
where m is a complex constant.
(a) Find the power series solution which satisﬁes f(0) = 1, f ′(0) = 0.

Since (n + 2)(n + 1) ̸= 0 for n ≥0, we get the following recursion formula by the identity theorem,

2(n −m)
(n + 2)(n + 1) an.
We conclude from
				
2(n −m)
(n + 2)(n + 1)

for n →+∞,
that the z2-radius of convergence – and hence also the z-radius of convergence – is +∞.
(a) We have in this case a0 = 1 and a1 = 0, so it follows immediately by induction that a2n+1 = 0.

Since (n + 2)(n + 2) ̸= 0 for n in the summation domain N0, we derive the following recursion formula
by the identity theorem,
(14) an+2 =

(n + 2)(n + 1) an = (n + m)(n −m)
(n + 2)(n + 1) an.
If m ∈Z we sometimes get a polynomial, which of course is convergent in C. If the power series
solution is not a polynomial, then (14) implies that the radius of convergence is 1.
(a) If f(0) = 1 and f ′(0) = 0, then a0 = 1 and a1 = 0. Then we conclude by induction that a2n+1 = 0

Since (n + 2)(n + 1) ̸= 0 in the summation domain N0, we get the following recursion formula by the
identity theorem,
(15) an+2 = n(n + 1) −m(m + 1)
(n + 2)(n + 1)
an = n2 −m2 + n −m
(n + 2)(n + 1)
an = (n −m)(n + m −1)

It is easily seen that one in general has the radius of convergence 1, and that the function in some
cases becomes a polynomial of domain of convergence C, when m ∈Z.
(a) If f(0) = 1 and f ′(0) = 0, then a0 = 1 and a1 = 0. Then it follows by induction that a2n+1 = 0

The leap of the indices in this recursion formula is only 1, so we conclude that (apart from a constant
factor) there can at most be one power series solution. Now assume that m /∈N0, so the series has
not degenerated into a polynomial. Then
				
an
an+1
				 = (n + 1)2
n −m
→+∞
for n →+∞,
and we conclude that (apart from a constant factor) there will always be a power series solution and
that its domain of convergence is C. This is of course also true for m ∈N0, when the solution becomes
a polynomial.
(a) If we put n = 0 into the recursion formula (16), then
a1 = −m a0.
Hence we see for m ̸= 0, that either a0 and a1 are both zero, or none of them are zero. Now, the
two given initial conditions are characterized by one being 0, while the other is ̸= 0, so we conclude
that no power series solution can fulﬁl these initial conditions.
(b) Here we have a1 = −m · a0, so the initial conditions are fulﬁlled, and we get by recursion,
an = n −m −1
n2
an−1 = · · · = (n −m −1)(n −m −2) · · · (1 −m)(−m)

Find the radius of convergence ϱ of the series.

Hint: Here we have a couple of variants. In some of them, though not all, we may beneﬁt from the

Let a0 = f(0) = 1. ﬁnd the power series expansion of f(z) and the corresponding domain of conver-
gence.
Hint: The function cannot be expressed by elementary functions.
Remark 7.1 This is an non-typical example, because the variable on the left hand side is z, while
it is z

function at another point z

Since n+1 ̸= 0 in the summation domain N0, we get the following recursion formula from the identity
theorem,
(17) an+1 =
1
(n + 1) · 2 · 4n an,

It follows immediately from (17) that if a0 ̸= 0, then all an ̸= 0 for n ∈N0. Assuming this, it follows
from

that the radius of convergence is ϱ = +∞.

First method. The recursion formula (17) is easiest solved by a trick, in which we multiply (17) by
(n + 1)!2(n+1)2. Then
(n + 1)!2(n+1)2an+1 = (n + 1)!2(n+1)2
(n + 1) · 2 · 4n an = n! 2(n+1)2−1−2nan = n! 2n2an,
and we see that we obtain the right hand side from the left hand side by replacing n everywhere
by n −1. We therefore get by recursion,
(n + 1)! 2(n+1)2an+1 = n! 2n2an = · · · = 1! 21a1 = 0!20a0 = a0,
thus
an =
1
n! 2n2 a0,
and the solution is
f(z) = a0
+∞

n=0
1
n! 2n2 zn,
z ∈C.
Second method. Alternatively it follows from (17) that
an =
1
n · 2 · 4n−1 an−1 =
2
n · 4n an−1,
n ∈N,
hence by recursion,
an =
2
n · 4n an−1 =
2
n · 4n ·
2
(n −1)4n−1 an−2,
n ≥2,
and in general,
an

n! 4n ·

n! 4
1
2 n(n+1) a0 =
2n
n! 2n2+n a0 =
1
n! 2n2 a0,
n ∈N0.
We derive once more that the radius of convergence is +∞. Note that we have applied the hint.
The general solution is then given by
(18) f(z) = a0
+∞

n=0
1
n!

2n2 zn,
a0 ∈C,
z ∈C,
and when a0 = f(0) = 1, we of course get

Third method. Alternatively we may early in the process apply that 4n = 22n.
Then the
recursion formula (17) can be written
an =
1
n · 22n−1 an−1.
Then note that n2 −(n −1)2 = 2n −1, so we get a telescopic sum by insertion,
n

j=1
(2j −1) =
n

j=1

j2 −(j −1)2
= n2 −02 = n2.
This means that
an =

n · 22n−1 ·
1
(n −1) · 22n−3 · · ·
a0
1 · 21 =
a0
n! 21+3+···+(2n−1) =

n! 2n2 .
Fourth method. Determination of the Taylor coefficients. It is not necessary to apply the
recursion formula (17). In fact, if we diﬀerentiate the diﬀerential equation
f ′(z) = 1
2 f
z

then it follows by the chain rule that
f ′′(z) = 1

Example 7.2 Given the diﬀerential equation
(19) 2z f ′′(z) + (3 −2z)f ′(z) −f(z) = 0.
Find every power series solution from 0 of (19) and its radius of convergence.

{(n + 1)(2n + 3)an+1 −(2n + 1)an} zn.
Then by the identity theorem,
(n + 1)(2n + 3)an+1 −(2n + 1)an = 0,
n ∈N0.
Hence we obtain the recursion formula
an+1
=
1
n + 1 · 2n + 1

(n + 1)! · 2n + 1

so by a change of index,

and the series is given by
f(z) = a0

n=0

The domain of convergence is obviously C.

If we put n = −1, we get a0 = 0, while a−1 is indeﬁnite.

Since (n + 1)(n + 2) ̸= 0 for n ∈N0, we obtain the following recursion formula by the identity
theorem,
an+2 = 3an+1 −2an,
n ∈N0.
2) If we put bn = an+1 −an, then it follows by the recursion formula above,
bn+1 = an+2 −an+1 = 2 {an+1 −an} = 2bn,
n ∈N0,
hence by recursion with respect to bn,
an+1 −an = bn = 2nb0 = 2n {a1 −a0} .
Then
an =

(aj+1 −aj) + a0 =
n−1

j=0
2j (a1 −a0) + a0 = (2n −1) a1 + (2n −2) a0,
and we have proved the formula.
Alternatively, we see that the claimed formula,
an = (2n −1) a1 −(2n −2) a0,
n ∈N0,
holds for n = 0 and for n = 1. Then we prove it by induction, assuming that it holds for n and
n + 1. Then by insertion,

a0 = an+2,
and the formula is proved.
3) If a1 = a0, then it follows from the formula above that an = a0 for every n, so
Ω = {z ∈C | |z| < 1}.
If instead a1 ̸= a0, then
an = 2n (a1 −a0) + 2a0 −a1 = 2n 
a1 −a0 + 2−n (2a0 −a1)

It follows that
n√an →2 for n →+∞, so

Example 8.1 Find the order of the zero at z = 0 for each of the functions
(a) z2 
exp

z2
−1

,
(b) 6 sin z3 + z3 
z6 −6

,
(c) esin z −etan z.
Remark 8.1 It will be demonstrated by the variants of solutions that one should be very careful here
by choosing the most convenient method. It is of course possible in all three cases (cf. the deﬁnition)
to diﬀerentiate, until one reach the smallest number n, for which f (n)(0) ̸= 0, but it will usually be
more easy to insert known series expansions for the given functions. In particular, (b) becomes very
diﬃcult to solve by the method of diﬀerentiation. ♦
(a) First method. Insertion of Taylor series. It follows from
f(z) = z2 
ez2 −1

= z2

1 + 1
1! z2 + o

z2
−1

= z4 + o

z4
,
that the order is 4.
Second method. The method of diﬀerentiation. We get by successive diﬀerentiation,
f(z) = z2ez2 −z2,
f(0) = 0,
f ′(z) = 2z3ez2 + 2z ez2 −2z,
f ′(0),
f ′′(z) = 4z4ez2 + 10z2ez2 + 2ez2 −2,
f ′′(0) = 0,
f (3)(z) = 8z5ez2 + 36z3ez2 + 24z ez2,
f (3)(0) = 0,
f (4)(z) = 16z6ez2 + 112z4ez2 + 156z2ez2 + 24ez2,
f (4)(0) = 24,
so we conclude that the order is 4.
(b) First method. Insertion of Taylor series. It follows from
f(z)
=
6 sin

z3

z6 −6


z3 −1


z15
+ z9 −6z3

20 z15 + o

z15
that the order is 15.
Second method. Diﬀerentiation with respect to w = z3. First note that the function is actually a
function of w = z3. If we change variable to w, the diﬀerentiation method becomes reasonable,
thought still bigger that the ﬁrst method. In fact,
f(z) = 6 sin z3 + z9 −6z3 = 6 sin w + w3 −6w = g(w),
and then by diﬀerentiation with respect to w,
g(w) = w3 −6w + 6 sin w,
g(0) = 0,
g′(w) = 3w2 −6 −6 cos w,
g′(0) = 0,
g′′(w) = 6w −6 sin w,
g′′(0) = 0,
g(3)(w) = 6 −6 cos w,
g(3)(0) = 0,
g(4)(w) = 6 sin w,
g(4)(0) = 0,
g(5)(w) = 6 cos w,
g(5)(0) = 6 ̸= 0,

and we conclude that
g(w) = 6
5! w5 + o

w5

20 w5 + o

w5
.
Then
f(z) = g

20

z35 + o

z35

20 z15 + o


so the order of the zero is 15.
Third method. The diﬀerence of time consumption of the two methods of (a) was not very big.
However, in the present case, the diﬀerentiations really grows wild. We get

where ﬁnally
f (15)(0) = 65 383 718 400 = 15!

(c) It is here diﬃcult – though not quite impossible – to insert the power series expansions, so we
prefer here the method of diﬀerentiations. It should, however, be mentioned that there is also here
an alternative, which requires some intuition. We show here three solution variants, which is far
from being exhaustive.
First method. Intuition. Since cos z ̸= 1 and sin z ̸= 0 in a neighbourhood of 0, excluding 0, it
follows that
u = sin z
and
v = tan z = sin z
cos z
are diﬀerent in the same neighbourhood, excluding 0. Then
esin z −etan z = eu −ev = eu −ev
u −v · (u −v),
where
lim

u −v

Third method. A hybrid of the two solutions above. Since
esin z −etan z = esin z 
1 −etan z−sin z

and
lim
z→0 esin z = 1 ̸= 0,
the task is reduced to ﬁnding the order of the zero z0 = 0 of the function
g(z) = etan z−sin z −1,
g(0) = 0.
Here we get by successive diﬀerentiations,
g′(z) =

g′(0) = 0,
g′′(z) =

so n = 3 is the ﬁrst order of diﬀerentiation for which the result is ̸= 0. This means that the
order of the zero is 3.

and we conclude that the order of the zero is 10.
Second method. The method of diﬀerentiation. It suﬃces to ﬁnd the order or the zero of
f(z) = sin z + sinh z −2z,
because {f(z)}2 = (sin z + sinh z −2z)2 then has twice as many. Note that it is not a good idea
just to diﬀerentiate the expression {f(z)}2 itself.
We get
f(z) = sin z + sinh z −2z,
f(0) = 0,
f ′(z) = cos z + cosh z −2,
f ′(0) = 0,
f ′′(z) = −sin z + sinh z,
f ′′(0) = 0,
f (3)(z) = −cos z + cosh z,
f (3)(0) = 0,
f (4)(z) = sin z + sinh z,
f (4)(0) = 0,

f(0) = 0,
f ′(z) = 2 cos z −2 + z sin z,

Second method. o-technique. A shorter variant is to use o-technique:

2 · 3
7! z14 + o

z14
,
from which we conclude that the order of the zero is 14.
Third method. Method of diﬀerentiation, ﬁrst variant.
If we immediately see that f(z) can be
considered as a function of w = z2,
f(z)
=
3 sinh

z2
−3 sin

z2
−z6
=
3 sinh w −3 sin w −w3,
then the example is reduced to ﬁnd the order of the zero of the function
g(w) = 3 sinh w −3 sin w −w3,
g(0) = 0,
at w0 = 0. It follows by diﬀerentiation that
g′(w) = 3 cosh w −3 cosw −3w2,
g′(0) = 0,
g′′(w) = 3 sinh w + 3 sin w −6w,
g′′(0) = 0,
g(3)(w) = 3 cosh w + 3 cos w −6,
g(3)(0) = 0,
g(4)(w) = 3 sinh w −3 sin w,
g(4)(0) = 0,
g(5)(w) = 3 cosh w −3 cos w,
g(5)(0) = 0,
g(6)(w) = 3 sinh w + 3 sin w,
g(6)(0) = 0,
g(7)(w) = 3 cosh w + 3 cos w,
g(7)(0) = 6 ̸= 0.
Hence, the function g(w) has a zero of order 7 at w0 = 0, thus
g(w) = w7 · g1(w),
g1(0) ̸= 0.
When we put w = z2, we get
f(z) = g

z2
=

z27 g1

z2
= z14g1

z2
,
g1(0) ̸= 0,
and it follows immediately that f has a zero of order 14 at z0 = 0.

Since

is the ﬁrst derivative of f(z) at z = 0, which is diﬀerent from 0, we conclude that the order is 14.
Remark 8.2 Note that
a14 = f (14)(0)
14!

Example 8.5 1) Explain why the function
f(z) = Log

1 + z2
−sin2 z
is analytic in the point set
C \ {z ∈C | Re(z) = 0 ∧|Im(z)| ≥1}.
2) Find the order of the zero at z = 0 of f.
3) Denote by
+∞

n=0
anzn
the Taylor series of f. Find the radius of convergence of the series.
(One shall not give an explicit expression of the general term.)
Figure 10: The domain with the branch cuts from ±i.
1) The principal logarithm is analytic in the plane with the branch cuts. Hence, the function 1 + z2
must not be real negative or zero. The exception set is then
1 + z2 = −t,
t ≥0,
i.e.
z = ±i
√
1 + t,
t ≥0,
thus
Re(z) = 0
and
|Im(z)| ≥1.
We have proved that Log

1 + z2
is analytic in the given point set. Since Da sine is analytic in
the complex plane, the claim follows.

b) The diﬀerentiation method. Here we get:
f ′(z)
=
2z
1 + z2 −2 sin z cos z
=
1
z + i +
1
z −i −sin 2z,
f ′(0),
f ′′(z)
=
−

(z + i)2 −

f ′′(0) = 1 + 1 −2 = 0,
f (3)(x)
=
2
(z + i)3 +
2
(z −i)3 + 4 sin 2z,
f (3)(0) = 2i −2i + 0 = 0,
f (4)(z)
=
−6
(z + i)4 +
−6
(z −i)4 + 8 cos 2z,
f (4) = −6 −6 + 8 = −4.
It follows that the order of the zero is 4 and that the ﬁrst term is
−4
4! z4 = −1
6 z4.
c) If one does not start with a decomposition, the diﬀerentiations become more diﬃcult:
f ′(z)
=
2z
1 + z2 −sin 2z,
f ′′(z)
=
2

z2 + 1

−2z · 2z

(1 + z2)2 −2 cos 2z,



(1 + z2)3

f (4)(z)

(z2 + 1)4
+ 8 cos 2z = −12

z4 −6z2 + 1

(z2 + 1)4
+ 8 cos 2z,
followed by putting z = 0.
3) If we write
f(z) =
+∞

n=0
anzn,
then the domain of convergence is the largest open disc of centrum 0, in which f is analytic. It
follows from the ﬁgure that the radius of convergence is 1.
Remark 8.3 Even though it is not requested, it is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd an,

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

The maximum principle
Example 10.1 Given f(z) = (z + 1)2. Find the maximum and the minimum of |f/z)| in the set A,
where A is the closed triangle of the corners z = 0, z = 2 and z = i.

Figure 11: The triangle A.
This example was originally constructed in order to illustrate the maximum principle. However, it is
easily seen that a geometric argument is much easier to apply, because |f(z)| indicates the square of
the distance from −1 to z.
Clearly, the minimum is obtained at z = 0, corresponding to |f(0)| = 1, and the maximum is obtained
at z = 2, corresponding to |f(z)| = 9.
Example 10.2 Find the maximum of | sin z| on the set [0, 2π] × [0.2π].

4) On the line z = 2π + i y, y ∈[0, 2π], we get
max
y∈[0,2π] | sin(2π + i y)| =
max
y∈[0,2π] | sin(i y)| =
max
y∈[0,2π] sinh y = sinh 2π.
By comparing these four results it follows that
max
Ω
| sin z| = cosh 2π,
so the maximum is obtained for
z = π
2 + 2iπ
and
z = 3π
2 + 2i π.
Example 10.3 Find the maximum of
		exp

z2		 on {z ∈C | |z| ≤1}.
It follows from the maximum principle that the maximum is attained on the boundary |z| = 1, where
we put z = ei θ, so
		exp

z2		 =
		exp

22i θ		 = exp(cos 2θ),
θ ∈[0, 2π].
Obviously, we obtain the maximum when cos 2θ = 1, hence the maximum is e1 = e.
Example 10.4 Prove that the transformation
T(z) = R (z −z0)
R2 −z0z ,
|z0| < R,
maps the open disc of radius R and centrum 0 into the unit disc with T (z0) = 0.
Hint: Apply the maximum principle, and prove that |z| = R implies that |T(z)| = 1.
Clearly, T (z0) = 0. If |z| = R, then
|T(z)| = R
				
z −z0
R2 −z0z
				 = R
				
z −z0
z z −z0z
				 = R
|z| ·
				
z −z0
z −z0
				 = R
R · 1 = 1.
Then it follows from the maximum principle that |T(z)| ≤1 for |z| < R, and since T (z0) = 0, we
cannot have equality. so |T(z)| < 1 for |z| < R.
