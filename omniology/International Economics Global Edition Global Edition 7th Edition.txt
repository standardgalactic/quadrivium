International Economics is designed for a one-semester course covering both the micro 
and macro components of international economics. The Seventh Edition continues the 
approach of the first six editions by offering a principles-level introduction to the core 
theories, together with policy analysis and the institutional and historical contexts of 
international economic relations. My goal is to make economic reasoning about the 
international economy accessible to a diverse group of students, including both eco-
nomics majors and nonmajors. My intention is to present the consensus of economic 
opinion, when one exists, and to describe the differences when one does not. In general, 
however, economists are more often in agreement than not.
New to the Seventh Edition
This Seventh Edition of International Economics preserves the organization and cov-
erage of the Sixth Edition and adds a number of updates and enhancements. New to 
this edition:
■
■All tables and graphs have been updated.
■
■New case studies are added in Chapter 2 on the Asian Infrastructure and Invest-
ment Bank; Chapter 5 on industrial policies targeting clean energy technology; 
and Chapter 16 on the Worldwide Governance Indicators.
■
■Chapter 9 on the balance of payments has incorporated the accounting revi-
sions of the IMF and the implementation of the revisions by the U.S. Bureau of 
Economic Analysis. The changes recommended by the IMF are mostly termi-
nology, but also in the presentation of debits and credits. Chapter 9 also adds a 
new appendix on the terminology of numbers: billions, thousands of millions, 
milliards, and trillions.
■
■The discussion of financial crises in Chapter 12 is presented in terms of vulner-
abilities and triggers, following the terminology used by former Fed Chairman 
Ben Bernanke, among others.
■
■Chapter 16 has dropped the World Bank’s now-dated terminology and focus on 
the High Performance Asian Economies in favor of a more empirically deter-
mined set of high growth, export oriented East Asian economies.
■
■Chapter 17 is focused on India and China, exclusively.

■
■The discussion of trade and jobs in Chapters 4, 13, and 17 is more nuanced 
and reflects the growing challenge to the consensus that trade is not the 
cause of manufacturing’s decline in high-income countries.
Hallmarks of International Economics
Several features of International Economics distinguish it from the many excellent 
texts in the field:
■
■First, the approach is broader than the theoretical apparatus used by 
­economists. Economic theory is covered and its mastery is essential, 
but most readers grasp theory more completely when it is presented along 
with real-world applications. To this end, I have supplemented economic 
theory with case studies and other content ranging from the role of eco-
nomic institutions and the analysis of international economic policies to 
the recent history of the world economy and the challenges facing differ-
ent geographical regions as they become more economically integrated 
internationally.
■
■Second, the objective of covering both the micro and macro sides in a one-
semester course necessitates paring back the coverage of theory in order to 
focus on the central concepts. As all instructors are aware, many theoretical 
topics are of secondary or tertiary importance, which can pose a problem 
for students who may lack the needed breadth and depth of understanding 
to rank topics by their relative importance.
■
■Third, International Economics provides richer historical and institutional 
detail than most other texts. This material illuminates the relationships 
between economic theory and policy, and between economics and the 
other social sciences.
■
■Fourth, I have organized Part 4 of the book into five chapters, each focused 
on a geographic area as follows: North America with emphasis on the 
United States, the European Union, Latin America, East Asia, and India 
and China. These chapters offer students the chance to broaden their under-
standing of world trends and to observe the intellectual power of economic 
theory in practice.
Flexibility of Organization
A text requires a fixed topical sequence because it must order the chapters one 
after another. This is a potential problem for some instructors, as there is a wide 
variety of preferences for the order in which topics are taught. The Seventh Edi-
tion, like the previous editions, strives for flexibility in allowing instructors to find 
their own preferred sequence.

Preface
19
Part 1 includes two introductory chapters that are designed to build vocabulary, 
develop historical perspective, and provide background information about the dif-
ferent international organizations and the roles they play in the world economy. 
Some instructors prefer to delve into the theory chapters immediately, reserv-
ing this material for later in the course. There is no loss of continuity with this 
approach.
Part 2 presents the micro side of international economics, while Part 3 covers 
the macro side. These two parts can easily be reversed in sequence if desired.
Part 2 includes six chapters that cover trade models (Chapters 3–5) and com-
mercial policy (Chapters 6–8). A condensed treatment of this section could focus 
on the Ricardian model in Chapter 3, and the analysis of tariffs and quotas in Chap-
ters 6 and 7. Chapter 8 on labor and environmental standards can stand on its own, 
although the preceding chapters deepen student understanding of the trade-offs.
Part 3 covers the balance of payments, exchange rates, open-economy macro-
economics, and international financial crises. Chapter 11 on open economy mac-
roeconomics is optional. It is intended for students and instructors who want a 
review of macroeconomics, including the concepts of fiscal and monetary policy, 
in a context that includes current accounts and exchange rates. If Chapter 11 is 
omitted, Chapter 12 (financial crises) remains accessible as long as students have 
an understanding of the basic concepts of fiscal and monetary policy. Chapter 12 
relies most heavily on Chapters 9 (balance of payments) and 10 (exchange rates 
and exchange rate systems).
Part 4 presents five chapters, each focused on a geographic area. These chapters 
use theory presented in Chapters 3–12 in a similar fashion to the economics discus-
sion that students find in the business press, congressional testimonies, speeches, 
and other sources intended for a broad civic audience. Where necessary, concepts 
such as the real rate of exchange are briefly reviewed. One or more of these chap-
ters can be moved forward to fit the needs of a particular course.

Acknowledgments
All texts are team efforts, even single-author texts. I owe a debt of gratitude to a 
large number of people. At San Diego State University, I have benefited from the 
opportunity to teach and converse with a wide range of students. My colleagues 
in San Diego and across the border in Mexico have been extremely helpful. Their 
comments and our conversations constantly push me to think about the core eco-
nomic ideas that should be a part of a college student’s education, and to search 
for ways to explain the relevance and importance of those ideas with greater clar-
ity and precision. Any failure in this regard is, of course, mine alone.
I am deeply grateful to Neeraj Bhalla, Nicole Suddeth, Sree Meenakshi R, and 
the MyLab Economics team.
Finally, my gratitude goes to the numerous reviewers who have played an essen-
tial role in the development of International Economics. Each of the following indi-
viduals reviewed the manuscript, many of them several times, and provided useful 
commentary. I cannot express how much the text has benefited from their comments.

INTRODUCTION: INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION
In August of 2007, a crisis erupted in the housing sector of the United States. At the 
time, few people realized that the subprime mortgage crisis would become a demon-
stration of international economic integration or that it would push the world economy 
to the brink of collapse. The crisis grew through the remainder of 2007 and into 2008, so 
that by the summer nearly all high-income economies were in deep distress. Contagion 
from the crisis spread like an epidemic as banks and other financial firms collapsed and 
solvent firms stopped lending. The scarcity of credit caused difficulties for businesses 
that could not find financing for their day-to-day operations while, at the same time, 
consumers cut back on their spending and businesses cut back on new investment. By 
the end of 2008, economies around the world were in recession, with the notable excep-
tions of China, India, and the major oil producers.
This episode is the most dramatic instance since the Great Depression of the 1930s 
of a crisis leading to severe economic recession in many countries around the world. It 
is, however, only one of several recent examples of crises spilling across national bor-
ders. The Russian Crisis of 1998–99, the Asian Crisis of 1997–98, the Mexican Crisis of 
1994–95, the Latin American Debt Crisis of 1982–89, and a number of others caused 
major damage to financial systems, businesses, and households, both in the places 
where they originated and in many other countries.
The international integration of national economies has brought many benefits to 
nations across the globe, including technological innovation, less expensive products, 
and greater investment in regions where local capital is scarce, to name a few. But 
An Introduction to the 
World Economy
C hapt e r
Learning Objectives
After studying this chapter, students will be able to:
1.1	Discuss historical measures of international economic integration with data on 
trade, capital flows, and migration.
1.2	Compute the trade-to-GDP ratio and explain its significance.
1.3	Describe three factors in the world economy today that are different from the 
economy at the end of the first wave of globalization.
1.4	List the three types of evidence that trade supports economic growth.

it has also made countries vulnerable to economic problems that have become 
more easily transmitted from one place to another. Given that the benefits and 
costs of international economic integration are surrounded by controversy, it is 
worth clarifying what we mean by the term international economic integration, or 
globalization in the economic sphere. To help us understand these forces better, a 
historical perspective is also useful.
ELEMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION
LO 1.1	 Discuss historical measures of international economic integration with 
data on trade, capital flows, and migration.
LO 1.2	 Compute the trade-to-GDP ratio and explain its significance.
LO 1.3	 Describe three factors in the world economy today that are different 
from the economy at the end of the first wave of globalization.
LO 1.4	 List the three types of evidence that trade supports economic growth.
Most people would agree that the major economies of the world are more inte-
grated than at any time in history. Given our instantaneous communications, mod-
ern transportation, and relatively open trading systems, most goods can move 
from one country to another without major obstacles and at relatively low cost. 
For example, most cars today are made in fifteen or more countries after you 
consider where each part is made, where the advertising originates, who does the 
accounting, and who transports the components and the final product. Neverthe-
less, the proposition that today’s economies are more integrated than at any other 
time in history is not simple to demonstrate. It is clear that our current wave of 
economic integration began in the 1950s, with the reduction of trade barriers 
after World War II. In the 1970s, many countries began to encourage financial 
integration by increasing the openness of their capital markets. The advent of 
the Internet in the 1990s, along with the other elements of the telecommuni-
cations revolution, pushed economic integration to new levels as multinational 
firms developed international production networks and markets became ever 
more tightly linked.
Today’s global economy is not the first instance of a dramatic growth in eco-
nomic ties between nations, however, as there was another important period 
between approximately 1870 and 1913. New technologies such as transatlantic 
cables, steam-powered ships, railroads, and many others led the way, much as 
they do today. For example, when the first permanent transatlantic cable was 
completed in 1866, the time it took for a New York businessperson to com-
plete a financial transaction in London fell from approximately three weeks 

28
Part 1    Introduction and Institutions
to one day, and by 1914 it had fallen to one minute as radio telephony became 
possible.
We have mostly forgotten about this earlier period of economic integration, 
and that makes it easier to overestimate integration today. Instantaneous com-
munications and rapid transportation, together with the easy availability of foreign 
products, often cause us to lose sight of the fact that most of what we buy and sell 
never makes it out of our local or national markets. We rarely pause to think that 
haircuts, restaurant meals, gardens, health care, education, utilities, and many 
other goods and services are partially or wholly domestic products. In the United 
States, for example, about 83.4 percent of goods and services are produced domes-
tically, with imports (16.6 percent) making up the remainder of what we consume 
(2014). By comparison, in 1890 the United States made about 92 percent of its 
goods and services, a larger share than today, but not radically different.
The question as to whether we are more economically integrated today or some 
period in the past is not academic. Between the onset of World War I in 1914 and 
the end of World War II in 1945, the world economy suffered a series of human-
made catastrophes that de-integrated national economies. Two world wars and a 
global depression caused most countries to close their borders to foreign goods, 
foreign capital, and foreign people. Since the end of World War II, many of the 
economic linkages between nations have served to repair the damage done during 
the first half of the twentieth century, but there is no reason to think that events 
might not cause a similar decoupling in the future.
Understanding international economic integration requires us to define what 
we mean by the term. Economists usually point to four criteria or measures for 
judging the degree of integration, which are trade flows, capital flows, people 
flows, and the similarity of prices in separate markets. The first three points are 
relatively self-explanatory, while the similarity of prices refers to the fact that 
integrated economies have price differences that are relatively small and are due 
mainly to differences in transportation costs. Goods that can move freely from a 
low-cost to a high-cost region should experience price convergence as goods move 
from where they are plentiful and cheap to where they are relatively scarcer and 
more expensive. All of these indicators—trade flows, factor (labor and capital) 
movements, and similarity of prices—are measures of the degree of international 
economic integration.
The Growth of World Trade
Since the end of World War II, world trade has grown much faster than world 
output. One way to show this is to estimate the ratio of exports by all countries to 
total production by all countries. In 1950, total world exports—which are the same 
as world imports—are estimated to have been 5.5 percent of world gross domestic 
product (GDP), a measure of total production. Sixty-three years later, in 2013, 
they were approximately 30 percent of world GDP, nearly six times more impor-
tant relative to the size of the world economy. One important measure of inter-
national trade in a nation’s economy is the sum of exports plus imports, divided 

Chapter 1    An Introduction to the World Economy 
29
by the GDP. Specifically, it is the value of all final goods and services produced 
inside a nation during some period, usually one year. The trade-to-GDP ratio is 
represented as follows:
Trade to GDP ratio = (Exports + Imports) , GDP
The ratio does not tell us about a country’s trade policies and countries with 
higher ratios do not necessarily have lower barriers to trade, although that is one 
possibility. In general, large countries are less dependent on international trade 
because their firms can reach an optimal production size without having to sell 
to foreign markets. Consequently, smaller countries tend to have higher ratios of 
trade-to-GDP.
Figure 1.1 shows the trade-to-GDP ratio for four countries between 1913 and 
2013. The decline in trade between the onset of World War I and 1950 is clearly 
visible in each country, as is the subsequent increase after 1950. Another pattern 
shown in Figure 1.1 is the smaller ratios for the United States and Japan, which 
have the largest populations, and the much higher ratio for the Netherlands, which 
has the smallest population in the sample. In general, smaller countries trade more 
than larger ones since they cannot efficiently produce a wide range of goods and 
must depend on trade to a greater extent. For example, if the Netherlands were 
to produce autos solely for its own market, it would lack economies of scale and 
could not produce at a competitive cost, whereas the U.S. market can absorb a 
large share of U.S. output. Hence, the trade-to-GDP ratio measures the relative

importance of international trade in a nation’s economy, but it does not provide 
any direct information about trade policy or trade barriers.
Figure 1.1 gives a historical overview of the decline and subsequent return 
of international trade after World War II, but it obscures important changes in 
the composition of trade flows from early in the twentieth century to those at 
the end of the century. Before World War I most trade consisted of agricultural 
commodities and raw materials, while current trade is primarily manufactured 
consumer goods and producer goods (machinery and equipment). Consequently, 
today’s manufacturers are much more exposed to international competition than 
was the case in 1900. In addition, much of the growth of world trade since 1950 
has been accomplished by multinational corporations. With production sites in 
multiple countries and inputs that pass back and forth between affiliates, multina-
tional corporations have become dramatically important. This trend has been sup-
ported and encouraged by the telecommunications revolution and transportation 
improvements that have lowered the costs of coordinating operations physically 
separated by oceans and continents. And finally, it has also become possible to 
coordinate service operations such as accounting and data processing from a great 
distance. In sum, trade today is qualitatively different than in 1913, and the growth 
of the trade-to-GDP ratio since 1950 does not tell the whole story.
Capital and Labor Mobility
In addition to exports and imports, factor movements also are an indicator of 
economic integration. As national economies become more interdependent, labor 
and capital should move more easily across international boundaries. Labor, how-
ever, is less mobile internationally than it was in 1900. Consider, for example, that 
in 1890 approximately 14.5 percent of the U.S. population was foreign born, while 
in 2010, the figure was 12.9 percent. In 1900, many nations had open door immi-
gration policies, and passport controls, immigration visas, and work permits were 
exceptions rather than rules. The movement of people was severely restricted by 
the two world wars and the Great Depression of the 1930s. In the 1920s, during 
the interwar period, the United States sharply restricted immigration with policies 
that lasted until the 1960s, when changes in immigration laws once again encour-
aged foreigners to migrate to the United States.
On the capital side, measurement is more difficult, since there are several ways 
to measure capital flows. The most basic distinction is between flows of financial 
capital representing paper assets such as stocks, bonds, currencies, bank accounts, 
and flows of capital representing physical assets such as real estate, factories, and 
businesses. The latter type of capital flow is called foreign direct investment (FDI). 
To some extent, the distinction between the two types of capital flows is immate-
rial because both represent shifts in wealth across national boundaries and both 
make one nation’s savings available to another.
When we compare international capital flows today to a century ago, there are 
two points to keep in mind. First, savings and investment are highly correlated. 
That is, countries with high savings tend to have high rates of investment, and low 

Chapter 1    An Introduction to the World Economy 
31
savings is correlated with low investment. If there were a single world market in 
which capital flowed freely and easily, this would not necessarily be the case. Capi-
tal would flow from countries with abundant savings and capital to countries with 
low savings and capital, where it would find its highest returns. Second, a variety of 
technological improvements increased capital flows in the 1800s, as they are doing 
today. Transoceanic cables and radio telephony have already been mentioned, but 
capital flows also increased in the late 1800s because there were new investment 
opportunities such as national railroad networks and other infrastructure, both 
at home and abroad.
If we compare the size of capital flows today to the previous era of globaliza-
tion, flows today are much larger but mainly because economies are larger. Rela-
tive to the size of economies, the differences are not great and may even favor 
the 1870 to 1913 period, depending on what is measured. Great Britain routinely 
invested 9 percent of its GDP abroad in the decades before 1913, and France, 
Germany, and the Netherlands were as high at times. For significant periods, 
Canada, Australia, and Argentina borrowed amounts that exceeded 10 percent of 
their GDP, a level of borrowing that sends up danger signals in the world economy 
today. In other words, it is hard to make the argument that national economies 
have a historically unprecedented level of international capital flows today.
While the relative quantity of capital flows today may not be that much differ-
ent for many countries, there are some important qualitative differences. First, 
there are many more financial instruments available now than there were a cen-
tury ago. These range from relatively mundane stocks and bonds to relatively 
exotic instruments such as derivatives, currency swaps, and others. By contrast, 
at the turn of the twentieth century, there were many fewer companies listed on 
the world’s stock exchanges and most international financial transactions involved 
the buying and selling of bonds.
A second difference today is the role of foreign exchange transactions. In 1900, 
countries had fixed exchange rates and firms in international trade or finance 
had less day-to-day risk from a sudden change in the value of a foreign currency. 
Many firms today spend significant resources to protect themselves from sudden 
shifts in currency values. Consequently, buying and selling assets denominated in 
foreign currencies is the largest component of international capital movements. 
For example, according to the Bank for International Settlements in Geneva, 
Switzerland, daily foreign exchange transactions in 2013 were equal to $5.3 trillion. 
In 1973, at the end of the last era of fixed exchange rates, they were $15 billion.
The third major difference in capital flows is that the costs of foreign financial 
transactions have fallen significantly. Economists refer to the costs of obtaining 
market information, negotiating an agreement, and enforcing the agreement as 
transaction costs. They are an important part of any business’s costs, whether it 
is a purely domestic enterprise or a company involved in foreign markets. Due to 
sheer distance, as well as differences in culture, laws, and languages, transaction 
costs are often higher in international markets than in domestic ones. Today’s 
lower transaction costs for foreign investment mean that it is less expensive to 
move capital across international boundaries.

32
Part 1    Introduction and Institutions
The volatile movement of financial capital across international boundaries is 
often mistakenly regarded as a new feature of the international economy. Specu-
lative excesses and overinvestment, followed by capital flight and bankruptcies, 
have occurred throughout the modern era, going back at least to the 1600s and 
probably earlier. U.S. and world history show a number of such cases. Financial 
crises are not a new phenomenon, nor have we learned how to avoid them—a fact 
driven home by the recent subprime mortgage crisis.
Features of Contemporary International Economic 
Relations
While international economic integration has been rapid, it does not appear to be 
historically unprecedented. The trade-to-GDP ratio is about 50 percent higher in 
the U.S. economy than it was in 1890, and manufacturers and service providers 
are more exposed to international forces. Labor is less mobile than in 1900 due to 
passport controls and work permits, but capital is more mobile and encompasses 
a larger variety of financial forms. Prices in many U.S. and foreign markets tend 
to be similar, although there are still significant differences. In quantitative terms, 
the differences between today and a hundred years ago may not be as great as 
many people imagine, but qualitatively, a number of additional features of the 
world economy separate the first decade of the twenty-first century from the first 
decade of the twentieth.
Deeper Integration  High-income countries have low barriers to imports of manu-
factured goods. There are some exceptions (processed foodstuffs and apparel), 
but as a general rule import tariffs (taxes on imports) and other barriers such as 
quotas (quantitative restrictions on imports) are much less restrictive than they 
were in the middle of the twentieth century. As trade barriers came down dur-
ing the second half of the twentieth century, two other trends began to intensify 
economic integration between countries. First, lower trade barriers exposed the 
fact that most countries have domestic policies that are obstacles to international 
trade. National regulations governing labor, environmental, and consumer safety 
standards; rules governing investment location and performance; rules defining 
fair and unfair competition; rules on government “buy-national” programs; and 
government support policies for specific industries—all have little impact on trade 
until formal trade barriers start to fall and trade volume increases. These policies 
were not implemented to protect domestic industries from foreign competition, 
and as long as tariffs were high and trade flows were limited, they did not matter 
much to trade relations. Once tariffs fell, however, many forms of domestic poli-
cies began to be viewed as barriers to increased trade. Economists sometimes refer 
to the reduction of tariffs and the elimination of quotas as shallow integration 
and negotiations over domestic policies that impact international trade as deep 
integration. Deep integration is much more contentious than shallow integration 
and much more difficult to accomplish since it involves domestic policy changes 
that align a country with rules that are created abroad, or at least negotiated with 
foreign powers.

Chapter 1    An Introduction to the World Economy 
33
A second noticeable trend over the last few decades is that technologically 
complicated goods such as smart phones and automobiles are made of compo-
nents produced in more than one country and, consequently, labels such as “Made 
in China” or “Made in the USA” are less and less meaningful. Low tariffs along 
with innovations in transportation and communication technologies have enabled 
firms to locate production of the different components of a sophisticated product 
in different countries. For example, the hardware for a 3G iPhone is produced in 
Germany, Korea, Japan, and the United States, and then it is assembled in China. 
The most valuable share of the hardware is made in Japan, but no one thinks of 
this device as a Japanese phone. In this case, as in many others, it is not accurate 
to say the product is made in one particular country since the parts come from all 
over, and the product is the result of a multinational effort involving firms and 
workers from many different countries.
These two trends raise new issues that are shaping the world economy in the 
twenty-first century. The first trend, greater interest in the consequences of differ-
ent domestic policies, makes trade negotiations more difficult and creates wide-
spread discussion of labor, environmental, and other standards that may affect 
trade flows. The second trend, greater participation in the production of a single 
product by firms in multiple countries, leads to concerns about the impact of trade 
on national economies, employment, and working conditions. National and inter-
national dialogues on these issues are a key feature of international economics in 
the twenty-first century.
Multilateral Organizations  At the end of World War II, the United States, Great 
Britain, and their allies created a number of international organizations to main-
tain international economic and political stability. Although the architects of these 
organizations could not envision the challenges and issues they would confront 
over the next fifty years, the organizations were given significant flexibility, and 
they continue to play an important and growing role in managing the issues of 
shallow and deeper integration.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the General Agree-
ment on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the United Nations (UN), the World Trade 
Organization (the WTO began operation in 1995, but grew out of the GATT), and 
a host of smaller organizations have broad international participation. They serve 
as forums for discussing and establishing rules, as mediators of disputes, and as 
organizers of actions to resolve problems. All of these organizations are controver-
sial and have come under increasing fire from critics who charge that they promote 
unsustainable economic policies or that they protect the interests of wealthy coun-
tries. Others argue that they are unnecessary foreign entanglements that severely 
limit the scope for national action (Chapter 2 examines this issue in detail). These 
organizations are attempts to create internationally acceptable rules for trade and 
commerce and to deal with potential disputes before they spill across international 
borders; they are an entirely new element in the international economy.
Regional Trade Agreements  Agreements between groups of nations are not 
new. Free-trade agreements and other forms of preferential trade have existed 

34
Part 1    Introduction and Institutions
throughout history. What is new is the significant increase in the number of 
regional trade agreements (RTAs) that have been signed in the last twenty years.
The formation of preferential trade agreements is controversial. Trade oppo-
nents dislike the provisions that expose more of the national economy to inter-
national competition, whereas some trade proponents dislike preferences that 
favor countries included in the agreement at the expense of countries outside the 
agreement. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Euro-
pean Union (EU), the Mercado Común del Sur (MERCOSUR), and the Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) are examples of RTAs, but more than 
417 have been recorded by the World Trade Organization (2016).
Trade and Economic Growth
Many people are more than a little apprehensive about increased international 
economic integration. The list of potential problems is a long one. More trade 
may give consumers lower prices and greater choices, but it also means more 
competition for firms and workers. Capital flows make more funds available for 
investment purposes, but they also increase the risk of spreading financial crises 
internationally. Rising immigration means higher incomes for migrants and lower 
labor costs or a better pool of skills for firms, but it also means more competition 
in labor markets and, inevitably, greater social tensions. International organiza-
tions may help resolve disputes, but they may also reduce national sovereignty by 
putting pressure on countries to make operational changes. Free-trade agreements 
may increase trade flows, but again, that means more competition and more pres-
sure on domestic workers and firms.
In general, economists remain firmly convinced that the benefits of trade out-
weigh the costs. There is disagreement over the best way to achieve different 
goals (for example, how to protect against the harmful effects of sudden flows of 
capital), but the general belief that openness to the world economy is a superior 
policy to closing off a country is quite strong. To support this stance, economists 
can point to the following kinds of evidence:
■
■Casual empirical evidence of historical experience
■
■Evidence based on economic models and deductive reasoning
■
■Evidence from statistical comparisons of countries
While none of these is conclusive by itself, together they provide solid support 
for the idea that open economies generally grow faster and prosper more than 
closed ones.
The historical evidence examines the experiences of countries that tried to iso-
late themselves from the world economy. There are the experiences of the 1930s, 
when most countries tried to protect themselves from world events by shutting 
out flows of goods, capital, and labor. This did not cause the Great Depression 
of the 1930s, but it did worsen it, and ultimately it led to the misery and tragedy 
of World War II. There are also the parallel experiences of countries that were 
divided by war, with one side becoming closed to the world economy, and the 

Chapter 1    An Introduction to the World Economy 
35
other side open. Germany (East versus West), Korea (North versus South), and 
China (mainland China before the 1980s versus Taiwan and Hong Kong) are the 
best examples.
Economic theory generally supports these examples by suggesting the causal 
mechanisms that lead from trade to faster growth. Generally, the benefits of increased 
innovation, competitive pressure to raise productivity levels, and access to new tech-
nologies and ideas that are fostered by trade are positive factors. On the consumer 
side, trade provides a greater variety of goods and offers them at lower prices.
The statistical evidence of the benefits of more open economies comes from 
comparisons of large samples of countries over different periods. While the sta-
tistical tests of the relationship between trade policy and economic growth suffer 
from their own technical shortcomings, the results consistently show that more 
open economies grow faster. These results cannot be viewed as absolutely con-
clusive, but together with trade theory and the casual empirical evidence drawn 
from historical experiences, the available statistical analysis provides additional 
support for the notion that trade is usually beneficial.
TWELVE THEMES IN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS
Each of the twelve themes discussed next are examined in the chapters that fol-
low. These themes are overlapping, multidimensional, and often go beyond pure 
economics. International economic analysis cannot claim the final word, but it is 
hoped that it will provide you an analytically powerful and logically consistent 
approach for thinking about the issues raised by these themes.
The Gains from Trade and New Trade Theory  
(Chapters 3, 4, and 5)
Why is international trade desirable? We have briefly addressed this issue, and 
we will consider additional points as we continue. Given that economic analysis 
clearly demonstrates that the benefits of international trade outweigh the costs, 
it is not surprising that virtually all economists generally support open markets 
and increased trade. The benefits of international trade were first analyzed in the 
late 1700s and are perhaps the oldest and strongest finding in all of economics. 
More recently, economists have begun to analyze returns to scale within firms and 
industries. Under the label “New Trade Theory,” economists have demonstrated 
a number of new sources of national welfare improvements due to international 
trade and added greater sophistication to our understanding of market structure 
and trade effects.
Wages, Jobs, and Protection (Chapters 3, 6, 7, and 8)
International trade raises national welfare, but it does not benefit every member 
of society. Workers in firms that cannot compete may be forced to find new jobs 
or take pay cuts. The fact that consumers pay less for the goods they buy, or that 

36
Part 1    Introduction and Institutions
exporters hire more workers, may not help laid off workers. Increased awareness 
of the international economy has heightened the fears of people who feel vulner-
able to change. They are concerned that wages in high-income countries must fall 
in order to compete with workers in low-wage countries, and that their jobs may 
be moved overseas. One of the key challenges for policymakers is to find the right 
mix of domestic policies so that the nation benefits from trade without creating a 
backlash from those individuals and industries that are hurt.
Trade Deficits (Chapters 9, 11, and 12)
In 1980, a comprehensive measure of trade accounts in the United States showed 
that there was a slight surplus. Every year since then, the United States has had 
a trade deficit and the sum of the deficits since 2000 is more than $7.9 trillion 
(2001 through 2010). The United States was not the only country running deficits, 
but each year a country runs a deficit in its trade accounts, it must borrow from 
abroad, essentially selling a piece of its future output in order to obtain more 
goods and services today. As the United States and other countries borrowed, 
China, Germany, Japan, and oil producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia lent. 
These large imbalances in lending and borrowing played a key role in the crisis 
that began in 2007.
Regional Trade Agreements (Chapters 2, 13, and 14)
As the world economy becomes more integrated, some regions are running ahead 
of the general trend. Western Europeans, for example, have eliminated many of 
the economic barriers separating their nations, and are creating a broad political 
and economic union. With implementation of NAFTA in 1994, the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico became a free-trade area. All three countries have signed 
individual agreements with most of Central America and recently negotiated a 
trade pact (yet to be implemented as of 2016) with nine other Pacific-region coun-
tries. The United States continues to negotiate with countries in South America 
and Asia, including China, and more than 400 regional trade agreements have 
been negotiated world-wide. Since 2004, ten Central and Eastern European coun-
tries have joined the EU, along with two small Mediterranean states. The ten 
members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have moved 
to create a free-trade zone, and China has become an active participant in trade 
agreements, along with a number of other countries. The pros and cons of these 
and other agreements is an active area of economic interest and will be considered 
in several chapters.
The Resolution of Trade Conflicts (Chapters 2, 7, and 8)
Commercial conflicts between nations cover a wide variety of issues and com-
plaints. In one sense these conflicts are routine, as the WTO provides a formal 
dispute resolution procedure that has the assent of most of the world’s nations. 
The WTO process does not cover all goods and services, however, nor does it say 

Chapter 1    An Introduction to the World Economy 
37
much about a large number of practices that some nations find objectionable. The 
ability of nations to resolve conflicts without resorting to protectionist measures is 
one key to maintaining a healthy international economic environment. Disputes 
can become acrimonious, so it is imperative that differences of opinion are not 
permitted to escalate into a wider disagreement. Trade wars are not real wars, but 
they are harmful nonetheless.
The Role of International Institutions  
(Chapters 2, 8, and 12)
The organization with the greatest responsibility for resolving trade disagreements 
is the WTO. The WTO came into existence in 1995 and was an adaptation of the 
GATT, which was created shortly after World War II. Resolving trade disputes is 
only one of the new roles played by international organizations. Various organiza-
tions offer development support, technical economic advice, emergency loans in 
a crisis situation, and other services and assistance. These organizations perform 
services that were not offered before World War II (development support), or that 
were done by a single country (lending in a crisis)—usually the world’s greatest 
military power. They exist today only through the mutual consent and coopera-
tion of participating nations; without that cooperation, they would dissolve. Their 
abilities are limited, however. They cannot prevent crises, and they cannot make 
poor countries rich. They are also controversial and are viewed by some as tools 
of the United States or as a threat to national independence. They are very likely 
to grow in function, however, as many international problems cannot be solved 
by individual nations alone.
Exchange Rates and the Macroeconomy  
(Chapters 10 and 11)
Seventeen of the twenty-seven members of the EU have adopted the euro as a 
common currency, and several more are preparing to join them in spite of the 
euro crisis that began in 2011. Panama, El Salvador, and Ecuador use the U.S. 
dollar. Some members of the U.S. Congress and some economists think that China 
artificially manipulates its currency to gain commercial advantages, and China’s 
leaders worry that the United States might let the dollar sink in value to depreci-
ate its foreign debt. Exchange rate systems come in a variety of forms and link 
the domestic economy to the rest of the world. They can help protect a country 
against harmful developments outside its borders, but they can also magnify and 
transmit those developments to the domestic economy. Exchange rates play a key 
role in the international economy.
Financial Crises and Global Contagion (Chapter 12)
As international trade and investment barriers declined, and as new communica-
tions and transportation systems developed, increasing quantities of capital flowed 
across national borders. These flows were encouraged by financial innovation and 

38
Part 1    Introduction and Institutions
a general spirit of deregulation that held sway in much of the world from the late 
1970s forward. Capital flows brought many desirable things, such as investment, 
new technology, and higher consumption, but they also often outpaced our abil-
ity to monitor and supervise, and were frequently at the root of financial crises, 
including the severe global crisis that began in 2007. Economists are engaged in a 
broad discussion today, aimed at finding techniques for reducing the macroeco-
nomic and financial volatility caused by capital flows without hampering the new 
investment and lending that they provide.
Capital Flows and the Debt of Developing 
Countries (Chapters 2, 9, and 12)
In 1996, the World Bank and the IMF began a debt relief program for a group of 
forty-two countries labeled the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). Thirty-four 
of these countries are in Africa. At the same time, non-governmental groups and 
celebrities, such as Bono, began to lobby successfully for a reduction in the debts of 
poor countries and for changes in the lending policies of rich countries. In many parts 
of the world, problems of extreme poverty are compounded by large foreign debts 
that are unlikely to be repaid and often require a constant supply of new loans to 
pay interest on the old ones. The search for workable solutions is complicated in the 
borrowing countries by economic shocks, corruption, and unsustainable economic 
policies. Common problems in the lending countries include unwise loans to corrupt 
dictators and loans for some expensive and unnecessary goods sold by rich countries.
Latin America and the World Economy (Chapter 15)
In Latin America, the 1980s are known as the Lost Decade. High levels of debt, 
deep recessions, and hyperinflation caused the region to lose a decade of growth 
and development. In response, many countries embarked on a profound shift in 
their economic policies. They opened markets, allowed increased foreign invest-
ment, signed trade agreements, and ended a long period of relative isolation from 
the world economy. These policy changes became known as the Washington Con-
sensus and helped to bring an end to the Lost Decade, but few economists think 
the policies were successful. Growth remained relatively low in many places, 
financial crises continued to undermine economic gains, and traditional issues of 
economic fairness were largely ignored. Latin American countries have developed 
a wide variety of new policies and experiments as they try to reduce poverty, gen-
erate prosperity, and provide opportunity for all their citizens.
Export-Led Growth in East Asia (Chapter 16)
Throughout the late 1980s and into the 1990s, it was hard to ignore the East 
Asian “miracle.” While some economists point out that it was not really a mir-
acle—just a lot of hard work and sound economic policies—the growth rates of 
the “high-performance Asian economies” were unique in human history. Rates 
of growth of real GDP per person commonly reached 4 to 5 percent per year, 

Chapter 1    An Introduction to the World Economy 
39
with 6 to 8 percent not unusual. In 1997, an economic and financial crisis hit the 
region hard. Although there were lingering effects, by 2000 the economies of the 
region’s developing countries were growing at more than 7 percent a year. One 
of the dominant traits of the countries in East Asia is the extent to which they are 
outward looking and dependent on the growth of their manufactured exports.
China and India in the World Economy (Chapter 17)
China and India are the most populous countries in the world. In 2016, China’s 
1.37 billion people plus India’s 1.25 billion accounted for nearly 36 percent of the 
world’s population of 7.30 billion. Throughout much of the twentieth century, 
neither country had deep economic ties with nations other than India’s tie to its 
colonial power, and neither had much impact on the world economy. Change 
began in 1978, when China started its dramatic shift away from isolationism. Chi-
nese reforms led to an ever-growing presence of foreign investment, more exports 
and imports, fewer restrictions on privately owned enterprises, rapid urbanization, 
and in 2001, membership in the WTO. India’s transformation from a relatively 
closed economy toward greater openness began later, in 1991, and has proceeded 
at a slower pace. Nevertheless, its sheer population size coupled with the techni-
cal excellence of its scientists and engineers and its developing high technology 
sector have turned it into a growing force in the world economy. Low wages and 
competitive firms and technologies in China and India have caught the attention 
of nearly all developing and developed nations, and have generated a variety of 
fears and opportunities, both realistic and unrealistic.

INTRODUCTION: INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND ISSUES 
SINCE WORLD WAR II
LO 2.1	 Classify with examples the main types of international economic organizations.
As World War II was drawing to a close, representatives from the United States, Great 
Britain, and other Allied nations met in the small New Hampshire town of Bretton 
Woods. The outcome of these meetings was a series of agreements that created an 
exchange rate system (which lasted until 1971); the International Bank for Reconstruc-
tion and Development (IBRD), also known as the World Bank; and the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF). In 1946, two years after Bretton Woods, twenty-three nations 
including the United States and Great Britain began talks on reducing their trade bar-
riers, leading to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which began 
operation in 1948. This chapter focuses on these global economic institutions, their 
history, their role in the world economy, and controversies surrounding their activities.
International Institutions
International economic institutions are an important feature of the world economy. 
When social scientists try to explain the increasing integration of national economies 
after World War II, one of the key explanations must be the increased stability and 
reduced uncertainty that these institutions help to create. Nevertheless, as interna-
tional economic integration has increased, these organizations have come under more

Part 1    Introduction and Institutions
scrutiny and received much criticism. Before we look at their impact and some 
of the criticisms levied at them, we should define what we mean by an institution.
When most people hear the word institution, they probably think of a formal 
organization. However, economists tend to define institutions more abstractly. 
For example, the “New Institutionalists,” led by economist Douglas North, have 
argued that organizations are not institutions in themselves, but are rather the 
rules that govern behavior—telling us what is permissible and what is not and 
acting as constraints that limit our actions.
Institutions can be formal or informal. A formal institution is a written set of 
rules that explicitly state what is and is not allowed. The rules may be embodied 
in a club, an association, or a legal system. An informal institution is a custom 
or tradition that tells people how to act in different situations but without legal 
enforcement. For example, informal institutions include the rules of socializing, 
gift exchange, table manners, e-mail etiquette, and so on. In this chapter, the term 
institution refers to both rules and organizations.
A Taxonomy of International Economic Institutions
International economic institutions come in many shapes and sizes. They can be 
lobbying groups for a particular commodity or an international producer’s asso-
ciation, the joint management by several nations of a common resource, trade 
agreements or development funds for a select group of nations, or even global 
associations. Although this chapter’s focus is on global economic institutions, it 
is useful to look at a taxonomy of international economic institutions, from the 
most limited and specific, to the most general. Table 2.1 shows five main types.

THE IMF, THE WORLD BANK, AND THE WTO
LO 2.2	 Identify economic circumstances in which the IMF, the World Bank, 
and the WTO are active.
Three global organizations play a major role in international economic relations 
and are central to this book: the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World 
Bank, and the World Trade Organization (WTO). The IMF and the World Bank 
date from the end of World War II; the WTO began in 1995 and grew out of the 
GATT, which it deepens and broadens. Accordingly, it is useful to know the his-
tory and function of the GATT as well as the WTO.
The IMF and World Bank
During World War II, the United States, Great Britain, and several other nations 
held regular discussions about the shape of the postwar international economic 
order. They wanted to avoid the mistakes of the 1920s and 1930s, when a lack of 
international cooperation led to the complete collapse of economic relations. The 
culmination of these talks was the Bretton Woods conference held in July 1944, in 
Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. The agreement was largely a result of negotia-
tions between the United States and the United Kingdom, and led directly to the 
creation of the IMF and the IBRD, which later became the World Bank.
The IMF began operation on December 27, 1945, with a membership of twenty-
nine countries. Over time, it added new members and is currently at 188 countries. 
The IMF provides loans to its members under different programs for the short, 
medium, and long term. Each member is charged a fee, or quota, as the price of 
membership. The size of the quota varies with the size of the nation’s economy and 
the importance of its currency in world trade and payments. Important decisions 
within the IMF are made by vote with the weight of each nation’s vote proportional 
to its quota. This gives the high-income countries of the world a voting power that is 
disproportionate to their population. For example, the United States alone controls 
nearly 17 percent of the total votes, and the seven largest high-income industrial 
economies (Canada, Italy, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the 
United States) control almost 45 percent. Some votes on IMF policy require a “super 
majority” of 85 percent, giving the United States a veto power on those particular 
issues. In 2008, the asymmetry in quotas and votes came under pressure from dynamic 
emerging economies that wanted more say in IMF policies and from advanced econo-
mies that wanted to increase quotas paid by other members. In 2010, a reform of votes 
and quotas was agreed upon but has not yet been implemented as of 2012.
The most visible role for the IMF is to intercede, by invitation, whenever a 
nation experiences a crisis in its international payments. For example, if a country 
imports more than it exports, then it may run out of foreign exchange reserves. 
Foreign exchange reserves are dollars, yen, pounds, euros, or another currency 
(or gold) that is accepted internationally. In addition, the IMF has its own cur-
rency, called an SDR, or special drawing right. SDRs are based on a country’s 
quota and are a part of its international reserves. If a country lacks reserves, it 

44
Part 1    Introduction and Institutions
cannot pay for its imports, nor can it pay the interest and principal it owes on its 
international borrowings. This is one scenario that warrants a call to the IMF. The 
IMF makes loans to its members, but it usually extracts a price above and beyond 
the interest it charges. The price is an agreement by the borrower to change its 
policies so that the problem cannot recur. If simple economic reforms such as a 
cut in the value of the currency, or limits on the central bank’s creation of credit, 
are insufficient to solve the problem permanently, then the IMF usually requires 
a borrower to make fundamental changes in the relationship between government 
and markets in order to qualify for IMF funds. These requirements are known 
as IMF conditionality. For example, during the crisis of 1997–1998, the IMF was 
the main provider of funds and expertise to East Asia, again, with a great deal of 
controversy over the advice it gave and the conditions it imposed.
The IMF’s resources for dealing with crises are limited. When the United 
States and other large economies experienced the crisis that began in 2007, IMF 
resources were far from adequate for addressing the issues. In 2009, the largest 
member countries voted to increase its resources to $750 billion, still far below 
the amount necessary to stem a crisis in the United States or in other large econo-
mies. In part, this reflects the institution’s asymmetry, as high-income countries 
are generally unwilling to give the IMF either the funds or the power to allow it 
to intervene effectively in their economies.
The World Bank is the other major organization that emerged from the Bretton 
Woods Conference. It has the same membership and a similar structure. Members 
buy shares that convey voting rights on policy proportional to the shares. The orig-
inal purpose of the World Bank was to provide financing mechanisms for rebuild-
ing Europe at the end of World War II; however, it was soon apparent that its 
capital reserves were inadequate to the task. In addition, the United States found 
it politically preferable to have more direct control over the reconstruction funds, 
rather than routing them through an international organization. Hence, the job 
of reconstruction was directed toward the newly created Marshall Plan, and the 
World Bank moved toward assisting development in non-industrial economies.
The GATT, the Uruguay Round, and the WTO
At the end of World War II, a third global economic organization, the Interna-
tional Trade Organization (ITO), was proposed. If it had been created, the ITO’s 
job would have been to establish rules relating to world trade, business practices, 
and international investment. U.S. opposition killed the idea of the ITO, however, 
and no such organization was created until 1995. Nevertheless, in 1946, while 
they were still considering the idea of the ITO, twenty-three countries opened 
negotiations over tariff reductions. These negotiations led to about 45,000 tariff 
reductions affecting $10 billion, or one-fifth of world trade. In addition, a number 
of agreements were made on rules for trade, with the expectation that the rules 
would become a part of the ITO. Both the tariff reductions and the rules were 
implemented in 1948; when the possibility of an ITO died in 1950, the agreements 
on tariffs and trade rules remained in force as a separate agreement, known as 

Chapter 2    International Economic Institutions Since World War II 
45
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The GATT has been very 
successful in bringing down trade barriers gradually. One indicator is that inter-
national trade has grown over the last fifty years from 5 percent of world gross 
domestic product (GDP) to over 31 percent in 2011.
The GATT functions through a series of trade rounds in which countries peri-
odically negotiate a set of incremental tariff reductions. Gradually, through the 
Kennedy Round in the mid-1960s and the Tokyo Round of the 1970s, trade rules 
other than tariffs began to be addressed, including the problems of dumping (sell-
ing in a foreign market below cost or below a fair price), subsidies to industry, and 
nontariff barriers to trade.
The GATT intentionally ignored the extremely contentious sectors of agricul-
ture, textiles, and apparel. In addition, trade in services was ignored because it was 
not important. The accumulation of unresolved issues in these sectors, however, 
along with the increased importance of nontariff trade barriers, led to the demand 
for a new, more extensive set of negotiations. These demands culminated in the 
Uruguay Round of trade negotiations that began in 1986. Among other outcomes, 
the Uruguay Round created the World Trade Organization (1995). In 2016, there 
are 162 members and 22 other governments with observer status.
The WTO continues trade talks and sector-specific discussions between 
comprehensive rounds of negotiations. For example, in 1997, sixty-nine coun-
tries signed an agreement to open their telecommunication sectors, and another 
seventy agreed to significant opening in their financial services sectors. In addi-
tion, every two years, trade ministers from the member countries meet to set the 
WTO’s policy objectives. In 2001, trade ministers meeting in Doha, Qatar, agreed 
to launch a new round of trade negotiations emphasizing issues of developing 
countries. The Doha Round proposed a Doha Development Agenda to consider 
trade issues of importance to developing countries. The key issues are farm subsi-
dies and agricultural protection and trade in services. These issues are contentious 
and progress has been stalled. In all likelihood, the Doha Round will be the first 
round of GATT or WTO sponsored negotiations to fail. As of 2016, the negotia-
tions are fifteen years old and show no sign of success. Nevertheless, while a com-
prehensive agreement on all the issues under discussion seems unlikely, member 
countries continue to negotiate on specific issues, such as trade and food security, 
and special safeguards to protect developing countries from sudden surges in 
imports that threaten a particular industry. Even with a failed Doha Round, the 
agreements and rules negotiated under the auspices of the GATT and the WTO 
remain the core set of international trade rules.
The foundation of all WTO and GATT agreements are the principles of 
national treatment and nondiscrimination. National treatment is the require-
ment that foreign goods are treated similarly to the same domestic goods once 
they enter a nation’s markets. Nondiscrimination is embodied in the concept of 
­most-favored nation (MFN) status. MFN requires all WTO members to treat 
each other as they treat their most-favored trading partner. In effect, this is a 
prohibition against discrimination. Somewhat contradictorily, MFN allows trade 
agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and 

46
Part 1    Introduction and Institutions
the European Union (EU) even though every trade agreement causes countries to 
discriminate in favor of each other and implicitly against nonmembers. In theory, 
the WTO permits such agreements as long as they do not harm the overall level 
of international trade, and in practice, the WTO has never challenged the validity 
of a trade agreement between member countries.
C A S E  S T U D Y
The GATT Rounds
Agreements in the GATT forum to reduce trade barriers take place in rounds 
of negotiations. Counting the first round, there have been nine rounds of nego-
tiations, with the Doha Round still in progress. Originally, the GATT was an 
international agreement and not an organization. The failure to create the 
International Trade Organization in 1950, however, resulted in the gradual 
conversion of the GATT into a de facto organization by 1960, with a perma-
nent secretariat to manage it from Geneva. Table 2.2 lists the various rounds 
of negotiations.
The first five rounds were organized around product-by-product negotiations 
in which countries mutually cut their tariffs on specific products. Beginning with 
the Kennedy Round, negotiations were simplified as countries negotiated an 
across-the-board percentage reduction in all tariffs for a range of industrial 
products. One effect is that tariffs have never been uniform across countries. 
The goal has been to bring them all down, but not to create the same tariff for 
all countries.
The Tokyo Round is notable because it was the first round to begin to 
establish rules regarding subsidies. Subsidies give an industry a competitive

REGIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS
LO 2.3	 Compare the different levels of integration found in regional trade 
agreements with examples.
Regional trade agreements (RTAs) between two or more countries are another 
important institution in the world economy. Many of these have familiar names, 
such as NAFTA and the EU. Regional agreements can be classified into one of five 
categories, although they often combine elements from a couple of the categories.
Five Types of Regional Trade Agreements
RTAs are bilateral (two countries) or plurilateral (several countries). The WTO 
is not an RTA because it is worldwide in scope and not just regional. In trade 
jargon it is called a multilateral agreement because it includes, potentially, all 
the countries of the world. Some plurilateral agreements are quite large, such as 
the EU, which has twenty-eight members, or the proposed free-trade area of the 
Pacific, called the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group, which has twenty-
one. Table 2.3 lists five types of trade agreements and their characteristics.
advantage, since the national government pays part of the cost of production, 
either through direct payment or indirectly through subsidized interest rates, 
artificially cheap access to foreign currency, or some other way. The Tokyo 
Round began the laborious process of creating rules in this area, one of the 
most important being the agreement to prohibit subsidies for exports of indus-
trial goods (but not agricultural goods or textiles and apparel).
The subsidy issue of the Tokyo Round was carried forward into the Uruguay 
Round, where subsidies were defined in greater detail. The Uruguay Round 
accomplished many other things as well, not the least of which was the creation 
of the WTO as a formal organization to oversee and administer the GATT. 
Additional accomplishments are described in Chapter 7, which explores trade 
policy and trade barriers in more detail.

Prominent Regional Trade Agreements
Each of the five levels of integration is an example of a different kind of regional 
trade agreement (RTA), or trade bloc. The question naturally arises as to how 
many agreements there are and whether they are beneficial or harmful for the 
world economy. The simple question of how many is difficult to answer pre-
cisely. Many of the agreements do not fit neatly into any of the five categories, 
so it is not clear they should be counted. That is, should all partial agreements 
be counted when they are not quite free-trade areas, yet they have elements of 
free trade, customs unions, and even common markets? In addition, many of 
the agreements exist either on paper only (have no real effect), or have yet to be 
fully negotiated and/or implemented. Until there is substantial implementation, 
there is always the possibility that the agreement will collapse, because opening 
an economy inevitably generates opposition from uncompetitive sectors.
Countries that have signed the GATT are obligated to notify the GATT sec-
retariat when they form an RTA. According to the WTO, since the implemen-
tation of the GATT in 1948 they have been notified of more than 500 RTAs. 
Some of these are defunct, but 417 were active in 2016. Most of the functioning 
agreements were started in the 1990s or 2000s.
The answer to the second question posited earlier—are agreements benefi-
cial or harmful?—is even more difficult to answer. A 1995 study by the WTO 
concluded that in most cases “regional and multilateral integration initiatives 
are complements rather than alternatives.”* Broadly speaking, the WTO sees 
these agreements as helping it to further reduce trade barriers. This view is 
not shared by all economists, however, as any regional agreement must favor 
the interests of its members over the interests of outsiders. In other words, 
there is an element of discrimination that goes against the WTO’s fundamen-
tal principle of equal treatment (most favored nation). Preferential treatment 
for members of the trade agreement causes most regional trade agreements 
to destroy some of the trade between their members and nonmembers. The 
WTO recognizes this problem, but argues that as long as a regional agreement 
creates more new trade than it destroys, the net result is beneficial. In addition, 
the WTO sees the regional trade agreements as places where countries can try 
out new arrangements, some of which will be eventually incorporated into the 
larger, global agreement.
Nearly all WTO members belong to at least one RTA, and many countries 
belong to several. For example, Mexico is a member of NAFTA (Canada-­
Mexico-United States) but in 2000 it entered a free-trade agreement with the EU.  
It has also signed free trade and other agreements with other countries, 
­including Chile, Japan, Israel, and Costa Rica, among others. Table 2.4 lists

EFTA, the NAFTA, MERCOSUR in South America, the ASEAN Free Trade

TABLE 2.4  Prominent Regional Trade Blocs
A partial trade agreement is the least comprehensive RTA. It occurs when two 
or more countries agree to drop trade barriers in one or a few economic sectors, 
such as steel, autos, or any other line of production. Partial trade agreements are 
used when countries are reluctant to open all sectors, but they desire free trade 
for a limited set of goods.
As more goods are included in the partial trade agreement, it begins to look 
more like a free-trade area. One example is NAFTA, but there are many others, 

50
Part 1    Introduction and Institutions
such as the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) and the U.S.-Israel Free Trade 
Agreement. In a free-trade area, nations trade goods and services across inter-
national boundaries without paying a tariff and without the limitations imposed 
by quotas, which are direct limits on imports. In reality, however, most free-trade 
areas such as NAFTA do not allow completely free trade. Nations usually reserve 
some restrictions for particularly sensitive items. For example, as part of its efforts 
to protect its culture, Canada limits the number of U.S. television programs that 
Canadian television stations may purchase. With a free-trade area, nations usu-
ally keep their own health, safety, and technical standards, and may deny entry of 
imports if they do not meet national standards.
The next level of integration is called a customs union. A customs union is a 
free-trade area plus a common external tariff toward nonmembers. By 1968, the EU 
(then called the European Economic Community) had become a customs union, 
and in today’s economy, MERCOSUR (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and 
Venezuela) aspire to become one. As with free-trade areas, many items are usually 
left out of the agreement. In the European case, for example, each nation retained 
its own tariffs and quotas with respect to Japanese autos. Common markets are the 
next level beyond customs unions. A common market is a customs union plus an 
agreement to allow the free mobility of inputs, such as labor and capital. The clear-
est example is the EU in the 1990s. The three NAFTA countries have elements of a 
common market (without the common external tariff) because they allow capital to 
move freely around the region. NAFTA also grants relatively free movement to cer-
tain types of white-collar labor, such as architects, business consultants, and others.
The final level of economic integration is an economic union. An economic 
union is a common market with substantial coordination of macroeconomic poli-
cies, including a common currency, and harmonization of many standards and 
regulations. The clearest examples are the states of the United States or the prov-
inces of Canada. The BENELUX Union of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Lux-
embourg is an example of separate nations that have formed a union, and the EU 
is in the process of becoming an economic union, with the euro as its common 
currency, and at some point, with a common defense policy, common citizenship 
rights, and a common fiscal policy.
Regional Trade Agreements and the WTO
When a WTO member signs an RTA, it is obligated to notify the WTO. Since 
1948, over 500 agreements have been listed with the WTO, with a majority of 
the notifications having occurred since 1990. Not all of these agreements are still 
active, but 338 were considered active at the start of 2012.
RTAs are inherently discriminatory since countries in an RTA discriminate in 
favor of each other and thereby deny most-favored nation treatment to non-RTA 
members. Nevertheless, the GATT and the WTO have allowed RTAs under the 
assumption that they create more new trade than they destroy with their discrimi-
natory practices. In economic terms, trade creation must exceed trade diversion. 
An example will clarify these two concepts.

Chapter 2    International Economic Institutions Since World War II 
51
Suppose that the United States imports apparel from a wide variety of locales, 
including Haiti. Further, suppose that the United States has high tariffs on apparel, 
but the tariffs are nondiscriminatory and therefore in compliance with the WTO 
rules. If Haiti is a low-cost producer, then after paying the same tariff that all 
exporters to the United States face, its goods will be competitive in the U.S. mar-
ket. One last assumption is that Mexico also produces apparel, but its costs are 
above Haiti’s, so most U.S. imports come from Haiti, not Mexico. In this hypothet-
ical example, when the United States signs a free-trade agreement with Mexico, 
Mexican apparel can enter the United States without paying a tariff, while Haiti 
continues to pay. As a result, even though Mexico has higher costs of production 
than Haiti, its goods could become cheaper in the U.S. market. In that case, trade 
is diverted from Haiti to Mexico, even though Haiti is the low-cost producer. This 
would be a backward step in world production since resources would be allocated 
from the lower-cost producer to the higher-cost one, and it is precisely this type 
of change the WTO rules are meant to guard against.
The GATT/WTO agreement recognizes that most RTAs create some trade 
diversion, but the goal is to create more new trade, due to the dropping of bar-
riers between trading partners, so that new trade outweighs the value of trade 
that is diverted. Something very close to the hypothetical scenario just described, 
however, occurred throughout many parts of the Caribbean Basin and Central 
America when the United States, Mexico, and Canada became a free-trade area 
in 1995. In response, the United States provided financial assistance and relaxed 
its trade barriers for countries in Central America and the Caribbean.
For and Against RTAs
The arguments for and against RTAs involve more than pure economics. Poli-
tics, international relations, and national security also play a role. The central 
economic question is whether they are supportive of a gradual, long-run increase 
in world trade, or whether they tend to become obstacles to further relaxation of 
trade barriers. In trade jargon, the issue is whether they are building blocks or 
stumbling blocks.
Proponents of trade agreements view them as building blocks toward freer, 
more open world trade. They have several arguments on their side. First, it is 
easier for a few countries to reach agreement than it is for all the countries in the 
WTO. Therefore, RTAs create conditions where countries can lower their barri-
ers without having to negotiate an agreement with all 162 members. Second, the 
domestic effects of a reduction of trade barriers are less dramatic since an RTA 
covers less than the world economy, and thereby limits the sudden surge of com-
petition that might occur if all the WTO nations adopted the same policies. This 
also allows members to go further and to potentially open more than they would 
under a multilateral agreement. Third, RTA member countries can experiment 
with new agreements that are impossible among a large number of countries, such 
as the opening of certain types of services that have been traditionally closed. 
Insurance and telecommunications are examples. And fourth, RTAs can be used 

52
Part 1    Introduction and Institutions
as a political and economic threat to encourage agreements in the WTO forum. 
For example, some argue that the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement helped push 
countries toward conclusion of the Uruguay Round agreement, as they feared the 
United States might develop its own regional bloc and abandon its multilateral 
commitments.
Opponents of RTAs question many of these assumptions. Their greatest 
criticism is that RTAs undermine progress toward multilateral (worldwide) 
agreements. Pro-trade opponents of RTAs do not believe that they encourage 
agreements through the WTO, but instead they believe that they polarize coun-
tries and draw energy away from the work of reaching agreement. Opponents 
point out that RTAs are often discriminatory against poor and less-developed 
countries, particularly when they involve a rich giant like the United States and 
small, developing countries such as Guatemala and El Salvador. Not only are low-
income countries unable to negotiate forcefully, they often lack the resources and 
infrastructure that will be needed to take advantage of a market opening. Further, 
in their view, rich countries like the United States have no need of trade barriers 
against products from small developing countries.
THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS
LO 2.4	 Analyze the roles of international economic organizations.
People rely on institutions to create order and reduce uncertainty. By defining 
the constraints or limits on economic, political, and social interactions, institutions 
define the incentive system of a society and help to create stability. The provision 
of order and the reduction of uncertainty are so important that when they are 
absent, economies cannot grow. Within a nation, the formal rules of behavior are 
defined by the various levels of government. In the United States, for example, 
these include cities, counties, special districts, states, and the federal government. 
In the international sphere, however, there are no corresponding levels of govern-
ment. The establishment of rules for international trade and international mac-
roeconomic relations are dependent on the voluntary associations of nations in 
international economic organizations.
The primary difference between international economic organizations and the 
government of a single nation is that the former have limited enforcement power. 
National and local governments have police powers they can use to enforce their 
rules; international organizations have no police power, but they do have more 
subtle powers for encouraging cooperation. For example, the IMF and World 
Bank can withdraw lines of credit to developing countries. The withdrawal of 
IMF credit raises a red flag for private lenders and makes it more costly for unco-
operative nations to gain access to private capital markets. Likewise, the WTO 
can legitimize retaliatory sanctions against nations that fail to honor their trade 
obligations. Basically, however, international organizations rely on moral persua-
sion and the commitments of individual nations to remain effective. If individual 

Chapter 2    International Economic Institutions Since World War II 
53
nations choose not to join or decide to withdraw their support, there is nothing 
the IMF, World Bank, or WTO can do.
The provision of order and the reduction of uncertainty are services that every-
one values. This is why we pay police officers, judges, and legislators. Although 
public order and the lessening of uncertainty are intangibles, they are desired 
and valued in the same sense as more tangible material objects. Their economic 
characteristics are different from those of most goods and services, however, and 
they fall into the category known as public goods.
The Definition of Public Goods
By definition, public goods are nonexcludable and nonrival or nondiminishable. 
Nonexcludability means that the normal price mechanism does not work as a way 
of regulating access. For example, when a signal is broadcast on the airwaves by a 
television station, anyone with a TV set who lives in its range can pick it up. (Of 
course, this is not the case with cable stations, which are granted permission to 
scramble their signals. Signal scrambling is a clever technological solution to the 
problem of nonexcludability.)
The second characteristic of public goods is that they are nonrival or nondimin-
ishable. This refers to the attribute of not being diminished by consumption. For 
example, if I tune in to the broadcast signal of a local TV station, my neighbors 
will have the same signal amount available to them. Most goods get smaller, or 
diminish, when they are consumed, but public goods do not.
Private markets often fail to supply optimal levels of public goods because of 
the problem of free riding. Free riding means that there is no incentive to pay for 
public goods because people cannot be excluded from consumption. Given this 
characteristic, public goods will not be produced optimally by free markets unless 
institutional arrangements can somehow overcome the free riding. In most cases, 
governments step in as providers and use their powers to tax as a means to force 
people to pay for the goods.
Maintaining Order and Reducing Uncertainty
Two of the most important functions of international economic institutions are 
to maintain order in international economic relations and to reduce uncertainty. 
Together, these functions are often instrumental in the avoidance of a global eco-
nomic crisis. Furthermore, if a national crisis threatens to become global, interna-
tional institutions often help to bring it to a less costly end and to prevent nations 
from shifting the cost of national problems to other countries.
The maintenance of order and the reduction of uncertainty are general tasks 
that require specific rules in a number of areas of international economic interac-
tion, although economists do not completely agree on the specific rules or the spe-
cific types of cooperation that should be provided. Nevertheless, the proponents 
of international institutions, such as economist Charles Kindleberger, have noted 
several areas where institutions are needed in order to strengthen cooperation and 

54

prevent free riding in the provision of international public goods. Among these 
items are the four public goods listed in Table 2.5.
Kindleberger and others have argued that the absence of a set of rules for 
providing one or more of these public goods is usually part of the explanation of 
historical crises such as the worldwide Great Depression of the 1930s. If no inter-
national institutions are available to help nations overcome the tendency to free 
ride, then international economic stability grows more fragile. As an illustration, 
consider the first item listed in Table 2.5. During recessions, politicians begin to 
feel enormous pressure to close markets in order to protect jobs at home. During 
the 1930s, for example, most nations enacted high tariffs and restrictive quotas 
on imports. This set in motion waves of retaliation as other nations followed 
suit and imposed their own tariffs and quotas. In the end, no one benefited and 
international trade collapsed. By comparison, during the worldwide recession 
of 2008 and 2009, national commitments to maintain open markets as agreed 
under the rules of the WTO prevented individual countries from raising tariffs or 
implementing quotas even when there were strong domestic political pressures 
for closing markets.
In a recession, free riders want to close their markets to reduce imports and 
create more jobs. At the same time, however, they want all other nations to stay 
open so that they do not lose any export markets. These motives are inconsis-
tent, and the effect of free riding behavior is that all countries retaliate by clos-
ing their markets, international trade collapses, and everyone is worse off than 
before. Kindleberger shows that the shift in trade policies toward high tariffs 
and restrictive quotas helped to intensify and spread the Great Depression of 
the 1930s.
Kindleberger also argues that the sudden decline in capital flows to developing 
countries in the 1930s and the complete absence of a lender of last resort deepened 
the Great Depression and provides further historical evidence for the importance 
of international institutions. The lack of a lender of last resort was particularly 
critical because a number of countries with temporary financial problems soon 
passed into full-blown financial collapse. As it became impossible for countries to

pay their foreign debts, the crisis spread from the indebted nations to the lending 
nations. In 2009, during the recent crisis, the world’s largest economies approved 
an increase in funding for the IMF so that it would be able to continue its role as 
a lender of last resort.
International economic crises, such as the Mexican peso crisis of 1994–1995, 
the Asian Crisis of 1997–1998, and the more recent and very severe subprime 
mortgage crisis of 2007–2009, are relatively frequent occurrences. In each crisis 
or potential crisis, international institutions play an important role by preventing 
free riding. Lacking much in the way of formal enforcement mechanisms, they 
overcome the free rider problem by changing each nation’s expectations about 
every other nation. For example, if all countries are committed to open markets 
in good times and bad, then during a worldwide recession no country expects its 
trading partners to close their markets. Or, if each country pays a share of the 
IMF’s operating funds, then it overcomes the problems that arise when every 
country waits for the others to make risky loans during a crisis. The effectiveness 
of international institutions depends on the credible commitment of the world’s 
nations. If a country agrees to a set of rules, but has a reputation for breaking its 
agreements, then its commitment is not credible. Institutions cannot overcome the 
free rider problem under those circumstances.

Bretton Woods
After World War I, the United States retreated into a relative isolationism 
under the mistaken belief that noninvolvement in European affairs would pro-
tect the country from entanglement in disastrous European conflicts such as 
World War I. The rise of Hitler, Japanese aggression in the Pacific, and the start 
of World War II showed that this policy would not work.
The United States began to realize its mistake in the 1930s as it watched 
Hitler take over a large part of the European continent. U.S. and British 
cooperation and planning for the postwar era began before the United States 
entered the war in December 1941, and long before the outcome was known. 
President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill met on a battleship off 
the coast of Newfoundland in August 1941. Soon after, they announced the 
Atlantic Charter, a program for postwar reconstruction that committed both 
nations to working for the fullest possible economic collaboration among all 
nations after the war. Concurrent with the Atlantic Charter, the United States 
and Britain began discussing the kinds of international institutions that might 
be proposed.
All parties agreed that in any postwar order the United States would have to 
be the political, military, and economic leader. The United States had surpassed

Part 1    Introduction and Institutions
Great Britain in wealth and size several decades earlier, and its leadership 
during the war gave it prestige and credibility. In addition, the physical infra-
structure of the United States was not damaged by the war, and it was the only 
industrial nation able to provide the financial capital and physical material 
needed to repair the war damage.
Looking back to the 1920s and 1930s, the postwar planners recognized 
four serious problems that they should guard against (1) the worldwide 
depression; (2) the collapse of international trade; (3) the collapse of the 
international monetary system; and (4) the collapse of international lending. 
Discussions during World War II were mainly devoted to rules, agreements, 
and organizations that could be created to avoid these problems. The follow-
ing international institutions were viewed as central for the achievement of 
these goals:
■
■An international organization to help stabilize exchange rates and to 
assist nations that are unable to pay their international debts
■
■Agreements to reduce trade barriers
■
■An international organization for providing relief to the war-damaged 
nations, and to assist with reconstruction
Plans for the postwar period were finalized at a conference held in July 
1944, in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. The Bretton Woods institutions 
include the IMF, the World Bank, and the Bretton Woods exchange rate 
system. Although it was conceived separately, the GATT is sometimes 
included because it embodies the goals and ideas of the Bretton Woods 
planners with respect to international trade. Together, these institutions are 
a historically unique set of international economic institutions, and each, 
in its own area, has played a key role in the history of the international 
economy since 1945.
The founding principles of the Bretton Woods institutions are relatively 
simple. First, trade should open in all countries, not just in the United States 
alone, or in the United States and the United Kingdom together. In economic 
terms, this was a call for multilateral opening as opposed to unilateralism (one-
sided opening) or bilateralism (two-sided opening). Second, nations should 
not discriminate against other nations. Whatever tariffs and quotas the United 
Kingdom or the United States might levy against another country, they should 
be the same ones imposed on everyone. Third, in order to ensure the ability of 
importers to purchase goods abroad, countries should not limit the buying and 
selling of currency when its purpose is to pay for imports. Fourth, exchange 
rates should be fixed but with the possibility for periodic adjustment. These 
principles formed the cornerstones of the institutions.

CRITICISM OF INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
LO 2.5	 Debate the pros and cons of international economic organizations.
The World Bank, IMF, WTO, and various regional trade agreements have pro-
vided financial resources for development, technical assistance for crisis man-
agement, and mechanisms for opening markets. Not everyone agrees that these 
efforts are positive on balance, however, and even those who view their actions 
favorably would agree that there is room for improvement. The range of criti-
cism covers a wide spectrum, from public demonstrations against trade ministers 
meeting under the auspices of the WTO to well-informed criticisms by leading 
economists such as Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz. The underlying question is 
whether the IMF, World Bank, and WTO are fostering development and eco-
nomic security, or generating greater economic inequality and compounding the 
risks to vulnerable groups.
In general, most analysts probably agree that some types of international insti-
tutions are necessary due to the international public goods discussed earlier. The 
IMF, World Bank, and WTO were created in response to real historical events 
and for the explicit purposes of avoiding crises and promoting growth. Economic 
changes such as transportation and communication revolutions; the integration 
of new markets in Africa, Europe, Asia, and Latin America; and technological 
innovations have increased the need for institutions by reducing the isolation of 
nations and creating more interactions and spillovers among them. While there is 
a widely recognized need for a set of agreements covering the international eco-
nomic policies practiced by individual nations, there is less consensus regarding 
the content of the agreements and how they should be implemented.
Sovereignty and Transparency
Sovereignty refers to the rights of nations to be free from unwanted foreign 
interference in their affairs. One of the strongest complaints about international 
institutions is that they violate national sovereignty by imposing unwanted eco-
nomic policies. For example, when a country experiences a financial crisis, the 
IMF is often the only potential source of outside help. Once engaged, however, 
the IMF imposes conditions that sometimes amount to a complete rearrangement 
of national economic policies. Specific examples include IMF requirements that 
countries cut government spending, privatize their publicly owned enterprises, 
and open their financial sector to the free movement of capital. Each of these may 
go against public preferences. For example, when a country is in the midst of a 
financial crisis, cuts in government spending can increase the depth of a recession 
and often have a disproportionately large impact on the middle class and the poor. 
Aside from the potential benefits or costs, it often appears that governments are 
coerced by the international financial community. In response to this perception, 

58
Part 1    Introduction and Institutions
some argue that if countries avoid financial crises, they do not need to ask for help. 
Furthermore, it would be harmful to everyone if the IMF lent money uncondi-
tionally. Still, the issue of how hard international institutions should be allowed 
to push countries to change their policies is an open debate.
Closely related to the issue of sovereignty is the issue of transparency. Trans-
parency concerns are based on questions about the decision-making that occurs 
within international institutions. As noted earlier, the IMF and the World Bank 
have voting structures based on the size of the quotas or dues paid by each coun-
try. This gives the United States in particular, and developed country interests in 
general, control over these bodies and makes it difficult for them to differentiate 
U.S. or EU interests from the interests of client countries. For example, a client 
country may be told to open its financial markets because it will increase foreign 
capital inflows and investment, but the main beneficiaries are banks and financial 
firms in the United States or the EU. Some critics conclude that IMF and World 
Bank policies are explicitly designed to benefit special interests in developed 
countries and do not serve the interests of the world economy.
The governing structure of the WTO is not based on quotas or dues, but devel-
oping countries are at a disadvantage because they lack the armies of lawyers, 
trade association lobbyists, and industry specialists that the United States and the 
EU can muster during a round of negotiations. A specific example is the Uruguay 
Round deal on agriculture and intellectual property rights. Developed countries 
pushed a comprehensive and strict set of enforcement policies for protecting intel-
lectual property rights (copyrights, trademarks, patents, brand names, and so on). 
In return, developing countries thought that they would face fewer barriers to 
selling agricultural products in industrial country markets. In fact, their access 
to developed country agricultural markets was much less than anticipated, and 
the costs of enforcing intellectual property rights turned out to be higher than 
expected.
Ideology
Issues of sovereignty and transparency are compounded by questions about 
the value of the technical economic advice given by the IMF and other institu-
tions. Some of the sharpest criticisms come from economists who strongly favor 
international economic integration but argue that the advice and technical assis-
tance provided to developing countries reflect the biases and wishes of devel-
oped countries’ interests. These economists think the IMF and World Bank have 
been too insistent in their demands that countries open their financial markets 
to capital flows (something the IMF itself reconsidered after the financial crisis 
of ­2007–2009), that they privatize government-owned firms, and that they cut 
government programs in times of crisis. These critics share a deep skepticism 
about grand schemes to “fix a country” with a universal set of policies that are 
applicable everywhere and at all times, although the IMF and World Bank would 
argue that their advice and conditions for assistance are more nuanced than the 
critics acknowledge.

Chapter 2    International Economic Institutions Since World War II 
59
The Chinese government has voiced similar criticism repeatedly, and has 
recently gone so far as to create an alternative to the World Bank and the IMF, 
called the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The AIIB began opera-
tion in 2016, amid promises that it would respond to developing countries more 
quickly, with fewer conditions, and with fewer layers of oversight and review than 
the World Bank or the IMF. It is too soon to know whether the AIIB will succeed 
or not, but it is certain that it represents a new development in China’s growing 
importance to the world economy.
Implementation and Adjustment Costs
Trade agreements and the WTO are a major focus of complaints by the critics of 
economic integration. In particular, when agreements combine developing and 
developed countries, asymmetries in negotiating skills and the ability to absorb 
the costs of implementation and adjustment are singled out for criticism. An often 
cited example is the previously mentioned case of the Uruguay Round agreement 
on intellectual property rights. In order to implement this part of the agreement, 
developing countries have to create or improve their patent systems and copy-
right and trademark enforcement mechanisms. The latter step would entail cutting 
down on pirated drugs, videos, CDs, software, and so on. The opportunity cost of 
implementing this part of the agreement is substantial, particularly for a develop-
ing country with very limited resources.
Once in place, trade agreements always impose costs in the form of adjust-
ments to the new opportunities and challenges. Some markets will expand while 
others will contract. In general, the costs of adjusting to the new incentives are less 
significant than the benefits, but for some developing countries the adjustment 
costs may be quite large. Developing countries tend to have higher unemployment 
(often disguised or hidden in the informal sector), so that workers laid off in a 
contracting industry may spend more time looking for work. Their economies are 
also less diversified, and sudden shocks such as a surge of imports can have large 
effects. These problems are made more severe by the lack of social safety nets 
to protect unemployed workers and their families. In order to take advantage of 
the opportunities presented by greater access to foreign markets, countries may 
need to construct new infrastructures, for example, roads and ports for moving 
fresh produce. The ability of developing countries to build infrastructures is more 
limited than for developed countries, as is the access to credit.
Issues of sovereignty and transparency, ideological biases, and the costs of 
implementation and adjustment are only a partial catalog of the concerns raised 
by the critics of international institutions. In general, however, there is widespread 
agreement among professional economists that there are theoretical and practical 
reasons for their existence. Nevertheless, beyond a basic consensus about need, 
many issues remain subject to debate, particularly issues of governance and the 
amount of authority that should be vested in international organizations. In spite 
of these uncertainties, it is safe to say that if these international institutions did 
not exist, we would create them.

China’s Alternative to the IMF and World 
Bank: The AIIB
The first meeting of the directors of the newly created AIIB took place in 
Beijing, China, during January 2016 (see www.aiib.org). This was the culmina-
tion of several years of planning and negotiations by the Chinese government 
and was one more sign that China is reclaiming a leading role in international 
economic and political affairs.
The Chinese government has tried to change the voting structure and lead-
ership of the IMF and the World Bank but met with little success. Both insti-
tutions were created during the years of China’s revolution, and operated for 
decades during the period of China’s greatest isolation. As China began major 
economic reforms in 1978, it began to look for ways to have a stronger voice in 
international institutions that help set the rules of trade and investment. Along 
the way, China became a leading voice for low-income and middle-income 
countries that were asking for a larger role in decision-making in international 
bodies.
The IMF is dominated by Western Europe, Japan, and the United States. 
As explained in the text, countries vote on issues in proportion to the size of 
the quota they pay into the IMF, and the quota is determined by the size of 
their GDP, their openness to trade, the variability of their economic growth, 
and other factors. China has 3.8 percent of the weighted votes, while the U.S. 
has just under 17 percent and the G7 almost 45 percent. China’s push to have a 
greater say in rule-making and policy implementation reflects its belief that it 
deserves a larger role, given its size and its importance to the world economy.
When China first proposed an alternative to the IMF, the United States 
opposed the idea, and was successful for some years in forestalling its cre-
ation. Ultimately, however, China proposed the Asian Infrastructure Invest-
ment Bank in 2013 and began to recruit member countries. The United States 
opposed this initiative and for awhile was successful in persuading its closest 
allies to refrain from joining. By January 2016, at the inaugural meeting of its 
Board of Directors, China had recruited 56 other nations as founding members, 
including important allies of the United States such as Australia, France, Ger-
many, and the United Kingdom.
China proposes to operate a “lean, clean, and green” organization, with 
few layers of bureaucracy (“lean”), no tolerance for corruption (“clean”), and 
sensitivity to environmental sustainability (“green”). Its focus is the financing 
of infrastructure in Asia, including power supplies, transportation and telecom-
munication systems, water supplies and sanitation, and agricultural develop-
ment, among others. It has capital equivalent to $US 100 billion.

Will the AIIB undermine the effectiveness of the IMF by enabling countries 
to avoid its surveillance and oversight? Will it replace the World Bank in Asia? 
And how will its sponsorship by China shape future relations between that 
country, Asia, and the United States? It may take some years to begin to see 
an answer to these questions.
Summary
■
■Institutions are the “rules of the game.” They can be formal, as in a nation’s 
constitution, or informal, as in a custom or tradition. In both cases, we 
depend on institutions as mechanisms for creating order and reducing 
uncertainty. Global institutions have played an important role in fostering 
the growth of international trade and investment during the last fifty years. 
They have defined a set of rules that have helped avoid trade wars and the 
problems of the 1930s.
■
■The “Big 3” of international economic organizations are the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the World Trade Organiza-
tion (WTO). The latter grew out of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT). The IMF, World Bank, and the GATT were created at the 
end of World War II with the purpose of avoiding a return to the destructive 
economic conditions of the interwar years.
■
■Regional trade agreements are another important type of international insti-
tution, although they are not global in scope. Formally, there are five types 
of regional trade agreements. In order, from less integrated to more inte-
grated, they are partial trade agreements, free-trade areas, customs unions, 
common markets, and economic unions. Each level is cumulative and incor-
porates the features of the previous level. In reality, however, actual trade 
agreements usually combine features from two or more types.
■
■Many economists favor regional trade agreements as building blocks for 
more open world trade, but some pro-free-trade economists are opposed 
on the grounds that they are harmful to multilateral WTO agreements and 
are discriminatory. In general, the WTO allows regional trade agreements 
(RTAs) as long as they create more trade than they divert.
■
■International economic institutions are an attempt to overcome the problem 
of free riding by individual nations in the sphere of providing international 
public goods. The most important public goods are order and a reduction 
in uncertainty. Some economists believe that these goods are best provided 
when there are agreements that help keep markets open in recessions and 
in boom periods, when there is an international lender of last resort, when 

62
Part 1    Introduction and Institutions
there are sufficient lenders of capital to developing nations, and when there 
is an adequate supply of money for international payment.
■
■Most analysts agree that some forms of international institutions are nec-
essary as a precaution against crises and to promote growth, but there is 
significant disagreement over the design of governance structures and the 
scope of their responsibilities.
■
■Primary areas of criticism are in sovereignty, transparency, ideological bias, 
and implementation and adjustment costs.

INTRODUCTION: THE GAINS FROM TRADE
LO 3.1	 Analyze numerical examples of absolute and comparative advantage.
This chapter introduces the theory of comparative advantage. A simple model is used 
to show how nations maximize their material welfare by specializing in goods and ser-
vices that have the lowest relative costs of production. The improvement in national 
welfare is known as the gains from trade. The concepts of comparative advantage and 
the gains from trade are two of the oldest and most widely held ideas in all of econom-
ics, yet they are often misunderstood and misinterpreted. Therefore, it is worth the 
effort to develop a clear understanding of both.
Adam Smith and the Attack on Economic Nationalism
The development of modern economic theory is intimately linked to the birth of inter-
national economics. In 1776, Adam Smith published An Inquiry into the Nature and 
Causes of the Wealth of Nations, a work that became the first modern statement of 
economic theory. In the process of laying out the basic ground rules for the efficient 
allocation of resources, Smith initiated a general attack on mercantilism, the system of 
nationalistic economics that dominated economic thought in the 1700s. Mercantilism 
stressed exports over imports, primarily as a way to obtain revenues for building armies 
and national construction projects.

Chapter 3    Comparative Advantage and the Gains from Trade 
67
The key mistake in mercantilist thinking was the belief that trade was a zero 
sum activity. In the eighteenth century the term zero sum did not exist, but it is a 
convenient expression for the concept that one nation’s gain is another nation’s 
loss. A moment’s reflection should be enough to see the mistake in this belief, 
at least as it applies to voluntary exchange. When a grocery store sells a gallon 
of milk or a loaf of bread, both the store and the consumer are better off. If 
that were not the case, the store would not sell or the consumer would not buy. 
Voluntary exchanges such as this are positive sum, not zero sum. In this sense, 
sports metaphors that have a winner and loser are usually not an apt description 
of trade relations. Trade is more dance than football, more rock climbing than 
bicycle racing.
No one in the 1770s thought that they were living in the midst of an industrial 
revolution, but Smith was observant enough to perceive that many improvements 
in the standard of living had occurred during his lifetime as a result of increasing 
specialization in production. When he analyzed specialization, he made one of 
his most important contributions to economics: the discovery that specialization 
depends on the size of the market.
A contemporary example may be helpful. If a car company were permitted 
to sell its cars and trucks only in Michigan, it would have much less revenue and 
would sell many fewer vehicles. It would hire fewer employees, and each person 
would be less specialized. As it is, the market is so large (essentially, the world) 
that car companies can hire engineers who completely specialize in small, even 
minuscule, parts of a car—door locks, for example. Your door lock engineer will 
know everything there is to know about the design, production, and assembly of 
door locks and will be able to put them into cars most efficiently. A firm that was 
limited to the Michigan market could never afford to hire such specialized skills 
and could never be as efficient.
One of the keys to Smith’s story of wealth creation is access to foreign mar-
kets. If no one is willing to import, then every company is limited by the size of 
the national market. In some cases, that may be large enough (the United States 
or China), but in most cases, it is not. Small- and medium-sized countries cannot 
efficiently produce every item they consume. Holland, for example, has always 
imported a large share of its goods and has depended on access to foreign markets 
in order to earn export revenues to pay for imports.
Smith was highly critical of trade barriers because they decrease special-
ization, technological progress, and wealth creation. He also recognized that 
imports enable a country to obtain goods that it cannot make or cannot make 
as cheaply, while exports are made for someone else and are useful only if they 
lead to imports. The modern view of trade shares Smith’s dislike of trade barri-
ers for mostly the same reasons. Although international economists recognize 
that there are limitations to the application of theory, in most cases a majority 
of economists share a preference for open markets. In Chapters 6 and 7 we 
will examine trade barriers in greater detail, but at this point we will develop 
a deeper understanding of the gains from trade by means of a simple algebraic 
and graphical model.

68
Part 2    International Trade
A Simple Model of Production and Trade
We will begin with one of the simplest models in economics. The conclusion of 
this analysis is that a policy of free trade maximizes a nation’s material well-being. 
Later, we will examine some of the cases where real-world conditions do not 
conform to the assumptions of the model and where the optimality of free trade 
is questionable.
The basic model is often referred to as a Ricardian model, since it first took 
form in the analysis of David Ricardo. The model begins by assuming that there 
are only two countries, producing two goods, using one input (labor). The Ricard-
ian model assumes that firms are price takers, or, in other words, markets are 
competitive, and no firm has market power. The model is static in the sense that 
it assumes that technology is constant and there are no learning effects of produc-
tion that might make firms and industries more productive over time. Ricardo also 
assumed that labor is perfectly mobile between industries but perfectly immobile 
across national borders. Table 3.1 lists the main assumptions of the model; many 
of these will be relaxed in later chapters.
Absolute Productivity Advantage  
and the Gains from Trade
To begin, we define productivity in the Ricardian model. Productivity is the 
amount of output obtained from a unit of input. Since labor is the only input, we 
can define labor productivity as follows:
(units of output)/(hours worked)
If, for example, 2 loaves of bread can be produced in one hour, then productivity 
is as follows:
(2 loaves)/(1 hour)
or 2 loaves per hour. If four loaves are produced in two hours, then productivity 
is still as follows:
(4 loaves)/(2 hours) = 2 loaves per hour

Suppose that there are two goods, bread and steel, and two countries, the 
United States and Canada. Suppose also that each produces according to the 
productivities shown in Table 3.2.
The values in Table 3.2 show that productivity in the making of bread is greater 
in Canada than in the United States, and that productivity in steel is greater in the 
United States. Canada has an absolute productivity advantage in bread because 
it produces more loaves per hour worked (three versus two in the United States). 
Using the same logic, the United States has an absolute productivity advantage 
in steel production.
The basis of Adam Smith’s support for free trade was the belief that every 
country would have an absolute advantage in something, and that the source of the 
advantage did not matter. Whether it was due to special skills in the labor force, 
climate and soil characteristics of the country, or the temperament of its people, 
there would be goods that each country could manufacture, grow, or dig out of 
the ground more efficiently than its trading partner. Consequently, every country 
could benefit from trade.
In the numerical example outlined in Table 3.2, each loaf of bread costs the 
United States 1.5 tons of steel. Put another way, the opportunity cost of bread 
is 1.5 tons of steel, since each unit of bread produced requires the economy to 
move labor out of steel production, forfeiting 1.5 tons of steel that it could have 
produced instead. This follows from the fact that each hour of labor can produce 
either 2 loaves of bread or 3 tons of steel. We can write this ratio as the barter 
price of bread as follows:
Pus
b =
3 tons
2 loaves = 1.5a tons
loaves b,
where b is bread and us is the country. Similarly, we can write the U.S. price of 
steel as the inverse as follows:
Pus
s
= 2 loaves
3 tons
= 0.67a loaves
tons b.
You should be able to verify that the Canadian price of bread will be 0.33 (tons/
loaf) and that steel will cost 3 (loaves/ton).

Part 2    International Trade
If the United States can sell a ton of steel for more than 0.67 loaves of bread, 
it is better off. Similarly, if Canadians can obtain a ton of steel for fewer than 3 
loaves of bread, they are better off. Each country will gain from trade if there is 
agreement to sell steel for fewer than 3 loaves of bread but more than 0.67 loaves. 
Anywhere in that range, both Canadians and Americans will benefit. In the end, 
trade will occur at a price somewhere between these two limits as follows:
3.0a loaves
tons b 7 Pw
s 7 0.67a loaves
tons b,
where Pw
s = the world price of steel (the trade price). Without knowing more 
details about the demand side of the market, it is impossible to say whether the 
price will settle closer to 3.0 (the Canadian opportunity cost of steel) or 0.67 (the 
U.S. opportunity cost). The closer the price is to 0.67, the more Canada benefits 
from trade, and the closer it is to 3.0, the more the United States benefits. Regard-
less of which country benefits more, as long as the price is between these two 
limits, both countries benefit from trade.

Gains from Trade in Nineteenth-Century 
Japan
A fundamental result from international economics is that nations gain from trade. 
We have just shown this in a simple theoretical framework by illustrating how 
trade enables countries to consume a bundle of goods that is of greater value than 
what they can produce on their own. The key to this result is that the two trading 
partners have different productivities, which lead to different prices in autarky.
One question economists have struggled to answer is, “How large are the 
gains from trade?” Does trade create a relatively small gain, or a relatively large 
one? The answer is complicated for a couple of reasons. First, there are gains 
from trade opening that occur immediately and are called static gains from 
trade. But there are also gains that occur over time, called dynamic gains from 
trade, that are difficult to predict since they depend on changes in innovation 
and productivity. A second reason why it is hard to measure gains from trade 
is that all countries already trade, so most of what is measured are the potential 
gains from some additional amount of trade and not the benefits or gains that a 
country currently has from participating in trade. In our simple model, we went 
from no trade to some trade, but in the real world, when countries reduce their 
trade barriers, they go from some trade to some more trade.
Two economists (Bernhofen and Brown, American Economic Review, 95(1), 
2005) tackled this problem in an original way by looking at the case of Japan. 
Japan’s rulers closed their market to outsiders in 1639 when it felt threatened by

Christian missionaries and their Portuguese supporters. From that time on, only 
the Dutch and the Chinese were permitted to trade with Japan, and each was lim-
ited to just a handful of ships per year. In the Dutch case, by the mid-1800s, only 
one ship per year was allowed to trade, while the Chinese were limited to three or 
four junks per year. Bernhofen and Brown estimated that Japan exported goods 
worth about 1.2 cents per person and imported even less, around 0.4 cents per 
person, by the mid-1800s. Essentially, trade was nil and Japan lived in autarky.
As most Americans know from their history books, the United States 
decided to force open the Japanese market in the early 1850s and sent Admiral 
Matthew Perry to accomplish the task. Perry made first contact with Japanese 
officials in 1853 and signed a limited agreement in 1854. The United States 
continued to request further opening until a full commercial treaty was signed 
in 1858 and took effect on July 4, 1859. Following close on the heels of the 
Americans were the Dutch, Russians, British, and French, and by the mid-
1860s, Japan was living under a regime of nearly free trade since its ability to 
limit imports with tariffs was curtailed by the foreign powers.
The Japanese case is an excellent one for measuring the static gains from 
trade. Japan had closed markets before it was forced to open, and after opening 
it was forced to practice more or less free trade. Our simple theoretical model 
of trade predicts that Japan should have shifted its domestic production to 
take advantage of the higher prices offered for its exports, and that its national 
income should have grown in value since its export goods are worth more and 
its import goods cost less. Both effects seem to have occurred.
After trade began, Japanese production of silk and tea increased dramati-
cally and these products became major export items. Imported goods included 
woolen textiles (Japan had no sheep industry) and a variety of manufactured 
goods, such as weapons, that it did not make itself. National income seems to 
have grown as well. Bernhofen and Brown estimated that an upper bound on 
the increase was 8–9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). This is not a 
huge amount, but it is not inconsequential either, and represents only the static 
gains from trade. Over time, as Japanese producers adjusted to a larger market 
and as new technologies and products were introduced, additional gains would 
accrue from increased productivity and innovation.
COMPARATIVE PRODUCTIVITY ADVANTAGE AND THE 
GAINS FROM TRADE
LO 3.2	 Draw a diagram showing gains from trade.
At this point, the obvious question to ask is what happens if a country does not 
have an absolute productivity advantage in anything. It is not hard to imagine an 
extremely poor, resource-deficient nation with low literacy and scarce capital. 

72
Part 2    International Trade
What can these countries produce more efficiently than the United States or Ger-
many? Why would a rich country want to trade with them when they are inef-
ficient at everything? The answer is that even if a country lacks a single good in 
which it has an absolute productivity advantage, it can still benefit from trade. 
Perhaps even more surprising, high-income countries also benefit from the trade. 
In other words, the idea that nations benefit from trade has nothing to do with 
whether a country has an absolute advantage in producing a particular good. In 
order to see this, first we must develop a few more basic concepts.
The Production Possibilities Curve
The production possibilities curve (PPC) shows the trade-offs a country faces 
when it chooses its combination of bread and steel output. Figure 3.1 illustrates a 
hypothetical PPC for the United States. Point B on the PPC is an efficient point of 
production because it utilizes existing resources to obtain the maximum possible 
level of output. The assumption of full employment is equivalent to assuming that 
the United States is operating at a point like B that lies on its PPC. At point A, 
the economy is inside its production curve and is operating at an inefficient and 
wasteful level of output because it is not obtaining the maximum possible output 
from its available inputs. Point C is infeasible because resources do not permit the 
production of bread and steel in the combination indicated.
The PPC shown in Figure 3.1 is a straight line because it is assumed that the 
trade-off between bread and steel does not change. This follows from the assump-
tion that labor is homogeneous and that no group of workers is more skilled than 
another group. The trade-off between bread and steel is another way to refer to 
the opportunity cost of steel. This follows from the definition of opportunity cost 
as the best forgone alternative: In order to produce a ton of steel, the United 
FIGURE 3.1  A PPC for the United States

73
States gives up two-thirds of a loaf of bread. In Figure 3.2, the slope of the PPC is 
-0.67, the number of loaves of bread forgone (∆bread) divided by the quantity 
of steel obtained (∆steel)—written as follows:
 Slope of the PPC = (∆bread output)/(∆steel output)
 = opportunity cost of steel
Relative Prices
Suppose that the slope of the PPC is -0.67, as shown in Figure 3.2. If the United 
States does not trade, it gives up 0.67 loaves of bread for an additional ton of steel. 
This trade-off is called the relative price of steel or the opportunity cost of steel. 
The term relative price follows from the fact that it is not in monetary units, but 
rather in units of the other good. If no trade takes place, then the relative price of 
a good must be equal to its opportunity cost in production.
It is easy to convert the relative price of steel into the relative price of 
bread: Simply take the inverse of the price of steel. In other words, if 0.67 loaves 
of bread is the price of 1 ton of steel in the United States, then 1.5 tons of steel is 
the price of 1 loaf of bread. By the same reasoning, 1.5 tons of steel is the oppor-
tunity cost of 1 loaf of bread in the United States when production is at point B 
or at any other point along the PPC in Figure 3.2.
The Consumption Possibilities Curve
The complete absence of trade is called autarky, and in this situation both the 
United States and Canada are limited in their consumption to the goods that they 
produce at home. Suppose that autarky prevails initially and the opportunity cost

The slope of the PPC is the opportunity cost of the good on the horizontal axis. 
This follows from the definition of the slope as the ratio of the vertical change to 
the horizontal change moving along the PPC.

Part 2    International Trade
of steel in Canada is 3 loaves of bread per ton, and in the United States, it is 0.67 
loaves per ton (as given in Table 3.1). In this case, both countries can raise their 
consumption levels if they trade. In particular there will be gains from trade if 
the price settles somewhere between the opportunity costs in Canada and in the 
United States. That is, the countries benefit if the following is true:
3.0 (loaves/ton) 7 Pw
s 7 0.67 (loaves/ton)
Suppose that the price settles at 2 loaves per ton. In the United States, the pre-
trade price was 0.67 loaves per ton. This is illustrated in Figure 3.3, where the 
PPC for the United States is shown with the production point at A. The trading 
possibilities for the United States are illustrated by the consumption possibilities 
curve (CPC). The slope of the CPC is -2, which is the relative price of steel, or 
the rate at which bread and steel can be traded for each other. The CPC passes 
through point A because this is the combination of steel and bread that is avail-
able to trade if the United States produces at A. If the United States chooses to 
trade, it could move up the CPC, trading each ton of steel for 2 loaves of bread. 
This is a better trade-off than it gets if it tries to make more bread, since along 
its PPC each ton brings only two-thirds more loaves of bread. While it is always 
impossible to produce outside the PPC, in effect, the United States can consume 
outside it by trading steel for bread.
The Gains from Trade
You should wonder why the United States would choose to make bread at all, 
since a ton of steel not produced brings in only two-thirds of a loaf of bread. If the 
United States were to specialize in steel production and trade for bread, it could 
do much better, since it would get 2 loaves for each ton. This possibility is shown 
in Figure 3.4. Here, the pre-trade production point for the United States is at A. 
This is also its consumption point, since in the absence of trade, consumption must

75
equal production. Point B in Figure 3.4 represents production that is completely 
specialized in steel. With the opening of trade, production could occur at B, and 
the United States could trade up along CPC′, which has a slope of -2, the same 
as the CPC. If the United States produces at B and moves up CPC′, it can reach 
a point like C, which is unambiguously superior to the consumption bundle avail-
able when production is at point A because it represents more of both bread and 
steel. Similarly, for any combination of bread and steel that is available along the 
PPC or CPC if the United States produces at A and trades, there is a consumption 
bundle on CPC′, which represents more of both goods.
The most important thing to note about production point B is that it maximizes 
U.S. income. This follows from the fact that it makes available the greatest combi-
nations of bread and steel. To see this, consider that no other point of production 
puts the United States on a price line that lies farther out from the origin. Every 
other production point on the United States’ PPC lies below the CPC′, and every 
CPC with a slope of -2 that passes through the PPC at a point other than B also 
lies below CPC′. In other words, given the United States’ PPC and a relative steel 
price of 2, the largest bundle of consumption goods is obtained when the United 
States specializes in steel and trades for its bread.
The United States benefits from trade, but does Canada? Unequivocally, the 
answer is yes. Consider Figure 3.5 where point A is Canada’s pre-trade production 
point. Along Canada’s PPC, the opportunity cost of steel is 3 loaves of bread per 
ton. After trade, the price settles at 2 loaves per ton. With a trade price of 2, Canada 
maximizes its income by moving along its PPC to where it is completely specialized 
in bread production. Then it can trade bread for steel at a trade price that is more 
favorable than its domestic trade-off of 3 loaves per ton. Canada, too, can consume 
at a point on CPC that is outside its PPC and above and to the right of its pre-trade 
equilibrium at point A. Canada, like the United States, is better off because with 
trade it gets a larger combination of both goods than it can produce for itself.

By specializing production at B and trading for bread, the United States obtains

76
Part 2    International Trade
A numerical example will help clarify the existence of gains from trade. Suppose 
the relative price of steel is 2 loaves per ton. When the United States increases its 
steel output by 1 ton, it gives up 0.67 loaves of bread output, but it can trade the 
steel for 2 loaves, leaving a net gain of 1.33 loaves (2 - 0.67 = 1.33). In order to 
meet U.S. demand for 2 more loaves of bread, Canada must give up 0.67 ton of 
steel production. It trades the 2 loaves for 1 ton of steel, however, leaving a net 
gain of 0.33 ton (1 - 0.67 = 0.33). Hence, both countries benefit from the trade.
Domestic Prices and the Trade Price
Now we know that as long as the trade price is between the pre-trade domes-
tic prices in Canada and the United States, both countries can gain from 
trade. What ensures that the trade price actually settles within this range, 
3.0 (loaves/ton) 7 Pw
s 7 0.67 (loaves/ton)? What would happen if, for example, 
Pw
s  were equal to 4, or 0.5?
Consider the first case when the trade price is 4 loaves per ton of steel. At 
Pw
s = 4, the trade price of steel is greater than the production cost in each country. 
Clearly, the United States would want to continue to specialize in steel and trade it 
for bread. Nothing has changed with regard to the U.S. strategy for maximizing its 
consumption bundle, or income. The only difference now is that the United States 
gets 4 units of bread for each unit of steel, instead of 2 as before. In Canada’s case, 
the higher price of steel makes it profitable for Canadian producers to switch to 
steel production. This follows because the production opportunity cost of steel is 
3 loaves of bread, but each ton produced can trade for 4 loaves. By specializing in 
steel production and trading for bread, Canada maximizes its consumption bundle.
Finally, it should be obvious that both countries are specialized in steel produc-
tion and that no one is producing bread. There is a bread shortage and a glut of 
steel. Consequently, bread prices rise, and steel prices fall. This goes on at least 
FIGURE 3.5  Canada’s Gains from Trade

77
until the trade price of steel falls below the opportunity cost of production in Can-
ada, the higher cost country. Once Pw
s  is less than 3, Canadian producers switch 
back to bread, steel production goes down, bread is up, and trade can resume.
In the second case, where Pw
s  is less than 0.67, Canada continues to specialize in 
bread, and the United States switches. Bread is the surplus good, steel is in short 
supply, and a similar dynamic causes the price to move in order to ensure that 
both goods are produced. The equilibrium trade price, then, has to be within the 
range we specified earlier, between the opportunity costs in the two countries. In 
our case, this is between 0.67 and 3.0 loaves per ton.
At the extreme, the trade price could be equal to the opportunity cost in one 
country; for example, if the trade price of steel is 0.67 loaves per ton, then the 
United States is indifferent about trading. It cannot be hurt by trading, but it 
does not gain either, since all the gains go to Canada. Similarly, if the trade price 
is equal to Canada’s opportunity cost, then Canada is indifferent and all the gains 
accrue to the United States.
Without more information we cannot say much more about the trade price. 
Will it be close to 0.67 or to 3.0? The answer depends on the strength of demand 
for each good in both countries, but we have not explicitly included demand in our 
model, so we cannot say. We do know that if the price is closer to 0.67, then the 
gains from trade are larger for Canada, and if it is closer to 3.0, the United States 
benefits more. Nevertheless, both countries gain as long as the price is between 
the two opportunity costs, and economic forces determine that the price must be 
in that range.
ABSOLUTE AND COMPARATIVE PRODUCTIVITY 
­ADVANTAGE CONTRASTED
LO 3.3	 Numerically compare and contrast absolute and comparative 
advantage.
Absolute productivity advantage is defined as having higher labor productivity. 
We saw that if each country has an absolute productivity advantage in one of the 
goods, they can both benefit by specializing in that good and trading it for the 
other good. Note, however, that the gains from trade did not depend in any way 
on each country having an absolute advantage. In fact, it was the pre-trade oppor-
tunity costs of bread and steel in each country that mattered. Opportunity costs 
were derived from the productivities, but since they are a ratio, vastly different 
levels of productivity can lead to the same trade-off.
A country has a comparative productivity advantage in a good, or simply a 
comparative advantage, if its opportunity costs of producing a good are lower 
than those of its trading partners. The concept of comparative advantage is based 
on the idea that nations maximize their material well-being when they use their 
resources where they have their highest value. In order to know the highest-valued 
usage for any resource, we must compare alternative uses. If, by comparison to 

78
Part 2    International Trade
that of the United States, Canada’s opportunity cost of bread is lower, then it 
should produce more bread and trade for steel.
The distinction between absolute and comparative productivity advantages is one 
of the most important in economics. It is also one of the least understood, in spite of 
the fact that it is relatively simple. For example, it is common to read or hear com-
ments about competitiveness that assume that if a country does not have an absolute 
advantage, it will not be able to sell its products abroad. Our model explains why 
this logic is erroneous and why even the least productive nations export some goods.
GAINS FROM TRADE WITH NO ABSOLUTE ADVANTAGE
LO 3.4	 Explain how a country with no absolute advantage can still gain 
from trade.
Consider the case shown in Table 3.3. Japan has an absolute advantage in both 
cars (2 7 0.5) and steel (2 7 1), yet it can still gain from trade, as can Malaysia, 
even though it lacks an absolute advantage in either good. If Japan does not trade, 
it is limited to its own production possibilities, which require it to give up 1 ton of 
steel for each car it produces. In Malaysia, each car costs 2 tons of steel. Hence, 
there is scope for a mutually beneficial exchange.
Japan’s opportunity cost of steel production is greater than Malaysia’s even 
though it has a higher absolute rate of productivity in steel. Therefore, if it follows 
its comparative advantage and maximizes its income, it will specialize in cars, the 
sector where its opportunity cost is lower than Malaysia’s. Once trade opens, the 
world price of cars will be between 1 and 2 tons of steel per car, the opportunity 
costs of production in Japan and Malaysia, as follows:
1a tons
car b 6 Pw
c 6 2a tons
car b
Let the price be 1.5 tons of steel per car. If Japan moves to specialize in cars 
with the opening of trade, it gives up 1 ton of steel for each additional car it pro-
duces. With the additional car, it can trade for 1.5 tons of steel, which is a net gain 
of 0.5 tons over its own production. Similarly, Malaysia gives up 0.5 cars produced 
for each additional ton of steel it manufactures, but it gains 0.67 cars from each ton 
of steel traded. Both countries benefit and are able to consume a greater amount 
of both goods than they could if they relied on their national production alone.

79
This is a very simplified example of the gains from trade, but it illustrates a fun-
damental principle. What matters most for the purposes of trade is not a country’s 
absolute advantage, but rather its comparative advantage. This is a central point 
of international economics: Differences in absolute advantage do not eliminate 
gains from trade. Furthermore, although both countries gain from trade, it does 
not imply that their living standards or incomes are equal. Malaysia’s income will 
be less than Japan’s because it produces less per hour. In effect, an hour of work 
in Malaysia returns the equivalent of 1 ton of steel or, through trade, 0.67 cars. 
Japanese workers produce 2 cars per hour worked, which is equivalent to 3 tons of 
steel through trade. As a result of higher absolute productivity, incomes in Japan 
are quite a bit higher, with or without trade.

Changing Comparative Advantage in the 
Republic of Korea, 1960–2010
Few countries began life with a more limited set of possibilities than the Repub-
lic of Korea (South Korea). Liberated from its forty years of colonial status 
(1905–1945) by the defeat of Japan in World War II, Korea was soon wracked 
by civil war (1950–1953) and divided into two nations. Many observers were 
pessimistic about the future of noncommunist South Korea. The industrial 
capacity of the country was mostly located in communist-controlled North 
Korea, and South Korea had little to offer besides the dedication and hard 
work of its people. Yet, over the following fifty years, few countries have grown 
faster.
From 1960 to 2010, per capita income in the Republic of Korea grew at the 
rate of 5.4 percent per year, in real terms (Table 3.4). At this rate, per capita 
income doubles every thirteen years.
Korea’s economic strategy for the first few years after the Korean War was 
to limit imports and concentrate on producing import substitutes, a common 
strategy for developing countries in the 1950s. Korea was one of the first to 
recognize its limitations and to change its policies. In 1960 and 1961, political 
changes led to a change in economic policies and a more aggressive engagement

with the world economy. Korea removed many of its restrictions on imports 
and began to promote export-oriented industries. Between 1960 and 2010, its 
trade-to-GDP ratio increased from 15.8 to 102.
Initially, Korea’s export efforts were limited to the commodities on hand, 
mostly minerals, a few agricultural and marine products (for example, sea-
weed), and very simple consumer goods. Over several decades after 1960, 
its export industries evolved several times, from simple products requiring 
few skills and little capital to products that required more skills and greater 
capital. After its first few years of exploring its comparative advantage, Korea 
developed competitive sectors in wigs, textiles, shoes, and plywood. With the 
increase in income came increases in skills and financial capital. This permitted 
the development of more skill- and capital-intensive industries such as steel, 
shipbuilding, household appliances, and electronic subassemblies. Eventually, 
these were followed by cars, computers, and electronics. By the first decade 
of the new millennium, Korea was a high-income industrial economy capable 
of exporting the most technologically advanced products available in several 
fields. Clearly, its history demonstrates that comparative advantage is not 
unchangeable, and that it can be a vehicle for raising incomes and promoting 
development.
An increasing share of Korea’s output was sold in world markets. Conse-
quently, production was not limited to the growth in its own domestic market. 
In addition, its goods had to be competitive in quality and price. Its ability to 
obtain imports at world prices was also important, but standing behind Korea’s 
competitiveness was its rapid increases in productivity. Without more output 
per hour of work, incomes could not have risen as fast as they did, and Korea’s 
ability to shift its comparative advantage from low-skill to increasingly higher-
skill products could not have gone forward. In turn, productivity increases 
require a host of complementary changes, ranging from the development of 
universities and research institutes to organizational changes and the raising of 
financial capital for investing in new machinery and equipment.
In the process of promoting exports and raising productivity, Korea encoun-
tered a number of obstacles including its own bureaucratic inflexibility, prob-
lems in marketing to foreign markets that are radically different from Korea’s, 
and a shortage of technical management and industrial expertise. It met and 
overcame these obstacles, and today Korea is an example of a country that 
used its comparative advantage to develop its economy. At the same time, it 
also used the pressure of foreign competition to raise its own productivity and 
quality standards, which in turn raised the incomes of its citizens. Korea’s suc-
cess was a joint product of efforts by its government, the private sector, and a 
number of public-private organizations. It is an open question whether each 
of these played a similar role: Is Korea’s success due to the wise guidance of 
government policies, or did those policies play a secondary (or even negative) 
role compared to markets and competition?

COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE AND “Competitiveness”
LO 3.5	 Contrast the concepts of comparative advantage and competitiveness.
The rhetoric of “competitiveness” is so common in our public discourse that it is 
useful to consider its relationship to comparative advantage. In the analysis so far, 
comparative advantage resulted from productivity differences between nations in 
autarky. In our simple model of a barter economy, wages, prices, and exchange 
rates were omitted. Real businesses do not barter steel for bread, however, and 
they cannot pay their workers by dividing up the firm’s output.
In general, by ignoring money wages, money prices, and exchange rates, 
we assumed that all goods and labor were correctly priced. In other words, we 
assumed that the prices of outputs and inputs are an accurate indication of their 
relative scarcity. In this case, there is no difference between a nation’s compara-
tive advantage and the ability of its firms to sell goods at prices that are competi-
tive. That is, if all markets correctly value the price of inputs and outputs, then a 
nation’s commercial advantage is determined by its comparative advantage.
Unfortunately, markets sometimes fail to produce optimal outcomes, and at 
times, outputs and inputs are incorrectly priced. Sometimes, undervaluation or over-
valuation of a good stems from inherent difficulties in measuring its true value or in 
measuring its true cost of production. For example, we usually ignore the costs of air 
pollution when we measure the costs of driving a car. Other times, undervaluation or 
overvaluation may result from government policies, as when prices are maintained 
at an artificially high or low level. In either case, the fact that a market price may not 
accurately reflect the economic value of an input or an output means that a wedge is 
driven between commercial or competitive advantage and comparative advantage.
It is often (incorrectly) argued that nations should pursue commercial advan-
tages for their firms even if it means a misallocation of resources. In effect, this 
means that a country follows policies that lower living standards by failing to 
maximize the value of national output. In terms of Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.5, this is 
equivalent to asserting that the United States and Canada should each remain at a 
point like A, where the United States overestimates the value of producing its own 
bread and Canada overestimates the value of steel. Both countries end up with 
consumption bundles that are suboptimal from the standpoint of national welfare.
Consider a real-world example. Indonesia tried to develop an aircraft industry 
in spite of the fact that it lacks a comparative advantage in aircraft production. 
Nevertheless, through a combination of government policies (some of which paid 
people to buy the planes!), the price to foreigners was competitive at times. From 
the perspective of Indonesian national welfare and the optimal use of scarce Indo-
nesian resources, this was a mistake. From the perspective of a business, however, 
Indonesian policies made it profitable to make airplanes, even though it meant 
using resources in ways that were suboptimal from the national perspective.
This case illustrates the common mistake of equating nations with business 
enterprises. Indonesian plane manufacturers care about their subsidies and any 

82
Part 2    International Trade
other policy that makes them profitable. The national interest, however, is to 
achieve the most efficient allocation of resources possible within the framework of 
the nation’s laws and values. It is possible to make individual firms highly profit-
able through subsidies or protection from international competition, while at the 
same time and through the same policies cause the nation’s overall standard of liv-
ing to be lower than it would be otherwise. Businesses are not designed to ensure 
that resources are efficiently allocated at the national level. If they can legally tip 
the playing field in their direction, they will not hesitate.
Another important distinction between nations and business enterprises is that 
nations do not compete with each other in any normal sense of the word. Economic 
relations between the United States and Canada, or any pair of nations, are not equiv-
alent to the commercial competition that exists between companies such as Coke and 
Pepsi. If Canada grows, the United States does not go out of business or suffer in any 
identifiable way. In fact, Canadian growth would be a stimulus to U.S. growth and 
would create spillover benefits for Americans. Cola companies fight over a relatively 
static market size, but nations can all simultaneously increase their incomes.
ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING
LO 3.6	 Discuss the economic and ethical considerations of economic 
restructuring caused by international trade.
Economic restructuring refers to changes in the economy that may require some 
industries to grow and others to shrink or disappear altogether. For example, the 
United States has seen a dramatic decrease in the size of its steel industry and, 
some years later, a rebirth of a new industry based around smaller, more special-
ized steel mills. The car industry has been through several periods of decline and 
recovery and has unknown long-term prospects. In any dynamic economy, some 
types of economic activity will be growing, and others will be scaling back or dying. 
In some cases, these changes are a direct consequence of increased openness to 
foreign competition. For example, the influx of Japanese cars has played a major 
role in the reorganization and restructuring of the U.S. auto industry.
In our simple Ricardian model, after the opening of trade, the United States was 
able to maximize its well-being by shifting workers out of bread production and 
into steel production. Even though this restructuring of the economy improved 
overall economic welfare, it does not mean that it benefited every individual—a 
nation’s gains from trade may be divided in different ways, and it is usually the 
case that some individuals benefit while others are hurt by trade. If there are net 
gains from opening trade (which are measured by an increase in the consumption 
bundle), then it means that the economic gains of the winners are greater than 
the economic losses of the losers, and therefore the nation as a whole is better off. 
Nevertheless, opening an economy to increased foreign competition is rarely pain-
less and usually generates a number of new problems. In the model used in this 
chapter, it was assumed that workers can effortlessly and without costs move back 
and forth between industries as one expands and the other shrinks. In reality, this 

Chapter 3    Comparative Advantage and the Gains from Trade 
83
is not an option. While some laid-off workers in a declining industry may quickly 
find new jobs, many do not. They may not know which companies need workers, 
or their skills may not match those that are in demand.
The model of comparative advantage does not offer a set of policies for address-
ing the problems of dislocated workers. Those policies have to come from another 
branch of economic analysis, such as labor economics, and from outside econom-
ics. It is widely recognized, however, that changes in trade patterns, whether they 
are due to trade agreements, a unilateral reduction in trade barriers, technologi-
cal breakthroughs, or any other cause, will result in some dislocation of firms and 
workers. Most economists continue to support more open trading arrangements, 
however, because foreign trade increases our choices as consumers, it lowers the 
costs of inputs for producers, it increases competition and innovation, and it leads to 
a greater diffusion of technological change. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in 
mind that the gains from trade do not mean that every worker or every firm benefits.
To a large extent, political assumptions about the way the world works will color 
the solutions to the problem of worker dislocation offered by economists, political 
scientists, and other social scientists. For example, believers in less government 
intervention in the economy would argue that government should not have any 
policies for handling unemployment caused by the rapid growth of imports. They 
maintain that unemployment is a self-correcting problem; laid-off workers will 
look for new jobs and will, if necessary, accept lower wages. Others make a value 
judgment that this sort of social problem should not be a governmental concern, 
and that it should be left up to the private economy and individual initiative.
An alternative to the “do nothing” approach is for the government to look for 
ways to compensate the losers. The proponents of this view justify it on several 
grounds. First, the nation as a whole benefits from trade, so there are newly added 
resources to the economy that make compensation possible. Second, many people 
believe that they have an ethical obligation to assist people hurt by economic 
change. And third, compensation reduces the incentives to oppose foreign trade.
The practice of offering trade adjustment assistance (TAA) is common in many 
countries, including the United States. Usually these programs take the form of 
extended unemployment benefits and worker re-training. For example, the U.S. 
government created a special program of benefits for workers who are hurt by 
trade with Mexico due to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
In 1994, the first year of NAFTA, 17,000 workers qualified for TAA under the 
NAFTA provision. Generally, in order to qualify for the benefits, workers must 
demonstrate that they were laid off as a result of imports from Mexico or Canada 
or because their firm relocated to one of those countries. Needless to say, it is 
sometimes difficult to establish a direct link between imports and job loss; a poorly 
managed firm may have been on its way out of business with or without imports.
The important point is that trade creates change, and it may be difficult for 
some people, industries, or communities to deal with it. When a nation moves 
along its PPC toward a different mix of industries, there is a period of transition 
that is painful for some. Economic restructuring does not happen overnight, and 
although it is desirable for the higher living standard it brings, change and trans-
formation cost time and money.

Losing Comparative Advantage
The case study on Korea shows that comparative advantage is not fixed in 
time but changes as countries develop their economies. Changing compara-
tive advantage cuts two ways, however, and some production stops being an 
efficient use of a country’s capital and labor. In the Korean case, there are 
products that it exported early in its development that are no longer cost effi-
cient to make.
Agriculture is an area where many countries experience a declining com-
parative advantage over time. Some agricultural crops tend to be very labor 
intensive, and the cost of labor rises as an economy develops. Technology may 
solve some of the problems of rising wages by reducing the need for labor, but 
other crops resist an efficient technological solution. In an ideal world, workers 
in industries that lose their comparative advantage would easily and quickly 
move to an industry where new opportunities appear.
Comparative advantage in agriculture is not the only concern countries have 
when thinking about their agricultural sector. Issues of food safety, food inde-
pendence, and support for rural culture and society are all concerns to one 
degree or another, more in some countries than others.
One of the objectives of the nearly defunct Doha Round of the WTO was 
to create an economic environment in which low-cost agricultural producers 
have access to other countries’ markets. The goal was to increase efficiency 
in the world economy by locating production where the opportunity costs are 
lowest, while at the same time creating opportunities for developing countries. 
If a developing country has a comparative advantage in, say, cotton, but foreign 
markets are not open, it cannot fully obtain the benefits of its comparative 
advantage.
Cotton is not a food crop, and its treatment highlights some of the funda-
mental difficulties involved in persuading countries to drop trade barriers, as 
well as the fundamental reasons why it is desirable to see barriers fall. Accord-
ing to the International Cotton Advisory Committee, the highest cost produc-
ers in the world include Greece, Spain, and the United States, all of which are 
countries classified as high-income by the World Bank. Lowest-cost producers 
are in sub-Saharan western Africa (for example, Burkina Faso, Mali, Benin) 
and central Asia (for example, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan).
Cotton is not a major item in world trade and is significantly less than one-
half of one percent of total merchandise trade. Nevertheless, it is important 
since as many as one hundred million households depend on income earned 
growing cotton, and several of the low-cost producers depend on their cotton 
export earnings to buy essential imports such as grain. Table 3.5 compares 
cotton production, its share of trade, and income per person in a few of the

TABLE 3.5  Low-Cost and High-Cost Cotton Producers
low-cost and high-cost producers. As shown, low-cost countries produce less 
but depend more on cotton exports, as their very low levels of income put them 
close to the edge of survival and they have fewer goods to export. High-cost 
producers depend much less on their cotton exports and have much higher 
incomes.
High-cost producers like the United States and Greece depend on a variety 
of government interventions to keep their cotton producers in business. In 
Greece, direct and indirect payments, along with tariffs on imports of cot-
ton, are administered through the European Union’s Common Agricultural 
Program. In the United States, the Department of Agriculture administers a 
number of farm support programs, including payments to farmers, subsidized 
loans, revenue guarantees, subsidized insurance, marketing and promotion 
assistance, and others, while the Department of Commerce administers a set 
of tariffs on foreign cotton entering the U.S. market.
Rich countries that try to keep their high-cost producers in business do more 
than keep production going where it is less efficient. They also have the poten-
tial to harm the living standards of some of the world’s poorest countries and to 
block one of their paths to higher incomes. By using their wealth to subsidize 
production, high-cost producers increase world supply and limit the ability of 
low-cost producers to fully exploit their comparative advantage in cotton. In 
sum, high-income countries find it politically difficult to give up their support 
for older, less efficient sectors.

Summary
■
■The single most important determinant of trade patterns is the opportunity 
cost of producing traded goods. Countries that sacrifice the least amount 
of alternative production when producing a particular good have the low-
est opportunity cost, or a comparative advantage. The idea of comparative 
advantage has been one of the most enduring concepts of economic thought 
and has been a central theme in international economic policy since the 
mid-1800s.
■
■Nations that produce according to their comparative advantage are maximiz-
ing the benefits they receive from trade and, consequently, their national 
welfare. This is the same as maximizing their gains from trade.
■
■Comparative advantage is often confused with absolute advantage. The lat-
ter refers to the advantage a nation has if its absolute productivity in a par-
ticular product is greater than that of its trading partners. It is not necessary 
to have an absolute advantage in order to have a comparative advantage.
■
■One common fallacious argument against following comparative advantage 
is that workers in other countries are paid less than workers at home. This 
argument neglects the issue of productivity. Developing countries’ wages 
are lower because the value of output from one hour of labor is less. Labor 
productivity is less because workers are generally less skilled, they have less 
capital on the job, and they have less capital in the surrounding economy to 
support their on-the-job productivity.
■
■Businesspeople look at the issue of trade differently than economists do 
because they have different objectives in mind. Businesspeople are often 
concerned about their ability to compete—that is, to sell a particular item 
in a given market at the lowest price. Their perspective is that of the firm. 
Economists focus on the efficient use of resources at the national or global 
level. The perspective is that of all firms taken together.

INTRODUCTION: THE DETERMINANTS OF 
COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE
The theory of comparative advantage presented in the previous chapter assumed that 
countries have different levels of productivity without going into the reasons behind the 
differences. In this chapter, the emphasis is on the factor endowments of labor, capital, 
and resources found inside a country. We hypothesize that these factor endowments 
determine a country’s opportunity costs of production and its comparative advantage. 
We also look more closely at the role of trade in causing changes in production and 
the consequent impacts on wages earned by workers and profits and rents earned by 
owners of capital and resources. This analysis helps clarify the opposition to expanded 
trade that comes from people who fear that it will reduce the demand for their labor 
or capital and lead to a decline in income.

MODERN TRADE THEORY
LO 4.1	 Use the Heckscher-Ohlin Trade Model to analyze trade patterns 
between two countries with two inputs and two outputs.
In Chapter 3, comparative advantage depended on each country’s relative pro-
ductivity, which was given by assumption at the start of the discussion. Smith and 
Ricardo thought that each country would have its own technology, its own cli-
mate, and its own resources, and that differences among nations would give rise to 
productivity differences. In the twentieth century, several economists developed 
a more detailed explanation of trade in which the comparative advantage of a 
country depends on its endowments of the inputs (called factors of production, or 
simply, factors) that are used to produce each good. The theory has various names: 
the Heckscher-Ohlin theory (HO), the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson theory, or the 
Factor Proportions theory. They all refer to the same set of ideas.
The HO Trade Model
The HO trade model begins with the observation that nations are endowed with 
different levels of each input (factors). Furthermore, each output has a ­different 
technology for its production and requires different combinations and levels of 
the various inputs. Steel production, for example, requires a lot of iron ore, ­coking 
material, semiskilled labor, and some expensive capital equipment. Clothing 
production requires unskilled and semiskilled workers with rudimentary capital 
equipment in the form of sewing machines.
In order to analyze how the availability of inputs creates productivity differ-
ences, we first define factor abundance and factor scarcity. Table 4.1 illustrates 
the concepts with a numerical example. The capital-labor ratio of the United 
States (Kus/Lus) is 50150, or 13. Canada’s (Kcan/Lcan) is 210, or 15. Because the 
United States’ capital-labor ratio is higher than Canada’s (Kus/Lus 7 Kcan/Lcan), 
the United States is the relatively capital-abundant country and Canada is the 
relatively labor-abundant country. Note that Canada’s absolute labor endowment 
is less than that of the United States, but Canada is still considered labor-abundant 
because it has more labor relative to its capital.
Relative abundance of a factor implies that in autarky its relative cost is less 
than in countries where it is relatively scarcer. Conversely, relatively scarce 
resources are more expensive. Consequently, capital is relatively cheap and labor 
is relatively expensive in the United States, and vice versa for Canada. It follows

The United States is capital abundant and Canada is labor abundant.

Chapter  4     Comparative Advantage and Factor Endowments 
91
that economies have relatively lower costs in the production of goods where the 
technology calls for greater quantities of the abundant factor and smaller quanti-
ties of the scarce factor. In this example, Canada will have a lower opportunity cost 
in production that uses relatively more labor and relatively less capital, while the 
United States will have a lower opportunity cost in production that uses relatively 
more capital and less labor.
The HO trade theory makes this point. It asserts that a country’s comparative 
advantage lies in the production of goods that intensively use relatively abundant 
factors. To clarify, consider the United States. It is richly endowed with a wide 
variety of factors. It has natural resources in the form of rich farmland and exten-
sive forests. It has highly skilled labor, such as scientists, engineers, and manag-
ers. The wealth of the nation has enabled it to create an abundance of physical 
capital, both public and private. Its exports, therefore, should include agricultural 
­products, particularly those requiring skilled labor and physical capital, and all 
sorts of machinery and industrial goods that require intensive input of physical 
capital and scientific and engineering skills.
One leading U.S. export is commercial jet aircraft—a product that requires a 
vast array of physical capital and scientific, engineering, and managerial talent. 
The United States is also a major exporter of grains and grain products, such as 
vegetable oils. These are produced with relatively small labor inputs, very large 
capital inputs (combines, tractors, and so on), farmland, and a great deal of scien-
tific research and development that has produced hybrid seeds, pesticides, herbi-
cides, and other agricultural inputs.
Gains from Trade in the HO Model
In the Ricardian model we assume that each country faces a constant set of 
­trade-offs: two loaves of bread for three tons of steel (United States) or three 
loaves of bread for one ton of steel (Canada). The constant costs of the ­Ricardian 
model stem from the fact that there is one homogeneous input—labor, which can 
be used to make bread or steel. Workers do not vary in their skills, and since there 
is no capital input, each worker is as productive as the next. Consequently, when 
labor is reallocated from bread to steel, or vice versa, the trade-off is always at a 
constant rate.
In the HO model, we have a multiplicity of inputs—labor, capital, farmland—so 
each worker may be equipped with a different quantity of supporting inputs, such 
as capital. Obviously, at the end of the day a worker with a $5 shovel will have dug 
a smaller hole than one equipped with a $150,000 earth-moving machine. Further-
more, the quality of labor and capital can vary. Some labor is skilled, and some is 
unskilled. Certain jobs require scientific or other technical training, while others 
require basic literacy or even less. Similarly, capital can be low- or high-tech, and 
resources such as farmland have different fertility and climate characteristics. In 
effect, each important qualitative difference can be treated as a key characteristic of 
a separate input, so unskilled and skilled labor can be considered different factors.
If a country has multiple inputs with various suitabilities for different tasks, we 
can no longer assume a production possibilities curve (PPC) with constant costs. 

92
Part 2    International Trade
Rather, the economy is assumed to have increasing costs, which implies that each 
country has a rising opportunity cost for each type of production. Consequently, 
as the United States or Canada moves labor, capital, and land into bread produc-
tion, each additional unit of bread leads to a greater loss of steel output than the 
one before. The reason is straightforward: If more bread is wanted, resources must 
be taken out of steel. The optimal strategy is to move resources that are relatively 
good at bread production, but poor at steel production. This leads to the greatest 
gain in bread with the smallest loss of steel. The next shift in production, toward 
more bread, cuts deeper into the stock of resources used for steel production, and 
in all likelihood there will not be resources to move that are as good at bread and 
as poor at steel as the previous production shift. Consequently, in order to get the 
same increase in bread, more steel must be given up than before. This result is 
symmetric, so shifts going the other way, toward more steel, cause the opportunity 
cost of steel to rise with each shift. Figure 4.1 illustrates a PPC with increasing costs.
As with constant costs, the trade-off between bread and steel is equal to the 
slope of the PPC. Since the PPC is curved, its slope changes at every point, and we 
must measure the trade-off at the point of production. For example, in Figure 4.2, 
if the United States is producing at point A, then the opportunity cost of an addi-
tional ton of steel is equivalent to the slope of the PPC at point A. Since the PPC 
is a curve rather than a straight line, the slope is measured by drawing a tangent 
line at the point of production and measuring its slope.
Most of the analysis of the gains from trade discussed in Chapter 3 carries over 
into the HO model. In order to demonstrate this, assume that point A is the U.S. 
production point in autarky and that at point A the opportunity cost of steel is 
0.67 loaves of bread. This means that the slope of the tangent at A is -0.67. Also 
assume that Canada’s opportunity cost of steel is above that of the United States 
at 3 loaves of bread per ton, the same as before and that after trade begins, the 
world price, or trade price, is 2 loaves of bread per ton of steel, the same as the 
example shown in Chapter 3. After trade opens, the United States can continue to 
produce at A and not trade, or it can produce at A and move along its consump-
tion possibilities curve (CPC), trading steel for bread. As before, line CPC is both

the trade line showing the rate at which bread and steel exchange for each other, 
and it is the CPC since it shows the possible consumption bundles when produc-
tion is at A and trade occurs.
In Figure 4.3, CPC’ is a trade line that is tangent to the PPC at point B, an 
alternative production point to the right of A and closer to the steel axis. If the 
United States exploits its comparative advantage and shifts toward increased steel 
production, increasing costs come into play. Moving towards the steel axis raises 
the marginal cost of steel output. As production rises, the gap between the oppor-
tunity cost of production and the trade price narrows until, finally, they are equal 
at point B. Further increases in steel production would push the cost above its 
value in trade; therefore, they are not warranted.
At point B, the opportunity cost of steel equals its trade price. Since the model is 
symmetric and the opportunity cost and trade price of bread are the inverse of the

steel, the same equivalency holds for bread. To the left of B, the opportunity cost of 
steel (bread) is less (greater) than the trade price, so more (less) production is war-
ranted. To the right of B, the opportunity cost of steel (bread) is greater (less) than 
the trade price, so less (more) production is warranted. Only at point B does the 
opportunity cost equal the trade price. Since no other changes can make the United 
States better off, point B is the production combination that maximizes income.
Graphically, the superiority of point B can be seen by first comparing B to A. 
Point B is clearly superior to A in terms of the consumption possibilities because 
for every point along CPC there is another point on CPC’ that offers more of both 
goods. That is, CPC’ lies above and to the right of CPC. Since a greater combina-
tion of both goods is available if the United States produces at B and trades, B 
is superior to A. Furthermore, when the trade price is 2, every other production 
point along the PPC leads to smaller consumption bundles. That is, at any other 
production point, a trade line with a slope of -2 that passes through the point will 
lie below and to the left of CPC’, representing smaller combinations of steel and 
bread. Consequently, point B maximizes income by creating the largest possible 
consumption bundle.
The notion of gains from trade in the HO model is nearly the same as in the 
Ricardian model. The only significant difference is that specialization is not com-
plete in the HO model. The United States continues to make some bread, and 
Canada makes some steel.
TRADE AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION
LO 4.2	 Predict the impacts on different factors of production of trade-opening.
Recall that in the Ricardian model of comparative advantage, the nation as a 
whole gained from trade, and, by assumption, we ruled out the potentially harm-
ful effects of trade on some members of society. When trade began, the economy 
shifted from one point on its production frontier to a different point. Workers that 
were affected by the production shift simply moved out of the declining indus-
try and into the expanding one. Everyone had the same skills, and each type of 
production required only labor, so everyone had access to a job, and everyone 
benefited from both the fall in the price of the imported good and the rise in the 
price of the exported one.
The HO trade model is a more sophisticated way to analyze the gains and 
losses from trade because it drops these unrealistic assumptions. Labor can be 
divided into two or more skill categories, other types of inputs can be included, 
and industries can require different mixes of the various inputs. Under these 
more realistic assumptions, it can be shown that while trade benefits the nation 
as a whole, some groups within the nation benefit more than others, and some 
will actually be harmed. Furthermore, it can be shown that there is a system-
atic relationship between the factor endowments of a country and the winners 
and losers from trade. Opening the discussion to an analysis of winners and 

Chapter  4     Comparative Advantage and Factor Endowments 
95
losers adds an important and necessary element of realism. We are all aware 
that not ­everyone favors increased trade, and without an analysis of trade’s 
income distribution effects, we have no basis for understanding the opposition 
to increased trade.
The Stolper-Samuelson Theorem
Everyone’s income depends on the inputs that he or she supplies to the economy. 
Labor earns wages that may be high or low, depending on the skill level; owners of 
capital earn profits; landowners earn rents. The amount of income earned per unit 
of input depends on the demand for the inputs as well as their supply. The demand 
for a particular input is sometimes referred to as a derived demand because it is 
derived indirectly from the demand for the output that it is used to produce. If the 
output is in high demand, and consequently its price is high, then the inputs that 
are used to produce it will benefit by receiving higher returns.
In general, any change in the economy that alters the price of outputs will 
have a direct impact on incomes. We have seen that trade causes output prices 
to change by causing an increase in export prices and a decrease in import prices. 
The movement of prices causes a change in the demand for each factor and 
leads to a change in the returns paid to each factor. Hence, trade affects income 
distribution.
When trade begins and output prices change, some resources leave the sector 
that produces imported goods and move into the sector that produces exports. In 
the HO model, unlike the simple Ricardian model, different goods are produced 
with different combinations of inputs, so the movement along the production pos-
sibilities frontier causes a change in the demand for each input. Factors that are 
used intensively in the imported goods sector will find that the demand for their 
services has shrunk—and so has their income. Conversely, factors used intensively 
in the export sector will experience an increase in the demand for their services 
and in their incomes. In sum, when trade begins, incomes of the factors used 
intensively in the import sector fall, and incomes of the factors used intensively 
in the export sector rise.
These effects are summarized in the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, which 
is derived from the HO theory. The Stolper-Samuelson theorem says that an 
increase in the price of a good raises the income earned by factors that are used 
intensively in its production. Conversely, a fall in the price of a good lowers the 
income of the factors that it uses intensively.
Figure 4.4 illustrates these tendencies. Suppose that the United States and 
Canada can make bread or steel, using capital and labor. Also suppose that bread 
is the labor-intensive product, shown as follows:
Kb/Lb 6 Ks/Ls
and that the United States is relatively well endowed with capital, compared to 
Canada, as follows:
Kcan/Lcan 6 Kus/Lus.

96
Part 2    International Trade
According to the HO theory, the United States will have a comparative advan-
tage in steel, which it will export in return for Canadian bread. In Figure 4.4, after 
trade begins, the United States moves along its PPC toward the steel axis from 
point A to point B.
As the United States shifts along its PPC, the change in the mix of goods 
produced leads to lower demands for labor and higher demands for capital. The 
steel industry will pick up some of the labor laid off in the bread industry, but 
since it is not as labor intensive as bread, its increase in labor demand is less than 
the fall in labor demand in the bread industry. The net result is that labor experi-
ences a fall in demand, leading to a fall in wages and income earned. Note that 
Stolper-Samuelson does not state that all factors used in the export industries 
are better off, or that all factors used in the import competing industry get hurt. 
Rather, the abundant factor that is used to determine comparative advantage 
and exports is favored, and the scarce factor sees a decline in its income, regard-
less of industry.
The Stolper-Samuelson theorem is a starting point for understanding the 
income distribution effects of trade, but it tells only part of the story. An extension 
of the theorem, called the magnification effect, shows that the change in output 
prices has a magnified effect on factor incomes. For example, if after opening trade 
bread prices decline by 75 percent, then the fall in labor income will be greater 
than 75 percent. Similarly, if the price of an export good (steel) rises by 50 percent, 
for example, incomes earned by the intensively used factors in the export sector 
(capital) rise more than 50 percent.
The ultimate effects on income of an opening of trade depend on the flex-
ibility of the affected factors. If labor is stuck in bread production and unable to 
move to the steel sector, it could be hurt much worse than if it were completely

flexible to move. Another example illustrates this point: Within the debate over 
U.S.-Mexico free trade, there was a small, but intense, controversy surrounding 
avocado production. Mexico has a comparative advantage in avocados because 
it is well endowed with the necessary inputs (a particular quality of land and 
climate, together with unskilled labor and a little capital). If free trade were to 
open in the avocado market, the owners of avocado orchards in California argued 
that they would find their investments in land, equipment, and avocado trees 
worthless. Why would anyone pay $1 or more per avocado when Mexican ones 
cost 25¢ or less? However, many of the California avocado groves are located in 
the suburbs of sprawling metropolitan regions, and presumably, if the land were 
worthless for avocado production, it could be put to valuable use in another 
line of production—for example, as housing developments. Consequently, the 
income of the landowners may not decline in the long run, although in the short 
run landowners may be unable to put their land to an alternative use. In order to 
build these considerations into a trade model, we must turn to a short-run version 
of the HO model.
The Specific Factors Model
In the short run, the ability of factors to move between different output sectors is 
more limited. For example, suppose stiffer competition in the world steel industry 
causes American steelworkers to take pay cuts, and perhaps some to lose their 
jobs. In the long run, most of the laid-off steelworkers will find jobs outside the 
steel sector, but in the short run, they are stuck with cuts in pay and layoffs. Simi-
larly, physical capital is usually dedicated to a particular use and cannot be con-
verted to producing a different product, and, as we have seen, land is usually tied 
up in a particular use and cannot be switched to something else instantaneously. 
In the long run, however, plants and equipment can be redirected to a different 
line of production, land can be put to different uses, and workers find jobs doing 
something else.
In order to highlight the ability of labor and other factors to find alternative 
employment in the long run but not in the short run, economists sometimes add 
conditions to the HO model. Suppose there are three factors—land, labor, and 
capital—and two goods—steel and bread. Assume that the production of steel 
takes capital and labor, while bread takes land and labor. In this version of the 
HO model, labor is the variable factor because its use varies between both goods. 
Land and capital are the specific factors because their use is specific to bread and 
steel, respectively.
The model just described is an example of the specific factors model, a special 
case of the HO model. The HO model assumes that factors migrate easily from 
one sector to another—from steel to bread, for example. In the specific factors 
model (Table 4.2), each good is produced with a specific factor that is used only 
in the production of that good, and a variable factor that is used to produce both 
goods. The specific factors (land and capital) are immobile and cannot move 

98
Part 2    International Trade
between bread and steel, while the variable factor (labor) is completely mobile 
between industries.
The determinants of comparative advantage with a specific factors model are 
similar to the analysis with an HO model. As with HO, comparative advantage 
depends on factor endowments. The main difference in the two models is that 
the specific factor plays a critical role. Suppose that Canada is relatively well 
endowed with land and that the United States is relatively well endowed with 
capital. Then Canada exports bread, and the United States exports steel. The 
reasoning is the same as with the HO model. Since Canada is well endowed with 
the specific factor used to make bread, its opportunity cost of bread production 
is lower than it is in the United States, where land is relatively less abundant. 
Similarly, steel uses capital, which is abundant in the United States and relatively 
scarce in Canada.
The analysis of the income distribution effects of trade is straightforward. 
When trade opens, each country follows its comparative advantage and moves 
toward greater specialization. The shift in production reduces the demand for 
the specific factor that is used in the industry that shrinks and the income of the 
factor declines. For example, Canada cuts back on steel production in order to 
concentrate on bread. Canadian owners of capital are hurt, since the structure of 
the economy moves away from the production of capital-intensive steel, while 
Canadian landowners experience precisely the opposite effect. Their incomes rise 
as the demand for land to produce bread exports rises. In the United States, land-
owners lose and capital owners win.
In this example, the income distribution effects of trade on labor, the variable 
factor, are indeterminate. Since labor is mobile, workers laid off in the declin-
ing sector find employment in the expanding sector. Canadian workers find that 
steel is cheaper, so they are better off to the extent that they consume products 
that embody steel. On the other hand, the fact that the world price of bread is 
above the price that Canadians paid in autarky means that they are worse off to 
the extent that their income goes to buy bread. The net effect on Canadian labor 
depends on which effect is strongest, rising bread prices or falling steel prices. U.S. 
workers face rising steel prices and falling bread prices, and, again, the net effect 
is ambiguous and depends on their consumption patterns.

Comparative Advantage in a Single 
Natural Resource
Natural resources are a source of comparative advantage in many countries. 
Chile has copper, Botswana has diamonds, and Saudi Arabia has oil. Crude oil 
is probably the most important geopolitical resource today, and it is certainly 
the largest resource market. In fact, other than currency trading, international 
trade in crude oil exceeds the volume and value of any other good or service. 
According to the United Nation’s Commission on Trade and Development 
and the U.S. Energy Information Administration, worldwide daily exports of 
crude oil in 2014 were approximately 88 million barrels. At an average price 
of around $48 per barrel, this is equivalent to more than $4.2 billion per day.
Comparative advantage in crude oil production depends largely on a coun-
try’s endowment of oil, and as everyone is aware, countries in the Middle East 
have a majority of the world’s proven reserves of crude oil. Table 4.3 shows the 
ten countries with the world’s largest reserves and the share of fuel products 
in their total exports.
Oil is valuable. Consequently, when countries are endowed with crude oil 
reserves, capital and labor are pulled into the sector because it is the most valuable 
use of inputs. It is also a clear example of following comparative advantage based 
on resource endowments. There is a downside, however, as the potential returns

EMPIRICAL TESTS OF THE THEORY OF 
COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE
LO 4.3	 Discuss the limits of the HO model.
All the popular theories of trade are variations on the idea of comparative advan-
tage, and each theory makes predictions about the goods that a country will export 
and import. Therefore, it should be relatively straightforward to test each theory 
by holding its predictions up to actual trade flows and seeing if the two match. 
Unfortunately, empirical tests of trade theories are more difficult to conduct than 
they are to describe. Part of the problem is that it is difficult to measure variables 
such as factor endowments and prices in autarky.
The trade theories presented here and in Chapter 3 are the two most widely 
accepted by economists—the Ricardian theory of trade, based on relative pro-
ductivities, and the HO theory, based on factor endowments. In the Ricardian 
theory discussed in Chapter 3, comparative advantage depended on relative 
from developing an oil industry can make it difficult to develop other economic 
activities. This is evident in Table 4.3, which shows that oil’s share of total exports is 
high for most countries. Most of the economies listed are one-product economies.
The problem of a single, valuable resource that crowds out the development 
of other economic activities is called a resource curse. The resource curse is not 
inevitable for economies with large endowments of oil or some other valuable 
mineral—Canada, for instance, has overcome it—but it poses a challenge and 
it gives caution to the idea that resources are always a path to prosperity. Other 
types of resource curses have been noted when a country has a sudden ­discovery 
of gold or another valuable mineral. Regardless of the resource behind the 
curse, in all cases where it is not overcome, labor and capital are concentrated 
in the extraction of one natural resource and it becomes difficult to develop a 
diversified economy. When the price of the dominant commodity fluctuates, 
national income is altered in a very short amount of time and can result in 
severe macroeconomic instability and alternating boom and bust cycles.
A further problem of a large endowment of a single resource is that it often 
causes political turmoil. There are strong incentives to try to gain control of 
the resource, leading to factions in leadership and political strife as different 
groups struggle with each other. The promise of significant wealth can easily 
lead to corruption in countries with weak governments, as politicians buy the 
political support they need. In the worse cases, civil war is a possibility.
Not every country with resources suffers from a resource curse. Strong insti-
tutions to guard against corruption, and commitment to education, skills, and 
savings can develop the human capital and financial capital that a country 
needs in order to diversify its economy and provide for the inevitable day when 
the resource is no longer as valuable. Canada has done this, and the United 
Arab Emirates (UAE) is following a similar path.

productivity. This model is easier to test because it is easier to measure labor 
productivity than factor endowments. Consequently, it is not surprising that sta-
tistical tests of the Ricardian theory have been more successful. In general, they 
have confirmed the hypothesis that trade patterns between pairs of countries are 
determined to a significant degree by the relative differences in their labor produc-
tivities. More specifically, as labor productivity in a particular industry increases, 
the greater the likelihood the country becomes a net exporter of the good.
Tests of the HO theory of trade have been mixed. One of the problems for 
researchers in this area is that it is difficult to obtain a uniform set of measure-
ments of factor endowments. In the presentation of the model in this chapter, only 
two inputs were considered, although we expanded that to three when we covered 
the specific factors model. In reality, there are many more than three factors. 
There are different kinds of labor (unskilled, semiskilled, managerial, technical, 
and so on), and there are many varieties of natural resources and capital. None 
of these categories has standardized definitions, and consequently each type of 
labor, capital, and natural resource is measured differently in each country. As a 
result, formal statistical analyses of tests of the HO theory have concluded that 
measurement errors in the data are a major problem.
Nevertheless, the consensus among economists seems to be that endowments 
matter, although they are far from the whole story. Even if it were possible to mea-
sure factor endowments accurately, technological differences between countries 
would not be captured, and these can be a significant source of productivity differ-
ences. In addition to technology, other important determinants of trade patterns 
not considered by the factor endowment theory are economies of scale, corporate 
structure, and economic policy.
While the theory of trade based on factor endowments receives mixed empiri-
cal support, it nevertheless remains the foundation of most economists’ thinking 
about trade. This may seem curious, but there is actually a good reason for it. 
While factor endowments cannot explain all of the world’s trade patterns, they 
do explain a significant part of them. Therefore, it is useful to begin with factor 
endowments and to supplement this view with other ideas. Perhaps most impor-
tantly, the factor endowment schema is a useful way to categorize the income 
distribution effects of trade. For both of these reasons, the HO model and its 
variations remain at the core of international economics.

industries that makes them unlike the simple models assumed by the Ricardian 
and HO models. Both, however, are elaborations of the theory of comparative 
advantage. In Chapter 5, we will leave the comparative advantage framework and 
look at cases where trade is not determined by productivity differences or factor 
endowments.
The Product Cycle
The product cycle model of trade was developed by Raymond Vernon. The model 
is an insightful analysis that incorporates ideas about the evolution of manufac-
tured goods and technology. One of its greatest strengths is that it can explain 
exports of sophisticated manufactured goods from countries that have shortages 
of skilled labor and capital.
Vernon pointed out that many manufactured products, such as automobiles, 
electronic devices, and new appliances, go through a product cycle in which the 
inputs change over time. Initially, when these goods are brand new, there is a great 
deal of experimentation in both the characteristics of the final product and its 
manufacturing process. For example, when computer tablets were first developed, 
there was a wide variety of different forms to choose from. Each had different sets 
of options—often even within the same technology—and the size of the device, 
memory capacity, connectability, and other features were not standardized.
In this early stage of production, manufacturers need to be near a high-income 
market, where consumer feedback is greatest. Experimentation with basic design 
features requires information about the market’s reaction. Consequently, there 
must be a consumer base with substantial income and skilled marketing to advertise 
information about the product. In addition, on the input side, experimentation and 
improvement in design and manufacturing require scientific and engineering inputs, 
along with capital that is willing to risk failure and an initial period of little or no 
profits. Both the consumption side and the production side necessitate that product 
research, development, and initial production take place in industrial countries.
Over time, however, the product begins to leave the early phase of its develop-
ment and production and enters the middle phase (see Figure 4.5 and Figure 4.6). 
The product itself begins to be standardized in size, features, and manufactur-
ing process. Experimentation with fundamentally new designs begins to wane as 
product development shifts toward incremental improvements in a basic design. 
In the middle phase, production begins to shift to countries with low labor costs. 
Standardized manufacturing routines are increasingly common, using low-skilled 
and semiskilled labor in assembly-type operations.
Countries reach the late phase of the product cycle when consumption in high-
income nations begins to exceed production. At this point, an increasing share of 
the world’s output is moving to developing countries where abundant unskilled 
and semiskilled labor keeps labor costs low. The pressure on high-income coun-
tries in the late phase is to turn toward innovation of new products, which starts 
the cycle over again.
The product cycle is a more elaborate story about technology than either the 
Ricardian or HO models. It may seem to differ fundamentally from those models, 

Chapter  4     Comparative Advantage and Factor Endowments 
103
but in fact it is very similar. At its core is a story about opportunity costs. As 
manufacturing processes become standardized, they can be performed by rel-
atively unskilled labor. In effect, the blend of inputs changes over time, from 
highly skilled scientific, engineering, and marketing elements to basic unskilled 
and semiskilled labor. Consequently, the opportunity cost of production in devel-
oping countries becomes lower than the cost in high-income countries. In essence, 
it’s the Ricardian story once again.

United States–China Trade
According to the IMF, China is the world’s most populous country, with more 
than 1.37 billion people, and the second largest economy after the United 
States, with GDP equivalent to 10.98 trillion U.S. dollars in 2015. China’s 
economy was substantially closed to the outside until 1978, when it began sig-
nificant economic reforms. Initially, the reforms were limited to agriculture, but 
they quickly incorporated a number of special economic zones in the coastal 
regions (see Chapter 17). China’s proximity to Hong Kong, along with large 
populations of Chinese in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and other regions 
of East Asia, enabled it to attract huge amounts of foreign investment once 
it became receptive to capital inflows. The net result is that its economy and, 
especially, its exports have grown rapidly over the last two decades.
China’s resource endowment includes a huge population of unskilled and 
semiskilled labor and a relative scarcity of scientific and engineering talent. It 
is not surprising, therefore, that its exports are heavily weighted toward labor-
intensive manufactured goods. Table 4.4 lists the top ten Chinese exports to 
the United States in 2014. Six of the top ten items are simple manufactured 
goods that use China’s abundant labor together with a small amount of capital: 
household goods, toys and sporting goods, apparel, footwear, and furniture.

Foreign Trade versus Foreign Investment
In the product cycle, firms invest abroad instead of exporting, and some of the 
output may be imported back into the home country. This pattern is very dif-
ferent from the simple HO model where countries export one good and import 
another. First, it implies that under the conditions outlined in the product cycle, 
firms prefer to invest abroad rather than to export. That is, they substitute foreign 
investment for foreign trade. Second, the part of the output that they ship from 
their foreign operation back into the home country is international trade, but it 
is handled entirely within a single firm. That is, they engage in intrafirm trade: 
international trade between a parent company and a foreign-owned affiliate.
Intrafirm trade is difficult to measure, but in the mid-1990s, it was estimated 
that about one-third of U.S. merchandise exports and two-fifths of merchandise 
imports were intrafirm. Most foreign investment, however, is not for the pur-
pose of exporting, but rather is intended to supply the market where the foreign 
investment is located. Whether for trade purposes or not, the selection of foreign 
investment instead of foreign trade poses a number of questions for economists 
and business scholars. Why do firms sometimes prefer to set up foreign-based 
operations instead of buying imports directly from a separate company located 
overseas? Or, if the foreign investment is for the purpose of selling in the foreign 
market, why don’t companies export directly to the market instead of producing 
there? In essence, the questions are the same because both ask about the circum-
stances that cause foreign investment rather than foreign trade.
The product cycle provides one answer to these questions, but it is an incom-
plete answer, because it does not explain why a firm would invest in China instead 
of in Mexico. If labor costs are the only reason, then Africa would have the most 
foreign investment instead of the least of any continent. Furthermore, the prod-
uct cycle is unable to explain why the greatest proportion of foreign investment 
goes to developed, industrial countries in Europe and North America where the 
comparative advantages are the same as or similar to those of the countries that 
supply the most foreign investment. According to United Nations data, high-
income countries normally provide and receive the vast bulk of foreign invest-
ment; since the financial crisis, they have received “only” 65 percent of foreign 
The remaining items give the appearance that China is upgrading its techno-
logical sophistication by making cell phones, computers, and computer acces-
sories. While no one should doubt the fact of technological upgrade, China’s 
exports of computers, telecommunications equipment, and other items do not 
reflect a high level of overall sophistication. Mostly, they illustrate the product 
cycle and the way multinational firms have cut up the value chain. Some of the 
goods are simple, standardized products, but others are assembled in China 
from parts that are imported. The next two case studies in this chapter explore 
this issue in more detail.

investment (while making over 80 percent), which is down from a more normal 
75 percent received before the crisis, but is still nearly two-thirds of all foreign 
direct investment.
Research into the trade-offs between investing abroad versus exporting from 
a home base acknowledges the importance of both the microeconomic charac-
teristics of firms and the macroeconomic characteristics of countries that attract 
foreign investment. Microeconomic factors look at the internal constraints and 
opportunities of individual firms, while macroeconomic factors take into account 
the conditions inside countries that cause them to be suitable locations for a for-
eign firm to invest. The analytical framework that combines both sets of charac-
teristics is known as the OLI theory of foreign direct investment. Its founder, John 
Dunning, offered it as an eclectic theory combining many different microeconomic 
and macroeconomic elements.
OLI is an acronym for ownership-location-internalization. In Dunning’s analy-
sis, firms investing abroad own an asset that gives them a competitive advantage 
in the world market (ownership). The asset may be something tangible, such as a 
patent, an innovation, a blueprint, or a trade secret; or it may be something intan-
gible, such as a trademark or the firm’s reputation. In either case, ownership of 
a valuable asset confers a potential advantage on the firm. Second, the firm will 
seek a production location that offers advantages (location). These may be in the 
form of low input costs, a large customer base, or an ability to produce a better 
product more efficiently due to the surrounding economic environment. Cheap 
labor is only one possibility, and if it does not come with a good infrastructure 
of roads and utilities, does not supply the skills that employers need, or is too far 
from the product’s final market, then the fact that wages are low will not overcome 
the country’s disadvantages.
Third, and most abstractly, the firm that invests abroad tries to capture within 
itself all the advantages that ownership of its asset confers (internalization). A firm 
that invests abroad can, if it chooses, simply sell the rights to its asset and let a 
foreign firm do the production—and in fact, many firms operate this way. That is, 
as an alternative, the investing firm can sell a license to its technology or its trade-
mark or its trade secrets. Some firms, however, choose to take on the added costs 
of setting up production in a foreign location. There are many potential reasons 
for this choice, including the fear of theft or copy of its technology, the problem 
of monitoring and enforcing a contract with a foreign firm, and the concern that 
production mistakes by the foreign firm may hurt the reputation or trademark 
of the home country firm. Whatever the reason, the investing firm decides that 
it benefits more if it internalizes the advantages of asset ownership within itself 
rather than sells those advantages to another firm.
Dunning’s analysis has been added to and extended by a large number of schol-
ars who have found it to be a robust and adaptable description of the behavior 
of many firms. It is not a theory of trade, because it describes the circumstances 
that motivate firms to invest abroad rather than to engage in trade, but it does 
not contradict trade theory. Rather, it simply states that firms are internationally 
mobile and will use the comparative advantages they find in different locations.

In this sense, it demonstrates how those advantages motivate individual firms to 
adapt their own behavior.
Off-Shoring and Outsourcing
Off-shoring and outsourcing are frequently used terms, but with varying defi-
nitions. In this text, off-shoring is defined as the movement of some or all of a 
firm’s activities to a location outside the home country; outsourcing is the reas-
signment of activities to another firm, either inside or outside the home country. 
All combinations of off-shoring and outsourcing are possibilities and exist in the 
world economy. Some firms off-shore but do not outsource, choosing to use a 
foreign affiliate, which is defined as a foreign-based operation owned by the firm 
in the home country. For example, a great deal of U.S.-Mexico trade is intrafirm, 
with car parts and electronic components going back and forth between parent 
companies in the United States and their foreign affiliates in Mexico. The parent 
companies have off-shored some production to Mexico, while choosing not to 
outsource. Others outsource, but do not off-shore; for example, if they subcontract 
activities with a domestic provider. A car company might decide to buy parts from 
a local firm rather than make them or have them made in Mexico. Finally, a firm 
may off-shore and outsource when it relocates production to a foreign location 
and signs a contract for delivery of services or goods with a firm that is not owned 
by the parent company.
Off-shoring became a concern in the 1980s when modern communications 
and transportation technology made it possible for firms to relocate production 
abroad. Initially, off-shoring was of greatest concern to workers in manufactur-
ing industries, but by the 1990s, as advancements continued in information tech-
nologies, it became possible to off-shore some services. This created concerns for 
workers in service sectors outside of manufacturing. Historically, most services 
have been consumed at the point of production, but more recently it has become 
possible to relocate some service production away from the point of consumption. 
For example, a doctor in the United States or Europe might consult a colleague 
in India who is specialized in reading a particular type of x-ray. The Internet and 
increased efficiencies in telecommunications make it possible for doctors in both 
places to see the same image and to inexpensively communicate with each other.
The effects and extent of off-shoring of services are not well understood since 
most countries do not collect the necessary types of data. Nevertheless, the first 
generation of research and analysis points toward a conclusion that is consistent 
with our traditional understanding of trade and comparative advantage—there is 
no obvious reason why trade in services should be different from trade in goods. 
An import that arrives by truck or ship is not conceptually different from one that 
arrives over the Internet. Services imports and exports should not be any differ-
ent in this regard, and specialization and trade should provide the same or similar 
gains for services as they do for goods.
The main focus of debate about off-shoring, whether in services or manufac-
turing, is the effect that it has on the home country, and in particular, the issue of 

108
Part 2    International Trade
job loss. Off-shoring is particularly unsettling for workers who felt immune from 
international trade, such as service workers, and it seems to be another instance 
of creeping globalization making life less certain. Research, however, shows that 
off-shoring has a variety of possible patterns. In some cases it leads to job losses 
in the home country, while in others it is complementary to home production 
rather than a substitute, and leads to an expansion of jobs and production rather 
than a contraction.

Off-Shoring by U.S. Multinational Corporations
As technology makes communications easier and as economies become more 
open to foreign investments, firms have responded by shifting production over-
seas. National statistical agencies such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis 
(BEA) in the United States have increased their efforts over the years so that 
economists and policymakers might better understand the extent of the phe-
nomenon and the reasons behind it.
Table 4.5 shows two pictures of U.S. multinational corporations, one in 1989 
and the other in 2013. The table shows the percent of multinational activities 
that are performed off-shore, through a foreign affiliate. Value added is a mea-
sure of the total value of production minus the value of purchased intermedi-
ate inputs. Capital expenditures include machines, laboratories, and buildings, 
and employment is the number of workers. As shown in the table, the share of 
multinationals’ value added created abroad rose from 23 percent in 1989 to 28.5 
percent in 2013. Employment grew from 21 percent of total workers off-shore 
in 1989 to 34.7 percent in 2013.

Migration and Trade
According to the Migration Policy Institute and the World Bank, in 2013 there 
were more than 231 million international migrants spread across the globe. Nearly 
two-thirds were living in high-income countries, and almost 20 percent were in the 
United States alone. In our presentation of the HO model, international migration 
was not taken into account. Workers are allowed to move between sectors in the 
model, but not between countries. This is an important consideration since interna-
tional migration alters the labor endowments that the model assumes to be fixed.
Economists have long studied migration, as have sociologists, demographers, 
political scientists, and other social scientists. Each discipline brings its own tools 
of analysis and contributes another piece to our understanding of the determi-
nants and effects of migration. Sociologists and anthropologists, for example, have 
helped to clarify that the decision to migrate is often a family decision or, in some 
cases, a community decision to send one of its members abroad. Political scientists 
have helped to clarify how migration policies are set and enforced, or not enforced, 
As shown in the OLI model, several factors motivate firms to locate off-
shore or to move some of their production there. Most importantly, firms 
locate production off-shore in order to obtain access to a market and to pro-
duce specialized products that fit a particular market’s need. This finding runs 
counter to the conventional wisdom that says that firms locate abroad in order 
to find low wages or to escape environmental or labor regulations. The con-
ventional wisdom is not wrong, but describes a minority of off-shoring since 
two-thirds is in high-income, high-wage economies.
Most production abroad by U.S.-controlled firms is primarily for serving 
foreign markets and not the U.S. market. The vast majority of the production 
of U.S.-owned affiliates is sold in the host country of the affiliate, while about 
one-third is exported to another foreign market. Less than 5 percent of their 
production was exported back to the United States in 2013. These patterns 
are largely determined by economies of scale and transportation costs: Firms 
find it cost effective to locate production next to the market where they intend 
to sell their products. Labor costs, like all costs of production, are important, 
but they are often outweighed by transportation costs and considerations of 
infrastructure and efficiency. Some firms do indeed move in order to find lower 
wages and to cut production costs, but that is less common than supposed and 
is far from the primary consideration of firms that off-shore.
Note that off-shoring is only one mechanism through which the interna-
tional economy affects wages and jobs in the domestic economy. Firms might 
also choose to off-shore and outsource, so that imported goods are not pro-
duced by a foreign affiliate. That situation would not show up in the statistics 
in this case study.

Part 2    International Trade
as the case may be. The economic view of migration tends to understand it in 
terms of the individual migrant and the underlying incentives to migrate. In this 
view, economic incentives play a major role by determining the factors that cause 
migrants to leave and the factors that attract them to a particular destination.
Economists refer to supply-push factors as the forces inside a country that cause 
people to think about leaving. Push factors include recessions, long-run structural 
changes that cause job dislocations, wars, natural disasters, and anything else that 
makes life difficult at home. Examples of structural changes include the transfor-
mations of Central European economies from socialism to capitalism, or Latin 
American economic reforms, or industrial development in Asia and Africa. In the 
near future, we can expect large migrations from changing agricultural patterns 
and the inundation of coastal areas as a result of climate change.
Demand-pull factors are the forces that pull migrants to a particular country or 
place within a country. Key factors include the cost of reaching a particular desti-
nation, the probability of finding a job, and the wage that will be earned. The wage 
gap between developed countries and developing countries explains a large share 
of the flow of migrants, but other factors are important as well. The business cycle 
in the receiving country, its migration policies, and the overall set of opportunities 
encountered by foreign workers are all important demand-pull factors.
A third factor determining migration is the existence of social networks. 
Migrants do not scatter randomly around a desirable destination, but instead con-
gregate in certain places. This is partly due to job opportunities, but it also reflects 
the fact that migration is hard and expensive and the presence of family or com-
munity members makes it a little easier. The supply of information about the new 
locale is better if there are already migrants who can report home on conditions, 
and who can help newcomers become established with a place to live, a job, and 
familiar faces to ward off loneliness.
In theory, if the endowment of a particular factor increases, then the relative 
abundance of the factor and, potentially, its comparative advantage also change. In 
practice, labor inflows are often used to produce services that are not traded. For 
example, two countries with large percentages of foreigners in their population are 
Qatar (86.5 percent of residents are immigrants) and the United Arab Emirates 
(70.0 percent of residents are immigrants). A large share of the foreign workers 
in those countries are Filipinos, Palestinians, and other migrants who work as 
domestics, providing cleaning, cooking, day care, and other services that cannot be 
traded. These migrants do not have a direct impact on the host country’s compara-
tive advantage since the labor is not used to produce tradable goods (although they 
free up citizens to work in the export sector). However, many migrant workers 
are also engineers and business specialists who provide technical expertise to the 
oil and gas industry. Without some high-skilled migrant labor, it is possible that 
production in these oil- and gas-producing countries would be much more limited.
Most international migration is from developing to developed countries. 
For example, in the 1980s and 1990s, civil wars in Central America produced 
large outflows of Salvadorian and Guatemalan immigrants to the United States, 
many of whom settled in California where some found employment in apparel 

Chapter  4     Comparative Advantage and Factor Endowments 
111
manufacturing. California’s apparel sector added over 40,000 jobs between 1983 
and 1997 (a growth of almost 50 percent), largely based on the availability of 
low-wage, unskilled immigrant workers. Given that apparel is a declining sec-
tor in the United States, immigrant labor appears to have postponed the decline 
of the industry in California for about a decade. Other U.S. examples of where 
immigration influences comparative advantage include certain agricultural crops 
that depend on abundant supplies of immigrant labor and the tourism industry. In 
these cases, increases in the supply of unskilled labor shifted production towards 
industries that intensely use that factor of production.
THE IMPACT OF TRADE ON WAGES AND JOBS
LO 4.6	 Describe the controversies surrounding the impact of international 
trade on wages and jobs.
Manufacturing in North America and Europe has struggled for decades. As a 
share of GDP and as a share of overall employment, it has been on a long, down-
ward trend. At the same time, wage inequality has increased, rather slowly at first, 
then more rapidly in the 1980s. Wage inequality has been particularly severe in the 
United States and has primarily affected younger workers and workers with less 
education or fewer skills. These trends in manufacturing employment and wages 
raise a couple of questions about trade. Are industrialized countries losing jobs 
to developing countries? Does trade with low-wage countries cause wages to fall 
in high-wage countries?
Economic theory offers insight into the issue of the overall number of jobs 
in the economy. In the medium-run and long-run, the absolute number of jobs 
depends mainly on factors such as the age and size of the population, labor market 
policies, and the business cycle. While trade may have a short-run effect as well, 
particularly if firms cannot compete against imports, or if sudden opportunities 
for export expansion appear, these impacts are outweighed by macroeconomic 
policies affecting the entire domestic economy over the medium and long runs. 
By comparison, changes in trade flows usually affect one or two manufacturing 
industries and a small share of overall GDP.
While trade is not the main determinant of the number of jobs in most econo-
mies, it might affect the kinds of jobs or the sectors of the economy where jobs 
are available. For example, manufacturing employment in the United States and 
most high-income countries has been falling for quite awhile. Throughout the 
1980s and 1990s, most economists thought that the reductions in manufactur-
ing employment in all industrial countries resulted from productivity gains, not 
trade. Manufacturing is easier to automate than services and as a consequence has 
much faster rates of productivity growth than services. Many services, on the other 
hand, have stagnant or very slow rates of productivity growth. Often, the same 
number of workers is required today as a century ago; one haircut, for example, 
still takes one barber, and modern musicians are no more “productive” at playing 

112
Part 2    International Trade
Bach’s Brandenburg Concertos than they were in the 1700s. When incomes rise, 
we consume more services and more manufactured goods, but because the ser-
vices require more-or-less the same number of workers per unit of output, and 
manufactured goods can be made with fewer workers per unit, a growing share of 
our total employment ends up in services.
More recently, some economists have seriously questioned the idea that manu-
facturing is shrinking because productivity in that sector is increasing more rap-
idly. For example, an influential study has shown that communities in the United 
States that have industries that compete with Chinese-made products, have expe-
rienced a number of negative effects, including higher unemployment rates, lower 
labor force participation, and reduced wages. The authors of the study believe 
that exposure to competition with China may explain as much as one-fourth of 
the overall decline in manufacturing employment in the United States. Another 
influential study by a Nobel Prize winning economist and his co-author, points out 
that nearly all of the growth in the number of jobs has been in services and other 
sectors that do not produce tradable goods. They argue that many U.S. businesses 
have outsourced their inputs to firms in foreign countries so that middle-skill man-
ufacturing is disappearing while very high-skill manufacturing jobs remain. Both 
of these studies support the idea that trade may have changed the composition of 
jobs in the United States in a way that does not favor manufacturing, even if the 
total number of jobs in all other sectors of the economy has grown significantly.
The second issue concerns the impact of trade with less-developed countries 
(LDCs) on the wages of workers in the advanced industrial economies. This ques-
tion has been studied by many economists, and the general consensus until rela-
tively recently was that trade may have caused some of the decline in wages for 
the less skilled (and, hence, some of the increase in wage inequality), but it was 
responsible for only a small share of the overall changes. Most economists thought 
that technological changes that reduced the role of unskilled and semiskilled labor 
in manufacturing were the primary causes of the increasing gap in wages between 
the skilled and the unskilled. In the late 1990s, however, the gap in wages between 
the skilled and unskilled stopped increasing and after approximately 2000, every-
one’s wages stagnated except the top 1 percent of the income distribution.
The consensus among economists is that there is no consensus about the impact 
of trade on wages. We know that export industries tend to pay more, but we do 
not know if trade is responsible for the stagnation in wages, or if it is but one of 
many factors, or perhaps has no impact at all on wages. This is an area of very 
active research as economists try to understand how trade might cause the wage 
stagnation and decline that we observe in many parts of the U.S. economy. If trade 
has played a far larger role in the growth of wage inequality or wage stagnation 
than is generally recognized, then the policy conclusions about trade are not likely 
to change much. In either case, where trade is responsible for inequality or lower 
wages and where it is not, there is a need for education and training programs 
targeted at the less skilled. Chapters 6 and 7 will show that blocking trade to pro-
tect jobs is extraordinarily expensive, and doing so to protect wages could make 
things worse in the long run.

Do Trade Statistics Give a Distorted Picture of 
Trade Relations? The Case of the iPhone 3G
Off-shoring enables firms to cut-up their production chain and move differ-
ent parts of the production process to different global locations. We know 
that car parts come from around the globe and any vehicle labeled “Made in 
America” or any other country is likely to have components from a wide range 
of countries. Modern production processes span the globe, particularly when 
we examine sophisticated high technology products. Firms find it advantageous 
to off-shore and to outsource different pieces of the production process, and 
then bring the parts together for assembly in a completely different country. 
The iPhone is a case in point.
A 2009 investigation of the cost of components for an iPhone 3G revealed 
that four countries produced the majority of the value of the phone: Japan, 
Korea, Germany, and the United States. Since Apple is not a manufacturer, 
it outsources all of its production and off-shores a large part as well. When 
assembled, the cost of assembly and of materials for the iPhone3 was $178.96. 
This price is not the retail price since it does not include additional costs such 
as marketing, royalties, transportation, and insurance, and it omits the dealer 
mark-up. The $178.96 price tag can be thought of as the price of the materials 
and components that go into the iPhone, plus assembly costs. China’s contribu-
tion to the value added is $6.50, which is the value of the assembly of compo-
nents coming from Japan, Korea, Germany, and the United States. After the 
iPhone is assembled, it is ready for shipping. If it is sold in the United States, 
then U.S. import statistics will record a $178.96 import from China (not count-
ing insurance and transportation). The U.S.’ contribution to the cell phone’s 
manufacture was $10.75, so trade statistics will record the iPhone 3G as a net 
deficit for the U.S., equal to $178.96 minus $10.75, or $168.21. This is odd if 
you consider that China’s contribution to the iPhone’s manufacture was only 
$6.50. If we re-examine the situation by looking only at value added in each 
country, the U.S. “iPhone trade balance with China” was actually in surplus: 
$10.75 minus $6.50 or $4.25. Correspondingly, U.S. actual trade deficits with 
Japan, Korea, and Germany are larger than official statistics indicate since most 
of its value was created in Japan (33 percent), Germany (17 percent), Korea 
(13 percent), and a host of other countries.
Analysis of China’s production reveals systematic patterns in the share of 
export value added created in China. The WTO estimates that 32 percent of 
the value of China’s exports was value created outside China in 2011, but the 
pattern varies by industry. Exports of goods produced with large amounts of 
unskilled and semiskilled labor such as apparel, footwear, or toys, have most

Summary
■
■The Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) model hypothesizes that comparative advantage 
is based on national differences in factor endowments. Countries export 
goods that have production requirements that are intensive in the nation’s 
relatively abundant factors. They import goods that require intensive input 
from the nation’s relatively scarce factors.
■
■The HO model has implications for the income distribution effects of trade. 
The opening of trade favors the abundant factor and reduces the use of the 
scarce factor. Consequently, the income or returns earned by the abundant 
factor rises, while it falls for the scarce factor. A corollary to the HO model, 
called the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, describes these effects.
■
■In the specific factors model, some factors of production are assumed to be 
immobile between different outputs. Consequently, when trade expands the 
production of a good, the specific factor used to produce it experiences a 
rise in the demand for its services and an increase in its income. The specific 
factor used to produce the imported good experiences a fall in the demand 
for its services, and its income declines. The specific factors model can be 
viewed as a short- to medium-run version of the HO model.
■
■Empirical tests of the theory of comparative advantage give mixed results. 
While underlying productivity differences explain a significant share of trade, 
of their value added from Chinese inputs of labor and capital, while exports 
of sophisticated electronics draw much more of their value from outside the 
country. Looking at many countries worldwide, natural resource products like 
oil or iron ore are almost entirely produced in the exporting country, while 
final products with many parts, such as consumer electronics or automobiles, 
are more likely to be produced in many countries, leaving the final exporter of 
the finished product with a smaller share of the overall value creation.
Some economists, including a previous Director General of the WTO, think 
that this type of mis-characterization of trade flows inadvertently contributes 
to greater trade tensions. Accordingly, the WTO began an initiative some years 
ago to measure trade flows in terms of value added rather than total value 
in the hopes that this would bring greater clarity to the actual source of the 
value of exports, and help reduce trade tensions between low-wage export-
ing countries and high-wage importing ones. Additional reasons for trying to 
understand which countries contribute to the production of a product are that 
it tells us whether firms in developing countries are participating in the value 
chains of multinational companies, and whether they are moving up into areas 
of increasing technological sophistication.

■Several alternative trade models have been hypothesized. Most are elabora-
tions of the theory of comparative advantage. Two of the most popular alter-
native trade theories are the theory of the product cycle and the theory of 
intrafirm trade. The product cycle focuses on the speed of technological change 
and the life history of many manufactured items through periods of innovation, 
stabilization, and standardization. The theory of intrafirm trade allows a role 
for comparative advantage but also has industrial organization elements. It is 
impossible to state a general rule about the determinants of intrafirm trade.
■
■Off-shoring is the movement of some or all of a firm’s activities to another 
country. Outsourcing is the reassignment of activities to another firm, in 
either a domestic or a foreign location. Off-shoring has been advanced by 
the telecommunications revolution and is a relatively new phenomenon. 
Nevertheless, traditional trade models are useful in its analysis.
■
■International migration can alter a country’s comparative advantage, 
although in practice most countries do not receive enough migrants or a suf-
ficiently long enough flow of migrants to cause long-run changes. Migrants 
are motivated by supply-push factors in their home country, demand-pull 
factors in the receiving country, and social networks that provide informa-
tion and resources for settling in the new country.
■
■In the medium to long run, trade has little or no effect on the total number 
of jobs in a country. The abundance or scarcity of jobs is a function of labor 
market policies, incentives to work, and the macroeconomic policies of the 
central bank and government. In the short run, trade may reduce jobs in an 
industry that suffers a loss in its competitiveness, just as it may increase jobs 
in an industry with growing competitiveness. Trade may also affect the kinds 
of jobs and the economic sectors that grow or shrink.
■
■There is no consensus among economists about the impact of trade on 
wages. Recent research seems to point toward the possibility trade plays 
some role in the pattern of wage stagnation and the decline of recent years, 
but it is uncertain if its role is direct or indirect, and if it is large or small. This 
question is not settled and is an area of very active research.

INTRODUCTION: MORE REASONS TO TRADE
Comparative advantage is the foundation of our understanding of the gains from trade 
and the potential income distribution effects of trade. Unfortunately, trade models built 
exclusively on the idea of comparative advantage have a mixed record when it comes to 
predicting a country’s trade patterns. This is an important failure since we tend to think 
that if we accurately measure a country’s comparative advantage we should be able 
to predict import and export patterns. The problem, however, is that it is exceedingly 
difficult to precisely measure a country’s comparative advantage. This problem is com-
pounded by the fact that there are many potential products an economy might export 
that use the same comparative advantage, and there is no way to determine which spe-
cific products will dominate. Furthermore, and perhaps most seriously, a large share of 
international trade is not based on comparative advantage. This chapter takes up two 
important exceptions to the models of the previous chapters, and examines how and 
why many countries try to select and plan the development of their export industries.
The first section of this chapter explains why an important share of world trade 
consists of countries exporting the same thing they import. Canada and the United 
States, for example, have the largest trade relationship in the world, and a large share 
of it consists of exporting cars and car parts to each other. This pattern is clearly at odds 
with the bread-for-steel examples shown in Chapters 3 and 4. In the second section of 
the chapter, we examine industrial clustering. Many traded goods and services that are

and movies) largely reflects the output of a handful of regions such as Hollywood 
and Nashville. Software reflects clusters in Silicon Valley, Seattle, and a few other 
spots; biotechnology is in San Francisco, San Diego, and a handful of other places. 
Surprisingly, international trade can play an important role in this type of clustering 
and may, under certain conditions, prevent new clusters from forming.
The issue of regional clusters leads directly into a discussion of industrial policies 
in the third section of the chapter. Industrial policies are used to address the chal-
lenge of trying to plan an advantage in a particular industry or a group of products. 
Can countries pick the items they will export and successfully build a strong export 
industry? What are the costs and benefits of the policies they follow? Basically, 
we are asking how nations can use policies to shape their economic development.

The models of comparative advantage  developed in Chapters 3 and 4 are 
built on the foundation of country differences. In those models, differences in 
­productivity (Chapter 3) or factor endowments (Chapter 4) enable countries to 
raise their living standards by specializing their production and trading. The point 
of these models is not to paint a detailed portrait of economic life, but rather to 
create a simplified abstract model of the economy that focuses on key economic 
relations in the area of trade. To that end, unnecessary details are omitted, and 
rare or exceptional cases are ignored.
Sometimes rare or exceptional cases become more important over time. 
An example of this phenomenon is the increasing importance of intraindustry 
trade (the prefix “intra” means within). Intraindustry trade is the international 
trade of products made within the same industry, for example steel-for-steel or 
bread-for-bread. The opposite of intraindustry trade is interindustry trade (the 
prefix “inter” means between). Interindustry trade is international trade of prod-
ucts between two different industries (for example, bread-for-steel). The growing 
importance of intraindustry trade has forced economists to develop new models to 
explain why countries often export the same goods they import, and the benefits 
from this type of trade.

Part 2    International Trade
Characteristics of Intraindustry Trade
Intraindustry trade between industrial countries is common. Empirical measures 
of the importance of intraindustry trade vary, however, because of the funda-
mental problem of defining an industry. For example, if computers are defined as 
office machinery, then computers and pencil sharpeners are in the same industry, 
and a country that exports computers and imports pencil sharpeners would engage 
in intraindustry trade. In general, the more broadly an industry is defined, the 
more trade appears to be intraindustry. Conversely, the more detailed the defini-
tion, the less trade is defined as intraindustry. Evidence suggests that intraindus-
try trade is greater in high-technology industries (where there is more scope for 
product differentiation), in countries that are more open to trade, and in nations 
that have received larger amounts of foreign direct investment.
In the models of comparative advantage–based trade presented in Chapters 3 
and 4, production costs are either constant (Chapter 3) or increasing (Chapter 4). 
Accordingly, each additional unit of bread produced led to the loss of a fixed or 
increasing amount of steel. The production of many goods, however, is character-
ized by economies of scale, or decreasing costs, over a relatively large range of 
output. The creation of new models of international trade based on economies 
of scale is one of the newest and most significant developments in trade theory 
over the last several decades and has increased our understanding of intraindus-
try trade. In the economics literature, this body of work is known as New Trade 
Theory, since it moves beyond traditional trade theory based on models with 
constant returns or decreasing returns to scale.
In New Trade Theory, economies of scale can be either internal economies 
of scale or external economies of scale. Internal economies are defined as fall-
ing average costs over a relatively large range of output. In practice, this leads to 
larger firms because size confers a competitive advantage in the form of lower 
average costs. One of the distinguishing features of intraindustry trade is the pres-
ence of internal economies of scale.
Table 5.1 illustrates a firm’s cost structure when it experiences increasing 
returns to scale. Typically, there is a threshold level of production above which the 
average cost per good begins to increase rather than continuing to fall. Increasing 
returns are usually based on the inherent development, engineering, or market-
ing aspects of production and are associated with products that have a large fixed 
cost component. Car companies, software, and popular household brand name 
products, to name a few, tend to have large fixed costs. These occur for various 
reasons, such as the cost of constructing a large production plant, large R&D 
budgets, or large marketing expenditures. Software, for example, requires large 
up-front expenditures on R&D to develop a product, and the more units a firm 
can sell, the more it can spread out those fixed R&D costs.
Internal economies of scale have important implications for the type of market 
that prevails. In Chapters 3 and 4, it is assumed that firms operate in competitive 
markets where no one firm can influence prices or overall industry output. When 
larger firms are more competitive, however, it reduces the number of firms in a 

Chapter  5     Beyond Comparative Advantage 
121
market and leads to one of several types of market structures. In an oligopoly, 
a handful of firms produce the entire market output. In this case, the pattern of 
production and trade is very difficult to predict because each firm uses predic-
tions about the actions of its competitors as it formulates its own profit-maximizing 
­strategy. This type of response means that each firm alters its output level as it 
sees what its competitors are doing, and production levels and trade become less 
predictable.
Often, internal economies lead to the relatively common market structure 
called monopolistic competition. Recall that in a pure monopoly, one firm pro-
duces the entire industry output. In monopolistic competition, there is competition 
among many firms, but their competition is attenuated by the practice of product 
differentiation. With product differentiation, each firm produces a slightly differ-
ent product. This gives rise to the monopoly element of monopolistic competition, 
in that each firm is the sole producer of its products. For example, only Ford can 
sell the Ford Focus. Unlike a pure monopoly, however, every other firm produces 
a close substitute, and this introduces a real element of competition.
In monopolistic competition, the level of competition among firms increases 
whenever new firms enter the market. This has two effects. On the one hand, 
heightened competition will lead to lower prices because products are substitutes 
for each other and in the struggle to capture sales, downward pressure is placed 
on prices. On the other hand, when more firms divide the market, each firm sells 
fewer units of output on average, and so costs rise. This follows directly from the 
internal economies of each firm. As long as prices are above costs, more firms will 
enter the market, and whenever prices are below costs, firms exit.
The presence of internal economies of scale is the reason why firms want to 
enter export markets. Any firm that exports has a competitive advantage since it 
will have higher sales and be able to take advantage of the cost-reducing effects 
of its internal economies of scale. For any given number of firms, average costs 
are lower in a larger market. This follows from the economies of scale that each 
firm experiences and the fact that if the number of firms is held constant, each 
firm sells more as the size of the market expands.

As production increases, total costs rise, but the cost per unit falls. Bigger firms are more effi-
cient than smaller firms.

Figure 5.1 illustrates the relationship between (1) the number of firms in the 
industry, (2) average costs, and (3) output prices. The horizontal axis measures 
the number of firms in the industry, while the vertical axis measures average cost 
and price. Line segment P shows the relationship between the number of firms 
and prices. It slopes downward to the right because more firms entering the mar-
ket put downward pressure on prices. Line segment AC shows the relationship 
between the average cost for each individual firm and the total number of firms in 
the market. It slopes upward because as more firms enter the market, the quantity 
each existing firm sells is reduced and the average cost of production increases. 
At prices above P1, new firms have an incentive to enter the market since price 
exceeds average cost. At prices below P1, just the opposite occurs and some firms 
will leave the market because their costs are greater than the market price.
Figure 5.1 also makes obvious the reason why firms want to export. Any firm 
that exports is at a competitive advantage since it will have the greater sales it 
needs to drive down its costs. This idea is illustrated in Figure 5.2, where the alter-
native cost curve, AC*, is identical to AC except that it belongs to a larger market. 
For any given number of firms, AC* shows that average costs are lower in a larger 
market. This follows from the economies of scale that each firm experiences and 
the fact that if the number of firms is held constant, each firm sells more when the 
size of the market expands.
The Gains from Intraindustry Trade
Intraindustry trade also creates gains from trade. While the increased size of the 
market leads to lower costs through the effect of scale economies, competition 
among firms forces them to pass on their lower costs to consumers in the form of 
FIGURE 5.1  Monopolistic Competition

123
lower prices. Lower prices for exports and imports stands in marked contrast to 
the case of comparative advantage-based trade. Recall that in the trade models 
of Chapters 3 and 4, each country’s consumers benefit from a reduction in the 
price of the good it imports, but at the same time, the price of the export rises. 
With intraindustry trade, however, prices for both imports and exports decline, 
leading to unambiguous benefits for consumers in both countries. Trade enables 
firms to produce for a larger market and at a higher level of efficiency. That raises 
everyone’s real income through the reduction in prices.
The expansion of the market that occurs with trade ultimately leads to an 
increase in the number of firms. This follows from the fact that exports costs 
are below the selling price, and new firms are attracted into the market until 
excess profits are competed away. While it is safe to say that the combined for-
eign and domestic industry will expand, the location of the expansion is indeter-
minate and depends on the individual firm characteristics. Some firms may be 
more efficient than others and a larger market via international trade will give 
them an opportunity to expand their production. Less efficient firms are likely to 
suffer from the increased competition, but there is no way to predict if they are 
mostly ­home-grown firms or foreign firms. Hence, there is no way to determine 
in advance which firms survive and expand and which ones fall by the wayside.
In addition to lower prices (higher real income) and the potential expansion of 
production, another benefit from intraindustry trade is that it increases consumer 
choices. Without trade, consumers are limited to the goods produced in the domes-
tic market. This is not necessarily a limitation for some people, but a scan of the 
highways should be enough to convince anyone that many consumers prefer for-
eign-made goods over their domestic substitutes. The value of added choices is not 
easy to measure in dollar terms, but it is clearly a significant benefit for most people.

United States and Canada Trade
In 1965, the United States and Canada implemented a free-trade policy that 
covered autos and auto parts. The results were dramatic, particularly on the 
Canadian side of the border. Before the Auto Pact, Canada required most cars 
sold domestically to be made inside the country. The relatively small market 
in Canada meant that only a few different car models were produced, each 
in small batches that cost more to make since automakers could not take full 
advantage of economies of scale in production. After the Auto Pact, automak-
ers refocused production on a smaller number of models that were produced 
for the combined Canadian and U.S. market. Canadian productivity in the 
automobile industry rose dramatically as the scale of production increased. In 
addition, as imports from the United States increased, Canadian consumers had 
many more models from which to choose.
The automobile industry integrated production in the United States and 
Canada completely. Trade between the two countries rose dramatically and 
eventually grew into the largest bilateral trade relationship of any two countries 
in the world. Table 5.2 illustrates the importance of intraindustry trade.
Three of the top five U.S. exports, and two of the top five imports, are motor 
vehicles or related products. In terms of value, an overwhelming share of the 
top five exports and imports are car related. Clearly, intraindustry trade is 
fundamental to the U.S.-Canadian trade pattern.
Note that the top five U.S. imports include three Canadian exports that take 
advantage of its natural resource endowment. This part of the trade relation-
ship illustrates comparative advantage–based trade built around differing factor 
endowments. As a result, U.S.-Canadian trade is partly intraindustry, partly 
interindustry comparative advantage–based.

TRADE AND GEOGRAPHY
LO 5.5	 Explain how transportation costs and internal economies of scale help 
determine firm location decisions.
Paul Krugman, winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics, has stated that inter-
national trade is really about geography and the decision every firm must make 
about the location of its activities. Produce at home or abroad? If abroad, then in 
which country? If at home, in what part of the country? Produce close to a city, 
or in the countryside where land is cheaper? In many cases the choices are obvi-
ous, and the factors that make them obvious are related to the characteristics of a 
particular place. For example, availability of labor or energy resources, or prox-
imity to a market or specialized input suppliers may determine a firm’s choices. 
Geography, which is the study of the characteristics of places, is an important 
consideration for firms, and in turn has significant effects on trade.
Trade and geography are linked in two fundamental ways. First, a place such 
as a major city may pull in economic activity because it is a large market. Second, 
a place may offer firms the opportunity to find critical inputs, including skilled 
labor, and to stay abreast of current developments. For both of these reasons, on 
the output side and the input side the characteristics of places are an important 
part of firm decision making. As a result, geography plays a key role in some trade.
Geography, Transportation Costs, and Internal Economics 
of Scale
For most manufactured goods, it is not practical to produce next to each market 
because there are economies of scale. For example, it would not make sense to 
locate car assembly firms next to every car dealership. Production would be at too 
small a scale, and costs would be extremely high. Instead, car production tends 
to be concentrated in a few areas, and the final product is shipped to the markets 
where it is sold. As a result, there are significant transportation costs, both in 
bringing in the parts that are assembled into the final car and in shipping the car 
to its final market. Accordingly, car companies think carefully about the location 
of their activities and try to mitigate their high transportation costs by locating 
near their markets.
Not all types of manufacturing have the same level of transportation costs, and 
services have few or none, but to one degree or another, the cost of bringing parts 
to the assembler and then shipping the final product to market are important con-
siderations for many firms. If there were no internal economies of scale, it would 
be possible to locate production next to the market where the good will be sold, 
but the presence of scale economies makes that impractical for most production. 
Milk and eggs tend to be produced locally because there are more limited scale 
economies and higher transportation costs, while aircraft are highly concentrated 
in their production because there are large scale economies and relatively smaller 
transportation costs.

126
Part 2    International Trade
Transportation costs and scale economies are characteristics of manufacturing 
that help explain several patterns observed in the global economy. For example, it 
was noted in Chapter 4 that most foreign investment in the world today is directed 
toward high-income countries, not toward developing countries. Largely this is 
because high-income countries have larger markets, and firms find it convenient 
to locate next to the market. All other factors being equal, the lower transporta-
tion costs often outweigh other costs that might be higher. It also explains the 
southward shift of U.S. car manufacturing in the 1990s, as firms in Michigan and 
Ohio moved to Texas in order to be closer to the new final assemblers springing 
up in Mexico. The cost of transporting the many parts that are assembled into a 
car or truck requires that assemblers and parts suppliers be in close proximity to 
one another.
C A S E  S T U D Y
The Shifting Geography of Mexico’s 
Manufacturing
Approximately two-thirds of the trade between the United States and Mexico 
is intrafirm. Most of this occurs within the context of Mexico’s special export 
processing sector, called the maquiladora industry. Originally limited to its 
border with the United States but later expanded to the whole country, the 
maquiladora industry began in 1965. The original purpose of the government 
was to generate employment along Mexico’s northern border. In the long run, 
the maquiladora industry became a major source of manufacturing activity, a 
major employer, and one of the country’s main sources of exports.
The maquiladora industry is an example of an export processing zone 
(EPZ). In EPZs, both domestic and foreign firms produce goods for export 
without paying tariffs on the parts and materials they import. This allows firms 
such as General Motors and Sony to set up in Mexico and pay no tariffs on the 
inputs they bring into the country from abroad, as long as they export the out-
put. (Note that the rules for maquiladoras changed under NAFTA and export 
requirements are no longer in place.)
The number of firms in the export processing industry grew slowly but 
steadily, and by 1980, fifteen years after the initial legislation, there were 620 
plants with 120,000 workers. Nevertheless, the export processing industry was 
an exception to the dominant trend in Mexico, as manufacturing remained 
firmly focused on production for the domestic market. Until the middle of 
the 1980s, Mexico’s development strategy was inward looking, and most firms 
found that it was less profitable to export than to produce for the home market 
since goods sold domestically were protected from competition and goods sold 
abroad were not.

Chapter  5     Beyond Comparative Advantage 
127
External Economies of Scale
External economies of scale occur when firms become more productive as the 
number of firms in the industry increases, but individual firms may or may not 
have an economic incentive to increase in size. External economies may occur 
for several reasons. First, if the firms in a region produce similar products, there 
are likely to be knowledge spillovers that help keep all firms abreast of the lat-
est technology and newest developments. Close physical proximity enhances 
­knowledge spillovers because it creates more opportunities for information 
exchange through formal and informal networks of people. Regional industry 
associations can be important, but so can soccer teams, churches, Girl Scouts, and 
other civic organizations that bring together people who work in different firms. 
Knowledge spillovers are particularly important in frontier industries undergoing 
In 1982, a financial crisis struck Mexico and policymakers began to rethink the 
country’s development model. Until then, the focus on production for the domes-
tic market caused most firms to locate near Mexico City or one or two other 
major urban areas such as Monterrey or Guadalajara. The choice of locations 
reduced their transportation costs by locating production near their final market, 
and allowed them to take advantage of their internal economies of scale since 
they operated out of only one or a few plants. In an unforeseen way, Mexico’s 
development model during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s caused Mexico City to 
grow into one of the world’s largest cities and resulted in a very high proportion 
of the population becoming concentrated in the country’s largest urban centers.
In the middle of the 1980s, Mexican policymakers shifted toward a more 
neutral policy with respect to production for domestic or foreign markets. They 
did this by removing many of the tariffs and other protections that had kept 
domestic firms free from foreign competition. By reducing and in some cases 
eliminating tariffs and other measures that limited imports, policymakers cre-
ated a more level playing field for exports producers. In effect, this made it 
relatively more profitable to produce goods for sale in foreign markets since it 
took away the advantages of producing for the domestic market.
Partly as a consequence of these policy changes, the export processing indus-
try along Mexico’s northern border took off. By the middle of 2000, the maquila-
dora industry employed more than 1.3 million workers in more than 3,700 firms 
and was responsible for more than half of Mexico’s total exports. The maqui-
ladora industry grew rapidly because the new incentives caused both Mexican 
and non-Mexican firms to locate near the border with the United States, rather 
than in Mexico City. Under the new rules, the largest profitable market is the 
United States rather than Mexico City. Given internal economies of scale and 
transportation costs, location as close as possible to the U.S. market made a 
great deal of sense, and cities on Mexico’s northern border, such as Tijuana, 
Ciudad Juarez, and others, began to grow rapidly almost a decade before the 
free-trade agreement between the United States, Mexico, and Canada.

128
Part 2    International Trade
rapid technological change, and they seem to be very sensitive to the face-to-face 
contact that is impaired by geographical distance.
A second form of external economies of scale occurs when the presence of a 
large number of producers in one area helps to create a deep labor market for 
specialized skills. If an industry is large enough to attract a steady stream of poten-
tial employees with specialized skills, it reduces the search costs of firms and also 
offers them the best available skills. This advantage is particularly important in 
industries that demand highly technical or scarce skills.
A third potential advantage to a large geographical concentration is that it 
can lead to a dense network of input suppliers. Manufacturers of intermediate 
inputs prefer to locate near the market for their products since it holds down 
transportation costs and may keep them better informed. In high-tech sectors, a 
large number of nearby supplier firms will lower the cost of finding a producer 
of a specialized input and will also create a wider and deeper selection of input 
goods and services. All of these effects hold down producer costs. The linkage 
from producers back to their suppliers can also occur in the other direction. If the 
concentrated industry manufactures intermediate goods or services, it may attract 
firms that use its products to make a final good or service. This gives firms more 
information about their market and may also lead to closer collaboration between 
suppliers and purchasers of intermediate inputs.
Trade and External Economies
One of the essential features of geographical concentration is that it is self-rein-
forcing. For example, as firms attract skilled workers or specialized input sup-
pliers, the increased availability of high-quality inputs creates feedback leading 
to more firms in the same industry locating in the area. In turn, this leads to a 
stronger pull for workers and input suppliers. In effect, each of the elements acts 
on each other to propel the system forward.
One implication of these features is that small differences in initial conditions 
may lead to large differences in outcome. That is, a region with a small head start 
or other small initial advantage in attracting firms may develop significant scale 
economies before other regions. Once the scale advantages become significant, 
the gap between the lead region and its competitors can widen, and may turn into 
a permanent competitive advantage. The source of the initial advantage can be 
anything, including historical accidents. For example, during World War II, as jet 
engines were being developed in Great Britain, the Allies decided to locate pro-
duction in the United States on the West Coast, minimizing the probability that the 
Axis powers could destroy the factories with air raids. Ultimately, this led to a sup-
plier industry around the major jet aircraft manufacturers (Boeing, Lockheed, and 
McDonnell-Douglas), and helped in the development of specialized labor skills 
such as aerospace engineering. As a result of a historical accident and the Allies’ 
decisions during the war, the United States dominated the commercial jet aircraft

industry for several decades, until a consortium of European governments used 
large subsidies and other interventions to foster a European competitor, Airbus.
Once the U.S. lead was established, other countries with essentially the same 
technological ability as the United States could never catch up, even though in the-
ory they had the capacity to achieve the same level of efficiency. The development 
of U.S. regional agglomerations (for example, the concentration of specialized 
aerospace manufacturing firms in the Seattle and Southern California regions) 
gave the United States a head start and a competitive advantage that could not be 
easily overcome. U.S. planes were always available at lower prices than a newer, 
less developed, industry could offer. In this instance, trade stifles the development 
of an industry that may be as competitive as existing producers.
In theory, trade could stifle the development of a new industry that is more 
efficient than the existing one. Suppose, for example, that Europeans are poten-
tially more efficient at making commercial aircraft than Americans. Their 
potential can only be realized, however, after a period of experimentation and 
development. The initial problem they face is that the efficiency advantage goes 
to the United States because of its better developed linkages between suppliers 
and producers. In this case, trade and the initial availability of U.S. planes at a 
lower cost remove the incentive for Europeans to invest in their industry and 
prevent the development of what might ultimately be a more efficient industry. 
As long as U.S. planes are available at a lower price than European planes, there 
is no economic reason why anyone would buy European, and the lack of an initial 
market for their planes guarantees the Europeans a period of financial losses, 
thereby discouraging investment. In effect, the historical accident of locating jet 
aircraft production in the United States in order to avoid Hitler’s bombers is 
locked in by trade.
The aircraft example is instructive because it illustrates a case in which trade 
may not be beneficial. In every other case we’ve examined so far, trade is ben-
eficial. Under the circumstances outlined earlier, however, it is potentially harm-
ful since it reduces global efficiency by concentrating world production in the 
less-efficient producer. The aircraft example also illustrates how small initial dif-
ferences can cascade into large differences in outcome and how with external 
economies, trade patterns can be a result of completely unpredictable accidents 
of history.
INDUSTRIAL POLICY
LO 5.6	 Present the pros and cons of industrial policies.
Faced with a more competitive U.S. aircraft industry, what can Europeans do 
to get their own industry off the ground? This was the question asked several 
decades ago by the governments of Britain, France, Germany, and Spain. Their 

130
Part 2    International Trade
answer was to pool the resources of their domestic aircraft and aerospace firms 
and to provide generous subsidies from the four governments to help the con-
sortium absorb the initial losses and to develop their own industry. The result 
was Airbus, the large European challenger to the U.S.-based Boeing company. 
The creation of Airbus is an example of governments using industrial policies to 
explicitly direct economic activity. As the name and example imply, industrial 
policies are government policies designed to create new industries or to support 
existing ones.
Not surprisingly, industrial policies are controversial; so much so, that recent 
international agreements limit the scope of action that countries can take to sup-
port their industries. In some cases, they end up wasting large sums of money. 
­Brazil and Indonesia, for example, have used industrial policies to develop regional 
commercial jet aircraft industries, targeted at the 20- to 100-passenger plane mar-
ket. While Brazil has had commercial success (Embraer), the ­Indonesian indus-
try spent billions of dollars and used many engineers and other skilled workers 
whose talents could have been put to work developing the Indonesian economy. 
No doubt, comparative advantage can change, but was it counter-productive 
for Indonesia to try to speed along the development process by promoting a 
specific industry? How can a country know which industries to promote? Will 
doing so lead to better outcomes than simply providing the basic components of 
a ­well-functioning economy, including education, stable institutions, and sound 
macroeconomic policies?
Industrial Policies and Market Failure
When the private market economy fails to deliver an optimal quantity of goods 
and services, it is called a market failure. An optimal quantity is one where the 
full value of the goods to private consumers and society is equal to its full cost 
of production. It follows that too little or too much of a good is a market failure. 
Market failures are a divergence between private returns and social returns. A fre-
quent cause of this divergence is that some of the costs or benefits of an activity 
are externalized, or outside the area of concern of the economic agents engaged 
in the activity. For obvious reasons, economists refer to the market failure that 
results from the externalization of costs or benefits as an externality. Externalities 
cause some of the costs or benefits of an action to go to people or firms other than 
those engaged in the economic activity. For example, a steel mill that pollutes a 
river imposes a cost on inhabitants downstream, and parents who vaccinate their 
children create a benefit for their neighbor’s children. In an accounting sense, the 
private returns are the cost and benefits to the steel mill or to the parents with 
the vaccinated child, while the social returns include the private costs or ben-
efits, but also take into account the costs and benefits to the rest of society—the 
downstream inhabitants or the neighbor’s children. Note that externalized costs 
or benefits do not mean that they disappear and are of no consequence. From 
an economic viewpoint, they are as important as any other costs or benefits even 
though they do not fall on the individuals or firms that created them.

There are two simple rules for analyzing cases of market failure. First, when 
social returns are greater than private returns, a free-market economy produces 
less than the optimal amount. This occurs because some of the benefits are cap-
tured by individuals or firms other than those that produce the benefits, so natu-
rally they do not consider the entire set of benefits when they decide how much to 
produce. The second rule is that when social returns are less than private returns, 
a free-market economy produces more than the optimal amount. In this case, 
economic agents do not take into account the costs that spill over onto others and 
that reduce the value to society of the good or service.
The divergence between private and social returns is shown in Figure 5.3. 
­Supply and demand are plotted for a competitively produced good that generates 
external benefits when it is produced. The supply curve Spriv is a normal market 
supply curve, embodying all of the private costs encountered by firms. It is labeled 
with the subscript “priv” to indicate that only the private costs, the costs paid by 
the firms producing the good, are taken into account. Since production entails 
some external benefits to members of the society (who are not specified in this 
model), we can offset some of the costs of production with the external benefits. 
These are subtracted from the supply curve to derive the social supply curve, Ssoc, 
which embodies the private costs minus the external benefits. The supply curve 
Ssoc is more comprehensive than Spriv since it takes into consideration all of the 
costs and benefits to society, not simply the private ones.
As can be seen in Figure 5.3, private markets lead to output Q1 at price P1. 
From the standpoint of the social optimum, however, the price is too high and the 
quantity is too low. The social optimum, at P2 and Q2, takes into account the costs 
and benefits that are external to the producing firms and their internal costs and

benefits. In effect, private agents earn less than the social return, which includes 
the external benefit that firms cannot capture. As a result, there is less than the 
socially optimal amount of investment in the activity generating the returns. For 
advocates of industrial policies, the solution is activist government intervention 
to increase the level of the desirable activity.
There are many reasons why social returns and private returns may differ. 
Knowledge spillovers are a common example and are often cited as a reason 
for industrial policies. In this case, the social return to the new knowledge is 
greater than the private return because some of the value of the knowledge 
spills over from the firm that created it into other firms. An important case 
of knowledge spillovers comes from the first entrant into a particular industry 
since they show others the possibilities in a new industry or market. A related 
knowledge spillover occurs in the area of research and development since firms 
that create new technologies often generate benefits for competitors who copy 
their breakthroughs, make slight improvements, and introduce a new product 
of their own.
Coordination problems are another source of divergence between social and 
private returns. Individual projects, for example, may require complementary 
actions by other firms. Chile’s successful development of a fruit and vegetable 
export industry required simultaneous investment in transportation and port 
facilities, as well as infrastructure to deliver cleaner water. A fruit producer, on 
its own, could not provide all the needed components; and without coordination 
between agricultural interests, infrastructure investors, and local water utilities, 
the fruit and vegetable export industry might never have taken off.
Another source of divergence between private and social returns is capital 
market imperfections. According to this argument, new firms may have difficulty 
attracting sufficient start-up capital. The same applies to existing firms that need 
to borrow to develop new products or processes. If banks and other lenders in 
the financial system lack the information they need to make loans, many solid 
prospects may not receive funding.
Industrial Policy Tools
Although various techniques are used to carry out industrial policies, they all share 
the same objective of channeling resources to the targeted industry. This can be 
accomplished in various ways, but the most obvious is to offer direct subsidies to 
firms in the targeted industry. As noted, this runs into the practical difficulty that 
Uruguay Round rules of the WTO prohibit subsidies for competitive products. 
Nevertheless, the rules generally allow governments to subsidize “precompetitive” 
activities such as research, and the distinction between the two can be blurry at 
times. It is not necessary, however, to provide direct subsidies to targeted indus-
tries in order to support them. Governments have a wide range of options, ranging 
from tax breaks to providing information about conditions in foreign markets, to 
lobbying foreign governments to adopt home country technical standards, or tying 
foreign aid to purchases from home country firms.

Clean Energy and Industrial Policy
Power generation is one of the foundations of a modern, high-income economy 
and it is not an exaggeration to say that without energy, there is very little GDP. 
At the same time, energy production and consumption are dramatically altering 
the planet and making life much more precarious in many places, but especially 
low-lying coastal areas and areas subject to extreme weather events. We need 
energy, but the forms we produce and consume are harming the planet. One 
central part of a solution to the problems created by global climate change is to 
transition to clean energy sources that do not put carbon and other greenhouse 
gases into the environment.
Carbon pollution is a classic case of a negative externality. A significant part 
of the cost of burning fossil fuels is not included in the price of the fuels since 
producers and consumers of electricity from coal fired plants, or producers 
and consumers of transportation that uses gas powered internal combustion 
engines, do not pay the full cost of the environmental damage that results from 
burning coal and gasoline.
Along with this externality, another characteristic of our energy production 
and consumption is a very strong movement toward research, development, 
and deployment of investments in low-carbon energy sources in general, and 
wind and solar power in particular. In 2015, for example, new investments in 
solar and wind and other forms of clean energy outpaced investments in oil 
and gas and coal, even though the latter are more than 80 percent of all energy 
production today and solar and wind are a very small percentage of the world’s 
energy supply. The World Bank, for example, estimates that only 1 percent of 
the total energy supply in the United States was from solar and wind in 2012.
Such a momentous shift in world energy production and consumption will 
create enormous disruptions but also fantastic opportunities for any producer 
able to bring clean energy costs down quickly and commercialize the new tech-
nology. Governments across the globe are aware of this potential for clean 
energy to create new industries and many have formulated industrial policies 
to try to make their firms world leaders. Winning the clean energy race will 
avoid environmental catastrophe and it promises to be extremely lucrative for 
whichever country or firms develop the most widely used technologies.
Leaders in the race include China, the United States, Japan, Germany, and 
the United Kingdom. Their tools for promoting their industries include subsi-
dies in the form of direct payments to producers and consumers, tax breaks for 
businesses and households that produce or adopt clean energy, and the fund-
ing of research and development. Each of these forms of support—subsidies, 
tax breaks, and direct support for R&D—have multiple subcategories. In the 
United States, wind and solar received the most support, with approximately 
18 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of the $29.3 billion in total financial

Problems with Industrial Policies
While every economist recognizes that markets do not always produce the optimal 
outcome, many are skeptical about the practicality of using industrial policies to 
solve problems of market failure. Furthermore, many of the practices described are 
considered harmful to the interests of foreign firms, and new rules introduced by 
the WTO as part of the Uruguay Round limit the ability of countries to employ poli-
cies that were once relatively common (see the case study at the end of the chapter).
One problem is that it is difficult to obtain the information necessary to measure 
the extent of market failure. For example, an efficient industrial policy requires 
governments to provide precisely the right amount of additional resources to the 
targeted industry. This implies that governments should keep adding resources as 
long as the external benefits are greater than the cost of the resources; but in many 
cases it is difficult to measure the benefits, particularly if they are spread through-
out the economy and if they are only realized over a long period of time. Without 
the advantage of hard numbers, it is easy to imagine a situation where a govern-
ment program spends $100 million to capture $50 million of external benefits.
A second problem is determining which industry to target. If everyone acknowl-
edges that a particular industry has a bright future, then entrepreneurs and inves-
tors will jump on it and government support is unnecessary. On the other hand, 
we know that external benefits cause markets to underinvest. Consequently, one 
possibility for choosing industries to target is to pick the ones that have the ­largest 
external benefits. One potential problem with this strategy is that the positive 
externalities that develop out of new technologies and inventions are often a 
support offered by the federal government in 2013. In addition to financial sup-
ports, governments at the national and sub-national levels also offer support 
in the form of regulations that push producers and consumers towards cleaner 
energy. Examples include the carbon emissions targets such as those agreed 
at the UN Conference on Climate Change held in Paris in December 2015, or 
Germany’s Renewable Energy Act of 2000.
As governments have made clearer their intentions to support new energy 
sources, the private sector has jumped into the market with large investments 
and new research and development. In the final analysis, it is difficult to say 
how important a role governments played in encouraging the private sector to 
get serious about climate change, or in helping firms to reach the technological 
frontiers where they can begin to sell their products internationally, but it seems 
likely that many new developments would not have been realized without these 
industrial policies. Financially, some countries are likely to realize very sizable 
gains from trade as they become global producers of clean energy technology.

surprise to everyone involved and it is impossible to know beforehand that they 
will occur. In 1990, for example, almost no one foresaw the advent of the Internet.
Another problem with industrial policies is that they encourage rent seeking, 
which is any activity by firms, individuals, or special interests that is designed to 
alter the distribution of income in their favor without adding to the amount of 
total income in the economy. If firms know that governments are willing to use 
industrial policies, they will spend resources to obtain some of the subsidies. This 
may require the hiring of lobbyists, economists, or engineers who will work to 
persuade the legislature or some other rule makers. The downside is that it uses 
resources but does not add to total output. The extent to which industrial poli-
cies encourage resources to be wasted in lobbying and other non-economically 
productive activities partly depends on the administrative process through which 
targeted industries are chosen, and the political culture of the country enacting 
the industrial policy. Countries that have a greater degree of corruption in their 
political system are likely to have a much harder time choosing between industries 
on the basis of scientific, technological, or economic criteria.
Another problem with industrial policies is that it is impossible to contain the 
external benefits of R&D spending within national boundaries. New technolo-
gies soon spread to every nation that has the technological sophistication to take 
advantage of them. One set of estimates puts the benefits to foreigners of R&D 
spending by the home country at around one-fourth of the total benefits. The fact 
that many U.S. firms have separate joint ventures in research and production with 
European and Japanese firms increases the chances that a new breakthrough will 
spread to firms in other countries.
Despite these obstacles, industrial policies remain an intensely debated topic, 
particularly in the arena of economic development. Japan and South Korea used 
them extensively and are frequently cited as models for developing countries. 
Opponents of industrial policies continue to argue that sound macroeconomic poli-
cies, high rates of saving and investment, and high levels of schooling were the keys 
to success in those two countries, and that industrial policies were a distraction at 
best. Given the difficulties of determining cause and effect in economic develop-
ment, an active debate between opponents and proponents will probably continue 
for some time. We will examine the East Asian case in greater detail in Chapter 16.

Do the WTO Rules Against Industrial Policies 
Hurt Developing Countries?
The Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
accomplished more than the creation of the WTO and the lowering of tariffs. It 
created new agreements in a range of areas, including trade in services, invest-
ment rules, intellectual property protection, and limits to industrial subsidies.
(continued)

136
Part 2    International Trade
All economists agree that one effect of the new agreements is that countries 
are much more limited in their ability to implement industrial policies that 
target an enterprise, an industry, groups of enterprises, or groups of industries. 
There is much less consensus on whether these limits on industrial policies are 
harmful to developing countries. Economists that favor industrial policies as a 
tool for development see the limits imposed by the WTO as potentially harm-
ful constraints on national development policies, while economists that view 
industrial policies as unhelpful see the limits on them as beneficial and useful 
for avoiding trade disputes.
Two agreements in particular are singled out as creating limits on the deploy-
ment of industrial policies by national governments. These are the TRIMs 
(Trade-Related Investment Measures) and SCM (Subsidies and Countervailing 
Measures) agreements. A third agreement, TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of 
Intellectual Property Rights), is also blamed for limiting access to new knowl-
edge and technology, and for causing potential harm to developing countries.
TRIMs Agreement
The TRIMs agreement is designed to ensure that national governments do 
not favor domestic investment over foreign investment (national treatment). 
It does not define trade-related investment measures in general but it gives an 
illustrative list of prohibited actions. Two areas of TRIMs’ prohibitions are 
most important. Nations are not allowed to condition the permission they grant 
to foreign investment on the use of local inputs or on export performance. 
Historically, many countries used performance requirements to link foreign 
investors with local manufacturers. For example, they required a certain per-
centage of domestic content to be used in the plants built by foreign investors 
in order to increase domestic value added, to strengthen linkages within an 
industry, and to increase the transfer of technology from the foreign firm to 
domestic firms. This technique was used often in the auto industry. Nations 
also often imposed trade balancing requirements on foreign investment and 
required exports to match imports or foreign exchange earnings to be equal to 
foreign exchange used to buy imported inputs.
SCM Agreement
The SCM defines prohibited subsidies and “actionable” subsidies. Prohibited 
subsidies are ones that require a firm to use domestic inputs or to meet export 
targets; in a sense the SCM is parallel to the TRIMs in the limits it places on 
national policies. Actionable subsidies are any financial benefit given to a firm 
that harms firms or industries in another country. If, for example, a govern-
ment gives special tax incentives to its auto industry and this hurts sales by

Summary
■
■Comparative advantage cannot account for a significant part of world trade. 
In many countries, well over 50 percent of the merchandise trade is intrain-
dustry, and for the United States and a number of other large economies, it 
is over two-thirds.
■
■Intraindustry trade is not based on comparative advantage since it consists of 
the export and import of similar products and occurs mostly between coun-
tries that have similar productivity, technology, and factor endowments. 
Intraindustry trade is based on economies of scale and product differentiation.
■
■Economies of scale occur whenever average costs decrease as production 
increases. Economies of scale are an important determinant of trade pat-
terns because they form a separate basis for trade that is in addition to com-
parative advantage–based trade.
■
■Economies of scale can be internal, external, or both. With internal economies 
of scale, the gains from trade include a wider selection of consumer choices 
and lower prices. With external economies of scale, the gains from trade are 
less certain since, in theory, they can lock in production in a less efficient coun-
try and prevent the development of production in a more efficient country.
■
■External economies of scale lead to regional agglomerations of firms. Firms 
are attracted by several positive factors derived from operating in close 
auto companies located in another WTO member, then that member may file 
a grievance with the WTO, or it may do its own investigation leading to taxes 
on imports from the country with the subsidized firms.
TRIPS Agreement
The third agreement, TRIPS, which many view as harmful to the interests of 
developing countries, is argued to limit their access to new technology and to 
knowledge. It does this by requiring a much more rigorous enforcement of 
intellectual property rights such as patents and copyrights. Those who oppose 
the TRIPS agreement argue that many rich countries had weak intellectual 
property rights early in their period of industrial development. This enabled 
them to take products apart, see how they are designed, and then copy them, a 
process known as reverse engineering. TRIPS restricts reverse engineering and 
places many new fields of technology under its jurisdiction, where previously 
countries could make some fields of technology off-limits to patents and copy-
rights. TRIPS also extends the duration of patent rights, and parallel to the SCM 
and TRIMs agreements, it limits the ability of governments to regulate patent 
­holders by imposing local production or technology transfer requirements.

geographical proximity to each other. The three main factors are large pools 
of skilled labor, specialized suppliers of inputs, and knowledge spillovers.
■
■Industrial policies are premised on the idea that markets may fail to develop 
an industry that is essential for future prosperity, or that there will be less 
development than is optimal if many of the benefits of an industry are exter-
nal to the firms in the industry.
■
■Historically, governments have used a number of tools to foster the devel-
opment of industries that they thought were essential to future prosperity. 
These tools included a number of different types of direct and indirect sub-
sidies. The Uruguay Round of the GATT agreement has made it illegal to 
subsidize a commercial product and much more difficult to target specific 
firms and industries.
■
■Problems with industrial policies include the absence of a reliable method for 
selecting the industry to target, rent seeking, international spillovers, and the 
difficulty of correctly estimating the optimal amount of support to provide.

INTRODUCTION: TARIFFS AND QUOTAS
LO 6.1	 Use supply and demand analysis to explain and illustrate consumer and 
producer surplus.
Chapters 6 and 7 are an introduction to the theory and policy of tariffs and quotas. In 
the economics literature, this analysis is called commercial policy. Chapter 6 is an intro-
duction to tariff theory and Chapter 7 focuses on an empirical estimate of the direct 
costs of protectionism and the arguments used by proponents of restricted trade.The 
inefficiency and expense of tariffs and quotas as a means to protect industries and jobs 
will be apparent after measuring their direct costs.
Analysis of a Tariff
Barriers to trade come in all shapes and sizes. Some are obvious or transparent, 
whereas others are hidden or nontransparent. Quotas directly limit the quantity of 
imports, while tariffs indirectly limit imports by taxing them. Tariffs and quotas cause 
consumers to switch to relatively cheaper domestic goods or to drop out of the market 
altogether. They also encourage domestic producers to increase their output because 
demand switches from foreign to domestic goods.

141
In the analysis that follows we will look only at the effects of tariffs and quotas 
on the industry in which they are imposed. For example, the economy-wide effect 
of a tariff in, say, the steel industry will not be analyzed. In the language of eco-
nomics, the analysis in Chapter 6 is known as partial equilibrium analysis because 
it considers the effects of tariffs and quotas on only a part of the economy—the 
market in which the trade barrier is erected. Before we turn to tariff analysis, how-
ever, we must introduce two important concepts: consumer and producer surplus.
Consumer and Producer Surplus
What is the maximum price you would be willing to pay for a gallon of milk? The 
answer is likely to be different for each consumer, depending on income, how 
much he or she likes milk, whether he or she has kids who need it, whether he or 
she can tolerate lactose or not, and a number of other factors, many of which are 
subjective. The subjective value that consumers place on milk is contained in the 
market demand curve for milk, which describes the total quantity of a good that 
consumers are willing and able to buy at each and every price. As the market price 
falls, a greater quantity is purchased because more consumers will feel that the 
lower price is equal to or below the value they place on the milk.
Suppose, for example, that you are willing to pay $3.50 for a gallon of milk, 
but the price is only $3.20. In essence, each gallon of milk provides $0.30 of value 
that is “free” in the sense that it is over and above what you must pay. This excess 
value, called consumer surplus, is the value received by consumers that is in excess 
of the price they pay. It occurs because everyone values each good differently, yet 
for most goods there is only one price. Consumer surplus can be measured if the 
demand curve is known. Since the demand curve is a summary of the value that 
each consumer places on a particular good, the area between the demand curve 
and the price line is a measurement of consumer surplus.
Figure 6.1 shows hypothetical market demand and supply curves for milk. At 
the market equilibrium price of $3.20 per gallon, 10,000 gallons will be supplied 
and demanded. Many people value milk at a higher price, however, and the value 
they receive in consuming milk is greater than $3.20. In Figure 6.1, consumer 
surplus is the area below the demand curve and above the price line of $3.20. The 
size or value of consumer surplus is the area of the triangle given by the formula 
(12) * (height) * (width), or (12) * ($1.30) * (10,000), which is equal to $6,500. 
This equals the difference between the subjective value of the milk consumed and 
the total amount that consumers spent for it.
Consumer surplus is a real savings to consumers. If firms had a way to deter-
mine the maximum price that each consumer was willing to pay, then theoretically 
they could charge every individual a different price and thus reduce consumer sur-
plus to zero. Luckily for those of us not in the milk business, firms usually cannot 
get this information without going through a long and costly interview procedure. 
As a result, it is usually impractical (and in some cases, illegal) for firms to charge 
different customers different prices. Nevertheless, some firms such as car dealers 
manage to charge different prices for the same goods. The easiest strategy for most 

142
Part 2    International Trade
firms is simply to charge everyone the same price, so consumer surplus is a real 
savings for most consumers in most markets.
On the production side, the analogous concept is called producer surplus. In 
our hypothetical milk example, if you owned a dairy farm and were willing and 
able to produce milk at $3.00 per gallon, you would receive producer surplus of 
$0.20 per gallon if you sold milk at $3.20. Recall that the supply curve for a mar-
ket is the sum of supply curves for the firms in the market and that it reflects the 
minimum price firms will accept to produce a given amount. In Figure 6.1, some 
firms are willing to produce at $2.00 per gallon, and at every price above $1.50 at 
least some firms will have output to sell. Every firm that is willing to sell for less 
than the equilibrium price of $3.20 earns revenue that is above the minimum it 
needs. This excess or surplus revenue is a firm’s producer surplus.
As in the case of consumer surplus, we can measure producer surplus. Measure-
ment in this case depends on knowing the parameters of the supply curve (where 
it crosses the price axis and its slope) because producer surplus is the area above 
the supply curve and below the price line. In our example, it is equal in value to 
the triangle given by the formula (12) * ($1.70) * (10,000), which equals $8,500. 
This is the revenue received by producers that is in excess of the minimum amount 
of revenue that would be required to get them to produce 10,000 gallons of milk.
Prices, Output, and Consumption
We will use the concepts of producer and consumer surplus when we discuss 
the income distribution effects of tariffs and quotas. Before we analyze those 
effects, however, we must begin with a description of the effects of tariffs on 
prices, domestic output, and domestic consumption.

143
Figure 6.2 shows the domestic or national supply and demand for an imported 
good. We are assuming that there is one price for the good, which we will call the 
world price, or Pw, and that foreign producers are willing to supply us with all of 
the units of the good that we want at that price. This is equivalent to assuming that 
foreign supply is perfectly elastic, or that the United States does not consume a 
large enough quantity to affect the price. We will drop this assumption when we 
discuss the case of a large country. Note that the world price is below the domestic 
equilibrium price. This means that domestic producers are not able to satisfy all 
domestic demand at the market price of Pw and that consumers depend on foreign 
producers for some of their consumption. Specifically, at price Pw, consumers 
demand Q2, but domestic producers supply only Q1. The difference, Q2 - Q1, or 
line segment Q1Q2, is made up by imports.
Now suppose that the government imposes a tariff of amount “t.” Importers 
will still be able to buy the good from foreign producers for amount Pw, but they 
will have to pay the import tax of “t,” which they tack onto the price to domestic 
consumers. In other words, the price to consumers rises to Pw + t = Pt, as shown 
in Figure 6.3. The price increase in the domestic market has effects on domestic 
consumption, domestic production, and imports. First, the price increase squeezes 
some people out of the market, and domestic consumption falls from Q2 to Q2*. 
Next, on the production side, the higher price encourages domestic production 
to increase from Q1 to Q1*. The increase in domestic production occurs because 
domestic firms are able to charge a slightly higher price (Pw + t) to cover their 
increasing costs while remaining competitive with foreign firms. Finally, imports

decrease from Q1Q2 to Q1*Q2*. To summarize, tariffs cause the domestic price to 
rise by the amount of the tariff, domestic consumption falls, domestic production 
rises, and imports fall.
Resource Allocation and Income Distribution
Tariffs have more subtle effects than just a rise in prices and a fall in imports. The 
increase in domestic production requires additional resources of land, labor, and 
capital to be reallocated from their prior uses into the industry receiving protec-
tion under the tariff. Also, when the price changes, consumer and producer surplus 
do too.
First, let’s consider the effect on consumer surplus. Figure 6.3 shows both the 
pre- and post-tariff price and output levels. Remember that consumer surplus is 
the entire area above the price line and below the demand curve. When consum-
ers pay price Pw, it is areas a + b + c + d + e + f. After the tariff is imposed 
and the price rises to Pt, consumer surplus shrinks to e + f. The difference, area 
a + b + c + d, represents a loss to consumers.
Unlike consumer surplus, producer surplus grows. Pre-tariff producer surplus 
is area g, and post-tariff is g + a. The difference, area a, is the additional revenue 
that is above the minimum necessary to encourage domestic firms to increase their 
output from Q1 to Q1*. On net, producers are better off, and consumers are worse 
off, but what about the nation as a whole?
If we consider the whole loss to consumers, areas a + b + c + d, we see that it 
can be subdivided into several different areas. Part of the loss, area a, is a transfer

Tariffs cause an increase in domestic prices and domestic production, and a

from consumer surplus to producer surplus. Although the loss makes consumers 
worse off, it makes producers better off by the same amount. Therefore, the nation 
as a whole is neither better nor worse off unless it can be established that giving 
the resources to producers somehow benefits or harms national welfare. This part 
of the lost consumer surplus is an income distribution effect of the tariff, since it 
rearranges national income by transferring resources from one group (consumers) 
to another group (producers).
Another income distribution effect of the tariff is represented by area c. Note 
that the height of this area is equal to the tariff, and the width is the amount of 
imports after the tariff is imposed. Therefore, this part of lost consumer surplus 
is equal to (tariff) * (imports), which is the amount of revenue collected by the 
government when it enacts the tariff. In this case, the income distribution effect 
is a transfer from consumers to the government. Again, it is assumed that there is 
no net effect on national welfare since the loss by consumers is exactly matched by 
the gain of government. As long as this transfer does not change national welfare, 
there is no net effect.
The two remaining areas of lost consumer surplus are b and d. Both represent 
net national losses, and both involve a misallocation of resources. Consider area 
d first. Along the demand curve between Q2* and Q2, there are consumers that 
value the good above the cost of purchasing it at the world price. As a result of 
the tariff, however, they have been squeezed out of the market and are not willing 
or able to pay price Pt. The fact that consumers value the good above the cost of 
obtaining it in the world market but cannot purchase it is a net loss to the nation. 
Economists refer to the destruction of value that is not compensated by a gain 
somewhere else as a deadweight loss. Area d is this type of loss.
The final area to consider is b. Along the domestic supply curve between Q1 
and Q1*, output is increased at existing plants. Given that the supply curve slopes 
upward, firms can only increase their output if the price is allowed to rise. In other 
words, in order to obtain the additional output, domestic producers must be able 
to charge a higher price that will cover their rising costs for each additional unit. 
At the pre-tariff price of Pw, the total cost of imports Q1Q1* would have been the 
price times the quantity, or (Pw) * (Q1Q1*). The cost of producing the same goods 
at home is equal to the cost of the imports plus area b. In other words, the triangle 
b is the additional cost to the nation when it tries to make the extra output Q1Q1* 
at home instead of buying it in the world market at price Pw. Area b is a resource 
misallocation and a net loss to the nation because the same goods (Q1Q1*) could 
have been acquired without giving up this amount. Area b is another deadweight 
loss, sometimes referred to as an efficiency loss because it occurs on the produc-
tion side.
We can summarize the net effect of the tariff on the nation’s welfare by 
subtracting the gains of producers and government from the losses of consum-
ers: (a + b + c + d - a - c) = b + d. The two triangular areas are losses for 
which there are no compensating gains; therefore, they represent real losses to 
the nation as a whole. Table 6.1 summarizes the effects of tariffs that we have 
noted.

A Comparison of Tariff Rates
The Doha Development Agenda of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is 
focused on the trade problems of developing countries. One impetus for the 
start of the Doha negotiations, and a factor behind the emphasis on economic 
development issues, is the complaint by many developing countries that they 
did not derive sufficient benefits from the Uruguay Round of trade negotia-
tions that concluded in 1993. At issue for many developing countries are the 
levels of tariffs and other industrial country barriers that block access to agricul-
ture, clothing, and textile markets. These product lines tend to be areas where 
developing countries have comparative advantage, particularly in cases where 
climate is a factor or where production uses abundant labor but requires little 
capital.
For their part, many industrial countries, the World Bank, and the WTO 
have argued that a major part of the problem faced by developing countries is 
the relatively high level of protection among developing countries themselves. 
High tariffs limit these countries’ ability to sell into each other’s markets—and 
consequently their ability to follow their comparative advantage.
Figure 6.4 shows trends and levels of tariff rates in three groups of countries 
that are arranged according to their income levels. In 2010 U.S. dollars, low-
income countries have per capita income levels below $1,005, middle income 
ranges from $1,005 to $12,275, and high income is anything above the middle 
group.

Chapter 6    The Theory of Tariffs and Quotas 
147
Although the numbers in Figure 6.4 should be treated with caution since the 
year-to-year data in each group varies in the number of countries included, two 
patterns are visible in Figure 6.4 and are widely accepted as qualitatively accu-
rate. First, the higher a country’s income, the lower its tariffs are likely to be. 
There are exceptions, of course, and one can point to low- and middle-income 
countries with low tariffs (Albania and El Salvador) and high-income countries 
with relatively high tariffs (Bermuda and Bahrain), but in general, low income 
implies relatively higher tariffs, and high income implies the opposite. Second, 
tariffs have come down over time. In each of the three groups mentioned, the 
average tariff fell by about 50 percent between 1986 and 2003.
Why then, if trade is beneficial for growth, do low-income countries tend 
to have higher tariff rates? Although the complete answer varies by country 
circumstances, one of the most important reasons is that tariffs are a relatively 
easy tax to administer and often form an important part of government rev-
enue. Taxes on income, sales, and property require more complex accounting 
systems and formal markets through which a large share of economic activity 
passes. In countries with large informal markets, where sales of goods and 
services are not recorded, it is difficult to apply many kinds of taxes. In addi-
tion, taxes on income and property run into powerful interest groups that have 
the power to prevent the creation or payment of taxes. Consequently, tariff 
revenue is an important source of operating revenue for governments in many 
developing countries.

Other Potential Costs
These effects of tariffs are the ones that are most predictable and quantifiable. 
In Chapter 7 there are some actual estimates of the production and income dis-
tribution effects of tariffs and quotas for a number of industries in the United 
States, Europe, and Japan. These are not the only effects of tariffs, however—
three others should be noted: the effects if trading partners retaliate, the impact 
of protection on domestic innovation and productivity, and the incentive for firms 
to engage in rent-seeking behavior. Each of these effects broadens our focus to a 
consideration of more than the directly affected industry.
Retaliation  Retaliation can add to the net loss of a tariff by hurting the export 
markets of other industries. For example, in 1995, the United States imposed a 
tariff on European (mainly Italian) pasta because of some trade practices that 
the United States felt discriminated against its pasta manufacturers. In return, 
the European Community retaliated by imposing tariffs on U.S. manufacturers 
of vegetable oils—corn, soybean, safflower, and other cooking oils. The cost of 
the U.S.-imposed tariff not only affected U.S. consumers of Italian pasta, who 
were forced to pay higher prices, but also affected workers and owners of capital 
in the U.S. vegetable oil industry. In essence, in addition to the deadweight losses 
brought on by the tariff, the vegetable oil industry lost export markets. A further 
problem is that retaliation can quickly escalate. For example, in the 1930s, many 
depressed nations reduced imports through tariffs. The result was that they gained 
jobs in industries that competed with imports but lost jobs in industries that pro-
duced exports. In the end, no jobs were gained, trade declined, and everyone had 
a lower standard of living.
Innovation  A costly effect of tariffs is that they isolate domestic firms from for-
eign competition and reduce the incentive to introduce new products or upgrade 
the quality and features of existing ones. Imports are often a major point of 
access to new technologies and new products. As Chapter 1 described, there are 
several types of evidence showing that open economies grow faster than closed 
ones.
Rent Seeking  Hypothetically, tariffs could stimulate product improvement if 
domestic producers know that the tariffs are temporary and if they believe they 
will be removed. The problem is that firms with tariff protection can hire lobbyists 
and work to keep the protection in place. Economists use the term rent seeking 
to describe this type of behavior. Rent seeking is any activity that uses resources 
to try to capture more income without actually producing a good or service. If 
it is easier to lobby a government for protection than it is to become more com-
petitive, then firms will use rent seeking tactics. If, on the contrary, lobbying is 
not likely to succeed in gaining protection, then firms are less likely to engage 
in that particular form of rent seeking. For this reason, political systems that do 
not easily provide protective tariffs are much more likely to avoid one source of 
wasted resources.

149
The Large Country Case
Economists distinguish between large and small countries when it comes to tariff 
analysis. As a practical matter there may not be much difference between the two, 
but in theory it is possible for large countries to actually improve their national 
welfare with a tariff as long as their trading partners do not retaliate. In economic 
terms, a large country is one that imports enough of a particular product so that 
if it imposes a tariff, the exporting country will reduce its price in order to keep 
some of the market it might otherwise lose.
An example of the large country case tariff is shown in Figure 6.5. Suppose that 
the United States, a large country, imposes a tariff of size t on its imports of oil. 
The fall in U.S. demand brought on by the tariff causes Pw, the world price, to fall 
to Pw*, offsetting some or all of the deadweight loss from the tariff.
Looking more closely at Figure 6.5, we can compare the large and small country 
cases. The situation before the tariff is the same as the one shown in Figure 6.3. 
The main difference between the two cases stems from the fact that foreign sup-
pliers cut the price to Pw* after the tariff is levied. Consequently, less additional 
domestic production occurs, and fewer consumers are squeezed out of the market. 
In other words, areas b and d in Figure 6.5 are smaller than they would be in the 
small country case where there is no price drop. A smaller deadweight loss is not 
the only effect, however. In Figure 6.5, area g represents tariff revenue, which 
together with area c is the total tariff revenue collected. Compared to the pre-tariff 
situation, however, area g is a net gain to the importing nation. Pre-tariff, area 
g was part of the money paid for imports. After the tariff, and due to the price 
decline, it is part of the revenue collected by the government and, hence, stays 
within the nation.

As long as g 7 b + d, a large country can improve its welfare by imposing a 
tariff. This outcome, however, assumes that there is no retaliation, rent seeking, 
or harmful effects on innovation.
Effective Versus Nominal Rates of Protection
One of the ironies of tariff protection is that often it is not what it seems. In fact, 
the amount of protection given to any one product depends not only on the tariff 
rate but also on whether there are tariffs on the inputs used to produce it. ­Suppose, 
for example, that the United States decided to impose a tariff on imports of laptop 
computers. If American-made laptops have foreign parts in them, then the amount 
of protection they receive from a U.S. tariff depends also on whether there are 
tariffs on their imported inputs. It is conceivable, in other words, that the protec-
tion given by a tariff on laptops could be completely undone by forcing laptop 
manufacturers to pay tariffs on their imported inputs.
Economists distinguish between the effective rate of protection and the ­nominal 
rate of protection. The nominal rate is what we have discussed so far in this chap-
ter—the rate that is levied on a given product. The effective rate of protection 
takes into account the nominal rate and any tariffs on intermediate inputs. Conse-
quently, it gives a clearer picture of the overall amount of protection that any given 
product receives. The effective rate of protection is related to the concept of value 
added. Value added is the price of a good minus the costs of the intermediate goods 
used to produce it. Value added measures the contributions of capital and labor at 
a given stage of production. The effective rate of protection is defined as follows:
(VA* - VA)/VA
where VA is the amount of domestic value added under free trade, and VA* is 
the amount of domestic value added after taking into account all tariffs, both on 
final goods and intermediate inputs.
Consider the example shown in Table 6.2. Suppose that laptop computers sell for 
$1,000, and foreign producers are willing to sell to the United States all it wants at that

Effective rates of protection are higher than nominal rates if intermediate inputs are imported 
tariff free. If intermediate inputs are subject to tariffs, it reduces the effective rate of protection 
and can even turn it negative.

price. In order to make a laptop, American manufacturers must import $600 worth of 
parts, so that a domestic laptop actually has $400 of value added in the United States 
($1,000 - $600 = $400). If the United States imposes a 20 percent tariff, then the 
price rises to $1,200. Value added in the United States is now $600 ($1,200 - $600), 
and the effective rate of protection is 50 percent (($600 - $400)/$400).  
That is, a 20 percent tariff provides 50 percent protection! This happens because 
a large share of the value of the final product is produced elsewhere, so all of the 
domestic protection falls on the share produced in the United States.
Now consider what happens if the United States decides also to protect domes-
tic component manufacturers and levies a large tariff on intermediate inputs. If the 
tariff on foreign parts is 50 percent, then the cost of intermediate inputs rises from 
$600 to $900. With a 20 percent tariff on the value of the final product, the price 
of imports stays at $1,200, which is the price American laptop makers must meet. 
Value added with the tariff on intermediate inputs is $300 ($1,200 - $900), and 
the effective rate of protection is now -25 percent (($300 - $400)/$400). That is, 
even with a 20 percent tariff on foreign laptops, American laptop makers receive 
negative protection. The tariff on the final product is more than offset by the tariffs 
on the intermediate products, so that the overall situation leaves producers more 
exposed to foreign competition than if there were no tariffs levied at all.
Negative rates of effective protection are not uncommon. Part of the reason 
stems from the fact that tariffs are enacted in a piecemeal fashion over long peri-
ods and are not constructed in a planned and coherent way. Pressures from domes-
tic lobbyists, considerations of strategic interests, and numerous other forces go 
into the shaping of national tariff systems. Consequently, it is not surprising to 
find contradictory tariff policies where newer tariffs undo the effects of older ones.
This discussion should add a note of caution to attempts to determine exactly 
which industries are protected. Clearly, the notion of effective rates of protection 
is more relevant than nominal rates. With tariff rates, what you see may not always 
be what you get.

The Uruguay and Doha Rounds
The Uruguay Round concluded in 1993 after seven years of negotiations. It 
took three years longer than planned, and included one complete breakdown in 
the talks. The agreement was ratified by most of its 123 participating countries 
in 1994, and implemented in 1995.
Table 6.3 summarizes the four main outcomes of the negotiations. Trade 
barriers were reduced through several mechanisms, including tariff reductions, 
clarification of the rules on subsidies, a number of new areas of agreement, and 
institutional reforms within the framework of the existing General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Most notably, the Uruguay Round created the

WTO as a body to oversee the implementation and further refinement of the 
various agreements.
One of the main effects on world trade patterns of the Uruguay Round 
was the negotiation of a separate Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC). 
Until 1994, textiles and clothing had a separate international agreement, called 
the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, which was a system of quotas and tariffs. Under 
the ATC, textiles and clothing were integrated into the WTO system, with a 
complete phase-out of all quotas.
Other notable accomplishments of the Uruguay Round include an extension 
of rules governing services trade, the General Agreement on Trade in Services 
(GATS); an agreement on intellectual property enforcement, called Trade-
Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS); and an agreement 
on investment, the Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs)(see the Case 
Study in Chapter 5 for a discussion of the TRIPS and TRIMS agreements). 
The Uruguay Round also created the WTO to administer all of the agreements 
(ATC, GATS, TRIPS, TRIMs, GATT), and initiated a more efficient dispute 
settlement process. In addition, the WTO conducts periodic reviews of indi-
vidual country trade policies, which it publishes online.
The Doha Round was launched in 2001 in Doha, Qatar. Although the goal 
was to reach an agreement by the end of 2005, the talks collapsed in July 2006. 
They were later restarted, collapsed again, and as of 2016, there is no further 
progress. Most countries have abandoned the effort to conclude the talks. Not 
surprisingly, the biggest areas of disagreement were trade barriers and subsidies 
in agriculture and market access for services. In addition, high income coun-
tries pushed middle income ones to further reduce their barriers to imports of 
manufactured goods.

ANALYSIS OF QUOTAS
LO 6.2	 Graphically demonstrate the effects of tariffs and quotas on prices, 
output, and consumption for small and large countries.
LO 6.3	 Differentiate and explain the resource allocation and income 
distribution effects of tariffs and quotas.
LO 6.4	 Use tariff data on inputs and outputs to compare effective and nominal 
rates of protection.
LO 6.5	 Compare and contrast quotas and tariffs.
The economic analysis of quotas is nearly identical to that of tariffs. Quotas are 
quantitative restrictions that specify a limit on the quantity of imports rather than 
a tax. The net result is much the same: tariffs and quotas lead to a reduction in 
imports, a fall in total domestic consumption, and an increase in domestic produc-
tion. The main difference between quotas and tariffs is that quotas that are not 
followed up with additional policy actions do not generate tariff revenue for the 
government. The lost tariff revenue can end up in the hands of foreign producers 
as they raise their prices to match demand to supply. Hence, the net loss from 
quotas can exceed that from tariffs.
Doha is the first set of trade talks to fail since the signing of the GATT 
agreement in 1947. Its failure has caused some observers to question the future 
relevance of the WTO, but as a dispute settlement body it is invaluable. In 
retrospect, it is not a surprise that it failed to achieve the original goals. Many 
quotas have been converted to tariff equivalents, and tariffs have fallen, more 
or less constantly since the signing of the GATT agreement in 1947. As a con-
sequence, issues of deep integration and issue affecting sensitive production 
sectors such as agriculture have come to the forefront of negotiations. Many of 
these issues are too contentious for easy resolution, especially in the context of 
a negotiation by all 162 members. Countries continue to negotiate outside the 
WTO, but now the focus is often on investor protections, patent issues, and ser-
vices, and the negotiations are bilateral or plurilateral, rather than multilateral 
through the WTO. These new issues reflect the fact of already low tariffs for 
many items, and the goal of multinational companies to protect their invest-
ments in production centers across the globe. There may not be another WTO 
negotiation to match the previous rounds, but there are continuing commit-
ments and ongoing negotiations between groups of countries.

154
Part 2    International Trade
In terms of Figure 6.3, consumers still lose area a + b + c + d, but the govern-
ment does not collect area c as a tax. (We will examine what happens to area c, 
but try to reason it out for yourself first.)
Types of Quotas
The most transparent type of quota is an outright limitation on the quantity of 
imports. Limitations are sometimes specified in terms of the quantity of a product 
coming from a particular country, and at other times there is an overall limit set 
without regard to which country supplies the product. For example, in the apparel 
sector, until 2005, the United States set quotas for imports of each type of garment 
(men’s suits, boys’ shirts, socks, and so on). The quota for each good was further 
divided by country; so, for example, Hong Kong and Haiti had different limits on 
each type of apparel that they could export to the United States.
Another type of quota is an import licensing requirement. The United States uses 
this form infrequently, but many other nations have relied on these quotas for the 
bulk of their protection. For example, until 1989, they were the main form of protec-
tion in Mexico. As the name implies, import licensing requirements force importers 
to obtain government licenses for their imports. By regulating the number of licenses 
granted and the quantity permitted under each license, import licenses are essentially 
the same as quotas. They are less transparent than quotas because governments 
usually do not publish information on the total allowable quantity of imports, and 
foreign firms are left in the dark about the specific limits to their exports.
A third form of quota, and the one that has been common in U.S. commer-
cial policy, is the voluntary export restraint (VER), also known as the voluntary 
restraint agreement (VRA). Under a VER, the exporting country “voluntarily” 
agrees to limit its exports for some period. The agreement usually occurs after a 
series of negotiations in which the exporter may be threatened with much more 
severe restrictions if they do not agree to limit exports in a specific market. Given 
that there is usually more than a hint of coercion, it may be a misnomer to call 
these restrictions “voluntary.”
VERs were popular forms of protection in the 1970s and 1980s, but new limits 
on their use were implemented under the Uruguay Round agreement. In 2005, 
however, both the United States and the European Union (EU) negotiated export 
restraints in textiles and apparel with China.
The Effect on the Profits of Foreign Producers
The main difference between tariffs and quotas is that there is no government rev-
enue from quotas. In place of tariff revenue, there are greater profits for foreign 
producers, called quota rents.
In Figure 6.6, the world price is set at Pw, domestic production is Q1, and imports 
are Q1Q2. Suppose that the government decides to set a quota on imports of quan-
tity Q1Q2*. At price Pw, demand exceeds supply, which is equal to Q1 domestic 
plus Q1Q2* imports. Consequently, the price rises until supply equals demand 
when the gap between the domestic supply curve and the domestic demand curve 

Chapter 6    The Theory of Tariffs and Quotas 
155
is equal to Q1Q2*. This is illustrated in Figure 6.7, where domestic supply is shown 
as having grown to Q1*, and the domestic price is Pq, which is above Pw. Q1*Q2* 
is equal to Q1Q2* in Figure 6.6.
Figure 6.7 looks the same as Figure 6.3, which shows a tariff in a small country case, 
because they have nearly identical effects on production, consumption, and prices paid 
by consumers. Indeed, for any given quota there is some tariff that will accomplish the

identical import restriction. One difference stands out, however. In the tariff case, the 
government earned revenue from imports—area c in Figures 6.3 and 6.7. In the quota 
case, no revenue is earned unless the government auctions the quota. Instead, area c 
represents the extra profits of foreign producers due to the higher prices.
A second important difference between tariffs and quotas relates to their 
effect on producer surplus over time, as demand for the good increases. If a quota 
remains fixed, an increase in consumer demand also increases the price paid by 
consumers and the quantity of producer surplus garnered by domestic firms. In 
contrast, an increase in consumer demand for an item that has an import tariff 
increases the quantity of imports and leaves the price intact. This assumes that the 
country is relatively small and the increase in its demand does not alter the world 
(pre-tariff) price. Given this difference, it is not surprising that domestic firms 
prefer quotas over tariffs as a form of protection for their industry.
Two circumstances can mitigate or limit the ability of foreign suppliers to earn 
extra profits. First, if there is a large number of foreign suppliers, then competitive 
conditions may prevent them from raising their prices. Second, a clever govern-
ment can extract the extra profits from foreign producers and domestic importers 
through the implementation of an auction for import licenses.
Suppose that the country imposing the quota decides to auction off the right 
to import. How much would a domestic importer be willing to pay? In Figures 6.6 
and 6.7, foreign suppliers are willing to sell the amount of the quota (Q1Q2* in 
Figure 6.6, or Q1*Q2* in Figure 6.7) at price Pw. A domestic importer, recognizing 
that he or she can sell the good at price Pq, should be willing to pay an amount 
equal to something slightly less than the difference Pq minus Pw. In other words, 
he or she pays Pw for the good that sells for Pq. If he or she pays anything less than 
Pq - Pw for the right to sell in the market with the quota, he or she makes a profit. 
In equilibrium, an auction market should lead to bids for the right to sell that are 
more or less equal to the projected price increase. With an auction market, then, 
the government can potentially collect the same revenue with a quota that it would 
with a tariff. Of course, administrative costs of a quota may be higher, since the 
government must implement its auction market.
Hidden Forms of Protection
While outright quantitative restrictions, import licensing requirements, and VERs 
are all forms of quotas, there are numerous other forms of protection that func-
tion the same as quotas. Any kind of trade barrier that reduces imports without 
imposing a tax functions more or less like a quota. Therefore, economists divide the 
different forms of protection into two main categories: tariffs and nontariff barriers 
(NTBs). Nontariff barriers can be subdivided into quotas and nontariff measures. 
Nontariff measures are often nontransparent, or hidden, in that they are not pre-
sented as trade barriers or forms of protection even though they serve that purpose.
Nontariff measures cover a wide variety of formats and economic activities. In 
many cases, it is difficult to decide if they are directly intended as trade-related 
measures, or if they exist for some other purpose, but have impacts on trade flows.  

Chapter 6    The Theory of Tariffs and Quotas

They include excessively complicated customs procedures, environmental and 
­consumer health and safety precautions, technical standards, government procure-
ment rules, limits imposed by state trading companies, and others. In general, non-
tariff measures include any regulatory or policy rule other than tariffs and quotas 
that limits imports. Often, it is difficult for nonspecialists to determine whether a 
nontariff measure is imposed in order to protect an industry, or out of some other 
concern. For example, the United States and the EU have a long-running disagree-
ment over the EU’s prohibition of imports of beef and pork from livestock that is 
fed growth hormones. The EU claims that this is to protect the health of its consum-
ers, while the United States argues that there is no scientific evidence to support the 
ban. The WTO agrees with the United States, but the EU insists that the meat has 
long-run health effects. Does the EU continue to ban imports in order to protect 
its beef and pork producers, or is it simply exercising a reasonable level of caution?
While there is no consensus about the dollar value of economic losses due to 
nontariff measures, there is a consensus among economists that the world econ-
omy would be better off if they were reduced. Research indicates that benefits 
would accrue through the lowering of prices for many goods, increases in export 
and import volumes, increases in production levels, and overall economic welfare. 
In this respect, they are not much different from tariffs or quotas. They are gener-
ally much more difficult to eliminate, however, as they are embedded more deeply 
in national economic policies.

Intellectual Property Rights and Trade
Intellectual property is usually divided into copyrights and related rights for 
literary and artistic work, and industrial property rights for trademarks, pat-
ents, industrial designs, geographical indications, and the layout of integrated 
circuits. Books, music, movies, logos, pharmaceuticals, car parts, designer 
clothing, software, computer chips, and much, much more are all subject to 
intellectual property rights protection and, unfortunately, to counterfeiting and 
piracy. The rules for respecting intellectual property rights as they relate to 
trade were negotiated during the Uruguay Round (1986–1994), and culminated 
in the TRIPS agreement.
The growth of world trade over the last half of the twentieth century led to a 
greater awareness of the importance of intellectual property. Over time, more 
traded goods and services incorporated specialized knowledge and unique ideas. 
Pharmaceuticals, telecommunications equipment, and other high technology 
products are valuable because of the innovation and research they incorporate, 
while software, movies, music, and other artistic expressions are valued for their 
creativity. The protection given to creators and innovators varied greatly until 
standardization began with the signing of the TRIPS agreement.
(continued)

Part 2    International Trade
The lack of intellectual property protection is viewed as a nontariff mea-
sure since the failure or inability to protect intellectual property restricts trade 
flows. Exporters are reluctant to sell products into a market if they know that 
their ideas or brands will be stolen and copied by local producers. Hence, 
there were strong pressures by high-income countries to reach an agreement 
on enforcement of protections for intellectual property. Since the implemen-
tation of the Uruguay Round in 1995, there have been thirty-four intellectual 
property disputes brought to the WTO, most having to do with patents, and a 
large share of those related to pharmaceuticals.
It is probably impossible to prevent copyright infringements that happen 
through informal networks of families and friends. For example, friends copy-
ing each other’s music or sharing software cannot be easily stopped when it 
is done outside a formal market. By contrast, the market for counterfeit and 
pirated goods in many countries is relatively visible. Car parts, electronics, 
pharmaceuticals, and other counterfeit and pirated goods pass through estab-
lished market places where, in theory, they can be stopped. Many of these 
markets are controlled by international criminal syndicates and everyone 
would benefit from their suppression. Estimates of the size of counterfeited 
and pirated products sold in international markets was several hundred billion 
dollars in 2005, and there is no reason to believe it has not grown since then.
A key question for trade economists is whether the TRIPS agreement pro-
vides the right strategy for controlling these illegal markets. The fundamental 
economic rationale for the TRIPS agreement is that it protects innovation 
and gives a financial incentive to firms and individuals for their efforts. Some 
economists do not see the lengthening of patent rights and spending large sums 
on enforcement efforts as the best strategy. Critics have argued that it imposes 
significant costs on middle-income countries such as China, Mexico, and oth-
ers because they must devote scarce resources to the enforcement of rules 
that protect businesses in high-income countries. Empirically, it is not well 
established that the benefits of innovation outweigh the costs associated with 
limiting access for those low- and middle-income countries that cannot pay.
Pharmaceuticals are a case in point. Access to drugs that combat HIV and 
AIDS is critical. If patent enforcement under the TRIPS agreement prevents the 
production of inexpensive copies, then it is harmful to world prosperity. Although 
a number of exceptions were written into the agreement to allow access to  
life-saving medicines and other critical technologies, it is difficult for many devel-
oping countries to take advantage of the exceptions because they lack the techni-
cal know-how to make generic versions of expensive and sophisticated drugs. In 
addition, the United States and other governments put pressure on developing 
countries’ governments to respect patent rights, even in cases where the rules per-
mit a developing country to break a patent. In the end, many countries simply lack 
the resources to fully implement the TRIPS agreement. Nevertheless, it remains 
an area of active interest, and has become a key focus of U.S. trade policy.

Summary
■
■Tariffs increase domestic production and employment at the cost of greater 
inefficiency and higher prices. Production and distribution effects are mea-
sured by estimating the changes in producer surplus and consumer surplus.
■
■In addition to short-run welfare and efficiency effects, tariffs have long-run 
costs of increased rent seeking, slower innovation, and the loss of export 
markets through the retaliation of trading partners.
■
■In theory, a large country can improve its welfare with tariffs. In general, 
welfare-improving tariffs tend to be small, and they improve welfare only 
if there is no retaliation by supplying nations and no external costs such as 
increased rent seeking.
■
■Economists distinguish between nominal and effective rates of protection. 
The effective rate is the difference in domestic value added with and without 
tariffs, expressed in percentage terms.
■
■Quotas have similar effects as tariffs, although the overall national losses 
are greater due to the transfer of quota rents to foreign producers. Auction 
markets, in which governments auction the right to import an item under a 
quota, can reduce the amount of quota rents and, in the limit, provide the 
same revenue as an equivalent tariff.
■
■Administratively, quotas take many forms. They can be well-specified 
quantitative restrictions on imports, negotiated limits on a trading partner’s 
exports, or requirements to obtain a license to import.
■
■Nontariff measures include a wide variety of regulations and policies that 
effectively reduce the volume of international trade. They often act as hid-
den forms of protection and are commonly embedded deeply in a country’s 
rules and institutions. Together with quotas, they make up nontariff barriers 
to trade.

INTRODUCTION: COMMERCIAL POLICY, TARIFFS, AND 
­ARGUMENTS FOR PROTECTION
Tariffs around the world have come down significantly in the last few decades, leading 
to rapid increases in the volume of world trade. Countries have converted many of their 
quotas into tariff-equivalents, and new agreements on subsidies, foreign investment, 
and intellectual property have been signed. In 2001, the World Trade Organization 
(WTO) launched the Doha Round of negotiations to bring agriculture and services into 
the system of trade agreements and to facilitate trade through infrastructure improve-
ments and new market access agreements. More than sixty years after the signing of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and eight completed rounds of 
trade negotiations, tariffs are low for most of the nonagricultural goods that make up 
the largest share of international trade. By nearly any standard, the system of trade 
rounds under the auspices of the GATT and the WTO has been successful at creating 
trade rules and reducing trade barriers.
In this chapter, we look at the data on tariff levels and consider the most 
­frequently given arguments for protection. Given that tariffs are relatively low and 
that nontariff barriers have been significantly reduced in the world’s major trad-
ing nations, diminishing returns to trade negotiations implies that the remaining 
gains from trade due to further tariff reductions are also relatively small in terms of 
world gross domestic product (GDP). Chapter 7 looks at these numbers and asks

why economists still favor further reductions in trade barriers if the gains are 
not great. There are several reasons to pursue further market openings, not 
the least of which is that the direct gains from trade are not the only way to 
judge the cost of protectionist policies. Tariffs and other barriers are usually 
implemented for a specific purpose, such as to protect jobs or to protect an 
industry, and if we want to know the opportunity costs of tariffs we need to 
consider the reasons given for their use. This naturally leads to a question as to 
whether or not there are better policies for achieving the same outcome. This 
chapter offers a deeper look into the reasons given for protection and sets forth 
criteria showing that trade barriers are not usually an optimal policy tool for 
achieving those goals.
TARIFF RATES IN THE World’s MAJOR TRADERS
LO 7.1	 Describe the differences in tariffs across economic sectors and over time.
Figure 6.4 in the previous chapter shows that tariff rates have declined significantly 
since the mid-1980s. If we extended the data back further, we would see that the 
decline has been underway since the end of World War II and especially since the 
signing of the GATT in 1947. Table 7.1 illustrates the current situation for three 
major trading countries and one region. The European Union (EU) is treated 
as a single country for purposes of comparing trade and trade policies since it 
negotiates and acts as a single entity in the WTO and in its trade relations with 
individual nations. The countries and region in Table 7.1 have about 66 percent 
of world GDP and account for 39 percent and 41 percent of world merchandise 
exports and imports, respectively.
Table 7.1 shows several patterns. First, tariffs are higher in agriculture than in 
other sectors of the economy. This is well known and applies to most but not all 
countries. Exceptions to this pattern are usually countries such as Argentina and 
Australia, which have robust, highly productive agricultural sectors and a com-
parative advantage in agricultural products. In general, however, most countries 
impose more barriers on agricultural trade. Reasons usually include consider-
ations of food security (to ensure a local capacity for food production), a desire to 
transfer income to farmers as a policy to support the countryside and rural citizens, 
and the ability of agricultural interests to shape national policies.
A second pattern in Table 7.1 is that there is overlap between countries in the 
sectors they protect most rigorously. Within agriculture, for example, dairy, sugar 
and confectionary, and beverages and tobacco receive the strongest levels of pro-
tection, while the nonagricultural sector is most protective of clothing, textiles, 
and leather goods and footwear. These tend to be labor-intensive sectors where 
high-income countries have lost comparative advantage.

164
Part 2    International Trade
A third pattern in Table 7.1 is that overall levels of tariff rates (top part of the 
table) are relatively low, particularly for nonagricultural goods and especially 
in high-income countries. If tariff cuts have diminishing marginal returns, so 
that each successive round of cuts leads to a smaller gain than the cuts before, 
it is reasonable to guess that future cuts are not likely to have a large impact on 
world trade and income. Large is relative, but thinking back to the case study of 
Japan in Chapter 3, two economists estimated that Japan’s GDP rose as much 
as 8 or 9 percent when it moved from completely closed to nearly free trade 
in the 1860s. By comparison, the value of the now moribund Doha Round of 
trade negotiations were estimated to in the range of 0.1 percent to 0.5 percent 
of world GDP, with most estimates falling about mid-range at 0.3 percent. A 
potential gain of 0.5 percent is not trivial when it comes to world GDP, but it 
is far different from the gains that accrue when countries go from relatively 
closed to open.

THE COSTS OF PROTECTIONISM
LO 7.2	 Cite at least three reasons why economists favor trade openings.
LO 7.3	 Explain why costs to consumers of a tariff or quota are greater than the 
net welfare costs to a nation.
There are several reasons why further trade opening is beneficial even if the dollar 
values of the gains are not that high. Some economists argue that the failure of 
the Doha Round of negotiations undermines the legitimacy of the world trading 
system, with potentially severe consequences in the future. Recall that one of the 
public goods of international agreements on trade is the commitment that coun-
tries keep their markets open when there is a severe downturn. This prevents con-
ditions such as those in the 1930s when each country individually decided to close 
its markets to protect import competing producers and, in the end, every country’s 
export industries suffered. During the global recession of 2007–2009, countries 
kept their markets open, and while world trade declined due to the decline in 
overall economic activity, it picked up again as soon as GDP growth returned.
Other economists argue that the usual way to estimate the gains from trade 
leaves out so many of the benefits that the numbers are not to be trusted. For 
example, some of the effects of trade that are difficult to put into monetary terms 
are the effects of economies of scale that drive down costs, the benefits of increased 
product differentiation, the impact of intensified competition, and the benefits 
of spreading risks by, for example, diversifying food sources. Ultimately, trade 
increases exposure of countries to each other, and in the process, it leads to new 
knowledge. All of these benefits are difficult to quantify, and many of them are 
extremely dependent on context. Nevertheless, it is a mistake to think that they 
are not real gains, even if our economic models cannot measure them precisely.
A third reason to consider further opening as desirable is that in most cases, 
trade protection is grossly inefficient in achieving the goals it seeks. Table 7.2 
­illustrates this point with estimates of the costs to consumers and net national wel-
fare loss (deadweight losses) per job saved in the mid-1990s. The table compares 
the EU, Japan, and the United States in clothing, textiles, and agriculture. The 
estimates are the dollar value (mid-1990s prices) of areas a, b, c, and d in Figure 
6.3 in Chapter 6, divided by a separate estimate of the number of jobs saved. 
As shown, the total cost to consumers in each sector is significant. This cost is 
equivalent to a tax since it raises the domestic price of the goods with tariffs (and/
or quotas) and redistributes the income to producers and government.
The net national welfare loss per job saved is smaller since it is a subset of the 
impacts of tariffs and quotas on consumers. It is still high in a few areas, however, 
such as clothing in the United States. Given that a full-time garment worker in 
the U.S. apparel industry averaged around $15,000 per year in the mid-1990s, a 
net welfare loss to the nation of $55,615 per job saved is a very inefficient way to 
protect employment. Furthermore, the cost to consumers of $138,666 to save a job 
that pays $15,000 is so exorbitantly expensive that it could only be tolerated when 

166
Part 2    International Trade
consumers are unaware of the price tag. Fortunately, since the period covered by 
the data in Table 7.2, tariffs have come down significantly and many quotas have 
been eliminated.
This exercise is not useful for understanding the role of agriculture in national 
culture, nor the effects of keeping strong garment and textile manufacturing sectors. 
It is useful, however, for uncovering some of the hidden costs of tariffs and quotas 
and it adds to our understanding of the real tradeoffs we face when we turn to 
protectionism. Agriculture, clothing, and textiles are singled out because they have 
higher levels of protectionism and because they are sectors that many developing 
countries use to start their own development process. In the final analysis, Table 7.2 
simply says that trade protectionism is a very expensive policy for protecting jobs.
The Logic of Collective Action
Given that the costs to consumers are so high for each job saved, why do people 
tolerate tariffs and quotas? Ignorance is certainly the case for some goods, but 
for others, the costs of protectionism have been relatively well publicized. For 
example, many people are aware that quotas on sugar imports cost each man, 
woman, and child in the United States between $5 and $10 per year. The costs

are in the form of higher prices on candy bars, soft drinks, and other products 
containing sugar. Few of us work in the sugar industry, so the argument that our 
jobs depend on keeping tariffs in place is not valid for most people.
In a surprising way, however, we probably permit our tariffs and quotas because 
of a version of the jobs argument. The economist Mancur Olson studied this prob-
lem and similar ones and noticed two important points about tariffs and quotas. 
First, the costs of the policy are spread over a great many people. Second, the 
benefits are concentrated. For example, we all pay a little more for sweets and 
soft drinks, but a few sugar producers reap large benefits from our restrictions on 
sugar imports. Olson found that in cases such as this, there is an asymmetry in the 
incentives to support and to oppose the policy. With trade protection, the benefits 
are concentrated in a single industry and, consequently, it pays for the industry to 
commit resources to obtaining or maintaining its protection. The industry will hire 
lobbyists and perhaps participate directly in the political process through running 
candidates or supporting friendly candidates. If people in the industry think their 
entire livelihood depends on their ability to limit foreign competition, they have 
a very large incentive to become involved in setting policy.
The costs of protection are nowhere near as concentrated as the benefits 
because they are spread over all consumers of a product. The $5 to $10 per year 
that sugar quotas cost each of us is hardly worth hiring a lobbyist or protesting 
in Washington. Thus, one side pushes hard to obtain or keep protection, and the 
other side is silent on the matter. Given this imbalance, it is a wonder that there 
are not more trade barriers.

Agricultural Subsidies
Agricultural issues have long sparked conflict among the members of the WTO. 
Some cases have pitted high-income countries against each other, among them 
are disputes between the United States and Japan over apples and EU-U.S. dis-
putes over bananas. More recently, the WTO’s Doha Development Agenda has 
tried to address agricultural issues that are central to relations between devel-
oping and industrial countries. In particular, three issues are on the table: tariffs 
and quotas (market access), export subsidies given by countries to encourage 
farm exports, and production subsidies granted directly to farmers.
Direct subsidies are viewed as harmful because they lead to overproduction, 
squeeze out imports, and in some cases result in the dumping of the surplus 
product in foreign markets. The original GATT included language on agricul-
ture, but there were so many loopholes that it had little impact. Not until the 
Uruguay Round was finalized in 1993, nearly fifty years after the signing of 
the original GATT, were significant changes made in the rules for agricultural 
trade. Many quotas were converted to tariffs, and industrial countries agreed

to reduce their direct support for the farm sector by 20 percent. Indirect sup-
ports such as research and development and infrastructure construction were 
recognized as necessary, desirable, and permissible.
While direct-support payments were reduced, the Uruguay Round left 
intact direct payments to farmers that theoretically do not increase produc-
tion, are part of a country’s environmental or regional development plan, or 
are intended to limit production. If you think these are a lot of loopholes, you 
are right. Consequently, the current round of trade negotiations, the Doha 
Development Agenda, has taken up the issue of agriculture again, and develop-
ing countries in particular are pushing to limit government practices that block 
their access to markets in high-income countries or that subsidize production 
by industrial countries.
Table 7.3 shows the range of direct-support payments to agricultural pro-
ducers in several industrial nations. The twenty-seven members of the EU are 
grouped together because their trade and agricultural policies are formulated 
at the EU level, not at the national level. In terms of absolute support, the EU 
spends the most, but Japan’s farmers depend more on subsidies since 49.2 per-
cent of farm receipts are from government support programs. Not all countries 
subsidize agriculture, however. As a share of GDP, Australia’s supports are 
less than one-fourth those of the United States, and despite its lower support 
levels, Australia uses its comparative advantages to be among the top fifteen 
agricultural exporting countries in the world.
The impact of these subsidies on developing countries is not easy to 
­generalize as it depends on the individual country and its factor endowments. 
In the case of sub-Saharan cotton producers such as Mali and Benin, subsidies 
given by high-income governments to cotton farmers increase the world’s sup-
ply of cotton and reduce its price, so the subsidies are clearly harmful. (See 
the case study in Chapter 3.) Similarly, subsidies to U.S. corn producers have 

Chapter 7    Commercial Policy 
169
increased the supply of corn in Mexico and driven down the prices received 
by that country’s small farmers, who operate near subsistence levels. This has 
contributed to a crisis in the rural sector of Mexico and reduces the demand 
for agricultural implements and household items that a prosperous rural class 
might otherwise buy from local producers.
On the other hand, subsidies given by high-income countries to support 
their farmers will lead to cheaper world food prices, all other factors being 
equal. This benefits some countries where there is a large urban working 
class. For example, many young Chinese farmers have migrated to the cities 
where they work in factories. Given that the productivity of these individuals 
in agriculture is very low, the country as a whole gains when they become city 
­dwellers and factory workers, while cheaper food makes life easier and raises 
living standards. As a result, agricultural subsidies in high-income countries 
benefit China and some other developing countries.
WHY NATIONS PROTECT THEIR INDUSTRIES
LO 7.4	 Analyze the economic validity of common justifications for protectionism.
Trade protectionism is used in different times and places to achieve a variety of 
potential goals. Very few countries have zero tariffs across all industries (Hong 
Kong is the only country, although some others such as Singapore have very few 
and very low tariffs), but many countries have low tariffs, as shown in Table 7.1and 
Figure 6.4. Other countries have tariffs but do not use them to achieve any goal 
besides adding to government revenue. Chile, for example, decided not to use 
the tariff for commercial policy reasons and has a uniform tariff of 6 percent 
across all sectors. Uniformity means that no sector is favored more than another 
and resources are not drawn to any particular sector due to a tariff. In general, 
the reasons given for using trade protectionism can be grouped into six catego-
ries: revenue, jobs, industrial targeting, cultural protection, national security, and 
retaliation against unfair trade practices.
Revenue
In a developing country’s economy, a large percentage of economic activity is 
unrecorded. Subsistence farmers sell their surplus in the town market, and repair-
men and craftsmen take on jobs without leaving a paper trail of work orders or 
receipts. In this environment, income taxes and sales taxes are difficult if not 
impossible to impose. Tariffs, on the other hand, can be relatively easily collected 
by inspectors at the ports and border crossings. They simply have to value the 
goods coming in and levy a fee (the tariff) on the person transporting the goods. 
The United States is a case in point, as tariff revenues were the single greatest 
source of income for the U.S. government until well into the twentieth century.

170
Part 2    International Trade
Table 7.4 shows the percent of government revenue that is provided by tariffs. 
The data are arranged by income level, with two examples for each income cat-
egory. Table 7.4 shows the general pattern that tariffs become less important as a 
source of government revenue as income grows and other sources become avail-
able. The worldwide pattern is much more variable than shown in the table, but 
the general point about the diminishing importance of tariffs for revenue is valid.
The Labor Argument
The labor argument is a perennial justification for trade barriers. It was used 
throughout the nineteenth century, and recently it has been resurrected by many 
opponents of expanded trade agreements. The argument states that nations must 
protect their markets against imports from countries where wages are much lower 
because otherwise the advantage of lower wages will either wreck the domestic 
industry or force it to match the lower wages. For example, in the debate lead-
ing up to the ratification of North American Free Trade Agreement, opponents 
argued that Mexico would have an unfair advantage in trade with the United 
States because Mexican firms pay their workers a fraction (on average, about 
one-eighth) of the wages paid to American workers.
The labor argument fails to consider productivity differences. Mexican workers, 
for example, earn about one-eighth of the salary of U.S. workers because their 
productivity, on average, is about one-eighth of the level of U.S. workers. Mexico 
has lower productivity because the education and skill levels of its workforce are 
less than in the United States, Mexican workers have less capital at work than U.S. 
workers, and the infrastructure of the Mexican economy is not as developed as 
the U.S. infrastructure. As Mexican workers gain more skills and education, and 
as the capital available on the job and in the surrounding economy increases, their 
productivity will rise, and so will their wages.

If the goal is an adequate number of jobs to reach full employment, then appro-
priate macroeconomic and labor market policies are better instruments. Monetary 
and fiscal policies (see Chapter 11) that maintain economic growth, and labor mar-
ket policies that provide adjustment assistance to dislocated workers and incen-
tives for employers to hire them are far less expensive than trade policy for this 
purpose. If the goal is to keep a particular sector alive, then direct subsidies to the 
producers are preferable because they do not have the distortions that result from 
forcing consumers out of the market.
The Infant Industry Argument
A much more sophisticated argument for protection is the infant industry 
­argument. The argument is mainly associated with the tariff policies of develop-
ing nations that protect their “infant” industries against the competition of more 
mature firms in industrial countries.The infant industry argument for protection 
is very similar to the arguments for industrial policy that were given in Chapter 5. 
Two beliefs lie at the root of the infant industry argument. The first is that market 
forces will not support the development of a particular industry, usually because 
foreign competition is too well established, but also possibly because the industry 
is too risky. The second belief is that the industry in question has some spillover 
benefits, or positive externalities, that make the industry more valuable to the 
national economy than simply the wages and profits it might generate. Whenever 
there are spillover benefits, the market may not support the development of an 
industry to the optimum level. With positive externalities, many of the benefits 
of production are captured by other firms or individuals outside the producing 
firm. Since the producers do not get the full benefit of their own production, they 
produce less than the amount that is most beneficial for society.
Positive externalities are usually argued to be in the form of linkages to other 
industries or of a technological nature. As an example of the linkage case, many 
nations have attempted to start their own steel industries because they assumed it 
would create a cheaper source of steel for other industries, such as cars. The prob-
lem with this argument is that it does not demonstrate that there is some inherent 
advantage in making something as opposed to buying it, or in other words, that the 
car industry will have a special advantage if it can buy steel from local producers. 
If the car industry is forced to buy locally at prices above world levels, protection 
of the domestic steel industry may actually harm the car ­industry. This is what hap-
pened to firms in Brazil when the government tried to start a domestic computer 
industry by keeping out foreign producers. The policy had negative linkage effects 
on Brazilian businesses because they had to pay higher prices for computers that 
were of lower quality. Brazil would have been better off importing its computers, 
as it does now.
Even if externalities are present, it is not enough to establish the validity of the 
infant industry argument. Two more conditions must hold. First, the protection 
that is offered must be limited in time, and second, the protected industry must 
experience falling costs. The time limits on protection ensure that the industry 
does not become a permanent recipient of transfers from consumers, while the 

172
Part 2    International Trade
presence of falling costs ensures that the policy will eventually pay for itself and 
that the industry will become competitive.
The National Security Argument
Every nation protects some industries as a way to guard its national security. The most 
obvious examples include weapons industries, and somewhat more broadly, strategic 
technologies. Most countries refuse to trade military technologies or weapons with 
potential adversaries, and some nations also include strategic minerals that have spe-
cialized uses in military hardware such as jet aircraft. Prohibitions imposed on exports 
or tariffs on imports to develop domestic mineral or other resources are often not an 
optimal policy. Usually it is more efficient to build stockpiles of minerals and other 
materials by buying large quantities in peacetime when they are less expensive.
The Cultural Protection Argument
The cultural industries include movies, television programming, music, print 
media, theater, and art. Some nations worry that if they allow completely free 
trade in the cultural industries, then the most commercially viable firms will domi-
nate, and the cultural values of the home country will be obscured and forgotten. 
Since the United States has the strongest presence in much of the entertainment 
industry, the goal of protecting national cultural values is usually an argument in 
favor of protecting a nation’s filmmaking, television programming, and music pro-
duction against domination by its U.S. counterparts. For example, the precursor 
to the North American Free Trade Agreement, called the Canadian-United States 
Free Trade Agreement (signed in 1988), established Canada’s right to require its 
television and radio stations to broadcast a certain proportion of Canadian-pro-
duced programs. There are similar requirements in music, theater, and the print 
media. U.S. television and movie producers naturally opposed this limitation on 
free trade and demanded the right to sell an unlimited amount of U.S.-produced 
entertainment. They lost this argument, however, and they lost again when the 
Uruguay Round of the GATT was signed. It allows all nations to place similar 
restrictions on their film, television, and other cultural industries.
A more complicated assessment involves protection of noncultural industries 
for cultural reasons. An example illustrates this point. France and some other 
EU members argue that their high levels of agricultural protection are justified 
as a rural development and maintenance policy. Without barriers on agricultural 
imports, parts of the countryside would go into economic decline since many farms 
would be unprofitable, rural communities would be abandoned, and the cultural 
heritage of the nation would be injured. Is this a clever protectionist argument, or 
a valid, noneconomic reason for trade barriers? It is hard to tell.
The Retaliation Argument
A final category of reasons given by nations to justify trade barriers is retaliation 
for unfair trade practices. When a country decides that another country’s trade 
practices unfairly discriminate against it, a common response is to impose a trade 

Chapter 7    Commercial Policy 
173
barrier. Retaliatory tariffs and quotas can provide an incentive for negotiations, 
but they can also lead to escalating trade wars.
Economic analysis is of limited utility in understanding this situation, since the 
outcome depends on political processes that determine how nations respond to pres-
sure, their willingness to negotiate, and the outcome of negotiations. There are three 
camps of economists on this issue. One camp argues that free trade is beneficial 
regardless of the actions of a country’s trading partners. If other countries choose 
to protect their markets, this argument goes, then it lowers their standard of living, 
and it would be foolish to do the same by imposing trade barriers in retaliation. 
Another camp argues that since free trade is beneficial, it is in everyone’s interest to 
see it followed as widely as possible. Therefore, if a tariff today causes other nations 
to open their markets tomorrow, the world economy will benefit in the long run.
A third group argues that countries that have a closed market or that restrict 
market access by imposing barriers to trade have an unfair advantage, particularly 
in high-technology products. They have a domestic market all to themselves, and 
they can compete freely in other markets that are more open than their own. In 
cases where the size of the market is important, the ability to sell to a larger mar-
ket (home plus foreign) than a competitor’s may give the firms in the protected 
markets a competitive advantage. If firms in the open market are forced out of 
business, then the technology, skills, and expertise that go with them will exist only 
in the firms from the country that adopted the strategy of protecting its market. 
To ensure that this scenario does not play out and to avoid losing critical technolo-
gies, some would argue that the threat of retaliation should be used to force open 
markets that currently are closed.

Traditional Knowledge and 
Intellectual Property
Traditional knowledge forms part of the cultural heritage of traditional socie­
ties and indigenous communities. This knowledge, often embedded in cultural 
practices and everyday activities as a part of a world view and cultural life, can 
also embody intellectual knowledge of plants, animals, and the natural world, 
gathered over generations. Those who practice Chinese traditional medicine, 
traditional healers in indigenous cultures, small-scale farmers, and hunters and 
gatherers have knowledge of plants and animals that has commercial potential. 
When that knowledge is expropriated and used by outsiders without recogni-
tion of its origin, it is not only unfair to the originators of the knowledge but 
also could harm them.
For example, U.S. researchers asked for a patent on turmeric, a spice that is 
effective in healing skin cuts and lesions. Turmeric is the bright yellow ingredient 
(continued)

174
Part 2    International Trade
used in curries and other dishes, and it has been used for over four thousand years 
in traditional Indian medicine. Nevertheless, Patent No. 5,401,504 was granted 
by the U.S. Patent Office to the University of Mississippi for its use as a healing 
agent. As a practical matter, the patent probably would have been unenforce-
able, but it might have imposed a legal requirement on users to pay royalties. The 
Indian government protested, arguing that it was a part of their traditional knowl-
edge base and that it had long been used as a healing agent in India. After they 
produced ancient Sanskrit texts describing its use, the patent was overturned.
Brazil and India are foremost among a group of tropical countries work-
ing to protect their traditional knowledge and their biodiversity. One fear is 
that “bio-prospectors” will collect plant samples shown to them by traditional 
healers in indigenous communities, isolate the key compounds in their labora-
tories, patent new pharmaceuticals, and ignore the interests of the traditional 
community or the nation where they live.
Traditional healers in Samoa use the bark of the mamala tree for a variety of 
medicinal purposes, including combating hepatitis. After observing this prac-
tice, researchers discovered that it was an effective agent for making prostratin, 
an anti-AIDS compound. This story appears to end well since revenue from the 
development of the drug is expected to be shared with the village and the fami-
lies that assisted in its discovery and used for further AIDS research. Without 
aggressive enforcement and vigilance, it is feared that traditional knowledge 
will not be recognized and respected.
In another example, new plant varieties are adapted from traditional ones 
and patented by a seed company. In the African nation of Mali, the Bela com-
munity uses a wild rice that is more resistant to blight and other crop-destroy-
ing diseases. Researchers from the University of California, Davis, were able 
to clone the gene responsible and use it to strengthen some varieties of rice. 
They patented this gene, which raises the question of the connection between 
the new, genetically modified rice with the blight-resistant gene, and the inter-
ests of the Bela people. In the end, a Genetic Resource Recognition Fund was 
created to pay for fellowships for agricultural students from Mali and other 
countries where the wild rice grows.
Given the potential stakes, both monetary and cultural, many international 
organizations take an active interest in these issues. Among the most visible are 
the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the International Union 
for the Protection of New Plant Varieties (UPOV), the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO), the WTO, the United Nations Development Program 
(UNDP), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations 
Environmental Program (UNEP). There are many international agreements, 
but the issues are relatively new, and it is an area of international law that will 
continue to evolve over time.

THE POLITICS OF PROTECTION IN THE UNITED STATES
LO 7.5	 Define each form of legal protection granted by the U.S. government.
Although U.S. trade with the rest of the world has grown, political pressures to 
protect domestic industries have frequently been intense. One reason for this 
is that Congressional reforms removed some of the insulation from industry 
lobbyists that Congress enjoyed in the 1950s and 1960s. Another reason stems 
from the end of the Cold War and the lessening of U.S. willingness to sacrifice 
trade issues for the sake of maintaining close geopolitical alliances. A third 
reason is the rise of the export-oriented East Asian newly industrializing coun-
tries (NICs), including China, and the pressure they have put on a number of 
domestic U.S. industries. Finally, the growth of the U.S. trade deficit and the 
widespread fear in the 1980s that the United States had lost its competitive edge 
also contributed to a greater reluctance to open U.S. markets without reciprocity 
by other countries. More recently, the rapid increase of the U.S. trade deficit and 
the loss of manufacturing jobs since 2000 are conditions likely to bring back the 
competition fears of the 1980s. For each of these reasons, trade conflicts have 
intensified.
Protection in the United States is usually obtained through direct action by 
the president (for example, the Voluntary Export Restraints [VERs] on Japanese 
autos in the 1980s) or through one of the following different legal procedures:
■
■Antidumping duties
■
■Countervailing duties
■
■Escape clause relief
■
■Section 301 retaliation
In each case, a firm, an industry trade association, or a government agency may 
petition the federal government to initiate an investigation into a foreign country’s 
or foreign firm’s practices.
Antidumping Duties
An antidumping duty (ADD) is a tariff levied on an import that is selling at a price 
below the product’s fair value. This is the most common form of protection used 
by countries, including the United Sates, in part because the determination of fair 
value introduces an element of subjectivity into the process of justifying an anti-
dumping duty and it makes it easier for a firm or an industry to justify a complaint 
against a foreign firm or industry. Since 1985, the United States has imposed an 
average of twenty-one new antidumping duties per year. Consequently, antidump-
ing duties have become a source of significant trade tension between countries; 
unsurprisingly, many countries would like to strengthen the WTO’s rules regard-
ing antidumping duties by making them harder to apply.
The WTO does not regulate dumping or antidumping duties, but it does try to 
establish what countries can and cannot do when they retaliate against dumping. 

176
Part 2    International Trade
According to the WTO rules, dumping occurs when an exporter sells a product 
at a price below what it charges in its home market. It is not always possible to 
compare the home market and foreign market prices, however, and wholesalers, 
transportation costs, and other price add-ons may limit the comparison’s useful-
ness. Therefore, two other methods may be used to determine whether a good is 
being dumped. Comparisons can be made between the price in the import market 
and either the price charged in third-country markets, or to an estimate of the 
cost of production. Comparison to prices in third-country markets is similar to 
that between prices in the exporter’s home market and the importer’s market, 
and it may be uninformative for the same reasons. A comparison of the import 
price and the estimated cost of production, including a normal rate of return on 
invested capital, assumes that production costs in an exporting country can be 
measured with accuracy.
One final criterion must be met before antidumping duties are allowed. The 
country claiming dumping must also be able to show that the dumping has caused 
material injury to its firms. If dumping occurs, but there are no harmful effects on 
domestic firms, then antidumping duties are not allowed. This would happen if 
the dumping margin is too small to matter.
At their most basic level, antidumping duties are a tool of commercial policy 
that protects against predatory pricing by foreign firms. Selling below cost as a 
strategy to drive the competition out of business is widely perceived as unfair, 
and allowing it to happen can harm the economic interest of a country. This is 
particularly likely if it results in higher prices after the domestic producers have 
been driven out of the market.
Problems arise, however, because the economic theory and the legal definition 
are not completely in agreement. First, in order for a firm to sell in a foreign mar-
ket at a price below its cost of production, it must have market power at home that 
allows it to earn higher-than-normal profits so it can subsidize its foreign sales. A 
firm that is not earning above-average profits somewhere cannot maintain a price 
that is below its cost somewhere else. Yet, when countries investigate a dumping 
complaint, market structure is rarely considered. This problem is compounded 
by the use of estimated production costs to determine dumping, since estimated 
values require some guesswork about technology and other inputs, and this creates 
a significant margin of error.
Second, within the scope of normal commercial operations, firms often sell 
below cost. The most obvious case is that of goods that are likely to spoil. A fresh 
fish exporter with a load sitting on a dock is likely to lower the price progressively 
as time passes. In this case, the cost of producing the shipment of fish represents 
sunk costs that have already been incurred, and the only option is to sell the goods 
for whatever is possible. Firms also sell selected items below cost as a technique for 
penetrating markets. This is similar to the behavior of large retail chains that offer 
some goods at an extremely low price to create a reputation as a value-oriented 
retailer. Finally, firms will sell for extended periods at prices that do not cover 
the cost of their capital and other fixed costs as long as the costs of their variable 
inputs such as labor and materials are covered. Since capital costs such as interest 

Chapter 7    Commercial Policy 
177
on loans have to be paid no matter what is produced, in the short run, the chief 
consideration is whether the price is high enough to cover labor and material input 
costs. In the long run, a firm that cannot sell at a high enough price to meet its capi-
tal costs will have to shut down; in the short run, however, it continues to produce.
The increasing use of antidumping duties has generated much interest in defin-
ing their usage more carefully. As things now stand, countries vary widely in their 
application of these duties and their willingness to negotiate their usage. Some 
countries rarely apply them, and some trade agreements, such as the one between 
Canada and Chile, ban their usage except under exceptional circumstances. Other 
countries use them frequently—often it seems, as a politically expedient way to 
satisfy an important industry lobbying group.
In the United States, the procedure for firms to obtain protection requires filing 
a petition with the International Trade Administration (ITA) in the Department 
of Commerce. The ITA investigates whether dumping (or subsidization in the 
case of a petition for countervailing duties) has occurred. If its finding is positive 
(dumping has occurred), the case is turned over to the United States International 
Trade Commission (USITC), an independent regulatory commission. The USITC 
conducts an additional investigation to determine whether substantial harm has 
been done to the domestic industry and so an antidumping or countervailing duty 
is warranted. The relative success of U.S. firms in proving that foreign companies 
are dumping has encouraged a growing number of antidumping petitions in recent 
years.
Countervailing Duties
A countervailing duty (CVD) is a tariff that is granted to an industry that has been 
hurt by foreign country subsidies of its national firms. Since subsidies permit a 
firm to sell its goods at a lower price and still make a profit, an effect of subsidies 
is to make firms more competitive. The goal of a CVD is to raise the price of the 
foreign good enough to countervail the effect of the subsidy. The idea is to level 
the playing field between domestic firms that receive no subsidies and foreign 
ones that do.
CVDs are used less often than antidumping duties. In the United States, there 
have been, on average, four to five cases per year since 1985. CVDs require a 
clear definition of a subsidy since they are intended to counteract the effects of 
subsidies. One of the benefits of the Uruguay Round is that it standardized the 
definition as a financial contribution by a government (national or local) or pub-
lic agency that confers a benefit. Subsidies take on a variety of forms, including 
grants, low-interest loans, preferential tax treatments, provision of goods or ser-
vices for free or below cost, or any of a number of other financial benefits.
Escape Clause Relief
Escape clause relief is so named because it refers to a clause in the U.S. and GATT 
trade rules that permits an industry to escape the pressure of imports by temporar-
ily imposing a tariff. Escape clause relief is a temporary tariff imposed on imports 

178
Part 2    International Trade
to provide a period of adjustment to a domestic industry. It is initiated when an 
industry or firm petitions the USITC directly for relief from a sudden surge of 
imports. The burden of escape clause relief is on the firm; it must establish that it 
has been harmed by imports and not by some other factor, such as bad manage-
ment decisions. In practice, it has become so difficult to obtain relief from import 
competition under this procedure that few cases are filed.
Section 301 and Special 301
Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 requires the president’s chief trade 
negotiator, the United States Trade Representative (USTR), to take action 
against any nation that persistently engages in unfair trade practices. The action 
usually begins with a request for negotiations with the targeted country. The goal 
of the negotiations is to change the policies of countries that restrict U.S. com-
merce unreasonably or unjustifiably. Note that it is left to the United States to 
define unreasonable and unjustifiable restrictions on U.S. commerce.
The types of trade practices that the USTR is required to investigate are quite broad. 
Recent cases have included an investigation of China’s management of its exchange 
rate, Ukraine’s actions to enforce intellectual property rights, and the EU’s lack of 
compliance with a WTO ruling against its blockage of imports of hormone-fed beef.
A similar program to Section 301 is known as Special 301. This part of U.S. trade 
law requires the USTR to monitor property rights enforcement around the globe. 
In 2005, the USTR surveyed ninety countries and identified fifty-two as lacking 
adequate enforcement or as denying market access to U.S. artists and industries 
that rely on intellectual property enforcement. Inclusion on this list means that the 
USTR has some concerns and will continue to monitor the situation.
C A S E  S T U D Y
Economic Sanctions
Economic sanctions are a form of trade restriction. Unlike tariffs and quotas, 
which affect imports alone, sanctions are often put on exports as well as imports 
and may include financial components as well. Access to international credit 
through privately owned banks or international lending agencies may be lim-
ited or blocked, as may investment by domestic firms in the country singled out 
for sanctions. The international sanctions against Iran, which ended in 2016, 
is the best known recent example. There are many other examples, including 
export prohibitions by the United States during the Cold War that limited 
computer sales to the Soviet Union, and the continuing prohibitions on selling 
goods or services to Cuba and North Korea. The world community’s boycott of 
investment in South Africa before the ending of apartheid is another example 
of a comprehensive investment and trade sanction, similar to the recently dis-
mantled sanctions against Iran.

International Economics.
TABLE 7.5  Economic Sanctions Since World War I
Economic sanctions go beyond simple trade or investment measures. In 
most cases, they are used as one of several tactics aimed at achieving a broader 
policy objective—the ending of Soviet expansion, Iranian nuclear weapons 
ambitions, or South African apartheid. Another feature of sanctions is that 
they are often accompanied by additional measures, ranging from diplomatic 
pressure to military invasion.
The logical question to ask about sanctions is “Do they work?” In an impor-
tant two-volume study of this question, three economists analyzed 120 episodes 
of economic sanctions throughout the world between World War I and 1990; 
Table 7.5 summarizes their findings. The economists found it useful to catego-
rize the goals of sanctions into five separate groups: those designed to create a 
relatively modest policy change (for example, to free a political prisoner or to 
limit nuclear proliferation); those intended to destabilize a government; those 
aimed at disrupting a military adventure of another nation (for example, stop-
ping Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait); those designed to impair another nation’s mili-
tary potential; and a fifth category of other goals, such as stopping apartheid, 
or the Arab League’s boycott of oil sales to the United States in retaliation for 
support of Israel.
To be classified as a success, the policy outcome must have been the one 
desired by the country imposing the sanctions, and the sanctions must have 
been a contributor to the policy outcome. Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliott find 
41 successes in the 120 cases they examined, but they report a drop in the num-
ber of successes after about 1973. They determined that sanctions are more 
effective when the target country is small, economically weak, and politically 
unstable. Also, success is more likely when the target country is an ally; sanc-
tions are imposed quickly and decisively; the costs to the sending country are 
small; and the goal is a relatively small change.
The more difficult the goal, the more likely military force is needed to back 
up the sanctions. The U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 is a case in point. United

Summary
■
■Regardless of their cost or their ability to achieve a desired objective, every 
nation uses trade barriers. In most industrial nations, they are not used to 
develop comparative advantage in new industries, but rather to protect old 
industries that can no longer compete or to temporarily protect industries 
that are under pressure from new competitors. Agriculture, clothing, and 
textiles are the most protected sectors in many industrial countries.
■
■Tariffs and quotas are inefficient mechanisms for creating (or keeping) jobs. 
Because the costs are hidden in the prices consumers pay for foreign and 
domestic goods, few people realize how inefficient they are.
■
■The primary beneficiaries of trade barriers are producers who receive protec-
tion and governments that receive tariff revenue. The losers are ­consumers. 
Because the gains are concentrated among a relatively few people, and the 
losses are dispersed across many, there is usually a small economic incentive 
to oppose trade barriers but a large incentive to seek them.
■
■The valid arguments in favor of protection involve economic returns to soci-
ety that are undervalued or not counted by markets. That is, it must be the 
case that the market does not take into consideration the gains that spill over 
from production. The total value of producing a good, including any spill-
overs, is extremely difficult to measure, however, and it is often impossible to 
know the future value of the skills or technology that an industry will create.
■
■In addition to presidential action, there are several forms of protection in 
the United States: countervailing duties to counter a foreign subsidy, anti-
dumping duties to counter dumping of foreign goods, escape clause relief 
to counter an import surge, and Section 301 actions to retaliate against 
foreign trade practices that have been labeled as unfair. Except for escape 
clause relief, each type of tariff requires a demonstration that foreign prod-
ucts are competing unfairly in the U.S. market and that they have harmed 
domestic producers. The most common form of tariff imposition is an anti-
dumping duty.
Nations sanctions against Iraq undoubtedly helped to cripple its economy, 
even though the sanctions were never enforced completely. In that sense, they 
contributed to the success of U.S. policy in replacing Iraq’s government. Still, 
without a military invasion, it seems unlikely that the sanctions alone would 
have led to a change of government.

INTRODUCTION: INCOME AND STANDARDS
Since the end of World War II, many of the formal barriers to international trade have 
been removed. This was accomplished through the sustained efforts of the world’s 
trading nations, often working through the negotiating frameworks provided by the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the World Trade Organization 
(WTO), and more recently, the regional trade agreements around the globe.
As trade barriers are removed, however, new obstacles to increased international 
economic integration begin to appear. In Chapter 1, this was described as obstacles 
to deep integration. These obstacles are driven by two distinct but equally impor-
tant forces. First, it sometimes happens that national laws and regulations adopted 
for strictly domestic reasons unintentionally limit international commerce in a more 
integrated economic environment. For example, a law designed to capture economies 
of scale by giving one company a monopoly in telephone services makes it impossible 
for foreign telephone companies to enter the market.
A second obstacle to increased international economic integration is the conflict 
over standards. These include differences in technical product standards, health and 
safety standards, labor and environmental standards, and legal systems. For example, 
the adoption of a common set of product standards gives a significant commercial

advantage to firms already producing to the standard, and hence, each country 
would like to see wider application of its own standards. In addition to commercial 
incentives, many of the conflicts over standards result from the wide variation 
in world income levels. Trade between high- and low-income countries is usu-
ally based on comparative advantage that moves countries along their production 
possibility curves, causing greater specialization in production. Although each 
nation’s gains from trade may be large, greater specialization creates winners and 
losers inside each country and raises questions of fairness.
Economic conditions and living standards inside low-income countries are 
vastly different from conditions inside middle- or high-income economies and, in 
particular, lower wages, longer hours, less safe working conditions, dirtier indus-
tries, and less regard for environmental degradation are relatively more common 
in low-income economies than in high-income ones. When trade occurs between 
countries with different living standards, people begin to wonder about the inex-
pensive goods they import from low-income countries. Does their production 
exploit children, are working conditions safe and healthy, do workers have politi-
cal and civil rights, and are the methods employed environmentally friendly? If 
not, can trade barriers such as tariffs, quotas, or complete prohibition of imports 
effectively pressure the exporting country into changing its practices?
SETTING STANDARDS: HARMONIZATION, MUTUAL 
­RECOGNITION, OR SEPARATE?
LO 8.1	 Compare and contrast the three options for setting standards in trade rules.
LO 8.2	 Give examples of the relationship between income levels and 
environmental and labor problems.
Two or more economies can be deeply integrated even if they have different rules, 
regulations, and standards governing their individual economies. The United 
States is an obvious example, since individual states impose different standards 
on vehicle emissions, minimum wages, teacher training, food safety, construction 
codes, and product availability, to name just a few. Lesser forms of integration 
between sovereign nations, such as partial trade agreements, free-trade areas, 
customs unions, and common markets, are likely to vary even more with respect 
to rules, regulations, and standards.
Harmonization of product and process standards is one of the three options 
for countries seeking to expand their commercial ties. Harmonization of 
­standards refers to the case where two or more countries share a common set 
of standards in an area of concern, such as product safety, labor, environment, 
fair competition, and so on. Another option is mutual recognition of standards, 
in which countries keep their own product and process standards, but accept 
the standards of others as equally valid and sufficient. For example, a physician 

184
Part 2    International Trade
trained in a foreign country may not receive the same training as physicians in 
the home country, but under a system of mutual recognition he or she would 
be certified to practice in either country. A third option is separate standards. 
In this case, countries keep their own standards and refuse to recognize those 
of anyone else. For example, if the home country has a more stringent rule for 
pesticide residue on vegetables after harvest, separate standards might prohibit 
imports that are considered unsafe. Most regional trade agreements and the 
WTO agreements practice a combination of harmonization, mutual recognition, 
and separate standards.
There are no general rules to determine which approach is most efficient or 
fairest in all cases. Often, the harmonization of technical standards having to do 
with product design or performance is useful since it leads to a larger, more uni-
fied market and creates greater efficiency since firms have to consider only one 
set of standards. Simple examples such as vehicle emissions or the definition of 
organic produce illustrate cases where harmonization unifies a market and creates 
efficiency gains in production for the economy. In other cases, harmonization of 
standards may conceivably freeze into a set of inferior standards. New technolo-
gies are a prime example, since the evolution of new products and processes is 
impossible to forecast, and freezing technical standards into legal requirements 
may have a harmful effect on future developments. In addition, there are many 
areas such as labor or environmental legislation where it is unclear which country 
has the “best” rules. Mutual recognition is a superior option under these condi-
tions, as it allows competition between different standards and may help clarify 
the costs and benefits of each one.
Harmonization of standards sometimes poses an additional problem in 
its failure to take into account the differences between countries. Generally 
speaking, the lower a country’s average income, the less administrative, scien-
tific, and technical capacity it has to design and enforce standards. In addition, 
national priorities change as income levels change, and there is no reason why 
the ­priorities of one group of countries should dominate. Differences in income 
levels are not always an obstacle to the harmonization of standards, however, 
because many product standards are technical considerations where adopting 
a common set of rules makes a great deal of sense if it widens the market and 
lowers the prices.
When countries vary significantly in their income levels, it is generally better 
to mutually recognize each other’s standards, or if that is not possible for safety 
or other reasons, to maintain separate standards. While trade theory is clear on 
this point, many people living in high-income countries find it hard to accept, 
particularly with respect to labor and environmental standards. Many fear that in 
the absence of a common set of labor and environmental standards, low standards 
abroad create competitive pressures for domestic firms to lower their standards, 
or to move to a foreign location in order to reduce their costs. This possibility has 
been labeled as race to the bottom, where the bottom is the lowest possible level 
of standards. In the following sections, we examine this issue and others in the 
context of labor and environmental standards.

Income, Environment, and Society
The World Bank uses four categories to classify the countries of the world 
according to their income levels. High-income countries have per capita 
incomes (2014, U.S. dollars) of $12,736 or more, upper-middle-income coun-
tries range between $4,126 and $12,735 per person, lower-middle-income coun-
tries range between $1,046 and $4,125 per person, and low-income countries 
have per capita incomes of $1,045 or less.
Table 8.1 shows the number of countries, population, and average income 
per person for each of the four categories of income. In 2014, just under 
­one-half of the world’s population was low- or lower- middle-income. Income 
differences of the magnitude shown in Table 8.1 inevitably create significant 
differences in social and environmental indicators, as shown in Table 8.2.
Table 8.2 displays four indicators that are important to the economy, society, 
and the environment. The first variable, infant mortality, is a key measure-
ment of health conditions. It shows a strong and consistent decline as income 
growth brings improved sanitation and nutrition, wider access to health care, 
and improvements in the quality of health care. The second variable, access to 
safe drinking water, is one of the most significant public health problems in the 
world and can also be considered an environmental problem with direct health 
effects. As incomes rise, the percentage of the population with access to safe 
water increases significantly until nearly all citizens in high-income countries 
are covered. This should not be interpreted to mean that high-income countries 
do not have water problems; it simply means that all or nearly all their citizens 
have access to safe drinking water.
The other two indicators show a mixed pattern. In the case of a major con-
tributor to global climate change, carbon dioxide emissions, large increases 
occur as higher income countries burn more fossil fuels than lower income 
ones. The high-income countries of Table 8.2 produce 37 times more carbon

LABOR STANDARDS
LO 8.3	 Define labor standards.
LO 8.4	 State four potential problems with using trade sanctions to enforce 
labor standards.
Since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, the 
United States and other countries included labor and environmental standards as 
part of the regional trade agreements they negotiate. This is a politically charged 
issue that reflects domestic politics but also rising worldwide interests in issues 
related to human rights and the environment. To date, the United States’ trade 
agreements with Canada and Mexico (the North American Free Trade Agree-
ment), Jordan, and Chile contain language on labor and environmental standards, 
either in the treaty itself or as a side agreement. In each case, the language speci-
fies that each country must enforce its own standards or face monetary fines. 
Many labor and environmental activists view this as inadequate and are pushing 
dioxide per person than low-income countries, and each successive income 
group emits more carbon dioxide than the income group below it. The final col-
umn of Table 8.2 shows that forest reserves are depleted at an expanding rate 
as income grows, but depletion begins to taper off eventually. High-income 
countries use much less wood for fuel and replace it with metal, plastic, and 
other materials in manufacturing.
In sum, when thinking about labor and environmental standards, it is useful 
to keep in mind the potential effects of highly different income levels.

to include trade sanctions as part of the enforcement mechanism, both in existing 
agreements and in future agreements, including those reached by the WTO.
The complaints against trade by labor and environmental interests are rela-
tively similar. In both cases, it is alleged that trade with countries that have lower 
standards creates a race to the bottom in standards, and that countries with high 
standards are forced to lower their standards or experience a loss of jobs and 
industry. Furthermore, it is alleged that this type of trade is unfair, since the failure 
to enact or to enforce standards gives firms in countries with lower standards a 
commercial advantage. Before addressing these issues, it is useful to clarify what 
is meant by standards, particularly labor standards.
Defining Labor Standards
The concept of labor standards is multifaceted, since it covers many potential 
rights, from basic rights such as the right to be free from forced labor, to civic 
rights such as the right to representation in a union. Currently, there is no core set 
of work-related rights that everyone views as universal human rights.
As a starting point, we take the following five labor standards proposed as basic 
rights by the International Labour Organization (ILO) (see the ILO case study 
later in this chapter) and revised by the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development (OECD):
■
■Prohibition of forced labor
■
■Freedom of association
■
■The right to organize and bargain collectively
■
■An end to the exploitation of child labor
■
■Nondiscrimination in employment
Most people would probably agree to these rights, although there is a fair 
amount of ambiguity attached to each of them. For example, conditions consid-
ered exploitative in a high-income country might seem acceptable in a poor one, 
or cultural or religious values regarding employment opportunities for men and 
women may be at odds with the idea of nondiscrimination.
Other potential standards are significantly more contentious. For example, uni-
versal standards for minimum wages, limits on the number of hours someone can 
work in a day, and health and safety issues in the workplace are difficult to define 
given the wide variation in incomes and living conditions around the world. High-
income countries, where unskilled labor is relatively scarce, face an entirely differ-
ent set of economic constraints compared to those faced by low-income countries 
where unskilled labor is relatively abundant. For example, if low-income countries 
are forced to pay a minimum wage high enough to satisfy critics in high-income 
countries, many people fear that the result would be the closing down of produc-
tion and a rise in unemployment rather than an increase in living standards. In 
other words, too high a minimum wage may be well intentioned, but it may reduce 
living standards in low-income countries. Even this is ambiguous, however, since 
it is no easy matter to determine how high is too high.

Child Labor
The most common definition of a child is a person under 18 years of age. This 
is the definition set forth by the United Nations and the International Labour 
Organization (ILO; see the next case study) and accepted by most countries. 
Many children are economically active without falling into the negative cat-
egory of child labor because their work is light, their hours are not long, and 
they work to supplement their studies or to learn a skill.
It is easy to be opposed to the evils of child labor, particularly when it is 
hazardous to the physical and psychological well-being of children. Opposition 
becomes more complicated, however, when schools do not exist and impover-
ished families depend on the few cents their children can bring home. In these 
cases, children and their work contribute to family survival and a humane policy 
requires more than a simple prohibition of work by children.
Child labor appears to be in decline worldwide, having fallen from an esti-
mated 215.3 million in 2008 to 167.9 million in 2012, but it is still common in 
some parts of the world. Using 75 national surveys, the ILO estimated that the 
number of children, ages 5–17, that were employed in 2012 was 264.4 million. 
A subcategory of this group, numbering 167.9 million, are considered child 
­laborers. The difference between children in employment and child laborers is 
that the latter category does not count children who work within legal frame-
works agreed by most nations and that serve to protect children from physically 
or psychologically harmful work as well as school absences. A working child 
who has access to schooling and is not subjected to long hours or dangerous 
work is considered to be employed, but not a child laborer. For example, family 
businesses or farms where children work limited hours are not considered to be 
using child labor. Of the 167.9 million child laborers, slightly more than one-half 
(85.3 million) were engaged in hazardous work. Child labor disproportionately 
affects boys more than girls, and geographically it is most numerous in the Asia-
Pacific region, largely because there are more children (Figure 8.1).
Sub-Saharan Africa has fewer child laborers than the Asia-Pacific region, but 
a larger percentage of its children are pressed into labor. In 2012, more than one 
in five children in the 5–17 age group were child labors (Figure 8.2), although 
this was down from one in four in the ILO’s previous survey for 2008. Poverty, 
a lack of educational opportunities, and agriculture are the main causes. Agri-
culture is the primary user of child labor (58.6 percent of all child labor), with 
services second (32.3 percent) and industry (manufacturing, construction, min-
ing, and utilities) third (7 percent of all child laborers). Very few children work 
in export-oriented sectors and, in general, the incidence of child labor declines 
as gross domestic product (GDP) increases. It also decreases as opportunities 
for schooling become available. The ILO and others argue that child labor is 
most effectively combated by supporting the expansion of schooling.

Part 2    International Trade
Labor Standards and Trade
Many political activists and some politicians would like to use trade barriers to 
enforce labor standards. Trade economists tend to be more skeptical about using 
trade barriers for this purpose, partly for the reasons outlined in Chapter 7: they 
are expensive and inefficient means for protecting labor or jobs at home. In addi-
tion to the deadweight losses in consumption and production at home, the use 
of trade barriers to enforce standards abroad raises several other concerns for 
economists. These include their effectiveness in creating change in an exporting 
country, the hazy borderline between protectionism and concern over standards, 
the lack of agreement over the specific content of standards, and their potential to 
erupt into a wider trade war. We will examine each of these points next.
Effectiveness  In addition to the deadweight losses and income redistribution 
effects of trade barriers, it is clear that only large countries can hope to use bar-
riers successfully, since a small country cannot have a large enough impact on 
demand. If a small country such as Denmark decides that garment producers in 
Haiti are exploiting children, no trade barrier that Denmark erects against imports 
from Haiti is likely to reduce demand enough to change Haitian practices. Only 
countries that constitute a significant share of the Haitian market could erect bar-
riers that would impose costs on Haitian producers, and even then only if there 
are no alternative markets for Haitian goods. Nor would this necessarily lead to 
changes, since there are numerous examples (Cuba, Myanmar, and others) where 
countries have suffered large costs from trade sanctions but have not altered their 
policies in response. In effect, the general rule is that the effectiveness of the trade 
barrier increases as more countries join to impose them. For example, the strong 
unity of the world’s industrial economies against South Africa was at least partly 
responsible for ending the policy of apartheid.
In addition to the problem of creating a coalition of countries, an additional 
obstacle to the effectiveness of trade barriers is that they sometimes make condi-
tions worse rather than better. This outcome occurs when sanctions cause pro-
ducers inside a country to move their facilities into the informal, unregulated 
economy—out of sight of domestic inspectors and regulators. Some share of pro-
duction in every economy takes place in the informal economy. The informal 
economy does not necessarily produce illegal goods, but it is untaxed, unregulated, 
and uninspected. In developing countries this tends to be a relatively larger share 
of overall economic activity than in industrial economies, and it is typically com-
posed of small firms operating with little capital. Employees in these enterprises 
usually earn less and suffer harsher working conditions. If sanctions against a 
country create incentives for employers to avoid the scrutiny of labor inspec-
tors, then a larger share of the working population could find themselves laboring 
under worse conditions.
Hazy Borderline between Protectionism and Concern  When does concern over 
foreign labor practices justify protectionism? There is no definitive answer to this 
question, although special interests certainly sometimes use the issue of labor 

Chapter 8    International Trade and Labor and Environmental Standards 
191
standards as a means to justify their real goal—protection against foreign compe-
tition. Indeed, this is the fear of many low- and middle-income countries, which 
explains why their governments resist negotiating labor standards. Low- and mid-
dle-income countries tend to have abundant supplies of unskilled labor and they 
depend on low-wage, low-productivity jobs for a large share of their employment. 
In these countries, proposals to set labor standards and to use trade barriers as 
an enforcement mechanism are widely viewed as a form of protectionism on the 
part of high-income countries. Given that most high-income countries continue 
to protect their markets in key areas of developing country activity—agriculture, 
clothing, and textiles—there is a strong suspicion that calls for labor standards are 
a way to undermine the comparative advantage of low-income countries and to 
close the markets of high-income countries in selected areas.
The Specific Content of Labor Standards  The problem of reaching agreement on the 
specific content of standards has yet to be resolved. We have seen how child labor 
varies by income, and that even the definition of a child varies across countries. 
For example, disputes over the minimum age at which someone may legally enter 
the labor force have so far blocked international agreement on child labor, other 
than vague condemnations of the practice. Other standards are equally contentious, 
although it is always conceivable that an international consensus may develop in 
the long run. Currently, however, the lack of international agreement on the spe-
cific content of labor standards, other than the relatively vague proposals from the 
OECD and ILO, means that trade sanctions are unilateral measures with a large 
potential for creating conflict and undermining international economic relations.
The Potential to Set Off a Trade War  One primary obligation of countries in 
the WTO is to treat other members the same. That is, discrimination by one 
WTO member against another is not allowed. There are exceptions, as in the 
case of national security, or in the case of the special benefits given to mem-
bers of a ­free-trade area. In general, however, discriminatory trade practices are 
not allowed. Consequently, the use of trade sanctions to enforce labor standards 
places a country out of compliance with its WTO obligations and opens it to the 
risk of retaliation by the targeted country. Where this ends is indeterminate.
Evidence on Low Standards as a Predatory Practice
One concern expressed by the proponents of trade sanctions is that low standards 
may reflect a deliberate policy to capture markets and foreign investment; that 
is, a country may use its coercive power to hold down or repress labor standards, 
thereby reducing the costs of producing goods. While theoretically possible, this 
too has many issues that must be examined empirically.
In practice, there is little or no support for the view that countries use low labor 
standards to attract foreign investment. While evidence indicates that a country 
can reduce production costs by outlawing unions or by some other repressive prac-
tice, there is no evidence that this type of policy has given any country a compara-
tive advantage in lines of production that it did not already have. In other words, 

192
Part 2    International Trade
low standards can reduce production costs, but they do not change a country’s 
comparative advantage.
This result does not affect competition between countries with the same or 
similar comparative advantages. Within a particular line of production, such as 
the clothing industry, countries may compete by lowering labor standards; but in 
that case, the low standards have harmful competitive effects on other countries 
with low standards, not on countries with high standards and an entirely different 
comparative advantage.
While low labor standards may help a country compete against another country 
with low labor standards, there is clear evidence that low labor standards are not 
a successful strategy for attracting foreign investment. The reason is simple. Low 
labor standards are highly correlated with a labor force that has an abundance of 
illiterate and unskilled workers. Furthermore, it is a sign that the nation’s infra-
structure of roads, ports, power supply, telecommunications, schools, and sanita-
tion are also undeveloped. Hence, the labor cost savings of low labor standards 
is more than likely to be offset by higher costs everywhere else in production. 
Consequently, empirical studies show that countries with low labor standards are 
less successful at attracting foreign investment.
Finally, there is the case of intolerable situations, such as the practice of apart-
heid in South Africa till 1994, the gulags of the former Soviet Union, and slav-
ery in Sudan and elsewhere. These types of practices raise multiple moral issues, 
which make it unreasonable to rely solely on economic analysis. Clearly, however, 
the more united the world is against a particular inhumane labor practice, the 
more likely sanctions are to succeed. For example, the United States is isolated 
in imposing sanctions on Cuba, and although it has imposed significant costs on 
Cuba’s economy, the lack of international support for U.S. policies has prevented 
the sanctions from successfully changing Cuban policies.

The International Labour Organization
The International Labour Organization (ILO) “seeks the promotion of social 
justice and internationally recognized human and labour rights.”* The ILO 
began in 1919 and is the only surviving element of the League of Nations, which 
was founded after World War I and was the precursor of the United Nations 
(UN). In 1946, the ILO was incorporated into the United Nations and since 
then, most of the world’s countries have become members.
The ILO uses several tools to attain its goals. Most prominently, it develops 
labor standards that are embodied in specific Conventions and Recommenda-
tions. Individual countries are encouraged but not required to ratify the ILO 
Conventions. Currently, there are 183 conventions, about 26 of which have 
been shelved and are no longer proposed, leaving 157 in force.

Chapter 8    International Trade and Labor and Environmental Standards 
193
On June 18, 1998, the ILO adopted the “Declaration on Fundamental Prin-
ciples and Rights at Work and its Follow-up.” This document specifies the 
eight core labor standards that it believes all countries should respect regard-
less of which conventions they ratified. The ILO groups the eight core stan-
dards into four areas:*
■
■Freedom of association and recognition of the right to collective bargaining
■
■Elimination of all forms of forced labor
■
■Effective abolition of child labor
■
■Elimination of discrimination in employment and occupations
The most serious type of complaint handled by the ILO concerns cases 
where worker’s organizations, firms, or governments file a formal complaint 
that a member government is not enforcing core labor rights. The process for 
handling such complaints begins with a consultation with the alleged offender, 
followed by an official investigation if the consultation does not resolve the 
issue. The investigating committee may make recommendations, which the 
target country may appeal to the International Court of Justice. If there is an 
appeal, afterward the ILO can propose actions against the offending country. 
Economic actions such as trade sanctions are within the legal framework of 
options available to the ILO. It should be noted, however, that throughout its 
lengthy history, the ILO has recommended actions against only one country.
The ILO’s reluctance to use the full extent of its power, along with the fail-
ure of some of its members to support it, results in a fairly weak organization. 
For example, in 1998, it began an investigation of Myanmar for using forced 
labor to fill the ranks of its military. When it proposed trade sanctions in 2000, 
Myanmar quickly assured the ILO that it was addressing the problem and the 
ILO withdrew the proposal for trade sanctions in 2001. While most national 
governments probably agreed with the implicit criticisms of Myanmar that fol-
low from the ILO’s proposed sanctions, they also are reluctant to set a prece-
dent allowing an international organization to impose sanctions based on labor 
practices. Hence, the ILO has more authority on paper than it has in ­reality. 
Further, it illustrates the political obstacles to an international agreement with 
the authority to impose sanctions for labor or environmental policies.
The fact that the ILO has no enforcement authority does not mean that 
it is not a useful organization. Perhaps its most important function is that it 
provides technical assistance in all aspects of labor policy, including labor law, 
worker benefit programs, vocational training, development and administration

TRADE AND THE ENVIRONMENT
LO 8.5	 Compare and contrast transboundary and nontransboundary 
environmental problems.
Over the last forty years, the realization has grown that our activities profoundly 
affect the natural environment. Unfortunately, our production and consumption 
choices do not always reflect the environmental costs of our decisions, and in the 
short run, our economies too often perform as if environmental costs and limits 
are irrelevant. When economic agents are allowed to ignore the environmental 
costs of their actions, then conflict between financial and environmental inter-
ests is inevitable. Most high-income countries have a significant amount of such 
conflict, and trade, along with other economic activities, has received its share of 
environmental criticism.
Transboundary and NonTransboundary Effects
There is a considerable overlap between environmental standards and labor stan-
dards. For example, many proponents of putting environmental standards into 
trade agreements believe that trade sanctions—tariffs, quotas, prohibitions on 
imports—should be used as enforcement mechanisms, while the critics of trade 
sanctions have the same concerns raised earlier: They are relatively ineffective, 
there is a hazy borderline between protectionism and concern for the environ-
ment, there is a lack of international agreement, and there is a potential to start 
trade wars.
Some differences exist between labor and environmental standards, however, 
beginning with the fact that some, but not all environmental impacts are trans-
boundary. In other words, low standards in one country can degrade the environ-
ment in other countries. When it comes to trade policy, the distinction between 
transboundary and nontransboundary environmental impacts is an important one. 
We will look at nontransboundary, or exclusively national impacts, first.
Trade and Environmental Impacts That Do Not Cross Borders  Proponents of trade 
barriers to enforce environmental standards base their analysis on two types of 
claims. First, they argue that environmental standards reduce industrial competi-
tiveness. This induces an environmental race to the bottom where countries are 
forced to rescind standards to stay competitive. Second, they argue that stan-
dards in high-income countries cause them to “export pollution” to low- and 
­middle-income countries by relocating their dirty industries there. Both effects 
are harmful to the environment, as they lead to downward pressures on environ-
mental standards and the concentration of dirty industries in a few countries with 
lower incomes.
The first claim, that environmental standards reduce industrial competitiveness, 
is theoretically valid since standards must raise the costs of production. Essen-
tially, environmental standards prohibit the shifting of environmental costs to 

Chapter 8    International Trade and Labor and Environmental Standards 
195
the public at large and thereby force firms to take a more complete measure of 
all their costs of production. If the standards are correctly implemented, they 
raise national well-being and lead to an economically optimal level of produc-
tion. This implies that the argument against standards by firms that are subject to 
them is an argument between their interests and the nation’s interests. Clearly, 
the nation is better off if the production of dirty industries is curtailed somewhat, 
even though the workers and firms in the shrinking industry may be worse off in 
the ­short-to-medium runs. The idea that the sectional interests are so politically 
strong that they can force environmental deregulation (race to the bottom) or 
prevent the introduction of new standards altogether may have some merit; but 
in general, environmental standards in most countries have gotten tougher over 
time, not more lax.
Countries that compete by offering foreign firms a reduced set of environmen-
tal compliance requirements are known as pollution havens. Note the essential 
similarity between the pollution haven concept and the claim that countries com-
pete for foreign investment by lowering their labor standards. Empirically, there is 
evidence that some dirty industries from high-income industrial economies moved 
to low- and middle-income countries in the 1970s when the industrial economies 
first began cracking down on environmental polluters. Steel and chemical indus-
tries fall into this pattern, although it is possible that the developing countries were 
gaining a comparative advantage in these areas as high-income countries were 
losing theirs. Regardless, there is strong evidence showing that the idea of pollu-
tion havens is invalid; that is, it is impossible to identify any country that success-
fully competes for new investment on the basis of low environmental standards. 
The fact that there are no pollution havens is good news, but it does not mean 
that individual firms cannot move to escape the environmental regulations of a 
­high-standards country. Undoubtedly, there are cases of this, although numbers 
and overall importance are uncertain.
From a trade perspective, the issue is complicated by the fact that differences in 
income and preferences make the optimal set of environmental standards variable 
by country. An optimal set of standards in Europe, for example, might be entirely 
different from the optimal set in North Africa or Central Asia. The fact that bud-
gets and regulatory abilities are limited implies that countries cannot do everything 
and that they must prioritize their efforts. Biodiversity and habitat preservation 
may receive top priority in one place, while clean water and soil conservation are 
first in another. When the optimality of standards varies across countries, introduc-
ing trade barriers to enforce one country’s standards in another country’s produc-
tion system would actually lower global welfare rather than raise it.
Trade and Transboundary Environmental Problems  Transboundary environmental 
impacts happen when one country’s pollution spills over into a second country; for 
example, when a shared watershed is polluted by an upstream user, or industrial 
production in one country creates acid rain in another country. It can also happen 
in a mutual way; for example, when heavy truck traffic between two countries cre-
ates air pollution in both. Finally, transboundary environmental impacts can occur 

196
Part 2    International Trade
as the result of similar activities in many countries, leading to global impacts such 
as global warming and ozone depletion. There are a variety of potential corrective 
actions that countries may contemplate, from tariffs on the output of the polluting 
industries, to embargoes, to multicountry or global negotiations.
The analysis of labor standards applies here, as unilateral actions by one coun-
try are unlikely to have any effect whatsoever except in the large country case. 
Even then, the more isolated the sanctions-imposing country is, the lower the 
probability that its actions will successfully alter the policies of the offending 
countries.

Trade Barriers and Endangered Species
The connection between trade and endangered species protection is an area 
where the environmental movement has been critical of the WTO. The origi-
nal precedent-setting case began with the U.S. ban on imports of tuna caught 
with nets that were particularly harmful to dolphins. Under the terms of its 
Endangered Species Act of 1973, the United States imposed a ban on tuna 
imports that were not certified as “dolphin-safe.” Mexico lodged a complaint, 
and the outcome of the investigation was a GATT ruling that countries cannot 
prohibit imports based on the method of production, as long as the goods are 
legal. Because the United States allowed tuna to be sold in its market, it could 
not keep out tuna harvested in a way that hurt dolphins.
The U.S. prohibition on certain shrimp imports was the next important case 
to draw attention to the conflict between trade and the protection of endan-
gered species. The United States sought to protect endangered sea turtles 
from being harmed by shrimp trawlers that do not use turtle excluder devices 
(TEDs) on their nets. In 1987, it issued guidelines requiring shrimp trawlers to 
use TEDs, and in 1989, it announced that beginning in May of 1991, it would 
ban shrimp from countries that were not certified. The guidelines applied only 
to the Caribbean and the Western Atlantic, and the countries were given three 
years to come into compliance. In 1996, a number of additional conditions 
were placed on shrimp imports, the guidelines were extended worldwide, and 
countries were given four months to come into compliance.
India, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand immediately protested to the WTO. 
The primary basis of the protest was that they were given four months to com-
ply with the U.S. rules, while countries in the Caribbean were given three 
years and technical assistance. In addition, they cited the dolphin-tuna case 
and argued that the GATT rules forbid discrimination against imports based 
on the process of production. After the United States and the Asian nations 
failed to resolve their dispute through informal consultations, the Asian nations 
asked the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body to establish a panel to resolve the

ALTERNATIVES TO TRADE MEASURES
LO 8.6	 Explain three alternatives to trade measures for enforcing labor and 
environmental standards.
Currently, it is impossible to predict how, or even if, trade rules might eventually 
change to accommodate labor and environmental standards. These are new issues 
for the world trading system, and it is possible that they will become a permanent 
source of tension in international economic relations. As long as there are large 
income gaps between rich and poor countries, it seems unlikely that differences in 
standards will disappear. If trade tensions over standards are likely to continue in 
issue. The issue wound its way through the dispute resolution process of rulings 
and appeals and finally culminated in a decision acknowledging the right of 
countries to impose import barriers to protect endangered species and over-
turning the basis of the previous ruling on tuna imports. However, the final 
decision also stated that the United States’ failure to negotiate or confer with 
the affected countries put it in violation of WTO rules. Furthermore, by treat-
ing the Asian nations differently, the United States acted in a discriminatory 
manner. In response, the United States began a series of negotiations with 
the countries that filed the complaint. In the end, it revised its timetable and 
procedures for certification and agreed to provide technical assistance in the 
use of TEDs.
This case is important because, in the words of the WTO, “We have not 
decided that the sovereign nations that are Members of the WTO cannot 
adopt effective measures to protect endangered species, such as sea turtles. 
Clearly, they can and should.”* In effect, the WTO forced a multilateral solu-
tion by arranging for the United States—which places a relatively high value 
on sea turtles—to assist a number of less well-off countries—which place a 
relatively higher value on their commercial fishing industries—in acquiring the 
­technology they needed. This enabled the United States to extend its protec-
tion of an endangered species worldwide, while the fishing fleets of South Asia 
remained commercially viable.
The WTO also clarified the controversial issue of products versus processes 
that first began with the dolphin-tuna dispute. In its ruling, the WTO states 
that trade measures are permitted to protect endangered species. At the same 
time, the ruling stressed the need to negotiate a solution and disallowed uni-
lateral action.

Part 2    International Trade
one form or another, then it is important to look for ways to preserve the benefits 
created by world trade while simultaneously resolving the conflicts over standards.
In the search for alternatives to trade measures, it is useful to recognize the 
general economic principle that efficient policies go directly to the root of the 
problem they are designed to correct. This was illustrated in Chapter 7, where it 
was demonstrated that trade barriers are an expensive way to solve the problem 
of job shortages in a particular industry. In the cases of environmental degrada-
tion and the exploitation of labor, the root of the problem lies in the production 
and/or consumption of particular goods, not in their trade. If a steel mill pollutes 
a river or exploits children, the direct cause of the environmental and human 
harm is the set of production standards employed by the mill, not the fact that the 
steel is exported. In some cases of negative environmental effects (for example, 
air pollution caused by gas-burning cars) the root of the problem is consumption, 
not production. Given that environmental degradation and labor exploitation are 
by-products of production and consumption decisions, the optimal policies for 
addressing them are at the level of production and consumption, not at the level 
of trade measures, since the latter create production and consumption inefficien-
cies in the country that imposes them. In some cases, such as countries that still 
allow slavery, trade measures may be the only available option short of military 
intervention; but in most international conflicts over labor and environmental 
standards, there are policies that are more efficient than trade measures.
Labels for Exports
The idea of labeling is widespread and has been implemented with mixed suc-
cess. This idea is a certification process producing a label that is attached to the 
good when it is exported. The label tells consumers that the good was produced 
under conditions that are humane or environmentally sustainable. This method 
is already in place, although not always successful, and it seems to be growing 
as a strategy for telling consumers about the products they buy. For example, 
in 1999, the United States and Cambodia agreed that the United States would 
increase its quota of Cambodian textiles and garments if the country allowed 
foreign observers to visit its factories. Cambodia agreed to the intrusion of labor 
inspectors because it was desperate for the export business. The initial result was 
a heightening of conflict between Cambodian unions and employers, and a threat 
by producers to move elsewhere. Coffee is a somewhat more successful example, 
where retailers have used independent inspection agencies that offer services 
to firms that import coffee and other tropical products. This allows retailers to 
advertise that they sell one or more types of coffee certified as beneficial to small 
farmers. Similarly, some cosmetic brands and retailers certify that their products 
are not tested on animals.
Labeling probably has an important role to play in resolving conflicts, despite 
the several obstacles to its expanded use. Two main obstacles are that some coun-
tries resist what they consider an infringement of their sovereignty when foreign 

Chapter 8    International Trade and Labor and Environmental Standards 
199
inspectors are allowed to probe into the details of labor and environmental condi-
tions, and consumers have to be convinced that the label provides reliable informa-
tion. If a sweater made in Cambodia has a label saying it was made under humane 
conditions, what degree of confidence should you put on that information? As the 
procedure of labeling becomes more widespread, it is possible that the true infor-
mation value of labels will decrease, or that the labeling organizations become 
better at what they do and the labels carry more reliable information.
Requiring Home Country Standards
A second alternative to trade measures is to require home country firms to fol-
low home country standards whenever they open foreign operations. An example 
is the Sullivan Principles, which asked multinationals operating in South Africa 
during the apartheid era (pre-1994) to practice nondiscrimination. In the case of 
labor standards, a domestic firm in a high-standards country that wants to open 
a plant in a lower-standards country would be required by law to adhere to the 
same labor standards as the ones it must follow at home. This does not mean that 
wages and benefits must be the same, since the cost of labor varies; but mini-
mum wages might be included, along with some benefits, workplace health and 
safety standards, child labor standards, hours of work standards, and so on. In 
the environmental sphere, firms often adopt the same standards abroad as they 
use at home, since environmental control is often built into the technology and 
a least-cost strategy usually involves the adoption of one set of standards rather 
than multiple standards.
The advantage of this approach is that it addresses the issue of a race to the 
bottom by making it impossible for a home-based company to exploit low labor 
or environmental standards abroad, while, at the same time, preserving access 
to the low-wage labor of labor-abundant countries. Furthermore, this technique 
shifts the costs of improved standards to firms and consumers in high-income 
countries—which is where much of the concern originates. It might seem strange 
to regulate companies operating outside the nation, but it is well within the legal 
right of nations to impose standards on domestic firms that operate abroad, as long 
as the standards do not conflict with the laws of the host country. Given that the 
required standards are meant to be more stringent than those in the host country, 
this should not be a problem.
One weakness of this approach, however, is that it addresses only the problem 
of firms in high-standards countries that go abroad, not that of foreign-owned and 
foreign-operated firms that export into the domestic market. In other words, firms 
based in countries with low standards are untouched by this type of rule. More 
problematically, a clothing manufacturer based in a high-standards country might 
outsource its production through contracts with firms based in ­low-standards 
countries. This puts part of the production at arm’s length and makes it more 
difficult to ensure that working conditions are satisfactory. Since the firms doing 
the actual cutting and sewing are foreign-owned, they may lie completely outside 

200
Part 2    International Trade
the reach of the regulations governing the clothing manufacturer located in the 
high-standards country.
Nevertheless, regulations placed on domestic firms operating abroad address 
a significant share of the fears of a race to the bottom. In particular, they remove 
the threat by domestic firms to relocate abroad if standards are not reduced at 
home, and ensure that the attraction of foreign-based production is the foreign 
comparative advantage, not the ability to lower labor standards or ignore the 
environment. In addition, they help avoid the problems created when high-
income countries appear to be dictating labor and environmental standards for 
low- and middle-income countries. Each country sets its own standards, but when 
firms cross national boundaries, they must conform to whichever standards are 
higher—those in the sending country, or those in the receiving country.
Increasing International Negotiations
A third alternative to trade measures is to increase the level of international nego-
tiations, either using existing international organizations such as the ILO for labor, 
or creating new agreements and organizations for the environment. In the labor 
standards arena, proponents of increased negotiations would like to see the ILO 
publicize examples of countries that are out of compliance with core labor rights. 
It could do this with the information it already gathers on the labor practices of 
its member countries. An expanded role for the ILO is supported by the growing 
recognition that it has the technical capability to assess labor policies, whereas 
the WTO does not.
In the environmental arena, the WTO maintains an environmental database 
that reports all environmental agreements with potential trade impacts and that 
have been reported to the WTO. As of 2012, there were 569 reported environmen-
tal agreements. These range in scope and include important global agreements 
such as the Montreal Protocol regulating the use of chlorofluorocarbons, the Basel 
Convention regulating the transportation of hazardous waste, and the Conven-
tion on International Trade in Endangered Species. In cases where two or more 
countries have signed an agreement and the agreement allows trade sanctions as 
part of its enforcement mechanism, the WTO’s position is that disputes should 
be resolved within the environmental agreement and not within the WTO. In 
cases where there are no environmental agreements, however, as with the United 
States’ shrimp import ban, the WTO rules of nondiscrimination apply.
It is significant that the WTO has staked out a position on the issue of mul-
tilateral environmental agreements. The WTO recognizes explicitly that it 
is not an environmental organization and that it has no expertise in this area. 
However, it has left room for environmental agreements to develop their own 
enforcement mechanisms. This does not change the fact that trade sanctions are 
unlikely to be the least expensive technique for resolving environmental disputes, 
but it does leave it up to the nations involved to decide on their own methods of 
enforcement.

Global Climate Change
A consensus of climate scientists tell us that global warming is happening 
and that it is caused by human activity. This view was reflected in the United 
Nations Conference on Climate Change, held in Paris during late Novem-
ber and December, 2015. One hundred ninety-five nations signed pledges to 
reduce their emission of carbon dioxide and other gasses responsible for the 
bulk of the world’s human-caused climate change. Global warming is clearly 
a transboundary environmental problem; no matter how far you live from 
places where greenhouse gases (GHG) are produced, it will affect everyone 
on the planet.
Most human activity involves the burning of fossil fuels, either directly as 
when we drive cars, or indirectly as when we use electricity generated by oil 
or coal fired power plants, or when we consume goods and services produced 
with fossil fuels. Emissions of the gases generated by the burning of fossil fuels 
exceeds the earth’s ability to absorb them, and over the decades they build up 
in the atmosphere where they trap more of the infrared energy reflected off 
the earth’s surface and cause an increase in temperatures. Economists examin-
ing this problem usually focus on the policy aspect, not the science of global 
warming, since the discipline of economics does not lead to expertise in areas 
needed to do research on atmospheric chemistry and physics. Economics does 
lead to a set of tools and analyses that help society understand the net value 
of remediation efforts, however, and is essential for evaluating the different 
policy proposals for addressing the problems of climate change. Economics 
can evaluate the costs and benefits along the entire spectrum of choices, from 
doing nothing all the way to very aggressive actions to cut fossil fuel use and 
emissions.
The first generation of coordinated global action against climate change 
resulted in the Kyoto Protocol of 1997. The Kyoto agreement set strict targets 
on greenhouse gases produced by high-income countries but did not try to limit 
emissions by low- and middle-income countries. The reasoning is that high-
income countries can afford to make the necessary changes, while other coun-
tries cannot, and in the 1990s most GHG originated in industrial, ­high-income 
countries. The United States did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, nor did it make 
commitments at a follow-up summit in Copenhagen in 2010. Nevertheless, both 
the U.S. and China—another large emitter of GHG—made strong commit-
ments to reduce emissions at the Paris Summit in 2015.
Two layers of problems make it difficult to address the problem of climate 
change. One, science can only provide probabilities and likelihoods, not cer-
tainties. That complicates the effort to understand the right level of response, 
(continued)

202
Part 2    International Trade
and it also opens the door to greater confusion in the public’s mind when 
energy companies and others with a financial stake in fossil fuels try to discredit 
the science of climate change. The right level of response depends on how 
much damage might be averted, how much the prevention efforts cost today, 
and how far into the future the benefits occur. The best that economists can do 
is to take the various estimates of the future consequences of climate change 
given by scientists and then see how much reduction in emissions would avert 
or reduce the damage, while measuring the costs in terms of lost output, envi-
ronmental damage, and the purchase of new technologies. Economists have 
run numerous scenarios, based on different estimates of future damages and 
with different policy responses. A key problem is how to take into account that 
we are spending money today to protect the incomes of people in the future 
who, judging by the last 200 years of world history, are likely to be much better 
off than we are.
A central result of this modeling is that we should pay more for carbon. 
This follows from the fact that each of us imposes a negative externality on 
the rest of world when we consume carbon-based fuels. As with any negative 
externality, the solution is to incorporate the full cost of its consumption into 
its price. The Yale University economist William Nordhaus points out that a 
carbon tax tells consumers which goods use a lot of fossil fuel energy in their 
production, it tells producers which methods are intensive in the use of fossil 
fuels, and it sends a signal to innovators and entrepreneurs to look for alter-
natives. He estimates that a tax of $30–$50 per ton of carbon emission would 
raise electrical bills for the average American household approximately $90 
per year, from around $1,200 to $1,290.
For a carbon tax to work with maximum effect, it has to be a global tax, and 
this brings up the second layer of problems for addressing climate change: 
How do the world’s nation’s organize a coordinated global response? A 
harmonized global carbon tax could be adjusted up when estimates of future 
damage increase in severity and adjusted down if the damage is understood 
to be less than previously thought. As with all transboundary problems, this 
would require coordination. Unlike most environmental problems, however, 
which affect only two countries or a handful of countries, climate change is 
global, and even though most GHG emissions have historically been from 
high-income countries, large amounts of emissions today also come from 
middle-income countries such as China, India, Brazil, and Russia. In the 
final analysis, unless there is a grand technological fix that no one currently 
foresees, increased international negotiations, such as the Paris conference 
in late 2015, are essential for an effective response to the problem of climate 
change.

Summary
■
■The increase in world trade over the last fifty years has reduced tariffs and 
eliminated quotas, but as a result, many domestic policies have become unin-
tentional barriers to trade. Examples include competition policies, product 
standards, health and safety standards, and labor and environmental standards.
■
■Countries do not need to harmonize standards in order to trade. In many 
cases, harmonization would remove some of the differences between coun-
tries and eliminate the gains from trade. Alternative treatment of standards 
includes mutual recognition and maintaining completely separate standards.
■
■Differing labor and environmental standards have become a point of sig-
nificant conflict between high-income and low-income countries. Standards 
differ primarily because of differences in income and factor endowments.
■
■Core labor standards defined by the OECD and the ILO include prohibi-
tions against forced labor, freedom of association and collective bargaining, 
the elimination of child labor, and nondiscrimination in employment.
■
■Child labor is most common in Africa and Asia. Asia has the most children 
working, but a larger proportion of African children under age fourteen 
are at work. Child labor is most common in agriculture and in small-scale, 
family-operated businesses.
■
■Proponents of using trade barriers to enforce labor and environmental stan-
dards abroad argue that differences in standards are an unfair competitive 
advantage for the low-standards countries. They also fear that trade and 
foreign investment cause a race to the bottom in standards and that low 
environmental standards make some countries “pollution havens.”
■
■Evidence is scarce that countries use low standards to attract industry. In 
practice, low standards are associated with low levels of foreign investment. 
In addition, there is no evidence of pollution havens.
■
■Most economists oppose the use of trade measures to enforce standards 
because they are relatively ineffective, do not go to the root of the problem, 
are not based on an agreement regarding the content of standards, encour-
age protectionism in the guise of support for standards, and can lead to wider 
trade conflict.
■
■Environmental problems can be transboundary or nontransboundary. Inter-
national conflicts over both types of problems are similar to conflicts over 
labor standards. Transboundary problems, in particular, require interna-
tional negotiations.
■
■Alternatives to trade measures include labeling, enforcement of home coun-
try standards on home country firms operating abroad, and increased inter-
national negotiations. Greater support for the ILO and increasing support 
for international environmental agreements are also more efficient alterna-
tives to trade measures.

INTRODUCTION: THE CURRENT ACCOUNT
LO 9.1	 Define the current, capital, and financial accounts of a country’s balance 
of payments.
LO 9.2	 Explain the importance of the three main components of the current 
account.
The international transactions of a nation are divided into three separate accounts: the 
current account, the capital account, and the financial account. For most countries, the 
capital account is relatively minor, and the two most important accounts are the current 
and financial accounts. The current account tracks the flow of goods and services into 
and out of the country, while the financial account is the record of financial transactions 
occurring between one country and the rest of the world, such as foreign investment, 
purchases, or sales of foreign stocks and bonds, and international bank lending. The 
capital account is by far the smallest of the three and is a record of transfers of special-
ized types of capital, such as the gift of an embassy building or the land it is on, from 
residents of one country to residents in another. This chapter examines the accounting 
system used to keep track of a country’s international transactions. One of its primary

In 2014, the United States imported goods and services worth $2,851 billion. The 
composition of the purchases included a wide array of tangibles and intangibles, 
from Japanese cars to Venezuelan oil, and from luxury Mexican vacations to 
­tickets on the European rail system. In the same year, U.S. firms exported $2,344 
billion worth of aircraft, software, grain, trips to Disneyworld, and other goods 
and services. The difference between exports and imports of goods and services is 
called the trade balance. For the United States, the 2014 trade balance was $2,344 
billion minus $2,851 billion, or -$507 billion. Because the number is negative, the 
United States had a trade deficit.
Exports and imports include both goods and services, so the trade balance can 
be decomposed into the balance on goods and the balance on services. In the case 
of the United States, the goods balance was in deficit by $741 billion, while the 
services balance was in surplus by $232 billion. In 2014, services were 30 percent of 
total exports, and for many years they have been a growing part of U.S. and world 
trade. The main items in services trade include travel and passenger fares; trans-
portation services; royalties and license fees; and education, financial, business, 
and technical services. Although the U.S. trade balance for services is in surplus, 
total trade in services is still too small a share of overall trade to counteract the 
very large deficit in the merchandise goods trade balance.
The Current and Capital Account Balances
The merchandise goods trade balance is the most commonly cited measurement 
of a nation’s transactions with the rest of the world. The widespread dissemination 
of the monthly merchandise trade balance statistics through press releases and 
news articles makes it the most familiar concept in international economics and 
the basis of most people’s understanding of U.S. international economic relations.
A more comprehensive statistic is the current account balance, which mea-
sures all current, nonfinancial transactions between a nation and the rest of the 
world. It has three main items: (1) goods and services trade; (2) earned income 
paid abroad and received from abroad, called primary income; and (3) transfer 
payments made abroad and received from abroad, called secondary income. All 
three of these items have credit and debit components in the balance of payments 
and in the construction of the current account balance. The simplest framework 
for conceptualizing these three components is in terms of credits and debits, as 
portrayed in Table 9.1.
The investment income items in Table 9.1 should not be confused with the 
flow of investment capital that is used to buy a business or invest in another 
country’s stock market. Investment income is the income received or paid on the 

210
Part 3    International Finance
existing investments. For example, financial capital sent to another country with 
the ­purpose of buying a bond would not be included, but the interest received 
on the bond would be. The purchase or sale of assets are counted in the financial 
accounts of buying and selling countries, and are discussed below. It is useful to 
think of primary income in the current account as the payments or receipts for 
the use of financial capital or for use of labor. For example, if a U.S. company 
invests in Mexico’s stock market, the initial investment will not show up in the 
current account but will be included in the financial account. The subsequent flow 
of dividends back to the U.S. company will be counted in the United States as 
income received and in Mexico as income paid. Conceptually, it is as if U.S. inves-
tors are receiving payment for the rental of U.S. capital to Mexican firms, which 
makes it similar to payments for a service. Similarly, if a U.S. company operating 
in Mexico pays wages from its home in the U.S., the wages are included in the 
primary income category of the current account and are recorded as a receipt by 
Mexico and a payment by the U.S.
The third item in the current account balance, secondary income, includes pay-
ments made that are not in exchange for a good or service, such as foreign aid, 
or the remittances (the transfer of wages earned in one country to residents of 
another country) of immigrants temporarily residing in another country. In the 
U.S. case, these payments are large in absolute amounts but small relative to 
the U.S. current account. Transfers are sometimes very important to the current 
account balances of developing countries receiving either substantial foreign aid 
or large remittances from their citizens working abroad.
Table 9.2 gives a picture of the U.S. current account in 2014. The $390 billion 
deficit is part of the long-term persistence of U.S. current account deficits, as 
shown in Figure 9.1. Large deficits in the current account began around 1982, 
and have been more or less a constant feature of the U.S. economy since then. 
Although the deficit turned into a small surplus of $6.6 billion in 1991, due in part 
to the large flows of secondary income (transfers) received by the United States 
as payment for Operation Desert Storm, the pattern has been one of persistent 
deficits in the current account.

We will explore the causes and consequences of large current account deficits later, 
but here it should be noted that a current account deficit is not simply a sign of weak-
ness. On the contrary, through much of the 1990s, rapid economic growth in the 
United States raised incomes and created a voracious appetite for imports. Mean-
while, economic growth among the United States’ main trading partners ranged 
between negative and sluggish, so foreign incomes did not rise as rapidly. Conse-
quently, foreign demand for U.S. exports grew less rapidly than the U.S. demand 
for imports. Therefore, it can be argued that the current account deficit in the 1990s 
was a sign of relative U.S. economic strength. It would be a mistake to carry this 
argument too far, however, since everyone agrees that the deficit is not sustainable 
in the long run and that it could create serious future problems. We will look at this 
issue later in the chapter after we introduce a few more concepts.
The capital account of the balance of payments is the record of specialized capi-
tal transfers. Because it is a measure of transfers and not purchases or sales, it is 
somewhat similar to the category of secondary income of the current account, but 
with the major distinction that it applies to capital transfers and not income trans-
fers. Normally, this is a small item and includes relatively infrequent activities such 
as the transfer of military bases or embassies between countries, debt forgiveness, 
and the personal assets that migrants carry with them when they cross borders.

Introduction to the Financial Account
Types of Financial Flows
LO 9.3	 Describe three types of international capital flows.
The financial account is the main record of financial flows between countries. In its 
2014 revision of the international accounts, the U.S. Bureau of Economic ­Analysis 
(BEA) brought U.S. accounting procedures into alignment with the recent revisions

There are two periods of large current account deficits in the United States. 
The first lasted through most of the 1980s, while the second began in the early 
1990s and continues today, although it has been moderated by the financial 
­crisis of 2007–2009 which led to fewer imports.

in methods and concepts made by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Under 
the new system, the BEA emphasizes the terminology shown in Table 9.3 and uses 
“net acquisition of financial assets” and “net incurrence of liabilities” to categorize 
the bulk of financial flows. Following the new BEA and IMF terminology, these are 
the main categories we will use in this chapter when discussing the financial account.
Unlike the current account which deals with goods and services and income 
flows, the financial account covers all types of financial assets that can be bought 
and sold internationally. It is divided into three main categories, each with many 
subcomponents. The three main categories are (1) the net acquisition of financial 
assets, (2) the net incurrence of liabilities, and (3) changes in financial derivatives. 
Financial assets include bank accounts, stocks and bonds, real property such as 
factories, businesses, real estate, and monetary gold and foreign currencies that 
can be used to settle international payments. A positive net acquisition of finan-
cial assets implies that the country’s residents are buying more foreign assets than 
they are selling. A positive net incurrence of liabilities means that foreigners are 
purchasing more of the home country’s assets than they are selling. Seen another 
way, the acquisition of financial assets is a form of lending by the home country 
that takes place through the purchase of foreign owned real estate, stocks, bonds, 
or some other asset form. The net incurrence of liabilities is symmetrical in the

The financial account measures capital inflows and outflows. A positive value for the net acqui-
sition of assets is net lending abroad while a positive value for net incurrence of liabilities is net 
borrowing from abroad. The financial account balance (5b) indicates net lending (positive) or 
net borrowing (negative). The statistical discrepancy is the difference between net lending and 
borrowing on financial account and the current plus capital accounts (line 5b minus line 5a).

sense that it is a form of borrowing by the home country that takes place through 
the sale of home country assets to foreigners.
The third category of the financial account is financial derivatives. These are 
assets with a value that is derived from the value of some other asset, such as 
commodity prices or exchange rates, or one of many other possibilities. They are 
complex financial contracts that are traded in a variety of forms, and until recently 
were not included in the balance of payments. Their inclusion in 2006 is thought 
to have eliminated a growing source of measurement error, as derivatives have 
become increasingly important in global finance.
Table 9.3 shows the financial account in relation to the current and capital 
accounts. Two points about the financial account should be kept in mind. First, 
it presents the flow of assets during the year and not the stock of assets that have 
accumulated over time. Second, all flows are “net” changes rather than “gross” 
changes. Net changes are the differences between assets sold and assets bought, as 
when U.S. residents purchase shares in the Mexican stock market while simultane-
ously selling Mexican bonds. The net change in U.S.-owned assets is the difference 
between the value of the shares purchased and the bonds sold. If the stocks and 
bonds are equal in value, then the net change is zero. Net changes are informative 
because they measure the monetary value of the change in a country’s financial 
stake in foreign economies.
Under the accounting procedure used to tabulate credits and debits in the 
financial account, payments made abroad to buy financial assets are a debit, while 
payments received from abroad for selling home country assets (net incurrence of 
liabilities) are a credit. In this sense, credits can be viewed as the inflow received 
when assets are sold to foreigners and debits are the payment outflow when finan-
cial assets are purchased by home country residents. This way of looking at it 
makes the credits and debits of asset flows conceptually similar to the credits and 
debits of exports and imports.
The current, capital, and financial accounts are interdependent. The current 
and capital accounts measure the flows of goods, services, and transfers between 
a country and the rest of the world, and the financial account measures the net 
flows of asset purchases and sales. Because each element in the current account 
must include a financial transaction that is a payment or receipt, the current plus 
capital account must equal the financial account. A negative value in the current 
plus capital account implies net borrowing by the home country. This must show 
up in the financial account as net borrowing as well. The financial account of the 
United States shows it lends as well as borrows, but on net, it borrows. Table 9.3 
shows that the U.S. lent abroad through the net acquisition of financial assets 
worth $792 billion. At the same time, the United States incurred liabilities or bor-
rowed $977 billion from foreigners. Its balance on financial account is the amount 
lent minus the amount borrowed, or $792 billion minus $977 billion plus the net 
change in financial derivatives (-$54), or -$239.
The last item to discuss in Table 9.3 is the statistical discrepancy on line 4. Since it 
is impossible to record all transactions and to ensure they are accurately measured, 

Chapter 9    Trade and the Balance of Payments 
215
the amount of net lending or borrowing on the current and capital accounts rarely 
matches the amount implied by the financial account balance. The statistical dis-
crepancy is calculated as the residual difference between the financial account 
balance minus the current plus capital account balances (-239 - (-390) = 151). 
In a sense, it is the size of the measurement error. 
While the current and financial accounts are mirror images of each other, a 
large share of a nation’s gross financial account transactions is not in response to 
the current account flows of goods, services, or income. For example, a London-
based investment company may buy stock in a Chilean firm, lend money to the 
government of Thailand, and engage in any number of financial transactions 
that have nothing to do with the movements of goods and services on the current 
account. In an accounting sense, these purely financial transactions must have a 
net value of zero. The reason is that the purchase of an asset is simultaneously 
the sale of an asset of equal value. For example, if you buy a share of stock, you 
obtain an asset that is partial ownership of a company while the person selling 
the share obtains your cash. It is the same internationally. If a Canadian citizen 
buys shares in the Mexican stock market (capital outflow), he or she must sell 
Canadian dollars or some other asset (capital inflow). (If he or she pays for the 
shares by writing a check drawn on a Mexican bank, then it does not enter the 
financial account since it is a change of one foreign asset for another.) As a result, 
the financial account is a complete picture of net flows of financial assets during 
the year.
One of the primary concerns of most governments is the form of financial 
flows entering and leaving the country. Some financial flows are very mobile and 
represent short-run tendencies. These flows are often vehicles for transmitting a 
financial crisis from one country to another or for generating sudden responses 
to changes in investor expectations about the short-run prospects of an economy. 
The degree of mobility of financial flows and the potential of some flows to intro-
duce a large element of volatility into an economy have turned the type of flows 
that a country receives into a major issue.
As a first approach to a more detailed representation of the financial account, it 
is useful to subdivide the financial flows in Table 9.3 into more specific subcatego-
ries. Table 9.4 shows the 2014 financial account for the United States, divided into 
seven subcategories representing the main components of outflows and inflows, 
or net assets acquired (outflow) and net liabilities incurred (inflow).
Line 1a in Table 9.4 shows a net acquisition of $357 billion of direct invest-
ments outside the United States, while line 2a shows a net incurrence of $132 
billion in direct investment liabilities. The first number (1a) represents the pur-
chase of factories, businesses, real estate, office buildings, and other forms of 
real property outside the United States by U.S. residents and businesses. The 
second item (2a) is symmetrical in that it represents the purchase in the United 
States of a similar category of items by foreign residents and businesses. For-
eign direct investment (FDI)  was discussed in Chapter 4 where Dunning’s OLI 
theory was presented. In general, FDI  varies considerably from year to year 

216
Part 3    International Finance
since it depends on the number of purchases and sales by foreigners, and is often 
linked to mergers. Once made, however, FDI is probably less likely to leave a 
country, particularly when compared to the next category of items in lines 1b 
and 1c and 2b and 2c.
Portfolio investments (1b and 2b) and the other investments (1c and 2c) are 
paper assets and liabilities. The main portfolio items are stocks and bonds, while 
the other investment category mainly includes currencies, bank deposits and loans, 
and insurance contracts. FDI, portfolio investments, and other investments assets 
all give their holders a claim on a country’s future output, but they are very differ-
ent in their time horizons. FDI which represents real assets as opposed to paper 
assets tends to have a longer time-horizon and is much less liquid than most of the 
items in the other two categories. As such, FDI represents a longer term position 
in the country. Portfolio investments and most other investments, by contrast, can 
be long- or short-term, but they are far more liquid and easier to dispose of in the 
event of a sudden change in the economy or in investor expectations. This poses 
a significant challenge for economic policymakers.
When investor expectations change, it can cause a sudden stop in inflows, 
followed by large destabilizing outflows. The economist Guillermo Calvo

In addition, every country buys and sells reserve assets which are monetary gold and foreign 
currencies used for international payments.

coined the term sudden stop to describe a quick reversal of portfolio or other 
assets and notes that they have been involved in most recent financial crises. 
In terms of Table 9.4, a sudden stop would appear as a shift from one period to 
the next in categories 2b and 2c. Specifically, there would be a drop in the net 
incurrence of liabilities as capital inflows ceased. In a severe crisis, net incur-
rence of liabilities might turn negative, implying that foreigners are selling off 
their holdings of home country assets. Categories 1b and 1c might drop as well, 
as home country residents stop acquiring foreign assets so that they can pay-off 
foreigners who are converting assets in the home country into cash and repatri-
ating to their own country or to a third party country. If home country residents 
are forced to sell off foreign assets in order to obtain the liquidity they need 
to pay-off investors, categories 1b and 1c can become negative, representing 
a net reduction in the home country’s holding of foreign portfolio and other 
financial assets.
Reserve assets are shown in category 1d. These are mainly the currencies of 
the largest and most stable economies in the world: U.S. dollars, European Union 
(EU) euros, British pounds, the Japanese yen, and recently the Chinese yuan 
(November 2015). In addition to key currencies, reserve assets also include mon-
etary gold and special drawing rights (SDR), the artificial currency of the IMF. 
Since the financial account reports financial flows, it does not indicate the stock, 
or total supply, of assets available. From Table 9.4, we see that the United States 
had a net change of -$4 billion in official reserve assets. This represents payment 
for the purchase of official reserve assets, but does not indicate the total amount 
of reserve assets available to the United States. Since all forms of international 
debts can be settled with reserve assets, especially key currencies, these assets 
play a prominent role in international finance. When they become scarce in a 
country, it signals that potentially serious problems are arising. For example, 
when Mexico’s economy collapsed in late 1994 and early 1995, it was because 
Mexicans owed dollars to various international investors but lacked dollars to 
pay them. The outflow of dollars from Mexico during 1994 severely reduced 
the supply of dollars and, in the short run, made it impossible for firms and the 
government to pay their dollar-denominated debts. Relief came when Mexico 
was able to arrange several loans from the IMF, the United States, and Canada, 
which replenished its supply of official reserve assets. (See the case study in 
Chapter 12.)
Reserve assets are used to settle international debts; consequently, central 
banks and treasury ministries use them as a store of value. For example, when an 
importer in a small country such as Chile purchases goods from Europe, payment 
may be in dollars or another reserve currency, but the supplier probably would 
not accept Chilean pesos from the purchaser. The importer must convert some 
pesos into a reserve currency which it can use to pay for its imports. If the Chilean 
Central Bank cannot provide dollars or another reserve currency to Chilean banks 
and importers, then the import business grinds to a halt unless the importer can 
secure some form of credit from the seller.

218
Part 3    International Finance
Limits on Financial Flows
Throughout the second half of the twentieth century, many nations limited the 
movement of financial flows across their national borders. A typical pattern was 
to allow financial flows related to transactions on the current account, but to limit 
and regulate financial account transactions. If an importer needed a foreign loan 
to purchase goods abroad, or if an exporter needed foreign financing to buy mate-
rials to make goods for export, the financial flows were regulated but generally 
allowed. Conversely, if a bank wanted to borrow abroad to make loans at home, 
then the inflow of financial capital to the bank was prohibited or subjected to such 
onerous terms and conditions that it was undesirable. These types of restrictions 
on financial flows were a normal part of the international economic landscape, 
even in many high-income industrial economies, until the 1980s and 1990s. For 
example, the members of the EU did not completely liberalize financial flows 
between member countries until 1993.
A movement toward more open financial markets over the last several decades 
included a significant lifting of controls on financial flows across international 
boundaries. This change in international economic policy was seen as desirable 
because restrictions on financial flows limit the availability of financial capital. 
Low- and middle-income countries, in particular, were thought to benefit from 
the liberalization of capital markets since they have the greatest scarcity of finan-
cial capital. Frequently, the quantity of investment in low- and medium-income 
countries depends on their access to the financial capital of high-income countries.
In addition to the positive benefits for growth, it is sometimes impossible for 
regulators to identify and separate financial flows that occur for reasons of finan-
cial transactions from those that are related to transactions on the current account. 
Consequently, it can be difficult to regulate or control international financial flows 
and the attempt to do so can lead to red tape, bureaucratic delay, and arbitrari-
ness, all of which can reduce economic efficiency. For over two decades, from the 
1980s until the crisis of 2007–2009, many economists argued that it is better to 
allow financial capital to move freely across international borders.
More recently, the extreme volatility in some financial markets and the severe 
damage it has caused to many countries has revived interest in regulations to limit 
the damage caused by unexpectedly large financial outflows. As the pendulum 
has swung back toward seeing benefits in more regulation of financial flows, it 
has generated a certain amount of tension between policymakers, politicians, and 
business people. It is easy to understand why. On the one hand, foreign capital 
inflows are beneficial because they enable countries to increase their investments 
in factories, ports, and other physical assets that help raise living standards and 
incomes. On the other hand, the sudden outward flight of foreign financial capital 
can generate a debt crisis and throw a country into deep depression. The key is to 
capture the benefits of increased investment while minimizing the risks of capital 
flight. At this point there is not much consensus among economists about the best 
policies. We will look at this issue in more detail in Chapter 12 after we introduce 
several more concepts.

C A SE  S T U D Y
The Crisis of 2007–2009 and the Balance 
of Payments
The global financial crisis that began in 2007 had both medium-run and 
­short-run impacts on the balance of payments. In the United States and else-
where, the first stages of the crisis began in the late summer of 2007 with severe 
strains in financial markets. Throughout late 2007 and into 2008, banks and 
other financial services firms such as insurance companies and securities deal-
ers reassessed their portfolios and tried to reduce their risk exposure by selling 
their foreign assets in large quantities. The goal was to build reserves of short-
term, highly liquid, and secure assets such as cash and U.S. Treasury securities. 
These strains continued into 2008 and then intensified with the bankruptcy of 
several large financial services firms that had significant international business.
Banks and financial firms knew that some of the assets they held were 
“toxic” and unlikely to maintain their value or any value at all in some cases. 
As the crisis progressed, problems grew more intractable as it became increas-
ingly difficult to determine a market value for assets that had stopped trading 
and had no reference prices available. If banks could not sell their assets, then 
they could not build their cash reserves for handling their potential losses. The 
consequences would be disastrous, since they would lack the liquidity to pay 
their own debts. The shifts in financial markets that began in late summer and 
early fall of 2007 were sudden, and continued throughout 2008. The reversal 
in the normal pattern of global finance is illustrated in Table 9.5, which shows 
the main components of the financial account of the United States for 2007 
and 2008.
Table 9.5 shows that both foreign and U.S. domestic interests shifted toward 
a defensive stance from 2007 to 2008 as they stopped accumulating each other’s 
assets altogether, or greatly reduced their purchases. In 2007, the US acquired 
over $1.5 trillion in financial assets ($1,572,509,000,000). The crisis year of 2008 
was entirely different, however, and U.S. interests were net sellers of financial 
assets. The negative value of -$309 billion represented a selling off of ­foreign 
financial assets, as opposed to the normal pattern in which U.S. interests are 
net purchasers. All of the subcategories under Line 1 declined in value, but the 
primary causes of the net sell-off were declines in portfolio holdings abroad 
(stocks and bonds) and other investments, which is mostly bank lending. In 
other words, U.S. households and businesses sold their foreign stocks and 
bonds and they reduced the loans they were making abroad. Net purchases of 
businesses, real estate, and other forms of foreign direct investment remained 
positive, illustrating the less volatile nature of that type of foreign capital flow.

THE CURRENT ACCOUNT AND THE MACROECONOMY
LO 9.4	 Use a simple algebraic model to relate the current account to savings, 
investment, and the general government budget balance.
LO 9.5	 Discuss the pros and cons of current account deficits.
There are two important practical reasons for learning about the balance of pay-
ments. One is to understand the broader implications of current account imbal-
ances and to analyze the policies that might be used to tame a current account 
Line 2 shows that foreigners accumulated far fewer U.S. assets in 2008 than 
they did in 2007 ($2,182 trillion vs $454 billion). The biggest change occurred 
in the area of loans to U.S. banks and nonfinancial firms, which moved from 
a net inflow to the United States of nearly $687 billion to a net outflow of 
-402 billion (line 2c). At the same time, foreign purchases of securities fell by 
over $600 billion.
In general, Table 9.5 illustrates how firms in both the United States and 
abroad sought to protect themselves against the spreading crisis by reducing 
new investments outside their home country and by bringing liquid assets 
home.

deficit. This is particularly important for small countries that are easily buffeted 
about by changes in the global economy, but it is also of interest to a big economy 
such as the United States, where very large current account deficits have been the 
norm for several years. The second practical reason for studying the balance of 
payments is to understand how countries might avoid a crisis brought on by vola-
tile financial flows, and what policies will minimize the harmful effects of a crisis if 
it occurs. Economic analysis is still in its infancy when it comes to the problem of 
volatile financial flows, and there is some distance to travel before there is likely 
to be a consensus agreement on issues such as free versus restricted capital mobil-
ity, or the links from financial flows to economic growth. Nevertheless, there are 
some basic points of agreement among economists, and we will discuss them in 
Chapters 10 and 12. Before then, we must examine the relationship of the current 
account to the macroeconomy, which requires a brief review of basic concepts 
from the principles of macroeconomics.
The National Income and Product Accounts
The internal, domestic accounting systems that countries use to keep track of total 
production and total income are called the national income and product accounts 
(NIPA). These accounts are very detailed presentations of income, output, and 
other measures of a nation’s macroeconomy. We will use the most fundamen-
tal concepts from this accounting system, beginning with the concept of gross 
­domestic product (GDP). Recall from the principles of economics that a nation’s 
gross domestic product is the market value of all final goods and services pro-
duced inside its borders during some time period, usually a year. GDP is the most 
common measure of the size of an economy, although it is widely recognized that 
it ignores some important considerations, such as the value of leisure time and 
environmental degradation that takes place during the process of producing the 
nation’s output. In addition, GDP includes only goods that pass through organized 
markets, so household production (cooking, sewing, landscaping, childcare, and 
so on) and other nonmarket-oriented production are left out. For these and other 
reasons, economists caution against using GDP as the sole determinant of the 
well-being of a society. In spite of these limitations, however, it provides a starting 
point for understanding different economies.
To avoid the problem of double counting, GDP includes only the value of final 
goods and services. This is actually a strength of the measure, since if we added 
the value of steel sold to a car maker and the value of the cars, we would be count-
ing the steel twice: once as steel, and a second time as part of the value of the 
car. The final part of the definition states that GDP must be measured over some 
time period, usually a year. Most countries measure GDP every 3 months, but for 
most purposes, including ours, the most useful time period to consider is one year.
An alternative concept for measuring a nation’s output is gross national prod-
uct (GNP). For most countries, the difference between the two concepts is very 
small, because GNP is the value of all final goods and services produced by the 
labor, capital, and other resources of a country, regardless of where production 

222
Part 3    International Finance
occurred. In an accounting sense, GNP is equal to GDP plus investment income 
and unilateral transfers received from foreigners minus investment income and 
unilateral transfers paid to foreigners:
 GDP + foreign income received
 - income paid to foreigners
 + foreign transfers received
 - transfers paid to foreigners = GNP
Note that the difference between GNP and GDP is precisely equal to the credits 
minus debits in lines 2 and 3 in Table 9.1, which is the same as net primary income 
plus net secondary income. This fact is useful because GDP includes exports minus 
imports and it enables us to bring the entire current account concept into the picture.
The usefulness of adding net primary foreign income plus net secondary income is 
apparent when we look at the definition of GDP based on its four main components. 
Table 9.6 defines the necessary variables. GDP is equal to the sum of consumer 
expenditures plus investment expenditures plus government expenditures on goods 
and services plus exports of goods and services minus imports of goods and services:
	
GDP = C + I + G + X - M	
(9.1)
Given that GNP is equal to GDP plus net primary income and net secondary 
income:
	
GNP = GDP + (Net primary income + net secondary incomes)	
(9.2)
Or
GNP = (C + I + G) + (X - M + Net primary income + net secondary income)

we can write the definition of GNP in terms of the current account balance. 
Rewriting Equation (9.3) in a simpler form gives us the following:
	
GNP = C + I + G + CA	
(9.4)
Equation (9.4) explicitly shows the relationship between the current account 
and the main macroeconomic variables such as consumer spending, investment, 
and government purchases.
As the total value of goods and services produced by the labor, capital, and 
other resources of a country, GNP is also the value of income received. This 
follows from the fact that the production of final goods and services generates 
incomes equal in value to output and is embodied in the basic macroeconomic 
accounting identity stating that every economy’s income must equal its output. 
From the point of view of the income recipients, there are three choices or obliga-
tions: They may consume their income (C), save it (S), or use it to pay taxes (T). 
In reality, all of us do a combination of the three. This permits us to rewrite the 
definition of GNP in terms of income and its uses as follows:
	
GNP = C + S + T	
(9.5)
Since Equations (9.4) and (9.5) are equivalent definitions of GNP—one in 
terms of the components of output, the other in terms of the uses of income—we 
can set them equal to each other as follows:
	
C + I + G + CA = C + S + T	
(9.6)
Subtracting consumption from both sides and rearranging terms gives us the 
following:
	
I + G + CA = S + T	
(9.7)
or
	
S + (T - G) = I + CA	
(9.8)
Equation (9.8) is an accounting identity, or something that is true by definition. 
It is worth memorizing because it summarizes the important relationship between 
the current account balance, investment, and public and private savings in the 
economy. Equation (9.8) does not reveal any of the causal mechanisms through 
which changes in savings or investment are connected to the current account bal-
ance, but it does provide insight into the economy. For example, if total savings 
remains unchanged while investment increases, then the current account balance 
must move toward, or deeper into, deficit.
To see this, be sure that you understand the term on the left side, (T - G). 
This is the combined (federal, state, and local) budget balances of all levels of 
government, or, put another way, government savings. It is savings because (T) is 
government revenue (or income) and (G) is government expenditure. A positive 
(T - G) states that the combined government budgets are in surplus, which in 
the governmental sector is equivalent to savings. Conversely, a negative (T - G) 
is a deficit, or dissavings. Placing governmental budget balances on the left-hand 

224
Part 3    International Finance
side emphasizes that there are two sources of savings in an economy: the private 
sector (S) and the public or governmental sector (T - G). If governments dissave 
(run deficits), then they must borrow from the private sector, which reduces total 
national savings on the left-hand side.
From Equation (9.8) we see that a nation’s savings (private plus public) is 
divided into two uses. First, it is a source of funds for domestic investment (I). This 
role is crucial because new investments in machinery and equipment are a source 
of economic growth. Investment is essential to upgrade the skills of the labor 
force, to provide more capital on the job, and to improve the quality of capital by 
introducing new technology. According to Equation (9.8), if government budgets 
are in deficit, the total supply of national savings is reduced, and, all else being 
equal, investment will be less than it might otherwise have been. Conversely, a 
surplus in government budgets will augment private savings and increase the funds 
available for investment, all else being equal.
The second use for national savings is as a source of funds for foreign invest-
ment. If the current account is in surplus, national savings finances the purchase 
of domestic goods by foreign users of those goods. In return, or as payment, the 
domestic economy acquires foreign financial assets. Recall from the discussion 
of the relationship between the current and financial accounts that the financial 
account reflects the same amount of lending or borrowing as the current account. 
If the current account is negative, there is net borrowing that will also be visible 
in the financial account as net borrowing, or in the terminology of Tables 9.3 and 
9.4, a net incurrence of liabilities (borrowing, or financial inflows) that is greater 
than the net acquisition of financial assets (lending, or financial outflows). In other 
words, a negative current account is associated with net borrowing in the financial 
account, which is an inflow of financial capital. Equivalence between the inflow’s 
magnitude and the current account surplus (other than the statistical discrepancy) 
ensures that home country businesses, households, and governments, obtain the 
financial resources they need to buy more goods and services than they sell in 
world markets. In a sense, surplus countries provides savings to the rest of the 
world, thereby making it possible for them to sell more goods abroad than they 
buy. For a surplus country, a financial capital outflow is an investment because 
it involves the acquisition of assets that are expected to pay a future return. It is 
not the same as domestic investment, however, because the assets are outside 
the country. Hence, another name for the current account balance is net foreign 
investment. A positive balance implies positive foreign investment, while a nega-
tive balance implies that foreigners accumulate more home country assets than 
the home country accumulates abroad.
The United States has had a current account deficit every year since 1981 with 
the exception of 1991, when it received large income payments in compensation 
for the Gulf War (see Figure 9.1). In 2010, the deficit was 3.2 percent of GNP. 
Figure 9.2 shows the current account balance since 2001 and the three related 
macroeconomic variables from Equation (9.8). As shown, the financial crisis and 
recession of 2007–2009 had a dramatic effect on savings, investment, and gov-
ernment budgets, and a smaller effect on the current account. Savings rose as 

Chapter 9    Trade and the Balance of Payments 
225
households and businesses cut back on purchases, and investment fell as busi-
nesses saw fewer opportunities for expansion. Balances of combined state, local, 
and federal budgets fell into large deficits as tax payments declined and gov-
ernment assistance programs spent more on social benefits for the unemployed 
and struggling households. In addition, there was an improvement in the current 
account balance as falling U.S. incomes resulted in fewer imports.
The four macroeconomic variables in Figure 9.2 demonstrate that there is not 
a fixed relationship between current account balances and government budget 
balances, or between savings and investment. Each of the four variables is deter-
mined by the other three, and a change in any one of them influences all of the 
others. For example, during an economic recession, most countries experience 
government budget deficits. As noted, state, local, and federal governments all 
saw dramatic increases in their deficits from 2007 to 2010 as unemployment rose 
and tax collections fell. Nevertheless, the U.S. current account balance improved 
slightly due to the fall in consumption and the decline in spending on imports. 
Some other countries experienced the same pattern as the U.S. of increasing gov-
ernment budget deficits and falling current account deficits, (e.g., Spain) while 
still others watched as their budget deficits increased but the current account bal-
ances had little or no change (e.g., Germany). The link from any one of the four 
macroeconomic variables to any of the others is mediated by the other two, and 
changes in one variable can be amplified or offset by changes elsewhere.

Part 3    International Finance
The availability of global financial flows has made it easier for current account 
deficit countries to obtain the outside financing they need when their domestic 
savings is inadequate. Global capital flows have not completely broken the link 
between domestic savings and domestic investment, as most countries have savings 
and investment levels that are roughly similar. This is not true for every country, 
however, and in recent years it has been less and less true overall. For example, 
developing countries with relatively low savings such as Honduras, Ethiopia, and 
Kenya have managed to invest much larger shares of their GDP than they could if 
they relied on their domestic savings alone. This is possible because capital inflows 
are available to finance their current account deficits and to provide an additional 
source of funding for investment.
Are Current Account Deficits Harmful?
The relationship between the current account balance, investment, and total 
national savings is an identity. Consequently, it does not tell us why an economy 
runs a current account deficit or surplus. In Equation (9.8), the left and right sides 
are equal by definition. Consequently, we cannot say that the current account is 
in deficit because saving is too low any more than we can say it is because invest-
ment is too high.
There is a general tendency in the media and the public to interpret a cur-
rent account deficit as a sign of weakness and as harmful to the nation’s welfare. 
Another interpretation is that the deficit enables more investment than would 
be possible otherwise, and since higher investment is correlated with higher 
living standards, the current account deficit might be interpreted as beneficial. 
In addition, the capital inflows associated with current account deficits are an 
implicit vote of confidence by foreigners. For example, between 1980 and 1991, 
Japan invested more than $25 billion of its trade surplus in U.S. manufacturing. 
By the start of the 1990s, the Japanese owned 66 steel works, 20 rubber and tire 
factories, 8 major car assembly plants, and 270 auto parts suppliers, employing 
more than 100,000 workers. Furthermore, the investment came at a time when 
the three major U.S.-based auto manufacturers (Chrysler, Ford, and GM) were 
laying off workers and relocating production abroad. Some of the Japanese firms 
were acquisitions (which may have closed if they had not been bought), and many 
were new plants built with Japanese savings. During the U.S. current account 
deficits of the 1990s, foreign investors continued to pour in capital, enabling the 
United States to raise its level of investment and increase its productivity in spite 
of its declining savings rate. In this particular case, the current account deficit has 
been beneficial because, all else being equal, it enabled more investment than was 
possible otherwise, given the savings rate.
Current account deficits can also generate problems, however. The capital 
inflows that occur with a current account deficit increase the stock of ­foreign-owned 
assets inside the home country, raising the possibility that a change in investor 
expectations about the economy’s future can lead to a sudden surge in capital 
outflows. In the worst case scenario, capital flight is followed by a depletion of 

Chapter 9    Trade and the Balance of Payments 
227
international reserves and a financial crisis. This is an experience shared by a 
number of developing countries since the 1980s, but it should not lead you to 
believe that the optimal policy for a country is to avoid current account deficits. 
As we have just seen, such deficits allow countries to invest more than they could 
otherwise, and this is particularly important for developing countries where invest-
ment capital is especially scarce. Furthermore, current account surpluses are no 
guarantee that a country will be able to avoid a crisis if one develops among its 
trading partners. International financial crises, like some biological diseases, tend 
to be contagious. When Mexico slipped into the peso crisis in late 1994 and early 
1995, for example, economists and journalists began to write about the “Tequila 
effect” on Latin America. Similarly, when Thailand’s currency lost a large share 
of its value in July of 1997, the media reported stories of crisis spreading across 
East Asia and the rest of the developing world. In both cases, the size of a coun-
try’s current account balances was not a good predictor of whether it was drawn 
into the crisis. (See Chapter 12 for a more detailed discussion of financial crises.)
The experiences of countries in the 1980s and 1990s has taught economists 
that financial crises are determined by more than the size of the current account 
deficit, and that there are no absolute thresholds between safe and dangerous 
levels of a deficit. While deficits of 3 to 4 percent of GDP begin to raise red flags, 
and deficits of 7 to 9 percent are considered extremely risky, too many other 
factors must be taken into consideration before the probability of a crisis can be 
determined.
C A SE  S T U D Y 
Current Account Deficits in the United States
Figures 9.1and 9.2 illustrate the growing problem of the U.S. current account 
deficit. In 2015, the deficit was over $460 billion and more than 2.5 percent of 
GDP. As high as it was, the deficit in 2015 was significantly smaller than it had 
been in the first years of the twenty-first century, when it was often above 4 
and even 5 percent of GDP (Figure 9.1). For most developed countries, current 
account deficits in the range of 4 to 5 percent of GDP usually trigger adjust-
ments that force a reduction in their size. It seems only natural to ask whether 
the crisis that began in 2007 is related to the size of the U.S. current account 
deficit.
In Figure 9.1, there are two periods of widening current account deficits. In 
the 1980s, the deficit widened, then closed. The second episode began in the 
early 1990s with a deficit that continued to expand until very recently. While 
the current account deficits look similar in these two episodes, the movements 
of the other variables in Equation (9.8) were significantly different.

Part 3    International Finance
Beginning around 1981, the budget of the federal government turned the 
combined federal, state, and local government balance (T - G), into a large 
negative number. Given the lack of private savings to finance both domestic 
investment (I) and public sector dissaving, foreign finance filled the gap and 
the current account turned negative. The 1990s story is different in several 
ways, but perhaps most importantly, in that over the course of the decade, the 
federal budget moved from a large deficit to a small surplus. If everything had 
remained the same, this would have reduced the need for foreign savings and 
pushed the current account in the direction of surplus, but (S) and (I) were not 
constant. The decade saw sharp increases in investment spending as corpora-
tions bought new computer technology and telecommunications equipment 
they needed to stay competitive. In addition, a stock market boom followed by 
a housing market boom made consumers much wealthier, with the result that 
households rapidly increased their consumption and decreased their personal 
savings. Therefore, the changes in the government budget were overwhelmed 
by the increases in investment and by the decline in savings, resulting in a 
large and growing current account deficit. In 2002, large federal budget defi-
cits returned and put additional pressure on the United States to seek foreign 
financing for its domestic and foreign investment.
Before the crisis that began in 2007, a central concern of some observers 
was whether or not the U.S. current account deficit posed a danger to the 
U.S. economy. After the crisis began, a separate set of questions surfaced 
about the role of the deficit in creating the crisis itself. While no one argued 
that the current account deficits caused the crisis, there is perhaps a signifi-
cant relationship between the crisis and the current account. In order for the 
United States to run a significant current account deficit over many years, it 
had to be financed by countries with surpluses that collectively matched it. In 
terms of the balance of payments, U.S. current account deficits were financed 
by capital inflows in its financial account. These net capital inflows repre-
sented the trade surpluses of countries such as Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia,  
Russia, and China, which were invested in the United States. In other words, 
the counterpart to U.S. deficits was a series of surpluses elsewhere in the 
global economy.
In effect, the willingness of governments and firms outside the United States 
to invest their earnings inside the United States enabled it to run large current 
account deficits over a long period while maintaining a low level of public and 
private savings. This had a number of consequences, including the provision 
of financing for the housing boom of the 2000s and the consumption spree 
(low savings rates) of many Americans. Housing finance was awash in funds 
to lend, consumer credit was extremely easy to get, and many Americans had 
lifestyles supported by their indirect access to the savings of households, firms, 
and governments abroad. In Germany, Japan, China, and other surplus coun-
tries, savings rates were high, consumption ran well below incomes, and trade 
surpluses grew larger and larger, particularly after 2000.

Chapter 9    Trade and the Balance of Payments 
229
INTERNATIONAL DEBT
Current account deficits must be financed through inflows of financial capital. 
Recall from Table 9.5 and the previous discussion that capital inflows take differ-
ent forms, from direct investment to purchases of stocks, bonds, and currency, to 
loans. Loans from abroad add to a country’s stock of external debt and generate 
debt service obligations requiring interest payments and repayment of the princi-
pal. External debt is defined as a debt that must be paid in a foreign currency. It 
includes the debts on borrowings by both governments and the private sector, and 
long- and short-term debt, where short term is anything under a year. Theoreti-
cally, foreign loans are no more harmful than any other type of debt. That is, as 
long as the borrowed funds are used to increase skills and production levels, the 
borrower will be able to service the debt without difficulty. In practice, however, 
it is not uncommon for borrowed funds to be used in a manner that does not 
contribute to the expansion of the country’s productive capacity, and often debt 
service becomes an unsustainable burden that holds back economic development.
Most countries, rich and poor, have external debt. In high-income countries, 
debt service is rarely an issue, because the amount of debt is usually relatively 
small compared to the size of the economy. Furthermore, many high-income coun-
tries are able to borrow in their own currencies. Countries such as the United 
States, Japan, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and others have all their debt 
denominated in their own currencies and are relieved of the pressure of having to 
run large trade surpluses in order to make payments on the principal and interest 
of their debt. Low- and middle-income countries are another matter. In a number 
If these global imbalances were short run, or if they were used to make a 
series of investments that raised productivity (which they did, in part), then 
the problems they caused would not be severe. However, some economists 
argue that the global imbalances were at the root of the crisis that began in 
2007 because they persisted for a long time and encouraged the gradual accu-
mulation of problems, such as risky lending, that eventually became extremely 
severe. Financial market regulators were not prepared for large inflows of 
foreign capital and lacked sufficient experience to understand the hidden dan-
gers if the inflows persisted over a long period. Banks and securities firms that 
received deposits felt pressure to make loans so they would have earnings to 
cover the interest on their deposits. Over a period of many years, the steady 
availability of funds from surplus countries helped hold interest rates down 
and encouraged borrowing, especially for big-ticket items such as houses and 
cars. Easy money for home loans raised the demand for housing and pushed up 
home prices. Rising prices made homes seem like a safe investment, which only 
encouraged more borrowing and further building. When home prices began to 
fall, the entire system unraveled, causing enormous losses for the banks and 
others tied up in the home loan market.

230
Part 3    International Finance
of cases, the size of the external debt burden is unsustainable, given the economy’s 
ability to make interest payments and to repay the principal.
Unsustainable debt occurs for many reasons. Sometimes, countries are depen-
dent on exports of one or two basic commodities such as copper or coffee. The 
shock of a sudden drop in world commodity prices reduces the value of exports 
and sometimes generates unexpectedly large current account deficits. In other 
cases, countries experience natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, 
that create a need for relief and foreign assistance, or civil conflicts that fuel a 
demand for arms purchases. Corruption, too, can play a role, as described later in 
the case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Even electoral poli-
tics may be a factor, as when officials try to gain support through unsustainable 
expenditures targeted at important constituents. Finally, the behavior of foreign 
lenders also plays a role, as described in the DRC case study in the next section.
Debt is a serious problem. In 2014, the world’s low- and middle-income 
­countries had total debt obligations over $5.3 trillion, which required more than 
$600 billion a year in interest and principal repayment. Debt burdens worsen the 
budget position of central governments by adding payments that must be made 
to outsiders, and they reduce the availability of funds for important domestic 
needs such as infrastructure projects, schools, and health care. In addition, there 
are many examples of excessive debt burdens that have intensified and spread 
economic crises.
Debt problems of developing countries have received considerable attention 
in recent years from multilateral organizations such as the World Bank, from 
governments of high-income governments, and from private organizations that 
have argued for debt relief. One notable movement is the Highly Indebted Poor 
Country (HIPC) program, which is a joint venture of the World Bank, the IMF, 
and high-income-country governments. The goal of the HIPC program is to pro-
vide debt forgiveness for a select group of countries that must qualify based on 
high levels of poverty and debt and a track record of economic reform. As of 2013, 
the thirty-five of the thirty-nine HIPC countries had received debt forgiveness.
C A S E  S T U D Y
Odious Debt
Countries classified as HIPC are some of the poorest in the world. Their average 
income per capita in 2014 was $899 and life expectancy at birth was 60.3 years 
(2013). Given the countries’ conditions of extreme poverty, it is hard to argue 
against debt relief, yet some people question its value. Their primary argument 
is that it would be wasted money since the conditions that created debt are likely 
to persist, leading to a new round of borrowing and a return to previous levels 

Chapter 9    Trade and the Balance of Payments 
231
of debt. Others worry that debt relief might cause some countries to borrow 
excessively in the belief that their debt burden will be forgiven later.
Economists do not have a single point of view on this issue, although many 
favor some sort of debt relief despite the arguments just made. The cost of debt 
forgiveness for the most severely indebted poor countries is inconsequential 
compared to the economies of the high-income countries, which are the ones 
that would be called upon to forgive the debts. In addition, some share of the 
debt is classified as odious debt, and in those cases the arguments in favor of 
debt relief are impossible to ignore. Odious debt is legally defined as debt 
incurred without the consent of the people and that is not used for their ben-
efit. It is associated with corrupt governments and countries where freedom 
is severely limited.
Many cases of odious debt can be found among the thirty-nine countries that 
qualify for the HIPC initiative. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, the DRC 
(formerly Zaire), Kenya, and Uganda almost certainly fall into this category, 
while at least part of the debt of many other countries would qualify them as 
well. Between 1972 and 1999, about 60 percent of the loans to HIPC went to 
regimes considered “not free” by Freedom House, an international organiza-
tion that ranks countries as free, partly free, or not free; and between 1985 and 
1995, about 67 percent of the loans made to HIPC went to places considered 
corrupt by the International Country Risk Guide, a risk analysis service.
The DRC is a clear-cut case. From 1965 to 1997, the DRC was ruled by 
the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. During Mobutu’s reign, real GDP, measured 
in the equivalent of U.S. dollars at 2000 prices, fell from $317 per person to 
$110 per person, while the regime amassed billions of dollars in foreign aid 
and loans. Mobutu’s personal fortune was estimated to have reached $4 to 
$6 billion, most of which was deposited in Swiss bank accounts. In 2004, per 
capita income was at $88 and international debts were around $12 billion. 
The latter was equivalent to about 225 percent of GDP and 1,280 percent of 
a year’s exports.
Given the continued decline in incomes and the large number of unfinished 
projects financed by various governments and multilateral agencies, there is 
little evidence that the borrowed money was successfully used for development 
purposes. Furthermore, lenders knew the situation when they made their loans, 
but they went ahead anyway since they wanted to secure access to the DRC’s 
mineral deposits of cobalt and other strategic metals. In cases like the DRC, it 
is difficult to argue that citizens should be forced to pay off the debt. In 2003, 
the DRC was admitted to the HIPC program and qualified for up to 80 percent 
debt forgiveness, and by 2010, more than half of its debt had been forgiven.

THE INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION
LO 9.6	 Show the relationship between a country’s balance of payments 
and its international investment position.
Each year that a nation runs a current account deficit, it borrows from abroad and 
adds to its indebtedness to foreigners. Each year that it runs a current account 
surplus, it lends to foreigners and reduces its overall indebtedness. If the total of 
all domestic assets owned by foreigners is subtracted from the total of all foreign 
assets owned by residents of the home country, the result is the international 
investment position. If the international investment position is positive, then the 
home country could sell all its foreign assets and have more than enough revenue 
to purchase all the domestic assets owned by foreigners. If it is negative, then sell-
ing all foreign assets would not provide enough revenue to buy all the domestic 
assets owned by foreigners.
Consider the international investment position of the United States at the 
end of 2014. The market value of all assets outside the United States and owned 
by governments, businesses, and residents of the United States was $24,595 bil-
lion. Among other things, these assets included factories, shares of stock, bonds, 
foreign currency, and bank loans. At the same time, the market value of assets 
located in the United States and owned by governments, businesses, and residents 
abroad was $31,615 billion. As a result, the international investment position of 
the United States at the end of 2014 was -$7,020 billion. To summarize:
International investment position
 = domestically owned foreign assets - foreign owned domestic assets
 = $24,595 billion - $31,615 billion
 = -$7,020 billion
The large current account deficits of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s have eroded 
the United States’ investment position from a positive $288.6 billion in 1983 to 
zero in 1989, and negative since then. Each year a country experiences a current 
account deficit, foreigners acquire more assets inside its boundaries than its resi-
dents acquire abroad, and the international investment position shrinks further.
We have considered many of the costs and benefits of capital inflows. They 
enable countries to invest more than would otherwise be the case, but they also 
make it possible for governments and consumers to spend more (save less). One 
of the benefits not discussed so far is the possibility of technology transfer. When 
capital inflows take the form of direct investment, they may bring new technolo-
gies, new management techniques, and new ideas to the host country. This transfer 
is particularly important for developing countries that lack access or information 
about newer technologies, but it is also important for high-income countries. Tech-
nology transfer is by no means an inevitable outcome of foreign direct investment, 
and much of the current research on this type of capital flow seeks to understand 
the conditions that encourage or discourage it.

Chapter 9    Trade and the Balance of Payments 
233
One of the costs of capital inflows is their potential to provide access to politi-
cal power. Much depends on the political culture of the host country receiving 
the capital inflows, but large direct investment flows, as well as portfolio invest-
ment flows, are likely to provide access to politically significant people. This is 
the case in large and small countries, but it is particularly important in low- and 
middle-income countries, where wealth encounters fewer countervailing powers 
or contending interests.
Summary
■
■Every nation’s transactions with the rest of the world are summarized in its 
balance of payments. The balance of payments has three components: the 
current account, the capital account, and the financial account. The two most 
important components are the current and financial accounts.
■
■The current account is a record of a nation’s trade, income, and transfers 
between it and the rest of the world.
■
■The financial account is a record of financial capital flows between a country 
and the rest of the world. It is measured as net acquisition of foreign assets 
and net incurrence of foreign liabilities.
■
■Capital flows in the financial account are categorized as direct investment, 
portfolio investment, other investment, which includes mostly bank loans, 
and reserve assets. In general, direct investment is longer term and, there-
fore, less volatile.
■
■Large, sudden outflows of financial capital have created economic instability 
in many countries, particularly during the 1990s. This has created an active 
debate over the merits of restricting foreign capital flows. Economists are 
divided on this point, with some favoring restrictions and some favoring free 
capital mobility.
■
■There is a fundamental economic identity that total private and public sav-
ing in an economy must be equal to domestic investment plus net foreign 
investment. The current account balance is equal to net foreign investment, 
and a negative balance is equivalent to disinvestment abroad.
■
■Current account deficits enable a country to invest more than it could oth-
erwise, which has a beneficial effect on national income. If deficits are too 
large, however, they increase the vulnerability of a country to sudden out-
flows of financial capital.
■
■Thirty-nine low-income countries are classified as highly indebted poor 
countries (HIPC). All have unsustainable debt levels, some of which may 
be considered odious debt because it is incurred without the consent of the 
country’s citizens and is not used for their benefit.

234
Part 3    International Finance
■
■The international investment position is the difference between ­foreign-based 
assets owned by residents in the home country and home-based assets owned 
by residents of foreign countries.
■
■Foreign investment has costs and benefits for the host country. While it may 
lead to technology transfer and higher investment levels, it can also become 
a mechanism for spreading a crisis and give foreigners a voice in the nation’s 
internal political affairs.

Measuring the International Investment Position
It may seem like a straightforward job to add up the value of assets, but nothing 
could be further from the truth. Consider the following problem: The United 
States ran trade surpluses in the 1950s and 1960s and accumulated large holdings 
of foreign assets. In the 1980s and 1990s, the United States ran trade deficits and 
foreigners accumulated large holdings inside the United States. By 2014, a sizable 
proportion of U.S.-owned assets had been purchased decades ago when prices 
were much lower, and foreign-owned assets were purchased recently, after the 
worldwide inflation of the 1970s and the early 1980s. If asset values are tallied 
using their historical costs (the price at the time of purchase), then foreign-owned 
APPENDIX A 

236
Part 3    International Finance
assets appear more valuable because they were acquired more recently when 
world prices were higher.
It seems logical to expect that the reporting of asset values would be done on a 
current cost basis rather than a historical cost basis, where current cost is the cost of 
purchasing the asset in the current period. Until 1991, the United States calculated 
only the historical cost of U.S.-owned foreign assets. As a result, the U.S. interna-
tional investment position appeared to become negative very rapidly as large trade 
deficits in the mid-1980s led to a rapid accumulation of new assets in the United 
States by foreign interests. In the 1990s, the United States began to report all assets 
on a current value basis. The primary deficiency in this data as it now stands is that 
it cannot be broken down into country-specific or industry-specific data. Therefore, 
we know the overall international investment position for the United States, but 
we cannot accurately examine the U.S.-Japan bilateral investment position, since 
we have U.S. assets in Japan only on a historical cost basis.
Balance of Payments Data
Current account and international investment data are readily available for most 
nations of the world.
Bureau of Economic Analysis
The Bureau of Economic Analysis is the official source of national income and 
product and international accounts data for the United States. It has an easy-
to-use Web site with a complete set of data for both the current and historical 
periods. It is located at http://www.bea.gov.
International Financial Statistics
International Financial Statistics (IFS) is a regular publication of the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF). A hardcopy appears monthly, with an annual Yearbook at 
the year’s end, and online access is available through the IMF’s website at http://
www.imf.org. As the name implies, the IFS focuses on financial data, but it also 
contains information on current accounts and international capital flows. Coverage 
is of most of the world’s nations, and the most recent Yearbook usually contains a 
decade of data for each country. IMF publications are one of the sources used by 
many international agencies and private enterprises. Nearly all university libraries 
and many city libraries will have the hardcopy version of the IFS.
Balance of Payments Statistics
Balance of Payments Statistics (BOPS) is a sister publication of the IMF that 
complements the data in the IFS. The BOPS has the most up-to-date and detailed 
current account statistics of any international data source. In addition, it contains 
detailed breakdowns of capital flows.

A Note on Numbers
The United States uses a numbering system that refers to a thousand million 
(1,000,000,000) as one billion, and a million million (1,000,000,000,000) as one 
trillion. Most of the rest of the world has a slightly different terminology. In many 
countries, the term billion is reserved for the value that is called a trillion in the 
United States, and what the United States calls a billion is called a thousand 
million or a milliard. For example, the number 15,000,000,000 would be fifteen 
billion in the United States, and 15 thousand millions or 15 milliards elsewhere. 
The numbers in this chapter use the conventional usage of the United States.

INTRODUCTION: FIXED, FLEXIBLE, OR IN-BETWEEN?
Every country must choose an exchange rate system to determine how prices in the 
home country currency are converted into prices in another country’s currency. Some 
countries peg their exchange rate to a fixed level while others let market forces deter-
mine its value. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. The choice of 
an exchange rate system varies along the continuum from completely fixed with no 
variation to completely flexible with variation determined by supply and demand for 
the country’s currency on a minute-by-minute basis. Between these two extremes are 
several other exchange rate systems with semi-fixed or semi-flexible rates.
Each exchange rate system requires that governments and central banks have cred-
ible policies to support the selected system as trade, capital flows, and other pressures 
from the world economy push exchange rates up and down. In this chapter we define 
the actors in currency markets, analyze the basic mechanisms that determine the value 
of a country’s currency, and discuss the considerations that countries should make in 
selecting their exchange rate system. Each of these elements is an important determi-
nant of a country’s exchange rate system and the value of its currency.

EXCHANGE RATES AND CURRENCY TRADING
LO 10.1	 List the reasons for holding foreign exchange and the main institutions  
in the foreign exchange market.
The exchange rate is the price of one currency stated in terms of a second ­currency. 
An exchange rate can be given in one of two ways, either as units of domestic 
­currency per unit of foreign currency or vice versa. For example, we might give the 
U.S.–Mexico exchange rate as dollars per peso (0.057 dollars) or pesos per dollar 
(17.5 pesos). The custom varies with the currency. For example, the U.S. dollar–
British pound exchange rate is usually quoted in terms of dollars per pound, but 
the U.S. dollar–Mexican peso exchange rate is usually pesos per dollar. In this 
chapter and the rest of the book, the exchange rate is always given as the number 
of units of domestic currency per unit of foreign currency. For the United States, 
this means it is dollars per peso and dollars per pound.
Exchange rates are reported in every newspaper with a business section and 
on numerous Web sites. Figure 10.1 shows several years of U.S. dollar values for 
three of the most frequently traded currencies: the European Union’s euro, the 
Japanese yen, and the British pound. The rates are taken from the U.S. ­Federal 
Reserve Bank’s Web site, and are the interbank rates that one bank charges 
another when buying large amounts of currency. Tourists and individuals pur-
chasing relatively small amounts would have paid more.
All three are flexible exchange rates and subject to constant fluctuations 
up and down in value, as shown in Figure 10.1. In the years leading up to the 
financial crisis and recession of 2007–2009, the pound and the euro appreciated 
against the dollar. When the crisis began in late 2007, world demand for dollars 
rose and it appreciated in value, or to say the same thing another way, the pound 
and euro depreciated. The most dramatic depreciation began in the middle of 
2008 and lasted for approximately a year, until mid-2009, reflecting the flight of 
capital into dollars. The pound lost approximately 25 percent of its value in dol-
lar terms and the euro lost approximately 15 percent. In contrast, the Japanese 
yen continued to appreciate until late 2012, gaining over 40 percent in value 
against the dollar, and then quickly reversed and lost all of its appreciated value 
by the middle of 2013. Considering that the changes in the real economies of 
each country were not nearly as large, Figure 10.1 gives an idea of the variability 
of exchange rates.
By March, 2016, which is the end of the series in Figure 10.1, the yen was worth 
$0.0088, or less than 1 cent. The euro stood at $1.10 and the pound was worth $1.42. 
It might be tempting to conclude that the yen is weak and the pound and euro are 
strong given that the yen is not worth 1 cent and other two are well over 1 dollar. 
This would be a mistake, however, because currencies are scales, just like Fahren-
heit and centigrade, or miles and kilometers. No matter how many of one it takes 
to equal another, we cannot conclude that the scale implies strength or weakness. 
Until it began to lose some of its value in 2013, the yen appreciated against all 
three and was clearly the strongest currency. Generally speaking, the strength or 

240
Part 3    International Finance
weakness of a currency is related to the direction of change in its value and not its 
value at one point in time or the number of units it takes to buy a different currency.
Reasons for Holding Foreign Currencies
Economists identify three reasons for holding foreign currency. The first is for 
trade and investment purposes. Traders (importers and exporters) and investors 
routinely transact in foreign currencies, either receiving or making payments in 
another country’s money. Tourists are included in this category because they hold 
foreign exchange in order to buy foreign goods and services.
The second reason for holding foreign exchange is to take advantage of interest 
rate differentials, or interest rate arbitrage. Arbitrage conveys the idea of buying 
something where it is relatively cheap and selling it where it is relatively expen-
sive. Interest rate arbitrage is similar in that arbitrageurs borrow money where 
interest rates are relatively low and lend it where rates are relatively high. By 
moving financial capital in this way, interest rate arbitrage keeps interest rates 
from diverging too far, and also constitutes one of the primary linkages between 
national economies. Over the last several years interest arbitrageurs have played 
a major role in keeping the Japanese yen strong by borrowing in Japan where 
interest rates are very low and lending where they are high. Various other factors, 
such as perceptions of risk, are important, but in general, interest rate arbitrage 
is a powerful force in the world economy and tends to be one of the main reasons 
for holding foreign currency.

241
The third reason for holding foreign exchange is to speculate. Speculators are 
businesses that buy or sell a currency because they expect its price to rise or fall. 
They have no need for foreign exchange to buy goods or services or financial 
assets; rather, they hope to realize profits or avoid losses through correctly antici-
pating changes in a currency’s market value. Speculators are often reviled in the 
popular press, but in fact they help to bring currencies into equilibrium after they 
have become over- or undervalued. If speculators view a currency as overvalued, 
they will sell it and drive down its value. If they guess wrong, however, they can 
lose a lot of money. For this reason, some economists have argued that speculation 
either serves the useful function of bringing currency values into proper alignment, 
or its practitioners lose money and go out of business. Not everyone agrees with 
this view, however, and some economists think that speculation against a currency 
can be destabilizing in the sense that it does not always push an exchange rate to its 
equilibrium value, but instead sometimes leads to a grossly over- or undervalued 
currency, which is a major problem for the country involved.
Institutions
There are four main participants in foreign currency markets: retail customers, 
commercial banks, foreign exchange brokers, and central banks. Of these four, 
commercial banks are the most important. Retail customers include firms and indi-
viduals that hold foreign exchange for any of the three reasons given in the previ-
ous section—to engage in purchases, to adjust their portfolios, or to profit from 
expected future currency movements. In most cases, they buy and sell through a 
commercial bank. Commercial banks in many parts of the world hold inventories of 
foreign currencies as part of the services offered to customers. Not all banks provide 
this service, but those that do usually have a relationship with several foreign banks 
where they hold their balances of foreign currencies. When a surplus accumulates, 
or a shortage develops, the banks trade with each other to adjust their holdings.
In the United States, foreign exchange brokers also play an important role. It 
is not very common for U.S. banks to trade currency with foreign banks. Instead, 
U.S. banks tend to go through foreign exchange brokers, who act as middlemen 
between buyers and sellers that do not usually hold foreign exchange. Brokers 
can also serve as agents for central banks. The market, then, works as follows. An 
individual or firm that needs foreign exchange calls its bank. The bank quotes a 
price at which it will sell the currency. The price is based on one of two possible 
sources of supply: The bank may have an account with another bank in the country 
where the currency is used, or it may call a foreign exchange broker. The broker 
keeps track of buyers and sellers of currencies and acts as a deal maker by bringing 
together a seller and a bank that is buying for its customer.
In most cases, currency trades take the form of credits and debits to a firm’s 
bank accounts. For example, a local U.S. importer that must make payment in 
yen can call and tell its bank to transfer yen to the Japanese bank of the firm that 
supplies the importer with goods. The importer will have a debit to its local bank 
account that is equivalent to the cost of the yen. If the U.S. bank has a branch 
or correspondence bank in Japan, it can electronically notify the branch to debit 

242
Part 3    International Finance
the yen from the account of the U.S. bank and credit it to the Japanese bank of 
the supplier. If the U.S. bank goes through a currency trader instead of dealing 
directly with a Japanese bank, it first buys yen that are in an account with a Japa-
nese bank. Next, it requests that some or all of its yen assets be transferred to the 
bank of the Japanese supplier of the U.S. importer.
Exchange Rate Risk
Firms that do business in more than one country are subject to exchange rate risks. 
These risks stem from the fact that currencies are constantly changing in value 
and, as a result, expected future payments that will be made or received in a 
foreign currency will be a different domestic currency amount from when the 
contract was signed.
Suppose, for example, that a U.S. semiconductor manufacturer signs a contract 
to send a British computer manufacturer a shipment of microprocessors in six 
months. If the U.S. manufacturer agrees on a price in British pounds, it must know 
the value of the pound six months from now in order to know the dollar equivalent 
of its future revenue. If the U.S. manufacturer specifies that the microprocessors 
be paid for in dollars, then it shifts the exchange rate risk to the British firm. The 
U.S. company knows the exact dollar amount it will receive in six months, but the 
British firm is uncertain of the price of the dollar and therefore the pound price 
of microprocessors.
Financial markets recognized this problem long ago and, in the nineteenth 
century, they created mechanisms for dealing with it. The mechanisms are the 
forward exchange rate and the forward market. The forward exchange rate is the 
price of a currency that will be delivered in the future; the forward market refers to 
the market in which the buying and selling of currencies for future delivery takes 
place. Forward markets for currencies are an everyday tool for international trad-
ers, investors, and speculators because they are a way to eliminate the exchange 
rate risk associated with future payments and receipts. Forward foreign exchange 
markets allow an exporter or importer to sign a currency contract on the day they 
sign an agreement to ship or receive goods. The currency contract guarantees a 
set price for the foreign currency, usually 30, 90, or 180 days into the future. By 
contrast, the market for buying and selling in the present is called a spot market. 
The prices of foreign currencies quoted in Figure 10.1 are “spot prices.”
Suppose the U.S. semiconductor manufacturer signs a contract to deliver the 
microprocessors to the British firm in six months. Suppose also that the price is 
stated in British pounds. The manufacturer knows precisely how many pounds it 
will earn six months from now, but it does not know whether the pound will rise or 
fall in value, so it does not know what it will earn in dollar terms. The solution is 
to sign a forward contract to sell British pounds six months from now in exchange 
for U.S. dollars at a price agreed upon today. Using the forward market, the U.S. 
manufacturer avoids the risk that comes from exchange rate fluctuations.
Forward markets are important to financial investors and speculators as well 
as exporters and importers. For example, bondholders and other interest rate 

Chapter 10    Exchange Rates and Exchange Rate Systems 
243
arbitrageurs often use forward markets to protect themselves against the foreign 
exchange risk incurred while holding foreign bonds and other financial assets. 
This is called hedging and it is accomplished by buying a forward contract to sell 
foreign currency at the same time that the bond or other interest-earning asset 
matures. When interest rate arbitrageurs use the forward market to insure against 
exchange rate risk, it is called covered interest arbitrage.
THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE
LO 10.2	 Diagram the effects on the home currency of a change in supply 
or demand for foreign currency.
LO 10.3	 Differentiate short-run, medium-run, and long-run forces that help 
determine the value of a currency.
LO 10.4	 Calculate a currency’s forward premium or discount based on interest 
rate differentials.
The value of one nation’s money, like most things, can be analyzed by looking at 
its supply and demand. Under a system of flexible, or floating, exchange rates, an 
increase in the demand for the dollar will raise its price (cause an appreciation in 
its value), while an increase in its supply will lower its price (cause a ­depreciation). 
Under a fixed exchange rate system, the value of the dollar is held constant 
through the actions of the central bank that counteract the market forces of sup-
ply and demand. Consequently, supply and demand analysis is a useful tool for 
understanding the pressures on a currency regardless of the type of exchange rate 
system adopted. For this reason, we begin with the assumption that exchange rates 
are completely flexible. After examining the usefulness of supply and demand 
analysis, we will turn to alternative systems, including gold standards and other 
variations on fixed exchange rates.
Supply and Demand with Flexible Exchange Rates
Figure 10.2 shows the supply and demand for British pounds in the United States. 
The demand curve is a normal, downward sloping curve, indicating that as the pound 
depreciates relative to the dollar, the quantity of pounds demanded by Americans 
increases. Note also that we are measuring the price of the pound—the exchange 
rate—on the vertical axis. Because it is dollars per pound ($£), it is the price of a 
pound in terms of dollars, and an increase in the exchange rate (R) is a decline in 
the value of the dollar. Movements up the vertical axis represent an increase in the 
price of the pound, which is equivalent to a fall in the price of the dollar. Similarly, 
movements down the vertical axis represent a decrease in the price of the pound.
British goods are less expensive for Americans when the pound is cheaper and 
the dollar is stronger. Hence, at depreciated values for the pound, Americans 

244
Part 3    International Finance
will switch from U.S. or third-party suppliers of goods and services to British 
suppliers. However, before they can purchase goods made in Britain, first they 
must exchange dollars for British pounds. Consequently, the increased demand 
for British goods is simultaneously an increase in the quantity of British pounds 
demanded.
The supply curve in Figure 10.2 slopes up because British firms and consumers 
are willing to buy a greater quantity of American goods as the dollar becomes 
cheaper. That is, they receive more dollars per pound. However, before British 
customers can buy American goods, first they must convert pounds into dollars, 
so the increase in the quantity of American goods demanded is simultaneously 
an increase in the quantity of foreign currency supplied to the United States. 
The intersection of supply and demand determines the market exchange rate and 
the quantity of pounds supplied to the United States. At exchange rate R1, the 
demand and supply of British pounds to the United States is Q1.
Exchange Rates in the Long Run
We have determined that the supply curve slopes up to the right and the demand 
curve slopes down. The next step in supply and demand analysis is to consider 
the factors that determine the intersection of supply and demand and the actual 
exchange rate. We will continue to assume that the exchange rate is completely 
flexible. Later in the chapter we look at exchange rates that are fixed, and at 
intermediate rates between fixed and flexible.
In Figure 10.3, an increase in the U.S. demand for the pound (rightward shift 
of the demand curve) causes a rise in the exchange rate, an appreciation in the 
pound, and a depreciation in the dollar. Conversely, a fall in demand would shift 
the demand curve left and lead to a falling pound and a rising dollar. On the 
­supply side, an increase in the supply of pounds to the U.S. market (supply curve

shifts right) is illustrated in Figure 10.4, where a new intersection for supply and 
demand occurs at a lower exchange rate and an appreciated dollar. A decrease in 
the supply of pounds shifts the curve leftward, causing the exchange rate to rise 
and the dollar to depreciate.
The causal factors behind the shifts in the supply and demand are easier to 
conceptualize if we divide the determinants of exchange rates into three periods: 
long run, medium run, and short run. This seems to be accurate empirically, as 
not all the factors that determine an exchange rate show up instantaneously. In 
fact, some causal factors take a very long time—a decade or more—to exert their 
full influence, and in the meantime, a number of short-run or medium-run factors 
may push in a completely opposite direction.
Looking at the long run first, purchasing power parity states that the equi-
librium value of an exchange rate is at the level that allows a given amount of 
money to buy the same quantity of goods abroad that it will buy at home. By this 
criterion, the equilibrium exchange rate is the point where the dollar buys pounds 
at a rate that keeps its purchasing power over goods and services constant. That 
is, in equilibrium $100 is equivalent to the number of pounds needed to buy the 
same basket of goods and services in Britain that $100 buys in the United States. 
Table 10.1 illustrates this idea.
In Table 10.1, a hypothetical basket of goods costs $1,000 or £500, depending 
on the country where it is purchased. Accordingly, the long-run tendency is for the 
exchange rate to move to $2 per pound. If it is above that, the pound is overvalued 
and the dollar is undervalued. An overvalued pound buys more in the United 
States than in Britain since it would be possible to convert £500 to more than 
$1,000 and buy a larger basket of goods than can be bought in Britain. Exchange 
rates less than $2 would imply the opposite—the pound is undervalued and the 
dollar overvalued.

246
Part 3    International Finance
It should be stressed that this is an underlying tendency and not a description 
of actual exchange rates at any point in time. Over the long run, purchasing power 
parity exerts influence over exchange rates, but in the short to medium run, there 
are significant deviations from this pattern. If you have traveled outside your 
home country, you are probably aware of cases where your domestic currency 
buys you so much foreign currency that your standard of living is higher when you 
travel. You might be able to stay in a better class of hotel, eat in better restaurants, 
and shop for items that you cannot afford at home; or you may be familiar with 
the opposite scenario, where your standard of living declines because you get so 
little foreign currency in exchange for your domestic currency that everything 
seems inordinately expensive.
Purchasing power parity influences currency values indirectly. When a currency 
is overvalued or undervalued, it creates profit-making opportunities for merchants 
that can move goods across international borders. Suppose, for example, that the 
dollar is overvalued and that instead of $2 per pound, the exchange rate is $1.75 
per pound. Prices are assumed to be the same as those shown in Table 10.1. In this 
case, $1,000 buys £571.43 ($1,000/$1.75 per pound). If merchants take the £571.43

Purchasing power parity states that dollars will tend to exchange for pounds at a rate that 
maintains a constant purchasing power of a given quantity of currency.

and buy British goods and then ship the goods to the United States, they can earn 
more than $1,000. (They earn $1,142.86 since goods prices are 2 to 1.) In the long 
run, the demand for British pounds increases and, as shown in Figure 10.3, the 
exchange rate rises. The process will continue until the exchange rate hits $2 per 
pound and there are no more profit-making opportunities from shipping goods 
from Britain to the United States.
The process just described is reinforced by the flow of goods from Britain to 
the United States. The supply of goods shrinks in Britain, leading to rising prices 
there. In the United States, supply rises and, under normal competitive conditions, 
prices will fall. These effects will take a while to exert themselves, but they are 
another factor reinforcing purchasing power parity. In this case, however, prices 
are moving in the direction that equalizes the purchasing power of the two curren-
cies instead of equalization through exchange rate movement as in the previous 
example. In theory, it does not matter which changes—prices or exchange rates—
but given that prices in many countries tend not to fall easily, while exchange rates 
are relatively easily moved, most of the equalization probably occurs through 
exchange rate movements.
The story of goods arbitrage—buying where the goods are cheaper and selling 
where they are more expensive—which stands behind purchasing power parity, 
obviously has a few unrealistic assumptions. In particular, it requires that goods 
flow costlessly across international borders and that all goods and services can 
be traded. In reality, there are transportation costs involved with moving goods 
and some goods and services are not traded. This means that our merchant who 
buys £571.43 of goods in Britain and sells them for $1,142.86 in the United States 
loses some of his or her $142.86 profit to shipping, insurance, and other transac-
tion costs. In addition, he or she pays a fee to a bank or a currency broker when 
buying the needed pounds. And finally, some of the goods and services bought 
and sold—haircuts for example—are never traded and arbitrage is not possible.
Finally, it is also the case that few nations have eliminated all their barriers to 
the entry of foreign goods and services. The merchant may face a tariff, import 
license fees, inspection fees, or some other barrier at the border that adds to his 
or her cost. In the limit, imports of the goods in question may be prohibited and 
goods arbitrage may be impossible at any price differential. In addition, some 
goods and many services are not traded. For example, restaurant meals, haircuts, 
landscape maintenance, and a host of other services that must be consumed on 
the spot are rarely, if ever, traded.
Once the assumptions of purchasing power parity are examined, it is not surpris-
ing that it exerts its influence over exchange rates only in the long run. If there are 
significant profit-making opportunities through goods arbitrage, then in spite of 
today’s obstacles, entrepreneurs will work to create the conditions that will allow 
them to take advantage of the price differentials across markets. They will look 
for ways to lower transport costs, to minimize the costs of compliance with import 
rules and regulations, and to change the rules where it is feasible. All of these 
steps take time, but in spite of the real obstacles to its operation, purchasing power 
parity remains a significant long-run force in the determination of exchange rates.

248
Part 3    International Finance
Exchange Rates in the Medium Run and Short Run
While purchasing power parity is working slowly in the background, other forces 
have more immediate impacts on the position of the supply and demand curves 
for foreign exchange. We turn first to the forces that are correlated with the busi-
ness cycle, the natural but irregular rhythms of expansion and recession that every 
country undergoes. Given that the time period from the peak of one expansion to 
the next is usually several years in duration, the forces that are tied to the business 
cycle can be considered medium run. That is, they are pressures on an exchange 
rate that may last for several years, but almost always less than a decade and usu-
ally less than five to seven years.
The most important medium-run force is the strength of a country’s economic 
growth. Rapid growth implies rising incomes and increased consumption. When 
consumers feel secure in their jobs and at the same time experience a rapid 
growth in their incomes, they spend more, some of which will be on imports 
and travel abroad. As a result, rapid economic growth at home is translated into 
increased imports and an outward shift in the demand for foreign currency, as 
shown in Figure 10.3. Holding constant a host of short-run forces that may be in 
play at the same time, the effect of rapid economic growth at home is a depreci-
ating currency.
The effect of growth is symmetrical, both with respect to slower growth at home, 
and with respect to the rate of economic growth abroad. Slower growth, such 
as a recession during which output declines (negative economic growth), raises 
consumer uncertainty about jobs and reduces many people’s incomes. For the 
economy as a whole, as consumption expenditures fall, expenditures on imports 
decline as well, and the demand for foreign exchange falls. A leftward shift of the 
demand curve reduces the exchange rate and appreciates the currency. In other 
words, just as more rapid economic growth can cause a depreciation in a country’s 
currency, slower growth sets forces in motion that lead to an appreciation.
Growth abroad does not have a direct effect on the home country’s demand 
for foreign exchange (although it may have an indirect effect through its stimula-
tion of the home economy), but it will directly affect the supply curve. More rapid 
foreign growth leads to more exports from the home country, and slower foreign 
growth results in fewer exports. More exports to foreigners increase the supply 
of foreign currency and shift the supply curve rightward, as shown in Figure 10.4. 
Fewer exports have the opposite effect. You should practice drawing the effects 
of changes in the rates of home and foreign economic growth on the supply and 
demand curves for foreign exchange.
Turning from the medium run of the business cycle to short-run periods of a 
year or less, a number of forces are constantly at work shaping currency values. 
The foremost short-run force is the flow of financial capital. The effects of financial 
flows range from minor and subtle to dramatic and, at times, catastrophic. They 
are as capable of creating slight day-to-day variations in the value of a ­currency 
as they are of creating complete financial chaos and bringing down governments. 
The degree of volatility in financial flows varies greatly and is highly responsive 

Chapter 10    Exchange Rates and Exchange Rate Systems 
249
to governmental policies and conditions in the world economy. The impact on 
exchange rates of large-scale, short-run movements in financial capital has become 
one of the most serious issues in international economics.
Two variables in particular are responsible for a large share of short-run 
­capital flows: interest rates and expectations about future exchange rates. These 
two forces often influence each other and are capable of creating unpredictable 
interactions, as when a change in interest rates reshapes investor confidence or 
catalyzes speculative actions in currency markets.
The role of interest rates in the short-run determination of exchange rates is 
crucial. The interest rate–exchange rate relationship is summed up in the interest 
parity condition, which states that the difference between any pair of countries’ 
interest rates is approximately equal to the expected change in the exchange rate:
i - i* ≈(F - R)/R,
where home and foreign interest rates are given by i and i*, and F and R are the 
expected future current exchange rates, respectively. The appendix at the end of 
this chapter develops the algebra of this relationship, but the intuition is not dif-
ficult to grasp. Suppose an investor has a choice between investing at home and 
earning interest rate/ i, or investing abroad and earning interest rate i*. If foreign 
interest rates are higher than domestic ones, it may seem advantageous to invest 
abroad, but this is not necessarily the case. The best choice is also determined 
by exchange rate movements during the investment period. If investors want to 
convert their future earnings back into their home currency, then exchange rate 
movements must be taken into account during the investment period. To protect 
against unanticipated losses due to currency fluctuations, cross border investors 
can sign a forward contract to sell the foreign exchange from their future earnings. 
This is known as covered interest arbitrage and is a common way to take advan-
tage of interest differentials while guarding against the risk of exchange rate losses.
A simple example will help clarify. Suppose a U.S.-based investor has a choice 
between one-year bonds issued by U.S. and German banks. For the sake of sim-
plicity, assume that the bonds are similar with respect to risk, transaction costs, 
and other characteristics. The U.S. investment is denominated in dollars and pays  
3 percent (i) while the German investment is in euros and pays 2 percent (i*). In one 
year, $1,000 invested in the United States will pay $1,000 * 1.03, or $1,030, while 
the return on the German bond depends on the fixed interest rate and the exchange 
rate a year from now. If the dollar-euro spot rate is 1.2 today, then the investor can 
use the $1,000 to buy €833.33 (1,000/1.2) and invest it at 2 percent in Germany. In 
one year, the investor will have :833.33 * 1.02, or €850. If the exchange rate is 1.3 
a year from now, then the $1,000 converted to euros and invested in Germany at 
2 percent will be worth :850 * $1.3 per euro, or $1,105. That is, a dollar invested 
today in a German bond at 2 percent will earn the investor F/R * 1.02 in one year, 
where F is the future exchange rate and R is today’s spot rate of exchange.
The problem for the investor is that he or she cannot know what the exchange 
rate will be one year from now. Our example fudged this point by assuming that 
the rate was 1.3 dollars per euro in one year’s time, but in fact we cannot know 

250
Part 3    International Finance
what the spot exchange rate will be in a year. Given this uncertainty, investors turn 
to the forward market where they can sign a contract guaranteeing them a fixed 
amount of dollars for the euros they will have in one year when the bond matures.
The difference between the spot rate of exchange, R, and the forward rate, F, 
is the expected appreciation or depreciation. If F 7 R, then the dollar is expected 
to depreciate, and is said to be selling at a discount. If F 6 R, then the dollar is 
expected to appreciate and is selling at a premium. Given information about F and 
R, our investor is prepared to select between the dollar and euro bonds.
In our previous example, R is 1.2 and F is 1.3, implying that the dollar is at a 
discount in the forward market and people expect it to depreciate over the next 
year. The choices are as follows. An investor with $1,000 can earn $1,000 * 1.03, 
or $1,030 in the United States, or she can earn (1.3/1.2) * 1.02 * $1,000, or $1,105 
in Germany. Clearly the German investment is better and will attract capital. 
Money flowing into German bonds will push down German interest rates (i* falls) 
and increase the spot price of the euro (R rises). Both changes reduce earnings on 
the German bond until, in the end, we reach the interest parity condition
i - i* ≈(F - R)/R
where interest rate differences are approximately equal to the expected change 
in the exchange rate.
The utility of the interest parity condition is that it brings together capital flows, 
domestic interest rate policy, and exchange rate expectations. Suppose, for exam-
ple, that domestic interest rates are above foreign rates, so that i 7 i*. In that case, 
investors expect a discount in the forward market, so that F 7 R. If the expected 
depreciation in the domestic currency is not sufficient to compensate for higher 
interest rates at home, then capital flows into the home country and increases 
demand for domestic currency, pushing down domestic interest rates until the 
difference between i and i* is approximately equal to the percentage difference 
between the forward and spot exchange rates.
Consider another example. Suppose that home interest rates are less than foreign 
rates (i 6 i*) and that forward rates are less than spot rates (F 6 R) by an appro-
priate amount so that the interest parity condition holds. Beginning at this point, 
home policymakers decide for some reason to raise their interest rates to the same 
level as foreign rates: i = i*. Now, investors in both home and foreign markets will 
invest more in the home country because they earn the same rate of interest, and 
they expect domestic currency to appreciate in value (since F 6 R). Figure 10.5 
illustrates these shifts. Note that both the demand curve for foreign currency and 
the supply curve of foreign currency shift, with demand moving in and supply mov-
ing out. Taken together, both shifts reinforce a downward movement in the spot 
rate. As R falls, domestic currency appreciates and the gap between F and R closes. 
If i = i*, the process ends when F = R.
In addition to their impact on the forward-spot rate differential, expectations 
play a crucial role in the determination of exchange rates in another way. A sud-
den change in the expected future value of an exchange rate can have a dramatic 
and often self-fulfilling impact on a country’s currency. For example, if investors 

Chapter 10    Exchange Rates and Exchange Rate Systems 
251
suddenly come to believe that a currency must depreciate more than they had 
anticipated, it lowers the expected value of assets denominated in that currency. 
This can create a sudden exodus of financial capital and put enormous pressure 
on the country’s supply of foreign exchange reserves. To a significant extent, epi-
sodes of capital flight can be self-fulfilling in their expectations about an exchange 
rate. If investors expect depreciation, they try to convert their assets to another 
currency. This raises the demand for foreign exchange and depresses the supply, 
fulfilling the expectation of a depreciation.
There are numerous potential causes of this type of volatility in financial capi-
tal flows and exchange rate shifts. It also seems likely that technological changes 
in telecommunications have altered the sensitivity of markets toward changes in 
expectations, although this is yet to be established definitively. Nevertheless, it is 
certain that a frequent cause of sudden shifts in expectations is the realization that 
a particular government is practicing economic policies that are internally incon-
sistent and unsustainable. We will examine this in more detail in Chapters 11 and 
12, but it is relatively easy to get a sense of the meaning of inconsistent policies. 
An example is policies that are designed to stimulate the economy strongly (more 
growth S more imports S more demand for foreign exchange) when the supply of 
foreign exchange is severely limited (not enough exports, very low interest rates).
The mechanisms from inconsistent policy to exchange rate crisis and collapse 
are fairly well understood, but this begs the question about the cause of a sudden 
shift in expectations. Many recent episodes of sudden exchange rate shifts have 
occurred when investors lost confidence in a particular currency. Yet why the 
sudden change in investor confidence? Government policies are often in place 
for years before they become unsustainable. Quite frequently, an external shock 
such as a sudden shift in the price of a key input such as oil, or a sudden change in 
policy by an important trade partner, are the tipping point.

The Largest Market in the World
In 2013, the world’s foreign exchange markets traded an estimated $5,345 
­billion worth of currency per day. Another way to look at this is that every  
3.1 days, currency trades equaled the value of U.S. annual gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP). These estimates come from a survey of fifty-three central banks 
conducted every three years by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), 
a “central bank for central banks.” The BIS survey is the Triennial Central 
Bank Survey, conducted in April 2013 and available from the BIS at http://
www.bis.org.
Between 1992 and 2013, the volume of exchange rate transactions grew from 
$880 billion per day to $5,345 billion. In 2013, the top four currencies traded 
around the world were the U.S. dollar (87 percent of all trades), the EU euro 
(33.4 percent), the Japanese yen (23 percent), and the British pound (11.8 per-
cent). (See Table 10.2.) Not surprisingly, the U.S. dollar/euro exchange was the 
most common, with 24.1 percent of all transactions, followed by the U.S. dollar/
yen (18.3 percent), and the U.S. dollar/U.K. pound (8.8 percent).
Note that the total in Table 10.2 is 200 percent rather than 100 percent 
because every sale is simultaneously a purchase. The dollar is so often traded 
because it is used as an international medium of exchange and because of 
the cross-trading that occurs between pairs of currencies. That is, a Chilean 
importer may pay his or her Mexican supplier in U.S. dollars, or he or she may 
use Chilean pesos to buy dollars and use the dollars to buy Mexican pesos. It

is unlikely that the Mexican exporter would accept Chilean pesos, so one way 
or another the importer has to come up with dollars.
Currency trading is concentrated in just a few financial centers. London is 
by far the largest center of foreign exchange trading, as is illustrated by the 
BIS survey’s finding that more U.S. dollars are traded in London than in New 
York (see Table 10.3). Given the preponderance of the U.S. dollar in currency 
trades and the importance of London as a trading center, it follows that most 
of the trades in London do not involve the British pound.

THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE
LO 10.5	 Explain in words and with an equation the relationship between price 
changes and the real exchange rates.
The concept of the exchange rate that has been used so far and that is exemplified 
by the values shown in Table 10.2 does not really tell us what a foreign currency is 
worth. Exchange rates tell us how many units of domestic currency we give up for 
one unit of foreign currency, but unless we know what foreign prices are, we still 
do not know the purchasing power of our domestic money when it is converted to 
a foreign currency. As an illustration of this problem, suppose that the U.S. dollar–
Malaysian ringgit exchange rate is $0.25 and that it stays constant over the year. 
However, suppose also that Malaysian inflation is 4 percent while U.S. inflation is 
1 percent. After one year, the four ringgits that cost one dollar will buy 3 percent 
less in Malaysia than the dollar buys in the United States. The relatively higher 
inflation in Malaysia erodes the value of a dollar’s worth of ringgits more rapidly 
than the dollar loses value at home. Consequently, when converted to ringgits, 
the real purchasing power of the dollar has declined even though the exchange 
rate is still $0.25 per ringgit.
From the point of view of tourists and business people who use foreign 
exchange, the key item of interest is the purchasing power they get when they 
convert their dollars, not the number of units of a foreign currency. An American 
importer trying to decide between Malaysian and Chinese textiles does not really 
care if he or she gets four ringgits per dollar or eight Chinese yuan per dollar. The 
biggest concern is the volume of textiles that can be purchased in Malaysia with 
four ringgits and in China with eight yuan.
The real exchange rate is the market exchange rate (or nominal exchange rate) 
adjusted for price differences. The two are closely connected. By way of illustra-
tion, let’s consider the case of a wine merchant who is trying to decide whether 
to stock his or her shop with American or French wine. Let’s say that French 
wine of a given quality costs €200 and American wine of the same quality costs 
$180. Suppose that the nominal rate is $1.20 per euro so that $180 is equivalent to 
€150 in the currency market. In this case, French wine costs one-third more than 
American wine, and the real exchange rate is 1.33 cases of American wine per case 
of French wine. The algebra is straightforward:
 Real exchange rate
 = [(Nominal exchange rate) * (Foreign price)]/(Domestic price)
 = [($1.20 per euro) * (:200 per case)]/($180 per case)
 = ($240 per case of French wine)/($180 per case of American wine)
 = 113 cases of American wine per one case of French wine
Because the real purchasing power of the dollar is much less in France than in 
the United States, the choice facing the wine merchant is obvious.
In this example, the main lesson is clear. What matters most to exporters 
and importers is not the nominal exchange rate, but the real exchange rate—in 

Chapter 10    Exchange Rates and Exchange Rate Systems 
255
other words, how much purchasing power they have in the countries under com-
parison. Let Rr symbolize the real exchange rate, Rn the nominal rate. Since we 
are interested in the whole economy rather than just one market such as the 
market for wine, we will use a price index to measure overall prices in the two 
countries. Price indexes are equivalent to the average price of a basket of goods 
and services in each economy. Let P stand for the home country price index, and 
P* represent foreign prices. Then, following the algebra of the wine merchant’s 
calculation:
Real exchange rate
= Nominal exchange rate * (Foreign prices)/(Domestic prices),
or, more compactly,
Rr = Rn (P*/P).
Suppose, for example, that the U.S. dollar–EU euro nominal exchange rate is 
$1.20 per euro and that both price levels are initially set at 100. In this case, the cost 
of a basket of goods and services is the same in real terms in both countries and
Rr = Rn (P*/P) = Rn (100/100) = Rn.
The real rate equals the nominal rate when the purchasing power is the same in 
both countries. Note that purchasing power parity indicates that this is the long-
run equilibrium. Over time, however, if inflation is higher at home than in the 
foreign country, P rises more than P*, and Rr falls, meaning the domestic currency 
appreciates in real terms.
By way of illustration, suppose that the United States has 10 percent inflation 
while the EU has 0 percent. Then, the real U.S.-EU exchange rate (in terms of 
dollars per euro) would be as follows:
Rr = ($1.20 per euro) * (100/110) = $1.0909 per euro.
Tourists, investors, and businesspeople can still trade dollars and euros at the 
nominal rate of $1.20 per euro (plus whatever commissions they pay to the seller), 
but the real purchasing power of the U.S. dollar has risen in the EU compared to 
what it buys at home. The real exchange rate of $1.0909 per euro tells us that EU 
goods are now 9 percent cheaper than the U.S. goods that have risen in price. As 
a result, unless the nominal rate changes, the dollar goes further in the EU than 
at home. In real terms, the euro has depreciated and the dollar has appreciated.
Changes in the value of real exchange rates play an important role in inter-
national macroeconomic relations. When countries control the value of their 
nominal exchange rate, for example, they must be certain that their prices do not 
change in relation to the prices of their trading partners. If inflation runs higher 
at home, then the real value of their currency appreciates. Over a period of time, 
if uncorrected, this can lead to a build-up in the current account deficit as imports 
increase and exports decrease. In a number of cases, the end result has been cur-
rency crises and the collapse of nominal exchange rates. (For example, Mexico in 
December 1994 and Thailand in July 1997.)

ALTERNATIVES TO FLEXIBLE EXCHANGE RATES
Fixed exchange rate systems are also called pegged exchange rate systems. In 
these types of systems, there are several possibilities for setting the value of the 
country’s currency. At one extreme, a few (mostly very small) countries give up 
their currency altogether and adopt the currency of another country, usually the 
dollar or the euro. More commonly, the value of a nation’s money is set equal 
to a fixed amount of another country’s currency, or less commonly to a basket 
of several currencies. If the exchange rate is not allowed to vary, then it is called 
a hard peg. Fixed exchange rates that fluctuate within a set band are soft pegs 
and these, in turn, can take several forms depending on the amount of variation 
allowed. Table 10.5 shows that in 2014, there were 25 countries with hard pegs 
and 101 with soft pegs in which the currency is fixed, but allowed to vary within 
set limits. Table 10.5 also shows that 65 countries have floating exchange rates. Of 
these, 36 intervene in currency markets when their currencies rise or fall too much 
in value, while 29 countries let their currencies float independently and usually 
without intervention.
Through the first seventy years of the twentieth century, fixed exchange rates 
were the norm, often within a framework that defined the value of a country’s cur-
rency in terms of a fixed amount of gold. After World War II, many nations shifted 
away from gold and pegged the value of their currencies to the U.S. dollar or to the 
currency of another country with which they had strong historical ties. Beginning 
in the 1970s, the use of flexible exchange rate systems began to increase, first in 
the high-income industrial economies, and then in many developing countries in 
the 1980s and 1990s. By the end of the twentieth century, flexible exchange rate 
systems were common.
There is no best exchange rate system. Individual country conditions are unique 
and no single type of exchange rate system can be appropriate for every country. 
While the number of countries using flexible exchange rate systems grew rapidly 
after the early 1970s, it began to decline after 2001. Currently, less than half of the 
world’s nations have flexible rates.

Fixed Exchange Rate Systems
Gold standards are one type of fixed exchange rate. The gold standard was aban-
doned nearly everywhere in the 1930s during the Great Depression, then was 
restored in a modified form after World War II, but has completely disappeared 
since the 1970s. Professional economists are overwhelmingly opposed to a return 
to the gold standard, and recent research shows that the first countries to end the 
gold standard were the first ones to escape the Great Depression. After World 
War II, Western economies adopted a modified gold standard under the Bretton 
Woods exchange rate system (1947–1971), but this too was abandoned in the early 
1970s. While mainly of historical interest, gold standards highlight a pure form of 
fixed exchange rate with a hard peg. Under a pure gold standard, nations keep 
gold as their international reserve. Gold is used to settle most international obli-
gations and nations must be prepared to trade it for their own currency whenever 
foreigners attempt to “redeem” the home currency they have earned by selling 
goods and services. In this sense, the nation’s money is backed by gold.
There are essentially three rules that countries must follow in order to main-
tain a gold exchange standard. First, they must fix the value of their currency 
unit (the dollar, the pound, the yen, and so on) in terms of gold. This fixes the 
exchange rate. For example, under the modified gold standard of the Bretton 
Woods exchange rate system, the U.S. dollar was fixed at $35 per ounce and the 
British pound was set at £12.5 per ounce. Since both currencies were fixed in 
terms of gold, they were implicitly set in terms of each other: $35 = one ounce of 
gold = £12.5, or 2.80 dollars per pound (2.80 = 35/12.5).
The second rule of the gold standard is that nations keep the supply of their 
domestic money fixed in some constant proportion to their supply of gold. This 
requirement is an informal one, but is necessary to ensure that the domestic 
money supply does not grow beyond the capacity of the gold supply to support it. 
The third rule of a gold standard is that nations must stand ready and willing to 
provide gold in exchange for their home country currency.
Consider what would happen if a country decided to print large quantities of 
money for which there is no gold backing. In the short run, purchases of domes-
tically produced goods would rise, causing domestic prices to rise as well. As 
domestic prices rise, foreign goods become more attractive, since a fixed exchange 
rate means that they have not increased in price. As imports in the home coun-
try increase, foreigners accumulate an unwanted supply of the home country’s 
currency. This is the point at which the gold standard would begin to become 
unhinged. If gold supplies are low in relation to the supply of domestic currency, 
the gold reserves will begin to run out at some point as the country pays out gold in 
exchange for its currency. This spells crisis and a possible end to the gold standard.
Under a fixed exchange rate system, the national supply and demand for for-
eign currencies may vary but the nominal exchange rate does not. It is the respon-
sibility of the monetary authorities (the central bank or treasury department) to 
keep the exchange rate fixed. Figure 10.6 illustrates the task before a national gov-
ernment when it wishes to keep its currency fixed. Suppose that the United States 

258
Part 3    International Finance
and the United Kingdom are both on the gold standard and the U.S. demand for 
British pounds increases.
In the short run or medium run, a rise in demand for pounds from D1 to D2 is 
caused by one of the factors listed in Table 10.4: increased U.S. demand for U.K. 
goods, higher U.K. or lower U.S. interest rates, or speculation that the value of 
the dollar might not remain fixed for much longer. If R1 is the fixed U.S.–U.K. 
exchange rate, then the United States must counter the weakening dollar and 
prevent the rate from depreciating to R2. One option is to sell the United States’ 
gold reserves in exchange for dollars. This puts gold in the hands of merchants, 
investors, or speculators who are trying to obtain British pounds. The quantity of 
gold that must be sold is equivalent to the value of the pounds represented by line 
segment AB. In effect, the United States meets the increased demand for British 
pounds by supplying international money—gold—to the market through a sale of 
some of its gold stock. Since gold and pounds are interchangeable, an increase in 
the supply of gold is equivalent to an increase in the supply of pounds, as shown 
in Figure 10.7, and the exchange rate stays at R1.
Under a pure gold standard, countries hold gold as a reserve instead of foreign 
currencies and sell their gold reserves in exchange for their own currency. This 
action increases the supply of gold—which is international money—and offsets the 
pressure on the home currency to depreciate. There are two possibilities for the 
home country as it sells its gold reserves. Either the demand for gold is satisfied 
and the pressure on its currency eases, or it begins to run out of gold. If the latter 
happens, the home country may be forced into a devaluation that is accomplished 
by changing the gold price of its currency. As an illustration, if the dollar is fixed 
at $35 per ounce of gold, a devaluation would shift the price of gold to something 
more than $35, say $50, and each ounce of gold sold by the United States buys 
back a greater quantity of dollars.

An increase in the demand for British pounds puts pressure on the exchange

Chapter 10    Exchange Rates and Exchange Rate Systems 
259
Pure gold standards have been rare since the 1930s. More commonly, countries 
have adopted modified gold standards, such as the Bretton Woods system (see the 
Case Study), or fixed exchange rate systems called pegged exchange rates. Pegged 
exchange rate systems operate similarly to a gold standard except that instead of 
gold, another currency is used to “anchor” the value of the home currency.
One potential source of problems with a pegged currency is that the home 
currency’s value is synchronized with its peg, so changes between the peg and a 
third-party currency are identical for the home currency and the third party. An 
example will clarify. Suppose that Thailand decides to peg its currency to the U.S. 
dollar at the rate of 25 Thai baht per U.S. dollar. The goal of Thailand’s central 
bank must be to supply dollars whenever it is asked to redeem its own baht. If the 
dollar appreciates against the Japanese yen, then so does the Thai baht, and at the 
same rate. Appreciation against the Japanese yen may or may not be a problem 
for Thailand’s producers, depending on the importance of the Japan–Thailand 
trade relationship. In 1997, it turned out to be very important, and declining Thai 
competitiveness from its appreciating currency played a prominent role in trig-
gering the Asian financial crisis of 1997–1998.
The simplest way to avoid this type of problem is to peg the currency not to one 
single currency, but to a group of currencies. This is, in fact, closer to Thailand’s 
actual policy in 1997. While this is slightly more complex arithmetically, it reduces 
the importance of any single country’s currency in the determination of the home 
country’s currency value. Typically, countries that adopt this strategy select the 
currencies of their most important trading partners as elements of the basket.
Pegged exchange rates can work very well under many circumstances, but 
another factor that can cause them to unravel is a significant difference in inflation 
rates between the home country and its peg. We saw previously that real exchange 
rates play a greater role in determining trade patterns than nominal rates. Using 
the United States–Thailand example, and looking at the equation that describes

Part 3    International Finance
the relationship between real and nominal exchange rates from Thailand’s point 
of view (as the home country), we have the following:
 Rr = (25 baht per dollar) * [(U.S. price level)/(Thai price level)]
 = Rn(P*/P)
Relatively high inflation in Thailand appears as a faster rate of change in P, 
and leads to a real appreciation in the baht. Under these circumstances, Thai 
producers are less competitive and U.S. producers are more so (in Thailand). If 
the situation persists, speculators will likely step in and begin to sell baht in the 
expectation that the pegged nominal rate of 25 baht per dollar will be devalued 
to offset the appreciation in the real rate. Moving the nominal peg from 25 to 30 
or 40 baht per dollar may be necessary to restore balance.
The most common technique for dealing with this problem is through the adop-
tion of a crawling peg. Crawling pegs are soft pegs that are fixed but periodically 
adjusted. The idea is to offset any differences in inflation (changes in P) through 
regular adjustments in Rn. If correctly handled, the real exchange rate remains 
constant and the impact of inflation differences never shows up as a change in 
competitiveness.
There are several other variations on the theme of fixed exchange rates. One 
of the key points to keep in mind is that purely fixed or purely flexible exchange 
rate arrangements are rare. When a currency is fixed in value, it is still subject to 
market pressures of supply and demand, which, at times, can force the government 
to alter the currency’s value. Similarly, when countries adopt a flexible exchange 
rate system, there is frequently some degree of government intervention in cur-
rency markets to try to shape its value.

The End of the Bretton Woods System
The Bretton Woods system of exchange rates was enacted at the end of World 
War II. It included most nations outside the former Soviet Union and its 
allies. The exchange rate system was a major component of the institutions 
designed to manage international economic conflict and to support interna-
tional economic cooperation. In addition to the exchange rate system, the 
other institutions created at the same time included the International Mone-
tary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
(IBRD) or World Bank, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT). (See Chapter 2.)
Each institution had its own role in the management of world economic 
affairs. The roles of the exchange rate were to provide stability by eliminating 

Chapter 10    Exchange Rates and Exchange Rate Systems 
261
excess currency fluctuations, to prevent nations from using exchange rate 
devaluations as a tactic for gaining markets for their goods, and to ensure 
an adequate supply of internationally accepted reserves so that nations could 
meet their international obligations.
In the Bretton Woods exchange rate system, the dollar was fixed to gold 
at the rate of $1 equaling 135 ounce of gold, or $35 per ounce. Every other 
currency within the system was fixed to the dollar and, therefore, indirectly to 
gold. Unlike a pure gold standard, however, countries could use U.S. dollars 
as their international reserve and did not have to accumulate gold or tie their 
money supply to their gold reserves.
The Bretton Woods exchange rate system had one fatal flaw—the dollar. 
The United States was in a privileged position since its currency was treated 
the same as gold. This meant that the United States could simply increase its 
money supply (the supply of dollars) and gain increased purchasing power 
over European, Japanese, and other countries’ goods. Other nations preferred 
the United States to maintain a relatively robust supply of dollars, since this 
ensured that there was an adequate supply of international reserves for the 
world economy.
Problems with this arrangement began when the U.S. economy expanded 
at a different rate than the economies of its trading partners. In the mid-to-
late 1960s, the United States deepened its involvement in the Vietnam War 
while it simultaneously created the “War on Poverty” at home. Both policies 
generated large fiscal expenditures that stimulated the economy. While U.S. 
expansion raced ahead of expansion elsewhere, Europeans found themselves 
accumulating dollars more rapidly than they desired. The dollars were a by-
product of U.S. economic expansion and partially reflected the price increases 
accompanying the expansion.
Under a different type of exchange rate system, it would have been appro-
priate for the United States to devalue its currency. U.S. prices had risen rela-
tive to foreign prices, the real exchange rate had appreciated as a consequence, 
and trade deficits were beginning to become a permanent feature of the U.S. 
economy.
One policy would have been to devalue the nominal dollar exchange rate, 
but this was not an option. Since every currency was tied to the dollar, there 
was no way for the United States to devalue against a group of other curren-
cies selectively. An alternative was for the United States to devalue against all 
currencies by changing the gold value of the dollar. By the late 1960s, it was 
becoming apparent that this would be necessary.
Persistent U.S. deficits had led to an accumulation of dollars outside the 
United States, which greatly exceeded the United States’ supply of gold. In 
other words, the United States lacked the gold reserves to back all of the 
dollars in circulation. Official recognition of this fact led to the Smithsonian 
Agreement of December 1971, in which the major industrialized countries 
agreed to devalue the gold content of the dollar by around 8 percent, from 
(continued)

262
Part 3    International Finance
$35 per ounce to $38.02. In addition, Japan, Germany, and other trade surplus 
countries increased the value of their currencies.
Although the Smithsonian Agreement was hailed by President Nixon as 
a fundamental reorganization of international monetary affairs, it quickly 
proved to be too little and of only temporary benefit. The gold value of the 
dollar was realigned again in early 1973, from $38.02 to $42.22. In addition, 
further devaluation occurred against other European currencies. The end of 
the system came in March of 1973 when the major currencies began to float 
against each other. A few currencies, such as the British pound, had begun to 
float earlier.
In each case, the strategy of allowing the exchange rate to float in response 
to supply and demand conditions was adopted as a means of coping with spec-
ulation. When speculators had perceived that the dollar was overvalued at 
$38 per ounce or $42 per ounce, they sold dollars in anticipation of a future 
devaluation. Nor was the dollar the only currency speculated against. Other 
weak currencies such as the pound and the Italian lira had also been correctly 
perceived as overvalued and had been sold off by speculators. In the end, the 
central banks of the weak-currency countries found it impossible to support an 
unrealistically high value of their currency. The costs of buying up the excess 
supply of their currencies at overvalued prices proved to be too great. The 
simplest solution was to let the currencies float.
CHOOSING THE RIGHT EXCHANGE RATE SYSTEM
LO 10.6	 State the necessary conditions for two or more countries to form a 
successful single currency area.
Given the menu of choices for exchange rate systems, an active area of economic 
research has focused on the performance characteristics of systems under differ-
ent economic conditions and institutional arrangements. For many years, econo-
mists debated the pros and cons of fixed and flexible rates, but as the variety of 
exchange rate options has grown, as capital mobility has increased, and as inter-
national trade and investment relations have deepened, researchers have become 
more concerned with understanding how varying degrees of flexibility or fixity 
might best serve the interests of individual countries. In particular, economists 
have tried to learn how different exchange rate systems might influence the core 
elements of a country’s macroeconomy such as the rate of economic growth, the 
rate of inflation, and the frequency of currency crises.
Traditional views held that countries with fixed exchange rate systems were 
better at controlling inflation, but that they paid a price in the form of slower 
economic growth. The reasoning behind this view was that in order to maintain a 
fixed rate, governments have to be very careful about issuing new money. Since 
most of the episodes of hyperinflation during the second half of the twentieth 

Chapter 10    Exchange Rates and Exchange Rate Systems 
263
century resulted from overexpanding the money supply, it seems reasonable that 
an exchange rate policy that limits the supply of money would also help avoid 
inflation. In the view of some economists, however, the limits placed on the abil-
ity of a country to manipulate its money supply also remove an important tool 
that governments use to help manage the rate of economic growth. Therefore, the 
tradeoff was lower growth for lower inflation.
More recent research, particularly with data from the 1990s, has failed to dem-
onstrate a strong relationship between the type of exchange rate system and either 
inflation or economic growth. Before the 1990s, countries with fixed or pegged 
exchange rates tended to have lower rates of inflation, but during the 1990s the 
differences disappeared. Similarly, there is evidence that countries with more flex-
ible rates tend to have higher average rates of economic growth, but this result 
depends on the classification of the fastest growing Asian economies. Technically, 
many of these countries have flexible exchange rates, but at the same time they 
manage them very closely. When they are omitted from the analysis, there is no 
significant difference in the rate of growth between countries with relatively fixed 
and relatively flexible rates. And finally, neither fixed nor flexible rates seem to 
offer superior protection against a currency crisis. As a result, no particular system 
seems to rank above any other in its ability to provide superior macroeconomic 
performance.
Insofar as economists have been able to devise a set of rules for selecting an 
exchange rate system, they are very general and very basic. If the goal is to find 
the system that helps minimize negative shocks to an economy, then the source 
of the shock determines whether a more flexible or more fixed system should be 
adopted. When the shocks originate in the monetary sector—for example, a cen-
tral bank that goes overboard in printing new money—a fixed rate is better since 
it imposes discipline on the central bank. On the other hand, if the shocks to an 
economy originate in the external environment—for example, a sudden change 
in the price of imported oil—then relatively more flexibility in the exchange rate 
enables the country to adapt to the changes more easily. The general argument 
here is that individual country characteristics matter a great deal. The problem 
with these rules, however, is that the source of the shocks to an economy are likely 
to vary from episode to episode and, as a consequence, the basic rules outlined 
above provide less practical guidance than desired.
Exchange rate pegs are popular, particularly with many developing countries. 
There are a couple of reasons for this. First, all economists agree that one of the 
most important elements of an exchange rate system is its credibility. That is, no 
matter what type of exchange rate is adopted, a successful system must generate 
confidence and the widespread belief that it is sustainable. Exchange rate systems 
that lack credibility are guaranteed to fail in their basic job of providing a smooth 
and reliable conversion between domestic and foreign money. Under some con-
ditions, exchange rate pegs may offer greater credibility. One of the conditions, 
and the second reason why some countries continue to peg their currencies, is a 
relatively high degree of trade dependence on a single, major economy. Consider 
the case of Mexico, with about 80 percent of its trade with the United States. 

264
Part 3    International Finance
Because of its trade dependence on the United States, Mexico pegged its peso 
to the U.S. dollar for many years. Because Mexican inflation ran higher than the 
U.S. rate, a crawling peg was favored as the means of keeping the real exchange 
rate relatively constant. The purpose of the dollar peg was to provide benefits to 
Mexican businesses and consumers by eliminating some of the price variation in 
Mexican imports and exports. The rule seems to be that when a country is closely 
tied to the economy of a large, industrial country such as the United States, peg-
ging to its currency may provide additional stability and help businesses plan their 
futures with greater confidence.
This view is shared by many, but at the same time it is widely accepted that, in 
Mexico’s case, a flexible exchange rate has served it better than the pegged rates 
it used before 1994. The reason for the discrepancy between what might work 
in theory and what has worked in practice highlights the complexity of choos-
ing an exchange rate system when every country has unique economic factors 
and its own set of institutions shaping its economic outcomes. Mexico, due to 
a set of agreements between the business sector, organized labor, and govern-
ment, was unable to make the periodic adjustments to its nominal exchange rate 
that are required with a crawling peg. In effect, Mexico’s institutional inability 
to adjust its nominal exchange rate undermined the credibility of the exchange 
rate system. The lack of credibility led to periodic bouts of speculation against 
the peso whenever it was perceived to be overvalued and vulnerable. Several of 
these speculative bouts were followed by a peso collapse and economic reces-
sion. The lesson, in the end, seems to be that the first criterion for choosing an 
exchange rate system is that it must have credibility in currency and financial 
markets.
C A S E  S T U D Y
Monetary Unions
Some countries prefer not to have their own currency. Nineteen of the twenty-
eight countries of the EU use a common currency, the euro, and more are 
expected to join. Panama adopted the dollar as a legal tender alongside its 
own currency, called the cordoba, in the early twentieth century, and in 2000 
Ecuador and El Salvador eliminated their currencies altogether and adopted 
the dollar.
Dollarization is the term given to the adoption of another country’s cur-
rency. Dollarization differs from a monetary union, such as the Eurozone, 
because a union has a common central bank that issues the currency and car-
ries out monetary policy. By contrast, the central banks of El Salvador and 
Ecuador have no ability to issue money, and no control over monetary policy 

Chapter 10    Exchange Rates and Exchange Rate Systems 
265
because they cannot expand or contract the money supply. There is no bar-
rier in international law to using another country’s money, but in doing so, a 
country becomes powerless to influence its exchange rate or the quantity of 
money in circulation.
There are currently four monetary unions in the world (Table 10.6). They are 
the European Monetary Union (EMU, or Eurozone is discussed in Chapter 14), 
the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), the West African Economic 
and Monetary Union (WAEMU), and the Central African Economic and Mon-
etary Community, which is known by its French acronym, CEMAC.
The two African unions, WAEMU and CEMAC, are the oldest of the 
monetary unions. Both were formed out of former French colonies in West-
ern Africa and both use the CFA franc as their currency. (CFA stands for 
Communauté; Française Africaine, or French African Community.) Both the 
WAEMU and the CEMAC have central banks that issue their currencies and 
both fix it to the euro at approximately 656 CFA francs per euro, and the 
two currencies are interchangeable. The French Treasury Department backs 
both currencies and stands ready to provide currency reserves if either of the 
two central banks of the monetary unions runs short.
According to most observers, the advantages of CFA francs over indepen-
dent currencies is that they have lowered inflation in the participating countries 
and reduced macroeconomic instability. Since the central banks are responsi-
ble for more than one economy, it has probably reduced the political influence 
of individual governments and led to a steadier, less volatile monetary policy. 
The disadvantages are the same as those for a fixed exchange rate: Changes 
in the value of the currency cannot be used to protect the domestic economy 
against shocks that begin outside the country. For example, as the euro gained 
value against the dollar after 2000, the CFA franc also appreciated against the 
dollar and goods produced in the CFA franc zone became more expensive

Single Currency Areas
On January 1, 1999 eleven members of the EU adopted the euro as their official 
currency. As the EU added new members in the first decade of the new century, 
several chose to use the euro, and as of 2016, nineteen of the EU’s twenty-eight 
members had replaced their national currencies with the euro. This was the result 
of a shared vision developed over many decades of deeper economic, monetary, 
and political integration. Given that a nation’s currency is one of its strongest 
symbols of national sovereignty, the fact that so many countries have decided to 
give up their currencies and their ability to set monetary policy is a remarkable 
set of events.
There are at least four potential reasons why a group of countries might want to 
share a common currency. First, a single currency eliminates the need to convert 
each other’s money and thereby reduces transaction costs in a number of ways. It 
eliminates fees paid to the banks or to the currency brokers that arrange the con-
version, it simplifies accounting and bookkeeping, and it enables consumers and 
investors to compare prices across international boundaries more accurately. Each 
of these advantages provides some gain in efficiency and a reduction in business 
costs. Second, a single currency eliminates price fluctuations caused by changes 
in the exchange rate. When speculators move their money into or out of a coun-
try, or when temporary interest rate changes in one country alter the supply and 
demand for foreign exchange, one country may become (temporarily) cheaper or 
more expensive for business. As a result, business decisions may reflect temporary 
shifts in currency values rather than underlying issues of economic efficiency. The 
elimination of misleading price signals that result from exchange rate fluctuations 
is also a potential gain in efficiency.
Third, the elimination of exchange rates through the adoption of a single cur-
rency can help increase political trust between countries seeking to increase their 
integration. A single currency removes some of the friction between integrating 
nations by eliminating the problems that are caused by exchange rate misalign-
ments. Fourth, in some developing countries the adoption of a common currency 
may give their exchange rate system greater credibility. Use of such a currency 
when priced in dollars. This particularly affected the WAEMU, which mainly 
exports cotton and other agricultural products.
All of the monetary unions are also economic unions (for example, the EU), 
common markets (ECCU is the basis for the Caribbean Common Market), 
or customs unions (WAEMU and CEMAC). Monetary union implies a high 
level of integration and coordination and is only worthwhile if other elements 
of the economy are also integrated. There is not a great deal of agreement as 
to the value or necessity of monetary unions, but without additional economic 
integration they make little sense.

Chapter 10    Exchange Rates and Exchange Rate Systems

can reduce exchange rate fluctuations and create greater confidence in the finan-
cial system of the adopting country, possibly leading to lower interest rates and 
increased availability of credit, although this depends on the overall soundness of 
the financial system.
Nations that give up their national money do not do so without cost. In addi-
tion to its political symbolism, the adoption of a common currency also means 
that the country no longer has its own money supply as a tool for managing its 
economic growth. The topic of monetary policy is taken up in more detail in 
Chapter 11, but the basic point is easy to grasp. Countries with their own cur-
rency can influence the rate of growth of the economy in the short run (but not 
in the long run) through a change in the supply of money. When a country adopts 
a common currency with one or more other countries, it gives up this tool. After 
the introduction of the common currency, there is only one money supply and, 
consequently, one rate of growth of the money supply. New York, for example, 
shares a common currency with California, and, as a consequence, both states 
experience the same changes in the money supply. If New York is growing fast 
and California is growing slowly, it would be impossible for the Federal Reserve 
to alter the money supply in a way that would speed up growth in California and 
slow it down in New York. With a single currency, there is a “one-size-fits-all” 
monetary policy.
A second potential cost to adopting a single currency is that countries give 
up their ability to alter their exchange rates. Exchange rate adjustments are 
sometimes the least costly way to restore competitiveness after a round of price 
increases. For example, during the years leading up to the financial crisis of 
2007–2009, a number of Eurozone countries in the Mediterranean region experi-
enced housing and construction bubbles which pushed up their prices and wages. 
Once the crisis began, they were less competitive against northern European 
nations where prices had not increased as much. In order to restore competitive-
ness, they were expected to implement policies aimed at pushing down prices 
and wages inside their countries and did not have the option to devalue their 
currencies to make their goods cheaper. Policies that attempt to create deflation 
are usually very painful to implement since they entail lower demand and slower 
or negative growth.
Conditions for Adopting a Single Currency
The starting point for analyzing the costs and benefits of a single currency area 
is the work of Robert Mundell on the theory of optimal currency areas. Mundell 
developed the first set of criteria to determine whether two or more countries 
are better off sharing a currency instead of using their separate national moneys. 
Mundell and subsequent research points to four conditions for deciding whether 
the gains are greater than the costs.
The first condition is that the business cycle must be synchronized and national 
economies must enter recessions and expansions at more or less the same time. 

268
Part 3    International Finance
In this case, a single monetary policy is appropriate since each country is individu-
ally at the same point in the business cycle and there is no cost associated with the 
loss of national monetary policy and its replacement with a single policy for all 
member states. In fact, however, few countries are that well synchronized in their 
business cycles. Even the states of the United States enter and leave recessions at 
different points in time, and the national figures on growth only reflect an average 
across all fifty states.
The second condition is a high degree of labor and capital mobility between 
the member countries. This allows workers and capital to leave countries or 
regions where work is scarce and to join the supply of labor and capital in 
booming regions. In effect, free migration of the factors of production smooths 
out some of the differences in the business cycle by taking unemployed inputs 
and moving them to where they are needed. This is how the fifty states of 
the United States compensate for a lack of complete synchronization in the 
business cycles of individual states. When conditions are bad in one region, 
workers and investors move their labor and capital to another region, freeing 
inputs from areas where they are not needed and providing them to areas where  
they are.
While capital tends to be relatively mobile, labor is less so, even within coun-
tries. Therefore, a third condition is that there are regional policies capable of 
addressing the imbalances that may develop. Depressed areas may remain 
depressed if people cannot move or choose not to move because the psychologi-
cal or other costs are too high or resources outside the region are not available. 
In the United States, federal taxes and transfer payments help depressed regions 
adjust and limit some of the shock. When a state is in recession, for example, 
people still receive their social security checks, Medicare, and other federal trans-
fers. Federal taxes and payments spread the adjustment across the nation and 
ensure that it is not left up to the state alone. Insofar as the economics of regional 
policies are concerned, they may be determined at any level, from the currency 
area (multicountry), to individual nation-states, to subnational units (provinces 
or cities). The key point is not the agency responsible, but that there are effective 
policies for assisting regions that may not be synchronized with the majority of 
the currency area’s economy.
Finally, the first three conditions point to the fourth: The nations involved must 
be seeking a level of integration that goes beyond simple free trade. Free trade 
requires that nations remove their tariffs, quotas, and other border barriers that 
inhibit the flow of goods. If this is the goal, a common currency is unnecessary. 
If something much deeper is sought, however, such as a greater harmonization 
of national economies and much closer economic and political ties, then a single 
currency can be helpful, provided the other three conditions are observed. This 
condition is admittedly ambiguous and is part of the reason why policymakers 
do not always agree in their analysis. It is somewhat circular reasoning, but true 
nevertheless, that the desirability of a single currency partly depends on the goals 
of the countries involved.

Is the NAFTA Region  
an Optimal Currency Area?
The EU is one model for the creation of a single currency. In the EU model, an 
entirely new currency is created, and each country gives up its national money. 
The on and off discussion of a single currency in the NAFTA countries has 
favored a different model. So far, discussion has centered on the adoption of 
the U.S. dollar by all three countries instead of the creation of an entirely new 
currency. Either model leads to the same outcome: a single currency area. Is the 
discussion realistic? That is, are the proponents of a single currency dreaming 
or is there something to be gained in such a move?
It is clear that whatever the long-run advantages or disadvantages of a sin-
gle currency might be, the NAFTA countries have a long way to go before 
they meet the four conditions necessary for a single currency area to be an 
optimal policy. First, the business cycles of the three countries have not been 
synchronized, at least historically. While the macroeconomies of Canada and 
the United States have often moved together, Mexico has historically had a 
very different pattern of business cycles. This may be changing, however, since 
the Mexican cycle appears to be much closer to that of the United States since 
1994. Second, given the legal restrictions on labor movement and the political 
obstacles to opening a North American labor market, labor flows cannot be 
counted on to help synchronize national business cycles. Third, there are no 
regional policies within the NAFTA framework and no way to create transfers 
from one country to another to compensate for slower growth or recession in 
one area while other places are expanding. Finally, NAFTA was originally 
conceived as a means to reduce border barriers. While its ultimate goal will 
surely evolve over time, currently there does not appear to be a consensus that 
it should be something more than a free-trade area.
As it is now constituted, the NAFTA region is clearly not an optimal cur-
rency area. Nevertheless, it is a safe bet that dollarization will continue to be 
explored, particularly in Mexico. In part, this is because there are counter- 
arguments to each of the above objections: A single currency will help synchro-
nize the three economies; it is possible to formulate an agreement that allows a 
guest worker program such as the United States and Mexico had in the 1940s, 
1950s, and 1960s; regional policies are simply a matter of political will and 
financial means, but they would not require huge expenditures; and closer inte-
gration of the NAFTA partners is inevitable. Nevertheless, given the problems 
of the euro zone countries beginning in 2011, it is highly unlikely that any seri-
ous analyst might try to push a single currency agenda in the NAFTA region.

Summary
■
■People hold foreign currency to buy goods and services, to take advantage 
of interest rate differentials, and to speculate. The primary institutions in the 
exchange-rate market are commercial banks and foreign exchange brokers.
■
■Exchange rates can be analyzed with supply and demand analysis, as if 
they are just another commodity in the economy. Increases (decreases) in 
the supply of foreign exchange cause the domestic currency to appreciate 
(depreciate). Increases (decreases) in the demand for foreign exchange 
cause the domestic currency to depreciate (appreciate).
■
■Exchange rates are unpredictable because they are simultaneously influ-
enced by long-run, medium-run, and short-run factors. In the long run, pur-
chasing power parity is important. In the medium run, the business cycle is 
important, and in the short run, interest-rate differentials and speculation 
are important.
■
■The interest parity condition says that the interest rate differential be-
tween two countries is approximately equal to the percentage difference 
between the forward and spot exchange rates.
■
■Firms use forward exchange rate markets to protect against exchange  
rate risk.
■
■Real exchange rates are equal to nominal or market exchange rates ad-
justed for inflation. They give a better picture of the purchasing power of a 
nation’s currency.
■
■Fixed exchange rate systems were thought to help limit the growth of 
inflation, but there is little evidence of this over the last two decades. Fixed 
exchange rates eliminate the ability of governments to use monetary poli-
cies to regulate the macroeconomy.
■
■Flexible exchange rate systems were thought to help increase growth, but 
there is little evidence of this over the last two decades. Flexible exchange 
rates free a nation’s macroeconomic policies from the priority of maintain-
ing a fixed exchange rate and allow for a greater use of monetary and fiscal 
policies to achieve economic growth goals.
■
■All exchange rate systems are on a continuum between fixed and flexible 
rates. Crawling pegs and managed floating rates are examples of intermediate 
systems between absolutely fixed and completely flexible systems. The most 
important rule for countries is that their exchange rate system is credible.
■
■Optimal currency areas are geographical regions within which it is opti-
mal for countries to adopt the same currency. The criteria for an optimal 
currency area are a synchronized business cycle, complete factor mobility, 
regional programs for lagging areas, and a desire to achieve a higher level 
of economic and political integration.

APPENDIX 
The Interest Rate Parity Condition
The following variables are defined as in the chapter:
i = home country interest rate, i* = foreign interest rate, R = the nominal 
exchange rate in units of home country currency per unit of foreign currency, 
F = the forward exchange rate 
The forward rate and the interest rates have the same term to maturity.
An investor has a choice between i and i*. Letting the dollar be the home cur-
rency, $1 invested today will return $1(1 + i) next period if invested at home. 

Chapter 10    Exchange Rates and Exchange Rate Systems 
273
To make the comparison with a foreign investment, the dollar first has to be 
converted into the foreign currency, then invested, and the earnings must be con-
verted back into dollars. The equivalent of $1 in foreign currency is 1/R. If 1/R is 
invested abroad, at the end of the next period it returns (1/R)(1 + i*), which is in 
units of foreign currency. The reconversion to dollars can be done in the forward 
market where the exchange rate for a forward contract is F. Therefore, in dollars, 
$1 invested abroad will return (1/R)(1 + i*)F in the next period.
The interest parity condition states that investors will be indifferent between 
home and foreign investments (of similar risk), implying that they will move their 
funds around and cause interest rates and exchange rates to change until the 
returns are the same in the two cases:
1 + i = (1/R)(1 + i*)F = (1 + i*)(F/R)
Divide by (1 + i*):
(1 + i)/(1 + i*) = F/R
Subtract 1 from both sides:
[(1 + i)/(1 + i*)] - [(1 + i*)/(1 + i*)] = F/R - R/R
[(1 + i) - (1 + i*)]/[(1 + i*)] = (F - R)/R
(i - i*)/(1 + i*) = (F - R)/R.
The left-hand side denominator is close to 1 for small values of i* (this is why we 
state the interest parity condition as an approximation). The right-hand side is 
the percentage difference between the forward and spot rates. If it is negative, 
markets expect an appreciation in the home currency. Rewriting the last equation,
i - i* ≈(F - R)/R,
which says that the difference between home country and foreign interest rates is 
approximately equal to the expected depreciation in the home country currency.

INTRODUCTION: THE MACROECONOMY IN A GLOBAL 
SETTING
Chapters 9 and 10 introduced the concepts of the balance of payments and the exchange 
rate. In this chapter we look more closely at their relationship to each other and to the 
overall national economy. After a brief review of a few key macroeconomic concepts, 
the chapter focuses on the interactions among the current account, exchange rates, and 
key components of the macroeconomy—consumption, investment, and government 
­spending. National governments are important to this chapter since they rarely take a 
passive role in the economy. Indeed, since the worldwide Great Depression of the 1930s, 
and especially since the end of World War II, national governments have shouldered a 
significant share of the responsibility for keeping the growth of the economy on track, the 
unemployment rate low, and prices stable. This role is particularly evident in the crisis that 
began in 2007 and the recession that followed. Therefore, a major focus of this ­chapter is 
the impact of macroeconomic policies on the exchange rate and current account.
The impacts of activist macroeconomic policies are one focus of this chapter, but 
it is also important to recognize that these are not the only links between a nation’s 
macroeconomy and the rest of the world. Governments control a significant share of

the national product and as a consequence, their normal, day-to-day operating 
decisions affect exchange rates and the current account. The same is true for 
consumers and businesses, both of which have significant macroeconomic impacts 
and can alter exchange rates, current account balances, and capital flows through 
their spending and saving.
AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
LO 11.1	 Diagram a shift in aggregate demand or supply and explain the impact 
on the price level and GDP.
Table 11.1 shows the four main economic agents in the macroeconomy: house-
holds, businesses, government, and foreigners. In our simplified model of the 
macroeconomy, households supply all the factors of production (land, labor, and 
capital) that businesses need to produce the nation’s output. In return, the rev-
enue that businesses earn when they sell their goods is used to pay for the factors 
supplied by households. Accordingly, all of the income generated in the economy 
accrues to households since they supply all of the factor inputs. This is a funda-
mental identity in the macroeconomy: The income for the economy as a whole 
equals the value of its output.
When we track income and output, it is important to understand the position 
of intermediate inputs—goods purchased by one business from another to use 
in production. For example, a car manufacturer not only hires labor, land, and 
capital (for which it pays wages and salaries, rents, interest, and dividends) but 
also purchases glass, tires, steel, and so on. The payment for auto glass is not 
directly income to households because it is paid to another business; but if we

trace it back, it ultimately becomes income. For example, the glass manufacturer 
receives payment from the car company, and it uses the payment to pay wages, 
rent, interest, and dividends, as well as its suppliers. We can keep following the 
flow of payments through the suppliers to the glass firms, or more simply, we 
can recognize that all of the payments are incorporated into the value of the 
car. That is, the purchase price of the car ultimately generates an equivalent 
amount of income. As a result, the fundamental identity holds between income 
and output.
The identity between total expenditures on final goods and services and the 
value of total output in an economy can be looked at in another way that is ­similar 
to a graph of supply and demand in a single market, except that the demand 
curve is total demand for all final goods and services and the supply curve is 
total output. In other words, the curve with a negative slope is aggregate demand 
(AD), and the curve with a positive slope is aggregate supply (AS). In a simple 
supply and demand graph, the horizontal axis measures quantity and the verti-
cal axis measures price; but in the AD/AS graph shown in Figure 11.1, all final 
goods gross domestic product (GDP) are included on the horizontal axis, and the 
price level (P) is shown on the vertical axis. The price level is equivalent to the 
consumer price index or another measure of economy-wide prices. Points along 
the AD curve show the equilibrium levels of output and prices that are consistent 
on the demand side of the economy, while the AS curve shows the points that

The aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the levels of output (GDP) and price 
(P) where expenditure decisions and prices match; aggregate supply (AS) shows 
the levels of output and prices where output and prices match. Together they 
show the levels of equilibrium output (Q1) and prices (P1).

Chapter 11    An Introduction to Open Economy Macroeconomics 
277
are consistent from a supply-side point of view. Together, they show the levels of 
equilibrium output (Q1) and prices (P1) at a given point in time.
The shape of the aggregate supply curve is designed to call attention to three 
regions of GDP. On the horizontal part of the AS curve, the economy is operating 
below full employment. Theoretically, the availability of unemployed workers and 
other idle resources allows an increase in output to occur without putting upward 
pressure on prices. Workers and the owners of other factors cannot demand higher 
wages or other payments in return for more inputs of labor and capital because 
there are plenty of idle workers and other resources willing and able to contrib-
ute at the going rate. Hence, an increase in production can be relatively easily 
achieved without causing shortages of inputs or increases in prices. The middle, 
upward-sloping part of the AS curve symbolizes the range of GDP where inputs 
begin to become scarce. Some wage increases or other factor price increases are 
necessary to obtain more inputs and to produce more output. In the vertical region 
of the AS curve, the economy is at full employment and no more output is pos-
sible until new workers enter the labor force or new factories and machines are 
built. ­Figure 11.1 portrays this region as an absolute limit to production. In fact, it 
is possible to exceed this level for short periods of time, for example, during wars 
or other extraordinary events that cause people to work longer hours or at a faster 
pace than they are willing to maintain over the long run. Given that output levels 
beyond the vertical region can be sustained only for a short period, it is useful to 
think of the vertical portion of the AS curve as signifying the full-employment 
level of GDP.
In the short run and medium run, the focus is on changes in aggregate demand 
that are initiated by one or more of the economic agents listed in Table 11.1. 
Significant changes in expenditures are not at all uncommon over the course of 
a year or more. For example, as an economy goes into recession, consumers and 
businesses may quickly alter their expectations and their spending (C and I) as 
they reassess their economic circumstances. Similarly, recessions, wars, natu-
ral disasters, and other factors can cause large shifts in government tax (T) and 
expenditure (G) policies, as well as changes in other policies that directly affect 
consumer and business spending. Finally, economic booms or depressions abroad 
sometimes cause a rapid change in foreign purchases of products exported (EX) 
from the home country.
Figure 11.2 illustrates the case of an increase in aggregate demand. The source 
of the change could be an increase in expenditures by any one of the economic 
agents listed in Table 11.1. That is, it could be due to an increase in consump-
tion expenditures (C), business investment (I), government purchases of final 
goods and services (G), government tax cuts that stimulate consumer or business 
spending, or exports (EX) purchased by foreigners. The net result of any of the 
changes is qualitatively the same. Prices rise slightly from P1 to P2 as factor inputs 
become scarcer, and GDP rises from Q1 to Q2. If the economy initially happened 
to be on the horizontal part of the AS curve, then prices would not have risen, 
but output would still have gone up. If the changes commenced from a position 
of full employment on the vertical part of the AS curve, then all of the change 

278
Part 3    International Finance
would have been in the price level, and no increase in output would occur. If AD 
falls instead of rising, the effects are symmetrical and in the opposite direction of 
the changes caused by an increase in AD.
Although the simple relationships between AD, AS, P, and GDP portrayed in 
Figures 11.1 and 11.2 are a useful way to conceptualize the interactions of a num-
ber of key macroeconomic variables, the graphs and the description hide a great 
deal of complexity. For example, the graphs illustrate only one point in time, and 
they do not show what happens as the economy grows over time. If an economy 
grows, it must have more labor or more physical capital or natural resources and 
be capable of producing more output. Hence, economic growth could be added by 
shifting the whole AS curve rightward. Consequently, the changes in Figure 11.2 
must be viewed as short-run or medium-run changes that take effect separately 
from economic growth.
Another factor that is hiding behind Figure 11.2 is the actual mechanism that 
moves the economy from one level of GDP (Q1) to a higher level (Q2). Suppose, 
for example, that AD begins to shift rightward due to rising business optimism 
that prompts many firms to increase their investment spending. Firms order new 
machines or start new construction projects, and total spending in the economy 
goes up. This is not the end of the story, however, as the firms that supply the 
machines or do the construction will have to increase their output levels, and that 
will put additional income in the hands of their owners and workers. Those sup-
pliers and their workers are likely to spend at least part of their additional income. 
Statistical analysis over long periods of time has shown that there is a very close

quantitative relationship between income received by households and household 
consumption patterns. That is, as income rises, so do expenditures. Consequently, 
the workers and business owners who supply goods and services to the investing 
firms increase their own expenditures as well. They buy houses, furniture, cars, 
college education, medical care, and all the other things that households spend 
money on, thus creating another round of income increases and expenditures.
In effect, the original increase in investment spending causes an increase in pro-
duction. Because output equals income in the macroeconomy, incomes go up by 
an amount equal to the value of the increased production. In turn, higher incomes 
lead to another set of expenditures and production increases and another round of 
income increases, and so on. When a new equilibrium is eventually reached and the 
effect of the original change in spending has completely worked its way through the 
economy, the total increase in GDP is greater than the original increase in spending. 
This is the multiplier effect of an increase in aggregate demand. There is no con-
sensus among economists about the size of the multiplier effect, although there is a 
consensus that it varies quite a bit and depends on a number of factors. Some of the 
factors are whether an economy is in recession or near full employment, what sec-
tors receive the initial increase in spending, and how the spending is financed. For 
example, if the economy is at full employment and has no idle resources, increases 
in government spending will crowd- out private spending and the net effect is likely 
to be zero. On the other hand, an economy in recession has many idle resources 
and increases in government spending are likely to lead to the re-employment of 
some of them and a net increase in output. After the United States implemented a 
stimulus package in 2009 to combat the recession, the politically independent Con-
gressional Budget Office estimated a range of multipliers that reflected the views of 
most economists. In their analysis, spending multipliers for the purchase of goods 
and services during the recession were between 1.0 and 2.5, multipliers from trans-
fers ranged between 0.8 and 2.5, and tax cut multipliers were between 0.2 and 1.5.
The multiplier process of spending-production-income-spending and so on 
might seem as if it could go on forever, but in fact the impact of the original 
expenditure gets smaller and smaller, rather like the waves that radiate out from 
a rock thrown into a pond. There are several forces that dampen the impact over 
time and bring GDP to a new equilibrium level. Three of the dampening forces are 
taxes, saving, and imports. In most countries, each successive increase in income 
will lead to additional taxes and saving, as well as additional spending. On aver-
age, when incomes rise, people spend part of the increase, pay taxes with part, and 
save part. Taxes vary by country, and as we saw in Chapter 9, the amount saved 
varies as well. The larger the part taken by government or saved by households, 
the faster the impact of the original expenditure dissipates.
Each successive increase in income in the spending-production-income- 
spending cycle will also trigger an increase in imports. We can be certain of this 
effect because part of what households buy is imported, so if they increase their 
purchases, they will also be buying more imported goods. All three of the vari-
ables—taxes, savings, and imports—cause the next round of spending on goods that 
are domestically produced to be less than the first round; therefore, they ensure 

280
Part 3    International Finance
that the income and spending effects moving through the economy are becoming 
smaller and smaller in each successive round. In addition, the three variables also 
show why the multiplier varies from country to country. The greater imports are as 
a share of spending, savings, and taxes, the more each successive round of spending 
is reduced from the previous. That is, countries with larger propensities to import, 
higher saving rates, or higher tax rates will have smaller multipliers.
FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICIES
LO 11.2	 Diagram the effects on GDP and the price level of expansionary and 
contractionary fiscal and monetary policies.
The discussion of aggregate demand, aggregate supply, and the multiplier is back-
ground for the analysis of the effects of fiscal and monetary policies on GDP 
and prices. Fiscal policy includes government taxation and expenditures, while 
monetary policy covers the money supply and interest rates. The institutions that 
enact fiscal and monetary policy vary across countries; but generally the legisla-
tive and executive branches are responsible for tax policy and for determining 
spending priorities, and the central bank and the finance ministry set monetary 
policy, sometimes with direct input from the executive branch of government if the 
central bank is not independent of the government. During the last two decades, 
there has been a trend toward granting central banks complete independence 
in setting monetary policy, as has historically been the case in several countries, 
including the United States.
Fiscal Policy
Government’s fiscal policies of expenditure and taxation are an important element 
of every country’s macroeconomy, because they are a major determinant of the 
total demand for goods and services. All else being equal, when a government 
increases its spending, the increase ripples through the economy as a series of 
production-income-spending increases that lead to higher levels of equilibrium 
GDP. The same effect occurs when governments cut their expenditures, but in the 
opposite direction as production, income, and spending all decrease.
Changes in tax levels are similar in their analysis. A decrease in taxes will raise 
household income—what is available to save or spend—because fewer taxes are 
withdrawn from paychecks. The increase in after-tax income in turn will lead to 
increases in spending, production, and income again. Figure 11.2 can be inter-
preted as either an increase in government spending or a cut in taxes. In both 
cases, the AD curve shifts rightward, and both GDP and the price level rise.
For obvious reasons, cuts in taxes and increases in government spending are 
referred to as expansionary fiscal policy. The opposite, contractionary fiscal ­policy, 
or austerity, is a tax increase or a cut in government spending, both of which 
reduce the level of equilibrium GDP by shifting the AD curve to the left. Contrac-
tionary policy is symmetrical with expansionary policy, so that tax increases and

government spending cuts have a negative multiplier effect on total output, while 
tax cuts and government spending increases have a positive multiplier effect. It is 
important to note that we are assuming that nothing else changes other than the 
single change in fiscal policy. For example, there is no assumption that government 
budgets are balanced, and an increase in government spending does not imply a 
simultaneous increase in taxes. Similarly, cuts in taxes are not countered by cuts 
in spending, nor are tax increases balanced by government spending increases.
For many macroeconomists of the 1940s and 1950s, the discovery of the mul-
tiplier effect of fiscal policy was like finding the holy grail of macroeconomics. It 
seemed to offer a technique for managing the economy and, most importantly, 
for avoiding disasters such as the Great Depression of the 1930s. Needless to say, 
most economists today are much more cautious about the use of fiscal policy. The 
reasons are not hard to understand. First, expansionary policies tend to cause 
inflation, which offsets some of the increased consumer spending by absorbing it 
into higher prices instead of higher output. Second, there is a substantial margin 
of error in the estimation of the size of the multiplier. Does a $50 billion tax cut 
lead to a $50 billion, $75 billion, or $100 billion increase in income? Third, the 
use of fiscal policy is complicated by the variation in effects stemming from the 
different possibilities for financing an expansionary policy. If governments accom-
modate the expansionary fiscal policy with an expansion of the money supply, 
the multiplier is larger if there is no accommodation. Taken together, the three 
technical problems of inflation, the margin for error in measuring the multiplier, 
and variation in the multiplier’s size depending on the means of paying for the 
expansion make it difficult to use fiscal policy precisely.
But this is not all. The politics of turning government spending off and on, or 
turning taxes off and on, is a long, drawn-out, and complicated process. By the 
time the legislation is passed, the purpose for which it was originally intended may 
have disappeared entirely. In other words, fiscal policy as a tool for managing the 
economy to avoid recessions and curtail inflation is politically cumbersome. Taken 
together, the political problem plus the technical problem of measuring its precise 
effects make fiscal policy a less used tool for managing the economy. Nevertheless, 
it is still important to study, since government spending and taxation policies have 
significant impacts on the macroeconomy and the current account, regardless of 
whether they are implemented to achieve a particular macroeconomic objective. 
Furthermore, in times of extreme stress, such as the aftermath of the subprime 
crisis of 2007–2009, many economists argue that fiscal policy can be very effective 
in countering a deep recession.
Monetary Policy
Monetary policy is the other main category of policies that national governments 
use to influence the macroeconomy. As noted, in the United States, the Euro-
pean Union (EU), and a growing number of other nations, monetary policy is 
determined by an independent central bank. Therefore, it reflects the views of the 
central bank and its responses to economic conditions rather than the views of a 
particular political party or the executive branch of government.

282
Part 3    International Finance
Monetary policy works through a combination of changes to the supply of money 
and changes to interest rates. When the central bank changes the supply of money, it 
does so by changing the quantity of funds in financial institutions that are available 
for lending. The most frequently used technique for accomplishing this is called open 
market operations. Open market operations are simply the buying and selling of 
bonds in the open market. When a central bank sells bonds, banks and other financial 
institutions give up some of their cash. Consequently, cash reserves shrink through-
out the financial system. Buying bonds has the opposite effect on the financial sys-
tem’s reserves of cash and is the primary technique for expanding the money supply.
As cash reserves in the financial system increase, there is likely to be more 
investment. That is, financial institutions such as banks need to generate revenue 
by making loans. Money sitting in the vaults earns the bank no revenue, so an 
increase in bank reserves leads banks to make more loans. To encourage busi-
nesses to borrow additional funds, however, interest rates must fall.
Figure 11.3 illustrates the process of a fall in interest rates with a simple supply 
and demand diagram showing an increase in the supply of money. The horizontal 
axis measures the quantity of money in the system, where money is defined to be 
cash, checking accounts, and other easily spendable assets such as money market 
accounts that allow check writing. The easier it is to spend an asset, the more liquid 
it is considered to be. Cash is the most liquid asset, while checking accounts are 
slightly less so, but still highly liquid compared to, say, stocks or bonds.
The supply curve is represented with a vertical line instead of the more common 
upward sloping supply curve because we are assuming that the central bank fixes 
the quantity of money at a given level, and that the quantity does not vary with 
the level of interest rates, measured on the vertical axis. The interest rate can be 
considered similar to the price of money. There are two reasons for this: It is the 
price you pay to borrow money, and it is the opportunity cost of holding your assets

in the form of money instead of some other, interest-earning, form. This is admit-
tedly a simplification, since borrowing costs and the return on savings are always 
different, and since some types of money earn interest (for example, money market 
accounts). Still, it is a simplification that is useful and one that captures the essen-
tial relationship between interest rates and the quantity of money in the economy.
The fall in interest rates shown in Figure 11.3 is the key to the increase in 
investment that comes about as a result of an expansionary monetary policy. Once 
investment increases, the expenditure multiplier takes over and the production-
income-spending cycle is set in motion. Hence, an increase in the money supply 
will expand the economy and increase incomes. Not surprisingly, monetary policy 
is also symmetrical with respect to its contractionary and expansionary impacts, so 
a decrease in the money supply will result in a decline in production and incomes.
Expansionary monetary policy involves an increase in the money supply and 
a fall in interest rates, leading to a positive expansion in income. Contractionary 
monetary policy is exactly the reverse, and involves a decrease in the money sup-
ply and a rise in interest rates, leading to a contraction in income. As with fiscal 
policies, both expansionary and contractionary monetary policies work through 
the multiplier process to raise or lower income, depending on whether the policy 
is expansionary or contractionary.

Fiscal and Monetary Policy  
during the Great Depression
The Great Depression is the name Americans give to the worst economic 
period in modern American history. It was a worldwide phenomenon, how-
ever, and most countries experienced recessions which, in many cases, were 
quite severe. The onset of the crisis varied from country to country, but in the 
United States, it started in August 1929, with an unnoticed modest decline in 
economic activity. Stock prices continued to rise through the summer of 1929, 
in spite of the overall decline in output and income. September and October 
were bad months for the market, culminating in the panic of Black Thursday on 
October 24, when the market fell by more than one-third. Most people thought 
that the worst was over and many argued that the stock market collapse was 
good for the economy since it squeezed out excess speculation.
The small recession that began during the summer of 1929 grew into one of 
the worst decades in American history. By 1933, over 25 percent of the labor 
force was unemployed and real GDP had fallen by nearly 26 percent. Out of 
the cauldron of the Great Depression came Social Security, the Fair Labor 
Standards Act to regulate working conditions and wages, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission to oversee stock trading, the Federal Deposit Insurance

Corporation to protect bank deposits, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and a 
host of other programs that inserted the federal government much deeper into 
American economic life.
Most Americans probably think of the 1930s and the Great Depression as 
synonymous, but there were two separate recessions in the United States dur-
ing the decade. The first, and most severe, one began in 1929 and lasted until 
1933. The second one began in 1937 and lasted into 1938. Between these two 
downturns in economic activity, there was a strong recovery, and by 1936, real 
GDP was above where it had been in 1929, the last year of overall positive 
growth until 1934. Figure 11.4 illustrates the annual rate of growth, 1930–1941.
In hindsight, it is easy to see the policy mistakes that prolonged the reces-
sion and made it far more severe than it needed to be. Based on what we know 
today about expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, the federal government 
should have done one or more of the following: raise government spending for 
goods and services, cut taxes, or increase the money supply to lower interest 
rates. The problem in the 1930s was that no one was aware of the relations 
discussed in this chapter. In a very real sense, if you read the first part of this 
chapter, then you know more about fiscal policy than presidents Roosevelt and 
Hoover and all of their advisers knew.
Instead of using increases in government spending and cuts in taxes to stimu-
late the economy, presidents Hoover (1929–1933) and Roosevelt (1933–1945) 
worried about the federal budget deficits that emerged during the 1930s. Both 
Roosevelt and Hoover thought that budget deficits undermined business con-
fidence and were a major reason for the recession. Consequently, the budget 
deficit became a major issue of the 1932 presidential election, in which Roo-
sevelt successfully campaigned on the platform of a balanced federal budget. 
As it turned out, however, the federal budget was in deficit during every year 
of Roosevelt’s presidency.
Both Hoover and Roosevelt tried to balance the budget. Both presidents 
unsuccessfully opposed legislation to offer war veterans early payment of the

retirement money they were owed, and both presidents supported tax increases 
when deficits began to appear after 1929. Hoover introduced a dramatic tax 
increase in 1932, while Roosevelt increased taxes at several points in time, 
most dramatically with the beginning of social security taxes in 1937. Given 
the contractionary impact of tax increases, it is not surprising that 1932 was the 
worst year of the depression, nor that the economy slipped back into recession 
in 1938 after the implementation of the new social security tax.
If fiscal policy was not helpful during the 1930s, monetary policy was a disaster 
in the early years. Between 1929 and 1933, the money supply (currency, check-
ing accounts, and savings deposits) fell by nearly 31 percent. Credit became 
scarce and investment disappeared. In other words, if fiscal policy could be con-
sidered more or less neutral during most years of the Great Depression (neither 
expansionary nor contractionary), then monetary policy was contractionary.
In retrospect, it is easy to understand the failure to use expansionary fiscal 
policy. No one in the 1930s understood the macroeconomy well enough to dis-
cern how to use fiscal policy to fight the recession. It is more difficult to justify 
the misuse of monetary policy, however, because more was known about the 
relationships between the money supply, bank reserves, and investment. For 
many years after the Great Depression, prominent economists such as Nobel 
Prize winner Milton Friedman argued that the Federal Reserve was simply 
incompetent. This view cannot be ruled out, but more recent scholarship has 
shed new light on this historic episode. Rather than incompetence, the Fed’s 
actions reflected a different set of priorities. In particular, it may have been 
acting responsibly if its first priority was to protect the gold standard.
Under the rules of the gold standard, central banks are required to use inter-
est rates and monetary policy to attract gold whenever gold reserves run low. 
This usually means an interest rate hike in order to increase the demand for the 
domestic currency and to reduce the demand for foreign currencies.
In 1928, U.S. monetary policy turned contractionary as the Fed was worried 
about speculation in the stock market and wanted to make it more difficult for 
brokers to borrow from banks. The Fed raised interest rates and, unintention-
ally, created an inflow of gold to the United States. U.S. policy put pressure 
on European countries, which began to lose their gold reserves. Consequently, 
the contractionary policy in the United States spread across the Atlantic as 
countries began to raise their interest rates and slow their rate of money growth 
in order to stop the outflow of gold. The irony is that each country was acting 
responsibly according to the dictates of the gold standard, but they were fol-
lowing polices that resulted in a worldwide economic catastrophe.
At several points during the years that followed, U.S. and foreign policies 
turned even more contractionary. In 1931, it was widely expected that the 
United Kingdom would leave the gold standard altogether, and speculation 
turned against the pound. In September 1931, Britain left the gold standard 
and speculators immediately shifted their attention to the dollar. Expecting a

CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCES REVISITED
LO 11.3	 Analyze the effects of fiscal and monetary policies on the current 
account and the exchange rate.
Chapter 9 described the identity between private savings, government budget 
balances, investment, and the current account as follows: The identity between 
private savings, government budget balances, investment, and the current account 
is described as follows:
S + (T - G) = I + CA.
Now we are ready to look more closely at this identity and to incorporate the 
links among monetary and fiscal policies, income, and the current account. The 
goal is to analyze how a change in income caused by a change in monetary or fiscal 
policy influences the country’s current account. We will do this in two steps. In the 
first step we will explore the links between changes in monetary and fiscal policies, 
interest rates, and exchange rates. The link from monetary policy to interest rates has 
already been described, but as we will see, fiscal policies have interest rate effects as 
well. In the second step we will put together policy changes, interest rates, exchange 
rates, and the current account balance. Once we have done this, we will have a 
much clearer understanding of the policies that a country must follow if it needs to 
eliminate a trade imbalance in its current account.
It is important to emphasize that we are looking at changes in income and 
other macroeconomic variables that are likely to take place over the span of a few 
years or less, while ignoring long-run impacts that may take many years, perhaps 
even a decade or longer, to materialize. We will return to this point later in the 
chapter when we try to distinguish long-run, permanent changes from short-run 
changes.
similar decline in the value of the dollar, they began to sell dollars and dollar-
denominated assets, all of which resulted in gold outflows. Once again, the Fed 
responded by raising interest rates in September and October 1931, and the 
U.S. economy continued its downward spiral.
It is no coincidence that the first countries to leave the gold standard (the 
United Kingdom and the countries that followed it in September 1931) were 
the first to experience recovery. Once their policies were freed from the con-
straint of supporting a fixed rate of exchange, they could turn them toward 
economic expansion. In the United States, Roosevelt’s first act after taking 
office in March 1933 was to suspend the gold standard. It seems unlikely that 
he completely understood the relationship of gold to the depression, but it was 
a good move, as the economy began its recovery from the worst economic crisis 
of the twentieth century.

Fiscal and Monetary Policies, Interest Rates, and 
Exchange Rates
From Chapter 10 and the interest parity condition, we know that interest rate 
increases lead to an appreciation of the domestic currency (the exchange rate, 
(R), falls) and interest rate decreases lead to a depreciation (the exchange 
rate rises). Recall that this occurs through changes in the demand and supply 
of foreign currency. As interest rates rise, they increase the supply of foreign 
currency since interest arbitrageurs are constantly searching for the highest 
possible rate of interest. Similarly, a decline in interest rates reduces the inflow 
of foreign financial capital, decreasing the supply of foreign currency. Demand 
side effects are present in both cases as well, since home country interest arbi-
trageurs have the same motivation to move their capital in and out of the 
country.
The exchange rate effects of monetary policy are easily identified. We have 
already seen how an expansion of the money supply increases bank reserves 
and pushes down interest rates. Consequently, in addition to increasing income, 
expansionary monetary policy must also cause a depreciation of the exchange 
rate. Given the symmetry between expansionary and contractionary policies, mon-
etary contraction reduces bank reserves and drives up interest rates, leading to an 
appreciation of the exchange rate.
Since a rapidly depreciating currency is a feature of most international 
financial crises, contractionary monetary policy is a very commonly adopted 
technique to stop a depreciation. This technique is discussed more fully in 
­Chapter 12, but it should be noted that the downside of using monetary policy 
this way is a contraction in income and possibly even a recession. This illustrates 
once again that it is not unusual for a trade-off to exist between a country’s 
exchange rate goal and its goals for income growth and employment. The Fed’s 
action to raise interest rates to protect the dollar in 1931 is a classic example of 
a conflict between the needs of the domestic economy and the desire to protect 
the exchange rate.
The interest rate effects of fiscal policy are less easily identified, but they are 
present nonetheless. The key to understanding these links lies in the behavior of 
households and the changes they make when their incomes rise or fall. Looking 
first at the case of a rise in household income, we know that consumption expen-
ditures will also rise. Furthermore—and this is key—rising incomes cause house-
holds to reevaluate the division of their assets between liquid forms such as money, 
and relatively less liquid forms such as stocks and bonds. When income rises, the 
average household will hold more money. In economic terms, the demand for 
money increases, as shown in Figure 11.5.
Why do households increase their demand for money when their incomes 
increase? The reasons are straightforward. First, at higher levels of income, they 
consume more. That is, they need a higher level of money holdings to pay for their 
purchases. Second, the opportunity cost of the interest they lose on holding money 

288
Part 3    International Finance
instead of an interest-paying asset becomes less burdensome. In other words, when 
households have more income, they can “afford” to hold more money.
Lest this seem too abstract and immaterial to your personal situation, think 
about what you might do if your income doubled. Most likely, you would increase 
the amount of money in your wallet and checking account. You would also probably 
put aside some of your increased income into long-term savings. The point is that 
if you are more or less average in your spending behavior, an increase in income 
would cause you to spend more and you would facilitate your increased spending 
by carrying around more cash and larger balances in your checking account.
Now we have all of the pieces to analyze the exchange rate effects of fiscal 
­policy. Expansionary fiscal policy will raise incomes and consumption. One out-
come of these effects is an increase in the demand for money, which, as shown in 
Figure 11.5, leads to higher interest rates. Given the relationship between interest 
rates and exchange rates, we know that higher interest rates, all else being equal, 
lead to an inflow of foreign capital and a fall in the exchange rate (an appreciation). 
As usual, the effects of contractionary policy are symmetrical. A cut in government 
spending or an increase in taxes will cause income and money demand to fall, fol-
lowed by a drop in interest rates and a rise in the exchange rate (depreciation).
Fiscal and Monetary Policy and the Current Account
Once the exchange rate effects of monetary and fiscal policies have been identi-
fied, it is relatively easy to describe their effects on the current account. As we will 
see, the effect of fiscal policy on the current account is definite, while the effect 
of monetary policy is ambiguous. We turn now to the analysis of these impacts.
Taking the case of expansionary monetary policy first, we have seen that an 
increase in the money supply reduces interest rates and causes a depreciation

in the domestic currency. Exchange rate depreciation switches some consumer 
spending from foreign goods (imports) to domestic goods, because foreign goods 
become relatively expensive. The effect of expenditure switching is to partially 
or completely offset the increase in imports caused by rising incomes. As a result, 
there is a more robust expansion of the domestic economy because less of the 
expansion of demand leaks out of the economy as an increase in imports. In 
other words, expansionary monetary policy is reinforced by the changes in the 
exchange rate.
Contractionary monetary policy has the opposite effect. Interest rates rise, 
causing an appreciation of the domestic currency, which makes imports relatively 
cheaper. As a consequence, consumers switch some of their expenditures away 
from domestic goods toward foreign ones. The reduction in demand for domes-
tic goods reinforces the impact of contractionary monetary policy on income, 
consumption, and investment, and leads to a more vigorous decline in economic 
activity than would occur in a closed economy.
To summarize, the impact of monetary policy on income is magnified by its 
exchange rate effects. We cannot definitely say, however, what the effects are on 
the current account balance because the income effect of monetary policy on the 
current account is the opposite of the exchange rate effect. The current account 
balance could rise or fall with either expansionary or contractionary policy. How-
ever, a key idea in the chain of causation is the notion of expenditure switch-
ing. This refers to switching back and forth between domestic and foreign goods, 
which, in this case, is in response to a change in the exchange rate. Expenditure 
switching magnifies the effects of monetary policy. Note, however, that this result 
depends on exchange rate flexibility. In an economy with a fixed exchange rate, 
changes in the money supply will not cause expenditure switching.
The effect of fiscal policy on the current account is more certain. As shown, 
expansionary fiscal policy increases interest rates, causing an exchange rate 
appreciation. Appreciation switches expenditures toward foreign goods because 
it makes them relatively cheaper, thereby increasing imports and reducing the 
current account balance. The expansionary fiscal policy leads to more imports, 
both from the rise in income and from exchange rate appreciation, which creates 
a feedback effect on domestic income. The shift in expenditures toward foreign 
goods offsets some of the increase in the demand for domestic goods and dimin-
ishes the impact of expansionary fiscal policy. Similarly, the exchange rate effect 
of contractionary fiscal policy switches expenditures away from foreign goods and 
toward domestic goods, diluting some of the contractionary effects of the policy.
The major short-run to medium-run effects of fiscal and monetary policy are 
summarized in Table 11.2. The differences between the two begin with their inter-
est rate effects and carry over to exchange rates and current accounts. In the 
case of monetary policy, changes in the exchange rate and income have offsetting 
effects on the current account; but with fiscal policy, changes in the exchange rate 
and income have reinforcing effects on the current account. As a result, the impact 
of monetary policy on the current account is indeterminate, while the impact of 
fiscal policy is definite.

290
Part 3    International Finance
The Long Run
How permanent are the effects? Economists more or less agree that in the long run, 
the level of output in an economy tends to fluctuate around a level that is consistent 
with full employment. Note that full employment does not mean that everyone has 
a job. No matter how strong the economy is, there is always some unemployment 
from the entry of new workers into the labor force, or the return of workers after 
an absence from work. While searching for their jobs, both groups are considered 
unemployed. In addition, there are always people who have voluntarily quit their 
jobs to look for better ones, and people who lack the job skills needed to find a job.
In a strong economy, unemployment may temporarily fall to a very low level, 
but this tends to resolve itself. Initially, employers may grab whoever is available 
to fill their job vacancies, but as the pool of the unemployed dries up, they raise 
wages and look for ways to get by with fewer workers. Ultimately, this returns 
the unemployment rate to its normal level. Conversely, in a weak economy unem-
ployed workers put downward pressure on wages, which ultimately resolves the 
problem of unemployment, since employers hire more workers when wages fall. 
The most controversial issue is how long these changes might take. Some observ-
ers believe they happen fast, while others are skeptical, particularly about the 
speed at which wages fall. In one sense, the debate over the amount of time it takes 
an economy to reach its long-run equilibrium at full employment is a debate over 
the meaning of the long run. Is it two years, five years, or ten?
 In Chapter 10, we saw that in the long run, purchasing power parity determines 
exchange rates. Fiscal and monetary policy may cause deviations from purchasing 
power parity, but in the long run, a combination of exchange rate changes and changes 
in domestic prices will restore balance to the purchasing power of national currencies.
The current account must also tend toward balance in the long run. No nation 
can run deficits forever, nor can it run surpluses forever. Since deficits are equiva-
lent to foreign borrowing and surpluses equivalent to foreign lending, there are 
limits in each direction. The limits are not well defined, however, and countries 
such as the United States have been able to run enormous deficits for long periods, 
while countries such as Japan have run surpluses.

Argentina and the Limits to  
Macroeconomic Policy
In 1900, Argentina was among the richest countries in the world. Its good fortune 
was not to last, however, and by mid-century its per capita income had fallen 
behind. Although it still had the highest per capita income in Latin America, the 
gap with Western Europe and North America was substantial, and it was not get-
ting smaller when it was hit by the Latin American debt crisis and the Lost Decade 
of the 1980s (see Chapter 15). The debt crisis was vicious and hard to shake off. In 
1989, seven years after it began, Argentina was still caught in it, and its GDP fell  
7 percent while inflation hit 3,080 percent. Politicians tried a variety of experiments 
to get out of the recession and hyperinflation, but none of them led to sustained 
growth or brought down the inflation rate. In 1991, a radical experiment was tried. 
The country fixed its currency to the dollar at a 1:1 rate and dramatically restricted 
the creation of new money. For every new Argentine peso put into circulation, the 
central bank was required to have a dollar to back it up, and a newly created cur-
rency board was there to oversee the exchange rate system and enforce the rules.
The currency board worked extremely well through most of the 1990s. 
Argentina was back on a strong growth path with low inflation and was widely 
viewed as a successful model for other countries. Problems began to develop 
in 1998, however, when the global fallout from a crisis in East Asia spread 
to Latin America. Argentina’s main trading partner, Brazil, devalued its cur-
rency in early 1999, giving Brazilian firms an advantage and putting Argentine 
firms at a disadvantage since goods valued in pesos were now more expensive. 
Argentina’s current account balance developed a relatively large deficit of  
4–5 percent of its GDP, and the loss of exports led to a recession in 1999.
At this point, conventional economic theory prescribed a demand-side 
stimulus for Argentina. Total expenditures in the economy were down, in part 
because it was more difficult to export, so the country should have cut taxes, 
raised government spending, increased the money supply, or some combina-
tion of those policies. There were a few obstacles, though. First, anything that 
might upset the 1:1 exchange rate was viewed as a potential problem. All else 
being equal, expansionary macroeconomic policies cause prices to rise, and it 
was feared that deliberately increased government deficits might undermine 
confidence in the anti-inflation commitment of the government. Argentina was 
already running a budget deficit that was hard to control, and increased spend-
ing and tax cuts were not an option. Monetary expansion was also out since that 
would undermine the peg to the dollar by increasing the circulation of pesos 
beyond the level of dollars available to back them up.
Second, a currency devaluation, whether intentional or not, would be a prob-
lem. During the growth years of the 1990s, Argentine firms and Argentina’s

Part 3    International Finance
government had borrowed dollars in international capital markets. There was 
nothing particularly unusual about Argentina’s borrowing, except that its abil-
ity to raise revenue to service its debts was constrained by domestic political 
factors. Taking on debt denominated in dollars is common, but it imposes a 
high price when there is a currency devaluation, since the dollar value of the 
debt does not change, but the domestic currency value of debt rises. Given 
that the government and most firms earned revenues in pesos, but that their 
international debts were in dollars, anything that caused the value of the peso 
to decline would increase the burden of debt.
The debate over policy was intense: Should Argentina devalue and increase 
the debt burden, or maintain the exchange rate and continue to watch the cur-
rent account deficit grow and the economy shrink? Cut government spending 
to create confidence in the fiscal soundness of the government, or use expan-
sionary fiscal policy to address the recession while undermining confidence in 
the government’s commitment to the 1:1 exchange rate? In effect, there were 
two choices. On the one hand, the government could use expansionary macro-
economic policies to try to combat the recession, but at the cost of a probable 
devaluation of the peso since no one would believe that it was still committed to 
anti-inflation policy and fiscal prudence. On the other hand, it could maintain the 
peso’s link to the dollar at the 1:1 ratio, but at the cost of ignoring the recession.
Argentina’s recession began in 1999. Two years later, in 2001, the country 
was still in recession, and prospects seemed to be getting worse. As people lost 
confidence in the government’s ability to maintain the 1:1 exchange rate, they 
decided that a devaluation was coming and began to take their money out of 
banks. After enormous losses in the banking sector, the government closed 
all banks in early December 2001. When they reopened in January 2002, the 
peso’s link to the dollar had been cut. The peso began a steady decline, drop-
ping from 1 peso per dollar to 2.0 pesos in February 2002, and 3.8 pesos per 
dollar by June. After that, it recovered slightly and stabilized around 3 pesos 
per dollar, where it remained for several years.
Some observers argue that Argentina should have sought more flexibility in 
its policies by severing the one-to-one relationship between the peso and the 
dollar much earlier—in 1997 or 1998. Others argue that it should have made 
deeper cuts in its budgets, because that was the only way to maintain confidence 
in its currency. At first, the government tried the latter approach, but political 
and institutional obstacles prevented the budget cuts from being large enough.
The Argentine case still poses questions for economists. Recessions caused 
by a decline in demand are most effectively fought by increasing demand 
through government spending, tax policy, or monetary policy. If a country 
needs to demonstrate to the world that it is fiscally prudent, however, because 
doing so will prevent speculation against its own currency and maintain the 
inflow of foreign currency, then expansionary macroeconomic policies may be 
impossible. Does this mean that developing countries cannot use expansionary 
macroeconomic policies?

MACRO POLICIES FOR CURRENT ACCOUNT IMBALANCES
LO 11.4	 Explain how expenditure switching and expenditure reducing policies 
can be used to reduce a current account deficit.
LO 11.5	 Draw a J-curve and use it to show how exchange rate depreciation 
does not lead to an immediate reduction in the current account deficit.
Fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies are essential tools for eliminating a 
current account imbalance. While any persistent imbalance can be portrayed as 
a problem, in practice the most dangerous imbalances are large current account 
deficits. Persistently large surpluses may bother a country’s trading partners, but 
they rarely threaten a national economy the way that large deficits sometimes do. 
The macro policies for addressing a current account deficit are a combination of 
fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies, often collectively called expenditure 
switching policies and expenditure reducing policies. Both are essential.
We have already seen one type of expenditure switching policy when we talked 
about the exchange rate effects of fiscal and monetary policy. In general, an appro-
priate expenditure switching policy for eliminating a current account deficit is one 
that turns domestic expenditures away from foreign-produced goods and toward 
domestic goods. As discussed, an exchange rate depreciation is one way to do this. 
Recall that a depreciation raises the domestic price of foreign goods. An alterna-
tive type of expenditure switching policy is a trade barrier, such as a temporary 
tariff to make foreign goods more expensive.
Expenditure reducing policies are simply contractionary fiscal or monetary poli-
cies that cut the overall level of demand in the economy. In most cases, they are nec-
essary along with expenditure switching policies because without overall expenditure 
reductions, inflation ensues as home country domestic expenditures switch away 
from foreign producers and toward domestic producers. For this reason, expendi-
ture switching policies must be accompanied by reductions in overall expenditures.
While expenditure shifts without expenditure reductions are inflationary, expen-
diture reductions without shifts toward domestic producers are ­recessionary. This 
makes the expenditure shifts necessary, since a shift in spending toward domestic 
producers offsets the decline in demand and leaves the economy with the same 
level of output but without a current account deficit. Given the need to use both 
types of policies simultaneously, expenditure reductions and expenditure shifts are 
not viewed as alternatives to each other but rather as two equally essential com-
ponents of a macroeconomic policy designed to address a current account deficit.
The Adjustment Process
The term adjustment process is used to describe changes in the trade deficit 
that are caused by a change in the exchange rate. We have already seen that a 
depreciation raises the real price of foreign goods, making domestic substitutes 
relatively more attractive. While this is an accurate description of the general 

294
Part 3    International Finance
pattern, depreciations often have delayed effects. In the United States, for exam-
ple, there is a median average lag of about nine and a half months between a 
change in the exchange rate and an impact on U.S. exports. The median average 
lag for import responses is slightly less, but still more than seven months. Con-
sequently, it is a mistake to think that exchange rate changes will affect trade 
flows overnight.
In addition to the lag effects, the first impact of a depreciation on the current 
account may be a further deterioration rather than an improvement. This dete-
rioration is known as the J-curve and is shown in Figure 11.6.
After a depreciation, there is usually a short period of no noticeable impact 
on the flow of goods and services. When imports and exports begin to respond, 
the immediate change is an increase in the value of imports, pushing the cur-
rent account balance deeper into deficit. The size of the deterioration and the 
length of time before there is an actual improvement varies from country to 
country. In the United States, a depreciation results in an improvement in the 
trade balance only after a year or more. The reasons are straightforward. A 
depreciation makes foreign goods immediately more expensive, but it takes 
time for households and businesses to find substitutes. In the short run they lack 
information, and it takes time to find new suppliers in the domestic economy, 
to check the quality of their products, and to negotiate contracts. Meanwhile, 
until the alternative suppliers are found, foreign goods continue to be used even 
though they cost more.

Initially, depreciations often cause the current account balance to deteriorate 
further. With time, substitutions of domestic goods for foreign goods lead to an 
improvement in the balance.

The Adjustment Process in the United States
Between 1981 and 1985, the U.S. current account balance moved from a small 
surplus to a deficit greater than 3 percent of GDP. In 1985, the Plaza Accord 
among the G5 (France, Germany, Japan, the United States, and the United 
Kingdom) created a cooperative effort to bring down the value of the dollar, 
partly as a means to shrink the U.S. current account deficit. The dollar started 
depreciating in early 1985, and from the first quarter of 1985 to the beginning 
of 1988, the dollar index fell nearly 37 percent.
While the dollar was falling, the trade deficit continued to widen. This was unset-
tling to a number of politicians, economists, and others, who had predicted a signifi-
cant decline in the U.S. trade deficit as a result of the depreciation. Some journalists 
and politicians began to argue that the trade deficit would never respond to a 
change in the value of the dollar, that foreign trade barriers would make it impos-
sible for the United States to substantially expand exports, and that our own open 
market would ensure a growing volume of imports regardless of the dollar’s value.
Nevertheless, after a little more than two years, the trade balance began to 
respond to the fall in the dollar. Figure 11.7 shows the change in the value of

the dollar and the current account balance over this time period. Figure 11.7 
offsets the current account balance by two years in order to reflect the long lag 
in the adjustment process so that 1985 on the graph is the 1987 current account 
balance and the 1985 exchange rate index. It is apparent that there is a striking 
similarity in their movement, once adjustment is made for the two-year lag.
The question that economists have debated since this episode is why it took 
so long for trade balances to respond to the decline in the value of the dollar. 
There are several possible explanations. One is that the prior increase in the 
dollar’s value had padded the profit margins of foreign producers. From 1980 
to 1985, their exports to the United States rose in terms of their domestic prices 
even though they sold in the United States for the same dollar prices. Con-
sequently, when the dollar began to fall, foreign producers were initially able 
to keep dollar prices constant and absorb the decline in its value by realizing 
lower profits in terms of their domestic currency.
Another possible reason for the long lag is that there were still impacts from 
earlier appreciations working through the system. A third reason for the long 
lag is that exports began to increase from a much lower base than imports and 
needed to increase much more rapidly in percentage terms in order for the 
trade deficit to begin to close.
MACROECONOMIC POLICY COORDINATION IN 
­DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
Coordination of macroeconomic policies is a frequent issue for the leading indus-
trial economies. The annual meetings of the old G8 (Canada, France, Germany, 
Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and the new 
G20 are often an extended discussion of shared macroeconomic issues, interna-
tional economic relations, and relations with developing countries. When global 
economic imbalances arise—for example, large U.S. current account deficits and 
growing Chinese surpluses—macroeconomic coordination becomes a topic of 
discussion. Actual coordination of macroeconomic policies is fairly rare, but not 
impossible. For example, the previous case study describes the agreement between 
five leading industrial economies to arrange a coordinated depreciation of the 
dollar, known as the Plaza Accord.
A variety of objectives are sought with macroeconomic policy coordination, 
from achieving a desirable level of world economic growth to avoiding a global 
economic crisis. The purpose of coordination is to avoid imposing a disproportion-
ate burden on one of the major world economies. Unequal burdens result when 
one country pays a large share of the costs of economic adjustment. As an illus-
tration, suppose that the world economy is in a period of relatively slow growth. 
Not every economy will experience this, but occasionally enough economies are 
in recession or growing so slowly that the average rate of growth throughout the 

Chapter 11    An Introduction to Open Economy Macroeconomics 
297
world is too slow to raise living standards or to pull people out of poverty. If a 
group of industrial economies decide jointly to expand their economies with fiscal 
and monetary policies, then growth in their incomes raises incomes around the 
world as their demand for imports stimulates production in other countries. If all 
economies expand simultaneously, then no country is burdened by a sudden excess 
of imports over exports—their exports grow along with their imports and with the 
growth in demand in their trading partners’ economies. For a variety of reasons, 
such as existing large budget deficits, or fear of the inflationary effects of expan-
sionary policy, some countries may choose not to expand their economies. In this 
case, the effectiveness of the expanding economies as engines of growth across the 
globe is reduced. Furthermore, the country or countries using expansionary policy 
will probably experience a deterioration in their current accounts since their trad-
ing partners are not growing at the same rate. If expansionary fiscal policies cause 
interest rates to rise, then a further deterioration in the current account is likely 
due to the appreciation of the currency resulting from the inflow of foreign capital.
The way out of this dilemma is a coordinated effort at macroeconomic expan-
sion. There are both political and economic problems with coordination, however. 
The political problem is that there is no international organization capable of 
arranging a multilateral agreement among nations, nor is one possible without a 
significant sacrifice of national sovereignty. The economic problem is that the only 
period in which nations find it in their own interest to pursue the same policies as 
their trading partners is when many countries face a similar crisis. For example, 
during the worldwide recession of 2007–2009, both the European Union and the 
United States implemented expansionary fiscal policies, and cooperation between 
the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank was extensive, 
even though it stopped short of a complete coordination of monetary policies.
Summary
■
■Households supply all the factors of production (land, labor, and capital) 
that businesses need to produce the nation’s output. In return, they receive 
all the income, or factor payments, which are payments for the use of their 
land (rents), labor (wages and salaries), and capital (dividends, profits, and 
interest). The income received by households is equivalent to the value of 
the output produced by businesses.
■
■Businesses use financial institutions to borrow household savings. They use 
the savings to invest. Businesses also produce the nation’s output. Govern-
ments spend on goods and services, using tax revenues from the income 
flow going to households. The foreign sector supplies imports and demands 
exports.
■
■Fiscal policies are government tax and expenditure policies. Monetary poli-
cies are for interest rates and the money supply. Expansionary policies raise 
GDP and national income, while contractionary policies do the opposite.

298
Part 3    International Finance
■
■Fiscal and monetary policies work by changing total demand. Fiscal policies 
either change government spending on goods and services, which is a direct 
change in demand, or they change household income through a change in 
taxes. This is an indirect change in total demand. Monetary policies work 
through a change in interest rates, which changes investment.
■
■The multiplier explains how an initial change in spending (demand) is mul-
tiplied through the economy into a larger change in spending.
■
■Fiscal policy is considered more difficult to implement than monetary policy 
because it requires Congress to pass legislation that must be signed by the 
president. Monetary policy is easier because it is conducted by the Federal 
Reserve.
■
■Both fiscal and monetary policy influence exchange rates and the current 
account balance. In each case, the effect is through a change in interest rates 
brought on by the fiscal or monetary policy. Neither policy is likely to have 
long-run effects on income.
■
■To reduce or eliminate a current account deficit, countries must practice 
expenditure switching and expenditure reducing policies. Expenditure 
switching policies turn demand away from the foreign sector and toward 
domestic production. Expenditure reducing policies cut back on the overall 
level of demand.
■
■The J-curve describes how a policy designed to eliminate a current account 
deficit may initially make it larger before reducing it. The lag between a 
depreciation and a reduction in the size of a current account deficit is one to 
two years in the United States.

INTRODUCTION: THE CHALLENGE  
TO FINANCIAL INTEGRATION
Increasing international economic integration has created opportunities for growth and 
development, but it has also made it easier for crises to spread from one country to 
another. The worldwide recession that began in 2008 was triggered by a financial crisis 
that started in 2007, and while it is perhaps the most severe example of a crisis since the 
1930s, there are several other recent examples. In 1992, before the advent of the euro, 
currency speculation against the British pound and other European currencies nearly 
caused the collapse of monetary arrangements in Europe and inflicted high costs on a 
number of countries in the European Union (EU). In late 1994, speculation against the 
Mexican peso led to its collapse and spread a “Tequila effect” through South America. 
In 1997, several East Asian economies were thrown into steep recession by a wave of 
sudden capital outflows, and in 1998, Russia’s default on its international debt sent 
shockwaves as far as Latin America.
Financial crises are not new, but the way they develop and spread continues to 
evolve with the world’s financial and economic integration. In some instances, they are 
an almost predictable result of inconsistent or unrealistic macroeconomic policies; but 
in other cases, countries with fundamentally sound macroeconomic policies have been 
pulled into a currency or financial crisis for no obvious reason. This makes financial

crises difficult to predict, but it also increases the value of a set of early warning 
indicators. The contagion effects of a crisis do not conform to a single pattern, 
and they reinforce the idea that there are different types of crises with their own 
rules of behavior.
Financial crises have brought down governments, ruined economies, and 
destroyed individual lives. Their enormous costs have created an intense amount 
of research into causes, prevention, and treatment. This chapter reviews some of 
the basic themes of this literature. It begins by describing two types of crises that 
have been observed during the last twenty years. Then it turns to a discussion of 
several key issues, including the steps that a country might take to avoid or mini-
mize a crisis, and the policy choices that it faces once one begins.
Much of the research in this area is designed to formulate sound principles for 
international financial reforms. The many reform proposals that have appeared 
in recent years are usually referred to as proposals for reform of the interna-
tional financial architecture. Often their contents revolve around a set of pro-
posed changes to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other multilateral 
institutions with a role in international financial relations. The final section of 
this chapter looks at two of the main questions in that discussion: Does the world 
economy need a lender of last resort, and what type of conditions should a lender 
impose on the recipients of its assistance?
DEFINITION OF A FINANCIAL CRISIS
LO 12.1	 Define three types of crises.
Financial crises have a variety of potential characteristics, but they usually involve 
an exchange rate crisis, a banking crisis, a debt crisis, or some combination of the 
three. Exchange rates, banking systems, and debt are not the only components, 
but in recent crises they have been points of vulnerability—partly because they 
are often the variables through which the contagion effects of a crisis are spread 
from one country to another, and between the financial system and the rest of 
the economy.
A banking crisis occurs when the banking system becomes unable to perform its 
normal lending functions, and some or all of a nation’s banks are threatened with 
insolvency. A bank, like any other business, is considered insolvent or bankrupt 
if its assets are less than its liabilities, or, to put it another way, if its net worth is 
negative. The recession that began in December 2007 is part of the fallout from a 
banking crisis that started earlier in the same year. A variety of financial institu-
tions, including banks, were involved.
The primary role of banks is intermediation between savers and borrowers. 
Simply put, banks and other financial institutions pool the savings of households 
and make them available to businesses that want to invest. If the businesses that 
borrow from a bank go under, then the bank cannot repay its depositors, and 
the bank may go out of business as well. Disintermediation occurs when banks 

302
Part 3    International Finance
are unable to act as intermediaries between savers and investors—it is a serious 
problem with negative economic consequences.
When a bank or other financial institution fails, the investors that purchased 
its financial products lose some or all of their savings. Bank depositors in many 
countries are covered by deposit insurance, but holders of other types of financial 
products rarely are. The loss of savings causes households to cut back on consump-
tion and spreads the recessionary effect wider and wider through the economy. 
This is one way in which a crisis is transmitted within an economy. Unaffected 
banks may stop making new loans as they take a cautious approach, new invest-
ment slows or stops altogether, layoffs occur, and the economy falls deeper into 
the vicious circle of a downward spiraling recession.
An exchange rate crisis is caused by a sudden and unexpected collapse in the 
value of a nation’s currency. This can happen under a fixed, flexible, or interme-
diate type of exchange rate. If the exchange rate system is some form of a fixed 
exchange rate, the crisis entails a loss of international reserves, followed by a 
sudden devaluation once it appears that the reserves will run out. Devaluation 
is intended to accumulate reserves or to conserve existing reserves by making 
the rate of exchange less favorable to people trying to convert their domestic 
currency to dollars or another international reserve currency. If a country uses 
some form of flexible exchange rate, an exchange rate crisis involves a rapid and 
uncontrolled depreciation of the currency. While no type of exchange rate system 
guarantees safety, current research favors the idea that countries that adopt a 
pegged exchange rate may be more vulnerable to an exchange rate crisis.
Similar to the effects of a banking crisis, an exchange rate crisis often results in 
a steep recession. There are several channels through which recessionary effects 
may be transmitted, but one of the most common channels is the banking system. 
For example, before the Asian crisis of 1997 and 1998, banks borrowed dollars 
in international capital markets. When their home country currencies collapsed, 
the dollar value of their debt increased enormously. Consequently, many banks 
failed, disintermediation took place, new investment stopped, and the economies 
slid into a deep recession.
A debt crisis occurs when debtors cannot pay and must restructure their debt. 
It is somewhat rare that debtors completely repudiate their debt, and in most 
cases restructuring involves lowering the rate of interest, lengthening the payback 
period, partial forgiveness, or some combination. Debtors can be public or private, 
or some combination, and the debt may be external or domestic. External debt 
refers to debt owed in a foreign currency, regardless of the nationality of the party 
that is owed repayment, while domestic debt is denominated in the home country’s 
currency. In addition, the rules governing external debt are set in a foreign legal 
system, while domestic debt uses the laws and courts of the home country. For 
example, China holds U.S. Treasury bills which are part of the debt of the U.S. 
government, but since the debt is denominated in dollars and subject to legal rules 
and adjudication in U.S. courts under U.S. law, it is considered domestic debt 
rather than external debt.

Chapter 12    International Financial Crises 
303
Restructuring of debt spreads losses through an economy and may cause pre-
viously solvent lenders to become insolvent since the value of the assets they 
own must be marked down. If their assets decline too much, they fall below their 
liabilities and the lender becomes insolvent. Debt crises can spread economic 
stagnation in other ways as well. In the 1990s, for example, Japanese firms and 
banks focused on paying off debt after the collapse of their real estate bubble in 
the late 1980s and early 1990s. This caused them to cut back on normal business 
spending and severely reduced the level of aggregate demand in the economy, 
leading to nearly a decade of stagnation. The euro crisis that began in 2011 has 
similar characteristics in that many businesses, including banks, are unwilling to 
lend and prefer to pay off the debts they accumulated after the collapse of the 
housing bubble and during the recession.
VULNERABILITIES, TRIGGERS, AND CONTAGION
LO 12.2	 Distinguish a crisis caused by economic imbalances from one caused by 
volatile capital flows.
It is safe to say that every international financial crisis is unique in its origins 
and in the way it causes domestic economies to unravel. It is also safe to say 
that crises may be unexpected, but they rarely occur without antecedent areas 
of vulnerabilities. Banking, exchange rate, and debt crises are more likely 
when there are underlying weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the economy. 
These weaknesses do not necessarily lead to a crisis, but they make economies 
vulnerable to events that can trigger a crisis. Crisis triggers, such as a bank 
failure, or sudden speculation against a currency, are usually unpredictable; 
for this reason, attempts to predict crises tend to focus on the points of vul-
nerability and the probability that those points might lead to the onset and 
spread of a crisis.
In this section, two main types of vulnerabilities are considered. These are 
not the only possible ones, but they cover a wide range of situations that have 
contributed to economic weaknesses and, on occasion, turned into domestic and 
international crises. The first type of vulnerability is a result of definite and iden-
tifiable macroeconomic imbalances. For this type, the moment of crisis onset is 
unpredictable, but unless the underlying conditions are corrected, it is almost 
certain to occur eventually. The second type of vulnerability is brought on by 
volatile flows of financial capital that move out of a country quickly. These capital 
outflows are often preceded by a period of capital inflows and a buildup of foreign 
liabilities. A sudden change in investor expectations may be a triggering factor, 
and underlying fragility in the banking and financial sector may be present. Still, 
this type of crisis can be puzzling because in several recent cases it has affected 
countries with particularly strong international positions and stable macroeco-
nomic policies.

Part 3    International Finance
Vulnerability: Economic Imbalances
Over the last few decades, a number of crises have been triggered by events that 
put severe pressure on existing macroeconomic imbalances. Macroeconomic 
imbalances can take various forms, including large budget deficits, large current 
account deficits, overvalued exchange rates, or unsustainable levels of private 
sector debt, such as in the housing market.
Historically, poor fiscal or monetary management have frequently played a role, 
as when governments allow large budget deficits or high rates of inflation. The need 
to finance budget deficits can make governments vulnerable to a change in the per-
ceptions of lenders about their probability of being repaid, and inflation with a fixed 
exchange rate creates vulnerability through a real appreciation of the currency and 
a loss of competitiveness (see Chapter 10). Not all crises are caused by poor fiscal or 
monetary management, however, and many crises originate in the private sector where 
imbalances are caused by speculation in real estate, the stock market, or other asset.
The global crisis that began in 2007 has exhibited several of these sources of 
crisis, depending on the country and the time period. Beginning with the rise 
of house prices in the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, and several 
other countries, private investors—including banks, insurance companies, pension 
funds, and individuals—had significant incentives to invest in real estate, driving 
prices to unsustainable levels. Investment was facilitated by global imbalances 
in which countries with high savings rates and large current account surpluses, 
such as China, Germany, and oil exporters, lent to the United States, the United 
Kingdom, Spain, and other countries with large current account deficits and sig-
nificant investment opportunities. The result was an unsustainable increase in 
house prices and a housing bubble in many cities. When house prices began to fall, 
it put pressure on financial systems in countries where large financial institutions 
were using the home-loans they made as collateral to borrow heavily in short-term 
credit markets. The failure of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers occurred 
when it was no longer able to obtain short-term credit after its lenders rejected its 
collateral, triggering the most intense period of the financial crisis.
The first phase of the 2007–2009 crisis involved macroeconomic imbalances in 
current accounts, and savings and investment. These imbalances were not due to 
government policies in most cases but were the result of private sector decisions 
regarding spending, saving, and investment. The second phase began as tax reve-
nues declined and social spending automatically increased as countries fell deeper 
into recession and government budgets came under pressure. During recessions, 
government income declines due to the fall in economic activity and the decline 
in income in the private economy. At the same time, income support programs, 
health care spending, and even pension expenditures rise unexpectedly as work-
ers are laid off, lose their employer-sponsored health care, and (sometimes) retire 
early. The fall in tax collections and the rise in social spending constitute an auto-
matic stabilizer since the changes are stimulatory and partially counteract the 
recession. Inevitably, however, they create a budget deficit, and in some cases the 
deficit becomes unsustainable.

The Latin American debt crisis (1982–1989) is an example of a crisis caused 
by unsustainable macroeconomic balances (see Chapter 15). In August, 1982, 
Mexico revealed that it was no longer able to service its external debt. This fol-
lowed a decade of large scale borrowing to finance budget deficits and devel-
opment ­projects. As the debt crisis spread to other Latin American economies, 
budget deficits, current account deficits, excessive money creation, and overvalued 
exchange rates added banking crises and exchange rate crises to the ongoing debt 
crisis. The crisis trigger in this case may have been the worldwide increase in inter-
est rates that began in the United States, but as more countries were revealed to 
be insolvent after nearly a decade of high levels of borrowing, the crisis spread. 
The Latin American debt crisis is a case of sovereign default, since it was default 
by sovereign governments. It is a particularly painful episode in Latin American 
economic history, and is discussed more fully in Chapter 15.
Vulnerability: Volatile Capital Flows
Not all crises are the result of macroeconomic imbalances or unsustainable expan-
sions in fiscal and monetary policies. National economies are increasingly vulnerable 
to the effects of technology that instantaneously shift vast sums of financial capital 
from one market to another. Together with the high degree of financial openness 
achieved in the last few decades, the contagion effects of crisis can spill across oceans 
and national borders. The best example of this kind of crisis is the one that hit some 
of the economies of East Asia in 1997 and 1998. While several economies had under-
lying weaknesses in their financial sectors, others such as Singapore, Hong Kong, 
and Taiwan were adversely affected, even without the same weaknesses.
The fundamental cause of this type of crisis is that financial capital is highly 
volatile, and technological advances have reinforced this volatility. The discovery 
of large emerging markets and the drive by financial investors in high-income 
countries to diversify their portfolios caused hundreds of billions of dollars to be 
invested throughout the world. Most savings stays in the country doing the sav-
ing, but an increasingly large volume of savings has entered international capital 
markets, where it moves relatively freely in response to interest rates, exchange 
rate expectations, and economic activity. This creates opportunities as well as 
problems. For example, portfolio managers often look at each other’s actions for 
information about the direction of the market. Capital inflows can be a sign of eco-
nomic strength and can generate more inflows, adding to the funds a country has 
to invest and generating more rapid growth. Capital outflows can also be a signal, 
however, and can intensify a small problem. What begins as a trickle of funds out 
of a country can be interpreted as bad news about underlying conditions and lead 
to an avalanche of capital flight. When that happens, international reserves disap-
pear, exchange rates tumble, and the financial sector can suddenly look very weak.
A weak financial sector can also intensify the problems. A case in point is a bank-
ing sector that borrows internationally and lends locally. If the funds obtained in the 
international market are short-term and are used to fund long-term loans such as 
real estate, problems arise when the international loans must be repaid. As long as 

306
Part 3    International Finance
international lenders are willing to roll over the debt and extend new loans, every-
thing moves along smoothly. As soon as the lenders believe that there is a problem 
with a borrowing bank, however, they refuse to roll over the debt, creating a liquidity 
problem if the bank’s assets are tied up in real estate loans. In the short run, real estate 
is relatively illiquid and cannot be used to make a payment. When a number of banks 
are confronted with similar problems, their attempt to unload real estate depresses 
prices even further and undermines the solvency of the banking system since every 
bank with real estate investments is suddenly holding a portfolio of declining value.
This type of scenario is particularly troubling because it can go either way. That 
is, it may resolve itself without a crisis if international lenders are willing to extend 
additional credit while banks sell their long-term assets. Alternatively, if interna-
tional investors expect a crisis and consequently are unwilling to give domestic 
banks the time they need to convert illiquid assets into liquid ones, then the crisis 
becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The belief in a crisis causes lenders to refuse to 
roll over the banking debts, and the banks, which are illiquid, become insolvent.
Several parts of this scenario are unsettling to economists and policymakers. 
First, there are multiple possible outcomes—or in economic terms, there are 
­multiple equilibria—depending on the responses of international lenders. Sec-
ond, one of the possible outcomes is a crisis, but the crisis is self-fulfilling. It is not 
predetermined, nor is it necessary. Third, the crisis affects banks that are funda-
mentally sound, but that have mismatches between the maturities of their debts 
and their assets. In other words, they are illiquid, but not insolvent.
These factors seem to imply that it should be possible to avoid this type of crisis. 
In part, it requires that banks pay closer attention to the maturity match between 
their debts and assets. In some cases, this requires a higher degree of supervision and 
regulation on the part of the banking authorities. International lenders, for their part, 
must be more informed about the activities of their borrowers. This requires greater 
information flows, the use of standard accounting practices, and overall greater trans-
parency in domestic and international financial systems. Finally, once a crisis occurs, 
international agencies, such as the IMF, that are called in to make emergency loans 
need to be able to distinguish between insolvency and illiquidity. The distinction is 
more complex than it seems, but it is crucial, since the appropriate response will vary 
depending on the short- to medium-run prospects of the borrowing country.
How Crises Become International: Contagion
Most crises are domestic. Banking crises, currency crises, and debt crises nearly 
always begin in a national context and only some of them become international. 
Many crises, however, spill into other countries, and even if they do not become 
a global crisis, they nevertheless affect more than just the country where it origi-
nates. For example, the Mexican exchange rate crisis of 1994–1995 (see case study 
below) caused an outflow of capital from many middle income countries and con-
tributed to a sharp recession in Argentina and other countries. Argentina recov-
ered relatively quickly, but the episode illustrates how problems in one place are 
easily transmitted to another.

Chapter 12    International Financial Crises 
307
Some crises are contagious, in ways that are similar to diseases. Direct linkages 
between economies can sometimes spread a crisis that begins in one economy and 
turn it into an international crisis. For example, the crisis that began in 2007 in the 
United States with a decline in housing prices, spread fairly easily into Europe 
and Japan. Banks in those regions had purchased assets that ultimately depended 
on housing prices in the United States and when they began to fall, the value of 
assets based on them declined as well. Suddenly, the problems of United States 
were also the problems of Europe and Japan, including insolvent banks that had 
purchased assets based on housing prices.
Banking or other financial linkages may not be visible or known until a crisis 
begins, but ultimately they will be exposed if the crisis persists or is deep enough. 
Other forms of contagion may be less easily observed. For example, countries 
with no obvious linkages to a country in crisis may become entangled if the crisis 
country serves as “wake up call” to international investors and speculators. ­During 
the Asian Crisis of 1997–1998 (see case study below) for example, speculators suc-
cessfully bet against Thailand’s currency and then turned to similar countries in 
the region where they assumed there were similar problems. In some cases, their 
bets paid off, but in others they lost, as when they speculated against currencies 
that were backed by large reserves and were not overvalued.
The subprime crisis was a good example of an international crisis that devel-
oped as a result of contagion, but not all international crises are spread that way. 
Frequently, two or more countries face similar financial crises because they share 
a common set of economic fundamentals. For example, a long and steep decline 
in the prices of agricultural and mineral outputs between 1928 and 1931 was one 
of the factors that set in motion and sustained the worldwide Great Depression 
of the 1930s. Countries or regions with large agricultural or mining sectors saw 
declining prices for key commodities that eventually resulted in bankruptcies and 
banking crises. In this case, the spread of the crisis internationally was through the 
common set of economic conditions that many countries shared and not the result 
of direct contagion from one country to another. When commodity prices began 
to fall, it had similar effects in many countries simultaneously.

The Mexican Peso Crisis of 1994 and 1995
The collapse of the Mexican peso and the ensuing crisis that began at the end 
of 1994 had elements of a crisis caused by macroeconomic imbalances and one 
caused by volatile capital flows and financial sector weakness. On the one hand, 
there were definite signs of macroeconomic imbalances, including an overval-
ued real exchange rate and a large current account deficit. On the other hand, 
the Mexican government operated a relatively austere fiscal policy, and not 
counting foreign interest payments on its debt, the government budget was in

surplus, not deficit. Similarly, inflation came down during the early 1990s and 
reached 7 percent overall in 1994, down from 22.7 percent in 1991. Between 
1990 and 1993, Mexico experienced capital inflows of $91 billion, or an average 
of about $23 billion per year, the most of any developing country. The capital 
inflow was in the form of private portfolio investments ($61 billion), direct 
investments ($16.6 billion), and bank loans ($13.4 billion).
The administration of President Salinas (1988–1994) actively encouraged 
large inflows of foreign capital as a way to maintain investment rates far above 
the level that domestic Mexican savings could support. Recall from Chapter 9 
the  macroeconomic identity that private savings plus the government budget 
balance must equal domestic investment plus the current account balance:
Sp + (T - G) = I + CA
In 1994, Mexican savings of around 14 percent of gross domestic product 
(GDP) could not support investment of more than 20 percent of GDP unless 
there was an inflow of savings from the rest of the world. Mexico ran large current 
account deficits equal to 5 percent of GDP in 1991 and 6.5 percent in 1992 and 
1993. The enormous inflow of foreign goods and services permitted more invest-
ment by providing capital goods that Mexico could not make itself, and by satisfy-
ing consumption through foreign goods and thereby allowing domestic factories to 
produce investment goods. This was the strategy of the Salinas government, and 
it seemed to be working. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) 
between Canada, the United States, and Mexico took effect on January 1, 1994, 
and throughout the year U.S.–Mexican trade expanded by almost one-fourth  
(23.7 percent). NAFTA inspired confidence in Mexico’s institutional stability and 
guaranteed access to the wealthy U.S. market for any goods made in Mexico.
During 1994, the world capital market began to shift toward a more conserva-
tive, risk-averse stance. In February 1994, interest rate movements in the United 
States and exchange rate movements around the world led to large losses for a 
number of banks and other investors. Portfolio managers began to reassess their 
investments and look for ways to reduce their exposure to risk. Political events 
also prompted investors to reassess their financial positions in Mexico. First, on 
January 1, 1994, at the moment NAFTA began implementation, subsistence farm-
ers in the poorest Mexican state of Chiapas revolted against the federal govern-
ment. Second, in March, the leading presidential candidate was assassinated while 
campaigning for office. While the lead-up to the signing and implementation of 
NAFTA had encouraged the view that Mexico was a safe, stable, and modern-
izing country, these events shocked investors into taking a closer look. Financial 
prudence seemed to call for reducing the level of exposure to Mexico, and many 
investors inside and outside the country sold their peso-denominated assets.
Less than three weeks after taking office in early December 1994, President 
Ernesto Zedillo finally agreed that the peso was overvalued and announced a  
15 percent devaluation, from around 3.5 to 4 pesos per dollar. Ordinarily this mea-
sure might have been interpreted as a cautious and responsible move to address 
the problem of an overvalued currency. Unfortunately, currency traders and 

Chapter 12    International Financial Crises 
309
economists had expected a 20 to 30 percent devaluation, and President Zedillo’s 
actions made it appear as if his administration did not understand the ­severity 
of the crisis. Consequently, rather than the calming effect he had hoped for, 
Zedillo’s announcement of a 15 percent devaluation sent currency and financial 
markets into even greater turmoil. More capital fled the country, dollar reserves 
shrank, and the credibility of Mexico’s exchange rate policies came under severe 
questioning.
Two days after announcing the devaluation, the government of Mexico 
announced that it would move to a floating exchange rate system. Although 
this was the right move, the damage had been done, and both foreign and 
domestic capital continued to leave the country. The currency continued to 
fall and by late December, it was over 5 pesos per dollar, and by the middle of 
March 1995, it was over 7 per dollar. This was a loss of more than 50 percent of 
its value compared to early December, 1994 (see Figure 12.1).
Zedillo addressed the short-run problems of the crisis by seeking financial 
support from the NAFTA partners and the IMF. Relief came in late January 
1995, in the form of a line of credit and loans. Within weeks, currency markets 
were calmed down and the rate of capital flight slowed as the holders of peso-
denominated assets began to relax in the knowledge that the government would 
be able to convert any amount of pesos to dollars. The peso regained some of 
its lost value, and by the end of April 1995, it was trading at six per dollar.

The medium- and long-run problems were addressed with a package of 
austerity measures that cut government spending, increased taxes (T up, G 
down), and reduced consumption. The large current account deficit at the end 
of 1994 increased the vulnerability of Mexico’s financial system to capital flight 
and had been partly responsible for the draining of dollar reserves. Expendi-
ture reduction policies were therefore an appropriate step taken to address 
the crisis, because tax increases and government expenditure cuts would help 
reduce the current account deficit. Electricity prices and gasoline prices were 
raised (both were supplied through government-owned enterprises), and credit 
was restricted through steep increases in interest rates and new limits on bank 
lending. These measures reduced consumption and boosted saving, provided 
a greater pool of domestic funds for investment purposes, and decreased the 
country’s dependence on foreign capital inflows. However, the fall in consump-
tion and government expenditures brought a recession; Mexico’s GDP fell by 
6.2 percent in 1995, and more than 500,000 people lost their jobs.
Analysts are still digesting the lessons of the peso collapse, but a few things 
stand out. For Mexico, the policy of relying on large foreign inflows of world 
savings through a large financial account surplus (current account deficit) 
proved to be unstable. Too much of the foreign capital was invested in short-
term portfolios rather than longer-term direct investment. This distribution 
is not inherently unsafe, but once the peso became overvalued, both foreign 
and domestic investors feared that a surprise devaluation would destroy the 
value of their assets, and they began to convert large numbers of pesos into 
dollars. In addition, the peso crisis demonstrated how hard it is to arrange an 
orderly devaluation in a crawling peg system. Mexico’s 15 percent devalua-
tion was a cautious step in the right direction, but instead of calming market 
fears, it undermined credibility in the exchange rate system. Since then, many 
economists have argued in favor of completely fixed exchange rates with no 
discretionary monetary policy, or a floating exchange rate like the one that 
Mexico has followed since the crisis.
DOMESTIC ISSUES IN CRISIS AVOIDANCE
LO 12.3	List and explain three measures countries can take to reduce their 
exposure to financial crises.
Not all crises are avoidable. Nevertheless, there are steps that countries can take 
to try to minimize the likelihood of crises and the damage they cause when they 
happen. In addition to the need to maintain credible and sustainable fiscal and 
monetary policies, governments must engage in active supervision and regulation 
of the financial system and provide timely information about key economic vari-
ables such as the central bank’s holding of international reserves.

Chapter 12    International Financial Crises 
311
In these areas, the design of effective policies is relatively straightforward, but 
in other areas there is a wide array of expert opinion, and consensus remains elu-
sive. Should countries bail out their banks if they fail, and what type of penalties 
should they impose if they do? Should they try to limit foreign capital inflows and 
outflows? Which type of exchange rate system is most stable? It is possible that 
in some areas there is no single optimal policy for avoiding a crisis and countries 
have a variety of equally viable options? In those cases, is it also possible that there 
are choices that are better for some countries, but not others, depending on the 
conditions inside the country?
Moral Hazard and Financial Sector Regulation
When a country’s financial sector becomes dysfunctional, problems spread to the 
rest of the economy. Credit dries up, investment disappears, households worry about 
their lost savings, consumption falls, and the economy slides into recession. Hence, 
there is a big incentive to keep the financial sector operational, even if it means that 
governments have to spend revenues in order to keep the sector in working order.
This creates a dilemma for policymakers, since the knowledge that you will be 
bailed out if you fail usually leads people, including bankers, to take greater risks. 
If the costs of failure are removed, the calculation of risks versus rewards changes 
for financial institutions. Riskier investments usually offer greater returns in order 
to compensate for the risk. If some of the risk is removed because there is the 
possibility of a bailout when there is a failure, then firms will take on more risk in 
anticipation of more rewards. This is the problem of moral hazard. Examples of 
moral hazards in everyday life include the financial incentive to avoid giving out 
information about a used car you are selling, or divulging negative information 
about your health when buying life insurance. In these cases, individuals are able 
to transfer the risk of buying a bad car or insuring an unhealthy person to some-
one else who will pay the costs. Similarly, bailouts of financial firms give them the 
opportunity to transfer their risk to governments or taxpayers.
The problem of moral hazard is inescapable if there is a general policy of 
protecting the financial system from collapse. There is general agreement that 
one key to eliminating moral hazard in financial institutions is to increase ­capital 
requirements in order to raise the level of capital available in time of crisis. Capital 
includes items such as shareholders’ equity, retained earnings, and bank reserves. 
Taken together they are the owners’ investment in the bank. Several interna-
tional agreements regulating bank capital levels, known collectively as the Basel 
Accords, have been signed, including Basel III, which was signed in 2010. In addi-
tion to tackling the problem of moral hazard, the Basel Accords also try to make 
banking systems more robust by setting new standards for bank supervision, infor-
mation disclosure, and stress tests. The latter are designed to tell a bank in advance 
where its weaknesses are by subjecting it to different types of hypothetical nega-
tive shocks. Since the most recent of the Basel Accords (Basel III) was signed in 
2010, it has not been tested by a new crisis, and there is disagreement as to its real 
effectiveness in helping to prevent another major financial crisis.

312
Part 3    International Finance
Exchange Rate Policy
Through the 1970s and 1980s, many countries adopted a crawling peg exchange 
rate system, often as part of an anti-inflation strategy. Recall from Chapter 10 that 
a crawling peg involves fixing the exchange rate to a major world currency such 
as the dollar or the euro, or to a basket of currencies that include the home coun-
try’s major trading partners. The “crawling” part of the exchange rate involves 
regular—often daily—devaluations of a fixed amount. Pegs are usually intended 
to stabilize the real exchange rate in a country with higher inflation than its trading 
partners. If domestic inflation is higher than foreign inflation, nominal devalua-
tion keeps the real exchange rate constant. Given the definition of the real rate as
Rr = Rn (P*/P),
then if the change in P (domestic prices) is greater than the change in P* (foreign 
prices), the nominal rate, Rn, must rise (devalue) in order to keep the real rate con-
stant. Maintaining the peg requires the monetary authority to exercise discipline 
in the creation of new money and is anti-inflationary in that sense. In addition, 
countries frequently try to reinforce the anti-inflation tendency of the crawling 
peg by intentionally devaluing at a slower pace than the difference between home 
and foreign inflation. This creates real appreciation in the exchange rate, and is 
intended to act as a brake on domestic inflation as foreign goods steadily became 
cheaper in real terms, limiting the price increases that domestic producers were 
able to impose. The use of the exchange rate in this manner has mixed success in 
helping control inflation, but in a number of cases it has led to severe overvaluation 
of the real exchange rate and increased the country’s vulnerability to a crisis.
Another way in which a crawling peg exchange rate system increases a ­country’s 
vulnerability to crisis is that it is sometimes politically difficult to exit from the 
system if it becomes overvalued. When a government announces a change in the 
system, it runs the risk of losing its credibility. Both domestic and foreign eco-
nomic agents accommodate the existing system, and a sudden large devaluation 
leads to economic losses and a loss of confidence in the country’s policymakers. 
Consequently, it is common for countries to delay addressing the problem of over-
valuation, and when the correction comes, it has to be larger. The end of Mexico’s 
crawling peg in 1994 is a good example.
Capital Controls
Many economists hold that the free movement of capital is a desirable objective 
because it allows investors to send their financial capital wherever the return is 
highest, thereby raising world welfare by putting financial capital to its most valu-
able use. At the same time, capital mobility allows countries to invest more than 
is possible with their domestic savings alone, which again raises world welfare 
when there are valuable investment projects and insufficient savings to realize 
them. Others, however, claim that the benefits of complete capital mobility are 
based on theory, but are never fully demonstrated empirically. In addition, capital 
mobility generates very high costs in the form of macroeconomic crises, and these 
costs must be offset against any economic gain.

Chapter 12    International Financial Crises 
313
This issue is unsettled, and although economists agree that trade in goods and 
services raises a country’s welfare, there is less agreement about the benefits of 
free capital movements. The sources of the disagreement not only cover the poten-
tial benefits of capital inflows versus the potential costs of sudden capital outflows, 
but also include debates over the actual ability of capital controls to prevent capi-
tal movements, whether controls on the movement of capital can stop a crisis once 
it begins, and whether it is better to limit inflows, outflows, or both.
Through much of the twentieth century, countries guarded against the problems 
of capital mobility by restricting its movement. This seems to imply that countries 
are able to prevent capital from crossing their borders, but what may have been 
true in 1970 is much more doubtful today. The growth of emerging stock markets 
and the implementation of technology to facilitate capital transfers have created 
both the incentive and the means for investors to send their capital abroad.
Ordinarily, capital flow restrictions are imposed by limiting transactions that 
are part of the financial account of the balance of payments. (See Chapter 9 for 
a discussion of the components of the balance of payments.) Capital movements 
to support transactions on the current account are usually permitted since they 
are necessary for trade. Consequently, one of the primary ways in which firms 
can get around capital account restrictions is to over-invoice imports. This allows 
them to make payments abroad that are larger than necessary for the purchase of 
imports. Alternatively, they can under-invoice exports so that the reported pay-
ments received are smaller than the actual payments, and the difference can be 
invested outside the country without reporting to authorities. While these tech-
niques are common, and perhaps fraudulent, outright corruption in the form of 
bribes is also a possibility for getting money out of the country.
Whether these types of practices make controls on capital outflows completely 
ineffective is open to debate, but they clearly reduce the effectiveness of capital con-
trols. For this reason, as a general rule, restrictions on inflows are seen as more work-
able than restrictions on outflows. Inflow restrictions can take a variety of forms, 
but they share the common goal of trying to reduce the inflow of volatile, short-run 
capital, which may add to the stock of liquid assets ready to flee the country.
Restrictions on capital inflows cannot stop a crisis once it begins, however. 
Consequently, there is an ongoing debate over the utility of imposing restrictions 
on capital outflows once a crisis starts. Since many crises include a speculative 
attack against the home country currency, some argue that a temporary limitation 
on capital outflows could help stop a crisis by artificially reducing the demand for 
foreign exchange. In theory, this would prop up the value of the domestic currency 
and eliminate expectations of a large decline in its value.
In the midst of the Asian crisis, Malaysia followed this policy in spite of a 
number of warnings that it would undermine investor confidence in Malaysian 
policies, cut them off from international capital markets, and do long-term dam-
age to the economy. None of the dire predictions materialized, however, and 
Malaysia recovered from the crisis at about the same speed as Korea, which went 
the other way and eliminated some of its controls on capital flows. The fact that 
two different policies led to more or less similar outcomes is a measure of how 
much we do not know.

C A S E  S T U D Y
The Asian Crisis of 1997 and 1998
The Asian financial crisis began in Thailand in July 1997. From there, it spread 
to a number of other countries, including Malaysia, the Philippines, ­Indonesia, 
and South Korea. The outward symptoms of the crisis were fairly similar across 
countries: currency speculation and steep depreciations, capital flight, and 
financial and industrial sector bankruptcies. It is tempting to interpret these 
symptoms as signs of the region’s weaknesses, but ironically, the causes are at 
least in part due to the region’s great strengths.
Vulnerability 1: Large Current Account Deficits
The most severely affected countries all had large trade deficits. Table 12.1 
shows current account deficits in 1996, the year before the crisis. For the five 
countries in the top panel, deficits averaged 5.2 percent of GDP in 1996. In 
Thailand, where the crisis began, the current account deficit was nearly 8 per-
cent of GDP. The three countries in the bottom panel of Table 12.1 all felt 
reverberations from the crisis in spite of their small deficits (Hong Kong) or 
large surpluses (Singapore and Taiwan).

Chapter 12    International Financial Crises 
315
Large current account deficits necessarily imply large financial account bor-
rowing, and the countries listed in the top half of Table 12.1 experienced large 
capital inflows. Foreign investors were more than willing to send their capital 
to East Asia, as the region had averaged about 5 percent growth per year in 
real GDP for the last thirty years, and there was no reason to believe that 
would change anytime soon. Furthermore, slow growth in Japan and Europe 
during much of the 1990s caused many international investors to scour the 
globe looking for higher returns, and the stable and dynamic economies of 
Southeast Asia stood out prominently. Low inflation, small budget deficits or 
consistent government surpluses, and the high rates of economic growth made 
them highly desirable places to invest and to loan funds.
Vulnerability 2: Overvalued Exchange Rates
Exchange rate policies in the region usually involved pegging to the dollar, so 
that as the dollar appreciated in the mid-1990s, it caused many exchange rates 
to appreciate along with it, resulting in a number of significant currency mis-
alignments. The pegged exchange rates became harder and harder to sustain, 
partly because they made it more difficult for the pegged countries to export. 
According to some observers, this problem was exacerbated by China’s devalu-
ation of its fixed exchange rate in 1994 and the significant depreciation of the 
Japanese yen throughout the period of dollar appreciation. The movements 
in these two currencies made the exports of Thailand and several others less 
competitive.
Vulnerability 3: Weak Financial Sectors
The downturn in export revenues exposed several other weaknesses, includ-
ing those in regulatory systems, corporate structures, and financial systems. 
Many countries in East Asia rely on corporate structures built around family 
ties and personal networks. This can have significant advantages for small and 
medium-size enterprises, but as firms grow, the lack of disclosure and transpar-
ency make it difficult for outside lenders to assess the microeconomic risks of 
lending. In addition, the lack of hard data and information make it difficult to 
implement the kinds of regulatory controls that all economies need for stabil-
ity, especially in the financial sector. For example, many banks experienced 
the kind of mismatches between the maturities of their assets and liabilities 
described as a serious vulnerability earlier in the chapter. These firms took out 
short-term loans in international capital markets and used the money to finance 
real estate developments with long and risky payoffs.
Crisis Trigger and Contagion
The existence of several vulnerabilities does not make a crisis inevitable but 
they do make them more likely. When a sudden and unexpected event puts

significant pressure on the vulnerable points, problems may develop. For exam-
ple, the drop in computer chip prices reduced Thailand’s export earnings and 
increased its current account deficit. That may have been manageable, but it 
also undermined investor confidence in Thailand’s ability to keep its exchange 
rate pegged to the dollar. People began to expect a devaluation and did not 
want to be holding the Thai baht when it came. Furthermore, many of the 
loans to the Thai financial sector were short-term loans obtained in interna-
tional capital markets, and required repayment in dollars. This raised the cost 
of a devaluation because Thai financial institutions earned revenue in baht, 
but owed a fixed amount of dollars. Any change in investor confidence could 
undermine the entire economy.
How the Thai crisis spread internationally is one of the less certain compo-
nents of the overall crisis. One hypothesis is that Thailand served as a “wake-up 
call” for investors to examine more closely their holdings in other countries. 
Another hypothesis is that the Thai devaluation made exports from several 
neighboring countries less competitive and forced them to engage in competi-
tive devaluations. Regardless, there was a contagion element in the Thai crisis, 
and it soon spread to countries as far away as Brazil and Russia.
Some of the consequences of the Asian crisis are easily visible in Table 12.2, 
which shows the growth rate of real GDP in 1998 and 1999. With the exceptions 
of Singapore and Taiwan, every country affected by the crisis experienced a 

Chapter 12    International Financial Crises 
317
recession in 1998. Given their large trade surpluses and their ample interna-
tional reserves, Singapore and Taiwan were able to focus on their domestic 
economies rather than trying to defend their currencies, thereby avoiding reces-
sions. By the second quarter of 1999, every country had returned to positive 
growth.
The rapid recoveries shown in Table 12.2 caught most analysts by surprise, 
yet the flexibility and fundamental soundness of macroeconomic policies 
throughout East Asia facilitated swift recovery. Still, Table 12.2 does not tell 
the whole story since poverty rose significantly throughout the region. In addi-
tion, many emerging markets observed the crisis and decided that the best way 
to prevent a similar one in their own economy is to accumulate large stocks of 
international reserve currencies. Since 2001, China and others have done so, 
using their exports and export promotion policies as a means to obtain foreign 
reserves. In many respects, this is perhaps the most lasting and important legacy 
of the Asian Crisis of 1997–1998.
Crisis Management
Three issues in crisis management remain unresolved after this episode. First, 
did the IMF make a mistake in advising the borrowing countries to defend their 
currencies with interest rate hikes? Second, were there moral hazard elements 
present, perhaps as a result of the Mexican bailout in 1995? Third, are capital 
controls helpful as a temporary measure to stem a crisis?
The first issue is a specific instance of the dilemma of fixed exchange rates. 
Should countries try to protect their domestic economies, or must they defend 
their currencies? For countries with large trade surpluses and ample interna-
tional reserves, defense of the domestic economy through lower interest rates 
seems feasible. The real question applies to the five countries with large current 
account deficits. Some critics of the IMF blame it for turning financial panics 
in those countries into full-blown depressions by counseling them to raise their 
interest rates. The critics charge that the IMF treated the crisis as if it were the 
same as the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s, in which governments had 
large budget deficits and high rates of inflation. In East Asia, governments were 
running surpluses or small deficits, so there was no need to temporarily con-
tract the economy with interest rate increases. Defenders of the IMF argue that 
­interest rate hikes were necessary as a means to stop the slide in currency values.
A second issue relates to the moral hazard of bailing out a bank or corpo-
ration. Some critics allege that the IMF loans to Mexico set a precedent that 
taught lenders that their mistakes would be covered by loans from the IMF, 
and consequently the Asian crisis became more likely. The counterargument 
is that “bailouts” are not really bailouts in the full sense of the word because 
they do not protect investors from losses. Most investors in East Asia saw siz-
able reductions in the values of their portfolios, so they have plenty of reason 
to exercise caution when lending.
(continued)

Part 3    International Finance
A final unresolved issue is the problem of capital flight. Can it be stopped, 
at least in the short term, with controls on capital outflows? As noted in the 
previous discussion on capital controls, Malaysia imposed restrictions on the 
outflow of capital and Korea did not, yet both recovered from the crisis rela-
tively quickly. In all likelihood, the optimal policy depends on a number of 
factors specific to each country. Further research is necessary to know which 
types of policies are most effective in which situations.
Domestic Policies for Crisis Management
It is relatively easy to prescribe a cure for financial crises that result from incon-
sistent macroeconomic policies. For example, if a crisis is triggered by a collapsing 
currency, which, in turn is the result of large government budget deficits financed 
by money expansion with a fixed or crawling peg exchange rate, then the prescrip-
tion is relatively straightforward in economic terms: Cut the deficit, raise interest 
rates to help defend the currency, and, perhaps, let the currency float. In other 
words, the solution to a fiscal crisis brought on by macroeconomic imbalances is 
to correct the imbalances.
The problem is that the economic austerity of budget cuts and higher interest 
rates may not be politically feasible. In addition, several economic problems are 
often present. Tax systems in many countries are unenforceable, meaning that tax 
increases may not generate more revenue. The adoption of a floating exchange 
rate system may undermine the credibility of the government’s commitment to 
fighting inflation, since financial sector interests often fear that it will remove the 
last bit of restraint over money creation and lead to hyperinflation. Governments 
may not be able to cut expenditures easily, since government employees may be 
unionized with multiyear contracts, may provide essential domestic services, or 
other elements of the budget may support powerful domestic interests.
The case of a crisis brought on by sudden capital flight in the context of rela-
tively stable and credible macroeconomic policies is even more difficult to resolve. 
Given that this type of crisis may have multiple equilibria outcomes, depending on 
the direction taken by expectations, there is a powerful argument for addressing 
the problem of a collapsing currency through interest rate hikes, sales of reserves, 
and other actions that might help convince investors that the currency is strong. 
On the other hand, high interest rates and other actions to defend the currency 
are likely to intensify bankruptcies and other contractionary forces that develop 
during a crisis. Hence, defending a currency may push a small downturn into a 
full-blown depression.
In crises caused by either macroeconomic imbalances or sudden capital flows, 
there is a strong desire to avoid a recession. In the first type, however, both fiscal 
and monetary policies are usually overextended, and the crisis is partly a result of 
policies that are unsustainable and overly expansionary. In effect, this forecloses 
fiscal and monetary policies as tools to avoid the contractionary aspects of the 
crisis, and the only way out is usually through some sort of recession.

Chapter 12    International Financial Crises 
319
In the second case, however, fiscal and monetary imbalances may not be part of 
the initial problem, so the use of fiscal and monetary policies is not entirely ruled 
out. Governments face a dilemma in this position, however, in that expansionary 
policies include a reduction in interest rates, which can cause a further deprecia-
tion in the domestic currency. If domestic firms have debts that are denominated 
in dollars or another foreign currency, a depreciation implies a sudden increase in 
the size of their debts and spreads additional bankruptcies through the economy.
In effect, this implies that fiscal and monetary policies are limited if there is 
an international component to the crisis. It also creates a stark set of choices for 
handling the crisis. Either defend the currency with high interest rates and spread 
the recessionary effects of the crisis, or defend the domestic economy against con-
traction and intensify the problems of a collapsing currency. Much of the debate 
over the policies recommended by the IMF during the Asian Crisis of 1997 and 
1998 (raise interest rates to try to stabilize the collapsing currencies) turned on 
precisely this point. Clearly, if there was an easy, nonrecessionary way to end a 
crisis, policymakers would use it.
REFORM OF THE INTERNATIONAL  
FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE
LO 12.4	 Explain the need for reforms in the architecture of international finance 
and international financial institutions.
LO 12.5	 Describe the main forces behind the global financial crisis that began 
in 2007.
The frequency of international financial crises coupled with their high costs has 
generated a great deal of interest in finding the right policies for avoiding a crisis 
and for handling one if it begins. Taken as a whole, the discussion of new inter-
national policies for crisis avoidance and management is referred to as reforming 
the international financial architecture. In particular, a lot of attention is focused 
on the role of the IMF and the conditions it imposes as part of its loan packages.
A number of ideas for reforming the international financial architecture have 
been advanced in recent years. Private think tanks such as the Council on ­Foreign 
Relations, the Overseas Development Council, and the Centre for Economic 
Policy and Research in London have each published proposals, as have multilat-
eral agencies such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 
(UNCTAD) and government-appointed bodies such as the International Finan-
cial Institutions Advisory Commission of the U.S. Congress. In the aftermath of 
the crisis of 2007–2009, reform is also a major topic of discussion at international 
meetings of finance ministers and country leaders.
The proposals for international financial reform express a variety of conflicting 
viewpoints, but they agree that two issues are at the center of the discussion. The 
first is the role of an international lender of last resort and the rules governing 

320
Part 3    International Finance
its lending practices. A second issue is the type of conditions that such a lender 
might impose on its borrowers. In effect, both of these issues are questions about 
the role of the IMF and its current practices.
A Lender of Last Resort
Recall from Chapter 2 that a lender of last resort is a source of loanable funds after 
all commercial sources of lending have disappeared. In a national economy, this 
role is usually filled by the central bank. In the international economy, it is filled 
by the IMF, often with the support of high-income economies such as Canada, 
the EU, Japan, the United States, and others. As a lender of last resort, the IMF 
is often asked to intervene when countries reach a crisis point in their finances 
and cannot make payment on their international loans, or cannot convert their 
domestic currency into dollars or another foreign currency due to an insufficiency 
of international reserves.
Not everyone agrees that there should be a lender of last resort, and some 
observers worry about the moral hazard problems of such lending. This is particu-
larly problematic as a crisis begins to develop and some firms are on the verge of 
collapse. The moral hazard problem can intensify since managers of failing firms 
have a large incentive to gamble on high-stakes, high-risk ventures that, if they pay 
off, will cover all their losses. In response, those who favor maintaining the IMF 
in its current role as an international lender of last resort stress the importance of 
financial sector regulation, including the elements outlined in the Basel Accords. 
If the owners of financial firms risk a substantial loss in the event of financial 
meltdown, they are less likely to take on excessive risk.
The final issue about the rules for IMF loans is the size of the loan. Countries 
pay a subscription, called a quota, to join the IMF. The size of the quota depends 
mainly on the size of the economy and its strength. The quota determines how 
much a country can borrow in a “normal” crisis, as well as how many votes the 
country has in setting IMF policy. Generally, countries can borrow up to 300 per-
cent of their quota, but in extraordinary circumstances such as the Mexican peso 
crisis, the Asian crisis, or other crises with the potential to spread, the limits on 
country borrowing are determined more or less by the needs at the time, as well 
as the amounts available directly from other governments.
Although some countries have borrowed sums that are well above 300 percent 
of their quota, the limits on borrowing have not kept up with the growth in the 
size of national economies. Some argue that borrowing limits should be greatly 
expanded, while others propose differentiating between crises that have a high 
probability of spreading and those contained within a single country. In many cases, 
it may not be possible to determine the difference, but systemwide crises definitely 
have the potential to impose greater costs. Hence, there is a clear rationale for 
intervening with larger sums if it will stop a crisis faster. This seems to be a point on 
which most countries agree. At the 2009 meeting of the twenty largest economies, 
called the G-20, there was an agreement to treble the resources available to the 
IMF from U.S. $250 billion to U.S. $750 billion, for a total increase of U.S. $500 

Chapter 12    International Financial Crises 
321
billion. In spite of its increased resources, however, the IMF has never had nor will 
it ever have sufficient funds to provide any more than moderate support for a large 
economy such as Italy or Spain. In the euro crisis that began in 2011 (unresolved as 
of this writing), the IMF partnered with the European Central Bank and a special 
fund created by the EU in order to assist some of the debtor countries.
Conditionality
The second issue surrounding the role of a lender of last resort such as the IMF is 
that of conditionality. IMF conditionality refers to the changes in economic policy 
that borrowing nations are required to make in order to receive IMF loans. Condi-
tionality typically covers monetary and fiscal policies, exchange rate policies, and 
structural policies affecting the financial sector, international trade, and public 
enterprises. The IMF makes its loans in tranches, or installments on the total 
loan, with each additional tranche of the loan dependent on the completion of a 
set of reform targets. For example, a loan recipient may be required to develop a 
plan for privatization in order to receive the first tranche, have a workable plan to 
receive the second tranche, begin implementation for the third tranche, and so on.
Often these types of reforms generate significant opposition since they seem 
to override national sovereignty and generally impose contractionary macroeco-
nomic policies. Some economists argue that conditionality requirements intensify 
the recessionary tendencies of a crisis, although there is a debate over whether 
countries recover faster with IMF assistance than without it. Until the early 1990s, 
the IMF focused its efforts on economic policy reforms in a way that more or less 
ignored their social consequences. Public outcry against the effects of condition-
ality on the vulnerable members of societies forced a closer look at the social 
impacts of policies, and the IMF has tried to make adjustments. Even so, there 
are still widespread complaints that IMF conditionality is too punitive and too 
contractionary, and a few countries in crisis have refused IMF assistance.
Before the 1970s, IMF conditionality focused primarily on correcting the imme-
diate source of the problem that led to a crisis, and it avoided involvement with 
underlying economic issues, such as trade policy and privatization. This approach 
was criticized as short-sighted, and it was agreed that the Fund should involve 
itself beyond short-run economic policy. New loan programs were developed to 
provide money and technical assistance to countries that needed help in restruc-
turing their economies. This shift involved the IMF in far more than crisis resolu-
tion, as it took on an active role in assisting in privatization, the design of social 
policies, trade policy reform, agricultural policies, environmental policies, and a 
number of other areas.
By the late 1990s, there was growing recognition that “mission creep” had 
become a problem and that the Fund had taken on responsibilities for which it 
is not suited, such as economic development in the long run. Economic develop-
ment issues are better left to the World Bank, regional development banks, or 
other multilateral agencies such as the UN Development Program or the UN 
Conference on Trade and Development. Several of the proposals for reforming 

322
Part 3    International Finance
the international financial architecture envision a reduced role for the IMF in 
this area.
Two additional issues are worth mentioning as part of the reforms of the interna-
tional financial architecture. First is the issue of a set of standards for transparency 
and data reporting in the financial sector. The purpose of greater transparency is 
to make a country’s financial standing clearer to potential lenders. The issue of 
transparency and data reporting is moving forward with the Basel Accords and 
the IMF’s standards for data reporting, called the data dissemination standards.
The second issue is the need to find ways to coordinate private sector involve-
ment in times of crisis. Less progress has been made on this issue than on the data 
dissemination issue, and it continues to be a serious concern. When a country 
reaches a crisis, the insistence by numerous private creditors that they be paid 
first can make it more difficult to resolve a crisis. Hence, proposals have been 
put forward for standstills, in which the IMF officially recognizes the need for a 
country in crisis to stop interest and principal repayments on its debt temporarily. 
This would also impose a burden on the country’s creditors and reduce the moral 
hazard element in their lending practices.
Conflict between private creditors over who deserves first repayment has often 
been an obstacle to resolving a crisis. Consequently, many analysts see the need 
for collective action clauses in all international bond loans. A collective action 
clause would require each lender to agree to a collective mediation between all 
lenders and the debtor in the event of a crisis. This prevents an uncooperative 
creditor from blocking a solution agreed to by a majority of the lenders. It would 
also promote a quicker resolution to a crisis caused by a borrowing country’s 
insolvency.
Reform Urgency
In the aftermath of the Asian crisis, many reform proposals were circulated among 
academics, government officials, and the staff of multilateral organizations. The 
crisis drove home the points that international financial flows had grown dra-
matically over the previous decades, that many developing countries are now 
active participants in world finance, and that contagion effects can instantaneously 
spread a crisis from one country or region to another. Reform, beginning with a 
reconsideration of the role of the IMF, was at the top of everyone’s agenda.
A decade after the Asian crisis began, the world was enveloped in a much 
broader and potentially deeper crisis. Yet, as the Asian crisis faded in memory, 
the urgency for reform diminished and not much had happened by the time 
the crisis in the U.S. housing market exploded in 2007. Reform is difficult, and 
without the urgency of a crisis it proved to be impossible. A relatively stable 
world economy after 1998, and the rise of issues such as terrorism, energy prices, 
climate change, and security, crowded out the issue of international financial 
reform. With the onset of a global financial crisis in 2007 and its conversion into 
a deep recession across most of the globe, the topic is once again timely and in 
the news.

C A SE  S T U D Y
The Global Crisis of 2007
The most recent financial crisis began in the United States in the fall of 2007. 
The first visible stage was called the subprime crisis in reference to housing loans 
made in the United States to borrowers with less-than-prime credit ratings. Many 
of these borrowers proved unable to manage the housing payments they had 
taken on, and many of the loans turned out to have clauses that made payment 
financially impossible for homeowners who could not refinance their loans within 
a year or two. When home prices started falling, refinancing became difficult or 
impossible for homeowners who now owed more than their houses were worth.
Problems in the housing sector quickly spread through the banking sector 
and into other parts of the financial services industry, such as insurance compa-
nies and investment banks, that had bought mortgage-backed assets. This would 
have posed serious problems for the United States under any circumstances, 
but at this stage the problem became global. Three critical factors or precondi-
tions turned a national, U.S. problem into a global one. First, the world’s finan-
cial markets had undergone a relatively steady transformation over several 
decades with the development of new and innovative financial products. The 
financial services industry of 2007 did not look at all like the industry it was 
in the 1960s or 1970s. Second, financial markets had become much more inte-
grated. Open capital markets and flexible exchange rates created new global 
flows of financial capital that were not possible in earlier decades. These larger 
and more integrated capital flows were augmented by high rates of savings in a 
number of emerging markets, such as China, that had played virtually no role 
in global finance before the 1980s or 1990s. Third, a spirit of deregulation had 
captured the thinking of many economists, politicians, and regulators. This 
permitted new forms of very risky finance to develop without close supervision, 
and without consideration for the fact that some of the new forms of finance 
posed risks not only for the individual financial institutions using them, but to 
the entire economic system as well.
By early 2008, the subprime crisis had spread beyond the United States. 
One of the causes of its rapid contagion was the high level of innovation that 
occurred over the previous several decades. In the 1970s and 1980s, banks 
accepted deposits, which they lent to borrowers who wanted to buy homes. 
Beginning in the 1980s and increasingly through the 1990s into the twenty-first 
century, banks and other “non-bank financial entities” such as car financing 
firms, consumer credit firms, insurance companies, and others began to enter 
the market. Their strategy was not to profit from the interest they earned on 
the home loans, but to group a large number of loans together and sell shares 
in the entire package. This is known as securitization. It can be done not only to 
(continued)

324
Part 3    International Finance
home loans but also to car loans, consumer credit loans, and a wide variety of 
other types of debt. If you buy a share in the securitized package, you receive 
a return based on the interest that the ultimate borrowers—home owners, car 
owners, credit card owners, and so on—pay to their lenders. The company 
that creates the securitized package of loans can, in turn, sell shares to another 
bank, a foreign-based insurance company, a foreign government, or virtually 
anyone willing and able to buy. Needless to say, if homeowners in the United 
States cannot pay what they owe, the owners of shares in the securitized pack-
age lose money.
The growing integration of global finance meant that these new products 
could be sold just about anywhere and finance crossed international bound-
aries with increasing ease. Pension funds in Wisconsin bought products that 
originated in Iceland, city governments in Germany bought securities based on 
Southern California real estate, and Hungarian home owners took out loans 
in Swiss francs from Swiss banks. Housing markets in many developed coun-
tries experienced a boom—finance was easy to obtain, prices were going up, 
and demand for new homes, either to live in or as investments, continued to 
increase. In the United States, home prices rose nearly 90 percent between 2000 
and 2006, and the U.K., Spain, and a number of other markets experienced 
increases as great or even greater. Increases in home prices fed on themselves 
as they pulled more finance into the housing market. The growing international 
integration of financial services meant that capital for home loans could be 
moved from one country to another, and that the United States, Spain, Ireland, 
and other locations where there were rapid increases in home prices could 
continue to borrow to purchase even more homes.
New innovations in financial products and the growing integration of capital 
markets challenged regulators to keep up. With the growth of computer mod-
eling and the application of advanced mathematics, many new financial prod-
ucts are complicated beyond nearly everyone’s ability to understand, including 
the regulators and the corporate heads and risk managers of the companies 
that created them. Few, if any, regulators in the United States or elsewhere 
expressed concern, however. As explained by Alan Greenspan, the ex- 
chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, most regulators were persuaded 
that financial firms would self-regulate since it is not in their interest to lend 
to someone who will default on his or her loan. His perspective reflected a 
much more general view that close regulation of financial markets was not in 
the national interest since regulators were likely to impose limits that reduced 
efficiency while favoring the objectives of the regulators over the interests of 
market participants. The thought that the global financial system was at risk 
was inconceivable to all but a few analysts. Almost no one believed that the 
most advanced countries of the world could stumble into a crisis that would 
lead to the near collapse of their economies.
Financial innovation, global financial integration, and financial deregulation 
can explain a lot of what happened. They do not tell us, however, why the crisis 

Chapter 12    International Financial Crises 
325
began in 2007 rather than earlier or later. As with many other crises, it is impos-
sible to pinpoint an event that triggered the onset. There is one more factor, 
however, that played a very significant role and without which it is unlikely that 
there would have been the housing boom or the crisis. This factor is the large 
global savings imbalances that built up in the world financial system over the 
course of the first decade of the twenty-first century. To explain this, we need 
to briefly return to the Asian crisis of 1997–1998.
The Asian crisis caused a reaction among many developing countries, both 
in Asia and elsewhere. The countries that suffered the greatest crisis were those 
that lacked sufficient dollars, euro, yen, and other international reserves to 
defend their national currencies. Their solution was to accumulate a large sup-
ply of international reserves by increasing their savings and running large cur-
rent account surpluses that they could use to purchase dollars, U.S. Treasury 
securities, and other secure, highly liquid financial assets. Large and important 
countries such as China began to increase their holdings of dollars, mostly in the 
form of short-term bonds, both government and private. Due to the sheer size 
of these accumulations, they began to play an important role in international 
finance. The savings held by governments are called sovereign wealth funds, 
but private entities also increased their savings.
Globally, current account balances must total to zero. If China and other 
countries run large current account surpluses in order to accumulate interna-
tional reserves, their balancing counterparts are large-deficit countries. The 
country with the largest current account deficit, both over time and in all recent 
years, is the United States. Table 12.3 shows the five largest surplus countries 
and the five largest deficit countries between 2000 and 2007. The first column 
of numbers is the surplus or deficit for 2007, while the second column is the 
cumulative surplus or deficit from 2000 through 2007. The table shows that 
there are mainly, but not only, two kinds of surplus countries: Asian exporters 
and oil producers. Germany is an outlier, but is also one of the world’s largest 
exporters. While five countries is not a lot to generalize from, the pattern holds, 
with some exceptions, if we look at all countries of the world together.
The importance of large imbalances is that they were a supply of savings 
that became available globally to countries such as the United States, where 
households and businesses wanted to borrow in order to maintain higher levels 
of current consumption and investment. Without the savings of China, Japan, 
Germany, and the others borrowing in the United States, the United Kingdom, 
Spain, and elsewhere would have been much more expensive countries to live 
in, and the bubble in housing markets would have been less likely. As a result, 
we probably would not have seen the boom in house prices, low interest rates, 
and the easy lending that took place in the high-deficit countries. Global imbal-
ances should be added to the other three elements that made the crisis possible. 
They all were important, but if we can consider innovation, integration, and 
regulation to be microeconomic factors, then global savings and investment 
imbalances were the primary macroeconomic factor.

Summary
■
■International financial crises are generally characterized by financial disin-
termediation in the crisis country, a collapsing currency value, and a steep 
recession.
■
■One type of crisis is caused by severe macroeconomic imbalances, such as 
large budget deficits, hyperinflation, overvalued real exchange rates, and 
large current account deficits.
The policy implications of the crisis will be analyzed and debated for years. 
Each of the elements described in this case study has generated a set of ques-
tions with multiple answers and no consensus. For example, financial inno-
vation has brought many benefits to economies by providing more sources 
of capital for investment and consumption and new mechanisms for insuring 
against risk. Yet, some new instruments may increase systemic risk if they are 
not carefully used. Is all financial innovation a good thing? Financial market 
regulation could, in theory, provide oversight, but what kind of regulation 
and by whom? Global financial integration has increased efficiency, but are 
all forms of integration equally desirable? These and other questions await a 
clear set of answers.

■
■Another type of crisis is the result of a speculative attack on a currency that 
prompts large outflows of financial capital and a run on the country’s inter-
national reserves. This type of crisis can be self-fulfilling because economic 
agents that believe an attack on the currency is imminent will abandon the 
currency, which is equivalent to an attack on the currency.
■
■The Mexican peso crisis of 1994–1995 had elements of both types of crises, 
as did the Asian crisis of 1997–1998. However, several countries in East Asia 
were subjected to speculative attacks on their currencies even though their 
underlying macroeconomic fundamentals were very strong.
■
■Responding to a crisis is complicated by the problem of moral hazard. If a 
government or the IMF bails out the banks and other firms hit by crisis, it 
may encourage future risky behavior. The problem of moral hazard is par-
ticularly acute if the government has directed credit to specific enterprises 
for political or developmental purposes because directed credit either explic-
itly or implicitly includes a government guarantee.
■
■The Basel Accords, including Basel III, are a set of recommendations for 
internationally active banks and financial enterprises. They cover the super-
vision and regulation of enterprises, minimum capital requirements, and 
standards for information disclosure.
■
■Many economists believe that crawling peg exchange rates make countries 
more vulnerable to a crisis because they become overvalued more easily 
and there is no smooth way to abandon them when a crisis begins to brew.
■
■Capital controls on capital outflows are generally viewed as ineffective in the 
long run, although there is some debate about their temporary efficacy in 
times of crisis. Capital controls on the inflow of short-term financial capital 
have more supporters, but there is no consensus on their efficacy in avoiding 
crisis. Some research shows that they can help a country avoid a small crisis, 
but are less effective at avoiding a large crisis.
■
■The optimal response to a crisis depends on its causes. If it is caused by 
macroeconomic imbalances, then changes in macroeconomic policies are 
essential. If it is caused by sudden, unexplained capital flight, then the opti-
mal response is less certain. Some economists, particularly those at the IMF, 
argue that stabilizing the currency with high interest rates will lead to a 
quicker recovery, even though this intensifies the contractionary elements 
of the crisis in the short run. Others favor expansionary fiscal and monetary 
policies to minimize the short-run effects of a recession.
■
■Reform of the international financial architecture includes a re-evaluation of 
the role of the IMF and other international agencies. A few favor abolishing 
the IMF as a lender of last resort, while most favor keeping it but reconsider-
ing some of its policies. In particular, questions have been raised about the 
interest rates it charges on its loans, the length of the loan period, and the 
limits on the size of loans.
■
■The most contentious element of IMF lending policies is conditionality. In 
particular, there is widespread agreement that the IMF tries to support too

many different types of reform and that it should refocus on its core com-
petencies, which include financial sector reform, balance of payments assis-
tance, and exchange rate policies. There is some discussion about whether it 
should require countries to prequalify before they are eligible for its lending 
programs.
■
■Other issues in the international financial reform discussion include stan-
dards for data dissemination and policies to create greater involvement of 
private creditors in working out the solutions to international financial crises 
when they occur.
■
■The crisis that began in 2007, had three microeconomic components and one 
macroeconomic one. Financial innovation, global financial integration, and a 
regulatory philosophy of “hands-off” or laissez faire each played a role. The 
primary macroeconomic cause was the presence of large global imbalances 
between high-savings and high-spending nations.

INTRODUCTION: A CHANGING WORLD ECONOMY
The relationship of the United States to the world economy is shaped by its size, its 
wealth, and its role as a military super power. It is endowed with a wide range of 
resources, including abundant and fertile farmland, a relatively well educated popu-
lation, and a disproportionate share of the world’s top research universities, Nobel 
Prize winners, and venture capital. It is the third most populous country after China 
and India, and has either the largest economy in the world, or the second largest after 
China, depending on how it is measured.
Throughout most of the post-World War II era, the United States used its size, 
wealth, and military power to foster a set of international economic relations that 
encouraged a multilateral approach to international trade and finance and economic 
support for low- and middle-income countries. It provided technical and military assis-
tance and engaged in direct military intervention when it was deemed necessary. With 
the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, 
the bipolar world of two superpowers and two economic systems suddenly disappeared.

Simultaneously, the global economic landscape was undergoing profound changes 
from the successes of middle-income emerging markets and the shift toward more 
open trade policies around the world. The transition to capitalism of formerly 
socialist economies; the worldwide preference for more open trade relations; and 
the economic success of countries from Botswana in Africa, to Chile in Latin 
America, to China in Asia are reshaping the world economy and the role of the 
United States.
BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
LO 13.1	 Identify major changes in U.S. economic relations that have led to 
bilateral and plurilateral agreements.
Given its large economy and population, U.S. trade with the rest of the world 
has been a smaller share of its gross domestic product (GDP) than in most other 
developed economies. Nevertheless, over the last fifty years, the trade share of 
GDP has more than tripled. Figure 13.1 shows the long ascent of the trade-to-GDP 
ratio as it climbed from under 10 percent in the 1960s to around 30 percent after 
2010. Within the long upward trend, there are several short-run downturns in the 
series, each of them during and after a recession (1974–1975, 1980–1982, 2001, 
2007–2009). Recessions cause a fall in imports due to the decline in income, and 
exports fall as well if other countries are also in recession.

Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
The top trading partners of the United States have not changed dramatically 
over the last several decades, with the major exception of China (Table 13.1). As 
recently as 1990, China was the eighth most important source of U.S. imports 
and the eighteenth most important market for U.S. exports. By 2007, it was the 
number one source of imports and the third most important export market. If the 
European Union (EU) is treated as one entity, then it moves into the second spot 
for both imports and exports, behind Canada (exports) and China (imports). The 
prominence of Canada and Mexico in Table 13.1 illustrates the relative impor-
tance of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) partners, not only 
today, but over time as well, as both countries have been among the top five U.S. 
trade partners for several decades.
The goods and services that make up U.S. trade have not changed much either, 
although services have become more important. In 1980, services were approxi-
mately 20 percent of U.S. exports, and now they are close to 30 percent and con-
tinue to show strength, not the least of which is that they are an area in which the 
United States has a trade surplus. About 40 percent of service exports are travel 
and transportation services, while the remaining 60 percent are royalties, edu-
cation, financial and insurance services, and business and professional services. 
Within the merchandise goods category (manufacturing, oil and minerals, and 
agricultural products), the United States is the world’s second largest exporter 
of goods (behind China), and about three-fourths of those exports are manufac-
tured goods, with the remaining one-fourth consisting of agricultural and mineral 
products, including oil and gas.
The Shifting Focus of U.S. Trade Relations
Throughout most of the post-World War II period, the United States was a strong 
supporter of multilateral trade opening as negotiated under the auspices of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) trade rounds and then under 
the World Trade Organization (WTO). Support for open capital markets was 
less prominent until the 1980s, when it became another goal of U.S. policy. These 
positions were reinforced by the Cold War and the U.S. desire to ensure that 
developing nations joined the alliance of capitalist, democratic nations or, at a 
minimum, did not form strong ties with the Soviet Union.

Manufacturing in the United States
In what year did the United States produce its highest output of ­manufactured 
goods? When a large group is asked this question, the guesses range from 
the 1960s to the 1990s. The correct answer is usually “Last year.” Figure 13.2 
i­llustrates this by plotting on the left scale the real value added in manufactur-
ing, 1950–2014. As the graph shows, there is a long-run upward trend in the 
value added of manufacturing output, which is interrupted by the occasional 
recession, most recently in 2007–2009.
The right scale shows manufacturing employment. Employment peaked in 
1979 at 19,426,000 and began a long-run decline after that. In 1980, the United 
States entered a mild recession and then a more severe one in 1981–1982. Man-
ufacturing employment recovered some of its losses in 1984 but continued its 
trend downward particularly after 2000.
Within the story of the growth of manufacturing output and manufactur-
ing employment decline, there are two additional stories not directly shown 
in the graph. First, there is the story of manufacturing relocation within 
the United States. Traditional industrial states in the north central part of the 
United States, such as Ohio and Michigan, have seen many jobs leave for other 
parts of the country. Some jobs have gone overseas, but quite a few have also 
gone to Southern states such as South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. When

Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
Several factors have caused shifts in this stance. First, multilateral trade nego-
tiations became more complicated as the GATT and then the WTO added new 
members. When the GATT was originally signed in 1947, it had twenty-three 
members, but by the time of the Uruguay Round (1986–1994), there were 128 
signatories to the GATT. Currently there are 162 member countries in the WTO. 
The increase in membership has dramatically complicated negotiations.
Second, many quotas have been converted to tariffs, and tariffs in general have 
fallen dramatically (see Figure 6.4). Consequently, the new multilateral trade 
negotiations in the Doha Round are focused on much more difficult issues such 
as agricultural support systems, intellectual property, services trade, government 
procurement, and assistance for developing countries. These areas pose significant 
challenges, in part because they are not easily represented as reciprocal openings. 
If all countries cut their tariffs by 5 or 10 percent, it is easy to see a mutual gain; 
but if all countries agree to enforce intellectual property rights on an equal basis, 
it is hard to see the immediate benefits for countries with little or no intellectual 
property to defend. In addition, many of these new areas of negotiation are con-
cerned with issues that are deeply embedded in national politics. For example, 
creating a level playing field in government procurement so that foreign firms can 
bid on contracts let by a national or sub-national government arouses resentment 
when domestic firms lose out in bidding to foreign ones.
Third, the end of the Cold War has removed one of the pressures that caused 
the United States to offer trade concessions to other countries. During the Cold 
War, the United States used access to its market as an incentive to keep countries 
from developing deeper ties to the Soviet Union. It frequently agreed to asym-
metric opening of its markets without demanding equal access to foreign markets 
when the country in question was perceived to have geostrategic value in the Cold 
War. The United States also used its systems of quotas to reward nations for their 
cooperation by allowing them to sell more in the United States, particularly in 
the textile and apparel sectors, but also in agriculture. The demise of the USSR 
removed this need to compromise or to offer asymmetric access to the U.S. market.
coupled with the overall decline in the total number of jobs, the plight of older 
manufacturing states has been grim. This has also contributed to the mistaken 
perception that the United States no longer has a vibrant manufacturing sec-
tor, but the story of Figure 13.2 is that the United States continues to produce 
a large and growing quantity of manufactured goods.
The second story is the rapid increase in productivity in the manufacturing 
sector. Fewer workers but more output means that each worker is producing 
more, and output per hour worked in manufacturing has increased at a very 
rapid rate. This has occurred in part through the application of new technolo-
gies and new processes, and while productivity growth speeds up and slows 
down, it is usually much more rapid in manufacturing than in services or agri-
culture. Hence, even as the United States produces more manufactured goods, 
fewer workers are involved.

Chapter 13    The United States in the World Economy  
337
These three factors have shifted the U.S. focus toward greater use of bilat-
eral and plurilateral trade agreements. The United States is still supportive of 
the WTO and officially welcomes a successful conclusion of the Doha Round of 
negotiations that began in 2001, but multilateral agreements are no longer the only 
or even necessarily the main option. The movement toward bilateral solutions 
began in earnest in 1993 with the signing of the NAFTA and its implementation 
on January 1, 1994. While valuable in its own right, NAFTA also served the pur-
pose of helping to push the multilateral system toward conclusion of the Uruguay 
Round of the GATT agreement by expanding trade policy to include bilateral 
agreements. This gave the United States additional leverage in multilateral nego-
tiations, as it signaled that there are options beyond the GATT/WTO framework. 
In addition, from the perspective of the United States and many other countries 
that have signed a growing number of trade agreements, working within a bilat-
eral or plurilateral framework entails easier negotiations than in the multilateral 
case and has the additional benefit of serving as a testing ground for new types of 
agreements. For example, the NAFTA agreement was the first to include labor 
and environmental standards.
The United States currently has free trade agreements (FTA) in force with 
twenty countries grouped into three strategic geographical regions: the Middle 
East and North Africa, the Pacific Basin, and the Americas. Most agreements are 
with small countries that account for a small share of U.S. merchandise trade, but 
Canada, Mexico, and Korea are major exceptions. Table 13.2 shows the agree-
ments in force, their dates of implementation, and the total amount of merchan-
dise goods traded in 2015.
The final two rows of Table 13.2 summarize size and relative importance of 
merchandise exports with free trade areas. Free Trade Agreement (FTA) coun-
tries are around 47 percent of U.S. exports and approximately 34 percent of 
imports. Proponents of FTAs make the argument that U.S. markets are relatively 
more open than many foreign markets. Given the relative openness of the U.S. 
market, bilateral and plurilateral FTAs that help open foreign markets promote 
U.S. exports relatively more than U.S. imports instead of causing a proportional 
increase in both. Consequently, U.S. exports to FTA partners are a larger share 
of total merchandise trade than U.S. imports from FTA partners.
This interpretation of Table 13.2 supports the idea that FTAs have been rela-
tively good for the U.S. insofar as they have helped to open foreign markets. Simi-
larly, many other countries have shifted toward signing bilateral and plurilateral 
agreements. Prior to 1990, twenty-seven FTAs were notified to the GATT. In 
the 1990s, another fifty-five were created, but since 2000, 217 agreements have 
been registered with the WTO. Some economists see the upsurge of bilateral and 
plurilateral agreements as one of the principal causes for the erosion of the Doha 
Round of the WTO, because they have diverted political attention toward bilat-
eral or regional concerns and away from global ones. Theoretically, FTAs can be 
“stumbling blocks” that detract from multilateral agreements or “building blocks” 
that create more trade than they divert and that enable countries to try new types 
of agreements. The WTO has concluded that in practice, most are complementary 
to the multilateral trading system and not substitutes for it.

THE NAFTA MODEL
LO 13.2	 Evaluate the relative importance of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, both for what it accomplished and as a model for 
subsequent agreements.
LO 13.3	 Explain when purchasing power parity estimates of income per person 
are superior to the alternatives, and when they are inferior.
LO 13.4	 State the reasons why Mexico and Canada sought free trade with the 
United States.
Table 13.2 does not single out trade flows between the three NAFTA countries. Nev-
ertheless, United States trade with Mexico and Canada, is a very large and important 
part of the country’s overall trade, constituting 27 percent of U.S. exports and 24 
percent of imports. Given NAFTA’s importance, both in terms of the volume of 
trade and as a model that set the pattern for subsequent trade agreements, it is useful 
to look at it in more detail. We begin with some background on Canada and Mexico.

purchasing power parity (PPP). The PPP adjustment enables us to know internal 
purchasing power, which is defined as the amount an average income can buy 
inside the country where the income is earned when it is measured in terms of the 
cost of a similar basket in the United States. Income per capita at market exchange 
rates is the external purchasing power of an average income. The differences 
between internal and external purchasing power are more easily understood with 
an example. Looking at Table 13.3, an average Mexican income can buy goods 
and services in Mexico that would have a value of $17,534 in the United States. 
This is the internal purchasing power of an average Mexican income. The external 
purchasing power is $9,009, which is the value of the goods and services an aver-
age income can buy if it is spent in the United States. The numbers tell us that on 
average, goods and services cost more in the United States than in Mexico. The 
PPP concept adjusts for that fact and lets us make international comparisons of 
income based on similarly priced baskets of goods and services.
The PPP adjustment is necessary in order to compare actual living standards, 
while the market exchange rates income is useful to know something about the 
ability of people to buy goods and services in the world economy. The two num-
bers are not equal because exchange rates are rarely in long-run equilibrium and 
because non-traded goods vary in price across national boundaries. For example, 
labor-intensive goods and services are inherently less expensive in Mexico where 
there is a relatively abundant supply of unskilled and semi-skilled labor.
As shown in Table 13.3, the NAFTA region has more than 484 million people 
(2015) and over $20 trillion in combined GDP. This makes it slightly smaller in 
population than the 28 nations and 507 million people that make up the EU, and 
slightly larger than the EU’s estimated 2015 combined GDP of US $16.2 trillion. 
With an average NAFTA-region GDP per capita (at market exchange rates) of 
over $42,000, it is a wealthy region by any standard.
Canada–U.S. Trade Relations
The United States and Canada have the largest bilateral trade relationship of any 
two countries in the world, with two-way merchandise goods and services trade in 
2015 of more than $671 billion. This large sum is due to a shared border, a common

historical background, and a similar culture, but it is also the result of three stages of 
integration over the last four and one-half decades. Beginning with the Auto Pact 
of 1965, followed by the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (CUSTA) in 1989, 
and the NAFTA agreement in 1994, Canada and the United States have taken 
advantage of their proximity to foster a set of mutually beneficial trade ties that 
focus on natural resources and intra-industry trade, particularly in the auto sector.
The Auto Pact of 1965 removed barriers to trade that previously forced the 
major U.S. firms to set up separate plants in Canada where they were unable to 
capture the full economies of scale essential to the car industry. By combining 
their production in the United States with their Canadian plants, General Motors, 
Chrysler, and Ford were able to produce for a single combined market. Before the 
agreement, Canadian plants produced solely for the Canadian market; after the 
agreement was implemented, they were suddenly more productive, as they could 
specialize in particular car models and increase their production runs to serve both 
the United States and the Canadian markets. Trade in both directions increased 
substantially, and productivity levels in Canadian plants, which were 30 percent 
below U.S. levels, rose dramatically.
By the 1980s, the car industry was integrated, but several new problems became 
apparent. Both the United States and Canada began to feel the rise of emerging 
markets in Asia, and Japan’s inroads into the U.S. auto market, steel, and con-
sumer electronics were troubling as this seemed to indicate a loss of competitive-
ness in many U.S. and Canadian firms. Furthermore, the United States began to 
use antidumping and countervailing duties more often along with a new set of 
quotas administered under voluntary export restraint (VER) agreements. The 
latter were not voluntary in practice but worked the same as quotas in limiting 
foreign imports to a set level. The most important affected industry was the Japa-
nese car market.
From the perspective of Canada’s leadership, growing U.S. protectionism and 
rising Asian manufacturing competitiveness were troubling signs because ­Canada 
is very dependent on the United States as an export market and as a source of 
imports. One solution to these pressures was to create FTA with the United 
States. This solution locked the United States into an international agreement 
that required it to keep its market open and, at the same time, put pressure on 
Canadian manufacturers to make changes to become more competitive.
The CUSTA was ratified in 1988 and implemented in 1989. CUSTA’s impacts 
were more or less as expected. Between 1989 and 1994, Canadian exports to the 
United States grew 55 percent ($47 billion increase), while U.S. exports to Canada 
grew 46.6 percent ($36.5 billion increase). In percentage terms this growth is not 
quite as rapid as the period before and after the implementation of the Auto Pact, 
but given that trade was already at a high level in 1987, a 50 percent increase rep-
resents an enormous volume of trade.
The debate over U.S.–Canadian free trade was low key and dispassionate in 
the United States. In Canada, however, a heated public discussion erupted when 
it was announced that the United States and Canada were negotiating an agree-
ment. The opponents of the trade agreement feared that (1) Canada might not be 

Chapter 13    The United States in the World Economy  
341
able to compete with U.S. firms, which had the advantages of economies of scale; 
(2) expanded trade might force Canada to jettison many of its social programs; and 
(3) Canadian culture might come to be dominated by the U.S. news, information, 
arts, and entertainment industries.
The issue of Canadian competitiveness was largely one about the need to gain 
economies of scale and to increase productivity through organizational or techno-
logical changes within firms. For the most part, the real issue for a high-income, 
industrialized country such as Canada is the length of time over which the changes 
can be expected to occur, and not whether firms are capable of competing.
The Canadian opponents of CUSTA also argued that it would erode Canada’s 
social programs. For many citizens, Canada’s more extensive social programs, 
such as universal health care and more developed income maintenance programs, 
are part of a national identity that make Canada unlike the United States. The 
opponents of CUSTA argued that the intensification of competition with the 
United States would undermine these social programs and dilute the difference 
between the two countries. They reasoned that social programs would be cut in 
order to reduce business taxes and make Canadian firms more competitive. Given 
that taxes are one component of business costs, and that in some cases, there are 
offsetting reductions in cost elsewhere, and it was incorrect to view a trade agree-
ment with the United States as a threat to social programs. In the case of health 
care, for example, it makes more sense to argue that the United States’ system is 
at a competitive disadvantage, because the cost of hiring workers is raised when 
they must be provided with health care benefits by their employer. In Canada, by 
contrast, health care coverage is universal and is paid for out of general govern-
ment revenues and individual taxes.
The final and most contentious issue from the Canadian point of view was the 
possibility of U.S. cultural domination. A very wide spectrum of opinion, includ-
ing both opponents and proponents of expanded free trade, argues that the com-
bination of Canada’s smaller population and its proximity to the United States 
will destroy its national identity if it allows completely free trade in the cultural 
industries. These industries include music in all of its venues, as well as radio, tele-
vision, newspapers, publishing, magazines, drama, cinema, and painting. Under 
the rules of CUSTA, Canada is allowed to protect its national identity by imposing 
quantitative restrictions on imports of “cultural products.” In most cases, the rules 
allow Canada to impose domestic content requirements on television, radio, and 
theater. For example, the content requirements make it illegal for a radio or TV 
station to play content originating in the United States twenty-four hours a day. 
Cable TV companies give preferences to Canadian-based TV networks, and there 
are national rules that favor Canadian theater companies, artists, and writers.
Mexican Economic Reforms
From the 1950s until the onset of a crisis in 1982, Mexican per capita growth aver-
aged 3.3 percent per year in real terms, an impressive record that doubled living 
standards approximately every generation. This long boom in Mexico’s growth 

342
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
occurred under a set of trade policies called import substitution industrialization 
(ISI) that target the development of manufacturing through support for industries 
that produce goods that substitute for imports. As the leading economic develop-
ment strategy throughout much of the world from the end of World War II until 
the mid-1980s, ISI policies prescribed industrial policies for goods production, 
beginning with simple consumer goods such as food and beverage, textiles and 
apparel, furniture, and footwear; and advancing through more complex consumer 
goods such as household appliances; and into industrial goods such as genera-
tors, pumps, and conveyors. This was to be followed by the development of more 
sophisticated industrial goods as countries moved up the ladder of comparative 
advantage, gaining manufacturing experience and changing their endowment of 
capital and labor skills. The tools employed by ISI policy included industrial sup-
port policies of tax breaks, low-interest loans, subsidies, occasional nationaliza-
tion, and high protectionist barriers.
A major weakness of ISI policies is that they discriminate against exports. They 
do this by raising the rate of return for firms that produce for the domestic market 
where they have high protectionist walls and can charge higher prices while facing 
little or no competition. This also hurt Mexico and other ISI economies in the long 
run because it reduced the incentive to innovate or make product improvements, 
given that there was limited competition. With higher rates of return in the pro-
duction of import substitutes, labor and capital were drawn out of the export sec-
tors and into production for the domestic market. Consequently, when a decade 
of poor macroeconomic management in the 1970s came to a head in the 1980s, 
Mexico found itself deeply in debt and with limited capacity to export.
The debt crisis that began in Mexico in August 1982 was the result of a series of 
factors. From Mexico, the debt crisis quickly spread to the rest of Latin America, 
where similar policies had resulted in poor macroeconomic management and the 
accumulation of a large amount of debt. This period came to be known as the 
Lost Decade and is discussed in more detail in Chapter 16 on Latin America. In 
Mexico, as in most countries, the underlying causes of the debt crisis were heavy 
borrowing from foreign banks, weak tax systems, and rising world interest rates 
that made debt service more expensive. Mexico had discovered new oil fields 
in the 1970s, and borrowing was encouraged by the belief that the price of oil 
would rise forever and along with it, the country’s ability to service ever-increasing 
amounts of debt. When oil prices began to fall in the early 1980s, the Mexican 
government’s oil revenue began to decline, just as its interest payments on the 
money it had borrowed were going up. These factors were intensified in their 
impacts on the Mexican economy by the fact that several decades of ISI policies 
had weakened the export sector (other than oil, which received special treatment). 
Weak export performance reduced the capacity to earn dollars that might be used 
to make payments on foreign debt. By August 1982, Mexico had exhausted its 
reserves of foreign currency and could no longer pay its debts. This triggered the 
onset of the debt crisis, which ultimately dragged on from 1982 until 1989.
The solution to the debt crisis required multiple policy changes. In the 1980s, 
Mexico privatized many firms that had been drains on the federal budget (938 

Chapter 13    The United States in the World Economy  
343
were privatized between 1982 and 1992), brought its federal budget under control, 
reduced its restrictions on foreign direct investment in the country, and began to 
open its market to greater competition. In 1986, Mexico joined the GATT and in 
1989, President Carlos Salinas proposed an FTA with the United States. Salinas 
had two goals in mind. First, he wanted to solidify his reforms in an international 
agreement. Before the political reforms that occurred in the late 1990s, Mexican 
presidents were granted extensive autonomy and authority. A more protectionist 
president could very well overturn the reforms that he and his predecessor (Miguel 
de la Madrid) had implemented; but if they were embedded in an international 
agreement, it would be much harder. Second, Salinas wanted to attract more for-
eign capital to increase the low domestic savings in Mexico. More foreign invest-
ment in Mexico would spur growth, while greater access to the large U.S. market 
would be an incentive for investors to build manufacturing plants in Mexico.
The North American Free Trade Agreement
NAFTA was ratified in 1993 and took effect on January 1, 1994. Trade flows 
increased significantly, but they had been growing before implementation, partly 
in anticipation of an agreement.
The first important feature of NAFTA is that most forms of trade barriers came 
down. Because the United States and Canada were relatively open economies with 
few trade barriers, most of the change came on the Mexican side. For example, 
between 1993 and 1996, average U.S. tariffs on Mexican goods fell from 2.07 to 
0.65 percent. By contrast, Mexican tariffs on U.S. goods fell from 10 to 2.9 percent. 
These reductions in tariffs under NAFTA were a continuation of the reduction in 
trade barriers that began in the mid-1980s. Between 1982 and 1992, the percentage 
of Mexico’s imports that required import licenses from the government declined 
from 100 to 11 percent, and tariffs fell from an average level of 27 to 13.1 percent. 
By 1994, Mexico’s economy was substantially open to the world.
Some tariffs and investment restrictions on each country’s cross border invest-
ment were eliminated immediately, but in many cases there was a variable period 
of phasing out tariffs and investment restrictions. The phase-out period for these 
remaining tariffs and investment restrictions varied from sector to sector. In cases 
where there was expected to be significant new competition, industries were given 
a longer period to prepare themselves because each country wants to avoid a sud-
den disruption of its economy even as it wants gains from trade.
A second feature of NAFTA is that it specifies North American content 
requirements for goods subject to free trade. To qualify for free trade or the 
reduced tariff provisions of the agreement, a specified percentage (usually 50 
percent) of the value of the good must be made in North America. The purpose 
of local content requirements is to prevent non-NAFTA countries from using low 
tariffs in one NAFTA country to gain access to all three. Most trade economists 
dislike these provisions because they increase the likelihood of trade diversion. 
Production of inputs in lower-cost, nonmember countries could be reduced if 
firms move their operations to NAFTA countries in order to meet the content 

344
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
requirements—as happened in the apparel industry, for example. Firms moved 
from the Caribbean to Mexico, even though Mexico was not the lowest-cost pro-
ducer. Mexico’s exports to the United States paid zero tariffs, so goods produced 
there could sell for less than goods produced in lower-cost countries and subject 
to high tariffs when entering the United States. Nevertheless, content require-
ments were politically necessary in order to pass the agreement in Canada and 
the United States.
A third feature of NAFTA is that it set up three separate dispute resolution 
mechanisms, depending on the source of the disagreement. Individual chapters 
cover disputes related to dumping and anti-dumping duties; treatment of foreign 
investors by national policies, called investor-state disputes; and a third dispute 
resolution mechanism for general disputes. Each of these areas is separate from 
the consultation mechanisms for disputes over labor and environmental standards, 
which are a fourth significant feature of the agreement. NAFTA itself did not 
contain language regarding labor and environmental standards or concerns, but 
two side agreements were ratified and implemented at the same time as the trade 
agreement. These are the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation and 
the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation. The labor and 
environmental side agreements, along with the investor-state dispute resolution 
mechanism, have served as frameworks for most of the subsequent FTAs negoti-
ated by the United States. Each of these has its supporters and its detractors and 
will be considered in more detail in the following discussion of the new trade 
agreements signed by the United States.
Two NAFTA-Specific Issues
A number of highly contentious issues arose during the NAFTA debate, as alluded 
to in the previous section. Some of the issues are specific to NAFTA, and some 
apply to all or nearly all trade agreements. Labor and environmental standards, 
relations between foreign investors and national governments, and intellectual 
property rights enforcement are general controversies, but they are also issues 
where NAFTA has served as a model for the design of trade agreements with 
other nations (Table 13.2). These issues are discussed later in the chapter. Two 
specific issues that pose significant barriers to NAFTA’s deepening are immigra-
tion and the ongoing drug violence in Mexico.
NAFTA did not provide any guidance on immigration policy. Because it is a 
free trade area and not a common market, there is no provision for the movement 
of labor, except some categories of business people, nor is there any discussion of 
such a provision. In most contexts, a free trade area without immigration provi-
sions is the norm, but in the context of U.S.–Mexico relations, it is a problem. Over 
the last four decades, the flow from Mexico has been the largest wave of immigra-
tion from a single country to the United States in U.S. history. Mexican migrants 
in the United States numbered more than 11.7 million in 2014 and were 28 percent 
of all immigrants. Researchers estimate that just over one-half of the Mexican 
immigrant population is unauthorized to be in the United States. Migrants go to 

Chapter 13    The United States in the World Economy  
345
the United States for the usual reasons: jobs, income, and family reunification. 
They also leave Mexico for the United States for specific reasons: proximity, the 
2,000-mile-long border that is impossible to close completely, and a lack of jobs 
and opportunity in their home country.
The unprecedented wave of migration has declined dramatically in recent 
years, as more Mexicans leave the United States than arrive. This trend began 
around 2005 or 2006 and has at least three factors behind it. One, the border has 
become harder and more dangerous to cross. Much of it is desert wilderness with 
extremely rugged conditions that are made more severe by the growth of drug 
violence and the targeting of migrants by criminal gangs and drug cartels. Two, the 
political and economic environment of the United States is more difficult. Jobs are 
harder to find since the recession of 2007–2009, and throughout the border region, 
anti-immigrant groups and politicians have created an aggressively unwelcoming 
political environment. Three, and most significant for the long term, the demog-
raphy of Mexico is changing in ways that are reducing the number of potential 
migrants. In 1960, the average Mexican woman could expect to have 7.3 children 
during her lifetime. By 2009, the number had fallen to 2.4, barely above population 
replacement levels. The decline in childbirths leads, with a lag, to a decline in the 
growth rate of the young adult population and the number of potential migrants. 
In sum, between 2005 and 2010, the number of people born in Mexico and living 
in the United States did not increase, as new entrants fell to the same level as the 
number leaving the country.
A second issue of grave concern in the NAFTA region is the rise in drug vio-
lence in Mexico. This is a very contentious and tragic issue with no consensus on 
needed policy changes, but with a continuing loss of life, mostly in Mexico and 
mostly related to the violence of transporting and selling illegal drugs. This issue 
has far more than trade implications because it concerns law enforcement, medi-
cine, public health, economic well-being, civil liberties, and other areas. Currently 
and for many years past, both in Mexico and the United States, the discourse 
is dominated by politics. In 1969, President Nixon declared a “national war on 
drugs,” and nearly fifty years later, similar policies are in place, even as it is hard 
to show positive results from the war and as many tens of thousands of people 
have been murdered as a result of drug-related violence.
The violence in Mexico is a shared responsibility of the United States and Mex-
ico because U.S. demand for illegal drugs generates the enormous profits for drug 
cartels that are used to corrupt Mexican judges, politicians, and police forces. There 
is no consensus on the solution to this dilemma. Classical arguments for legaliza-
tion assert that making drugs illegal only forces them underground, where they are 
still available and provide profits to organized crime and incentives to use violence 
to settle disputes. Legalization proponents point to the problems of corruption, 
health and safety issues, and challenges to civil liberties as ­additional negative spill-
overs from the attempts by the authorities to enforce the laws. Counter-­arguments 
are that addiction is likely to increase if drugs become more ­available or that it 
is immoral to condone drug usage by making it legal. While there is very little 
agreement, politicians in Mexico and the rest of Latin America are beginning to 

346
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
vocally challenge the U.S. lead in the war on drugs and have begun calling for new 
strategies—particularly ones that focus on demand reduction and the public health 
aspects of drugs instead of focusing solely on supply elimination.
C A S E  S T U D Y
Ejidos, Agriculture, and NAFTA in Mexico
The majority of Mexico’s farmers work on a type of collective farm called 
ejidos. Ejido members can farm their individual pieces of land as independent 
farmers, planting whatever crops they choose, and their children can inherit the 
land, but they cannot sell the land and they cannot rent it out to someone else. 
In theory, they either farm it or lose it. The first ejidos were created about a 
decade after the Mexican Revolution (1910–1917) and continued to be formed 
until the constitutional reforms of 1992. Mexico’s constitution put limits on the 
amount of land one person could own and gave landless agricultural laborers 
the right to petition the government for the excess land. The 1992 reforms 
stopped the creation of new ejidos and created a process for breaking up exist-
ing ones by turning them into private landholdings. The reforms do not require 
change, and most ejidos continue to operate the same as they did before the 
reforms, although some have been privatized and the land has been sold. At the 
same time that the government opened an avenue for buying and selling ejido 
lands, it cut many of the subsidies it had given to small farmers. In the long run, 
changes in the level of subsidies for small farmers have been more important 
than the new markets for ejido lands—and not always for the best.
According to the Mexican Census of Agriculture, in 2007 there were 31,518 
ejidos, with 4,210,899 members (including people living on the communal lands 
of indigenous communities). This is approximately 72–73 percent of the labor 
force in agriculture in Mexico. On average, ejido farmers tend to own less 
valuable lands, have smaller individual plots of land than more commercially 
oriented farms, and produce a disproportionately small share of the nation’s 
agricultural output. This is not to say that all ejido farmers are poor, but many 
of them lack access to markets, to capital, and to technical knowledge that 
would allow the members to earn a decent living.
In 1992, Mexico rewrote the section of its constitution that allowed for the 
creation of ejidos. The administration of Mexico’s president, Carlos Salinas, 
argued that ejidos created disincentives for investment in agriculture, which 
kept productivity low and contributed to rural poverty. Some economists 
shared this view, but others were not so certain. The argument of the reform-
ers was that the lack of complete ownership rights and ejidos’ small plot sizes 
inhibited the use of machinery and other productivity-enhancing investments. 
Regardless of the analytical correctness or incorrectness of the causes of low 

Chapter 13    The United States in the World Economy  
347
productivity on ejidos, the vast majority of Mexico’s poor people lived in rural 
areas and worked in agriculture, often as members of an ejido. In 1992, about 
25 percent of the labor force was in agriculture, but it produced only 9 percent 
of GDP. One explicit purpose of the change in subsidies for small farmers and 
in ownership rights of ejido members was to reduce the size of the agricultural 
labor force by creating incentives to combine land holdings and to apply mod-
ern production technologies. In 1992, the undersecretary of agriculture stated 
that the goal was to reduce the share of labor in agriculture from 25 percent of 
the labor force to 15 percent.
Eighteen years later, in 2010, 13.1 percent of the labor force was in agri-
culture (compared to less than 2 percent in the United States and Canada). 
The highest levels of poverty continue to be concentrated in rural areas, and 
small-scale agriculture continues to struggle even as larger, more modern and 
productive farms do well. NAFTA opponents frequently blame the trade 
agreement for the difficult conditions on many ejidos and small farms, but 
Mexican agricultural policy plays a far larger role. Corn shows why. Corn is 
a dietary staple for many Mexicans and the main crop on many small farms. 
Under NAFTA, Mexico’s import duties on corn were scheduled to be phased 
out over a fifteen-year period, but Mexico unilaterally cut tariffs ahead of 
schedule and increased imports from the United States, in part to lower the 
price of corn for animal feed, increase the size of the country’s livestock herds, 
and expand the amount of animal protein in the diet of the average Mexican 
citizen. Mexico’s larger and more commercial farmers expanded their corn 
production along with the growth in imports, and the total amount produced 
nationally increased. Nevertheless, small-scale farmers who operated at near-
subsistence levels of production were badly hurt by this strategy because it 
lowered corn prices at the same point in time that the government cut subsidies 
to small farmers.
NAFTA allows each country to subsidize its farms as little or as much as 
it chooses. Mexico provided approximately US $8.4 billion in farm supports 
(subsidies) in 2014, but much of this went to farmers who were relatively bet-
ter off. That level of subsidies is equal to 13.3 percent of the gross receipts of 
farmers. By way of comparison, in the United States, farm subsidies are 9.8 
percent of farm receipts (see Table 7.3), according to the Agricultural Outlook 
of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 
The decision to downsize the agricultural sector was independent of the deci-
sion to sign a trade agreement with the United States and Canada, and clearly 
it did not take into account the plight of farmers who have few options other 
than a small plot of corn.

Table 13.2 shows the recent trade agreements, along with some older ones, that 
are in force. The United States is negotiating two additional agreements of some 
importance and has put into place a series of unilateral agreements that provide 
market access without demanding reciprocation, called preferential agreements. 
This type of agreement is enacted to support the development efforts of a set of 
countries, or for a specific political reason. Table 13.4 lists the two key FTAs that 
are still in negotiation as well as the preferential agreements in place.
The two FTAs listed in Table 13.4, particularly the Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) economic forum, include a large number of countries.

APEC spans the Pacific, from north to south and east to west, and includes some 
of the largest economies in the world, including China, Japan, South Korea, Mex-
ico, Canada, and Australia. It differs from other FTAs in that it is not directed at 
creating an FTA among its members, but rather seeks to create free trade for all, 
members and nonmembers, within the Asia-Pacific region. In its original goals, 
it set 2010 as a target date for free trade for all its industrial economy members, 
and 2020 for the developing economies. The first target date was not met and 
has been scaled back as APEC has become a forum for discussing trade issues of 
concern. In part, it was lack of progress in APEC that caused the United States to 
join with a subset of APEC countries to pursue a FTA in the form of the Trans-
Pacific Partnership (TPP).
In the agreements completed (Table 13.2) under negotiation, similar issues 
arise over and over. These include labor and environmental standards, invest-
ment, and job loss.
Labor and Environmental Standards
In nearly all the trade agreements signed since NAFTA (1994), the labor and 
environmental side agreements (North American Agreement on Labor Coop-
eration and North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation) have 
served as a framework for adding labor and environmental clauses. The key prin-
ciples of the labor and environmental side agreements to the NAFTA are that 
countries should enforce their own laws and that low or poorly enforced labor 
and environmental standards should not be used to attract trade or investment. 
Enforcement, for the most part, relies on consultations with parties levying a com-
plaint of nonenforcement, and investigation by the home country government. 
The wording of the agreements is very specific and states that no investigation 
or enforcement may be performed by one country in the territory of another. 
Instead, the agreements attempt to create public awareness of noncompliance 
without setting specific standards or encroaching on the sovereignty of national 
governments.
In the newest of the proposed agreements, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, labor 
standards are part of the agreement, with a dispute resolution process and the 
possibility for imposing trade sanctions such as tariffs when standards are not met. 
The content of the labor standards reflect the core principles of the International 
Labour Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights 
at Work and its follow-up (see Chapter 8):
1.	 Freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collec-
tive bargaining.
2.	 The elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor.
3.	 The effective abolition of child labor.
4.	 The elimination of discrimination with respect to employment and 
occupation.

350
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
The TPP is not the first agreement to incorporate labor standards directly 
rather than as a side agreement, but it is the first to offer the possibility of trade 
sanctions as a remedy for noncompliance and it is the first to specify the content 
of labor standards rather than leaving it up to individual countries to set their 
own standards. Note, however, that the specific content is rather general, and 
consequently, it would be incorrect to assume that standards are harmonized. 
For example, worker health and safety regulations, wages, and hours of work, will 
undoubtedly vary greatly across the members of the proposed TPP.
The environmental side agreement of the NAFTA established the framework 
for incorporating environmental clauses into subsequent FTAs. In many respects, 
it is parallel to the labor clause and is motivated by similar concerns that low 
environmental standards not be used to gain competitive advantages. As noted 
in Chapter 8, it is unrealistic to expect environmental standards, clean-up prefer-
ences, or resource commitments to be identical in countries with different income 
levels. Whereas some countries may prioritize the reduction of greenhouse gases, 
others may still be struggling to provide access to clean drinking water. The mar-
ginal benefits of one priority over another depend on the level of income and the 
state of the environment in each place. Consequently, the goal of the environmen-
tal side agreement to the NAFTA was, like the labor side agreement, to ensure 
that countries enforced their own laws and that they did not use low standards or 
poorly enforced standards as a means to attract investment or to lower costs of 
production.
The proposed TPP does not harmonize environmental standards. Rather it 
focuses on the enforcement of a number of international agreements, such as 
agreements on wildlife trafficking, protection of endangered species, and others, 
while also eliminating some subsidies to fishermen that have led to over-fishing. 
As with labor standards, its primary emphasis is on enforcement of each country’s 
own standards, along with recognition of a number of multilateral commitments 
all countries have made, or must make.
Critics of the labor and environmental clauses come in two forms. Some econo-
mists think that trade agreements should not be about labor and the environment, 
and so these clauses do not belong in trade agreements. They think that including 
these clauses gives support to protectionists who will inevitably oppose increased 
trade flows by making arguments, whether based on fact or not, that the trade 
partner does not enforce its laws adequately. Another set of economists argue 
that the clauses are meaningless because there is no real enforcement mechanism. 
Countries are left to their own devices to determine whether laws are adequately 
enforced, and there is no clear consequence of nonenforcement.
These criticisms have resulted in the new approach that is being tried with the 
proposed TPP. The chief negotiator for the United States, called the U.S. Trade 
Representative (USTR), has insisted that basic labor standards be incorporated 
into the agreement and that countries must recognize and enforce environmental 
standards that have multilateral support, such as rules on wildlife trafficking and 
protection of endangered species. In addition, for the first time, trade sanctions 
would be allowed as a way to enforce standards.

Chapter 13    The United States in the World Economy

It is fairly certain that NAFTA would not have been ratified by Congress 
­without the inclusion of the labor and environment side agreements as a package 
deal. Members of Congress were nervous about the potential for jobs to migrate 
south, and they worried that Mexico’s weaker enforcement of labor and envi-
ronmental laws could be used to gain competitiveness. Since then, the strategy 
of including labor and environmental chapters directly in the trade agreements 
has helped gain Congressional support and has become the standard strategy for 
ensuring passage of new agreements. Whether the new approach of specifying 
in more detail the content of the standards and allowing for the possibility of 
trade sanctions as a punishment for noncompliance will help gain passage of the 
proposed TPP remains to be seen. Undoubtedly, any future agreement will have 
something similar.
Investor-State Relations
A majority of the FTAs in force have chapters on investment. In addition, the 
United States has forty-two bilateral investment treaties (BIT) with countries 
across the globe. These agreements, like the FTA chapters on investment, set out 
the rules governing cross-border investment, including the options for dispute reso-
lution when an investor thinks they have been treated unfairly. The rules are set 
within a framework emphasizing national treatment for foreign investors with the 
intention of eliminating all distinctions between national and foreign investors. The 
rules also eliminate the use of most performance requirements for foreign invest-
ment (e.g., export requirement or local content use) and guarantee a uniform set 
of regulatory standards for foreign and domestic firms. As transportation and com-
munication improvements have enabled more businesses to offshore some of their 
production processes, U.S. trade policy has sought to address the concerns they 
have about investing abroad. In a very general sense, the goal of these agreements 
is to create a higher level of certainty for investors with respect to their property 
rights if they invest in a country that has an agreement with the United States.
Again, NAFTA set a framework for investor-state rules by creating a dispute 
settlement process specifically for investors from one NAFTA country that invest 
in another NAFTA country. Chapter 11 of NAFTA sets out the rules, and is per-
haps the most controversial part of the agreement. Specifically, Article 1110 states:
“No Party may directly or indirectly nationalize or expropriate an investment 
of an investor of another Party in its territory or take a measure tantamount to 
nationalization or expropriation of such an investment. . . .” (emphasis added)*
except for public purpose, on a nondiscriminatory basis, and with compensation. 
Critics of the NAFTA argue that undermines the sovereignty of nations by allow-
ing private enterprises to sue governments that are seeking to protect their work-
ers or their environment, or that implement regulations that they believe to be in 
the public interest. Since then, FTAs and BITs have introduced language referring 
*NAFTA, Organization of American States

352
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
to “indirect nationalization” and added clauses to the effect that nothing in the 
agreement shall be interpreted to mean that environmental or other standards 
may not be upheld or implemented if they protect the public interest.
Critics of these agreements argue that the asymmetry between the United 
States and many developing countries necessarily creates an unlevel playing field 
in which U.S. corporations with extensive resources can bully developing coun-
tries’ governments with the threat of lawsuits if they attempt to raise their regula-
tory standards. Again, the proposed TPP attempts to overcome the objections of 
critics by explicitly stating that nothing in the agreement can be interpreted as a 
limitation on the ability of countries to impose regulations to protect public health 
and safety or environmental quality.
Jobs and Trade Agreements
There are quite a few estimates of the job gains or losses caused by NAFTA and 
other trade agreements. Within five years of NAFTA’s implementation, the esti-
mates ranged from a net loss of 98,000 a year to a net gain of 42,000 a year. It is 
possible to estimate the number of workers needed to produce a given quantity 
of exports, and to estimate the number of jobs that would be created if imports 
were produced at home, but these values are not the same as job creation and 
destruction due to a trade agreement. For example, imports may supply a firm 
with capital or intermediate goods that make the firm more competitive and better 
able to survive; and exports may supply a foreign affiliate that has been recently 
off-shored by the home country firm. Hence, some imports create jobs, while some 
exports exist only because jobs at home have been moved abroad. Given these 
conceptual difficulties, actual estimates of the number of jobs gained or lost are 
closer to guesses. In addition, pro-trade think-tanks and scholars usually show job 
gains, while anti-trade think-tanks show job losses. In either case, however, neither 
side of the debate can show large job gains or losses in the United States due to 
trade agreements. Given that the United States creates more than 2 million net 
new jobs in an average (nonrecession) year, most estimates of job losses or gains 
due to the trade agreement are well below 5 percent of the measured total change.
Figure 13.3 illustrates this point by plotting gross job gains and gross job losses 
in the U.S. economy from March 1994, through March 2015. The values on the 
vertical axis are in thousands, making 8,000 equivalent to 8,000 thousand, or 8 
million. Figures are annual totals, measured from March to March. Job gains 
include new establishments or expansions in existing ones, while job losses include 
layoffs and establishment closings. Whenever job losses exceed job gains, there is 
net job loss, and vice versa when gains are greater. First, note that the two major 
episodes of job losses are during the recessions of 2001 and 2007–2009. Second, the 
period immediately after the implementation of NAFTA is not one with net job 
losses, but on the contrary, corresponds to a period of strong net job gains. That 
does not prove that NAFTA created jobs, but it does show that if there were job 
losses, they were substantially outweighed by other factors, including the strong 
economic growth of the second half of the 1990s. The most important point of 

Chapter 13    The United States in the World Economy  
353
Figure 13.3 is that the U.S. economy is larger than most people realize and that 
it is very dynamic.
A second point that has often been overlooked in the evaluation of NAFTA 
and other trade agreements is that the United States has much less unbalanced 
trade with the countries that have signed FTAs. Table 13.5 shows U.S. merchan-
dise exports, imports, and deficits for FTA countries and the rest of the world. 
Merchandise goods trade balances are much more favorable when countries sign 
an FTA because U.S. markets are already relatively open and tariff barriers are 
low, with the exceptions outlined in Chapter 7. When countries enter into an 
FTA, the required elimination of trade barriers is usually much greater outside the 
United States than it is inside. As foreign barriers decline, U.S. exports expand.
Anti-trade rhetoric usually assumes that trade deficits are encouraged by trade 
agreements, yet the data show otherwise. Anti-trade arguments also often assume 
that mercantilism is correct in its assertion that imports are harmful while exports 
are beneficial. Yet, consumers have more choices and businesses more competi-
tive when they have access to imports. Nevertheless, it is important to try to under-
stand the sources of anti-trade rhetoric. If FTAs are not the problem and if imports 
are beneficial, then why do so many people in the United States view international 
trade as harmful? There is no easy answer to this question and economists have 
not been able to reach a consensus as to the causes of anti-trade sentiments in the 
wider public. It may be partially related to the loss of manufacturing jobs, or to

The African Growth and Opportunity Act
Preferential trade agreements cover a variety of schemes that admit imports 
either tariff free or with a reduced tariff. Most high-income countries and some 
developing countries use these schemes to support low- and middle-income 
countries by letting their goods bypass the normal tariff barriers. The most 
common scheme is called the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The 
United States implemented the GSP in 1976 and currently offers tariff-free 
access to its market for a large percentage of goods coming from 122 develop-
ing countries.
In addition to the GSP, the United States offers two other preferential 
agreements: the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), and the African Growth 
and Opportunity Act (AGOA) (Table 13.4). Goods not covered under the 
GSP are covered in these additional preference schemes, although none of 
them cover all exports by the beneficiary countries. Each of these agreements 
has a political or economic objective. The CBI was implemented to diversify 
Caribbean exports and strengthen growth during a time of political unrest, 
guerilla warfare, and rising socialist parties in Central America and the AGOA 
is intended to promote export diversification and economic development in 
sub-Saharan Africa.

wage stagnation and growing inequality, or to the complaints of a vocal minority 
that has lost its livelihood as a result of trade and investment abroad. As Chapters 
3 and 4 show, trade causes economies to shift their production and some workers 
are displaced. Whatever their causes, anti-trade perspectives reflect a deep set of 
concerns about the future of the country.

Chapter 13    The United States in the World Economy  
355
AGOA is the most recent of the agreements. Signed into U.S. law in 2000, it 
currently covers thirty-nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa and is the primary 
trade-promotion initiative of the U.S. government for Africa. It provides duty-
free entry for 5,200 products, covering about 86 percent of products that the 
U.S. imports. Countries that qualify for duty-free access to the U.S. market 
under the AGOA include some of the poorest nations of sub-Saharan Africa, 
many with per capita incomes under $1,000 per person per year. The goal of the 
U.S. in offering enhanced market access on a unilateral basis is to encourage 
export diversification and promotion as a catalyst for economic development.
Duty-free access to the U.S. market is a significant benefit for sub-Saharan 
Africa and a few countries have taken advantage of the opportunity to increase 
exports, particularly in the automotive sector (car parts) and the relatively 
highly protected apparel sector. In spite of a few successes, more than one-half 
of all AGOA designated countries export less than $1 million in goods to the 
United States, and many of those with significant exports mostly sell oil, the 
most common export. The difficulties associated with diversifying out of oil 
are limited by two factors. First, a few goods that are sensitive to the United 
States are excluded. These are primarily agricultural products and include 
some key sectors. For example, cotton is an important product in ­several 
­countries (see the case study on losing comparative advantage in Chapter 3), 
as are the excluded items peanuts and sugar. Secondly, distance matters, as 
it leads to higher transportation costs and less competitive pricing. Western 
African nations are not so far from the United States, given cheap ocean trans-
portation, but East Africa is another matter. Furthermore, the disadvantage 
of distance is compounded for fourteen sub-Saharan African nations that 
are landlocked without direct access to the sea. (Africa has more landlocked 
nations than any other continent.)
As noted above, AGOA exports have grown since the implementation of 
the preferential scheme. Ideally, export growth would show a diversified set of 
manufactured goods and agricultural products, representing robust economic 
performance and new opportunities for these sub-Saharan nations. Yet, most 
of the growth has been in oil exports. Increased exploration and new discov-
eries have led to significant increases in oil exports to the United States from 
Angola, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Nigeria. In 2015, 35.8 percent 
of U.S. imports from AGOA countries were oil and related products.

CUSTA, and Canadians debated the likely impact on their social policies. In 
the United States, CUSTA was not a topic of debate.

■The most contentious issues in the United States related to the signing of 
the NAFTA agreement were those of labor policy, environmental policy 
and enforcement, and migration.
■
■To date, the main impact of NAFTA has been to continue an ongoing trend 
toward increased trade. It is impossible to accurately measure the effects of 
NAFTA on jobs and wages, but most economists estimate a small, positive 
effect on job creation.

■NAFTA has served as a model for other trade agreements, particularly with 
the inclusion of labor and environmental clauses.
■
■The United States has signed FTAs with twenty countries (seventeen since 
2000) and has negotiated forty-two bilateral investment agreements cover-
ing the rules for investment by foreigners. The purpose of the investment 
agreements is to create more secure property rights and to encourage for-
eign direct investment. In addition, it has created four preferential trade 
agreements worldwide and is negotiating two larger free trade areas in the 
Pacific region.

INTRODUCTION: THE EUROPEAN UNION
The European Union (EU) is an economic union of twenty-eight nations with over 
500 million citizens and $16,220 billion in output. It is the largest, oldest, and most 
integrated of regional agreements. It helped put an end to over a century of wars on 
the European continent, and its incorporation of new members from Central Europe 
has reintegrated several countries whose historical and cultural ties to Western Europe 
had been cut. There are many lessons to be learned from the struggle of the EU to 
expand and deepen the economic ties of its member nations.
Since its inception in 1957, the EU has grown in numbers and increased the scope 
of its responsibilities. Originally, the EU was called the European Economic Com-
munity (EEC), membership was limited to six countries, and economic ties did not go 
beyond the formation of a free trade area. By the late 1960s, they had become a cus-
toms union and in the early 1970s, the EEC began to add new members. In 1979, the 
nine members of what was then called the European Community (EC) linked their 
exchange rates in a system designed to eliminate wide fluctuations among currencies. 
In the 1980s, the EC added three new members, making the total twelve countries, 
and in 1987 they signed the Single European Act (SEA) which signaled the creation 
of a common market. In 1992, the members signed the Treaty on European Union,

which changed the name of the European Community to the European Union 
(EU) and led directly to the creation of the common currency, the euro, in 1999. 
Since 2004, thirteen new members have joined, including three newly indepen-
dent nations that were part of the former Soviet Union, two countries that were 
formerly part of Yugoslavia, and seven ex-socialist countries in Central Europe.  
None of these changes have been easy, and the problems of the single currency 
threaten to unravel many of the economic and political gains. In implementing the 
various integration initiatives, the member states have been forced to act prag-
matically as internal and external events forced changes. The shift from fixed

to floating exchange rates in the 1970s and 1980s, the fall of the Berlin Wall in 
1989, the collapse of communism, the integration of world capital markets, the 
rise of environmental awareness, and the pressures on the single currency have 
shaped the EU’s development. As economic and political changes have led to new 
arrangements and new responsibilities for EU institutions, the goal of a peace-
ful and integrated Europe has stayed on track. In this regard, the EU is a truly 
remarkable achievement, particularly when one considers the bloody history of 
twentieth-century Europe and the low expectations of most observers when the 
original documents were signed in 1957.
The EU is the most ambitious integration agreement in the world today. It 
has its own revenue and budget, a set of institutions for making laws and regu-
lating areas of common interest, a common currency, and freedom of move-
ment for people, money, goods, and services. Despite this profound integration, 
it has managed to protect the sovereignty of its member states and to avoid 
homogenization of cultures and linguistic regions. Indeed, integration in the 
larger sphere of nation-states has enabled a number of historical national iden-
tities to re-emerge and to claim greater autonomy in their political systems. 
Examples include the Catalans of Spain and the Welsh and Scots of the United 
Kingdom.
THE SIZE OF THE EUROPEAN MARKET
Before discussing the history or economics of economic integration in Western 
Europe, let us define the nations and groups that are important to get an idea of 
the size of the market. In terms of population, the EU is the largest integrated 
market in the world. By implication, the EU could play a major role in deter-
mining future international political arrangements, trade patterns and rules, and 
international economic relations in general.
Table 14.1 lists the members of the EU and their populations and incomes in 
2015. Total gross domestic product (GDP) is given in dollars at market exchange 
rates, and in per capita terms at purchasing power parity equivalents. Several 
features of Table 14.1 are worth highlighting. First, not all Western European 
nations are members. Norway, which voted against joining in 1970 and 1995, 
and Switzerland are noticeably absent, along with a number of smaller Western 
European nations, including Iceland, Liechtenstein, San Marino, and Monaco. 
Second, the majority of nations in the EU are relatively small. The unification 
of Germany in the early 1990s created the largest country in the EU, but only 
six of the twenty-seven nations (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland, and 
the United Kingdom) can be considered large, and none are as populous as 
the United States or Mexico. Third, the combined EU market is very similar 
to the size of the NAFTA market in terms of population and GDP. In 2015, 
the EU counted 507 million people, while the NAFTA nations counted 484

million; GDP comparisons were $16,220 billion in the EU and $20,643 billion 
in NAFTA.
THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS PREDECESSORS
LO 14.1	 Describe the major institutions and treaty agreements of the EU.
The EEC was born on March 25, 1957, with the signing of the Treaty of Rome 
by the original six members. The treaty went into effect about nine months later, 
on January 1, 1958. The treaty remains the fundamental agreement, while more 
recent agreements, such as the Single European Act and the Treaty on European 
Union, also called the Maastricht Treaty, were passed as amendments to the origi-
nal treaty. The six founding members include the Benelux countries (Belgium, 
Netherlands, and Luxembourg), France, West Germany, and Italy.

Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
The Treaty of Rome
The EEC grew out of the reconstruction of Europe at the end of World War II. 
The goals of the founders of the EEC were to rebuild their destroyed economies 
and to prevent the destruction from happening again. The original vision of the 
founders of the EEC was for a political union that they hoped to create through 
economic integration. In 1950, Robert Schuman, the foreign minister of France, 
proposed an integration of European coal and steel industries. Coal and steel were 
chosen because they were large industrial activities that served as the backbone 
of military strength. Schuman’s plan was to pool the industries of Germany and 
France, the two largest Western European antagonists, but Luxembourg, Belgium, 
the Netherlands, and Italy signed on as well. The European Coal and Steel Com-
munity (ECSC) Treaty was signed in 1951, and coal and steel trade between the 
six members grew by 129 percent in the first five years of the treaty.
The success of the ECSC led to early attempts at integration in political and 
military areas, but these efforts failed for political reasons. At that point, Euro-
pean leaders decided to focus their efforts on economic integration. In 1955, the 
six foreign ministers of the ECSC countries launched a round of talks to dis-
cuss the creation of the European Economic Community and European Atomic 
Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom). The goal of the former was to create a 
single, integrated market for goods, services, labor, and capital. The latter sought 
jointly to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Two separate treaties 
were signed in 1957 in Rome, creating the EEC and Euratom.
Institutional Structure
The founders of the EEC debated the terms of their political affiliation. The key 
issue was and remains the degree of authority and power to grant the European 
institutions, and how much to reserve for national states. Officially, the EU is 
not a federation of states or provinces such as the United States or Canada, but a 
unique union of independent states that collaborate on transnational issues while 
maintaining sovereign authority on others.
In EU jargon, subsidiarity describes the relationship between national and EU 
areas of authority, and between national and EU institutions. Subsidiarity is the 
principle that the union will only have authority to tackle issues that are more effec-
tively handled through international action than by individual nations acting alone. 
In some cases, these issues are easily defined, but in others they are not. Currently, 
the EU is responsible for trade policy, competition policy, environmental policy, 
regional development, research and technology development, and economic and 
monetary union. Areas that are less settled and more controversial include social 
policy—such as the social safety net and health care—and labor market policy—
such as rules regarding working hours, safety, vacations, and wage rates.
There are three main governing bodies in the EU and several additional key 
institutions. The three governing bodies are the European Commission, the 
­Council of the European Union, and the European Parliament. These three insti-
tutions represent the citizens of the EU and form the backbone of EU governance. 

Chapter 14    The European Union: Many Markets into One 
363
Table 14.2 shows the number of votes in each, as well as the range of votes granted 
the various countries, depending on their size.
EU Institutions and Finance  The executive body of the EU is the European Com-
mission. Each country has one vote in the commission. The Commission elects one 
of its own members to serve as its president. The Commission’s primary respon-
sibility is to act as the guardian of the treaties, ensuring that they are faithfully 
and legally enforced. This role includes responsibility for creating the rules for 
implementing treaty articles and for EU budget appropriations. As the executive 
branch, the Commission has the sole right to initiate EU laws and the same right 
as the national governments to submit proposals.
The Council of the European Union is the primary legislative branch of the EU, 
a responsibility it shares with the European Parliament. Each country has between 
three (Malta) and twenty-nine (France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom) 
votes. The Council enacts laws proposed by the commission and has more control 
over the budget than the Parliament or the commission. Its membership consists 
of ministers from each nation, with participation varying according to the topic 
under discussion. For example, labor ministers convene to discuss labor issues, 
and environmental ministers to discuss environmental legislation. Most legislative 
decisions require either unanimity among all countries or a qualified majority, 
which is at least 55 percent of countries (sixteen of twenty-eight) representing at 
least 65 percent of total EU population. (In addition to the Council of the Euro-
pean Union, the heads of state of EU countries, together with the president of the 
European Commission and the EU’s foreign minister, comprise a similar sounding 
but different institution, known as the European Council. They usually meet four 
times a year to set the political direction of the EU.)
The European Parliament has 751 members, directly elected by the people for 
five-year terms and apportioned among the member states according to popula-
tion. Members associate by political affiliation rather than national origin. The 
Parliament’s three main responsibilities are the passing of laws (together with 
the Council), supervising other EU institutions, and passing the final budget. EU 
laws are usually a co-decision of the Council and Parliament, although the Council 
alone may make laws in certain areas. Passage of the annual budget of the EU 
requires approval of the Parliament. Over time, the role of the Parliament has 
probably changed more than that of any other institution. In its early years it was

primarily an advisory body with little real authority, but as the EU has grown it 
has taken on more authority.
The total budget of the EU in 2014 was €142.6 billion (approximately 
$156 ­billion) in commitments. This amounts to less than 1 percent of the gross 
national income of the member states—a very small amount of revenue by com-
parison to that of national governments that have total revenue equivalent to 30 to 
50 percent or more of the nation’s gross national income. The budget is financed 
by tariffs on goods entering the EU, an EU share of national value added taxes, 
and a payment from each member country based on the size of its economy. The 
last category is by far the largest, accounting for more than 70 percent of the total 
revenue collected by the EU.
The two largest expenditure categories of the EU are for agricultural support—
both direct payments in the form of subsidies and indirect payments in the form of 
rural development—and cohesion funds. Agricultural support and rural develop-
ment programs take approximately 43 percent of the budget. The other main cat-
egory, cohesion funds, are used to support less developed regions within the EU, 
and are approximately one-half of the total budget. Economic support is given via 
funding for infrastructure development, including environmental projects such as 
water treatment and transportation projects.
DEEPENING AND WIDENING THE COMMUNITY IN THE 
1970s AND 1980s
LO 14.2	 Distinguish EU widening from EU deepening.
When Europeans speak of increasing the level of cooperation between mem-
ber countries, they use the term deepening. Deepening refers to economic and 
noneconomic activities that cause increased levels of integration of the national 
economies. For example, the movement from a free market to a customs union, 
the harmonization of technical standards in industry, and the development of 
a common currency are deepening activities that increase interactions between 
the member states. On the other hand, when Europeans speak about extending 
the boundaries of the EU to include new members, they use the term widening. 
Between 1957, when the agreement was signed to create the EEC, and 1995, nine 
new members were added, bringing the total from six original members to fifteen. 
Since 2004, thirteen more members have been added. In the next section of this 
chapter we will look at the various stages of deepening.
Before the Euro
In 1979, the members of the EC began to link their currencies in an effort to pre-
vent radical fluctuation in currency values. The EC wanted to prevent competitive 
devaluations, in which one country devalues in order to capture the export markets 
of another country. Competitive devaluations inevitably generate conflict and lead 
to a breakdown in cooperation, because the devaluing country is viewed as gaining 

Chapter 14    The European Union: Many Markets into One 
365
exports and jobs at the expense of others. Nations sometimes find it difficult to resist 
devaluation, especially during recessions. This tactic is viewed as unfair, however, 
and in the medium to long term, it is usually ineffective because the nondevaluing 
countries are obliged to follow suit and retaliate with their own devaluations.
In addition to looking for a mechanism that might discourage competitive deval-
uations, the EC sought to remove some of the uncertainty and risk from trading 
and investing across national boundaries. While forward markets can be used to 
protect against exchange rate risk, they work only about six months into the future. 
The goal was to create an environment in which trade and investment through-
out the EC were determined by considerations of comparative advantage and 
efficient resource allocation rather than by changes in exchange rates. The result 
was the European Monetary System (EMS) and the exchange rate mechanism 
(ERM). The formation of the EMS in 1979 was a significant deepening of the EC 
and served to prepare the way for the eventual introduction of a single currency. 
It was designed to prevent extreme currency fluctuations by tying each currency’s 
value to the weighted average of the others. The group average, the European cur-
rency unit (ECU), was used as a unit of account, but not as a means of payment.
The ERM is an example of a soft peg with an exchange rate band. Each cur-
rency in the band was fixed to the ECU, but was allowed to fluctuate several 
percentage points up or down. If a currency began to move out of the bandwidth, 
the central bank of the country was obligated to intervene by either buying its 
currency to prop it up, or by selling currency to push it down. In September 1992, 
for example, the United Kingdom spent an estimated $30 billion in just a few days 
of buying British pounds in a failed attempt to protect the currency from market 
speculators convinced that it was going to fall in value.
Given the ineffectiveness of market intervention in the face of a strong and 
determined market movement, most analysts predicted that the ERM would fail 
as a mechanism for maintaining stable European currency values. To most econo-
mists’ surprise, the ERM effectively linked EC exchange rates for two decades. 
The ERM experienced several adjustments, but none of them threatened the 
functioning of the system until 1992.
Problems began in 1990 with Germany’s decision to speed up its reunification 
with the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) after the fall of the Berlin 
Wall in November 1989. Economic conditions in East Germany were worse than 
expected, and it was soon apparent that the costs of building a productive economy 
would be enormous. Public infrastructure (roads, bridges, ports, utilities, schools, 
hospitals) was in worse shape than most people realized, and environmental pollu-
tion was significant. To build a prosperous economy in its eastern region, Germany 
had to raise the productivity levels of the people living there by making large invest-
ments in infrastructure and the environment. The unexpectedly large expenditures 
to raise the productivity of East Germany resulted in a very large fiscal stimulus to 
the German economy. Such large expenditures by both the government and private 
sectors were also expected to have an inflationary impact, and the Bundesbank 
(Germany’s central bank) acted to counteract the increased probability of future 
inflation by raising interest rates. Germany, therefore, had an expansionary fiscal 
policy that was partially offset by a contractionary monetary policy.

366
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
High interest rates in Germany made German financial instruments more 
attractive and caused capital to flow into Germany from the other EC countries. 
This resulted in the selling of British pounds, French francs, and other currencies 
to buy German marks (and then German bonds) and caused the pound, the franc, 
and other currencies to fall in value. At first, the movement was within the 2.25 
percent bandwidth, and most of the EC hoped that they would somehow muddle 
through without making any drastic changes in the ERM or the EMS.
One solution would have been for the countries with falling currencies to raise 
their interest rates to match Germany’s. This would have stemmed the outflow of 
financial capital looking for better rates of return in Germany. Some of the coun-
tries—the United Kingdom, for example—were entering recessions in 1990 and 
1991 and did not want to raise interest rates just as a recession was taking hold. 
Other countries—France, for example—were not yet entering the recessionary 
phase of their business cycle, but they had very high unemployment rates, and 
contractionary monetary policy was not desirable.
The dilemma faced by the EC countries is a good example of a recurring theme 
in the history of exchange rate systems. By tying their exchange rates to each other, 
the EC countries gave up a large measure of independence in their monetary poli-
cies. Because Germany was the largest country and the one with the most influen-
tial Central Bank, its monetary policy set the tone for the rest of the EC, and, at a 
time when many of the members wanted expansionary monetary policy, they were 
forced to adopt contractionary policies. The 1992 episode illustrates the recurrent 
tension between the appropriate external policies (exchange rate management) and 
the appropriate internal policies (full employment, reasonable growth, low infla-
tion) when nations peg their exchange rates. Because the “right” policy choice for 
meeting the exchange rate problem was diametrically opposite to meeting the needs 
of the internal economy, EC members were left with a tough decision. They would 
have to honor their commitments to the ERM and make their unemployment and 
growth rates worse, or do the right thing for internal growth and watch the ERM fall 
apart. In the French case, an interest rate increase threw the country into recession, 
but France remained within the ERM. In Italy and the United Kingdom, the ERM 
was abandoned, and their currencies were allowed to freely float against other EC 
currencies. A third option was chosen by Spain, where the parity, or center of the 
band, was shifted. To lessen the probability of future repeats of this problem, the 
bandwidth everywhere was widened in 1993 from {2.25 percent to {15 percent.
THE SECOND WAVE OF DEEPENING: THE SINGLE EURO-
PEAN ACT
LO 14.3	 Explain the obstacles to regional integration agreements.
Other than the creation of the EMS in 1979, the changes in the EC were minor 
through the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s. Low growth rates and high unem-
ployment caused the European economies to appear stagnant and incapable of 

Chapter 14    The European Union: Many Markets into One 
367
new dynamism; many in the United States began to refer to the European situation 
as “Eurosclerosis,” signifying a permanent hardening of the arteries of commerce 
and industry. By the late 1980s, “Eurosclerosis” had turned into “Europhoria.” 
While both terms were exaggerations, dramatic events had reshaped the EC in the 
intervening years. What was previously dismissed in the early 1980s as a hopeless 
case of bureaucratic inefficiency was now regarded as a dynamic, forward-looking, 
integrated regional economy. Europe seemed to be “on the move.”
C A SE  S T U D Y
The Schengen Agreement
The Schengen Agreement was signed by five countries (Belgium, France, Ger-
many, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) in the town of Schengen, Luxem-
bourg, in 1985. The purpose of the agreement was to eliminate all passport 
and customs controls at the common borders of the five nations. Given that 
they enjoyed free trade, and given the flow of people between the countries, 
the purpose of examining passports or checking customs paperwork seemed 
inefficient and unnecessary. Over the next few years, more members of the EU 
joined the agreement. When the SEA was implemented, the idea of a common 
market allowing free movement of people gave it added logic. By 1995, the 
agreement was extended to more countries and more areas of activity, including 
cooperation among police forces, drug enforcement agencies, and the sharing 
of criminal justice information. Originally, the Schengen Agreement and its 
subsequent extension were outside the legal framework of the EU, but in 1999, 
it was incorporated into EU law. Eventually non-EU countries, among them 
Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Iceland, and Norway, were allowed to participate.
The dismantling of border-control stations, including passport and customs 
inspections, undoubtedly has had a positive effect on EU efficiency because 
it reduces travel time for both goods and people. It also demonstrates a high 
degree of social trust among the member nations and contributes to goodwill 
and better relations. In effect, it shifts customs and passport controls to the 
perimeter of the EU, where non-EU citizens and goods first enter the region. 
While this is beneficial, several problems have arisen from the shifting of con-
trol to the perimeter.
First, Ireland and the United Kingdom have not accepted the dismantling 
of passport controls at the border because they fear the freedom of movement 
this will give terrorists. However, as members of the EU, they must extend 
the rights of all other EU citizens to travel freely and reside inside their bor-
ders, even as they maintain passport checks at the border. Second, the eventual 
extension of the Schengen Agreement to the thirteen new members since 2004 
depends on those members’ ability to demonstrate control over their own bor-
ders to the east, and on the development of a new EU data system for sharing 
information about individuals and lost or stolen objects.

Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
The Delors Report
Reshaping the European Community into the European Union got under way 
with the selection of the former French finance minister, Jacques Delors, to serve 
a five-year term as president of the EC. Delors was a compromise candidate, and 
no one expected unusual or dramatic changes in the EC under his stewardship. 
Delors’s vision of the EC, however, was of a fully integrated union, and as presi-
dent of the EC’s executive branch he had a platform from which he could initiate 
significant change. His vision was shaped in part by the belief that the institutions 
of the EC could help return individual national economies to economic prosperity 
and by the desire to complete the task of building an economic and political union.
Delors’s first step, and perhaps his most significant one, was to issue a report 
called “Completing the Internal Market,” which detailed 300 specific changes 
necessary for the EC to move from a customs union to a common market and 
eventually an economic union. It laid out a timetable for completing the changes 
and implemented changes in voting on new policies that made it easier to pass 
legislation. 
After some relatively minor changes in the Delors Report, it was adopted in 
its entirety in 1987 as the Single European Act (SEA), which came to be called, 
informally, the Single Market Program (SMP). Of the 300 steps, or “directives,” 
279 were included in the SMP. Many of the twenty-one steps not included were 
considered too difficult to accomplish in the time period the EC gave itself, but 
were taken up as goals of the next round of deepening. For example, monetary 
union under a single currency was moved forward to the next round of deepening.
The date for implementation of the SMP was January 1, 1993. By the end of 
1992, it was expected that the “four freedoms” (freedom of movement for goods, 
services, capital, and labor) spelled out in the SMP would be instituted and, as 
a result, the EC would be at the common market level of economic integration. 
By the end of 1992, nearly all the directives had been implemented, along with 
two additional initiatives. One additional measure was to strengthen the EC’s 
competition policy so that mergers could not lead to increased market power by 
individual firms. The second initiative came on the heels of the admission of Spain 
Countries on the eastern and southern peripheries of the EU have been 
severely challenged by the revolutions, wars, and crises in North Africa and the 
Middle East. Syrian, Somali, Libyan, Iraqi, and other refugees have migrated 
in large numbers to Turkey and eventually the EU, while terrorists have taken 
advantage of peripheral countries in order to gain entrance to the EU where, 
once they are inside, they are able to move more-or-less freely. These develop-
ments have created a political crisis for EU leadership, and have caused several 
countries to back away from their commitments under the Schengen Agree-
ment. As of 2016, it is uncertain if the agreement will continue to operate, or 
how it might change if it does.

and Portugal to the EC in 1986 and called for a strengthening of regional policies 
designed to reduce the differences in income between the wealthier states and 
new entrants.
The steps taken to implement the SMP can be broadly divided into three areas: 
(1) the elimination of physical barriers, such as passport and customs controls at 
the borders between member countries; (2) the elimination of technical barriers, 
such as differences in product and safety standards; and (3) the elimination of fis-
cal barriers, such as differences in taxes, subsidies, and public procurement. Each 
of these poses its own benefits and challenges and will be discussed in more detail. 
First, we will consider the gains that the EC hoped to reap from the elimination 
of these barriers.
Forecasts of the Gains from the Single European Act
The two primary means by which economic gains were expected to be realized 
were an increase in competition and economies of scale. A reduction in barriers 
at the border was expected to expand trade between member states by bringing 
down transportation costs, including wait times and other obstacles associated 
with shipping goods across national boundaries. In theory, removing barriers at 
the borders of markets that are segmented into separate national markets will 
enable them to become more integrated and will increase competition. Further-
more, the harmonization of standards and regulations reduces the costs of operat-
ing internationally. In the case of imperfectly competitive markets, where goods 
prices are above marginal costs, the mark-up charged by firms would come down 
as more competitive pressures are applied. Economies of scale can have similar 
effects as firms find it easier to operate across national boundaries, expand pro-
duction, and reduce their costs by taking advantage of internal scale economies.
The predictions for the impacts of the SMP are testable. Economists and EC 
commissioners predicted that there would be more trade, lower price mark-ups, 
increased concentration of firms due to the ability to take advantage of scale 
economies, and increased price convergence. In nearly all cases, the predicted 
effects were realized by the actual effects. For example, trade among EC partners 
rose from 61.2 percent of the total trade of member states to 67.9 percent between 
1985 and 1995. The percent of total output in each industry that is produced by the 
four largest firms rose in most industrial sectors. The share of world mergers and 
acquisitions that took place in Europe rose dramatically between 1985–1987 and 
1991–1993. In the end, it is estimated that between 300,000 and 900,000 more jobs 
were created, and GDP in 1994 was 1.1 to 1.5 percent greater than it would have 
been without the measures taken to implement the SEA and the SMP.
Increased competition and economies of scale both led to more GDP and 
employment, but perhaps the most positive aspect of the changes was the con-
vergence in income levels. Figure 14.1 shows GDP per person (measured in PPP 
terms) for Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain. All of these countries were mem-
bers of the EC before the SMP was negotiated and signed, and each had incomes 
below the average of the twelve members. In all but the Greek case, per capita 

370
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
income rose toward the EC average, and in the Irish case, income was above aver-
age by 1997. It is impossible to prove that convergence was a direct result of the 
SMP, but there is strong evidence that it played a significant role.
Problems in the Implementation of the SEA
One of the most interesting lessons of the SMP is that it is still difficult to reduce 
barriers to trade and investment even when the citizens, businesses, and govern-
ments of the involved countries are united in their desire to do so. According to 
all the polls, the SMP enjoyed very broad support throughout the EC. Still, from 
the time when it was first proposed in 1985 until its final implementation in 1993, 
there were very difficult negotiations among the member countries.
The Effects of Restructuring   As we saw in Chapter 3, when a national economy 
goes from a relatively closed position to a relatively open one, economic restruc-
turing takes place. The less efficient firms are squeezed out, and the more efficient 
ones grow; overall economic welfare expands as countries concentrate on what 
they do best, which inevitably means abandoning some industries and expanding 
others. In the case of the EC, it was forecast that almost all manufacturing indus-
tries would see shrinkage in the number of firms. The most extreme case was the 
footwear industry, which was predicted to lose 207 of its 739 firms.
The auto industry is an example of an economic interest that fought to prevent 
the full realization of the goals of the SMP. Car prices vary throughout the EU 
due to a lack of harmonization of national technical standards, documentation 
requirements, and rates of taxation. Ordinarily, price differences would present 
an opportunity for consumers and distributors to move cars from the low-price

countries to the high-price ones and, in the process, bring about a reduction in 
price differences. The auto industry is covered by a separate set of tax laws, how-
ever, that require buyers to pay the tax rate of the country where they register the 
car, not where they buy the car. This effectively discourages buyers from crossing 
national borders to search out the best deal on car prices and helps maintain the 
status quo in automobile production.
One significant reason why there have not been more exceptions to the drop-
ping of trade barriers is that the EU has a broad array of programs to address the 
problems of structural change. Some of these programs are funded out of the EU 
budget, and others are national in origin. Programs include the EU’s Regional 
Development Funds, which can be used to address problems of structural unem-
ployment, and the member nations’ income maintenance, education, and retrain-
ing funds. The latter vary across the member countries, but in general they reduce 
the costs to individuals and communities of unemployment and structural change 
by providing a generous social safety net for laid-off workers.
Harmonization of Technical Standards  A second major obstacle to the creation 
of the four freedoms was the problem of harmonizing standards. These include 
everything from building codes, industrial equipment, consumer safety, and health 
standards, to university degrees and worker qualifications. The EU estimated 
that there were more than 100,000 technical standards that required harmoniza-
tion in order to realize the benefits of a completely integrated market. Many of 
the technical standards involved rules that directly touch upon cultural identities. 
Nowhere was this more true than in the case of food processing. For example, 
there were discussions around the allowable level of bacteria in French cheese, the 
type of wheat required to make Italian pasta, the ingredients of German beer, and 
the oatmeal content of English bangers (breakfast sausages). In the end, the EU 
recognized that complete harmonization of standards would generate significant 
hostility and that the work required to agree on a set of common standards was 
beyond its capacity. Consequently, a combination of harmonization and mutual 
recognition of standards was adopted. In particularly sensitive cases, mutual rec-
ognition is the rule, but individual nations are allowed to keep their own national 
production requirements. For example, German beer must be certified as hav-
ing been made according to the German standards, but Germany must allow all 
brands of beers to be sold within its borders.
 As the discussion in Chapter 8 noted, standards do not have to be the same in 
order to create a single market, but the gains in economic efficiency that come from 
sharing the same standard can be significant. Shared standards permit manufactur-
ers to produce to one standard and to capture important economies of scale in the 
process. These economies also pass outside the EU, because U.S. or Japanese manu-
facturers share the benefits of being able to produce to one set of standards as well.
Value-Added Taxes  A third difficulty standing in the way of completely realizing 
the four freedoms is the issue of value-added taxes (VAT). These taxes function 
essentially like sales taxes and are levied by each of the EU members but at a wide 
variety of rates and coverage. When the SEA was first proposed in 1987, there 

372
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
were significant differences in the dependence of the member governments of the 
EU on value-added taxes, ranging from 19 to 35 percent of total government rev-
enue. The EC studied the United States to determine the effects of different rates 
of sales taxation on states sharing common borders and found that once the dif-
ference in sales taxes exceeded 5 percent, the higher tax state lost revenues, sales, 
and jobs to the neighboring lower tax state. In other words, a 5 percent difference 
was enough to cause consumers to cross state boundaries to make purchases.
VAT rates proved impossible to completely harmonize because they go to the 
heart of national political philosophy. High-tax countries expect the state to play a 
relatively greater role in national economic life, while low-tax countries are closer 
to the laissez-faire end of the political economy spectrum. The level of VAT, 
and the degree to which the national government depends on them, are in large 
part determined by the political philosophy of the nation. These philosophical 
attitudes, in turn, are shaped by economics as well as complex historical, cultural, 
and social factors.
The attempt to harmonize VAT was stymied by the inability to agree on a single 
rate. What was accomplished, however, was the creation of minimum and maxi-
mum rates that were set at 15 and 25 percent. Because the difference still exceeds 
the 5 percent differential that is the threshold at which high-tax countries lose 
revenue and sales, a number of controls were established to prevent revenue loss, 
even though these controls prevent the complete realization of the four freedoms.
Public Procurement  Public procurement is the purchase of goods and services 
by governments or government-owned enterprises, such as state-run television 
companies, utilities, or hospitals. Most nations tend to use procurement processes 
that discriminate in favor of nationally owned suppliers, although there are limits 
on their ability to do so if they belong to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Since 1970, the EU has attempted to eliminate discrimination in public pro-
curement, but this has proved difficult. It is a problem particularly in the areas of 
telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, railway equipment, and electrical equip-
ment. These are often the areas of economic activity where governments have 
state-owned enterprises or national firms that are considered critical to national 
prosperity and therefore receive significant support, including government’s pur-
chase of output.

The Erasmus∙ Program and Higher Education
It is easy to forget that during the first part of the twentieth century, the

ods in human history. Wars, depression, and genocide marked the history of 
every country until the end of World War II. How then did the countries that

comprise the EU manage to deepen their ties and to form an economic union? 
The answer is multidimensional and would take volumes, but one thing we 
know is that the EU built political, social, professional, and commercial net-
works across national borders. The process of building networks is ongoing, 
and student mobility is a fundamental component.
The most prominent effort is the Erasmus∙ Program. Erasmus+ began 
in 1987 as the Erasmus Program with the mission to promote student mobility 
in higher education through travel grants. In 2014, it combined a number of 
separate programs to become Erasmus+. It kept its focus on higher education 
and student mobility but has added support for joint master’s degrees, voca-
tional and professional training, promotion of EU studies around the world, 
and collaboration and support for sports. Erasmus+ university students receive 
a mobility grant that helps defray the cost of studying abroad, while units, 
courses, and curriculum are coordinated across different universities in order 
to reduce bureaucratic barriers to study abroad.
With an annual budget of around €2 billion ($2.2 billion), Erasmus has 
served as a base for higher education innovation and reform. It was key to the 
development of the Bologna Process, which is an agreement among the twenty-
eight EU countries, joined by twenty-one non-EU members, to form a Higher 
Education Area. Bologna created common structures for higher education 
around three degrees: bachelor’s, master’s, and doctorate. It has also created 
a common set of unit requirements for degrees and harmonized the recogni-
tion of credits. Bologna’s intent is to reduce the variability in higher education 
degrees by creating a common set of standards that will ensure quality.
The objectives of these programs are to increase student mobility, foster lan-
guage acquisition, train individuals for different vocations, reduce youth unem-
ployment, and increase the sophistication and international understanding of 
EU citizens. In the long run, the goal is to develop international networks among 
business people, intellectuals, government workers, and other educated labor.

Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
By 1989, planning for the implementation of the SMP was well under way. Europe 
had seen several years of economic expansion, and the excitement of the SMP 
seemed to signal that the time was right to consider some of the directives proposed 
in the Delors Report that had been set aside because they were seen as too complex 
to accomplish quickly. In 1990, the EC convened an Intergovernmental Conference 
on Economic and Monetary Union. The purpose of the conference was to bring 
together the leaders of the twelve nations to discuss the steps necessary to create 
a monetary union under a single currency. There were other issues on the agenda, 
but this was the one that attracted the most interest inside and outside the EU.
The Intergovernmental Conference continued through most of 1991. The final 
draft of the proposed agreement, called the Treaty on European Union, was com-
pleted in December in the Dutch town of Maastricht and became known as the 
Maastricht Treaty. Many of the provisions in the agreement were technical and 
put more control over health, education, cultural, and consumer safety issues in 
the hands of the EC. Most importantly, it defined the steps for achieving a com-
mon currency under the control of a European Central Bank (ECB) by 1999.
Achieving a single currency required each country to give up its ability to set its 
own monetary policy and instead accept whatever contractionary or expansionary 
policy the European Central Bank chooses. This is one of the most controversial 
features of the Maastricht Treaty. The controversy stems from the fact that there 
are economic risks associated with voluntarily giving up one of the few tools that 
governments have to counteract recessions. If, for example, Germany is booming, 
but Spain is in an economic slump, there is no common monetary policy that will 
be suitable to both countries. Germany would need a contractionary policy to cool 
off the economy and to prevent the ignition of inflation, while Spain would need 
an expansionary policy to create employment and growth. These controversies 
led to a public reception for the Maastricht Treaty very different from that for 
the SMP. Whereas citizens, businesses, and governments were solidly behind the 
SMP, support for the Maastricht Treaty was much more tentative.
Monetary Union and the Euro
The timetable for monetary union under a single currency was scheduled to 
occur in three separate stages. Stage one began in 1990 with the lifting of con-
trols on the movement of financial capital within the EU. Stage two began in 
1994 with the creation of the European Monetary Institute, based in Frankfurt, 
Germany. The institute was charged with the responsibility for coordinating 
the move to monetary union and gradually took on elements of a supranational 
central bank. The third stage began in 1999 with the phased-in introduction of 
the euro and the European Central Bank.
During stages one and two, nations were expected to bring their monetary and 
fiscal policies into harmony so that the introduction of the euro would not happen 
under wildly different sets of monetary and fiscal policies. To judge whether indi-
vidual national policies were in agreement, the EU developed a set of convergence 
criteria. Table 14.3 lists the specific monetary and fiscal variables that must be met 
to join the single currency and the target ranges for each.

Chapter 14    The European Union: Many Markets into One 
375
Initially, nations were expected to meet all five goals for monetary union. The 
experience of the first half of the 1990s, however, indicated that no nation, except 
perhaps Luxembourg, could consistently maintain each of these targets and that 
some countries would never meet them. For example, Italian and Belgian central 
government debts were well over 100 percent of their annual GDP, and there was 
no way to change this in the span of a few years. Some economists questioned 
why these particular criteria were chosen in the first place, because a country that 
can maintain its interest rates, debts, deficits, inflation, and exchange rates in the 
target range is already doing what the EU hopes to achieve with monetary union. 
In other words, meeting the convergence criteria was an indicator that the nation 
can do what monetary union does but without actually giving up its currency. Why, 
then, should countries surrender control over monetary policy, and why should 
they give up their national currency, particularly because there are hidden costs?
Costs and Benefits of Monetary Union
There is no doubt that there are benefits to having one currency in a market as 
large as the EU’s. For example, the average cost of currency conversion for travel-
ers is 2.5 percent of the amount converted. A trip from Portugal to Sweden, with 
stops along the way, can quickly eat up a sizable portion of one’s vacation money. 
Businesses fare much better, however, and if they buy in quantities greater than 
the equivalent of US$5 million, then the costs are a much smaller 0.05 percent, 
or $5,000 to convert $10 million. One estimate combining tourists and businesses 
puts the total costs of currency conversion at 0.4 percent of the EU’s GDP. This is 
not a trivial sum, but it is not huge, either. The 0.4 percent figure could be higher, 
however, given the costs of maintaining separate accounting systems and separate 
money management processes for the different currencies.
A second reason for desiring monetary union is to reduce the effects of 
exchange-rate uncertainty on trade and investment. Because orders for goods are 
often placed long before delivery occurs, traders face a good deal of uncertainty 
about their earnings (if they export) and their payments (if they import). A single

currency eliminates this uncertainty in the same way, for example, that California 
manufacturers can always be certain of the value of payments they will receive 
when they ship goods to New York. Recall from Chapter 10 that traders and 
investors can protect themselves from currency fluctuations with forward mar-
kets. Therefore, it should not be surprising that there is not much evidence that 
the elimination of currency fluctuations through a monetary union will increase 
cross-border trade and investment. On the other hand, tests of this idea are dif-
ficult because there are few examples of monetary unions.
Given these considerations, the benefits of a single currency appeared to be 
uncertain. The same could not be said for the potential costs. A single currency 
does not allow individual nations to pursue an independent monetary policy, in the 
same way that the state of New York cannot have a monetary policy that differs 
from that of California or the rest of the United States. It may be optimal to have a 
single currency and to eliminate the costs of currency conversion and other transac-
tion costs, as long as the regions in the single currency area have synchronized busi-
ness cycles and mobile labor forces. Synchronization of business cycles means that 
a single monetary policy might be appropriate. A mobile labor force guarantees 
that if some regions are not well synchronized, labor will move from the shrinking 
region to the expanding one, making the business cycles move together. If, how-
ever, the business cycles are not synchronized and labor is relatively immobile, then 
a single monetary policy will be right for some areas but wrong for others. Business 
cycles in Europe have never been synchronized, although the convergence crite-
ria were partly designed with this goal in mind. In addition, the SMP’s guarantee 
of freedom for labor mobility does not seem to have created significantly more 
continent-wide labor mobility given language and cultural differences.
Another major cost to joining a currency union is that countries lose their abil-
ity to use the exchange rate as a buffer against external shocks. This cost is particu-
larly apparent, and severe, for some EU members in the wake of the 2007–2009 
financial crisis. Without an ability to devalue or depreciate, countries with large 
current account deficits and/or with severe recessions are not able to depreciate 
their currencies to restore demand for their exports. Normally, the options for 
remedying a recession caused by a lack of demand are increased spending by 
households, businesses, government, or some combination of the three. Alter-
natively, countries can devalue to decrease domestic prices and increase their 
exports. In the case of Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland, a deep recession 
after the financial crisis meant that households and businesses were not spending. 
Governments, which had large deficits that opened in the wake of the financial 
crisis, were also unable to spend, so the only option for increasing demand was 
through exports. Because domestic prices made these countries’ goods uncom-
petitive in world markets, they were forced to adopt policies that reduced their 
domestic prices. This is called an internal devaluation and, unfortunately, can be 
done only through further cuts in demand, which allow prices to fall but worsen 
the recession. The euro crisis was the result, as discussed later in the chapter.
Given that currency unions can have large potential costs and that the EU is 
not an optimal currency area, it is curious that seventeen of twenty-seven member 

Chapter 14    The European Union: Many Markets into One 
377
governments agreed to join the euro project. Any explanation must take into 
account political forces as well as economic ones.
The Political Economy of the Euro
Why did monetary union push ahead, given that the SMP was not complete and 
that the EU is not an optimal currency area? Undoubtedly, there are many reasons, 
some more valid than others. One explanation is that EU leaders believed that the 
potential gains were large and that the potential costs would lessen as countries 
became more integrated. Another explanation is that EU leaders were swept up in 
the excitement of the SMP and wanted to push further integration. A third expla-
nation is that German reunification caused anxiety in some European capitals and 
this was a strategy to tie Germany ever more deeply into a pan-European project.
All of these explanations have their adherents, but one of the most widely 
voiced explanations is that the single currency became necessary after the removal 
of capital controls that took place under the SMP. Before 1990, many countries 
had controls on the movement of foreign exchange into their country. Regulatory 
measures such as taxes on foreign currency holdings, or on assets denominated 
in foreign currencies, and limitations on the uses of foreign currencies were wide-
spread. The removal of these controls made it easier to speculate in foreign cur-
rency markets. One outcome of the removal of capital controls was the turmoil of 
1992, when speculators became convinced that a number of currencies in the ERM 
would ultimately have to be devalued, prompting them to sell off large quantities 
of the currencies. During the sell-off, Portugal, Ireland, and Spain all devalued; 
Italy temporarily suspended participation in the ERM; and the United Kingdom 
dropped out permanently. Ultimately, the British pound fell by 25 percent from 
the speculative attacks. Soon after it left the ERM, there were several cases of 
firms that announced their intentions to close plants inside ERM countries and 
move to the United Kingdom where the depreciated pound reduced production 
costs. Philips Electronics, the giant Dutch firm, for example, closed plants in Hol-
land, and SC Johnson and the Hoover Company closed French plants, all in order 
to open new plants in the United Kingdom where French and Dutch currencies 
bought more land, labor, buildings, and machinery.
Political friction increases and cooperation decreases when one country loses 
jobs to another as a result of currency depreciations. The desire to reduce these 
types of frictions is the reason why the EMS, with its ERM, was created in 1979. 
Consequently, it is the reason why many believed that a flexible exchange rate 
system was not an option. Although floating exchange rates have the advantage of 
permitting the greatest amount of flexibility in a nation’s monetary and exchange 
rate policies, the EU’s economic integration plans have closed the door on the use 
of flexible exchange rate systems.
Given that flexible rates are ruled out, it seems logical to ask why the EU did 
not choose to institute a system of fixed exchange rates. In fact, the ERM acted 
somewhat like a fixed exchange rate system because it tied each country’s cur-
rency to a weighted average of the other currencies. Exchange rates were not 
completely fixed, however, and there were bands that the currencies tried to stay 

378
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
within. The EU’s problem with a fixed exchange rate system is that it lacked the 
ability to keep the currencies within their bands, let alone to completely fix them. 
International currency markets know that there are definite limits to the resolve 
and the resources of member countries trying to defend their currencies. The EU 
partially solved this by changing the bandwidths from {2.25 percent to {15 per-
cent, but this did nothing about the serious pressure against a currency that the 
United Kingdom and Italy experienced in 1992. If a country is not willing to defend 
its fixed rates when the costs grow high, then fixed rates are not really “fixed.”
C A S E  S T U D Y
The Financial Crisis of 2007–2009 and the Euro
In their masterful work on the economics of financial crises, This Time Is 
­Different, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff define four types of financial 
crises: banking crises, debt crises, currency crises, and inflation crises. The crisis 
of 2007–2009 was a banking crisis, both in the United States and in Europe, 
but in the European case, it evolved into a debt crisis. This is not uncommon, 
as banking crises and recessions often go hand-in-hand, and recessions depress 
tax collections and increase government spending on social support programs, 
health care, and pensions. Reinhart and Rogoff find that unemployment after 
a severe banking crisis rises 7 percentage points, on average, and GDP declines 
9.3 percent from its peak to its lowest point during the recession. When income 
falls that much, government budgets move into deficit as fewer taxes are col-
lected while government expenditures increase to support the unemployed and 
early retirements.
The euro area is no different from other regions that undergo a crisis, except 
that the individual countries do not have their own currencies and do not have 
a fiscal union. The five euro-crisis countries of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, 
and Italy all experienced increases in their budget deficits during the crisis. 
Figure 14.2 shows the average budget deficit or surplus, as a percent of GDP, 
from 2000 to 2006 and from 2007 to 2011. The first date is before the crisis and 
the second date is after. France and Germany are included because they are 
big countries and neither is considered risky. Germany, in particular, is the 
yardstick used to measure other countries’ performances.
The rise in deficits added to the debt levels of these countries. Figure 14.3 
shows the changing levels of debt, measured in relation to GDP. Irish debt was 
less than half of Germany’s when measured as a share of GDP until it exploded 
as a result of the banking crisis and the government’s decision to take respon-
sibility for the bad debt held by private banks. Spain’s debt is still significantly 
below Germany’s and was trending down until the crisis. Portugal’s debt level 
was well below Germany’s until 2007 and the onset of the crisis. Greece and 
Italy both had significantly higher debt levels, but both showed no significant

trend until 2008 when they began to increase. By 2009, at the depth of the 
recession caused by the banking crisis, both had higher debt levels that were 
expanding unsustainably. Reinhart and Rogoff show that after a banking crisis 
and the recession it causes, debt levels expand 86 percent within three years, 
on average. By this criterion, the euro-crisis countries did relatively better, 
with debt that expanded “only” 75 percent on average, most of which is due to 
Ireland’s 212 percent increase.
The problem for the euro-crisis countries is straightforward. First, the col-
lapse of a real estate bubble led to a banking crisis, which, in turn, led to a 
recession. The recession depressed tax revenue and expanded social spending, 
causing an increase in government budget deficits. In addition, governments 
were called on to bailout their banks in order to prevent the spread of the cri-
sis to the rest of the Eurozone where France, the Netherlands, Germany, and 
other countries owned large quantities of bonds issued by the euro-crisis coun-
tries. In a recession, fiscal and monetary policies should become expansionary 
in order to stimulate demand and to try to restore growth. The politics and 
economics of the single currency, however, put this option out of reach. First, 
governments had deficits that exceeded the agreed limit of 3 percent of GDP, 
and debt above 60 percent. Second, their economies are so depressed that bond 
markets are reluctant to lend except at relatively high interest rates, which 
only add to the debt burden. Third, governments were called on to bailout 
banks, putting even greater strains on government budgets and undermining 
further the confidence of investors in government debt. In effect, governments 
depended on the banks to buy their bonds which they needed to sell in order 
to bailout the banks. Some economists refer to this as a doom-loop—insolvent 
banks buying government debt so governments can bailout the insolvent banks. 
These conditions make fiscal policy unavailable and create the possibility of a 
sovereign default, or a government default on its debt.
In a sovereign nation with its own currency, the central bank can purchase 
the government debt with the creation of new money. That is, the central bank 
becomes the lender of last resort. In the Eurozone, however, there is no lender 
of last resort. This is not an oversight but was an intentional part of the design 
of the European Central Bank (ECB), which manages the euro. Designers of 
the euro feared that a lender of last resort would create a moral hazard for 
undisciplined governments if they thought central bank loans could be used 
to avoid budget cuts. Hence, the ECB was created with explicit “no bailout 
clause” which prohibits direct lending to governments in deficit. In 2012, the 
President of the ECB announced that he would do “whatever it takes” to solve 
the crisis in the Eurozone. Many observers interpreted this as a commitment to 
use the ECB indirectly as a lender of last resort, and pressures on the indebted 
governments temporarily lessened. In the long run, however, the absence of an 
official lender of last resort is a serious liability.
In other countries where similar conditions have prevailed, part of a solution 
has been to devalue the currency. For example, Latin American economies 

Chapter 14    The European Union: Many Markets into One 
381
in the 1980s had a decade-long debt crisis in which governments could not 
borrow and monetary policy became ineffective after it was used too expan-
sively. Countries could devalue their currencies, however, and this was one 
measure that helped restore competitiveness. The euro countries do not have 
this option, but they were encouraged to create an internal devaluation, which 
consists of falling domestic prices.
  Recall the formula for the real exchange rate from Chapter 10: 
Rr = Rn * (P*/P), where Rr is the real rate, Rn is the nominal rate, P* is the 
index of foreign prices, and P is the index of domestic prices. Because Rn cannot 
change for Greece or the other crisis countries, the only way to gain competitive-
ness is if P falls or P* rises. A rise in P* would mean that the stronger countries 
like Germany would have to have higher inflation, but German policy makers 
prefer to avoid that at all costs. That leaves a fall in domestic prices as the only 
option for gaining competitiveness, restoring demand, and returning to growth. 
The problem, however, is that a fall in domestic prices requires a deep reces-
sion. The costs of a recession in terms of lost output, high unemployment, and 
destroyed lives is a great burden plus it is not clear that the strategy works.
The internal devaluation policies are part of a package that is labeled 
­austerity economics and is often contrasted with an alternative, called growth 
economics. The debate is over the timing of policy measures. Economists agree 
that the crisis countries need to restore fiscal balance by addressing their bud-
get deficits and that they need economic growth. But do they opt for growth 
first—even if it widens the deficits—and where do they get the financing for 
expansionary fiscal policies; or do they restore balance first, and then tackle the 
growth problem with the hope that fiscal balance will generate confidence and 
bring investment and badly needed resources for financing the debt?
In the long run, discussion is focused on the need for more integration via 
the creation of a fiscal union. The United States is a currency union, as well, 
but it is also a fiscal union. Individuals pay taxes to the federal government, 
which provides infrastructure spending, social security, support for the unem-
ployed, healthcare, and other benefits. When one state is in recession, its citi-
zens still get their social security checks and federal transportation funding is 
still distributed even if the state budget is cut drastically. Some poorer states 
such as New Mexico, Mississippi, Alaska, Louisiana, and others receive far 
more in federal expenditures than they pay in taxes. The EU, in contrast, has 
no such mechanism for automatically redistributing significant proportions of 
income from rich countries to poor ones. In effect, each country in the EU 
has its own budget and its own expenditures, and the pooling of resources is 
limited because the EU budget is very small relative to the size of the national 
economies. When a recession strikes, there is no outside source of funding that 
helps maintain expenditures and demand for goods and services. A fiscal union 
would create the possibility for transfers from rich to poor countries, but the 
terms of the union are under debate, and the loss of national sovereignty that 
would be required is a serious obstacle for many citizens.

WIDENING THE EUROPEAN UNION
After the achievement of monetary union, one of the most pressing problems fac-
ing the EU was the timetable and conditions under which new members would 
be added.
New Members
Ten countries joined the EU in 2004, two more in 2007, and Croatia joined in 2013. 
Several additional countries, including Turkey, are considered candidates and 
have started negotiations for membership. Membership requires a stable demo-
cratic government, market-based economies, and formal adoption of the EU’s 
body of laws and regulations, known as the acquis communautaire.
For prospective members, many of the gains from trade have already been real-
ized because most countries have free trade agreements (FTA) with the EU, and 
some participate in the Schengen Agreement allowing free movement. Member-
ship, however, confers some additional benefits such as voice in EU governance, 
a more secure set of property rights, and perhaps additional investment and trade 
from the adoption of EU laws. As with any new integration agreement, there are 
some areas that are more difficult to resolve.
First, the EU budget contains a shrinking, but still extensive, set of farm support 
programs. Direct payments to farmers are about 30 percent of the EU budget, with 
another 11 percent for rural development. Much of this amount is administered 
under the Common Agricultural Program (CAP), which provides farmers with 
about 18.4 percent of their gross revenue (see the case study on agricultural sub-
sidies in Chapter 7, Table 7.3). Inclusion of new countries such as Turkey, with its 
large farm sector, is a difficult issue because the EU cannot offer the same level of 
support, and the creation of a two-tier system raises objections that new members 
do not have the same rights as existing ones.
Second, EU governance structures were not designed for twenty-eight mem-
bers, and additional ones only adds to the pressure to change the voting system. 
Voting, democracy, and governance are tied up with the third issue, which is the 
wide gap between the poorest and the richest members. The original six members 
of the EEC were more-or-less equal in their incomes, their level of institutional 
development, their security of property rights, and the rule of law. As the EU has 
expanded, however, it has inevitably drawn in members at different levels of eco-
nomic and political development. Formerly socialist economies such as Bulgaria 
and Romania had to make up a great distance between their legal institutions 
and the EU, and income gaps between the richest and poorest exacerbate the 
sense of social and economic distance between member countries, undermining 
the sense of solidarity and unity that the EU tries to create. In a similar vein, and 
as an illustration, the gap between the United States and Canada is small on most 
accounts, while the gap between the United States and Mexico is much greater 
and diminishes social trust between the two countries.
In the case of the EU, Bulgaria’s per capita income (purchasing power parity 
definition) is about 40 percent of Germany’s and Turkey’s is only slightly higher 

Chapter 14    The European Union: Many Markets into One 
383
at 43 percent. These differences are not insurmountable, but they create a variety 
of economic pressures on migration and institutional support payments, as well as 
social pressures related to trying to integrate countries at very different levels of 
economic development. The EU recognized this problem in its earlier efforts of 
widening and created regional funds and cohesion funds to try to ameliorate the 
differences and to close the gaps between less well-off members, such as Ireland 
and Portugal, and better off members, such as Sweden, France, and Germany. 
These efforts were mostly successful, but as the EU considers adding more mem-
bers, the pressures on the EU budget will grow.

Spain’s Switch from Emigration  
to Immigration
Spain’s period of highest emigration was from 1881 to 1930, when approxi-
mately 4.3 million people left. In 1910, its population was just under 20 million, 
so a loss of 4.3 million people was significant. The decade with the highest out-
migration was 1910 to 1920, when 1.3 million people, or well over 5 percent of 
the population, left.
Emigration was slowed by the world depression of the 1930s and World War 
II, but it began again in earnest after 1950. Unlike the earlier migrations, when 
the majority of migrants went to the Americas, increasing numbers headed 
for other countries in Central and Western Europe. In particular, France, 
Germany, and Switzerland were major recipients of Spanish citizens.
By the time Spain joined the EU in 1986, changes in the Spanish economy 
were reducing the supply-push forces that cause emigration. In 1950, Spain’s 
work force was nearly 50 percent agricultural, but by 1970 agriculture’s share 
of the labor force had fallen to less than 25 percent. With more industry came 
higher productivity and a shrinking wage gap with France, Germany, and even 
Switzerland. By the early 1990s, Spain’s economic success was turning it into a 
net attractor of migrants rather than a net sender. As a result, in the second half 
of the 1990s, immigration to Spain was accelerating, particularly from North 
Africa, South America, and Western Europe. Well-off Europeans discovered 
Spain’s Mediterranean coast, while Colombians, Ecuadorians, Moroccans, 
and Mauritanians came for jobs and wages that were significantly higher than 
what they could earn at home. By 2015, more than 1.2 million Spaniards lived 
outside Spain, but 5.9 million immigrants from other countries lived in Spain. 
Immigrants to Spain come from traditional senders such as Ecuador, Colombia, 
Peru, and other South American countries, but also from new EU entrants 
Romania and Bulgaria, North Africa (especially Morocco), and high-income 
Western European countries such as Germany, Great Britain, and France.
(continued)

Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
Immigration creates a reaction in most countries where the numbers of 
immigrants are large. The U.S.–Mexican case is famous, but there are numer-
ous others. Mexico itself resists immigration from Guatemalans on its south-
ern border, while Costa Ricans appreciate the hard work of Nicaraguans who 
come to pick the coffee crop, but they complain about their behavior and use 
of social services. Germans have a long love–hate relationship with Turks, the 
French with Algerian immigrants, and so on around the globe. Spain’s policy 
has been relatively accommodating toward immigrants, including six amnes-
ties for undocumented workers since 1990. Its last amnesty occurred in 2005 
and offered legal status to more than 700,000 foreigners. At the same time, 
Spain increased its program of border enforcement, which is aimed primarily at 
deterring Africans. It also built walls around Ceuta and Melilla, which are two 
Spanish territories located inside Morocco, and stepped up its coastal patrols.
Migration policies are fraught with uncertain side effects, but one of the 
most frequent consequences of increased enforcement at the border is a dis-
placement of immigrants to alternative points of entry. In the Spanish case, 
the walls around Ceuta and Melilla, together with increased vigilance along 
the coast, resulted in migrants moving their point of departure from Morocco 
to Western Sahara, a disputed territory on Morocco’s southern border. From 
there, migrants could reach the Canary Islands, which is Spanish territory. 
When Spain increased its patrols off the coast of Western Sahara, migrants 
moved their departure points south to Mauritania, and then farther south to 
Senegal when Spain began to target Mauritania.
It is difficult to name a country that has not gone through a period of high 
rates of out-migration at some point in its development. Europeans went to 
the Americas, U.S. citizens went west into what was Mexico and the frontier, 
Koreans spread around the globe, and the Japanese went to North and South 
America. Spain’s period of high emigration appeared to be over for good by 
the 1990s, but the financial crisis of 2007–2009 and its development into a debt 
crisis and deep recession have begun to generate a new wave. Young people, 
particularly those with skills and college degrees who cannot find work in a 
country where over half of all people under twenty-five are unemployed (esti-
mates are between 53.2 and 57.9 percent in 2014), have begun to leave. In all 
likelihood, this is a temporary shift due to a deep recession, but it could go on 
for a while.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHALLENGE OF THE FUTURE
As the EU looks toward the future, a number of challenges are visible. In the 
short to medium run, it must continue to create convergence in income and living 
standards between its poorest and its most well-off members, while finding a way 
to end the lingering crisis in some Eurozone countries. Over the medium run, it 
must also prepare for further widening, in particular for the possible accession of 

Chapter 14    The European Union: Many Markets into One 
385
Turkey, a large nation with per capita income levels about 40 percent (purchasing 
power parity) of the EU average. Finally, in the long run, it must adapt its econo-
mies and social support systems to prepare for a much older population.
One of the primary determinants of social spending in virtually all countries is 
the age structure of the population. As populations age, they need more health 
care, more pensions, and more long-term care. Each of these entails increases in 
public spending, and given that older citizens regularly vote, democracies usually 
respond to their demands. A small part of increased spending on services for the 
elderly will be offset by decreases in educational spending and unemployment 
benefits, as a smaller share of the total population will need schooling or experi-
ence involuntary unemployment. These savings, however, will not begin to offset 
the increases in social spending associated with an aging population. According 
to estimates carried out by the European Commission, if current policies are left 
in place, the average EU government will have to increase the public sector by  
10 percent simply to maintain its existing programs at their current levels.
Table 14.4 shows a projection of EU population (twenty-eight countries) 
through 2050. By then, the percent of the population of people aged sixty-five and 
over is expected to reach nearly 28 percent of the total, up from 18.8 percent in 
2015. The ability of governments to manage a much larger population of retired 
people will be constrained by the fact that after 2011, the working-age population 
began to decline, soon to be followed by the total number of people working. Fewer 
workers will put downward pressure on the rate of economic growth and constrain 
the development of new resources for supporting an aging population. At the same 
time, the number of available workers to support the production of social services 
needed by the aging population will be both relatively and absolutely smaller.
Migration can play a role at the margin to ameliorate the changes, but it is 
unlikely that migration alone will have a major impact. Simply to return the esti-
mated 2050 working age population (15–64) to its 2015 estimates would require the 
immigration of more than 46 million people, or about 9 percent of the predicted

2050 population. And this still would not compensate for the absolute increase 
in the number of people 65 and over. Nevertheless, given the potential for EU 
expansion beyond its current members along with the migration pressures emanat-
ing from North Africa and elsewhere, any assumption about the capacity of the 
EU to absorb migrants may turn out to be false.
The Commission of the EU has begun to analyze trends and to recommend 
changes to pension and health care systems. For example, several countries have 
begun to experiment with linking pensions to changes in life expectancy, and to 
encourage workers to postpone retirement. Demographic changes are clearly vis-
ible and well understood; whether or not the EU and the national governments 
respond will depend on the flexibility and adaptability of their electorates.
Summary
■
■The twenty-eight-member EU was created in several stages. The earliest 
stage involved agreements over open trade for coal and steel (ECSC), fol-
lowed by cooperation over the peaceful development of nuclear energy 
(Euratom) and a free-trade agreement.
■
■The main institutions of the European Union (EU) are the European Com-
mission, the Council of the European Union, and the European Parliament. 
The roles of these institutions have evolved.
■
■The Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 and was put into effect in 1958, 
creating a six-country, free-trade area that was phased in gradually over the 
next ten years.
■
■The next wave of deepening was the creation of the European ­Monetary 
System (EMS) and the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1979, linking 
­exchange rates.
■
■Following the EMS, the Single European Act was passed, creating a common 
market by 1993. While preparations were taking place for the implementa-
tion of the Single Market Program (SMP), the Treaty on EU was signed in 
1991 and approved by the national governments in late 1993.
■
■The Treaty on European Union created a common currency. In preparation, 
a set of convergence criteria was developed with targets for interest rates, 
inflation, government spending, and government debt.
■
■While the EU was undergoing its several rounds of deepening integration, 
it was also widening membership to nearly all of Western Europe. Between 
1958 and 1995, it expanded from the original six members to fifteen. In 2004, 
ten more countries joined, followed by three more from 2007–2013.
■
■Eastward expansion of the EU created problems in the areas of agricultural 
policy, governance, and income differences.

INTRODUCTION: DEFINING A “LATIN American” ECONOMY
Latin America stretches from Tijuana on the U.S.–Mexico border to Cape Horn at the 
southern tip of South America. Within this vast geographic area lies such a diversity 
of languages and cultures that any definition of Latin America must have exceptions 
and contradictions. For example, Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary defines 
the region as Spanish America and Brazil, a standard view that leaves out a few 
small countries in Central and South America (Belize, Suriname, Guyana, and French 
Guiana) and the island nations of the Caribbean that were outside the region of 
Spanish and Portuguese settlement. Webster’s second definition—all of the Americas 
south of the United States—is more inclusive but purely geographical. Perhaps it is 
less important to give a precise definition than it is to recognize the variety of physical 
geographies, cultures, and income levels that coexist within any definition. In fact, the 
variety is so great that it is worth asking whether these nations can truly constitute a 
single world region. In other words, what is the “Latin American” experience, and 
how does it allow us to group together nations as different as Argentina, with its 
European culture and relative prosperity, and Guatemala, with its indigenous culture 
and rural poverty?

Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
The diversity within Latin America should make us careful not to ­overgeneralize. 
Nevertheless, there are several common themes shared by all, or nearly all, the 
nations in the region. First, there are common historical threads, beginning with 
the fact that many of these nations share a heritage of Spanish and Portuguese 
colonization and a common linguistic base. In some countries, however, the lan-
guages of indigenous people are important as well. A second part of their shared 
histories is that many Latin American countries gained their national indepen-
dence from Spain and Portugal during the nationalist revolutions of the early and 
middle nineteenth century. This differentiates their experiences from the colonial 
ones of Africa and Asia, and implies that the national identities of Latin Ameri-
cans are perhaps deeper than in other parts of the developing world.
During the first wave of globalization in the late nineteenth century, many 
countries were connected to the world economy through exports of agricultural 
and mineral commodities. Then, in the 1930s, the Great Depression caused many 
nations to shift their policies away from an outward-looking export orientation 
toward an inward-looking, targeted industrial strategy. At the same time, state-led 
industrialization began to encourage more manufacturing along with a new strat-
egy that came to be known as import substitution industrialization. More recently, 
most nations were borrowers in the 1970s, and suffered through a prolonged debt 
crisis in the 1980s. From that point forward, the region began a wide-ranging set 
of economic policy reforms, similar in scope to the transformation of Central 
and Eastern Europe after the collapse of communism. Finally, in the twenty-first 
century, several countries have grown impatient with the economic reforms of the 
1990s and have turned toward more interventionist policies, with more reliance 
on the state to direct and support the economy.
In this chapter, we examine the origins and extent of the economic crisis that 
hit Latin America in the 1980s and analyze the responses. Before we examine the 
crisis of the 1980s and the economic reforms of the late 1980s and 1990s, we must 
first step back and look at the long-run performance of the economies of Latin 
America. Then, when the severe problems of the 1980s are viewed in context, it 
is easier to understand the policy shifts of the 1990s and after.
POPULATION, INCOME, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH
Table 15.1 is a snapshot of the current levels of income and population. Nations 
are grouped according to their membership in important regional trade agree-
ments, and per person totals are weighed by the population size of the individual 
nations in the group. In 2014, more than 590 people lived in the eighteen coun-
tries included in Table 15.1 and they produced gross domestic product (GDP) 
equivalent to $5,850 billion U.S. dollars. Individual countries ranged in population 
from under 4 million (Panama and Uruguay) to more than 200 million (Brazil), 
while incomes varied from under $5,000 per person in the least well-off countries 
(Honduras and Nicaragua) to more than $20,000 per person in the most well-off 
(Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Panama). If Table 15.1 included data for all the 

Chapter 15    Trade and Policy Reform in Latin America 
391
individual countries, four countries would account for over 70 percent of the total 
population and nearly 80 percent of GDP. In order of population size, they are 
Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina. Indeed, Brazil and Mexico together are 
more than 55 percent of the population and 63 percent of the GDP.
For long stretches of the twentieth century, Latin America was one of the 
­fastest-growing regions of the world. In particular, from 1900 to 1960, the region’s 
real GDP per capita grew as fast as or faster than that of Europe, the United States, 
or Asia. Individual experiences varied, but most countries saw adequate to excel-
lent growth along with rising living standards. After World War II, most countries 
in Latin America experienced good rates of growth, as did most regions in the 
world, and the two largest countries, Brazil and Mexico, had remarkable increases 
in their per capita income levels. Circumstances began to change as world eco-
nomic growth slowed in the 1970s, and Latin American experiences became more 
varied. Some countries grew faster in the 1970s and some grew slower, but nearly 
all relied more heavily on government expenditures to stimulate growth. The 
undoing of this period was the onset of the Latin American debt crisis (1982–1989), 
which is described later in the chapter. The Debt Crisis turned the 1980s into a Lost 
Decade, sovereign debt problems were compounded by negative growth, banking 
crises, currency crises, and hyperinflation. The Debt Crisis of the 1980s brought an

end to nearly fifty years of economic policy, as one country after another tried bold 
new experiments in their search for a way to restore economic growth.
IMPORT SUBSTITUTION INDUSTRIALIZATION
LO 15.1	 Describe the strengths, weaknesses, and reasons for import 
substitution industrialization.
Economic policy reforms began in the 1980s as a response to that decade’s Debt 
Crisis. They brought the demise of a state-led economic development strategy 
that had been in place since the 1930s in most countries and they brought the rise 
of more market-oriented policies. Prior to the economic reforms, countries were 
private market economies, but they used a heavy dose of state intervention to 
determine key elements of policy, such as the allocation of credit, investment deci-
sions, and trade patterns. The most important part of this strategy occurred in the 
trade arena, where countries adopted the economic development strategy known 
as import substitution industrialization (ISI). After World War II, the theory of 
ISI was grafted onto a broader state-led development strategy and every country 
in Latin America, as well as many outside the region, adopted ISI policies. In Latin 
America, ISI policies were brought to an end in the 1980s and 1990s as countries 
moved away from state-led development strategies and began to look for ways to 
harness market forces to promote economic development. This shift from state-
to-market was encouraged by a variety of factors, including the long Debt Crisis 
of the 1980s and a worldwide shift toward greater reliance on market forces.
Origins and Goals of ISI
From the second half of the nineteenth century until the middle of the twentieth 
century, most of Latin America relied on exports of agricultural commodities 
(sugar, bananas, coffee, cotton, and grains) and minerals (petroleum, silver, cop-
per, and tin) to earn foreign revenue. These export sectors were often developed 
or controlled by foreign capital and had few economic linkages to the domestic 
economy, functioning instead as foreign enclaves within the nation. In cases where 
the export sector was domestically owned, it usually brought wealth to a relatively 
small number of people and added greatly to the inequality of power and money 
pervasive in Latin American society.
World War I and the Great Depression of the 1930s disrupted the flow of Latin 
American exports and severely reduced export earnings. World War II partially 
reversed this trend, as many countries turned to Latin America for the minerals 
and foodstuffs they could no longer make at home due to the war, but at war’s end 
there was another drop in demand for Latin America’s commodities. In the late 
1940s, a young Argentine economist, Raul Prebisch, and a German exile, Hans 
Singer, developed a theory to explain the loss of foreign exchange earnings. In 
their view, the fall in demand for Latin American commodities was not solely due 
to the end of the war, but was also a long-run tendency for the prices of primary 

Chapter 15    Trade and Policy Reform in Latin America 
393
commodities to fall. Singer and Prebisch argued that coffee, tin, copper, bananas, 
and other primary commodity exports would inevitably experience price declines 
relative to the prices paid for manufactured goods.
In trade analysis, the ratio of average export prices to average import prices is 
called the terms of trade (TOT):
TOT = (Index of export prices)/(Index of import prices)
Latin America exported raw materials and imported finished goods, so the 
Prebisch-Singer prediction was that the terms of trade for the region would 
decline. For obvious reasons, this view was labeled export pessimism.
The reasoning behind export pessimism included both statistical studies and 
economic theory. Statistical analysis showed raw material prices falling over peri-
ods as long as several decades. More recent analysis shows that while prices may 
fall for extended periods of time, there is no long-run trend up or down. Economic 
theory holds that as incomes rise, people spend a smaller share of their overall 
income on foodstuffs and other raw-material-based goods such as textiles and 
apparel, and they spend more on manufactured items. Consequently, the demand 
for raw materials declines in relation to the demand for manufactured goods. Note, 
however, that this effect does not necessarily lead to a decline in the terms of trade 
for raw material producers, as productivity increases in manufacturing can over-
whelm increases in demand and push down the real prices of manufactured goods.
Export pessimism formed the basis of orthodox economic policy from roughly 
the 1950s through the 1970s. As the head of the United Nations’ Economic 
­Commission on Latin America (ECLA, or CEPAL in Spanish), Prebisch guided 
economic policies throughout Latin America and reinforced a shift that had begun 
with the destruction of trade in the 1930s. The loss of markets during the Great 
Depression temporarily forced Latin America away from dependence on raw 
material exports and toward industrial development through the production of 
manufactured goods that substitute for imports—hence, the name import sub-
stitution industrialization (ISI). Ironically, domestic production of manufactured 
import substitutes required the importation of large quantities of capital goods 
(machinery and parts), and in order to earn the revenues needed to buy these 
imports, most nations continued to depend on raw material exports in the decades 
after World War II. Primary commodities still make up a significant share of 
today’s exports from Latin America, and countries have benefitted greatly from 
China’s strong demand for raw materials and foodstuffs, and also suffered as Chi-
nese growth began to slow.
ISI is a form of industrial policy that focuses on those industries that produce 
substitutes for imported goods. According to Prebisch and Singer, the inevitable 
decline in the terms of trade for primary commodities means that the biggest con-
straint on industrial development is the shortage of foreign exchange. Lower export 
prices mean that countries find it harder and harder to earn the foreign exchange 
they need in order to buy the machinery and other capital goods they cannot pro-
duce themselves. One of the most important roles of import substitution is to reduce 
the need for foreign exchange used to buy goods that could be made at home.

394
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
ISI theorists argued that a country should begin by producing inexpensive and 
relatively simple consumer items, such as toys, clothing, food products (e.g., bever-
ages and canned goods), and furniture. Gradually, the focus of industrial targeting 
should move on to more complex consumer goods (e.g., appliances and autos) and 
intermediate industrial goods (e.g., pumps, generators, basic metals). In the third 
stage, complex industrial goods would be produced (e.g., chemicals, electronic 
equipment, machine tools).

Criticisms of ISI
The economic tools for implementing ISI are the same as those for industrial 
­policies discussed in Chapter 5. These include a variety of different types of govern-
ment support, from subsidies of all kinds to trade protection and monopoly power 
in the domestic market. In retrospect, ISI generated a number of unintended con-
sequences that caused inefficiencies and wasted resources. Among the many criti-
cisms that have been leveled at ISI are the following: (1) governments misallocated 
resources when they became too involved in production decisions; (2) exchange 
rates were often overvalued; (3) policy was overly biased in favor of urban areas; 
(4) income inequality worsened; and (5) ISI fostered widespread rent seeking.
Foremost among the problems of ISI are those related to an overconfident 
belief in the ability of the state to direct resources efficiently into their best uses. In 
the 1950s and 1960s, it was often assumed that market failures were far more com-
mon in developing nations than in industrial ones, and that one of the main goals of 
any state should be to correct these through selective and careful state intervention 
in the economy. In this context, ISI can be interpreted as a set of policies in which 
government uses its economic and political power to improve on the market.
Many economists think that ISI overestimates the technical ability of govern-
ment officials to identify market failures and their solutions (see Chapter 5’s dis-
cussion of industrial policies). It also assumes that government officials are selfless 
individuals who ignore political considerations and focus only on economic effi-
ciency and what is best for the nation as a whole. This model of political decision 
making caused an under-emphasis on problems related to the implementation of 
economic policies, such as corruption and the lobbying power of economic elites. 
It also failed to take into account the slow accumulation of special provisions, 
favors, and economic inefficiencies that built up over time when policies were 
heavily influenced by politics. This was magnified by the inequality in wealth and 
income throughout Latin America, where powerful interest groups were able to 
use ISI policies to their own benefit rather than in the national interest.
A second problem of ISI was the persistence of overvalued exchange rates. 
Overvaluation was a deliberate policy in some countries, while in others it was a 
chronic problem stemming from the maintenance of a fixed exchange rate under 
conditions of higher inflation than those in the countries’ trading partners. As a 
deliberate policy, overvaluation of the exchange rate accomplished several goals. 
In particular, it made it easier for the targeted industries to obtain the imported 
capital goods they needed. It also helped to maintain political alliances between the 
urban working classes and the political parties in power by providing access to rela-
tively less expensive foreign goods. When governments were forced to ­depreciate 
in the 1980s and 1990s, they often lost the political support of the urban classes.
Although overvalued exchange rates had some benefits, they also had costs. 
Most importantly, they made it difficult to export because they raised the foreign 
price of domestic goods. This hurt the agricultural and traditional export sectors, 
directed capital away from agriculture, and contributed to low productivity and 
income in rural areas.. Overvalued exchange rates also hurt industries that did 

396
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
not produce substitutes for imports because they made it less profitable to export. 
They also made foreign machinery less expensive and caused industrial invest-
ment to be too capital intensive and insufficiently labor intensive. Consequently, 
industry did not create enough new jobs to absorb the growing urban labor force. 
Furthermore, because most industry is located in urban areas, government invest-
ments in infrastructure improvements—such as transportation, communication, 
and water—were heavily targeted toward cities and their environs. As a result, 
subsistence farmers and their families did not benefit from, or contribute to, 
national economic development, and Latin America continued to have the high-
est levels of inequality of any region in the world.
In addition to a persistent tendency toward overvalued exchange rates, ISI trade 
and competition policies were heavily protectionist and often favored the creation 
of domestic monopolies. The lack of foreign and domestic competition meant that 
manufacturing was often inefficient, uncompetitive, and inwardly focused. With 
profits from a protected domestic market, many producers had no incentives to 
invest in modern equipment, further reinforcing the lack of competitiveness of 
their products. It is ironic that as a consequence of ISI many countries became 
more vulnerable to economic shocks that originated outside of Latin America. This 
was precisely the opposite effect from the one that motivated ISI in the first place.
A final problem of ISI is the development of widespread rent-seeking behav-
ior. When governments intervene in the planning and directing of industrial 
­development, they give government officials a wide range of valuable privileges to 
distribute. These include the many subsidies and licenses that are a part of ISI poli-
cies. For example, in order to protect the domestic market and to ensure access to 
needed imports, governments often required import licenses. At the same time and 
in order to make imports less costly, they provided foreign exchange to importers 
at subsidized prices. When government policy creates something of value, such as 
the license to import or a subsidy to buy foreign exchange, the private sector will 
spend resources to obtain it. In the absence of strong institutions to ensure the 
independence of the bureaucracy—and, often, even when strong institutions are 
present—bribes and corruption become a part of the decision making. Ultimately, 
some decisions are made for the wrong reasons, and economic waste is the result.

ISI in Mexico
The Mexican constitution of 1917 established the power and the responsibility 
of the federal government to intervene in the economy in order to act as the 
leading agent of economic growth and as the referee of social conflict. This role 
was not institutionalized inside the Mexican government until the Mexican rev-
olution was consolidated in the 1930s under the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas.
In order to lead and direct economic growth, government could legitimately 
claim the need to be powerful—otherwise, powerful social classes could resist 

Chapter 15    Trade and Policy Reform in Latin America 
397
the government’s directives and initiatives, particularly those with distributional 
goals or consequences. Therefore, economic policy served not only to meet the 
needs of the country for economic growth and a fairer distribution but also to 
increase the political power of government. Mexico nationalized its oil indus-
tries in 1938, and throughout the twentieth century a number of sectors were 
nationalized and turned into state-run monopolies (telephones, airlines, banks, 
railroads, and mineral development companies). The use of the government 
budget in this manner guaranteed access to investment funds, while monopoly 
markets ensured that the favored firms would succeed, at least within the nation.
The government also offered loans and loan guarantees to many firms in 
targeted industries. Loans and loan guarantees helped firms obtain capital at 
interest rates that were below market rates. Similarly, the government sold 
foreign exchange at artificially low prices to targeted firms that needed to buy 
imports. Mexican exporters were required to convert their foreign exchange 
earnings into pesos at an overvalued peso rate—too few pesos per dollar—
which made exporting relatively less profitable; the government then sold the 
cheaply acquired foreign exchange to targeted industries. In effect, exporters 
were subsidizing the development of the targeted industries.
Unlike many ISI nations, Mexico limited foreign investment. Like most ISI 
nations, however, when investment was permitted (e.g., autos), performance 
requirements were placed on the foreign firms. A common requirement was 
that the foreign firm balance its foreign exchange requirements so that each 
peso of imports was matched by a peso of export earnings. Further interven-
tions occurred in the area of commercial policy where import licenses limited 
many types of imports. Recall that import licenses are essentially quotas. By 
the 1970s about 60 percent of all imports were subject to licensing.
From 1950 to 1973, Mexico’s real GDP per capita grew at the rate of 3.1 per-
cent per year. By comparison, the United States grew 2.2 percent per year; the 
fourteen largest Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development 
(OECD) nations grew 3.5 percent per year; and growth in the six largest Latin 
American economies was 2.5 percent. At the same time that the economy was 
undergoing relatively rapid economic growth, industrialization was changing the 
structure of the economy. Mexico’s manufacturing sector expanded from 21.5 
percent of GDP to 29.4 percent. Overall, import substitution may have had many 
problems, but it cannot be called a failure. Judged by the economic growth of its 
partners, or by its own growth before or after, Mexico attained very healthy rates 
of growth. In part, ISI was relatively more successful in Mexico than it was other 
parts of Latin America because it is a large country, where producers can obtain 
economies of scale. Brazil, for example, had similar or even greater successes.
Growth began to slow in the 1970s, as it did in many parts of the world. One 
widely shared view is that Mexico’s growth began to stall because the country 
was running out of easy targets for industrial development. Light manufactur-
ing and simple consumer goods industries were relatively easy to start, and the 
conversion of a part of the nation’s economy from subsistence agriculture to

MACROECONOMIC INSTABILITY  
AND ECONOMIC POPULISM
LO 15.2	 Explain the strategy and performance of economic populism.
Many economists are convinced that while ISI policies are suboptimal, they had 
less of a direct effect in creating the economic crisis of the 1980s than misguided 
macroeconomic policies. The reasons are relatively straightforward. ISI policies 
simple manufacturing made growth rates look good. The next stages required 
more sophisticated manufacturing, however, and were relatively harder to start 
growing. According to this view, Mexico ran out of simple industries to start 
and inevitably had a harder time producing more sophisticated goods that were 
further from its comparative advantage.
In spite of rapid economic growth during the 1950s and 1960s, poverty and 
income inequality continued. Large numbers of Mexicans, many of them indig-
enous people living in rural areas, did not participate in the growth of the econ-
omy. This is evidenced by the fact that in the 1980s a large part of agriculture 
was still at a subsistence level, using 26 percent of the nation’s labor force to 
produce just 9 percent of the nation’s GDP. The urban bias in Mexico’s devel-
opment strategy turned Mexico City into one of the largest metropolises in the 
world, with more than fifteen million people in the greater metropolitan area 
by the late 1980s. The sensational growth and crowding of people and industry 
into the basin that holds Mexico City resulted in serious pollution problems.
The relationship of ISI to the debt crisis of the 1980s is complicated, but most 
economists think that poor macroeconomic management and external shocks 
stemming from the collapse of oil prices and rising interest rates played a far 
larger role than ISI. Certainly, ISI policies expanded the role of the federal 
government in economic activity and increased government expenditures and 
borrowing during the 1970s. Nevertheless, overall economic growth remained 
fairly robust until the mid-1970s. One view is that the easy gains of ISI were 
gone by the 1970s, and in order to keep growth on track, Mexican presidents 
used their power over public finances to increase expenditures dramatically. 
At first the government argued that it could easily afford to borrow in for-
eign capital markets because the nation became a major oil exporter in 1978 
and had high potential oil export earnings. Ultimately, the government’s fiscal 
policies generated enormous public sector deficits, fears of devaluation, and 
capital flight. By 1982, a year after the price of oil fell, the nation had run out 
of international reserves and could no longer service its international debt. If 
the government had not resorted to unsustainable macroeconomic policies, it 
is less likely that the country would have fallen into the debt crisis in 1982 and 
subsequently rejected its ISI policies by the late 1980s.

involve trade barriers and government support for selected industries. Collec-
tively, these policies may lower a nation’s income by a few percentage points, but 
they rarely lead to a full-blown economic crisis. Faulty macroeconomic policies, 
on the other hand, often lead to hyperinflation, depression, and balance of pay-
ments crises. In addition, while most of Latin America used ISI policies from the 
1950s through the 1980s, economic growth remained at fairly high levels for most 
countries until the early 1980s when growth turned negative in nearly all countries. 
While it is possible that the 1980s crisis was the culmination of several decades of 
ISI policies, it is certain that the crisis was directly linked to the faulty macroeco-
nomic policies of the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Populism in Latin America
Many Latin America specialists blame the faulty macroeconomic policies of the 
region on populist or economic populist political movements that use economic 
tools to obtain support from labor and domestically oriented business, or to isolate 
rural elites and foreign interests. Examples of populist leaders abound: in Argen-
tina, Juan Perón (1946–1955 and 1973–1976) and Raúl Alfonsín (early 1980s); in 
Brazil, Getúlio Vargas (1951–1954), João Goulart (1961–1964), and José Sarney 
(1985–1990); in Chile, Carlos Ibáñez (1952–1958) and Salvador Allende (1970–
1973); in Peru, Fernando Belaúnde Terry (1963–1968), Juan Velasco Alvarado 
(1968–1975), and Alan García (1985–1990); in Mexico, Luis Echeverría (1970–1976) 
and José Lopez Portillo (1976–1982); in Venezuela, Hugo Chavez (1998–2013). 
Populist movements in Latin America share nationalistic ideologies and a focus 
on economic growth and income redistribution. Before the 1970s, populist tenden-
cies did not cause large macroeconomic imbalances and government budgets were 
more likely to be balanced or near balance, inflation was controlled, and trade 
deficits did not exist or they were manageable. Beginning in the 1970s, however, 
a new breed of populists began to take power. This group, often called economic 
populists, was more likely to use expansionary fiscal and monetary policies without 
regard for the importance of inflation risks, budget deficits, and foreign exchange 
constraints. They were much more aggressive in using government spending to pro-
mote growth, and much less cautious in avoiding the pitfalls of too much spending.
Economic populism is usually triggered by three initial conditions. First, there 
is a deep dissatisfaction with the status quo, usually as a result of slow growth or 
recession. Second, policymakers reject the traditional constraints on macro policy. 
Budget deficits financed through printing money are justified by the existence of 
high unemployment and idle factories, which offer room for expansion without 
inflation. Third, policymakers promise to raise wages while freezing prices and to 
restructure the economy by expanding the domestic production of imported goods, 
thereby lessening the need for foreign exchange. In the words of one analyst, the 
policies call for “reactivating, redistributing, and restructuring” the economy.
Early in the populist regime, there is a vindication of the policies. The economic 
stimulus of government expenditures and newly created money leads to rising growth 
rates and rising wages. Soon, however, bottlenecks begin to appear. For example, 

400
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
construction firms run out of particular inputs, such as cement or specialized steel 
products, and manufacturing firms cannot find the parts they need to repair their 
machinery. Prices begin to rise, and the budget deficit grows. In the next stage, infla-
tion begins an extreme acceleration, and shortages become pervasive throughout the 
economy. The budget falls into serious deficit as policies become unsustainable, and 
wage increases cease keeping up with inflation. In the final stage, countries experi-
ence massive capital flight as fears of a devaluation develop. The flight of capital out 
of the country depresses investment and further depresses real wages.
In the end, real wages are often lower than before the cycle began, and there is 
an international intervention under the sponsorship of the IMF, which is designed 
to stop the high inflation and end a balance of payments crisis. Typically, the IMF 
oversees the implementation of stabilization and structural reform policies that 
call for serious budget cuts, a slowdown in the growth of the money supply, a 
reduction in trade barriers, and in general, greater reliance on market mechanisms 
and less government intervention. While these stages of the populist cycle are an 
idealization, they capture the essence of the populist experience as it has occurred 
in many Latin nations.
C A S E  S T U D Y
Economic Populism in Peru, 1985–1990
Alan García became president of Peru for the first time in July, 1985. After 
leaving in disgrace in 1990 he spent several years reforming his image and was 
re-elected in 2006, serving until 2011. His first presidency is a textbook case of the 
problems of economic populism, while his second presidency is widely regarded 
as successful. Before his first election in 1985 and as part of the fallout from the 
debt crisis, the country suffered through a serious recession in 1983. By 1985, 
it was on the mend, and García began a program to raise real wages in order 
to stimulate demand and redistribute income (“reactivate, redistribute, restruc-
ture”). In 1986 and 1987, the economy responded to the stimulus of higher con-
sumption with robust growth and without inflation. The lack of inflation was due 
to the presence of idle factory capacity and unemployed workers. By mid-1987, 
however, some essential imported inputs became scarce and began to act as bot-
tlenecks on further increases in production. Consequently, inflation rekindled. 
The exchange rate was a crawling peg that was periodically devalued, but because 
inflationary price increases were greater than the exchange rate devaluations, 
there was an inevitable appreciation in the real exchange rate and a significant 
increase in the current account deficit. Table 15.2 illustrates the course of the 
major macroeconomic variables and real wages during García’s presidency.
Rising budget deficits, trade deficits, and inflation should have been enough 
to cause a cautious government to reign in expenditures; but instead, García 
responded by nationalizing the property of the financial services sector (banks 
and insurance companies) and expanding credit subsidies for favored groups in 

Chapter 15    Trade and Policy Reform in Latin America

the agricultural and industrial sectors. In 1988, the government tried to tackle 
the problem of inflation through devaluations and price freezes, but in order to 
protect incomes and to bring relative prices into agreement, it simultaneously 
permitted selected price increases and compensating wage increases.
By 1990, the economy reached the deepest point in its recession. In July, a 
new government took office and implemented a relatively orthodox stabiliza-
tion program of fiscal and monetary austerity to end inflation and curb the 
budget deficit. By then, however, real wages were well below the level they 
had attained when the previous government took power in 1985.
THE DEBT CRISIS OF THE 1980s
LO 15.3	 Give the main reasons for the Debt Crisis of the 1980s and analyze its 
relationship to ISI.
In August 1982, Mexico announced that it lacked the international reserves it 
needed to pay the interest and principal due on its foreign debt. Mexico was not 
the first country to declare its inability to service its debt, but it was the biggest 
up to that point. Its announcement soon led to the realization that a number of 
other countries, including most of Latin America, were in similar circumstances. 
Thus began the Lost Decade.
Proximate Causes of the Debt Crisis
In Mexico’s case, the collapse of oil prices in 1981 undermined its ability to earn the 
revenue it needed to service its debt. The problem was compounded by the fact that 
a significant portion of its debt was owed in dollars at variable interest rates and

Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
that efforts to combat inflation in the United States and elsewhere had resulted in 
a higher level of world interest rates. Consequently, interest payments on Mexico’s 
debt rose at the same time that the nation’s ability to earn dollars shrank.
The collapse of oil prices in 1981 and the rise in world interest rates were not 
the only external shocks to the economies of Latin America. In 1981–1982, the 
world’s industrial economies entered a deep recession that reduced world demand 
and prices for many of the raw materials produced in Latin America and else-
where. In Mexico’s case, oil was the critical commodity, but a number of other 
primary commodity exports experienced a similar decline in their world price.
The price decline for Latin America’s exports and the rise in interest rates were 
significant parts of the mix of events that led up to the debt crisis. These external 
economic shocks probably would not have caused a generalized debt crisis without 
some additional factors, however. Historically, debt crises are often triggered by a 
set of external shocks and are preceded by an acceleration of international lend-
ing. In Latin America’s case, the lending occurred between 1974 and 1982. Added 
to these two factors was the complicating problem of mismanagement of national 
macroeconomic policies in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
During the 1970s, financial institutions in London, New York, and elsewhere 
were awash in money that they were eager to lend. The rise in oil prices in 1973 
and 1974, and again in 1979, led to an enormous expansion of bank deposits by the 
oil-rich nations of the world. Banks aggressively sought new borrowers beginning 
in 1974. For Latin America and the Caribbean, long-term, publicly guaranteed 
debt rose more than sevenfold between 1973 and 1983. The sudden acceleration in 
commercial bank lending and the rise in the amount of debt made the economies 
vulnerable to a sudden and unforeseen economic shock.
Table 15.3 shows the size of the debt for some of the most heavily indebted 
countries after the first year of the crisis. The second column of numbers expresses 
the debt in net terms (gross debt minus debt owed by foreigners) as a percentage 
of GDP. The third column shows the net interest payments owed as a percentage 
of exports of goods and services. This is a useful indicator because nations ulti-
mately have to pay the interest on their international debts out of the revenues 
they earn from their exports. What we see is that between 10 and 63 percent of the 
revenue earned by exports went to pay interest and, consequently, was unavailable 
for purchasing imports or for investing domestically.
Responses to the Debt Crisis
Initially, most analysts in the United States and in international financial institu-
tions such as the IMF perceived the debt crisis to be a temporary, short-run liquid-
ity problem. Under this assumption, the reasonable response is to increase capital 
flows to Latin America and other indebted regions so that they would have the 
financial resources to service their debts and stimulate higher rates of economic 
growth that enables countries to outgrow their debt.
From the standpoint of U.S. policy, the key to growth was viewed as increased 
investment, which was possible only if capital flows into the region were restored. 
The first policy proposal along these lines was that of U.S. Treasury Secretary 

Chapter 15    Trade and Policy Reform in Latin America 
403
James Baker in 1985. The Baker Plan tried to organize a renewed lending program 
by commercial banks. The problem was that most banks that had Latin American 
loans in their portfolios were trying to reduce their exposure to the region, not 
increase it. Consequently, few resources were forthcoming under this plan.
Without capital flows from developed country banks, the choices were not attrac-
tive. Outright default and disavowal of the debt would cut off most of a nation’s 
trade and investment linkages. The consequences for investment and growth would 
be risky and potentially disastrous, depending on the reaction of the United States 
and other governments. On the other hand, if they continued to make interest pay-
ments and principal repayment, huge trade surpluses would be required to earn the 
revenue they needed to pay for imports plus interest on the debt.
Interest payment on the debt owed to foreigners enters the current account as 
a debit in the category of primary income paid abroad, as discussed in Chapter 9. 
Consequently, interest payments severely increased the current account deficits of 
many countries. Recall the fundamental accounting balance of an open economy,
Sp + T - G = I + CA,
where Sp is private savings, T - G is government (public) savings, I is invest-
ment, and CA is the current account balance. Without financial capital inflows to 
finance their current account deficits, countries must eliminate the deficit through 
a combination of increased exports and reduced imports. The policies that accom-
plish this are expenditure switching and expenditure reducing policies. Recall 
from Chapter 11 that expenditure switching policies such as devaluations of the 
currency turn the demand for foreign goods into a demand for domestic goods 
and raise CA directly. Expenditure reducing policies, such as tax increases and 
cuts in government spending, raise T - G and, indirectly, reduce consumption,

investment, and imports. The net effect of expenditure reducing policies is often 
a recession in which the demand for domestic and imported goods falls due to a 
fall in domestic income.
To accumulate the resources they needed for their interest payments, govern-
ments were forced to follow contractionary policies that caused deep recessions 
throughout the region. Between 1982 and 1986, the average rate of growth of real 
per capita GDP was -1.8 percent per year in Latin America and the Caribbean.
By 1987, it was apparent to analysts throughout the world that restoring capi-
tal flows was not enough. There was a need for deep reform in the economies of 
Latin America. First, it was observed that the faulty macroeconomic policies of the 
region consistently left aggregate national expenditure above national income and 
that the likelihood of a return to growth was small as long as the gap between the 
two remained. Second, in their attempt to keep government ­expenditures higher 
than warranted, many countries had resorted to printing money, which resulted 
in high and increasing rates of inflation. Third, the burden of the debt itself was 
becoming apparent to everyone inside and outside Latin America. After the 
­interest and principal payments were made, insufficient export earnings remained 
for domestic investment and consumption, and growth was stunted. By 1988–1989, 
both creditors and multilateral lending agencies such as the IMF were in agree-
ment that debt relief was in everyone’s interest.
The growing consensus on the need for debt relief led to the Brady Plan in 1989, 
named after the secretary of the treasury, Nicholas Brady. Essentially, the Brady 
Plan gave something to everyone. Creditors were expected to restructure some of 
the old debt into longer-term debt with a lower interest rate and to make some addi-
tional new loans. The multilateral lending agencies, such as the IMF, were expected 
to provide additional loans on concessional terms (below market interest rates) and 
borrowers were required to provide evidence of their willingness to begin serious 
economic reform before any new loans would be forthcoming. The Brady Plan did 
not end the debt crisis, but it was a significant step toward greater stability in the 
region. Countries that renegotiated their debt with the Brady Plan package were 
perceived by the international financial community to have greater credibility and 
sounder finances. Consequently, after 1989 capital flows began to return to Latin 
America but this time not in the form of bank loans. Rather, savers and investors 
in the United States, Europe, and Asia began to increase their direct investment in 
Latin America, as well as their holdings of various financial assets, such as stocks and 
bonds issued by private companies doing business there. While large inflows of capi-
tal can create problems if they reverse and flow out, they were the additional savings 
and investment that the region needed to return to its historical levels of growth.
From the vantage point of the twenty-first century, the most lasting effects of 
the debt crisis—other than the forgone output due to the recessions of the 1980s—
are the deep economic reforms that have taken place in country after country. 
These reforms are key to explaining the return of capital flows to Latin America. 
Reforms vary by country, both in kind and degree, but they mark a historical 
shift away from the protectionist and interventionist policies of ISI and economic 
populism and toward more open and market-oriented policies.

NEOLIBERAL POLICY REFORM  
AND THE WASHINGTON CONSENSUS
LO 15.4	 Discuss the goals of economic policy reforms that began in the late 
1980s.
LO 15.5	 Explain why some Latin American leaders have become impatient 
with economic policy reforms.
By the late 1980s, most countries in Latin America had started a series of economic 
policy reforms that began to alter the fundamental relationships between busi-
ness and government and between their national economy and the world. After 
1989, the reforms intensified and became more general. In most cases, the reforms 
consisted of three separate, but interrelated, features. First, and with varying 
degrees of success, governments implemented stabilization plans to stop inflation 
and to control their budget deficits. Second, most countries began privatizing the 
­government-owned parts of their economies, such as manufacturing enterprises, 
financial and other services, mining operations, tourism, and utility companies. 
Third, trade policies became more open and less discriminatory against exports.
Throughout Latin America, this package of reforms has come to be known as the 
neoliberal model or neoliberalism because it represents a partial return to classic 
nineteenth-century European liberalism, which favored free markets and minimal 
government intervention in the economy. In addition to being labeled as neoliberal-
ism, these reforms also came to be known as the Washington Consensus on policy 
reform. Both the neoliberal agenda and the Washington Consensus were considered 
policy prescriptions for reform of government finances and management of the econ-
omy. Neither, however, was offered as a manual for economic development, although 
that is how each came to be seen and used. By the early 1990s, growth had returned 
to most of Latin America, but it remained relatively slow, and disappointment with 
these policies began to set in after the mid-1990s. Before we look at the reaction that 
reform disappointment created, it is first useful to discuss the reforms in more detail.
Stabilization Policies to Control Inflation
Many countries sought to avoid the recessionary consequences of the onset of the 
debt crisis by increasing government spending. The only way to finance govern-
ment spending, however, was through the printing of more money because tax 
systems were inadequate and government borrowing abilities were limited by the 
debt crisis. The reckless printing of money to finance government spending drove 
a number of nations into periods of hyperinflation, as detailed in Table 15.4.
The solution to the hyperinflation experienced by Argentina, Bolivia, ­Brazil, 
and Peru is simple to prescribe: Cut government spending and stop printing 
money. The implementation of this prescription was difficult, however. In the 
short run, if price increases outstrip wage increases, as is often the case in a period 

406
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
of disinflation, then the burden of bringing down the rate of inflation falls mainly 
on wage earners who experience a fall in their real wages. Consequently, anti-infla-
tion policies create economic hardship and alienate the political support of many 
wage earners, making governments unpopular with a large share of the population.
A further complication was the lack of agreement over the causes of inflation. 
Some argued that it was caused by inertia because everyone expected future infla-
tion to be high. This caused producers to raise prices in anticipation of higher future 
input costs. The problem of inflation developing a momentum of its own, and a lack 
of empirical information about the depth of this problem, led to two different policy 
prescriptions for controlling inflation: the orthodox model and the heterodox model.
The orthodox model minimizes government involvement in the economy. 
Consequently, its anti-inflation prescription is straightforward—cut government 
spending, reform the tax system to increase compliance and revenues, and limit 
the creation of new money. The heterodox model calls for the same actions plus 
the freezing of wages and prices. In the heterodox model, inflationary expectations 
are so embedded in economic decision making that price increases will continue 
even if government spending and new money creation cease. In practice, hetero-
dox plans often ignored the budget deficits that were part of the problem.
Between 1986 and 1992, Brazil implemented five separate heterodox stabiliza-
tion plans to end inflation, and none of them worked. Similarly, heterodox plans 
in Argentina and Peru in 1985 succeeded for approximately a year, but then failed 
as inflation returned with a vengeance. Nevertheless, Brazil and Mexico each 
ultimately controlled inflation using heterodox methods.
An issue that continued to plague many nations was the problem of inconsis-
tency between inflation stabilization and exchange rate policy. Mexico’s experi-
ence is a good example of the problem and stems from the fact that the exchange

rate is a powerful weapon in the fight against inflation. Mexico fixed its peso to 
the dollar in the mid-1980s as part of its anti-inflation strategy. Argentina and 
Brazil did the same under their stabilization plans of 1991 and 1994, respectively. 
Domestic producers that competed with U.S. goods were forced to avoid price 
increases so they would remain competitive. Furthermore, prices did not increase 
on imports of U.S.-made capital goods, which were essential to Mexican industry, 
thereby helping to hold down Mexican prices for finished manufactured goods. 
Because Mexico’s inflation was still slightly higher than U.S. inflation, the peso 
became overvalued over a period of time. Ultimately, this contributed to a serious 
trade imbalance and the collapse of the peso in December 1994, followed by a 
deep recession in 1995. Since 1994, Mexico has let the peso float against the dollar 
and has stopped trying to use the exchange rate as an anchor against the current 
of inflation. Argentina’s struggle to control inflation and its use of the exchange 
rate are discussed in the case study in Chapter 11.
Structural Reform and Open Trade
Stabilization policies to control inflation and curtail large budget deficits are usually 
one part of a package that also includes structural reform policies. One way to keep 
the two types of policies separate is to recognize that stabilization generally focuses 
on macroeconomic policies—for example, inflation and government budgets—while 
structural reform tends to be more microeconomic, dealing with issues of resource 
allocation. Structural reform policies include the privatization of government-owned 
enterprises, the deregulation and redesign of the regulatory environment of over-
regulated industries such as financial services, and the reform of trade policy.
The many initiatives to privatize and reform the regulatory environments of the 
economies of Latin America are quite remarkable, but this section will focus on 
the most impressive area of structural reform to date: the economic integration of 
the region with the world economy. Before the onset of the debt crisis, the econo-
mies of Latin America had the most restricted trade systems of all the nations in 
the noncommunist world. In many countries, the debt crisis reinforced the belief 
that isolation from the world economy was the only way to protect a nation from 
shocks that originated in the external environment.
In the 1970s, Chile broke with this tradition and began to reform its trade poli-
cies. Mexico and Bolivia followed in 1985 and 1986, and by 1987–1988, it was 
apparent throughout Latin America that trade had to be more open if economic 
growth was to be restored. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, nearly all the countries 
of Latin America began reducing both the level of tariffs and nontariff barriers 
(NTBs) and the variability of tariff rates across industries and goods. Table 15.5 
shows the changes in tariffs that occurred between the mid-1980s, when the reforms 
began, and the early 1990s and beyond. As large as the tariff reductions were, the 
effect of the elimination of NTBs such as quotas and import licensing require-
ments was even more dramatic, as many countries eliminated all or nearly all these 
barriers. By the early 1990s, most of the tariff and nontariff changes had been 
implemented, and countries began to turn to alternative forms of market opening.

408
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
The three main goals of trade reform were to reduce the anti-export bias of 
trade policies that favored production for domestic markets over production for 
foreign markets, to raise the growth rate of productivity, and to make consumers 
better off by lowering the real cost of traded goods. In response to the changes in 
trade policy, the growth rate of exports picked up in most countries, while nontra-
ditional exports increased dramatically. Furthermore, productivity rose in a major-
ity of countries for which there is data. The productivity increase is at least partly 
the result of trade opening due to the impact of technology transfers, the improved 
investment climate, and the pressures on local firms to remain competitive.

Regional Trade Blocs in Latin America
Latin America has many regional trade agreements and some of the oldest. The 
first wave of agreements were signed in the 1960s as Prebisch and others began 
to recognize that ISI strategies eliminated the possibility for economies of scale 
and productivity increases that come with it. As long as production was limited 
to the home market, firms in many sectors would not be large enough to invest 
in research and development and to compete internationally. The solution was 
to encourage regional trade agreements such as the Central American Com-
mon Market (1961), the Caribbean Free Trade Association (1966, now called 
the Caribbean Community and Common Market) and the Andean Pact (1969, 
now called the Andean Community of Nations). The goals of these agreements 
are shown in Table 15.6. While the agreements conferred commercial advan-
tages on firms located in member countries, they did not significantly alter trade 
patterns nor did they increase the flow of trade within the regions. Countries

resisted pressures to lower their tariffs, and momentum toward freer trade 
within trade blocs quickly dissipated. By the 1980s, the agreements were on 
paper only and were having scant effects on member countries.
With the onset of trade reforms in the mid-to-late 1980s, regional trade agree-
ments once again became popular. Mexico took the lead with its announcement 
in 1989 that it was pursuing a free-trade agreement (FTA) with the United States. 
In addition to economies of scale, trade agreements seemed to hold the promise 
of attracting foreign investment as well as increasing market access and possibly 
diversifying trade partners. From the 1990s forward, a large number of agreements 
have been implemented as countries revitalized old agreements, signed new pluri-
lateral agreements, and also created a large number of bilateral FTAs with coun-
tries inside and outside Latin America. For example, Mexico signed FTAs with 
eleven countries and regions, including Japan and the EU, and is part of two other 
plurilateral agreements, including NAFTA. Chile is part of the Pacific Alliance, 
and has agreements in force with twenty other countries and regions, including the

The Next Generation of Reforms
The Washington Consensus overlaps with stabilization policies and structural 
reforms, and they are commonly mixed together under the label of ­neoliberalism. 
Neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus are negative terms throughout most 
of Latin America, primarily because the reforms of the last two decades have created 
uncertainty and change, but they have not begun to fulfill expectations of growth 
and prosperity. That is, the narrowly defined Washington Consensus may have 
helped some countries to end hyperinflation or runaway budget deficits, but it has 
not solved some of the region’s most pressing and fundamental long-term problems. 
Inadequate growth rates, dramatic inequality, and vulnerability to macroeconomic 
crises and volatility continue to plague most of the countries of the region. After 
the reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, economic growth rates increased, but were still 
too low to offer much encouragement, and rates of poverty and levels of inequal-
ity hardly changed. Analysts in the mid-1990s began to talk about “reforming the 
reforms” and a “second generation of reforms,” while popular frustration over the 
lack of material improvement in many countries led to widespread disillusionment 
with the reforms. Several countries (Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicara-
gua) elected leaders who promised an end to the reforms or to at least moderate 
them, and while the new policies have varied, there is generally a much stronger 
element of nationalism and a reduction in market-friendly policies. Some leaders, 
like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela (1999–2013), called for the creation of a socialist 
bloc in Latin America and a complete repudiation of the last two decades of reforms.
More moderate reformers have begun to develop a second generation of reforms 
that take into account the region’s institutions, and that address the problems of 
social and economic inequality. The reformers’ goals are to develop more inclu-
sionary economic systems by creating opportunities for excluded groups, to make 
countries less prone to macroeconomic crises, and to create greater flexibility by 
addressing some of the legal and institutional rigidities. For example, many small 
firms and individual-owned businesses or homes are located on property for which 
owners do not have a formal title. This situation makes it impossible for them to use 
their assets as collateral for loans, or to participate in the formal financial system. 
In effect, it limits growth by disallowing the full economic participation of a large 
share of small-scale entrepreneurs. To address this problem, bureaucratic processes 
must be redesigned and simplified, while legal and judicial structures must be reor-
ganized to meet the needs of small businesses and individuals rather than large 
companies and powerful political interests. Similarly, bankruptcy laws that encour-
age risk taking, competition policies that break up monopolies, and financial sector 
supervision that limits unnecessary or unwanted risk are all areas that need work.
Mechanisms for addressing Latin America’s highly unequal distribution of 
income are also on the agenda. In many countries, a long history of exclusion has 
blocked economic opportunity for particular groups, including indigenous people, 
African Americans, and isolated subsistence farmers. Although conditions vary 
EU, the United States, and China. A complete list is available through the OAS’s 
Foreign Trade Information System, http://www.sice.org.

Chapter 15    Trade and Policy Reform in Latin America 
411
greatly, most countries share an income distribution that is among the least equal 
of any region of the world. The mechanisms for addressing inequality are a greater 
emphasis on primary education and health care for children, as well as a set of 
social policies called conditional cash transfers (CCT). CCT began in Brazil and 
Mexico and have been adopted in more than seventeen countries. These pro-
grams vary somewhat in their size and administration, but in each case, households 
are given a small monthly cash grant that is contingent on their children’s school 
attendance and often also requires regular health check-ups and vaccinations. The 
thinking behind the programs is that families are more likely to send their children 
to school if there is a financial incentive, and the incentive has the added bonus 
of replacing any lost wages that might result from attending school rather than 
working. Early research into program effectiveness shows that there has been an 
increase in primary school attendance and a slight decrease in economic inequality.
Over the last twenty years, a few countries, including Mexico and Chile, have 
become among the most open and outward-oriented countries anywhere. In a 
relatively short period, Latin America has undergone a historical shift from a 
relatively closed, inward-looking region in which national governments led eco-
nomic development strategies, to a relatively open, market-oriented region. This 
shift has required fundamental changes in economic policy and in the thinking of 
politicians and citizens. In many respects, the region had no choice because the 
previous strategy of ISI was unable to ease the debt crisis of the 1980s. So far, the 
results of these reforms are disappointing, but they highlight the need for reform-
ers to consider more than economics alone as they struggle to find the sources of 
economic development in a more integrated world environment.
C A SE  S T U D Y
The Chilean Model
Chile suffered through a brutal dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s. General 
Augusto Pinochet came to power in 1973 after a military coup that overthrew 
the democratically elected Salvador Allende. Pinochet tortured and jailed an 
unknown number of Chilean citizens, and tortured and killed an estimated  
2000–3000 more. He was an extreme nationalist who knew little about ­economics 
and preferred advisors who had no affiliation with previous ­governments. After 
the failure of his first economic advisor, he selected an ambitious group of 
­Chilean academics who were outside the country’s political establishment 
and who had received training at the University of Chicago. The University 
of ­Chicago was known for its free-market ideology, and Pinochet’s economic 
advisors came to be known as the Chicago Boys.
The Chicago Boys quickly ended Chile’s import substitution policies. They 
rapidly privatized banks, copper companies, and other firms that had been 
nationalized. They cut tariffs steeply, ended most import licensing requirements, 
(continued)

412
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
and opened the Chilean economy to the world. Agricultural subsidies were cut 
and government supports were dismantled. The economy, which had been in 
crisis, began to grow two years after Pinochet gained power and after a disas-
trous recession in 1975. But the growth was illusory, and when a worldwide 
recession started in the early 1980s, Chile’s economy collapsed. Banks were 
renationalized, and many of the trade reforms were turned back.
After two more years of crisis, the economy began to recover in 1984. This 
time, the Chicago Boys practiced a more pragmatic style of policymaking 
and growth remained strong through the remainder of the 1980s. By 1990, 
Pinochet was gone and democracy had been restored. A coalition of center 
and left parties, called Concertación, came to power and remained in office 
until 2010. During Concertación’s twenty years in office, the presidency alter-
nated between centrist Christian Democrats and leftist Socialists, but economic 
policy remained relatively constant. Ricardo Lagos, the Socialist Concertación 
president from 2000 to 2006, explained,
I do believe . . . that to have sound economic policies is not something of the 
right-wing or the left-wing parties. It’s simply sound economic ­policies—now 
(that) took some time to learn.* 
Under the Chicago Boys and the brutal dictator Pinochet, and under Social-
ist and center-right (Christian Democrat) members of Concertación, Chile 
implemented a broad spectrum of market reforms. These governments intro-
duced school vouchers that subsidize students, not schools. They established 
a system of individual retirement accounts that workers manage like a mutual 
fund account. They built infrastructure such as roads, but if the government’s 
budget was stretched too thin, they made them toll roads and got the private 
sector to construct them. They implemented a uniform tariff that is the same 
on all goods so it does not divert investment away from one sector and toward 
another, and they slowly reduced the tariff over time.
The governments that came after the Pinochet dictatorship kept many of the 
same market-oriented policies, even when the Socialists controlled the presidency. 
They added a series of new initiatives, however, to provide greater social justice. 
Health care was expanded, along with retirement funds for people who were 
too poor to have built up an individual account, and infrastructure spending was 
increased to connect the country and to increase mobility of goods, services, and 
people. Poverty rates fell, incomes rose, and Chile became a model for many other 
countries. Lagos explained the government’s perspective in the following way:
It’s one thing to say, “Look, we have a market economy.” It’s a different story 
to say, “I don’t want to have a market society.” I think it is really the big issue 
today in the world. It’s true we are living in a global world where the market 
is allocating resources, but where to allocate resources in the area of public 
goods and services is something that remains in the domain of the citizen.*

Summary
■
■Latin America was one of the fastest-growing regions of the world through-
out most of the twentieth century. Growth came crashing to a halt in the 
1980s, however, and only began to return in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
■
■Until the recent reforms, Latin American economic growth has focused 
on inward development rather than outward orientation. Productivity in 
subsistence agriculture has lagged behind overall growth, leading to much 
­higher rates of poverty in rural areas than in urban ones.
■
■The primary development strategy of Latin America was adopted in the 1930s, 
1940s, and 1950s. It came to be called import substitution ­industrialization 
(ISI) and focused on the inwardly oriented development of industries 
that could produce goods that would substitute for imports. This model of 
development was favored because it was thought that Latin America would 
suffer ever-declining terms of trade for its primary commodity exports, and 
that ISI would reduce the need for foreign exchange and imports, thereby 
making the region less vulnerable to economic shocks from outside.
■
■Economic growth under ISI was adequate, but ultimately it led to an ineffi-
cient manufacturing sector, excessive rent seeking, a persistent tendency to-
ward overvalued exchange rates, and too great a concentration of resources 
on the urban sector.
■
■ISI policies were often made worse by the tendencies of many countries to 
elect or support economic populists. Populists favored economic growth and 
redistribution while, in the extreme, they ignored economic constraints such 
as government budgets and foreign exchange shortages.
■
■Populist policies generated macroeconomic instability, which often led to 
hyperinflation and falling real wages.
■
■The debt crisis that began in 1982 affected every country of the region, even 
those without high levels of debt or debt problems. As a result of the crisis, 
it became extremely difficult to borrow internationally.
■
■The main causes of the debt crisis were the increases in lending during the 
1970s and the external shocks of interest rate hikes and primary commodity 
price decreases, especially oil. The faulty macroeconomic policies of many 
Latin American governments during the late 1970s and early 1980s made 
them more vulnerable to the shocks.
■
■The debt crisis resulted in negative growth throughout the region for most 
of the period from 1982 through 1987. By 1987–1988, the need for significant 
reforms in economic policy was apparent to almost all governments.
■
■From the mid-1980s through the present, the governments of Latin ­America 
have engaged in serious reforms of economic policy. The reforms have 
first tried to create macroeconomic stability through controlling inflation 
and reducing budget deficits. Stabilization policies have been followed by 

414
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
­structural reforms that have opened trade, privatized, and reduced and re-
designed the regulatory environment.
■
■Growth has returned to most of Latin America, but dissatisfaction with the 
economic reforms is widespread. Job creation is less than desired, inequality 
persists, and economic growth is below the rate necessary to significantly 
reduce poverty.

INTRODUCTION: HIGH-GROWTH ASIAN ECONOMIES
One of the most interesting and important economic stories of the last fifty years is 
the success of several Asian economies. In Chapter 17 we will look more closely at 
two economic giants, China and India, but in this chapter the focus is on a set of very 
diverse countries that experienced rapid economic growth over several decades after 
World War II. Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, have reached World Bank 
classification status as high-income, while Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, began 
their periods of rapid growth somewhat later and are still classified as middle-income. 
Rounding out this group is Japan, the first of the high-growth East Asian economies 
and a significant influence on the economic policies of the others. This is a very diverse 
group with many differences. Not all of them are sovereign nations, for example, as 
Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China. Several are former colonies of 
Britain (Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore) or Japan (Korea), and although most were 
solidly capitalist, Vietnam is formerly socialist and, like China, retains some elements of 
socialism. What they share, beyond their decades of rapid economic growth, is an out-
ward-looking export orientation. In the 1980s, the World Bank called attention to their 
successes by including them in a group of eight economies it labeled High Performance

Asian Economies (which also included Indonesia but omitted Vietnam because it 
had just begun its transition from socialism to capitalism); subsets were called the 
Little Dragons, or the Four Tigers. Their impact on world markets through their 
capacity to export and their high growth rates made them a focus of economic 
attention before Chinese growth began to reshape the world economy, and stood 
in contrast to other world regions where growth was mediocre at best. Their eco-
nomic successes were a testimony to the idea that low-income and middle-income

countries are capable of eliminating poverty and generating growth sufficient to 
become high-income, industrial societies.
Economists agree on several facts about these high-growth Asian economies. 
First, they were careful to maintain stable macroeconomic environments and had 
fewer recessions and financial crises than were common in most other regions of the 
world. Second, they had strong and credible commitments to sharing the benefits of 
economic growth, in part through expanded access to health care, education, and 
housing. These policies and others enabled them to develop a skilled, highly liter-
ate workforce that was very attractive to multinational firms. Third, they promoted 
their exports, but they remained more open to imports than most other developing 
countries. Exports provided foreign exchange earnings and forced firms to make 
competitive products, while imports brought new technologies and new products.
Several questions about the economic success of these countries remain unan-
swered. For example, the importance of industrial policies, or industrial targeting 
is unclear. Were these policies incidental, or were they instrumental in creating 
growth? Another series of questions revolves around the use of interventionist 
government policies and the avoidance of rent seeking. Specifically, did these 
economies avoid the problem of rent seeking in the various government inter-
ventions in economic activity? Some economists argue that they did not avoid it, 
and that it is one of the reasons for the collapse of the financial sector in several 
countries during the summer and fall of 1997. Do their successes represent a new 
model for economic growth, or are these economies doing fundamentally the same 
thing that the United States and other industrialized nations did to achieve high 
incomes? Finally, can their model of export promotion be adopted elsewhere, or 
does it inevitably lead to the type of global imbalances that are partly responsible 
for the world recession that began in 2008?
This chapter examines these and several other questions as it explains the issues 
surrounding the successes of the East Asian high-growth economies. In particular, 
the contrast with Latin America is emphasized, along with East Asian trade and 
international economic relations.
POPULATION, INCOME, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH
Table 16.1 illustrates the size and income levels of eight high-growth, export- 
­oriented Asian economies. Gross domestic product (GDP) per person is high in 
Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea. The three remaining 
countries, Thailand, Malaysia, and particularly Vietnam, began their period of 
rapid growth later and are considerably behind the other five. Table 16.2 con-
tains the growth rates in real per capita income for the same set of economies. 
Between 1980 and 2000, while they were catching up with countries in the high-
income categories, all countries grew faster than the average for middle and high 
income. After 2000, growth began to slow, particularly in Japan which began 
to experience a unique set of problems in the 1990s. According to the “Rule of 
72,” if a variable (income, for example) grows at the rate X, then it doubles in

growth between 1980 and 2000 implies that its per capita real GDP doubled in 
just under ten years (72/7.3).
A Note on Hong Kong
On July 1, 1997, Great Britain officially returned the colony of Hong Kong to 
China after more than 150 years of British rule. China has pledged itself to follow 
the policy of “one country, two systems” in its relations with Hong Kong. In practi-
cal terms, this means that China will allow Hong Kong to keep its own currency, 
will limit migration between Hong Kong and the mainland, and will generally try 
to preserve Hong Kong’s current system. Statistics for Hong Kong and China are 
treated separately.
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF GROWTH
LO 16.1	 List four general characteristics of success in the export-oriented East 
Asian economies.
Recall from Chapter 15 that from the end of World War II until the mid- to late 
1980s, economic growth in Latin America was characterized by high levels of 
inequality, periods of macroeconomic instability, and an inward orientation. The 
contrast with the export-oriented Asian economies could not be more striking, 
because their growth included much lower and sometimes falling levels of inequal-
ity, generally sound macroeconomic fundamentals, and the promotion of exports. 
It is worth looking at each of the elements in more detail.
Shared Growth
One of the most remarkable features of growth in the export-oriented Asian 
economies is that it was frequently accompanied by falling income inequality. 
This feature is even more remarkable when it is realized that inequality in income 
and wealth was already relatively low at the start of the period of high growth. 
Until relatively recently, economists thought that economic development led to 
rising inequality, followed eventually by a decline. This idea came from the 1950s 
work of Simon Kuznets and led to the idea of a Kuznets Curve which was an 
inverted U, with GDP per person on the horizontal axis and inequality on the 
vertical. Kuznets acknowledged that his data was limited primarily to the United 
States, the United Kingdom, and a few German territories, and was somewhat 
tentative about his conclusions, but his followers adopted the Kuznets Curve as 
a central truth about the relationship of inequality and GDP. The diversity of 
East Asian economies, along with their later start in the growth process and their 
policy differences from Europe and North America led to a relationship between 
economic growth and income inequality that was completely different from the 

Chapter 16    Export-Oriented Growth in East Asia 
421
one hypothesized by Kuznets because it showed a decline in inequality as GDP 
per person increased.
The conditions that led to greater income equality were rooted in the unique 
historical experiences of each country. Nevertheless, each of the Asian economies 
had a similar set of highly visible wealth-sharing mechanisms. Specifically, these 
included land reform, free public education, free basic health care, and significant 
investments in rural infrastructure, such as clean water systems, transportation, 
and communication systems. These policies did not equalize incomes, but they 
provided people with the tools they needed to raise their individual incomes and 
gave hope for the future. This had several positive effects. For example, when pur-
chasing power is spread more widely through a society, it increases the opportuni-
ties for small- and medium-scale entrepreneurs that produce for the local market. 
The experience gained in meeting local demand helps small firms develop into 
larger enterprises and may carry over into numerous other activities. In addition, 
rising incomes across a broad spectrum of socioeconomic groups raise hopes for 
future improvements and encourage cooperation among the different classes of 
society while conferring legitimacy on the ruling governments. Both factors con-
tribute to political stability as well as willingness by the business elites to commit 
to long-term investments.
Rapid Accumulation of Physical and Human Capital
Rising levels of equality were closely tied to very rapid rates of accumulation of 
physical and human capital. Rapid accumulation of physical capital is synonymous 
with high levels of investment. Investment, in turn, depended on high savings 
rates. The level of savings in the export-oriented Asian economies is considerably 
higher than in many other parts of the world. The explanations for the high sav-
ings are varied. In part, it is a result of the rapid demographic transition from high 
birth and death rates to low birth and death rates experienced by those nations 
after World War II. Countries that have completed a demographic transition 
have fewer children below working age and a larger percentage of the population 
engaged in economically productive work. Hence, they tend to have higher sav-
ings rates because a smaller share of the population is dependent on the savings 
of others for their care.
Savings rates were also boosted by the stable macroeconomic environment 
of low inflation, but it is likely that the most important underlying factor in the 
creation of high savings was the rapid rate of income growth. That is, savings and 
income growth are interdependent, and these economies seemed to have created 
a “virtuous cycle” in which rapid income growth caused high savings. Savings led 
to high rates of investment, which fed back into a second round of income growth 
and high savings.
Investment in people was as important as the accumulation of physical capi-
tal. One of the key features of educational policy is that public investment in 
education was focused on the primary and secondary levels. Educational dollars 

422
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
go further at this level, and the social impact is much greater per dollar spent 
than at the university level. These investments raised literacy rates dramatically 
and laid the foundation for a skilled workforce capable of tackling increasingly 
sophisticated forms of production. In effect, the continuous rise in human capital 
endowments constituted an ongoing shift in the comparative advantages of those 
nations so that new investments could continually push into new product lines.
Rapid Growth of Manufactured Exports
Each of the eight countries in Table 16.1 actively and successfully promoted 
exports, although several began development pushes with import substitution poli-
cies. Import substitution industrialization (ISI) policies, however, were quickly 
replaced with an emphasis on export promotion. The timing of the switch from 
ISI to export promotion varied by country. Japan began promoting exports in the 
late 1950s and early 1960s; the Four Tigers (Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and 
Taiwan) started in the late 1960s; and the newly industrializing economies (Malay-
sia, Thailand, and Vietnam) began in the early 1980s and 1990s.
Table 16.3 shows the results of the export push. By 2015, the eight export 
economies accounted for over 16 percent of world merchandise exports even 
though they had just over 10 percent of world GDP. These totals represented 
a significant growth in their share of merchandise exports precisely during the 
years that exports overall were rapidly growing Table 16.3 shows compari-
sons with the United States, Germany (another export-oriented economy), 
and China. China’s strategy of export promotion has been similar, although its 
share of world merchandise exports is less than its share of world GDP, mostly 
because it is such a large economy that, like the United States and Japan, it 
depends less on trade. China’s impact on the world economy through its export 
promotion policies has probably been greater, however, than the impacts of any 
of the other individual countries in Table 16.3, precisely because it is so large 
in absolute terms.
In part, the success of export promotion was the result of education policies 
that favored primary and secondary schooling. These policies created widespread 
literacy and an adaptable and easily trained labor force. In addition, each of the 
export economies in Tables 16.1–16.3 pursued various export promotion policies. 
For example, Japan and the Four Tigers made export financing credit readily 
available; they required export targets for firms that wished to receive favorable 
credit terms or tax benefits; and they provided tariff-free access to imports of 
capital equipment used to manufacture exports. Policies in the other countries 
were somewhat less interventionist and relied to a greater extent on attracting 
direct foreign investment in export activities.
The connection between export promotion and high rates of growth is an area 
of some controversy in economics. Several possible connections are explored in 
greater detail later in the chapter. A second controversy is the possibility of other 
nations using similar export promotion strategies and their potential to generate 
trade conflicts.

Stable Macroeconomic Environments
The fourth and final characteristic of the East Asian export economies is the 
maintenance of stable macroeconomic environments.  Chapter 15 argued that 
one of the persistent problems of Latin America has been the frequent re-
occurrence of macroeconomic crises. This is not to imply that there were no 
crises in East Asia, as even before the Asian Crisis of 1997–1998, there were 
recessions and crises, but when they occurred, policy responses were usually 
quick and appropriate. Overall, macroeconomic stability was a high priority, 
and countries worked to ensure that inflation was controlled, government debts 
were well managed, and external debt was monitored and quickly resolved when 
a crisis threatened. In general, macroeconomic policy has been characterized as 
“pragmatic and flexible.”
On average, budget deficits and foreign debt were not dramatically smaller than 
in other regions of the world, although there was a significant amount of varia-
tion across countries. The difference in the export-oriented economies, however, 

424
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
is that with the exception of the 1997–1998 crisis, deficits and debts remained 
manageable. High growth rates helped ease the constraints imposed by a given 
level of debt, partly because the high levels of exports earned the foreign assets 
necessary for debt servicing.
The commitment to low inflation helped keep real interest rates stable and 
enabled firms to take a longer-run view of their investments. In addition, low infla-
tion helped avoid severe real appreciations in the exchange rate. Low inflation 
also meant that variations in the real exchange rate, the real interest rate, and the 
inflation rate were relatively low. In turn, this helped to foster a greater security 
in the minds of investors.
The Institutional Environment
LO 16.2	 Describe how the institutional environment supported economic 
growth.
LO 16.3	 Analyze the degree of openness in the export-oriented East Asian 
economies.
Economic success stems from an ability to mobilize and allocate resources. In the 
export-oriented Asian economies, large flows of savings were generated; they 
were channeled into the financial system; and they were lent to business enter-
prises that used them productively. Simultaneously, governments emphasized 
education and universal literacy. Ultimately, an efficient mobilization and allo-
cation of resources is based on the decisions of individuals and businesses that 
own resources. To ensure that individuals and businesses use their resources in 
the most productive manner, governments must create rules that foster efficient 
outcomes. In this regard, the institutional environments of countries are essential 
to their success.
Several components of the institutional environment are critical insofar as 
they help to make government policy credible. In particular, property rights are 
relatively secure and free from the threat of nationalization. Bureaucracies are 
generally competent, individuals and businesses are free to make contracts that 
will be enforced, access to information is widespread, and regulations tend to be 
clear and well publicized. Of course, there are exceptions to each of these features, 
depending on the time and place, but in general they characterize the institutional 
environments of the Asian economies under consideration.
These characteristics should not be confused with the characteristics of open, 
democratic societies. The fact that several of the successful Asian economies have 
a mixed record when it comes to support for democratic institutions, raises issues 
about the relationship between authoritarian rule and economic growth. Does 
democracy support or hinder growth? The answer to this question is complex and 
beyond the scope of this text. Nevertheless, it should be noted that many authori-
tarian governments have failed in their bid to mobilize and allocate resources. 
These regimes may be as likely to prey upon society as they are to foster its

Worldwide Governance Indicators
Economists and political science have long recognized the importance of 
institutions, both for economic development and for a complete and fulfilling 
life. Institutions, in this view, are the rules of the game, as discussed briefly 
in Chapter 2. Governance indicators are quantitative measures of the effec-
tiveness, fairness, and quality of government in the exercise of its authority. 
The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) project measures governance 
institutions in six dimensions for 215 separate economies. The indicators allow 
governments to benchmark against leaders and to chart progress over time.
The six dimensions included in the WGI are:
1.	 Rule of law: The confidence of individuals and businesses in the fairness 
and impartiality of the law, police, and the courts.
2.	 Control of corruption: The ability of governments to prevent the use of 
state power for individual gain.
3.	 Voice and accountability: The ability of citizens to participate in govern-
ment and to express themselves freely.
4.	 Government effectiveness: A measure of the quality of public services and 
the civil service.
5.	 Political stability and the absence of violence/terrorism: A measure of the 
absence of political instability, violence, and terrorism.
6.	 Regulatory quality: A measure of government’s ability to implement effec-
tive and necessary regulations.
Quantitative indicators for each of the six dimensions are captured through 
data sources provided by surveys of households and firms, suppliers of busi-
ness information, reports from private non-governmental organizations and 
think tanks, and publicly available multilateral and government information. 
The comparisons are broad estimates of the differences between countries and 
general changes over time.
Table 16.4 shows some of the indicators for the Asian export economies. The 
numbers represent the percentile for each country when it is ranked in a par-
ticular dimension against all 215 countries. Therefore, Korea’s score of 87 in the 
“Government Effectiveness” category can be interpreted to mean that 87 percent 
of countries score worse, 13 percent score better. As shown, all eight countries 
except the poorest, Vietnam, do much better than average in controlling corrup-
tion, maintaining the rule of law, implementing quality regulations, and achieving 
a high overall level of government effectiveness. The scores not shown, voice and 
accountability and political stability/absence of violence, are lower in every case, 
and below world averages in the middle-income countries (Malaysia, Thailand, 
and Vietnam; Malaysia is slightly above average in the political stability category).

economic development. However, the Asian economies in this chapter fostered 
growth rather than the enrichment of a small elite at the expense of the majority.
A second issue that arises from the general lack of traditionally defined demo-
cratic rights is the relevancy of the experience these countries to other regions of 
the world, such as Latin America. Some social scientists argue that the context 
of authoritarian rule makes the Asian economies irrelevant to Latin American 
nations, where policy reform took place within an institutional setting that allows 
far more dissent. Generally speaking, there does not seem to be a correlation 
between the type of government (democratic or authoritarian) and the ability to 
put good policies into place.
The pattern of differences shown in Table 16.4 raises a central question 
about institutional quality and its impact on the economy: Do good institu-
tions create more economic growth, or does economic growth create better 
institutions? For example, does Singapore have good governance because it is 
relatively well-off, or is it well-off because it has good governance? Which is 
cause and which is effect? Undoubtedly there is some mutual interaction and 
while causation runs in both directions, the strength of the interaction cannot 
be determined by looking at the data alone. What we can say, is that the most 
successful economies also have very high-quality governance indicators and, 
generally speaking, the higher the income level, the better the governance in 
most dimensions.

Fiscal Discipline and Business–Government Relations
As noted in the previous case study, not all of the eight economies score above 
world averages in the “Voice and Accountability” category. Nevertheless, whether 
they are fully democratic or not, governments must create stable macroeconomic 
environments in order for economic growth to succeed. The characteristic of mac-
roeconomic stability has already been mentioned, but it is worth revisiting because 
of its central importance. The maintenance of a stable macroeconomic environment 
requires fiscal discipline and an acceptance of the resource constraints that limit 
government actions. Budget deficits and foreign debt must be kept manageable, 
and the real exchange rate must be relatively stable. The benefits of accepting these 
limitations are that it increases the credibility of government policy and builds the 
private sector’s confidence. The result is more investment and less capital flight.
Stable macroeconomic policies are necessary for growth, but they are no guar-
antee. For example, macroeconomic stability does not address the very significant 
problem in all developing countries of the coordination of interdependent invest-
ment projects. The coordination problem results from the fact that many private 
sector investments are interdependent. That is, their profitability depends on the 
simultaneous or prior creation of a complementary investment. The same often holds 
true for private sector/public sector investments. For example, profitable investment

Doing Business in the Export Oriented  
Asian Economies
In 1989, Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto published The Other Path, a 
brilliant work that argued against cumbersome, complex, and unnecessary busi-
ness regulations in developing countries. De Soto made his case with a simple, 
yet powerful, experiment: He hired a small team of researchers in Lima, Peru, 
to work full time at obtaining a business license for a small apparel manufac-
turing firm. The researchers spent the equivalent of 289 days of full-time work 
by an individual—nearly ten months—and paid an amount equal to thirty-two 
times a monthly minimum wage to obtain the signatures and permits required 
to register their business officially. Then they duplicated this experiment in a 
number of other developing countries to show that Peru is not atypical. Ulti-
mately, these barriers constrain the economic growth of national economies by 
limiting the growth of small business.
De Soto’s work found its way onto a larger stage at the World Bank where 
his ideas were built into an ongoing research project and an online database 
comparing the ease of doing business in 189 countries. The Doing Business 
Web site (http://www.doingbusiness.org) issues an annual report on the ease

of doing business. In all, there are ten different dimensions, each of which is 
composed of four indicator variables and five or six indices that measure the 
indicator variables. Each country is ranked on each of the ten dimensions:
1.	 Ease of starting a business.
2.	 Dealing with construction permits.
3.	 Getting electricity.
4.	 Registering property.
5.	 Getting credit.
6.	 Protecting investors.
7.	 Paying taxes.
8.	 Trading across borders.
9.	 Enforcing contracts.
10.	 Resolving insolvency.
The overall rankings are a combination of scores on each of these ten.  
Table 16.5 shows comparisons for the Asian export oriented economies. Five 
are in the top twenty and seven are top fifty. Only Vietnam ranks in the middle 
of the 189 countries in the sample.
The ease of doing business is one factor that explains the high performance 
of this group of Asian economies, although some countries may succeed with-
out scoring very high in this area. China, for example, ranked number 84 of 
189 in 2015, yet its growth is exceptionally rapid and foreign investors are 
extremely active in the country. In China’s case, size matters and investors go 
to China in spite of the difficulties of doing business there. None of the econo-
mies in Table 16.5 has that advantage, except perhaps Japan.

in warehousing facilities at a seaport depends on prior investment in sufficient port 
infrastructure to provide an adequate flow of goods through the warehouses. Yet 
the port and related transportation linkages may not be worthwhile unless there is 
a simultaneous investment or a guarantee of future investment in the warehouses.
The coordination of interdependent investment activities is difficult in a purely 
free-market framework. The difficulty stems from the fact that the flow of infor-
mation is not sufficient to let all investors know of each other’s intentions. Six 
of the eight countries in this chapter surmounted this problem through the cre-
ation of deliberation councils, a set of quasi-legislative bodies that bring together 
representatives from the private and the public sectors. In effect, deliberation 
councils coordinate the information flow between businesses and policymakers.
Individual councils are usually created to deal with a limited set of issues involv-
ing one industry or a particular set of policy issues, such as the government bud-
get. By bringing together government officials and affected business groups, the 
councils reduce the cost of acquiring information about new policies, provide a 
forum for bargaining over policies, instill greater investor confidence, and raise 
the level of credibility of the government’s policies. More than perhaps any other 
function, however, deliberation councils serve as a vehicle for the business elites 
to have a strong voice in the setting of government policy and thereby ensure their 
cooperation in the overall economic strategy.
For example, Japan has used deliberation councils extensively. This involves a 
feedback process in which the first step is for officials to call a hearing and invite 
comments from various interested parties on a proposed policy or industrial strat-
egy. Based on the information they collect, a draft report is issued that is then 
forwarded for discussion to a council made up of industry representatives, aca-
demics, journalists, consumer advocates, labor leaders, former bureaucrats, finan-
cial specialists, and politicians. Representation is not proportional in any sense, 
nor are representatives elected. Based on the feedback from the council, officials 
change the draft plan and issue a final document that details the steps that will be 
taken, such as policy changes or new policy initiatives. The final action is essen-
tially a public relations campaign to sell the plan to the wider public.
Avoiding Rent Seeking
Economic policy in the East Asian export economies has been relatively interven-
tionist. That is, the laissez-faire ideology of letting markets determine outcomes 
has not been followed. Hong Kong is an exception, but even there, the government 
has directed and actively participated in the creation of extensive public housing. 
In the next section, we examine some of the issues related to the effectiveness and 
extent of government intervention in the economy. Whether extensive or not, 
however, one of the biggest puzzles surrounding these economies was the degree 
to which most countries were able to avoid the costs and inefficiencies associated 
with private sector rent seeking.
When governments intervene to help specific industries or to channel 
resources in a particular direction, they create benefits that are of value to 

430
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
someone. Generally speaking, when private interests perceive the possibility of 
obtaining something of value from government (for instance, credit subsidies, 
import protection, and business licenses) they will devote scarce resources to 
obtaining those benefits. The result, as discussed in several earlier chapters, is 
wasteful rent seeking. Government policies created numerous benefits of value 
to specific industries, yet in spite of this there was relatively little rent seeking 
by those interests. To be sure, rent seeking still occurs, and there is significant 
variation across the economies. Nevertheless, there is less overall rent seeking 
than in many other societies, as evidenced indirectly by measures of governance 
shown in the prior case study.
It is unlikely that there is a single, simple explanation for this lack of rent-
seeking behavior, but the deliberation councils probably played a key role. By 
providing a policy forum in which various interests can make their views known 
and have a chance to argue in favor of policies that are particularly beneficial, the 
need to hire lobbyists is reduced. Furthermore, given that industrial and business 
interests meet with government officials as a group rather than single interests by 
themselves, there is greater transparency and less worry about what competing 
interests may be doing behind the scenes.
In addition to the role played by deliberation councils, some analysts point 
to the fact that whenever governments offer something of value, they usually 
attach performance requirements. For example, firms receiving credit subsi-
dies or import protection are usually required to meet specific targets—often 
export targets—or else the subsidies are taken away. What is remarkable, and 
not clearly understood, is how governments are able to enforce the performance 
requirements they lay down. Many nations outside East Asia, including many 
Latin American governments, have used performance requirements as incen-
tive mechanisms, but often they have proven to be unenforceable. That is, when 
firms in Latin America have not met their production or export targets, govern-
ments have often been unable to withdraw the special considerations they are 
providing to the noncompliant firms.
Two key elements that have played a role in enforceability are the pres-
ence of a well-educated bureaucracy along with its insulation from the politi-
cal process. In most of the export-oriented economies, civil service careers are 
highly respected and well paid. Consequently, bureaucrats are well educated 
and competent. In addition to ability, their insulation from the political process 
gives them the room to make decisions based on merit rather than on the basis 
of special interests.
A final explanation for the relative lack of rent seeking is the commitment to 
shared growth that we saw at the beginning of the chapter. The fact that business 
elites are convinced that they will share the benefits of economic growth reduces 
the pressure for them to seek added benefits through the manipulation of the 
political process. In effect, greater equality reduces the number of individuals 
and groups that feel left out of the growth process and eliminates the underlying 
cause of much rent seeking.

C A SE  S T U D Y
Were East Asian Economies Open?
High-growth Asian economies relied on their export sectors for a substantial 
part of their growth. They actively promoted exports in various ways and to 
varying degrees, and there is a consensus among economists that manufactured 
exports played a key role in their economic development. Export promotion 
is not the same thing as an open economy, however, and there is disagreement 
about their trade policies and the extent of their openness.
It would seem easy to settle the debate simply by looking at tariff rates and 
quotas. Unfortunately, these are inadequate measures of trade policy, particu-
larly if a country has significant nontariff measures that it uses to block imports. 
For example, the U.S. auto industry argued for years that red tape and unneces-
sary safety inspections made their cars uncompetitive in Japanese markets. This 
may or may not have been the case; U.S. cars were not designed for Japan, and 
the Japanese marketing and distribution systems are fundamentally different 
from those in the United States. Did U.S. cars fare poorly because the playing 
field was tilted to favor Japanese brands, or was the playing field level and U.S. 
automakers had products that were less competitive?
It is possible that high-growth Asian economies promoted their exports 
and severely restricted imports to protect domestic markets. In that case, their 
policies were not market-oriented, but instead reflected a high degree of gov-
ernment intervention with the purpose of determining outcomes selected by 
planners and government officials. In this view, some East Asian economies fol-
lowed the policies of mercantilism and viewed exports as the path to wealth cre-
ation and imports as destructive to their wealth and prosperity (see Chapter 3). 
Alternatively, East Asian economies did not set tough constraints on imports, 
but followed relatively open export promotion policies that contributed to 
rapid economic growth, more or less in line with market-based incentives.
This is an important debate. Some of the countries examined in this chapter 
were among the first since World War II to go from developing to developed, 
or low and middle income to high income. If mercantilism is the key to their 
success, it would be an important empirical case against the paradigm of com-
parative advantage and the gains from trade.
Table 16.6 contrasts imports and exports for high-growth East Asian coun-
tries with those of the main Latin American economies. Imports and exports 
include goods and services and are measured relative to the size of each coun-
try’s GDP. Data is provided for two years. In 1980, most of the East Asian 
economies were practicing export promotion policies, and Latin America had 
weak export sectors and relatively closed economies.
Between 1980 and 2014, every country except Singapore increased its imports 
relative to its GDP, and most countries increased the relative share of exports in

432
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
its GDP. Beginning in the late 1980s, most Latin American economies started 
to become more open to trade as they began to dismantle their import substitu-
tions policies and started to sign regional free trade agreements. Nevertheless, 
Latin America trades much less than the high export East Asian economies. 
The partial exception is Japan, which as a large country has a smaller trade-to-
GDP ratio than any of the other Asian economies in Table 16.6.
East Asian economies apparently did not close their import sectors, but 
rather imported quite a large amount of goods and services. While they used 
selective protection for targeted industries, in general the data do not support 
the idea that they were relatively closed to imports. This is entirely consistent 
with theoretical models showing that protectionism often hurts exports by 
causing the currency to appreciate as a result of a lack of demand for foreign 
goods, and due to the higher returns that protectionism creates for the produc-
tion of import substitutes. In other words, just as Latin America’s depressed 
imports went hand-in-hand with its depressed exports in 1980, East Asia’s 
high level of exports went hand-in-hand with a relatively high level of imports.

THE ROLE OF INDUSTRIAL POLICIES
LO 16.4	 Explain the pros and cons of the idea that industrial policies mattered 
to East Asian success.
The most influential study of export-oriented Asian economies is the World 
Bank’s policy research report entitled The East Asian Miracle: Economic Growth 
and Public Policy. The World Bank’s research team concluded that government 
interventions were common in three areas: (1) targeting of specific industries, that 
is, industrial policies narrowly defined; (2) directed credit; and (3) export promo-
tion. In this section, we examine the debate over the effectiveness of industrial 
policies and offer a word of caution about the use of directed credit.
Targeting Specific Industries
Recall from Chapter 5 that industrial policies can be defined in broad or narrow 
terms. The broad definition is policies that alter a nation’s endowment in a way 
that does not favor particular industries. For example, we have already seen that 
the East Asian success story involves high rates of primary and secondary school-
ing that altered the characteristics of the labor force, and high rates of savings and 
investment that created the infrastructure and capital goods necessary to enter 
more sophisticated lines of manufacturing.
The narrow definition of industrial policies is the targeted development of spe-
cific industries. In effect, targeted industrial policies attempt to change the com-
parative advantage of a nation through the alteration of its industrial structure. 
These policies channel resources to favored industries and are often criticized as 
being “government bureaucrats picking winners and losers.”*
With the exception of Hong Kong, each of the countries has had, or still has 
some form of targeted industrial policy. These policies were strongest in Japan, 
Korea, and Taiwan (the “northern tier”), but were significant in the other countries 
as well. In Japan, the focus has been on steel, autos, textiles, shipbuilding, alumi-
num, electronics, and semiconductors, among others. The height of Korean policies 
was between 1973–1979 with the Heavy and Chemical Industries (HCI) program, 
which targeted steel, shipbuilding, petrochemicals, and other heavy industries. 
While lacking the same clear focus as Japan and Korea, Taiwan’s programs have 
provided research institutes, science parks, and basic infrastructure for a variety 
of industries and seem to have targeted the development of import substitutes.
Malaysian policies took off in the early 1980s with the Look East policy, which 
emulated Korea’s and Japan’s industrial development. Malaysia created the Heavy 
Industries Corporation of Malaysia (HICOM) to develop steel, nonferrous metals, 
machinery, paper and paper products, and petrochemicals; but it ran into financial 
constraints in the late 1980s when many of the firms under HICOM proved to be 
unprofitable and required government bailouts. Since then, Malaysia has priva-
tized many firms and reduced the degree of state control in others. Thailand did

not make systematic efforts such as Japan and Korea did, but the Thai Board of 
Investment promoted industries that it deemed to have the potential for technolog-
ical learning. Singapore’s policies have focused largely on ­encouraging technology 
transfer from firms in industrial nations through the promotion of foreign direct 
investment. Vietnam did not begin its transition to a market-­oriented economy 
until approximately 1989, but it has focused on attracting ­foreign direct investment 
to supply it with technology and manufacturing capacity, and has begun to copy 
Korea’s development of large conglomerates in targeted sectors. Vietnam, unlike 
Korea, however, has retained state ownership of many of the conglomerates.
The tools that nations use to promote specific industries include the instruments 
of trade policies. Restrictions on imports, through licensing, quotas or tariffs, and 
export subsidies were all used. In many cases, protection from foreign competition 
enabled firms to earn high profits in domestic markets, which compensated for the 
losses they suffered in foreign markets. In addition to trade policy, countries used 
numerous other mechanisms to channel resources to targeted industries. Directed 
credit was one of the most important tools, because even when it was small in 
size, it signaled the private sector that government policy favored the industry 
receiving the funds. This official stamp of approval was an important device for 
encouraging private lending to new and potentially risky industries. Other tools 
included subsidies; market information especially with respect to foreign markets, 
infrastructure construction, and research and development funds.
There are two essential elements to these policies that make them different 
from most other national attempts to promote specific industries. First, resources 
were usually only provided as long as the companies receiving them met specific 
export targets. If the targets were not met, the resources (protection, credit, and 
so on) were withdrawn. Export targets are argued to be a better criterion than 
profits because many firms had monopolies or significant market power in their 
domestic markets; hence, profitability may be unrelated to efficiency. Second, 
governments placed macroeconomic stability above industrial policies. If they 
began to experience fiscal problems caused by the industrial promotion programs, 
they scaled them back or abandoned them.
The World Bank view of these programs is that they were insulated from purely 
political influences so that industrial targeting decisions were based on technical 
analysis rather than politics. The collapse of the financial sectors in many countries 
in 1997 and 1998 has called this assumption into question. For example, govern-
ment use of directed credit programs appears to be one of the main causes of 
the financial crisis. Government involvement in credit allocation forced financial 
institutions to make unsound loans. In turn, the failure to apply business criteria 
led to a mountain of bad debt, which ultimately sank many banks and whole 
financial sectors.
Did Industrial Policies Work?
The role of industrial policies in the story of East Asian growth is controversial. 
Ideally, we would like to know the answers to two simple questions. First, did 
they work? A successful policy would be one that increases the overall rate of 

Chapter 16    Export-Oriented Growth in East Asia 
435
GDP growth or the rate of productivity growth. Second, if they worked, were they 
important? That is, was their contribution to economic growth significant enough 
to be considered one of the reasons for economic success?
With respect to the question of whether they made a positive contribution 
to growth, opinion ranges from “no effect” to “positive effect.” The reason for 
the lack of consensus on this important issue is that, in general, it is difficult to 
measure the effects of policy interventions on growth rates. There are conceptual 
disagreements about the measurements that should be made, and few countries 
have data of sufficient quality. In the World Bank’s view, “reasoned judgments” 
must be used to settle the issue. Unfortunately, the paucity of data, together with 
disagreements over measurement techniques, results in the use of qualitative judg-
ments of the sort that inevitably lead researchers to confirm the opinions that they 
began with.
In spite of these obstacles to assessing industrial policies, the variety of opinions 
among researchers can be characterized as falling into two camps. One camp is 
represented by the World Bank’s research. In its view, some government inter-
ventions fostered economic growth (export promotion and directed credit), but 
in general industrial policies did not. They assert that industrial policies usually 
targeted the same industries that market forces were developing and, therefore, 
were unnecessary. In the cases where the “wrong” industries were targeted, prag-
matic and flexible policymakers managed to quickly change policies before any 
damage was done to the rest of the economy.
The World Bank’s analysis rests on two pieces of evidence. First, it compares 
the growth rates of productivity in the targeted and nontargeted sectors in the 
three countries with sufficient data (Japan, Korea, and Taiwan). In general, it 
finds that productivity change in the promoted sectors was high but no higher than 
in the rest of the economy. Possible exceptions to its general finding are Japan’s 
chemical and metalworking industries and Korea’s chemical industry. Second, 
it examines the change over time in the industrial structure of the countries. If 
industrial policies worked, they should have led to a different pattern of industrial 
growth than the pattern caused by a change in factor endowments. The World 
Bank concluded that industrial policies were at most marginally effective, because 
the sector-by-sector growth pattern is as expected, given the national endowments 
of labor and the high savings and investment rates.
Critiques of the World Bank’s findings usually rest on two points. First, the fact 
that productivity growth was generally no faster in promoted sectors is irrelevant, 
according to the critics. The important issue is what the growth rates would have 
been without promotion. It is conceivable that without industrial policies, growth 
in the targeted industries would have been much slower than with the policies. 
Second, the critics point out that the World Bank analysis is overly general. In 
their view, it is based on industry groupings that are too broad to uncover the 
details of selective targeting. For example, some components of the textile indus-
try were heavily promoted in both Japan and Korea in the early period of their 
industrial policies. Therefore, it is not surprising that textiles overall have experi-
enced a rapid increase in productivity and that they remain a larger than expected 
component of Japanese and Korean industry.

436
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
At present, there is no way to resolve this debate. Consequently, there are vari-
ous opinions about the relevance of industrial policies for developing countries 
in general. To the extent that there is an agreement, most analysts share the view 
that if industrial policies are to be successful, they should have three key charac-
teristics. Countries must have (1) clear performance criteria such as export targets, 
(2) institutional mechanisms to monitor compliance and enforce compliance, and 
(3) low costs so that nontargeted sectors do not suffer.
C A S E  S T U D Y
HCI in Korea
Most observers agree that Korean industrial policies have at least partially suc-
ceeded. The most enthusiastic observers argue that they have accelerated the 
rate of overall growth without creating offsetting inefficiencies elsewhere in 
the economy. Less optimistic observers concede success in generating exports 
and in changing the industrial structure of the country, but they offset many of 
those gains with the huge financial costs of the Heavy and Chemical Industries 
(HCI) promotion in the 1970s.
Korea’s industrial promotion drive began a few years after the Korean War 
in the early 1960s. Early efforts at industrial targeting focused on key industrial 
materials such as cement, fertilizer, and petroleum refining. The government 
typically supported large-scale conglomerates, called chaebol, which were given 
monopolies in the domestic market. Trade policy in the form of an aggressive 
promotion of exports along with high levels of protection was the main tool for 
targeting industries, but directed credit and tax breaks were important as well.
Industrial targeting evolved into the Heavy and Chemical Industries pro-
gram, which was at its most active from 1973 to 1979. HCI targeted six specific 
industrial groups—steel, petrochemicals, nonferrous metals for enhanced self-
sufficiency, shipbuilding, electronics, and machinery (especially earth-moving 
equipment and autos)—for export. The tools used to promote these industries 
were the same as previously described, but with a different emphasis. By the 
mid-1970s, trade policy had become somewhat more liberal, although most 
industries still received significant protection. Greater emphasis was placed 
on subsidies, directed credit through loans at below-market interest rates, and 
special tax exemptions.
The cost of promotion during the HCI period was significant. Direct funds 
provided to targeted industries were around 5 percent of the overall budget, 
and tax exemptions amounted to about 3 percent of total tax revenues. In 1977, 
around 45 percent of the banking system’s total provision of domestic credit 
went to the targeted industries. Gradually, bottlenecks and large debts began 
to accumulate.

Chapter 16    Export-Oriented Growth in East Asia 
437
By 1979, when the second oil crisis hit, inflation was high, the exchange 
rate had appreciated, causing exports to falter, and the targeted industries had 
significant idle capacity. In addition, the labor-intensive sectors, which had not 
been targeted, were starved for credits, and bad debts and financial insolven-
cies were growing in the HCI sector.
Policymakers quickly switched course. HCI promotion was curtailed, the 
currency was devalued, and financial market and import liberalization were 
hastened. One of the main efforts of policymakers in the 1980s was to restruc-
ture a number of the distressed industries that were over promoted in the 
1970s. The cost to the government budget has been significant, as it has been 
forced to bail out bankrupt firms and dispose of nonperforming loans.
Was HCI promotion worth it? It is impossible to answer this question 
definitively because we can never know what would have happened under 
an alternative set of policies. During the height of the HCI program and its 
immediate aftermath, Korea’s growth rate dipped slightly (from the mid-1970s 
through the mid-1980s), but the change was slight and growth overall remained 
extremely high. Korea achieved classification as a high-income nation, a feat 
that only Japan and the city-states of Singapore and Hong Kong accomplished 
in the twentieth century.

THE ROLE OF MANUFACTURED EXPORTS
LO 16.5	 Evaluate the impact of export promotion policies and the debate over 
their applicability to other world regions.
The promotion of manufactured exports played a significant role in the industrial 
strategies of most of the countries examined in this chapter. The lone exception is 
Hong Kong that attained a high level of trade not by manufacturing products itself, 
but by acting as a major port for trade with China and East Asia. The promotion of 
manufactured exports were largely successful, and the exports of each country grew 
even faster than its GDP. Given these facts, it is reasonable to assume that there 
might be a connection between the two. That is, a number of studies of the East Asia 
and other regions have shown that higher rates of growth of exports are correlated 
with higher rates of growth of GDP. What is the mechanism that causes this?
The Connections between Growth and Exports
It is true by definition that exports are part of the GDP, so growth in exports 
would seem to be simply a part of overall GDP growth. If production of exports 
crowds out production for domestic consumption, then export growth may not 

438
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
increase GDP. In effect, the idea that export growth causes faster GDP growth 
is an assertion that export growth causes the overall capacity of the economy to 
grow faster than it would have if production was focused on goods for the domestic 
market.
If production focused on exports results in greater overall growth, then there 
must be something in the production process or its links to the rest of the econ-
omy that is absent from domestically focused production. One possibility is that 
because exports are produced for the world market, economies of scale come 
into play in a way that is absent when firms produce for a small domestic market. 
Larger firms often have lower average costs because they can spread their fixed 
costs for capital and machinery over a larger volume of output. Another possible 
reason why exports might foster growth is that as firms produce for a world mar-
ket, there are added incentives to increase research and the development of new 
products. Economies of scale may make it worthwhile, and the need to keep up 
with foreign competition may make it necessary.
Other connections between export growth and GDP growth are possible as 
well. Exports may speed up the adoption and mastery of international best prac-
tices. Firms that operate in global markets are not protected from competition. In 
fact, they are going up against the world’s best, and the competitive pressures may 
force firms to stay abreast of the latest developments in their product area and 
production process. Measurement of this possible effect can be complicated by 
the existence of export promotion policies because an exporter does not have to 
be among the world’s best if it receives subsidies (for example, direct payment or 
access to low-interest loans or tax breaks). Firms can be competitive due to subsi-
dies received at home, which may reduce the pressures to compete based on effi-
ciency or quality. Successful export promotion programs, such as those in Korea, 
are well aware of this problem, and because their goal is to develop firms capable 
of head-to-head international competition without special breaks, they carefully 
monitor the programs to ensure that the subsidies granted to the exporters do not 
become the reason for competitive success abroad. In addition, successful export 
programs gradually reduce the subsidies they offer as firms become internationally 
competitive. Note, however, that since 1995, the international rules for subsidies 
have tightened considerably, and it is much harder for countries to provide direct 
support for industries within the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework.
Production of exports has several other potential advantages. Exports make 
possible the purchase of imports. Developing countries are not usually on the 
technology frontier, and the creation of an efficient manufacturing enterprise is 
often dependent on imports of machinery and other capital goods. A scarcity 
of exports impairs a country’s ability to purchase imports, with the result that 
firms are unable to obtain the imported inputs they need in order to raise their 
efficiency. A related advantage of exports is that the need to meet export targets 
caused export-oriented economies to encourage inward foreign direct investment 
(FDI) and the acquisition of new technology. One way to overcome the backward-
ness of domestic manufacturing is to encourage foreign firms to invest. Most of 

Chapter 16    Export-Oriented Growth in East Asia 
439
the Asian export economies welcomed FDI and Singapore and Vietnam went so 
far as to build industrial policies around it. At the same time that FDI was encour-
aged, several countries also sought to provide incentives for the foreign firm to 
license its technology to potential domestic rivals. This was a particularly common 
strategy in Japan (and currently in China), where the incentive of access to the 
large Japanese market was sufficient to encourage many firms to sign technology 
licensing agreements.
The ability to import capital and modern technology is seen by some as the 
most critical ingredient in policies that successfully close the gap between devel-
oping and developed countries. Export promotion can encourage the acquisition 
of new technologies because in order to succeed, governments must allow access 
to whatever imports firms need to become efficient. Most of the governments 
selectively protected their domestic markets, but they also adjusted their policies 
so that exporters were given access to needed imports. In general, they used less 
protection than other developing areas.
Is Export Promotion a Good Model for Other Regions?
The export promotion model has succeeded so well in East Asia that, inevitably, 
it is being prescribed for other developing areas. In Latin America, for example, 
the economic crisis of the 1980s, together with the very visible counterexample 
of East Asia, has propelled many nations into similar types of policies. A serious 
question is whether other areas can duplicate the export successes of the Asian 
export economies.
If developing countries around the world begin to emphasize export promotion 
policies, an issue arises as to whether the world’s industrial nations can absorb the 
exports of a series of newly industrializing countries. Some analysts view the large 
trade imbalances of the early 2000s as a contributor to the vulnerabilities that 
ultimately led to the financial crisis in 2007 and a global recession in 2008. If all of 
the world’s low- and middle-income countries, along with some high income ones, 
attempt to export their way to prosperity without purchasing a similar quantity of 
imports, export surpluses will have to be matched by deficits somewhere else in 
the system. In the long run, this is not sustainable, and in the short and medium 
runs, it runs the risk of political confrontations and trade wars.
Perhaps the greatest obstacle for countries that wish to replicate the export 
promotion policies of the Asian exporters is the Uruguay Round of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Under the rules that went into effect 
in 1994, developing countries must eliminate any subsidies that are contingent on 
export performance. (See the case study on WTO rules in Chapter 5.) Extremely 
poor countries with per capita GDP less than $1,000 are exempted. Essentially, the 
new GATT rules eliminate the possibility that developing countries can use the 
same tools—credit subsidies, tax breaks, direct payments—that have been used 
previously. The only exceptions are the poorest countries, which do not export 
manufactured goods in any quantity.

Asian Trade Blocs
The first edition of this text (1994) began this case study as follows: “Asia is 
the one region of the world without significant trade blocs.” Since then, and 
more particularly since 2000, that has changed dramatically. Table 16.7 shows 
the progression in Asia of the signing of trade agreements.
Before the growth of trade agreements in the 1990s, the Association of 
­Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was the most notable example of an Asian 
cooperation agreement. Founded in 1967 with five members (Indonesia, ­Malaysia, 
Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand), it added five more countries (Brunei 
Darussalam, Vietnam, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Cambodia) between 1984 and 
1999. ASEAN’s initial mission was political and security cooperation, but it has 
expanded into trade and economic arenas. In 1992, it created the ASEAN Free 
Trade Area (AFTA), which was implemented over a fifteen-year span.
New agreements began to take shape in the 1990s, especially after the Asian 
Crisis of 1997–1998. Political and business leaders in East Asia decided that their 
economies and regulatory agencies were not prepared to handle the increase in 
trade and investment flows, and that they could not rely on the advice of the Inter-
national Monetary Fund (IMF) or other multilateral agencies. Stronger bilateral 
and regional relations were accepted as a means for building greater regional sta-
bility. New agreements were proposed, negotiated, and eventually signed. These 
agreements take many forms, both with respect to their regional coverage and 
their scope. Some are bilateral and intraregional, such as the Japan-Singapore 
Economic Partnership Agreement, while others are between one country and an 
existing group, such as the ASEAN-China Comprehensive Economic Coopera-
tion Agreement. Others are bilateral, but interregional, such as the Japan-Mexico 
Free Trade Agreement, or the Korea-Chile Free Trade Agreement.

IS THERE AN ASIAN MODEL OF ECONOMIC GROWTH?
LO 16.6	 Define total factor productivity and explain why economists use 
it to understand whether growth in East Asia is similar to growth 
elsewhere.
The East Asian “miracle” has given rise to a large number of studies that seek to 
explain rapid growth in the East Asian export economies and China. While the 
issue may appear academic, it has become one of the more interesting and heated 
debates in recent popular economics. Proponents of laissez-faire economics have 
used the relative openness of the East Asian economies, their use of private mar-
kets, and their strong macroeconomic fundamentals to argue for government poli-
cies that are less activist. Proponents of a more activist government have pointed 
to selective interventions, such as export promotion, industrial policies, and delib-
eration councils, to argue in favor of a larger government role in the economy. 
Some Asian politicians have pointed to their restrictions on civil and political 
liberties as laying a foundation for order and the avoidance of chaos.
Is there an Asian model of the economy? That is, have the Asian exporters 
managed to achieve their extraordinary growth rates through policies that are 
fundamentally different from traditional policies that rely more heavily on market 
forces alone? At stake are the paths followed by today’s low- and middle-income 
economies and the future role of government policy in the industrial countries. 
Naturally, with a question so controversial, there are various answers and opinions. 
Recent work, however, seems to be pointing toward a robust set of conclusions.
Nor are trade agreements the only form of regional cooperation 
that emerged after the crisis of 1997–1998. ASEAN opened negotia-
tions with China, Korea, and Japan to increase regional cooperation and 
share technical expertise in managing exchange rate risk, bond financ-
ing, and other financial matters. Information on the integration efforts 
within Asia, and between Asian and non-Asian economies is readily 
available on the website of the Asian Regional Integration Center (aric 
.adb.org), a unit of the Asian Development Bank (ADB, www.adb.org). The 
Asian Development Bank was created in 1966, long before the Asian Crisis of 
1997–1998 and currently has sixty-seven member countries. It is one of many 
regional development banks around the world that are financed by its member 
countries with the mission to promote sound economics and economic growth 
and to provide technical and financial assistance. The ADB is complemented 
by the newly created Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (www.aiib.org) 
that started up in 2015 with fifty-seven member countries, after two years of 
Chinese efforts. The mission of the AIIB is similar to that of the ADB, although 
it hopes to be more flexible, faster, and greener in providing finance, technical 
assistance, and infrastructure development. (See the case study in Chapter 2).

442
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
Before we look at those conclusions, however, we must briefly review the 
idea of growth accounting. Recall that labor productivity is defined as output per 
worker: Q/L, where Q is output and L is labor, usually measure by the number 
of hours of work. Labor productivity is equivalent to the coefficients we used in 
Chapters 3 and 4 when the Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin trade models were 
presented. East Asian growth is remarkable for its growth in per capita income 
and its growth in labor productivity. In essence, labor productivity growth led to 
increases in the amount of output per person.
Any given rate of growth of labor productivity can be broken down into the 
share that is due to more capital and the share that is due to more skills or edu-
cation. In the economics literature, such an exercise is called growth accounting. 
When growth accounts are constructed for a country or a region, there is always 
some share of the growth in labor productivity that cannot be explained by the 
amount of additional capital or education. This share is a measure of the effects of 
using the available inputs more efficiently. That is, if growth cannot be explained 
by increased capital or education, it must be due to a more productive use of the 
available inputs. For example, the organization of production may have changed 
so that people are working more efficiently, or the quality of technology may have 
changed so that each unit of capital and labor input produces more units of output, 
or greater scale economies are available.
Another name for productivity that is not explained by capital or education 
is total factor productivity (TFP). TFP growth reflects changes in output that 
are unrelated to changes in capital or labor inputs but that are related to new 
technologies, innovation, and organizational improvements. According to most 
estimates, over the long run a majority of per capita income growth in high-income 
countries has resulted from increases in total factor productivity.
Growth accounting may seem a long way from the debate on East Asia, but it 
is actually very relevant. Economists can decompose the overall growth of labor 
productivity into the part that is due to more capital, the part that is due to more 
education, and finally, the part that is the result of TFP growth. The results show 
that the vast majority of labor productivity growth is due to increased capital 
accumulation. In effect, labor productivity grows because each worker has more 
machinery and other forms of physical capital at their disposal. The rapid capital 
accumulation in the East Asian export economies resulted from the very high 
rates of savings and investment in these economies, which is one of their most 
notable features. And, consistent with the pattern in the United States and other 
industrial nations over the same period, TFP growth explains a smaller share 
of overall growth. The relative importance of capital accumulation versus TFP 
growth supports the idea that East Asian export economies are similar in their 
sources of growth to other nations that have achieved high levels of income. If they 
had much higher rates of TFP growth as their source of overall economic growth, 
then it would have supported the idea that they had discovered a new growth for-
mula, that their forms of organization or perhaps some unknown cultural factor, 
gave them an edge in the economic growth race.

While this research says that there is no “East Asian Miracle,” it does not 
reduce the remarkable nature of the growth process in that part of the world. 
Instead of painting a picture of an entirely new growth process, however, the 
research on high-growth, export-oriented East Asian economies illustrates clearly 
how hard work, forgone consumption, and high savings which is productively 
invested, can change a nation’s standard of living in less than a generation.
Summary
■
■The major characteristics of economic growth in the export-oriented Asian 
economies are (1) increasing equality, (2) rapid accumulation of savings 
and high rates of investment, (3) rapid increases in levels of schooling, 
(4) rapid growth of manufactured exports, and (5) stable macroeconomic 
­environments.
■
■The institutional environment is instrumental in creating confidence in pol-
icymakers. The policymaking bureaucracy tends to be insulated from the 
push and pull of the political system. This leads some to decry the lack of 
representation of the population in policy decisions, but it allows decisions 
to be made on technical merit rather than political expediency. The voice of 
business and industry, and to a lesser extent other groups such as consumers, 
is often heard through consultative bodies known as deliberation councils. 
Deliberation councils are a mechanism for the private sector and govern-
ment policymakers to exchange information and discuss policies.
■
■One of the key elements of policy is a stable macroeconomic environment, 
including inflation control, moderate budget deficits, manageable foreign 
debt, and credible exchange rates. While these key macroeconomic vari-
ables differ across countries, they were usually sustainable.
■
■With the exception of Hong Kong, each of the Asian export economies 
followed industrial policies that targeted the development of particular in-
dustries. These policies were most focused in the “northern tier” of Japan, 
Korea, and Taiwan. The effects of these policies are difficult to measure, and 
there is a long and contentious debate about their efficacy.
■
■Each country promoted manufactured exports, again with the exception of 
Hong Kong, which is a large port serving China and East Asia. These poli-
cies largely succeeded, although the mechanisms that link export growth to 
faster GDP growth are still uncertain.
■
■Recent empirical work shows that the main contributor to economic growth 
in the export economies is the extremely rapid accumulation of physical 
capital. Consequently, the argument that they have pioneered a model that 
leads to more rapid total factor productivity growth appears false, and the 
keys to growth should be looked for in the policies that raise savings and 
investment.

INTRODUCTION: NEW CHALLENGES
LO 17.1	 State why China and India are considered disruptive to the world’s 
economic status quo.
When measured in current dollars, China and India are the second and tenth largest 
economies in the world (2015). In population, they are first and second with a com-

their importance is a result of their size, but it is also due to their relatively sudden 
emergence onto the world stage as active traders, investors, and consumers. Until the 
late 1970s, China was relatively isolated from world markets, partly as a result of its 
extreme nationalism under its communist system, and partly as a result of its political 
isolation during most of the Cold War. India participated far more in international 
economic affairs, but its nationalism, together with its extreme poverty and very low 
growth rates limited its economic interactions with other countries. In 1978, China 
began a series of economic reforms that brought it into the world economy, and in 
1991, India’s economic reforms generated more rapid growth and encouraged more 
interactions outside its borders. Beyond their size, it is this dramatic and somewhat

sudden shift away from relative isolation of more than one-third of humanity that 
has called the world’s attention to these two large nations.
Accommodating China and India in the world trading system is a challenge. 
India’s economy was highly regulated before the reforms of the early 1990s, albeit 
less than China’s. Indian reforms focused on privatizing state-owned industries, 
increasing efficiency, reducing red tape, and making its businesses more competi-
tive. As it has grown, its size and competitiveness in some sectors, such as informa-
tion technology and services, biotechnology, and others, have disrupted existing 
markets. Chinese reforms went much deeper and involved a transition away from 
socialism and public ownership of most of its economy, toward capitalism and 
more extensive private ownership. Many more firms in China than in India remain 
state-owned, and pose challenges for the global trading system given that state 
subsidies, government procurement rules, and intellectual property rights are less 
clearly defined when the state is the owner and when prices do not necessarily 
reflect market conditions. China’s enormous size, as the second largest economy in 
the world, together with its aggressive foreign investment and trade policies, and 
its historically unprecedented rate of growth, have caused it to be more disruptive 
of the status quo as it has become integrated with world markets.
India and China were world powers in the past; China has reclaimed that posi-
tion and India is moving in the same direction. History tells us that when world 
powers emerge, it usually creates economic, political, and military challenges for 
other nations and leads to a period filled with transitions and tensions. This chap-
ter surveys the most important economic issues associated with the sudden impact 
on the world economy of the emergence of China and India.

well above one-third of the world total, while output is nearly one-fourth when 
measured in PPP. Their weight in the world economy is relatively recent, unless 
we count back several centuries when they were a much larger share of a much 
less integrated world. As recently as 1950, however, estimates put their share 
of world GDP in the range of 8 to 9 percent. As the world economy grew in the 
second half of the twentieth century, they grew faster than most other countries 
and their shares of the total increased. Figure 17.1 compares the average annual

China’s growth, in particular, has been unprecedented in world history. With 
growth rates that frequently exceeded 10 percent per year, often by a large mar-
gin, it has moved hundreds of millions of individuals and families out of poverty 
and has closed a significant part of the gap in per capita income between itself 
and the world’s high income countries. And while India’s growth rate has neither 
been as spectacular nor historically unprecedented, it has managed to grow faster 
than most middle income countries. This too is remarkable given that its growth 
rate prior to the 1990s was relatively low, and given that the comparison group, 
middle income countries, are usually the fastest growing economies in the world. 
The growth rates for China and India from 1991 to 2014 imply that Chinese GDP 
doubled every 7 years and Indian GDP every 11 years.
Figure 17.2 looks back in history to show the importance of China and India in 
the world economy prior to the industrial revolution. Many economic historians 
date the “great divergence” between East and West as beginning around 1820, 
when Western Europe and North America began to industrialize ahead of most 
other regions of the world. Prior to then, cities in China and elsewhere were as 
modern and prosperous as anything in Europe or the Americas. The industrial 
revolution led to an earlier adoption of new technologies in the first places it 
occurred and generated higher levels of productivity, increased incomes, and ulti-
mately greater military power. Long periods of colonial rule in India and many

decades of military intervention in China by the West, compounded the effects 
of lagging industrial development and helped create a widening gap between 
incomes in China and India on the one hand, and Western Europe and North 
America on the other. By 1870, China and India were rapidly losing ground to the 
new industrial economies. By 1950, they were less than 10 percent of world GDP, 
after having been nearly 50 percent in 1820. In China’s case, there was essentially 
no growth from 1820 to 1950. India fared somewhat better, growing at one-half 
of 1 percent per year, a rate sufficiently slow to ensure that India fell behind the 
industrializing economies of the West.
Since 1950, both countries but especially China have increased their share of 
world’s GDP by growing faster than other countries. Most of the increase in their 
share has occurred since the implementation of economic reforms, after the 1970s. 
The consequences of higher growth have been significant, both for the world econ-
omy and for the citizens of those two nations. In 1981, more than 88 percent of 
China’s population lived in extreme poverty (defined as less than $1.90 a day, 
in 2011 purchasing power parity dollars), while 53 percent of India’s population 
(1983) lived in similar circumstances. By 2010–2011, extreme poverty had fallen to 
just above 11 percent in China and 21 percent in India. Large reductions in extreme 
poverty in countries as populous as China and India translate into hundreds of mil-
lions of people rescued from lives of deprivation and limited opportunity.
While poverty has fallen, a middle class has appeared in both countries. Given 
their large populations, even a small middle class represents purchasing power on 
a scale large enough to influence world demand. The sizes of the middle classes 
are not well-defined but consider a simple hypothetical situation. According to the 
World Bank, in 2010–2011, the 10 percent of the population with highest incomes 
received about 30 percent of total income in both countries. Given China’s spec-
tacular growth over the last several decades and the higher incomes it has gener-
ated, this group is much better off, on average, in China than in India. For the top 
10 percent, sharing 30 percent of total income represents an average of approxi-
mately $26,000 in China and $5,500 in India (in U.S. dollars). The Chinese income 
of $26,000 per person puts them in the same category as Greece or Portugal, and 
just below Spain. The main difference is that 10 percent of China’s population 
represents more than 137 million people, or the equivalent of more than twice the 
size of France, or the United Kingdom, or Italy. The impact on world demand and 
supply is considerable when so many new consumers and producers are added to 
the world economy.
The future growth of China and India will partly depend on their changing 
populations. Figure 17.3 shows past and estimated future populations in both 
countries. Around 2030, China’s population growth is expected to start a long-
run, slow decline. At about the same time, India is projected to pass China as the 
world’s most populous country, and to continue its growth into the foreseeable 
future. Chinese limits on the number of children families may have, together with 
its rapid economic development and increased economic opportunities, particu-
larly for women, have reduced rates of childbirth and increased the average age of 

450

the population. Between 2030 and 2040, population growth will fall below replace-
ment levels and begin to exert a strong influence on economic growth as fewer 
young adults enter the labor force and an increasing share of the population enters 
old age. India’s population is projected to continue growing, although more rapid 
economic development and increased economic opportunities for women could 
alter its trajectory.
Economic Reform in China and India
Economic reform of China’s communist system began in 1978. Under commu­
nism, every aspect of China’s economy was controlled by the state. Private enter-
prise did not exist, and the basic decisions that every economy makes about what 
to produce, how to produce it, and who should receive it were made from the top 
down by government planners and Communist Party politicians. China had limited 
contact with outsiders, and the emphasis of its economic policy was ­self-sufficiency 
in all goods and services.

India’s reforms began in the 1980s and then gathered momentum in 1991 when 
the government was forced to respond to a balance of payment crises. India’s eco-
nomic system was best characterized as socialist, with a mix of state ownership and 
control together with private enterprise. Most large industrial enterprises were 
completely state-owned, however, and the Indian system of regulation meant that 
all firms had to obtain permits for even minor changes. If a firm wanted to expand, 
if it wanted to change its product lines, or even if it wanted to change its board of 
directors, first it had to obtain a permit from the government.
After the reforms, both countries are more market oriented and more active 
participants in the international economy. The remarkable degree of economic 
opening is observable in their individual trade-to-GDP ratios, which increased 
dramatically (see Table 17.2). China’s ratio peaked in 2006, prior to the financial 
crisis, at 65 percent, before falling back to 41.5 percent. Meanwhile, India’s ratio 
has increased beyond the level of China’s and trade continues to grow in impor-
tance. As large countries, we expect the trade-to-GDP ratio to be less than it is 
for smaller countries that must depend on international trade to a greater extent. 
Nevertheless, both countries have emphasized international economic integration 
through trade and investment as part of their reform strategies.
The Reform Process in China
A country’s decision to undertake large-scale economic reform can come from 
many directions. As we saw in Chapter 15, reforms in a number of Latin American 
countries were a result of the debt crisis of the 1980s. In China’s case there was no 
immediate crisis, but rather a long period of instability and disappointment with 
the results achieved under communism. The leader of Chinese economic reforms, 
Deng Xiaoping, put it in terms of a choice between distributing poverty under the 
old system and distributing wealth under a new system.
There was no master plan for Chinese reforms, but rather a gradual, steady 
dismantling of the controls exercised by the state and the Communist Party. Deng 
Xiaoping is famously reported to have described the reforms as analogous to 
“feeling the stones to cross the river.” You advance one foot, see if it holds, then 
advance another. The slow and steady pace of reform was dictated in part by a 
lack of experience and information about how to proceed but also by the fear of 
a reaction from the hard-line, conservative anti-reformers.

Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
The first changes were confined to agriculture and involved loosening the con-
straints on peasant producers by allowing them more control and ownership of 
individual plots of land. Peasants were allowed to sell their product in markets and 
were soon increasing the quantity of foodstuff available. Foreign trade under the 
old system was controlled by twelve foreign trading corporations (FTC), which 
were attached to the various branches of government. All exports and imports 
went through the FTC and were strictly regulated with no consideration given to 
comparative advantage. The reforms gradually opened trade, first through the cre-
ation of additional FTC and then through a series of steps that removed price 
controls and ended export subsidies. To limit the initial impact of reforms on the 
domestic economy and to prevent a political backlash, China created a number 
of Special Economic Zones (SEZ), which were modeled on the concept of export 
processing zones (EPZ). Recall from the case study of Mexican manufacturing 
in Chapter 5 that an EPZ allows duty-free imports, usually under the condition 
that they are processed and re-exported, often after having been incorporated 
into another product. SEZ went further by giving provincial and local authorities 
wide latitude to experiment with radically different economic and trade policies. 
Incentives were given to form joint ventures with foreign producers who came to 
the SEZ to set up production facilities. Between 1979 and 1988, China created 
five SEZ, all of which successfully attracted foreign investment (particularly from 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the overseas Chinese business communities), generated 
a large flow of exports, and helped raised the rate of economic growth. The SEZ 
created a demonstration effect for the rest of China, and other regions began to 
push for similar policies.
China also applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) in 1986. Membership requires a country to describe all trade and eco-
nomic policies that may affect GATT agreements and to open bilateral nego-
tiations with individual members over any issues of concern. Negotiations were 
difficult and lasted until China joined the WTO in 2001. The protracted period 
of negotiations probably kept the reform process moving forward and ultimately 
resulted in a strong Chinese commitment to an open economy, both for trade and 
for investment.
Indian Economic Reforms
Indian reforms began gradually in the 1980s and speeded up considerably after the 
1991 crisis. Three forces played significant roles in preparing Indian policymakers 
for the necessary changes. First, India’s primary trade partner, the USSR, suffered 
a number of setbacks through the 1980s and finally dissolved itself in 1991. India 
had partially modeled its economic policies on the USSR, and its demise laid bare 
the failure of its economy to produce prosperity. Second, the success of several 
East Asian countries was important. In 1960, South Korean and Indian income 
per capita were about the same, but by 1990, Korea was entering the ranks of 
the developed world, while India remained stuck at low levels of income. When 
­Manmohan Singh, the finance minister who carried out many of the reforms, 

Chapter 17    China and India in the World Economy 
453
visited Korea in 1987, he was shocked to see how far behind India had fallen. 
Third in the list of forces was a financial crisis that developed as a result of heavy 
borrowing by the government. When the Gulf War (1991) drove up oil prices and 
cut off the flow of remittances from Indian workers in the Gulf States, the country 
was left with inadequate foreign reserves and an inability to finance its debt.
The changes in economic policy that followed touched on a number of areas, 
including the permitting process. India’s regulation of its economy was based on a 
system of permits that stifled innovation and creativity with their extensive, compli-
cated, and inefficient rules. Permits were intended to prevent the creation of pow-
erful interests that might undermine democracy and promote inequality. Yet, their 
unintended consequence was that they fostered inefficiency, and by protecting Indian 
businesses from competition, both domestic and foreign, they thereby allowed them 
to operate without regard for product quality or firm efficiency. Many of the larger 
firms were state-owned, and, as in the Chinese and Russian cases, the state-owned 
sector of the economy operated without the imperative of profitability. Firms could 
lose money for years and still continue in business since, as state-owned, they had 
no hard budget constraints. Losses were covered by the government budget, even as 
it meant a drain on government revenue and fewer resources for important public 
projects such as safe drinking water, highways and ports, rural education, and other 
needs. Privatization was the second set of reforms begun after the crisis of 1991.
A final critical area that began to receive attention from the reformers was 
international trade and investment. Indian trade policy was based on the idea of 
import substitution industrialization (see Chapter 5), the same as Latin America 
and other developing regions after World War II. Domestic firms received high 
levels of protection, exports were implicitly discouraged, and self-sufficiency was 
the goal. India’s famous Ambassador car is an example. Protected from foreign 
imports, it remained essentially the same for nearly 40 years. Why go through the 
expense of changing the product line if there is a captive market? In addition to 
dismantling many of the restrictions on trade, India also began to dismantle the 
restrictions on inward foreign investment.
Shifting Comparative Advantages
Both China and India have undergone profound changes in the last several 
decades. The breadth and depth of the reforms constitute a definitive break in 
their historical trajectories and are shifts from low-growth, relatively closed econo-
mies, to higher growth and relatively open ones. The two countries are at different 
stages of this transformation, however, and further changes are required if they 
hope to close the income gaps with high income countries.
China’s remarkable transformation of its economy was partly accomplished by 
the movement of large numbers of people from the countryside to the city and 
from agriculture to manufacturing. This shift in location and activities resulted 
in a decline in low value-added production in agriculture and its replacement 
with higher value-added production in low-skilled manufacturing. The change 
in employment was consistent with China’s comparative advantage given its 

454
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
abundant supplies of unskilled labor, and led to dramatic increases in income. 
Workers in labor-intensive manufacturing still had relatively low marginal prod-
ucts and the low wages that implies, but their marginal products and wages were 
much higher than in agriculture. China supported this shift with a variety of 
policies encouraging investment in manufacturing and infrastructure, industrial 
policies such as subsidies for key sectors and state-owned enterprises, and fewer 
restrictions on trade and foreign investment.
China’s next transformation requires it to build a high-consumption economy. 
Its current success has depended on extremely high rates of investment. New 
cities were built, together with high-speed trains and highways, power plants, 
steel mills, car factories, and all the other facilities that helped turn the country 
into the largest exporter of manufactured goods in the world. Yet its ability to 
keep growing by increasing its level of investment has come to a close. China 
is currently investing over 45 percent of its annual GDP when most advanced 
economies annually invest 15 to 25 percent. At some point, the payoff from 
additional investments begins to decline and over capacity becomes endemic. 
China has reached a saturation point in many industries, such as steel, where 
its capacity to produce far exceeds its ability to export or to absorb the output 
into the domestic economy. Too much investment is a different problem from 
too little, but it is still a problem and represents a waste of resources. The long 
term macroeconomic challenge is to shift those expenditures toward consump-
tion, leading to a higher standard of living today, rather than in the future. The 
­short-term problem is the mountain of private and public debt that was taken on 
as investors built factories and housing that turned into excess capacity which 
has no ability to generate needed revenue.
India, by contrast, has not yet moved as large a proportion of its population 
out of low value added agriculture and into manufacturing. It continues to have 
a large majority of its population residing in rural areas (69 percent in 2010) and 
working in agriculture (51 percent) where productivity is low and poverty remains 
a serious problem. For India to follow China in the transformation of employ-
ment away from agriculture and into low-skilled, labor-intensive manufacturing 
it must overcome many obstacles, including its lack of infrastructure in the form 
of transportation and utilities, limited education, and the obstacles of complex, 
unreliable, institutions.
Neither China nor India score well in the Doing Business Index which 
­measures the ease of starting and running a business, nor in measures of 
­governance (see Chapter 16). Consequently, markets are more limited than they 
might be, and large amounts of labor and many small businesses remain in the 
informal sector where it is harder for them to obtain capital and develop into large 
enterprises. This is particularly true in India where a complicated bureaucracy is 
filled with red tape and regulations to the extent that it ranks 130th out of 189 
countries in its ease of doing business. China does somewhat better, but still ranks 
in the middle, scoring 84th out of 189. Neither country comes close to the export-
oriented economies of East Asia. In the long run, institutional development is as 
important as other forms of development.

Why Did the USSR Collapse  
and China Succeed?
In contrast to the Russian experience, the Chinese economy did not decline at 
all during its transition from communism to capitalism. Although its reforms 
were begun in 1978, until the mid-1980s they mainly affected the agricultural 
sector. Since China had such a large share of its population in rural areas, the 
positive effects on food output and rural incomes were significant. Primarily, 
the agricultural reforms let families and villages take individual responsibil-
ity for meeting their production quotas and allowed them to consume or sell 
whatever amount they produced above the quota. Villages and communes were 
allowed to disband the collectivist system of production, and individual incen-
tives began to rule the efforts and decision making of producers.
In the mid-1980s, China extended its market-based reforms to a num-
ber of SEZ, Economic and Technology Development Zones (ETDZ), High 
Technology Development Zones (HTDZ), and other special developmental 
areas, located mostly along the coast. The rules of each type of zone varied, but 
in general they allowed far more independent, profit-oriented, market-based 
decision making. The SEZ, in particular, were encouraged to experiment with 
new forms of economic organization and to develop joint ventures by attract-
ing foreign investment. These areas began to account for the bulk of Chinese 
growth, exports, and foreign investment.
China’s transition strategy is considered a gradualist strategy because it 
did not attempt to reform the entire economic structure all at once. Rather, it 
used a dual track strategy, which localized reforms to certain areas or sectors 
(e.g., agriculture) while maintaining traditional, central planning structures in 
the remainder of the economy. Slowly, subsidized prices were raised to the 
market level and the mandatory production targets were reduced to a small 
share of the total output or zero. By the early to mid-1990s, more than 90 
percent of retail prices and 80 to 90 percent of agricultural and intermediate 
goods prices were decontrolled. China has been much slower to privatize its 
state-owned sector.
Many observers argue that the gradual implementation of reforms in a 
slow but steady sequence removed the pressure to instantaneously develop 
new institutions and economic relations. By adopting a dual track approach, 
China allowed the market economy to develop alongside the centrally planned 
economy and to gradually take over more and more of its functions. Perhaps

such as the United States.
India and China have influenced the direction of world trade and investment. 
As they have become more integrated with the rest of the world, multinational 
businesses have quickly moved to establish production and distribution net-
works inside both countries and Chinese and Indian firms have begun to invest 
outside their home markets. Between 1990 and 2014, China and India’s share 
of inward foreign direct investment grew from 1.8 percent of the world total to 
13.2 percent. The majority was directed toward China, but India received the 
third largest total of any Asian economy, after China and Singapore. Similarly, 
trade flows have grown significantly. This is most notable in the case of China, 
even more importantly than avoiding an economic downturn, it gave the Chi-
nese people time to adjust their expectations to fit a market-based system and 
reduced the shock of change.
The proponents of rapid reform see China as a special case. First, central 
planning was less extensive in China, with the result that its economy was 
less distorted and less over concentrated on heavy industry. Second, and most 
importantly, China’s economy is much more agricultural. In 1978, when China 
began its reforms, 71 percent of the labor force was in agriculture. The figure 
for Russia in 1990 at the beginning of its transition was 13 percent. China’s 
heavier concentration in agriculture gives it a large rural labor force with very 
low productivity. If these workers leave the countryside, the resulting loss of 
output is small, while the offsetting productivity gains from employment in 
urban and village industrial enterprises are significant. Hence, China can move 
labor from agriculture into the new enterprises, but Russia had to take labor 
out of heavy industry to staff the new enterprises.
Janos Kornai, the eminent Hungarian economist and perceptive observer 
of the transition, summarized the debate in the following terms:
Some developments are rapid, others slow. Some call for a one-stroke inter-
vention while many others come about through incremental changes. . . .  
The emphasis has to be on consolidation, stability, and sustainability, not 
on breaking speed records1 (Finance and Development, September 2000).

which has begun to have a very significant impact on world trade and investment 
patterns, but India also has increased its share of both merchandise goods and 
services trade.
Figure 17.4 shows the growth of China and India’s share of world exports of 
goods and services, 1990 to 2015. As shown, the majority of their growth is due to 
the increase in Chinese exports, primarily goods, but services as well. The Indian 
economy, which is about one-fifth the size of China’s, lags behind China in its 
growth of merchandise goods exports and its share of the world total, but it has 
nearly as large a share of world services exports, reflecting strengths in informa-
tion technologies, business services, and other high-skilled services.
Chinese and Indian Trade Patterns
China’s transformation has turned it into the world’s largest exporter of merchan-
dise goods and the 5th largest exporter of services. India’s economic transforma-
tion has not progressed as far as China’s, and it still has half of its labor force 
in agriculture, and a majority of its population in rural areas. Nevertheless, it is 
the 19th largest exporter of merchandise goods and the 8th largest exporter of 
services.
Chinese and Indian trade is with an overlapping set of trade partners that 
reflect their proximity to large markets and energy suppliers. The gravity model 
of international trade uses just two variables to predict which countries trade 
with each other: distance and GDP. The model hypothesizes that, all else equal,

countries will trade more if they are closer to each other and therefore have lower 
transportation costs, and if their GDP is larger so that they are a larger market. 
The model is called a gravity model because it resembles Newton’s Law of Uni-
versal Gravitation which asserts that the gravitational pull between two bodies is 
proportional to their individual mass and to their distance. In the gravity model 
of trade, distance is considered directly and the metaphor for physical mass is 
market size, or GDP. The gravity model predicts that China and India will trade 
more with larger economies, and especially ones that are close by. This is a good 
approximation of the trade pattern of the two countries.
China’s top five export markets are the United States, the European Union, 
Hong Kong, Japan, and Korea. Its top import sources are similar, with Taiwan 
replacing Hong Kong. This pattern is embedded in Chinese production, as made 
clear in the discussion below of China’s trade balances and its impact on global 
manufacturing. India’s top export markets are nearly the same, except China fig-
ures prominently as does the oil-rich United Arab Emirates. Indian imports are 
primarily from China, the EU, and the relatively close oil-producing countries, 
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
The gravity model is particularly useful for thinking about China’s export 
and import markets. The United States, the European Union, and Japan are 
obviously large markets for their exports given their size and their wealth. Simi-
larly, those countries export to China because it is large too, and in the case 
of Japan and Korea, because they are relatively close. The fact that China has 
a number of large ports on its east coast also makes it a convenient trading 
partner for many countries. Proximity and GDP explain a significant part of 
the trade patterns.
China’s role as the largest exporter of manufactured goods is enhanced by 
its proximity to Japan, Korea, and even the United States which is reachable by 
relatively low-cost ocean transport. Recall from Chapter 4’s discussion of United 
States–China trade, and the case study of the iPhone 3G manufacturing, that 
China plays an integral part in a production system that is spread across the globe. 
In the case of the iPhone, production of components was done in Germany, Korea, 
Japan, and the United States, and assembly into the final product was in China. 
China’s proximity to specialized design and high-technology manufacturing in 
Japan and Korea enables it to take part in the production chain of high-technology 
products, even if its own production capacity is not yet as sophisticated as Japan’s 
or Korea’s. Participation in production chains of high-technology products is not 
the only form China’s trade takes, but it is a key part of its overall trade pattern 
and its trade relations with more advanced industrial economies. Proximity to 
large markets that are rich in technology and sophisticated, well-off, consumers 
encourages this pattern.
Tariffs and Protection
As noted, India lags China in the development of a large manufacturing sector, 
and in its export of manufactures. India is more rural, and has not yet experienced 

Chapter 17    China and India in the World Economy

the mass migration of agricultural laborers into the cities on the scale that China 
and other industrializing countries have. Consequently, agriculture remains a core 
part of its production. Given that agriculture is not particularly efficient in India, 
and that many farmers struggle with little or no capital, the Indian government 
protects them from foreign competition with high tariffs and extensive quotas. 
In general, both China and India have relatively low tariffs and relatively open 
markets, but Indian agriculture is an exception. Table 17.3 shows average tariff 
rates applied by both countries and for agricultural and nonagricultural products. 
Tariff rates vary by product, and the averages in Table 17.3 are weighted by the 
relative importance of the individual goods that are tariffed.
Agriculture in India is protected because it is relatively inefficient, yet it occu-
pies over one-half of the total labor force (2010). The nation’s long-run growth 
requires it to transform agriculture into a leaner sector with fewer workers and 
higher levels of productivity. In most countries, China included, that process has 
entailed large migrations from the countryside to the city. Workers give up low 
productivity agriculture and engage in manufacturing and urban services which 
are still low productivity by the standards of high-income countries, but much 
higher than in the countryside they left. This process leads to the development of 
a low skill, labor-intensive manufacturing sector which is an important step on the 
way to industrial development.
Undoubtedly, India would raise income levels faster if it engaged in this trans-
formation. The cost of such a transformation, however, is an extreme amount 
of dislocation of communities, families, and individuals, along with a complete 
change in lifestyles, cultures, and habits. As a democracy, India cannot force eco-
nomic changes in the way that authoritarian regimes can. Forcing families and 
individuals off the land, either through direct action or extreme neglect, is pain-
ful and is not a policy that democracies can easily practice. Hence, high tariffs 
in agriculture may be economically inefficient because they help keep people in 
agriculture, but tariffs provide some protection to rural workers who are unable 
to leave the land, albeit at the cost of higher food prices.

demand for imports and has benefitted economies as diverse as African exporters 
of minerals, Argentine and Brazilian producers of soybeans, and German machin-
ery manufacturers. On the other hand, the rise of Chinese manufacturing is cor-
related in time with the decline of manufacturing employment in the United States 
and Western Europe. We do not know with certainty if China’s rising manufactur-
ing sector is responsible for the decline in manufacturing in the United States and 
elsewhere, but some analysts have pointed out that cities and communities that 
compete directly with Chinese exports have not fared well in recent years, and 
that this is directly a result of Chinese exports.
That is one possibility. However, it is uncertain what might have happened 
to manufacturing in the United States and elsewhere if China had remained iso-
lated. Setting aside the human tragedy and the deep poverty such isolation implies, 
the question that cannot be answered is whether manufacturing employment in 
high-income countries would have declined more slowly, or not at all, if China 
had not grown so fast. Some of the forces shaping the economies of advanced 
industrial nations are completely independent of China. Technological advances 
in manufacturing such as the increasing use of automated processes and robotics 
would probably have proceeded anyway. Telecommunications and transporta-
tion advances, which enable firms to locate parts of their production in different 
countries, would also have occurred. Consequently, it is not certain what would 
have been the course of manufacturing in advanced economies if China had not 
entered the picture.
In addition to its enormous productive capacity, China is a huge market for 
goods and services produced outside the country. It is, in fact the second larg-
est importer of both goods and services. Nevertheless, as shown in Figure 17.5, 
China has consistently run trade surpluses since at least 2000, often by a large 
margin. Trade surpluses reflect its focus on exports and investment-driven 
growth, and its desire to build large foreign exchange reserves after the Asian 
Crisis of 1997–1998. Persistent large trade surpluses have heightened trade ten-
sions in the world economy. Some observers argue that China accomplishes the 
trade surpluses by manipulating its currency and keeping it undervalued. More 
careful analysis can show that China’s currency may have been undervalued 
against the dollar in the first part of the 2000s, but that has not been the case 
since 2006 or 2007. In other words, currency manipulation is not the source of 
its competitiveness. Furthermore, China is not the only country that has adopted 
a strategy of trade surpluses and export-oriented growth. German trade sur-
pluses are frequently as large as Chinese, and sometimes larger. Both Germany 
and Japan have adopted export-oriented growth strategies, as have a number 
of smaller economies, including those discussed in Chapter 16. Hence, China is 
not unique in its policy of large trade surpluses. Nevertheless, the task of accom-
modating China and its very large current account surpluses poses a challenge 
for the world economy.

Chapter 17    China and India in the World Economy 
461
Looking Forward
Chapter 4’s case study on Chinese exports to the United States give some idea of 
the direction China’s trade is moving. Table 4.4 lists the top ten exports of China 
to the United States. Among them are low-technology items, such as apparel, 
footwear, toys, and furniture, and a few high-technology items, such as cell 
phones, telecommunications equipment, computers, and computer accessories. 
In this chapter and in Chapter 4 it was emphasized that China is not yet as large 
a producer of high-technology products as its exports make it seem since those 
products are often assembled in China from technical components made else-
where. Nevertheless, it is clear that the country is engaged in extensive industrial 
upgrading and that more and more sophisticated products are coming. One indi-
cator of this trend is the number of patents issued. In 2013, China’s patent office 
granted 143,535 patents to residents of the country. The United States, in contrast, 
issued 133,593 to its residents (Japan issued 225,571). China is also spending large 
sums on its infrastructure, including universities.
Industrial upgrading in China is supported by the ability of its large market to 
attract a significant share of the world’s foreign direct investment. From 2005 to 
2014, it pulled in 7.7 percent of total world FDI, on average each year. By con-
trast, the United States received 13.7 percent on average, each year. China has 
aggressively required foreign investors to license their technologies to Chinese

producers and to take on Chinese partners, so that new technology and methods 
are made available to Chinese firms. Over time, we should expect to see a grow-
ing and increasingly sophisticated manufacturing capacity that moves well beyond 
assembly operations.
India has attracted large amounts of foreign direct investment as well, albeit 
not on the scale of China. In addition, as discussed, it has been less successful 
in the creation of a low-skilled, labor-intensive manufacturing sector. In recent 
years, however, Indian trade has captured the world’s attention though its ability 
to participate in the growing area of services trade. Several factors account for 
this, not the least of which is the fact that English is spoken by educated Indians. 
In addition, India’s leadership has consistently emphasized higher education and 
technology, and although there is a severe shortage of places in India’s universi-
ties, its leading institutions, such as the India Institute of Technology (IIT), are 
among the world’s best. There is possibly no greater example of a sector in any 
country that has benefited from the advent of the telecommunications revolution 
than India’s high-tech sector.
A closer examination of Chinese and Indian service exports highlights this fact 
and points to another important difference in the two economies. China’s service 
exports are larger than India’s, although not by as much as its goods exports. More 
important is the composition of each country’s service exports. China has a deficit 
in services, which primarily comprise transportation and travel services (shipping 
and business and personal travel). India has a surplus in services, which primarily 
comprise information services and other business services, two high-growth areas.
India’s computer and information services and other business services include 
medical consultations, data entry, legal briefs, and myriad other activities that 
are now sometimes performed at a distance and then sent over the Internet to 
the final user of the information. As described in Chapter 4, the outsourcing of 
services depends on the telecommunications revolution, including the Internet, 
video conferencing, satellite communications, and the software to take advantage 
of the services offered. In the past, most services were consumed at the point of 
production, but as technology allows a separation of production from consump-
tion or use, services have begun to be outsourced in the same way that manufac-
turing has been for decades.
A key question for India is whether it can skip industrialization and jump ahead 
into a predominantly services economy. That is, can its relatively strong services 
exports serve as a replacement for the development of an extensive manufactur-
ing sector? Might it pioneer a new development model that does not first require 
industrialization with low-skill, labor-intensive manufacturing, but instead jumps 
right into a high-skilled services economy? It seems unlikely. First, India is not 
abundant in high-skilled, highly educated labor that is needed in high-skilled ser-
vices. This is not to say that it does not have excellent engineers, software pro-
grammers and developers, medical doctors, and other highly trained individuals, 
but they are not its abundant factor. Nor will they become relatively abundant 
any time soon, given the shortage of universities and other educational facilities. 

Chapter 17    China and India in the World Economy 
463
Hence, services trade will continue to be important and will likely continue to 
grow, but it will not become the core of the Indian economy.
FOUR ISSUES
There are numerous challenges to existing trade patterns and trade relations posed 
by the integration of China and India into the world trading system. We will look 
at four such challenges: Indian services, Chinese manufacturing, the demand for 
resources, and China’s challenge to multilateral institutions.
Services
Services such as shipping have been traded for decades, as shipping companies 
hire crews around the world and register their vessels in the most convenient loca-
tion, selling their services to firms wherever they are in need. Business services 
and information services, however, are relatively new to international trade since 
they can be traded only if technology and infrastructure can pass large amounts 
of information across long distances at low costs. Since the mid-1990s, this has 
been possible, and trade in information and computer services has taken off. The 
outsourcing of services from high-income industrial economies to India is a new 
arena for the application of comparative advantage.
As with all economic changes, some people benefit and some are hurt. It 
is clear, however, that there are net benefits overall for national economies. 
Consider the case of the United States. As the hardware for computer and infor-
mation technology (IT) has become less expensive, IT services and software 
and not hardware are taking the majority share of total IT spending by U.S. 
businesses. Outsourcing reduces the price of IT services and software, makes 
business-specific applications cheaper to purchase, and allows businesses to 
achieve higher levels of productivity at a lower cost. It is another case of com-
parative advantage–based trade, the same as described in Chapters 3 and 4. 
In this case, India’s comparative advantage allows it to trade with the United 
States and other high-income countries and to contribute to the increase in their 
productivity while at the same time creating good-paying jobs and advancing 
its own economy.
Those who oppose this form of trade fear that all computer and IT work will 
end up in developing countries. This seems highly unlikely. For example, the 
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects significant job growth in the United 
States in IT-related occupations. These new workers and many already in the 
IT services sector will not continue to do the same thing, however, as the com-
parative advantage of the United States is shifting within the IT field. While 
demand for computer programmers may decline, database administrators, hard-
ware and software engineers, systems analysts, and a host of other occupations 
are expected to grow.

Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
Manufacturing
China’s emergence as an export platform and as a high-volume manufacturer 
of consumer goods challenges existing trade patterns and manufacturing trends. 
The challenge to middle-income markets that compete directly with China, such 
as Mexico, Brazil, Malaysia, and Thailand, is to reduce their dependency on 
low wages as the primary source of their comparative advantage. The challenge 
appears in the form of intense competitive pressures from low-cost goods pro-
duced in China, but the nature of the challenge is beginning to change. Chi-
nese manufacturing wages have been low, but they are rapidly rising. In some 
cases, electronics and other production has begun to migrate to lower-age coun-
tries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand. Nevertheless, the competitive 
­pressure of low-wage manufacturing in China is not likely to disappear anytime 
soon and countries that compete on the basis of labor costs alone are unlikely 
to succeed. For example, Mexico’s export processing zone lost a large share of 
its apparel sector when China entered the WTO. Mexico’s geographic advan-
tage next to the U.S. market was nullified for products that do not need a rapid 
turnaround between order and delivery. The effect on some of the manufactur-
ing in high-income countries is similar, such as apparel in the United States and 
Italy. Furthermore, as China expands its exports of more sophisticated prod-
ucts such as cars, the competitive pressure are spreading into other sectors of 
manufacturing.
China has several sources of comparative advantage in manufacturing. Its 
abundance of low-wage, low-skilled labor has already been mentioned, as has 
its large domestic market. One way to look at China is as a large economy that 
confers the advantage of scale economies when producing for the domestic mar-
ket. Coupled with overall growth and expansion of its middle class, the demand 
for manufactured goods is increasing rapidly and will continue to absorb a larger 
share of Chinese output. A third advantage is China’s coastal areas, which have 
potentially convenient logistics for trading internationally. China continues to 
invest heavily in its port facilities and coastal infrastructure in an effort to develop 
its geographic advantages.
There are also a few institutional disadvantages that reduce China’s competi-
tiveness. One is the overall business climate, as mentioned already. A related dis-
advantage is China’s inability to enforce intellectual property rights. This was the 
main point of contention between the United States and China in its accession to 
the WTO, and it continues to be a major issue in China’s relations with its trading 
partners. Some firms routinely resist making investments in China for fear that 
their products will be copied, and firms that do invest often limit themselves to 
product lines that do not contain trade secrets. China meets WTO standards, but 
its enforcement is ineffective. Chinese firms frequently reverse engineer products, 
produce a knock-off at a fraction of the price of the imported good since no royal-
ties are paid, and expand across the domestic market. Many observers believe that 
China’s enforcement will not become effective until China itself has significant 
intellectual property to protect.

Chapter 17    China and India in the World Economy 
465
Resources
China’s rapid growth has increased its appetite for natural resources. For resource 
producers in Latin America, including Brazil, and in Africa, this has been a boon 
since China is below the world’s per capita average in all major natural resources 
except coal. Copper, oil, iron ore, and other minerals have experienced spikes in 
their world prices, which are in part related to Chinese demand. Simultaneously, 
a number of developing countries have been able to sign long-term agreements 
that will provide them with investment for exploration and supply contracts for 
the delivery of their resources. China’s substantial export earnings are available 
for purchasing the resources it will need as it continues its development.
The fact that China buys its resources from other developing countries does 
not guarantee that the countries selling the resources will spend the money well. 
And sudden shifts in Chinese growth rates can have a large effect on countries 
that sell resources. For example, China’s stated goal of reducing its growth rate 
from 10 percent per year to around 7 percent per year has a significant effect on 
its demand for commodities and their prices. Countries such as Brazil, Argentina, 
and Chile that export large quantities of raw materials to China must adjust to a 
sudden change in the prices they earn.
Multilateral Institutions
 As noted in Chapters 2 and 16, China has created the Asian Infrastructure Invest-
ment Bank (AIIB). This was the outcome of a series of efforts to provide alterna-
tive financing and monetary support to other developing countries, particularly 
but not only those in Asia. China has made significant investments in Africa and 
Latin America as well. There are a variety of motives for these efforts. On the one 
hand, China is interested in securing access to raw materials and infrastructure 
development assistance in Africa, Latin America, and developing Asia can be use-
ful for that purpose. In addition, Chinese leaders are interested in gaining political 
and economic influence beyond their own borders that is commensurate with its 
new status as a world power. China’s long relative isolation from the end of World 
War II up until the 1970s and 1980s meant that it did not actively participate in 
the creation of many multilateral institutions nor in their operation. That left it 
without a strong say in the policies of the IMF, World Bank, and the WTO. As 
China’s economy has grown and become more central to world trade and pay-
ments, it is natural that its government would want a larger say in the operation of 
multilateral institutions, and that if that is not possible to the extent desired, that 
it might seek to establish new alternatives.
The AIIB is the first significant alternative multilateral institution created by 
China (see Chapter 2). It is too new to judge its effectiveness in fulfilling the tasks 
it has set itself. Regardless, China is likely to keep pushing for greater recognition 
and authority that is commensurate with its economic status and power. It has, 
for example, persuaded the IMF to accept its currency, the yuan, as a reserve cur-
rency that can be used to settle international payments, and it is clearly aiming at 

466
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
eventually gaining some of the status and uses currently held by the U.S. ­dollar. 
The role of yuan in international trade and payments will evolve, along with other 
Chinese initiatives to establish its position in international economic affairs.
Unresolved Issues
The integration of China and India in the world trading system poses a number of 
problems, some of which have been discussed. Two that have not been touched 
on are the impact of both countries on the world’s environmental systems, and 
the increasingly contentious issue of state ownership of manufacturing enterprises 
that trade across borders.
Environmental Pressures  Rapid growth in two countries with more than one-third 
of the world’s population puts pressure on the environment. China’s development 
has been partly at the expense of its natural capital of water, air, and soil, and 
its population suffers from toxic contamination of its cities, and many parts of 
its countryside. China’s per capita energy consumption is well below that of the 
United States, but it consumes more energy per unit of GDP produced. Given its 
large coal deposits (its one abundant natural resource), it has become reliant on an 
energy source that generates a high level of green house gases. Much of the same 
is true of India, although its democracy allows for more pushback from citizens 
when they are subjected to environmental degradation.
Both countries acknowledge the problems of the environment. Nevertheless, in 
the discussion of global warming, India points out that the world’s rich economies 
used the environment in destructive ways in order to reach their current levels of 
high income. Asking middle-income countries such as India and China to make 
sacrifices in energy consumption and GDP growth for the sake of future genera-
tions is, in their view, somewhat hypocritical. Better, India argues, for the world’s 
rich countries to make sacrifices, particularly since they generated the majority 
of green house gases.
China and India both continue to generate large amounts of greenhouse 
gases, even as they attempt to transition to alternative energy sources. China, in 
particular, has made large investments in solar power, but the size of both their 
economies and the still developing technology of solar implies that the transition 
to clean energy is not happening soon. China’s extremely rapid growth has also 
increased the intensity of many other forms of pollution and has challenged the 
ability of its environmental controls to keep up with its economic growth. Conse-
quently, environmental challenges continue to increase, often in alarming ways 
that affect the safety of food systems, drinking water, and other basic elements of 
everyday life. Both China and India will have to address these issues if they are 
going to have a secure future.
State Capitalism  China and India use the powers of the state to shape economic 
outcomes in a way that suits their national development goals. Market forces are 
important, but when a market outcome is thought to be harmful or less benefi-
cial to national interests, states intervene. In China, where this process is most 

Chapter 17    China and India in the World Economy 
467
developed, state-owned enterprises (SOE) control a large share of the economy, 
particularly in industries thought to be important to future economic develop-
ment. India has fewer state-owned enterprises after the reforms of the 1990s, but 
it still has quite a few.
WTO rules allow state-owned enterprises, but they require countries to treat 
them at arm’s length and as if they were private. Direct links from government to 
enterprise are to be minimized, and SOE are not allowed to be subsidized or given 
special treatment. In practice, it is hard to tell when a SOE is receiving subsidies in 
the form of tax breaks, easy access to credit, favorable legislation, or some other 
type of preference that is not a direct payment. This has created significant trade 
tensions with the United States and the European Union, where it is viewed as an 
unfair trade practice. The United States has reacted by levying both anti-dumping 
duties and countervailing duties on Chinese products, and has begun to include 
rules on state-owned enterprises in proposed trade agreements, such as the Trans-
Pacific Partnership (see Chapter 13).
This issue overlaps the issue of unbalanced trade since subsidized industries are 
potentially more competitive. Given that Indian trade balances tend to run toward 
deficits, their state-owned enterprises are less likely to face opposition from other 
countries. China, by contrast, uses its SOE as a primary tool for implementing its 
policies, and together with its large surpluses, it is more vulnerable to complaints 
of unfair trade practices.
The Choices Ahead
As China and India, and other large middle-income countries, grow economically, 
there are political reactions to their participation in world markets. Negotiations 
for China’s accession to the WTO led to a series of bilateral agreements between 
China and its trading partners that allow voluntary export restraints and other 
measures to block Chinese exports if they threaten firms in importing countries. 
The U.S. Congress introduced, and then retracted under political pressure, a mea-
sure that would label China’s previous exchange rate management system as an 
unfair trade advantage. Although China altered its exchange rate system for its 
own reasons, there continue to be calls in the United States to punish China for 
what some politicians claim is blatant currency manipulation to achieve commer-
cial advantages. If those voices were ever to be successful, it would legitimize 
blocking some Chinese exports from entering the United States. Similar measures 
have not been proposed for India, although the outsourcing by firms of their IT 
work has led to calls for the re-examination of policies that may be encouraging 
firms to go abroad. In the end, however, measures against China and India become 
difficult to enforce because for every firm hurt by Chinese or Indian imports, 
others are helped by the low prices and availability of their goods and services. 
Hence, trade measures to stem trade flows will hurt businesses and consumers 
that depend on the imports.
If Chinese success in particular is frightening to some politicians, businesses, 
and workers, Chinese failure should be seen as an even greater threat. For 

468
Part 4    Regional Issues in the Global Economy
example, the country is unlikely to begin to make serious headway in addressing 
its environmental problems unless it has political stability and some degree of 
economic prosperity. The switch to cleaner energy sources is highly unlikely if 
the country is struggling against economic failure or political instability. The same 
holds for its ability to address the problems of water and air pollution, missing 
urban infrastructure, and other remediation needed to counter the effects of rapid 
economic growth.
China and especially India still have large numbers of people living in pov-
erty or not far above. While conditions have significantly improved for many, not 
everyone has benefited from growth, and many who have are falling farther and 
farther behind the new economic elites in both countries. In China this has led 
to growing dissatisfaction and rising protest. India’s democratic system creates 
more legitimate means for changing leaders who do not deliver, whereas China’s 
growing inequality is seen by many as a potential threat to the current system. A 
failure of its economic project would undoubtedly worsen economic inequality 
and lead to greater social unrest.
Summary
■
■India and China are the two most populous countries in the world. By the 
early 2000s, they had over 20 percent of world GDP. Their high rates of 
economic growth have brought increased prosperity to many people, and 
significantly reduced rates of poverty, although many people remain poor.
■
■Indian economic growth lags Chinese. China has moved large numbers of 
workers out of the countryside and agriculture and into low-wage, ­low-skilled 
manufacturing. India has not yet experienced a similar transformation and 
more than half its labor force remains in agriculture where productivity is 
low and poverty is high.
■
■Both countries undertook extensive economic reforms. China began in 1978 
and India in the 1980s, but more strongly in 1991. The reforms led to much 
higher growth rates in both countries.
■
■China is one of the few formerly communist countries that did not suffer a 
loss of output during its transition to the market economy. This is partly a 
result of a more cautious approach to reforms, but also because of its large 
agricultural sector. When it began its reforms, about 70 percent of its labor 
force was in agriculture, much of it very low productivity. A loss of workers 
to that sector did not result in a decline in output.
■
■Institutions remain relatively weak in both countries. China scores in the 
middle of 189 countries while India is in the bottom third in the Doing Busi-
ness Index. Both are below average in most of the dimensions considered by 
the Worldwide Governance Index.

■
■China and India have had a very rapid growth of imports and exports. ­China’s 
manufacturing sector is extremely competitive and relies on technology 
imports. Its exports are mostly low-technology goods or high-technology 
goods assembled in China from imported parts, although this is changing 
and strong industrial upgrading is taking place. Exports of Indian business 
services and computer and information services have taken off since the 
middle of the 1990s. This type of trade in services represents a new area of 
trade but is another application of the theory of comparative advantage.
■
■Trade and growth in China and India pose several challenges for other coun-
tries. China’s manufacturing sector has a strong comparative advantage in 
the production of goods that need abundant supplies of low-wage labor, 
while India’s production of business services and computer and information 
services is supported by its English-speaking engineers and technicians.
■
■China’s and India’s growth has levied a toll on both society and the environ-
ment. Particularly in China, where water, air, and soil resources are degrad-
ing rapidly.

	17.6	 What are the sources of China’s comparative advantage and how does that 
show up in the goods it trades?
	17.7	 What are the factors that make India competitive in business services and 
computer and information services? Do these factors give it a comparative

ics, a place where nations can borrow after all 
sources of commercial lending have dried up. 
Today, the IMF (International Monetary Fund) 
fills this role.
Lost Decade.  The period of recession in Latin 
America brought on by the region-wide debt cri-
sis beginning in August 1982. There is no official 
date ending the Lost Decade, but 1989 is a useful 
benchmark, since it coincided with a new strategy 
for handling the crisis.
Maastricht Treaty.  Sometimes called the Treaty on 
Economic and Monetary Union. Ratified in 1991 
by the members of the European Union, its most 
visible provision includes the single currency pro-

western Europe in the 1500s, during the period 
in which modern nation states were emerging 
from feudal monarchies. Mercantilism has been 
called the politics and economics of nation build-
ing because it stressed the need for nations to 
run trade surpluses to obtain revenues for armies 
and national construction projects. Mercantilists 
favored granting monopoly rights to individuals 
and companies, they shunned competition, and 
they viewed exports as positive and imports as 
negative. Today, the term mercantilism is some-
times used to describe the policies of nations that 
promote their exports while keeping their markets 
relatively closed to imports.
Merchandise trade balance.  Exports of goods minus 
imports of goods.

set of accounts for a nation showing the compo-
nents of GDP. These have both an income view 
and a product view. In theory, they are equivalent,

total value of output produced.
National treatment.  The idea that foreign firms oper-
ating inside a nation should not be treated differ-
ently from domestic firms.
Neoliberal model or neoliberalism.  Market funda-
mentalism that became common throughout Latin 
America in the late 1980s and 1990s.
New Trade Theory.  A new approach to modeling 
international trade that began in the 1980s. New

Nontariff barrier (NTB).  Any trade barrier that is 
not a tariff. Most important are quotas, which 
are physical limits on the quantity of permitted 
imports. Nontariff barriers include red tape and 
regulations, rules requiring governments to pur-
chase from domestic producers, and a large num-
ber of other practices that indirectly limit imports.
Nontariff measure.  Nontariff measures are nontar-
iff barriers that are not quotas. They include red 
tape or cumbersome and unevenly applied rules. 
In general, the term refers to any regulatory or 
policy rules other than tariffs and quotas that 
reduce the physical quantity of imports or exports.
Nontransparent.  Not easily interpreted or under-
stood. For example, some countries use red tape 
and bureaucratic rules to block imports.

influence bank reserves and interest rates.
Opportunity cost.  The value of the best forgone 
alternative to the activity actually chosen.
Optimal currency area.  A region of fixed exchange 
rates or a single currency. A currency area is opti-
mal in the sense that it is precisely the right geo-
graphical size to capture the benefits of fixed rates 
without incurring the costs.
Orthodox model.  An orthodox stabilization policy 
is designed to cure inflation by the following: cut-
ting government spending, limiting the creation 
of new money, and reforming the tax system. See 
also Heterodox.
Outsourcing.  Outsourcing is the shifting of procure-
ment from within a firm to outside a firm. It is often 
used to refer to services that are purchased abroad,

and the manufacturing process, followed by sta-
bilization of design and production, and a final 
stage of complete standardization.

similar purposes but that are different in one or 
more dimensions. Most consumer goods are dif-
ferentiated products.

nonexcludability and nonrivalry or nondiminish-
ability. If they are excludable but nondiminish-
able goods, they are sometimes called collective 
goods.

rates or incomes designed to keep constant the 
real purchasing power of money when converted 
from one currency to another.

Regional trade agreement (RTA).  Agreements 
between two or more countries, each offering the 
others preferential access to its markets. RTAs 
provide varying degrees of access and variable 
amounts of deep integration.
Relative price.  The price of one good in terms of 
another good. It is similar to a money price, which 
expresses the price in terms of dollars and cents, 
but relative price is in terms of the quantity of the 
first good that must be given up in order to buy 
a second good.
Rent seeking.  Any activity by firms, individuals, or 
special interests that is designed to alter the distri-
bution of income to their favor. Political lobbying, 
legal challenges, and bribery are common forms of 
rent-seeking behaviors, which use resources (labor 
and capital) but do not add to national output. For 
this reason, rent seeking is a net loss to the nation.
Resource curse.  The economic and/or political prob-
lems caused by an abundance of one valuable 
natural resource such as petroleum.
Revaluation.  An increase in the value of a currency 
under a fixed exchange rate system. See also

for the Bretton Woods exchange rate system.
Social networks.  Members of a migrant’s family or 
village that provide support in the migrant’s new 
location.
Social returns.  Social returns include private returns, 
but they add costs and benefits to the elements of 
society that are not taken into consideration in the 
private returns. For example, a firm that generates 
pollution that it does not have to clean up imposes 
costs on society, which causes social returns to be 
lower than private returns.
Soft peg.  An exchange rate system that is fixed but 
that allows some fluctuation within a set range or 
that is periodically adjusted to reduce changes in 
the real exchange rate. See Hard peg.

Forward markets.
Stabilization policies.  National macroeconomic poli-
cies designed to cure inflation and reduce a gov-
ernment deficit. Stabilization policies are usually 
a first step in compliance with IMF conditionally 
during a macroeconomic crisis. See also Structural 
adjustment policies, Orthodox stabilization poli-
cies, and Heterodox.
Standstills.  An agreement between international 
creditors and debtors to allow a temporary halt 
to the payment of interest and principal on previ-
ous loans.

role in shaping market outcomes to ensure they 
serve the national interest.
Statistical discrepancy.  The sum of the current, capi-
tal, and financial accounts (multiplied by minus 
one).
Sterilization.  Sterilization refers to the actions by 
a central bank to counteract the money supply 
effects of an inflow of foreign currency. Without

the domestic money supply as recipients of foreign 
funds convert them to domestic money. With ster-
ilization, the central bank removes excess money 
from the economy with open market operations.

European Union to involve itself in individual 
national affairs is limited to issues that are trans-
national in scope. In current practice, this includes 
environmental policies, regional policies, research 
and technology development, and economic and 
monetary union.
Subsidies.  Government assistance for industry. The 
Uruguay Round of the GATT defined subsidies 
as direct loans or transfers, preferential tax treat-
ments, a direct supply of goods, or income and 
price supports.
Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM).  An 
agreement to limit subsidies that also specified when 
countervailing measures were allowed that emerged 
from the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations.

mation and capacity from one country to another.
Terms of trade (TOT).  The average price of a coun-
try’s exports divided by the average price of 
imports: TOT = (index of export prices)/(index 
of import prices). A decline in the terms of trade 
means that each unit of exports buys a smaller 
amount of imports.
Total factor productivity (TFP).  A measurement of 
the quantity of output per unit of input. Increases 
in TFP mean that overall productivity has 
improved and that a given level of inputs will cre-
ate more output; hence, technology or enterprise 
organization must have improved.
Trade adjustment assistance (TAA).  Government 
programs that offer temporary assistance to work-
ers who lose jobs because of foreign trade or their 
firms moving abroad.
Trade balance.  Net exports, that is, the difference

of nations that reduces or eliminates barriers 
between themselves while maintaining higher 
tariffs and other barriers to trade against non-
member, third-party countries.
Trade creation.  The opposite of trade diversion. 
Trade creation occurs when trade policies cause 
a shift in production from a higher-cost producer 
(often a domestic one) to a lower-cost producer.
Trade deficit.  A negative merchandise trade balance; 
the deficit may or may not include measurement 
of services trade.
Trade diversion.  The opposite of trade creation. 
Trade diversion occurs when trade policies cause 
a shift in production and imports from a lower-
cost producer to a higher-cost producer.

economies to market-based economies. Transi-
tion economies include most of the countries that 
adopted socialist or communist ideologies during 
the twentieth century.
Transparent.  Describes any trade barrier that is 
clearly defined as a barrier. Tariffs have the most 
transparency (are the most transparent) because 
they are usually clearly specified and published in 
each country’s tariff code. Any disguised or hidden 
trade barriers cause a country’s trade policy to be 
nontransparent.
Treaty of Rome.  The funding document of the Euro-
pean Economic Community (EEC), the Treaty of 
Rome was signed by six nations in 1957 and went 
into force in 1958. The EEC has since become the 
European Union and includes fifteen members, 
but the Treaty of Rome remains its core legal 
document.

Maastricht Treaty, it is the agreement that deep-
ened EU integration from a common market to 
an economic union.
Unilateral transfers.  A component of the current 
account that measures the grants from one coun-
try to another.
Uruguay Round.  The last concluded round of tariff 
negotiations within the GATT framework, the

ernment direction as an allocative mechanism.
World Bank.  A Bretton Woods institution, origi-
nally charged with the responsibility for providing 
financial and technical assistance to the war-torn 
economies of Europe. In the 1950s, the World Bank 
began to shift its focus to developing countries.
