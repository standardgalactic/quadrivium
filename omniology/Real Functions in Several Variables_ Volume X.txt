Real Functions in Several Variables: Volume X

Preface
Preface
The topic of this series of books on “Real Functions in Several Variables” is very important in the
description in e.g. Mechanics of the real 3-dimensional world that we live in. Therefore, we start from
the very beginning, modelling this world by using the coordinates of R3 to describe e.g. a motion in
space. There is, however, absolutely no reason to restrict ourselves to R3 alone. Some motions may
be rectilinear, so only R is needed to describe their movements on a line segment. This opens up for
also dealing with R2, when we consider plane motions. In more elaborate problems we need higher
dimensional spaces. This may be the case in Probability Theory and Statistics. Therefore, we shall in
general use Rn as our abstract model, and then restrict ourselves in examples mainly to R2 and R3.
For rectilinear motions the familiar rectangular coordinate system is the most convenient one to apply.
However, as known from e.g. Mechanics, circular motions are also very important in the applications
in engineering. It becomes natural alternatively to apply in R2 the so-called polar coordinates in the
plane. They are convenient to describe a circle, where the rectangular coordinates usually give some
nasty square roots, which are diﬃcult to handle in practice.
Rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates are designed to model each their problems.
They
supplement each other, so diﬃcult computations in one of these coordinate systems may be easy, and
even trivial, in the other one. It is therefore important always in advance carefully to analyze the
geometry of e.g. a domain, so we ask the question: Is this domain best described in rectangular or in
polar coordinates?
Sometimes one may split a problem into two subproblems, where we apply rectangular coordinates in
one of them and polar coordinates in the other one.
It should be mentioned that in real life (though not in these books) one cannot always split a problem
into two subproblems as above.
Then one is really in trouble, and more advanced mathematical
methods should be applied instead. This is, however, outside the scope of the present series of books.
The idea of polar coordinates can be extended in two ways to R3. Either to semi-polar or cylindric
coordinates, which are designed to describe a cylinder, or to spherical coordinates, which are excellent
for describing spheres, where rectangular coordinates usually are doomed to fail. We use them already
in daily life, when we specify a place on Earth by its longitude and latitude! It would be very awkward
in this case to use rectangular coordinates instead, even if it is possible.
Concerning the contents, we begin this investigation by modelling point sets in an n-dimensional
Euclidean space En by Rn.
There is a subtle diﬀerence between En and Rn, although we often
identify these two spaces. In En we use geometrical methods without a coordinate system, so the
objects are independent of such a choice. In the coordinate space Rn we can use ordinary calculus,
which in principle is not possible in En. In order to stress this point, we call En the “abstract space”
(in the sense of calculus; not in the sense of geometry) as a warning to the reader. Also, whenever
necessary, we use the colour black in the “abstract space”, in order to stress that this expression is
theoretical, while variables given in a chosen coordinate system and their related concepts are given
the colours blue, red and green.
We also include the most basic of what mathematicians call Topology, which will be necessary in the
following. We describe what we need by a function.
Then we proceed with limits and continuity of functions and deﬁne continuous curves and surfaces,
with parameters from subsets of R and R2, resp..

Preface
Continue with (partial) diﬀerentiable functions, curves and surfaces, the chain rule and Taylor’s for-
mula for functions in several variables.
We deal with maxima and minima and extrema of functions in several variables over a domain in Rn.
This is a very important subject, so there are given many worked examples to illustrate the theory.
Then we turn to the problems of integration, where we specify four diﬀerent types with increasing
complexity, plane integral, space integral, curve (or line) integral and surface integral.
Finally, we consider vector analysis, where we deal with vector ﬁelds, Gauß’s theorem and Stokes’s
theorem. All these subjects are very important in theoretical Physics.
The structure of this series of books is that each subject is usually (but not always) described by three
successive chapters. In the ﬁrst chapter a brief theoretical theory is given. The next chapter gives
some practical guidelines of how to solve problems connected with the subject under consideration.
Finally, some worked out examples are given, in many cases in several variants, because the standard
solution method is seldom the only way, and it may even be clumsy compared with other possibilities.
I have as far as possible structured the examples according to the following scheme:
A Awareness, i.e. a short description of what is the problem.
D Decision, i.e. a reﬂection over what should be done with the problem.
I Implementation, i.e. where all the calculations are made.
C Control, i.e. a test of the result.
This is an ideal form of a general procedure of solution. It can be used in any situation and it is not
linked to Mathematics alone. I learned it many years ago in the Theory of Telecommunication in a
situation which did not contain Mathematics at all. The student is recommended to use it also in
other disciplines.
From high school one is used to immediately to proceed to I. Implementation. However, examples
and problems at university level, let alone situations in real life, are often so complicated that it in
general will be a good investment also to spend some time on the ﬁrst two points above in order to
be absolutely certain of what to do in a particular case. Note that the ﬁrst three points, ADI, can
always be executed.
This is unfortunately not the case with C Control, because it from now on may be diﬃcult, if possible,
to check one’s solution. It is only an extra securing whenever it is possible, but we cannot include it
always in our solution form above.
I shall on purpose not use the logical signs. These should in general be avoided in Calculus as a
shorthand, because they are often (too often, I would say) misused. Instead of ∧I shall either write
“and”, or a comma, and instead of ∨I shall write “or”. The arrows ⇒and ⇔are in particular
misunderstood by the students, so they should be totally avoided. They are not telegram short hands,
and from a logical point of view they usually do not make sense at all! Instead, write in a plain
language what you mean or want to do. This is diﬃcult in the beginning, but after some practice it
becomes routine, and it will give more precise information.
When we deal with multiple integrals, one of the possible pedagogical ways of solving problems has
been to colour variables, integrals and upper and lower bounds in blue, red and green, so the reader
by the colour code can see in each integral what is the variable, and what are the parameters, which

do not enter the integration under consideration. We shall of course build up a hierarchy of these
colours, so the order of integration will always be deﬁned. As already mentioned above we reserve
the colour black for the theoretical expressions, where we cannot use ordinary calculus, because the
symbols are only shorthand for a concept.
The author has been very grateful to his old friend and colleague, the late Per Wennerberg Karlsson,
for many discussions of how to present these diﬃcult topics on real functions in several variables, and
for his permission to use his textbook as a template of this present series. Nevertheless, the author
has felt it necessary to make quite a few changes compared with the old textbook, because we did not
always agree, and some of the topics could also be explained in another way, and then of course the
results of our discussions have here been put in writing for the ﬁrst time.
The author also adds some calculations in MAPLE, which interact nicely with the theoretic text.
Note, however, that when one applies MAPLE, one is forced ﬁrst to make a geometrical analysis of
the domain of integration, i.e. apply some of the techniques developed in the present books.
The theory and methods of these volumes on “Real Functions in Several Variables” are applied
constantly in higher Mathematics, Mechanics and Engineering Sciences. It is of paramount importance
for the calculations in Probability Theory, where one constantly integrate over some point set in space.
It is my hope that this text, these guidelines and these examples, of which many are treated in more
ways to show that the solutions procedures are not unique, may be of some inspiration for the students
who have just started their studies at the universities.
Finally, even if I have tried to write as careful as possible, I doubt that all errors have been removed.
I hope that the reader will forgive me the unavoidable errors.

Introduction to volume X,Vector Fields I; Gauß’s Theorem
Introduction to volume X,
Vector Fields I; Gauß’s Theorem
This is the tenth volume in the series of books on Real Functions in Several Variables.
It is the ﬁrst volume on Vector Fields. It was necessary to split the material into three volumes
because the material is very big. In this ﬁrst volume we deal with the tangential line integral, which
e.g. can be used to describe the work of a particle when it is forced along a given curve by some force.
It is here natural to introduce the gradient ﬁelds, where the tangential line integral only depends on
the initial and the terminal points of the curve and not of the curve itself. Such gradients ﬁelds are
describing conservative forces in Physics.
Tangential line integrals are one-dimensional in nature. In case of two dimensions we consider the
ﬂux of a ﬂow through a surface. When the surface ∂Ωis surrounding a three dimensional body Ω,
this leads to Gauß’s theorem, by which we can express the ﬂux of a vector ﬁeld V through ∂Ω, which
is a surface integral, by a space integral over Ωof the divergence of the vector ﬁeld V. This theorem
works both ways. Sometimes, and most frequently, the surface integral is expressed as space integral,
other times we express a space integral as a ﬂux, i.e. a surface integral. Applications are obvious in
Electro-Magnetic Field Theory, though other applications can also be found.
The present volume should be followed by reading Volume XI, Vector Fields II, in which we deﬁne
the rotation of a vector ﬁeld V in the ordinary three dimensional space R3 and then describe Stokes’s
theorem. We shall also consider the so-called nabla calculus, which more or less shows that the theorems
mentioned above follow the same abstract structure.
Gauß’s and Stokes’s theorems have always been considered as extremely diﬃcult to understand for
the reader. Therefore we have given lots of examples of worked out problems.

32.1
Introduction
We shall in this book introduce the analogues of the diﬀerential and integral calculus for functions in
one variable, extending the theory to vector ﬁelds. Since we are dealing with ﬁelds, we give ordinary
functions the name scalar ﬁelds.
The main issue will be to extend the following equivalent rules for a function F : [a, b] →R, where
we assume that its derivative F ′ : [a, b] →R exists and is continuous (of course half tangents at the
endpoints). The ﬁrst one is
 b
a
F ′(x) dx = F(b) −F(a).
In this one-dimensional version this well-known formula can also be interpreted in the following way.
To the left the interval of integration [a, b] ⊂R has the boundary ∂[a, b] = {a, b} consisting of the
two endpoints, a and b. Therefore, when we move from left to right, the ordinary integration of the
derivative F ′(x) over the interval [a, b] is replaced by the right hand side, where we in some sense
(to be deﬁned later on) “integrate” the function F(x) itself (without being diﬀerentiated) over the
two boundary points ∂[a, b] = {a, b}. This is a geometrical/topological idea combined with measure
theory. We shall deal with the problem of how to generalize the above to all the various forms of
integrals, which we have already met, i.e. to line, plane, space and surface integrals.
The second rule, which we want to generalize to functions or vector ﬁelds in several variables, is, given
F as above,
F(x) = F(a) +
 x
a
F ′(ξ) dξ.
In this case we may expect some reconstruction formulæ of a scalar or vector ﬁeld, given its derivatives.
We may of course also expect some diﬃculties in this process, because for the time being it is not
obvious how the partial derivatives of F(x) (a function in several variables) should enter the right
hand side of the generalization of the equation above.
To ease matters, we shall only specify the domains and the order of diﬀerentiability needed of the
scalar or vector ﬁelds under consideration in important deﬁnitions and theorems. Otherwise, when
these properties are not explicitly described, we shall tacitly assume that F(x), or F(x), is of class
C∞, so it is always allowed to interchange the order of diﬀerentiation. Also, in these cases, the domain
will always be a nice one.
Since this chapter in particular is supporting physical theories, we shall in most cases only consider
domains which lie in either R3 or R2.
32.2
The tangential line integral. Gradient ﬁelds.
The tangential line integral is introduced in Physics, when we shall calculate e.g the work, which a
force executes on a particle bound to a ﬁxed curve. Let V denote the force (given as a ﬁeld in the
space), and let F be a given curve in space of a given parametric description, so we can determine
its tangent vector ﬁeld t. If ds denotes the inﬁnitesimal length element on K, then the inﬁnitesimal
work done by V on a unit particle at x ∈K must be V · t ds, cf. Figure 32.1.

Tangential line integrals
Figure 32.1: Geometrical analysis of the tangential line integral. Here t is the unit tangent vector
ﬁeld to the curve K, and V is a vector ﬁeld, where we are going to integrate the dot product V · t
along K.
We get the total work done of V on this unit particle by integrating along the curve K, a process we
denote by anyone of the symbols

K
V · t ds,
or

K
V · dx,
or

K
V(x) · dx,
depending on the context. Note the appearance of the dot product.
If V instead denotes an electrical ﬁeld, then the tangential line integral along K is equal to the
diﬀerence in potential between the end point and the initial point, provided that we can neglect the
contribution from inductance.
Assume that the curve K has the parametric description x = r(τ), where r : [α, β] →Rn is a C1
vector ﬁeld. If furthermore, r′(τ) = 0, then the unit tangent vector ﬁeld is given by
t =
r′(τ)
r′(τ),
and
ds = r′(τ) dτ,
hence
dx = r′(τ) dτ.
Since r′(τ) is cancelled by this process, we may allow that we in some points have r′(τ) = 0, as
long as this set is small. We quote without proof,
Theorem 32.1 Reduction of a tangential line integral. Assume that K is an oriented continuous and
piecewise C1 curve in the domain A ⊆Rn, given by the parametric description r : [α, β] →Rn, where
r is injective almost everywhere, and where r′ = 0 also almost everywhere.
Let V : A →Rn be a C0 vector ﬁeld. Then we have the following reduction of the tangential line
integral of V along K,

Tangential line integrals
The abstract integral in blue is to the left, and the ordinary 1-dimensional integral (in black), which
can be calculated, is to the right. We note that we introduce a compensating factor to the integrand
in the dot product to the right.
Clearly, the value of the integral changes its sign, when the orientation of the curve is reversed, or, if
the particle is moved in the opposite direction.
The tangential line integral is also called the current of the vector ﬁeld along the curve.
Example 32.1 The following simple example is only illustrating the methods. It will probably never
be met in practice.
Given the vector ﬁeld
V(x, y, z) =

for (x, y, z) ∈R3.
We shall show how we ﬁnd its current along the curve K of the parametric description

When we use rectangular coordinates in R3 we also write
V · t ds = V(x) · dx = (Vx, Vy, Vz) · ( dx, dy, dz) = Vx dx + Vy dy + Vz dz,
where we have put V = (Vx, Vy, Vz) and ( dx, dy, dz) in rectangular coordinates. In this case the
result of Theorem 32.1 is written

and similarly for rectangular coordinates in the general space Rn.
An important special case, is when K is a closed curve, i.e. its endpoints coincide. In this case the
tangential line integral is called the circulation of the vector ﬁeld V alont K, and it is denoted

K
V(x) · dx,
or e.g.

K
Vx dx + Vy dy + Vz dz.
The shall below consider the important vector ﬁelds V (the gradient ﬁelds), for which the circulation
is 0, no matter the choice of an admissible curve K in the deﬁnition of the circulation. But ﬁrst we

We then introduce the gradient ﬁelds, i.e. vector ﬁelds V, for which there exists a C1 function F, such
that

We get by the chain rule (cf. Section 9.2) that

In other words, for gradient ﬁelds the value of the tangential line integral along K only depends on
the endpoints and not on the permitted curve joining the endpoints. Thus, if K1 and K2 are two
permitted curves between the same endpoints, then

let a, b ∈A. then

K
▽F(x) · dx = F(b) −F(a)
for every continuous and piecewise C1 curve K lying in A with initial point a ∈A and ﬁnal point
b ∈A.
The reader who is familiar with the Theory of Complex Functions will in case of n = 2 recognize this
as connected with analytic functions. In Physics, the gradient ﬁeld ▽F in R2 and R3 is interpreted
as a conservative vector ﬁeld.
We shall now prove the important circulation theorem.
If we choose K as any permitted curve in A from a point a ∈A to another point x ∈A, and the
gradient ﬁeld ▽F is given in A, then we get by a rearrangement of the result of Theorem 32.2,
F(x) = F(a) +
 x
a
▽F(u) · du,
so we can reconstruct F(x), using our knowledge of V(u) = ▽F(u). Note that we are strictly speaking
only given that V(u) is a gradient ﬁeld, so to begin with we only know the existence of the function
F, so the right formulation of the above would be that
F(x) = F(a) +
 x
a
V(u) · du,

Tangential line integrals
where it is given that V is a gradient ﬁeld.
We note that if furthermore the endpoints coincide, a = b, the curve K is closed, so the circulation is
for gradient ﬁelds,
C =

K
▽F(x) · dx = 0,
and we have proved that the circulation of a gradient ﬁeld along any closed curve is always 0.
Then we prove the opposite, namely that if the circulation of V along every closed curve in the open
domain A of V is zero, then V is a gradient ﬁeld. The idea is of course to construct the function F
and then prove that it is indeed a primitive of V.
We choose a ﬁxed point a ∈A, i.e. the open domain of V, and we let x ∈A be any other (variable)
point in A. Since by assumption

K
V(u) · du = 0
for every closed (permitted) curve K in A, it follows that the tangential line integral from a to x is
independent of the integration path from a to x.
In fact, let K1 and K2 be any two paths from a to x, and let −K2 denote the path from x to a of K2
in the reversed direction. Then the concatenated curve K := K1 −K2 is closed, so by splitting the
integral,
0 =

K
V(u) · du =

K1
V(u) · du −

K2
V(u) · du,
and it follows by a rearrangement, that the value of the integral of the diﬀerential form V(u) · du
does not depend on the path from a to x.
We can therefore unambiguously deﬁne the function
F(x) :=
 x
a
V(u) · du,
where we can choose any (permitted) integration path from a to x.
The increase of this function is the diﬀerence
∆F = F(x + h) −F(x) =
 x+h
x
V(u) · du.
Since A was assumed to be an open domain, and x ∈A, we can choose r > 0, such that x + h ∈A,
whenever h < r. Then the whole line segment [x; x + h] lies in A, whenever 0 < x < r, which we
assume in the following. When we integrate along this line segment, it follows from the mean value
theorem, cf. e.g. Section 9.5 or Section 20.2, that there exist numbers θ1, . . . , θn ∈]0, 1[, such that
∆F =

h {Vi (x + θih) −Vi(x)} →0
for h →0,
because |hi/x| ≤1 is bounded, and because V is continuous.
We therefore conclude that the
constructed function F is diﬀerentiable of the gradient ▽F = V.
Hence, we have proved
Theorem 32.3 The circulation theorem. A C0 vector ﬁeld V on A is a gradient ﬁeld, if and only if
the circulation is 0 for every closed permitted curve K contained in A,

K
V · dx = 0.
In practice it is only possible to use Theorem 32.3 to prove that a given vector ﬁeld is not a gradient
ﬁeld. The vector ﬁeld in Example 32.2 is therefore not a gradient ﬁeld, because we have found a closed
curve, along which the circulation is −π = 0.
The circulation does not always have to be zero in important applications. If e.g. H denotes a magnetic
ﬁeld, an K is a closed curve, then Amp`ere’s law says that the circulation of H along K is given by

K
H · t ds = I,
where I is the current, which is linked by the closed curve K. Since in general, I = 0, this means that
the magnetic ﬁeld is not a gradient ﬁeld.
We shall then derive some other criteria which assure that a given C1 vector ﬁeld V is a gradient
ﬁeld. Assume to begin with that V is a gradient ﬁeld. Then there exists a scalar ﬁeld F, such that
V = ▽F. We then call the scalar ﬁeld F a primitive of the vector ﬁeld V, or of the diﬀerential form
V(x) · x.
Clearly, if V has the primitive F, then all primitives o V are given by F + c, where c ∈R is an
arbitrary constant.
Let us furthermore assume that V is a C1 gradient ﬁeld (and not just C0) with the C2 primitive F.
Then we have in coordinates

So whenever V is a C1 vector ﬁeld, a necessary condition for V being a gradient ﬁeld is that
(32.1)
∂Vi
∂xj
= ∂Vj
∂xi
for all i, j ∈{1, . . . , n}.
Whenever (32.1) holds, we call
V · dx = V1 dx1 + · · · + Vn dxn
a closed diﬀerential form. Thus the diﬀerential of a C2 gradient ﬁeld is always a closed diﬀerential
form.
Unfortunately, this necessary condition is not suﬃcient. We need an extra condition on the domain
A of V, namely that A is simply connected, cf. Section 5.9.
Simply connected domains are easy to describe in R2. Let A ⊆R2 be a connected plane set. Every
closed bounded curve K in R2 divides the plane into three mutually disjoint sets, the curve K itself, the
outer and unbounded open set B1, and the inner and bounded open set B2. We say that A is simply
connected, if for every closed curve K in A, the inner bounded set B2 by this division is contained in
A, thus B2 ⊂A. This is very easy to visualize on a ﬁgure. The typical example of a connected plane
set, which is not simply connected, is R2 \{0, because if we as K choose the unit circle, then the point
0 lies inside K and not in A = R2 \ {0}.

Tangential line integrals
In higher dimensions simply connected sets are more diﬃcult to visualize. For instant the set R3 \{0}
is simply connected.
The problem is of cause that we, opposite to the plane case, cannot deﬁne
precisely what lies inside a closed curve. However, at broad class of connected sets is consisting of
simply connected sets, and the members are also easy to visualize, namely the star-shaped domains.
The open domain A is called star-shaped, if there is a point a ∈A, such that for every other x ∈A
the straight line segment from a to x lies entirely in A, i.e.
[a; x] := {(1 −λ)a + λ | λ ∈[0, 1]} ⊆A.
We shall only formulate the following theorem for star-shaped sets, because the proof here is fairly
simple, and we note that it is also true in general for simply connected sets,
Theorem 32.4 The primitive of a gradient ﬁeld. Let A ⊆Rn be a star-shaped open domain, and
assume that V : A →Rn is a C1 vector ﬁeld, which fulﬁls the condition
∂Vi
∂xj
(x) = ∂Vj
∂xi
(x)
for all x ∈A and for all i, j ∈{1, . . . , n}.
Then V is a gradient ﬁeld, and a C2 scalar primitive is deﬁned by
F(x) :=
 x
a
V(u) · du,
for all x ∈A,
where a ∈A is ﬁxed, and where we integrate along any continuous and piecewise C1 curve lying in A
and going from a to x.
Every primitive of V is of the form F + c, where c ∈R is a constant.
Proof. Given the assumptions of Theorem 32.4. Since A is star-shaped, we choose the point a ∈A,
such that any other point x ∈A can be “seen from a by a straight line segment lying totally in A.
Using, if necessary, a translation, we may assume that a = 0. We then deﬁne
F(x) := x ·
 1

V(τx) dτ,
x ∈A,
where the path integral here is another way to write the line integral from a = 0 to x alont the straight
line segment [0; x] ⊆A. Then

and we have proved that ▽F = V, so V is indeed a gradient ﬁeld. ♦
Example 32.3 The proof of Theorem 32.4 gives a concrete solution formula, once the assumptions
have been checked. Namely, calculate the line integral of the diﬀerential form V(x) · dx along the
straight line segment [a; x]. We shall demonstrate this method on the vector ﬁeld
V(x, y, z) =

y2 + z, 2xy + 2yz2, 2y2z + x

,
for (x, y, z) ∈R3,
where we have the coordinate functions
Vx(x, y, z) = y2 + z,
Vy(x, y, z) = 2xy + 2yz2,
Vz(x, y, z) = 2y2z + x.
We ﬁrst check
∂Vx
∂y = 2y = ∂Vy
∂x ,
∂Vx
ddz = 1 = ∂Vz
∂x ,
∂Vy
∂z = 4yz = ∂Vz
∂y ,
so V · dx is a closed diﬀerential form. Since A = R3 is trivially star-shaped, it follows from Theo-
rem 32.4 that V(x) is a gradient ﬁeld.
According to the theorem, one possible solution formula is
F(x) = x ·

∂F
∂x = z + y2 = Vx,
∂F
∂y = 2xy + 2yz2 = Vy,
∂F
∂z = x + 2y2z = Vz,
so F(x, y, z) = xz + xy2 + y2z2 is indeed a primitive of V. We then get all primitives by adding an
arbitrary constant c ∈R. ♦

Tangential line integrals
The method of radial integration, as in Example 32.3, often requires some hard calculations. We
note, however, that we may choose other and more reasonable integration paths. A commonly used
method is integration along a continuous step line, where each of the steps is parallel to one of the
coordinate axes. When we describe this method we assume for convenience that we integrate from 0.
If a →b designates that we integrate along the straight line segment between a and b, then the idea
is – whenever possible – to use the following paths of integration,
1) In R2:
(0, 0) →(x, 0) →(x, y).
2) In R3:
(0, 0, 0) →(x, 0, 0) →(x, y, 0) →(x, y, z),
We see that each arrow represents an integration along an axiparallel line segment. More explicitly,
1) In R2, the vector ﬁeld is V(x, y) = (Vx(x, y), Vy(x, y)), and the line integration from (0, 0) can be
written
F(x, y) =
 x
0
Vx(τ, 0) dτ +
 y
0
Vy(x, τ) dτ,
because V(x, y)·( dx, dy) = Vx(x, 0) dx on the line segment from (0, 0) to (x, 0), since here dy = 0,
and V(x, y)·( dx, dy) = Vy(x, y) dy on the line segment from (x, 0) to (x, y), because here dx = 0.
2) In R3 the vector ﬁeld is V(x, y, z) = (Vx(x, y, z), Vy(x, y, z), Vz(x, y, z)), so the analogue solution
formula becomes
F(x, y, z) =
 x
0
Vx(τ, 0, 0) dτ +
 y
0
Vy(x, τ, 0) dτ +
 z
0
Vz(x, y, τ) dτ.
In some cases this step line does not lie in A, but one may modify this construction to obtain this
property by choosing another axiparallel step line. It should be easy for the reader to carry out the
necessary modiﬁcation in such cases.
The advantage of this method is that all usual variables, except for one, are constants in each of the
subintegrals. If we in particular integrate from 0, then we get lots of zeros in the integrands, so some
of the terms may even disappear. We shall see this phenomenon in Example 32.4 below.
It may occur in some cases that we cannot ﬁnd F(x) everywhere in A by only using a simple step line
as above, though we may get a result in a nonempty subset B ⊂A. Then it is legal just to check by
diﬀerentiation, if we indeed have ▽F = V in all of A, and that solves the problem.
Example 32.4 We consider again the gradient ﬁeld from Example 32.3 above, (no need to check
once more that it is a gradient ﬁeld),
V(x, y, z) =

y2 + z, 2xy + 2yz2, 2y2z + x

,
for (x, y, z) ∈R3,
where we have the coordinate functions
Vx(x, y, z) = y2 + z,
Vy(x, y, z) = 2xy + 2yz2,
Vz(x, y, z) = 2y2z + x.
Then by the method of step lines,
F(x, y, z)

which is calculated with less eﬀort than in the method of Example 32.3. ♦

Tangential line integrals
A third method is to manipulate with the diﬀerential form V(x)· dx by using the rules of computation
of diﬀerentials in the “unusual direction” ﬁnally getting dF(x), where F(x) is the wanted primitive.
This method requires some skill, though it is also the most elegant one, because if one succeeds, then
there is no need to check the assumptions of Theorem 32.4.
Example 32.5 Consider again from the two previous examples
V(x, y, z) =

y2 + z, 2xy + 2yz2, 2y2z + x

,
for (x, y, z) ∈R3,
where we have the coordinate functions
Vx(x, y, z) = y2 + z,
Vy(x, y, z) = 2xy + 2yz2,
Vz(x, y, z) = 2y2z + x.
Then the corresponding closed diﬀerential form is
V(x, y, z) · ( dx, dy, dx) =

y2 + z

dx +

2xy + 2yz2
dy + (2yz + x) dz.
The strategy is to split all the terms and then pair them, so that they can stepwise be included as the
diﬀerential of some function. When we deal with polynomials we may also collect terms of the same
(general) degree. In general, if e.g. we have a function ϕ(y) in y alone as a factor of dy, then use that
ϕ(y) dy = dΦ(y), where Φ′(y) = ϕ(y). Similarly for the other variables.

from which we conclude that V has a primitive, so it is a gradient ﬁeld, and that modulo a constant
this primitive is given by
F(x, y, z) = xy2 + xz + y2z2.
We note again that this method has the advantage that if it succeeds, then it is not necessary to check
the assumptions of Theorem 32.4. ♦

32.3
Tangential line integrals in Physics
Consider a unit particle which moves along a curve K under the action of a force F(x). Then the
work done by this force is given by the tangential line integral
W =

K
F(x) · dx.
If F = −▽Ep is a gradient ﬁeld, then the work is independent of the path, so

K
F(x) · dx = Ep(A) −Ep(B),
where A is the initial point of K and B is the ﬁnal point, The function Ep with the conventional minus
sign in front of it, is the potential energy.
A force F, which is also a gradient ﬁeld, is in Physics called a conservative force.
The tangential line integrals are especially used in Electro-magnetic Field Theory. An electric ﬁeld
E = E(x, t), where t is the time variable, describes the force per unit charge, so when one unit of charge
is moved along the curve K, then the work done by E(x, t) is equal to the tangential line integral
W =

K
E(x, t) · dx.
If K is closed, we get the circulation of the electric ﬁeld along K. This is also called the electromotive
force (emf) applied to the closed path K,
emf =

K
E(x, t) · dx,
although this is not a force, but an energy.
If E(x) is time-independent, we call it a static electric ﬁeld. In this case the circulation along a closed
curve K is always zero,
emf =

K
E(x) · dx = 0,
so E(x) is in this case a gradient ﬁeld.
We have previously also mentioned Amp`ere’s law, where the magnetic ﬁeld H in general is not a
gradient ﬁeld.

Tangential line integrals
The physical examples above are just the simplest ones of the applications of the tangential line
integrals in Physics. We shall later introduce the more powerful Gauß’s and Stokes’s theorems and
see some applications of them.
32.4
Overview of the theorems and methods concerning tangential line
integrals and gradient ﬁelds
The current of a vector ﬁeld V along a curve K of parametric representation r(t) is deﬁned by:

K
V · t ds =

K
V · dx =
 β
α
V(r(t)) · r′(t) dt,
where we have identiﬁed
x = r(t)
and
dx = r′(t) ta.
It can in some cases be identiﬁed as an electric current along wire, represented by the curve.

Figure 32.2: Example of a plane curve K with initial point (0, 0).
There are here two important special cases:
1) The gradient integral theorem:

K
▽F(x) · dx = F(b) −F(a),
no matter how the curve K from a to b is chosen.
2) Circulation, i.e. K is a closed curve.
Whenever the word “circulation” occurs in an example, always think of Stokes’s theorem,

n · rot V dS,
and see if it applies, cf. Chapter 35.

Tangential line integrals
A trap: Even if the necessary conditions are all fulﬁlled, the ﬁeld V is not always a gradient ﬁeld,
although many readers believe it.
A suﬃcient condition (which is not necessary). The “cross derivatives” agree:
∂Vi
∂xj
= ∂Vj
∂xi
for all i, j = 1, . . . , k,
and
the domain A is star shaped.
Remark 32.1 Even when V is a gradient ﬁeld, the corresponding domain A does not have to be star
shaped. ♦
Concerning the calculations in practice we refer to Section 32.2:
1) Indeﬁnite integration,
2) Method of inspection,
3) Integration along a curve consisting of lines parallel with one of the axes,
4) Radial integration.
The radial integration cannot be recommended as a standard procedure.
In some cases a diﬀerential form can be simpliﬁed by removing a gradient ﬁeld:
V = ▽F + U,
or more conveniently,
V · dx = Vx dx + Vy dy + Vz dz = dF + Ux dx + Uy dy + Uz dz,
where U ought to be simpler than V.
If so, then

K
V · dx = F(b) −F(a) +

K
U · dx.
This method is e.g. used in Thermodynamics, where the vector ﬁeld usually is not a gradient ﬁeld.
In these reductions one can take advantage of the well-known rules of calculus for diﬀerentials:
α df + dg = d(α f + g),
α constant
f dg + g df = d(fg),
f dg −g df = f 2 d

Remark.
The vector ﬁeld V(x) is the same as that in Example 32.7.5 and in Exam-
ple 32.7.6. Furthermore, the curves of these two examples have the same initial point and
end point. Nevertheless the two tangential line integrals give diﬀerent results. We shall later
be interested in those vector ﬁelds V(x), for which the tangential line integral only depends
on the initial and end points of the curve K. (In Physics such vector ﬁelds correspond to the
so-called conservative forces.) We have here an example in which this ideal property is not
satisﬁed. ♦

Tangential line integrals
Example 32.10 Calculate in each of the following cases the tangential line integral of the given vector
ﬁeld V along the given curve K.
1) The vector ﬁeld is V(x, y) = (x + y, x −y), and the curve K is the ellipse of centrum (0, 0) and
half axes a, b, run through in the positive orientation of the plane.
2) The vector ﬁeld is V(x, y) =

1

|x| + |y|

, and the curve K is the square deﬁned by its
vertices
(1, 0),
(0, 1),
(−1, 0),
(0, −1),
in the positive orientation of the plane.
3) The vector ﬁeld is V(x, y) = (x2 −y, y2 + x), and the curve K is the line segment from (0, 1) to
(1, 2).
4) The vector ﬁeld is V(x, y) = (x2 −y2, y2 + x), and the curve K is the broken line from (0, 1) over
(1, 1) to (1, 2).
5) The vector ﬁeld is V(x, y) = (x2 −y, y2 + x), and the curve K is that part of the parabola of
equation y = 1 + x2, which has the initial point (0, 1) and the ﬁnal point (1, 2).
6) The vector ﬁeld is V(x, y, z) = (yz , xz , x(y + 1)), and the curve K is the triangle given by its
vertices
(0, 0, 0),
(1, 1, 1),
(−1, 1, −1),
and run through as deﬁned by the given sequence.
7) The vector ﬁeld is V(x, y, z) = (sin y, sin z, sin x), and the curve K is the line segment from (0, 0, 0)
to (π, π, π).
8) The vector ﬁeld is V(x, y, z) = (z , x , −y), and the curve K is the quarter circle from (a, 0, 0) to
(0, 0, a) followed by another quarter circle from (0, 0, a) to (0.a.0), both of centrum (0, 0, 0).
A Tangential line integrals in the 2-dimensional and the 3-dimensional space.
D Sketch in the 2-dimensional case the curve K. Then check if any part of V(x) · dx can be sorted
out as a total diﬀerential. Finally, insert the parametric description and calculate.
I 1) As K is a closed curve, we get

K
V(x) · dx =

K
{(x + y) dx + (x −y) dy} =

K
d
1
2 x2 + xy −1
2 y2

= 0,
because V · dx is a total diﬀerential.
Alternatively, K has e.g. the parametric description
(x, y) = r(t) = (a cos t, b sin t),
t ∈[0, 2π],
hence
r′(t) = (−a sin t, b cos t).

It follows that ▽Φ = V and that Φ can be extended to all of A.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

3) First note that
F(x, y, z) =
 exp x + ln(1 + yz)
for yz > 0,
exp x + ln(1 −yz)
for yz < 0,
so we must be very careful, whenever the curve K intersects one of the planes y = 0 or z = 0.
In case of the ﬁrst curves this can occur, because the parametric description is
t(0, 1, 1) + (1 −t)(π, −3, 2) = ((1 −t)π, 4t −3, 2 −t),
t ∈[0, 1],
and the same is true for the second curve, because it has the parametric description

3) = (1 + t(π −1),
√
3 −t(3 +

√
3)),
for t ∈[0, 1].
The former curve intersects the plane y = 0 for t = 3
4, and the latter curve intersects both the
plane y = 0 and the plane z = 0. The point is, however, that in everyone of these intersection
points the dubious term ln(1 + |xy|) = 0, so they are of no importance. Hence we can conclude

Flux and divergence of a vector field. Gauß’s theorem
33
Flux and divergence of a vector ﬁeld. Gauß’s theorem
33.1
Flux
Let V be a C0 vector ﬁeld in a domain in R3, and let F be a C1 surface in this domain. Then we can
deﬁne a continuous unit vector ﬁeld n of unit normal vectors to F.
The ﬂux of V through F with respect to this vector ﬁeld of normals (there are locally two possibilities
of the orientation of n) is deﬁned as the surface integral of V(x) · n(x) over F, also denoted

F
V · n dS,
or

F
V(x) · n(x) dS,
or

F
V · dS,
where we have put dS := n dS for the vectorial element of area.
Figure 33.1: Illustration of the ﬂux. We integrate the dot product V · n over the surface F.
The ﬂux describes the ﬂow of the vector ﬁeld V through the surface F in the direction of the normal
vector ﬁeld n. It is obvious that if we replace n by the opposite normal vector ﬁeld −n, then the ﬂux
changes its sign.
We mention a couple of examples from Physics. If e.g. V = J is the density of an electric current,
then 
F J · n dS is the electric current passing through F (measured in the direction of n). If instead
V = B is a magnetic ﬁeld, then

FB·n dS is the magnetic ﬂux through the surface F (also measured
in the direction of n).
Then we shall see how the ﬂux in practice is calculated, when we introduce coordinates. Let r : E →R3
be a (rectangular) C1 parametric description of the surface F in the parameters (u, v) ∈E ⊆R2. We
have previously shown that
N(u, v) := r′
u(u, v) × r′
v(u, v)
is a normal to F, provided that N(u, v) = 0. Hence, the unit normal ﬁeld n is for N = 0 given by
n :=
N
N,
and
dS = N du dv.

Flux and divergence of a vector field. Gauß’s theorem
It follows immediately that the vectorial area element is
n dS = N du dv.
We note that as usual that we may allow N(u, v) = 0 in the applications as long as this only takes
place in a null set, i.e. we only require that N(u, v) = 0 almost everywhere. Then we have (again, the
proof is omitted),
Theorem 33.1 Reduction of a ﬂux of a vector ﬁeld.
Let A ⊆R3 be an open domain, and let
V : A →R3 be a C0 vector ﬁeld. Finally let F ⊂A be a continuous and piecewise C1 surface of
the parametric description r : E →R3, where we assume that E is a closed and bounded domain in
the (u, v)-plane, that r is injective almost everywhere, and where the normal vector ﬁeld N(u, v) = 0
almost everywhere.
Then the ﬂux of V through F in the direction of the normal vector ﬁeld N can be calculated by the
following plane integral over E,

F
V · n dS =

E
V(r(u, v)) · N(u, v) du dv.
This is very important, so we include a couple of examples to exercise the method.
Example 33.1 We shall ﬁnd the ﬂux Φ of the vector ﬁeld
V(x, y, z) =

yz, −xz, x2 + y2
,
for (x, y, z) ∈R3,
through the surface F, given by the parametric description
r(u, v) = (u sin v, u cos v, uv),
for 0 ≤u ≤1 and 0 ≤v ≤u.

Flux and divergence of a vector field. Gauß’s theorem
It follows from the symmetry that this plane integral is 8 times the plane integral restricted to the
triangle T on Figure 33.4. Since the two variables (x, y) only occur in the integrand in the form of
x2 + y2, it is natural to change to polar coordinates, ̺2 = x2 + y2. This means that we should use
polar coordinates on the triangle T . This is given in polar coordinates by
T :
0 ≤ϕ ≤π

and
0 ≤̺ ≤

Then the ﬂux becomes, where we remember the weight function ̺,

Flux and divergence of a vector field. Gauß’s theorem
33.2
Divergence and Gauß’s theorem
We shall in this section consider a closed continuous and piecewise C1 surface F, which we also assume
to be the boundary of a bounded domain Ω⊂R3 in space. Furthermore, we assume that the unit
normal vector ﬁeld n on F is deﬁned almost everywhere. We shall for a bounded surface which is the
boundary of some domain Ω, i.e. F = ∂Ω, always assume that n is oriented away from Ω.
Let V be a C1 vector ﬁeld deﬁned on an open domain containing the closure Ω. Then the ﬂux of V
through F = ∂Ω, i.e.
Φ :=

F
V · n dS,
is interpreted as the ﬂow of something, which ﬂows out of Ωthrough the boundary surface F = ∂Ω.
Clearly, this is of interest in Physics, so we shall here analyze this situation more closely in order to
obtain an alternative way of calculating the ﬂux. It is obvious that we in some sense must take into
account what is created inside Ω, so we can expect that the result is a space integral of some integrand
derived by a mathematical process from V.
We shall start the analysis with a very simple case, where we assume that Ωis an axiparallel paral-
lelepipedum. Using if necessary a translation we may assume that Ωis described by
ω = [0, a] × [0, b] × [0, c],
for some a, b, c > 0.
Figure 33.5: The ﬂux of V through the two parallel surfaces of height z = 0 and z = c of the
parallelepipedum ω. Note that the ﬁeld n is pointing in opposite directions on the two surfaces.
We shall ﬁrst consider the ﬂux through the surfaces of ω of height z = 0 and z = c. We clearly have
n = (0, 0, −1) on the surface, for which z = 0, and n = (0, 0, 1) on the plane surface, for which z = c,

This result is valid for every axiparallel parallelepipedum.
Figure 33.6: The ﬂux of V through the surface of the union of two axiparallel parallelepipeda. The
contribution to the total ﬂux is cancelled on the common surface, because the only change in the
integrand is the unit normal, which changes its sign.
When we calculate the total ﬂux of two adjacent axiparallel parallelepipeda, we see that on a common
surface the total contribution to the ﬂux is zero, because the only change in the integrand is the sign
of the unit normal vector ﬁeld, which is + on the surface of ω1 and - on the surface of ω2.
By iterating this result we see in general, that if Ωis a union of ﬁnitely many axiparallel parallelepipeda,
then the total contribution from every “inner surface” must be zero, i.e. when there are two smaller
parallelepipeda ωi and ωj with a common surface. These “inner surfaces” also disappear in ∂Ω, so we
can replace k
j=1 ∂ωj with ∂k
j=1 ωj = ∂Ω.

The argument above makes it plausible that when we approximate Ωfrom the inside with ﬁnite unions
n
j=1 ωj of such parallelepipeda, and let n →+∞, then we may expect that the ﬂux of V through a
general ∂Ωis given by

dΩ,
and although the above is far from a correct proof, this is true under the assumptions we shall state
below in Theorem 33.2. However, since the integrand on the right hand side keeps occurring in many
cases, we ﬁrst shorten the notation by giving it a name, which in the general Rn is coined by the
following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 33.1 Let V = (V1, . . . , Vn) be a C1 vector ﬁeld in an open domain Ω⊆Rn. We deﬁne
the divergence of V by
div V := ∂V1
∂x1
+ · · · + ∂Vn
∂xn
.
It is not possible here to give the proof of the following important theorem, because the closed surface
F = ∂Ωmay not be nice, and even if it is, the approximation of Ωfrom the inside by Ωk = k
j=1 ωj
as described above in general gives a boundary ∂Ωk which is diﬃcult to handle in comparison with
the surface integral over Ω. We therefore just quote the following very important theorem.

Flux and divergence of a vector field. Gauß’s theorem
Theorem 33.2 Gauß’s theorem in R3. Given a C1 vector ﬁeld V on a domain A ⊆R3. Let Ω⊆A
be closed and bounded, where we assume that the boundary ∂Ωis the union of closed continuous and
piecewise C1 surfaces, each with a unit normal vector ﬁeld pointing away from Ωalmost everywhere.
Then the ﬂux of V through ∂Ωout of Ωis given by
Φ :=

∂Ω
V · n dS =

Ω
div V dΩ.
Consider again the axiparallel parallelepipedum ω, which was used to make this theorem plausible.
Then clearly the normal ﬁeld does not exist on the edges, but these edges are just nullsets. This is
what we mean by the formulation of the theorem above.
It is important to note that the formula

∂Ω
V · n dS =

Ω
div V dΩ
can be read and applied in both directions. At ﬁrst it may seem strange that we reformulate a two
dimensional surface integral to the left as a three dimensional space integral on the right hand side of
the equation. However, the examples later on will show that the calculations often become easier in
the space integral than in the surface integral.
The other situation may of course also occur. We shall give some examples in Section 33.5.
Note also, that the geometrical analysis is important. One should e.g. always check that the unit
vector ﬁeld n is pointing away from Ω.
Theorem 33.2 is formulated for sets and vector ﬁelds in R3. There exists a similar result in R2, which
is given in the next theorem.
Theorem 33.3 Gauß’s theorem in R2.
Consider a plane C1 vector ﬁeld V on a plane domain
A ⊆R2. Let E ⊂A be a closed and bounded plane domain, where the boundary ∂E is the union of
closed continuous and piecewise C1 curves, each with a unit normal vector ﬁeld pointing away from
E almost everywhere. Then the ﬂux of V through E is given by
Φ :=

∂E
(Vxnx + Vyny) ds =

E
∂Vx
∂x + ∂Vy
∂y

dS,
where V = (Vx.Vy) and n = (nx, ny) in rectangular coordinates.
If div V = 0, then we say that the vector ﬁeld V is divergence free. Divergence free vector ﬁelds are
important in the applications in e.g. Physics, though not all relevant vector ﬁelds are divergence free.
Example 33.3 Area and volume formulæ. Let us ﬁrst consider R2. If we consider thee vector ﬁeld
V(x, y) = (x, y), then the divergence is given by
div V = ∂x
∂x + ∂y
∂y = 2.

Flux and divergence of a vector field. Gauß’s theorem
In R3 the vector ﬁeld V(x, y, z) = (x, y, z) has the divergence
div V = ∂x
∂x + ∂y
∂y + ∂z
∂z = 3,
so it follows from Gauß’s theorem in three dimensions that we have the following volume formula,

Ω
div V dΩ= vol(Ω).
♦
Example 33.4 If a is a constant vector ﬁeld, then trivially div a = 0, so the ﬂux through any closed
boundary surface F = ∂Ωis zero, because we get from Gauß’s theorem that
Φ :=

∂Ω
a · n dS =

Ω
div a dΩ= 0.
♦
Example 33.5 Let a, b, c be positive constants. We shall ﬁnd the ﬂux of Φ of the vector ﬁeld
V(x, y, z) = (y, x, z + c)
for (x, y, z) ∈R3,
through the surface of the upper half of the massive ellipsoid, given by
x2

and
z ≥0.
It follows immediately that

theory is indeed important in Physics.

Flux and divergence of a vector field. Gauß’s theorem
Since div B is continuous (in fact, B ∈C1), this implies that
div B = 0,
which is the diﬀerential formulation of the same of Maxwell’s equations as above.
In fact, if div B (x0) > 0, then due to the continuity also div B(x) > 0, whenever x −x0 < δ for
δ > 0 suﬃciently small. This would imply that

Ωδ div B dΩ> 0, where Ωδ = {x | x −x0 < δ},
which is a contradiction, so we conclude that div B = 0.
Figure 33.7: For divergence free vector ﬁelds the ﬂux inwards through F1 is equal to the ﬂux outwards
through F2.
Then let V be a divergence free C1 vector ﬁeld. Consider a domain Ω, such that the surface boundary
∂Ωis cut into two subsurfaces F1 and F2 as indicated on Figure 33.7 by a closed curve K.
Let Φ1 the the ﬂux into Ωthrough F1, and Φ2 the ﬂux out of Ωthrough F2. It follows fromGauß’s
theorem that the ﬂux out of Ωthrough the whole of ∂Ω= F1 ∪F2 is given by
Φ = Φ2 −Φ1 =

F2
V · n dS +

F1
V · (−n) dS =

Ω
div V dΩ= 0.
In other words, the ﬂux of a divergence free vector ﬁeld through a surface of ﬁxed boundary curve K
only depends on this closed curve K and not of the shape of the surface, which has K as boundary
curve.
We have already derived that the density of the magnetic ﬂux is divergence free. Therefore, according
to the result above we can now talk of the magnetic ﬂux being surrounded by a closed curve.
33.3.2
Coulomb vector ﬁeld
Then we return to the Coulomb vector ﬁeld, already considered in Example 33.2. We shall for conve-
nience choose k = 1, so the Coulomb ﬁeld is here
V(x, y, z) =
(x, y, z)
(x2 + y2 + z2)3/2 ,
for (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0).

a > 0,
where a > 0 is chosen so small that Ba ⊂Ω◦. When we apply Gauß’s theorem on the set Ω\ Ba,

We note that −n on ∂Ba is the unit normal vector ﬁeld pointing away from the solid set Ω\Ba. Also,
x2 + y2 + z2 = a2 on ∂Ba, so the Coulomb ﬁeld is on ∂Ba given by

Consider a ﬂuid or gas of density ̺ and velocity ﬁeld v. Then the mass in a domain Ωis given by

and the ﬂow of mass through the surface ∂Ωaway from Ωis given by the ﬂux

∂t is continuous, and we
have previously seen that if f is a continuous function satisfying

Ω
f dΩ= 0
for all subsets of Ω,
then f ≡0. We have therefore proved the continuity equation
div(̺ v) + ∂̺
∂t = 0.
This equation can also be found in other physical disciplines – the mathematical proof above is the
same and only the physical interpretations are diﬀerent. If for instance u denotes the energy density,
and q the density of the energy ﬂow, then the conservation of the energy is expressed by the similar
equation
div q + ∂u
∂t = 0.
Similarly, if J denotes the density of a current and ̺ the density of the charge, then the law of
conservation of the electric charge is written
div J + ∂̺
∂t = 0.
All these results stem from an application of Gauß’s theorem.

Procedures for ﬂux and divergence of a vector ﬁeld; Gauß’s theorem
33.4.1
Procedure for calculation of a ﬂux
The ﬂux Φ of a vector ﬁeld V through a surface F is given by a surface integral (cf. Chapter 27) in
the following way:
If x = r(u, v), (u, v) ∈E is a parametric representation of the surface F with a given continuous unit
normal vector ﬁeld n, then the ﬂux is given by
ΦF(V) =

F
V · n dS =

F
V(x) · n(x) dS =

E
V(r(u, v)) · N(u, v) du dv.
It is the amount of the vector ﬁeld which “ﬂows through the surface in the direction of the normal
vector” (e.g. per time unit).
Typically there are two diﬀerent ways in which the ﬂux can be calculated.
Standard procedure.
In principle this can always be applied, but it is often very cumbersome.
1) Divide if necessary F into convenient sub-surfaces F1, . . . , Fk each having its own unit normal
vector ﬁeld n1, . . . , nk.
2) Check, whether F (or Fj) is “ﬂat”, and if it is not too diﬃcult to calculate

F V · n dS as an
ordinary plane integral, because F is lying in a plane set.
3) If F is not ﬂat, we calculate the normal vector corresponding to the speciﬁc parametric represen-
tation in the variables (u, v),
N(u, v) =

.
Note that N(u, v) no longer is a unit normal vector ﬁeld. Stated roughly, we build the weight
function into the new normal vector ﬁeld N(u, v).
4) Calculate the plane integral over the parametric domain E,
ΦF(V) =

E
V(r(u, v)) · N(u, v) du dv.
33.4.2
Application of Gauß’s theorem
The method can in principle always be applied when the surface is “closed”, i.e. one adds a surface
with two numerically equal normal vector ﬁelds, which are pointing in the opposite directions, n and
−n, such that one surrounds a 3-dimensional domain Ωwith outgoing normal, and an additional
surface integral, which hopefully should be easy to calculate.

Figure 33.9: The surface of the unit half sphere is closed by adding the unit disc in the (x, y)-plane
with a normal vector pointing downwards (this gives us the closed upper unit half sphere with normal
vectors pointing outwards) and the unit disc in the (x, y)-plane with the normal vector pointing
upwards.
1) Check that F = ∂Ωis closed, i.e. this surface surrounds a 3-dimensional body Ω.
2) Quote Gauß’s theorem and reduce the surface integral to a space integral,
3) Calculate the space integral

Ωdiv V dΩby applying one of the methods from Chapter 24.
Remark 33.1 Usually one would not call it a reduction to go from 2 dimensions to 3 dimensions; but
note that the surface F of dimension 2 may have a fairly complicated geometry, while we in principle
always end up with rectangular coordinates i 3 dimensions, which here may be considered as a simpler
situation. ♦

Figure 33.10: The surface F and its projection onto the (x, y)-plane.

where the abstract surface integral is rewritten as an abstract plane integral. By inspecting the
right hand side it is seen that we shall
1) identify the parametric domain E,
2) ﬁnd the normal vector N(u, v) for the surface F, corresponding to the parameters (u, v),
3) express V(r(u, v)) on the surface F as a function in the parameters (u, v).
I. 1) The parametric domain is the disc of centre (0, 0) and radius 2,
E = {(u, v) | u2 + v2 ≤4 = 22}.
2) The normal vector. It follows from the parametric representation of the surface that

The restriction of V to E is obtained by putting z = 0, i.e.
V(x, y, 0) = (y, x, c).
The unit normal vector is n = (0, 0, 1), so the integrand becomes
V(x, y, 0) · n = (y, x, c) · (0, 0, 1) = c.
We conclude by using the reduction theorem on the simple calculation

Summarizing, Φ3 in I 1. was diﬃcult to compute, while Φ4 in I 2. and Φ in I 3. were easy. Since
Φ3 −Φ4 = Φ, we might have calculated Φ3 by computing the easy right hand side of

Flux and divergence of a vector field. Gauß’s theorem
This technique can often be applied when one shall calculate the ﬂux through a more or less compli-
cated surface F1.
1) First draw a ﬁgure, thereby realizing where F1 is placed in the space.
2) Then add a nice surface F2, such that F1 ∪F2 becomes the boundary of a spatial body Ω. Check
in particular that the normal vector on F2 is always pointing away from the domain Ω).
3) Calculate the right hand side of (33.1), thereby ﬁnding the ﬂux through F1.
Remark 33.2 We shall later in Example 33.9 give some comments which will give us an even more
easy version of calculation. ♦
Example 33.8
A. Let the surface F be the square
F = {(x, y, z) | |x| ≤a, |y| ≤a, z = a},
a > 0,
at the height a with the unit normal vector n = (0, 0, 1) pointing upwards.
Find the ﬂux through F of the Coulomb ﬁeld
V(x, y, z) =
(x, y, z)
(x2 + y2 + z2)3/2 ,
(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0).

Flux and divergence of a vector field. Gauß’s theorem
where we have used that the integrand is even in both x and y, and that the domain is symmetric.
So far, so good, but from now on the calculations become really tough. The reason is that the
integrand invites to the application of polar coordinates, while the domain is better described
in rectangular coordinates. The mixture of these two coordinate systems will always cause some
diﬃculties.
For pedagogical reasons we shall here show both variants, ﬁrst the rectangular version, which is
extremely diﬃcult, and afterwards the polar version, which is “only” diﬃcult. This exercise will
show that one cannot just restrict oneself to rely on the rectangular method alone!

So far we can still use the pocket calculator TI-89, but from now on it denies to calculate the exact

methods from the time before the pocket calculators.

The following circumscription is governed by the following general principle:
• Whenever the square of two terms is involved then it should be rewritten as 1 plus/minus
something which has “something to do” with the other terms in the integrand.

Remark 33.3 It is obvious why this variant is never seen in ordinary textbooks. The morale is
that even if something can be done, it does not always have to, and we should of course have
avoided this variant. It should, however, be added that the pocket calculator ﬁnally will ﬁnd that

(x2 + y2 + z2)3/2 −3

x2 + y2 + z2
(x2 + y2 + z2)5/2 = 0,
i.e. V is divergence free so we can use the results of Section 33.3.2 for domains Ω, which do not contain
the point (0, 0, 0).
A. Let Ωbe any spatial domain with (0, 0, 0) as an inner point. Find the ﬂux of the Coulomb ﬁeld
through ∂Ω, i.e. ﬁnd 
∂ΩV · n dS.
D. Since div V is not deﬁned in (0, 0, 0), we cannot apply Gauß’s theorem directly. But since (0, 0, 0)
is an inner point, there exists a ball
K = K(0; r) ⊂Ω,
totally contained in Ω. If we cut K out of Ω, we get a domain ˜Ω= Ω\ K, in which div V is
deﬁned everywhere and equal to 0. According to Section 33.3.2 the surface ∂Ωcan be deformed
into ∂K, and then the ﬂux through ∂K can be calculated as an ordinary surface integral. (The
singular point (0, 0, 0) lies in K, so we cannot apply Gauß’s theorem in the latter calculation).
I. We are just missing one thing. Since both ∂Ωand ∂K are closed surfaces, neither of them has a
boundary curve, so we get formally
δ(∂Ω) = ∅= δ(∂K).
Alternatively there is ﬂowing just as much into ˜Ωthrough ∂K as out of ˜Ωthrough ∂Ω, because
the ﬂow is balanced.
Thus we have proved by using Gauß’s theorem that

∂Ω
V · n dS =

∂K
V · n dS.
The right hand side is calculated as a usual surface integral, where it this time is worthwhile to
keep the abstract formulation as long as possible.

Flux and divergence of a vector field. Gauß’s theorem
1) On ∂K we have r2 = x2 + y2 + z2, i.e. r =

x2 + y2 + z21/2, and
n(x, y, z) = 1
r (x, y, z).
2) The vector ﬁeld is then rewritten in the following way
V(x, y, z) =
(x, y, z)
(x2 + y2 + z2)3/2 = 1
r3 (x, y, z) = 1
r2 · 1
r (x, y, z) = 1
r2 n,
where we have used 1).
3) Since n · n = n2 = 1, we get by an insertion of 2) that the ﬂux is given by

∂Ω
V · n dS
=

∂K
V · n dS =

∂K

r2 n · n dS
=

r2

∂K
dS = 1
r2 area(∂K) = 1
r2 · 4πr2 = 4π,
because the area of a sphere of radius r is given by 4πr2.
The result can be applied in an improved version of the horrible Example 33.8. Let Ω= K(0; r),
where r >
√
3 a, and let T be the cube of centre 0 and edge length 2a. Then the ﬂux through ∂T
is equal to the ﬂux through the sphere ∂Ω, i.e. according to the above,

∂T
V · n dS =

∂Ω
V · n dS = 4π.
On the other hand, ∂T is disintegrated in a natural way into six squares of the same congruent form:
They appear from each other by a convenient revolution around one of the axis. The Coulomb
ﬁeld is due to its symmetry invariant (apart from a change of letters) by these revolutions, so the
ﬂux is the same through every one of the six squares. If we choose one of these. e.g.
F = {(x, y, z) | −a ≤x ≤a, −a ≤y ≤a, z = a} = [−a, a] × [−a, a] × {a},
then
4π =

∂T
V · n dS = 6

∩F
V · n dS,
from which

F
V · n dS = 1
6 · 4π = 2π
3 .
Obviously this method is far easier in its calculations than the method applied in Example 33.8.

Flux and divergence of a vector field. Gauß’s theorem
This change must be equal to the ﬂow of mass into Ωby the vector ﬁeld
̺ v = ̺(x, y, z, t) v(x, y, z, t).
Since −n points into Ω, this amount is according to Gauß’s theorem equal to
−q = −

∂Ω
̺ v · n dS = −

Ω
div(̺ v) dΩ.
When this expression is equated to (33.3), we get after a rearrangement that
0 = q + dM
dt =

Ω
div(̺ v) dΩ+

Ω
∂̺
∂t dΩ=

Ω

div(̺ v) + ∂̺
∂t

dΩ.
This is true for every domain Ω. Assuming that the integrand is continuous (what it always is in
practical applications), it must be 0 everywhere. In fact, if the integrand e.g was positive in a point,
then it had due to the continuity also to be positive in an open domain Ω1, and then the integral over
Ω1 becomes positive too, contradicting the assumption.
Thus we have once more derived the continuity equation
div(̺ v) + ∂̺
∂t = 0,
which the density and the velocity vector ﬁeld of the pollution vector ﬁeld must satisfy.
Remark 33.5 Here the divergence is referring to the spatial variables and not to the time variable
t. Hence, the continuity equation is written in all details in the following way
∂
∂x (̺ vx) + ∂
∂y (̺ vy) + ∂
∂z (̺ vz) + ∂̺
∂t = 0.
Furthermore it should be noted that there is a big diﬀerence here between the application of d
dt and
∂
∂t. ♦

as the parameter domain. Then the ﬂux through F is

6) In this case F is a cylindric surface which is given in semi polar coordinates by the parametric
description
{(a, ϕ, z) | ϕ ∈[0, 2π], z ∈[−h, h]},
and the parameter domain becomes
E = {(ϕ, z) | ϕ ∈[0, 2π], z ∈[−h, h]} = [0, 2π] × [−h, h].
The unit normal vector pointing away from the Z-axis is

Remark. The ﬁeld of Example 33.11.5 and Example 33.11.6 is the so-called Coulomb
ﬁeld, cf. Section 33.3.2. It is tempting to combine the results of Example 33.11.5 and
Example 33.11.6 to ﬁnd the ﬂux of the Coulomb ﬁeld through the surface of the whole
cylinder. Since n = −ez, when we consider the surface of Example 33.11.5 at height −h, it

Flux and divergence of a vector field. Gauß’s theorem
4) It follows from the equations of the meridian cut that when z > 0 we have the quarter of
a circle, and when z < 0 we get an arc of a parabola. It is natural to split the cut of Ω0
correspondingly in Ω1 (for z > 0) and Ω2 (for z < 0).
Since
div V = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5,
we get by Gauß’s theorem that the ﬂux is

A Flux through the surface of a body.
D Think of how to treat the singularity at (0, 0, 0) before we can apply Gauß’s theorem. Find the

One could therefore be misled to “conclude” that the ﬂux is 0, “because (0, 0, 0) is a null set”; but
this is not true.

(x, y, z) ∈R3,
through the oriented half sphere F given by
x2 + y2 + z2 −2az = 0,
z ≤a,
n · ez ≥0.
It turns up that the integration over F is rather diﬃcult, while on the other hand the expression of
div V is fairly simple. One will therefore try to arrange the calculations such that it becomes possible
to apply Gauß’s theorem.
1) Construct a closed surface by adding an oriented dist F1 to F. Sketch the meridian half plane.
2) Find the ﬂux Φ1 of the vector ﬁeld V through F1.
3) Apply Gauß’s theorem on the body Ωof the boundary ∂Ω= F ∪F1, and then ﬁnd Φ.
A Computation of the ﬂux of a vector ﬁeld through a surface where a direct calculation becomes very
diﬃcult.
D Apply the guidelines, i.e. add a surface F1, such that F ∪F1 surrounds a body, on which Gauß’s
theorem can be applied. Hence, something is added and then subtracted again, and then one uses
Gauß’s theorem.

I 1) When we add a2 to both sides of the equation of the half sphere, we obtain
a2 = x2 + y2 + z2 −2az + a2 = ̺2 + (z −a)2.
It follows from the condition n · ez ≥0 that the curve in the meridian half plane of F is the
quarter of a circle of centrum (0, a) and radius a,
̺2 + (z −a)2 = a2,
z ≤a,
̺ ≥0.
Note that the normal vector has an upwards pointing component.
The disc (“the lid”), which shall be added is of course the disc in the plane z = a of centrum
(0, 0, a) and radius a.

Flux and divergence of a vector field. Gauß’s theorem
It only remains to prove that the meridian cut of ∂T2 has the equation
r = 2a cos θ.
Draw a radius and the perpendicular line on this as shown by the dotted lines on the ﬁgure.
Together with the line segment [0, 2a] on the Y -axis these form a rectangular triangle. The
angle between the Z-axis and the dotted radius is θ, and the hypothenuse (the line segment on
the Z-axis) is 2a. Hence, the closest of the smaller sides (i.e. placed up to ∂T2) must have the
length 2a cos θ. This proves that the equation of ∂T2 is
r = 2a cos θ.
It then follows that r ∈[2a cos θ, 3a] in T .

and we note that V is rotation free.
2) Since the ﬁeld is rotation free and the domain is simply connected, we conclude that V is a
gradient ﬁeld. Then by calculating the diﬀerential form,
V · ( dx, dy, dz)

and it follows once more that V is a gradient ﬁeld with all its integrals given by

3) We have proved that V is a gradient ﬁeld with an integral F. Then it follows that

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Flux and divergence of a vector field. Gauß’s theorem
Example 33.23 Given the vector ﬁeld
V(x, y, z) = (3xz2 −x3, 3yz2 −y3, 3z(x2 + y2)),
(x, y, z) ∈R3,
and the constant a ∈R+.
1. Show that V is a gradient ﬁeld and ﬁnd all its integrals.
Let K be the curve which is composed of the quarter circle of centrum at (0, 0, 0) and runs from (a, 0, 0)
to (0, a, 0), and the line segment from (0, a, 0) to (0, a, 2a).
2. Find the tangential line integral

K
V · t ds.
3. Find the ﬂux of V through the surface of the ball of centrum (0, 0, 0) and radius a.
A Vector analysis.
D Each question can be answered in several ways. We shall here demonstrate some of the variants.
I 1) First note that V is of class C∞.
First variant. Prove directly by some manipulation that the diﬀerential form V · dx can be
written as dF where F then by the deﬁnition is an integral. Do this by pairing terms which
are similar to each other.
V · dx
=
(3xz2 −x3) dx + (3yz2 −y3) dy + 3z(x2 + y2) dz
=
3
2 z2 d(x2) −1
4 d(x4) + 3
2 z2 d(y2) −1
4 d(y4) + 3
2(x2 + y2) d(z2)
=
d
3
2 (x2 + y2)z2 −1
4 x4 −1
4 y4

.
It follows immediately from this result that V is a gradient ﬁeld and that all integrals are
given by
F(x, y, z) = 3
2 (x2 + y2)z2 −1
4 x4 −1
4 y4 + C,
where C is an arbitrary constant.
Second variant. Clearly, R3 is simply connected. Furthermore,
∂L
∂y = 0,
∂M
∂x = 0,
hence ∂L
∂y = ∂M
∂x ,
∂L
∂z = 6xz,
ddN
∂x = 6xz,
hence ∂L
∂z = ∂N
∂x ,
∂M
∂z = 6yz,
∂N
∂y = 6yz,
hence∂M
∂z = ∂N
∂y .
Since all the “mixed derivatives” are equal, it follows that V · dx is closed and hence exact.
This means that V is a gradient ﬁeld and the integrals of V exist.
In this variant we shall ﬁnd the integrals by using line integrals. There are two sub-varants:

The integrals are
F(x, y, z) = 3
2 (x2 + y2)z2 −1
4 (x4 + y4) + C,
where C is an arbitrary constant.
Third variant. Start by one of the variants 2a) and 2b) above without proving in advance
that V is a gradient ﬁeld. The possible candidates of the integrals are
F(x, y, z) = 3
2 (x2 + y2)z2 −1
4 (x4 + y4) + C.
Check these!:
▽F(x, y, z) = (3xz2 −x3, 3yz2 −y3, 3z(x2 + y2)) = V(x, y, z).
This shows that V is a gradient ﬁeld and its integrals are given by
F(x, y, z) = 3
2 (x2 + y2)z2 −1
4 (x4 + y4) + C,
where C is an arbitrary constant.
Fourth variant. Improper integration.
First put
ω = V · dx = (3xz2 −x3) dx + (3yz2 −y3) dy + 3z(x2 + y2) dz.

The diﬀerential is

hence
ω −dF1 = (3yz2 −y3) dy + 3zy2 dz,
which neither contains x nor dx.
When we repeat this procedure on ω −dF1 we get

with the diﬀerential

K(0;a)
6z2 dΩ,
because
div V = 3z2 −3x2 + 3z2 −3y2 + 3(x2 + y2) = 6z2.
The calculation of this integral is most probably performed in one of the following sub-
variants, although there exist some other (and more diﬃcult) ways of calculation.
a) Partition of K(0; a) into slices parallel to the XY -plane.

Flux and divergence of a vector field. Gauß’s theorem
Example 33.25 Consider the function
F(x, y, z) = x4 + x ey sin z,
(x, y, z) ∈R3,
and the vector ﬁeld V = ▽F.
1) Find the divergence ▽· V and the rotation ▽× V.
2) Check if V has a vector potential.
3) Find the ﬂux of V through ∂A, where A is the half ball given by the inequalities
x2 + y2 + z2 ≤9,
z ≤0.
4) Find the ﬂux of V through the surface F given by
x2 + y2 + z2 = 9,
z ≤0.
Show the orientation of F on a ﬁgure. (Hint: Use that the surface F is a subset of the surface ∂A
of 3).
A Divergence, rotation, ﬂux.
D Find V. Use the rules of calculations and ﬁnally also Gauß’s theorem.
I 1) First calculate
V = ▽F =

4x3 + ey sin z, xey sin z, xey cos z

.
Then
▽· V = ▽· ▽F = ∆F = 12x2 + xey sin z −xey sin z = 12x2
and
▽× V = ▽× ▽F = 0,
which is obvious because V is a gradient ﬁeld and thence rotation free.
2) Since V is not divergence free in any open domain, V does not have a vector potential.
3) We get by Gauß’s theorem, an argument of symmetry and using spherical coordinates,

Flux and divergence of a vector field. Gauß’s theorem
I We see that Ωis (half of) a cone (of revolution) with the top point (0, 0, h) and a half disc in the

1) The divergence is
div U = ▽· U = (3x2z −2y sin x) + (3y2z + 2y sin x) + 0 = 3z(x2 + y2).

Formulæ
Some of the following formulæ can be assumed to be known from high school. It is highly recommended
that one learns most of these formulæ in this appendix by heart.
34.1
Squares etc.
The following simple formulæ occur very frequently in the most diﬀerent situations.
(a + b)2 = a2 + b2 + 2ab,
a2 + b2 + 2ab = (a + b)2,
(a −b)2 = a2 + b2 −2ab,
a2 + b2 −2ab = (a −b)2,
(a + b)(a −b) = a2 −b2,
a2 −b2 = (a + b)(a −b),
(a + b)2 = (a −b)2 + 4ab,
(a −b)2 = (a + b)2 −4ab.
34.2
Powers etc.

Exponential, ﬁxed base:

(ax)y = axy, a > 0
(extensions for some x, y),

ax , a > 0,
(extensions for some x),
n√a = a1/n, a ≥0,
n ∈N.
Square root:

Remark 34.1 It happens quite frequently that students make errors when they try to apply these
rules. They must be mastered! In particular, as one of my friends once put it: “If you can master the
square root, you can master everything in mathematics!” Notice that this innocent looking square
root is one of the most diﬃcult operations in Calculus. Do not forget the absolute value! ♦

Diﬀerentiation
Here are given the well-known rules of diﬀerentiation together with some rearrangements which some-
times may be easier to use:
{f(x) ± g(x)}′ = f ′(x) ± g′(x),
{f(x)g(x)}′ = f ′(x)g(x) + f(x)g′(x) = f(x)g(x)
f ′(x)
f(x) + g′(x)
g(x)

,
where the latter rearrangement presupposes that f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0.
If g(x) = 0, we get the usual formula known from high school
f(x)
g(x)
′
= f ′(x)g(x) −f(x)g′(x)
g(x)2
.
It is often more convenient to compute this expression in the following way:
f(x)
g(x)

= d
dx

f(x) ·
1
g(x)

= f ′(x)
g(x) −f(x)g′(x)
g(x)2
= f(x)
g(x)
f ′(x)
f(x) −g′(x)
g(x)

,
where the former expression often is much easier to use in practice than the usual formula from high
school, and where the latter expression again presupposes that f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0. Under these
assumptions we see that the formulæ above can be written
{f(x)g(x)}′
f(x)g(x)
= f ′(x)
f(x) + g′(x)
g(x) ,
{f(x)/g(x)}′
f(x)/g(x)
= f ′(x)
f(x) −g′(x)
g(x) .
Since
d
dx ln |f(x)| = f ′(x)
f(x) ,
f(x) = 0,
we also name these the logarithmic derivatives.
Finally, we mention the rule of diﬀerentiation of a composite function
{f(ϕ(x))}′ = f ′(ϕ(x)) · ϕ′(x).
We ﬁrst diﬀerentiate the function itself; then the insides. This rule is a 1-dimensional version of the
so-called Chain rule.

Integration
The most obvious rules are dealing with linearity

{f(x) + λg(x)} dx =

f(x) dx + λ

g(x) dx,
where λ ∈R is a constant,
and with the fact that diﬀerentiation and integration are “inverses to each other”, i.e. modulo some
arbitrary constant c ∈R, which often tacitly is missing,

f ′(x) dx = f(x).
If we in the latter formula replace f(x) by the product f(x)g(x), we get by reading from the right to
the left and then diﬀerentiating the product,
f(x)g(x) =

{f(x)g(x)}′ dx =

f ′(x)g(x) dx +

f(x)g′(x) dx.
Hence, by a rearrangement
The rule of partial integration:

f ′(x)g(x) dx = f(x)g(x) −

f(x)g′(x) dx.
The diﬀerentiation is moved from one factor of the integrand to the other one by changing the sign
and adding the term f(x)g(x).
Remark 34.3 This technique was earlier used a lot, but is almost forgotten these days. It must
be revived, because MAPLE and pocket calculators apparently do not know it.
It is possible to
construct examples where these devices cannot give the exact solution, unless you ﬁrst perform a
partial integration yourself. ♦
Remark 34.4 This method can also be used when we estimate integrals which cannot be directly
calculated, because the antiderivative is not contained in e.g. the catalogue of MAPLE. The idea is
by a succession of partial integrations to make the new integrand smaller. ♦
Integration by substitution:
If the integrand has the special structure f(ϕ(x))·ϕ′(x), then one can change the variable to y = ϕ(x):

f(ϕ(x)) · ϕ′(x) dx = “

f(ϕ(x)) dϕ(x)′′ =

y=ϕ(x)
f(y) dy.

Integration by a monotonous substitution:
If ϕ(y) is a monotonous function, which maps the y-interval one-to-one onto the x-interval, then

f(x) dx =

y=ϕ−1(x)
f(ϕ(y))ϕ′(y) dy.
Remark 34.5 This rule is usually used when we have some “ugly” term in the integrand f(x). The
idea is to put this ugly term equal to y = ϕ−1(x). When e.g. x occurs in f(x) in the form √x, we put
y = ϕ−1(x) = √x, hence x = ϕ(y) = y2 and ϕ′(y) = 2y. ♦

missing. It is obvious that

x2 −1 < |x| so if x < −1, then x +

x2 −1 < 0. Since you cannot take

Trigonometric formulæ
The trigonometric formulæ are closely connected with circular movements. Thus (cos u, sin u) are
the coordinates of a point P on the unit circle corresponding to the angle u, cf. ﬁgure A.1. This
geometrical interpretation is used from time to time.

Figure 34.1: The unit circle and the trigonometric functions.
The fundamental trigonometric relation:
cos2 u + sin2 u = 1,
for u ∈R.
Using the previous geometric interpretation this means according to Pythagoras’s theorem, that the
point P with the coordinates (cos u, sin u) always has distance 1 from the origo (0, 0), i.e. it is lying
on the boundary of the circle of centre (0, 0) and radius
√
1 = 1.
Connection to the complex exponential function:
The complex exponential is for imaginary arguments deﬁned by
exp(i u) := cos u + i sin u.
It can be checked that the usual functional equation for exp is still valid for complex arguments. In
other word: The deﬁnition above is extremely conveniently chosen.
By using the deﬁnition for exp(i u) and exp(−i u) it is easily seen that
cos u = 1
2(exp(i u) + exp(−i u)),
sin u = 1
2i(exp(i u) −exp(−i u)),

Formulæ
Moivre’s formula: We get by expressing exp(inu) in two diﬀerent ways:
exp(inu) = cos nu + i sin nu = (cos u + i sin u)n.
Example 34.1 If we e.g. put n = 3 into Moivre’s formula, we obtain the following typical application,
cos(3u) + i sin(3u) = (cos u + i sin u)3
= cos3 u + 3i cos2 u · sin u + 3i2 cosu · sin2 u + i3 sin3 u
= {cos3 u −3 cosu · sin2 u} + i{3 cos2 u · sin u −sin3 u}
= {4 cos3 u −3 cosu} + i{3 sinu −4 sin3 u}
When this is split into the real- and imaginary parts we obtain
cos 3u = 4 cos3 u −3 cosu,
sin 3u = 3 sin u −4 sin3 u.
♦
Addition formulæ:
sin(u + v) = sin u cos v + cos u sin v,
sin(u −v) = sin u cos v −cos u sin v,
cos(u + v) = cos u cos v −sin u sin v,
cos(u −v) = cos u cos v + sin u sin v.

Hyperbolic formulæ
These are very much like the trigonometric formulæ, and if one knows a little of Complex Function
Theory it is realized that they are actually identical. The structure of this section is therefore the same
as for the trigonometric formulæ. The reader should compare the two sections concerning similarities
and diﬀerences.
The fundamental relation:
cosh2 x −sinh2 x = 1.
Deﬁnitions:
cosh x = 1
2 (exp(x) + exp(−x)) ,
sinh x = 1
2 (exp(x) −exp(−x)) .
“Moivre’s formula”:
exp(x) = cosh x + sinh x.
This is trivial and only rarely used. It has been included to show the analogy.
Addition formulæ:
sinh(x + y) = sinh(x) cosh(y) + cosh(x) sinh(y),
sinh(x −y) = sinh(x) cosh(y) −cosh(x) sinh(y),
cosh(x + y) = cosh(x) cosh(y) + sinh(x) sinh(y),
cosh(x −y) = cosh(x) cosh(y) −sinh(x) sinh(y).
Formulæ of halving and doubling the argument:
sinh(2x) = 2 sinh(x) cosh(x),
cosh(2x) = cosh2(x) + sinh2(x) = 2 cosh2(x) −1 = 2 sinh2(x) + 1,

Magnitudes of functions
We often have to compare functions for x →0+, or for x →∞. The simplest type of functions are
therefore arranged in an hierarchy:
1) logarithms,
2) power functions,
3) exponential functions,
4) faculty functions.
When x →∞, a function from a higher class will always dominate a function form a lower class. More
precisely:
A) A power function dominates a logarithm for x →∞:
(ln x)β
xα
→0
for x →∞,
α, β > 0.
B) An exponential dominates a power function for x →∞:
xα
ax →0
for x →∞,
α, a > 1.
C) The faculty function dominates an exponential for n →∞:
an
n! →0,
n →∞,
n ∈N,
a > 0.
D) When x →0+ we also have that a power function dominates the logarithm:
xα ln x →0−,
for x →0+,
α > 0.
