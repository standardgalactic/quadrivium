Introduction to CRM 2011
Every organization is dependent on customers, and every organization is challenged 
to manage these customers. Businesses need a way to attract, sell to, service, and 
track every interaction these customers have with their organization. To do so, they 
often implement a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system.

Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Overview
[ 8 ]
Microsoft offers a CRM solution as part of their Dynamics suite, which allows 
companies to implement a system that manages more than just their customers. 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM is a web-based application that can be accessed online 
through an Internet browser or through Microsoft Office Outlook.

[ 9 ]
Microsoft Dynamics CRM includes three main modules:
•	
Sales
•	
Marketing
•	
Customer service
Each module contains entities, which are objects in CRM, and are used to help 
model data.
Throughout this book, business examples will be used to explain various concepts. 
A fictitious company called Race2Win Insurance Company will be used to further 
illustrate these concepts.
Sales module
Microsoft Dynamics CRM allows businesses to optimize their sales processes and 
customer tracking efforts. With CRM, an organization can increase interactions with 
current customers, shorten sales cycles, and increase opportunity close rates to gain 
new customers.
The sales module within CRM consists of the following entities:
•	
Leads
•	
Accounts
•	
Contacts
•	
Opportunities
•	
Marketing lists
•	
Products
•	
Sales literature
•	
Quotes
•	
Orders
•	
Invoices
•	
Competitors
•	
Quick campaigns
•	
Goals
•	
Goal metrics
•	
Rollup queries
Each of these entities are explained in more detail in the upcoming chapters of this 
book, but let's give a high-level overview of how users could potentially use these  
out of the box capabilities.

Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Overview
[ 10 ]
Business scenarios
The business scenarios that we'll cover in a moment outlines the use of the sales 
module for our fictitious insurance company. Although entities such as marketing 
lists, quick campaigns, and sales literature are found in the sales module, these will 
be discussed in the marketing business scenarios. For our scenarios, we'll illustrate 
examples from the viewpoint of various individual roles within the organization.
Leads
Race2Win Insurance Company needs a way to track leads they've acquired as a 
result of efforts by their marketing team. Microsoft Dynamics CRM allows the 
company to track and qualify leads. For example, let's say Race2Win is capturing 
information on the lead record related to a potential insurance customer. Based  
on information entered, business rules can be applied to categorize the lead as  
hot, warm, or cold. CRM has out of the box functionality to apply these business  
rules automatically.
Once a lead is qualified, Dynamics CRM provides the ability to convert the lead into 
an opportunity, account, contact, or a combination of the three.
Accounts
The organizations or companies that Race2Win Insurance views as customers can 
be tracked as accounts in CRM. These accounts may be managed by one or more 
salespeople. A salesperson may receive commission on sales made to their managed 
accounts, thus making accounts critical. Accounts contain the address, industry, and 
various other demographic data about the customer.
Contacts
As part of the sales process, Race2Win Insurance Company's sales force may reach 
out to individuals or employees at a company. Individuals, either on their own 
or tied to a company, can be tracked as contacts in Microsoft Dynamics CRM. 
Like the account, contact records can store addresses and industry/professional 
information, but can also store more personal data, such as birthdays, anniversaries, 
and information about various family members. A salesperson may find personal 
information critical to start and maintain a personal relationship with people at a 
company.

Chapter 1
[ 11 ]
Opportunities
Opportunities can allow the Race2Win sales force to track potential sales 
opportunities with their customers. The opportunities can go through various 
sales cycles, and can track the estimated versus actual revenue of a particular sale. 
Opportunities can have products from the product catalog associated to them 
in order to help estimate the revenue more accurately. The Race2Win Insurance 
salespeople receive their commission when an opportunity is won, and the 
commission amount is based on the estimated revenue.
Products
Race2Win Insurance Company has various insurance products and services it 
may sell. Products can be sold to different customers at different prices, and some 
products may be eligible for discounts based on the quantity ordered. Dynamics 
CRM allows all of the above functionality through the use of the product catalog.
Quotes
Let's say that during the course of a sales cycle, the customer wishes to receive more 
detailed pricing information such as an estimate from the Race2Win salesperson. 
Dynamics CRM allows a quote to be generated ad hoc or from an opportunity. In 
either case, products from the product catalog can be added, prices from the price list 
can be used, and discounts can be applied—all to create an accurate quote.
Orders
If a customer wishes to proceed with purchasing products or services, the 
opportunity can be closed as won. The salesperson will receive commission, and 
the process is now handed off to someone in order entry to create an order. Orders 
can be created ad hoc, from an opportunity, or quote. If an opportunity or quote has 
products, prices, and/or discounts, these can be inherited, making the generation of 
the order timely and accurate.
Invoices
An invoice can be generated for a customer in place of an order if needed. Many 
other organizations like Race2Win have their billing department typically create an 
invoice once the order is ready to be billed. An invoice can be created ad hoc or from 
an opportunity, quote, or order. Like an order, invoices can inherit the products, 
prices, and/or discounts from an opportunity, quote, or order.
While quotes, orders, and invoices can be created in Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM, sometimes they are created in an ERP system 
and then imported into Dynamics CRM for reference or reporting.

Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Overview
[ 12 ]
Competitors
Race2Win Insurance Company has now been using the leads generated to attain new 
customers, increase sales, and generate quotes, orders, and invoices for customers 
quickly and efficiently. Like any successful organization, Race2Win has to deal with 
competition. Dynamics CRM gives the organization's sales force and management 
the ability to track competitors, analyze their sales strategies, products, and the 
business they win.
Goals
Throughout a period of time, say fiscal year, an organization like Race2Win can 
set up goals to track various metrics such as sales performance. These goals can be 
tracked for each individual, and managers have the ability to see each of their team 
member's goals. The entire business scenario we just outlined can be achieved by 
using the Microsoft Dynamics CRM sales module.
Marketing module
Microsoft Dynamics CRM allows an organization to launch and maintain marketing 
campaigns. The responses to a campaign can be tracked to gauge the effectiveness 
of a campaign. These responses can also be converted into accounts, contacts, leads, 
quotes, orders, or opportunities.
The Dynamics CRM marketing module consists of the following entities:
•	
Leads
•	
Accounts
•	
Contacts
•	
Marketing lists
•	
Campaigns
•	
Quick campaigns
•	
Sales literature
•	
Products
Each of these entities are explained in more detail in the upcoming chapters of this 
book, but let's again look at a high-level overview.

Chapter 1
[ 13 ]
Business scenarios
The business scenarios that we'll cover in a moment outlines the use of the marketing 
module using our fictitious company, Race2Win Insurance Company. Race2Win's 
marketing team has analyzed its existing customer base and found areas to expand 
the company's business. They can market new products and services to their existing 
customer base, and try and turn potential customers into new ones.
Marketing lists
Race2Win has realized that it needs to market new insurance products to an existing 
list of accounts, and market existing products to potential customers in China. 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM allows Race2Win to set up a marketing list containing a 
static list of accounts. They can also use CRM to set up a dynamic marketing list of 
all leads where the address has the country set to China.
Campaigns
Using marketing lists, an organization can kick off, run, and evaluate marketing 
campaigns. Race2Win can kick off a campaign very quickly for the existing 
accounts and it can also execute a more lengthy campaign, containing multiple 
communication channels, for the leads in China. Depending on the campaign type, 
the marketing team can create planning activities, track the cost of the campaign,  
and target certain products.
Sales literature
At times, customers or even internal business users may want to know more about 
a product that an organization is selling or marketing. Race2Win is no different, 
dealing with multiple inquiries about products from customers on a weekly basis. 
The sales literature in CRM can offer collateral for marketing or sales teams to share. 
An example can be a brochure of their latest insurance products.
The scenarios we just described illustrates how the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
marketing module can be used to achieve any marketing goal.
Customer service module
Obtaining new customers is an important goal of any organization, but servicing 
existing customers is just as important. Microsoft Dynamics CRM offers a  
solution to service an organization's customers, manage service resources,  
and maintain a knowledge base repository that can be used to efficiently  
resolve future service incidents.

Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Overview
[ 14 ]
The Dynamics CRM service module consists of the following entities:
•	
Cases
•	
Service calendar
•	
Accounts
•	
Contacts
•	
Knowledge base articles
•	
Contracts
•	
Products
•	
Goals
•	
Goal metrics
•	
Rollup queries
Each of these entities are explained in more detail in the upcoming chapters of this 
book, but let's look at a high-level overview of how an organization could potentially 
use these out of the box capabilities.
Business scenarios
Thanks to CRM, Race2Win Insurance Company has been able to effectively market 
and sell its products to companies in a wide range of industries all over the world. 
Now it's time for Race2Win to start servicing their clients, and it's Dynamics CRM to 
the rescue once again.
Cases
Let us say a customer didn't receive their invoice for insurance products that they 
purchased. This customer e-mails this issue to a client service representative at 
Race2Win. With Dynamics CRM, this e-mail can be converted to a case. During that 
process of conversion, an account or contact can be linked (the case can reference 
a product if needed). Once converted, the original e-mail will be tied to the newly 
opened case. After the case is created, it can be assigned to a user, or routed to a 
queue. Throughout its lifecycle, activities such as e-mails, phone calls, and/or tasks 
can be tracked as a part of the case.
Knowledge base articles
In trying to resolve the case, users can access a repository of knowledge base articles 
to reference past issues and resolutions.

Chapter 1
[ 15 ]
Contracts
Race2Win can use CRM to create service contracts to define the type and level of 
support required. These contracts can then be referenced when new cases are opened.
Service calendar
If the servicing of customers requires the allocation of resources, whether that is 
an individual employee, a contractor, a facility or equipment, Dynamics CRM's 
scheduling features can assist. The service calendar can show users how each 
resource is being allocated for a given time period. With this knowledge, you can 
schedule resources more efficiently in order to deliver a prompt resolution to a case.
As you can see, CRM has a rich feature set that can be used to service any type of 
client. We just went through a high-level introduction of the three main modules 
in Microsoft Dynamics CRM. This book is a guide to help pass the CRM 2011 
Applications exam (MB2-868) and we will delve deeper into each of the modules 
to help you better understand the application. The next section gives you an 
introduction to Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 training and certifications.

Certifications
This section describes the two levels of certification available for Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM 2011, and the benefits of becoming certified.
Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist (MCTS)
MCTS certifications demonstrate your proficiency in a feature area of a Microsoft 
product. Passing any one of the four CRM 2011 exams described earlier in this 
chapter will earn you an MCTS certification.
Microsoft Certified IT Professional (MCITP)
MCITP certifications demonstrate your in-depth expertise across a number of 
Microsoft products. There are three MCITP certifications available:
Benefits of certification
Whether you work as an independent consultant, work for a Microsoft customer, or 
work for a Microsoft partner, earning a Microsoft Dynamics CRM certification leads 
the way to better career opportunities.
Microsoft partners value certified individuals because employing Microsoft 
Certified Professionals (MCPs) enables them to achieve silver and gold 
competencies that demonstrate their commitment to, and expertise in, Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM.
Microsoft customers value certified individuals because Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
solutions implemented, managed, and supported by MCPs have a lower total cost of 
ownership and a higher return on investment.
Achieving certification demonstrates the technical proficiency that validates your 
knowledge, adds credibility to your resume, and will help you advance in your 
career. When combined with real-world experience, certification will mean that 
you are more highly regarded than other individuals with similar experience who 
haven't taken training or shown sufficient initiative to achieve certification.

the exam directly after completing an instructor-led training course.
You should arrive at the test center about 30 minutes before you are scheduled to 
take your exam. You will be asked to present a photographic identification to the test 
center administrator and to sign in to a log book.
You cannot take anything into the exam room with you. This certification guide is  
so exciting that it can be hard to put down, but you'll have to do so while taking

Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Overview
[ 22 ]
How to make the best use of your time
Once the test center administrator has set up the exam on your computer, you will 
be able to start the exam. You have 3 hours to complete 75 exam questions, although 
some of this time will be spent reading the legal preamble regarding copyright and 
personal data protection.
Almost all candidates will comfortably complete the exam within the time limit. The 
questions in your test are taken at random from a large pool of possible questions, so 
no two exams will ever be exactly the same.
The passing mark is 700 points, but Prometric does not reveal the points awarded for 
each question.
The following are some tips to help you make the best use of your time:
•	
Spend lots of time reading the terms and conditions, privacy statements, 
and other legal preamble only if you've missed your calling to the legal 
profession. Otherwise, accept the statements and move on to the exam as 
quickly as possible.
•	
Read each question carefully. In particular, pay attention to phrases that 
indicate how many answers are required—for example, select one, choose 
three, or select all that apply—and whether you are expected to select true  
or false statements.
•	
Answer each question as best as you can in sequence. Do not skip questions 
by leaving them unanswered. Instead, if you are not confident in your 
answer, mark the question for review at the end.
•	
After you have answered all questions, reassess all of the questions that you 
have marked for review.
•	
Before finishing the exam, quickly review all of your answers to ensure that 
you have left no questions unanswered, and, where appropriate, that you 
have provided the required number of answers.
•	
Your intuition is often right. Change an answer only if you have an 
overwhelming feeling that your first answer was wrong.

Chapter 1
[ 23 ]
How to answer the questions
There are two types of multiple choice questions in the exam:
•	
Multiple choice with one correct answer (radio buttons)
•	
Multiple choice with multiple possible answers (checkboxes)
Read the question carefully to see how many answers are required. Consider the 
following example question:
Q.1. The required fields when creating  a marketing list  are:  
(Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Member Type.
2.	 Campaign Type.
3.	 List Name.
4.	 Type.
5.	 Owner.
The answer to this question is 1, 3, 4, and 5.
This question is a good example of an off-syllabus question that sometimes appears 
in Microsoft certification exams. The Microsoft training course syllabuses and exams 
are written by different groups of people and do not always cover exactly the same 
material. So, it is possible to encounter an exam question that wasn't included in the 
syllabus. This guide covers the course syllabus, and a deep understanding of all of 
the material covered here will be sufficient to achieve a passing score, but broader 
hands-on experience and additional reading is recommended if you want to achieve 
a perfect score.

Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Overview
[ 24 ]
Summary
In this chapter, a brief introduction to Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 was presented. 
Each of the three main modules—sales, marketing, and service—were covered at a 
high level, along with business scenarios centered around a fictitious organization 
called Race2Win Insurance Company. Race2Win Insurance Company's inside 
sales team uses CRM to track the leads they've generated. They use business 
rules to qualify the leads and hand them off to other sales representatives who 
manage accounts. The leads, if needed, can be converted to an account, contact, 
opportunity, or a combination of the three. Accounts allow Race2Win to manage 
organizations they do business with; contacts are individuals that may or may 
not be tied to an account; and opportunities enable the tracking of potential sales 
to their customers. Opportunities can also track estimated and actual revenue. To 
get a more accurate measure of revenue, opportunities can reference Race2Win's 
products, prices, and discounts. Quotes can be used to give a customer an estimate of 
costs. Once a customer agrees to make a purchase, Race2Win's order entry team can 
generate an order and/or an invoice. As Race2Win continues to grow its business, 
the competition will grow stiffer. Dynamics CRM allows Race2Win to analyze a 
competitor's sales strategies, products, and the business they win. Lastly, the sales 
module can help Race2Win to set up goals for their employees, such as sales goals. 
These goals can also be rolled up to a larger goal.
To grow their customer base even more, Race2Win's marketing team can use the 
Dynamics CRM marketing module to create marketing lists. These lists group 
accounts, contacts, or leads into a list for use in marketing campaigns. The campaigns 
can be very simple with one communication channel and an abbreviated timeline. 
They can also be more complex, tracking planning activities, campaign costs, and 
even targeted products. If a potential or existing customer would like to learn 
more about a specific product, Race2Win can send them sales literature, including 
marketing collateral around products or services.
Every organization, including Race2Win, must keep their customers happy. 
Race2Win must ensure that any issues with the quality of their products, the level  
of customer service, and billing get resolved efficiently. CRM's service module 
allows Race2Win to open up cases any time an issue arises. Knowledge base articles 
can be created or referenced throughout the life cycle of a case, allowing cases to be 
resolved more efficiently. If Race2Win has set up any service contracts (for example, 
a contract limiting the number of cases that can be opened for a customer), these can 
be referenced as well.

Chapter 1
[ 25 ]
The second half of the chapter revolved around Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 
training and certification. There are several Microsoft courses you can take, from 
learning about the application itself, to installing, configuring, and extending it. 
These courses are not mandatory, but can help, along with books like this, to pass the 
related certification exams.
Dynamics CRM 2011 has four certification exams:
•	
Exam MB2-866: Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Customization and 
Configuration
•

Exam MB2-876: Extending Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011
If you pass any one of the four exams, you will be a Microsoft Certified Technology 
Specialist (MCTS). Certifications can help to validate the knowledge you've gained in 
your training, as well as bolster your resume.
Specifically about the Dynamics CRM application's certification (MB2-868), there  
are different ways to pass the exam. You can take any of the instructor-led or  
e-learning courses mentioned earlier in this chapter. You can also download the 
official courseware from Microsoft CustomerSource or PartnerSource if you have 
access to either. In conjunction with this, or alternatively, you can use this book!  
With that said, one of the most important tools to supplement your learning is  
hands-on experience to help reinforce the knowledge you've attained.
Once you feel confident and are ready to take the exam, you can book it online at 
Prometric (http://www.prometric.com/Microsoft/Dynamics.htm). The exam is 
written in different languages, such as Spanish, French, and German, and usually 
costs USD 150.
Once you are at the test taking center, some helpful exam taking tips are: quickly 
accept the legal statements at the beginning of the exam and move on to the 
questions as quickly as possible; read each question carefully, paying attention  
to phrases that indicate how many answers are required; answer each question as  
best as you can in sequence; and if you are not confident in your answer, mark  
the question for review at the end.
This chapter has provided you with an introduction to the Dynamics CRM 
application, and the MB2-868 certification exam. In the next chapter, you'll  
learn how to track interactions between other users and customers by using  
activities and notes.

Activities
Activities are a way for an organization to track interactions both with users in 
their own company and with their customers. An example of a type of activity is 
a manager creating a task for someone on their team to set up an appointment for 
the rest of the team. The appointment itself can also be an activity that is tracked in 
CRM. Another example is when a salesperson makes a phone call to a customer: 
they can track the content of the conversation and duration in CRM.
Business scenarios
Race2Win Insurance Company sells insurance products all over the world. They 
recently launched a campaign around new products they'll be offering in the 
upcoming year. One of their best customers responded to the campaign, expressing 
interest. The marketing team creates a campaign response activity to record the 
interest expressed. They then pass on this information to the salesperson managing 
this account.
The salesperson assigned to the account starts the selling process and can use 
CRM activities to track all interactions they have with the customer. To track this 
interaction, each activity created can be associated to a record in the system (see the 
Activity attributes section and the Common attributes sub-section for more information 
on the field used to associate a record to an activity).

Activities and Notes
[ 28 ]
The salesperson begins by making a phone call to one of their contacts at the 
company, in order to understand the selling environment, and to figure out the best 
date and time for a meeting. They can create a phone call activity in CRM to enter 
some notes about the conversation. The salesperson can associate the activity to both 
the account on which they are working and the contact they are calling. Doing this 
allows the salesperson to track the interaction they have had with this contact about 
the account.
After the salesperson gets some background information, they set up a task to 
create an agenda for the meeting. While they are working on the agenda, they set 
up an appointment with the expected attendees. After the agenda is completed, the 
salesperson sends an e-mail to the group with the agenda attached.
One day before the meeting the sales representative's contact e-mails them to fax 
more information about the product they will be selling. The e-mail sent by the 
contact can also be tracked in Dynamics CRM. The sales representative finds sales 
literature tied to the product and prints it out. They then fax over a copy of the 
document to their contact. The salesperson creates a fax activity record to track the 
fact that they sent a fax to her contact.
The salesperson gives their sales pitch, and hours later the company decides to 
purchase the insurance product. The salesperson is elated and sends a letter to the 
individuals at the meeting thanking them for the business. The salesperson can 
create a letter activity record recording this interaction as well.
Fast forward a few months, and it's time for another sales opportunity with the same 
customer. The salesperson assigned to the account is out on vacation, so another 
sales representative steps in. That salesperson can look at the account and see the 
history of communication the previous salesperson had.
Tracking communications within Dynamics CRM can play a vital role in understanding 
a customer, and their history. The different types of activities in CRM are:
•	
Task: Records a to-do or a follow-up item
•	
E-mail: Records a sent or received e-mail message
•	
Phone call: Records a phone call started or received
•	
Letter: Records the mailing of a letter
•	
Fax: Records a sent or received fax
•	
Appointment: Records a meeting
•	
Recurring appointment: Records a recurring meeting.
•	
Service activity: Records service performed for a customer
•	
Campaign response: Records a response to a campaign
•	
Custom activity: Records a custom activity

Chapter 2
[ 29 ]
Custom activities
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 includes new functionality that allows an 
organization to create custom activity types. With ever-changing communication 
channels, and activities being crucial in tracking those communications, it's 
imperative that there are other activity types. An example is a custom activity for a 
text message. Text messages sent or received could potentially be recorded in CRM.
Activity attributes
Most activity types have a set of common attributes. Attributes are essentially fields 
in Dynamics CRM.
Common attributes
A list of common attributes available for nearly all activity types, is shown in the 
following table:

The campaign response activity is explained in Chapter 3, Managing Marketing 
Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns. The service activity is 
explained in Chapter 8, Managing Service Scheduling Applications, where we go into  
the service scheduling aspect of Dynamics CRM. For now let's take a look how to 
create an activity record in CRM.

Activities and Notes
[ 36 ]
Creating activities
For this example, let's create a task activity record. Follow these steps :
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Workplace module, and then click on Activities.
2.	 Click on the Task button.
3.	 Enter the following required fields:
i.	
Subject: Enter a clear, concise description of the task.
ii.	 Owner: This defaults to the currently logged in user, but can  
be changed.

Chapter 2
[ 37 ]
Although the Regarding field not a required, it is highly recommended to 
populate this field. This field helps link the activity to a particular record. 
Click on the lookup and find a record to associate the task to.
If you are on a record, say an account, and then create a task 
from the context of the account, the Regarding field will be 
auto-populated with the account that you were on.
4.	 Click on Save.
Once an activity is created, the activity can be re-assigned to a user or team. In this 
way, multiple users can perform the various interactions both internally and with 
customers. The next step in the activity lifecycle is to complete the activity.
For different activities the concept of completing an activity varies. All out of the box 
activities other than E-mail and Campaign Response have a button, Mark Complete, 
to complete the activity. For an e-mail, when the e-mail is sent, the activity is essentially 
complete. For a campaign response, the activity is closed (not completed) when the 
campaign is either converted or marked closed. More about campaign responses is 
covered in Chapter 3, Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists  
and Campaigns.
Completing activities
For this example, let us complete a task activity. To do so, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Workplace module, and then click on Activities.
2.	 Find the task that you wish to complete and open the record.
3.	 Click the Mark Complete button.
Once an activity is completed, the certain parts of the activity form become read 
only, but notes can be added, files can be attached, and the activity can be shared 
with other users or teams. Notes are discussed later in this chapter.

Activities and Notes
[ 38 ]
Viewing activities
Activities can be seen by using Dynamics CRM views or on the entity that the 
Regarding field was set to. For example, if on a task activity record, the Regarding 
field was set to an account with the name of ABC Company, then you can view the 
task in the list of activities associated to ABC Company.
Viewing activities on a record
By default, every activity record has the following statuses:
•	
Open
•	
Completed
•	
Canceled
•	
Scheduled
In the left-hand navigation of records that have activities associated to them, 
activities are broken out into Activities and Closed Activities:
Activities with a status of open or scheduled are found when clicking on Activities. 
Activities with a status of completed or canceled can be found when click on Closed 
Activities. Not only are activities related to records via the Regarding field, but some 
activities are rolled up to other records.
When a user navigates to the list of activities or closed activities, they will be directed 
to an associated view. A view is an area that displays data, and an associated view 
displays data about an associated or related record. Most views in CRM can be 
configured to display filtered data, and give users the ability to sort certain columns.

Chapter 2
[ 39 ]
The associated view for open activities has two filters, as shown in the preceding 
screenshot. The first filter displays activities that are overdue or are due within the 
time period specified. For example, if the filter of Next 30 days is selected, then it will 
display all activities that are overdue and with a due date within the next 30 days.
The second filter has two options—This Record Only and Related "Regarding" 
Records. The first option displays all activities where the Regarding field is set to 
the record you're viewing. It also displays activities where other system relationship 
fields are set to the record, for example, on an e-mail, if the To field is set to the 
record, or on a phone call if the Recipient field is set to the record.
The second option shows all activities with the Regarding field set to the record itself 
or any related record using the activity roll-up functionality.
Activity roll-up
Dynamics CRM boasts the ability to give users a 360 degree view of their customers. 
One of the features that helps to give users a big-picture view when it comes to 
activities is the activity roll-up. The activity roll-up allows users to see activities of 
certain child records on the parent record.
Dynamics CRM allows a hierarchal relationship between entities, allowing an 
organization to model its data around real-world situations. For example, a company 
can have one or more people that can serve as contacts associated to it. Another 
example is that a company can have a parent company. For example, Race2Win 
Insurance Company may have a parent company called Race2Win LLC. To allow for 
this, an account can have a relationship to another account, and one or more contacts. 
In the aforementioned example, the account is a parent record to another account 
(child record), and a parent to one or more contacts (child record(s)).

Activities and Notes
[ 40 ]
When it comes to the activity roll-up, if you were to open an account record, and 
click on the left-hand side navigation on either Activities or Closed Activities, 
you'll be able to see a list of activities associated to the record. If the view filter was 
set to include Related "Regarding" Records, then you will see activities where the 
Regarding field or another system field on the activity (to, from, recipient and so on), 
was set to that account. You will also see all activities where the Regarding field is 
set to related records to that account, such as contacts or opportunities.
An illustration of this can be found on Jukka Niiranen's blog  
(http://niiranen.eu/crm), and is replicated below:
In the illustration above, you can see a relationship between two accounts, one 
contact, one opportunity, one order, and some activities. The way activity roll-up 
works is that from the sub-account's activity associated view, you can see activities 
tied to the sub-sub-account, contact, opportunity and order. However, from the 
top-level account, you can only see the task on the sub-sub-account. Jukka says the 
reason for this is that none of the activities in the sub-account's activity view were 
set as regarding that particular account record. Essentially CRM, behind the scenes, 
looks at the child record's view to determine which activities to roll-up.
Activity views
Activities can also be viewed by going to the Workplace area and clicking on 
Activities. In the view list you'll see the following:

Chapter 2
[ 41 ]
The All Activities view can be further broken down into the following basic views:
•	
All Activities: This is a list of all activities regardless of status.
•	
Closed Activities: This is a list of all activities with a status of completed  
or canceled.
•	
My Closed Activities: This is a list of all activities with a status of completed 
or canceled and where the owner is the currently logged in user.
•	
My Open Activities: This is a list of all activities with a status of open or 
scheduled and where the owner is the currently logged in user.
•	
Open Activities: This is a list of all activities with a status of open  
or scheduled.
•	
Scheduled Activities: This is a list of all activities with a status of scheduled.
Each of the other activity types shown in the preceding screenshot have their own 
views as well. For example, the task entity has the following views:
•	
All Tasks
•	
My Tasks
•	
Tasks Being Followed
•	
Tasks I Follow
Delving into each view for each activity entity is not necessary for the certification 
exam and we will not cover these any further.

E-mail templates
We've just seen how an e-mail in CRM is a type of activity. CRM uses an e-mail 
template to help users send the same e-mail to multiple recipients such as accounts 
and/or contacts.
Creating e-mail templates
To create an e-mail template, follow these steps :
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Settings module, and then click on Templates.
2.	 Click on E-mail Templates.
3.	 Click on New.

Chapter 2
[ 43 ]
4.	 In the E-mail Template Type dialog, select the type of template that you 
want to create. The template type defines which entity the e-mail will apply 
to. The Global template type means the e-mail can be applied to any entity.
5.	 Click on OK.
6.	 Enter the following required fields:
i.	
Title: Enter a clear concise title for the e-mail template
ii.	 Subject: Enter a subject for the e-mail

Activities and Notes
[ 44 ]
7.	 While entering values for either the Subject or Body, you can enter 
placeholders for fields from an entity or related record. To do this, click on 
the Insert/Update button.
8.	 In the Data Field Values dialog box, click on Add to select fields from the 
entity or related entities selected in Template Type.
9.	 Click on OK.
10.	 Repeat steps 8 and 9 until all necessary placeholders have been added.
11.	 Click on Save and Close.
Once a template has been created, it can be used to send direct e-mails.
Direct e-mails using e-mail templates
Direct e-mails are e-mails that are sent directly to one or more records by using an 
e-mail template. For this example, we'll illustrate how to send a direct e-mail to a 
number of contacts. To send a direct e-mail, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM and click on the Sales module.
2.	 Click on Contacts.

Chapter 2
[ 45 ]
3.	 Find and select one or more contacts to which you want to send an e-mail. 
You can use the view, or an advanced find, to help you search faster.
4.	 Click on Send Direct E-mail in the Contacts ribbon bar under the 
Collaborate group.

Activities and Notes
[ 46 ]
5.	 In the Send Direct E-mail dialog box, select the following information:
i.	
Language: Select the language of the e-mail template, to filter the 
list of available templates.
ii.	 Template: Select the type of template to use. In this case all global 
templates will be listed, and then any template with a template 
type of Contact.
iii.	 Send direct e-mail to: Choose whether to an e-mail to records 
you selected on this page, all records on the page, or all records 
on all pages in the current view.
iv.	 Send direct e-mail from: Select a user or queue to send the  
e-mail from.
6.	 Click on Send.
Another method for users in CRM to track interactions is the use of notes.
Notes
Notes allow users to capture free form notes about a record. In addition to text, 
whenever a file is attached to a record, it appears in the notes area. An example  
is a salesperson wanting to add notes to an opportunity that they are working on.
Creating notes
For this example, we use the contact record once again. To create a note, follow  
these steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on Workplace, and then click on Contacts.
2.	 Find and open the contact record to which you wish to add the note.
3.	 On the ribbon bar, on the Add tabbed page, in the Include group, click on 
Add Note.

Chapter 2
[ 47 ]
You can also add notes if there is a Notes section on the form. 
Within the Notes section, you can enter text on the spot.
4.	 Enter the following field:
i.	
Title: A clear, concise name for the note. This field is required.
The Regarding field is not required, but it is worth mentioning that it will be 
auto-populated with the record from which you are creating the note.
5.	 Click on Save and Close.

Summary
Activities provide a way for an organization to track interactions with users in their 
own organization and with their customers. The different types of activities are:
•	
Task
•	
E-mail
•	
Phone call
•	
Letter
•	
Fax
•	
Appointment
•	
Recurring appointment
•	
Service activity
•	
Campaign response
•	
Custom activity
A custom activity allows an organization to track communication with other users or 
their customers, outside of traditional communication methods. Although these are 
becoming more common, some examples of custom activities are text messages and 
social media posts such as Facebook and Twitter.
Activities have several common attributes among the different record types, such as 
Subject, Owner and Regarding. Activity types such as e-mail, phone call, letter, fax 
and appointment have their own specific attributes. The aforementioned Regarding 
field is very important as it denotes the record related to the activity. This field is 
used to link the activity record to a record in the CRM system.
When an activity has been finished it can be marked completed. Once an activity is 
completed, certain parts of the activity form become read only, but notes can still be 
added, files can be attached, and the activity can be shared with other users or teams.
Activities can be seen on the "regarding" records via the activity associated view, 
through the activity roll-up functionality, or by using the activity views.
Notes can also be added to any entity that has the notes functionality enabled.  
Notes are yet another method for users to track interactions between other users  
and customers.
In the next chapter, you will learn how to create and manage marketing lists, 
campaigns, and campaign responses. You will also learn how to analyze marketing 
data in order to provide your organization with effective reporting.

Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns
[ 52 ]
Introduction to marketing list core records
As its name implies, a core record is a type of record that is central to Dynamics 
CRM. These record types may or may not be used, depending on the organization's 
needs. A marketing list is a group of three core record types: accounts, contacts, or 
leads. A few examples are a marketing list consisting of accounts with an address in 
the United States, contacts that belong to a company with an address in the United 
States, or leads entered into Dynamics CRM as a result of a recent trade show. A 
marketing list can only have one type of core record and that type is set at the time of 
creation of the list.
•	
A lead represents a prospective customer that a user can qualify or 
disqualify. These leads may come from website enquiry forms, trade shows, 
conventions, and so on.
•	
Accounts are essentially other organizations that your company has a 
business relationship with.
•	
Contacts represent individuals that your organization has a relationship 
with. These individuals can be related to accounts as well.
Creating and managing marketing lists
When creating marketing lists, there are three required fields that you must fill out:
•	
Member type: This defines which core record makes up the marketing list. 
A marketing list can only have one core record type, which can be account, 
contact, or lead. Once the member type is set on a marketing list, it cannot  
be changed.
•	
List name: This is a descriptive name for the marketing list. The name is 
shown on lookups for marketing lists, and is a primary field for the entity.
•	
Type: This can be either static or dynamic. The members of a static marketing 
list do not change unless updated manually. A dynamic marketing list is 
defined by a query, and the members are dynamically updated.
Let us take a look how to create static and dynamic marketing lists.
Creating static marketing lists
A scenario with our fictitious insurance company will give an example of how a 
static marketing list can be used.

Chapter 3
[ 53 ]
Business scenarios
Race2Win Insurance Company is an organization that needs to market to their 
current customers that have an address in the United States. One option is to create a 
static marketing list with the following required fields filled out:
•	
Member type = Account
•	
List name = "Clients located in the United States."
•	
Type = Static
Once the marketing list is saved, the member type and marketing list type cannot 
be changed. At the time members are added to this list, the list remains static until 
a user manually manages the list. Even if more accounts are added to CRM with an 
address in the United States, this marketing list's members will remain the same.
Perform the following steps to create a static marketing list:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Marketing module, and then click on  
Marketing Lists.
2.	 On the Marketing List ribbon, in the Records group, click on New.
3.	 Enter the following required fields:
°°
Name: Enter a clear, concise description of the list
°°
Type: Select Static
°°
Member Type: Select either the Account, Contact, or Lead core 
record to determine what the list will comprise of

4.	 On the Marketing List ribbon, click on Save.
5.	 On the Marketing List ribbon, in the Actions group, click on Manage 
Members.
6.	 In the Manage Members dialog box, you can manage members by using  
the following options:
°°
Use a lookup to find, select, and add members
°°
Use an advanced find to add members
°°
Use an advanced find to remove members
°°
Use an advanced find to evaluate members that already exist  
on the list
7.	 Select the method to add, remove, and manage members.
8.	 Click on OK.
9.	 Use either the lookup dialog box or advanced find to add or remove members.

Chapter 3
[ 55 ]
Once members have been added or removed, you can view the members by clicking 
on Marketing List Members in the left-hand navigation pane. After members have 
been added, you can update static marketing lists in many different ways.
This is the first time that advanced find is being introduced. 
According to http://rc.crm.dynamics.com/rc/regcont/
en_us/op/articles/vidAdvancedFind.aspx, you can use 
advanced find to search for records given certain criteria. After 
you get the results of the search, you can analyze, edit, assign, 
or share one or more records. You can also save the search for 
future use as a personal view. An example of an advanced 
find is to search for all contacts that are tied to an account with 
a business address located in London, England. More about 
advanced find is given near the end of this chapter.
Managing members dialog box
As stated in the previous section, there are multiple ways to manage members in a 
marketing list. The first option is to use a lookup to add members; this displays a 
dialog box. The dialog box allows you to select one or more records of the marketing 
list member type (account, contact, or lead). The next two options allow the use of the 
advanced find feature to search for records to either add or remove. The last option 
uses an advanced find to update a marketing list by using the results from the query 
to determine which members to keep on the list. The options listed in the previous 
section are just a few ways in which you can manage marketing list members.
Updating static marketing lists
You can only add or remove members of the same type (defined when the  
marketing list was created). To add or remove leads, accounts, or contacts,  
use the following methods:
1.	 Click on the Manage Members button on the ribbon and use one of the 
options described in step 6 of the previous Business scenarios section.
2.	 If you're inside a lead, account, or contact record, you can click on the  
Add to Marketing List button.
3.	 If you're in a view of leads, account, or contacts, you can select one or more 
records and then click on the Add to Marketing List button on the ribbon.
4.	 From an advanced find list of leads, accounts or contacts, you can click on the 
Add to Marketing List button.
Let us now take a look how to create dynamic marketing lists.

Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns
[ 56 ]
Creating dynamic marketing lists
Perform the following steps to create a dynamic marketing list:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Marketing module, and then click on  
Marketing Lists.
2.	 On the Marketing List ribbon, in the Records group, click on New.
3.	 Enter the following required fields:
°°
Name: Enter a clear, concise description of the marketing list
°°
Type: Select Dynamic
°°
Member Type: Select either the Account, Contact, or Lead core 
record to determine what the list will comprise of
4.	 On the Marketing List ribbon, click on Save.
5.	 On the Marketing List ribbon, in the Actions group, click on  
Manage Members.
6.	 Use the advanced find feature to build a query to select the members of the 
marketing list. For example, you can use advanced find to build a query 
to retrieve all accounts with a business address in the city of Sydney and a 
country of Australia.

Chapter 3
[ 57 ]
7.	 You can click on Find to preview the members that the query returns. Once 
you're satisfied with the query, click on the Use Query button to enable the 
marketing list to use this query.
The way dynamic marketing list works is that each time the list is used, the 
underlying query (built by using advanced find) is run, allowing the maintenance of 
its members to be automatic. Thus, if you need to manage the members of a dynamic 
marketing list, the advanced find query will need to be modified.
Business scenarios
The static marketing list Race2Win Insurance Company created for their clients with 
an address in the United States has outlived its usefulness. Business is excellent, and 
as they open more offices and gain more clients, they've found the effort needed 
to manage the static marketing list to be great. To meet their business need, the 
marketing team has decided to create a dynamic marketing list with the following 
required fields filled out:
•	
Member type = Account
•	
List name = "Clients located in the United States."
•	
Type = Dynamic
With this scenario, as more accounts are added with an address in the United States, 
the marketing list will reflect these additions. Because of this flexibility, there's no 
real need to manage these members on a regular basis.
We have walked through the creation and management of static and dynamic 
marketing lists. Let us now discuss how a dynamic marketing list can be copied  
to a static one.
Copying a dynamic marketing list to a static 
marketing list
A dynamic marketing list can be copied to a static marketing list, creating a snapshot 
and permanently adding the members to the list. To create this snapshot, perform 
the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Marketing module, and then click on  
Marketing Lists.
2.	 Find and open the dynamic marketing list that you wish to copy to a  
static list.

Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns
[ 58 ]
3.	 Click on the Copy to Static button.
4.	 Click on OK.
The advanced find query will be executed to retrieve the list of members and then 
add these to a new static marketing list. The new list will be locked and have the 
same name as the dynamic marketing list plus a timestamp at the end. For example, 
if the dynamic marketing list is named "Target Accounts in Asia," the new static copy 
could be named "Target Accounts in Asia 1/1/2013 8:33:13 PM."
Copying a dynamic list to a static list allows organizations to keep a history of its 
lists at points in time. Another copy feature that CRM has is to copy members of one 
or marketing lists to another list.
Copying marketing lists
You can copy members from one or more dynamic or static marketing lists, but you 
can only copy the members to a static list. To copy a marketing list, perform the 
following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Marketing module, and then click on  
Marketing Lists.
2.	 Find the marketing list from which you want to copy the members.
3.	 Click on the Copy to Static button.
4.	 Click on OK.
Copying marketing lists acts as a way to merge marketing lists, as members are 
copied from one or more lists to another. What happens to the members of a 
marketing list if the list is deleted or deactivated?

Chapter 3
[ 59 ]
Deleting and deactivating marketing lists
Deleting or deactivating a marketing list does not remove the accounts, contacts 
or leads that were part of that list from the system. For example, if a marketing 
list contains a list of leads created in 2012, and the marketing list gets deleted or 
deactivated, the list of leads will still exist in CRM. If a list is deactivated, it can be 
reactivated at any time, and will retain its list of members.
As reviewed earlier, marketing lists can be either static or dynamic. It is worth 
highlighting specific differences between the two.
Dynamic versus static marketing lists
There is a great comparison between dynamic and static marketing lists at  
http://community.dynamics.com/product/crm/crmtechnical/b/crmbusiness/
archive/2011/11/24/crm-2011-the-difference-between-dynamic-and-
static-marketing-lists.aspx. These differences are summarized in the  
table below:
Dynamic list
Static list
Adding members
An advanced find query is 
associated to the marketing 
list. When the list is used, the 
query is run behind the scenes 
and members are added.
Members are manually added 
either using a lookup or an 
advanced find query.
Removing 
members
Automatically removed when 
the record doesn't meet the 
advanced find query.  
Use advanced find to add or 
"evaluate" members.
Updating 
members
Updated automatically and 
deactivated members are 
automatically removed.
Updated manually.
Creating and working with campaigns
A marketing campaign represents an organization's marketing plans, activities, and 
lists over a period of time. Campaigns allows an organization to track activities to 
plan a campaign, activities during a campaign such as e-mails, phone calls, tasks, 
and any responses to the campaign.
One of the ultimate goals for a campaign is to help generate more revenue for a 
business. In order for an organization to track those returns on investment, Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM has a way to track financials on a campaign.

Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns
[ 60 ]
Business scenarios
With marketing lists created, Race2Win Insurance Company is ready to initiate 
a campaign for the fiscal year. Race2Win has introduced a new line of insurance 
products and would like to market them to their contacts in Canada.
Race2Win's marketing team starts by creating a campaign and associating a 
marketing list to it. The marketing list contains all of Race2Win's contacts that 
reside in Canada. They start the process by creating planning activities to track any 
planning efforts and costs associated with the campaign. The marketing team can tie 
the new insurance products as targeted products to the campaign. This enables the 
company to track their marketing efforts for certain products and potentially track 
return on investment (ROI).
The company decides to utilize its inside sales team to make cold calls to these 
contacts. Race2Win's marketing team creates phone call campaign activities. These 
campaign activities can be distributed, which is a process to create and associate 
a phone call activity to each contact on the marketing list. When an inside sales 
representative makes a phone call to a customer, they can record the interaction 
within the phone call activity.
If a customer on the phone asks for more information about a product, the 
representative can reference sales literature for marketing collateral or more 
information. If a customer shows interest in purchasing a product, a campaign 
response can be created to tie back the interest shown by the customer to the 
campaign. Campaign responses are one way of measuring campaign effectiveness.
Lastly, if needed, a campaign can be associated to other campaigns. An example of 
this is if Race2Win wants to launch a campaign of new products in North America. 
They can a launch one campaign for North America, and then several "child" 
campaigns for Canada, the United States, and Latin America.
As you can see from the business scenario we just discussed, there are several 
components that go into a campaign:
•	
Planning activities
•	
Campaign activities
•	
Campaign responses
•	
Targeted products
•	
Sales literature
•	
Marketing lists
•	
Related campaigns

Chapter 3
[ 61 ]
Planning activities
Planning activities constitute any action taken to help plan a campaign. For example, 
your marketing team can start planning for a campaign by setting up appointments 
with various people, phone calls, e-mails and so on. These activities can be tracked  
as planning efforts for a campaign, and can help to quantify the time spent in 
planning a campaign.
Creating planning activities
To create a planning activity, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Marketing module, and then open the campaign you 
want to add the planning activity to.
2.	 In the left-hand navigation, click on Planning Activities.
3.	 On the Activities List tool tab on the Campaign ribbon, click on  
Add New Activity.
4.	 Select the appropriate activity that you want to associate to the campaign.
5.	 Click on Save.
The next step is to add one or more campaign activities so that once the campaign is 
launched it can be distributed to all of the core records in the target marketing lists.

Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns
[ 62 ]
Campaign activities
Campaign activities are much like standard Dynamics CRM activities, but they 
include financial tracking information. For example, if the activity is a letter, an 
organization can track the costs of paper, envelopes, and postage. These metrics can 
help track the cost of a campaign, much like how planning activities can track time 
spent on planning a campaign. Multiple campaign activities can be distributed per 
campaign, and each activity can use one or more marketing lists. When the cost of 
the activity is entered, it's rolled up into the overall cost of the campaign. Campaign 
activities can be used to distribute the following types of activities to the campaign's 
marketing list members:
•	
Appointment
•	
E-mail
•	
Fax
•	
Letter
•	
Phone call
Campaign activities are required in order for a campaign to be launched. Information 
about launching a campaign is mentioned later in this chapter.
Creating campaign activities
To create a campaign activity, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Marketing module, and then open the campaign that 
you want to add the planning activity to.
2.	 In the left-hand navigation, click on Campaign Activities.
3.	 On the Campaign Activities List Tools tab of the Campaign ribbon, click on 
Add New Campaign Activity.
4.	 Enter the following required fields:
°°
Parent Campaign: This field will auto-populate with the name of the 
campaign the activity is being created from.

Chapter 3
[ 63 ]
°°
Subject: Enter a clear, concise name for the activity.
°°
Channel: While this field is not required, this is an important  
field worth noting. This field captures the type of communication  
or activity to be used in this campaign. The following are the  
channel values:
1.	 Phone
2.	 Appointment
3.	 Letter
4.	 Letter via Mail Merge
5.	 Fax
6.	 Fax via Mail Merge
7.	 E-mail
8.	 E-mail via Mail Merge
9.	 Other
The channel values, except for Other, control the type of CRM 
activity that will be distributed to members of the marketing list  
tied to the campaign. For example, if you choose a channel of  
e-mail, when the campaign activity is distributed, an e-mail activity 
will be created for the members of the target marketing lists 
associated to the campaign.
°°
Owner: This field is auto-populated with the name of the user 
creating the record, but can be changed.
5.	 Click on Save.
Campaign responses
A campaign response is a way in which an organization can measure the success  
of a campaign by tracking its responses. Once campaign activities are distributed,  
if a customer responds to one or more activities, the response can be tracked  
using campaign responses. More about campaign responses is discussed later in  
this chapter.

Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns
[ 64 ]
Targeted products
If there are products being tracked in Dynamics CRM, then marketing campaigns 
can be used to promote certain products. This is a great way for an organization to 
track marketing efforts for various products and to measure marketing effectiveness 
for those products.
Adding targeted products
If an organization would like the campaign to focus on various products, they can do 
so by using the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Marketing module, and then open the campaign that 
you want to add the product to.
2.	 In the left-hand navigation, click on Targeted Products.
3.	 On the Campaign Activities List Tools tab of the Campaign ribbon, click on 
Add Existing Product.
4.	 Use the lookup dialog box to locate and select an existing product, and then 
click on OK.
Once the products have been associated to a campaign, we can help out the sales and 
marketing folks by adding literature about these products in case questions arise, or 
they want to pass it along to customers.
Sales literature
Sales literature is documentation about items in the product catalog. The sales 
literature entity can help an organization educate its employees and customers  
about certain products.

Chapter 3
[ 65 ]
Adding sales literature
To add sales literature to a campaign, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Marketing module, and then open the campaign that 
you want to add the sales literature to.
2.	 In the left-hand navigation, click on Sales Literature.
3.	 On the Campaign Activities List Tools tab of the Campaign ribbon, click on 
Add Existing Sales Literature.
4.	 Use the lookup dialog box to find and select an existing sales literature, and 
then click on OK.
The next component of a campaign is a required one in order for the campaign to be 
launched, and that is marketing lists.
Target marketing lists
Target marketing lists are essentially the marketing lists that an organization 
wants to target for a particular campaign. A campaign can have one or more target 
marketing lists and at least one is required in order for a campaign to be launched.
Adding marketing lists
Perform the following the steps to add a marketing list to a campaign:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Marketing module, and then click on Campaigns. 
Select the campaign you want and open it.
2.	 In the left-hand side navigation, click on Target Marketing Lists.
3.	 On the Campaign Activities List Tools tab of the Campaign ribbon, click on 
Add Existing Marketing List.
4.	 Use the lookup dialog box to find the marketing list.
5.	 Select the marketing list and add it.

Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns
[ 66 ]
6.	 Within the Add Marketing List to Campaign dialog box, if you check the 
Add the marketing lists to open undistributed campaign activities in 
the current campaign checkbox, then the marketing list is automatically 
associated to all undistributed campaign activities.
Related campaigns
A campaign can be added to other campaigns to help compare effectiveness against 
each other, and also to identify the campaigns as being part of a larger campaign.
Adding related campaigns
To add a related campaign, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Marketing module, and then open the campaign that 
you want to relate another campaign to.
2.	 In the left-hand navigation, click on Related Campaigns.
3.	 On the Campaign Activities List Tools tab of the Campaign ribbon, click on 
Add Existing Campaign.
4.	 Use the lookup dialog box to find and select the campaign, and then  
click on OK.

As you can see, there is quite a lot of complexity when setting up a full-fledged 
marketing campaign. You can track financials and ROI related to a campaign, create 
planning activities to track time and effort in planning a campaign, distribute multiple 
activities for a campaign, and associate products and sales literature to a campaign.
All of the above components can be part of the marketing campaign, but each  
is used depending on the business need. Let's now take a look at the steps to  
create a campaign.
Creating marketing campaigns
To create a campaign in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Marketing module, and then click on Campaigns.
2.	 On the Campaigns ribbon, in the Records group, click on New.
3.	 Enter the following required fields:
°°
Name: Enter a clear, concise name for the campaign
°°
Currency: This field will be populated with the default currency of 
the system, but can be changed
°°
Owner: This field defaults to the name of the user creating the record, 
but can be changed

4.	 The following fields are not required, but are worth noting:
°°
Status Reason: This field defaults to Proposed. The campaign status 
can have the following values:
1.	 Proposed
2.	 Ready to Launch
3.	 Launched
4.	 Completed
5.	 Canceled
6.	 Suspended
°°
Expected Response (%): The expected percentage of responses for 
the campaign. This can be useful to track actual versus estimated 
response rates for a campaign.
°°
Price List: If a price list is entered, then any opportunities generated 
from this campaign will inherit this price list.
°°
Proposed Begin Date: The date on which the owner of the campaign 
is proposing to begin the campaign.
°°
Proposed End Date: The date on which marketing is proposing the 
campaign will end.
°°
Actual Begin Date: The date the campaign actually started.
°°
Actual End Date: The date the campaign actually ended.
°°
Financials section: Enter any relevant financial information that you 
want to track. A more in-depth explanation of campaign financial 
information can be found in the next section.

Campaign financial metrics
Financial metrics can be tracked on a campaign to assist in tracking ROI. The 
campaign costs are stored on the campaign activities, and the campaign stores 
budgetary information and the sum of all costs of the activities.
An explanation of the fields is as follows:
•	
Total Cost of Campaign Activities is the sum of the costs entered on all of 
the campaign activities
•	
Miscellaneous Costs are costs not being tracked by the campaign activities
•	
Total Cost of the Campaign = Total Cost of Campaign Activities + 
Miscellaneous Costs

•	
Estimated Revenue is the revenue expected to be generated by the campaign
•	
Budget Allocated is the amount of money allocated for the campaign
•	
Expected ROI is the expected return on investment for  
this campaign
•	
Actual ROI is the actual return on investment for this campaign
Creating and working with quick campaigns
A quick campaign can be defined as a communication method that creates a 
single campaign activity for distribution to members of a marketing list. A regular 
campaign is different in that it supports end-to-end marketing programs that have 
multiple activities.
Quick campaigns can be created by using a wizard in Dynamics CRM 2011. There 
are several key differences between a campaign and quick campaign:
•	
You cannot create any planning activities for a quick campaign
•	
You can only distribute one activity type with a quick campaign
•	
You cannot associate products or sales literature to a quick campaign
Quick campaigns are meant for low-weight, quick results with minimal time spent 
setting them up. The core records that comprise a quick campaign can be selected by 
using three methods:
•	
Using existing marketing lists in the marketing lists grid; you can select a list 
and then click on the Create Quick Campaign button. This will launch the 
quick campaign wizard.
•	
Use advanced find to search for core records such as leads, accounts, or 
contacts and then, when the results are displayed, click on the Quick 
Campaign button.
•	
In any view of leads, accounts, or contacts, you can select one or more core 
records and then click on the Quick Campaign button.
For the purposes of this example, let's walk through an example of how to create a 
quick campaign by using a marketing list.

Chapter 3
[ 71 ]
Creating quick campaigns
To create a quick campaign from a marketing list, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Marketing module, and then click on  
Marketing Lists.
2.	 Select a marketing list from which to generate a quick campaign. You  
can only select one marketing list at a time for which to run the quick 
campaign wizard.
3.	 On the Marketing List ribbon bar, in the Actions group, click on the Create 
Quick Campaign button.
4.	 Click on Next.
5.	 Enter a clear, concise name for the quick campaign, and then click on Next.
6.	 Select the Activity Type for the campaign.
7.	 Choose how to assign these activities—whether they should be assigned to 
you, to the owners of the records selected in the marketing list, or to another 
user or team.
8.	 Select the Add the created activities to a queue checkbox if you'd like the 
activities to be added to a particular queue.

Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns
[ 72 ]
9.	 Select the Mark e-mail messages to be sent and close corresponding e-mail 
activities. checkbox to automatically send e-mails if they are being created.
10.	 Click on Next.
11.	 Fill out the form depending on the activity type chosen.
12.	 Click on Next, and then review the information about the quick campaign. 
When satisfied, click on Create.
The steps to create a quick campaign are drastically reduced compared to the normal 
full-blown marketing campaign. While that can be advantageous from a cost and 
time savings perspective, it's important to know the limitations of quick campaigns.

Chapter 3
[ 73 ]
Scope of a quick campaign
It is valuable to understand the scope of a quick campaign. Quick campaigns:
•	
Can distribute only one type of activity
•	
Cannot track financial information
•	
Have no built-in reports
•	
Cannot create planning activities
•	
Cannot associate target products or pricelists
•	
Cannot be saved as or created from a template
Managing campaigns
Once you have created a campaign, set up the planning activities and campaign 
activities, added optional products and sales literature, associated one more 
marketing lists and potentially other related campaigns, it's time to distribute  
the campaign activities.
Distributing campaign activities pushes out activities to each member found on the 
marketing list. Let's review a few concepts that we covered earlier. After creating a 
campaign, you can associate one or more marketing lists. When creating the campaign 
activity, we had to set the Channel field. This Channel field dictates the type of 
activity that will be created for each member on the marketing list(s). For example, if 
the campaign activity channel is phone, then when the campaign is distributed, CRM 
will create a phone call activity for each member on the marketing list(s).
Distributing campaign activities
Use the following steps to distribute campaign activities:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Marketing module, and select Campaigns.
2.	 In the view, select and open the campaign for which you want to  
distribute activities.
3.	 In the left-hand navigation, click on Campaign Activities.
4.	 In the view, select and open the activity that you want to distribute.
5.	 On the Campaign Activity ribbon bar, in the Actions group, click on 
Distribute Campaign Activity.
Doing this will open up a form for the activity type selected when creating 
the campaign activity. For example, if the campaign activity type was a 
phone call, then a phone call activity form will appear.

Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns
[ 74 ]
6.	 Click on Distribute.
7.	 In this example, a phone call activity is being distributed. The dialog asks 
you how ownership should be set. You have the following options:
°°
The owners of the records in the target marketing lists: Whoever 
owns the leads, accounts, or contacts on the targeted marketing lists 
will own the activity that is being distributed
°°
I will own the new Phone Calls: The currently logged-in user will 
own the activities
°°
Assign to another user or team
°°
There is an option to assign this activity to a queue (queues are 
explored when we talk about the CRM Service module in Chapter 7, 
Managing Service Management Applications)

Chapter 3
[ 75 ]
°°
If the activity is an e-mail, you have the option to automatically send 
the e-mail when these steps are completed
8.	 Click on OK.
When the campaign activity is distributed, Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 will create 
an activity for each member of the marketing list(s). However, the system is smart 
enough to take into account the customer preferences set by an organization.
Customer preferences are fields on the account or contact which 
store communication preferences for a customer. For example, 
if a contact does not wish to have e-mails sent to him/her, then 
the system can store that preference on the contact record.
With these steps, your organization has now set up a marketing campaign and 
distributed its activities. It's now time to learn how to track responses to this campaign.
Campaign responses
As stated earlier, campaign responses allow an organization to measure the success 
of a campaign by tracking responses to the campaign. Once campaign activities 
are distributed, and a customer responds to one or more of these activities, these 
responses can be tracked by using campaign responses. There's a few ways in which 
responses can be created:
•	
Manually create a campaign response. An example of this is if a mailing 
campaign was initiated with reply-back cards. If someone is interested, they 
send a reply card back to an organization and someone within the company 
can record that as a response.
•	
Convert a distributed campaign activity into a campaign response.
•	
If e-mail tracking is enabled, an e-mail campaign was initiated. If an 
individual responds to that e-mail, a response can be automatically created.
•	
Imported using the Data Import Wizard in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011.
Creating a campaign response manually
To create a campaign response manually, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Marketing module, and click on Campaigns.
2.	 In the view, select and open the campaign to add a response to.
3.	 In the left-hand navigation, click on Campaign Responses.

Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns
[ 76 ]
4.	 On the List Tools Campaign Responses ribbon, in the Records group, click 
on Add New Campaign Response.
5.	 Enter the following required fields:
°°
Parent Campaign: This will auto-populate with the campaign that 
the response is being created from
°°
Subject: Enter a clear, concise name for the campaign response
°°
Owner: This will auto-populate with the user currently logged in,  
but can be changed
6.	 Click on Save and Close.
Another method to create a campaign response is to promote an activity that was 
distributed from a campaign to being a response.
Converting an activity to a campaign response
In order for an activity to be promoted to a campaign response, the activity must 
be distributed from a campaign. To promote an activity to a campaign response, 
perform the following steps:

5.	 Click on Close Campaign Response.
6.	 Select the status that you wish to close the response with.
7.	 Click on Save and Close.
As you can see, there can be a large amount of effort in managing marketing 
campaigns. Many times, an organization may run very similar campaigns. In these 
cases, campaign templates can be used to reduce the time it takes to enter the data 
for a campaign.
Campaign templates
You can create a campaign, add campaign related records, and then save it as a 
template for use later. Campaign templates can have the following related entities:
•	
Marketing lists
•	
Targeted products
•	
Sales literature
•	
Planning activities
•	
Campaign activities
Campaign templates can be created manually or from an existing campaign.

Campaigns versus quick campaigns
The process for setting up campaigns can vary depending on the type of campaign 
(campaign versus quick campaign), and also what type of records a user wants to 
associate to a campaign (products, sales literature, planning activities, and so on).

With marketing efforts under way, the next feature that Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
2011 offers is analysis of the data and responses. Any good analysis of campaign 
and/or marketing data is completely contingent on good data. There's an old adage, 
"trash in, trash out," so it's critical that all information is being captured about the 
campaign, and that the responses are accurately recorded.
Reporting and analysis
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 is not only a robust solution to record and capture 
data, but it provides several tools to analyze the data captured. These tools include:
•	
Views
•	
Charts
•	
Advanced find
•	
Export to Excel
•	
Dashboards
•	
Built-in reports
•	
Custom reports
Goals can also be considered a tool of CRM that allows users to analyze data, but 
we'll cover that when we cover sales. For this chapter, let us take a closer look at the 
standard tools.
Views
Every entity in Dynamics CRM 2011 has pre-built views. These views display certain 
columns of data. Columns can be added or removed from these views to display 
more or less information. An example of a view is "My Campaigns", which is a list of 
campaigns where the owner is the currently logged in user.
Charts
Accessing charts is straightforward as the charts show up on the right-hand side of  
a view. Charts are a graphical representation of records in a view. In any view,  
the chart selection is collapsed, by default. If you move the mouse over to the  
right-hand side, and expand the chart section, the out of the box charts for each 
entity are displayed.

Chapter 3
[ 83 ]
There are two types of charts:
•	
Personal chart: This is created by a user and can only be seen by the creator 
unless it is shared with other users
•	
System chart: This can be created by a user or can be pre-built, but it is 
visible to all users
The interaction with the charts and views are contextual as well, much like the 
Dynamics CRM 2011 ribbon bar. When a chart is expanded, and a specific area is 
selected on the chart, the view automatically filters to show the results based on the 
selection of the chart. This ability provides a rich user experience and a quick way to 
analyze data.
Advanced find
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 allows you to perform queries that are more complex 
than simply searching on views. These searches can search on the columns of a 
particular entity and related entities as well. Advanced finds can be saved for later 
use, and can also shared with other users and teams.
Creating an advanced find
To create an advanced find, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Click on Advanced Find on the ribbon bar:
3.	 In the Look for drop down field, select the entity that you want to perform  
a search on.
4.	 Click on Details to enable the ability to add more filters.
5.	 Add the necessary search parameters.

Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns
[ 84 ]
6.	 Click on Results.
7.	 Once you are satisfied with the results, click on Save or Save As to 
save this advanced find as a personal view.
An advanced find saved for later use is called a personal view. Personal views 
cannot be exported to different environments. If you want this view to be exported  
to other CRM implementations, you must create a public view.
Once an advanced find is created or you use an out of the box CRM view, the results 
can be exported to Excel for analysis.
Export to Excel
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 allows you to export the results of a view to 
Microsoft Excel. To export results to Excel for a view or advanced find, click on 
Export to Excel on the ribbon bar.

Chapter 3
[ 85 ]
The options are described as follows:
•	
Static worksheet with records from this page: Only records on the current 
page are exported into a static Microsoft Excel worksheet. The columns 
exported will be the columns in the view.
•	
Static worksheet with records from all pages in the current view: All 
records on all pages in the current view are exported to a static Microsoft 
Excel worksheet.
•	
Dynamic PivotTable: The results are exported into a Microsoft Excel 
worksheet into a pivot table with an active connection to Dynamics CRM 
2011. Selecting this option allows users to re-open the Excel spreadsheet at a 
later time and the data will be refreshed automatically.
•	
Dynamic worksheet: The results are exported into a Microsoft Excel 
worksheet with an active connection to Dynamics CRM 2011. Selecting this 
option allows users to re-open the Excel spreadsheet at a later time and the 
data will be refreshed automatically.
•	
If the checkbox for Make this data available for re-importing by including 
required column headings is selected, then CRM will export all columns in 
the current view plus any additional required fields needed for re-import, 
including a hidden column with the unique ID of each record.
Dashboards
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 introduces the concept of dashboards. A dashboard 
is a collection of charts or graphs all on one page. Dashboards allow users to see the 
most important data all at once to enable organizations to make important business 
decisions easier. Similar to views and charts, Dynamics CRM comes with pre-built 
dashboards, and dashboards can be created by users as well. They can be categorized 
into two types:
•	
Personal dashboard: It can be created by any user and is visible only to the 
user that created it, unless they share the dashboard
•	
System dashboard: It can be created by a user, but Dynamics CRM comes 
with several pre-built ones, and they are visible to all users

Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns
[ 86 ]
Marketing dashboards
Speaking of pre-built dashboards, Dynamics CRM 2011 comes with a marketing 
dashboard that contains the following:
•	
Campaigns by type
•	
A comparison of budgeted versus actual costs for a campaign
•	
Leads by source campaign
•	
Revenue generated by campaigns
Another highlight of dashboards is that the data reflected is the most recent and does 
not have issues of stale data. That is, when data is updated in CRM, the results are 
reflected in the dashboards (if the user is viewing a dashboard, he/she may have to 
refresh the dashboard to see the latest results).
Creating a personal dashboard
To create a personal dashboard, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on Workplace, and then click on Dashboards in the  
left-hand navigation.
2.	 On the CRM ribbon bar, in the Dashboards tab, click on New.
3.	 In the Dashboards Layout dialog, select the appropriate layout, such as 
3-Column Regular Dashboard or 2-Column Regular Dashboard.

Chapter 3
[ 87 ]
4.	 Click on Create.
5.	 Enter a name for the dashboard.
6.	 On the Dashboard tab, in the Insert Image section, click on Chart.
7.	 Select the entity containing the data for the chart in the Record Type 
drop-down list.
8.	 Select the appropriate view in the View drop-down list.
9.	 Select the chart in the Chart drop-down list.
10.	 Click on OK.
11.	 Repeat steps 5 to 10 for each section.
When a personal dashboard is created, only the user that created it can see the 
dashboard, unless the user specifically shares it. Users can also create a public chart 
which can be available for the entire organization and can be exported as part of  
a solution.

System reports
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 has several canned or built-in marketing reports to 
help an organization analyze its marketing efforts:
•	
Campaign activity status
•	
Campaign comparison
•	
Campaign performance
•	
Lead source effectiveness
A closer look at each of these reports can help you determine which to use when 
measuring the effectiveness of an organization's marketing tactics.
Campaign activity status
This report displays a summary for each campaign activity, including the parent 
campaign's details. By default, this report displays only campaigns with activities or 
notes that were created within the dates specified by the person running the report.
Campaign comparison
This report compares two campaigns based on parameters such as cost effectiveness 
and number of responses. When running the report, the user must select the 
campaigns to compare.
Campaign performance
This report tracks the status and progress of campaigns, including all of the 
campaign dates, targets, definitions, responses, and financial returns. By default,  
this report displays only campaigns modified in the last 30 days, but this can be 
changed by the user.
Lead source effectiveness
This report displays all leads and compares how effective your lead sources are at 
creating opportunities. The report lists the percentage of qualified leads, and leads 
that generate revenue for each lead category.
Running marketing reports
To run any of the reports described above, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Workplace module, and then click on Reports in the 
left-hand navigation.
2.	 Locate the report that you want to run in the list, and double-click on it to run 
the report.

Chapter 3
[ 89 ]
3.	 If necessary, set the appropriate search criteria and filters.
4.	 Click on Run Report.
Report wizard
While Dynamics CRM offers many canned reports that are powerful, often 
organizations may want to create custom reports tailored to their needs. To enable 
this, you can use the report wizard. The report wizard allows the following features:
•	
Grouping and aggregation of data, such as grouping campaigns by campaign 
type. For example, if several campaigns are launched around a new product 
line, while others are launched around new services offered, these can be 
grouped in a custom report.
•	
Filtering allows report data to be pared down.
•	
Graphs and charts can be used to represent data visually.
•	
Drilldown reports can be added. This is where rows of data can be drilled 
down on, in order to retrieve more specific data.
Creating reports
To create a custom report, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Workplace module, and then click on Reports on the  
left-hand navigation.
2.	 Click on New.
3.	 In the Report dialog box, click on the Report Wizard button.
4.	 Click on New.
5.	 Specify a clear and concise Report Name.

Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns
[ 90 ]
6.	 Select Primary Entity Type.
7.	 Click on Next.
8.	 In the Report Filtering Criteria section, click on Clear.
9.	 Enter the filtering criteria or parameters for the report.
10.	 Click on Next.
11.	 Add any groupings and columns that you want to display.
12.	 Click on OK.
13.	 Select a report format (chart, table, or graph).
14.	 Click on Next.
15.	 Click on Finish.
The report created can now be run by the individual that created the report. This 
means that the report cannot be seen by anyone else in the organization unless  
they explicitly share the report or change the report properties called Viewable By  
to Organization.
In addition to creating reports, you can schedule reports to run at a specific time so 
that you have a snapshot at a specific moment in time.
The ability to schedule reports is only available for on-premise 
instances and is not available for CRM online.
Snapshot reports
A report snapshot captures the report query results at a specific point in time. Report 
snapshots can be created in two ways:
•	
On-demand
•	
Scheduled

Chapter 3
[ 91 ]
When snapshot reports are created on-demand, the query is run against the latest data 
in the system and a snapshot is created and then stored on the report server. When 
a report is scheduled, the query is run on a schedule and then the data and layout is 
saved to the report server. To schedule a report, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Workplace module, and then click on Reports.
2.	 Find and select the report that you wish to schedule.
3.	 In the Reports ribbon, select Schedule Reports.
4.	 In the Report Scheduling Wizard, select the type of snapshot that you wish 
to create. In this case, select On a schedule, to set up a scheduled report.
5.	 Click on Next.

Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns
[ 92 ]
6.	 Select the frequency with which to generate the report.
7.	 Click on Next.
8.	 Select Start Date and End Date if necessary.
9.	 Click on Next.
10.	 If the report has parameters, set them in this dialog.
11.	 Click on Next.
12.	 Review the scheduling summary, and then click on Create.
When the report is run, a snapshot is created with a date and timestamp. For 
example, if you were to schedule the Campaign Activity Status report, when  
the report is scheduled and run, a new report will be created and accessible in  
the reports grid view. The new report will have a name such as "Campaign Activity  
Status – Scheduled Snapshots 1_1_2013."

Summary
Marketing lists can be used to group accounts, contacts, or leads, and can be used as 
part of a marketing campaign. There are two different marketing list types: static and 
dynamic. Members are added, removed, and updated manually in a static marketing 
list. With a dynamic marketing list, members are added via an advanced find query, 
and then removed or updated automatically. Dynamic marketing lists can also be 
copied to create a static one. You can manage marketing lists in other ways as well. 
You can copy members from one or more marketing lists (whether dynamic or static), 
but you can only copy members to a static list. Deleting or deactivating a marketing 
list does not remove the accounts, contacts, or leads that were part of that list from the 
system. Marketing lists are also an integral part of marketing campaigns.
A marketing campaign represents an organization's marketing plans, activities, and 
lists over a period of time. There are several related entities that can be associated to 
a campaign: planning activities, campaign activities, campaign responses, targeted 
products, sales literature, marketing lists, and related campaigns. There is quite a 
bit of effort around campaigns, and what if an organization would like to spin up a 
campaign quickly, with very little effort/time? Dynamics CRM comes to the rescue 
once again with quick campaigns. Using the quick campaign wizard, users can 
create simple campaigns that have one marketing list and that distribute one type 
of activity. Both types of campaigns can effectively promote your organization's 
products and services, and can help you to align your marketing department's goals 
with any strategic initiative that your organization is looking to undertake.

Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns
[ 96 ]
One of the first actions to take when you launch a campaign is to distribute the 
campaign activities. Distributing campaign activities pushes out activities to each 
member found on the marketing list. Once campaign activities are distributed, and 
a customer responds to one or more activities, these responses can be tracked using 
campaign responses. Campaign responses can be created manually, converted from 
a distributed campaign activity, or imported using the data import wizard. If e-mail 
tracking is enabled, an e-mail campaign was initiated, and an individual responds to 
that e-mail, a response can be automatically created. Lastly, campaign responses can 
be closed with a status of closed or canceled.
CRM is not only a robust solution for recording and capturing data, but it provides 
several tools to analyze the data captured. These tools include: views, charts, 
advanced find, export to Excel, dashboards, built-in reports, custom reports. Views 
display columns of data, while charts graphically represent the data found in a view. 
Advanced find is a tool that allows you to perform queries that are more complex 
than searching on views. Export to Excel is a function that exports the results of 
a view to Microsoft Excel. Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 introduces the concept 
of a dashboard, which is a collection of charts or graphs all on one page. Among 
the several pre-built dashboards available in CRM, a marketing dashboard exists, 
which contains the following charts: campaigns by type, a comparison of campaign 
budgeted versus actual costs, leads by source campaign, and revenue generated  
by campaigns.
In the next chapter, we introduce you to the sales module of Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM 2011. The topics covered include creating and managing leads, accounts, 
contacts, opportunities, competitors, and goals. Lastly, we will dive into sales 
reporting and analysis.

Creating and managing leads
Let us take a look at a business scenario relating to leads.
Business scenarios
Race2Win Insurance Company set up a booth at a trade show to market to potential 
customers. The marketing team present at the show took down information 
about each person that visited the booth and expressed interest in one or more of 
Race2Win's insurance products or services. This information included the visitor's 
name, address, phone numbers, and information about the company they worked for.
The trade show has ended, and as part of Race2Win's marketing strategy, they will 
now enter the information collected into their Dynamics CRM system as leads. The 
people that showed interest are all potential customers.

Managing Sales Applications
[ 98 ]
The marketing team can now pass these leads on to the various inside sales people 
to make phone calls following up on the interest expressed at the trade show. As 
mentioned in Chapter 2, Activities and Notes, these phone calls can be tracked as 
activities in order to help track all interactions with potential customers.
Creating leads
To create a lead, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Sales module, and then click on Leads.
2.	 On the Leads ribbon bar, in the Records group, click on New.
3.	 Enter the following required fields (some fields are not for input, but are 
listed here for explanation):
i.	
Topic: Enter a clear and concise description of the topic that the 
lead is interested in
ii.	 Last Name
iii.	 Company Name

Chapter 4
[ 99 ]
iv.	 Owner: Defaults to the user creating the record, but can  
be changed.
4.	 The following fields are not required, but are worth mentioning:
i.	
Preferred: Preferred method of communication to the lead. 
Possible values are Any, E-mail, Phone, Fax, and Mail.
ii.	 Select the Marketing preferences as follows:
a.	 E-mail: Selecting Allow allows all e-mail, including e-mail-related 
to campaign activities, to be sent to the lead. Selecting Do Not 
Allow does not allow e-mails to be sent to this lead.
b.	 Phone
c.	 Mail
d.	 Bulk E-mail: Selecting Allow allows e-mail as part of a bulk 
e-mail process, including bulk e-mail related to campaign 
activities, to be sent. Selecting Do Not Allow does not allow  
bulk e-mails to be sent to this lead.
e.	 Fax

Managing Sales Applications
[ 100 ]
iii.	 Last Campaign Date: Date on which the lead was last involved 
in a campaign. This is a read-only field that is set automatically 
when any marketing communication is sent to the addresses for 
the record.
iv.	 Marketing Material: If you select Send, marketing material  
(such as e-mails or letters) that corresponds to campaigns 
is allowed to be sent. If you select Do Not Send, marketing 
materials are not sent, and activities related to the sending of 
marketing materials cannot be created for the record.
v.	 Currency: Set to the system default value, but can be changed.
5.	 Click on Save.
A lead record can also be created by converting an e-mail activity record.
Creating a lead from an e-mail
A business example would be if someone is browsing the corporate website of 
Race2Win Insurance company and wants to get more information about a certain 
product. If that user sends an e-mail expressing interest to someone within the 
organization, Race2Win would want to add that person in as a lead with a lead 
source set to Web. For rapid entry of a lead, CRM allows an e-mail to be converted 
into a lead by using the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Workplace module, and then click on Activities.
2.	 Find and open the e-mail that you wish to convert.
3.	 On the Lead ribbon bar, in the Covert Activity group, click on To Lead.
4.	 In the Convert E-mail to Lead dialog box, enter the following information:
°°
First Name
°°
Last Name
°°
Company

Chapter 4
[ 101 ]
°°
E-mail Address
5.	 Click on OK.
Lead status
A lead record can have various statuses and status reasons that help to define the 
state that the record is in. For each status, there are various status reasons. According 
to MSDN, the various statuses are displayed in the following table:
Once leads are created, most organization start a lead qualification process.

Managing Sales Applications
[ 102 ]
Managing leads
Lead qualification is a process in which an organization determines if a company 
or individual is displaying the intent, and has the ability to make a purchase within 
a certain timeframe. In Dynamics CRM, qualifying a lead changes the status of the 
lead, but it also requires the creation of an account, contact, or opportunity (at least 
one must be created). This is because in most organizations, once a lead is qualified, 
the company or individual is ready to purchase a product or service. If they're ready 
to purchase a product or service, they can be managed like a customer (account or 
contact) and begin to start having sales opportunities. Typically, the qualification 
process varies between organizations and is dependent on various business rules. An 
example of these business rules are demonstrated in the following business scenario.

A salesperson at Race2Win Insurance Company has a lead on selling one of their 
insurance products to an individual. This salesperson needs to find out if this 
individual is truly interested, and to do so, the salesperson will follow the lead 
qualification process set forth by Race2Win.
Race2Win is using the BANT method, which stands for Budget, Authority, Need, 
and Timeframe. This is not covered in the certification exam, but is being used as an 
example of a process an organization might use to qualify a lead. The salesperson 
analyzes the lead to see if the lead has the budget to purchase the product, the 
authority to make the buying decision, whether they truly have the need for the 
product, and finally if they're looking to buy within a given timeframe.
Using this process has helped this salesperson determine that the lead he/she is 
working on is ready to be qualified.
Qualifying or disqualifying a lead
To qualify a lead, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM and go to the Marketing module.
2.	 Find and open the lead that you wish to qualify.

Chapter 4
[ 103 ]
3.	 In the Lead ribbon bar in the Actions group, click on Qualify.
 
4.	 In the convert lead dialog, you can choose whether to qualify and convert a 
lead into an account, contact, and/or opportunity record, or disqualify the lead.
5.	 If you choose to qualify a lead, the lead will be deactivated with a status of 
Qualified. Furthermore, an account, contact, or opportunity must be created 
(at least one of them must be chosen, but more than one can be selected). If 
only an opportunity is chosen to be created from a lead, a potential customer 
(either an account or a contact) must be selected. If an account and/or 
contact are both selected with an opportunity, the potential customer for 
an opportunity becomes the account or contact. If an account and contact is 
selected with an opportunity, the potential customer becomes the account. 
The potential customer is an attribute of the opportunity record.
6.	 If you choose to disqualify the lead, you will have to choose from a list of 
statuses—Lost, Cannot Contact, No Longer Interested, or Canceled. When a 
lead is disqualified, the record becomes deactivated.

Assigning leads
Besides creating and qualifying them, leads can be assigned or shared. A business 
example of this would be if, through marketing efforts, Race2Win Insurance 
Company produced a large number of leads. Their marketing department can  
assign leads to various inside sales people so that they can begin the lead 
qualification process.
There are multiple ways in which a lead can be assigned. You can:
•	
Open the lead record and change the owner field
•	
Open the lead and click on the Assign button
•	
Within the lead view, select one or more record(s) and click on the  
Assign button
For this example, let us explore how to assign a lead within the Leads view.
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Sales module, and then click on Leads.
2.	 Find and select the lead(s) that you wish to assign.
3.	 On the Leads ribbon bar, in the Collaborate group, click on the  
Assign button.

Chapter 4
[ 105 ]
4.	 In the Assign dialog box, select whether you wish to assign the record(s) to 
yourself, or to another user or team.
5.	 Click on OK.
Sharing leads
An example of sharing a lead is if an inside sales person needed help in qualifying a 
lead, they can share the record with someone to get their input.
To share a lead, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Sales module, and then click on Leads.
2.	 Find and select the lead(s) that you wish to share.
3.	 On the Lead ribbon, inside the Collaborate group, click on Share:
4.	 In the Common Tasks section, click on Add User/Team.

Managing Sales Applications
[ 106 ]
5.	 A lookup dialog appears allowing you to select one or more user(s)  
or team(s).
6.	 Click on Add to add the user(s) or team(s) to the lookup dialog box.
7.	 Click on OK to add the user(s) or team(s) to the sharing dialog box.
8.	 Within the sharing dialog box, select which permissions you want to grant  
to the users. You can choose from Read, Write, Delete, Append, Assign,  
and Share.
9.	 Click on OK.
Activating a lead
When a lead is disqualified, it becomes inactive. Sometimes, that company or 
individual may express interest again, and instead of creating a new lead, you may 
choose to reactivate the lead. To activate a lead, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM and go to the Marketing module.
2.	 Find the lead that you wish to reactivate. If the lead is inactive, it may show 
up in a different view, such as Closed Leads.
3.	 You have two options here. The first option is to select the lead from the 
view, and on the Leads ribbon bar, in the Records group, click on Activate.

Chapter 4
[ 107 ]
4.	 The second option is to open the record and, on the Lead ribbon bar in the 
Actions group, click on Reactivate Lead.
5.	 For either option, click on OK.
Creating and managing accounts and 
contacts
Accounts and contacts are collectively known as customers in CRM. Understanding 
how to create and manage these customers in CRM is essential, and necessary before 
tracking sales.
Accounts
The account entity is one of the central components of a CRM system and is essential 
in managing customers that are organizations. Opportunities, sales, and service-
related items for an organization can all be tracked by using the account entity.
According to MSDN, the account entity can be a parent to almost any other entity, 
including another account. An account can only have one parent account, but can 
have multiple child accounts and/or child contacts.
Business scenarios
An inside sales representative at Race2Win Insurance Company went through 
a qualification process on a lead. Using their company's business rules, the sales 
representative qualified the lead and converted it to an account.
The inside sales representative has now handed the account over to a sales 
representative that manages accounts in that organization's sales territory. The sales 
representative can begin collecting demographic and industry information in order 
to gather more insight into the organization to which they are trying to sell to.

Managing Sales Applications
[ 108 ]
Methods to create accounts
An account can be created in any of the following ways:
•	
Using the CRM Data Import Wizard. The Data Import Wizard is beyond the 
scope of the certification exam, and thus will not be covered in this book.
•	
In the Account view, in the Records group, click on the New button.
•	
On the ribbon bar, in the File tab, click on New Record, and then  
select Account.

Chapter 4
[ 109 ]
•	
In the Account Lookup dialog, click on New. A lookup to the account entity 
appears on the account form itself as the parent account field.
Creating accounts
An account can be created in different ways, from converting a lead into an account, 
to creating one manually. For this scenario, we'll cover how to create an account 
manually. To create an account manually, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Sales module, and then click on Accounts.

Managing Sales Applications
[ 110 ]
2.	 In the Accounts ribbon bar, in the Records group, click on the New button.
3.	 Enter the following required fields:
i.	
Account Name: Enter a clear, concise name for the account.
ii.	 Owner: This is a required field; however it's pre-populated with 
the user creating the record.
The following screenshot shows the shipping and Details section of the 
account form:

The following screenshot shows the industry and marketing information of 
the account form:

Contacts
The contact entity is also one of the central components of a CRM system and is 
essential in managing customers that are individuals. Opportunities, sales, and 
service-related items for an individual can all be tracked by using the contact entity.
According to MSDN, the contact entity can be a parent to every other entity except 
accounts and contacts, and a contact can have only one account as its parent.
Business scenarios
A sales representative at Race2Win Insurance Company has successfully sold some 
products to an account that they are managing. Throughout the selling process, 
the sales representative met key players within the organization. Race2Win use 
Dynamics CRM to track these individuals as contacts for the organization.

Managing Sales Applications
[ 112 ]
Within the contact record, the sales representative tracks information such as their role 
within the organization, and personal information such phone numbers, birthday, 
and anniversary. This allows the sales representative to keep in touch with these 
individuals and helps them to build meaningful relationships. The sales representative 
is hoping that these interactions can help bring him/her future opportunities.
Creating contacts
Contacts can be created in multiple ways, similar to how the account can be created. 
An additional way in which a contact can be created is within the contact's associated 
view on an account.
When a contact is added via an associated view, the relationship 
between the contact and the account is automatically set. That 
is, the parent customer field on the contact is set.
For the purpose of this book, we'll focus on creating a contact by going to the contact 
view. To create a contact via the contact view, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Sales module, and then click on Contacts.
2.	 In the Contacts ribbon bar, in the Records group, click on the New button.

Chapter 4
[ 113 ]
3.	 Enter the following required fields:
i.	
Last Name
ii.	 Parent Customer: This is not a required field, but it is worth 
noting that a contact can have an account or a contact as a parent.
iii.	 Owner
The following screenshot shows the rest of the contact form.
4.	 Click on Save.
Account and contact records can be shared, assigned, deactivated, activated,  
and merged.
Managing accounts and contacts
Like many entities in CRM, accounts and contacts can be shared with user(s) or 
team(s). They can also be assigned to a user or team. The process for sharing and 
assigning accounts and contacts is the same as outlined earlier in this chapter, in the 
Assigning leads and Sharing leads sections.

Managing Sales Applications
[ 114 ]
An account or contact can be deactivated at any time as well. For example, if one of 
Race2Win Insurance Company's accounts decides to do business elsewhere, they can 
choose to deactivate the account in case the client ever decides to do business with 
Race2Win again. To activate an account or contact, follow the steps outlined earlier 
in this chapter, in the Activating a lead section.
Accounts and contacts have an added functionality that comes in handy, especially 
when CRM may become full of duplicate accounts and/or contact records. To  
help alleviate some of the data cleanup, CRM allows the merging of records of  
these types. 
Merging accounts and contacts
Many CRM systems experience cases of duplicate accounts or contacts. This can be 
from poor data management strategies, incorrect data entry, or even in a new system 
after a data migration from another system. Whatever the case, the ability to merge 
duplicate records of the same type can help save time.
When two records are merged, one is considered the master record, and the other a 
duplicate record. To merge two records (let us use two accounts for this scenario), 
follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on Sales, and then click on Accounts.
2.	  Find and select the two account records that you want to merge.

Chapter 4
[ 115 ]
3.	 On the Accounts ribbon bar, in the Records group, click on the  
Merge button.
4.	 In the Merge dialog box, choose the master record by selecting the radio 
button next to the appropriate account record.
5.	 Go through each field and determine which value you wish to use in the 
master record. 
6.	 Click on OK.
Based on your selection in the merge dialog box, for each field, CRM will either 
keep the value the master record, or copy the value from the duplicate record to the 
master record. It will then deactivate the duplicate record, and associate all related 
records (activities, opportunities) to the master record. Even though the duplicate 
record is deactivated, a user can reactivate it at any time.
Reactivating a merged record does not re-associate any 
of the related records.

Creating and managing opportunities
An opportunity in CRM represents a potential sale. The sales process varies  
between organizations, which is why Dynamics CRM provides various ways  
to manage opportunities.
Business scenarios
The sales team at Race2Win Insurance Company is focused on efforts to drive 
revenue for the company. They also want to track these efforts, as revenue has 
a direct impact on their salary. CRM allows a sales representative to create and 
track sales opportunities. These opportunities can have activities, which can help a 
representative to track interactions with his/her customers. The sales representative 
can also add products in the form of opportunity products, in order to get more 
accurate pricing and estimated revenue information.
Race2Win Insurance Company has their own selling process in place, and various 
sales stages that are used to track milestones for an opportunity. For example, the 
opportunity may start off in a stage of open, but if a customer experiences serious 
interest, the opportunity may move to the next stage of alignment which then tells 
the sales person to take a different course of action to move it to the next stage, and 
so on. Tracking of the stages is another feature of opportunities in CRM.
Race2Win would also like the ability to track all opportunities in the system, and be 
able to manage their pipeline and perform sales forecasting. The use of opportunities, 
along with reporting and dashboard capabilities, gives an organization the tools to 
do just that.
Creating opportunities
Opportunities can be created in a few different ways by: converting an activity to 
an opportunity, by converting a lead to an opportunity, or by using the CRM user 
interface. Let's explore each of these methods at greater length.
Converting an activity to an opportunity
For this particular example, let's convert a task activity to an opportunity. To convert 
an activity to an opportunity, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Workplace module, and then click on Activities.
2.	 In the view selector, click on Tasks, and then click on All Tasks.

Chapter 4
[ 117 ]
3.	 Find and open the task that you wish to convert.
4.	 In the Task ribbon bar, in the Convert Activity group, click on the To 
Opportunity button.
5.	 In the Convert Task to Opportunity dialog box, enter the  
following information:
i.	
Customer
ii.	 Currency: This is set to the default currency of your Dynamics 
CRM system, but you have the ability to change it here
iii.	 Source Campaign: If you want to link a campaign to the 
opportunity in order to help track ROI, you can do so here

Managing Sales Applications
[ 118 ]
iv.	 Open New Opportunity: Select this checkbox if you want the 
new opportunity to be opened after clicking on OK
v.	 Change the Task status to Completed and close form: Select  
this checkbox if you want the activity to be completed and the 
form closed
vi.	 Record a closed campaign response: Selecting this checkbox 
makes the source campaign field required
6.	 Click on OK.
Converting a lead to an opportunity
To convert a lead to an opportunity, see the steps outlined earlier in this chapter 
under the Managing leads and Qualifying or disqualifying a lead sections.
Creating an opportunity manually
Yet another way to create an opportunity is through the Dynamics CRM UI. To do 
this, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Sales module, and then click on Opportunities.
2.	 In the Opportunities ribbon bar, in the Records group, click on New.

Chapter 4
[ 119 ]
3.	 Complete the following required fields on the form:
i.	
Topic: Enter a clear, concise description of the opportunity
ii.	 Potential Customer: This can be either an account or a contact
iii.	 Currency: This field will auto-populate with the system default 
currency but can be changed
iv.	 Owner
4.	 The following fields are not required, but are worth mentioning:
i.	
Revenue: Choose either System Calculated, in which case if 
opportunity products are added (we'll be discussing this further in 
the chapter), the system will automatically calculate the estimated 
revenue, or choose User Provided, in which case the estimated 
revenue field will become enabled for you to enter an estimate.
ii.	 Est. Revenue: Enter the amount of revenue estimated to be 
recognized, if the opportunity is won.
iii.	 Est. Close Date: Select the estimated date on which the 
opportunity could potentially be closed.
iv.	 Probability %: Enter the probability of closing the opportunity 
(as a percentage).
v.	 Rating: Select from 1 – Hot, 2 – Warm, or 3 – Cold.
vi.	 Price List: If the revenue method chosen is System Provided, 
select a pricelist to be applied to all of the opportunity's products.
vii.	Discount %: If you choose to apply a discount percentage to the 
whole opportunity, you can do so here.

Managing Sales Applications
[ 120 ]
viii.	Discount: If the user chooses to apply a discount amount to the 
whole opportunity they can do so here.
ix.	 Freight Amount: If an additional freight amount is to be added to 
the total amount of the opportunity, it can be added here.
x.	 Total Tax: Total amount of tax applied to each of the products 
tied to the opportunity.  Opportunity products will be discussed 
later in this chapter.
xi.	 Product Totals: Total net price of the products tied to  
the opportunity.
xii.	Pre-Freight Amount: Total price of products tied to the 
opportunity plus all applicable taxes.
xiii.	Total Amount: Total price of products toed to the opportunity, 
including taxes and freight.
xiv.	Status Reason: The opportunity status is explained below.
xv.	Originating Lead: If a lead is converted to an opportunity, this 
lookup will be set to the lead who converted it; otherwise you can 
select the lead that originated this opportunity
xvi.	Source Campaign: If a campaign response is converted to 
an opportunity, this field will be set to the campaign that the 
response came from. Alternatively, you can perform a lookup to 
find the campaign record. Being able to convert an opportunity 
to a campaign enables an organization to track campaign 
effectiveness by measuring how many opportunities came from  
a particular campaign.

Opportunity status
The status of an entity, such as opportunity, defines the overall state of the entity. 
Status reason is a sub-category of status. For each status value, there may be one or 
more status reasons that further explain the status. According to MSDN, the table of 
status to status reason values is as follows:
Opportunity products
Products are discussed in the next chapter, but here we'll give a brief overview of 
how opportunities are tied to products. An opportunity can have multiple products 
associated to it. These are known as opportunity products and allows a user to add 
products to an opportunity that could be potentially sold to the customer.
Opportunity products cannot be added unless a price list has 
been set on the opportunity itself. This is because the price of 
the product for that opportunity must come from the price 
list. Price lists will also be discussed in the next chapter.
Creating opportunity products
To create an opportunity product follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Sales module, and then click on Opportunities.
2.	 Find and open the opportunity to which you wish to add  
opportunity products.
3.	 Within the form, click inside the Line Items sub-grid.
4.	 On the List Tools Opportunity Products ribbon, in the Records group, click 
on Add New Opportunity Product.

Managing Sales Applications
[ 122 ]
A price list must be set on the opportunity before an 
opportunity product can be added.
5.	 Enter the following required fields:
i.	
Select Product: This is not a required field per se, but the field 
is defaulted to Existing. If you choose Existing, the Existing 
Product lookup will be enabled allowing the user to select a 
product from the product catalog. If you choose Write-In, the 
Write-In Product text field will become required, the Pricing 
field will automatically be set to Override Price, and the Price  
Per Unit field will become enabled.
ii.	 Existing Product (if necessary).
iii.	 Write-In Product (if necessary): A write-in product is a way for 
users to add a product to the opportunity that may not exist in the 
product catalog (the product catalog is explained in great detail 
in the next chapter). Also, many organizations may not keep a 
product catalog in CRM, but rather in some back-end accounting 
system like Microsoft Dynamics GP or AX. In these cases, write-in 
products offer flexibility to add a product to the opportunity.
iv.	 Unit: If an existing product is required, the default unit is 
required for selection.

Chapter 4
[ 123 ]
6.	 The following fields are not required, but are important to understand:
i.	
Pricing: If Use Default is selected, on save of the record, the price 
is pulled from the price list and entered on the opportunity. If 
Override Price is selected, all the price fields will become enabled 
for you to enter your own price for the product.
ii.	 Price Per Unit: Inherited from price list or manually entered. 
Note that you are allowed to enter a negative value to reflect a 
credit to the customer.
iii.	 Volume Discount: If the product is taken from the product 
catalog and there is a volume discount for the product, it will  
be automatically applied here.
iv.	 Quantity
v.	 Amount: This is equivalent to (price per unit – volume discount) 
* quantity.
vi.	 Manual Discount
vii.	Tax
viii.	Extended Amount: This is equivalent to Amount – Manual 
Discount + Tax
7.	 Click on Save.
Once an opportunity is created, there are several ways to manage them.
Managing opportunities
Opportunities can be managed like many other entities in CRM by having the ability 
to assign and share opportunity records. The steps to assign or share an opportunity is 
similar to the steps taken in assigning or sharing a lead, mentioned earlier this chapter.
At the end of a sales process, it will be the ultimate goal of the sales group to close 
the opportunity. Ideally, all opportunities would be closed as a "won" opportunity, 
but we all know sometimes life isn't always that easy.
Closing opportunities
When an opportunity is created, its status defaults to Open. When an organization's 
sales cycle is completed, the opportunity can be closed with one of two statuses—Won 
or Lost. By closing an opportunity, the record gets deactivated, and an opportunity 
close activity is created. This entity is used to store information about the revenue, why 
you closed the opportunity, the close date, and competitor information (if applicable). 
It also contains information about the user that created the opportunity.

Managing Sales Applications
[ 124 ]
To close an opportunity, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Sales module, and then click on Opportunities.
2.	 Find and select the opportunity you wish you close.
3.	 On the Opportunities ribbon bar, in the Actions group, click on either Close 
as Won or Close as Lost.
4.	 In the Close Opportunity dialog, enter the following required fields:
i.	
Status: If you click on the Close as Won button, the status will 
be defaulted to Won, otherwise if you click on Close as Lost the 
status will be defaulted to Lost.

Chapter 4
[ 125 ]
ii.	 Status Reason: Based on the selection of Status, the Status 
Reason will change to indicate the reason for the opportunity 
being won or lost. The values for the status and status reason are 
listed in the section about Opportunity Status.
iii.	 Actual Revenue: If the opportunity was won, the actual revenue 
will be defaulted to the estimated revenue from the opportunity, 
with the ability to change the value. If the opportunity is lost, the 
actual revenue will be set to $0.00.
iv.	 Close Date: This will default to the current date.
5.	 Click on OK.
Microsoft Dynamics CRM does allow an opportunity to be re-opened after it 
has been closed. An example of why an organization would want to re-open an 
opportunity is if the opportunity was originally lost and then the customer expresses 
interest in the sale again.
Reopening opportunities
To reopen an opportunity record, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Sales module, and then click on Opportunities.
2.	 Find the opportunity you wish to reopen and open the record.
3.	 On the Opportunity ribbon bar, in the Actions group, click on Reopen 
Opportunity.
4.	 Click on OK.
5.	 In addition to reopening an opportunity, the record, while active, can have 
the totals recalculated at any time.

Managing Sales Applications
[ 126 ]
Recalculating an opportunity
The recalculate opportunity functionality is only available if the revenue field on 
an opportunity is set to System Calculated (as opposed to User Provided). The 
button to recalculate the opportunity is enabled, but if the Revenue field is set to 
User Provided, the record is simply saved and the form is refreshed. As opportunity 
products (or line items as they are displayed on the opportunity form) are added, 
the estimated revenue field on the opportunity is not updated. When the Recalculate 
Opportunity button is clicked, the sum of the total amount on all opportunity 
products are placed in the estimated revenue field in the opportunity.
Multi-currency and opportunities
CRM is a multi-currency system, which means each record with money fields can 
have a different currency. This feature allows an organization to create and manage 
opportunities (among other entities such as quotes, orders, and invoices) with 
multiple currencies.
When CRM is initially installed, a base currency is set for the system and cannot be 
changed. All other currencies are known as transaction currencies. For example, a 
system might have a base currency of United States Dollars (USD), and transaction 
currencies like the British Pound (GBP) and the Indian Rupee (Rs). The exchange rate 
in CRM is the value in the transaction currency equivalent to one base currency. For 
example, the exchange rate in the system might be 45 Rs to 1 USD.
As it relates to opportunities, the currency field defaults to the base currency. 
However, it can be changed as long as there are no opportunity products, quotes, 
orders, or invoices associated to it. If an opportunity does not have any of these 
related records associated to it, then the currency can be changed up until the 
opportunity is closed. If a currency is changed on the opportunity, then a price list 
with the same currency must also be set.
Every record with monetary fields has a field for the transaction currency amount  
and another for the base currency amount. For example, the Estimated Revenue field 
on an opportunity is a money field representing the transaction currency selected for 
the opportunity. There is a corresponding base currency field called Estimate Revenue 
(Base) which uses the defined exchange rate and displays the base currency amount. 
Let's say the base currency of CRM is US dollar (USD), the currency selected on  
the opportunity is Rupees (Rs.), and the exchange rate is set to 1 USD = 45 Rs. If  
the Estimated Revenue amount is 45 Rs, then the Estimated Revenue (Base) amount  
is 1 USD.

Chapter 4
[ 127 ]
This is important to note in case an opportunity has been created with a currency 
different than that of the base system currency. If the exchange rate is changed, then 
opportunities created before the change will not be updated, and the base currency 
amounts will not be changed to reflect the new exchange rate. The reason for this is 
that CRM preserves the exchange rate at the time the opportunity was created, so 
fluctuations in rates won't affect the organization or customer unfairly.
Viewing opportunities
There are a number of out of the box views that enable an organization to 
intelligently search for data. Samples of the views available for opportunities are:
•	
Closed Opportunities: Lists all opportunities that are closed, with a status of 
either won or lost.
•	
Closed Opportunities in Current Fiscal Year: Lists all opportunities that 
were closed in the current fiscal year, either with a status of won or lost.
•	
My Closed Opportunities: Lists all closed opportunities owned by the 
current logged in user.
•	
My Closed Opportunities in Current Fiscal Year: Lists all opportunities 
closed in the current fiscal year and that are owned by the current logged  
in user.
•	
Open Opportunities: Lists all open opportunities.
•	
Won Opportunities: Lists all closed opportunities with a status of won.
•	
Lost Opportunities: Lists all closed opportunities with a status of lost.
Creating competitors
To create a competitor, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Sales module, and then click on Competitors.

i.	
Ticker Symbol: This is an abbreviation used to uniquely identify 
a publicly traded company. For example, the ticker symbol for 
Microsoft is MSFT.
ii.	 Key Product: A product that the competitor is known for, 
potentially a product that differentiates themselves from  
your organization.
iii.	 Strength: Key strengths to note about your competitor.

Tracking competition on an opportunity can help sales people engage their 
customers more effectively throughout the selling process. As opportunities are 
created and managed, it's essential that sales people and their managers can track 
progress of an individual's or team's goals.
Creating and managing goals
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 enables an organization to track goals for an 
individual or a team. These goals can be rolled up by a manager to see how a  
certain group of individuals is progressing.
Business scenarios
Race2Win Insurance Company's sales teams have been working their opportunities 
and progressing them through the various sales stages. Each sales person within the 
company has a sales quota to meet by the end of the year. Each fiscal quarter, the 
sales manager meets with each member of the sales team to review progress towards 
the quota. One of the key metrics the sales managers follow is the amount  
of actual revenue generated from won (closed) opportunities.
Race2Win was able to accomplish this by using a feature called goals. First, a  
goal metric was created to specify whether to measure a count or an amount of 
something. Next, a rollup field on the goal metric was created to apply the metric  
on a specific field. In this case, Race2Win wanted to track the total amount (metric)  
of actual revenue of an opportunity that is closed as won (rollup field). Next, a  
rollup query was created to search for opportunity records to measure the goals 
against. Lastly, a goal was created to tie the metric and rollup query to a specific 
target and time period.
Setting up goals can be tricky, so let us take a look at each step in order.

The first step in the process of setting up a goal is to create a goal metric. Goal 
metrics are a way to measure the goal and include some sort of metric for a specific 
entity. For example, with marketing, a goal metric could be a count of the number of 
campaign responses received. In this case the metric is the actual count of something, 
and the count is applied to the campaign response entity. Another example is the 
total actual revenue of all won (closed) opportunities.
Creating a goal metric
To create a goal metric, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Sales Module, and then click on Goal Metrics.
2.	 On the Goal Metrics ribbon bar, in the Records group, click on New.
3.	 Complete the following fields:
i.	
Name: Enter a clear, concise name for the goal metric.
ii.	 Metric Type: Choose Count or Amount. Count should be used 
when you want to count the number of records selected by the goal 
metric. Amount should be used when you want to sum the amount 
of a selected field within the records selected by the goal metric.
iii.	 Amount Data Type: If the metric type is set to Amount, this  
field will be enabled giving the user choices of Money, Decimal,  
or Integer.
4.	 The Track Stretch Target field is not required, but if this checkbox is selected, 
then on the goal record there will be two target fields shown. If not selected, 
then only one target field will be shown. The target field is explained more 
when we cover the Creating goals section.
5.	 Click on Save, but do not close the record.

Chapter 4
[ 131 ]
Once the goal metric has been created, the next step is to create rollup fields for the  
goal metric.
Rollup fields
Rollup fields are used to define which entities and fields will be used to calculate the 
value of the target. There are three types of rollup fields:
•	
Actual: Measures the current value of the target. For example, measuring the 
actual revenue on a closed opportunity that has been won.
•	
In Progress: Measures the value of what is in progress for the target.  
For example, the estimated revenue of all open opportunities.
•	
Custom: An example of this is to count the number of opportunities lost.
Creating rollup fields
To create a rollup field, follow these steps:
1.	 Continuing from the steps outlined in the Creating a goal metric section, click 
inside the Rollup Fields sub-grid, and then on the Rollup Fields ribbon bar, 
inside the Records group, click on Add New Rollup Field.
2.	 Complete the following fields:
i.	
Rollup Field: Choose from Actual, In Progress, and Custom.
ii.	 Source Record Type: The type of record to define the rollup field 
for. In the examples we've been using, we would set this value  
to Opportunity.

Managing Sales Applications
[ 132 ]
iii.	 Source Record Type State: The state that the record should have 
in order to be included in this specific rollup value. For example, 
if we wanted to track the actual revenue of opportunities we've 
won, then this field would be set to Won.
iv.	 Source Field: The field used to measure the Actual, In Progress 
or Custom value on. An example here would be Actual Revenue. 
Note that this field is only required when the metric type on the 
goal metric is set to Amount.
v.	 Source Record Type Status: The status reason that the record 
should have in order to be included in this specific rollup value.
vi.	 Record Type: Type of record used to define the date field that 
determines the goal period that the records will roll up into.  
An example of this would be Opportunity.
vii.	Date Field: Date field that determines the goal period records 
will roll up into.  For example, if the goal is to measure the  
actual revenue of closed opportunities in a fiscal year, then the 
system needs a date to check to see if it's in the current fiscal year. 
In the example we've been using, this date would be the Actual 
Close Date.
3.	 Click on Save and Close.
4.	 Repeat steps 1 to 3 until all of the necessary rollup fields have been created.
5.	 Click on Save and Close to save and close the goal metric.
The next step is to create a rollup query that will pull in all of the records that you 
want to measure against.
Rollup query
Rollup queries help you gather data about a goal and all child goals. Thinking back 
to the business scenario about goals, Race2Win's sales managers wanted sales people 
on their team to track individual goals. A rollup query can be used to gather the data 
to measure the goals against. For example, the query could search for all opportunity 
records with a status of closed and a closed date in the current fiscal year.

Chapter 4
[ 133 ]
Creating rollup queries
To create a rollup query, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Sales module, and then click on Rollup Queries.
2.	 On the Rollup Queries ribbon bar, in the Records group, click on New.
3.	 Enter the following required fields:
i.	
Name: Enter a clear, concise name for the rollup query
ii.	 Owner: Defaults to the currently logged in user
iii.	 Entity Type: Define the entity for which this query will be run
4.	 Under Query, use the controls to add the criteria for your query. The criteria 
that you can add depends on the entity type you have chosen.
5.	 To test the query, click on View Records.
6.	 Click on Save and Close.
The next step is to create the actual goal itself.

Creating goals
To create a goal, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Sales module, and then click on Goals.
2.	 On the Goals ribbon bar, in the Records group, click on New.
3.	 Complete the following required fields:
i.	
Name: Enter a clear, concise name for the goal.
ii.	 Goal Owner: The user for whom the goal is being tracked.
iii.	 Manager: The goal manager is defaulted to the user creating the 
goal, and this person has full access to the record. An example 
of where the manager would be different than the owner is if a 
sales manager creates a goal for one of his team members. As 
soon as a goal is created, the goal record gets shared with the goal 
owner. Whenever this goal has a parent goal associated to it, the 
manager of the parent goal also has access to see this goal.
iv.	 Goal Period Type: Select either Custom Period or Fiscal Period. 
If Custom Period is selected, then Fiscal Period and Fiscal Year 
on the form are disabled, and the From and To dates are enabled. 
The opposite is true if Fiscal Period is selected, in which case the 
From and To fields are auto populated with the Fiscal Period 
start and end dates.
v.	 Fiscal Period (if applicable)
vi.	 Fiscal Year (if applicable)
vii.	From (if applicable)
viii.	To (if applicable)

Chapter 4
[ 135 ]
ix.	 Roll Up Only from Child Goals: If Yes is selected, then the 
values from the child goals only are rolled up.
x.	 Record Set for Rollup: If Owned by goal owner is selected, then 
the records that satisfy the rollup query and have the same owner 
as the goal will be evaluated, otherwise all records that satisfy the 
query criteria will be evaluated.
4.	 The following fields are not required, but are important to mention:
i.	
Parent Goal: If you are creating a child goal, then you can attach 
the parent goal here. In the business scenario for goals, above, a 
manager is trying to roll up all of his team's goals into one goal. 
His team member's goals will each have this field set to one 
parent goal, which is owned by the manager.
ii.	 Target: This is a specific value for the goal metric over a given 
period of time. For example, if the goal metric is to measure the 
sum of actual revenue on opportunities that were won, the target 
could be 1,000,000.00 USD in the current fiscal period.
iii.	 The Actuals section of the form is not for user entry. The fields 
here display the actual values of the goal metrics since the last 
time the goal was recalculated. The Last Rolled Up Date is the 
date on which the goal was last recalculated.
iv.	 Rollup Query - Actual: Select the rollup query to be used to 
evaluate the actual values of the goal metric.
v.	 Rollup Query – In-progress: Select the rollup query to be used to 
evaluate the in-progress values of the goal metric.

Summary
Leads are organizations or individuals that can potentially do business with an 
organization. Leads can be created manually, but an added feature in CRM is the 
ability to create a lead from an e-mail. Throughout the life-cycle of a lead, the record 
can be assigned to a user or team, shared with one or more users or teams and 
deactivated or reactivated. Many organizations go through a lead qualification process 
to determine if that lead will in fact result in the purchase of a product or service. Lead 
records have various statuses based on if the lead is open, qualified, or disqualified. 
When a lead record is qualified, a new account, contact and/or opportunity is created.
Accounts and contacts are two central components of any CRM system as they 
enable an organization to manage their customers. They can both be created in 
multiple ways, such as through the file menu on the ribbon, within a lookup dialog, 
or for a contact through an associated view. Account and contact records can be 
shared, assigned, deactivated, activated, and merged. Merging two records will 
deactivate the duplicate record, and associate all related records (activities and 
opportunities) to the master record.

Managing Sales Applications
[ 142 ]
When a customer is interested in purchasing products or services, an organization 
can track these by using opportunities. Opportunities in CRM are a way to track 
potential sales. Opportunity records can be created by converting an activity, 
converting a lead, or manually creating an opportunity. Opportunities, like all other 
entities, have a status field that defines the state of the record. It also has a status 
reason field, which is a sub-category of the status, and is used to further define the 
state of the record. When an opportunity is created, the default status is open, and 
when the opportunity is closed, the status can be set to won or lost. There are various 
status reasons for each of those status values.
Opportunity products are a way to associate products to an opportunity. They 
cannot be added unless a price list has been set on the opportunity. An opportunity 
can be closed when it has been either won or lost. CRM allows an opportunity to be 
re-opened. An example is if the opportunity was originally lost, but the customer 
expresses interest again, in which case that same opportunity can be re-opened. 
As products are added, the estimated revenue field can be re-calculated, providing 
up-to-date information. The currency field on an opportunity defaults to the base 
currency, however it can be changed as long as there are no opportunity products, 
quotes, orders, or invoices associated to it. If an opportunity does not have any of 
those related records associated to it, then the currency can be changed up until the 
opportunity is closed. If a currency is changed on the opportunity, then a price list 
with the same currency must also be set. If the exchange rate is changed for a given 
currency, this will not affect any existing opportunities. However, any opportunities 
created after the exchange rate change will have the new exchange rate applied.
One way that CRM helps an organization to monitor sales performance is with the 
use of goals. In order to properly setup goals, goal metrics must be created first. Once 
a goal metric is created, rollup fields for the metric must be defined. Next, a rollup 
query must be created to define search criteria for the records to measure the goals 
against. Lastly, a goal is created tying the goal metric and rollup query to a specified 
time period. Goals are one way to analyze sales data, but another method is by using 
reports and dashboards.
In the next chapter, we'll look more closely at managing products within CRM by 
using the product catalog and how an organization can manage sales order processing.

An introduction to the product catalog
The product catalog in Microsoft Dynamics CRM consists of products and prices. It 
provides a central location for managing any goods and services that an organization 
might sell, along with their respective prices and/or discounts.

Business scenarios
Race2Win Insurance Company has a number of clients that were attained through 
successful marketing campaigns, which generated a number of leads, which in turn 
led to a number of opportunities. These opportunities include a range of consulting 
services to determine the best possible insurance coverage. Consulting services are 
non-tangible, non-inventory items. Along with these services, Race2Win provides 
welcome kits which include Race2Win branded souvenirs, safety products, and 
brochures. These products and services can all be managed via the product catalog.
If you recall from the previous chapter, products can be associated to an opportunity 
and the estimated revenue can be automatically calculated. When the opportunity 
is configured in this manner, the system utilizes the product catalog, which uses 
products, unit groups, price lists, and discount lists to calculate a more accurate 
estimated revenue number.
To enable this business scenario, the organization will have to set up the product 
catalog. Setting up the product catalog entails creating the following items, in order:
•	
Unit groups
•	
Products
•	
Price list(s)
•	
Discount list(s) (optional)
Unit groups
A unit group contains the base unit in which a product is available. For example, 
Race2Win Insurance Company bills out its consultants at a certain rate per hour. The 
base unit in this case can be 1 hour. The unit group is then comprised of all different 
increments of the base unit. An example of this is a unit group of one consulting day 
which is equivalent to 8 hours (8 base units). When a unit group is created, a primary 
unit is needed, which is the core and basic unit from which all other units are 
created. This may seem a bit confusing at first, but let us try to simplify the definition 
by providing an example.

Chapter 5
[ 145 ]
Let's take Race2Win Insurance Company's consulting services as an example. They 
can create a unit group called "One Day" which would contain a quantity of 8 
primary units (8 hours). They can also create a unit group called "One Week" which 
would contain a quantity of 40 primary units (40 hours). To create a unit group, 
perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to Settings, and then under the Business section in the left-
hand navigation pane, click on Product Catalog.
2.	 On the Product Catalog page, click on Unit Groups.
3.	 On the Unit Groups ribbon bar in the Records group, click on New.
4.	 In the Create Unit Group dialog window, enter the following:
°°
Name: A clear, concise name for the unit group
°°
Primary Unit: This is the base unit for this unit group
5.	 Click on OK.
6.	 In the left-hand navigation pane, click on Units. You'll see the primary unit 
entered in step 4 in the list of units.
7.	 To add more units, go to the Units ribbon bar in the Records group, and click 
on Add New Unit.

Managing the Product Catalog and Order Processing
[ 146 ]
8.	 Enter the following required information:
°°
Name: A clear, concise name for the unit.
°°
Quantity: This is the quantity of the base unit. For example, if the 
base unit is 1 hour, and you enter the quantity here of 8, then the total 
quantity of hours charged will be 1 x 8 = 8 hours.
°°
Base Unit: Search for the base unit for the unit group.
9.	 Click on Save and Close.
There can be multiple ways to configure units within a unit group. In the previous 
example, we created a unit group called Consulting Hours. The unit group 
contained a primary unit of Hour, and a unit called Day that is equivalent to eight 
primary units (8 hours). If necessary, another unit can be created called Work Week, 
which can be configured with two different base units and quantities. The Work 
Week unit can have a base unit of Hour, and a quantity of 40 (1 week = 40 hours), or a 
base unit of Day and a quantity of 5 (1 week = 5 days). As you can see, the base unit 
can be interchanged and still achieve the same results.
Creating and managing products
Products in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 can be defined as any goods or services 
that an organization might sell. These products can be tangible items, or they can be 
services that an organization may provide, such as consulting services.
Creating products
To create a product, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Settings module, and under the Business section click 
on Product Catalog.
2.	 On the Product Catalog page, click on Products.

Chapter 5
[ 147 ]
3.	 On the Products ribbon bar in the Records group, click on New.
4.	 Enter the following required information:
°°
ID: Product ID, which can be anything, including numbers  
and letters.
°°
Name: A clear, concise name for the product.
°°
Subject: Subjects can be used to help classify products, which can 
be helpful when reporting and searching. Subjects are explained in 
greater detail in Chapter 7, Managing Service Management Applications.
°°
Unit Group
°°
Default Unit
°°
Decimal Supported: Number of decimals used in the cost of the 
product. Usually two decimal places are used, but to avoid any 
calculation/rounding issues, some organizations opt to use whole 
numbers for prices; however that is a rare case.
5.	 The following fields are not required, but are worth noting:
°°
Product Type: Select the category of the product. The default values 
are: Sales Inventory, Miscellaneous Charges, Services, and Flat Fees.
°°
Quantity On Hand: Current inventory in stock. Please note that this 
is a field that the user enters manually. Any integration to a back-end 
system such as Microsoft Dynamics GP or Microsoft Dynamics AX is 
not out of the box CRM functionality.

[ 148 ]
°°
Default Price List: Price lists are discussed more in-depth later in this 
chapter, but for now, this is a read-only field until the form is saved. 
A product may be associated to multiple price lists, and although 
default price list is not required, after you save the product record, 
it is recommended to set a default price list. Then, if an account or 
contact record does not contain a price list, the default price list will 
be used for order processing.
°°
Standard Cost: This is the standard cost of the item over a period  
of time.
°°
Current Cost: The current cost to make or purchase the product.
°°
Vendor: If the product is manufactured by another vendor and being 
re-sold by your organization, this field can be used to track who that 
vendor is.
6.	 Click on Save and Close.
Managing products
When a product is created, it can be classified into categories by using the subject 
field. CRM provides an easy way to change the subject on one or more products.
Reclassifying products
To reclassify a product, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Settings module, and under the Business section click 
on Product Catalog.
2.	 On the Product Catalog page, click on Products.
3.	 Select one or more products to change the subject for.
4.	 On the Products ribbon bar in the Actions group, click on Reclassify.
5.	 Look up the subject that you wish to change for the product(s).
6.	 Click on OK.

Chapter 5
[ 149 ]
As mentioned when creating a product, the default price list is disabled. After 
the product has been created, the default price list can be set. A product must be 
associated to a price list before that price list can be set as the default.
Setting the default price list
To set the default price list for a product, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Settings module, and under the Business section click 
on Product Catalog.
2.	 On the Product Catalog page, click on Products.
3.	 Find and open the product record for which you wish to set the default price.
4.	 Click on the lookup icon next to the Default Price List field.
5.	 Find and select the price list that you wish to set as the default.
6.	 Click on OK
7.	 Click on Save and Close.
Converting a product to a kit
Products can be bundled into kits. For example, if an organization sells certain 
products that also come with free items such as a hat or a mug, these can be 
combined into a kit. Another example is if an organization sells textbooks along with 
an attached CD. The textbooks and CDs can be separate products in the product 
catalog, but they can be combined to form a product kit.
To convert a product to a kit, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Settings module, and under the Business section click 
on Product Catalog.
2.	 On the Product Catalog page, click on Products.
3.	 Find the product that you want to convert to a kit, and open the record.
4.	 On the Product ribbon bar in the Actions group, click on the Convert to  
Kit button:
5.	 In the Convert to Kit confirmation dialog box, click on OK.

6.	 Click on Kit Products in the left-hand navigation area of the product form.
7.	 Click on Add Existing Product.
8.	 Add one or more products to this kit.
9.	 Click on Save and Close.
The price of the kit has to be set by using a price list item. No prices from the 
individual products that comprise the kit will be transferred or summed up.  
To convert the kit back to a product, follow the preceding steps, but click on the 
Convert to Product button.
Adding substitute products
CRM allows for products to be associated to other products so they can be used 
as a substitute. An example of using a substitute product is if one product is 
discontinued, no longer in stock, or just not available, a substitute product may be 
used for an opportunity or to process an order. To add a substitute product, perform 
the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Settings module, and under the Business section click 
on Product Catalog.
2.	 On the Product Catalog page, click on Products.
3.	 Find the product for which you wish to add substitute products, and open 
the record.
4.	 In the left-hand navigation area, click on Substitute Products.

Creating and managing price lists
A price list is basically a collection of price list items. A price list item is a record that 
sets the price for a particular product. An organization can have multiple price lists 
with price list items for the same product, in order to price a product differently.

Business scenarios
Race2Win Insurance Company now has an extensive, happy customer base. Some of 
these customers have done business for quite some time, and have earned preferred 
customer pricing. Race2Win has also taken on some government clients who have 
negotiated another set of rates. Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 offers the perfect 
solution by allowing the set up of different price lists that can be associated to 
different customers.
Creating price lists
To create a price list, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Settings module, and under the Business section click 
on Product Catalog.
2.	 On the Product Catalog page, click on Price Lists.
3.	 On the Price Lists ribbon bar in the Records group, click on New.
4.	 Enter the following required information:
°°
Name: A clear, concise name of price list
°°
Currency: This is automatically populated to the default currency, 
but this can be changed
5.	 Click on Save and Close.
The price list itself does not set the price for a product, but rather it is a container for 
all possible prices for products.

Creating price list items
To set a price for a product, a price list item needs to be created. To create a price list 
item, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Settings module, and under the Business section click 
on Product Catalog.
2.	 On the Product Catalog page, click on Price Lists.
3.	 Find and open the price list to which you wish to add price list items.
4.	 On the left-hand side, click on Price List Items.
5.	 On the List Tools tab, on the Price List Items ribbon bar, in the Records 
group, click on Add New Price List Item.
6.	 The Price List and Currency fields will default to the value of the price list  
from within which the item is being created, and the currency specified on 
the price list, respectively.
7.	 Enter the following required information:
a.	 Product: The product that you want to associate to the price list.
b.	 Unit: Once a product has been entered, this field becomes enabled.  
It is filtered on the units associated to the product.
c.	 Quantity Selling Option: Select from No Control, Whole, and 
Whole and Fractional. This defines whether whole, fractional, or 
both types of quantities can be specified in the quantity field of Quote 
Product, Order Product, and Invoice Product records. For example, 
mugs cannot be sold in fractional quantities, thus setting this field to 
whole, will not allow a fractional value to be entered in the quantity 
field of the aforementioned records.
d.	 Pricing Method: Select from one of the following options:
°°
Currency Amount: If this option is selected, the price of the 
product will be retrieved from the value entered in step 7.f, 
ahead.
°°
Percent of List: If selected, the price of the product will be the 
list price entered on the product multiplied by the percentage 
entered in step 7.g.

Chapter 5
[ 153 ]
°°
Percent Markup – Current Cost: If this field is selected, then the 
price of the product will be the percentage entered in step 7.g 
multiplied by the value of the current cost field on the product, 
plus the current cost. As a formula, this would be Price of 
Product = (Current Cost * Percentage in step 7.g) + Current Cost.
°°
Percent Margin – Current Cost: If selected, the margin of the 
price for the product is a percentage of the current cost of the 
product (the percentage is entered in step 7.g).
°°
Percent Markup – Standard Cost: If selected, the markup of the 
price for the product is a percentage of the standard cost of the 
product (the percentage is entered in step 7.g).
°°
Percent Margin – Standard Cost: If selected, the margin of the 
price for the product is a percentage of the standard cost of the 
product (the percentage is entered in step 7.g).
e.	 Amount: This field becomes enabled only if Currency Amount is 
chosen for the Pricing Method field.
f.	
Percentage: This field becomes enabled only if any of the percent 
options are selected in the Pricing Method field.
g.	 Rounding Policy: This field is only valid when the pricing method is 
a percentage. The options are none, round up, round down, or round 
to the nearest.
h.	 Rounding Option: This field is only valid when the pricing method 
is a percentage and when the Rounding Policy field value is not set 
to none. The two options are:
°°
Ends in: The price, if rounded, will be rounded up to the next 
multiple of the amount set in the Rounding Amount field.
°°
Multiple of: The price, if rounded, will be rounded to a multiple 
of the value entered in the Rounding Amount field.

1.	 Start CRM, go to the Settings module, and under the Business section click 
on Product Catalog.
2.	 On the Product Catalog page, click on Products.
3.	 Find the product to which you wish to add a price list item, and open  
the record.
4.	 On the Product ribbon bar in the Actions group, click on the Add Price List 
Item button.
5.	 A new price list item form is displayed, with the Product and Unit fields  
pre-populated.

Chapter 5
[ 155 ]
Deactivating price lists
When a price list has expired or becomes invalid, it can be deactivated. When a price 
list is deactivated, any opportunities, quotes, orders, or invoices that are still open 
will continue to use the price list until they are completed or closed. However, no 
new records will be able to reference the deactivated price list. As you can see, the 
pricing options can be as simple or as complex as your organization desires in order 
to meet the various business scenarios. An optional field in the price list item is the 
discount list, which can be used to provide discounts on a price for a product.
Discount lists
Discount lists are often referred to as volume discount lists. The key here is the  
word discount. Some organizations have a concept of volume pricing, whereby  
once a certain quantity of a product has been purchased, a new price will be set.  
For example, say 1 hour of consulting from Race2Win Insurance Company is  
USD 100. Now let's say there is a price break for anyone that receives 300 to 500 
hours of consulting. Volume pricing dictates the new price to USD 90 per hour  
(a discount of USD 10).
CRM has a concept of volume discount which is different. Based on the quantity 
purchased, a discount is given of the price listed on the price list item. Using the 
previous example, if the rate charged for consulting is USD 100 per hour, and a 
customer purchases 300 to 500 consulting hours, then volume discount says the 
customer will get a USD 10 per hour discount.
Creating discount lists
To create a discount list, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Settings module, and under the Business section click 
on Product Catalog.
2.	 On the Product Catalog page, click on Discount Lists.
3.	 On the Discount Lists ribbon bar, in the Records group, click on New.

[ 156 ]
4.	 Enter the following information:
°°
Name: Enter a clear, concise name for the discount list.
°°
Type: The discount can be either Percentage or Amount. Depending 
on the value selected here, the discount field will be changed.
5.	 Click on OK.
6.	 A new form is displayed, with the name and type entered.
7.	 In the left-hand navigation area, click on Discounts.
8.	 On the List Tools tab, on the Discounts ribbon bar, click on  
Add New Discount.
9.	 Enter the following information:
°°
Begin Quantity: The minimum quantity needed to obtain this 
discount. This number must be unique to the discount list, otherwise 
an error message will appear stating that the quantity is being used in 
another discount.
°°
End Quantity: The maximum quantity that must be purchased in 
order to obtain this discount. This number must be unique to the 
discount list, otherwise an error message will appear stating that the 
quantity is being used in another discount.
°°
Amount/Percentage: Depending on the type of the discount list, this 
field will either be a discount amount or percentage to be taken off 
the price.

Chapter 5
[ 157 ]
10.	 Click on Save and Close to create the volume discount or Save and  
New to create the volume discount and display a new form to create  
an additional discount.
11.	 Repeat steps 8 to 10 to create multiple discounts.
12.	 Click on Save and Close to close the discount list.
A sample discount list, with multiple discounts, is shown as follows:
Once a discount list is created, it can be added to a price list. For an example of how 
the product catalog and pricing flow together, see the following business scenario.
Business scenarios
Race2Win Insurance Company sells individual insurance policies, but it also sells 
corporate health care packages. Depending on who the customer is and how many 
employees enroll in the package, various pricing scenarios are available. Race2Win 
has a sales opportunity with a corporation in the United Sates that has 1,000 
employees, but is interested in a life insurance product that it wants to offer to their 
employees (about 500) that have been there for more than 20 years.

Managing the Product Catalog and Order Processing
[ 158 ]
The salesperson in charge of the account creates an opportunity record in CRM 
to capture information and start tracking the progress of the potential sale. The 
opportunity is created with a "Standard" price list because the customer has not 
qualified for any special pricing. The opportunity is also set up to automatically 
calculate the estimated revenue.
The sales person then creates an opportunity product record from the opportunity. 
The representative selects an existing product from the product catalog, sets a default 
unit, and sets the pricing field to Use Default, which means that the price of the 
product will come from the price list. This particular product is associated to the 
price list via a price list item. That price list item defined the price as a flat amount. 
The sales person then enters a quantity of 500 on the opportunity product.
After the opportunity product record is saved, the sales person then recalculates 
the opportunity. CRM will now calculate the estimated revenue of the opportunity. 
In this scenario, the estimated revenue is equivalent to the quantity entered on 
the opportunity product, multiplied by the flat amount set on the price list item 
associated to the price list, which is associated to the opportunity.
Now let's say the sales person informs his contacts at the organization that there is a 
volume discount for this product of an additional 10 percent if 600 to 700 products 
are purchased. The corporation is interested in hearing a revised estimate, so the 
sales person changes the quantity on the opportunity product from 500 to 600. After 
the opportunity product is saved, the sales person recalculates the opportunity 
again. In this scenario, the estimated revenue is equivalent to the product price (the 
flat amount set on the price list item associated to the price list, which is associated to 
the opportunity) minus the volume discount amount of 10 percent multiplied by the 
quantity entered on the opportunity product.
The previous scenario describes a few pricing scenarios related to opportunities.  
This is important to understand because these concepts can be applied when creating 
and managing quotes, orders, and invoices.
Creating and managing quotes
Quotes can provide customers or potential customers with an estimated amount 
for all of the products that they wish to purchase. A quote can be created from 
an existing opportunity or on its own. A quote created automatically from an 
opportunity will inherit all of the products and pricing specified in the opportunity.

1.	 Start CRM, go to the Sales module, and then click on Opportunities.
2.	 Find and open the opportunity record to which you wish to add a quote.
3.	 Within the form, locate the Quotes sub-grid, and click inside of it.

Managing quotes
Now that a quote has been entered, the products need to be entered in order for 
the quote to be complete. There are again two ways to enter a product: from the 
opportunity and manually.
Adding products by using Get Products
Products are associated to a quote via the Quote Product entity. Quote products are 
automatically created from any existing opportunity products. The Get Products 
feature can be used if you modify the opportunity products after creating the quote, 
or want to associate products from a different opportunity.
1.	 Start CRM, go to the Sales module, and then click on Quotes.
2.	 Find and open the quote record to which you want to add products.
3.	 On the Quote ribbon bar in the Actions group, click on Get Products:

the retrieve the products.
5.	 Click on OK.
6.	 The products have not been added as quote products.
Adding products directly to a quote
Products are tied to a quote by using the Quote Product entity. To manually associate 
a product to a quote, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, go to Sales module, and then click on Quotes.
2.	 Find and open the quote to which you want to add products.
3.	 In the left-hand navigation area, click on Quote Products.
4.	 On the List Tools tab, on the Quote Product ribbon, in the Records group, 
click on Add New Quote Product.

Recalculating a quote
Users can add as many products to a quote as they'd like. As products are added  
or even removed, users can recalculate the quote to update all of the total values  
on the quote.
Quote statuses
A quote record, like many other records, has various statuses and status reasons that 
are important to understand. According to MSDN, the status to status reason is as 
shown in the following table:
Status
Status reason
Draft
In Progress
Active
In Progress, Open
Won
Won
Closed
Lost, Canceled, Revised
When a quote is created, the default status is Draft. Quotes can only be modified 
while they are in Draft status. When a quote is ready to be sent to a customer, it can 
be activated by clicking on the Activate Quote button. When this happens, the form 
is saved, the status value gets set to Active, and the form becomes read only. Once 
this happens, the Create Order, Revise quote, and Close Quote buttons are enabled.
If a quote needs to be revised, users can click on the Revise quote button. This will 
change the status of the quote back to Draft, and the revision number on the quote 
record will be incremented. This is important because a new quote is not created, but 
rather the revision ID on the record is updated.

Managing the Product Catalog and Order Processing
[ 166 ]
Closing a quote
If users decide to close the quote, the close quote dialog appears:
The quote can be closed with a status of Revised, Lost, or Canceled. There is an 
option to create a revised quote, or not to revise this quote. If the quote is not revised, 
then the user has the option to close the related opportunity (if one exists). Once a 
quote is closed, it can always be re-opened by clicking on the Activate Quote button.

Chapter 5
[ 167 ]
Business scenarios
Race2Win Insurance Company has sales teams that are creating a number of 
opportunities. Often, the customer may request a quote. The quote can be generated 
from the opportunity. This quote, once ready to be sent to the customer, can be 
activated. Let's now say a customer has decided not to make the purchase; we can 
close the quote in CRM by clicking on the Close Quote button on the Quote ribbon, 
bar in the Actions group. If the customer decides to come back to the sales person, 
expressing interest in the quote again, the quote can reactivated.
Creating and managing orders
Once a customer has accepted the terms of a sale, an order can be created. An order 
can be created from an opportunity, quote, or manually. Creating an order from 
an opportunity is similar to the process outlined around creating a quote from an 
opportunity, which is why we won't discuss that topic any further. Let's take a look 
at how to create an order from a quote, and how to create one manually.
Creating an order from a quote
In order to create an order from a quote, the quote must be activated. To create an 
order from a quote, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Sales module, and then click on Quote.
2.	 Open the quote from which you wish to create an order.
3.	 On the Quote ribbon bar in the Actions group, click on Create Order.
4.	 In the Create Order dialog box, enter the following fields:
°°
Status Reason: This gets set to Won.
°°
Date Won: The date on which the quote was accepted.
°°
Description
°°
Close Opportunity: If there is an opportunity associated with the 
quote, it can be closed.
°°
Actual Revenue is: Either enter the actual revenue to place on the 
closed opportunity or grab it from the quote.

Don't update opportunity: There's also an option not to touch the 
opportunity. This can be used if there are multiple quotes/orders 
created from an opportunity.

An order form is displayed with information from the quote copied over into 
the order. 
Besides creating an order from a quote, an order can be created manually.

The following screenshot shows the Shipping Information section of  
the order:
The following screenshot shows the address information section of the 
quote. The address section is similar to that of the quote and can be manually 
entered or retrieved from the customer on the order by using the Lookup 
Address functionality. The Lookup Address process is similar to the one 
outlined for the quote.
4.	 Click on Save and Close.
Once an order is created, products can be associated to it.

Chapter 5
[ 171 ]
Order products
Products are tied to an order by using the Order Product entity. If the order was 
generated from a quote or opportunity, then the order products will be inherited. 
The order product form is very similar to the quote product form except for the 
Fulfillment section, which is shown in the following screenshot:
This is because once a customer has accepted the quote, the order can be fulfilled. This 
means that products can be shipped or back-ordered, or the shipment can be canceled.
Managing orders
Once an order has been created, either by itself or from a quote, users have a few 
options to manage the order. Like a quote, products can be added by using the Get 
Products functionality, or can be added manually.
Recalculating orders
As products are added or removed, the totals on the order can be recalculated  
in a similar way in which a quote can be recalculated—that is, using the  
Recalculate button.
Use current pricing
If an order is created from a quote, all of the pricing is inherited from the quote. By 
default, when an order is created and products are added, price locking takes effect. 
Price locking prevents changes to the price per unit for products in open orders. 
Even if the price changes in the product catalog, the original price will remain for any 
open orders. Let's say now that the order sits in the system for some time and in the 
meantime prices have changed. The prices will not be updated on the quote because 
they are locked. To update the price on a quote, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Sales module, and then click on Orders.
2.	 Find and open the order record that you wish to update.

Managing the Product Catalog and Order Processing
[ 172 ]
3.	 On the Order ribbon bar, in the Actions group, click on Use Current Pricing:
Once the prices have been updated, the order is not locked. Therefore, if pricing is 
updated in CRM, the price on this order will be updated. To prevent this, you can 
click on the Lock Pricing button:
When an order is ready to be shipped, it goes through a fulfillment process.
Fulfilling an order
Microsoft Dynamics CRM will not ship any products, but can be integrated with 
other systems in order to help in the fulfillment process. The fulfillment process in 
CRM is merely a way to mark that the order has been fulfilled. To fulfill an order, 
perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Sales module, and then click on Orders.
2.	 Find and open the order record that you wish to fulfill.
3.	 On the Order ribbon bar in the Actions group, click on Fulfill Order:
4.	 The Fulfill Order dialog box is displayed.

Chapter 5
[ 173 ]
5.	 Enter the following fields:
°°
Status Reason: Indicates whether it's a full or a partial fulfillment
°°
Date Fulfilled
6.	 Click on OK.
Once an order is fulfilled, the order is marked read only and cannot be edited. 
However the order can be canceled, or an invoice can be generated from the order. 
Cancelling an order will change the order status to canceled, and will also keep the 
order as read only.
Creating and managing invoices
One of the last steps for an organization to carry out during sales order processing 
is to invoice the customer for the products or services sold. An invoice is essentially 
billing a customer for an order. Invoices can be generated from an opportunity, from 
an order, or manually. Creating an invoice from an opportunity is similar to the 
process outlined earlier in the chapter about creating a quote from an opportunity, 
which is why we won't discuss that topic any further.

Managing the Product Catalog and Order Processing
[ 174 ]
Creating an invoice from an order
To create an invoice from an order, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Sales module, and then click on Orders.
2.	 Find the order for which you wish to create an invoice, and open it.
3.	 On the Order ribbon bar, in the Actions group, click on Create Invoice:
4.	 The invoice form is displayed, with all of the fields copied over from  
the order.
5.	 Click on Save and Close.
To create an invoice on its own, the same exact steps used to create a quote or order 
on its own can be used. The same exact fields and concepts can be applied. The only 
difference really is when it comes to managing an invoice.
Closing invoices
An invoice can be canceled or paid. If the invoice is canceled, the invoice becomes 
deactivated and read only. To mark the invoice as paid, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM, click on the Sales module, and then click on Invoices.
2.	 Find the invoice that you wish to pay, and open it.
3.	 On the Invoice ribbon bar, in the Actions group, click on the Invoice  
Paid button.

Chapter 5
[ 175 ]
4.	 Select the value for Status Reason, indicating how much of the invoice was 
paid, either Complete or Partial.
An invoice can also be canceled by clicking on the Cancel Invoice button on the 
Invoice ribbon bar, in the Actions group.
Invoices are one of the last elements involved in the sales ordering process. There are 
various reports that can help you to analyze data during sales order processing.
Reporting and analysis
CRM comes with the following out of the box reports:
•	
Invoice: This report enables an organization to print invoices. This report 
will generate a customer-friendly version of the invoice and will print either 
all invoices in the system, or a single invoice if you run the report from 
within the invoice itself.
•	
Invoice status: This report has a chart that displays the number of invoices in 
the system, grouped by status, with the total amount of invoices in  
each status.
•	
Order: This report enables an organization to print orders. This report will 
generate a customer friendly version of the order and will print either all 
orders in the system, or a single order if you run the report within the  
order itself.

•	
Products by account: This report lists all accounts and the products they 
use, taken from orders that aren't canceled, and from opportunities that have 
been won.
•	
Products by contact: This report lists all contacts and the products they use, 
taken from orders that aren't canceled, and from opportunities that have 
been won.
•	
Quote: This report enables an organization to print quotes. This report will 
generate a customer-friendly version of the quote and will print either all 
quotes in the system, or a single quote if you run the report from within the 
quote itself.

Summary
Products are goods or services that an organization might sell. A product record 
contains information such as classification, costs, and vendor-related information. 
A default price list can be set on the product, so that if an account or contact record 
does not contain a price list, the default price list will be used for order processing. 
Let's say there are two products: an insurance brochure and an insurance CD. 
They may be two separate products in the product catalog, but CRM allows kits to 
be created which can bundle these two products into a separate product all of its 
own. Now let's say that a product might become outdated, out of stock, or just not 
available; other products can be designated as substitute products.
A price list is a collection of price list items, and a price list item sets the price for a 
particular product. An organization can have multiple price lists with price list items 
for the same product, in order to price a product differently. The price list item has 
a number of pricing and rounding (if applicable) options that you need to become 
familiar with. Price list items can be created from a price list, or even from a product 
directly. When a price list is deactivated, any opportunities, quotes, orders, or 
invoices that are still open will continue to use the price list until they are completed 
or closed.
Quotes are an estimate of the products and services offered to a customer. A quote 
can be created from an existing opportunity, or can be created manually. Once a 
quote is created, products can be associated to a quote by using the quote product 
entity. If you want to retrieve products from an opportunity (this doesn't have to 
be an opportunity tied to the quote), then the get products functionality is useful. 
Quotes can be recalculated as long as the quotes status is in draft. The various 
statuses of a quote are Draft, Active, Won, and Closed. Quotes can be closed and 
reactivated depending on the organizational need.

Chapter 5
[ 179 ]
Once a customer has accepted the terms of a sale, an order can be created. An 
order can be created from an opportunity, from a quote, or manually. Products are 
associated to an order via the Order Product entity. Orders can be recalculated, like 
quotes and opportunities. Price locking prevents changes to the price per unit for 
products on open orders. Even if a price changes in the product catalog, the original 
price will remain for any open orders. If the order pricing is locked, the Use Current 
Pricing feature allows the pricing to be updated.
An invoice can be used in CRM in place of an order. However, typically invoices 
are viewed as a bill for products or services sold. Invoices are very similar in 
functionality and form to the order. CRM also provides several out of the box reports 
related to products and sales order processing. Some of these reports can  
be used to print more customer-friendly versions of the quote, order, or invoice.
In the next chapter, we'll give an overview of the Microsoft Dynamics CRM  
Outlook client.


Managing CRM 2011  
Outlook Client
In this chapter you will learn about:
•	
The Outlook client
•	
Tracking and managing e-mails
•	
Tracking appointments and tasks
•	
Custom views
•	
Conditional formatting
An Overview of the Outlook client
Microsoft has made a concerted effort to make sure that its entire product line can 
be integrated and be familiar to its customer base. That is, a user using Microsoft 
Office products and Microsoft Dynamics CRM should be able to intuitively navigate 
through either product. For example, the contextual ribbon in Dynamics CRM 
should be familiar to those who have used some Microsoft Office 2007, 2010, or  
2013 products.
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 integrates with Microsoft Outlook to provide the 
same functionality as the web client. This integration feature is a key differentiator 
from other CRM products in the market, and allows users to interact with the CRM 
system without opening up another application.

Managing CRM 2011 Outlook Client
[ 182 ]
Once the Microsoft Office Outlook client has been configured to integrate with 
CRM, you'll notice that the client look and feel has changed slightly. Namely, a new 
solution folder has been added to the left-hand pane, along with a new set of buttons 
on the ribbon, and additional navigation pane items.
The preceding screenshot illustrates how a user can access their dashboards from 
within Microsoft Office Outlook. 
CRM Outlook client versus web client
Working with the CRM system either via the web client or via Microsoft Office 
Outlook is fairly seamless, but there are a few key differences: 
•	
Installation: The Outlook client needs to be installed and configured on an 
individual's machine. The web client is accessed through an Internet browser 
(for now only Internet Explorer is supported).
•	
Personalization: Within Outlook, you can create personalized views,  
using such things as conditional formatting (this will be discussed later  
in the chapter). 

Chapter 6
[ 183 ]
•	
Reminders: When tasks, appointments, and service activities are created in 
the web client, they are synchronized down to Outlook. These activities can 
have reminders tied to them in Outlook, notifying the user when the task is 
due or the appointment is approaching.
•	
Outlook Connector: Users can click on a contact's name to see e-mail and 
attachments that they have sent you, meetings you have attended together, 
and the contact's activities in social networks such as Facebook and LinkedIn. 
•	
Multiple Organization Access: Dynamics CRM can have multiple 
organizations. Using the web client, typically each organization is accessed 
using a different URL. Within the CRM 2011 Outlook client, multiple 
organizations can be configured and accessed in one place. However, it is 
only possible to synchronize data from one organization. 
•	
Offline access: The Outlook client allows a user to go offline (more about this 
later) and make changes to CRM data on their local computer. When the user 
come back online, the changes can be synchronized. 
Offline access
The Microsoft Dynamics CRM Outlook client installs as an add-in to Microsoft 
Office Outlook and allows the user to interact with Dynamics CRM seamlessly while 
connected to the Internet. The CRM Outlook client also allows a user to interact with 
CRM data while offline. The installation of this feature comes with Microsoft SQL 
Server Express and a database that contains a local copy of the data for CRM. Offline 
access allows a user to interact with CRM data locally if they lose their Internet 
connection. When they regain their Internet connection, any changes made can be 
synchronized with CRM. 
Outlook synchronization
Information about outlook synchronization can be found in a whitepaper published 
by Microsoft at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.
aspx?displaylang=en&id=17594. Outlook synchronization enables users to 
view CRM data such as accounts, contacts, appointments, e-mails, letters, faxes, 
phone calls, and tasks. When a record is synchronized, two copies exist: one in 
the CRM Outlook client, and one in the CRM database. A record is marked for 
synchronization if: 
•	
The record is marked for synchronization using the Track in CRM button.
•	
A user runs the synchronization process manually.
•	
A background process runs periodically to synchronize records.

Managing CRM 2011 Outlook Client
[ 184 ]
Going offline in the CRM Outlook client triggers a process to replicate data from  
the CRM database to the CRM Outlook client. When a user goes back online,  
changes to the data found in the local database are replicated back to the CRM 
database. Regardless of whether a user does or does not go offline, a synchronization 
process still occurs to make sure that records are up-to-date in both Outlook  
and CRM. 
Changes from Outlook synchronized to CRM
When a change is made to a record marked for synchronization, the following 
process occurs to synchronize the changes:
•	
Information required to find the changed record in Outlook is added to a 
local database on the user's machine
•	
When the synchronization process starts, it looks at the local database and 
finds information regarding all changed records to be synchronized
•	
The process then finds the data in Outlook and updates the data in CRM
Changes from CRM synchronized to Outlook
Changes made to records in Dynamics CRM are stored in a database table on the 
CRM server. Changes are stored on the server for each Dynamics CRM Outlook 
client, along with the date and time at which the last synchronization occurred. 
When synchronization starts, the following process takes place:
1.	 The process calls a service to retrieve a list of changes from the server for a 
given CRM Outlook client. Only changes made since the last synchronization 
process are retrieved.
2.	 These changes are then added to the local database on the user's machine.
3.	 Changes are applied in Outlook.

Chapter 6
[ 185 ]
Changes made in both CRM and Outlook
Data can be synchronized from both the CRM Outlook client and the CRM database. 
Whenever synchronization occurs, the latest version of the data is stored in a 
property called OriginalXML, along with the date and time of the synchronization.

A scenario illustrated in the Microsoft whitepaper is shown in the preceding 
diagram. Let us say a user makes changes to three fields in Outlook (A1, B1, and C1). 
At a later time, let us say another user modifies two of the same fields (A2, B2), but 
in CRM. When the synchronization process begins, the two fields from CRM (A2, B2) 
are copied down to Outlook because these were the latest changes. Then the one field 
from Outlook (C1) is copied to CRM because it was changed last in Outlook.
In this scenario, notice the same fields were changed in both Outlook and CRM, but 
the latest changes were applied in both systems during synchronization. This is an 
important concept to understand.

Managing CRM 2011 Outlook Client
[ 186 ]
Deletion rules
There are various rules applied when certain records are deleted. As mentioned 
above, one way a record is synchronized is if it's tracked in CRM. A record can be 
untracked in CRM as well, but still plays a part in the rules as follows:
Entity
Rule during Outlook Synchronization
Contact
A contact deleted in Outlook will not be deleted in CRM.
A contact that is untracked in Outlook will be deleted in CRM.
A contact deleted in CRM will be deleted in Outlook if the Outlook user is 
not the CRM Owner of the contact. If the user is the owner in CRM, then 
the Outlook contact will not be linked to the record in CRM.
Appointments
An appointment deleted or untracked in Outlook will be deleted in CRM 
only if the following are true:
•	 Appointment is open/scheduled
•	 Appointment Start Time is in the future.
•	 The user performing the delete action is the Owner or Organizer 
of the Appointment.
An appointment deleted in CRM will be deleted in Outlook if the 
following is true:
•	 Appointment Start Time is in the future.
Tasks
A task deleted in Outlook will be deleted in CRM, and vice versa, if the 
task is not completed.
E-mails
An e-mail deleted in Outlook will not be deleted in CRM.
An e-mail untracked in Outlook will be deleted in CRM if the user 
chooses to have it deleted.
An e-mail deleted in CRM will not be deleted in Outlook.
Tracking and managing e-mails
An e-mail in Dynamics CRM is considered to be just another activity record. E-mails 
can automatically be tracked, or when an e-mail is created in Outlook, it can be 
tracked by clicking on the Track button. Let's take a look at the first option.

Chapter 6
[ 187 ]
Automatically tracking e-mail messages
To automatically track e-mail messages, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Click on the File tab of the ribbon bar.
3.	 Click on Options.
4.	 Click on the E-mail tab.
5.	 Select a Track option (each of the options are described next), and whether or 
not to automatically create either a contact or a lead when the sender of the 
e-mail is not already in CRM.
6.	 Click on OK.
E-mails can automatically be tracked in Dynamics CRM in four different ways:
•	
All e-mail messages: This option tracks in Dynamics CRM every e-mail sent 
and received by the user. This option should be used with caution as there 
might be sensitive e-mails a user might not want to be tracked in CRM.
•	
E-mail messages in response to CRM e-mail: If a response to an e-mail that 
is being tracked in CRM is sent, the response itself can be tracked. If the 
sender of the e-mail is not in CRM, you have the option of automatically 
creating a record for that sender as a contact or lead.
•	
E-mail messages from CRM Leads, Contacts, and Accounts: If a message 
is received from a sender that has an e-mail associated to a lead, contact, or 
account, it will be tracked in CRM.
•	
E-mail messages from CRM records that are e-mail enabled: If the message 
is sent from a sender that has a record in CRM and has an e-mail address 
field, it will be tracked in CRM.

Managing CRM 2011 Outlook Client
[ 188 ]
Tracking outgoing e-mail messages
Clicking on the Track button starts a process where Dynamics CRM is queried 
for e-mail addresses found in the e-mail. If a match is found, an e-mail activity is 
created, and then the message is linked to the appropriate records. These records can 
be system users, accounts, contacts, leads, and queues. All of the aforementioned 
records have a system e-mail address field which is used for the match.
To track an outgoing e-mail message follow these steps:
1.	 Open Microsoft Office Outlook.
2.	 Click on the New button to create an e-mail message.
3.	 Enter the recipient, subject, and e-mail message body.
4.	 On the Message ribbon bar, in the CRM group, click on the Track button.
5.	 Click on Send to send the e-mail.
The second way in which an e-mail can be tracked is by setting the regarding field 
for the e-mail. As stated earlier, an e-mail in Dynamics CRM is an activity, and like 
other activity records, the regarding field can be set to associate any record in CRM 
to the e-mail. To set regarding in the Outlook client, follow these steps:
1.	 Open Microsoft Office Outlook.
2.	 Click on the New button to create an e-mail message.
3.	 Enter the recipient, subject, and e-mail message body.
4.	 On the Message ribbon bar, in the CRM group, click the Set  
Regarding button.

Chapter 6
[ 189 ]
5.	 Under the Find menu option, click on More.
6.	 In the Look Up Record dialog box, select the entity type and record that you 
want to set the e-mail as regarding.
7.	 Click on OK.
8.	 Click on Send to send the e-mail.
Along with tracking outgoing e-mail messages, the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
Outlook client can track incoming e-mail messages.
Tracking incoming e-mail messages
Incoming e-mail messages can again be tracked via the two methods described 
above: either by clicking on the track button or setting the regarding field. This can 
be done on individual record basis, or can be applied to multiple messages at the 
same time. Within Outlook, just select multiple e-mails, and then on the ribbon, click 
on Track, Set Regarding or both.
Stop tracking e-mail messages
E-mail messages can also be untracked. When an e-mail message is untracked, the 
e-mail message itself, and all previous e-mail activity records in CRM does not 
get deleted. However, no new e-mail activity records will be created unless e-mail 
messages are automatically being tracked (as described above).
Tracking appointments and tasks
Much like tracking and setting regarding for e-mails, similar steps can be taken to 
track and set regarding for appointments and tasks. The only difference is instead of 
creating a new e-mail, by clicking on New E-mail on the Home ribbon bar, click on 
the next button to the right, New Items, and select the activity type to be created.
In any system, the process of entering the data is important, but just as important is 
how to retrieve and view the data. Like the CRM web client, views can be configured 
by using the Microsoft Office Outlook CRM client.

Managing CRM 2011 Outlook Client
[ 190 ]
Custom views
Custom views, like in the CRM web client, allows users to configure views tailored 
to their specific needs.
Creating custom views
To create a custom view within the CRM Outlook client, follow these steps:
1.	 Start the Microsoft Office Outlook CRM Client.
2.	 Navigate to any of the modules within the CRM section of the Outlook client.
3.	 Select the entity for which you wish to create a custom view.
4.	 On the View ribbon bar, click on New Personal View.
5.	 An Advanced Find dialog box will now appear for you to configure a query 
to retrieve data.
6.	 Click on Results to view the results of the query.
7.	 If satisfied, click on Save As.
8.	 Enter the name of the view and a clear, concise description for the view.
9.	 Click on OK.
The newly created view will now show up in the list of possible views for the entity.

Chapter 6
[ 191 ]
Modifying custom views
Similar to the process for creating views, any view can be modified by simply 
selecting the view and then, on the View ribbon bar, clicking on View Settings. The 
Advanced View Settings dialog box appears (see the following screenshot):
From this dialog box, various options can be selected in order to modify the view. 
Let's look at each of these options in more detail.
•	
Columns: Allows the user to specify which columns are displayed in the 
view. For example, on the opportunity, a user can choose to display the 
owner as a column.
•	
Group By: Allows the user to group data by like values. This feature 
allows multiple group-by options. For example, the view can display all 
opportunities grouped by owner and then status.
•	
Sort: Allows the user to select a sorting order on the columns. A maximum of 
two columns can be sorted at one time.
•	
Filter: A user can filter the data being presented either by attribute values, 
SQL, or a more advanced method of using Outlook-specific fields.

Managing CRM 2011 Outlook Client
[ 192 ]
•	
Other Options: Lets the user decide the font type, size, color, and reading 
pane settings.
•	
Conditional Formatting: We will touch more on this shortly.
•	
Format Columns: Lets a user specify the width, label, and orientation of the 
columns as well as the orientation of the values in a column.
Microsoft Office Outlook provides a rich feature set to allow users to configure 
custom views and to change the settings on these views in order to provide a more 
robust user experience. One of these options, conditional formatting, deserves a 
deeper look as it can be a powerful information management tool.
Conditional formatting
Conditional formatting is a powerful way to draw attention to the data a user most 
wants to see. When the Conditional Formatting option is selected in the View Settings 
dialog (pictured earlier), a dialog box appears as shown in the following screenshot:
Here, you can add or delete a conditional formatting rule, or give priority to a rule 
over other rules by moving that rule up in order. After the rule is created, conditional 
formatting allows you to define the font size, type, and color of the data displayed 
due to the rule created. Different colors can be used to illustrate different conditional 
formatting rules.

Chapter 6
[ 193 ]
A user can add their own conditional formatting rule by simply clicking on Add. 
Once a new rule is added, the Condition button becomes enabled. By clicking on 
the Condition button, users can define a set of criteria for the rule. These criteria can 
include filters based on attributes from CRM for a given record. For example, we 
can create a rule to highlight all of the accounts with an address that has a state of 
Washington and a country of United States. Then for this rule, we can define a font 
size, type, and color (say red). Once you click on OK, the current view will have 
rows where, if the conditional formatting rule is met , the row is shown in red.

Summary
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 integrates with Microsoft Outlook to provide the 
same functionality as the web client. There are a few major differences between the 
CRM web client and the CRM Outlook client. When appointments and tasks are 
synchronized with CRM, the Outlook client can set up reminders for them. Another 
difference between the CRM web and Outlook clients is that users can create 
personalized views and apply conditional formatting rules in Outlook.
The CRM Outlook client also gives users the ability to work with offline. For this 
functionality, data is stored on a user's local machine in a SQL Server Express 
database (created during installation of the CRM Outlook client add-in). When a 
user goes back online, data can be synchronized. Various rules apply when data 
is synchronized to and from the CRM database. When changes are made both in 
the CRM Outlook client and in the CRM web client on the same fields in the same 
record, the changes made last gets applied during synchronization. Besides creating 
and updating data, synchronization rules around deleting of records also exist.

Managing CRM 2011 Outlook Client
[ 196 ]
E-mail messages in Microsoft Office Outlook can be traced in CRM either 
automatically, or by using the Track button. Tracking e-mails automatically is a 
personal user setting that can be configured in CRM. A user must select one of the 
following automatic e-mail tracking options: all e-mails, e-mails in response to CRM 
e-mail, e-mails from CRM Leads, Contacts and Accounts, or e-mail messages from 
CRM records that are e-mail enabled. Outgoing and incoming e-mail messages can be 
tracked by using the Track button. When an e-mail message is untracked, the e-mail 
message itself, and all previous e-mail activity records in CRM do not get deleted.
Custom views allows a user to personalize their CRM views within Outlook. Users 
can configure which columns are displayed, and the data by which to group, sort, 
and filter. Conditional formatting is another option to help draw attention to various 
records in Outlook. For example, if we would like to focus on accounts with a 
business address in the country of the United Kingdom, a rule can be applied to 
show those records in a different font color. In this way, those records will stand out 
when looking at them in a larger data set.
In the next chapter, we'll take a look at the service management features of CRM. 
Specifically we'll walk through managing service cases, knowledge base articles, 
queues, teams, and contracts. We'll then see how an organization can analyze and 
report on the service-related data.

Analysis and reporting
Thus far, we have been looking at how Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 has the capability 
to tackle the marketing and sales needs of any organization. The focus up to now has 
been on how to attract new customers, and how to sell an organization's products and 
services to these customers. Once a customer base has been established, it's then up to 
the organization to keep these customers happy by servicing them appropriately.
Introduction
While servicing your customers, regardless of your best efforts, customer questions or 
issues may arise. When they do, CRM's service module provides an excellent way to 
manage these cases. Along with managing customer's cases, Dynamics CRM allows an 
organization to create a knowledge base to track resolutions, and to help resolve future 
cases efficiently. Cases can be assigned to a queue for users to pick and choose which 
cases to work on, and in other instances, cases can be assigned to a team of users. All of 
these assignment functionalities help to drive collaboration and improve the visibility 
of cases at all levels of an organization. Often, service contracts are created between 
organizations and its customers. In such cases, CRM provides a way to manage those 
contracts. Finally, to complete the 360-degree view of the customer, users have the 
ability to analyze the data via various charts, dashboards, and reports.

Business scenarios
Race2Win Insurance Company has built up a significant customer base by providing 
valued products to its clients and building a brand that has credibility in the market. 
No matter how well things may go, there are always issues that may arise. An 
example is incorrect or late invoices. Race2Win would like to log these cases, have 
them routed to the appropriate people for resolution, and then create a repository of 
information to make solving future cases easier.
Furthermore, Race2Win started up a new division called the Race2Win Support 
Network to help provide customer service and support to all its clients. Race2Win's 
customers enter into a contractual agreement with the support network. Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM also provides a way to manage these contracts in order to allow 
support staff to refer to the conditions of a contract before providing service to  
a customer.
Lastly, to keep the customer base happy, it's critical that leadership has access to 
metrics and reports to track case resolution effectiveness. CRM provides charts, 
dashboards, and reports to help paint a 360-degree view of the customer.
The first step in managing customer service issues revolves around the Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM service module—namely, cases.
Managing service cases
Service cases can include anything from customer service issues such as late or 
incorrect invoices, poor quality of products and services, inadequate delivery of 
products and services, and so on. In this section, we'll explore the case management

Creating cases
To create a case, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM and go to the Services module in the left-hand navigation area.
2.	 Select Cases.
3.	 On the contextual ribbon, click on New.
4.	 Enter the following required fields:
°°
Title: A clear, concise description of the case. This field is required.
°°
Customer: The account or contact record against which the case is 
being logged.
°°
Owner: This defaults to the user creating the record, but can be 
changed. When an owner is assigned, the record also gets assigned to 
that user's default queue. Case and activity records are the only entity 
types this happens for.

Managing Service Management Applications
[ 200 ]
5.	 Although they are not required, the following fields are worth mentioning:
°°
Subject: A lookup to the subject tree. More on the subject tree will be 
discussed later.
°°
Contract: This field allows a user to tie a service contract to the case, 
for reference. A customer must first be selected in order to select a 
service contact.
°°
Contract Line: The case can be further tied to a specific contract line 
item, but a contract must first be selected in order to select this field.
6.	 Click on Save and Close.
Much like opportunities, cases can be created from an e-mail, as well as any activity 
record. To create a case from an activity record, perform the following steps (for this 
example, we shall use an e-mail activity record):
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Workplace module and then click on Activities, or open the 
Microsoft Office Outlook client for Dynamics CRM.
3.	 Open the e-mail that you wish to convert.
4.	 On the E-mail ribbon bar, in the Convert Activity group, click on To Case:
5.	 In the Convert E-mail to Case dialog box, enter the following fields:
°°
Customer: This field may auto-populate with the customer entered 
in the To line of the e-mail. Otherwise, the user must choose from an 
account or contact.
°°
Subject: This is optional and we'll talk more about the subject tree 
later on in this chapter.
°°
Open the new case: When this option is selected the newly created 
case record will be opened when the OK button is clicked.

Chapter 7
[ 201 ]
°°
Close the e-mail form: When this option is selected, the e-mail form 
is closed when the OK button is clicked.
6.	 Click on OK.
Once a case has been created, you'll notice the case number field is populated with an 
auto-generated case number. This case number is unique and helps an organization 
to track cases.
Business scenarios
Race2Win Insurance Company uses the case management functionality of Dynamics 
CRM to manage its cases. The organization's goal is to provide exemplary service 
and to resolve all cases in an accurate and timely manner. Unfortunately, over the 
past few months, cases haven't been resolved as quickly as customers would like. To 
fix this issue, Race2Win has implemented a new process of manager intervention. 
When a case goes unresolved for more than a certain period of time, an e-mail 
notification is automatically sent out to the case owner's manager and the case is then 
assigned to that manager.
As you can see, the assignment of cases can be a powerful tool. Most records in 
Dynamics CRM can be assigned to other users; however it is often more frequently 
used in case management.

Managing Service Management Applications
[ 202 ]
Assigning cases
To assign a case in Microsoft Dynamics CRM, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM
2.	 Navigate to the Service module, and then click on Cases.
3.	 Find and select the case or cases (you can assign multiple cases at one time) 
that you wish to assign.
4.	 On the Cases ribbon bar, in the Collaborate group, click on the  
Assign button.
5.	 In the Confirm Assignment dialog, you can assign the case to yourself or 
assign it to another user or team.
6.	 Click on OK.

Chapter 7
[ 203 ]
Connecting cases
In addition to assigning a case, cases can be connected to other records. Connecting 
records in Dynamics CRM allows a user to create relationships and apply a meaning 
to those relationships. For example, out of the box, a case is associated to or 
"connected" to a customer record (account or contact) via the customer field on the 
form. Let's say, however, that the case is also connected to another customer, either 
directly or indirectly. Microsoft Dynamics CRM allows you to connect the case to 
any other record in the system and to define the meaning of that relationship.
To connect a case to another record, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Service module on the left-hand navigation.
3.	 Find and select the case that you wish to connect. Unlike assigning a case, 
you can only connect one case at a time.
4.	 On the Cases ribbon bar, in the Collaborate group, click on the Connect button 
and choose whether to connect the case to yourself, or to another record.
5.	 Enter the following fields:
°°
Name: This is a lookup field that allows the selection of any record in 
your system
°°
As this role: There are system defined roles that can be selected, but a 
user can create their own roles
6.	 Click on Save and Close.

[ 204 ]
Creating a subject tree
During the creation of the cases, a subject can be associated to the case. The subject 
tree is a list of categories that an organization can use to help organize cases or other 
record types. The key word in the definition is tree, because subjects can be defined in 
a hierarchical manner. An example of a subject tree can be:
•	
Microsoft
°°
Dynamics
°°
CRM
°°
AX
°°
GP
°°
NAV
To add a new subject to the subject tree, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Settings module in the left-hand navigation area.
3.	 Under the Business section, click on Business Management.
4.	 Click on Subjects.
5.	 Click on Add a Subject.
6.	 In the Add Subject dialog box, enter the following information:
°°
Title: The only required field; enter a clear, concise name for the subject
°°
Parent Subject: This is optional, but if you enter it here, you can 
build the hierarchical subject tree, by attaching this new subject 
below the specified parent subject
°°
Description

Chapter 7
[ 205 ]
7.	 Click on OK.
To maintain the subject tree, you can go back to the same area in CRM and click on 
Edit Subject tree.
Adding case notes
On the case form, the second tab contains notes. Notes behave the same for cases as 
in any entity. They may be used more frequently here because multiple users may 
work on a case, and adding notes is one way to help communicate changes to the 
next case worker. Notes are date and time stamped, with the latest note appearing 
on top. Some examples of notes are steps taken to resolve a case, any notes about the 
customer, or any comments made by management about the case.
In addition to notes, like most other entities in Dynamics CRM, activities can  
be added to a case. One such activity type that may be used with a case is the 
recurring appointment.
Creating a recurring appointment
To create a recurring appointment, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Services module on the left-hand side and click on Cases.
3.	 Open the case record to which you wish to add the recurring appointment.
4.	 Click on Activities on the left-hand navigation of the case.
5.	 Click on New Activity and select Recurring Appointment.

Managing Service Management Applications
[ 206 ]
6.	 Enter the following required field:
°°
Subject: This is different than the subject tree mentioned earlier  
in this chapter. This is a clear, concise subject of the appointment 
being made.
7.	 On the Recurring Appointment ribbon bar, in the Scheduling group, click 
on the Recurrence button.

Resolving a case
When dealing with cases, the ultimate goal of any organization is case resolution. 
There is one caveat when resolving a case. Activities, as discussed in earlier chapters, 
can be used to track interactions between an organization and customer. This holds 
true for cases, but in addition, activities can be used to track time spent on a case. 
Often times the duration field on an activity is not used when relating it to entities in 
CRM. However, it becomes important when setting the regarding field to a case.
A case cannot be resolved if it has any activities that are not completed. If all of the 
activities are completed, then when resolving a case, the time spent on each activity 
is totaled up and added to the case.
To resolve a case, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Service module on the left-hand navigation, and click on 
Cases.
3.	 Select or open the case that you wish to resolve.
4.	 On the Cases ribbon bar, in the Actions group, click on Resolve Case.
5.	 In the Resolve Case dialog box, enter a resolution in the Resolution field. If 
there are activities tied to a case and the duration is set on those activities, the 
durations will be totaled up and placed in the Total Time field.

Chapter 7
[ 209 ]
6.	 Of the total time on activities, a user can say what portion of the time can be 
billed to the customer.
7.	 Click on OK.
Case views
No matter where you are in the process of working a case, it's critical to be able to get 
to the case records you need. This can be done by using intelligent views, and like 
many of the other entities in CRM, cases come with their own system views. Some of 
the system views that are pre-configured are:
•	
Active cases: Cases that are still open and have not been resolved or canceled
•	
Active cases opened in the last 7 days
•	
All cases: All cases, no matter the status
•	
Cases opened in the last 7 days
•	
Cases resolved by me in the last 7 days
•	
Cases resolved in the last 7 days
•	
My active cases: Open cases where the owner is the currently logged in user

Managing Service Management Applications
[ 210 ]
•	
My active cases opened in the last 7 Days
•	
My resolved cases: Resolved cases where the owner is the currently logged 
in user
•	
Resolved cases
Searching for cases
The case entity comes with a pre-configured view called the Quick Find view. This 
view is what is used when searching case records. By default, the fields configured to 
be searched are: Title and Case Number, but the view can be customized to include 
other fields.
System charts for cases
Similar to the other entities in Dynamics CRM, there is a chart pane to the right of 
many of the views. Users can access these charts and the data within the grid will be 
displayed. As you use the view filter and change views, or use the quick search to 
filter the data in the view, the chart will change to reflect the data present in the view.
Furthermore, users can drill down into the charts and perform analysis similar to 
that of pivot tables in Microsoft Excel. Charts can also be used to create dashboards, 
providing multiple visual representations of data in one place.
Managing the knowledge base
If an organization undertakes the effort to service their customers by using the 
case management module, one of its primary goals is to resolve cases quickly and 
effectively. A tool that can be very helpful is the knowledge base. The knowledge 
base is a location where users can search for articles to help them resolve cases. A 
unique functionality with knowledge base articles is that this is one of the only places  
in Dynamics CRM where a full-text search occurs.
In this section, we'll cover the following topics:
•	
Managing article templates
•	
Managing knowledge base articles
•	
Searching for knowledge base articles
•	
Associating an article with a case
All knowledge base articles must be created by using an article template. Let's look a 
bit closer into article templates.

Chapter 7
[ 211 ]
Knowledge base article templates
According to MSDN, a knowledge base template allows a user to describe the 
sections and formatting for the knowledge base article. There are four out-of-the 
box knowledge base templates that can be used as a baseline for others: Procedure, 
Question & Answer, Solution to a Problem, and Standard KB Article.
To create a knowledge base article template, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Settings module, and under the Business section, click on 
Templates, and then click on Article Templates.
3.	 On the Article Templates toolbar, click on New.
4.	 In the Article Template Properties dialog, enter the following  
required information:
°°
Title: A clear, concise name for the article template.
5.	 Click on OK.
6.	 In the right-hand navigation area, click on Add a Section.
7.	 In the Add a New Section dialog box, enter in the title and text for the section.
8.	 Click on OK.

Managing Service Management Applications
[ 212 ]
9.	 Repeat steps 6 to 8 to add more sections.
10.	 Once completed, click on Save and Close.
A sample of a knowledge base article template is shown as follows:
Knowledge base article templates are important, as knowledge base articles can't 
be created without them. An organization can choose to delete or deactivate article 
templates. A template can be deactivated even if there are articles created from the 
template; however no new articles can be created from an inactive template. You can 
only delete templates if there are no articles tied to that template.
Let's say you have many articles, based on a knowledge base template, in various 
stages of the publishing process. If you deactivate the knowledge base article template, 
all articles based on the deactivated template continue in the publishing process.
Managing knowledge base articles
To create knowledge base articles, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Service module, and then click on Articles.
3.	 On the Articles ribbon bar, in the Records group, click on New.
4.	 In the Article Template dialog, select a template to use.

Chapter 7
[ 213 ]
5.	 Click on OK.
6.	 Enter the following required fields:
°°
Title: A clear, concise title
°°
Subject: This is a required field to select the appropriate value from  
the CRM subject tree
7.	 Click on Save.

Managing Service Management Applications
[ 214 ]
Once a knowledge base article has been saved, it has a status of Draft. During this 
stage, the article can be edited as many times as one would like. Doing this also 
enables a button the ribbon bar called Submit. When the article is submitted, the 
new status of the article is Unapproved, which still allows you to edit the article, and 
the next step is to approve or reject the article. Once approved, the article status is 
Published, and it's available to the entire organization for viewing and for use. If the 
article is rejected, it goes back into Draft status and is available to be edited again.
In addition to creating and publishing knowledge base articles, users in an 
organization can add comments. Adding comments can help to track any changes to 
the article, or to provide notes for anyone using the article. Comments can only be 
added to unapproved or published articles.
Once an article template is created, and then an article created using this template, 
we can use the search functionality to find knowledge base articles.
Searching for knowledge base articles
The only way knowledge base articles are available for searching is when the article 
is published. To search for articles in the workplace, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Workplace module, and then click on Articles.
3.	 To find an article, enter text in the search box that is typically used for the 
quick find.
4.	 When clicking inside the text box, the CRM contextual ribbon changes.
5.	 Click on Start Search, or press the Enter key, to search for articles. The search 
criteria used from the ribbon will be explained next.
The types of searches that can be used are:
•	
Full Text Search: Searches all articles in the knowledge base for the text 
entered in the search field
•	
Keyword Search: Searches all article keywords for the text entered in the 
search area
•	
Title Search: Searches all article titles for the text entered in the search area
•	
Article Number Search: Searches articles for the auto number generated by 
Dynamics CRM

Chapter 7
[ 215 ]
•	
Subject Search: Search by subject tree
When created, found, and used, knowledge base articles provide an organization 
with a way to quickly search for answers—especially around solving cases. When 
solving a case, if a knowledge base article is used, it's best to reference it so if future 
similar cases are created, the same knowledge base article can be used to expedite the 
resolution process.
Associating knowledge base articles  
with cases
Associating a knowledge base article with a case begins by first searching for an 
article within a case. To associate an article with a case, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Service module, and then click on Cases.
3.	 Find and open the case to which you want to associate an article.
4.	 Navigate to the Notes and Articles section of the form.
5.	 Click on the Article lookup icon on the form.
6.	 Use the following search options:
°°
Search type: This can be Full Text, Keyword, Title, Article Number, 
or Subject Browse
°°
Search for: Enter the text to search for
°°
In subject: This is optional, and allows you to search by subject
°°
Options: Either an exact text search or use like words

Managing Service Management Applications
[ 216 ]
7.	 Click on View Article.
8.	 Select the article, and then click on OK.
The search functionality behaves similar to that of the searching for articles in  
the workplace. Once the article is associated, it can be e-mailed to the customer  
quite easily as well. This is an added bonus of associating a knowledge base article  
to a case.
Managing queues and teams
Queues and teams provide a way of managing work for various individuals across 
organizations. While they can be used in most places in Dynamics CRM, they're 
mentioned more often in connection with the service module.

Chapter 7
[ 217 ]
Business scenarios
Race2Win Insurance Company has a business dedicated to the support of its clients. 
In order to service their clients effectively, Race2Win has employed the use of the 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM service module. With Dynamics CRM, they can open up 
cases for any issues a customer may have. To help resolve the case effectively, they 
have various business rules around routing cases to different departments to be 
worked on. The organization has various teams to handle a case based on the type of 
case opened. Let's say a case has been opened because of a billing question. Using the 
power of Dynamics CRM workflows, as soon as a case is created with a type Billing, 
the case is routed or assigned to the billing queue. From there, folks in the billing 
department can retrieve cases to be worked on.
Managing queues
When a user or team is created, a default queue is automatically created. A queue 
can also have an e-mail address. A use case of this would be a queue having an 
e-mail address that is actually a distribution list of a team. Let's say a case is created 
and assigned to a queue. Dynamics CRM workflow can automatically send an e-mail 
to the e-mail address associated with the queue, letting them know that an item has 
been added to the queue. If this e-mail address is a distribution list for the team, then 
everyone on the team will get notified.
Also by default, only activities and cases can be assigned to a queue. To enable the 
use of queues for other entities, you'll need to configure this in the customizations 
section of an entity.
The following points will be discussed:
•	
Creating queues
•	
Deleting and deactivating queues
•	
Adding cases and activities to queues
•	
Routing
•	
Managing queue items
Creating queues
To create a queue, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Settings module, and under the Business section, click on 
Business Management, and then click on Queues.

Managing Service Management Applications
[ 218 ]
3.	 On the Queues toolbar, click on New.
4.	 Enter the following required fields:
°°
Queue Name: A clear, concise name for the queue
°°
Owner: Defaults to user creating queue
°°
Convert to e-mail activities: Options are All e-mail messages, E-mail 
messages in response to CRM e-mail, E-mail messages from CRM 
Leads, Contacts and Accounts, and E-mail messages from CRM 
records that are e-mail enabled
°°
E-mail access type Incoming: Options are None, E-mail Router, and 
Forward Mailbox
°°
E-mail access type Outgoing: Options are None, E-mail Router, and 
Forward Mailbox
5.	 Click on Save and Close.
Deleting and deactivating queues
There are various rules when deleting or deactivating queues. When a queue is 
deactivated, all queue items are removed from the queue. A queue cannot be  
deleted if it contains queue items. In addition to these rules, a queue can be 
deactivated or deleted at any time. When a queue is active, cases and activities  
can be assigned to a queue.

Chapter 7
[ 219 ]
Adding activities and cases to queues
To add activities or cases to a queue, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Workplace module and then click on Activities, or navigate 
to the Service module and then click on Cases.
3.	 Select one or more activities or cases.
4.	 On the Activities or Cases ribbon bar, in the Collaborate group, click on  
Add to Queue.
5.	 In the Add to Queue dialog box, find the queue to which you wish to  
add the items.
6.	 Click on OK.
Routing
Routing provides a way for users to route or change the location of a record from 
one queue to another. As stated earlier, when a case or another record is added to a 
queue, a queue item is created which is associated to a queue and to the record. To 
route a queue item from one queue to another, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Workplace module, and click on Queues.
3.	 Select one or more queue items. You can use the queue filter to view a single 
queue that you're interested in.
4.	 On the Queue Items ribbon bar, in the Actions group, click on Routing.

Managing Service Management Applications
[ 220 ]
5.	 Look up a queue to route the items to.
6.	 Click on OK.
Managing queue items
As stated earlier, when a record is assigned to a queue, a queue item is created. The 
queue item contains a Worked By field, which is the user or team that is working on 
the particular queue item. If a queue item is deleted, the record associated with the 
queue item is also deleted, so be careful when doing this.
When a user or team wants to work on a particular queue item, they can select the 
item and click on the Work On button. Doing this does not change the ownership of 
the record, but rather just the Worked By field.
Managing teams
Teams are a new concept introduced to Dynamics CRM 2011 that allows an 
organization to group individuals and assign to those groups records within the 
system. A couple of interesting notes:
•	
A team may have a security role assigned to it. Any team member (user) will 
inherit the team's security. If no security role is assigned to a team, then that 
team cannot be assigned any records.
•	
Like other part of Dynamics CRM when it comes to security, the highest 
privilege wins. That is, if a user has a security role and the team has a 
security role, when performing an action, the highest privilege wins, 
regardless of whether that is defined on the user or on the team.
•	
Teams can be deleted where as users cannot. However, a team can only be 
deleted if there are no records assigned to it.
•	
Teams are one way in which users from different business units can interact  
with a record. For example, let's say you have a user in Business Unit A,  
and a user in Business Unit B. The user in Business Unit A can read all 
accounts, while a user in Business Unit B cannot. If both users were assigned 
the same team with permission to read accounts assigned to them, and an 
account record was assigned their team, then both users would be able to 
read the record.

Managing contracts
Contracts are a way to define the types of service agreement that an organization 
might enter into with a customer. Contracts, when used with cases, can be referenced 
in order to see if the service being performed is in line with the agreed upon terms of 
the contract.
Business scenarios
Race2Win Insurance Company has entered into a service agreement with one of 
its clients to provide up to 40 hours of support every week for the next month. The 
terms of the service are that any case created will be worked on within 24 hours and, 
if it's a high priority item, the case will be worked on within 1 hour. Race2Win can 
leverage Microsoft Dynamics CRM contract functionality to help track these contract 
obligations. Race2Win can tie contracts to cases as they work on them, to make sure 
that the hours are used appropriately.
Contracts in Dynamics CRM consist of contract templates, which are used to create 
contracts, and then each contact can have one or more contract lines.
Creating a contract template
Much like knowledge base articles, contracts can only be created by using contract 
templates. To create a contract template, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Settings module, and under the Business section, click on 
Templates, and then click on Contract Templates.
3.	 Click on New.
4.	 Enter the following required fields:

°°
Allotment Type: Indicates how the contract will be tracked—either by 
number of cases, time, or coverage dates. For example, if the allotment 
type is number of cases, then every case opened up referencing this 
contract will be subtracted from the total cases allotted.
°°
Calendar: Used to indicate the days and times of the week during 
which the service is available.

Once the record has been saved, the contract ID is automatically generated, the status 
is set to Draft, and the duration of the contract is automatically set as the difference  
in days between the contract start and end dates.
According to Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 documentation (http://msdn.
microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb959312.aspx), the contract has the  
following statuses:
•	
Draft: This means that the contract can still be worked on, but it cannot be 
associated to a case.
•	
Invoiced: Once a contract is saved, the default status is Draft. The contextual 
ribbon now displays a button to invoice the contract. This can only be done 
if contract lines have been created. Once a contract is in the invoiced state, it 
cannot be edited or deleted.
•	
Active: The next stage in the contract life cycle is Active. A contract will 
automatically be set to active when the start date of the contract equals 
today's date. This is the only status that allows a contract to be associated to a 
case. A contract with this status cannot be edited or deleted.
•	
OnHold: Once a contract has been activated, it can be placed on hold at any 
time. Once on hold, the contract cannot be edited or deleted.
•	
Canceled
•	
Expired: Once the end date of the contract has been reached, the contract 
status automatically gets changed to expired.
As mentioned, a contract cannot have its status changed from Draft to Invoiced until 
contract lines are created for the contract.
Creating contract lines
To create a contract line, perform the following steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Service module, and then click on Contracts.
3.	 Find and open the contract to which you wish to add lines.
4.	 On the left-hand navigation of the record, click on Contract Lines.
5.	 On the List Tools tab of the Contract Lines ribbon bar, in the Records group, 
click on Add New Contract Line.
6.	 Enter the following required fields:
°°
Title: A clear, concise title for the contract line.
°°
Start Date: Defaults from the contract, but can be changed.

Chapter 7
[ 227 ]
°°
End Date: Defaults from the contract, but can be changed.
°°
Total Case/Minutes: Enter the total amount of minutes that can be 
used to solve the cases.
°°
Total Price: Amount of money that is being charged to the customer 
for the service. This can be zero.
7.	 Click on Save and Close.
Once a contract line item has been added, the contact can be invoiced. Once the 
contract status has been set to invoiced, the status will change automatically to active 
once the contract start date has been reached.
Once a contract has been set to active, it can be associated to cases. Contracts can also 
be placed on hold or canceled.
Contract actions
Once a contract has been set to active, it can be associated to cases. The Dynamics 
CRM contextual ribbon also changes, enabling actions to taken on the contract.

Managing Service Management Applications
[ 228 ]
As you can see, a contract can be copied, placed on hold, renewed, or even canceled, 
once it is active. The Set Calendar option allows a user to add the contract dates to 
be added to the service calendar for viewing. To recalculate the allotment values 
used, or the total prices, click on the Recalculate button.
Analysis and reporting
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 comes with some canned reports specifically related 
to service management. If a user goes to the reporting area in Dynamics CRM, and 
filters the list of reports by service reports, the following will be displayed:
•	
Account overview
•	
Case summary table
•	
Neglected cases
•	
Service activity volume
•	
Top knowledge base articles
Account overview
This report displays an overview of one or more accounts. It gives a summary of 
account, primary contact, additional contacts, opportunities, activities, and any 
cases tied to the account. Specifically around cases, it gives a summary of the level of 
satisfaction of the cases resolved, and the reasons for the cases.
Case summary
This report displays a report grouped by various factors. The horizontal and vertical 
groupings can be selected via drop-downs on the report. There's also an option for a 
second set of groupings. Once displayed, the report displays counts and percentages 
for the groupings. For example, let's say a user wants to group the case data by 
owner and priority. This can give someone within an organization a count of all 
cases by priority or by owner.
Neglected cases
This report displays all cases that have not been updated, or have had no new 
activities added within a certain period of time (defined in the report). This gives  
the user running the report possible insights into cases that might be "neglected".

Chapter 7
[ 229 ]
Service activity volume
This report shows a list of all service activities and their durations. The report is 
grouped by services and time periods.
Top knowledge base articles
This report displays the most commonly-used knowledge base articles, grouped by 
subject, or grouped by the case, or grouped by the product associated with the case.
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 also provides charts to help visualize this data. Like 
any other entity in the system, the charts are based on views for each entity. These 
charts can be used to create dashboards. Dynamics CRM has an out of the box 
service management dashboard.
Customer service operations dashboard
The customer service operations dashboard gives a visualization of activities by 
owner, a chart of the leaders when it comes to solving cases, a list of unpublished 
dashboards, a chart of cases by origin, and a chart of cases by priority.
Customer service performance dashboard
This dashboard displays the leadership board in terms of solving cases, a trending 
chart of cases resolved by day, a chart on the progress of goals for cases, and a chart 
of knowledge base articles by status.
Customer service representative dashboard
This last system dashboard displays charts of cases owned by the current user, 
illustrating cases by origin, cases by priority, a trending chart of cases resolved  
by day, and the chart of case goals.

Summary
This chapter provided insight into the service management module in Dynamics 
CRM 2011. We delved into case management, including creating, assigning, and 
connecting cases. The subject tree is a list of categories that an organization can use 
to help organize cases or other record types. A subject can be associated to a case in 
order to help categorize it for reporting or searching purposes. Adding notes to a 
case can be important if multiple users work on a case. Some examples of notes are 
steps taken to resolve a case, any notes about the customer, or any comments made 
by management about the case.
Resolving cases is the ultimate goal of any organization managing cases. Whatever 
state a case is in, CRM provides out of the box views to help access case data quickly 
and efficiently. Charts can visually represent data in a view, and as you filter data in 
a view, the chart will change to display the filtered data.
To assist users, the knowledge base is a location where users can search for articles 
to help them resolve cases. Knowledge base articles cannot be created without using 
a knowledge base article template. CRM provides unique search functionality on 
knowledge base articles giving users four options: Full Text, Keyword, Title, and 
Article Number searches.
Queues are a way for users to divide up work within its workforce. Specifically for 
cases, it provides a place for cases to be routed, and systematically be worked on in a 
given order. When a case is added to a queue, a queue item is created and associated 
to the case and the queue. When a queue is deactivated, all queue items are removed 
from the queue, but this does not mean that the case is deleted. A queue cannot be 
deleted if it contains queue items. Teams can also be used to help collaborate when it 
comes to servicing customers.
The service management module also consists of service contracts. Contracts help to 
track service agreements between an organization and its customers. One example 
of a service contract is if an organization agrees to service a customer by giving the 
customer a limited number of cases per year. CRM can be used to track the number 
of cases created against a service contract. Finally, the service module provides 
out of the box reports and dashboards to assist an organization in analyzing and 
visualizing service related data.
In the next chapter, we'll cover service scheduling. Service scheduling enables  
an organization to manage and schedule resources to help service customers.  
For example, if a facility, equipment, or even people, are needed to service a 
customer, CRM can help manage those resources to make sure they're used 
effectively and efficiently.

Managing Service  
Scheduling Applications
In this chapter you will cover the following topics:
•	
Introduction to service scheduling
•	
Setting up service scheduling
•	
Scheduling service activities
•	
Report and analyze service activities
Just when you thought Microsoft Dynamics CRM can do everything for your 
organization from marketing to sales to service, the trend continues. Hopefully by 
now, you've learned how CRM can help to expand an organization's customer base 
by using the marketing module, to track opportunities, and sell products and services 
by using the sales module, and log cases by using the service module. The last piece 
of out of the box or "vanilla" CRM functionality is in regards to service scheduling.
If cases require resource allocation, CRM's scheduling engine provides a way to 
manage resources, equipment, and even facilities, in order to help deliver on service 
requests. Let's look at an introduction into service scheduling.
Introduction to service scheduling
There are a number of key terms important to understand before proceeding:
•	
Service is a type of work that is delivered to a customer and performed 
by one or more resources. For example, equipment repair, health services, 
legal services, and accounting services. To define a service, enter general 
information about that service, identify the resources needed, and then input 
these requirements into a selection rule.

Managing Service Scheduling Applications
[ 234 ]
•	
Resources are people, facilities, and equipment that are used in delivering 
services. Individual resources have a work schedule that defines when they 
are available to work.
•	
Resource Groups are pools of similar resources that can carry out a given 
service. These resources are thought to be interchangeable.
•	
Sites are locations where service operations take place.
•	
Capacity Scheduling is used to consider different sized facilities or users' 
skill levels when setting up services and resources. An example would be a 
senior technician that can repair two copy machines in the same time that 
it takes a junior technician to repair one, or a clinic that has five patient 
examining rooms where another clinic may have eight.
•	
Effort defined in a selection rule reduces that resources capacity when they 
are scheduled to deliver that particular service.
•	
Selection Rule is the list of people, facilities, or equipment needed to carry 
out a service. Each service needs a selection rule.
•	
Selection Criteria helps you determine how resource's should be allocated. 
An example is if you want to have one technician completely scheduled 
before another technician is scheduled. Or maybe on the other hand you 
want all technicians to be scheduled evenly.
Business scenarios
Race2Win Insurance Company has a wide range of insurance products. They insure 
everything from corporations to homes and automobiles. In situations such as a 
natural disaster, Race2Win has a division that handles the processing of claims by 
their customers. They have a whole customer service division dedicated to this effort. 
Coordinating claims processing, especially during times of natural disasters, can be 
challenging as multiple people, with different skills sets, and who work different 
shifts, may be needed along with the use of various equipment, all at different 
customer sites. There are numerous service scheduling scenarios that can make 
servicing a customer challenging for Race2Win.
Service scheduling scenarios
There are four service scheduling scenarios that can be applied in CRM:
•	
Individual scenario
•	
Different skills and shifts
•	
Different skills, shifts, equipment, and sites
•	
Different skills, equipment, and sites

Chapter 8
[ 235 ]
Individual scenario
This is the most simple/basic example of service scheduling. In this scenario, 
Dynamics CRM can schedule one individual to meet with a customer. For example, 
let's say a client of Race2Win Insurance Company raised an issue with a duplicate 
bill being sent. Race2Win can offer someone from the billing department to go to the 
client site, meet with the person that raised the issue, and resolve it.
Different skills and shifts
The next scenario is where you might have individuals with different skill sets that 
work different shifts. For example, Race2Win Insurance Company has a disaster 
relief insurance claims team made up of adjustors, building architects, corporate 
policy specialists, and auto claims adjustors. They all work with another division 
of Race2Win to provide customer support. The adjustors, architects, auto, and 
corporate policy specialists have different skill sets. Also, these resources may work 
during various shifts throughout the day to support Race2Win's customers.
Different skills, equipment, and sites
This scenario entails individuals with different skill sets, needing to use different 
equipment, at different sites. For example, Race2Win Insurance Company needs to 
service a customer that has multiple locations. They might schedule a team to go out 
to these sites, and at each of these sites, the use of specialized computers, hardware, 
or software might be necessary.
Different skills, shifts, equipment, and sites
This final scenario is where you might have people with different skills, working in 
different shifts that may need to use different equipments at different sites. Using the 
example from above, Race2Win has a disaster relief insurance team that goes to areas 
hard hit by natural disasters to assess damages and provide support in processing 
insurance claims. These teams may be made up of architects, auto and building  
policy specialists, as well as people entrenched in the disaster recovery efforts.  
These people may work on various teams during various shifts, as well as utilize 
different equipment such as computers and heavy machinery. Since natural disasters 
may occur all over the world, these support teams may need to be deployed to 
different sites.

Selection rules
As stated earlier, every service requires a selection rule, which is a way to define  
how a resource, facility and/or equipment can be used to perform the service.  
The selection rule comprises of the following components:
•	
Resource: Which and how many resources are required to complete  
the service.
•	
Selection Criteria: The resource can be scheduled as least busy, most busy, 
or randomly. A least busy criteria means that the resource with the most 
availability will be scheduled first; most busy will mean that an individual 
that has the least availability (until they are no longer available) will be 
scheduled first; and randomly will schedule the resources on a random basis.
•	
Selection Site: Whether the resource should be scheduled at the same site or 
another location.
Given the scheduling scenarios and selection rules, one other major component of 
service scheduling is service activities.
Service activities
A service activity is like any other activity in Dynamics CRM; however it's 
specifically related to service scheduling. Think of it as an appointment activity,  
but it's related to a service. It can be associated to one or more customers, and 
resources (user, equipment, and facility).
Another interesting aspect of the service activity is when the service activity is 
scheduled; the Microsoft Dynamics CRM scheduling engine can automatically  
assign the best resource based on the selection rules setup.
Now that you're familiar with some key terms and concepts regarding service 
scheduling, the next step is to look at how to set it all up.
Setting up service scheduling
When setting up a service and scheduling it, the following steps may be involved:
•	
Setting up work hours
•	
Setting up business closures
•	
Setting up time off
•	
Setting up capacity scheduling
•	
Creating facilities and equipment

Chapter 8
[ 237 ]
•	
Creating a site
•	
Creating a service
•	
Creating resource groups
•	
Configuring customer service preferences
The first task to complete before setting up any service, is to make sure that every 
resource's (user, facility/equipment) work hours are set up. If this is not set up, an 
error will appear when scheduling the service. Note that all of the setup instructions 
shown in this section assume service scheduling is being set up for a resource that is 
a user. The same steps can be applied to facilities or equipment.
Setting up work hours
To set up work hours, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Settings module, and under the System section, click on 
Administration, then on Users.
3.	 Open the user record that you wish to configure working hours for.
4.	 On the left-hand navigation, under the Common section, click on Work Hours.

Managing Service Scheduling Applications
[ 238 ]
5.	 In the calendar view, if you click once on a day, it will highlight the day in 
red (as shown above). To edit the schedule for the day, double-click on the 
entry shown in the day (in the case above, double-click on Cross Day).
6.	 Select one of the following options:
i.	
This date only: Edit the user's schedule for the current day.
ii.	 From <date> onward: Edit the user's schedule from the current 
date going forward.
iii.	 Entire recurring weekly schedule from start to end: Start from 
1/1/2000 going forward.
7.	 Click on OK.
8.	 Depending on the option that you chose in step 6, a new window will appear 
that allows you to set up work hours for the given day or time period.

Chapter 8
[ 239 ]
9.	 The next screenshot illustrates setting up work hours for a single day. You 
can add your work schedule here, along with any planned breaks, such as  
for lunch.
10.	 Enter the following fields:
i.	
Work Hours
ii.	 Add Break: Add a break if necessary, for example, add a one 
hour break for lunch.
iii.	 Time Zone
The time zone here is important here as it affects service 
activity scheduling. Imagine a resource in one time zone 
needing to service a customer in another. In order for the 
schedule to accurately reflect the times at which a resource is 
available for service, the time zone needs to be correctly set.
iv.	 Service Restrictions: The service restrictions tab allows a user to 
enter a time period during which a particular service for a given 
day(s) is restricted.

Managing Service Scheduling Applications
[ 240 ]
11.	 The next screenshot illustrates setting up work hours for more than one day. 
Enter the following fields:
i.	
Work Hours: Set to be either the same for each day of the week, 
to vary by day, which will show values for each day where you 
can configure different times for each day, or none to indicate the 
user/resource is not working.
ii.	 Work Days: Which days of the week the resource is considered 
working. If "None" is selected in work hours, this option  
becomes disabled.
iii.	 Business Closures: If you wish the user to be off during business 
closures, click observe.
iv.	 Time Zone: You can set a time zone for the working hours of  
the resource.
12.	 Click on Save and Close to close the schedule.
13.	 On the User ribbon, in the Save group, click on Save and Close to close the 
user record.
Work hours play an integral role when scheduling service for a customer. These 
hours help to define availability for a resource to perform a scheduled service. For 
example, a person can be scheduled to work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. one day and 
then the next day they can be scheduled to work from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.. If a service 
appointment for a customer is going to last for two days, and the customer can only 
allow access to a site from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., then this person may not be the right 
resource to service the customer.

Chapter 8
[ 241 ]
Setting up business closures
To set up a business closure (a date and time the business may be closed, for 
example, a business holiday), follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Settings module, in the Business section, click  
Business Management.
3.	 Click on Business Closures.
4.	 On the Business Closures toolbar, click on New.
5.	 Enter the name of the business closure, Start Time, and End Time.
6.	 Click on OK.
If appointments or service activities have already been scheduled, they will not be 
changed. However, you can use the Show Conflicts button on the Service Calendar 
to highlight appointments and service activities that have scheduling conflicts (this 
will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter). During this time, no new 
service activities can be scheduled unless resources have the Do not observe option 
selected in their Work Hours configuration.

Managing Service Scheduling Applications
[ 242 ]
Setting up time off
You can schedule a period of time during a schedule when a resource is not available 
to be scheduled for a service activity. An example is if a user is on vacation, or a 
facility or equipment had a failure. To set up time off, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Settings module, and under the System section, click on 
Administration, then Users.
3.	 Open the user record for which you wish to configure the working hours.
4.	 On the left-hand navigation, under the Common section, click on Work Hours.
5.	 Select a date on the calendar.
6.	 On the Work Hours toolbar, click on Set Up and then select Time Off.
7.	 In the Schedule Time Off dialog, enter the following:
i.	
Reason: This is a free text field where you can enter text such as 
PTO or Sick.
ii.	 Start Time
iii.	 End Time
iv.	 All Day Event: If this is unchecked, users are given the option to 
enter a time.

Chapter 8
[ 243 ]
v.	 Duration
vi.	 Time Zone
8.	 Click on OK.
After this is set, the working hours calendar shows the time off as a red block, and 
the service calendar displays the time as a white block. Setting up time off prevents 
any service activities from being scheduled for the resource during that time period.
Setting up capacity scheduling
Capacity is used to determine how many services a resource can perform at one 
time. For example, if an insurance agent of Race2Win is working with an adjustor to 
process a claim for a customer the agent may only be able to do one claim at a time. 
In that case the capacity would be one. Now let's say Race2Win Insurance Company 
has a fleet of cars that it provides to its sales people. It may have a facility to help 
service these vehicles. In this case, the facility might have a much larger capacity.
In order to use capacity scheduling, the resource must have a capacity defined, and 
the selection rule for a service must define a minimum capacity level.
Defining resource capacity
To set the capacity for a resource, follow the steps outlined below:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Settings module, and under the System section, click on 
Administration, then Users.
3.	 Open the user record for which you wish to configure capacity scheduling.
4.	 In the left-hand navigation pane, under the Common section, click on  
Work Hours.
5.	 In the Edit Weekly Schedule dialog box, select the appropriate option.
6.	 Click on OK.

Managing Service Scheduling Applications
[ 244 ]
7.	 In the Work Day dialog box, click on Show Capacity, and then in the 
Capacity column, enter the capacity.
8.	 Click on OK.
9.	 Click on Save and Close.
Defining service capacity
To set up a service capacity, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Service module, and click on Services.
3.	 Select and open the service record that you wish to modify.
4.	 Navigate to the Required Resources part of the form.
5.	 Double-click on the Selection Rule to modify it.
6.	 In the Edit a Selection Rule dialog box, expand the Scheduling  
Details section.
7.	 Enter the Capacity Required.
8.	 Click on OK.
9.	 Click on Save and Close.

Creating facilities and equipment
To create a facility/equipment record, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Settings module, and then in the Business section, click on 
Business Management.
3.	 Click on Facilities/Equipment.
4.	 On the Facilities/Equipment toolbar, click on New.
5.	 Enter the following required fields:
i.	
Name: A clear, concise name for the facility or equipment.
ii.	 Business Unit: This will default to the primary business unit.
iii.	 Time Zone: Enter the time zone that the facility is in or 
equipment is being stored in or used at.
6.	 Click on Save and Close.
The site field is a lookup on the facility/equipment record, but is worth mentioning, 
as a facility or equipment can be associated to a site (as stated earlier, a site is the 
physical location at which the service can be stored or performed).
Creating a site
To create a site, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Settings module, and then in the Business section, click on  
Business Management.

ii.	 Time Zone
6.	 Click on Save.
7.	 In the left-hand navigation pane, you can associate various users to a site. For 
example, if you have a warehouse site, you can associate a number of users, 
teams, facilities/equipment, or resource groups to this site. This is optional, 
however, it's required when your resource selection rules are site-specific.
8.	 Click on Save and Close.
Creating a service
A service in CRM is a type of work that is delivered to a customer and performed by 
one or more resources. To create a service record, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Service module, and then click on Services.

Chapter 8
[ 247 ]
3.	 On the Services ribbon bar, in the Records group, click on New.
4.	 Enter in the following required information:
i.	
Name: A clear, concise description of the service.
ii.	 Initial Status Reason: This is the status of the service when 
initially booked.
iii.	 Default Duration: This determines how long the service will  
last by default.
iv.	 Start Activities: The frequency with which new activities can  
be started.

Managing Service Scheduling Applications
[ 248 ]
5.	 For each service, the selection rule (the rule that defines how the resource is 
used to perform the service) must be defined. By default, the selection rule is 
set to The same site, which means that the resource will be used to perform 
the service at the same site at which the resource is located.
6.	 Select the Quantity link.
7.	 Enter the following required fields:
i.	
Quantity
ii.	 While Selection Site is not required, it's defaulted to The same 
site. You can also choose Any site.
8.	 Click on OK.
9.	 Click on the next line to add a Resource, Resource Group (this will be 
explained later), or another Selection Rule.
10.	 A dialog is displayed to select one or more users, facilities, or equipment.
11.	 You can use the left-hand pane to add more selection rules or resources.
12.	 Click on Save and Close.

Chapter 8
[ 249 ]
Creating resource groups
While creating a site, you might have noticed an option when creating the service 
to create a resource group. A resource group is a way to group resources by a set of 
criteria; for example, skill sets.
To create a resource group, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Settings module, and under the Business section, click on 
Business Management.
3.	 Click on Resource Groups.
4.	 On the Resource Groups toolbar, click on New.
5.	 Enter the following required fields:
i.	
Name: A name for the resource group.
ii.	 Business Unit: This will be pre-populated with the default 
business unit.
6.	 Click on Save.

8.	 Click on Add Resources, and add one or more users, teams,  
facilities, equipment, or even other resource group records.
9.	 Click on Save and Close.
Configuring customer service preferences
Customer service preferences are configured on a customer record (an account or 
contact). To configure a customer's service preferences, follow these steps:
1.	 Start CRM.
2.	 Navigate to the Workplace module, and then under Customers, click either 
on Accounts or Contacts.
3.	 In the view, select and open either an account or contact record.

[ 250 ]
4.	 Navigate to the Preferences tab of the form.
5.	 Under the Service Preferences section, you can set the following fields:
i.	
Preferred Day: Choose the day of the week on which the 
customer prefers servicing. 
ii.	 Preferred Time: Choose from Morning, Afternoon, or Evening.
iii.	 Preferred Service: Select the preferred service activity that the 
customer usually wants to schedule.
iv.	 Preferred Facility/Equipment: Select the preferred facility  
or equipment.
v.	 Preferred User: A lookup to select the preferred CRM user to 
service the customer.
6.	 Click on Save and Close.
When creating a service activity from a customer record, these preferences will be 
copied to the service activity, to make creating activities easier. Also, when services 
are scheduled by using the Dynamics CRM scheduling engine, these preferences are 
taken into account.
Scheduling service activities
Service activities are scheduled for a specific time, can include a site, can be tied to 
one or more customers, and can include one or more resources. Once the activity 
is created, a user can trigger what is called the service scheduling engine. The 
scheduling engine gives the user the best option of resources to complete the given 
service. The scheduling engine looks at the service preferences of the customer, the 
schedules defined for the resources, and the selection rule for the service.
The first step to schedule service activities is to create service activities.

Using the scheduling engine
As discussed earlier, the scheduling engine can help to schedule resources, taking 
into account customer service preferences, resource schedules and service selection 
criteria. To launch the scheduling engine from within a service activity record,  
follow these steps:
1.	 On the Service Activity ribbon, in the Actions group, click on Schedule.
2.	 Enter the following information:
i.	
Customers: This should be pre-populated from the service 
activity record.
ii.	 Service: This should be pre-populated with the service  
activity record.
iii.	 Resources
iv.	 Sites
v.	 Start Date: This is the option to choose as soon as possible, for a 
specific date, or by date range.

Chapter 8
[ 253 ]
vi.	 Start Time: This is the option to choose any time, a specific time, 
or a range of times.
vii.	Duration
viii.	Use Default Duration: This will use the default duration of  
the service.
3.	 Click on Find Available Times.
4.	 A list of available times will be displayed, given the service and resource.  
You can select one or more resources, and then click on Schedule.
Managing service activities
Using the CRM service calendar can aid in displaying scheduling conflicts, 
rescheduling service activities, changing statuses, and making general modifications.
Service calendar
The service calendar allows an organization to view a high-level view of service 
activities by day, week, or month. It's also another place to create new appointments 
and to manage service activities. Lastly, it's the ideal place to look for conflicts in a 
service schedule.

Managing Service Scheduling Applications
[ 254 ]
The service calendar has various search and filtering options. You can search for 
a specific record in the calendar, filter by record type (appointment and service 
activity, service activity, appointment, resource, user, or facility/equipment). When 
the type filter is set, the view filter will automatically change.
Using the calendar, new service activities can be created by going to the Service 
Calendar ribbon, and clicking on Service Activity in the New group, or by clicking 
on the Schedule button in the Actions group. The difference is that if a user clicks on 
the Schedule button, the user will be directed to the CRM scheduling engine. Other 
actions can be taken to manage the service activities as well.
Displaying scheduling conflicts
When a service activity is scheduled, an alert will indicate a potential conflict. Users 
can choose to select another time, or to save the service activity anyway. At any time, 
users can identify service activities or appointments with conflicts by clicking the 
Conflicts on the Actions toolbar on the Service Calendar ribbon. The conflicts will 
be highlighted in red.
Rescheduling activities
From the service calendar, a user can open the service activity and reschedule it by 
changing the date and time of the service activity. The other option is selecting the 
service activity on the calendar itself, going to the Service Calendar ribbon, and then 
in the Actions group clicking on the Reschedule button. Doing this will direct the 
user to the CRM scheduling engine to assist with rescheduling the activity.
Changing activity status
To change the status of an activity, a user can select the service activity in the 
calendar, and then go to the Service Calendar ribbon, and then in the Actions group 
click on the Change Status button. An example use case is if users wanted to cancel 
or mark the service activity as completed, then they can do so from the calendar. The 
other option is to open the activity itself and to do one of the following:
•	
Mark the service activity complete: a user can click on the Mark Complete 
button on the Service Activity ribbon in the Save Group.
•	
Change the status of the service activity: a user can click on the Close Service 
Activity button on the Service Activity ribbon, in the Actions group. This gives 
the user the option to set the status to Completed, Canceled, or No Show.

Chapter 8
[ 255 ]
Reporting on service activities
Out of the box, Dynamics CRM provides a service activity volume report. The service 
activity volume report can be run from the view of reports, or from the view of cases, 
on the Cases ribbon bar in the Data group, by clicking on the Run Report button, 
and then selecting the report. It's important to note that no out of the box charts are 
available. However charts and other reports can be created, as noted in Chapter 3, 
Managing Marketing Automation Applications – Marketing Lists and Campaigns.
Service activity volume report
The following screenshot illustrates the service activity volume report. This report 
displays Subject, Scheduled Start, Scheduled End, Duration, Service Name, and 
Status Reason of the service activities in a table format for the last twelve months. 
The filter criteria for this report can be changed. For example, if you want to display 
service activities for the last six months instead of twelve.
The other option is for the report to display a bar chart of the total number of 
activities by month. The report can also be grouped by user, facility or equipment, 
service, site, customer, and status reason. The service activity volume report is a 
great way to get a high-level picture of the volume of service requests being created, 
scheduled, and completed. This can help an organization to determine if the proper 
resources are being allocated to service their customers.

Summary
Service scheduling allows an organization to allocate the proper resources to help 
service their customers. Service is a type of work that is delivered to a customer  
and performed by one or more resources. For example, equipment repair, health 
services, legal, or accounting services. It's important to understand service 
scheduling terminology, such as resources, resource groups, sites, capacity 
scheduling, selection rules, and selection criteria. All of the aforementioned 
components may be needed when scheduling services for a customer. CRM helps  
to tackle four major scheduling scenarios:
•	
Individual scenario
•	
Different skills and shifts
•	
Different skills, shifts, equipment, and sites
•	
Different skills, equipment, and sites
A service activity is like any other activity, but it is related to a service. It can be 
associated to one or more customers, and resources (user, equipment, and facility). 
Setting up service scheduling entails the following potential tasks:
•	
Setting up work hours, business closures, time off, and capacity scheduling
•	
Creating facilities and/or equipment
•	
Creating a site and/or service
•	
Creating resource groups
•	
Configuring customer service preferences

Chapter 8
[ 259 ]
Work hours are configured per resource and indicates the times at which a resource 
is available to work. Configuring business closures for the organization and time off 
for users helps an organization to understand for which hours or days a resource 
may be unavailable for service. Capacity is used to determine how many services 
a resource can perform at one time. Configured capacity is two fold: one on the 
resource to define how many service activities the resource can perform during work 
hours, and one, on the service to define how many resources can perform the service 
at one time. A resource group is a way to group resources by a set of criteria—for 
example, skill sets. Lastly, as part of the setup involved in service scheduling, 
customer service preferences can play a role, especially when the scheduling  
engine is involved.
Service activities are scheduled for a specific time, can include a site, can be tied to 
one or more customers, and can include one or more resources. To assist with the 
scheduling of service activities, the scheduling engine takes into account customer 
service preferences, resource schedules, and service selection criteria to display a list 
of potential resources. Using the CRM service calendar can help users to schedule 
appointments, display scheduling conflicts, reschedule activities, and change the 
status of service activities.
Reporting is a tool to help an organization analyze their service scheduling 
landscape. The service activity volume report displays either a bar graph of the 
number of service activities by month, or a table listing each service activity for the 
past twelve months. The report can also be grouped by user, facility/equipment, 
service, site, customer, and status reason.

questions from Appendix A, Sample Certification Exam Questions.
Q. 1. The required fields when creating a marketing list are which of the following? 
(Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Member Type.
2.	 Campaign Type.
3.	 List Name.
4.	 Type.
5.	 Owner.
Answer: 1, 3, 4, and 5
The required fields when creating a marketing list are List Name, 
Type, Member Type, and Owner. This is a bit of a trick question 
because although the Owner field is always pre-populated with 
the name of the user creating the record, it is still a required field.

Q. 2. Which of the following entities can you select as the member type when 
creating dynamic marketing lists? (Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Lead.
2.	 Opportunity.
3.	 Contact.
4.	 Account.
5.	 Campaign.
Answer: 1, 3, and 4
When creating marketing lists (dynamic or static), we can define 
leads, accounts, or contacts as a Member Type, and only one of 
those record types can be added as members. An opportunity 
is not tied to a marketing list at all, and a campaign can have 
related marketing lists, but cannot be a Member Type option.
Q. 3. Which of the following entities can a marketing list be associated to?  
(Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Campaigns.
2.	 Sales Literature.
3.	 Products.
4.	 Quick Campaigns.
5.	 Activities.
Answer: 1 and 4
Unlike Q. 2., this question is asking for the types of entities to which a 
marketing list can be associated. A marketing list can be associated to 
campaigns and quick campaigns from the choices above. Sales Literature 
and products can be associated to a campaign. Activities can be added to 
almost every other entity in CRM, but not to marketing lists.
Q. 4. When creating a static marketing list, what answer describes all the ways a 
member can be initially added or removed from a marketing list?
1.	 Use lookup and advanced find to add and remove members.
2.	 Use lookup and advanced find to add members, but remove  
members manually.

Appendix B
[ 281 ]
3.	 Use lookup to add members and use advanced find to remove members.
4.	 Use advanced find to add members and lookup to remove members.
5.	 None of the above.
Answer: 5
When creating a static marketing list, a member can be added by using 
a lookup, or by using the advanced find. To remove members, we can 
use advanced find. There is another option, which is to use advanced 
find to Evaluate members, but that is not what the question asked.
Q. 5. State true or false: When a static marketing list is created, the only way to add 
or remove members is to do it manually.
Answer: False
When creating a static marketing list, a member can be added using a 
lookup, or advanced find. To remove members, we can use advanced 
find. There is another option which is to use advanced find to 
"evaluate" members, which allows us to evaluate which members to 
keep on the marketing list.
Q. 6. When updating a static marketing list, what are the ways in which members 
can be managed?
1.	 Using the Manage Members button on the ribbon.
2.	 Inside a lead, account, or contact, click on the Add to Marketing List button.
3.	 If you're on a view for the accounts, contacts or leads, click on Add to 
Marketing List button.
4.	 From the advanced find view for accounts, contacts or leads, click on Add to 
Marketing List button.
5.	 All of the above.
Answer: 5
To update a static marketing list, the way members can be managed 
is by using the manage members button on the ribbon, on the actual 
record form or in a view for a particular record type, or within 
advanced find we can click on the Add to Marketing List button.

Q. 7. Which of the following statements about marketing lists are true?  
(Choose all that apply):
1.	 You can copy a dynamic marketing list to a static marketing list.
2.	 A marketing list can contain account and contact members.
3.	 You can add members to a static marketing list by using an Advanced  
Find query.
4.	 You can remove members from a dynamic marketing list by using an 
Advanced Find query.
Answer: 1, 3, and 4
The only thing we cannot do with a marketing list, given the options 
above, is that a marketing list cannot contain both account and 
contact members; it can only contain one or the other. Other than that, 
a dynamic marketing list can be copied to a static one, and we can 
add and remove members of a marketing list by using advanced find.
Q. 8. State true or false: Products can be associated to a campaign and  
campaign activities.
Answer: False
Products can only be associated to a campaign.
Q. 9. Which of the following fields are automatically calculated on a campaign? 
(Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Total Cost of Campaign Activities.
2.	 Miscellaneous Costs.
3.	 Total Cost of Campaign.
4.	 Expected ROI.
5.	 Actual ROI.
Answer: 1 and 3

Appendix B
[ 283 ]
On the campaign, the only fields that are calculated by the system are 
the TotalCostofCampaignActivities and the TotalCostoftheCampaign. 
When campaign activities are created for a campaign and the cost 
of the activity is entered by the user, the costs for each activity 
are rolled up to the campaign. The TotalCostoftheCampaign 
is the TotalCostofCampaignActivities plus the value of the 
MiscellaneousCosts for the campaign. Miscellaneous costs are manually 
entered, and the expected and actual ROI are not fields on a campaign.
Q. 10. Which of the following can be done with a quick campaign?
1.	 Create an appointment activity.
2.	 Associate sales literature.
3.	 Associate products.
4.	 Create planning activities.
5.	 Distribute activities of multiple types.
Answer: 1
Quick campaigns can only distribute one activity type as opposed 
to multiple campaign activity types. There are also no out of the box 
reports for quick campaigns, we cannot use templates, no financial 
information is tracked, no planning activities can be created, and we 
cannot associated targeted products, price lists or sales literature.
Q. 11. When distributing campaign activities, what are the possible options for 
assigning an owner to the activity? (Choose all that apply.)
1.	 You cannot assign the owner of the activity during distribution.
2.	 The person distributing the activities can own them.
3.	 Assign to another user or team.
4.	 Assign to the owner of the campaign.
5.	 Assign to the owner of the targeted marketing list.
Answer: 2, 3, and 5

Answers to Sample Certification Exam Questions
[ 284 ]
When distributing campaign activities, we can assign an owner 
during the distribution of the activities. Note that the owner 
chosen will be assigned to all of the activities distributed— it 
is all or nothing. Given that the owner can be set to the user 
distributing the activities, we can choose another user or team, 
or it can be assigned to the owner of the targeted marketing list.
Q. 12. What are the ways in which a campaign response be created automatically?  
(Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Campaign responses cannot be created automatically.
2.	 Importing using Data Import Wizard.
3.	 If e-mail tracking is enabled, and an e-mail from a campaign is responded to, 
the response can be created automatically.
4.	 By converting an activity to a campaign response.
5.	 Manually creating a response.
Answer: 2 and 3
Campaign responses can be imported via the data import tool, 
which in turn will create the responses automatically. Also, if 
e-mail tracking is enabled, and an e-mail from a campaign is 
responded to, a response is automatically created. Although 
an activity can be converted to a campaign response by using 
the Convert button found on the ribbon, it is still considered 
manual intervention because a button needs to be clicked.
Q. 13. State true or false: A campaign response can be converted into an account.
Answer: True
A campaign response can be converted into an account 
or a contact.
Q. 14. What entities can be created from a campaign response?

Answer: 4
When exporting data using the Export to Excel functionality, 
the spreadsheet can be exported as a static worksheet, a 
dynamic pivot table, or a dynamic worksheet. If the option 
for a dynamic pivot table or worksheet is chosen, a database 
connection is configured in the worksheet. That way, the next

5.	 Goal target is a way to measure a goal metric, and a goal metric is a way to 
measure a goal.
Answer: 5
A goal metric is a way to measure a goal and a goal target is a way to 
measure a goal metric. For example, a goal metric could be a count 
of the number of cases solved. The goal would be to achieve a certain 
number of cases resolved, and the metric can be used to measure that. 
A goal target is the target you wish you achieve for the goal metric.

Q. 28. Your company's default CRM currency is set to U.S. Dollar, but you created an 
opportunity for a customer that deals in British Pounds. After the opportunity was 
created, you realized you forgot to change the currency to British Pounds for this 
customer. What is the easiest way to change the currency?
1.	 Open the opportunity, and then change the currency.
2.	 Create a new opportunity that has the correct currency, and then delete the 
original opportunity.
3.	 Create a copy of the opportunity, change the currency on the copy, and then 
delete the original opportunity.
4.	 Change the default currency for your user account, and then open the 
opportunity and run the Recalculate Opportunity command.
Answer: 1
This is a commonly-asked question, and the Currency field is like 
any other lookup on any other entity. Once an opportunity has been 
created, we can change the Currency lookup value to another currency. 
Changing the value will prompt the user with a warning to check all 
money fields on the form. Once saved, the currency symbols will be 
changed to the new currency selected, but the amounts will not be 
converted. For example, if we entered a value for the EstimatedRevenue 
of an opportunity to be $1,000, and then change the currency to Euro, 
the opportunity's EstimatedRevenue will be changed to € 1,000.
Q. 29. What are the required fields when creating an opportunity?

Q. 35. How would you set up different prices for products in Dynamics CRM 2011?
1.	 Create product and then add that product to different price lists.
2.	 Create product and then add that product to different price list items.
3.	 Create a product for every price list.
4.	 Create a product, create a price list, create a price list item and add the 
product to the price list item.
5.	 None of the above.
Answer: 4
Setting up different prices in Dynamics CRM involves the 
creation of the product first, then the price list, and then 
the price list item. Associating the product to a price list 
item that is tied to a price list is how one product can have 
different prices.
Q. 36. All of an organization's customers want a discounted price as they purchase 
more units of a product. What is the best way to achieve this?
1.	 Apply a manual discount to the product when they are purchased.
2.	 Set up a discount list with an amount or percentage off the list price for 
ranges of quantities purchased.
3.	 Set up a discount list with the discounted price for ranges of  
quantities purchased.
4.	 Override the price of the product.
5.	 All of the above.
Answer: 2
To set up discounts for a product, the use of discount lists can be 
applied. Discount lists in Dynamics CRM involve volume discounts. 
This means that for certain quantities of a product ordered, a discount 
in either a dollar amount or percentage will be applied. Many other 
organizations use the term quantity breaks, which means that when 
certain quantities of products are ordered, a certain per unit price is 
set. This is not the case with Dynamics CRM, as it employs discounts 
rather than a set price.

Q. 37. When setting the rounding option for a price list item, what is the field 
dependant on?
1.	 Quantity Selling Option.
2.	 Pricing Method.
3.	 Amount.
4.	 Rounding Amount.
5.	 Rounding Policy.
Answer: 5
When creating a price list item, the Rounding Option of 
a price on the price list is not enabled until the Pricing 
Method is set to a value that includes a percentage, and the 
Rounding Policy is set to a value other than None.
Q. 38. What is the best option for creating a quote for a customer that has an existing 
opportunity and have that opportunity related to the quote?
1.	 Create the new quote and relate the existing opportunity.
2.	 Create the new quote and get the products from the existing opportunity.
3.	 Create the new quote directly from the existing opportunity.
4.	 Create the new quote and re-associate the products from the opportunity to 
the quote.
Answer: 3
A quote can easily be created from an existing opportunity 
for a customer by simply creating the new quote directly 
from the opportunity.  Doing so allows all the opportunity 
products to be added as quote products. The options are 
valid, but it's not the easiest or best option.
Q. 39. What are the various statuses of a quote?
1.	 In Progress, Open, Won, Revised, Lost or Canceled.
2.	 Open, Won, Lost.
3.	 Lost, Won, Canceled.
4.	 Open, Closed, Canceled.
5.	 Open, Closed, Revised.
Answer: 1

Appendix B
[ 295 ]
A quote can have a status of In Progress, 
Open, Revised, Lost, or Canceled.
Q. 40. When an order is created from a quote and the pricing changes, how can the 
order reflect the updated prices?
1.	 It can't; the order will need to be canceled or deleted, and then re-created 
with the new price list.
2.	 Create a new order with the same products and change the price list.
3.	 Click on the Use Current Pricing button.
4.	 Change the price list on the order.
Answer: 3
When an order is created from a quote and the price changes, 
clicking on the UseCurrentPricing button will update the price in 
the quote to the new price. This can be a potentially troublesome 
option because often customer quotes are static and a customer 
might expect the price quoted even if prices go up.
Q. 41. How can an invoice be created? (Choose all that apply)
1.	 Manually.
2.	 From a quote.
3.	 From an order.
4.	 From another invoice.
5.	 From an opportunity.
Answer: 1, 3, and 5
An invoice can be created automatically or manually from 
an opportunity or generated from a quote or an order.
Q. 42. If you're on an invoice product, how can you get to the invoice?
1.	 Click on the invoice lookup field.
2.	 Open a new window, copy the invoice detail URL, and then change the 
entity name from invoice detail to invoice.

Answers to Sample Certification Exam Questions
[ 296 ]
3.	 Click on the left hand navigation and click on invoices.
4.	 From an invoice detail record, you cannot get to the invoice record.
Answer: 4
An invoice product is a unique entity in Dynamics CRM 
in that most of the security permissions for this entity are 
inherited from the privileges set for an invoice. Also, even 
though there is a relationship from invoice to invoice product, 
the lookup field cannot be placed on the invoice product form. 
The field is locked down and is not customizable.
Q. 43. What can a user do with the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Outlook client? 
(Choose all that apply)
1.	 Synchronize activity records that the employee owns.
2.	 Synchronize activity records assigned to a team that the user is a part of.
3.	 Automatically create contact or lead records from tracked e-mail messages 
while online.
4.	 Automatically create contact or lead records from tracked e-mail messages 
while offline.
Answer: 1, 2, and 3
The Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Outlook client allows us to 
perform almost any action that the Dynamics CRM 2011 web client 
would allow. A unique feature of the Dynamics CRM 2011 Outlook 
client is that when a user is online, tracked e-mail messages can be 
used to automatically create a contact or lead record.
Q. 44. Which statement is true about the use of Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 
Outlook client?
1.	 Deleting a contact record in Microsoft Dynamics CRM for which you are the 
owner will delete the contact from Outlook.
2.	 Deleting a completed task that is tracked in Outlook will delete the task 
activity record from Microsoft Dynamics CRM.
3.	 Deleting an e-mail message in Microsoft Dynamics CRM will delete the 
tracked e-mail message from Outlook.

Appendix B
[ 297 ]
4.	 Deleting a tracked e-mail message in Outlook will delete the e-mail message 
from Microsoft Dynamics CRM.
Answer: 2
Using the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Outlook client, 
deleting a completed task that is tracked (has a connection 
to task record in Dynamics CRM) will delete the task record 
from Dynamics CRM. Deleting contacts and/or e-mail 
messages from either the Outlook client or the web client 
will not "synch" or delete them in the other system.
Q. 45. How can a case be resolved when it has open activities?
1.	 Close the open activities, and then close the case.
2.	 You can close the case even if there are open activities.
3.	 Close the case, and then close the open activities.
4.	 Close the case and leave the activities open.
Answer: 1
Cases cannot be resolved when they have open activities 
associated to them. Associated means that the activity 
has its regarding field referencing a case. One of the 
nuances of a case is that when resolving it all open 
activities must be closed.
Q. 46. Which of the following statements about cases in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
2011 are true? (Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Cases can be assigned to teams.
2.	 A case must be assigned a subject.
3.	 Custom activity types can be converted into cases.
4.	 Only out of the box activities can be converted to a case.
Answer: 1 and 3
New to Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011, as opposed to previous 
version of Dynamics CRM, cases, as with many other record 
types, can be assigned to teams. Like other activities, a custom 
activity can also be converted into a case. A case does have the 
option of having a subject, but it's not required.

Answers to Sample Certification Exam Questions
[ 298 ]
Q. 47. Which of the following actions can be taken on a resolved case?  
(Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Creating notes.
2.	 Adding activities.
3.	 Assigning a new owner.
4.	 Modifying the case fields.
Answer: 1
Once a case is resolved, it's pretty much read only, so the only 
action allowed is adding notes. Because all open activities 
need to be resolved to close a case, adding activities is not 
allowed. Because the form is read only, assigning a new 
owner or modifying fields on the form is also not allowed.
Q. 48. How can a case be tied to a specific queue? (Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Add the case to the queue directly.
2.	 Assign the case to the queue.
3.	 From any view, select the case and assign the case to the queue.
4.	 From any view, select the case and route the case to a queue.
Answer: 1
A case can be added to a queue directly from the case form.  A case 
can only be assigned to a user or team, and not to a queue. A case 
can be added to a queue from any view as well, but routing a case 
to a queue means that the case is already tied to another queue.
Q. 49. What is required when creating a knowledge base article?  
(Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Knowledge base article template.
2.	 Title.
3.	 Subject.
4.	 Key Words.
5.	 Language.
Answer: 1, 2, and 3

Appendix B
[ 299 ]
The following fields are required when creating knowledge base 
article: Title and Subject. This is a bit of a trick question because 
in order to create a knowledge base article, a knowledge base 
article template must be used, so that is also a valid option.
Q. 50. If you deactivate a Knowledge Base article template, what happens to the 
knowledge base articles created from that template that are in various stages of the 
publishing process?
1.	 All articles based on the deactivated template are disabled.
2.	 Nothing happens to draft articles, but published articles get deactivated.
3.	 All articles based on the deactivated template are still active.
4.	 Unapproved and Draft articles using the article template are deactivated.
Answer: 4
When a knowledge base article template is deactivated, 
no new knowledge base articles can be created from the 
template, and any unapproved or draft knowledge base 
articles using the template are also deactivated.
Q. 51. What are the different options for searches that can be performed on a 
knowledge base article?
1.	 Full Text, Keyword, Title, Subject, Article Number.
2.	 Article Number, Exact Word Search, Use Like Words Search.
3.	 Exact Word Search, Similar Word Search, Full Text.
4.	 Full Text, Keyword, Exact Word, Article Number.
5.	 Full Text, Keyword, Exact Word, Use Like Word.
Answer: 1
When searching for knowledge base articles, we can use a Full 
Text Search, Keyword Search, Article Number, and search by 
Title or Subject. This is also a bit of a trick question because 
the question asks for the search options. There are different 
"types" of searches, which can include exact word or use like 
words, but these are not the different search options.

Answers to Sample Certification Exam Questions
[ 300 ]
Q. 52. Which of the following actions can you perform with knowledge base articles? 
(Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Attach an article to a case.
2.	 Attach an article to a product.
3.	 Attach an article to a campaign.
4.	 E-mail an article to a contact.
5.	 Attach an article to a marketing list.
Answer: 1
A knowledge base article can be attached to a case or 
sales literature, and only a link to the knowledge base 
article can be e-mailed.
Q. 53. Which of the following is true about deactivating and deleting queues? 
(Choose all that apply.)
1.	 When a queue is deactivated, all queue items are removed from the queue.
2.	 A queue cannot be deleted if it contains queue items.
3.	 Besides 1 and 2, a queue can be deactivated or deleted anytime.
4.	 All of the above.
5.	 None of the above.
Answer: 4
When a queue is deactivated, all queue items are removed 
from the queue. A queue cannot be deleted if it contains queue 
items, and a queue can be deactivated or deleted at any time.
Q. 54. What happens when something is added to a queue?
1.	 A queue item is created associated to the queue and to the record  
being associated.
2.	 The record is directly added to the queue.
3.	 A queue item is created and associated to the record added and associated to 
nothing else.

Appendix B
[ 301 ]
4.	 The record becomes deactivated until someone chooses to work on the item.
5.	 The worked on field automatically gets set to the name of the user adding the 
record to the queue.
Answer: 1
When something is added to a queue, a queue item is 
created and the queue item is associated directly to the 
queue. The record is never directly tied to the queue and 
the worked on field only gets set when a user chooses the 
item to work on from the queue.
Q. 55. When users are added to a team, how is the security role on the team applied?
1.	 The security role on the team supersedes that of the users.
2.	 The security role of the user supersedes that of the team.
3.	 The role of the user with the highest privilege is applied to all the users.
4.	 The privileges are additive between the team and user.
Answer: 4
Users in Dynamics CRM must have at least one security role 
defined for them. The security role is a collection of privileges for 
each entity in the system. When users are added to a team, the 
user's privilege still applies but the privileges defined for the team 
will be added as well. For example, if a user has read permission 
for an account, but does not have write permission and then is 
added to a team whose security role gives users write privilege for 
the account, then the user now inherits that privilege.
Q. 56. State true or false: A team can be deleted; a user cannot.
Answer: True
In Microsoft Dynamics CRM, a user cannot be 
deleted, but a team can be deleted.
Q. 57. What are the advantages of a team? (Choose all that apply.)
1.	 It allows users to work collaboratively across an organization.
2.	 It is one way in which users from different business units can work on a 
record when individual security roles might not allow that.

Answers to Sample Certification Exam Questions
[ 302 ]
3.	 It lets multiple users create a record at the same time.
4.	 It allows multiple users to own a record at the same time.
Answer: 1 and 2
The introduction of teams in Dynamics CRM 2011 has been a 
tremendous addition because it allows users to work collaboratively 
across an organization. Let's say we have two users with a security 
role that allows them to only see accounts in their respective 
business units. Let's now say those two users need to see some 
accounts outside each of their business units. We can create a team 
with the proper privilege and add these two users to the team. This 
can be accomplished by using Dynamics CRM sharing as well, but 
this is another option. Teams do not allow multiple users to create a 
record at the same time. Option 4 is not a correct option in that CRM 
allows a team to own a record, but this is not the same thing. For 
example, My Active Accounts view will not show accounts owned 
by teams that I am a member of so I don't own the record.
Q. 58. What are the required fields when creating a contract template?  
(Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Name.
2.	 Abbreviation.
3.	 Billing Frequency.
4.	 Allotment Type.
5.	 Calendar.
Answer: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
When creating a contract template, the required fields 
are TemplateName, Abbreviation, AllotmentType, 
BillingFrequency, and Calendar.
Q. 59. What are the different contract allotment options?
1.	 Number of cases, time, and coverage dates.
2.	 Numbers of cases, time for each case, begin and end dates.
3.	 Time, Coverage Dates, and length of each case.
4.	 Number of Active Cases, time, and coverage dates.
Answer: 1

Appendix B
[ 303 ]
When selecting an allotment type for a contract template, 
the valid options are Number of Cases, Time for Each 
Case, and CoverageDates.
Q. 60. What statuses of a contract make it ineligible to delete?
1.	 Draft, Invoiced.
2.	 Invoiced, Active.
3.	 Draft, Active.
4.	 Canceled, Expired.
5.	 Draft, Canceled, Expired.
Answer: 2
A contract has the following statuses and explanations:
•	
Draft: The means the contract can still be worked on, but it 
cannot be associated to a case.
•	
Invoiced: Once a contract is saved, the default status is "Draft."  
The contextual ribbon now displays a button to invoice the 
contract.  This can only be done if contract lines have been 
created.  Once a contract is in the invoiced state, it cannot be 
edited or deleted.
•	
Active: The next stage in the contract life cycle is "Active."  A 
contract will automatically be set to active when the contract 
has started, i.e. the start date of the contract = today's date.  
This is the only status that allows a contract to be associated to 
a case. A contract with this status cannot be edited or deleted.
•	
OnHold: Once a contract is activated, it can be placed on hold 
at any time.  Once on hold, the contract cannot be edited or 
deleted.
•	
Canceled
•	
Expired: Once the end date of the contract has been reached, 
the contract status automatically gets changed to expired.
Q. 61. If a contract is in the active status, what can you do with the contract?
1.	 Delete the contract.
2.	 Edit the contract.

Answers to Sample Certification Exam Questions
[ 304 ]
3.	 Add contract lines.
4.	 Add it to an opportunity.
Answer: 3
A contract will automatically be set to active when the 
contract has started, i.e. the start date of the contract = 
today's date.  This is the only status that allows a contract 
to be associated to a case. A contract with this status 
cannot be edited or deleted, but you can add contract 
lines to the contract.
Q. 62. When a contract is on hold, what can you do?
1.	 Add contract lines.
2.	 Edit the contract.
3.	 Copy contract.
4.	 Add the contract to a case.
Answer: 3
When a contract is on hold, the only options 
available are Copy Contract, Release Hold, 
and Set Calendar.
Q. 63. What resource allocation should be used if you want to distribute work evenly 
across all resources?
1.	 Even.
2.	 Least Busy.
3.	 Distributed.
4.	 Shared.
Answer: 2
A least busy criteria means the resource with the most 
availability will be scheduled first, and while randomly 
resource allocation type will schedule the resources on a 
random basis.

Appendix B
[ 305 ]
Q. 64. Where is the configuration for the resources required to perform a service?
1.	 In the resource selection rules section.
2.	 In a resource group.
3.	 On the user record.
4.	 On the resource record.
Answer: 1
A selection rule determines the resources required to perform 
a service. A resource group is a way to group resources 
according to a set of criteria, which could be skill sets, for 
example. The user record allows us to define a user's work 
schedule and there is no such thing as a resource record.
Q. 65. How can the capacity of a facility be set? (Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Edit the resource selection rule.
2.	 Edit the equipment's work schedule.
3.	 Edit the service selection rule.
4.	 Edit each facility's work schedule.
Answer: 3 and 4
The capacity of a facility can be set by editing the service 
selection rule for a service or by editing the user's work 
schedule. Equipment cannot have a work schedule and 
editing the service selection rule defines the resources 
required to perform the specific service.
Q. 66. What fields are required to create a service activity? (Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Account.
2.	 Contact.
3.	 Service.
4.	 Start Time.
5.	 Subject.
Answer: 3, 4, and 5
When creating a service activity, the following fields are required: subject, 
service, start time, end time and owner. Although the owner field is 
defaulted to the user creating the record, it's still a required field.

Answers to Sample Certification Exam Questions
[ 306 ]
Q. 67. What is the scheduling scenario that defines one customer working with one 
service person?
1.	 Individual scenario.
2.	 Individual contributor scenario.
3.	 Singular scenario.
4.	 One person scenario.
Answer: 1
Individual Scenario is the most simple/basic example of service 
scheduling. In this scenario, Dynamics CRM can schedule one individual 
to meet with a customer. For example, let's say a client of Race2Win 
Insurance Company raised an issue with a duplicate bill being sent. 
Race2Win can offer someone from the billing department to go to the 
client site, meet with the person that raised the issue and resolve it. 
Q. 68. When setting up a user's work schedule, how can it be configured to observe 
holidays the business observes?
1.	 Don't schedule the user on holidays.
2.	 Click on exclude holidays in the user's record.
3.	 When setting up a user's weekly schedule, click on Observe, under the 
business closures option.
4.	 When setting up a user's weekly schedule, click on Acknowledge, under the 
business closures option.
5.	 When setting up a user's weekly schedule, click on Off, under the business 
closures option.
Answer: 3
When setting up a user's weekly schedule, click on Observe, under the 
business closures option.
Q. 69. Where are customer service preferences configured?
1.	 On the service activity record.
2.	 On the account or contact record.

Appendix B
[ 307 ]
3.	 On the account, contact, or lead record.
4.	 On the user's record.
Answer: 2
Customer service preferences are found in a tab on the 
account or contact form. When setting up customer service 
preferences, the preferences are copied to the service activity.
Q. 70. State true or false: When setting up customer service preferences, the 
preferences are copied to the service activities.
Answer: False
The customer's preferences are taken into 
consideration when the Schedule feature is used, but 
the values are not copied to the service activity.
Q. 71. What does the service scheduling engine do?
1.	 Gives users the best option for the resource to use to complete the  
given service.
2.	 Automatically schedules resources and resolves any conflicts.
3.	 Uses the selection rule for the service as the primary factor.
4.	 Starts up, schedules all services, and then goes back to sleep.
Answer: 1
According to documentation found on MSDN (which is also  
noted in this book), CRM provides functionality to enable 
appointment-based service scheduling. You can define services, 
resources and work schedules, and service locations. A scheduling 
engine manages appointments and service availability, and can 
be tuned to optimize scheduling in order to reduce costs and 
required resources. Thus the service scheduling engine gives the 
user the best option for a resource to complete the given service.

Q. 72. What are the different ways in which a service activity can be rescheduled?  
(Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Open the activity and change the dates.
2.	 Open the activity and click on schedule.
3.	 Close the original service activity and create a new one with the new date.
4.	 Clone the service activity and reset the date of the cloned activity.
Answer: 1 and 2
A service activity can be rescheduled either by 
modifying the activity dates or by opening the 
activity and clicking on Schedule.
Q. 73. What are the different status reasons of a service activity?
1.	 Open, Won, Lost.
2.	 Completed, Canceled, No Show.
3.	 Completed, Canceled, Lost.
4.	 Completed, Canceled, Did Not Show.
5.	 Completed, Canceled, No Appointment.
Answer: 2
The different status reasons of a service activity 
are Completed, Canceled, or No Show.
Q. 74. What are some advantages of the service calendar? (Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Helps resolve scheduling conflicts.
2.	 Helps search for service activities.
3.	 Shows a list of all appointments, including service activities, for a user.
4.	 Automatically adjusts for daylight savings.
Answer: 1, 2, and 3
The service calendar helps users to resolve scheduling 
conflicts, search for service activities—especially using the 
filtering capabilities of the calendar—and it shows a list of all 
appointments, including service activities for a user.

Appendix B
[ 309 ]
Q. 75. What does the service activity volume report display? (Choose all that apply.)
1.	 Total duration of all tasks.
2.	 Total number of activities.
3.	 Total count of service activities.
4.	 Total duration of all service activities.
5.	 Total sum of hours worked on service activities.
Answer: 3 and 4
CRM does not provide out of the box charts for service 
activities, however like anything in Dynamics CRM, these can 
be configured very easily. Out of the box, Dynamics provides 
the service activity volume report.
The service activity volume report is a bar chart that displays 
the total count of service activities or total duration of all 
service activities. Another option for this report is to group the 
data by user, facility/equipment, service, site, customer and 
status reason.
